This building replaced a ''hekatompedon'' ('hundred-footer') and would have stood beside the [[Old Temple of Athena|archaic temple dedicated to ''Athena Polias'']] ('of the city').

Further physical evidence of this structure was revealed with the excavations of [[Panagiotis Kavvadias]] of 1885\u201390. The findings of this dig allowed [[Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld]], then director of the [[German Archaeological Institute]], to assert that there existed a distinct substructure to the original Parthenon, called Parthenon I by D\u00f6rpfeld, not immediately below the present edifice as had been previously assumed.<ref>W. D\u00f6rpfeld, \"Der aeltere Parthenon\", ''Ath. Mitteilungen'', XVII, 1892, pp. 158\u2013189 and W. D\u00f6rpfeld, \"Die Zeit des alteren Parthenon\", ''AM'' '''27''', 1902, 379\u2013416</ref> D\u00f6rpfeld's observation was that the three steps of the first Parthenon consisted of two steps of Poros limestone, the same as the foundations, and a top step of Karrha limestone that was covered by the lowest step of the Periclean Parthenon. This platform was smaller and slightly to the north of the final Parthenon, indicating that it was built for a wholly different building, now completely covered over. This picture was somewhat complicated by the publication of the final report on the 1885\u201390 excavations, indicating that the substructure was contemporary with the Kimonian walls, and implying a later date for the first temple.<ref>P.

However, the excavations of [[Bert Hodge Hill]] led him to propose the existence of a second Parthenon, begun in the period of [[Cimon|Kimon]] after 468&nbsp;BC.<ref>B.H. Hill, \"The Older Parthenon\", ''AJA', XVI, 1912, 535\u201358</ref> Hill claimed that the Karrha limestone step D\u00f6rpfeld thought was the highest of Parthenon I was in fact the lowest of the three steps of Parthenon II, whose stylobate dimensions Hill calculated at {{convert|23.51|x|66.888|m|2|lk=on}}.\n\nOne difficulty in dating the proto-Parthenon is that at the time of the 1885 excavation the archaeological method of [[seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] was not fully developed; the careless digging and refilling of the site led to a loss of much valuable information. An attempt to discuss and make sense of the potsherds found on the Acropolis came with the two-volume study by Graef and Langlotz published in 1925\u201333.<ref>B. Graef, E. Langlotz, ''Die Antiken Vasen von der Akropolis zu Athen'', Berlin 1925\u201333</ref> This inspired American archaeologist [[William Bell Dinsmoor]] to attempt to supply limiting dates for the temple platform and the five walls hidden under the re-terracing of the Acropolis. Dinsmoor concluded that the latest possible date for Parthenon I was no earlier than 495&nbsp;BC, contradicting the early date given by D\u00f6rpfeld.<ref>W.

The most important buildings visible on the Acropolis today \u2013 the Parthenon, the [[Propylaia]], the [[Erechtheion]] and the temple of [[Athena Nike]] \u2013 were erected during this period. The Parthenon was built under the general supervision of the artist [[Phidias]], who also had charge of the sculptural decoration. The architects [[Ictinos]] and [[Callicrates]] began their work in 447 BC, and the building was substantially completed by 432. However, work on the decorations continued until at least 431.\n\n[[File:Parthenon restoration.gif|thumb|Parthenon animation showing the building in the past and in present day]]\nThe Parthenon was built primarily by men who knew how to work marble. These quarrymen had exceptional skills and were able to cut the blocks of marble to very specific measurements. The quarrymen also knew how to avoid the faults, which were numerous in the Pentelic marble. If the marble blocks were not up to standard, the architects would reject them. The marble was worked with iron tools -- picks, points, punches, chisels and drills. The quarrymen would hold their tools against the marble block and firmly tap the surface of the rock.<ref>Woodford, S. (2008). The Parthenon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nA big project like the Parthenon attracted stonemasons from far and wide who traveled to Athens to assist in the project. Slaves and foreigners worked together with the Athenian citizens in the building of the Parthenon, doing the same jobs for the same pay. Temple building was a very specialized craft, and there were not many men in Greece qualified to build temples like the Parthenon, so these men would travel around and work where they were needed.<ref>Woodford, S. (2008). The Parthenon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nOther craftsmen also were necessary in the building of the Parthenon, specifically carpenters and metalworkers. Unskilled laborers also had key roles in the building of the Parthenon. These laborers loaded and unloaded the marble blocks and moved the blocks from place to place. In order to complete a project like the Parthenon, a number of different laborers were needed, and each played a critical role in constructing the final building.<ref>Woodford, S. (2008). The Parthenon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Parthenon plan.png|thumb|right|Floor plan of the Parthenon]]\n\nThe Parthenon is a [[peripteral]] [[octastyle]] [[Doric order|Doric]] temple with [[Ionic order|Ionic]] architectural features. It stands on a platform or [[stylobate]] of three steps. In common with other Greek temples, it is of [[post and lintel]] construction and is surrounded by columns ('peripteral') carrying an [[entablature]]. There are eight columns at either end ('octastyle') and 17 on the sides. There is a double row of columns at either end. The colonnade surrounds an inner masonry structure, the ''[[cella]],'' which is divided into two compartments. At either end of the building the [[gable]] is finished with a triangular [[pediment]] originally occupied by sculpted figures. The columns are of the [[Doric order]], with simple capitals, fluted shafts, and no bases. Above the architrave of the entablature is a [[frieze]] of carved pictorial panels ([[Metope (architecture)|metopes]]), separated by formal architectural [[triglyph]]s, typical of the Doric order. Around the cella and across the lintels of the inner columns runs a continuous sculptured [[frieze]] in low relief. This element of the architecture is [[Ionic order|Ionic]] in style rather than Doric.<ref>Banister Fletcher, ''History of architecture on the Comparative Method'', pp. 119\u2013123</ref>\n\nMeasured at the stylobate, the dimensions of the base of the Parthenon are {{convert|69.5|by|30.9|m|ft}}. The cella was 29.8&nbsp;metres long by 19.2&nbsp;metres wide (97.8&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;63.0&nbsp;ft). On the exterior, the Doric columns measure {{convert|1.9|m|ft}} in diameter and are {{convert|10.4|m|ft}} high. The corner columns are slightly larger in diameter. The Parthenon had 46 outer columns and 23 inner columns in total, each column containing 20 flutes. (A flute is the [[wikt:concave|concave]] shaft carved into the column form.) The roof was covered with large overlapping marble tiles known as [[imbrex and tegula|imbrices and tegulae]].<ref>{{cite book|title=American Architect and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIdMAAAAYAAJ|year=1892|publisher=American Architect}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Tegula.html|title=LacusCurtius \u2022 Roman Architecture \u2014 Roof Tiles (Smith's Dictionary, 1875)|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|language=en|access-date=8 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Parthenon is regarded as the finest example of Greek architecture. The temple, wrote [[John Julius Cooper]], \"Enjoys the reputation of being the most perfect Doric temple ever built. Even in antiquity, its architectural refinements were legendary, especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the [[naos (architecture)|naos]] walls and the ''entasis'' of the columns.\"<ref>John Julius Norwich, ''Great Architecture of the World'', 2001, p. 63</ref><!-- If we must have this quote let's at least get it right. --> ''[[Entasis]]'' refers to the slight swelling, of {{convert|4|cm}}, in the center of the columns to counteract the appearance of columns having a waist, as the swelling makes them look straight from a distance. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in many other classical Greek temples,<ref>And in the surviving foundations of the preceding Older Parthenon (Penrose, ''Principles of Athenian Architecture'' 2nd ed. ch. II.3, plate 9).</ref> it has a slight parabolic upward curvature intended to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes.

Since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the [[architrave]] and roof above: \"All follow the rule of being built to delicate curves\", Gorham Stevens observed when pointing out that, in addition, the west front was built at a slightly higher level than that of the east front.<ref>Penrose ''op. cit.'' pp. 32\u201334, found the difference motivated by economies of labour; Gorham P. Stevens, \"Concerning the Impressiveness of the Parthenon\" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''66'''.3 (July 1962:337\u2013338).</ref>\n\nIt is not universally agreed what the intended effect of these \"optical refinements\" was. They may serve as a sort of \"reverse optical illusion.\"<ref>Archeologists discuss similarly curved architecture and offer the theory.

In this case, the ceiling and floor of the temple may seem to bow in the presence of the surrounding angles of the building. Striving for perfection, the designers may have added these curves, compensating for the illusion by creating their own curves, thus negating this effect and allowing the temple to be seen as they intended. It is also suggested that it was to enliven what might have appeared an inert mass in the case of a building without curves. But the comparison ought to be, according to Smithsonian historian Evan Hadingham, with the Parthenon's more obviously curved predecessors than with a notional rectilinear temple.<ref name=SmithMag>{{Citation|last=Hadingham|first=Evan|year=February 2008|title=Unlocking Mysteries of the Parthenon |publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|location= Washington, DC|page=42}}</ref>\n\nSome studies of the Acropolis, including of the Parthenon and its fa\u00e7ade, have conjectured that many of its proportions approximate the [[golden ratio]].<ref>Van Mersbergen, Audrey M., \"Rhetorical Prototypes in Architecture: Measuring the Acropolis,\" ''Philosophical Polemic Communication Quarterly'', Vol. 46, 1998.</ref> However, such theories have been discredited by more recent studies, which have shown that the proportions of the Parthenon do not match the golden proportion.<ref>{{cite journal|author=George Markowsky|url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf|title=Misconceptions about the Golden Ratio|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=23|issue=1|date=January 1992|access-date=4 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408200850/http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf|archive-date=8 April 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Livio|first=Mario|authorlink=Mario Livio|title=The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, the World's Most Astonishing Number|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUARfgWRH14C|origyear=2002|edition=First trade paperback|year=2003|publisher=[[Random House|Broadway Books]]|location=New York City|isbn=0-7679-0816-3|pages=74\u20135}}</ref>\n\n==Sculpture==\n[[File:British Museum (8375482047).jpg|thumb|Group from the east pediment, [[British Museum]].]]\nThe cella of the Parthenon housed the [[Athena Parthenos|chryselephantine statue of Athena Parthenos]] sculpted by [[Phidias]] and dedicated in 439 or 438&nbsp;BC.

By the year 438, the sculptural decoration of the Doric metopes on the [[frieze]] above the exterior colonnade, and of the Ionic frieze around the upper portion of the walls of the [[cella]], had been completed. In the ''opisthodomus'' (the back room of the cella) were stored the monetary contributions of the Delian League, of which Athens was the leading member.\n\nOnly a very small number of the sculptures remain ''in situ''; most of the surviving sculptures are today (controversially) in the [[British Museum]] in London as the [[Elgin Marbles]], and the Athens [[Acropolis Museum]], but a few pieces are also in the [[Louvre]], [[National Museum of Denmark]], and museums in Rome, [[Vienna]] and [[Palermo]].<ref>For comprehensive drawings showing the location of each piece today, see: [https://www.academia.edu/2543561/The_Parthenon= \"The Parthenon\", in ''Strolling Through Athens''], City of Athens, 2004, pp. 112\u2013119.</ref>\n\n===Metopes===\n{{Main|Metopes of the Parthenon}}\n[[File:Parthenon XL.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the West metopes]]\n\nThe frieze of the Parthenon's entablature contained 92 [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]], 14 each on the east and west sides, 32 each on the north and south sides.

The metopes of the west end show the [[Amazonomachy]] (the mythical battle of the Athenians against the [[Amazons]]). The metopes of the south side show the Thessalian [[Centauromachy]] (battle of the [[Lapiths]] aided by [[Theseus]] against the half-man, half-horse [[Centaur]]s).

The bas-relief frieze was carved in situ; it is dated to 442&nbsp;BC-438&nbsp;BC.\n\nOne interpretation is that it depicts an idealized version of the [[Panathenaic Festival|Panathenaic procession]] from the Dipylon Gate in the [[Kerameikos]] to the [[Acropolis]]. In this procession held every year, with a special procession taking place every four years, Athenians and foreigners were participating to honour the goddess [[Athena]], offering sacrifices and a new [[peplos]] (dress woven by selected noble Athenian girls called ''ergastines'').

She identifies the central panel above the door of the Parthenon as the pre-battle sacrifice of the daughter of [[King Erechtheus]], a sacrifice that ensured Athenian victory over [[Eumolpos]] and his Thracian army. The great procession marching toward the east end of the Parthenon shows the post-battle thanksgiving sacrifice of cattle and sheep, honey and water, followed by the triumphant army of Erechtheus returning from their victory. This represents the very first Panathenaia set in mythical times, the model on which historic Panathenaic processions was based.<ref>Connelly, ''Parthenon and Parthenoi'', 53\u201380.</ref><ref>Connelly, ''The Parthenon Enigma'', chapters 4, 5, and 7.</ref>\n\n===Pediments===\n{{Main|Pediments of the Parthenon}}\nThe traveller [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], when he visited the Acropolis at the end of the 2nd century AD, only mentioned briefly the sculptures of the [[pediment]]s (gable ends) of the temple, reserving the majority of his description for the gold and ivory statue of the goddess inside.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias1B.html |title=Description of Greece |author=Pausanias |author-link=Pausanias (geographer) |translator-first=W.H.S. |translator-last=Jones |year=1918 |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press |at=Book 1, 24.5}}</ref>\n\n====East pediment====\n[[File:Partenon04.JPG|thumb|Part of the east pediment still found on the Parthenon (although part of it, like Dionysos, is a copy)]]\n\nThe figures on the corners of the pediment depict the passage of time over the course of a full day.

This building replaced a ''hekatompedon'' ('hundred-footer') and would have stood beside the [[Old Temple of Athena|archaic temple dedicated to ''Athena Polias'']] ('of the city'). The [[Older Parthenon|Older or Pre-Parthenon]], as it is frequently referred to, was still under construction when the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] sacked the city in 480&nbsp;BC and razed the Acropolis.<ref name=\"venieri-acropolis\">{{cite web|url=http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/3/eh351.jsp?obj_id=2384 |title=Acropolis of Athens |author=Ioanna Venieri |publisher=Hellenic Ministry of Culture |accessdate=4 May 2007}}</ref><ref>Hurwit 2005, p. 135</ref>\n\nThe existence of both the proto-Parthenon and its destruction were known from [[Herodotus]],<ref>Herodotus Histories, 8.53</ref> and the drums of its columns were plainly visible built into the curtain wall north of the [[Erechtheion]]. Further physical evidence of this structure was revealed with the excavations of [[Panagiotis Kavvadias]] of 1885\u201390. The findings of this dig allowed [[Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld]], then director of the [[German Archaeological Institute]], to assert that there existed a distinct substructure to the original Parthenon, called Parthenon I by D\u00f6rpfeld, not immediately below the present edifice as had been previously assumed.<ref>W. D\u00f6rpfeld, \"Der aeltere Parthenon\", ''Ath. Mitteilungen'', XVII, 1892, pp. 158\u2013189 and W.

This platform was smaller and slightly to the north of the final Parthenon, indicating that it was built for a wholly different building, now completely covered over. This picture was somewhat complicated by the publication of the final report on the 1885\u201390 excavations, indicating that the substructure was contemporary with the Kimonian walls, and implying a later date for the first temple.<ref>P.

However, the excavations of [[Bert Hodge Hill]] led him to propose the existence of a second Parthenon, begun in the period of [[Cimon|Kimon]] after 468&nbsp;BC.<ref>B.H. Hill, \"The Older Parthenon\", ''AJA', XVI, 1912, 535\u201358</ref> Hill claimed that the Karrha limestone step D\u00f6rpfeld thought was the highest of Parthenon I was in fact the lowest of the three steps of Parthenon II, whose stylobate dimensions Hill calculated at {{convert|23.51|x|66.888|m|2|lk=on}}.\n\nOne difficulty in dating the proto-Parthenon is that at the time of the 1885 excavation the archaeological method of [[seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] was not fully developed; the careless digging and refilling of the site led to a loss of much valuable information. An attempt to discuss and make sense of the potsherds found on the Acropolis came with the two-volume study by Graef and Langlotz published in 1925\u201333.<ref>B. Graef, E. Langlotz, ''Die Antiken Vasen von der Akropolis zu Athen'', Berlin 1925\u201333</ref> This inspired American archaeologist [[William Bell Dinsmoor]] to attempt to supply limiting dates for the temple platform and the five walls hidden under the re-terracing of the Acropolis. Dinsmoor concluded that the latest possible date for Parthenon I was no earlier than 495&nbsp;BC, contradicting the early date given by D\u00f6rpfeld.<ref>W. Dinsmoor, \"The Date of the Older Parthenon\", ''AJA'', XXXVIII, 1934, 408\u201348</ref> Further, Dinsmoor denied that there were two proto-Parthenons, and held that the only pre-Periclean temple was what D\u00f6rpfeld referred to as Parthenon II. Dinsmoor and D\u00f6rpfeld exchanged views in the ''American Journal of Archaeology'' in 1935.<ref>W. D\u00f6rpfeld, \"Parthenon I, II, III\", ''AJA'', XXXIX, 1935, 497\u2013507, and W.

The most important buildings visible on the Acropolis today \u2013 the Parthenon, the [[Propylaia]], the [[Erechtheion]] and the temple of [[Athena Nike]] \u2013 were erected during this period. The Parthenon was built under the general supervision of the artist [[Phidias]], who also had charge of the sculptural decoration. The architects [[Ictinos]] and [[Callicrates]] began their work in 447 BC, and the building was substantially completed by 432. However, work on the decorations continued until at least 431.\n\n[[File:Parthenon restoration.gif|thumb|Parthenon animation showing the building in the past and in present day]]\nThe Parthenon was built primarily by men who knew how to work marble. These quarrymen had exceptional skills and were able to cut the blocks of marble to very specific measurements. The quarrymen also knew how to avoid the faults, which were numerous in the Pentelic marble. If the marble blocks were not up to standard, the architects would reject them. The marble was worked with iron tools -- picks, points, punches, chisels and drills. The quarrymen would hold their tools against the marble block and firmly tap the surface of the rock.<ref>Woodford, S. (2008). The Parthenon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nA big project like the Parthenon attracted stonemasons from far and wide who traveled to Athens to assist in the project. Slaves and foreigners worked together with the Athenian citizens in the building of the Parthenon, doing the same jobs for the same pay. Temple building was a very specialized craft, and there were not many men in Greece qualified to build temples like the Parthenon, so these men would travel around and work where they were needed.<ref>Woodford, S. (2008). The Parthenon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nOther craftsmen also were necessary in the building of the Parthenon, specifically carpenters and metalworkers. Unskilled laborers also had key roles in the building of the Parthenon. These laborers loaded and unloaded the marble blocks and moved the blocks from place to place. In order to complete a project like the Parthenon, a number of different laborers were needed, and each played a critical role in constructing the final building.<ref>Woodford, S. (2008). The Parthenon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Parthenon plan.png|thumb|right|Floor plan of the Parthenon]]\n\nThe Parthenon is a [[peripteral]] [[octastyle]] [[Doric order|Doric]] temple with [[Ionic order|Ionic]] architectural features. It stands on a platform or [[stylobate]] of three steps. In common with other Greek temples, it is of [[post and lintel]] construction and is surrounded by columns ('peripteral') carrying an [[entablature]]. There are eight columns at either end ('octastyle') and 17 on the sides. There is a double row of columns at either end. The colonnade surrounds an inner masonry structure, the ''[[cella]],'' which is divided into two compartments. At either end of the building the [[gable]] is finished with a triangular [[pediment]] originally occupied by sculpted figures. The columns are of the [[Doric order]], with simple capitals, fluted shafts, and no bases. Above the architrave of the entablature is a [[frieze]] of carved pictorial panels ([[Metope (architecture)|metopes]]), separated by formal architectural [[triglyph]]s, typical of the Doric order. Around the cella and across the lintels of the inner columns runs a continuous sculptured [[frieze]] in low relief. This element of the architecture is [[Ionic order|Ionic]] in style rather than Doric.<ref>Banister Fletcher, ''History of architecture on the Comparative Method'', pp. 119\u2013123</ref>\n\nMeasured at the stylobate, the dimensions of the base of the Parthenon are {{convert|69.5|by|30.9|m|ft}}. The cella was 29.8&nbsp;metres long by 19.2&nbsp;metres wide (97.8&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;63.0&nbsp;ft). On the exterior, the Doric columns measure {{convert|1.9|m|ft}} in diameter and are {{convert|10.4|m|ft}} high. The corner columns are slightly larger in diameter. The Parthenon had 46 outer columns and 23 inner columns in total, each column containing 20 flutes. (A flute is the [[wikt:concave|concave]] shaft carved into the column form.) The roof was covered with large overlapping marble tiles known as [[imbrex and tegula|imbrices and tegulae]].<ref>{{cite book|title=American Architect and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIdMAAAAYAAJ|year=1892|publisher=American Architect}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Tegula.html|title=LacusCurtius \u2022 Roman Architecture \u2014 Roof Tiles (Smith's Dictionary, 1875)|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|language=en|access-date=8 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Parthenon is regarded as the finest example of Greek architecture. The temple, wrote [[John Julius Cooper]], \"Enjoys the reputation of being the most perfect Doric temple ever built. Even in antiquity, its architectural refinements were legendary, especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the [[naos (architecture)|naos]] walls and the ''entasis'' of the columns.\"<ref>John Julius Norwich, ''Great Architecture of the World'', 2001, p. 63</ref><!-- If we must have this quote let's at least get it right. --> ''[[Entasis]]'' refers to the slight swelling, of {{convert|4|cm}}, in the center of the columns to counteract the appearance of columns having a waist, as the swelling makes them look straight from a distance. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in many other classical Greek temples,<ref>And in the surviving foundations of the preceding Older Parthenon (Penrose, ''Principles of Athenian Architecture'' 2nd ed. ch. II.3, plate 9).</ref> it has a slight parabolic upward curvature intended to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outward, but they actually lean slightly inward so that if they carried on, they would meet almost exactly {{convert|2400|m|mi}} above the center of the Parthenon<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.architecturerevived.com/how-greek-temples-correct-visual-distortion/ |title = How Greek Temples Correct Visual Distortion \u2013 Architecture Revived}}</ref>. Since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the [[architrave]] and roof above: \"All follow the rule of being built to delicate curves\", Gorham Stevens observed when pointing out that, in addition, the west front was built at a slightly higher level than that of the east front.<ref>Penrose ''op. cit.'' pp. 32\u201334, found the difference motivated by economies of labour; Gorham P.

In this case, the ceiling and floor of the temple may seem to bow in the presence of the surrounding angles of the building. Striving for perfection, the designers may have added these curves, compensating for the illusion by creating their own curves, thus negating this effect and allowing the temple to be seen as they intended. It is also suggested that it was to enliven what might have appeared an inert mass in the case of a building without curves. But the comparison ought to be, according to Smithsonian historian Evan Hadingham, with the Parthenon's more obviously curved predecessors than with a notional rectilinear temple.<ref name=SmithMag>{{Citation|last=Hadingham|first=Evan|year=February 2008|title=Unlocking Mysteries of the Parthenon |publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|location= Washington, DC|page=42}}</ref>\n\nSome studies of the Acropolis, including of the Parthenon and its fa\u00e7ade, have conjectured that many of its proportions approximate the [[golden ratio]].<ref>Van Mersbergen, Audrey M., \"Rhetorical Prototypes in Architecture: Measuring the Acropolis,\" ''Philosophical Polemic Communication Quarterly'', Vol. 46, 1998.</ref> However, such theories have been discredited by more recent studies, which have shown that the proportions of the Parthenon do not match the golden proportion.<ref>{{cite journal|author=George Markowsky|url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf|title=Misconceptions about the Golden Ratio|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=23|issue=1|date=January 1992|access-date=4 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408200850/http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf|archive-date=8 April 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Livio|first=Mario|authorlink=Mario Livio|title=The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, the World's Most Astonishing Number|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUARfgWRH14C|origyear=2002|edition=First trade paperback|year=2003|publisher=[[Random House|Broadway Books]]|location=New York City|isbn=0-7679-0816-3|pages=74\u20135}}</ref>\n\n==Sculpture==\n[[File:British Museum (8375482047).jpg|thumb|Group from the east pediment, [[British Museum]].]]\nThe cella of the Parthenon housed the [[Athena Parthenos|chryselephantine statue of Athena Parthenos]] sculpted by [[Phidias]] and dedicated in 439 or 438&nbsp;BC.

The metopes of the west end show the [[Amazonomachy]] (the mythical battle of the Athenians against the [[Amazons]]). The metopes of the south side show the Thessalian [[Centauromachy]] (battle of the [[Lapiths]] aided by [[Theseus]] against the half-man, half-horse [[Centaur]]s).

According to ''Eleftherotypia'' daily, the archaeologists claimed the metopes had been placed there in the 18th century when the Acropolis wall was being repaired. The experts discovered the metopes while processing 2,250 photos with modern photographic methods, as the white Pentelic [[marble]] they are made of differed from the other stone of the wall. It was previously presumed that the missing metopes were destroyed during the Morosini explosion of the Parthenon in 1687.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2011/03/04/archaeologists-discover-new-metopes-of-parthenon/Discovery|title=Discovery Reveals Ancient Greek Theaters Used Moveable Stages Over 2,000 Years Ago |website=greece.greekreporter.com}}</ref>\n\n\n===Frieze===\n{{Main|Parthenon Frieze}}\n[[File:1868 Lawrence Alma-Tadema - Phidias Showing the Frieze of the Parthenon to his Friends.jpg|thumb|''[[Phidias]] Showing the Frieze of the Parthenon to his Friends'', 1868 painting by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]]]\n\nThe most characteristic feature in the architecture and decoration of the temple is the Ionic [[frieze]] running around the exterior of the cella walls, which is the inside structure of the Parthenon. The bas-relief frieze was carved in situ; it is dated to 442&nbsp;BC-438&nbsp;BC.\n\nOne interpretation is that it depicts an idealized version of the [[Panathenaic Festival|Panathenaic procession]] from the Dipylon Gate in the [[Kerameikos]] to the [[Acropolis]]. In this procession held every year, with a special procession taking place every four years, Athenians and foreigners were participating to honour the goddess [[Athena]], offering sacrifices and a new [[peplos]] (dress woven by selected noble Athenian girls called ''ergastines''). The procession is more crowded (appearing to slow in pace) as it nears the gods on the eastern side of the temple.<ref>{{cite book |last1=De la Croix |first1=Horst |last2=Tansey |first2=Richard G. |last3=Kirkpatrick |first3=Diane |title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages |date=1991 |publisher=Thomson/Wadsworth |isbn=0-15-503769-2 |edition=9th |pp=[https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/158 158\u201359] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/158 }}</ref>\n\n[[Joan Breton Connelly]] offers a mythological interpretation for the frieze, one that is in harmony with the rest of the temple's sculptural programme which shows Athenian genealogy through a series of succession myths set in the remote past. She identifies the central panel above the door of the Parthenon as the pre-battle sacrifice of the daughter of [[King Erechtheus]], a sacrifice that ensured Athenian victory over [[Eumolpos]] and his Thracian army. The great procession marching toward the east end of the Parthenon shows the post-battle thanksgiving sacrifice of cattle and sheep, honey and water, followed by the triumphant army of Erechtheus returning from their victory. This represents the very first Panathenaia set in mythical times, the model on which historic Panathenaic processions was based.<ref>Connelly, ''Parthenon and Parthenoi'', 53\u201380.</ref><ref>Connelly, ''The Parthenon Enigma'', chapters 4, 5, and 7.</ref>\n\n===Pediments===\n{{Main|Pediments of the Parthenon}}\nThe traveller [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], when he visited the Acropolis at the end of the 2nd century AD, only mentioned briefly the sculptures of the [[pediment]]s (gable ends) of the temple, reserving the majority of his description for the gold and ivory statue of the goddess inside.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias1B.html |title=Description of Greece |author=Pausanias |author-link=Pausanias (geographer) |translator-first=W.H.S. |translator-last=Jones |year=1918 |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press |at=Book 1, 24.5}}</ref>\n\n====East pediment====\n[[File:Partenon04.JPG|thumb|Part of the east pediment still found on the Parthenon (although part of it, like Dionysos, is a copy)]]\n\nThe figures on the corners of the pediment depict the passage of time over the course of a full day.

Amongst those early travellers and archaeologists were [[James Stuart (1713\u20131788)|James Stuart]] and [[Nicholas Revett]], who were commissioned by the [[Society of Dilettanti]] to survey the ruins of classical Athens.

In 1801, the British Ambassador at [[Constantinople]], the [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Earl of Elgin]], obtained a questionable ''firman'' (edict) from the [[Sultan]], whose existence or legitimacy has not been proved to this day, to make casts and drawings of the antiquities on the Acropolis, to demolish recent buildings if this was necessary to view the antiquities, and to remove sculptures from them.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Independent Greece===\nWhen independent Greece gained control of Athens in 1832, the visible section of the minaret was demolished; only its base and spiral staircase up to the level of the [[architrave]] remain intact.<ref>{{cite book | last = Murray | first = John | title = Handbook for travellers in Greece, Volume 2 | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1884 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ac4GAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA317 | page = 317}}</ref> Soon all the medieval and Ottoman buildings on the Acropolis were destroyed.

An archaeological committee thoroughly documented every [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] remaining on the site, and architects assisted with [[computer model]]s to determine their original locations. Particularly important and fragile sculptures were transferred to the Acropolis Museum. A crane was installed for moving marble blocks; the crane was designed to fold away beneath the roofline when not in use. In some cases, prior re-constructions were found to be incorrect. These were dismantled, and a careful process of restoration began.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081003065234/http://cipa.icomos.org/fileadmin/papers/Athens2007/FP111.pdf \"The Surface Conservation Project\"] (pdf file). Once they had been conserved, the West Frieze blocks were moved to the museum, and copies cast in artificial stone were reinstalled in their places.</ref> Originally, various blocks were held together by elongated iron '''H''' pins that were completely coated in lead, which protected the iron from corrosion. Stabilizing pins added in the 19th century were not so coated, and corroded.

Originally released on October 24, 1991, by [[Walt Disney Records]], the album's first half \u2013 tracks 2 to 9 \u2013 generally contains the film's [[Number (music)|musical number]]<nowiki/>s, all of which were written by composer [[Alan Menken]] and lyricist [[Howard Ashman]], while its latter half \u2013 tracks 10 to 14 \u2013 features its <nowiki/>[[Film score|musical score]], composed solely by Menken. While the majority of the album's content remains within the [[musical theatre]] genre, its songs have also been influenced by [[Music of France|French]], [[Classical music|classical]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[Broadway musical|Broadway music]]. Credited to Various Artists, ''Beauty and the Beast: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack'' features performances by the film's main cast \u2013 [[Paige O'Hara]], [[Richard White (actor)|Richard White]], [[Jesse Corti]], [[Jerry Orbach]], [[Angela Lansbury]] and [[Robby Benson]] \u2013 in order of appearance. Additionally, the album features recording artists [[Celine Dion]] and [[Peabo Bryson]], who perform a pop rendition of the film's [[theme song|title and theme song]], \"Beauty and the Beast\", which simultaneously serves as the soundtrack's only single.\n\nFollowing a difficult period during where [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] struggled to release successful animated feature films, the studio, inspired by their most recent animated success ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]] ''(1989), decided to adapt the fairy tale \"[[Beauty and the Beast]]\" into an [[Musical film|animated musical film]] after a non-musical adaptation had been attempted that failed to impress [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], the chairman of Walt Disney Studios. Katzenberg ordered that production on the film be started over from scratch, hiring songwriting team Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who had just recently completed scoring ''The Little Mermaid'', to write the film's songs. Dion and Bryson were hired to record a pop version of \u2013 and draw media attention to \u2013 the film's title song. Ashman, who was initially hesitant to join the project, died of [[AIDS]] before the film's completion and the album's release.\n\nMuch like ''Beauty and the Beast'', the soundtrack was a massive critical success, receiving universal praise and recognition from both film and music critics. The music featured on the album won several awards, including the [[49th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], the [[64th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Score]] and the [[35th Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television]]. Its title track and only single, \"[[Beauty and the Beast (Disney song)|Beauty and the Beast]]\", achieved similar success, winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and Grammy Awards for both [[Best song written for visual media|Best Song Written for Visual Media]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]]. The soundtrack was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year.\n\nIn December 2001, the soundtrack was re-released as a ''Special Edition'' to coincide with the [[IMAX]] re-issue of the film and the upcoming two-disc [[Walt Disney Platinum and Diamond Editions#Soundtracks|Platinum Edition]]. The new release featured the film version of \"Transformation\", which had been replaced with an early unused version in some early pressings, the newly animated song \"Human Again\", the original instrumental intended for the \"Transformation\" scene, (titled \"Death of the Beast (Early Version)\" here) and demos for \"Be Our Guest\" and the title track. In September 2010, the soundtrack was re-released again as a [[Walt Disney Platinum and Diamond Editions#Music releases|Diamond Edition]] soundtrack, to coincide with the successful Blu-ray and DVD Diamond Edition release of the film, the 1991 version of the soundtrack was released and included [[Jordin Sparks]]' cover of \"Beauty and the Beast\" as a bonus track. The soundtrack was [[reissue|reissued]] as the fourteenth entry in ''[[Walt Disney Records the Legacy Collection|The Legacy Collection]]'' on February 9, 2018 and includes previously unreleased score.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] struggled to release animated feature films that achieved the levels of success of some of the studio's earlier productions did. In 1989, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] released ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]. ''An [[Musical film|animated musical]] that features songs written by lyricist [[Howard Ashman]] and composer [[Alan Menken]], ''The Little Mermaid'' was both a tremendous critical and commercial success. Hoping to release a film that achieved similar success, the studio decided to adapt the fairy tale \"[[Beauty and the Beast]]\" by [[Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont]] into an animated film.\n\nPrior to getting professionally involved with Disney, Ashman and Menken had collaborated on a [[Little Shop of Horrors (1960 film)|musical adaptation]] of ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' and its subsequent musical [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film adaptation]]. Following the studio's attempt to adapt the fairy tale into a non-musical animated film under the direction of Richard Purdum, Disney CEO [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], dissatisfied by the direction in which the film was headed, ordered that it be scrapped and restarted from scratch, this time in the form of a musical. In addition to hiring a screenwriter, Katzenberg recruited Ashman and Menken to write the film's songs.\n\n===Ashman's health===\nAshman was initially reluctant to agree to work on ''Beauty and the Beast'' because he had just recently been diagnosed with [[AIDS]]. Additionally, he had already begun writing songs for ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]] ''(1992). Ashman's health began deteriorating soon after he completed ''The Little Mermaid''. However, he wanted his illness to remain secret and decided to tell few about it. Too weak to travel, Ashman requested that he be allowed to work on the film's songs from his home, causing Menken and the filmmakers to frequently travel from the film's studio in [[Burbank, California]] to his home in New York in order to collaborate with him. Ashman wrote the majority of the song's lyrics from his deathbed.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/beauty-and-the-plague|title = Beauty and the Plague|website = Vice|publisher = Vice|accessdate = 18 September 2013|last = Sunderland|first = Mitchell}}</ref><ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/03/beauty-and-the-beast-gay-lefou-howard-ashman</ref><ref>https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/16583/don-Hahn-interview-beauty-and-the-beast-howard-Ashman-the-lion-king-south-park-and-frankenweenie</ref>\n\n==Content and composition==\nLyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken intended for the songs in ''Beauty and the Beast'' to serve as [[plot device]]s and assist in the telling of its story.

Originally released on October 24, 1991, by [[Walt Disney Records]], the album's first half \u2013 tracks 2 to 9 \u2013 generally contains the film's [[Number (music)|musical number]]<nowiki/>s, all of which were written by composer [[Alan Menken]] and lyricist [[Howard Ashman]], while its latter half \u2013 tracks 10 to 14 \u2013 features its <nowiki/>[[Film score|musical score]], composed solely by Menken. While the majority of the album's content remains within the [[musical theatre]] genre, its songs have also been influenced by [[Music of France|French]], [[Classical music|classical]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[Broadway musical|Broadway music]]. Credited to Various Artists, ''Beauty and the Beast: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack'' features performances by the film's main cast \u2013 [[Paige O'Hara]], [[Richard White (actor)|Richard White]], [[Jesse Corti]], [[Jerry Orbach]], [[Angela Lansbury]] and [[Robby Benson]] \u2013 in order of appearance. Additionally, the album features recording artists [[Celine Dion]] and [[Peabo Bryson]], who perform a pop rendition of the film's [[theme song|title and theme song]], \"Beauty and the Beast\", which simultaneously serves as the soundtrack's only single.\n\nFollowing a difficult period during where [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] struggled to release successful animated feature films, the studio, inspired by their most recent animated success ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]] ''(1989), decided to adapt the fairy tale \"[[Beauty and the Beast]]\" into an [[Musical film|animated musical film]] after a non-musical adaptation had been attempted that failed to impress [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], the chairman of Walt Disney Studios. Katzenberg ordered that production on the film be started over from scratch, hiring songwriting team Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who had just recently completed scoring ''The Little Mermaid'', to write the film's songs. Dion and Bryson were hired to record a pop version of \u2013 and draw media attention to \u2013 the film's title song. Ashman, who was initially hesitant to join the project, died of [[AIDS]] before the film's completion and the album's release.\n\nMuch like ''Beauty and the Beast'', the soundtrack was a massive critical success, receiving universal praise and recognition from both film and music critics. The music featured on the album won several awards, including the [[49th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], the [[64th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Score]] and the [[35th Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television]]. Its title track and only single, \"[[Beauty and the Beast (Disney song)|Beauty and the Beast]]\", achieved similar success, winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and Grammy Awards for both [[Best song written for visual media|Best Song Written for Visual Media]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]]. The soundtrack was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year.\n\nIn December 2001, the soundtrack was re-released as a ''Special Edition'' to coincide with the [[IMAX]] re-issue of the film and the upcoming two-disc [[Walt Disney Platinum and Diamond Editions#Soundtracks|Platinum Edition]]. The new release featured the film version of \"Transformation\", which had been replaced with an early unused version in some early pressings, the newly animated song \"Human Again\", the original instrumental intended for the \"Transformation\" scene, (titled \"Death of the Beast (Early Version)\" here) and demos for \"Be Our Guest\" and the title track. In September 2010, the soundtrack was re-released again as a [[Walt Disney Platinum and Diamond Editions#Music releases|Diamond Edition]] soundtrack, to coincide with the successful Blu-ray and DVD Diamond Edition release of the film, the 1991 version of the soundtrack was released and included [[Jordin Sparks]]' cover of \"Beauty and the Beast\" as a bonus track. The soundtrack was [[reissue|reissued]] as the fourteenth entry in ''[[Walt Disney Records the Legacy Collection|The Legacy Collection]]'' on February 9, 2018 and includes previously unreleased score.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] struggled to release animated feature films that achieved the levels of success of some of the studio's earlier productions did. In 1989, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] released ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]. ''An [[Musical film|animated musical]] that features songs written by lyricist [[Howard Ashman]] and composer [[Alan Menken]], ''The Little Mermaid'' was both a tremendous critical and commercial success. Hoping to release a film that achieved similar success, the studio decided to adapt the fairy tale \"[[Beauty and the Beast]]\" by [[Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont]] into an animated film.\n\nPrior to getting professionally involved with Disney, Ashman and Menken had collaborated on a [[Little Shop of Horrors (1960 film)|musical adaptation]] of ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' and its subsequent musical [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film adaptation]]. Following the studio's attempt to adapt the fairy tale into a non-musical animated film under the direction of Richard Purdum, Disney CEO [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], dissatisfied by the direction in which the film was headed, ordered that it be scrapped and restarted from scratch, this time in the form of a musical. In addition to hiring a screenwriter, Katzenberg recruited Ashman and Menken to write the film's songs.\n\n===Ashman's health===\nAshman was initially reluctant to agree to work on ''Beauty and the Beast'' because he had just recently been diagnosed with [[AIDS]]. Additionally, he had already begun writing songs for ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]] ''(1992). Ashman's health began deteriorating soon after he completed ''The Little Mermaid''. However, he wanted his illness to remain secret and decided to tell few about it. Too weak to travel, Ashman requested that he be allowed to work on the film's songs from his home, causing Menken and the filmmakers to frequently travel from the film's studio in [[Burbank, California]] to his home in New York in order to collaborate with him. Ashman wrote the majority of the song's lyrics from his deathbed.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/beauty-and-the-plague|title = Beauty and the Plague|website = Vice|publisher = Vice|accessdate = 18 September 2013|last = Sunderland|first = Mitchell}}</ref><ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/03/beauty-and-the-beast-gay-lefou-howard-ashman</ref><ref>https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/16583/don-Hahn-interview-beauty-and-the-beast-howard-Ashman-the-lion-king-south-park-and-frankenweenie</ref>\n\n==Content and composition==\nLyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken intended for the songs in ''Beauty and the Beast'' to serve as [[plot device]]s and assist in the telling of its story.

'''''The Creeping Unknown''''' in the United States) is a 1955 British [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[horror film]] drama from [[Hammer Film Productions]], based on the 1953 [[BBC Television]] serial ''[[The Quatermass Experiment]]'' written by [[Nigel Kneale]]. The film was produced by [[Anthony Hinds]], directed by [[Val Guest]], and stars [[Brian Donlevy]] as the eponymous Professor [[Bernard Quatermass]] and [[Richard Wordsworth]] as the tormented Carroon. [[Jack Warner (actor)|Jack Warner]], [[David King-Wood]], and [[Margia Dean]] appear in co-starring roles.\n\nThe film's storyline concerns three astronauts that have been launched into space aboard a [[single stage to orbit]] rocket. The returning spacecraft, designed by Professor Quatermass, crash lands with only one of its original crew aboard, Victor Carroon (Richard Wordsworth). Something has infected him during the spaceflight, and he begins mutating into an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] organism which, if it spawns, will engulf the Earth and destroy humanity. When the mutating Carroon escapes from custody, Quatermass and [[Scotland Yard]]'s Inspector Lomax (Jack Warner), have just hours to track it down and prevent a catastrophe.\n\nLike its source TV serial, the film was a major success in the UK and brought public attention to Hammer Film Productions' name around the world. The film's US release was as a [[double feature]] with ''[[The Black Sleep]]''.<ref>McGee, Mark Thomas; Robertson, R.J. (2013). \"You Won't Believe Your Eyes\".

Page 254</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe British-American Rocket Group, headed by the taciturn Professor Bernard Quatermass, launches its first manned rocket into outer space. Shortly thereafter, all contact is lost with the rocket and its three-man crew: Carroon, Reichenheim and Green. The large rocket later returns to Earth, crashing into an English country field. Quatermass and his assistant Marsh arrive at the scene. With them are the local emergency services, Carroon's wife Judith, Rocket Group physician Dr. Briscoe and Blake, a Ministry official who chides Quatermass repeatedly for launching the rocket without official permission. The rocket's hatch is finally opened, and the space-suited Carroon stumbles out. There is no sign of the other two crew. Carroon is in shock, only able to say the words, \"Help me\". Inside the rocket, Quatermass and Marsh find only the fastened but completely empty spacesuits of the two missing men.\n\nCarroon is taken to Briscoe's laboratory facility on the grounds that conventional hospitals and doctors would have no idea how to evaluate or treat the world's first returned astronaut, now suffering from some sort of adverse outer space event. Even under Briscoe's attentive care, Carroon remains mute, generally immobile, but alert with eyes that now have a feral and cunning quality. Briscoe discovers an oddly disfigured area on his shoulder and notices changes in his face, suggesting some sort of mutation of the underlying bone structure. Meanwhile, [[Scotland Yard]] Inspector Lomax has undertaken investigation of the other two men's disappearance and, having surreptitiously fingerprinted Carroon as a suspect, alerts Quatermass that the prints are like nothing human.\n\nAt Judith's insistence that Briscoe is not helping her husband, Quatermass agrees to have Carroon transferred to a regular hospital, under guard. Marsh, meanwhile, has developed the film from the rocket's interior view camera, and Quatermass, Lomax and Briscoe watch it. The crew are seen for a time at their duties, then suddenly, something seems to heavily buffet the ship. After that, there is a nightmarish wavering distortion of the cabin's atmosphere, and the men react as if something frightening, yet not visible, is there with them. One by one they collapse, Carroon being the last.\n\nQuatermass and Briscoe determine from the evidence that something living in outer space has entered the spaceship, dissolved Reichenheim and Green in their sealed spacesuits, and evidently entered Carroon's body, who is now in the process of being transformed by this unknown entity. Not knowing any of this, Carroon's wife, Judith, hires a private investigator, Christie, to break her husband out of the secured hospital. The escape is successful, but not before Carroon smashes a potted cactus in his hospital room, which fuses to his flesh. In the lift he kills Chistie and absorbs the life force in his body, leaving a shrivelled husk. Judith quickly discovers what is happening to her husband. Carroon  disappears into the London night, leaving her unharmed, but completely traumatized.\n\nInspector Lomax initiates a manhunt for Carroon, who goes to a nearby [[pharmacy|chemist's shop]] and kills the chemist, using his swollen, crusty, cactus-thorn-riddled hand and arm as a cudgel and leaving a twisted, empty man-husk to be found by the police. Quatermass theorizes that Carroon has taken select chemicals to \"speed up a change going on inside of him\". After hiding on a river barge, Carroon encounters a little girl, leaving her unharmed through sheer force of will. That night he is in the zoo, barely visible amongst some shadowed bushes, now with far less of his human form remaining. In the morning, scattered animal carcusses are found, their life forces having been absorbed, with a slime trail leading away from the zoo. Among the bushes, Quatermass and Briscoe also find a small but living remnant of Carroon, and take it back to their laboratory. Following an examination, Quatermass concludes that some kind of predatory alien life has completely taken over and will eventually release reproduction spores, endangering the entire planet.\n\nThe remnant, having now grown much larger, breaks out of its glass cage, but dies of starvation on the floor. On a police tip from a vagrant, Lomax and his men track the Carroon mutation to [[Westminster Abbey]], where it has crawled high up on a metalwork  scaffolding. It is now a gigantic shapeless mass of combined animal and plant tissue with eyes, distended nodules, and tentacle-like fronds filled with spores. Quatermass arrives and orders London's electrical power centres be combined and the generated power quickly diverted to the Abbey. Heavy duty electrical cable is run and attached to the bottom of the metal scaffolding. The alien creature is cremated by [[electric shock|electrocution]] before it can release its spores.\n\nThe threat eliminated, Quatermass quickly walks out of the Abbey, preoccupied by his thoughts. He ignores all who ask questions. Marsh, his assistant, approaches and asks \"What are you going to do?\" Never breaking stride, Quatermass offhandedly replies, \"I'm going to start again\". He leaves Marsh behind, walking off into the dark, and sometime later a second manned rocketship roars into outer space.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col div}}\n* [[Brian Donlevy]] as [[Bernard Quatermass|Prof. Bernard Quatermass]]\n* [[Richard Wordsworth]] as Victor Carroon\n* [[Jack Warner (actor)|Jack Warner]] as Inspector Lomax\n* [[David King-Wood]] as Dr. Gordon Briscoe\n* [[Margia Dean]] as Mrs. Judith Carroon\n* [[Maurice Kaufmann]] as Marsh\n* [[Harold Lang (actor)|Harold Lang]] as Christie\n* [[Lionel Jeffries]] as Mr. Blake\n* John Wynn as Det.

Among the plot changes are the elimination of the gangster episode. The most significant plot change, however, occurs at the climax of the film. In the television version, Quatermass appeals to the last vestiges of the creature's humanity and convinces it to commit suicide to save the world. In the film Quatermass kills the creature by massive [[electric shock|electrocution]]. Nigel Kneale was critical of the changes made for the film adaptation, and also of the casting of Brian Donlevy, whose brusque interpretation of Quatermass was not to his liking. To make the film's plot convincing to audiences, Guest employed a high degree of [[realism (arts)|realism]], directing the film in a style akin to a [[newsreel]]. The film was shot on location in London, [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], [[Bray, Berkshire|Bray]], and at Hammer's [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]]. Carroon's transformation was effected by makeup artist [[Phil Leakey]], who worked in conjunction with cinematographer [[Walter J. Harvey]] to accentuate Wordsworth's naturally gaunt features to give him an increasingly menacing, yet tragically in-pain, appearance. Special effects, including a model of the fully mutated creature seen at the climax, were provided by [[Les Bowie]]. The music was composed by [[James Bernard (composer)|James Bernard]], the first of many scores he wrote for Hammer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nHammer marketed the film in the United Kingdom by dropping the \"E\" from \"Experiment\" in the title to emphasise the adults-only [[X-rated#United Kingdom|'X' Certificate]] given to the film by the [[British Board of Film Classification|British Board of Film Censors]]. Upon general release in 1955, the film formed one half of the highest grossing [[double bill]] in the UK. It was the first Hammer production to attract the attention of a major US distributor, in this case [[United Artists]], who distributed the film under the title ''The Creeping Unknown''. Its success led to Hammer producing an increasing number of horror films, including two sequels ''[[Quatermass 2]]'' (1957) and ''[[Quatermass and the Pit (film)|Quatermass and the Pit]]'' (1967), making them synonymous with the genre. ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' is regarded as the first of these \"Hammer Horrors\".{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Development===\n''[[The Quatermass Experiment]]'' was originally a six-part TV serial broadcast by [[BBC Television]] in 1953. Written by [[Nigel Kneale]], it was an enormous success with critics and audiences alike, later described by film historian Robert Simpson as \"event television, emptying the streets and pubs\".{{sfn|BBC News Online|1 November 2006}} Among its viewers was [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]] producer [[Anthony Hinds]], who was immediately keen to buy the rights for a film version.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=8}} Incorporated in 1934, Hammer had developed a niche for itself making [[B movie|second features]], many of which were adaptations of successful [[BBC Radio]] productions.{{sfn|Murray|2006|p=43}} Hammer contacted the BBC on 24 August 1953, two days after the transmission of the final episode, to inquire about the film rights.{{sfn|Pixley|2005|p=14}} Nigel Kneale also saw the potential for a film adaptation and, at his urging, the BBC touted the scripts around a number of producers, including the [[Boulting Brothers]] and [[Frank Launder]] and [[Sidney Gilliat]].{{sfn|Murray|2006|p=36}} Kneale met with Sidney Gilliat to discuss the scripts but Gilliat was reluctant to buy the rights as he felt any film adaptation would inevitably receive an [[X-rated#United Kingdom|\u2018X\u2019 Certificate]] from the [[British Board of Film Classification|British Board of Film Censors]] (BBFC),{{sfn|Murray|2006|pp=36\u201337}} restricting admission to persons over the age of sixteen.{{sfn|Brooke|2011}} Hammer was not so reticent, deciding from the outset that they would deliberately pursue an \u2018X\u2019 Certificate.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=9}} Hammer's offer met some resistance within the BBC, with one executive expressing reservations that ''The Quatermass Experiment'' was not suitable material for the company, but the rights were nevertheless sold for an advance of \u00a3500.{{sfn|Hearn|2011|p=9}}\n\nNigel Kneale was a BBC employee at the time, which meant that his scripts were owned entirely by the BBC. He received no extra payment for the sale of the film rights.{{sfn|Murray|2006|p=37}} This became a matter of some resentment on Kneale's part, and when his BBC contract came up for renewal he demanded and secured control over any future film rights for his work.{{sfn|Murray|2006|p=48}} Despite this, Kneale remained bitter over the affair until the BBC made an ''[[ex-gratia]]'' payment of \u00a33,000 to him in 1967, in recognition of his creation of Quatermass.{{sfn|Murray|2006|p=98}}\n\nThe film was [[international co-production|co-produced]] by [[Robert L. Lippert]], an American film producer and distributor.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=9}} Hammer had entered into an arrangement with Lippert in 1951 under which Lippert provided finance and supplied American stars for Hammer's films and distributed them in the United States.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=20}} In return Hammer's distribution arm, Exclusive Films, distributed Lippert's films in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=20}} [[Cinematograph Films Act 1927|Quota laws]] in the UK meant that US films had to have a British supporting feature, so it was in the American studios' interests to fund these features to recover a greater proportion of the box office receipts.{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|p=10}}\n\n===Writing===\nThe first draft of the screenplay was written by Richard Landau, an American who had worked on six previous Hammer productions, including ''[[Spaceways]]'' (1953), one of the company's first forays into science fiction.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=32}} Landau made significant changes in condensing the action to less than half the length of the original teleplay.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=9}} The opening thirty minutes of the television version are covered in just two minutes in the Hammer film.{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=02:26\u201302:45}} In the process Landau played up the horror elements of Kneale's original teleplay.{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|p=66}} Aware that the film would be co-funded by American backers, Landau added a transatlantic dimension to the script: Quatermass's \"British Rocket Group\" became the \"British-American Rocket Group\" and the character of his assistant, Briscoe, was rewritten as a [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] [[flight surgeon]].{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=9}} Quatermass himself was demoted to a doctor and written much more as an action hero than the thoughtful scientist created by Nigel Kneale.{{sfn|Hearn|1999|p=5}} Some characters from the television version, such as the journalist James Fullalove, are omitted altogether.{{sfn|Murray|2006|p=44}} Judith Carroon's role in the film version is reduced to little more than that of the stricken astronaut's anxious wife, whereas in the television version she is also a prominent member of Quatermass's Rocket Group.{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|p=68}} A [[subplot]] involving an extramarital affair between her and Briscoe is also left out of the film version.{{sfn|Warren|1982|p=250}} Kneale was particularly aggravated by the dropping from his original teleplay the notion that Carroon has absorbed not only the bodies but also the memories and the personalities of his two fellow astronauts.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=32}} This change leads to the most significant difference between the two versions: in the television version, Quatermass makes a personal appeal to the last vestiges that remain of the three absorbed astronauts to make the creature commit suicide before it can spore, whereas in the film version Quatermass kills the creature by electrocution.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=10}} Director Val Guest defended this change believing it was \"filmically a better end to the story\".{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=1:14:28\u20131:14:35}} He also felt it unlikely that Brian Donlevy's gruff interpretation of Quatermass would lend itself to talking the creature into submission.{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=1:14:55\u20131:15:12}}\n\nHaving fallen foul of the censors with some of their earlier films, Hammer had an informal agreement to submit scripts in advance of shooting for comment by the BBFC.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=57}} When the draft script for ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' was submitted, Board Secretary Arthur Watkins replied, \"I must warn you at this stage that, while we accept this story in principle for the \u2018X\u2019 category, we could not certificate, even in that category, a film treatment in which the horrific element was so exaggerated as to be nauseating and revolting to adult audiences\".{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=33}} The BBFC were particularly concerned with the violence in the scenes where Carroon escapes from hospital and with how graphic the depiction would be of Caroon's transformation into the alien creature.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=34}}\n\nThe script was refined further by director Val Guest, who cut 30 pages from Landau's script.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=11}} One of Guest's key script contributions was to tailor the dialogue to suit the brusque style of star Brian Donlevy.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=17}} With an American actor cast as Quatermass, Guest reverted Briscoe to a British character and reinstated Quatermass's title of professor.{{sfn|Hearn|1999|p=5}} Guest also adapted some sections of the script in response to the concerns of the BBFC.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=11}} Further stylistic changes were sought by the BBC, who retained a script approval option after the sale of the rights and asked Nigel Kneale  to work on their suggested changes, much to his indignation, .{{sfn|Murray|2006|p=43}} Kneale was tasked with rewriting any scenes featuring BBC announcers to match the BBC's news reporting style.{{sfn|Murray|2006|p=43}}\n\n===Casting===\nIrish-American actor [[Brian Donlevy]] was brought in by Robert L. Lippert to play the title role of Quatermass to provide an interest for American audiences.{{sfn|Meikle|2009|p=18}} Donlevy, in his own words, specialised in \"he-men roles \u2013 rough, tough and realistic\".{{sfn|Schlossheimer|2002|p=170}} Nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for ''[[Beau Geste (1939 film)|Beau Geste]]'' (1939),{{sfn|Schlossheimer|2002|p=165}} he was also known for his appearances in ''[[The Great McGinty]]'' (1940) and ''[[The Glass Key (1942 film)|The Glass Key]]'' (1942).{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|p=68}} At the time he appeared as Quatermass, his career was in decline, however.{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|p=68}} Donlevy's no-nonsense portrayal of Quatermass is very different from that of [[Reginald Tate]] in the television version. It was not to Nigel Kneale's liking, who said, \"I may have picked Quatermass's surname out of a phone book, but his first name was carefully chosen: Bernard, after [[Bernard Lovell]], the creator of [[Jodrell Bank]]. Pioneer, ultimate questing man. Donlevy played him as a mechanic, a creature with a completely closed mind\".{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=7}} Responding to Kneale's criticisms, Val Guest said, \"Nigel Kneale was expecting to find Quatermass like he was on television, a sensitive British scientist, not some American stomping around, but to me Donlevy gave it absolute reality\".{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=35}} By this stage in his career, Donlevy was suffering from alcoholism; it was some weeks into the shoot before Guest became aware that the flask of coffee he always carried on set was laced with brandy.{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=09:14\u201309:55}} Guest found, however, that \"Brian was all right, no problem at all once you kept him sober\".{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=128}} He reprised the role of Quatermass in ''[[Quatermass 2]]'' (1957) but was replaced by [[Andrew Keir]] in the third film, ''[[Quatermass and the Pit (film)|Quatermass and the Pit]]'' (1967).{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|pp=20, 117}}\n\nInspector Lomax was played by [[Jack Warner (actor)|Jack Warner]], who appeared by arrangement with the [[Rank Organisation|J. Arthur Rank Organisation]], with whom he was contracted.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=36}} At the time, he was best known as the star of ''[[Here Come the Huggetts]]'' (1948) and its sequels.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=14}} Shortly after finishing ''The Quatermass Xperiment'', he made his first appearance on television in the role he is most associated with: the title character in ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]'' (1955\u201376).{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=14}} Warner plays Lomax in a lighthearted fashion and there is a [[running gag|running joke]] in the film involving Lomax's futile attempts to find the time to have a shave with his [[Razor#Electric razors|electric razor]].{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=54:27\u201355:03}}\n\n[[Richard Wordsworth]] was cast by Val Guest as the hapless Victor Carroon because \"he had the right sort of face for the part\".{{sfn|Brosnan|1991|p=74}} He was best known at the time for his work in the theatre.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=15}} His performance in ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' is frequently compared with that of [[Boris Karloff]] in ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' (1931).<ref>See, for example, {{harvnb|Baxter|1970|p=96}}; {{harvnb|Warren|1982|p=253}}; {{harvnb|Brosnan|1991|p=74}}.</ref> Guest, aware of the risk of an actor going over the top with the part, directed Wordsworth to \"hold back just a mite of what you're feeling\".{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=40:51\u201341:26}} Summing up Wordsworth's performance, film critic [[Bill Warren (film historian and critic)|Bill Warren]] said, \"All Carroon's anguish and torment are conveyed in one of the best mime performances in horror and science fiction films... A sequence in which he is riding in a car with his wife is uncanny: only the alien is visible for a long moment\".{{sfn|Warren|1982|p=253}} Wordsworth went on to appear in three more Hammer films: ''[[The Camp on Blood Island]]'' (1958), ''[[The Revenge of Frankenstein]]'' (1958), and ''[[The Curse of the Werewolf]]'' (1961).{{sfn|Meikle|2009|pp=229\u2013264}} He remained known predominantly as a stage actor, among other things devising and starring in a [[one-person show]] dedicated to his great-great grandfather, the poet [[William Wordsworth]].{{sfn|Benedick|1993}}\n\nAnother American star provided by Robert L. Lippert was [[Margia Dean]], who played Judith Carroon. A former beauty queen,{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|p=68}} Dean was allegedly cast on account of her association with the 20th Century Fox president, Spyros Skouras.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=20}} According to executive producer [[Michael Carreras]], \"Skouras had a girlfriend who was an actress and he wanted her in pictures, but he didn't want her in pictures in America, because of the tittle-tattle or whatever, so he set it up through his friend Bob Lippert\".{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|p=17}} Val Guest recalled of her, \"She was a sweet girl, but she couldn't act\".{{sfn|Weaver|2003|p=101}} Her American accent was considered out of place in the film, and so her lines were [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] in [[post production]].{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|p=68}}\n\nAmong the other actors that appear in the film are [[Thora Hird]], [[Gordon Jackson (actor)|Gordon Jackson]], [[David King-Wood]], [[Harold Lang (actor)|Harold Lang]], [[Lionel Jeffries]], and [[Sam Kydd]], many of whom appeared regularly in films directed by Val Guest.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p-14}} ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' also saw an early role for [[Jane Asher]], who plays the little girl whom Carroon encounters when he is on the run.{{sfn|Weaver|2003|p=106}}\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Bray Film Studios - geograph.org.uk - 1591972.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Colour photograph of a large white building with a castellated roof surrounded by trees situated in front of a river|Bray Studios, where many of the interior scenes in ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' were filmed.]]\n[[Val Guest]] was hired to direct the film. He began his career co-writing comedies such as ''[[Oh, Mr Porter!]]'' (1937) and ''[[Ask a Policeman]]'' (1939) before moving into directing with ''[[Miss London Ltd.]]'' (1943).{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=127}} His first directing job for Hammer was on ''[[Life with the Lyons]]'' (1954) and he went on to direct their first two colour features: ''[[The Men of Sherwood Forest]]'' (1954) and ''[[Break in the Circle]]'' (1954).{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|p=27}} Guest had little interest in science fiction and was unenthusiastic about directing the film; he reluctantly took copies of Nigel Kneale's television scripts with him on holiday in [[Tangiers]] and only began reading them after being teased for his \"ethereal\" attitude by his wife, [[Yolande Donlan]].{{sfn|Weaver|2003|p=100}} Impressed by what he read and pleased to be offered the opportunity to break away from directing comedy films, he took the job.{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=35:01\u201335:45}} In his approach to directing the film, Guest sought to make \"a slightly wild story more believable\"{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=05:01\u201305:05}} by creating a \"science fact\" film, shot \"as though shooting a special programme for the BBC or something\".{{sfn|Guest|2003|loc=04:00\u201304:29}} Influenced by [[Elia Kazan]]'s ''[[Panic in the Streets (film)|Panic in the Streets]]'' (1950),{{sfn|Weaver|2003|p=103}} Guest employed a [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] style, making extensive use of [[hand-held camera]], even on set, an unusual technique for the time which horrified several of the technicians employed on the film.{{sfn|Guest|2003|loc=04:29\u201304:48}} To inject pace and add further realism into the story, Guest directed his actors to deliver their lines rapid-fire and to overlap the dialogue.{{sfn|Weaver|2003|p=103}} A meticulous planner, he created [[storyboard]]s for every shot and mounted them on a blackboard so as to brief the crew for each day's scenes.{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=59:58\u20131:01:09}} As a consequence, some members of the crew found Guest's approach to be too mechanical.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=309}}\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on 12 October 1954 with a night shoot at [[Chessington Zoo]]{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=34}} and continued from 18 October 1954 into December.{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|p=16}} The budget was \u00a342,000, low even by the standards of Hammer at the time.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=34}} Special effects technician Les Bowie recalled, \"We did ''Quatermass'' on a budget so low it wasn't a real budget. I did it for wages not as a proper effects man who gets allocated a certain budget for a movie\".{{sfn|Brosnan|1991|p=75}} The shots of the emergency services rushing to the rocket crash site at the beginning of the movie were filmed in the village of [[Bray, Berkshire]], where Hammer's studios were located.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=35}} The scenes with the crashed rocket were shot in a corn field at [[Water Oakley]], near Bray.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=35}} It was originally intended to make the crash site look more spectacular by setting fire to the field but bad weather interfered.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=37}} Guest used a [[wide-angle lens]] for these shots to convey a feeling of vastness to the scene.{{sfn|Meikle|2009|p=22}} Carroon's encounter with the little girl was filmed at the [[East India Docks]] in London.{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=51:11\u201352:27}} A [[second unit]], under cameraman [[Len Harris (cinematographer)|Len Harris]], conducted additional location shooting around London for the [[montage (filmmaking)|montage]] scenes of the police search for Carroon.{{sfn|Meikle|2009|p=22}} For the shot of the lights of London going out when the electricity is diverted to Westminster Abbey, an agreement was made with one of the engineers at [[Battersea Power Station]] to turn off the lights illuminating the outside of the station; however the engineer misunderstood and briefly cut all the power along the [[River Thames]].{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=35}} Most of the remaining location shooting was done in the [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] area.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=35}} The rest of the film was shot at Hammer's [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]], with the New Stage there housing the sets for the hospital and the interior of Westminster Abbey.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=43}} Michael Carreras had written to the Abbey seeking permission to film there but was refused.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2002|p=10}} The rooms of Down Place, the former [[English country house|country house]] Bray Studios were built around, were used for other scenes such as Inspector Lomax's office.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=34}} [[Art director]] [[J.

Makeup artist Phil Leakey worked with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to accentuate the shadows around Wordworth's face to give him a skeletal appearance.]]\nThe work of [[makeup artist]] [[Phil Leakey]] in transforming Richard Wordsworth's Carroon into the mutating creature was a key contribution to the effectiveness of the film. Val Guest, Anthony Hinds, and Leakey all agreed that the makeup should make Carroon appear pitiful rather than ugly.{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=146}} Leakey placed a light above the actor in the makeup chair and then worked on accentuating the shadows cast by his eyebrows, nose, chin and cheekbones.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=309}} The makeup was a liquid rubber solution mixed with glycerine to give the impression of sweat.{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=145}} Leakey's job was made easier by Wordsworth's natural high cheekbones and hollow temples and he also worked closely with [[cinematographer]] [[Walter J. Harvey]] to ensure the lighting in each shot emphasised Wordsworth's features.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=309}} Leakey also created Carroon's mutating arm. The hand was created from a cast of the hand of an [[arthritis]] victim, enlarged and exaggerated by Leakey.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=310}} The rest of the arm was built up using latex and rubber and, inside, had a series of plastic tubes through which fluid was pumped to give the effect of the arm swelling.{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=146}} A large sponge-rubber [[prosthetic makeup|prosthetic]] was used for a brief scene in the zoo showing Carroon's mutation had advanced further.{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=146}} The shrivelled corpses of Carroon's victims, glimpsed from time to time in the film, were also made by Leakey.{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|p=75}}\n\n[[Les Bowie]] provided the special effects: he had made his name perfecting an improved technique for [[matte painting]], called the delineating matte, and formed a company with Vic Margutti that specialised in [[matte (filmmaking)|matte effects]].{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|pp=414\u2013415}} Bowie provided a number of matte paintings to enhance the scale of certain key shots in the film, including the crashed rocket, the Westminster Abbey set, and the shot of Quatermass walking away from the Abbey at the climax of the film.{{sfn|Meikle|2009|pp=22\u201323}} Partly because of the concerns raised by the BBFC and partly on account of the low budget, Val Guest kept the creature largely off-screen for much of the film, feeling that audiences' imaginations would fill in the blanks more effectively than he and the special effects team could deliver on-screen.{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=1:01:23\u20131:02:21}} For the climactic scenes at Westminster Abbey, however, Bowie created a monster from [[tripe]] and rubber and photographed it against a model of the Abbey.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=37}} Sparks and fireworks were used for the shots of the creature being electrocuted.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=415}} Michael Carreras felt something was missing when he viewed the first cut of this scene: he said, \"There was this great glob of something hanging about on the scaffolding. And they had put in the best music they could and put the best effects on it, but it meant nothing as far as I was concerned \u2026 absolutely nothing at all\".{{sfn|Meikle|2009|p=24}} An eye was added to the model of the monster and a human scream added to the soundtrack to give the creature some semblance of humanity in its final moments.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=37}} Models were also used for the rocket blasting off in the film's final shot.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=426}}\n\n===Music===\n{{Listen\n| filename    = The Quatermass Xperiment (Sample).ogg\n| title       = Opening Credits (Excerpt)\n| description = The rising and falling three-note semitone that pervades the score.\n| pos         = left\n}}\nJohn Hotchkis was originally hired to compose the music but, when he fell ill, Anthony Hinds asked conductor John Hollingsworth to recommend a replacement.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=404}} Hollingsworth suggested [[James Bernard (composer)|James Bernard]], with whom he had worked on a number of BBC radio productions.{{sfn|Mansell|1999|p=15}} Bernard sent Hinds a tape of the score of one of these productions, an adaptation of ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'', and was duly hired.{{sfn|Huckvale|1999|p=46}} Bernard watched the film a number of times, stopping after each reel to make notes and discuss where the music would be needed.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=404}} Val Guest was not involved in any of the music sessions; Anthony Hinds supervised Bernard and made the final decisions as to where the music should occur.{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=44:03\u201344:36}} Bernard composed the music at his piano and then worked out the orchestration, which was performed by the [[Royal Opera House]] Orchestra.{{sfn|Huckvale|2006|pp=46\u201349}} Hollingsworth restricted the arrangement of the score to just the [[string section|string]] and percussion sections: Bernard recalled, \"I had not written for film before and had only used strings for the BBC scores, so I think that John thought it would be better to see how I got on with these two sections before letting me loose with a full orchestra\".{{sfn|Mansell|1999|p=16}} The score runs to 20 minutes and uses a rising and falling three-note [[semitone]] throughout.{{sfn|Huckvale|2006|pp=49, 53}} Bernard's biographer, David Huckvale, argues that Bernard's use of [[atonality|atonal]] strings to create a sense of menace predates [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), which is usually cited as the first film to employ the technique.{{sfn|Huckvale|2006|p=49}}  Remarking on the effectiveness of the score, the film critic [[John Brosnan]] said, \"Of prime importance, is the contribution of the soundtrack, in this case supplied by James Bernard who never wrote a more unnerving, jangly score\".{{sfn|Brosnan|1991|p=74}} Bernard went on to become Hammer's most prolific composer, scoring 23 Hammer films between 1955 and 1974.{{sfn|Mansell|1999|pp=15\u201316}} Several cues from ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' were released on CD in 1999 by GDI Records on a compilation titled ''The Quatermass Film Music Collection''.{{sfn|Soundtrack Collector|2012}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Cinema release===\n[[File:London-pavilion-facade.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Colour photograph of a neoclassical building with a number of statues on the roof and a decorative fa\u00e7ade consisting of four columns topped by a triangular pediment.

The first part of this particular film is well up to standard. Mr. Brian Donlevy, as the American scientist responsible for the experiment, is a little brusque in his treatment of British institutions but he is clearly a man who knows what he is doing. Mr. Jack Warner, representing [[Scotland Yard]], is indeed a comfort to have at hand when Things are on the rampage\".{{sfn|The Times|29 August 1955}} Positive reviews also came from Peter Burnup in the ''[[News of the World]]'', who found that \"with the added benefit of bluff, boisterous Brian Donlevy... all earnest addicts of science fiction will undoubtedly love every minute of it\",{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=18}} while the reviewer in ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'' praised \"a narrative style that quite neatly combines the horrific and the factual\".{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=18}} ''Today's Cinema'' called it \"one of the best essays in science fiction to date\".{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|p=17}} Film historian Bruce G. Hallenbeck notes a degree of national pride in some of the positive reviews.{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|p=75}} For instance, [[Paul Dehn]] in the ''[[News Chronicle]]'' said, \"This is the best and nastiest horror film I have seen since the War. How jolly that it is also British\"!{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|p=17}} Similarly, William Whitebait in the ''[[New Statesman]]'', who found the film to be \"better than either ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|War of the Worlds]]'' or ''[[Them!]]''\",{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=39}} also called for \"a couple of cheers for the reassurance that British films can still, once in a while, come quick\".{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|pp=18\u201319}}\n\nOn a less positive note, Frank Jackson of ''[[Reynold's News|Reynolds News]]'' quipped \"That TV pseudo-science shocker ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' has been filmed and quitermess they've made of it too\",{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=39}} before slating the film as \"82 minutes of sick-making twaddle\".{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=18}} The horror content of the film was mentioned in several reviews: Patrick Gibbs of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' said the film \"gives the impression that it originated in the strip of some horror comic. It remains very horrid and not quite coherent\",{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=18}} while the reviewer in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' found the film to be \"a real chiller thriller but not for the kids\"{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=18}} and [[Dilys Powell]] of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' found the film \"exciting but distinctly nauseating\".{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=18}} Another unimpressed critic was [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], who wrote in ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'' that \"This one is very, very bad, far from the small pleasure we get, for example, from the innocent science fiction films signed by the American [[Jack Arnold (director)|Jack Arnold]]... The subject could have been turned into a good film, not lacking in spice; with a bit of imagination... None of this is in this sadly English film\".{{sfn|Dixon|1983|pp=79\u201380}}\n\nUpon its release in the United States ''Variety'' praised the film as an \"extravagant piece of science fiction. Despite its obvious horror angles, production is crammed with incident and suspense\".{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|p=75}} According to Hallenbeck, many US critics found Brian Donlevy's gruff Quatermass a breath of fresh air from the earnest hero scientists of American science fiction films, such as [[Gene Barry]]'s character in ''War of the Worlds''.{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|p=75}}\n\nOther US trade reviews were mixed. ''Harrison's Reports'' felt, \"the story is, of course, quite fantastic but it has enough horrific ingredients to go over with those who enjoy scary doings\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Creeping Unknown|url=https://ia800502.us.archive.org/BookReader/BookReaderImages.php?zip=/6/items/harrisonsreports38harr/harrisonsreports38harr_jp2.zip&file=harrisonsreports38harr_jp2/harrisonsreports38harr_0114.jp2&scale=6&rotate=0|website=archive.org|publisher=Harrison's Reports|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref> ''Film Bulletin'' was not impressed. \"Its strong point is an eerie atmosphere . . .  but fails to build the suspense essential in this kind \nof film . . .

Brian Donlevy was stiff but convincing... Much of the film is saved, however, by Richard Wordsworth... one of the finest such performances since Karloff's triumphs of the Thirties\".{{sfn|Baxter|1970|p=96}} This view was echoed by [[John Brosnan]] in ''The Primal Screen'' (1991): \"One of the best of all alien possession movies\",{{sfn|Brosnan|1991|p=72}} he wrote, \"Not since Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's monster has an actor managed to create such a memorable, and sympathetic, monster out of mime alone\".{{sfn|Brosnan|1991|p=74}} Bill Warren in ''Keep Watching The Skies!'' (1982) found that \"the buildup is slightly too long and too careful\"{{sfn|Warren|1982|p=252}} but also said, \"It's an intelligent, taut and well-directed thriller; it showcases Nigel Kneale's ideas well; it's scary and exciting. It was made by people who cared about what they were doing, who were making entertainment for adults. It is still one of the best alien invasion films\".{{sfn|Warren|1982|p=254}} Steve Chibnall, writing for the [[British Film Institute]]'s [[Screenonline]], describes ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' as \"one of the high points of British SF/horror cinema\".{{sfn|Chibnall|2011}} The horror fiction writer [[Stephen King]] praised the film in his non-fiction book ''[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]]'' (1991) as one of his favourite horror movies between 1950 and 1980 .{{sfn|Murray|2006|p=153}} The film director [[John Carpenter]], who later collaborated with Nigel Kneale on the film ''[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch]]'' (1982), has claimed that ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' \"had an enormous, enormous impact on me \u2013 and it continues to be one of my all-time favourite science-fiction movies\".{{sfn|Murray|2006|p=154}}\n\n==Legacy==\nThe success of ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' came at an opportune time for Hammer. By 1955 the deal with Robert L. Lippert had expired and the company produced just one feature film that year, ''[[Women Without Men (1956 film)|Women Without Men]]''.{{sfn|Meikle|2009|p=19}} Many of the independent cinemas that provided the market for Hammer's films in the UK were struggling in the face of competition from television and faced closure.{{sfn|Meikle|2009|p=19}} ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' gave Hammer a much needed box office hit and was also the first film to bring the company to the attention of a major film distributor, in this case United Artists.{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|p=13}} From this point onward, Hammer was increasingly able to deal directly with the major distributors and no longer needed intermediaries like Lippert.{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|p=13}} This ultimately spelt the end for Exclusive Films, Hammer's own distribution company, which was wound down in the late 1950s.{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|p=14}}\n\nHammer quickly sought to capitalise on its good fortune with a sequel. Staff member [[Jimmy Sangster]] pitched a story about a monster emerging from the Earth's core.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=40}} However, when the company asked Nigel Kneale for permission to use the character of Quatermass, he refused, not wanting to lose control of his creation.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=108}} Nevertheless, the film went ahead, as ''[[X the Unknown]]'' (1956), again capitalising on the 'X' Certificate in its title and featuring a newly created scientist character, very much in the Quatermass mould, played by [[Dean Jagger]].{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|pp=18\u201319}} Quatermass did eventually return to cinema screens in ''[[Quatermass 2]]'' (1957) and ''[[Quatermass and the Pit (film)|Quatermass and the Pit]]'' (1967), both of which had screenplays written by Nigel Kneale and based on serials originally written by him and presented by BBC Television.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|pp=108\u2013109}} Rival British film companies also tried to cash in with science fiction films of their own, including ''[[Satellite in the Sky]]'', ''[[The Gamma People]]'' and ''[[Fire Maidens from Outer Space]]'' (all 1956).{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|pp=77\u201378}}\n\n''The Quatermass Xperiment'' was Hammer's first film to be adapted from a television drama.{{sfn|Bould|Butler|Roberts|Vint|2009|p=123}} Market research carried out by the company showed that it was the horror aspect of the film, rather than the science fiction, that most appealed to audiences.{{sfn|Dixon|2010|pp=87\u201388}} Three of the four films Hammer made in 1956 were horror films: ''X the Unknown'', ''Quatermass 2'' and ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]''.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=41}} The enormous success of the latter of these cemented Hammer's reputation for horror and the company became synonymous with the genre.{{sfn|Meikle|2009|p=xiii }} Michael Carreras later said, \"The film that must take all the credit for the whole Hammer series of horror films was really ''The Quatermass Xperiment''\".{{sfn|Meikle|2009|p=1}}\n\n==Home media==\n''The Quatermass Xperiment'' was released in 2003 by DD Video on [[Region 2 DVD]]. It contained a number of extra features including a commentary by director Val Guest and Hammer historian Marcus Hearn, as well as an interview with Val Guest, an original trailer, and a production booklet written by Marcus Hearn and [[Jonathan Rigby]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2004}} A [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] made-on-demand [[DVD-R]], sourced from a [[high-definition video|high-definition]] master, was released in 2011{{sfn|Erickson|2011}} by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]. The film had been previously released on [[VHS]] cassette and [[LaserDisc]].\n\n==In other media==\nThe film was adapted into a 16-page comic strip published in two parts in the March\u2013April 1977 and June 1977 issues of the magazine ''The House of Hammer'' (volume 1, issue #'s 8 and 9, published by General Book Distribution). It was drawn by [[Brian Lewis (illustrator)|Brian Lewis]] from a script by Les Lilley and Ben Aldrich.

'''''The Creeping Unknown''''' in the United States) is a 1955 British [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[horror film]] drama from [[Hammer Film Productions]], based on the 1953 [[BBC Television]] serial ''[[The Quatermass Experiment]]'' written by [[Nigel Kneale]]. The film was produced by [[Anthony Hinds]], directed by [[Val Guest]], and stars [[Brian Donlevy]] as the eponymous Professor [[Bernard Quatermass]] and [[Richard Wordsworth]] as the tormented Carroon. [[Jack Warner (actor)|Jack Warner]], [[David King-Wood]], and [[Margia Dean]] appear in co-starring roles.\n\nThe film's storyline concerns three astronauts that have been launched into space aboard a [[single stage to orbit]] rocket. The returning spacecraft, designed by Professor Quatermass, crash lands with only one of its original crew aboard, Victor Carroon (Richard Wordsworth). Something has infected him during the spaceflight, and he begins mutating into an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] organism which, if it spawns, will engulf the Earth and destroy humanity. When the mutating Carroon escapes from custody, Quatermass and [[Scotland Yard]]'s Inspector Lomax (Jack Warner), have just hours to track it down and prevent a catastrophe.\n\nLike its source TV serial, the film was a major success in the UK and brought public attention to Hammer Film Productions' name around the world. The film's US release was as a [[double feature]] with ''[[The Black Sleep]]''.<ref>McGee, Mark Thomas; Robertson, R.J. (2013). \"You Won't Believe Your Eyes\".

Page 254</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe British-American Rocket Group, headed by the taciturn Professor Bernard Quatermass, launches its first manned rocket into outer space. Shortly thereafter, all contact is lost with the rocket and its three-man crew: Carroon, Reichenheim and Green. The large rocket later returns to Earth, crashing into an English country field. Quatermass and his assistant Marsh arrive at the scene. With them are the local emergency services, Carroon's wife Judith, Rocket Group physician Dr. Briscoe and Blake, a Ministry official who chides Quatermass repeatedly for launching the rocket without official permission. The rocket's hatch is finally opened, and the space-suited Carroon stumbles out. There is no sign of the other two crew. Carroon is in shock, only able to say the words, \"Help me\". Inside the rocket, Quatermass and Marsh find only the fastened but completely empty spacesuits of the two missing men.\n\nCarroon is taken to Briscoe's laboratory facility on the grounds that conventional hospitals and doctors would have no idea how to evaluate or treat the world's first returned astronaut, now suffering from some sort of adverse outer space event. Even under Briscoe's attentive care, Carroon remains mute, generally immobile, but alert with eyes that now have a feral and cunning quality. Briscoe discovers an oddly disfigured area on his shoulder and notices changes in his face, suggesting some sort of mutation of the underlying bone structure. Meanwhile, [[Scotland Yard]] Inspector Lomax has undertaken investigation of the other two men's disappearance and, having surreptitiously fingerprinted Carroon as a suspect, alerts Quatermass that the prints are like nothing human.\n\nAt Judith's insistence that Briscoe is not helping her husband, Quatermass agrees to have Carroon transferred to a regular hospital, under guard. Marsh, meanwhile, has developed the film from the rocket's interior view camera, and Quatermass, Lomax and Briscoe watch it. The crew are seen for a time at their duties, then suddenly, something seems to heavily buffet the ship. After that, there is a nightmarish wavering distortion of the cabin's atmosphere, and the men react as if something frightening, yet not visible, is there with them. One by one they collapse, Carroon being the last.\n\nQuatermass and Briscoe determine from the evidence that something living in outer space has entered the spaceship, dissolved Reichenheim and Green in their sealed spacesuits, and evidently entered Carroon's body, who is now in the process of being transformed by this unknown entity. Not knowing any of this, Carroon's wife, Judith, hires a private investigator, Christie, to break her husband out of the secured hospital. The escape is successful, but not before Carroon smashes a potted cactus in his hospital room, which fuses to his flesh. In the lift he kills Chistie and absorbs the life force in his body, leaving a shrivelled husk. Judith quickly discovers what is happening to her husband. Carroon  disappears into the London night, leaving her unharmed, but completely traumatized.\n\nInspector Lomax initiates a manhunt for Carroon, who goes to a nearby [[pharmacy|chemist's shop]] and kills the chemist, using his swollen, crusty, cactus-thorn-riddled hand and arm as a cudgel and leaving a twisted, empty man-husk to be found by the police. Quatermass theorizes that Carroon has taken select chemicals to \"speed up a change going on inside of him\". After hiding on a river barge, Carroon encounters a little girl, leaving her unharmed through sheer force of will. That night he is in the zoo, barely visible amongst some shadowed bushes, now with far less of his human form remaining. In the morning, scattered animal carcusses are found, their life forces having been absorbed, with a slime trail leading away from the zoo. Among the bushes, Quatermass and Briscoe also find a small but living remnant of Carroon, and take it back to their laboratory. Following an examination, Quatermass concludes that some kind of predatory alien life has completely taken over and will eventually release reproduction spores, endangering the entire planet.\n\nThe remnant, having now grown much larger, breaks out of its glass cage, but dies of starvation on the floor. On a police tip from a vagrant, Lomax and his men track the Carroon mutation to [[Westminster Abbey]], where it has crawled high up on a metalwork  scaffolding. It is now a gigantic shapeless mass of combined animal and plant tissue with eyes, distended nodules, and tentacle-like fronds filled with spores. Quatermass arrives and orders London's electrical power centres be combined and the generated power quickly diverted to the Abbey. Heavy duty electrical cable is run and attached to the bottom of the metal scaffolding. The alien creature is cremated by [[electric shock|electrocution]] before it can release its spores.\n\nThe threat eliminated, Quatermass quickly walks out of the Abbey, preoccupied by his thoughts. He ignores all who ask questions. Marsh, his assistant, approaches and asks \"What are you going to do?\" Never breaking stride, Quatermass offhandedly replies, \"I'm going to start again\". He leaves Marsh behind, walking off into the dark, and sometime later a second manned rocketship roars into outer space.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col div}}\n* [[Brian Donlevy]] as [[Bernard Quatermass|Prof. Bernard Quatermass]]\n* [[Richard Wordsworth]] as Victor Carroon\n* [[Jack Warner (actor)|Jack Warner]] as Inspector Lomax\n* [[David King-Wood]] as Dr. Gordon Briscoe\n* [[Margia Dean]] as Mrs. Judith Carroon\n* [[Maurice Kaufmann]] as Marsh\n* [[Harold Lang (actor)|Harold Lang]] as Christie\n* [[Lionel Jeffries]] as Mr. Blake\n* John Wynn as Det.

Among the plot changes are the elimination of the gangster episode. The most significant plot change, however, occurs at the climax of the film. In the television version, Quatermass appeals to the last vestiges of the creature's humanity and convinces it to commit suicide to save the world. In the film Quatermass kills the creature by massive [[electric shock|electrocution]]. Nigel Kneale was critical of the changes made for the film adaptation, and also of the casting of Brian Donlevy, whose brusque interpretation of Quatermass was not to his liking. To make the film's plot convincing to audiences, Guest employed a high degree of [[realism (arts)|realism]], directing the film in a style akin to a [[newsreel]]. The film was shot on location in London, [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], [[Bray, Berkshire|Bray]], and at Hammer's [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]]. Carroon's transformation was effected by makeup artist [[Phil Leakey]], who worked in conjunction with cinematographer [[Walter J. Harvey]] to accentuate Wordsworth's naturally gaunt features to give him an increasingly menacing, yet tragically in-pain, appearance. Special effects, including a model of the fully mutated creature seen at the climax, were provided by [[Les Bowie]]. The music was composed by [[James Bernard (composer)|James Bernard]], the first of many scores he wrote for Hammer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nHammer marketed the film in the United Kingdom by dropping the \"E\" from \"Experiment\" in the title to emphasise the adults-only [[X-rated#United Kingdom|'X' Certificate]] given to the film by the [[British Board of Film Classification|British Board of Film Censors]]. Upon general release in 1955, the film formed one half of the highest grossing [[double bill]] in the UK. It was the first Hammer production to attract the attention of a major US distributor, in this case [[United Artists]], who distributed the film under the title ''The Creeping Unknown''. Its success led to Hammer producing an increasing number of horror films, including two sequels ''[[Quatermass 2]]'' (1957) and ''[[Quatermass and the Pit (film)|Quatermass and the Pit]]'' (1967), making them synonymous with the genre. ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' is regarded as the first of these \"Hammer Horrors\".{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Development===\n''[[The Quatermass Experiment]]'' was originally a six-part TV serial broadcast by [[BBC Television]] in 1953. Written by [[Nigel Kneale]], it was an enormous success with critics and audiences alike, later described by film historian Robert Simpson as \"event television, emptying the streets and pubs\".{{sfn|BBC News Online|1 November 2006}} Among its viewers was [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]] producer [[Anthony Hinds]], who was immediately keen to buy the rights for a film version.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=8}} Incorporated in 1934, Hammer had developed a niche for itself making [[B movie|second features]], many of which were adaptations of successful [[BBC Radio]] productions.{{sfn|Murray|2006|p=43}} Hammer contacted the BBC on 24 August 1953, two days after the transmission of the final episode, to inquire about the film rights.{{sfn|Pixley|2005|p=14}} Nigel Kneale also saw the potential for a film adaptation and, at his urging, the BBC touted the scripts around a number of producers, including the [[Boulting Brothers]] and [[Frank Launder]] and [[Sidney Gilliat]].{{sfn|Murray|2006|p=36}} Kneale met with Sidney Gilliat to discuss the scripts but Gilliat was reluctant to buy the rights as he felt any film adaptation would inevitably receive an [[X-rated#United Kingdom|\u2018X\u2019 Certificate]] from the [[British Board of Film Classification|British Board of Film Censors]] (BBFC),{{sfn|Murray|2006|pp=36\u201337}} restricting admission to persons over the age of sixteen.{{sfn|Brooke|2011}} Hammer was not so reticent, deciding from the outset that they would deliberately pursue an \u2018X\u2019 Certificate.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=9}} Hammer's offer met some resistance within the BBC, with one executive expressing reservations that ''The Quatermass Experiment'' was not suitable material for the company, but the rights were nevertheless sold for an advance of \u00a3500.{{sfn|Hearn|2011|p=9}}\n\nNigel Kneale was a BBC employee at the time, which meant that his scripts were owned entirely by the BBC. He received no extra payment for the sale of the film rights.{{sfn|Murray|2006|p=37}} This became a matter of some resentment on Kneale's part, and when his BBC contract came up for renewal he demanded and secured control over any future film rights for his work.{{sfn|Murray|2006|p=48}} Despite this, Kneale remained bitter over the affair until the BBC made an ''[[ex-gratia]]'' payment of \u00a33,000 to him in 1967, in recognition of his creation of Quatermass.{{sfn|Murray|2006|p=98}}\n\nThe film was [[international co-production|co-produced]] by [[Robert L. Lippert]], an American film producer and distributor.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=9}} Hammer had entered into an arrangement with Lippert in 1951 under which Lippert provided finance and supplied American stars for Hammer's films and distributed them in the United States.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=20}} In return Hammer's distribution arm, Exclusive Films, distributed Lippert's films in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=20}} [[Cinematograph Films Act 1927|Quota laws]] in the UK meant that US films had to have a British supporting feature, so it was in the American studios' interests to fund these features to recover a greater proportion of the box office receipts.{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|p=10}}\n\n===Writing===\nThe first draft of the screenplay was written by Richard Landau, an American who had worked on six previous Hammer productions, including ''[[Spaceways]]'' (1953), one of the company's first forays into science fiction.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=32}} Landau made significant changes in condensing the action to less than half the length of the original teleplay.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=9}} The opening thirty minutes of the television version are covered in just two minutes in the Hammer film.{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=02:26\u201302:45}} In the process Landau played up the horror elements of Kneale's original teleplay.{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|p=66}} Aware that the film would be co-funded by American backers, Landau added a transatlantic dimension to the script: Quatermass's \"British Rocket Group\" became the \"British-American Rocket Group\" and the character of his assistant, Briscoe, was rewritten as a [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] [[flight surgeon]].{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=9}} Quatermass himself was demoted to a doctor and written much more as an action hero than the thoughtful scientist created by Nigel Kneale.{{sfn|Hearn|1999|p=5}} Some characters from the television version, such as the journalist James Fullalove, are omitted altogether.{{sfn|Murray|2006|p=44}} Judith Carroon's role in the film version is reduced to little more than that of the stricken astronaut's anxious wife, whereas in the television version she is also a prominent member of Quatermass's Rocket Group.{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|p=68}} A [[subplot]] involving an extramarital affair between her and Briscoe is also left out of the film version.{{sfn|Warren|1982|p=250}} Kneale was particularly aggravated by the dropping from his original teleplay the notion that Carroon has absorbed not only the bodies but also the memories and the personalities of his two fellow astronauts.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=32}} This change leads to the most significant difference between the two versions: in the television version, Quatermass makes a personal appeal to the last vestiges that remain of the three absorbed astronauts to make the creature commit suicide before it can spore, whereas in the film version Quatermass kills the creature by electrocution.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=10}} Director Val Guest defended this change believing it was \"filmically a better end to the story\".{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=1:14:28\u20131:14:35}} He also felt it unlikely that Brian Donlevy's gruff interpretation of Quatermass would lend itself to talking the creature into submission.{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=1:14:55\u20131:15:12}}\n\nHaving fallen foul of the censors with some of their earlier films, Hammer had an informal agreement to submit scripts in advance of shooting for comment by the BBFC.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=57}} When the draft script for ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' was submitted, Board Secretary Arthur Watkins replied, \"I must warn you at this stage that, while we accept this story in principle for the \u2018X\u2019 category, we could not certificate, even in that category, a film treatment in which the horrific element was so exaggerated as to be nauseating and revolting to adult audiences\".{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=33}} The BBFC were particularly concerned with the violence in the scenes where Carroon escapes from hospital and with how graphic the depiction would be of Caroon's transformation into the alien creature.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=34}}\n\nThe script was refined further by director Val Guest, who cut 30 pages from Landau's script.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=11}} One of Guest's key script contributions was to tailor the dialogue to suit the brusque style of star Brian Donlevy.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=17}} With an American actor cast as Quatermass, Guest reverted Briscoe to a British character and reinstated Quatermass's title of professor.{{sfn|Hearn|1999|p=5}} Guest also adapted some sections of the script in response to the concerns of the BBFC.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=11}} Further stylistic changes were sought by the BBC, who retained a script approval option after the sale of the rights and asked Nigel Kneale  to work on their suggested changes, much to his indignation,

[[Brian Donlevy]] was brought in by Robert L. Lippert to play the title role of Quatermass to provide an interest for American audiences.{{sfn|Meikle|2009|p=18}} Donlevy, in his own words, specialised in \"he-men roles \u2013 rough, tough and realistic\".{{sfn|Schlossheimer|2002|p=170}} Nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for ''[[Beau Geste (1939 film)|Beau Geste]]'' (1939),{{sfn|Schlossheimer|2002|p=165}} he was also known for his appearances in ''[[The Great McGinty]]'' (1940) and ''[[The Glass Key (1942 film)|The Glass Key]]'' (1942).{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|p=68}} At the time he appeared as Quatermass, his career was in decline, however.{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|p=68}} Donlevy's no-nonsense portrayal of Quatermass is very different from that of [[Reginald Tate]] in the television version. It was not to Nigel Kneale's liking, who said, \"I may have picked Quatermass's surname out of a phone book, but his first name was carefully chosen: Bernard, after [[Bernard Lovell]], the creator of [[Jodrell Bank]]. Pioneer, ultimate questing man. Donlevy played him as a mechanic, a creature with a completely closed mind\".{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=7}} Responding to Kneale's criticisms, Val Guest said, \"Nigel Kneale was expecting to find Quatermass like he was on television, a sensitive British scientist, not some American stomping around, but to me Donlevy gave it absolute reality\".{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=35}} By this stage in his career, Donlevy was suffering from alcoholism; it was some weeks into the shoot before Guest became aware that the flask of coffee he always carried on set was laced with brandy.{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=09:14\u201309:55}} Guest found, however, that \"Brian was all right, no problem at all once you kept him sober\".{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=128}} He reprised the role of Quatermass in ''[[Quatermass 2]]'' (1957) but was replaced by [[Andrew Keir]] in the third film, ''[[Quatermass and the Pit (film)|Quatermass and the Pit]]'' (1967).{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|pp=20, 117}}\n\nInspector Lomax was played by [[Jack Warner (actor)|Jack Warner]], who appeared by arrangement with the [[Rank Organisation|J. Arthur Rank Organisation]], with whom he was contracted.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=36}} At the time, he was best known as the star of ''[[Here Come the Huggetts]]'' (1948) and its sequels.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=14}} Shortly after finishing ''The Quatermass Xperiment'', he made his first appearance on television in the role he is most associated with: the title character in ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]'' (1955\u201376).{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=14}} Warner plays Lomax in a lighthearted fashion and there is a [[running gag|running joke]] in the film involving Lomax's futile attempts to find the time to have a shave with his [[Razor#Electric razors|electric razor]].{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=54:27\u201355:03}}\n\n[[Richard Wordsworth]] was cast by Val Guest as the hapless Victor Carroon because \"he had the right sort of face for the part\".{{sfn|Brosnan|1991|p=74}} He was best known at the time for his work in the theatre.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p=15}} His performance in ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' is frequently compared with that of [[Boris Karloff]] in ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' (1931).<ref>See, for example, {{harvnb|Baxter|1970|p=96}}; {{harvnb|Warren|1982|p=253}}; {{harvnb|Brosnan|1991|p=74}}.</ref> Guest, aware of the risk of an actor going over the top with the part, directed Wordsworth to \"hold back just a mite of what you're feeling\".{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=40:51\u201341:26}} Summing up Wordsworth's performance, film critic [[Bill Warren (film historian and critic)|Bill Warren]] said, \"All Carroon's anguish and torment are conveyed in one of the best mime performances in horror and science fiction films... A sequence in which he is riding in a car with his wife is uncanny: only the alien is visible for a long moment\".{{sfn|Warren|1982|p=253}} Wordsworth went on to appear in three more Hammer films: ''[[The Camp on Blood Island]]'' (1958), ''[[The Revenge of Frankenstein]]'' (1958), and ''[[The Curse of the Werewolf]]'' (1961).{{sfn|Meikle|2009|pp=229\u2013264}} He remained known predominantly as a stage actor, among other things devising and starring in a [[one-person show]] dedicated to his great-great grandfather, the poet [[William Wordsworth]].{{sfn|Benedick|1993}}\n\nAnother American star provided by Robert L. Lippert was [[Margia Dean]], who played Judith Carroon. A former beauty queen,{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|p=68}} Dean was allegedly cast on account of her association with the 20th Century Fox president, Spyros Skouras.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=20}} According to executive producer [[Michael Carreras]], \"Skouras had a girlfriend who was an actress and he wanted her in pictures, but he didn't want her in pictures in America, because of the tittle-tattle or whatever, so he set it up through his friend Bob Lippert\".{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|p=17}} Val Guest recalled of her, \"She was a sweet girl, but she couldn't act\".{{sfn|Weaver|2003|p=101}} Her American accent was considered out of place in the film, and so her lines were [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] in [[post production]].{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|p=68}}\n\nAmong the other actors that appear in the film are [[Thora Hird]], [[Gordon Jackson (actor)|Gordon Jackson]], [[David King-Wood]], [[Harold Lang (actor)|Harold Lang]], [[Lionel Jeffries]], and [[Sam Kydd]], many of whom appeared regularly in films directed by Val Guest.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2003|p-14}} ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' also saw an early role for [[Jane Asher]], who plays the little girl whom Carroon encounters when he is on the run.{{sfn|Weaver|2003|p=106}}\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Bray Film Studios - geograph.org.uk - 1591972.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Colour photograph of a large white building with a castellated roof surrounded by trees situated in front of a river|Bray Studios, where many of the interior scenes in ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' were filmed.]]\n[[Val Guest]] was hired to direct the film.

I did it for wages not as a proper effects man who gets allocated a certain budget for a movie\".{{sfn|Brosnan|1991|p=75}} The shots of the emergency services rushing to the rocket crash site at the beginning of the movie were filmed in the village of [[Bray, Berkshire]], where Hammer's studios were located.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=35}} The scenes with the crashed rocket were shot in a corn field at [[Water Oakley]], near Bray.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=35}} It was originally intended to make the crash site look more spectacular by setting fire to the field but bad weather interfered.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=37}} Guest used a [[wide-angle lens]] for these shots to convey a feeling of vastness to the scene.{{sfn|Meikle|2009|p=22}} Carroon's encounter with the little girl was filmed at the [[East India Docks]] in London.{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=51:11\u201352:27}} A [[second unit]], under cameraman [[Len Harris (cinematographer)|Len Harris]], conducted additional location shooting around London for the [[montage (filmmaking)|montage]] scenes of the police search for Carroon.{{sfn|Meikle|2009|p=22}} For the shot of the lights of London going out when the electricity is diverted to Westminster Abbey, an agreement was made with one of the engineers at [[Battersea Power Station]] to turn off the lights illuminating the outside of the station; however the engineer misunderstood and briefly cut all the power along the [[River Thames]].{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=35}} Most of the remaining location shooting was done in the [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] area.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=35}} The rest of the film was shot at Hammer's [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]], with the New Stage there housing the sets for the hospital and the interior of Westminster Abbey.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=43}} Michael Carreras had written to the Abbey seeking permission to film there but was refused.{{sfn|Hearn|Rigby|2002|p=10}} The rooms of Down Place, the former [[English country house|country house]] Bray Studios were built around, were used for other scenes such as Inspector Lomax's office.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=34}} [[Art director]] [[J.

Makeup artist Phil Leakey worked with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to accentuate the shadows around Wordworth's face to give him a skeletal appearance.]]\nThe work of [[makeup artist]] [[Phil Leakey]] in transforming Richard Wordsworth's Carroon into the mutating creature was a key contribution to the effectiveness of the film. Val Guest, Anthony Hinds, and Leakey all agreed that the makeup should make Carroon appear pitiful rather than ugly.{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=146}} Leakey placed a light above the actor in the makeup chair and then worked on accentuating the shadows cast by his eyebrows, nose, chin and cheekbones.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=309}} The makeup was a liquid rubber solution mixed with glycerine to give the impression of sweat.{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=145}} Leakey's job was made easier by Wordsworth's natural high cheekbones and hollow temples and he also worked closely with [[cinematographer]] [[Walter J. Harvey]] to ensure the lighting in each shot emphasised Wordsworth's features.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=309}} Leakey also created Carroon's mutating arm. The hand was created from a cast of the hand of an [[arthritis]] victim, enlarged and exaggerated by Leakey.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=310}} The rest of the arm was built up using latex and rubber and, inside, had a series of plastic tubes through which fluid was pumped to give the effect of the arm swelling.{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=146}} A large sponge-rubber [[prosthetic makeup|prosthetic]] was used for a brief scene in the zoo showing Carroon's mutation had advanced further.{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=146}} The shrivelled corpses of Carroon's victims, glimpsed from time to time in the film, were also made by Leakey.{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|p=75}}\n\n[[Les Bowie]] provided the special effects: he had made his name perfecting an improved technique for [[matte painting]], called the delineating matte, and formed a company with Vic Margutti that specialised in [[matte (filmmaking)|matte effects]].{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|pp=414\u2013415}} Bowie provided a number of matte paintings to enhance the scale of certain key shots in the film, including the crashed rocket, the Westminster Abbey set, and the shot of Quatermass walking away from the Abbey at the climax of the film.{{sfn|Meikle|2009|pp=22\u201323}} Partly because of the concerns raised by the BBFC and partly on account of the low budget, Val Guest kept the creature largely off-screen for much of the film, feeling that audiences' imaginations would fill in the blanks more effectively than he and the special effects team could deliver on-screen.{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=1:01:23\u20131:02:21}} For the climactic scenes at Westminster Abbey, however, Bowie created a monster from [[tripe]] and rubber and photographed it against a model of the Abbey.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=37}} Sparks and fireworks were used for the shots of the creature being electrocuted.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=415}} Michael Carreras felt something was missing when he viewed the first cut of this scene: he said, \"There was this great glob of something hanging about on the scaffolding. And they had put in the best music they could and put the best effects on it, but it meant nothing as far as I was concerned \u2026 absolutely nothing at all\".{{sfn|Meikle|2009|p=24}} An eye was added to the model of the monster and a human scream added to the soundtrack to give the creature some semblance of humanity in its final moments.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=37}} Models were also used for the rocket blasting off in the film's final shot.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=426}}\n\n===Music===\n{{Listen\n| filename    = The Quatermass Xperiment (Sample).ogg\n| title       = Opening Credits (Excerpt)\n| description = The rising and falling three-note semitone that pervades the score.\n| pos         = left\n}}\nJohn Hotchkis was originally hired to compose the music but, when he fell ill, Anthony Hinds asked conductor John Hollingsworth to recommend a replacement.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=404}} Hollingsworth suggested [[James Bernard (composer)|James Bernard]], with whom he had worked on a number of BBC radio productions.{{sfn|Mansell|1999|p=15}} Bernard sent Hinds a tape of the score of one of these productions, an adaptation of ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'', and was duly hired.{{sfn|Huckvale|1999|p=46}} Bernard watched the film a number of times, stopping after each reel to make notes and discuss where the music would be needed.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=404}} Val Guest was not involved in any of the music sessions; Anthony Hinds supervised Bernard and made the final decisions as to where the music should occur.{{sfn|Guest|Hearn|2003|loc=44:03\u201344:36}} Bernard composed the music at his piano and then worked out the orchestration, which was performed by the [[Royal Opera House]] Orchestra.{{sfn|Huckvale|2006|pp=46\u201349}} Hollingsworth restricted the arrangement of the score to just the [[string section|string]] and percussion sections: Bernard recalled, \"I had not written for film before and had only used strings for the BBC scores, so I think that John thought it would be better to see how I got on with these two sections before letting me loose with a full orchestra\".{{sfn|Mansell|1999|p=16}} The score runs to 20 minutes and uses a rising and falling three-note [[semitone]] throughout.{{sfn|Huckvale|2006|pp=49, 53}} Bernard's biographer, David Huckvale, argues that Bernard's use of [[atonality|atonal]] strings to create a sense of menace predates [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), which is usually cited as the first film to employ the technique.{{sfn|Huckvale|2006|p=49}}  Remarking on the effectiveness of the score, the film critic [[John Brosnan]] said, \"Of prime importance, is the contribution of the soundtrack, in this case supplied by James Bernard who never wrote a more unnerving, jangly score\".{{sfn|Brosnan|1991|p=74}} Bernard went on to become Hammer's most prolific composer, scoring 23 Hammer films between 1955 and 1974.{{sfn|Mansell|1999|pp=15\u201316}} Several cues from ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' were released on CD in 1999 by GDI Records on a compilation titled ''The Quatermass Film Music Collection''.{{sfn|Soundtrack Collector|2012}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Cinema release===\n[[File:London-pavilion-facade.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Colour photograph of a neoclassical building with a number of statues on the roof and a decorative fa\u00e7ade consisting of four columns topped by a triangular pediment.

''Harrison's Reports'' felt, \"the story is, of course, quite fantastic but it has enough horrific ingredients to go over with those who enjoy scary doings\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Creeping Unknown|url=https://ia800502.us.archive.org/BookReader/BookReaderImages.php?zip=/6/items/harrisonsreports38harr/harrisonsreports38harr_jp2.zip&file=harrisonsreports38harr_jp2/harrisonsreports38harr_0114.jp2&scale=6&rotate=0|website=archive.org|publisher=Harrison's Reports|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref> ''Film Bulletin'' was not impressed. \"Its strong point is an eerie atmosphere . . .  but fails to build the suspense essential in this kind \nof film . . .

Brian Donlevy was stiff but convincing... Much of the film is saved, however, by Richard Wordsworth... one of the finest such performances since Karloff's triumphs of the Thirties\".{{sfn|Baxter|1970|p=96}} This view was echoed by [[John Brosnan]] in ''The Primal Screen'' (1991): \"One of the best of all alien possession movies\",{{sfn|Brosnan|1991|p=72}} he wrote, \"Not since Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's monster has an actor managed to create such a memorable, and sympathetic, monster out of mime alone\".{{sfn|Brosnan|1991|p=74}} Bill Warren in ''Keep Watching The Skies!'' (1982) found that \"the buildup is slightly too long and too careful\"{{sfn|Warren|1982|p=252}} but also said, \"It's an intelligent, taut and well-directed thriller; it showcases Nigel Kneale's ideas well; it's scary and exciting. It was made by people who cared about what they were doing, who were making entertainment for adults. It is still one of the best alien invasion films\".{{sfn|Warren|1982|p=254}} Steve Chibnall, writing for the [[British Film Institute]]'s [[Screenonline]], describes ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' as \"one of the high points of British SF/horror cinema\".{{sfn|Chibnall|2011}} The horror fiction writer [[Stephen King]] praised the film in his non-fiction book ''[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]]'' (1991) as one of his favourite horror movies between 1950 and 1980 .{{sfn|Murray|2006|p=153}} The film director [[John Carpenter]], who later collaborated with Nigel Kneale on the film ''[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch]]'' (1982), has claimed that ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' \"had an enormous, enormous impact on me \u2013 and it continues to be one of my all-time favourite science-fiction movies\".{{sfn|Murray|2006|p=154}}\n\n==Legacy==\nThe success of ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' came at an opportune time for Hammer. By 1955 the deal with Robert L. Lippert had expired and the company produced just one feature film that year, ''[[Women Without Men (1956 film)|Women Without Men]]''.{{sfn|Meikle|2009|p=19}} Many of the independent cinemas that provided the market for Hammer's films in the UK were struggling in the face of competition from television and faced closure.{{sfn|Meikle|2009|p=19}} ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' gave Hammer a much needed box office hit and was also the first film to bring the company to the attention of a major film distributor, in this case United Artists.{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|p=13}} From this point onward, Hammer was increasingly able to deal directly with the major distributors and no longer needed intermediaries like Lippert.{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|p=13}} This ultimately spelt the end for Exclusive Films, Hammer's own distribution company, which was wound down in the late 1950s.{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|p=14}}\n\nHammer quickly sought to capitalise on its good fortune with a sequel. Staff member [[Jimmy Sangster]] pitched a story about a monster emerging from the Earth's core.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=40}} However, when the company asked Nigel Kneale for permission to use the character of Quatermass, he refused, not wanting to lose control of his creation.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|p=108}} Nevertheless, the film went ahead, as ''[[X the Unknown]]'' (1956), again capitalising on the 'X' Certificate in its title and featuring a newly created scientist character, very much in the Quatermass mould, played by [[Dean Jagger]].{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|pp=18\u201319}} Quatermass did eventually return to cinema screens in ''[[Quatermass 2]]'' (1957) and ''[[Quatermass and the Pit (film)|Quatermass and the Pit]]'' (1967), both of which had screenplays written by Nigel Kneale and based on serials originally written by him and presented by BBC Television.{{sfn|Kinsey|2010|pp=108\u2013109}} Rival British film companies also tried to cash in with science fiction films of their own, including ''[[Satellite in the Sky]]'', ''[[The Gamma People]]'' and ''[[Fire Maidens from Outer Space]]'' (all 1956).{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|pp=77\u201378}}\n\n''The Quatermass Xperiment'' was Hammer's first film to be adapted from a television drama.{{sfn|Bould|Butler|Roberts|Vint|2009|p=123}} Market research carried out by the company showed that it was the horror aspect of the film, rather than the science fiction, that most appealed to audiences.{{sfn|Dixon|2010|pp=87\u201388}} Three of the four films Hammer made in 1956 were horror films: ''X the Unknown'', ''Quatermass 2'' and ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]''.{{sfn|Kinsey|2002|p=41}} The enormous success of the latter of these cemented Hammer's reputation for horror and the company became synonymous with the genre.{{sfn|Meikle|2009|p=xiii }} Michael Carreras later said, \"The film that must take all the credit for the whole Hammer series of horror films was really ''The Quatermass Xperiment''\".{{sfn|Meikle|2009|p=1}}\n\n==Home media==\n''The Quatermass Xperiment'' was released in 2003 by DD Video on [[Region 2 DVD]]. It contained a number of extra features including a commentary by director Val Guest and Hammer historian Marcus Hearn, as well as an interview with Val Guest, an original trailer, and a production booklet written by Marcus Hearn and [[Jonathan Rigby]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2004}} A [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] made-on-demand [[DVD-R]], sourced from a [[high-definition video|high-definition]] master, was released in 2011{{sfn|Erickson|2011}} by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]. The film had been previously released on [[VHS]] cassette and [[LaserDisc]].\n\n==In other media==\nThe film was adapted into a 16-page comic strip published in two parts in the March\u2013April 1977 and June 1977 issues of the magazine ''The House of Hammer'' (volume 1, issue #'s 8 and 9, published by General Book Distribution). It was drawn by [[Brian Lewis (illustrator)|Brian Lewis]] from a script by Les Lilley and Ben Aldrich. The cover of issue 9 featured a painting by Lewis of Professor Quatermass.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n====Books====\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bansak |first=Edmund G. |title=Fearing The Dark: The Val Lewton Career |year=2003 |publisher=McFarland |location=[[Jefferson, North Carolina]] |isbn=978-0-7864-1709-4 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Baxter |first=John |authorlink=John Baxter (author) |title=Science Fiction in the Cinema |url=https://archive.org/details/sciencefictionin0000baxt |url-access=registration |year=1970 |publisher=The Tantivy Press/A.S.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations?

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.
