It is known from [[Fossil|fossils]] collected in the [[Gres superieurs Formation|Gr\u00e8s sup\u00e9rieurs Formation]] of the [[Savannakhet Basin]], the first of which were found in 2010, and comprised a partial skeleton without the skull or limbs. This specimen became the [[holotype]] of the new genus and [[species]] '''''Ichthyovenator laosensis''''', and was described by [[palaeontologist]] Ronan Allain and colleagues in [[2012 in archosaur paleontology|2012]]. The generic name, meaning \"fish hunter\", refers to its assumed [[piscivorous]] lifestyle, while the specific name alludes to the country of Laos. In 2014, it was announced that further remains from the dig site had been recovered; these fossils included teeth as well as more [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#vertebrae|vertebrae]] (backbones) and a [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubis|pubic bone]] from the same individual.\n\nThe holotype specimen is estimated to have been between {{convert|8.5 to 10.5|m|ft|sp=|abbr=}} long and weighed {{convert|2 to 2.4|t|short ton|abbr=}}. ''Ichthyovenator''{{'}}s teeth were straight and conical, and its neck resembled that of the closely related ''[[Sigilmassasaurus]]''. Like others in its family, ''Ichthyovenator'' had tall [[neural spines]] forming a [[Neural spine sail|sail]] on its back. Unlike other known spinosaurids, ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s sail had a [[sinusoidal]] (wave-like) shape, curving downwards over the hips into two separate sails. The [[pelvic girdle]] was reduced, with the length ratio between the main body of the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pelvis|pelvis]] and the pubes and [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#ischium|ischia]] being higher than in any other known theropod dinosaurs. The animal was initially thought to belong to the [[Baryonychinae]] [[subfamily]], but more recent analyses place it as a primitive member in the [[Spinosaurinae]].\n\nAs a spinosaur, ''Ichthyovenator'' would have had a long, shallow snout and robust forelimbs. Its diet likely consisted mainly of aquatic prey (hence its etymology). Spinosaurids are also known to have eaten small dinosaurs and [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] in addition to fish. ''Ichthyovenator''{{'}}s conspicuous sail might have been used for [[sexual display]] or [[species recognition]]. Fossil evidence suggests that spinosaurids, especially spinosaurines, were adapted for [[semiaquatic]] lifestyles. The vertebral spines of ''Ichthyovenator''{{'}}s tail were unusually tall, suggesting that\u2014as in today's [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]]\u2014the tail may have aided in swimming. ''Ichthyovenator'' lived alongside [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] and [[Ornithopoda|ornithopod]] dinosaurs, as well as [[Bivalvia|bivalves]], fish and turtles.\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_skeletal_%26_size_comparison_by_PaleoGeek.png|thumb|left|alt=Drawing of fossil rib, backbones and pelvis superimposed on silhouette of a dinosaur|Skeletal diagram with [[holotype]] elements in place, excluding the additional [[fossil]] material announced in 2014]]\n\nThe first [[fossil|fossils]] of ''Ichthyovenator'' were found in 2010 at [[Ban Kalum]], in the [[Gres superieurs Formation|Gr\u00e8s sup\u00e9rieurs Formation]] of the [[Savannakhet Basin]] in [[Savannakhet Province]], Laos. These bones were recovered from a [[red sandstone]] layer, within a surface area of less than {{convert|2|m|ftin|sp=|abbr=}} squared. Designated under the specimen numbers MDS BK10-01 to 15, it consists of a partly [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#articulation|articulated]], well preserved skeleton lacking the skull and limbs, and including the third to last [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#dorsals|dorsal]] (back) [[vertebra]], the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#neural spine|neural spine]] of the last dorsal vertebra, five partial [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#sacrals|sacral]] (hip) vertebrae, the first two [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#caudals|caudal]] (tail) vertebrae, both [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#ilium|ilia]] (main hip bone), a right [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubis|pubis]] (pubic bone), both [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#ischium|ischia]] (lower and rearmost hip bones) and a posterior dorsal [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#ribs|rib]].

The first dorsal vertebra had extensive [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#transverse processes|transverse processes]] (wing-like projections that articulate with the ribs), as well as deep air pockets at the front and back of its base. The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#parapophyses|parapophysis]] (a process that articulated with the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#capitulum|capitulum]] of the ribs) of the first dorsal increased in height, with its underside remaining in contact with the front lower edge of the centrum.

This condition, which differs from the tapered, pointed tips seen in the ribs of other known theropods, suggests that the rearmost dorsal ribs articulated with the complex of the [[sternum]] (breast bone).<ref name=\"AXRK12\" />\n\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_laosensis_65849.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Cast fossil spinal column laid out inside a glass display case at a museum|Casts of the [[Vertebra|vertebrae]] at the [[Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle|Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle]], Paris|alt=|left]]\n\nLike many other spinosaurids, ''Ichthyovenator'' had a [[Neural spine sail|sail]] on its back and hips, formed by the elongated [[neural spines]] of its vertebrae. Uniquely among known members of the family however, ''Ichthyovenator''{{'}}s sail was divided in two over the hip, and had a [[sinusoid]] (wave-like) curvature. This is in contrast to the related genera ''[[Spinosaurus]]'' and ''Suchomimus'' (both of which had continuous sails that rose to a peak before sloping down again), and B''aryonyx'' (which showed a less developed sail, having much lower dorsal spines). ''Ichthyovenator''{{'}}s preserved dorsal and sacral [[spinal column]], over {{Convert|1|m||abbr=on}} long, shows a very high spine on the twelfth dorsal vertebra, representing a crest that rose from the back, and a lower rounded sail that extended from the sacral vertebrae of the hips, with its highest point above the third and fourth sacrals. The {{Convert|54.6|cm||adj=on}} high spine of the twelfth dorsal vertebra widened towards the top, giving it a [[Trapezoid|trapezoidal]] shape, whereas the spines of other spinosaurids were roughly rectangular. It also lacked the forward or backward inclination of ''Spinosaurus''{{'}}s neural spines. Its front corner formed a {{Convert|3|cm||adj=on|abbr=on}} narrow process, pointing upwards. The spine of the thirteenth dorsal vertebra has only been partly preserved, its upper and lower ends having broken off. From its general shape the describers inferred however, that it was about as long as the preceding spine. This would imply that the back edge of the front sail would form a rectangular corner, as the spine of the much lower first sacral vertebra is about {{Convert|21|cm||abbr=on}}, creating a sudden hiatus in the profile of the sail. The spine of the second sacral vertebra steeply curved upwards again, joining the {{Convert|39|cm||adj=on|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|48|cm||adj=on|abbr=on}} high broad fan-shaped spines of the third and fourth sacrals. The {{Convert|40|cm||adj=on|abbr=on}} tall spine of the fifth sacral gradually descended. Unlike in most other theropods, including the sail of ''Suchomimus'', the sacral spines were not fused, nor did they have any extensive contacts. The second and third sacral centra were [[co-ossified]] (fused), with the [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]] connecting them still visible. Since only the rearmost two dorsal vertebrae are preserved, it is unknown how far the dorsal sail continued towards the front of the animal's back.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" />\n\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_laosensis_by_PaleoGeek.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour life reconstruction of a left-facing spinosaur|Speculative life [[Paleoart|restoration]], with unknown regions such as the head and limbs based on relatives]]\n\nThe sacral sail was continued by the spines of the first two caudal vertebrae, which were {{Convert|28.4|cm||adj=|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|25.7|cm||adj=|abbr=on}} tall respectively. They leaned backwards at a 30 degree angle, and had smooth front and rear edges. The centra of the first two caudals were much broader than long and [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#amphicoelous|amphicoelous]] (deeply concave on both ends). The caudal transverse processes were prominent, sturdy, and angled upwards towards the rear of the vertebrae. The transverse processes of the first caudal vertebra, when seen from above, had a [[Sigmoid function|sigmoid]] (or S-shaped) profile. The prespinal and postspinal fossae (bony depressions in front and behind the neural spines) were confined to above the base of the neural spines. The sides of the first caudal were also deeply hollowed out between the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#Prezygapophyses|prezygapophyses]] (articular surfaces with the neural arch of the preceding vertebra) and the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#diapophyses|diapophyses]] (processes on the sides for rib articulation), a condition not observed in other theropods.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" /> Some of the caudal vertebrae also had unusually tall, forwardly-extended prezygapophyses.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nThe {{Convert|92|cm||adj=on|abbr=on}} ilium of the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pelvis|pelvis]] was blade-like, and longer in proportion to the pubic bone, which was {{Convert|65|cm||adj=|abbr=on}} long, than in any other known large theropod. The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#postacetabular process|postacetabular ala]] (front expansion) was much longer than the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#preacetabular process|preacetabular ala]] (rear expansion), the latter had a shelf on its central surface, which formed the middle edge of the preacetabular fossa. Viewed distally (from away from the centre of attachment), the lower end of the pubis was L-shaped, resembling that of ''Baryonyx''. The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubic apron|pubic apron]] (the expanded lower end of the pubis) features a large [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubic foramen|pubic foramen]]. On the hind rim of the pubic bone, two openings, the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#obturator%20foramen|obturator foramen]] and a lower [[fenestra]] (opening), were not fully closed, making them into notches. The ischium was {{Convert|49.6|cm|in|adj=|abbr=on}} long, making it shorter in relation to the pubis than in all other known [[Tetanurae|tetanuran]] theropods. Its main body was large and extensive, atypical of the Y-shaped upper ischia of other tetanurans, and bore an oval-shaped obturator foramen in its side. The shaft of the ischium was flattened sideways, and had an unexpanded [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#ischiadic apron|ischiadic apron]] (as in ''[[Monolophosaurus]]'' and ''[[Sinraptor]]'').<ref name=\"AXRK12\" /> The ischium attached to the illium via a peg-and-socket-like articulation, unlike the flat and concave condition seen in ''Baryonyx''.

The describers established the following [[autapomorphies]] (unique derived traits) in ''Ichthyovenator'': its dorsal and sacral sinusoidal sail; the thirteenth dorsal neural spine being 410% the length of the centrum, and having a distinct finger-shaped process on its front upper corner; the broad, expanded tips of the third and fourth sacral spines; the first caudal vertebra's deep prezygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossae and S-shaped transverse processes in top view; and the lengthy illium, with its accompanying pubis being shorter in comparison to it than in any other known theropod. Allain and colleagues also identified some anatomical features unique among tetanuran theropods, including the rearmost dorsal ribs articulating with the sternal complex, the pubis's main body having obturator and pubic openings, and the ischium having a foramen on its upper end, as well as a shaft that was flatenned sideways. The shrinking of the pubis and ischium relative to the pelvis has been observed in basal [[Coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]] and [[Allosauroidea|allosauroids]], which the describers attributed to [[mosaic evolution]]: the evolution of certain anatomical traits at different times in separate species.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" /> \n\n[[File:Spinosauridae_\"Sails\"_Comparison_by_PaleoGeek.png|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Three pairs of illustrated fossil pelvic bones and spinal columns compared to the silhouette of a human to their left, Ichthyovenator's pelvis and vertebrae first from the bottom|Comparison of the [[pelvic region]] and [[Neural spine sail|neural spine sails]] of ''[[Suchomimus]]'', ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', and ''Ichthyovenator'']]\n\nIn 2014, Allain's abstract instead found that ''Ichthyovenator'' was part of the subfamily [[Spinosaurinae]], due to the lack of serrations on its teeth and the possession of vertebrae with some similarities to those of ''Sigilmassasaurus''.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 2015, a [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analysis by Evers and colleagues suggested that given the apparent presence of both baryonychine and spinosaurine characteristics in ''Ichthyovenator'', the distinction between the two subfamilies may not be as clear as previously thought.<ref name=\":1\" /> Mortimer hypothesized in 2017 that ''Ichthyovenator'' may not have been a spinosaurid at all, instead possibly being a sail-backed [[Carcharodontosauridae|carcharodontosaurid]] dinosaur closely related to ''[[Concavenator]]''.

It is known from [[Fossil|fossils]] collected in the [[Gres superieurs Formation|Gr\u00e8s sup\u00e9rieurs Formation]] of the [[Savannakhet Basin]], the first of which were found in 2010, and comprised a partial skeleton without the skull or limbs. This specimen became the [[holotype]] of the new genus and [[species]] '''''Ichthyovenator laosensis''''', and was described by [[palaeontologist]] Ronan Allain and colleagues in [[2012 in archosaur paleontology|2012]]. The generic name, meaning \"fish hunter\", refers to its assumed [[piscivorous]] lifestyle, while the specific name alludes to the country of Laos. In 2014, it was announced that further remains from the dig site had been recovered; these fossils included teeth as well as more [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#vertebrae|vertebrae]] (backbones) and a [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubis|pubic bone]] from the same individual.\n\nThe holotype specimen is estimated to have been between {{convert|8.5 to 10.5|m|ft|sp=|abbr=}} long and weighed {{convert|2 to 2.4|t|short ton|abbr=}}. ''Ichthyovenator''{{'}}s teeth were straight and conical, and its neck resembled that of the closely related ''[[Sigilmassasaurus]]''. Like others in its family, ''Ichthyovenator'' had tall [[neural spines]] forming a [[Neural spine sail|sail]] on its back. Unlike other known spinosaurids, ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s sail had a [[sinusoidal]] (wave-like) shape, curving downwards over the hips into two separate sails. The [[pelvic girdle]] was reduced, with the length ratio between the main body of the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pelvis|pelvis]] and the pubes and [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#ischium|ischia]] being higher than in any other known theropod dinosaurs. The animal was initially thought to belong to the [[Baryonychinae]] [[subfamily]], but more recent analyses place it as a primitive member in the [[Spinosaurinae]].\n\nAs a spinosaur, ''Ichthyovenator'' would have had a long, shallow snout and robust forelimbs. Its diet likely consisted mainly of aquatic prey (hence its etymology). Spinosaurids are also known to have eaten small dinosaurs and [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] in addition to fish. ''Ichthyovenator''{{'}}s conspicuous sail might have been used for [[sexual display]] or [[species recognition]]. Fossil evidence suggests that spinosaurids, especially spinosaurines, were adapted for [[semiaquatic]] lifestyles. The vertebral spines of ''Ichthyovenator''{{'}}s tail were unusually tall, suggesting that\u2014as in today's [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]]\u2014the tail may have aided in swimming. ''Ichthyovenator'' lived alongside [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] and [[Ornithopoda|ornithopod]] dinosaurs, as well as [[Bivalvia|bivalves]], fish and turtles.\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_skeletal_%26_size_comparison_by_PaleoGeek.png|thumb|left|alt=Drawing of fossil rib, backbones and pelvis superimposed on silhouette of a dinosaur|Skeletal diagram with [[holotype]] elements in place, excluding the additional [[fossil]] material announced in 2014]]\n\nThe first [[fossil|fossils]] of ''Ichthyovenator'' were found in 2010 at [[Ban Kalum]], in the [[Gres superieurs Formation|Gr\u00e8s sup\u00e9rieurs Formation]] of the [[Savannakhet Basin]] in [[Savannakhet Province]], Laos.

This condition, which differs from the tapered, pointed tips seen in the ribs of other known theropods, suggests that the rearmost dorsal ribs articulated with the complex of the [[sternum]] (breast bone).<ref name=\"AXRK12\" />\n\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_laosensis_65849.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Cast fossil spinal column laid out inside a glass display case at a museum|Casts of the [[Vertebra|vertebrae]] at the [[Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle|Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle]], Paris|alt=|left]]\n\nLike many other spinosaurids, ''Ichthyovenator'' had a [[Neural spine sail|sail]] on its back and hips, formed by the elongated [[neural spines]] of its vertebrae. Uniquely among known members of the family however, ''Ichthyovenator''{{'}}s sail was divided in two over the hip, and had a [[sinusoid]] (wave-like) curvature. This is in contrast to the related genera ''[[Spinosaurus]]'' and ''Suchomimus'' (both of which had continuous sails that rose to a peak before sloping down again), and B''aryonyx'' (which showed a less developed sail, having much lower dorsal spines). ''Ichthyovenator''{{'}}s preserved dorsal and sacral [[spinal column]], over {{Convert|1|m||abbr=on}} long, shows a very high spine on the twelfth dorsal vertebra, representing a crest that rose from the back, and a lower rounded sail that extended from the sacral vertebrae of the hips, with its highest point above the third and fourth sacrals. The {{Convert|54.6|cm||adj=on}} high spine of the twelfth dorsal vertebra widened towards the top, giving it a [[Trapezoid|trapezoidal]] shape, whereas the spines of other spinosaurids were roughly rectangular. It also lacked the forward or backward inclination of ''Spinosaurus''{{'}}s neural spines. Its front corner formed a {{Convert|3|cm||adj=on|abbr=on}} narrow process, pointing upwards. The spine of the thirteenth dorsal vertebra has only been partly preserved, its upper and lower ends having broken off. From its general shape the describers inferred however, that it was about as long as the preceding spine. This would imply that the back edge of the front sail would form a rectangular corner, as the spine of the much lower first sacral vertebra is about {{Convert|21|cm||abbr=on}}, creating a sudden hiatus in the profile of the sail. The spine of the second sacral vertebra steeply curved upwards again, joining the {{Convert|39|cm||adj=on|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|48|cm||adj=on|abbr=on}} high broad fan-shaped spines of the third and fourth sacrals. The {{Convert|40|cm||adj=on|abbr=on}} tall spine of the fifth sacral gradually descended. Unlike in most other theropods, including the sail of ''Suchomimus'', the sacral spines were not fused, nor did they have any extensive contacts. The second and third sacral centra were [[co-ossified]] (fused), with the [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]] connecting them still visible. Since only the rearmost two dorsal vertebrae are preserved, it is unknown how far the dorsal sail continued towards the front of the animal's back.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" />\n\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_laosensis_by_PaleoGeek.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour life reconstruction of a left-facing spinosaur|Speculative life [[Paleoart|restoration]], with unknown regions such as the head and limbs based on relatives]]\n\nThe sacral sail was continued by the spines of the first two caudal vertebrae, which were {{Convert|28.4|cm||adj=|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|25.7|cm||adj=|abbr=on}} tall respectively. They leaned backwards at a 30 degree angle, and had smooth front and rear edges. The centra of the first two caudals were much broader than long and [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#amphicoelous|amphicoelous]] (deeply concave on both ends). The caudal transverse processes were prominent, sturdy, and angled upwards towards the rear of the vertebrae. The transverse processes of the first caudal vertebra, when seen from above, had a [[Sigmoid function|sigmoid]] (or S-shaped) profile. The prespinal and postspinal fossae (bony depressions in front and behind the neural spines) were confined to above the base of the neural spines. The sides of the first caudal were also deeply hollowed out between the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#Prezygapophyses|prezygapophyses]] (articular surfaces with the neural arch of the preceding vertebra) and the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#diapophyses|diapophyses]] (processes on the sides for rib articulation), a condition not observed in other theropods.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" /> Some of the caudal vertebrae also had unusually tall, forwardly-extended prezygapophyses.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nThe {{Convert|92|cm||adj=on|abbr=on}} ilium of the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pelvis|pelvis]] was blade-like, and longer in proportion to the pubic bone, which was {{Convert|65|cm||adj=|abbr=on}} long, than in any other known large theropod. The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#postacetabular process|postacetabular ala]] (front expansion) was much longer than the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#preacetabular process|preacetabular ala]] (rear expansion), the latter had a shelf on its central surface, which formed the middle edge of the preacetabular fossa. Viewed distally (from away from the centre of attachment), the lower end of the pubis was L-shaped, resembling that of ''Baryonyx''. The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubic apron|pubic apron]] (the expanded lower end of the pubis) features a large [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubic foramen|pubic foramen]]. On the hind rim of the pubic bone, two openings, the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#obturator%20foramen|obturator foramen]] and a lower [[fenestra]] (opening), were not fully closed, making them into notches. The ischium was {{Convert|49.6|cm|in|adj=|abbr=on}} long, making it shorter in relation to the pubis than in all other known [[Tetanurae|tetanuran]] theropods. Its main body was large and extensive, atypical of the Y-shaped upper ischia of other tetanurans, and bore an oval-shaped obturator foramen in its side.

The describers established the following [[autapomorphies]] (unique derived traits) in ''Ichthyovenator'': its dorsal and sacral sinusoidal sail; the thirteenth dorsal neural spine being 410% the length of the centrum, and having a distinct finger-shaped [[Process (anatomy)|process]] on its front upper corner; the broad, expanded tips of the third and fourth sacral spines; the first caudal vertebra's deep prezygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossae and S-shaped transverse processes in top view; and the lengthy illium, with its accompanying pubis being shorter in comparison to it than in any other known theropod. Allain and colleagues also identified some anatomical features unique among tetanuran theropods, including the rearmost dorsal ribs articulating with the sternal complex, the pubis's main body having obturator and pubic openings, and the ischium having a foramen on its upper end, as well as a shaft that was flatenned sideways. The shrinking of the pubis and ischium relative to the pelvis has been observed in basal [[Coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]] and [[Allosauroidea|allosauroids]], which the describers attributed to [[mosaic evolution]]: the evolution of certain anatomical traits at different times in separate species.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" /> \n\n[[File:Spinosauridae_\"Sails\"_Comparison_by_PaleoGeek.png|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Three pairs of illustrated fossil pelvic bones and spinal columns compared to the silhouette of a human to their left, Ichthyovenator's pelvis and vertebrae first from the bottom|Comparison of the [[pelvic region]] and [[Neural spine sail|neural spine sails]] of ''[[Suchomimus]]'', ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', and ''Ichthyovenator'']]\n\nIn 2014, Allain's abstract instead found that ''Ichthyovenator'' was part of the subfamily [[Spinosaurinae]], due to the lack of serrations on its teeth and the possession of vertebrae with some similarities to those of ''Sigilmassasaurus''.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 2015, a [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analysis by Evers and colleagues suggested that given the apparent presence of both baryonychine and spinosaurine characteristics in ''Ichthyovenator'', the distinction between the two subfamilies may not be as clear as previously thought.<ref name=\":1\" /> Mortimer hypothesized in 2017 that ''Ichthyovenator'' may not have been a spinosaurid at all, instead possibly being a sail-backed [[Carcharodontosauridae|carcharodontosaurid]] dinosaur closely related to ''[[Concavenator]]''.

{"title_page": "Feminist performance art", "text_new": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\nAccording to scholar Virginia Mackenny, [[performance art]] is a great tool to mold and remold gender because performance art, in most instances, includes a direct subversion to everyday conventions. MacKenny also writes that feminist performance Art had a large presence \u201cin the late '60s and early '70s in America when, in the climate of protest constituted by the civil rights movement and [[second wave feminism]].\" There are several movements that fall under the category of feminist performance art, including Feminist Postmodernism, which took place during 1960-1970 and focused on the exploitation of women's bodies as a means for profit. Similarly, the Chicanx movement emerged in East Los Angeles during the 1970s, and focused on the Vietnam war, which was considered a post-apartheid movement.<ref name=\"MacKenny\">{{cite journal|last1=MacKenny|first1=Virginia|title=Post - Apartheid Performance Art as a Site of Gender Resistance|journal=Agenda Empowering Women for Gender Equity|date=2001|volume=49|pages=15\u201324|issn=1013-0950}}</ref>\n\n== Feminist Postmodernism ==\nAs Forte writes in her analysis of feminist performance art in the 1960s and 1970s, \u201cWithin this movement, women's performance emerges as a specific strategy that allies [[postmodernism]] and [[feminism]] \u2026 women used performance as a deconstructive strategy to demonstrate the objectification of women and its results\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=Jeanie|title=Women's Performance Art: Feminism and Postmodernism|journal=Theatre Journal|date=1988|volume=40.2|issn=0192-2882}}</ref> Another strategy that was commonly used by feminist performance artists during the postmodernist movement was \u201cremoving of the mask,\u201d which was utilized to demonstrate the consequences of female representations in the media, on the psyche of women. MacKenny also writes about the removing of the mask within Feminist Postmodernism. She writes, \u201cThis 'masquerade' or 'masking' occurs when women play with their assigned gender roles in multiple, often contradictory ways - adopting, adapting, overlaying and subverting the hegemonic discourse in the process.\u201d\n\n== Chicanx Movement ==\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s in East Los Angeles, protests broke out against the [[Vietnam War]] and its disproportionate death rate of 22% Chicanx people, while the percentage of the population that Chicanx people made up only 5% of the United States entire population.\n[[Asco (art collective)]], based in [[East Los Angeles, California|East LA]] commented on the impacts of the war on [[queer]] and brown identities, as well as the tragedies that occurred in the protests discussed above due to [[police brutality]]. The collective created visual and performative art. Some of their most famous performances experiment with gender roles, for example, one male identifying artist attended a club wearing \u201cbooty shorts, pink platforms, and a shirt that said \u2018just turned 21.\u2019\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perez|first1=Laura E.|title=Chicana art: the politics of spiritual and aesthetic altarities|date=2007|publisher=Durham: Duke U|isbn=978-0-8223-8988-0|doi=10.1215/9780822389880}}</ref>\nThe group continued to make performance and visual art that engaged with concepts related to queer and [[ethnic identity]] in East LA. During this period, East LA was ghettoized through a border of highways and dilapidated conditions.\n\n== Post Apartheid Movement ==\nMacKenny writes about two of the major players in the Post [[Apartheid]] performance art movement in [[South Africa]]. She first writes about Carol Anne Gainer and her performance entitled 'Exposed.' MacKenny explains that Gainer disrupts and subverts the binary as she performs as both the model and artist in this performance, which works to blur the \"distinction between artist/art, artist/model, constructor/constructed, finder/found, mind/body, subject/object.\"\nThe second artist which Mackenny writes about is a [[mixed race]] artist who performs a piece called 'Span.' MacKenny asserts that the artist Tracey Rose, alludes to Western societies exploitation of people of colour in scientific study and analysis, and the \"dissection and embalming of body parts of native 'others' (the most pertinent to the South African context being Saartje Baartman, a young Khoisan woman displayed for her unique genitalia and steatopygia, or enlarged buttocks),\" through her own display of her body.<ref name=\"MacKenny\"/> Her performance exposes her naked body and is contrasted against images of \"scientific\" exploitation, which both highlights the dichotomy between these subjects and engages with Mackenny's definition of post-apartheid performance art and its political aim to blur and disrupt binary structures.\n\n=== Anti War Performance Art Movement ===\nThe sociologist Rachel V Kutz-Flamenbaum writes about two major players in the anti-war performance art movement during the George W Bush administration. Code Pink, and Raging Grannies challenge and subvert gender norms in their performances, and thus, use very similar tactics and strategies. For instance, in Code Pink, Kutz-Flamenbaum asserts that, \"the emphasis on women\u2019s role as pacifist caregivers presents a nonthreatening image of women activists.\" \n\nThe perpetuated concept of women as non threatening, relies on the audiences association of pink as a non threatening and feminized colour. Kutz-Flamenbaum argues that \"Code Pink\u2019s use of civil disobedience and aggressive trailing of public officials confound and challenge normative gender expectations of women as passive, polite, and well-behaved.\"(95)<ref name=\"Kutz-Flamenbaum\">{{cite journal|last1=Kutz-Flamenbaum|first1=Rachel V|title=Code Pink, Raging Grannies, and the Missile Dick Chicks: Feminist Performance Activism in the Contemporary Anti-War Movement|journal=NWSA Journal|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=90\u201396|issn=1040-0656}}</ref>\nKutz-Flamenbaum claims that [[Raging Grannies]] similarly use this tactic in the description of their mission statement. Kutz-Flamenbaum explains that their mission statement \"illustrates the way Raging Grannies use norm- embracing stereotypes of 'little old ladies' and 'grannies' to challenge the gendered assumptions of their audiences.\" Their conscious performance as non-threatening and nurturing women, strategically and tactfully confront issues related to war and challenge the participation of the George W Bush administration in the war. \n\n== Performance Artists ==\n\n==[[Yoko Ono]]==\n\n=== Overview ===\nOno belonged to a generation of early feminist performance artists but is unique among them for her international fame as [[John Lennon]]\u2019s wife in the late 60s and 70s.  During their courtship the couple manipulated the press attention directed on them by documenting their relationship through performance art.<ref name=\":0\">Elizabeth Ann Lindau. \u201cMother Superior\u201d: Maternity and Creativity in the Work of Yoko Ono.\" ''Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture'' 20 (University of Nebraska Press: 2016), 64.</ref> As Ono stated in a 1986 TV interview, \u201cwe were always together\u2026 we exchanged very fully between ourselves.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">''Yoko Ono on John Lennon's Assasination, Their Son Sean and Influencing The Beatles Breakup.'', ''YouTube'' (YouTube, 2017), <nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suj8MCysBKQ</nowiki>)</ref> They emphasized this unusual situation, where the husband and wife worked together rather than the pair working separately outside the home, through their performance art \u201cBed-ins.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs an interracial couple they also challenged racial stereotypes. She confessed, \u201cI think it was a big lesson for the world that we were together\u2026 And I think it might have helped too for people to understand what it means to confront the interracial couple.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nParenthood is a factor in the controversy surrounding Ono. Women were not usually part of performance art or rock music, and mothers in particular were antithetical to everything rock stood for. The public idea of rock music as youthful male rebellion placed mothers as the opponent. When Ono and Lennon began their relationship, Beatles fans saw this female influence as an intrusion and the force that broke up their favorite band. However, as Ono saw it, the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] grew apart naturally and she was not the primary cause.<ref name=\":1\" /> Public confusion was exacerbated with Ono\u2019s pregnancy. While pregnant with their son Sean, Ono announced to Lennon: \u201cI am carrying the baby nine months and that is enough. You take care of it afterwards.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> After Sean\u2019s birth, she ran the couple\u2019s business while Lennon stayed home as \u201chousehusband.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Ono\u2019s hands off approach to parenting is a source of controversy because she was simultaneously too motherly and not motherly enough.\n\n=== Work ===\nOne of her early works is [[Cut Piece]], first performed in 1964 at the Yamaichi Concert Hall in Kyoto. She kneeled on the stage in her best suit and invited audience members to use scissors to cut it off of her. Confronting issues of gender, class and cultural identity, Ono sat silently until the piece concluded at her discretion.<ref>Munroe, Alexandra; Ono, Yoko; Hendricks, Jon; Altshuler, Bruce; Ross, David A.; Wenner, Jann S.; Concannon, Kevin C.; Tomii, Reiko; Sayle, Murray; Gomez, Edward M.

The book reads like an instruction manual for the reader to create their own versions of her pieces either physically or in the imagination. Over the nearly 60 years that she has been active, Ono has created installations of modern art across the globe, recorded numerous original songs both with John Lennon and the [[Plastic Ono Band]], as well as individually, and continues in activism to this day.\n\n== Orlan==\nORLAN (born as Mireille Suzanne Francette Porte) is French performance artist, most known for her radical use of plastic surgery to form her work. She uses her face and body as a malleable tool to change her appearance and therefore change her art. She primarily used plastic surgery to morph and change her body in her theatrical expression. Orlan uses her body at the heart of her expression, to articulate her political, social and cultural beliefs. Due to suffering an ectopic pregnancy, she felt her body was changed dramatically, and through that, she chose to turn her body into artwork through the use of plastic surgery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/orlan/|title=ORLAN {{!}} artnet|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nOne of her most notable performances was that of the 1977 International Contemporary Art Fair in Paris. On her exterior, she had a large photo of a torso on her chest. This was turned into a slot machine, where the audience could put a coin down the slot and watch it descend into the groin. As a reward, that audience member were given a kiss. She also displayed her sexual organs during menstruation under a magnifying glass for respective audience members to study. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Donger|first=Simon|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XoXFBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=orlan&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyw_Da7snoAhVxlFwKHZmmAdsQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=orlan&f=false|title=ORLAN: A Hybrid Body of Artworks|last2=Shepherd|first2=Simon|date=2010-05-20|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-97128-0|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Bj\u00f6rk Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir ==\nThe musical artist Bj\u00f6rk has been challenging musical barriers since her time in the band [[The Sugarcubes]], which became the biggest alternative rock band in Iceland.

This inspired her future work to explore the aspects of belonging, estrangement, feminism, life, death, violence and overall the rawness of the natural of femininity and the earth. Her fascinations with natures elements: water, fire, earth, air and the flesh were interwoven into her performance art work.

MacKenny also writes that feminist performance Art had a large presence \u201cin the late '60s and early '70s in America when, in the climate of protest constituted by the civil rights movement and [[second wave feminism]].\" There are several movements that fall under the category of feminist performance art, including Feminist Postmodernism, which took place during 1960-1970 and focused on the exploitation of women's bodies as a means for profit. Similarly, the Chicanx movement emerged in East Los Angeles during the 1970s, and focused on the Vietnam war, which was considered a post-apartheid movement.<ref name=\"MacKenny\">{{cite journal|last1=MacKenny|first1=Virginia|title=Post - Apartheid Performance Art as a Site of Gender Resistance|journal=Agenda Empowering Women for Gender Equity|date=2001|volume=49|pages=15\u201324|issn=1013-0950}}</ref>\n\n== Feminist Postmodernism ==\nAs Forte writes in her analysis of feminist performance art in the 1960s and 1970s, \u201cWithin this movement, women's performance emerges as a specific strategy that allies [[postmodernism]] and [[feminism]] \u2026 women used performance as a deconstructive strategy to demonstrate the objectification of women and its results\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=Jeanie|title=Women's Performance Art: Feminism and Postmodernism|journal=Theatre Journal|date=1988|volume=40.2|issn=0192-2882}}</ref> Another strategy that was commonly used by feminist performance artists during the postmodernist movement was \u201cremoving of the mask,\u201d which was utilized to demonstrate the consequences of female representations in the media, on the psyche of women. MacKenny also writes about the removing of the mask within Feminist Postmodernism. She writes, \u201cThis 'masquerade' or 'masking' occurs when women play with their assigned gender roles in multiple, often contradictory ways - adopting, adapting, overlaying and subverting the hegemonic discourse in the process.\u201d\n\n== Chicanx Movement ==\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s in East Los Angeles, protests broke out against the [[Vietnam War]] and its disproportionate death rate of 22% Chicanx people, while the percentage of the population that Chicanx people made up only 5% of the United States entire population.\n[[Asco (art collective)]], based in [[East Los Angeles, California|East LA]] commented on the impacts of the war on [[queer]] and brown identities, as well as the tragedies that occurred in the protests discussed above due to [[police brutality]]. The collective created visual and performative art. Some of their most famous performances experiment with gender roles, for example, one male identifying artist attended a club wearing \u201cbooty shorts, pink platforms, and a shirt that said \u2018just turned 21.\u2019\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perez|first1=Laura E.|title=Chicana art: the politics of spiritual and aesthetic altarities|date=2007|publisher=Durham: Duke U|isbn=978-0-8223-8988-0|doi=10.1215/9780822389880}}</ref>\nThe group continued to make performance and visual art that engaged with concepts related to queer and [[ethnic identity]] in East LA. During this period, East LA was ghettoized through a border of highways and dilapidated conditions.\n\n== Post Apartheid Movement ==\nMacKenny writes about two of the major players in the Post [[Apartheid]] performance art movement in [[South Africa]]. She first writes about Carol Anne Gainer and her performance entitled 'Exposed.' MacKenny explains that Gainer disrupts and subverts the binary as she performs as both the model and artist in this performance, which works to blur the \"distinction between artist/art, artist/model, constructor/constructed, finder/found, mind/body, subject/object.\"\nThe second artist which Mackenny writes about is a [[mixed race]] artist who performs a piece called 'Span.' MacKenny asserts that the artist Tracey Rose, alludes to Western societies exploitation of people of colour in scientific study and analysis, and the \"dissection and embalming of body parts of native 'others' (the most pertinent to the South African context being Saartje Baartman, a young Khoisan woman displayed for her unique genitalia and steatopygia, or enlarged buttocks),\" through her own display of her body.<ref name=\"MacKenny\"/> Her performance exposes her naked body and is contrasted against images of \"scientific\" exploitation, which both highlights the dichotomy between these subjects and engages with Mackenny's definition of post-apartheid performance art and its political aim to blur and disrupt binary structures.\n\n=== Anti War Performance Art Movement ===\nThe sociologist Rachel V Kutz-Flamenbaum writes about two major players in the anti-war performance art movement during the George W Bush administration. Code Pink, and Raging Grannies challenge and subvert gender norms in their performances, and thus, use very similar tactics and strategies. For instance, in Code Pink, Kutz-Flamenbaum asserts that, \"the emphasis on women\u2019s role as pacifist caregivers presents a nonthreatening image of women activists.\" \n\nThe perpetuated concept of women as non threatening, relies on the audiences association of pink as a non threatening and feminized colour. Kutz-Flamenbaum argues that \"Code Pink\u2019s use of civil disobedience and aggressive trailing of public officials confound and challenge normative gender expectations of women as passive, polite, and well-behaved.\"(95)<ref name=\"Kutz-Flamenbaum\">{{cite journal|last1=Kutz-Flamenbaum|first1=Rachel V|title=Code Pink, Raging Grannies, and the Missile Dick Chicks: Feminist Performance Activism in the Contemporary Anti-War Movement|journal=NWSA Journal|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=90\u201396|issn=1040-0656}}</ref>\nKutz-Flamenbaum claims that [[Raging Grannies]] similarly use this tactic in the description of their mission statement. Kutz-Flamenbaum explains that their mission statement \"illustrates the way Raging Grannies use norm- embracing stereotypes of 'little old ladies' and 'grannies' to challenge the gendered assumptions of their audiences.\" Their conscious performance as non-threatening and nurturing women, strategically and tactfully confront issues related to war and challenge the participation of the George W Bush administration in the war. \n\n== Performance Artists ==\n\n==[[Yoko Ono]]==\n\n=== Overview ===\nOno belonged to a generation of early feminist performance artists but is unique among them for her international fame as [[John Lennon]]\u2019s wife in the late 60s and 70s.  During their courtship the couple manipulated the press attention directed on them by documenting their relationship through performance art.<ref name=\":0\">Elizabeth Ann Lindau. \u201cMother Superior\u201d: Maternity and Creativity in the Work of Yoko Ono.\" ''Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture'' 20 (University of Nebraska Press: 2016), 64.</ref> As Ono stated in a 1986 TV interview, \u201cwe were always together\u2026 we exchanged very fully between ourselves.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">''Yoko Ono on John Lennon's Assasination, Their Son Sean and Influencing The Beatles Breakup.'', ''YouTube'' (YouTube, 2017), <nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suj8MCysBKQ</nowiki>)</ref> They emphasized this unusual situation, where the husband and wife worked together rather than the pair working separately outside the home, through their performance art \u201cBed-ins.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs an interracial couple they also challenged racial stereotypes. She confessed, \u201cI think it was a big lesson for the world that we were together\u2026 And I think it might have helped too for people to understand what it means to confront the interracial couple.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nParenthood is a factor in the controversy surrounding Ono. Women were not usually part of performance art or rock music, and mothers in particular were antithetical to everything rock stood for. The public idea of rock music as youthful male rebellion placed mothers as the opponent. When Ono and Lennon began their relationship, Beatles fans saw this female influence as an intrusion and the force that broke up their favorite band. However, as Ono saw it, the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] grew apart naturally and she was not the primary cause.<ref name=\":1\" /> Public confusion was exacerbated with Ono\u2019s pregnancy. While pregnant with their son Sean, Ono announced to Lennon: \u201cI am carrying the baby nine months and that is enough. You take care of it afterwards.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> After Sean\u2019s birth, she ran the couple\u2019s business while Lennon stayed home as \u201chousehusband.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Ono\u2019s hands off approach to parenting is a source of controversy because she was simultaneously too motherly and not motherly enough.\n\n=== Work ===\nOne of her early works is [[Cut Piece]], first performed in 1964 at the Yamaichi Concert Hall in Kyoto. She kneeled on the stage in her best suit and invited audience members to use scissors to cut it off of her. Confronting issues of gender, class and cultural identity, Ono sat silently until the piece concluded at her discretion.<ref>Munroe, Alexandra; Ono, Yoko; Hendricks, Jon; Altshuler, Bruce; Ross, David A.; Wenner, Jann S.; Concannon, Kevin C.; Tomii, Reiko; Sayle, Murray; Gomez, Edward M.

The book reads like an instruction manual for the reader to create their own versions of her pieces either physically or in the imagination. Over the nearly 60 years that she has been active, Ono has created installations of modern art across the globe, recorded numerous original songs both with John Lennon and the [[Plastic Ono Band]], as well as individually, and continues in activism to this day.\n\n== Orlan==\nORLAN (born as Mireille Suzanne Francette Porte) is French performance artist, most known for her radical use of plastic surgery to form her work. She uses her face and body as a malleable tool to change her appearance and therefore change her art. She primarily used plastic surgery to morph and change her body in her theatrical expression. Orlan uses her body at the heart of her expression, to articulate her political, social and cultural beliefs. Due to suffering an ectopic pregnancy, she felt her body was changed dramatically, and through that, she chose to turn her body into artwork through the use of plastic surgery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/orlan/|title=ORLAN {{!}} artnet|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nOne of her most notable performances was that of the 1977 International Contemporary Art Fair in Paris. On her exterior, she had a large photo of a torso on her chest. This was turned into a slot machine, where the audience could put a coin down the slot and watch it descend into the groin. As a reward, that audience member were given a kiss.

The film also stars [[Lily James]] as the protagonist's childhood friend and love interest, [[Kate McKinnon]] as his obnoxious manager, and [[Ed Sheeran]] as a fictionalised version of himself.\n\nThe project was announced in March 2018. Filming began the following month around England, particularly [[Norfolk]] and Halesworth in Suffolk. Photography also took place at [[Wembley Stadium]], [[Millennium Stadium|Principality Stadium]] and in [[Los Angeles]].

It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the premise, performances, and [[musical film|musical]] sequences, but criticism of the familiarity and not taking the concept further.\n\n==Plot==\nJack Malik is a struggling singer-songwriter from [[Lowestoft]]. His manager and childhood friend Ellie Appleton encourages him not to give up on his dreams. During a global blackout, Jack is hit by a bus. After recovering, he sings the [[the Beatles|Beatles]] song \"[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]\" for his friends, and discovers they have never heard of the Beatles. After realising no one in the world remembers them, Jack begins performing Beatles songs, passing them off as his own.\n\nEllie has Jack record a demo with a local music producer, Gavin. While recording day and night in Gavin's recording room, Malik published and gave out his album to every customer he sees back at Lowestoft. Following a performance on local television, Jack is invited by pop star [[Ed Sheeran]] to play as his opening act in Moscow. Ellie declines to join him, saying she must work at her day job as a schoolteacher, so Jack's [[Road crew|roadie]] friend Rocky travels with him instead. After the gig, Sheeran challenges Jack to a songwriting duel; he loses to Jack's \"[[The Long and Winding Road]]\". In Los Angeles, Sheeran's ruthless manager Debra Hammer signs him to her label and engineers his rise to global fame.\n\nAt Jack's going-away party, Ellie confesses that she has always been in love with him. Jack goes back to Los Angeles and starts recording the album at [[EastWest Studios]], but cannot remember the lyrics for the song he was trying to \"write,\" \"[[Eleanor Rigby]].\" Hoping to trigger memories, Jack goes to the Beatles' hometown of [[Liverpool]], visiting landmarks such as [[Strawberry Field]], [[Penny Lane, Liverpool|Penny Lane]], and the grave of [[Eleanor Rigby#Real people named Eleanor Rigby|Eleanor Rigby]]. Ellie joins him in Liverpool, and they spend a drunken evening and kiss, but Ellie tells him she is not interested in a one-night stand. The next morning, Jack and Rocky pursue Ellie to the train station, where she congratulates Jack but tells him she cannot be a part of his celebrity life. Jack returns to Los Angeles, heartbroken; Ellie begins dating Gavin.\n\nThe record label prepares to launch Jack's debut album. The producers reject his suggested titles, taken from Beatles records, and name the album ''One Man Only'', pushing his talent. Jack persuades them to launch the album with a [[The Beatles' rooftop concert|rooftop concert]] in [[Gorleston-on-Sea]]. Backstage, two fans approach him and tell him they know he plagiarised the songs, but thank him, having feared the Beatles' music was gone forever. They give him the address of [[John Lennon]], who has survived into old age, out of the public spotlight. John, who has lived a happy life with his wife, advises Jack to pursue the one he loves and always tell the truth.\n\nSheeran arranges for Jack to perform at [[Wembley Stadium]]. Jack confesses to the crowd that he plagiarised the music and that he loves Ellie, and has Rocky upload the songs free to the internet, sabotaging the record release, much to Debra\u2019s anger, who is enraged over Jack\u2019s confession. \n\nEventually, Jack and Ellie marry and have a family together, and Jack becomes a music teacher. During the story Jack also discovers other things have disappeared, such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[cigarettes]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], and [[Harry Potter]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Himesh Patel]] as Jack Malik\n* [[Lily James]] as Ellie Appleton\n* [[Joel Fry (actor)|Joel Fry]] as Rocky\n* [[Ed Sheeran]] as himself\n* [[Kate McKinnon]] as Debra Hammer\n* [[Sanjeev Bhaskar]] as Jed Malik\n* [[Meera Syal]] as Shelia Malik\n* Harry Michell as Nick\n* [[Sophia Di Martino]] as Carol\n* [[Sarah Lancashire]] as Liz (Liverpool stranger)\n* [[Alexander Arnold (actor)|Alexander Arnold]] as Gavin\n* [[Lamorne Morris]] as Head of Marketing\n}}\n\nIn addition, [[James Corden]] (hosting his show) and [[Michael Kiwanuka]] (waiting for Rocky to bring guitar) appear as themselves, [[Justin Edwards (actor)|Justin Edwards]] plays Leo (the Russian stranger who remembers the Beatles), and [[Robert Carlyle]] makes an uncredited appearance as [[John Lennon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/yesterday-movie-john-lennon-actor-robert-carlyle/ |title=Who Plays [SPOILER] In Yesterday? |first=John |last=Orquiola |date=28 June 2019 |work=[[Screen Rant]] |accessdate=28 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe film began as an original screenplay called ''Cover Version'', by writer Jack Barth and actor-writer-director [[Mackenzie Crook]], with Crook intending to direct the film.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-nowhere-man-behind-the-yesterday-script-11561392902? |title='Yesterday': The Real Story Behind The Beatles-Inspired Movie |last1=Watson |first1=R.

Whereas in ''Cover Version'', the lead character achieves only moderate success with the Beatles songs, Curtis's lead character becomes the world's most celebrated singer-songwriter. Curtis also shifted focus onto the love story between the male and female leads.\n\nIn March 2018, it was announced that director [[Danny Boyle]] and writer Richard Curtis were working together on a

His manager and childhood friend Ellie Appleton encourages him not to give up on his dreams. During a global blackout, Jack is hit by a bus. After recovering, he sings the [[the Beatles|Beatles]] song \"[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]\" for his friends, and discovers they have never heard of the Beatles. After realising no one in the world remembers them, Jack begins performing Beatles songs, passing them off as his own.\n\nEllie has Jack record a demo with a local music producer, Gavin. While recording day and night in Gavin's recording room, Malik published and gave out his album to every customer he sees back at Lowestoft. Following a performance on local television, Jack is invited by pop star [[Ed Sheeran]] to play as his opening act in Moscow. Ellie declines to join him, saying she must work at her day job as a schoolteacher, so Jack's [[Road crew|roadie]] friend Rocky travels with him instead. After the gig, Sheeran challenges Jack to a songwriting duel; he loses to Jack's \"[[The Long and Winding Road]]\". In Los Angeles, Sheeran's ruthless manager Debra Hammer signs him to her label and engineers his rise to global fame.\n\nAt Jack's going-away party, Ellie confesses that she has always been in love with him. Jack goes back to Los Angeles and starts recording the album at [[EastWest Studios]], but cannot remember the lyrics for the song he was trying to \"write,\" \"[[Eleanor Rigby]].\" Hoping to trigger memories, Jack goes to the Beatles' hometown of [[Liverpool]], visiting landmarks such as [[Strawberry Field]], [[Penny Lane, Liverpool|Penny Lane]], and the grave of [[Eleanor Rigby#Real people named Eleanor Rigby|Eleanor Rigby]]. Ellie joins him in Liverpool, and they spend a drunken evening and kiss, but Ellie tells him she is not interested in a one-night stand. The next morning, Jack and Rocky pursue Ellie to the train station, where she congratulates Jack but tells him she cannot be a part of his celebrity life. Jack returns to Los Angeles, heartbroken; Ellie begins dating Gavin.\n\nThe record label prepares to launch Jack's debut album. The producers reject his suggested titles, taken from Beatles records, and name the album ''One Man Only'', pushing his talent. Jack persuades them to launch the album with a [[The Beatles' rooftop concert|rooftop concert]] in [[Gorleston-on-Sea]]. Backstage, two fans approach him and tell him they know he plagiarised the songs, but thank him, having feared the Beatles' music was gone forever. They give him the address of [[John Lennon]], who has survived into old age, out of the public spotlight. John, who has lived a happy life with his wife, advises Jack to pursue the one he loves and always tell the truth.\n\nSheeran arranges for Jack to perform at [[Wembley Stadium]]. Jack confesses to the crowd that he plagiarised the music and that he loves Ellie, and has Rocky upload the songs free to the internet, sabotaging the record release, much to Debra\u2019s anger, who is enraged over Jack\u2019s confession. \n\nEventually, Jack and Ellie marry and have a family together, and Jack becomes a music teacher. During the story Jack also discovers other things have disappeared, such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[cigarettes]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], and [[Harry Potter]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Himesh Patel]] as Jack Malik\n* [[Lily James]] as Ellie Appleton\n* [[Joel Fry (actor)|Joel Fry]] as Rocky\n* [[Ed Sheeran]] as himself\n* [[Kate McKinnon]] as Debra Hammer\n* [[Sanjeev Bhaskar]] as Jed Malik\n* [[Meera Syal]] as Shelia Malik\n* Harry Michell as Nick\n* [[Sophia Di Martino]] as Carol\n* [[Sarah Lancashire]] as Liz (Liverpool stranger)\n* [[Alexander Arnold (actor)|Alexander Arnold]] as Gavin\n* [[Lamorne Morris]] as Head of Marketing\n}}\n\nIn addition, [[James Corden]] (hosting his show) and [[Michael Kiwanuka]] (waiting for Rocky to bring guitar) appear as themselves, [[Justin Edwards (actor)|Justin Edwards]] plays Leo (the Russian stranger who remembers the Beatles), and [[Robert Carlyle]] makes an uncredited appearance as [[John Lennon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/yesterday-movie-john-lennon-actor-robert-carlyle/ |title=Who Plays [SPOILER] In Yesterday? |first=John |last=Orquiola |date=28 June 2019 |work=[[Screen Rant]] |accessdate=28 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe film began as an original screenplay called ''Cover Version'', by writer Jack Barth and actor-writer-director [[Mackenzie Crook]], with Crook intending to direct the film.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-nowhere-man-behind-the-yesterday-script-11561392902? |title='Yesterday': The Real Story Behind The Beatles-Inspired Movie |last1=Watson |first1=R.

Higher income inequality is partly driven by unequal regional income distribution. The eastern coastal regions have been the driver of China's rapid growth, due to its geographic location and the early introduction of reforms. As a result, the eastern coastal region is now home to 38 percent of the population, and its per capita GDP was 77 percent higher than that of the central, western, and northeastern regions in 2018. This gap widened further in the first three quarters of 2019. This is in part due to a disproportionate slowdown in interior provinces, which are more dependent on commodities and heavy industry. The slowdown has been negatively affected by structural shifts, especially necessary cuts in overcapacity (Figure 28).}}</ref>\n| Gini_rank                = \n| HDI                = 0.758 <!--number only-->\n| HDI_year                = 2018<!-- Please use the year to which the data refers, not the publication year-->\n| HDI_change                = increase <!--increase/decrease/steady-->\n| HDI_ref                = <ref name=\"UNHDR\">{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/2019-human-development-index-ranking|title=Human Development Report 2019|language=en|publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]]|date=10 December 2019|accessdate=10 December 2019|format=PDF}}</ref>\n| HDI_rank                = 85th\n| currency                = [[Renminbi]] (yuan; \u00a5){{efn|The [[Hong Kong Dollar]] is used in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] while the [[Macanese pataca]] is used in Macau only.}}\n| currency_code                = CNY\n| time_zone                = [[China Standard Time]]\n| utc_offset                = [[UTC+08:00|+8]]\n| date_format                = {{vunblist |yyyy-mm-dd |''or'' yyyy{{lang|zh|\u5e74}}m{{lang|zh|\u6708}}d{{lang|zh|\u65e5}} |([[Common Era|CE]]; [[Chinese calendar|CE-1949]])}}\n| drives_on                = right{{efn|Motor vehicles and metros drive on the right in mainland China.

See {{section link||Administrative divisions}}}} five [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]], four [[Direct-controlled municipalities of China|direct-controlled municipalities]] ([[Beijing]], [[Tianjin]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Chongqing]]), and the [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]].\n\nChina emerged as one of the world's [[Cradle of civilization|first civilizations]], in the fertile basin of the [[Yellow River]] in the [[North China Plain]]. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]], beginning with the semi-mythical [[Xia dynasty]] in 21st century [[Common Era|BCE]]. Since then, China has [[Dynasties in Chinese history|expanded, fractured, and re-unified]] numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, [[Qin's wars of unification|the Qin reunited core China]] and established [[Qin dynasty|the first Chinese empire]]. The succeeding [[Han dynasty]], which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE, saw some of the [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|most advanced technology]] at that time, including [[papermaking]] and the [[compass]], along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of [[gunpowder]] and [[movable type]] in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907) and [[Northern Song]] (960\u20131127) completed the [[Four Great Inventions]]. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new [[Silk Road|Silk Route]] brought traders to as far as [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Horn of Africa]]. Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the [[Xinhai Revolution]], when the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China (ROC)]] replaced the [[Qing dynasty]]. China, as a whole, was ravaged by [[Warlord Era|feudal warlordism]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] during [[World War II]]. The subsequent [[Chinese Civil War]] resulted in a division of territory in 1949 when the [[Communist Party of China]] led by [[Mao Zedong]] [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|established]] the People's Republic of China on [[mainland China]] while the [[Kuomintang]]-led nationalist government retreated to the island of [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] where it governed until 1996 when Taiwan transitioned to democracy. The [[political status of Taiwan]] remains disputed to this day.\n\nChina is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[One-party state|one-party]] [[socialist state|socialist republic]] and is one of the few existing [[socialist state]]s. [[List of Chinese dissidents|Political dissidents]] and [[human rights]] groups have denounced and criticized the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] for [[Human rights in China|human rights abuses]], [[Ethnic issues in China|suppression of religious and ethnic minorities]], [[Censorship in China|censorship]] and [[Mass surveillance in China|mass surveillance]], and cracking down on protests [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|such as in 1989]]. The Chinese government says that the right to subsistence and [[economic development]] is a prerequisite to other types of human rights and that the notion of human rights should take into account a country's present economic level.\n\nSince the introduction of [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms in 1978]], [[Economy of China|China's economy]] has been one of the world's [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest-growing]] with annual growth rates consistently above 6 percent. According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $12.24 trillion by 2017. According to official data, China's GDP in 2018 was 90 trillion Yuan ($13.5 trillion). Since 2010, China has been the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|second-largest economy by nominal GDP]], and since 2014, the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|largest economy in the world by PPP]]. China is also the world's [[List of countries by exports|largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|second-largest importer]] of goods. China is a recognized [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons state]] and has the world's [[List of countries by number of active troops|largest standing army]], the [[People's Liberation Army]], and the [[Military budget of China|second-largest defense budget]]. The PRC is a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]] as it replaced the ROC in 1971, as well as an active global partner of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations#ASEAN Plus Three and Six|ASEAN Plus mechanism]]. China has been characterized as a [[potential superpower]], mainly because of its massive population, large and rapidly-growing economy, and powerful military.\n\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Names{{anchor|Etymology|Name}}==\n{{Main|Names of China}}\n{{Infobox Chinese\n|collapse=no\n|title=China\n|pic=China (Chinese characters).svg\n|piccap=\"China\" in [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified]] (top) and [[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional]] (bottom) Chinese characters\n|picupright=0.45\n| t={{linktext|\u4e2d\u570b}}\n| s={{linktext|\u4e2d\u56fd}}\n| p=Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\n| w=Chung\u00b9-kuo\u00b2\n| mi={{IPAc-cmn|zh|ong|1|.|g|wo|2}}\n| sic=Zong<sup>1</sup> gwe<sup>2</sup>\n| bpmf=\u3113\u3128\u3125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310d\u3128\u311b\u02ca\n| xej=\ufe9f\u0652\ufeee\ufed7\u064f\ufeee\u064e\u0639\n| tp=Jhonggu\u00f3\n| mps=J\u016bnggu\u00f3\n| gr=Jonggwo\n| myr=J\u016bnggw\u00f3\n| zh-dungan=\u0496\u0443\u043d\u0433\u0443\u0439\n| poj=Tiong-kok\n| tl=Tiong-kok\n| gan=Tung-koe\u030dt\n| hsn=Tan<sup>33</sup>-kw\u025b<sup>24</sup>/\n| wuu=Tson<sup>\u5e73</sup>-koh<sup>\u5165</sup>\n| j=Zung1gwok3\n| y=J\u00f9nggwok ''or'' J\u016bnggwok\n| ci={{IPAc-yue|z|ung|7|.|gw|ok|3}} ''or'' {{IPAc-yue|z|ung|1|.|gw|ok|3}}\n| h=Dung<sup>24</sup>-gued<sup>2</sup>\n| phfs=Ch\u00fbng-koet\n| buc=D\u1e73\u0306ng-gu\u00f3k\n| hhbuc=De\u0324ng-go\u0324h\n| mblmc=D\u00f4\u0324ng-g\u014f\n|tib = {{bo-textonly|\u0f40\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f42\u0f7c\u0f0b}}\n|zwpy= Krung-go\n|mong = [[File:China in Mongolian.svg|35px|alt=Dumdadu ulus]]\n|monr =Dumdadu ulus\n|mnc = [[File:China in Manchu.svg|35px|alt=Dulimbai Gurun]]\n|mnc_rom =Dulimbai Gurun\n|uig = {{lang|ug|\u062c\u06c7\u06ad\u06af\u0648}}\n|uly= Junggo\n|zha= Cungguek \n| altname = Alternate name\n| t2 = {{linktext|\u4e2d\u83ef}}\n| s2 = {{linktext|\u4e2d\u534e}}\n| p2 = Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\n| gan2 = tung<sup>1</sup> fa<sup>4</sup> ''or''<br />Chungfa\n| w2 = Chung\u00b9-hua\u00b2\n| bpmf2 = \u3113\u3128\u3125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310f\u3128\u311a\u02ca|tp2 = Jhonghu\u00e1 |mps2 = J\u016bnghu\u00e1 |gr2 = Jonghwa |myr2 = J\u016bnghw\u00e1 |mi2 = {{IPAc-cmn|zh|ong|1|.|h|wa|2}}\n| xej2 = \ufe9f\u0652\ufeee \ufea7\u064f\ufeee\u064e \n| poj2 = Tiong-h\u00f4a\n| tl2 = Tiong-hu\u00e2\n| wuu2 = tson<sup>\u5e73</sup> gho<sup>\u5e73</sup>\n| j2 = Zung1waa4\n| ci2 = {{IPAc-yue|z|ung|7|.|w|aa|4}} ''or'' {{IPAc-yue|z|ung|1|.|w|aa|4}}\n| y2 = J\u00f9ng'w\u00e0h ''or'' J\u016bng'w\u00e0h\n| h2 = dung<sup>24</sup> fa<sup>11</sup>\n| phfs2 = Ch\u00fbng-f\u00e0\n| buc2 = D\u1e73\u0306ng-hu\u00e0\n| showflag=p\n| order=st\n| l={{nowrap|\"Middle\" or \"Central State\"<ref name=zg>{{citation |contribution=Reconstructing China beyond Homogeneity |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bEiDBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA105 105] |series=Political Theories in East Asian Context |title=Patriotism in East Asia |editor=Jun-Hyeok Kwak |editor2=Koichiro Matsuda |display-editors=0 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon |date=2015 |last=Bilik |first=Naran }}</ref>}}}}\n \nThe word \"China\" has been used in English since the 16th century.

Heavy metal pollution is an inorganic chemical hazard, which is mainly caused by lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni). Five metals among them, Pb, Cr, As, Cd, and Hg, are the key heavy metal pollutants in China. Heavy metal pollutants mainly come from mining, sewage irrigation, the manufacturing of metal-containing products, and other related production activities. High level of heavy metal exposure can also cause permanent intellectual and developmental disabilities, including reading and learning disabilities, behavioral problems, hearing loss, attention problems, and disruption in the development of visual and motor function. According to the data of a national census of pollution, China has more than 1.5 million sites of heavy metals exposure.

Higher income inequality is partly driven by unequal regional income distribution. The eastern coastal regions have been the driver of China's rapid growth, due to its geographic location and the early introduction of reforms. As a result, the eastern coastal region is now home to 38 percent of the population, and its per capita GDP was 77 percent higher than that of the central, western, and northeastern regions in 2018. This gap widened further in the first three quarters of 2019. This is in part due to a disproportionate slowdown in interior provinces, which are more dependent on commodities and heavy industry. The slowdown has been negatively affected by structural shifts, especially necessary cuts in overcapacity (Figure 28).}}</ref>\n| Gini_rank                = \n| HDI                = 0.758 <!--number only-->\n| HDI_year                = 2018<!-- Please use the year to which the data refers, not the publication year-->\n| HDI_change                = increase <!--increase/decrease/steady-->\n| HDI_ref                = <ref name=\"UNHDR\">{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/2019-human-development-index-ranking|title=Human Development Report 2019|language=en|publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]]|date=10 December 2019|accessdate=10 December 2019|format=PDF}}</ref>\n| HDI_rank                = 85th\n| currency                = [[Renminbi]] (yuan; \u00a5){{efn|The [[Hong Kong Dollar]] is used in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] while the [[Macanese pataca]] is used in Macau only.}}\n| currency_code                = CNY\n| time_zone                = [[China Standard Time]]\n| utc_offset                = [[UTC+08:00|+8]]\n| date_format                = {{vunblist |yyyy-mm-dd |''or'' yyyy{{lang|zh|\u5e74}}m{{lang|zh|\u6708}}d{{lang|zh|\u65e5}} |([[Common Era|CE]]; [[Chinese calendar|CE-1949]])}}\n| drives_on                = right{{efn|Motor vehicles and metros drive on the right in mainland China.

For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]], beginning with the semi-mythical [[Xia dynasty]] in 21st century [[Common Era|BCE]]. Since then, China has [[Dynasties in Chinese history|expanded, fractured, and re-unified]] numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, [[Qin's wars of unification|the Qin reunited core China]] and established [[Qin dynasty|the first Chinese empire]]. The succeeding [[Han dynasty]], which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE, saw some of the [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|most advanced technology]] at that time, including [[papermaking]] and the [[compass]], along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of [[gunpowder]] and [[movable type]] in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907) and [[Northern Song]] (960\u20131127) completed the [[Four Great Inventions]]. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new [[Silk Road|Silk Route]] brought traders to as far as [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Horn of Africa]]. Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the [[Xinhai Revolution]], when the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China (ROC)]] replaced the [[Qing dynasty]]. China, as a whole, was ravaged by [[Warlord Era|feudal warlordism]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] during [[World War II]]. The subsequent [[Chinese Civil War]] resulted in a division of territory in 1949 when the [[Communist Party of China]] led by [[Mao Zedong]] [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|established]] the People's Republic of China on [[mainland China]] while the [[Kuomintang]]-led nationalist government retreated to the island of [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] where it governed until 1996 when Taiwan transitioned to democracy. The [[political status of Taiwan]] remains disputed to this day.\n\nChina is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[One-party state|one-party]] [[socialist state|socialist republic]] and is one of the few existing [[socialist state]]s. [[List of Chinese dissidents|Political dissidents]] and [[human rights]] groups have denounced and criticized the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] for [[Human rights in China|human rights abuses]], [[Ethnic issues in China|suppression of religious and ethnic minorities]], [[Censorship in China|censorship]] and [[Mass surveillance in China|mass surveillance]], and cracking down on protests [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|such as in 1989]]. The Chinese government says that the right to subsistence and [[economic development]] is a prerequisite to other types of human rights and that the notion of human rights should take into account a country's present economic level.\n\nSince the introduction of [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms in 1978]], [[Economy of China|China's economy]] has been one of the world's [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest-growing]] with annual growth rates consistently above 6 percent. According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $12.24 trillion by 2017. According to official data, China's GDP in 2018 was 90 trillion Yuan ($13.5 trillion). Since 2010, China has been the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|second-largest economy by nominal GDP]], and since 2014, the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|largest economy in the world by PPP]]. China is also the world's [[List of countries by exports|largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|second-largest importer]] of goods. China is a recognized [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons state]] and has the world's [[List of countries by number of active troops|largest standing army]], the [[People's Liberation Army]], and the [[Military budget of China|second-largest defense budget]]. The PRC is a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]] as it replaced the ROC in 1971, as well as an active global partner of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations#ASEAN Plus Three and Six|ASEAN Plus mechanism]]. China has been characterized as a [[potential superpower]], mainly because of its massive population, large and rapidly-growing economy, and powerful military.\n\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Names{{anchor|Etymology|Name}}==\n{{Main|Names of China}}\n{{Infobox Chinese\n|collapse=no\n|title=China\n|pic=China (Chinese characters).svg\n|piccap=\"China\" in [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified]] (top) and [[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional]] (bottom) Chinese characters\n|picupright=0.45\n| t={{linktext|\u4e2d\u570b}}\n| s={{linktext|\u4e2d\u56fd}}\n| p=Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\n| w=Chung\u00b9-kuo\u00b2\n| mi={{IPAc-cmn|zh|ong|1|.|g|wo|2}}\n| sic=Zong<sup>1</sup> gwe<sup>2</sup>\n| bpmf=\u3113\u3128\u3125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310d\u3128\u311b\u02ca\n| xej=\ufe9f\u0652\ufeee\ufed7\u064f\ufeee\u064e\u0639\n| tp=Jhonggu\u00f3\n| mps=J\u016bnggu\u00f3\n| gr=Jonggwo\n| myr=J\u016bnggw\u00f3\n| zh-dungan=\u0496\u0443\u043d\u0433\u0443\u0439\n| poj=Tiong-kok\n| tl=Tiong-kok\n| gan=Tung-koe\u030dt\n| hsn=Tan<sup>33</sup>-kw\u025b<sup>24</sup>/\n| wuu=Tson<sup>\u5e73</sup>-koh<sup>\u5165</sup>\n| j=Zung1gwok3\n| y=J\u00f9nggwok ''or'' J\u016bnggwok\n| ci={{IPAc-yue|z|ung|7|.|gw|ok|3}} ''or'' {{IPAc-yue|z|ung|1|.|gw|ok|3}}\n| h=Dung<sup>24</sup>-gued<sup>2</sup>\n| phfs=Ch\u00fbng-koet\n| buc=D\u1e73\u0306ng-gu\u00f3k\n| hhbuc=De\u0324ng-go\u0324h\n| mblmc=D\u00f4\u0324ng-g\u014f\n|tib = {{bo-textonly|\u0f40\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f42\u0f7c\u0f0b}}\n|zwpy= Krung-go\n|mong = [[File:China in Mongolian.svg|35px|alt=Dumdadu ulus]]\n|monr =Dumdadu ulus\n|mnc = [[File:China in Manchu.svg|35px|alt=Dulimbai Gurun]]\n|mnc_rom =Dulimbai Gurun\n|uig = {{lang|ug|\u062c\u06c7\u06ad\u06af\u0648}}\n|uly= Junggo\n|zha= Cungguek \n| altname = Alternate name\n| t2 = {{linktext|\u4e2d\u83ef}}\n| s2 = {{linktext|\u4e2d\u534e}}\n| p2 = Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\n| gan2 = tung<sup>1</sup> fa<sup>4</sup> ''or''<br />Chungfa\n| w2 = Chung\u00b9-hua\u00b2\n| bpmf2 = \u3113\u3128\u3125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310f\u3128\u311a\u02ca|tp2 = Jhonghu\u00e1 |mps2 = J\u016bnghu\u00e1 |gr2 = Jonghwa |myr2 = J\u016bnghw\u00e1 |mi2 = {{IPAc-cmn|zh|ong|1|.|h|wa|2}}\n| xej2 = \ufe9f\u0652\ufeee \ufea7\u064f\ufeee\u064e \n| poj2 = Tiong-h\u00f4a\n| tl2 = Tiong-hu\u00e2\n| wuu2 = tson<sup>\u5e73</sup> gho<sup>\u5e73</sup>\n| j2 = Zung1waa4\n| ci2 = {{IPAc-yue|z|ung|7|.|w|aa|4}} ''or'' {{IPAc-yue|z|ung|1|.|w|aa|4}}\n| y2 = J\u00f9ng'w\u00e0h ''or'' J\u016bng'w\u00e0h\n| h2 = dung<sup>24</sup> fa<sup>11</sup>\n| phfs2 = Ch\u00fbng-f\u00e0\n| buc2 = D\u1e73\u0306ng-hu\u00e0\n| showflag=p\n| order=st\n| l={{nowrap|\"Middle\" or \"Central State\"<ref name=zg>{{citation |contribution=Reconstructing China beyond Homogeneity |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bEiDBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA105 105] |series=Political Theories in East Asian Context |title=Patriotism in East Asia |editor=Jun-Hyeok Kwak |editor2=Koichiro Matsuda |display-editors=0 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon |date=2015 |last=Bilik |first=Naran }}</ref>}}}}\n \nThe word \"China\" has been used in English since the 16th century.

Five metals among them, Pb, Cr, As, Cd, and Hg, are the key heavy metal pollutants in China. Heavy metal pollutants mainly come from mining, sewage irrigation, the manufacturing of metal-containing products, and other related production activities. High level of heavy metal exposure can also cause permanent intellectual and developmental disabilities, including reading and learning disabilities, behavioral problems, hearing loss, attention problems, and disruption in the development of visual and motor function. According to the data of a national census of pollution, China has more than 1.5 million sites of heavy metals exposure.

The community believed that [[Jesus]] had already returned in AD 70, making it possible for them to bring about [[Millennialism|Jesus's millennial kingdom]] themselves, and be free of sin and perfect in this world, not just in [[Heaven]] (a belief called ''[[Christian perfection|perfectionism]]''). The Oneida Community practiced [[communalism]] (in the sense of communal property and possessions), [[complex marriage]], [[Coitus reservatus|male sexual continence]], and mutual criticism.  There were smaller Noyesian communities in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]]; [[Newark, New Jersey]]; [[Putney, Vermont|Putney]] and [[Cambridge, Vermont]].{{sfn |Chmielewski |2001 |pp=176\u2013178}} The community's original 87 members grew to 172 by February 1850, 208 by 1852, and 306 by 1878. The branches were closed in 1854 except for the Wallingford branch, which operated until devastated by a [[1878 Wallingford tornado|tornado]] in 1878. The Oneida Community dissolved in 1881, and eventually became the [[Cutlery|silverware]] company [[Oneida Limited]].{{sfn |Hays |1999}}\n\n== Community structure ==\nEven though the community only reached a maximum population of about 300, it had a complex bureaucracy of 27 standing committees and 48 administrative sections.{{sfn |MacHovec |2010}}{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe manufacturing of silverware, the sole remaining industry, began in 1877, relatively late in the life of the community, and still exists.{{sfn |Hays |1999}} Secondary industries included the manufacture of leather travel bags, the weaving of [[palm frond]] hats, the construction of rustic garden furniture, game traps, and tourism.\n\nAll community members were expected to work, each according to his or her abilities. Women tended to do many of the domestic duties.{{sfn |Kern |1981 |p=}}{{Page needed|date=March 2020}} Although more skilled jobs tended to remain with an individual member (the financial manager, for example, held his post throughout the life of the community), community members rotated through the more unskilled jobs, working in the house, the fields, or the various industries. As Oneida thrived, it began to hire outsiders to work in these positions as well. They were a major employer in the area, with approximately 200 employees by 1870.\n\n=== Complex marriage ===\nThe Oneida community strongly believed in a system of [[free love]] (a term which Noyes is credited with coining) which was known as complex marriage,{{sfn |Foster |1997 |p=}} where any member was free to have sex with any other who consented.{{sfn |Stoehr |1979 |p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}} Possessiveness and exclusive relationships were frowned upon.{{sfn |DeMaria |1978 |p=83}} Unlike 20th-century social movements such as the [[Sexual Revolution]] of the 1960s, the Oneidans did not seek consequence-free sex for pleasure, but believed that, because the natural outcome of intercourse was pregnancy, raising children should be a communal responsibility. Women over the age of 40 were to act as sexual \"mentors\" to adolescent boys, because these relationships had a minimal chance of conceiving. Furthermore, these women became religious role models for the young men. Likewise, older men often introduced young women to sex. Noyes often used his own judgment in determining the partnerships that would form, and he would often encourage relationships between the non-devout and the devout in the community, in the hope that the attitudes and behaviors of the devout would influence the attitudes of the non-devout.{{sfn |Noyes |1937 |p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1993, the archives of the community were made available to scholars for the first time. Contained within the archives was the journal of Tirzah Miller,{{sfn |Herrick |Fogarty |2000 |p=}} Noyes' niece, who wrote extensively about her romantic and sexual relations with other members of Oneida.{{sfn |Chmielewski |2001 |pp=176\u2013178}}\n\n=== Mutual criticism ===\nEvery member of the community was subject to criticism by committee or the community as a whole, during a general meeting.{{sfn |Noyes |Oneida Community |1876}} The goal was to eliminate undesirable character traits.{{sfn |Parker |1935 |p=[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015008678768?urlappend=%3Bseq=237 215]}} Various contemporary sources contend that Noyes himself was the subject of criticism, although less often and of probably less severe criticism than the rest of the community. Charles Nordhoff said he had witnessed the criticism of a member he referred to as \"Charles\", writing the following account of the incident:\n\n{{quote|Charles sat speechless, looking before him; but as the accusations multiplied, his face grew paler, and drops of perspiration began to stand on his forehead. The remarks I have reported took up about half an hour; and now, each one in the circle having spoken, Mr. Noyes summed up. He said that Charles had some serious faults; that he had watched him with some care; and that he thought the young man was earnestly trying to cure himself. He spoke in general praise of his ability, his good character, and of certain temptations he had resisted in the course of his life. He thought he saw signs that Charles was making a real and earnest attempt to conquer his faults; and as one evidence of this, he remarked that Charles had lately come to him to consult him upon a difficult case in which he had had a severe struggle, but had in the end succeeded in doing right. \"In the course of what we call stirpiculture\", said Noyes, \"Charles, as you know, is in the situation of one who is by and by to become a father. Under these circumstances, he has fallen under the too common temptation of selfish love, and a desire to wait upon and cultivate an exclusive intimacy with the woman who was to bear a child through him. This is an insidious temptation, very apt to attack people under such circumstances; but it must nevertheless be struggled against.\" Charles, he went on to say, had come to him for advice in this case, and he (Noyes) had at first refused to tell him any thing, but had asked him what he thought he ought to do; that after some conversation, Charles had determined, and he agreed with him, that he ought to isolate himself entirely from the woman, and let another man take his place at her side; and this Charles had accordingly done, with a most praiseworthy spirit of selfsacrifice. Charles had indeed still further taken up his cross, as he had noticed with pleasure, by going to sleep with the smaller children, to take charge of them during the night. Taking all this in view, he thought Charles was in a fair way to become a better man, and had manifested a sincere desire to improve, and to rid himself of all selfish faults.{{sfn |Nordhoff |1875 |pp=[https://archive.org/stream/communisticsoci00nord#page/292/mode/2up 292\u2013293]}}}}\n\n=== Male continence ===\nTo control reproduction within the Oneida community, a system of male continence or [[coitus reservatus]] was enacted.{{sfn |Sandeen |1971}} John Humprey Noyes decided that sexual intercourse served two distinct purposes. In ''Male Continence'', Noyes argues that the method simply \"proposes the subordination of the flesh to the spirit, teaching men to seek principally the elevated spiritual pleasures of sexual connection\".{{sfn |Noyes |1872 |p=[{{Google books|WjvC2hNe4uoC|page=13|plainurl=yes}} 13]}} The primary purpose of male continence was social satisfaction, \"to allow the sexes to communicate and express affection for one another\".{{sfn |Van Wormer |2006}} The second purpose was procreation. Of around two hundred adults using male continence as birth control, there were twelve unplanned births within Oneida between 1848 and 1868,{{sfn |Van Wormer |2006}} indicating that it was a highly effective form of birth control.{{sfn |Foster |1986}}{{rp|18}} Young men were introduced to male continence by women who were post-menopause, and young women were introduced by experienced, older males.{{sfn |Foster |1986}}{{rp|18\u201319}}\n\nNoyes believed that ejaculation \"drained men's vitality and led to disease\"{{sfn |Mandelker |1982 |pp=742\u20133}} and pregnancy and childbirth \"levied a heavy tax on the vitality of women\".{{sfn |Mandelker |1982 |pp=742\u20133}} Noyes founded male continence to spare his wife, Harriet, from more difficult childbirths after five traumatizing births of which four led to the death of the child.{{sfn |Foster |1986}}{{rp|17}} They favored this method of male continence over other methods of birth control because they found it to be natural, healthy and favorable for the development of intimate relationships.{{sfn |Mandelker |1982 |p=743}} Women found increased sexual satisfaction in the practice, and Oneida is regarded as highly unusual in the value they placed on women's sexual satisfaction.{{sfn |Foster |1986}}{{rp|19}} If a male failed he faced public disapproval or private rejection.{{sfn |Mandelker |1982 |p=743}}\n\nIt is unclear whether the practice of male continence led to significant problems. Sociologist Lawrence Foster sees hints in Noyes' letters indicating that masturbation and anti-social withdrawal from community life may have been issues.{{sfn |Foster |1986}}{{rp|19}} Oneida's practice of male continence did not lead to [[impotence]].{{sfn |Foster |1986}}{{rp|18}}\n\n=== Stirpiculture ===\n{{Main|Oneida stirpiculture}}\nStirpiculture was a proto-eugenics program of selective controlled reproduction within the Community devised by Noyes and implemented in 1869.<ref name=\"Q41713204\">{{Cite Q|Q41713204|jstor=658471}}</ref><ref name=\"Q41714157\">{{Cite Q|Q41714157|location=Weston |publisher=M & S Press|isbn=9780877300090}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cis.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1989/1/89.01.04.x.html Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, ''Utopian Communities, 1800\u20131890''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905044850/http://www.cis.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1989/1/89.01.04.x.html |date=September 5, 2006 }}</ref> It was designed to create more spiritually and physically perfect children.<ref>Richards, Martin (2004). \"Perfecting People: Selective Breeding at the Oneida Community (1869\u20131879) and the Eugenics Movement\", ''New Genetics and Society'' '''23''' (1), pp. 47\u201371.</ref> Community members who wished to be parents would go before a committee to be approved and matched based on their spiritual and moral qualities. 53 women and 38 men participated in this program, which necessitated the construction of a new wing of the Oneida Community Mansion House.

Some of these privileges included not having to care for their own children as Oneida had a communal child care system, as well as freedom from unwanted pregnancies with Oneida's [[Coitus reservatus|male continence]] practice. In addition, they were able to wear functional, [[Bloomers (clothing)|Bloomer]]-style clothing and maintain short haircuts. Women were able to participate in practically all types of community work.{{sfn |Foster |1991 |pp=[https://archive.org/details/womenfamilyutopi0000fost/page/91 91\u2013102]}}  While domestic duties remained a primarily female responsibility, women were free to explore positions in business and sales, or as artisans or craftsmen, and many did so, particularly in the late 1860s and early 1870s.{{sfn |Kern |1981 |p=260}} Last, women had an active role in shaping commune policy, participating in the daily religious and business meetings.{{sfn |Foster |1991 |pp=[https://archive.org/details/womenfamilyutopi0000fost/page/91 91\u2013102]}}\n\nThe [[Group marriage|complex marriage]] and free love systems practiced at Oneida further acknowledged female status. Through the complex marriage arrangement, women and men had equal freedom in sexual expression and commitment.{{sfn |Foster |1991 |pp=[https://archive.org/details/womenfamilyutopi0000fost/page/91 91\u2013102]}} Indeed, sexual practices at Oneida accepted female sexuality. A woman's right to satisfying sexual experiences was recognized, and women were encouraged to have orgasms.{{sfn |Kern |1981 |pp=224, 232}} However, a woman's right of refusing a sexual overture was limited depending on the status of the man who made the advance.{{sfn |Kern |1981 |p=241}}\n\nEllen Wayland-Smith, author of \"The Status and Self-Perception of Women in the Oneida Community\", said that men and women had roughly equal status in the community. She points out that while both sexes were ultimately subject to Noyes' vision and will, women did not suffer any undue oppression.{{sfn |Wayland-Smith |1988 |p=49}}\n\n== Interactions with wider society ==\nThe community experienced freedom from wider society. The previously mentioned unorthodox marital, sexual, and religious practices caused them to face some criticism. However, between the community's beginning in the 1850s until the 1870s, their interactions with wider society were mostly favorable. These are the best known instances of conflict and peace resolution.\n\n=== Outsider criticism ===\nIn 1870, a \"nineteenth century cultural critic\" Dr. John B. Ellis wrote a book against Free Love communities that Noyes inspired, including \"[[Anarchism|Individual Sovereigns]], [[Berlin Heights, Ohio|Berlin Heights]] Free Lovers, [[Spiritualists]], [[Women's suffrage in the United States|Advocates of Woman Suffrage]], or Friends of [[Divorce in the United States#19th century|Free Divorce]]\".{{sfn |Ellis |1870 ||pp=10\u201313}}<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Pantaloons in Private Health and Religious Dress Reform before Freedom Dresses|last=Fischer|first=Gayle|publisher=The Kent State University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0873386821|location=Ohio|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pantaloonspowern0000fisc/page/58 58]|url=https://archive.org/details/pantaloonspowern0000fisc/page/58}}</ref> He saw their joint goal to be ending marriage.

Twenty-one year old Tryphena Hubbard learned Noyes\u2019 ideas about marriage and sex through his manuscript ''Bible Argument'' in 1848. She joined the community and became the group's first local convert. Tryphena Hubbard soon married Henry Seymour, a young man in the community.{{sfn |Wonderley |2017 |pp=72\u201374, 137}}\n\nEarly in 1849, Tryphena's father Noahdiah Hubbard learned of the Association's open marriages and demanded his daughter's return.

There was also much debate about its practices as a whole. The founding members were aging or deceased, and many of the younger communitarians desired to enter into exclusive, traditional marriages.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Roach |first1=Monique Patenaude |date=June 2001 |title=The Loss of Religious Allegiance Among the Youth of the Oneida Community |journal=The Historian |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=787\u2013806 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6563.2001.tb01946.x |jstor=24450501}}</ref>\n\nThe capstone to all these pressures was the campaign by Professor John Mears of [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] against the community.

Noyes fled the Oneida Community Mansion House and the country in the middle of a June night in 1879, never to return to the United States. Shortly afterward, he wrote to his followers from [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], recommending that the practice of complex marriage be abandoned.\n\nComplex marriage was abandoned in 1879 following external pressures and the community soon broke apart, with some of the members reorganizing as a [[joint stock company|joint-stock company]]. Marital partners normalized their status with the partners with whom they were cohabiting at the time of the re-organization. Over 70 Community members entered into a traditional marriage in the following year.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, the new company, [[Oneida Limited|Oneida Community Limited]], narrowed their focus to silverware. The animal trap business was sold in 1912, the silk business in 1916, and the canning discontinued as unprofitable in 1915.\n\nThe joint-stock corporation still exists and is a major producer of [[cutlery]] under the brand name \"Oneida Limited\". In September 2004 Oneida Limited announced that it would cease all U.S. manufacturing operations in the beginning of 2005, ending a 124-year tradition. The company continues to design and market products that are manufactured overseas.  The company has been selling off its manufacturing facilities. Most recently, the distribution center in [[Sherrill, New York]], was closed.

Among those are: ''The Oneida Community: An Autobiography, 1851\u20131876'' and ''The Oneida Community: The Breakup, 1876\u20131881'', both by Constance Noyes Robertson; ''Desire and Duty at Oneida: Tirzah Miller's Intimate Memoir'' and ''Special Love/Special Sex: An Oneida Community Diary'', both by Robert S. Fogarty; ''Without Sin'' by Spencer Klaw; ''Oneida, From Free Love Utopia to the Well-Set Table'' by Ellen Wayland-Smith; and biographical/autobiographic accounts by once-members including Jessie Catherine Kinsley, Corinna Ackley Noyes, George Wallingford Noyes, and Pierrepont B. Noyes.\n\nAn account of the Oneida Community is found in [[Sarah Vowell]]'s book ''[[Assassination Vacation]]''. It discusses the community in general and the membership of [[Charles Guiteau]], for more than five years, in the community (Guiteau later assassinated President [[James A. Garfield]]).  The perfectionist community in [[David Flusfeder]]'s novel ''Pagan House'' (2007) is directly inspired by the Oneida Community. Oneida Community is given tribute at [[Twin Oaks Community|Twin Oaks]], a contemporary [[intentional community]] of 100 members in [[Virginia]]. All Twin Oaks' buildings are named after communities that are no longer actively functioning, and \"Oneida\" is the name of one of the residences.\n\nThe [[Oneida Community Mansion House]] was listed as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965, and the principal surviving material culture of the Oneida Community consists of those landmarked buildings, object collections, and landscape. The five buildings of the [[Oneida Community Mansion House|Mansion House]], separately designed by Erastus Hamilton, Lewis W. Leeds, and Theodore Skinner, comprise {{convert|93000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} on a 33-acre site. This site has been continuously occupied since the community's establishment in 1848 and the existing Mansion House has been occupied since 1862. Today, the [[Oneida Community Mansion House]] is a non-profit educational organization chartered by the State of New York and welcomes visitors throughout the year with guided tours, programs, and exhibits. It preserves, collects and interprets the intangible and material culture of the Oneida Community and of related themes of the 19th and 20th centuries.

The community believed that [[Jesus]] had already returned in AD 70, making it possible for them to bring about [[Millennialism|Jesus's millennial kingdom]] themselves, and be free of sin and perfect in this world, not just in [[Heaven]] (a belief called ''[[Christian perfection|perfectionism]]''). The Oneida Community practiced [[communalism]] (in the sense of communal property and possessions), [[complex marriage]], [[Coitus reservatus|male sexual continence]], and mutual criticism.  There were smaller Noyesian communities in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]]; [[Newark, New Jersey]]; [[Putney, Vermont|Putney]] and [[Cambridge, Vermont]].{{sfn |Chmielewski |2001 |pp=176\u2013178}} The community's original 87 members grew to 172 by February 1850, 208 by 1852, and 306 by 1878. The branches were closed in 1854 except for the Wallingford branch, which operated until devastated by a [[1878 Wallingford tornado|tornado]] in 1878. The Oneida Community dissolved in 1881, and eventually became the [[Cutlery|silverware]] company [[Oneida Limited]].{{sfn |Hays |1999}}\n\n== Community structure ==\nEven though the community only reached a maximum population of about 300, it had a complex bureaucracy of 27 standing committees and 48 administrative sections.{{sfn |MacHovec |2010}}{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe manufacturing of silverware, the sole remaining industry, began in 1877, relatively late in the life of the community, and still exists.{{sfn |Hays |1999}} Secondary industries included the manufacture of leather travel bags, the weaving of [[palm frond]] hats, the construction of rustic garden furniture, game traps, and tourism.\n\nAll community members were expected to work, each according to his or her abilities. Women tended to do many of the domestic duties.{{sfn |Kern |1981 |p=}}{{Page needed|date=March 2020}} Although more skilled jobs tended to remain with an individual member (the financial manager, for example, held his post throughout the life of the community), community members rotated through the more unskilled jobs, working in the house, the fields, or the various industries. As Oneida thrived, it began to hire outsiders to work in these positions as well. They were a major employer in the area, with approximately 200 employees by 1870.\n\n=== Complex marriage ===\nThe Oneida community strongly believed in a system of [[free love]] (a term which Noyes is credited with coining) which was known as complex marriage,{{sfn |Foster |1997 |p=}} where any member was free to have sex with any other who consented.{{sfn |Stoehr |1979 |p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}} Possessiveness and exclusive relationships were frowned upon.{{sfn |DeMaria |1978 |p=83}} Unlike 20th-century social movements such as the [[Sexual Revolution]] of the 1960s, the Oneidans did not seek consequence-free sex for pleasure, but believed that, because the natural outcome of intercourse was pregnancy, raising children should be a communal responsibility. Women over the age of 40 were to act as sexual \"mentors\" to adolescent boys, because these relationships had a minimal chance of conceiving. Furthermore, these women became religious role models for the young men. Likewise, older men often introduced young women to sex. Noyes often used his own judgment in determining the partnerships that would form, and he would often encourage relationships between the non-devout and the devout in the community, in the hope that the attitudes and behaviors of the devout would influence the attitudes of the non-devout.{{sfn |Noyes |1937 |p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1993, the archives of the community were made available to scholars for the first time. Contained within the archives was the journal of Tirzah Miller,{{sfn |Herrick |Fogarty |2000 |p=}} Noyes' niece, who wrote extensively about her romantic and sexual relations with other members of Oneida.{{sfn |Chmielewski |2001 |pp=176\u2013178}}\n\n=== Mutual criticism ===\nEvery member of the community was subject to criticism by committee or the community as a whole, during a general meeting.{{sfn |Noyes |Oneida Community |1876}} The goal was to eliminate undesirable character traits.{{sfn |Parker |1935 |p=[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015008678768?urlappend=%3Bseq=237 215]}} Various contemporary sources contend that Noyes himself was the subject of criticism, although less often and of probably less severe criticism than the rest of the community. Charles Nordhoff said he had witnessed the criticism of a member he referred to as \"Charles\", writing the following account of the incident:\n\n{{quote|Charles sat speechless, looking before him; but as the accusations multiplied, his face grew paler, and drops of perspiration began to stand on his forehead. The remarks I have reported took up about half an hour; and now, each one in the circle having spoken, Mr. Noyes summed up. He said that Charles had some serious faults; that he had watched him with some care; and that he thought the young man was earnestly trying to cure himself. He spoke in general praise of his ability, his good character, and of certain temptations he had resisted in the course of his life. He thought he saw signs that Charles was making a real and earnest attempt to conquer his faults; and as one evidence of this, he remarked that Charles had lately come to him to consult him upon a difficult case in which he had had a severe struggle, but had in the end succeeded in doing right. \"In the course of what we call stirpiculture\", said Noyes, \"Charles, as you know, is in the situation of one who is by and by to become a father. Under these circumstances, he has fallen under the too common temptation of selfish love, and a desire to wait upon and cultivate an exclusive intimacy with the woman who was to bear a child through him. This is an insidious temptation, very apt to attack people under such circumstances; but it must nevertheless be struggled against.\" Charles, he went on to say, had come to him for advice in this case, and he (Noyes) had at first refused to tell him any thing, but had asked him what he thought he ought to do; that after some conversation, Charles had determined, and he agreed with him, that he ought to isolate himself entirely from the woman, and let another man take his place at her side; and this Charles had accordingly done, with a most praiseworthy spirit of selfsacrifice. Charles had indeed still further taken up his cross, as he had noticed with pleasure, by going to sleep with the smaller children, to take charge of them during the night. Taking all this in view, he thought Charles was in a fair way to become a better man, and had manifested a sincere desire to improve, and to rid himself of all selfish faults.{{sfn |Nordhoff |1875 |pp=[https://archive.org/stream/communisticsoci00nord#page/292/mode/2up 292\u2013293]}}}}\n\n=== Male continence ===\nTo control reproduction within the Oneida community, a system of male continence or [[coitus reservatus]] was enacted.{{sfn |Sandeen |1971}} John Humprey Noyes decided that sexual intercourse served two distinct purposes. In ''Male Continence'', Noyes argues that the method simply \"proposes the subordination of the flesh to the spirit, teaching men to seek principally the elevated spiritual pleasures of sexual connection\".{{sfn |Noyes |1872 |p=[{{Google books|WjvC2hNe4uoC|page=13|plainurl=yes}} 13]}} The primary purpose of male continence was social satisfaction, \"to allow the sexes to communicate and express affection for one another\".{{sfn |Van Wormer |2006}} The second purpose was procreation. Of around two hundred adults using male continence as birth control, there were twelve unplanned births within Oneida between 1848 and 1868,{{sfn |Van Wormer |2006}} indicating that it was a highly effective form of birth control.{{sfn |Foster |1986}}{{rp|18}} Young men were introduced to male continence by women who were post-menopause, and young women were introduced by experienced, older males.{{sfn |Foster |1986}}{{rp|18\u201319}}\n\nNoyes believed that ejaculation \"drained men's vitality and led to disease\"{{sfn |Mandelker |1982 |pp=742\u20133}} and pregnancy and childbirth \"levied a heavy tax on the vitality of women\".{{sfn |Mandelker |1982 |pp=742\u20133}} Noyes founded male continence to spare his wife, Harriet, from more difficult childbirths after five traumatizing births of which four led to the death of the child.{{sfn |Foster |1986}}{{rp|17}} They favored this method of male continence over other methods of birth control because they found it to be natural, healthy and favorable for the development of intimate relationships.{{sfn |Mandelker |1982 |p=743}} Women found increased sexual satisfaction in the practice, and Oneida is regarded as highly unusual in the value they placed on women's sexual satisfaction.{{sfn |Foster |1986}}{{rp|19}} If a male failed he faced public disapproval or private rejection.{{sfn |Mandelker |1982 |p=743}}\n\nIt is unclear whether the practice of male continence led to significant problems. Sociologist Lawrence Foster sees hints in Noyes' letters indicating that masturbation and anti-social withdrawal from community life may have been issues.{{sfn |Foster |1986}}{{rp|19}} Oneida's practice of male continence did not lead to [[impotence]].{{sfn |Foster |1986}}{{rp|18}}\n\n=== Stirpiculture ===\n{{Main|Oneida stirpiculture}}\nStirpiculture was a proto-eugenics program of selective controlled reproduction within the Community devised by Noyes and implemented in 1869.<ref name=\"Q41713204\">{{Cite Q|Q41713204|jstor=658471}}</ref><ref name=\"Q41714157\">{{Cite Q|Q41714157|location=Weston |publisher=M & S Press|isbn=9780877300090}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cis.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1989/1/89.01.04.x.html Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, ''Utopian Communities, 1800\u20131890''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905044850/http://www.cis.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1989/1/89.01.04.x.html |date=September 5, 2006 }}</ref> It was designed to create more spiritually and physically perfect children.<ref>Richards, Martin (2004). \"Perfecting People: Selective Breeding at the Oneida Community (1869\u20131879) and the Eugenics Movement\", ''New Genetics and Society'' '''23''' (1), pp. 47\u201371.</ref> Community members who wished to be parents would go before a committee to be approved and matched based on their spiritual and moral qualities. 53 women and 38 men participated in this program, which necessitated the construction of a new wing of the Oneida Community Mansion House.

Some of these privileges included not having to care for their own children as Oneida had a communal child care system, as well as freedom from unwanted pregnancies with Oneida's [[Coitus reservatus|male continence]] practice. In addition, they were able to wear functional, [[Bloomers (clothing)|Bloomer]]-style clothing and maintain short haircuts. Women were able to participate in practically all types of community work.{{sfn |Foster |1991 |pp=[https://archive.org/details/womenfamilyutopi0000fost/page/91 91\u2013102]}}  While domestic duties remained a primarily female responsibility, women were free to explore positions in business and sales, or as artisans or craftsmen, and many did so, particularly in the late 1860s and early 1870s.{{sfn |Kern |1981 |p=260}} Last, women had an active role in shaping commune policy, participating in the daily religious and business meetings.{{sfn |Foster |1991 |pp=[https://archive.org/details/womenfamilyutopi0000fost/page/91 91\u2013102]}}\n\nThe [[Group marriage|complex marriage]] and free love systems practiced at Oneida further acknowledged female status. Through the complex marriage arrangement, women and men had equal freedom in sexual expression and commitment.{{sfn |Foster |1991 |pp=[https://archive.org/details/womenfamilyutopi0000fost/page/91 91\u2013102]}} Indeed, sexual practices at Oneida accepted female sexuality. A woman's right to satisfying sexual experiences was recognized, and women were encouraged to have orgasms.{{sfn |Kern |1981 |pp=224, 232}} However, a woman's right of refusing a sexual overture was limited depending on the status of the man who made the advance.{{sfn |Kern |1981 |p=241}}\n\nEllen Wayland-Smith, author of \"The Status and Self-Perception of Women in the Oneida Community\", said that men and women had roughly equal status in the community. She points out that while both sexes were ultimately subject to Noyes' vision and will, women did not suffer any undue oppression.{{sfn |Wayland-Smith |1988 |p=49}}\n\n== Interactions with wider society ==\nThe community experienced freedom from wider society. The previously mentioned unorthodox marital, sexual, and religious practices caused them to face some criticism. However, between the community's beginning in the 1850s until the 1870s, their interactions with wider society were mostly favorable. These are the best known instances of conflict and peace resolution.\n\n=== Outsider criticism ===\nIn 1870, a \"nineteenth century cultural critic\" Dr. John B. Ellis wrote a book against Free Love communities that Noyes inspired, including \"[[Anarchism|Individual Sovereigns]], [[Berlin Heights, Ohio|Berlin Heights]] Free Lovers, [[Spiritualists]], [[Women's suffrage in the United States|Advocates of Woman Suffrage]], or Friends of [[Divorce in the United States#19th century|Free Divorce]]\".{{sfn |Ellis |1870 ||pp=10\u201313}}<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Pantaloons in Private Health and Religious Dress Reform before Freedom Dresses|last=Fischer|first=Gayle|publisher=The Kent State University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0873386821|location=Ohio|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pantaloonspowern0000fisc/page/58 58]|url=https://archive.org/details/pantaloonspowern0000fisc/page/58}}</ref> He saw their joint goal to be ending marriage. Dr. Ellis described this as an attack on the prevailing moral order.{{sfn |Ellis |1870 ||pp=10\u201313}}{{Primary source inline|date=April 2018}} Historian Gayle Fischer mentions that Dr. Ellis also criticized Oneida women's clothing as \"healthful' uniforms did not rid Oneida women of their 'peculiar air of unhealthiness' \u2014 brought on by \"sexual excess.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nNoyes responded to Ellis' criticism four years later in a pamphlet, ''Dixon and His Copytists'', where he claimed that Dr. John B. Ellis is a pseudonym for a \"literary gentleman living in the upper part of the city.\"{{sfn |Noyes |1871 |pp=37\u201339}} Noyes argued that AMS press employed the writer after they read a Philadelphia paper article on the community and saw a chance to profit off sensationalist writing.{{sfn |Noyes |1871 |pp=37\u201339}}{{Primary source inline|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Tryphena Hubbard's legal battle ===\nIn Anthony Wonderly\u2019s ''Oneida Utopia'', he covers the 1848-1851 Hubbard affair as a moment where a legal conflict almost ended the group, who were only a mere \"Association\" at the time. Twenty-one year old Tryphena Hubbard learned Noyes\u2019 ideas about marriage and sex through his manuscript ''Bible Argument'' in 1848. She joined the community and became the group's first local convert. Tryphena Hubbard soon married Henry Seymour, a young man in the community.{{sfn |Wonderley |2017 |pp=72\u201374, 137}}\n\nEarly in 1849, Tryphena's father Noahdiah Hubbard learned of the Association's open marriages and demanded his daughter's return. Tryphena refused and for two years Noahdiah \"made a sulking nuisance of himself at the Mansion House.\"{{sfn |Wonderley |2017 |pp=72\u201374, 137}}\n\nAn 1850 criticism of Tryphena mentioned her \"insubordination to the church\" as well as \"excess egotism amounting to insanity.\"{{sfn |Wonderley |2017 |pp=72\u201374, 137}} There was marriage before the community attempted perfectionism and Tryphena's husband's supervision over her was increased along with the \"disciplinary norms of the day, physical punishment.\"{{sfn |Wonderley |2017 |pp=72\u201374, 137}} \n\nIn September 1851 Tryphena began displaying signs of mental illness, \"crying at night, speaking incoherently, and wandering around.\"  Seymour went to the Hubbard family to report their daughter's insanity and both parents were appalled by Seymour's physical violence.{{sfn |Wonderley |2017 |pp=72\u201374, 137}}\n\nOn September 27, 1851, Noahdiah Hubbard lodged assault and battery charges on behalf of his daughter.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=b2SnVuHWIJkC&pg=PR55&dq=Tryphena+Hubbard#v=onepage&q=Tryphena%20Hubbard&f=false|title=Free Love in Utopia: John Humphrey Noyes and the Origin of the Oneida Community|last=Noyes|first=George Wallingford|last2=Foster|first2=Lawrence|date=2001|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252026706|language=en}}</ref>  Seymour was indicted and other community members were served arrest warrants as accessories.{{sfn |Wonderley |2017 |pp=72\u201374, 137}}  \n\nThe case was settled on November 26, 1851. The community agreed to Tryphena's expenses while she was in the asylum and after her release $125 a year if she was well and $200 a year if she remained unwell. The Hubbards eventually accepted a $350 settlement in lieu of long term payments. Tryphena Hubbard eventually returned to Henry Seymour and had a child by him. She died at the age of 49 in 1877.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Decline ==\nThe community lasted until John Humphrey Noyes attempted to pass leadership to his son, Theodore Noyes. This move was unsuccessful because Theodore was an [[agnostic]] and lacked his father's talent for leadership.<ref>Hillebrand, Randall (2003). [http://www.nyhistory.com/central/oneida.htm \"The Oneida Community\"], New York History Net.</ref> The move also divided the community, as Communitarian John Tower attempted to wrest control for himself.{{sfn |MacHovec |2010}}{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nWithin the commune, there was a debate about when children should be initiated into sex, and by whom. There was also much debate about its practices as a whole. The founding members were aging or deceased, and many of the younger communitarians desired to enter into exclusive, traditional marriages.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Roach |first1=Monique Patenaude |date=June 2001 |title=The Loss of Religious Allegiance Among the Youth of the Oneida Community |journal=The Historian |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=787\u2013806 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6563.2001.tb01946.x |jstor=24450501}}</ref>\n\nThe capstone to all these pressures was the campaign by Professor John Mears of [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] against the community. He called for a protest meeting against the Oneida Community; it was attended by forty-seven clergymen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.syr.edu/digital/collections/o/OneidaCommunityCollectionInTheSyracuseUniversityLibrary/|title=The Oneida Community Collection in the Syracuse University Library|work=syr.edu|accessdate=October 3, 2016}}</ref> John Humphrey Noyes was informed by trusted adviser Myron Kinsley that a warrant for his arrest on charges of [[statutory rape]] was imminent. Noyes fled the Oneida Community Mansion House and the country in the middle of a June night in 1879, never to return to the United States. Shortly afterward, he wrote to his followers from [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], recommending that the practice of complex marriage be abandoned.\n\nComplex marriage was abandoned in 1879 following external pressures and the community soon broke apart, with some of the members reorganizing as a [[joint stock company|joint-stock company]]. Marital partners normalized their status with the partners with whom they were cohabiting at the time of the re-organization. Over 70 Community members entered into a traditional marriage in the following year.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, the new company, [[Oneida Limited|Oneida Community Limited]], narrowed their focus to silverware. The animal trap business was sold in 1912, the silk business in 1916, and the canning discontinued as unprofitable in 1915.\n\nThe joint-stock corporation still exists and is a major producer of [[cutlery]] under the brand name \"Oneida Limited\". In September 2004 Oneida Limited announced that it would cease all U.S. manufacturing operations in the beginning of 2005, ending a 124-year tradition. The company continues to design and market products that are manufactured overseas.  The company has been selling off its manufacturing facilities. Most recently, the distribution center in [[Sherrill, New York]], was closed. Administrative offices remain in the Oneida area.\n\nThe last original member of the community, Ella Florence Underwood (1850\u20131950), died on June 25, 1950, in [[Kenwood, New York]], near [[Oneida, New York]].<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Upstate Centenarian is Dead |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1950/06/27/91106370.html |work=The New York Times |agency=Associated Press |page=29 |date=June 27, 1950 |url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>[[Time (magazine)]]; July 3, 1950; Died.

Among those are: ''The Oneida Community: An Autobiography, 1851\u20131876'' and ''The Oneida Community: The Breakup, 1876\u20131881'', both by Constance Noyes Robertson; ''Desire and Duty at Oneida: Tirzah Miller's Intimate Memoir'' and ''Special Love/Special Sex: An Oneida Community Diary'', both by Robert S. Fogarty; ''Without Sin'' by Spencer Klaw; ''Oneida, From Free Love Utopia to the Well-Set Table'' by Ellen Wayland-Smith; and biographical/autobiographic accounts by once-members including Jessie Catherine Kinsley, Corinna Ackley Noyes, George Wallingford Noyes, and Pierrepont B. Noyes.\n\nAn account of the Oneida Community is found in [[Sarah Vowell]]'s book ''[[Assassination Vacation]]''. It discusses the community in general and the membership of [[Charles Guiteau]], for more than five years, in the community (Guiteau later assassinated President [[James A. Garfield]]).  The perfectionist community in [[David Flusfeder]]'s novel ''Pagan House'' (2007) is directly inspired by the Oneida Community. Oneida Community is given tribute at [[Twin Oaks Community|Twin Oaks]], a contemporary [[intentional community]] of 100 members in [[Virginia]]. All Twin Oaks' buildings are named after communities that are no longer actively functioning, and \"Oneida\" is the name of one of the residences.\n\nThe [[Oneida Community Mansion House]] was listed as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965, and the principal surviving material culture of the Oneida Community consists of those landmarked buildings, object collections, and landscape. The five buildings of the [[Oneida Community Mansion House|Mansion House]], separately designed by Erastus Hamilton, Lewis W. Leeds, and Theodore Skinner, comprise {{convert|93000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} on a 33-acre site. This site has been continuously occupied since the community's establishment in 1848 and the existing Mansion House has been occupied since 1862. Today, the [[Oneida Community Mansion House]] is a non-profit educational organization chartered by the State of New York and welcomes visitors throughout the year with guided tours, programs, and exhibits. It preserves, collects and interprets the intangible and material culture of the Oneida Community and of related themes of the 19th and 20th centuries. The Mansion House also houses residential apartments, overnight guest rooms, and meeting space.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Chmielewski|first=Wendy E.|date=2001|title=Review of Desire and Duty at Oneida: Tirzah Miller's Intimate Memoir|journal=Utopian Studies|volume=12|issue=1|pages=176\u2013178|jstor=20718260|oclc=5542766034 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=DeMaria |first=Richard |title=Communal Love at Oneida: A Perfectionist Vision of Authority, Property and Sexual Order |publisher=E.

The fort and other structures within it were built by the [[Bundela]] [[Rajput]]s starting from the early 16th century by King [[Rudra Pratap Singh]] of the [[Orchha State]] and others who followed him.\n\nThe fort complex, which is accessed from an arched causeway, leads to a large gateway. This is followed by a large quadrangular open yard surrounded by palaces. These are Raja Mahal or Raja Mandir, Sheesh Mahal, Jahangir Mahal, a temple, gardens and [[pavilions]]. The battlements of the fort have ornamentation. Notable architectural features in the fort complex are projected balconies, open [[Terrace (building)|flat areas]] and decorated [[jali|latticed]] windows.\n\n==Location==\nThe fort complex is located in the [[Tikamgarh district]] of [[Madhya Pradesh]] in the erstwhile state of Orchha. The fort complex is within an island formed by the confluence of the [[Betwa River]] and Jamni River in Orchha town. Approach to the complex from the eastern part of the market in the town is through a multiple arched bridge with 14 arches built in granite stones.{{sfn|Mookherjee|2013}}{{Sfn|Time Out staff|2010|p=205}}{{Sfn|Data And Expo India Pvt Ltd. staff|2015|p=352}}{{Sfn|Tikamgarh District Administration|(n.d.)}}\n\nOrchha town is approximately {{Convert|80|km}} away from [[Tikamgarh]] town, which is the district headquarters of the district of the same name. [[Jhansi]] town is {{Convert|15|km}} away.

Following this, a new temple known as the [[Chaturbhuj Temple (Orchha)|Chaturbuj Temple]] was approved to be built, and the queen went to [[Ayodhya]] to obtain an image of Lord Rama that was to be enshrined in her new temple. When she came back from Ayodhya with the image of Rama, initially she kept the idol in her palace as the Chaturbuj Temple was still under construction. She was, however, unaware of an injunction that the image to be deified in a temple could not be kept in a palace. Once the temple construction was completed and the idol of the lord had to be moved for installation at the Chatrubhuj Temple, it refused to be shifted from the palace. Hence, instead of the Chaturbhuj Temple, the Rama's idol remained in the palace whereas the Chaturbhuj Temple remained without an idol in its sanctum.

He was eventually able to treat her paralysis, but delayed the treatment as it involved technology he did not invent himself, leaving Lena enraged that he expected her to be forever under his shadow.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''Supergirl: Cosmic Adventures in the Eighth Grade''===\nLena Thorul is a main character in the series. She is Lex Luthor's thirteen-year-old sister who attends the same boarding school as [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]. Lena hates superheroes, and specifically blames Supergirl for the recent misfortune that has befallen her brother (in the first issue Supergirl was accidentally responsible for Lex Luthor's capture). Unaware that Linda Lee is really Supergirl just as Linda is unaware that Lena Thorul is related to Lex Luthor, the two become best friends and roommates. Though sweet and fun when interacting with Linda (whom Lena perceives as an outsider, just like herself), Lena is hostile and suspicious towards everyone else. This is particularly true in regards to Linda's evil doppelganger Belinda Zee (Superiorgirl). As the series progresses, Lena's xenophobia becomes increasingly apparent. It is revealed that Lena is in secret communication with her older brother, waiting for the correct time to enact a complicated revenge scheme against Superman. When Linda'a identity is inadvertently exposed to Lena by the time-lost duplicate of Supergirl known as Supragirl, Lena goes over the edge and takes control of the minds of half the students in the school (the other half being transformed into [[Bizarro]] versions of themselves by Superiorgirl). Lena begins to question her hatred when confronted by the manipulations of reality by Mister [[Mxyzptlk]] and by Supergirl's willingness to save all of reality from the 5th dimensional imp. While Supergirl is battling Mxyzptlk, Lena is critically injured. Supergirl forces a truce between Luthor and Superman so that they can save Lena. Luthor saves his little sister, but the cost of her survival is that her hatred is now directed at her own brother. At the series end, Lena is referenced to be recovering in the hospital.\n\n===Lena Luthor (Earth-9)===\nA variation of the character appears in ''[[Tangent Comics]]: [[Wonder Woman]]'' #1 (September, 1998). Lena Thorul was an Element Girl scientist who saw the inevitable futility of the gender war between the Element Girl and Beast Boy Gothamites, in which she felt the Gothamites had lost touch with each other and with their true potential. That they were stronger as a race when the two sexes truly comprehend each other. Thorul sought to create a symbol of what the Gothamites could be if they were united as a people, through the use of outlawed technology, she successfully created a unique and powerful female Gothamite with the attributes of both the Element Girls and Beast Boys which she named her as Wanda. Upon revealing Wanda to the Gothamites as a symbol of unity, however, this was greeted with revulsion from the Gothamites who ironically agreed together that Wanda was an abomination and Thorul was immediately killed for creating her.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Live action===\n* Lena Luthor appeared in the ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' TV series two-part story \"Know Thine Enemy\" with the young version played by Jennifer Hawkins and the adult version played by Denise Gossett. In the first part, Lena appears in flashbacks of Lex Luthor's childhood while Superboy experiences Lex's life through a device Luthor invented called a \"psychodisk\". Frequently abused by their father, Lex is very protective of Lena and tries to stop their father from beating her only to get a beating himself. Lex and Lena dream of one day escaping from their less-than-perfect home life. Eventually, Lex urges Lena to go spend the night at a friend's house and builds a bomb with which he plans to kill his parents while Lena is away. He has taken out a life insurance policy on them and plans to collect it after their deaths. He eventually does kill them, though the scene is not depicted because Superboy escapes the psychodisk recording before it can happen. In the second part, it revealed that Lena faked her own death and changed her name to escape the curse of the Luthor name but is found by [[Lana Lang]]. Her apparent death has driven Lex over the edge, causing him to construct a series of bombs that will wipe out all life on earth, leaving only android duplicates of himself and Lena on the planet. Because Lena is the only person Luthor claims to have ever loved, Lana believes she can stop his mad plan. Lena is taken to Luthor's underground hideout and attempts to get him to stop the countdown on his bombs. Luthor denies that he ever loved Lena, but the android duplicate of Lex stops the countdown with seconds to spare and attempts to get Lena to stay with him so they can have the better life they had always dreamed of. Lex deactivates the android and Lena leaves, never to be seen again.\n\n[[File:Lutessa Lena Luthor (Tess Mercer)-.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cassidy Freeman]] as [[Characters of Smallville#Tess Mercer|Tess Mercer]] (Lutessa Lena Luthor) in ''[[Smallville]]''.]]\n* A character based in Lena Luthor named '''[[Characters of Smallville#Tess Mercer|Tess Mercer]]''' appears in ''[[Smallville]]'' portrayed by [[Cassidy Freeman]] and Leigh Bourke (young). The [[Smallville (season 10)|final season]] of ''[[Smallville]]'' reveals that Tess Mercer is really '''Lutessa Lena Luthor'''. [[Lionel Luthor]] left Lutessa at [[Granny Goodness]]'s orphanage where Granny's powers were used to suppress Lutessa's memories of her true identity and was eventually adopted by the Mercers of Louisiana under her father's arrangements. In the episode \"Abandoned\", Tess eventually learns the truth of her past once she reviews the orphanage's records and is distraught knowing that she's Lionel's daughter. The result of an affair he had with Lex's nanny, Pamela Jenkins (who had appeared in the season 1 episode \"Crush\")<ref>{{cite episode|title=Abandoned|series=Smallville|credits=Drew Landis, Julia Swift (writers) & Kevin Fair (director)|network=The CW|airdate=November 12, 2010|season=10|number=8}}</ref> In the series finale, Tess discovers that [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] knew they are siblings all along. When Lex mortally stabs her (claiming it will save her from becoming like her brother), Tess infects Lex with a neurotoxin that erases all memories, informing her brother as she dies that [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] had already saved her from that fate. In 2012, the television series was continued through the comic book medium. Written by [[Bryan Q.

As the new CEO of Luthor Corp following her brother's incarceration, Lena moves to National City and rebrands the company as \"L-Corp\" to distance it and herself from Lex's reputation.<ref name=\"TVL\" /> Lex hires the assassin [[Metallo|John Corben]] to kill her in retaliation, but Lena shoots him to save [[Alex Danvers]]. She later helps Kara Danvers find [[Roulette (DC Comics)|Veronica Sinclair]], and in turn, Kara goes to a gala being held at L-Corp (as herself and Supergirl), later discovered to be a trap to robbers involved in a crime wave involving alien guns. Soon after, it is discovered that her mother was none other than the director of [[Project Cadmus]], who plans to wipe out the entire alien race with an airborne substance. Lena turns on Lillian right before they are about to go through with the plan before revealing she switched out the substance and called the police. In the episode \"[[Luthors]]\", Lena discovers she is the product of an affair Lionel had with his mistress before being framed by her mother for stealing kryptonite. She was then kidnapped by Lillian, ensuring the latter's escape alongside that of Metallo so she can use her to access one of Lex Luthor's storage areas before being recused by Supergirl. In the episode \"[[Ace Reporter]]\", Lena reunites with her ex-boyfriend Jack Speer, who is the CEO of Spheerical Industries and has invented a new nanobot technology called Biomax. When Kara discovers that Jack had been faking the human trials and injected himself with Biomax, Lena confronts him, only to find out he is being controlled by his CFO, Beth Breen. While Supergirl fights Jack, Lena fights Breen and destroys the control device and overloads the mainframe to save Supergirl, causing Jack to die, leaving Lena devastated. Later, Lena agrees to work with Rhea, unaware of her alien heritage, on a business project, a transmitter portal. Lena ends up forming a motherly bond with Rhea, who encourages her to be different than her family. Lena then finds out Rhea is an alien after she uses an alien element to finish the portal, but Rhea manages to convince her to continue working with her. Rhea then betrays Lena and uses the portal to bring her [[Daxam]]ite fleet to Earth, then transports Lena and Mon-El to her ship. In the episode \"[[Resist (Supergirl)|Resist]]\", Rhea forces Lena and Mon-El to get married, but they are saved by Supergirl, Lillian, and [[Cyborg Superman]]. In \"[[Nevertheless, She Persisted (Supergirl)|Nevertheless, She Persisted]]\", Lillian then reveals a device that Lex created to kill Kryptonians, but Lena and Winn modify it to kill Daxamites, killing Rhea and causing the fleet to retreat, saving the Earth. During Season Three, Lena Luthor develops a rivalry with [[Morgan Edge]]. When Morgan Edge poisoned Lena in the episode \"For Good\", Lilian Luthor plans revenge by targeting Morgan Edge. After Lena is cured of the poison, she has a moment with her mother as Lilian and Morgan are arrested by the authorities upon their respective defeats at the hands of Supergirl.\n\n===Animation===\n* [[Romi Dames]] voices Lena Luthor in the webseries ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]''. While she is depicted as the sister of Lex Luthor, this version is a supervillain. In ''[[DC Super Hero Girls: Intergalactic Games]]'', she is revealed to be resentful of the supers from Superhero High, Lena's particularly envious of Supergirl as she gained her powers when she landed on Earth while she had tried to do everything to gain her own powers, losing her hair (revealed to be a wig) in one of the processes. She is defeated by [[Wonder Woman]] and Platinum, who she uses for her plan. After failing her master Brainiac, she is left to drown in the truck taking her away. [[Big Barda]] saves her in exchange for help, but she turns her down. Lena is taken to prison afterwards.\n** Dames reprises her role in the ''Lego DC Super Hero Girls'' series as the main antagonist. Unlike the main series, instead of avenging her brother's arrest at the hands of the heroes, she wishes to surpass him as a true supervillain, but she never succeeds. She's developed a series of kriptomites with one of six different colors each, which effect everyone that comes near them by changing their emotions, such as anger, sadness, fear, distrust and forgetfulness, while the green ones only act as normal kryptonite that only affect Supergirl. She's usually seen assisting the Female Furies and Eclipso, though the latter of which Lena always hinders her plans in the end, hindering her own plan in the process.\n* [[Cassandra Lee Morris]] voices Lena Luthor in the premiere of the 2019 ''DC Super Hero Girls'' [[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|TV series]]. She is again depicted both as the sister of Lex Luthor and as a villain, this time as a child. Her villainous ways in this version are not because of her brother, but in spite of him, and every other teenager. She desires to create a world solely run by children, while teenagers and adults remain under her control after destroying their favorite places. Ultimately her plan is failed and her parents take her away. Her mother reveals that, her full name is once again Lutessa \"Lena\" Luthor, but chooses to go by Lena.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\nLena Luthor appears in the second ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' DC Comics Special ''[[Robot Chicken DC Comics Special 2: Villains in Paradise]]'', voiced by [[Sarah Hyland]], and is portrayed as Lex Luthor's daughter, instead of his sister. Lex Luthor has her interning at the [[Legion of Doom]]'s coffee shop called \"Hall of Doom Coffee\" during spring break since the court order says that Lex gets custody of Lena on weekends and holidays. Her plight of having to work on spring break and not being with her boyfriend is understood by [[Gorilla Grodd]] as they follow each other on a social network. When Lex finds out that Lena has snuck away to go to spring break to be with her boyfriend upon finding [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]'s nephew Calvin working in Lena's place, Lex pilots the Hall of Doom to a beach location to find her while the other Legion of Doom members take advantage by taking a vacation. Lex finds out that Lena's boyfriend is Superboy when he finds her after an incident where some of the Legion of Doom members mistook the Justice League's private beach for a [[nude beach]]. As Lex tells Lena that she is not to see Superboy again, Superman tells Superboy never to see Lena again. Both Lena and Superboy tell about their love romance for each other to the other heroes and villains in a song parody of \"[[Summer Nights (Grease song)|Summer Nights]]\". As the Justice League and the Legion of Doom argue about Superboy and Lena's relationship, the group is attacked by an enlarged [[Starro]] (which was previously flushed down the Hall of Doom's toilet by [[Captain Cold]]). Starro attacked both sides and overwhelmed them until seeing Lena and Superboy in a romantic moment and stopped attacking which ended with Starro getting killed upon [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] sending a boat construct with [[Batman]] in it through Starro. Lena and Superboy are later seen at the wedding of Gorilla Grodd and [[Bizarro]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://superman.nu/wiki/index.php/Lena_Thorul Short biography on Lena Thorul] \u2013 From Supermanica\n* [http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/who/who-intro.php?topic=luthor-lena Short biography on Lena Luthor] \u2013 From Supermanhomepage\n{{Superman characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Luthor, Lena}}\n[[Category:DC Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1961]]\n[[Category:Female characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional empaths]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Kansas]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jerry Siegel]]\n[[Category:DC Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Female characters in animation]]\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox comics character<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| image = Lena Luthor (circa 2016).png\n| caption = Lena Luthor in ''Superwoman'' #3 (October 2016).

Lena begins to question her hatred when confronted by the manipulations of reality by Mister [[Mxyzptlk]] and by Supergirl's willingness to save all of reality from the 5th dimensional imp. While Supergirl is battling Mxyzptlk, Lena is critically injured. Supergirl forces a truce between Luthor and Superman so that they can save Lena. Luthor saves his little sister, but the cost of her survival is that her hatred is now directed at her own brother. At the series end, Lena is referenced to be recovering in the hospital.\n\n===Lena Luthor (Earth-9)===\nA variation of the character appears in ''[[Tangent Comics]]: [[Wonder Woman]]'' #1 (September, 1998). Lena Thorul was an Element Girl scientist who saw the inevitable futility of the gender war between the Element Girl and Beast Boy Gothamites, in which she felt the Gothamites had lost touch with each other and with their true potential. That they were stronger as a race when the two sexes truly comprehend each other. Thorul sought to create a symbol of what the Gothamites could be if they were united as a people, through the use of outlawed technology, she successfully created a unique and powerful female Gothamite with the attributes of both the Element Girls and Beast Boys which she named her as Wanda. Upon revealing Wanda to the Gothamites as a symbol of unity, however, this was greeted with revulsion from the Gothamites who ironically agreed together that Wanda was an abomination and Thorul was immediately killed for creating her.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Live action===\n* Lena Luthor appeared in the ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' TV series two-part story \"Know Thine Enemy\" with the young version played by Jennifer Hawkins and the adult version played by Denise Gossett. In the first part, Lena appears in flashbacks of Lex Luthor's childhood while Superboy experiences Lex's life through a device Luthor invented called a \"psychodisk\". Frequently abused by their father, Lex is very protective of Lena and tries to stop their father from beating her only to get a beating himself. Lex and Lena dream of one day escaping from their less-than-perfect home life. Eventually, Lex urges Lena to go spend the night at a friend's house and builds a bomb with which he plans to kill his parents while Lena is away. He has taken out a life insurance policy on them and plans to collect it after their deaths. He eventually does kill them, though the scene is not depicted because Superboy escapes the psychodisk recording before it can happen. In the second part, it revealed that Lena faked her own death and changed her name to escape the curse of the Luthor name but is found by [[Lana Lang]]. Her apparent death has driven Lex over the edge, causing him to construct a series of bombs that will wipe out all life on earth, leaving only android duplicates of himself and Lena on the planet. Because Lena is the only person Luthor claims to have ever loved, Lana believes she can stop his mad plan. Lena is taken to Luthor's underground hideout and attempts to get him to stop the countdown on his bombs. Luthor denies that he ever loved Lena, but the android duplicate of Lex stops the countdown with seconds to spare and attempts to get Lena to stay with him so they can have the better life they had always dreamed of. Lex deactivates the android and Lena leaves, never to be seen again.\n\n[[File:Lutessa Lena Luthor (Tess Mercer)-.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cassidy Freeman]] as [[Characters of Smallville#Tess Mercer|Tess Mercer]] (Lutessa Lena Luthor) in ''[[Smallville]]''.]]\n* A character based in Lena Luthor named '''[[Characters of Smallville#Tess Mercer|Tess Mercer]]''' appears in ''[[Smallville]]'' portrayed by [[Cassidy Freeman]] and Leigh Bourke (young).

As the new CEO of Luthor Corp following her brother's incarceration, Lena moves to National City and rebrands the company as \"L-Corp\" to distance it and herself from Lex's reputation.<ref name=\"TVL\" /> Lex hires the assassin [[Metallo|John Corben]] to kill her in retaliation, but Lena shoots him to save [[Alex Danvers]]. She later helps Kara Danvers find [[Roulette (DC Comics)|Veronica Sinclair]], and in turn, Kara goes to a gala being held at L-Corp (as herself and Supergirl), later discovered to be a trap to robbers involved in a crime wave involving alien guns. Soon after, it is discovered that her mother was none other than the director of [[Project Cadmus]], who plans to wipe out the entire alien race with an airborne substance. Lena turns on Lillian right before they are about to go through with the plan before revealing she switched out the substance and called the police. In the episode \"[[Luthors]]\", Lena discovers she is the product of an affair Lionel had with his mistress before being framed by her mother for stealing kryptonite. She was then kidnapped by Lillian, ensuring the latter's escape alongside that of Metallo so she can use her to access one of Lex Luthor's storage areas before being recused by Supergirl. In the episode \"[[Ace Reporter]]\", Lena reunites with her ex-boyfriend Jack Speer, who is the CEO of Spheerical Industries and has invented a new nanobot technology called Biomax. When Kara discovers that Jack had been faking the human trials and injected himself with Biomax, Lena confronts him, only to find out he is being controlled by his CFO, Beth Breen. While Supergirl fights Jack, Lena fights Breen and destroys the control device and overloads the mainframe to save Supergirl, causing Jack to die, leaving Lena devastated. Later, Lena agrees to work with Rhea, unaware of her alien heritage, on a business project, a transmitter portal. Lena ends up forming a motherly bond with Rhea, who encourages her to be different than her family. Lena then finds out Rhea is an alien after she uses an alien element to finish the portal, but Rhea manages to convince her to continue working with her. Rhea then betrays Lena and uses the portal to bring her [[Daxam]]ite fleet to Earth, then transports Lena and Mon-El to her ship. In the episode \"[[Resist (Supergirl)|Resist]]\", Rhea forces Lena and Mon-El to get married, but they are saved by Supergirl, Lillian, and [[Cyborg Superman]]. In \"[[Nevertheless, She Persisted (Supergirl)|Nevertheless, She Persisted]]\", Lillian then reveals a device that Lex created to kill Kryptonians, but Lena and Winn modify it to kill Daxamites, killing Rhea and causing the fleet to retreat, saving the Earth. During Season Three, Lena Luthor develops a rivalry with [[Morgan Edge]]. When Morgan Edge poisoned Lena in the episode \"For Good\", Lilian Luthor plans revenge by targeting Morgan Edge. After Lena is cured of the poison, she has a moment with her mother as Lilian and Morgan are arrested by the authorities upon their respective defeats at the hands of Supergirl.\n\n===Animation===\n* [[Romi Dames]] voices Lena Luthor in the webseries ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]''. While she is depicted as the sister of Lex Luthor, this version is a supervillain. In ''[[DC Super Hero Girls: Intergalactic Games]]'', she is revealed to be resentful of the supers from Superhero High, Lena's particularly envious of Supergirl as she gained her powers when she landed on Earth while she had tried to do everything to gain her own powers, losing her hair (revealed to be a wig) in one of the processes. She is defeated by [[Wonder Woman]] and Platinum, who she uses for her plan. After failing her master Brainiac, she is left to drown in the truck taking her away. [[Big Barda]] saves her in exchange for help, but she turns her down. Lena is taken to prison afterwards.\n** Dames reprises her role in the ''Lego DC Super Hero Girls'' series as the main antagonist. Unlike the main series, instead of avenging her brother's arrest at the hands of the heroes, she wishes to surpass him as a true supervillain, but she never succeeds. She's developed a series of kriptomites with one of six different colors each, which effect everyone that comes near them by changing their emotions, such as anger, sadness, fear, distrust and forgetfulness, while the green ones only act as normal kryptonite that only affect Supergirl. She's usually seen assisting the Female Furies and Eclipso, though the latter of which Lena always hinders her plans in the end, hindering her own plan in the process.\n* [[Cassandra Lee Morris]] voices Lena Luthor in the premiere of the 2019 ''DC Super Hero Girls'' [[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|TV series]]. She is again depicted both as the sister of Lex Luthor and as a villain, this time as a child. Her villainous ways in this version are not because of her brother, but in spite of him, and every other teenager. She desires to create a world solely run by children, while teenagers and adults remain under her control after destroying their favorite places. Ultimately her plan is failed and her parents take her away. Her mother reveals that, her full name is once again Lutessa \"Lena\" Luthor, but chooses to go by Lena.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\nLena Luthor appears in the second ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' DC Comics Special ''[[Robot Chicken DC Comics Special 2: Villains in Paradise]]'', voiced by [[Sarah Hyland]], and is portrayed as Lex Luthor's daughter, instead of his sister. Lex Luthor has her interning at the [[Legion of Doom]]'s coffee shop called \"Hall of Doom Coffee\" during spring break since the court order says that Lex gets custody of Lena on weekends and holidays. Her plight of having to work on spring break and not being with her boyfriend is understood by [[Gorilla Grodd]] as they follow each other on a social network. When Lex finds out that Lena has snuck away to go to spring break to be with her boyfriend upon finding [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]'s nephew Calvin working in Lena's place, Lex pilots the Hall of Doom to a beach location to find her while the other Legion of Doom members take advantage by taking a vacation. Lex finds out that Lena's boyfriend is Superboy when he finds her after an incident where some of the Legion of Doom members mistook the Justice League's private beach for a [[nude beach]]. As Lex tells Lena that she is not to see Superboy again, Superman tells Superboy never to see Lena again. Both Lena and Superboy tell about their love romance for each other to the other heroes and villains in a song parody of \"[[Summer Nights (Grease song)|Summer Nights]]\". As the Justice League and the Legion of Doom argue about Superboy and Lena's relationship, the group is attacked by an enlarged [[Starro]] (which was previously flushed down the Hall of Doom's toilet by [[Captain Cold]]). Starro attacked both sides and overwhelmed them until seeing Lena and Superboy in a romantic moment and stopped attacking which ended with Starro getting killed upon [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] sending a boat construct with [[Batman]] in it through Starro. Lena and Superboy are later seen at the wedding of Gorilla Grodd and [[Bizarro]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://superman.nu/wiki/index.php/Lena_Thorul Short biography on Lena Thorul] \u2013 From Supermanica\n* [http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/who/who-intro.php?topic=luthor-lena Short biography on Lena Luthor] \u2013 From Supermanhomepage\n{{Superman characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Luthor, Lena}}\n[[Category:DC Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1961]]\n[[Category:Female characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional empaths]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Kansas]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jerry Siegel]]\n[[Category:DC Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Female characters in animation]]\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\n", "name_user": "2003:d4:e729:7600:b95a:bb20:ae71:7937", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lena_Luthor"}

Originally published in 1973, the book by Christopher Finch, Art of Walt Disney, is about the innovations of [[Walt Disney]] and it has been revised and expanded many different times and with in these many times, his definition of \u201cArt\u201d is always changing.

He moved to [[Marceline, Missouri]] with his family as a young child. He had four siblings who later aided in his successful company. Not long after, Walt began drawing and painting, even going so far as to paint farm animals on the side of his family\u2019s home<ref name=\"Historical\">{{cite web|title=Walt Disney (1901 - 1966)|url=https://shsmo.org/historicmissourians/name/d/disney/#references|website=The State Historical Society of Missouri|accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref>. Four years later, his father fell sick and the family moved again to Kansas City. Walt had to help, at age nine, deliver newspapers with his father in the hours before school, however he still continued his passion for art. As he got older, he continued with his drawing and started selling his pictures to neighbors and friends. In high school, His family then moved back to Chicago where Walt was an active member of his school\u2019s newspaper, whom he drew cartoons for<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://historicmissourians.shsmo.org/historicmissourians/name/d/disney/|title=Walt Disney - Historic Missourians - The State Historical Society of Missouri|website=historicmissourians.shsmo.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>, while also dividing much of his time to photography<ref>{{cite web|title=Walt Disney, Biography|url=http://www.justdisney.com/walt_disney/biography/long_bio.html|website=Just Disney|accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref>. In 1917, he joined efforts in Europe during World War I then returned ultimately to Kansas City to graduate high school and start his first animation series. After meeting his life long friend Ub Iwerks, [[File:Disney drawing goofy.jpg|thumb|Walt Disney drawing Goofy]]As a young adult, Walt not only continued his drawing and painting, but also starting working with animation and made short animated videos for the company he worked for at the time, Pesman-Rubin Commercial Art Studio. Walt eventually left that company due to layoffs, and instead decided with his friend, [[Ub Iwerks]], to start their own company called Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists. Unfortunately, Walt and Ub\u2019s company did not last very long, and they soon found new jobs at a new company, the Kansas City Film Ad Company, formally known as the Kansas City Slide Company. Here, Walt learned even more about the art of animation, and contributed to creating commercials that played before movies. It was not long after when Walt decided to leave the Kansas City Film Ad Company to start another one of his own, called [[Laugh-O-Gram Films]], where he created his first popular cartoon called [[Alice\u2019s Wonderland]], which turned into a series called [[Alice Comedies]]. Unfortunately for Walt, not enough money was coming in, which lead to many of his employees quitting his company, and forcing him to declare bankruptcy<ref name=\"Historical\" />. He moved to Hollywood and started the Disney Brothers Studio.  \n\nIn 1927, Walt created a new character called ''Oswald the Lucky Rabbit'', which also became popular. However, the distributor he was working with at the time, [[Charles Mintz]], hired all of Walt\u2019s animation employees and told him that he had no rights to Oswald, because the cartoon was not copyrighted under Walt\u2019s name. After, Walt, his brother [[Roy O. Disney]], and Ub Iwerks, came together to create all new characters, all of which Walt was going to make sure he owned. [[Mickey Mouse]] was soon developed, a character Walt had been inspired to create just from a simple pet mouse he once had in his office back in Missouri<ref name=\"Historical\" />. He had to go through many hurdles with Charles Mintz, Walt's distributor, before winning the rights to his character. The name of his company was changed to The Walt Disney Studio the same year he married Lillian Bounds with whom he had two daughters, Sharon and Diane. During World War II he produced fan favorites such as ''Fantasia, Pinocchio, Dumbo, and Bambi.'' He continued to have monumental success into he 1950's and 60's.  He holds the record for most Academy Awards won, the George Washington Award, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Lyndon B Johnson.  He helped established the California Institute of the Arts in 1961. Five years later, in 1966, he passed away due to long cancer, but his work and legacy live on. \n\n== The Art of Walt Disney Contents <ref>{{Cite book|last=Finch|first=Christopher|title=The Art of Walt Disney: From Mickey Mouse to the Magic Kingdoms|publisher=Portland House|year=1988|isbn=0517664747|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> ==\nPart I: A New Art Form \n\n# Early Enterprises\n# Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies \n# Six Cartoon Classics\n# Hyperion Days \n\nPart II: Feature Animation\n\n# Snow White: The First Feature \n# Pinocchio\n# Fantasia: The Great Experiment\n# Dumbo and Bambi\n# Interruptions and Innovations\n# Later Animation\n\nPart III: Live Action Films \n\n# Actors and Animals\n# Davy Crockett, Other Heroes and Mary Poppins \n\nPart IV: The Magic Kingdoms \n\n# Beyond Film: Disneyland and Walt Disney World \n\n== Details of Above Works ==\nDisney's Silly Symphonies (1928-1934) featured Mickey Mouse and other characters to present color cartoons and short films by Walt Disney.

The first books he published were a collection of essays based on his work with artists and pop artists: ''Pop Art: Object & Image, Image as Language: Aspects of British Art,'' and a monograph about the work of Patrick Caulfield. Later, he became an associate curator at the Walker Art Center before going to New York to continue writing.  This is where he began the work ''The Art of Walt Disney'' and many other distinguished titles. After a long break from making art himself, in 1984 he returned to making graphics, photography, and paintings, some of which were featured in multiple galleries around the United States. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://christopher-finch.com/cfpages/about/bio/bio.html|title=Christopher Finch's Biography|website=christopher-finch.com|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> \n\n==History==\nAfter Walt Disney became famous for his achievements, Christopher Finch decided to make a book called \"Art of Walt Disney\". Originally published in 1973, the book by Christopher Finch, Art of Walt Disney, is about the innovations of [[Walt Disney]] and it has been revised and expanded many different times and with in these many times, his definition of \u201cArt\u201d is always changing. This expansive revision of the 1973 edition contains seven additional chapters, with color illustrations, on Disney films such as ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' and ''[[The Lion King]]''.\n\n==Background of Disney and His Art==\n[[Walter Elias Disney]] was born on December 5th, 1901 in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. He moved to [[Marceline, Missouri]] with his family as a young child. He had four siblings who later aided in his successful company. Not long after, Walt began drawing and painting, even going so far as to paint farm animals on the side of his family\u2019s home<ref name=\"Historical\">{{cite web|title=Walt Disney (1901 - 1966)|url=https://shsmo.org/historicmissourians/name/d/disney/#references|website=The State Historical Society of Missouri|accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref>. Four years later, his father fell sick and the family moved again to Kansas City. Walt had to help, at age nine, deliver newspapers with his father in the hours before school, however he still continued his passion for art. As he got older, he continued with his drawing and started selling his pictures to neighbors and friends. In high school, His family then moved back to Chicago where Walt was an active member of his school\u2019s newspaper, whom he drew cartoons for<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://historicmissourians.shsmo.org/historicmissourians/name/d/disney/|title=Walt Disney - Historic Missourians - The State Historical Society of Missouri|website=historicmissourians.shsmo.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>, while also dividing much of his time to photography<ref>{{cite web|title=Walt Disney, Biography|url=http://www.justdisney.com/walt_disney/biography/long_bio.html|website=Just Disney|accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref>. In 1917, he joined efforts in Europe during World War I then returned ultimately to Kansas City to graduate high school and start his first animation series. After meeting his life long friend Ub Iwerks, [[File:Disney drawing goofy.jpg|thumb|Walt Disney drawing Goofy]]As a young adult, Walt not only continued his drawing and painting, but also starting working with animation and made short animated videos for the company he worked for at the time, Pesman-Rubin Commercial Art Studio. Walt eventually left that company due to layoffs, and instead decided with his friend, [[Ub Iwerks]], to start their own company called Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists. Unfortunately, Walt and Ub\u2019s company did not last very long, and they soon found new jobs at a new company, the Kansas City Film Ad Company, formally known as the Kansas City Slide Company. Here, Walt learned even more about the art of animation, and contributed to creating commercials that played before movies. It was not long after when Walt decided to leave the Kansas City Film Ad Company to start another one of his own, called [[Laugh-O-Gram Films]], where he created his first popular cartoon called [[Alice\u2019s Wonderland]], which turned into a series called [[Alice Comedies]]. Unfortunately for Walt, not enough money was coming in, which lead to many of his employees quitting his company, and forcing him to declare bankruptcy<ref name=\"Historical\" />. He moved to Hollywood and started the Disney Brothers Studio.  \n\nIn 1927, Walt created a new character called ''Oswald the Lucky Rabbit'', which also became popular. However, the distributor he was working with at the time, [[Charles Mintz]], hired all of Walt\u2019s animation employees and told him that he had no rights to Oswald, because the cartoon was not copyrighted under Walt\u2019s name. After, Walt, his brother [[Roy O. Disney]], and Ub Iwerks, came together to create all new characters, all of which Walt was going to make sure he owned. [[Mickey Mouse]] was soon developed, a character Walt had been inspired to create just from a simple pet mouse he once had in his office back in Missouri<ref name=\"Historical\" />. He had to go through many hurdles with Charles Mintz, Walt's distributor, before winning the rights to his character. The name of his company was changed to The Walt Disney Studio the same year he got married to Lillian Bounds with whom he had two daughters, Sharon and Diane. During World War II he produced fan favorites such as ''Fantasia, Pinocchio, Dumbo, and Bambi.'' He continued to have monumental success into he 1950's and 60's.  He holds the record for most Academy Awards won, the George Washington Award, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Lyndon B Johnson.  He helped established the California Institute of the Arts in 1961. Five years later, in 1966, he passed away due to long cancer, but his work and legacy live on. \n\n== The Art of Walt Disney Contents <ref>{{Cite book|last=Finch|first=Christopher|title=The Art of Walt Disney: From Mickey Mouse to the Magic Kingdoms|publisher=Portland House|year=1988|isbn=0517664747|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> ==\nPart I: A New Art Form \n\n# Early Enterprises\n# Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies \n# Six Cartoon Classics\n# Hyperion Days \n\nPart II: Feature Animation\n\n# Snow White: The First Feature \n# Pinocchio\n# Fantasia: The Great Experiment\n# Dumbo and Bambi\n# Interruptions and Innovations\n# Later Animation\n\nPart III: Live Action Films \n\n# Actors and Animals\n# Davy Crockett, Other Heroes and Mary Poppins \n\nPart IV: The Magic Kingdoms \n\n# Beyond Film: Disneyland and Walt Disney World \n\n== Details of Above Works ==\nDisney's Silly Symphonies (1928-1934) featured Mickey Mouse and other characters to present color cartoons and short films by Walt Disney.
