The very first, possibly from the whole area, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of the area's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nJan was followed by the Tichacek family to St. Louis in 1857 and Jan \"John Adam\" Stupka (1825-1914) who settled in [[Monmouth, Iowa]] around 1859. Immigration slowed because of the [[American Civil War]] in which Duban served in the [[Union Army|Union army]]. This lasted until the later half of the 1860s.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi.

This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice. The grave of Ladislav Stehl\u00edk is decorated with a bust by sculptor B\u0159etislav Benda.\n\nBlanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 (1933) - historian\n\nArt historian, journalist PhDr. Blanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 Csc.

The very first, possibly from the whole area, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of the area's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nJan was followed by the Tichacek family to St. Louis in 1857 and Jan \"John Adam\" Stupka (1825-1914) who settled in [[Monmouth, Iowa]] around 1859. Immigration slowed because of the [[American Civil War]] in which Duban served in the [[Union Army|Union army]]. This lasted until the later half of the 1860s.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi. From May 1930 until the liberation in 1945, ie for fifteen years, he worked as a teacher in the village of \u0160umava at the elementary school in Mysl\u00edv, Klatovy.\n\nLadislav Stehl\u00edk's Mysl\u00edv stay inspired him to write six poetry collections. This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession.

Vegetation cover is mainly wind-pruned heath or dense bracken and bramble with a small area of coastal grassland formed over blown sand which has accumulated near the bar.\n\nIn 2013 the Isles of Scilly Seabird Recovery Project was set up by a number of organisations including the RSPB  and the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust. The five-year project aims to keep the islands of [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] and Gugh [[brown rat]] (''Rattus norvegicus'') free, to help breeding sea birds, which lost 25% of their populations between 1983 and 2006. The rats eat eggs and kill the chicks of those birds that nest in burrows or on the ground. Rat removal began in October 2013 by a team of 30 volunteers led by Wildlife Management International Limited (WMIL) of [[New Zealand]], and there has been no signs of rats on St Agnes and Gugh since December 2013.

The three dominant species on the heath are heather (''[[Calluna|Calluna vulgaris]]''), bell heather (''[[Erica|Erica cinerea]]'') and western gorse (''[[Ulex gallii]]''). Immediately above the bar is a small area of dune grassland merging into maritime grassland around the coastal fringe. On the small dune system grows western clover (''[[Trifolium occidentale]]''), sea holly (''[[Eryngium maritimum]]''), sea spurge (''[[Euphorbia paralias]]'') and Portland spurge (''[[Euphorbia portlandica]]''), wild thyme (''[[Thymus polytrichus]]'') and sea bindweed (''[[Calystegia soldanella]]''). The neck of the island between the two hills where the farm was located has an unusual flora. Amongst dense bracken is balm-leaved figwort (''[[Scrophularia scorodonia]]''), common here but not found elsewhere on the island and an unidentified yellow, cultivated rose. A second alien, Argentine dock (''[[Rumex frutescens]]'') grows on the edge of a sand pit which was originally intended to be a reservoir. The fields below the two houses were, before 1933, fertilised with \"[[shoddy]]\" \u2013 a high nitrate manure derived from the woollen industry. Within these fields can be found viper\u2019s-bugloss (''[[Echium vulgare]]''), common melilot (''[[Melilotus officinalis]]'') and wild mignonette (''[[Reseda lutea]]''). All three are thought to be imported arable weeds. In the 1960s the \"neck\" was a closely cropped sward of grass but after [[myxomatosis]] the area became overgrown with bracken and bramble.\n\nIn October, 1972 a fire on Kittern Hill burnt through the shallow peaty soil to the granite. Bleached stones and blackened gorse stems can still be seen and the vegetation has not recovered sufficiently to equal the waved heath elsewhere on Scilly. Heath is on the hills on both sides of \u201cthe neck\u201d and in the south of the island the nationally rare orange bird\u2019s-foot (''[[Ornithopus pinnatus]]'') can be found as can rare lichen species such as ''[[Lobaria pulmonaria]]'' and golden-hair lichen (''[[Teloschistes flavicans]]'').<ref name=\"Parslow\"/><ref name=\"SSSI\"/>\n\n====Rare plants====\n*Shore dock (''[[Rumex rupestris]]'') first discovered here in 1893 by [[John Ralfs]]<ref>Marquand, E.D.

Blair caught a shrew which he did not recognise and sent a specimen to the [[British Museum]] for the attention of [[Martin Hinton]], who identified it as the lesser white-toothed shrew (''[[Crocidura suaveolens]]'').

In one year the number of garden tiger larvae was 90 per square metre. The last grazing animals left in 1974 and [[Natural England]] would like grazing animals back on Gugh to counteract the effects of the scrub and dense sward of grass covering parts of the island. A [[cobalt]] deficiency in the soil means grazing animals need supplements.<ref name=\"Parslow\" />\n\nIn the southern part of the island large colonies of lesser black-blacked (''[[Larus fuscus|Larus fuscus graellsii]]'') and herring gull (''[[Larus argentatus]]'') breed, as do a small number of greater black-backed gull (''[[Larus marinus]]''). Storm petrel (''[[Hydrobates pelagicus]]'') and kittiwake (''[[Rissa tridactyla]]'') no longer breed there.<ref name=\"Parslow\" /> To protect and enhance the islands' seabirds, and to protect [[Annet, Isles of Scilly|Annet]] (an important breeding site) from re-invasion, a feasibility study was carried out to see if it was possible to eradicate rats from the Isles of Scilly. A winter trapping survey on St Agnes and Gugh indicated that those islands had a population of 3,300 brown rats. It was found the rats foraged on a variety of food including Scilly shrew which were found in the stomach contents of 18% of the rats trapped. Furthermore, numbers of the shrew were higher in areas where the rats were controlled; an indication that rats are having an effect on their numbers. The survey showed that it was both feasible, and there are significant benefits, to remove the rats as they are preventing Manx shearwater and storm petrel from establishing on St Agnes and Gugh.<ref name=\"Bell\" />\n\nIn 2009 lesser black-backed gull bred on Gugh but with low chick productivity, and the small colony of kittiwake nested, but failed for at least the fourth year.<ref>Hudson D.

There is also a problem with the recent appearance of stone mazes which should be discouraged.<ref name=\"SSSI\">{{cite web|title=Gugh|url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1001239.pdf|publisher=[[Natural England]]|accessdate=27 October 2011|year=1986}}</ref>\n\nThe notifiable habitats for Gugh are the heath communities; [[British NVC community H7|H7]], [[British NVC community H8|H8]] and [[British NVC community H11|H11]].<ref name=\"Bell\">{{cite book|last=Bell|first=E|title=Isles of Scilly Sea Bird Recovery Project|year=2001|publisher=Isles of Scilly Sea Bird Recovery Project}}{{cite web |url=http://www.ios-aonb.info/Library/Seabird%20Recovery%20Project/IOS%20Report%20-%20Summary%20Report%20%2821-2-11%29.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331051439/http://www.ios-aonb.info/Library/Seabird%20Recovery%20Project/IOS%20Report%20-%20Summary%20Report%20%2821-2-11%29.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-31 }}</ref>\n\n===Flora===\n[[Image:GughSandbar.JPG|thumb|right|180px|The tombolo looking from St. Agnes towards Gugh]]\nMuch of the vegetation of Gugh is either wind-pruned, dry, waved maritime heath or dense gorse and bracken.  The three dominant species on the heath are heather (''[[Calluna|Calluna vulgaris]]''), bell heather (''[[Erica|Erica cinerea]]'') and western gorse (''[[Ulex gallii]]''). Immediately above the bar is a small area of dune grassland merging into maritime grassland around the coastal fringe. On the small dune system grows western clover (''[[Trifolium occidentale]]''), sea holly (''[[Eryngium maritimum]]''), sea spurge (''[[Euphorbia paralias]]'') and Portland spurge (''[[Euphorbia portlandica]]''), wild thyme (''[[Thymus polytrichus]]'') and sea bindweed (''[[Calystegia soldanella]]''). The neck of the island between the two hills where the farm was located has an unusual flora. Amongst dense bracken is balm-leaved figwort (''[[Scrophularia scorodonia]]''), common here but not found elsewhere on the island and an unidentified yellow, cultivated rose. A second alien, Argentine dock (''[[Rumex frutescens]]'') grows on the edge of a sand pit which was originally intended to be a reservoir. The fields below the two houses were, before 1933, fertilised with \"[[shoddy]]\" \u2013 a high nitrate manure derived from the woollen industry. Within these fields can be found viper\u2019s-bugloss (''[[Echium vulgare]]''), common melilot (''[[Melilotus officinalis]]'') and wild mignonette (''[[Reseda lutea]]''). All three are thought to be imported arable weeds. In the 1960s the \"neck\" was a closely cropped sward of grass but after [[myxomatosis]] the area became overgrown with bracken and bramble.\n\nIn October, 1972 a fire on Kittern Hill burnt though the shallow peaty soil to the granite. Bleached stones and blackened gorse stems can still be seen and the vegetation has not recovered sufficiently to equal the waved heath elsewhere on Scilly. Heath is on the hills on both sides of \u201cthe neck\u201d and in the south of the island the nationally rare orange bird\u2019s-foot (''[[Ornithopus pinnatus]]'') can be found as can rare lichen species such as ''[[Lobaria pulmonaria]]'' and golden-hair lichen (''[[Teloschistes flavicans]]'').<ref name=\"Parslow\"/><ref name=\"SSSI\"/>\n\n====Rare plants====\n*Shore dock (''[[Rumex rupestris]]'') first discovered here in 1893 by [[John Ralfs]]<ref>Marquand, E.D. (1893). Further records for the Scilly Isles. ''Journal of Botany'' 31: 267-7</ref> still extant in the 1960s but now extinct.\n*Small adder's-tongue (''[[Ophioglossum azoricum]]'') has not been seen since at least the mid-1980s.

Blair caught a shrew which he did not recognise and sent a specimen to the [[British Museum]] for the attention of [[Martin Hinton]], who identified it as the lesser white-toothed shrew (''[[Crocidura suaveolens]]''). Known as the \"Scilly shrew\", the type specimen is held by the British Museum.<ref>Blair, W. N. (1926) ''Blair's White-toothed Shrew''. Scillonian 5:164-5.</ref> The other mammals found on Gugh are feral cats, rabbit (''[[Oryctolagus cuniculus]]'') and possibly the house mouse (''[[Mus musculus]]'').<ref name=\"Robinson\">Robinson, P.

In one year the number of garden tiger larvae was 90 per square metre. The last grazing animals left in 1974 and [[Natural England]] would like grazing animals back on Gugh to counteract the effects of the scrub and dense sward of grass covering parts of the island. A [[cobalt]] deficiency in the soil means grazing animals need supplements.<ref name=\"Parslow\" />\n\nIn the southern part of the island large colonies of lesser black-blacked (''[[Larus fuscus|Larus fuscus graellsii]]'') and herring gull (''[[Larus argentatus]]'') breed, as do a small number of greater black-backed gull (''[[Larus marinus]]''). Storm petrel (''[[Hydrobates pelagicus]]'') and kittiwake (''[[Rissa tridactyla]]'') no longer breed there.<ref name=\"Parslow\" /> To protect and enhance the islands' seabirds, and to protect [[Annet, Isles of Scilly|Annet]] (an important breeding site) from re-invasion, a feasibility study was carried out to see if it was possible to eradicate rats from the Isles of Scilly. A winter trapping survey on St Agnes and Gugh indicated that those islands had a population of 3,300 brown rats. It was found the rats foraged on a variety of food including Scilly shrew which were found in the stomach contents of 18% of the rats trapped. Furthermore, numbers of the shrew were higher in areas where the rats were controlled; an indication that rats are having an effect on their numbers. The survey showed that it was both feasible, and there are significant benefits, to remove the rats as they are preventing Manx shearwater and storm petrel from establishing on St Agnes and Gugh.<ref name=\"Bell\" />\n\nIn 2009 lesser black-backed gull bred on Gugh but with low chick productivity, and the small colony of kittiwake nested, but failed for at least the fourth year.<ref>Hudson D.
