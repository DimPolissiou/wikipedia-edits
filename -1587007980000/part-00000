They are composed of: the '''[[Spanish Army|Army]]''', the '''[[Spanish Air Force|Air Force]]''', the '''[[Spanish Navy|Navy]]''', the '''[[Spanish Royal Guard|Royal Guard]]''' and the '''[[Military Emergency Unit]]''', as well as the so-called '''[[Common Corps of the Spanish Armed Forces|Common Corps]]'''.\n\n[[Spain]] is one of the most militarily powerful nations of the [[European Union]] ([[Military operations of the European Union|EUFOR]]) and [[Eurocorps]]. It also occupies a prominent position in the structure of the '''North Atlantic Treaty Organization''' ([[NATO]]), which it joined in 1982. It also has the oldest [[Spanish Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] in the world and the oldest permanent military units in the world: the ''King's Immemorial No. 1 Infantry Regiment'' and the ''\"Soria\" No. 9 Light Infantry Regiment''.\n\n==History==\n{{main|Military history of Spain}}\n\nDuring the 15th and 16th century, Spain evolved into Europe's foremost power with the voyages of Christopher Columbus leading to Spain acquiring vast lands in the [[Americas]]. During the reign of Charles V and Philip II, Spain reached the peak of its power with the [[Spanish Empire]] spanning 19.4 million square km of the earth's surface, a total of 13%. By the mid 17th century this power had been weakened by the [[Thirty Years War]] along with financial problems, and the lack of reforms.\n\nDuring the 18th century the new [[Bourbon dynasty]] revived Spain's economic and military power through a series of important reforms in the armed forces and the economy, notably those of  Charles III of Spain. Thanks to these reforms, Spain performed well during the war of [[War of Jenkins' Ear|Jenkins' Ear]], the war of [[War of the Austrian Succession|Austrian Succession]] but with mixed result during the Seven Years' War. Spain had recovered considerably by the outbreak of the French Revolution. The occupation of a great part of Spain by the French during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] resulted in the so-called war of Spanish independence, which was characterised by use on a large scale of guerrilla troops, made necessary  by the war's devastating effect on  the Spanish  economy. Following the war, the Spanish military was in poor condition and political instability resulted in the loss of most of Spain's former colonies, except Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. These too would be lost later in the Spanish\u2013American War.\n\n===Today===\nSpain participated along with [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Italy]], [[Denmark]], the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] in the offensive against [[Moammar Gaddafi]] in [[Libya]], contributing a [[Tanker (aircraft)|tanker]], 4 [[F-18]] fighter jets, a [[frigate]], a [[submarine]] and a [[surveillance aircraft]], along with logistical support from the [[Naval Station Rota, Spain|Naval Base of Rota]] and the [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base|Air Base of Mor\u00f3n]].\n\nSpain has belonged to [[NATO]] since 1982. The decision was ratified in a referendum in 1986 by the Spanish people. The conditions were the reduction of American military bases,  no integration of Spain in the military structure of NATO, and the prohibition of introducing [[nuclear weapons]] in Spain.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\" caption=\"Armada de las Fuerzas Armadas del Reino de Espa\u00f1a\">\nFile:Manoeuvring exercise 11 (22811737931).jpg|El buque ''[[Juan Carlos I (L-61)|Juan Carlos I]]'' \nFile:US Navy 070223-N-3888C-005 An AV-8B Harrier II from the Spanish aircraft carrier Principe de Asturias (R 11) hovers in for a landing after a live fire exercise.jpg|AnAV-8B Harrier II\nFile:US Navy 040712-N-0119G-074 A formation of multi-nation ships steam through the Atlantic Ocean while participating in Majestic Eagle 2004.jpg|A formation of multi-nation ships</gallery>\n\n====Current missions====\nAs of June 2017, 3,093 soldiers of the Spanish Armed Forces and the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] are part of the nineteen operations where Spain has an active role.<ref name=\"missions2017\">{{cite news|title=Fuerzas Armadas espa\u00f1olas en misiones internacionales, Junio 2017|url=http://www.dsn.gob.es/es/actualidad/infografias/fuerzas-armadas-espa%C3%B1olas-misiones-internacionales-junio-2017#sthash.2M7BLKBb.uxfs|accessdate=June 19, 2017|date=2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617211233/http://www.dsn.gob.es/es/actualidad/infografias/fuerzas-armadas-espa%C3%B1olas-misiones-internacionales-junio-2017#sthash.2M7BLKBb.uxfs|archive-date=June 17, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the National Security Department of Spain (DSN), these are the current missions of the armed forces and civil guard:\n<ref name=\"missions2017\"/>\n\n*'''Missions with the European Union'''\n**[[EUTM Mali]] (2013\u2013present): Advisory mission in the security and training sector of the Malian National Army. 130 deployed military personnel.\n**[[Central African Republic|EUTM CAR]] (2016\u2013present): Training mission of the Armed Forces of the Government of the Central African Republic.

They are composed of: the '''[[Spanish Army|Army]]''', the '''[[Spanish Air Force|Air Force]]''', the '''[[Spanish Navy|Navy]]''', the '''[[Spanish Royal Guard|Royal Guard]]''' and the '''[[Military Emergency Unit]]''', as well as the so-called '''[[Common Corps of the Spanish Armed Forces|Common Corps]]'''.\n\n[[Spain]] is one of the most militarily powerful nations of the [[European Union]] ([[Military operations of the European Union|EUFOR]]) and [[Eurocorps]]. It also occupies a prominent position in the structure of the '''North Atlantic Treaty Organization''' ([[NATO]]), which it joined in 1982. It also has the oldest [[Spanish Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] in the world and the oldest permanent military units in the world: the ''[[King's Immemorial No. 1 Infantry Regiment]]'' and the ''[[\"Soria\" No. 9 Light Infantry Regiment]]''.\n\n==History==\n{{main|Military history of Spain}}\n\nDuring the 15th and 16th century, Spain evolved into Europe's foremost power with the voyages of Christopher Columbus leading to Spain acquiring vast lands in the [[Americas]]. During the reign of Charles V and Philip II, Spain reached the peak of its power with the [[Spanish Empire]] spanning 19.4 million square km of the earth's surface, a total of 13%. By the mid 17th century this power had been weakened by the [[Thirty Years War]] along with financial problems, and the lack of reforms.\n\nDuring the 18th century the new [[Bourbon dynasty]] revived Spain's economic and military power through a series of important reforms in the armed forces and the economy, notably those of  Charles III of Spain. Thanks to these reforms, Spain performed well during the war of [[War of Jenkins' Ear|Jenkins' Ear]], the war of [[War of the Austrian Succession|Austrian Succession]] but with mixed result during the Seven Years' War. Spain had recovered considerably by the outbreak of the French Revolution. The occupation of a great part of Spain by the French during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] resulted in the so-called war of Spanish independence, which was characterised by use on a large scale of guerrilla troops, made necessary  by the war's devastating effect on  the Spanish  economy. Following the war, the Spanish military was in poor condition and political instability resulted in the loss of most of Spain's former colonies, except Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. These too would be lost later in the Spanish\u2013American War.\n\n===Today===\nSpain participated along with [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Italy]], [[Denmark]], the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] in the offensive against [[Moammar Gaddafi]] in [[Libya]], contributing a [[Tanker (aircraft)|tanker]], 4 [[F-18]] fighter jets, a [[frigate]], a [[submarine]] and a [[surveillance aircraft]], along with logistical support from the [[Naval Station Rota, Spain|Naval Base of Rota]] and the [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base|Air Base of Mor\u00f3n]].\n\nSpain has belonged to [[NATO]] since 1982. The decision was ratified in a referendum in 1986 by the Spanish people. The conditions were the reduction of American military bases,  no integration of Spain in the military structure of NATO, and the prohibition of introducing [[nuclear weapons]] in Spain.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\" caption=\"Armada de las Fuerzas Armadas del Reino de Espa\u00f1a\">\nFile:Manoeuvring exercise 11 (22811737931).jpg|El buque ''[[Juan Carlos I (L-61)|Juan Carlos I]]'' \nFile:US Navy 070223-N-3888C-005 An AV-8B Harrier II from the Spanish aircraft carrier Principe de Asturias (R 11) hovers in for a landing after a live fire exercise.jpg|AnAV-8B Harrier II\nFile:US Navy 040712-N-0119G-074 A formation of multi-nation ships steam through the Atlantic Ocean while participating in Majestic Eagle 2004.jpg|A formation of multi-nation ships</gallery>\n\n====Current missions====\nAs of June 2017, 3,093 soldiers of the Spanish Armed Forces and the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] are part of the nineteen operations where Spain has an active role.<ref name=\"missions2017\">{{cite news|title=Fuerzas Armadas espa\u00f1olas en misiones internacionales, Junio 2017|url=http://www.dsn.gob.es/es/actualidad/infografias/fuerzas-armadas-espa%C3%B1olas-misiones-internacionales-junio-2017#sthash.2M7BLKBb.uxfs|accessdate=June 19, 2017|date=2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617211233/http://www.dsn.gob.es/es/actualidad/infografias/fuerzas-armadas-espa%C3%B1olas-misiones-internacionales-junio-2017#sthash.2M7BLKBb.uxfs|archive-date=June 17, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the National Security Department of Spain (DSN), these are the current missions of the armed forces and civil guard:\n<ref name=\"missions2017\"/>\n\n*'''Missions with the European Union'''\n**[[EUTM Mali]] (2013\u2013present): Advisory mission in the security and training sector of the Malian National Army. 130 deployed military personnel.\n**[[Central African Republic|EUTM CAR]] (2016\u2013present): Training mission of the Armed Forces of the Government of the Central African Republic.

Katzman writes that their ideology \"espoused the creation of a [[classless society]] that would combat world [[imperialism]], international [[Zionism]], [[colonialism]], exploitation, racism, and multinational corporations\".{{sfn|Katzman|2001|p=99}} The MEK\u2019s ideological foundation was developed during the period of the Iran revolution. According to its official history, the MEK first defined itself as a group that wanted to establish a nationalist, democratic, revolutionary Muslim organization in favour of change in Iran.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gardu\u00f1o |first1=Moises |year=2016 |title= LA ARTICULACI\u00d3N DE INTERESES DE LOS MO\u0232\u0100HED\u012aN-EJALQ-E IRAN: DE LA REVOLUCI\u00d3N ISL\u00c1MICA AL MOVIMIENTO VERDE |journal= Estudios de Asia y Africa |volume=51 |issue=1 |page = 105\u2013135 |doi= 10.24201/eaa.v51i1.2184|accessdate=}}</ref> \n\nHistorian Ervand Abrahamian observed that the MEK were \"consciously influenced by Marxism, both [[Neo-Marxism|modern]] and [[Classical Marxism|classical]]\", but they always denied being Marxists because they were aware that the term was colloquial to '[[atheistic]] materialism' among Iran's general public. The Iranian regime for the same reason was \"eager to pin on the Mojahedin the labels of Islamic-Marxists and Marxist-Muslims\".{{sfn|Abrahamian|1989|pp=100\u2013101}}\n\nAccording to Abrahamian, it was the first Iranian organization to develop systematically a modern revolutionary interpretation of Islam that \"differed sharply from both the old conservative Islam of the traditional clergy and the new populist version formulated in the 1970s by Ayatollah Khomeini and his disciples\".{{sfn|Abrahamian|1989|p=1}} According to James Piazza, the MEK worked towards the creation by armed popular struggle of a society in which ethnic, gender, or class discrimination would be obliterated.{{sfn|Piazza|1994|pp=9\u201343}}\n\nDuring the early 1970s, the MEK denied government allegations that it had espoused Marxism as ideology. Nasser Sadegh told military tribunals that although the MEK respected Marxism as a \"progressive method of social analysis, they could not accept materialism, which was contrary to their Islamic ideology\". The MEK eventually had a falling out with Marxist groups. According to Sepehr Zabir, \"they soon became Enemy No. 1 of both pro-Soviet Marxist groups, the Tudeh and the Majority Fedayeen\".<ref name=\"auto30\"/>\n\nAbrahamian said that the MEK's early ideology constituted a \"combination of Muslim themes; Shii notions of martyrdom; classical Marxist theories of class struggle and historical determinism; and neo-Marxist concepts of armed struggle, guerilla warfare and revolutionary heroism\".{{sfn|Abrahamian|1989|p=100}} However, the MEK claim that this misrepresents their ideology in that Marxism and Islam are incompatible, and that the MEK has always emphasized Islam.{{sfn|Katzman|2001|p=99}}\n\nThe MEK's ideology of revolutionary [[Twelver|Shiaism]] is based on an interpretation of Islam so similar to that of [[Ali Shariati]] that \"many concluded\" they were inspired by him. According to historian Ervand Abrahamian, it is clear that \"in later years\" that Shariati and \"his prolific works\" had \"indirectly helped the Mujahedin\".{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1982|p=490}}\n\nIn the group's \"first major ideological work\", ''Nahzat-i Husseini'' or [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]]'s Movement, authored by one of the group's founders, Ahmad Reza'i, it was argued that ''Nezam-i Towhid'' (monotheistic order) sought by the prophet Muhammad, was a commonwealth fully united not only in its worship of one God but in a classless society that strives for the common good. \"Shiism, particularly Hussein's historic act of martyrdom and resistance, has both a revolutionary message and a special place in our popular culture\".{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1982|p=491}}\n\nAs described by Abrahamian, one Mojahedin ideologist argued\n\n<blockquote>Reza'i further argued that the banner of revolt raised by the Shi'i [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imams]], especially [[Ali]], [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hassan]], and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]], was aimed against feudal landlords and exploiting merchant capitalists as well as against usurping [[Rashidun Caliphate|Caliphs]] who betrayed the ''Nezam-i-Towhid''. For Reza'i and the Mujahidin it was the duty of all muslims to continue this struggle to create a '[[classless society]]' and destroy all forms of [[capitalism]], [[despotism]], and [[imperialism]]. The Mujahidin summed up their attitude towards religion in these words: 'After years of extensive study into Islamic history and Shi'i ideology, our organization has reached the firm conclusion that Islam, especially Shi'ism, will play a major role in inspiring the masses to join the revolution. It will do so because Shi'ism, particularly [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]]'s historic act of resistance, has both a revolutionary message and a special place in our popular culture.<ref>Keddle, Nikki R.

According to [[Ervand Abrahamian]] \"in the eyes of traditionalists, particularly among the bazaar middle class, the whole incident was indecent. It smacked of wife-swapping, especially when Abrishamchi announced his own marriage to Khiabani\u2019s younger sister. It involved women with young children and wives of close friends \u2013 a taboo in traditional Iranian culture;\" something that further isolated the Mojahedin and also upset some members of the organization. Also according to [[Ervand Abrahamian]], \"the incident was equally outrageous in the eyes of the secularists, especially among the modern intelligentsia. It projected onto the public arena a matter that should have been treated as a private issue between two individuals.\"{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1989|p=251\u2013253}} Many criticized Maryam Azodanlu's giving up her own maiden name (something most Iranian women did not do and she herself had not done in her previous marriage). They would question whether this was in line with her claims of being a staunch feminist.{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1989|p=251\u2013253}} \n\n[[Maryam Rajavi]] became increasingly important over feminism-colored politics. The emancipation of women is now depicted in Maryam Rajavi's writings \"as both a policy end and a strategy toward revolutionizing Iran. Secularism, democracy, and women's rights are thus today's leading themes in the group's strategic communications. As for Maryam Rajavi's leadership, in 2017 it appears to be political and cultural; any remnants of a military force and interest in terrorist strategies have faded away.\"{{sfn|Harmon|Bowdish|2018|p=166}}\n\nAccording to [[Country Reports on Terrorism]], in 1990 the second phase of the 'ideological revolution' was announced during which all married members were ordered to [[divorce]] and remain celibate, undertaking a vow of \"eternal divorce\", with the exception of Massoud and Maryam Rajavi.

Katzman writes that their ideology \"espoused the creation of a [[classless society]] that would combat world [[imperialism]], international [[Zionism]], [[colonialism]], exploitation, racism, and multinational corporations\".{{sfn|Katzman|2001|p=99}} The MEK\u2019s ideological foundation was developed during the period of the Iran revolution. According to its official history, the MEK first defined itself as a group that wanted to establish a nationalist, democratic, revolutionary Muslim organization in favour of change in Iran.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gardu\u00f1o |first1=Moises |year=2016 |title= LA ARTICULACI\u00d3N DE INTERESES DE LOS MO\u0232\u0100HED\u012aN-EJALQ-E IRAN: DE LA REVOLUCI\u00d3N ISL\u00c1MICA AL MOVIMIENTO VERDE |journal= Estudios de Asia y Africa |volume=51 |issue=1 |page = 105\u2013135 |doi= 10.24201/eaa.v51i1.2184|accessdate=}}</ref> \n\nHistorian Ervand Abrahamian observed that the MEK were \"consciously influenced by Marxism, both [[Neo-Marxism|modern]] and [[Classical Marxism|classical]]\", but they always denied being Marxists because they were aware that the term was colloquial to '[[atheistic]] materialism' among Iran's general public. The Iranian regime for the same reason was \"eager to pin on the Mojahedin the labels of Islamic-Marxists and Marxist-Muslims\".{{sfn|Abrahamian|1989|pp=100\u2013101}}\n\nAccording to Abrahamian, it was the first Iranian organization to develop systematically a modern revolutionary interpretation of Islam that \"differed sharply from both the old conservative Islam of the traditional clergy and the new populist version formulated in the 1970s by Ayatollah Khomeini and his disciples\".{{sfn|Abrahamian|1989|p=1}} According to James Piazza, the MEK worked towards the creation by armed popular struggle of a society in which ethnic, gender, or class discrimination would be obliterated.{{sfn|Piazza|1994|pp=9\u201343}}\n\nDuring the early 1970s, the MEK denied government allegations that it had espoused Marxism as ideology. Nasser Sadegh told military tribunals that although the MEK respected Marxism as a \"progressive method of social analysis, they could not accept materialism, which was contrary to their Islamic ideology\". The MEK eventually had a falling out with Marxist groups. According to Sepehr Zabir, \"they soon became Enemy No. 1 of both pro-Soviet Marxist groups, the Tudeh and the Majority Fedayeen\".<ref name=\"auto30\"/>\n\nAbrahamian said that the MEK's early ideology constituted a \"combination of Muslim themes; Shii notions of martyrdom; classical Marxist theories of class struggle and historical determinism; and neo-Marxist concepts of armed struggle, guerilla warfare and revolutionary heroism\".{{sfn|Abrahamian|1989|p=100}} However, the MEK claim that this misrepresents their ideology in that Marxism and Islam are incompatible, and that the MEK has always emphasized Islam.{{sfn|Katzman|2001|p=99}}\n\nThe MEK's ideology of revolutionary [[Twelver|Shiaism]] is based on an interpretation of Islam so similar to that of [[Ali Shariati]] that \"many concluded\" they were inspired by him. According to historian Ervand Abrahamian, it is clear that \"in later years\" that Shariati and \"his prolific works\" had \"indirectly helped the Mujahedin\".{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1982|p=490}}\n\nIn the group's \"first major ideological work\", ''Nahzat-i Husseini'' or [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]]'s Movement, authored by one of the group's founders, Ahmad Reza'i, it was argued that ''Nezam-i Towhid'' (monotheistic order) sought by the prophet Muhammad, was a commonwealth fully united not only in its worship of one God but in a classless society that strives for the common good. \"Shiism, particularly Hussein's historic act of martyrdom and resistance, has both a revolutionary message and a special place in our popular culture\".{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1982|p=491}}\n\nAs described by Abrahamian, one Mojahedin ideologist argued\n\n<blockquote>Reza'i further argued that the banner of revolt raised by the Shi'i [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imams]], especially [[Ali]], [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hassan]], and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]], was aimed against feudal landlords and exploiting merchant capitalists as well as against usurping [[Rashidun Caliphate|Caliphs]] who betrayed the ''Nezam-i-Towhid''. For Reza'i and the Mujahidin it was the duty of all muslims to continue this struggle to create a '[[classless society]]' and destroy all forms of [[capitalism]], [[despotism]], and [[imperialism]]. The Mujahidin summed up their attitude towards religion in these words: 'After years of extensive study into Islamic history and Shi'i ideology, our organization has reached the firm conclusion that Islam, especially Shi'ism, will play a major role in inspiring the masses to join the revolution. It will do so because Shi'ism, particularly [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]]'s historic act of resistance, has both a revolutionary message and a special place in our popular culture.<ref>Keddle, Nikki R.

According to [[Ervand Abrahamian]] \"in the eyes of traditionalists, particularly among the bazaar middle class, the whole incident was indecent. It smacked of wife-swapping, especially when Abrishamchi announced his own marriage to Khiabani\u2019s younger sister. It involved women with young children and wives of close friends \u2013 a taboo in traditional Iranian culture;\" something that further isolated the Mojahedin and also upset some members of the organization. Also according to [[Ervand Abrahamian]], \"the incident was equally outrageous in the eyes of the secularists, especially among the modern intelligentsia. It projected onto the public arena a matter that should have been treated as a private issue between two individuals.\"{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1989|p=251\u2013253}} Many criticized Maryam Azodanlu's giving up her own maiden name (something most Iranian women did not do and she herself had not done in her previous marriage). They would question whether this was in line with her claims of being a staunch feminist.{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1989|p=251\u2013253}} \n\n[[Maryam Rajavi]] became increasingly important over feminism-colored politics. The emancipation of women is now depicted in Maryam Rajavi's writings \"as both a policy end and a strategy toward revolutionizing Iran. Secularism, democracy, and women's rights are thus today's leading themes in the group's strategic communications. As for Maryam Rajavi's leadership, in 2017 it appears to be political and cultural; any remnants of a military force and interest in terrorist strategies have faded away.\"{{sfn|Harmon|Bowdish|2018|p=166}}\n\nAccording to [[Country Reports on Terrorism]], in 1990 the second phase of the 'ideological revolution' was announced during which all married members were ordered to [[divorce]] and remain celibate, undertaking a vow of \"eternal divorce\", with the exception of Massoud and Maryam Rajavi.
