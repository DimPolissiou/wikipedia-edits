The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi.

The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry.

The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry.

In 1975, Gandhi declared the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] as a constituent unit of India. The Kashmir conflict remained largely peaceful if frozen under Gandhi's premiership.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jayanta|last=Kumar Ray|title=Aspects of India's International Relations, 1700 to 2000: South Asia and the World|location=|publisher=Pearson|year=2007|page=493|isbn=978-8131708347}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Gandhi granted statehood to [[Meghalaya]], [[Manipur]] and [[Tripura]], while the [[North-East Frontier Agency]] was declared a union territory and renamed [[Arunachal Pradesh]].

She argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh|Jana Sangh]] and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] in 1970. It was passed in the [[Lok Sabha]] but felt short of the two-thirds majority in the [[Rajya Sabha]] by a single vote.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} Gandhi responded by having a [[Presidential proclamation]] issued; de-recognizing the princes; with this withdrawal of recognition, their claims to privy purses were also legally lost.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} However, the proclamation was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of India]].{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} In 1971, Gandhi again motioned to abolish the privy purse. This time, it was successfully passed as the [[List of amendments of the Constitution of India|26th Amendment to the Constitution of India]].<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Many royals tried to protest the abolition of the privy purse, primarily through campaigns to contest seats in elections.

The political economist, Jyotindra Das Gupta, cryptically questioned \"...whether or not the real supporters of land-holders were in jail or in power?\"<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Critics also accused Gandhi of choosing to \"talk left and act right\", referring to her concurrent pro-business decisions and endeavours.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> [[J.

This was not acceptable to many non-Hindi speaking states, who wanted the continued use of English in government.

Buford's abilities are expanded with ears that revolve like radar dishes, and his nose responds to clues like a Geiger counter. But Buford has two weaknesses: when the moon comes out, he howls his heart out, often at the most perilous moments and he also has a running feud with a karate-whacking raccoon.\n\n*'''Nugget Nose''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): Nugget Nose is the short and feisty ghost of an Old West gold prospector who finds adventure riding his invisible horse. He is also a guardian to two teenage cowgirls \u2013 '''Wendy''' and '''Rita''' (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]] and [[Patricia Parris|Pat Parris]]) \u2013 who work at the Fuddy Dude Ranch owned by grouchy, old '''Fenwick Fuddy''' (voiced by [[Harold Peary|Hal Peary]]). Whenever Fuddy threatens to fire the girls, Nugget makes himself invisible and becomes a helping friend. He is always battling Fuddy and takes delight in harassing him in odd and humorous ways. When the girls are in trouble, Wendy summons Nugget by rubbing on her special gold nugget necklace.\n\nBuford, Nugget Nose, Wendy and Rita also participated in intergalactic racing competitions with [[Yogi Bear]], [[Huckleberry Hound]], [[Jabberjaw]] and other characters on the ''Yogi's Space Race'' segment (which was also spun-off into a separate half-hour). While Nugget Nose, Wendy and Rita race together as a trio, Buford's partner is Jabberjaw whose race ship contains a track on which Buford runs to increase speed.\n\n==Broadcast history==\n''The Buford

Buford's abilities are expanded with ears that revolve like radar dishes, and his nose responds to clues like a Geiger counter. But Buford has two weaknesses: when the moon comes out, he howls his heart out, often at the most perilous moments and he also has a running feud with a karate-whacking raccoon.\n\n*'''Nugget Nose''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): Nugget Nose is the short and feisty ghost of an Old West gold prospector who finds adventure riding his invisible horse. He is also a guardian to two teenage cowgirls \u2013 '''Wendy''' and '''Rita''' (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]] and [[Patricia Parris|Pat Parris]]) \u2013 who work at the Fuddy Dude Ranch owned by grouchy, old '''Fenwick Fuddy''' (voiced by [[Harold Peary|Hal Peary]]). Whenever Fuddy threatens to fire the girls, Nugget makes himself invisible and becomes a helping friend. He is always battling Fuddy and takes delight in harassing him in odd and humorous ways. When the girls are in trouble, Wendy summons Nugget by rubbing on her special gold nugget necklace.\n\nBuford, Nugget Nose, Wendy and Rita also participated in intergalactic racing competitions with [[Yogi Bear]], [[Huckleberry Hound]], [[Jabberjaw]] and other characters on the ''Yogi's Space Race'' segment (which was also spun-off into a separate half-hour). While Nugget Nose, Wendy and Rita race together as a trio, Buford's partner is Jabberjaw whose race ship contains a track on which Buford runs to increase speed.\n\n==Broadcast history==\n''The Buford

The quarterfinal games were televised nationwide on [[ESPN2]]. Semifinals and the championship game were televised on [[ESPN]]. The tournament was also televised by [[Raycom Sports]] in ACC markets. For the first time ever, Raycom broadcast the tournament in [[HDTV|high definition]].\n\nThe top four regular season teams ([[North Carolina Tar Heels|North Carolina]], [[Virginia Cavaliers|Virginia]], [[Virginia Tech Hokies|Virginia Tech]], and [[Boston College Eagles|Boston College]]) received first-round byes and played their first games in the quarterfinals. Both North Carolina and Virginia finished the [[2006/2007 ACC Men's Basketball Season|regular season]] tied for first place with an 11\u20135 record, but North Carolina received the #1 seed by virtue of the head-to-head tiebreaker.\n\nAll four opening-round games were won by the lower seeds. This tournament was the lowest [[Duke Blue Devils|Duke]] had been seeded (seventh) in the ACC Tournament since 1995, when they were the ninth seed.  Their on-court struggles were compounded by the suspension of freshman [[Gerald Henderson, Jr.|Gerald Henderson]].<ref>[http://dukechronicle.com/article/henderson-suspended-late-foul Henderson suspended for late foul]</ref>  By defeating Duke, [[NC State Wolfpack|NC State]] ended Duke's 8-year domination of the ACC Tournament.  Prior to this loss, Duke was 23\u20131 in ACC Tournament play over the previous 8 years, losing only the 2004 finals to Maryland. The 2007 final round was identical to the final round of the Women's ACC Tournament, with North Carolina beating NC State for the title.\n\nThe 2007 tournament marked the first time a 10th seed won a game in an ACC tournament, much less three in a row (although 12th seed Wake Forest won two games in the 2006 Tournament). It was the second time a team has played 4 games (NC State in 1997), and the first time a team seeded as low as 10 reached the championship game. Previously the lowest seed to reach the title game was #8 seed NC State in [[1997 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|1997]], when the conference had nine members.\n\nBy winning the ACC championship, North Carolina received an automatic bid to the [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. North Carolina's [[Brandan Wright]] won the tournament's Most Valuable Player award.\n\n==Bracket==\n{{4RoundBracket-Byes \n| RD1='''First Round''' <br> March 8, 2007\n| RD2='''Quarterfinals''' <br>
