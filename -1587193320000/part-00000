{"title_page": "List of films based on video games", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use American English|date=August 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2019}}\nThis page is a '''list of [[video game film|film adaptations of video games]]'''. These include local, international, direct-to-video and TV releases, and (in certain cases) online releases. They include their scores on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the region in which they were released (for foreign adaptations), approximate budget, their approximate box office revenue (for theatrical releases), distributor of the film, and the publisher of the original game at the time the film was made (this means that publishers may change between two adaptations of the same game or game series, such as ''[[Mortal Kombat]]''). Also included are short films, cutscene films (made up of cutscenes and cinematics from the actual games), documentaries with video games as their subjects and films in which video games play a large part (such as ''[[Tron]]'' or ''[[WarGames]]'').\n\nFilms based on video games have often received negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes's 2019 list titled ''Video Game Movies Ranked Worst to Best'' included only 3 films that received a fresh Tomatometer rating.{{efn|name=RTRanking|Rotten Tomatoes only included theatrically-released films with Tomatometer scores based on more than 20 reviews.}}<ref name= VideoGameRottenTomatoes>{{cite web |title=43 VIDEO GAME MOVIES RANKED WORST TO BEST |url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/video-game-movies-ranked-worst-to-best/ |accessdate=August 20, 2019 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref>\n\n==Theatrical releases==\n\n===Hollywood (live-action)===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

Originally defined as the third audio format of the [[MPEG-1]] standard, it was retained and further extended\u2014defining additional bit-rates and support for more [[surround channels|audio channels]]\u2014as the third audio format of the subsequent [[MPEG-2]] standard. A third version, known as MPEG 2.5\u2014extended to better support lower bit rates\u2014is commonly implemented, but is not a recognized standard.\n\n'''MP3''' (or '''mp3''') as a [[file format]] commonly designates files containing an [[elementary stream]] of MPEG-1 Audio or MPEG-2 Audio encoded data, without other complexities of the MP3 standard.\n\nIn regard to [[audio compression (data)|audio compression]] (the aspect of the standard most apparent to end-users, and for which is it best known), MP3 uses [[lossy compression|lossy data-compression]] to encode data using inexact approximations and the partial discarding of data. This allows a large reduction in file sizes when compared to uncompressed audio. The combination of small size and acceptable fidelity led to a boom in the distribution of music over the Internet in the mid- to late-1990s, with MP3 serving as an enabling technology at a time when bandwidth and storage were still at a premium.  The MP3 format soon became associated with controversies surrounding [[copyright infringement]], [[music piracy]], and the file [[ripping]]/[[file sharing|sharing]] services [[MP3.com]] and [[Napster]], among others. With the advent of [[portable media player]]s, a product category also including [[smartphones]], MP3 support remains near-universal.\n\nMP3 compression works by reducing (or approximating) the accuracy of certain components of sound that are considered (by psychoacoustic analysis) to be beyond the [[Hearing range#Humans|hearing capabilities]] of most humans. This method is commonly referred to as perceptual coding or as [[psychoacoustics|psychoacoustic]] modeling.<ref name=\"Jayant1993\" /> The remaining audio information is then recorded in a space-efficient manner, using [[Modified discrete cosine transform|MDCT]] and [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]] algorithms. Compared to [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-quality digital audio]], MP3 compression can commonly achieve a 75 to 95% reduction in size. For example, an MP3 encoded at a constant bitrate of 128&nbsp;kbit/s would result in a file approximately 9% of the size of the original CD audio.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000012.shtml |title= MP3 (MPEG Layer III Audio Encoding) |date= 27 July 2017 |publisher= The Library of Congress |access-date= 9 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] (MPEG) designed MP3 as part of its [[MPEG-1]], and later [[MPEG-2]], standards.

In 1894, the American physicist [[Alfred M. Mayer]] reported that a tone could be rendered inaudible by another tone of lower frequency.<ref name=\"Mayer1894\" /> In 1959, Richard Ehmer described a complete set of auditory curves regarding this phenomenon.<ref name=\"Ehmer1959\" /> Between 1967 and 1974, Eberhard F.

In December 1988, MPEG called for an audio coding standard. In June 1989, 14 audio coding algorithms were submitted. Because of certain similarities between these coding proposals, they were clustered into four development groups. The first group was [[MUSICAM]], by [[Panasonic|Matsushita]], [[Centre commun d'\u00e9tudes de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision et t\u00e9l\u00e9communications|CCETT]], ITT and [[Philips]]. The second group was ASPEC, by [[AT&T]], [[France Telecom]], [[Fraunhofer Gesellschaft]], Deutsche and [[Thomson-CSF|Thomson-Brandt]]. The third group was ATAC, by [[Fujitsu]], [[JVC]], [[NEC]] and [[Sony]]. And the fourth group was [[SB-ADPCM]], by [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]] and BTRL.<ref name=\"musmann\"/>\n\nThe immediate predecessors of MP3 were \"Optimum Coding in the Frequency Domain\" (OCF),<ref name=\"Brandenburg\" /> and Perceptual Transform Coding (PXFM).<ref name=\"Johnston1988\" /> These two codecs, along with block-switching contributions from Thomson-Brandt, were merged into a codec called ASPEC, which was submitted to MPEG, and which won the quality competition, but that was mistakenly rejected as too complex to implement. The first practical implementation of an audio perceptual coder (OCF) in hardware (Krasner's hardware was too cumbersome and slow for practical use), was an implementation of a psychoacoustic transform coder based on [[Motorola 56000]] [[Digital Signal Processor|DSP]] chips.\n\nAnother predecessor of the MP3 format and technology is to be found in the perceptual codec MUSICAM based on an integer arithmetics 32 sub-bands filterbank, driven by a psychoacoustic model. It was primarily designed for Digital Audio Broadcasting (digital radio) and digital TV, and its basic principles disclosed to the scientific community by CCETT (France) and IRT (Germany) in Atlanta during an IEEE-ICASSP conference in 1991,<ref>Y.F. Dehery, et al.  (1991)  A MUSICAM source codec for Digital Audio Broadcasting and storage Proceedings IEEE-ICASSP 91 pages 3605\u20133608 May 1991</ref> after having worked on MUSICAM with [[Panasonic|Matsushita]] and Philips since 1989.<ref name=\"musmann\"/>\n\nThis codec incorporated into a broadcasting system using COFDM modulation was demonstrated on air and on the field<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1991/BC-1991-04-15.pdf | title = A DAB commentary from Alan Box, EZ communication and chairman NAB DAB task force }}</ref> together with Radio Canada and CRC Canada during the NAB show (Las Vegas) in 1991. The implementation of the audio part of this broadcasting system was based on a two chips encoder (one for the subband transform, one for the psychoacoustic model designed by the team of [[G. Stoll]] (IRT Germany), later known as psychoacoustic model I) and a real time decoder using one [[Motorola 56001]] [[Digital Signal Processor|DSP]] chip running an integer arithmetics software designed by Y.F. Dehery's team ([[Centre commun d'\u00e9tudes de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision et t\u00e9l\u00e9communications|CCETT]], France). The simplicity of the corresponding decoder together with the high audio quality of this codec using for the first time a 48&nbsp;kHz sampling frequency, a 20 bits/sample input format (the highest available sampling standard in 1991, compatible with the AES/EBU professional digital input studio standard) were the main reasons to later adopt the characteristics of MUSICAM as the basic features for an advanced digital music compression codec.\n\nDuring the development of the MUSICAM encoding software, Stoll and Dehery's team made a thorough use of a set of high quality audio assessment material<ref>{{cite book | url = https://tech.ebu.ch/publications/sqamcd | title = EBU SQAM CD Sound Quality Assessment Material recordings for subjective tests | date = 2008-10-07 }}</ref> selected by a group of audio professionals from the European Broadcasting Union and later used as a reference for the assessment of music compression codecs .   The subband coding technique was found to be efficient, not only for the perceptual coding of the high quality sound materials but especially for the encoding of critical percussive sound materials (drums, triangle, ..) due to the specific temporal masking effect of the MUSICAM sub-band filterbank (this advantage being a specific feature of short transform coding techniques).\n\nAs a doctoral student at Germany's [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]], [[Karlheinz Brandenburg]] began working on digital music compression in the early 1980s, focusing on how people perceive music. He completed his doctoral work in 1989.<ref name=\"BusinessWeek_2007\" /> MP3 is directly descended from OCF and PXFM, representing the outcome of the collaboration of Brandenburg\u2014working as a postdoc at AT&T-Bell Labs with James D. Johnston (\"JJ\") of AT&T-Bell Labs\u2014with the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits, Erlangen (where he worked with [[Bernhard Grill]] and four other researchers \u2013 \"The Original Six\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=How Music Got Free: The End of an Industry, the Turn of the Century, and the Patient Zero of Piracy|last=Witt|first=Stephen|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2016|isbn=978-0143109341|location=United States of America|pages=13|quote=Brandenburg and Grill were joined by four other Fraunhofer researchers. Heinz Gerhauser oversaw the institute\u00b4s audio research group; [[Harald Popp]] was a hardware specialist; Ernst Eberlein was a signal processing expert; Jurgen Herre was another graduate student whose mathematical prowess rivaled Brandenburg\u00b4s own. In later years this group would refer to themselves as \"the original six\".|via=}}</ref>), with relatively minor contributions from the MP2 branch of psychoacoustic sub-band coders. In 1990, Brandenburg became an assistant professor at Erlangen-Nuremberg. While there, he continued to work on music compression with scientists at the [[Fraunhofer Society]]'s [[Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications|Heinrich Herz Institute]] (in 1993 he joined the staff of Fraunhofer HHI).<ref name=\"BusinessWeek_2007\" /> The song \"[[Tom's Diner]]\" by [[Suzanne Vega]] was the first song used by Karlheinz Brandenburg to develop the MP3. Brandenburg adopted the song for testing purposes, listening to it again and again each time refining the scheme, making sure it did not adversely affect the subtlety of Vega's voice.<ref name=\"Sterne2012_Vega\"/>\n\n=== Standardization ===\n\nIn 1991, there were two available proposals that were assessed for an MPEG audio standard: [[MUSICAM]] (<u>M</u>asking pattern adapted <u>U</u>niversal <u>S</u>ubband <u>I</u>ntegrated <u>C</u>oding <u>A</u>nd <u>M</u>ultiplexing) and ASPEC (<u>A</u>daptive <u>S</u>pectral <u>P</u>erceptual <u>E</u>ntropy <u>C</u>oding). The MUSICAM technique, proposed by [[Philips]] (Netherlands), [[Centre commun d'\u00e9tudes de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision et t\u00e9l\u00e9communications|CCETT]] (France), the [[Institut f\u00fcr Rundfunktechnik|Institute for Broadcast Technology]] (Germany), and [[Matsushita]] (Japan),<ref>Digital Video and Audio Broadcasting Technology: A Practical Engineering Guide (Signals and Communication Technology) {{ISBN|3-540-76357-0}} p. 144: \"In the year 1988, the MASCAM method was developed at the Institut f\u00fcr Rundfunktechnik (IRT) in Munich in preparation for the digital audio broadcasting (DAB) system. From MASCAM, the MUSICAM (masking pattern universal subband integrated coding and multiplexing) method was developed in 1989 in cooperation with CCETT, Philips and Matsushita.\"</ref> was chosen due to its simplicity and error robustness, as well as for its high level of computational efficiency.<ref name=\"santa-clara-1990\" /> The MUSICAM format, based on [[sub-band coding]], became the basis for the MPEG Audio compression format, incorporating, for example, its frame structure, header format, sample rates, etc.\n\nWhile much of MUSICAM technology and ideas were incorporated into the definition of MPEG Audio Layer I and Layer II, the filter bank alone and the data structure based on 1152 samples framing (file format and byte oriented stream) of MUSICAM remained in the Layer III (MP3) format, as part of the computationally inefficient hybrid [[filter (software)|filter]] bank. Under the chairmanship of Professor Musmann of the [[Leibniz University Hannover]], the editing of the standard was delegated to Leon van de Kerkhof (Netherlands), Gerhard Stoll (Germany), and Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Dehery (France), who worked on Layer I and Layer II. ASPEC was the joint proposal of AT&T Bell Laboratories, Thomson Consumer Electronics, Fraunhofer Society and [[Centre national d'\u00e9tudes des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications|CNET]].<ref name=\"Aspec\" /> It provided the highest coding efficiency.\n\nA [[working group]] consisting of van de Kerkhof, Stoll, [[Leonardo Chiariglione]] ([[CSELT]] VP for Media), Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Dehery, Karlheinz Brandenburg (Germany) and James D. Johnston (United States) took ideas from ASPEC, integrated the filter bank from Layer II, added some of their own ideas such as the joint stereo coding of MUSICAM and created the MP3 format, which was designed to achieve the same quality at 128&nbsp;[[kbit/s]] as [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II|MP2]] at 192&nbsp;kbit/s.\n\nThe algorithms for MPEG-1 Audio Layer I, II and III were approved in 1991<ref name=\"cd-1991\" /><ref name=\"neuron2-cd-1991\" /> and finalized in 1992<ref name=\"dis-1992\" /> as part of [[MPEG-1]], the first standard suite by [[MPEG]], which resulted in the international standard '''[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 11172-3''' (a.k.a. ''MPEG-1 Audio'' or ''MPEG-1 Part 3''), published in 1993.<ref name = \"11172-3\" />  Files or data streams conforming to this standard must handle sample rates of 48k, 44100 and 32k and continue to be supported by current [[MP3 player]]s and decoders. Thus the first generation of MP3 defined {{math|14 \u00d7 3 {{=}} 42}} interpretations of MP3 frame data structures and size layouts.\n\nFurther work on MPEG audio<ref name=\"sydney1993\" /> was finalized in 1994 as part of the second suite of MPEG standards, [[MPEG-2]], more formally known as international standard '''ISO/IEC 13818-3''' (a.k.a. ''MPEG-2 Part 3'' or backwards compatible ''MPEG-2 Audio'' or ''MPEG-2 Audio BC''<ref name=\"mpeg-audio-faq-bc\" />), originally published in 1995.<ref name=\"13818-3\" /><ref name=\"Brandenburg1997\" /> MPEG-2 Part 3 (ISO/IEC 13818-3) defined 42 additional bit rates and sample rates for MPEG-1 Audio Layer I, II and III. The new sampling rates are exactly half that of those originally defined in MPEG-1 Audio.  This reduction in sampling rate serves to cut the available frequency fidelity in half while likewise cutting the bitrate by 50%.\nMPEG-2 Part 3 also enhanced MPEG-1's audio by allowing the coding of audio programs with more than two channels, up to 5.1 multichannel.<ref name=\"sydney1993\" /> An MP3 coded with MPEG-2 results in half of the bandwidth reproduction of MPEG-1 appropriate for piano and singing.\n\nA third generation of \"MP3\" style data streams (files) extended the ''MPEG-2'' ideas and implementation but was named ''MPEG-2.5'' audio, since MPEG-3 already had a different meaning.  This extension was developed at Fraunhofer IIS, the registered patent holders of MP3 by reducing the frame sync field in the MP3 header from 12 to 11 bits. As in the transition from MPEG-1 to MPEG-2, MPEG-2.5 adds additional sampling rates exactly half of those available using MPEG-2.  It thus widens the scope of MP3 to include human speech and other applications yet requires only 25% of the bandwidth (frequency reproduction) possible using MPEG-1 sampling rates.  While not an ISO recognized standard, MPEG-2.5 is widely supported by both inexpensive Chinese and brand name digital audio players as well as computer software based MP3 encoders ([[LAME]]), decoders (FFmpeg) and players (MPC) adding {{math|3 \u00d7 8 {{=}} 24}} additional MP3 frame types.  Each generation of MP3 thus supports 3 sampling rates exactly half that of the previous generation for a total of 9 varieties of MP3 format files.  The sample rate comparison table between MPEG-1, 2 and 2.5 is given later in the article.<ref name=\"MPEG-2.5\" /><ref name=\"MPEG-2.5-2\" />  MPEG-2.5 is supported by LAME (since 2000), Media Player Classic (MPC), iTunes, and FFmpeg.\n\nMPEG-2.5 was not developed by MPEG (see above) and was never approved as an international standard.  MPEG-2.5 is thus an unofficial or proprietary extension to the MP3 format.

MPEG-1 Audio) defined three formats: the MPEG-1 Audio Layer I, Layer II and Layer III. The ISO standard ISO/IEC 13818-3 (a.k.a. MPEG-2 Audio) defined extended version of the MPEG-1 Audio: MPEG-2 Audio Layer I, Layer II and Layer III. MPEG-2 Audio (MPEG-2 Part 3) should not be confused with MPEG-2 AAC (MPEG-2 Part 7&nbsp;\u2013 ISO/IEC 13818-7).<ref name=\"mpeg-audio-faq-bc\" />\n\nCompression efficiency of encoders is typically defined by the bit rate, because compression ratio depends on the [[audio bit depth|bit depth]] and [[sampling rate]] of the input signal. Nevertheless, compression ratios are often published. They may use the [[Compact Disc]] (CD) parameters as references (44.1 [[kHz]], 2 channels at 16 bits per channel or 2\u00d716 bit), or sometimes the [[Digital Audio Tape]] (DAT) SP parameters (48&nbsp;kHz, 2\u00d716 bit). Compression ratios with this latter reference are higher, which demonstrates the problem with use of the term ''compression ratio'' for lossy encoders.\n\nKarlheinz Brandenburg used a CD recording of [[Suzanne Vega]]'s song \"[[Tom's Diner]]\" to assess and refine the MP3 [[compression algorithm]]. This song was chosen because of its nearly [[Monaural|monophonic]] nature and wide spectral content, making it easier to hear imperfections in the compression format during playbacks. Some refer to Suzanne Vega as \"The mother of MP3\".<ref name=\"motherofmp3\" /> This particular track has an interesting property in that the two channels are almost, but not completely, the same, leading to a case where Binaural Masking Level Depression causes spatial unmasking of noise artifacts unless the encoder properly recognizes the situation and applies corrections similar to those detailed in the MPEG-2 AAC psychoacoustic model. Some more critical audio excerpts ([[glockenspiel]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[accordion]], etc.) were taken from the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]] V3/SQAM reference compact disc and have been used by professional sound engineers to assess the subjective quality of the MPEG Audio formats. LAME is the most advanced MP3 encoder. LAME includes a VBR variable bit rate encoding which uses a quality parameter rather than a bit rate goal. Later versions 2008+) support an n.nnn quality goal which automatically selects MPEG-2 or MPEG-2.5 sampling rates as appropriate for human speech recordings which need only 5512&nbsp;Hz bandwidth resolution.\n\n=== Going public ===\nA reference simulation software implementation, written in the C language and later known as ''ISO 11172-5'', was developed (in 1991\u20131996) by the members of the ISO MPEG Audio committee in order to produce bit compliant MPEG Audio files (Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3). It was approved as a committee draft of ISO/IEC technical report in March 1994 and printed as document CD 11172-5 in April 1994.<ref name=\"paris_press\" /> It was approved as a draft technical report (DTR/DIS) in November 1994,<ref name=\"singapore_press\" /> finalized in 1996 and published as international standard ISO/IEC TR 11172-5:1998 in 1998.<ref name=\"ISO/IEC TR 11172-5:1998\" /> The [[Reference implementation (computing)|reference software]] in C language was later published as a freely available ISO standard.<ref name=\"Software_Simulation.zip\" /> Working in non-real time on a number of operating systems, it was able to demonstrate the first real time hardware decoding ([[Digital Signal Processor|DSP]] based) of compressed audio.

Because of the relatively small [[hard drive]]s of the era (\u2248500\u20131000 [[megabyte|MB]]) lossy compression was essential to store multiple albums' worth of music on a home computer as full recordings (as opposed to [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] notation, or [[Tracker (music software)|tracker]] files which combined notation with short recordings of instruments playing single notes). As sound scholar Jonathan Sterne notes, \"An Australian hacker acquired [[l3enc]] using a stolen credit card. The hacker then reverse-engineered the software, wrote a new user interface, and redistributed it for free, naming it \"thank you Fraunhofer\"\".<ref name=\"Sterne2012_ThankYou\">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Sterne|title=MP3: The Meaning of a Format|url=https://books.google.com/?id=O9bcwTHMpN0C&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&vq=thank+you+Fraunhofer#v=onepage&q=thank%20you%20Fraunhofer&f=false|date=17 July 2012|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-5287-7|page=202}}</ref>\n\n==== Fraunhofer example implementation ====\nA hacker named SoloH discovered the [[source code]] of the \"dist10\" MPEG [[reference implementation]] shortly after the release on the servers of the [[University of Erlangen]].

The first known experiment in Internet distribution was organized in the early 1990s by the Internet Underground Music Archive, better known by the acronym IUMA. After some experiments<ref>{{cite web | url = https://archive.org/details/iuma-archive&tab=about | title = About Internet Underground Music Archive }}</ref> using uncompressed audio files, this archive started to deliver on the native worldwide low speed Internet some compressed MPEG Audio files using the MP2 (Layer II) format and later on used MP3 files when the standard was fully completed. The popularity of MP3s began to rise rapidly with the advent of [[Nullsoft]]'s audio player [[Winamp]], released in 1997. In 1998, the first portable solid state digital audio player [[MPMan]], developed by [[SaeHan Information Systems]] which is headquartered in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], was released and the [[Rio PMP300]] was sold afterwards in 1998, despite legal suppression efforts by the [[RIAA]].<ref name=\"seattlepi\" />\n\nIn November 1997, the website [[mp3.com]] was offering thousands of MP3s created by independent artists for free.<ref name=\"seattlepi\" /> The small size of MP3 files enabled widespread [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] of music [[Ripping|ripped]] from CDs, which would have previously been nearly impossible. The first large peer-to-peer filesharing network, [[Napster]], was launched in 1999. The ease of creating and sharing MP3s resulted in widespread [[copyright infringement]]. Major record companies argued that this free sharing of music reduced sales, and called it \"[[music piracy]]\". They reacted by pursuing lawsuits against [[Napster]] (which was eventually shut down and later sold) and against individual users who engaged in file sharing.<ref name=\"Giesler\" />\n\nUnauthorized MP3 file sharing continues on next-generation [[peer-to-peer file sharing|peer-to-peer networks]]. Some authorized services, such as [[Beatport]], [[Bleep.com|Bleep]], [[Juno Records]], [[eMusic]], [[Zune Marketplace]], [[Wal-Mart|Walmart.com]], [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]], the recording industry approved re-incarnation of [[Napster (pay service)|Napster]], and [[Amazon.com]] sell unrestricted music in the MP3 format.\n\n== Design ==\n\n=== File structure ===\n{{Panorama\n|image   = File:Mp3filestructure.svg\n|height  = 400\n|alt     = Diagram of the structure of an MP3 file\n|caption = Diagram of the structure of an MP3 file (MPEG version 2.5 not supported, hence 12 instead of 11 bits for MP3 Sync Word).\n}}\n\nAn MP3 file is made up of MP3 frames, which consist of a header and a data block. This sequence of frames is called an [[elementary stream]]. Due to the \"bit reservoir\", frames are not independent items and cannot usually be extracted on arbitrary frame boundaries. The MP3 Data blocks contain the (compressed) audio information in terms of frequencies and amplitudes. The diagram shows that the MP3 Header consists of a [[sync word]], which is used to identify the beginning of a valid frame. This is followed by a bit indicating that this is the [[MPEG]] standard and two bits that indicate that layer 3 is used; hence MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 or MP3. After this, the values will differ, depending on the MP3 file. ''[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 11172-3'' defines the range of values for each section of the header along with the specification of the header. Most MP3 files today contain [[ID3]] [[metadata]], which precedes or follows the MP3 frames, as noted in the diagram. The data stream can contain an optional checksum.\n\n[[Joint stereo]] is done only on a frame-to-frame basis.<ref name=\"Limitations\"/>\n\n=== Encoding and decoding ===\nThe MP3 encoding algorithm is generally split into four parts. Part 1  divides the audio signal into smaller pieces, called frames, and a [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT) filter is then performed on the output. Part 2 passes the sample into a 1024-point [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT), then the [[psychoacoustic]] model is applied and another MDCT filter is performed on the output. Part 3 quantifies and encodes each sample, known as noise allocation, which adjusts itself in order to meet the [[bit rate]] and [[sound masking]] requirements. Part 4 formats the [[bitstream]], called an audio frame, which is made up of 4 parts, the [[Header (computing)|header]], [[Error checking|error check]], [[audio data]], and [[#Ancillary data|ancillary data]].<ref name=\"Guckert\"/>\n\nThe [[MPEG-1]] standard does not include a precise specification for an MP3 encoder, but does provide example psychoacoustic models, rate loop, and the like in the non-normative part of the original standard.<ref name=\"mpeg1\" />\nMPEG-2 doubles the number of sampling rates which are supported and MPEG-2.5 adds 3 more. When this was written, the suggested implementations were quite dated. Implementers of the standard were supposed to devise their own algorithms suitable for removing parts of the information from the audio input. As a result, many different MP3 encoders became available, each producing files of differing quality. Comparisons were widely available, so it was easy for a prospective user of an encoder to research the best choice. Some encoders that were proficient at encoding at higher bit rates (such as [[LAME]]) were not necessarily as good at lower bit rates. Over time, LAME evolved on the SourceForge website until it became the de facto CBR MP3 encoder. Later an ABR mode was added. Work progressed on true variable bit rate using a quality goal between 0 and 10. Eventually numbers (such as -V 9.600) could generate excellent quality low bit rate voice encoding at only 41&nbsp;kbit/s using the MPEG-2.5 extensions.\n\nDuring encoding, 576 time-domain samples are taken and are transformed to 576 [[Fourier Transform|frequency-domain samples]].{{clarify|date=December 2014|reason=576 samples per what? per mpeg-1 frame? This was probably written during the time MP3 encoding algorithms were being developed, criticized and possibly improved by aac proponents. U}} If there is a [[Transient (acoustics)|transient]], 192 samples are taken instead of 576. This is done to limit the temporal spread of quantization noise accompanying the transient. (See [[psychoacoustics]].) Frequency resolution is limited by the small long block window size, which decreases coding efficiency.<ref name=\"Limitations\"/> Time resolution can be too low for highly transient signals and may cause smearing of percussive sounds.<ref name=\"Limitations\" />\n\nDue to the tree structure of the filter bank, pre-echo problems are made worse, as the combined impulse response of the two filter banks does not, and cannot, provide an optimum solution in time/frequency resolution.<ref name=\"Limitations\"/> Additionally, the combining of the two filter banks' outputs creates aliasing problems that must be handled partially by the \"aliasing compensation\" stage; however, that creates excess energy to be coded in the frequency domain, thereby decreasing coding efficiency.{{citation needed| date=December 2010}}\n\nDecoding, on the other hand, is carefully defined in the standard. Most [[Codec|decoders]] are \"[[Elementary stream|bitstream]] compliant\", which means that the decompressed output that they produce from a given MP3 file will be the same, within a specified degree of [[rounding]] tolerance, as the output specified mathematically in the ISO/IEC high standard document (ISO/IEC 11172-3). Therefore, comparison of decoders is usually based on how computationally efficient they are (i.e., how much [[computer memory|memory]] or [[CPU]] time they use in the decoding process). Over time this concern has become less of an issue as CPU speeds transitioned from MHz to GHz. Encoder/decoder overall delay is not defined, which means there is no official provision for [[gapless playback]]. However, some encoders such as LAME can attach additional metadata that will allow players that can handle it to deliver seamless playback.\n\n=== Quality ===\n\nWhen performing lossy audio encoding, such as creating an MP3 data stream, there is a trade-off between the amount of data generated and the sound quality of the results. The person generating an MP3 selects a [[bit rate]], which specifies how many [[kilobits]] per second of audio is desired. The higher the bit rate, the larger the MP3 data stream will be, and, generally, the closer it will sound to the original recording. With too low a bit rate, [[compression artifact]]s (i.e., sounds that were not present in the original recording) may be audible in the reproduction. Some audio is hard to compress because of its randomness and sharp attacks. When this type of audio is compressed, artifacts such as ringing or [[pre-echo]] are usually heard. A sample of applause or a triangle instrument with a relatively low bit rate provide good examples of compression artifacts. Most subjective testings of perceptual codecs tend to avoid using these types of sound materials, however, the artifacts generated by percussive sounds are barely perceptible due to the specific temporal masking feature of the 32 sub-band filterbank of Layer II on which the format is based.\n\nBesides the bit rate of an encoded piece of audio, the quality of MP3 encoded sound also depends on the quality of the encoder algorithm as well as the complexity of the signal being encoded. As the MP3 standard allows quite a bit of freedom with encoding algorithms, different encoders do feature quite different quality, even with identical bit rates. As an example, in a public listening test featuring two early MP3 encoders set at about 128&nbsp;kbit/s,<ref name=\"Amorim\" /> one scored 3.66 on a 1\u20135 scale, while the other scored only 2.22. Quality is dependent on the choice of encoder and encoding parameters.<ref name=\"listening-test-128-2006\" />\n\nThis observation caused a revolution in audio encoding. Early on bitrate was the prime and only consideration. At the time MP3 files were of the very simplest type: they used the same bit rate for the entire file: this process is known as [[Constant bitrate|Constant Bit Rate]] (CBR) encoding. Using a constant bit rate makes encoding simpler and less CPU intensive. However, it is also possible to create files where the bit rate changes throughout the file. These are known as [[Variable bitrate|Variable Bit Rate]]. The bit reservoir and VBR encoding were actually part of the original MPEG-1 standard. The concept behind them is that, in any piece of audio, some sections are easier to compress, such as silence or music containing only a few tones, while others will be more difficult to compress. So, the overall quality of the file may be increased by using a lower bit rate for the less complex passages and a higher one for the more complex parts. With some advanced MP3 encoders, it is possible to specify a given quality, and the encoder will adjust the bit rate accordingly. Users that desire a particular \"quality setting\" that is [[Transparency (data compression)|transparent]] to their ears can use this value when encoding all of their music, and generally speaking not need to worry about performing personal listening tests on each piece of music to determine the correct bit rate.\n\nPerceived quality can be influenced by listening environment (ambient noise), listener attention, and listener training and in most cases by listener audio equipment (such as sound cards, speakers and headphones). Furthermore, sufficient quality may be achieved by a lesser quality setting for lectures and human speech applications and reduces encoding time and complexity. A test given to new students by [[Stanford University]] Music Professor Jonathan Berger showed that student preference for MP3-quality music has risen each year. Berger said the students seem to prefer the 'sizzle' sounds that MP3s bring to music.<ref name=\"Dougherty\"/>\n\nAn in-depth study of MP3 audio quality, sound artist and composer [[Ryan Maguire]]'s project \"The Ghost in the MP3\" isolates the sounds lost during MP3 compression. In 2015, he released the track \"moDernisT\" (an anagram of \"Tom's Diner\"), composed exclusively from the sounds deleted during MP3 compression of the song \"Tom's Diner\",<ref name=\"noisey\" /><ref name=\"schroeder2015\" /><ref name=\"hull2015\" /> the track originally used in the formulation of the MP3 standard. A detailed account of the techniques used to isolate the sounds deleted during MP3 compression, along with the conceptual motivation for the project, was published in the 2014 Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference.<ref name=\"Maguire2014\" />\n\n=== Bit rate ===\n{| class=\"wikitable infobox\"\n|+MPEG Audio Layer III<br />available bit rates (kbit/s)<ref name=\"neuron2-cd-1991\" /><ref name=\"MPEG-2.5\" /><ref name=\"MPEG-2.5-2\" /><ref name=\"mp3tech-iso13818-3\" /><ref name=\"lame-usage\">{{cite web |url=http://lame.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/lame/lame/USAGE |title=Guide to command line options (in CVS) |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref>\n|-\n!

CD audio is 44100 samples per second. The number of bits per sample also depends on the number of audio channels. CD is stereo and 16 bits per channel. So, multiplying 44100 by 32 gives 1411200\u2014the bitrate of uncompressed CD digital audio. MP3 was designed to encode this 1411&nbsp;kbit/s data at 320&nbsp;kbit/s or less. As less complex passages are detected by MP3 algorithms then lower bitrates may be employed. When using MPEG-2 instead of MPEG-1, MP3 supports only lower sampling rates (16000, 22050 or 24000 samples per second) and offers choices of bitrate as low as 8&nbsp;kbit/s but no higher than 160&nbsp;kbit/s. By lowering the sampling rate, MPEG-2 layer III removes all frequencies above half the new sampling rate that may have been present in the source audio.\n\nAs shown in these two tables, 14 selected [[bit rate]]s are allowed in MPEG-1 Audio Layer III standard: 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256 and 320&nbsp;kbit/s, along with the 3 highest available [[sampling frequencies]] of 32, 44.1 and 48&nbsp;[[kHz]].<ref name=\"MPEG-2.5-2\" /> MPEG-2 Audio Layer III also allows 14 somewhat different (and mostly lower) [[bit rates]] of 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160&nbsp;kbit/s with [[sampling frequencies]] of 16, 22.05 and 24&nbsp;[[kHz]] which are exactly half that of MPEG-1<ref name=\"MPEG-2.5-2\" /> MPEG-2.5 Audio Layer III frames are limited to only 8 [[bit rates]] of 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56 and 64&nbsp;kbit/s with 3 even lower [[sampling frequencies]] of 8, 11.025, and 12&nbsp;kHz.{{Citation needed|reason=Based on results from the LAME encoder, these do seem to be the actual bit rates supported by MPEG-2.5, but official documents claim MPEG-2.5 has the same possible bit rates as MPEG-2. Answer: Bitrate switching implies VBR so, it is not CBR anymore. When MPEG-2 frames are needed instead of the smaller 2.5 frames, the former are generated. Can we find a source that mentions this limitation?|date=December 2013}}\n\nMPEG-1 frames contain the most detail in 320&nbsp;kbit/s mode with silence and simple tones still requiring 32&nbsp;kbit/s. MPEG-2 frames can capture up to 12&nbsp;kHz sound reproductions needed up to 160&nbsp;kbit/s. MP3 files made with MPEG-2 don't have 20&nbsp;kHz bandwidth because of the [[Nyquist\u2013Shannon sampling theorem]]. Frequency reproduction is always strictly less than half of the sampling frequency, and imperfect filters require a larger margin for error (noise level versus sharpness of filter), so an 8&nbsp;kHz sampling rate limits the maximum frequency to 4&nbsp;kHz, while a 48&nbsp;kHz sampling rate limits an MP3 to a maximum 24&nbsp;kHz sound reproduction. MPEG-2 uses half and MPEG-2.5 only a quarter of MPEG-1 sample rates.\n\nFor the general field of human speech reproduction, a bandwidth of 5512&nbsp;Hz is sufficient to produce excellent results (for voice) using the sampling rate of 11025 and VBR encoding from 44100 (standard) WAV file. This is easily accomplished using LAME version 3.99.5 and the command line \"lame -V 9.6 lecture.WAV\"  English speakers average 41\u201342&nbsp;kbit/s with -V 9.6 setting but this may vary with amount of silence recorded or the rate of delivery (wpm). Resampling to 12000 (6K bandwidth) is selected by the LAME parameter -V 9.4 Likewise -V 9.2 selects 16000 sample rate and a resultant 8K lowpass filtering. For more info see Nyquist \u2013 Shannon.  Older versions of LAME and FFmpeg only support integer arguments for variable bit rate quality selection parameter.  The n.nnn quality parameter (-V) is documented at lame.sourceforge.net but is only supported in LAME with the new style VBR variable bit rate quality selector\u2014not average bit rate (ABR).\n\nA sample rate of 44.1&nbsp;kHz is commonly used for music reproduction, because this is also used for [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|CD audio]], the main source used for creating MP3 files. A great variety of bit rates are used on the Internet. A bit rate of 128&nbsp;kbit/s is commonly used,<ref name=\"Woon-Seng\" /> at a compression ratio of 11:1, offering adequate audio quality in a relatively small space. As Internet [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] availability and hard drive sizes have increased, higher bit rates up to 320&nbsp;kbit/s are widespread. Uncompressed audio as stored on an audio-CD has a bit rate of 1,411.2&nbsp;kbit/s, (16 bit/sample \u00d7 44100 samples/second \u00d7 2 channels / 1000 bits/kilobit), so the bitrates 128, 160 and 192&nbsp;kbit/s represent [[Data compression ratio|compression ratios]] of approximately 11:1, 9:1 and 7:1 respectively.\n\nNon-standard bit rates up to 640&nbsp;kbit/s can be achieved with the [[LAME]] encoder and the freeformat option, although few MP3 players can play those files. According to the ISO standard, decoders are only required to be able to decode streams up to 320&nbsp;kbit/s.<ref name=\"Bouvigne\" /> Early MPEG Layer III encoders used what is now called [[Constant Bit Rate]] (CBR).  The software was only able to use a uniform bitrate on all frames in an MP3 file. Later more sophisticated MP3 encoders were able to use the bit reservoir to target an [[average bit rate]] selecting the encoding rate for each frame based on the complexity of the sound in that portion of the recording.\n\nA more sophisticated MP3 encoder can produce [[variable bitrate]] audio. MPEG audio may use bitrate switching on a per-frame basis, but only layer III decoders must support it.<ref name=\"MPEG-2.5-2\" /><ref name=\"LAME_GPSYCHO\" /><ref name=\"TwoLAME\" /><ref name=\"MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 BC\" /> VBR is used when the goal is to achieve a fixed level of quality. The final file size of a VBR encoding is less predictable than with [[constant bitrate]]. [[Average bitrate]] is a type of VBR implemented as a compromise between the two: the bitrate is allowed to vary for more consistent quality, but is controlled to remain near an average value chosen by the user, for predictable file sizes. Although an MP3 decoder must support VBR to be standards compliant, historically some decoders have bugs with VBR decoding, particularly before VBR encoders became widespread. The most evolved LAME MP3 encoder supports the generation of VBR, ABR, and even the ancient CBR MP3 formats.\n\nLayer III audio can also use a \"bit reservoir\", a partially full frame's ability to hold part of the next frame's audio data, allowing temporary changes in effective bitrate, even in a constant bitrate stream.<ref name=\"MPEG-2.5-2\" /><ref name=\"LAME_GPSYCHO\" /> Internal handling of the bit reservoir increases encoding delay.{{citation needed| date=December 2010}} There is no scale factor band 21 (sfb21) for frequencies above approx 16&nbsp;[[kHz]], forcing the encoder to choose between less accurate representation in band 21 or less efficient storage in all bands below band 21, the latter resulting in wasted bitrate in VBR encoding.<ref name=\"LAME Y\" />\n\n=== Ancillary data ===\nThe ancillary data field can be used to store user defined data. The ancillary data is optional and the number of bits available is not explicitly given. The ancillary data is located after the Huffman code bits and ranges to where the next frame's main_data_begin points to. Encoder [[mp3PRO]] used ancillary data to encode extra information which could improve audio quality when decoded with its own algorithm.\n\n=== Metadata ===\n{{main|ID3|APEv2 tag}}\n\nA \"tag\" in an audio file is a section of the file that contains [[metadata]] such as the title, artist, album, track number or other information about the file's contents. The MP3 standards do not define tag formats for MP3 files, nor is there a standard [[container format (digital)|container format]] that would support metadata and obviate the need for tags. However, several ''de facto'' standards for tag formats exist. As of 2010, the most widespread are [[ID3|ID3v1 and ID3v2]], and the more recently introduced [[APEv2 tag|APEv2]]. These tags are normally embedded at the beginning or end of MP3 files, separate from the actual MP3 frame data. MP3 decoders either extract information from the tags, or just treat them as ignorable, non-MP3 junk data.\n\nPlaying and editing software often contains tag editing functionality, but there are also [[tag editor]] applications dedicated to the purpose. Aside from metadata pertaining to the audio content, tags may also be used for [[Digital rights management|DRM]].<ref name=\"Rae\" /> [[ReplayGain]] is a standard for measuring and storing the loudness of an MP3 file ([[audio normalization]]) in its metadata tag, enabling a ReplayGain-compliant player to automatically adjust the overall playback volume for each file. [[MP3Gain]] may be used to reversibly modify files based on ReplayGain measurements so that adjusted playback can be achieved on players without ReplayGain capability.\n\n== {{anchor|Licensing and patent issues}}Licensing, ownership, and legislation ==\n\nThe basic MP3 decoding and encoding technology is patent-free in the European Union, all patents having expired there by 2012 at the latest. In the United States, the technology became substantially patent-free on 16 April 2017 (see below). MP3 patents expired in the US between 2007 and 2017. In the past, many organizations have claimed ownership of [[patent]]s related to MP3 decoding or encoding. These claims led to a number of legal threats and actions from a variety of sources. As a result, uncertainty about which patents must be licensed in order to create MP3 products without committing patent infringement in countries that allow [[software patent]]s was a common feature of the early stages of adoption of the technology.\n\nThe initial near-complete MPEG-1 standard (parts 1, 2 and 3) was publicly available on 6 December 1991 as ISO CD 11172.<ref name=\"Patel\" /><ref name=\"mpegfa31.txt\" /> In most countries, patents cannot be filed after prior art has been made public, and patents expire 20 years after the initial filing date, which can be up to 12 months later for filings in other countries. As a result, patents required to implement MP3 expired in most countries by December 2012, 21 years after the publication of ISO CD 11172.\n\nAn exception is the United States, where patents in force but filed prior to 8 June 1995 expire after the later of 17 years from the issue date or 20 years from the priority date. A lengthy patent prosecution process may result in a patent issuing much later than normally expected (see [[submarine patent]]s).  The various MP3-related patents expired on dates ranging from 2007 to 2017 in the United States.<ref name=\"big-list\" />  Patents for anything disclosed in ISO CD 11172 filed a year or more after its publication are questionable.  If only the known MP3 patents filed by December 1992 are considered, then MP3 decoding has been patent-free in the US since 22 September 2015, when {{US patent|5812672}}, which had a PCT filing in October 1992, expired.<ref name=\"Cogliati\" /><ref name=\"US5812672\" /><ref name=\"Patent expiration\" />  If the longest-running patent mentioned in the aforementioned references is taken as a measure, then the MP3 technology became patent-free in the United States on 16 April 2017, when {{US patent|6009399}}, held<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.google.com/patents/US6009399 |title= Patent US6009399 \u2013 Method and apparatus for encoding digital signals ... \u2013 Google Patents}}</ref> and administered by [[Technicolor SA|Technicolor]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mp3licensing.com/patents/index.html|title=mp3licensing.com \u2013 Patents|work=mp3licensing.com}}</ref> expired.  As a result, many [[free and open-source software]] projects, such as the [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora operating system]], have decided to start shipping MP3 support by default, and users will no longer have to resort to installing unofficial packages maintained by third party software repositories for MP3 playback or encoding.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://fedoramagazine.org/full-mp3-support-coming-soon-to-fedora/ | title=Full MP3 support coming soon to Fedora| date=2017-05-05}}</ref>\n\n[[Technicolor SA|Technicolor]] (formerly called Thomson Consumer Electronics) claimed to control MP3 licensing of the Layer 3 patents in many countries, including the United States, Japan, Canada and EU countries.<ref name=\"ffii\" /> Technicolor had been actively enforcing these patents.<ref name=\"Technicolor\" /> MP3 license revenues from Technicolor's administration generated about \u20ac100 million for the Fraunhofer Society in 2005.<ref name=\"Kistenfeger\" /> In September 1998, the Fraunhofer Institute sent a letter to several developers of MP3 software stating that a license was required to \"distribute and/or sell decoders and/or encoders\". The letter claimed that unlicensed products \"infringe the patent rights of Fraunhofer and Thomson. To make, sell or distribute products using the [MPEG Layer-3] standard and thus our patents, you need to obtain a license under these patents from us.\"<ref name=\"chillingeffects\" /> This led to the situation where the [[LAME]] MP3 encoder project could not offer its users official binaries that could run on their computer. The project's position was that as source code, LAME was simply a description of how an MP3 encoder ''could'' be implemented. Unofficially, compiled binaries were available from other sources.\n\nSisvel S.p.A.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sisvel.com/licensing-programs/audio-and-video-coding-decoding/mpeg-audio/introduction | title = SISVEL's MPEG Audio licensing programme }}</ref> and its United States subsidiary Audio MPEG, Inc. previously sued Thomson for patent infringement on MP3 technology,<ref name=\"ZDNet India\" /> but those disputes were resolved in November 2005 with Sisvel granting Thomson a license to their patents. Motorola followed soon after, and signed with Sisvel to license MP3-related patents in December 2005.<ref name=\"SISVEL\" /> Except for three patents, the US patents administered by Sisvel<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sisvel.com/MPEG_Audio/US_Patents.pdf |title = US MPEG Audio patents |publisher = Sisvel}}</ref> had all expired in 2015. The three exceptions are: {{US patent|5878080}}, expired February 2017; {{US patent|5850456}}, expired February 2017; and {{US patent|5960037}}, expired 9 April 2017.\n\nIn September 2006, German officials seized MP3 players from [[SanDisk]]'s booth at the [[IFA show]] in Berlin after an Italian patents firm won an injunction on behalf of Sisvel against SanDisk in a dispute over licensing rights. The injunction was later reversed by a Berlin judge,<ref name=\"SanDisk MP3 seizure\" /> but that reversal was in turn blocked the same day by another judge from the same court, \"bringing the Patent Wild West to Germany\" in the words of one commentator.<ref name=\"Patent Wild West\" /> In February 2007, Texas MP3 Technologies sued Apple, Samsung Electronics and Sandisk in [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas|eastern Texas federal court]], claiming infringement of a portable MP3 player patent that Texas MP3 said it had been assigned. Apple, Samsung, and Sandisk all settled the claims against them in January 2009.<ref name=\"law360\" /><ref name=\"Kelly\" />\n\n[[Alcatel-Lucent]] has asserted several MP3 coding and compression patents, allegedly inherited from AT&T-Bell Labs, in litigation of its own. In November 2006, before the companies' merger, Alcatel [[Alcatel-Lucent v. Microsoft|sued]] [[Microsoft]] for allegedly infringing seven patents. On 23 February 2007, a San Diego jury awarded [[Alcatel-Lucent]] US $1.52 billion in damages for infringement of two of them.<ref name=\"MP3 payout\" /> The court subsequently revoked the award, however, finding that one patent had not been infringed and that the other was not owned by [[Alcatel-Lucent]]; it was co-owned by [[AT&T Inc.|AT&T]] and Fraunhofer, who had licensed it to [[Microsoft]], the judge ruled.<ref name=\"Microsoft wins reversal\" /> That defense judgment was upheld on appeal in 2008.<ref name=\"Alcatel-Lucent\" /> See [[Alcatel-Lucent v. Microsoft]] for more information.\n\n== Alternative technologies ==\n{{sound|filename=Test ogg mp3 48kbps.wav|title=Comparison between MP3 and Vorbis|description=The first is uncompressed WAV file. The second is a Vorbis file encoded at 48kbit/s, and third is an MP3 encoded at 48kbit/s using [[LAME]].}}\n{{Main|List of codecs}}\n\nOther lossy formats exist. Among these, [[Advanced Audio Coding]] (AAC) is the most widely used, and was designed to be the successor to MP3. There also exist other lossy formats such as [[mp3PRO]] and [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II|MP2]]. They are members of the same technological family as MP3 and depend on roughly similar [[Psychoacoustics|psychoacoustic models]] and [[MDCT]] algorithms. Whereas MP3 uses a hybrid coding approach that is part MDCT and part [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]], AAC is purely MDCT, significantly improving compression efficiency.<ref name=\"brandenburg\"/> Many of the basic [[patent]]s underlying these formats are held by [[Fraunhofer Society]], Alcatel-Lucent, [[Technicolor SA|Thomson Consumer Electronics]],<ref name=\"brandenburg\" /> [[Bell Labs|Bell]], [[Dolby Laboratories|Dolby]], [[LG Electronics]], [[NEC]], [[NTT Docomo]], [[Panasonic]], [[Sony Corporation]],<ref name=\"businesswire\">{{cite web |title=Via Licensing Announces Updated AAC Joint Patent License |url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20090105005026/en/Licensing-Announces-Updated-AAC-Joint-Patent-License |website=[[Business Wire]] |accessdate=18 June 2019 |date=5 January 2009}}</ref> [[ETRI]], [[JVC Kenwood]], [[Philips]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]].<ref name=\"aac-licensors\">{{cite web |title=AAC Licensors |url=http://www.via-corp.com/us/en/licensing/aac/licensors.html |website=Via Corp |accessdate=6 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere are also open compression formats like [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]] and [[Vorbis]] that are available free of charge and without any known patent restrictions. Some of the newer audio compression formats, such as AAC, WMA Pro and Vorbis, are free of some limitations inherent to the MP3 format that cannot be overcome by any MP3 encoder.<ref name=\"big-list\" />\n\nBesides lossy compression methods, [[Lossless compression|lossless formats]] are a significant alternative to MP3 because they provide unaltered audio content, though with an increased file size compared to lossy compression. Lossless formats include [[FLAC]] (Free Lossless Audio Codec), [[Apple Lossless]] and many others.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Comparison of audio coding formats]]\n* [[MP3 blog]]\n* [[MP3 player]]\n*

format]] for [[digital audio]]. Originally defined as the third audio format of the [[MPEG-1]] standard, it was retained and further extended\u2014defining additional bit-rates and support for more [[surround channels|audio channels]]\u2014as the third audio format of the subsequent [[MPEG-2]] standard. A third version, known as MPEG 2.5\u2014extended to better support lower bit rates\u2014is commonly implemented, but is not a recognized standard.\n\n'''MP3''' (or '''mp3''') as a [[file format]] commonly designates files containing an [[elementary stream]] of MPEG-1 Audio or MPEG-2 Audio encoded data, without other complexities of the MP3 standard.\n\nIn regard to [[audio compression (data)|audio compression]] (the aspect of the standard most apparent to end-users, and for which is it best known), MP3 uses [[lossy compression|lossy data-compression]] to encode data using inexact approximations and the partial discarding of data. This allows a large reduction in file sizes when compared to uncompressed audio. The combination of small size and acceptable fidelity led to a boom in the distribution of music over the Internet in the mid- to late-1990s, with MP3 serving as an enabling technology at a time when bandwidth and storage were still at a premium.  The MP3 format soon became associated with controversies surrounding [[copyright infringement]], [[music piracy]], and the file [[ripping]]/[[file sharing|sharing]] services [[MP3.com]] and [[Napster]], among others. With the advent of [[portable media player]]s, a product category also including [[smartphones]], MP3 support remains near-universal.\n\nMP3 compression works by reducing (or approximating) the accuracy of certain components of sound that are considered (by psychoacoustic analysis) to be beyond the [[Hearing range#Humans|hearing capabilities]] of most humans. This method is commonly referred to as perceptual coding or as [[psychoacoustics|psychoacoustic]] modeling.<ref name=\"Jayant1993\" /> The remaining audio information is then recorded in a space-efficient manner, using [[Modified discrete cosine transform|MDCT]] and [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]] algorithms. Compared to [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-quality digital audio]], MP3 compression can commonly achieve a 75 to 95% reduction in size. For example, an MP3 encoded at a constant bitrate of 128&nbsp;kbit/s would result in a file approximately 9% of the size of the original CD audio.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000012.shtml |title= MP3 (MPEG Layer III Audio Encoding) |date= 27 July 2017 |publisher= The Library of Congress |access-date= 9 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] (MPEG) designed MP3 as part of its [[MPEG-1]], and later [[MPEG-2]], standards.

In 1894, the American physicist [[Alfred M. Mayer]] reported that a tone could be rendered inaudible by another tone of lower frequency.<ref name=\"Mayer1894\" /> In 1959, Richard Ehmer described a complete set of auditory curves regarding this phenomenon.<ref name=\"Ehmer1959\" /> Between 1967 and 1974, Eberhard F.

In December 1988, MPEG called for an audio coding standard. In June 1989, 14 audio coding algorithms were submitted. Because of certain similarities between these coding proposals, they were clustered into four development groups. The first group was [[MUSICAM]], by [[Panasonic|Matsushita]], [[Centre commun d'\u00e9tudes de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision et t\u00e9l\u00e9communications|CCETT]], ITT and [[Philips]]. The second group was ASPEC, by [[AT&T]], [[France Telecom]], [[Fraunhofer Gesellschaft]], Deutsche and [[Thomson-CSF|Thomson-Brandt]]. The third group was ATAC, by [[Fujitsu]], [[JVC]], [[NEC]] and [[Sony]]. And the fourth group was [[SB-ADPCM]], by [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]] and BTRL.<ref name=\"musmann\"/>\n\nThe immediate predecessors of MP3 were \"Optimum Coding in the Frequency Domain\" (OCF),<ref name=\"Brandenburg\" /> and Perceptual Transform Coding (PXFM).<ref name=\"Johnston1988\" /> These two codecs, along with block-switching contributions from Thomson-Brandt, were merged into a codec called ASPEC, which was submitted to MPEG, and which won the quality competition, but that was mistakenly rejected as too complex to implement. The first practical implementation of an audio perceptual coder (OCF) in hardware (Krasner's hardware was too cumbersome and slow for practical use), was an implementation of a psychoacoustic transform coder based on [[Motorola 56000]] [[Digital Signal Processor|DSP]] chips.\n\nAnother predecessor of the MP3 format and technology is to be found in the perceptual codec MUSICAM based on an integer arithmetics 32 sub-bands filterbank, driven by a psychoacoustic model. It was primarily designed for Digital Audio Broadcasting (digital radio) and digital TV, and its basic principles disclosed to the scientific community by CCETT (France) and IRT (Germany) in Atlanta during an IEEE-ICASSP conference in 1991,<ref>Y.F. Dehery, et al.  (1991)  A MUSICAM source codec for Digital Audio Broadcasting and storage Proceedings IEEE-ICASSP 91 pages 3605\u20133608 May 1991</ref> after having worked on MUSICAM with [[Panasonic|Matsushita]] and Philips since 1989.<ref name=\"musmann\"/>\n\nThis codec incorporated into a broadcasting system using COFDM modulation was demonstrated on air and on the field<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1991/BC-1991-04-15.pdf | title = A DAB commentary from Alan Box, EZ communication and chairman NAB DAB task force }}</ref> together with Radio Canada and CRC Canada during the NAB show (Las Vegas) in 1991. The implementation of the audio part of this broadcasting system was based on a two chips encoder (one for the subband transform, one for the psychoacoustic model designed by the team of [[G. Stoll]] (IRT Germany), later known as psychoacoustic model I) and a real time decoder using one [[Motorola 56001]] [[Digital Signal Processor|DSP]] chip running an integer arithmetics software designed by Y.F. Dehery's team ([[Centre commun d'\u00e9tudes de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision et t\u00e9l\u00e9communications|CCETT]], France). The simplicity of the corresponding decoder together with the high audio quality of this codec using for the first time a 48&nbsp;kHz sampling frequency, a 20 bits/sample input format (the highest available sampling standard in 1991, compatible with the AES/EBU professional digital input studio standard) were the main reasons to later adopt the characteristics of MUSICAM as the basic features for an advanced digital music compression codec.\n\nDuring the development of the MUSICAM encoding software, Stoll and Dehery's team made a thorough use of a set of high quality audio assessment material<ref>{{cite book | url = https://tech.ebu.ch/publications/sqamcd | title = EBU SQAM CD Sound Quality Assessment Material recordings for subjective tests | date = 2008-10-07 }}</ref> selected by a group of audio professionals from the European Broadcasting Union and later used as a reference for the assessment of music compression codecs .   The subband coding technique was found to be efficient, not only for the perceptual coding of the high quality sound materials but especially for the encoding of critical percussive sound materials (drums, triangle, ..) due to the specific temporal masking effect of the MUSICAM sub-band filterbank (this advantage being a specific feature of short transform coding techniques).\n\nAs a doctoral student at Germany's [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]], [[Karlheinz Brandenburg]] began working on digital music compression in the early 1980s, focusing on how people perceive music. He completed his doctoral work in 1989.<ref name=\"BusinessWeek_2007\" /> MP3 is directly descended from OCF and PXFM, representing the outcome of the collaboration of Brandenburg\u2014working as a postdoc at AT&T-Bell Labs with James D. Johnston (\"JJ\") of AT&T-Bell Labs\u2014with the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits, Erlangen (where he worked with [[Bernhard Grill]] and four other researchers \u2013 \"The Original Six\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=How Music Got Free: The End of an Industry, the Turn of the Century, and the Patient Zero of Piracy|last=Witt|first=Stephen|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2016|isbn=978-0143109341|location=United States of America|pages=13|quote=Brandenburg and Grill were joined by four other Fraunhofer researchers. Heinz Gerhauser oversaw the institute\u00b4s audio research group; [[Harald Popp]] was a hardware specialist; Ernst Eberlein was a signal processing expert; Jurgen Herre was another graduate student whose mathematical prowess rivaled Brandenburg\u00b4s own. In later years this group would refer to themselves as \"the original six\".|via=}}</ref>), with relatively minor contributions from the MP2 branch of psychoacoustic sub-band coders. In 1990, Brandenburg became an assistant professor at Erlangen-Nuremberg. While there, he continued to work on music compression with scientists at the [[Fraunhofer Society]]'s [[Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications|Heinrich Herz Institute]] (in 1993 he joined the staff of Fraunhofer HHI).<ref name=\"BusinessWeek_2007\" /> The song \"[[Tom's Diner]]\" by [[Suzanne Vega]] was the first song used by Karlheinz Brandenburg to develop the MP3. Brandenburg adopted the song for testing purposes, listening to it again and again each time refining the scheme, making sure it did not adversely affect the subtlety of Vega's voice.<ref name=\"Sterne2012_Vega\"/>\n\n=== Standardization ===\n\nIn 1991, there were two available proposals that were assessed for an MPEG audio standard: [[MUSICAM]] (<u>M</u>asking pattern adapted <u>U</u>niversal <u>S</u>ubband <u>I</u>ntegrated <u>C</u>oding <u>A</u>nd <u>M</u>ultiplexing) and ASPEC (<u>A</u>daptive <u>S</u>pectral <u>P</u>erceptual <u>E</u>ntropy <u>C</u>oding). The MUSICAM technique, proposed by [[Philips]] (Netherlands), [[Centre commun d'\u00e9tudes de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision et t\u00e9l\u00e9communications|CCETT]] (France), the [[Institut f\u00fcr Rundfunktechnik|Institute for Broadcast Technology]] (Germany), and [[Matsushita]] (Japan),<ref>Digital Video and Audio Broadcasting Technology: A Practical Engineering Guide (Signals and Communication Technology) {{ISBN|3-540-76357-0}} p. 144: \"In the year 1988, the MASCAM method was developed at the Institut f\u00fcr Rundfunktechnik (IRT) in Munich in preparation for the digital audio broadcasting (DAB) system. From MASCAM, the MUSICAM (masking pattern universal subband integrated coding and multiplexing) method was developed in 1989 in cooperation with CCETT, Philips and Matsushita.\"</ref> was chosen due to its simplicity and error robustness, as well as for its high level of computational efficiency.<ref name=\"santa-clara-1990\" /> The MUSICAM format, based on [[sub-band coding]], became the basis for the MPEG Audio compression format, incorporating, for example, its frame structure, header format, sample rates, etc.\n\nWhile much of MUSICAM technology and ideas were incorporated into the definition of MPEG Audio Layer I and Layer II, the filter bank alone and the data structure based on 1152 samples framing (file format and byte oriented stream) of MUSICAM remained in the Layer III (MP3) format, as part of the computationally inefficient hybrid [[filter (software)|filter]] bank. Under the chairmanship of Professor Musmann of the [[Leibniz University Hannover]], the editing of the standard was delegated to Leon van de Kerkhof (Netherlands), Gerhard Stoll (Germany), and Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Dehery (France), who worked on Layer I and Layer II. ASPEC was the joint proposal of AT&T Bell Laboratories, Thomson Consumer Electronics, Fraunhofer Society and [[Centre national d'\u00e9tudes des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications|CNET]].<ref name=\"Aspec\" /> It provided the highest coding efficiency.\n\nA [[working group]] consisting of van de Kerkhof, Stoll, [[Leonardo Chiariglione]] ([[CSELT]] VP for Media), Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Dehery, Karlheinz Brandenburg (Germany) and James D. Johnston (United States) took ideas from ASPEC, integrated the filter bank from Layer II, added some of their own ideas such as the joint stereo coding of MUSICAM and created the MP3 format, which was designed to achieve the same quality at 128&nbsp;[[kbit/s]] as [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II|MP2]] at 192&nbsp;kbit/s.\n\nThe algorithms for MPEG-1 Audio Layer I, II and III were approved in 1991<ref name=\"cd-1991\" /><ref name=\"neuron2-cd-1991\" /> and finalized in 1992<ref name=\"dis-1992\" /> as part of [[MPEG-1]], the first standard suite by [[MPEG]], which resulted in the international standard '''[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 11172-3''' (a.k.a. ''MPEG-1 Audio'' or ''MPEG-1 Part 3''), published in 1993.<ref name = \"11172-3\" />  Files or data streams conforming to this standard must handle sample rates of 48k, 44100 and 32k and continue to be supported by current [[MP3 player]]s and decoders. Thus the first generation of MP3 defined {{math|14 \u00d7 3 {{=}} 42}} interpretations of MP3 frame data structures and size layouts.\n\nFurther work on MPEG audio<ref name=\"sydney1993\" /> was finalized in 1994 as part of the second suite of MPEG standards, [[MPEG-2]], more formally known as international standard '''ISO/IEC 13818-3''' (a.k.a. ''MPEG-2 Part 3'' or backwards compatible ''MPEG-2 Audio'' or ''MPEG-2 Audio BC''<ref name=\"mpeg-audio-faq-bc\" />), originally published in 1995.<ref name=\"13818-3\" /><ref name=\"Brandenburg1997\" /> MPEG-2 Part 3 (ISO/IEC 13818-3) defined 42 additional bit rates and sample rates for MPEG-1 Audio Layer I, II and III. The new sampling rates are exactly half that of those originally defined in MPEG-1 Audio.  This reduction in sampling rate serves to cut the available frequency fidelity in half while likewise cutting the bitrate by 50%.\nMPEG-2 Part 3 also enhanced MPEG-1's audio by allowing the coding of audio programs with more than two channels, up to 5.1 multichannel.<ref name=\"sydney1993\" /> An MP3 coded with MPEG-2 results in half of the bandwidth reproduction of MPEG-1 appropriate for piano and singing.\n\nA third generation of \"MP3\" style data streams (files) extended the ''MPEG-2'' ideas and implementation but was named ''MPEG-2.5'' audio, since MPEG-3 already had a different meaning.  This extension was developed at Fraunhofer IIS, the registered patent holders of MP3 by reducing the frame sync field in the MP3 header from 12 to 11 bits. As in the transition from MPEG-1 to MPEG-2, MPEG-2.5 adds additional sampling rates exactly half of those available using MPEG-2.  It thus widens the scope of MP3 to include human speech and other applications yet requires only 25% of the bandwidth (frequency reproduction) possible using MPEG-1 sampling rates.  While not an ISO recognized standard, MPEG-2.5 is widely supported by both inexpensive Chinese and brand name digital audio players as well as computer software based MP3 encoders ([[LAME]]), decoders (FFmpeg) and players (MPC) adding {{math|3 \u00d7 8 {{=}} 24}} additional MP3 frame types.  Each generation of MP3 thus supports 3 sampling rates exactly half that of the previous generation for a total of 9 varieties of MP3 format files.  The sample rate comparison table between MPEG-1, 2 and 2.5 is given later in the article.<ref name=\"MPEG-2.5\" /><ref name=\"MPEG-2.5-2\" />  MPEG-2.5 is supported by LAME (since 2000), Media Player Classic (MPC), iTunes, and FFmpeg.\n\nMPEG-2.5 was not developed by MPEG (see above) and was never approved as an international standard.  MPEG-2.5 is thus an unofficial or proprietary extension to the MP3 format. It is nonetheless ubiquitous and especially advantageous for low-bit rate human speech applications.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+MPEG Audio Layer III versions<ref name=\"11172-3\" /><ref name=\"13818-3\" /><ref name=\"neuron2-cd-1991\" /><ref name=\"MPEG-2.5\" /><ref name=\"MPEG-2.5-2\" /><ref name=\"mp3tech-iso13818-3\" />\n|-\n!

MPEG-1 Audio) defined three formats: the MPEG-1 Audio Layer I, Layer II and Layer III. The ISO standard ISO/IEC 13818-3 (a.k.a. MPEG-2 Audio) defined extended version of the MPEG-1 Audio: MPEG-2 Audio Layer I, Layer II and Layer III. MPEG-2 Audio (MPEG-2 Part 3) should not be confused with MPEG-2 AAC (MPEG-2 Part 7&nbsp;\u2013 ISO/IEC 13818-7).<ref name=\"mpeg-audio-faq-bc\" />\n\nCompression efficiency of encoders is typically defined by the bit rate, because compression ratio depends on the [[audio bit depth|bit depth]] and [[sampling rate]] of the input signal. Nevertheless, compression ratios are often published. They may use the [[Compact Disc]] (CD) parameters as references (44.1 [[kHz]], 2 channels at 16 bits per channel or 2\u00d716 bit), or sometimes the [[Digital Audio Tape]] (DAT) SP parameters (48&nbsp;kHz, 2\u00d716 bit). Compression ratios with this latter reference are higher, which demonstrates the problem with use of the term ''compression ratio'' for lossy encoders.\n\nKarlheinz Brandenburg used a CD recording of [[Suzanne Vega]]'s song \"[[Tom's Diner]]\" to assess and refine the MP3 [[compression algorithm]]. This song was chosen because of its nearly [[Monaural|monophonic]] nature and wide spectral content, making it easier to hear imperfections in the compression format during playbacks. Some refer to Suzanne Vega as \"The mother of MP3\".<ref name=\"motherofmp3\" /> This particular track has an interesting property in that the two channels are almost, but not completely, the same, leading to a case where Binaural Masking Level Depression causes spatial unmasking of noise artifacts unless the encoder properly recognizes the situation and applies corrections similar to those detailed in the MPEG-2 AAC psychoacoustic model. Some more critical audio excerpts ([[glockenspiel]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[accordion]], etc.) were taken from the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]] V3/SQAM reference compact disc and have been used by professional sound engineers to assess the subjective quality of the MPEG Audio formats. LAME is the most advanced MP3 encoder. LAME includes a VBR variable bit rate encoding which uses a quality parameter rather than a bit rate goal. Later versions 2008+) support an n.nnn quality goal which automatically selects MPEG-2 or MPEG-2.5 sampling rates as appropriate for human speech recordings which need only 5512&nbsp;Hz bandwidth resolution.\n\n=== Going public ===\nA reference simulation software implementation, written in the C language and later known as ''ISO 11172-5'', was developed (in 1991\u20131996) by the members of the ISO MPEG Audio committee in order to produce bit compliant MPEG Audio files (Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3). It was approved as a committee draft of ISO/IEC technical report in March 1994 and printed as document CD 11172-5 in April 1994.<ref name=\"paris_press\" /> It was approved as a draft technical report (DTR/DIS) in November 1994,<ref name=\"singapore_press\" /> finalized in 1996 and published as international standard ISO/IEC TR 11172-5:1998 in 1998.<ref name=\"ISO/IEC TR 11172-5:1998\" /> The [[Reference implementation (computing)|reference software]] in C language was later published as a freely available ISO standard.<ref name=\"Software_Simulation.zip\" /> Working in non-real time on a number of operating systems, it was able to demonstrate the first real time hardware decoding ([[Digital Signal Processor|DSP]] based) of compressed audio.

Because of the relatively small [[hard drive]]s of the era (\u2248500\u20131000 [[megabyte|MB]]) lossy compression was essential to store multiple albums' worth of music on a home computer as full recordings (as opposed to [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] notation, or [[Tracker (music software)|tracker]] files which combined notation with short recordings of instruments playing single notes). As sound scholar Jonathan Sterne notes, \"An Australian hacker acquired [[l3enc]] using a stolen credit card. The hacker then reverse-engineered the software, wrote a new user interface, and redistributed it for free, naming it \"thank you Fraunhofer\"\".<ref name=\"Sterne2012_ThankYou\">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Sterne|title=MP3: The Meaning of a Format|url=https://books.google.com/?id=O9bcwTHMpN0C&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&vq=thank+you+Fraunhofer#v=onepage&q=thank%20you%20Fraunhofer&f=false|date=17 July 2012|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-5287-7|page=202}}</ref>\n\n==== Fraunhofer example implementation ====\nA hacker named SoloH discovered the [[source code]] of the \"dist10\" MPEG [[reference implementation]] shortly after the release on the servers of the [[University of Erlangen]].

The first known experiment in Internet distribution was organized in the early 1990s by the Internet Underground Music Archive, better known by the acronym IUMA. After some experiments<ref>{{cite web | url = https://archive.org/details/iuma-archive&tab=about | title = About Internet Underground Music Archive }}</ref> using uncompressed audio files, this archive started to deliver on the native worldwide low speed Internet some compressed MPEG Audio files using the MP2 (Layer II) format and later on used MP3 files when the standard was fully completed. The popularity of MP3s began to rise rapidly with the advent of [[Nullsoft]]'s audio player [[Winamp]], released in 1997. In 1998, the first portable solid state digital audio player [[MPMan]], developed by [[SaeHan Information Systems]] which is headquartered in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], was released and the [[Rio PMP300]] was sold afterwards in 1998, despite legal suppression efforts by the [[RIAA]].<ref name=\"seattlepi\" />\n\nIn November 1997, the website [[mp3.com]] was offering thousands of MP3s created by independent artists for free.<ref name=\"seattlepi\" /> The small size of MP3 files enabled widespread [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] of music [[Ripping|ripped]] from CDs, which would have previously been nearly impossible. The first large peer-to-peer filesharing network, [[Napster]], was launched in 1999. The ease of creating and sharing MP3s resulted in widespread [[copyright infringement]]. Major record companies argued that this free sharing of music reduced sales, and called it \"[[music piracy]]\". They reacted by pursuing lawsuits against [[Napster]] (which was eventually shut down and later sold) and against individual users who engaged in file sharing.<ref name=\"Giesler\" />\n\nUnauthorized MP3 file sharing continues on next-generation [[peer-to-peer file sharing|peer-to-peer networks]]. Some authorized services, such as [[Beatport]], [[Bleep.com|Bleep]], [[Juno Records]], [[eMusic]], [[Zune Marketplace]], [[Wal-Mart|Walmart.com]], [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]], the recording industry approved re-incarnation of [[Napster (pay service)|Napster]], and [[Amazon.com]] sell unrestricted music in the MP3 format.\n\n== Design ==\n\n=== File structure ===\n{{Panorama\n|image   = File:Mp3filestructure.svg\n|height  = 400\n|alt     = Diagram of the structure of an MP3 file\n|caption = Diagram of the structure of an MP3 file (MPEG version 2.5 not supported, hence 12 instead of 11 bits for MP3 Sync Word).\n}}\n\nAn MP3 file is made up of MP3 frames, which consist of a header and a data block. This sequence of frames is called an [[elementary stream]]. Due to the \"bit reservoir\", frames are not independent items and cannot usually be extracted on arbitrary frame boundaries. The MP3 Data blocks contain the (compressed) audio information in terms of frequencies and amplitudes. The diagram shows that the MP3 Header consists of a [[sync word]], which is used to identify the beginning of a valid frame. This is followed by a bit indicating that this is the [[MPEG]] standard and two bits that indicate that layer 3 is used; hence MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 or MP3. After this, the values will differ, depending on the MP3 file. ''[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 11172-3'' defines the range of values for each section of the header along with the specification of the header. Most MP3 files today contain [[ID3]] [[metadata]], which precedes or follows the MP3 frames, as noted in the diagram. The data stream can contain an optional checksum.\n\n[[Joint stereo]] is done only on a frame-to-frame basis.<ref name=\"Limitations\"/>\n\n=== Encoding and decoding ===\nThe MP3 encoding algorithm is generally split into four parts. Part 1  divides the audio signal into smaller pieces, called frames, and a [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT) filter is then performed on the output. Part 2 passes the sample into a 1024-point [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT), then the [[psychoacoustic]] model is applied and another MDCT filter is performed on the output. Part 3 quantifies and encodes each sample, known as noise allocation, which adjusts itself in order to meet the [[bit rate]] and [[sound masking]] requirements. Part 4 formats the [[bitstream]], called an audio frame, which is made up of 4 parts, the [[Header (computing)|header]], [[Error checking|error check]], [[audio data]], and [[#Ancillary data|ancillary data]].<ref name=\"Guckert\"/>\n\nThe [[MPEG-1]] standard does not include a precise specification for an MP3 encoder, but does provide example psychoacoustic models, rate loop, and the like in the non-normative part of the original standard.<ref name=\"mpeg1\" />\nMPEG-2 doubles the number of sampling rates which are supported and MPEG-2.5 adds 3 more. When this was written, the suggested implementations were quite dated. Implementers of the standard were supposed to devise their own algorithms suitable for removing parts of the information from the audio input. As a result, many different MP3 encoders became available, each producing files of differing quality. Comparisons were widely available, so it was easy for a prospective user of an encoder to research the best choice. Some encoders that were proficient at encoding at higher bit rates (such as [[LAME]]) were not necessarily as good at lower bit rates. Over time, LAME evolved on the SourceForge website until it became the de facto CBR MP3 encoder. Later an ABR mode was added. Work progressed on true variable bit rate using a quality goal between 0 and 10. Eventually numbers (such as -V 9.600) could generate excellent quality low bit rate voice encoding at only 41&nbsp;kbit/s using the MPEG-2.5 extensions.\n\nDuring encoding, 576 time-domain samples are taken and are transformed to 576 [[Fourier Transform|frequency-domain samples]].{{clarify|date=December 2014|reason=576 samples per what? per mpeg-1 frame? This was probably written during the time MP3 encoding algorithms were being developed, criticized and possibly improved by aac proponents. U}} If there is a [[Transient (acoustics)|transient]], 192 samples are taken instead of 576. This is done to limit the temporal spread of quantization noise accompanying the transient. (See [[psychoacoustics]].) Frequency resolution is limited by the small long block window size, which decreases coding efficiency.<ref name=\"Limitations\"/> Time resolution can be too low for highly transient signals and may cause smearing of percussive sounds.<ref name=\"Limitations\" />\n\nDue to the tree structure of the filter bank, pre-echo problems are made worse, as the combined impulse response of the two filter banks does not, and cannot, provide an optimum solution in time/frequency resolution.<ref name=\"Limitations\"/> Additionally, the combining of the two filter banks' outputs creates aliasing problems that must be handled partially by the \"aliasing compensation\" stage; however, that creates excess energy to be coded in the frequency domain, thereby decreasing coding efficiency.{{citation needed| date=December 2010}}\n\nDecoding, on the other hand, is carefully defined in the standard. Most [[Codec|decoders]] are \"[[Elementary stream|bitstream]] compliant\", which means that the decompressed output that they produce from a given MP3 file will be the same, within a specified degree of [[rounding]] tolerance, as the output specified mathematically in the ISO/IEC high standard document (ISO/IEC 11172-3). Therefore, comparison of decoders is usually based on how computationally efficient they are (i.e., how much [[computer memory|memory]] or [[CPU]] time they use in the decoding process). Over time this concern has become less of an issue as CPU speeds transitioned from MHz to GHz. Encoder/decoder overall delay is not defined, which means there is no official provision for [[gapless playback]]. However, some encoders such as LAME can attach additional metadata that will allow players that can handle it to deliver seamless playback.\n\n=== Quality ===\n\nWhen performing lossy audio encoding, such as creating an MP3 data stream, there is a trade-off between the amount of data generated and the sound quality of the results. The person generating an MP3 selects a [[bit rate]], which specifies how many [[kilobits]] per second of audio is desired. The higher the bit rate, the larger the MP3 data stream will be, and, generally, the closer it will sound to the original recording. With too low a bit rate, [[compression artifact]]s (i.e., sounds that were not present in the original recording) may be audible in the reproduction. Some audio is hard to compress because of its randomness and sharp attacks. When this type of audio is compressed, artifacts such as ringing or [[pre-echo]] are usually heard. A sample of applause or a triangle instrument with a relatively low bit rate provide good examples of compression artifacts. Most subjective testings of perceptual codecs tend to avoid using these types of sound materials, however, the artifacts generated by percussive sounds are barely perceptible due to the specific temporal masking feature of the 32 sub-band filterbank of Layer II on which the format is based.\n\nBesides the bit rate of an encoded piece of audio, the quality of MP3 encoded sound also depends on the quality of the encoder algorithm as well as the complexity of the signal being encoded. As the MP3 standard allows quite a bit of freedom with encoding algorithms, different encoders do feature quite different quality, even with identical bit rates. As an example, in a public listening test featuring two early MP3 encoders set at about 128&nbsp;kbit/s,<ref name=\"Amorim\" /> one scored 3.66 on a 1\u20135 scale, while the other scored only 2.22. Quality is dependent on the choice of encoder and encoding parameters.<ref name=\"listening-test-128-2006\" />\n\nThis observation caused a revolution in audio encoding. Early on bitrate was the prime and only consideration. At the time MP3 files were of the very simplest type: they used the same bit rate for the entire file: this process is known as [[Constant bitrate|Constant Bit Rate]] (CBR) encoding. Using a constant bit rate makes encoding simpler and less CPU intensive. However, it is also possible to create files where the bit rate changes throughout the file. These are known as [[Variable bitrate|Variable Bit Rate]]. The bit reservoir and VBR encoding were actually part of the original MPEG-1 standard. The concept behind them is that, in any piece of audio, some sections are easier to compress, such as silence or music containing only a few tones, while others will be more difficult to compress. So, the overall quality of the file may be increased by using a lower bit rate for the less complex passages and a higher one for the more complex parts. With some advanced MP3 encoders, it is possible to specify a given quality, and the encoder will adjust the bit rate accordingly. Users that desire a particular \"quality setting\" that is [[Transparency (data compression)|transparent]] to their ears can use this value when encoding all of their music, and generally speaking not need to worry about performing personal listening tests on each piece of music to determine the correct bit rate.\n\nPerceived quality can be influenced by listening environment (ambient noise), listener attention, and listener training and in most cases by listener audio equipment (such as sound cards, speakers and headphones). Furthermore, sufficient quality may be achieved by a lesser quality setting for lectures and human speech applications and reduces encoding time and complexity. A test given to new students by [[Stanford University]] Music Professor Jonathan Berger showed that student preference for MP3-quality music has risen each year. Berger said the students seem to prefer the 'sizzle' sounds that MP3s bring to music.<ref name=\"Dougherty\"/>\n\nAn in-depth study of MP3 audio quality, sound artist and composer [[Ryan Maguire]]'s project \"The Ghost in the MP3\" isolates the sounds lost during MP3 compression. In 2015, he released the track \"moDernisT\" (an anagram of \"Tom's Diner\"), composed exclusively from the sounds deleted during MP3 compression of the song \"Tom's Diner\",<ref name=\"noisey\" /><ref name=\"schroeder2015\" /><ref name=\"hull2015\" /> the track originally used in the formulation of the MP3 standard. A detailed account of the techniques used to isolate the sounds deleted during MP3 compression, along with the conceptual motivation for the project, was published in the 2014 Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference.<ref name=\"Maguire2014\" />\n\n=== Bit rate ===\n{| class=\"wikitable infobox\"\n|+MPEG Audio Layer III<br />available bit rates (kbit/s)<ref name=\"neuron2-cd-1991\" /><ref name=\"MPEG-2.5\" /><ref name=\"MPEG-2.5-2\" /><ref name=\"mp3tech-iso13818-3\" /><ref name=\"lame-usage\">{{cite web |url=http://lame.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/lame/lame/USAGE |title=Guide to command line options (in CVS) |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref>\n|-\n!

CD audio is 44100 samples per second. The number of bits per sample also depends on the number of audio channels. CD is stereo and 16 bits per channel. So, multiplying 44100 by 32 gives 1411200\u2014the bitrate of uncompressed CD digital audio. MP3 was designed to encode this 1411&nbsp;kbit/s data at 320&nbsp;kbit/s or less. As less complex passages are detected by MP3 algorithms then lower bitrates may be employed. When using MPEG-2 instead of MPEG-1, MP3 supports only lower sampling rates (16000, 22050 or 24000 samples per second) and offers choices of bitrate as low as 8&nbsp;kbit/s but no higher than 160&nbsp;kbit/s. By lowering the sampling rate, MPEG-2 layer III removes all frequencies above half the new sampling rate that may have been present in the source audio.\n\nAs shown in these two tables, 14 selected [[bit rate]]s are allowed in MPEG-1 Audio Layer III standard: 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256 and 320&nbsp;kbit/s, along with the 3 highest available [[sampling frequencies]] of 32, 44.1 and 48&nbsp;[[kHz]].<ref name=\"MPEG-2.5-2\" /> MPEG-2 Audio Layer III also allows 14 somewhat different (and mostly lower) [[bit rates]] of 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160&nbsp;kbit/s with [[sampling frequencies]] of 16, 22.05 and 24&nbsp;[[kHz]] which are exactly half that of MPEG-1<ref name=\"MPEG-2.5-2\" /> MPEG-2.5 Audio Layer III frames are limited to only 8 [[bit rates]] of 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56 and 64&nbsp;kbit/s with 3 even lower [[sampling frequencies]] of 8, 11.025, and 12&nbsp;kHz.{{Citation needed|reason=Based on results from the LAME encoder, these do seem to be the actual bit rates supported by MPEG-2.5, but official documents claim MPEG-2.5 has the same possible bit rates as MPEG-2. Answer: Bitrate switching implies VBR so, it is not CBR anymore. When MPEG-2 frames are needed instead of the smaller 2.5 frames, the former are generated. Can we find a source that mentions this limitation?|date=December 2013}}\n\nMPEG-1 frames contain the most detail in 320&nbsp;kbit/s mode with silence and simple tones still requiring 32&nbsp;kbit/s. MPEG-2 frames can capture up to 12&nbsp;kHz sound reproductions needed up to 160&nbsp;kbit/s. MP3 files made with MPEG-2 don't have 20&nbsp;kHz bandwidth because of the [[Nyquist\u2013Shannon sampling theorem]]. Frequency reproduction is always strictly less than half of the sampling frequency, and imperfect filters require a larger margin for error (noise level versus sharpness of filter), so an 8&nbsp;kHz sampling rate limits the maximum frequency to 4&nbsp;kHz, while a 48&nbsp;kHz sampling rate limits an MP3 to a maximum 24&nbsp;kHz sound reproduction. MPEG-2 uses half and MPEG-2.5 only a quarter of MPEG-1 sample rates.\n\nFor the general field of human speech reproduction, a bandwidth of 5512&nbsp;Hz is sufficient to produce excellent results (for voice) using the sampling rate of 11025 and VBR encoding from 44100 (standard) WAV file. This is easily accomplished using LAME version 3.99.5 and the command line \"lame -V 9.6 lecture.WAV\"  English speakers average 41\u201342&nbsp;kbit/s with -V 9.6 setting but this may vary with amount of silence recorded or the rate of delivery (wpm). Resampling to 12000 (6K bandwidth) is selected by the LAME parameter -V 9.4 Likewise -V 9.2 selects 16000 sample rate and a resultant 8K lowpass filtering. For more info see Nyquist \u2013 Shannon.  Older versions of LAME and FFmpeg only support integer arguments for variable bit rate quality selection parameter.  The n.nnn quality parameter (-V) is documented at lame.sourceforge.net but is only supported in LAME with the new style VBR variable bit rate quality selector\u2014not average bit rate (ABR).\n\nA sample rate of 44.1&nbsp;kHz is commonly used for music reproduction, because this is also used for [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|CD audio]], the main source used for creating MP3 files. A great variety of bit rates are used on the Internet. A bit rate of 128&nbsp;kbit/s is commonly used,<ref name=\"Woon-Seng\" /> at a compression ratio of 11:1, offering adequate audio quality in a relatively small space. As Internet [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] availability and hard drive sizes have increased, higher bit rates up to 320&nbsp;kbit/s are widespread. Uncompressed audio as stored on an audio-CD has a bit rate of 1,411.2&nbsp;kbit/s, (16 bit/sample \u00d7 44100 samples/second \u00d7 2 channels / 1000 bits/kilobit), so the bitrates 128, 160 and 192&nbsp;kbit/s represent [[Data compression ratio|compression ratios]] of approximately 11:1, 9:1 and 7:1 respectively.\n\nNon-standard bit rates up to 640&nbsp;kbit/s can be achieved with the [[LAME]] encoder and the freeformat option, although few MP3 players can play those files. According to the ISO standard, decoders are only required to be able to decode streams up to 320&nbsp;kbit/s.<ref name=\"Bouvigne\" /> Early MPEG Layer III encoders used what is now called [[Constant Bit Rate]] (CBR).  The software was only able to use a uniform bitrate on all frames in an MP3 file. Later more sophisticated MP3 encoders were able to use the bit reservoir to target an [[average bit rate]] selecting the encoding rate for each frame based on the complexity of the sound in that portion of the recording.\n\nA more sophisticated MP3 encoder can produce [[variable bitrate]] audio. MPEG audio may use bitrate switching on a per-frame basis, but only layer III decoders must support it.<ref name=\"MPEG-2.5-2\" /><ref name=\"LAME_GPSYCHO\" /><ref name=\"TwoLAME\" /><ref name=\"MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 BC\" /> VBR is used when the goal is to achieve a fixed level of quality. The final file size of a VBR encoding is less predictable than with [[constant bitrate]]. [[Average bitrate]] is a type of VBR implemented as a compromise between the two: the bitrate is allowed to vary for more consistent quality, but is controlled to remain near an average value chosen by the user, for predictable file sizes. Although an MP3 decoder must support VBR to be standards compliant, historically some decoders have bugs with VBR decoding, particularly before VBR encoders became widespread. The most evolved LAME MP3 encoder supports the generation of VBR, ABR, and even the ancient CBR MP3 formats.\n\nLayer III audio can also use a \"bit reservoir\", a partially full frame's ability to hold part of the next frame's audio data, allowing temporary changes in effective bitrate, even in a constant bitrate stream.<ref name=\"MPEG-2.5-2\" /><ref name=\"LAME_GPSYCHO\" /> Internal handling of the bit reservoir increases encoding delay.{{citation needed| date=December 2010}} There is no scale factor band 21 (sfb21) for frequencies above approx 16&nbsp;[[kHz]], forcing the encoder to choose between less accurate representation in band 21 or less efficient storage in all bands below band 21, the latter resulting in wasted bitrate in VBR encoding.<ref name=\"LAME Y\" />\n\n=== Ancillary data ===\nThe ancillary data field can be used to store user defined data. The ancillary data is optional and the number of bits available is not explicitly given. The ancillary data is located after the Huffman code bits and ranges to where the next frame's main_data_begin points to. Encoder [[mp3PRO]] used ancillary data to encode extra information which could improve audio quality when decoded with its own algorithm.\n\n=== Metadata ===\n{{main|ID3|APEv2 tag}}\n\nA \"tag\" in an audio file is a section of the file that contains [[metadata]] such as the title, artist, album, track number or other information about the file's contents. The MP3 standards do not define tag formats for MP3 files, nor is there a standard [[container format (digital)|container format]] that would support metadata and obviate the need for tags. However, several ''de facto'' standards for tag formats exist. As of 2010, the most widespread are [[ID3|ID3v1 and ID3v2]], and the more recently introduced [[APEv2 tag|APEv2]]. These tags are normally embedded at the beginning or end of MP3 files, separate from the actual MP3 frame data. MP3 decoders either extract information from the tags, or just treat them as ignorable, non-MP3 junk data.\n\nPlaying and editing software often contains tag editing functionality, but there are also [[tag editor]] applications dedicated to the purpose. Aside from metadata pertaining to the audio content, tags may also be used for [[Digital rights management|DRM]].<ref name=\"Rae\" /> [[ReplayGain]] is a standard for measuring and storing the loudness of an MP3 file ([[audio normalization]]) in its metadata tag, enabling a ReplayGain-compliant player to automatically adjust the overall playback volume for each file. [[MP3Gain]] may be used to reversibly modify files based on ReplayGain measurements so that adjusted playback can be achieved on players without ReplayGain capability.\n\n== {{anchor|Licensing and patent issues}}Licensing, ownership, and legislation ==\n\nThe basic MP3 decoding and encoding technology is patent-free in the European Union, all patents having expired there by 2012 at the latest. In the United States, the technology became substantially patent-free on 16 April 2017 (see below). MP3 patents expired in the US between 2007 and 2017. In the past, many organizations have claimed ownership of [[patent]]s related to MP3 decoding or encoding. These claims led to a number of legal threats and actions from a variety of sources. As a result, uncertainty about which patents must be licensed in order to create MP3 products without committing patent infringement in countries that allow [[software patent]]s was a common feature of the early stages of adoption of the technology.\n\nThe initial near-complete MPEG-1 standard (parts 1, 2 and 3) was publicly available on 6 December 1991 as ISO CD 11172.<ref name=\"Patel\" /><ref name=\"mpegfa31.txt\" /> In most countries, patents cannot be filed after prior art has been made public, and patents expire 20 years after the initial filing date, which can be up to 12 months later for filings in other countries. As a result, patents required to implement MP3 expired in most countries by December 2012, 21 years after the publication of ISO CD 11172.\n\nAn exception is the United States, where patents in force but filed prior to 8 June 1995 expire after the later of 17 years from the issue date or 20 years from the priority date. A lengthy patent prosecution process may result in a patent issuing much later than normally expected (see [[submarine patent]]s).  The various MP3-related patents expired on dates ranging from 2007 to 2017 in the United States.<ref name=\"big-list\" />  Patents for anything disclosed in ISO CD 11172 filed a year or more after its publication are questionable.  If only the known MP3 patents filed by December 1992 are considered, then MP3 decoding has been patent-free in the US since 22 September 2015, when {{US patent|5812672}}, which had a PCT filing in October 1992, expired.<ref name=\"Cogliati\" /><ref name=\"US5812672\" /><ref name=\"Patent expiration\" />  If the longest-running patent mentioned in the aforementioned references is taken as a measure, then the MP3 technology became patent-free in the United States on 16 April 2017, when {{US patent|6009399}}, held<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.google.com/patents/US6009399 |title= Patent US6009399 \u2013 Method and apparatus for encoding digital signals ... \u2013 Google Patents}}</ref> and administered by [[Technicolor SA|Technicolor]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mp3licensing.com/patents/index.html|title=mp3licensing.com \u2013 Patents|work=mp3licensing.com}}</ref> expired.  As a result, many [[free and open-source software]] projects, such as the [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora operating system]], have decided to start shipping MP3 support by default, and users will no longer have to resort to installing unofficial packages maintained by third party software repositories for MP3 playback or encoding.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://fedoramagazine.org/full-mp3-support-coming-soon-to-fedora/ | title=Full MP3 support coming soon to Fedora| date=2017-05-05}}</ref>\n\n[[Technicolor SA|Technicolor]] (formerly called Thomson Consumer Electronics) claimed to control MP3 licensing of the Layer 3 patents in many countries, including the United States, Japan, Canada and EU countries.<ref name=\"ffii\" /> Technicolor had been actively enforcing these patents.<ref name=\"Technicolor\" /> MP3 license revenues from Technicolor's administration generated about \u20ac100 million for the Fraunhofer Society in 2005.<ref name=\"Kistenfeger\" /> In September 1998, the Fraunhofer Institute sent a letter to several developers of MP3 software stating that a license was required to \"distribute and/or sell decoders and/or encoders\". The letter claimed that unlicensed products \"infringe the patent rights of Fraunhofer and Thomson. To make, sell or distribute products using the [MPEG Layer-3] standard and thus our patents, you need to obtain a license under these patents from us.\"<ref name=\"chillingeffects\" /> This led to the situation where the [[LAME]] MP3 encoder project could not offer its users official binaries that could run on their computer. The project's position was that as source code, LAME was simply a description of how an MP3 encoder ''could'' be implemented. Unofficially, compiled binaries were available from other sources.\n\nSisvel S.p.A.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sisvel.com/licensing-programs/audio-and-video-coding-decoding/mpeg-audio/introduction | title = SISVEL's MPEG Audio licensing programme }}</ref> and its United States subsidiary Audio MPEG, Inc. previously sued Thomson for patent infringement on MP3 technology,<ref name=\"ZDNet India\" /> but those disputes were resolved in November 2005 with Sisvel granting Thomson a license to their patents. Motorola followed soon after, and signed with Sisvel to license MP3-related patents in December 2005.<ref name=\"SISVEL\" /> Except for three patents, the US patents administered by Sisvel<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sisvel.com/MPEG_Audio/US_Patents.pdf |title = US MPEG Audio patents |publisher = Sisvel}}</ref> had all expired in 2015. The three exceptions are: {{US patent|5878080}}, expired February 2017; {{US patent|5850456}}, expired February 2017; and {{US patent|5960037}}, expired 9 April 2017.\n\nIn September 2006, German officials seized MP3 players from [[SanDisk]]'s booth at the [[IFA show]] in Berlin after an Italian patents firm won an injunction on behalf of Sisvel against SanDisk in a dispute over licensing rights. The injunction was later reversed by a Berlin judge,<ref name=\"SanDisk MP3 seizure\" /> but that reversal was in turn blocked the same day by another judge from the same court, \"bringing the Patent Wild West to Germany\" in the words of one commentator.<ref name=\"Patent Wild West\" /> In February 2007, Texas MP3 Technologies sued Apple, Samsung Electronics and Sandisk in [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas|eastern Texas federal court]], claiming infringement of a portable MP3 player patent that Texas MP3 said it had been assigned. Apple, Samsung, and Sandisk all settled the claims against them in January 2009.<ref name=\"law360\" /><ref name=\"Kelly\" />\n\n[[Alcatel-Lucent]] has asserted several MP3 coding and compression patents, allegedly inherited from AT&T-Bell Labs, in litigation of its own. In November 2006, before the companies' merger, Alcatel [[Alcatel-Lucent v. Microsoft|sued]] [[Microsoft]] for allegedly infringing seven patents. On 23 February 2007, a San Diego jury awarded [[Alcatel-Lucent]] US $1.52 billion in damages for infringement of two of them.<ref name=\"MP3 payout\" /> The court subsequently revoked the award, however, finding that one patent had not been infringed and that the other was not owned by [[Alcatel-Lucent]]; it was co-owned by [[AT&T Inc.|AT&T]] and Fraunhofer, who had licensed it to [[Microsoft]], the judge ruled.<ref name=\"Microsoft wins reversal\" /> That defense judgment was upheld on appeal in 2008.<ref name=\"Alcatel-Lucent\" /> See [[Alcatel-Lucent v. Microsoft]] for more information.\n\n== Alternative technologies ==\n{{sound|filename=Test ogg mp3 48kbps.wav|title=Comparison between MP3 and Vorbis|description=The first is uncompressed WAV file. The second is a Vorbis file encoded at 48kbit/s, and third is an MP3 encoded at 48kbit/s using [[LAME]].}}\n{{Main|List of codecs}}\n\nOther lossy formats exist. Among these, [[Advanced Audio Coding]] (AAC) is the most widely used, and was designed to be the successor to MP3. There also exist other lossy formats such as [[mp3PRO]] and [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II|MP2]]. They are members of the same technological family as MP3 and depend on roughly similar [[Psychoacoustics|psychoacoustic models]] and [[MDCT]] algorithms. Whereas MP3 uses a hybrid coding approach that is part MDCT and part [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]], AAC is purely MDCT, significantly improving compression efficiency.<ref name=\"brandenburg\"/> Many of the basic [[patent]]s underlying these formats are held by [[Fraunhofer Society]], Alcatel-Lucent, [[Technicolor SA|Thomson Consumer Electronics]],<ref name=\"brandenburg\" /> [[Bell Labs|Bell]], [[Dolby Laboratories|Dolby]], [[LG Electronics]], [[NEC]], [[NTT Docomo]], [[Panasonic]], [[Sony Corporation]],<ref name=\"businesswire\">{{cite web |title=Via Licensing Announces Updated AAC Joint Patent License |url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20090105005026/en/Licensing-Announces-Updated-AAC-Joint-Patent-License |website=[[Business Wire]] |accessdate=18 June 2019 |date=5 January 2009}}</ref> [[ETRI]], [[JVC Kenwood]], [[Philips]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]].<ref name=\"aac-licensors\">{{cite web |title=AAC Licensors |url=http://www.via-corp.com/us/en/licensing/aac/licensors.html |website=Via Corp |accessdate=6 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere are also open compression formats like [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]] and [[Vorbis]] that are available free of charge and without any known patent restrictions. Some of the newer audio compression formats, such as AAC, WMA Pro and Vorbis, are free of some limitations inherent to the MP3 format that cannot be overcome by any MP3 encoder.<ref name=\"big-list\" />\n\nBesides lossy compression methods, [[Lossless compression|lossless formats]] are a significant alternative to MP3 because they provide unaltered audio content, though with an increased file size compared to lossy compression. Lossless formats include [[FLAC]] (Free Lossless Audio Codec), [[Apple Lossless]] and many others.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Comparison of audio coding formats]]\n* [[MP3 blog]]\n* [[MP3 player]]\n*

The plant was shut down shortly after the start of the May [[2018 lower Puna eruption]].

Upon returning to Hawaii, Lyman promoted geothermal electrical generation in the Puna district, distributed to Oahu and other population centers by underwater electric cables, as a way of developing the then-newly-admitted-state's economy. He found business partners to establish Hawaii Magma Power in 1961 to develop geothermal energy in the region. Several exploratory drills were made before the company determined that there was insufficient geothermal potential, although Lyman claimed to the ''Honolulu Advertiser'' that the company \"had mechanical difficulties and gave up.\"<ref name=\"Szvetecz thesis\">{{cite thesis|last1=Szvetecz |first1=Annie |type=MSc thesis |title=Geothermal energy in Hawai'i: an analysis of promotion and regulation |date=August 2001 |publisher=ProQuest LLC |url=https://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=9293&context=etd |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |format=PDF}}</ref>{{rp|12\u201313}}\n\n===Hawaii Geothermal Project===\nIn the 1970s, the Hawaii Geothermal Project was formed to conduct research funded by federal and state grants.<ref name=\"Szvetecz thesis\"/>{{rp|13\u201315}} After scientific studies of the geology and geothermal potential of the area were conducted by HGP, a site for the first well was chosen in 1975. Drilling began without environmental impact studies or a period for public input. At the time, the area around the drill site was very rural and undisturbed, but new subdivisions were planned nearby.<ref name=\"Szvetecz thesis\"/>{{rp|14\u201315}} The well was occasionally allowed to discharge gas and fluid from the borehole, which created a loud noise and release large volumes of toxins and pollutants into the air. By 1976, three subdivisions nearby had been established and were beginning to see an influx of residents, including twelve families that now lived within one mile of the well. The continued noise pollution and toxic gas discharges began to cause concern and opposition from the new, nearby residents. Nonetheless, funds were secured from the federal and state governments to begin the next step of the project: turning the geothermal energy of the well into electricity.<ref name=\"Szvetecz thesis\"/>{{rp|15\u201319}} Although HELCO was among the stakeholders in the project, they assured their stockholders that they would not invest the company's capital in the project due to the volcanic and seismic risk at the site.<ref name=\"Szvetecz thesis\"/>{{rp|19}}\n\nAn experimental 3&nbsp;MW generator was completed in 1981 and remained operational throughout the 1980s. However, families continued to build and move into the nearby subdivisions, resulting in several attempts and a failed lawsuit to stop the noise and pollution generated from the site.<ref name=\"Szvetecz thesis\"/>{{rp|20\u201329}} Since the site was within a high lava hazard zone, the generator was built on skids and housed in a building which included a crane so that the generator could be removed if lava flows threatened the facility.<!-- <ref name=\"Boyd et al 2002\"/>{{rp|13}} --> Additionally, the wellhead was housed in a concrete bunker that could be sealed to prevent lava from damaging the wellhead.<ref name=\"Boyd et al 2002\"/>{{rp|13}} Despite the opposition and the operating losses incurred by operating and maintaining the generator, there was enough support to keep the generator operating. In April 1989, county officials raised concerns about the condition of the facility following a minor blowout and considered reviewing and possibly revoking the operating permit for the site. After several additional incidents at the site in 1989, the facility was ordered to be shut down, which occurred on December 11.<ref name=\"Szvetecz thesis\"/>{{rp|30\u201332}} During its life, the HGP generator produced between 15 and 19&nbsp;million [[kilowatt hour]]s of electricity annually.<ref name=\"Boyd et al 2002\"/>{{rp|13}}\n\n===Puna Geothermal Venture===\n{{OSM Location map\n| coord = {{coord|19.47|-154.9}}\n| zoom = 12\n| float = right\n| width = 280\n| height = 200\n| caption =\n| title =\n| scalemark = 10\n|shape = image\n|mark = black pog.svg\n|mark-size = 6\n|mark-coord= {{coord|19.467971|-154.919341}}\n|label =  Leilani Estates\n|label-color = black\n|label-pos=top\n|mark-title= Leilani Estates\n|mark-coord1= {{coord|19|23|11|N|155|06|18|W}}\n|mark-size1 = 6\n| mark-size3= 8\n|       mark3 = red pog.svg\n| mark-coord3={{coord| 19.478860|-154.888612}}\n|      label3 = Puna Geothermal Venture\n|label-color3 = black\n| label-size3 = 12\n|  label-pos3=bottom\n|mark-title3= Puna Geothermal Venture\n}}\nIn 1980, HELCO requested a proposal for 25&nbsp;MW of geothermal electricity generation. To answer the request, a joint venture was formed the same year between two of Lyman's companies and two other companies to produce geothermal energy on a {{convert|500|acre|adj=on}} parcel of land leased from the Lyman family. The joint venture was renamed Puna Geothermal Venture in 1981. Over the following years, PGV drilled three wells, but all suffered from mechanical failures of their well casings and were unusable for production.<ref name=\"Szvetecz thesis\"/>{{rp|39\u201341}}\n\nIn 1986, PGV secured a contract with HELCO to supply 25&nbsp;MW of electricity by 1993. PGV promised that they would be using new technology that would result in zero emissions and operate at a drastically lower noise level.

Upon returning to Hawaii, Lyman promoted geothermal electrical generation in the Puna district, distributed to Oahu and other population centers by underwater electric cables, as a way of developing the then-newly-admitted-state's economy. He found business partners to establish Hawaii Magma Power in 1961 to develop geothermal energy in the region. Several exploratory drills were made before the company determined that there was insufficient geothermal potential, although Lyman claimed to the ''Honolulu Advertiser'' that the company \"had mechanical difficulties and gave up.\"<ref name=\"Szvetecz thesis\">{{cite thesis|last1=Szvetecz |first1=Annie |type=MSc thesis |title=Geothermal energy in Hawai'i: an analysis of promotion and regulation |date=August 2001 |publisher=ProQuest LLC |url=https://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=9293&context=etd |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |format=PDF}}</ref>{{rp|12\u201313}}\n\n===Hawaii Geothermal Project===\nIn the 1970s, the Hawaii Geothermal Project was formed to conduct research funded by federal and state grants.<ref name=\"Szvetecz thesis\"/>{{rp|13\u201315}} After scientific studies of the geology and geothermal potential of the area were conducted by HGP, a site for the first well was chosen in 1975. Drilling began without environmental impact studies or a period for public input. At the time, the area around the drill site was very rural and undisturbed, but new subdivisions were planned nearby.<ref name=\"Szvetecz thesis\"/>{{rp|14\u201315}} The well was occasionally allowed to discharge gas and fluid from the borehole, which created a loud noise and release large volumes of toxins and pollutants into the air. By 1976, three subdivisions nearby had been established and were beginning to see an influx of residents, including twelve families that now lived within one mile of the well. The continued noise pollution and toxic gas discharges began to cause concern and opposition from the new, nearby residents. Nonetheless, funds were secured from the federal and state governments to begin the next step of the project: turning the geothermal energy of the well into electricity.<ref name=\"Szvetecz thesis\"/>{{rp|15\u201319}} Although HELCO was among the stakeholders in the project, they assured their stockholders that they would not invest the company's capital in the project due to the volcanic and seismic risk at the site.<ref name=\"Szvetecz thesis\"/>{{rp|19}}\n\nAn experimental 3&nbsp;MW generator was completed in 1981 and remained operational throughout the 1980s. However, families continued to build and move into the nearby subdivisions, resulting in several attempts and a failed lawsuit to stop the noise and pollution generated from the site.<ref name=\"Szvetecz thesis\"/>{{rp|20\u201329}} Since the site was within a high lava hazard zone, the generator was built on skids and housed in a building which included a crane so that the generator could be removed if lava flows threatened the facility.<!-- <ref name=\"Boyd et al 2002\"/>{{rp|13}} --> Additionally, the wellhead was housed in a concrete bunker that could be sealed to prevent lava from damaging the wellhead.<ref name=\"Boyd et al 2002\"/>{{rp|13}} Despite the opposition and the operating losses incurred by operating and maintaining the generator, there was enough support to keep the generator operating. In April 1989, county officials raised concerns about the condition of the facility following a minor blowout and considered reviewing and possibly revoking the operating permit for the site. After several additional incidents at the site in 1989, the facility was ordered to be shut down, which occurred on December 11.<ref name=\"Szvetecz thesis\"/>{{rp|30\u201332}} During its life, the HGP generator produced between 15 and 19&nbsp;million [[kilowatt hour]]s of electricity annually.<ref name=\"Boyd et al 2002\"/>{{rp|13}}\n\n===Puna Geothermal Venture===\n{{OSM Location map\n| coord = {{coord|19.47|-154.9}}\n| zoom = 12\n| float = right\n| width = 280\n| height = 200\n| caption =\n| title =\n| scalemark = 10\n|shape = image\n|mark = black pog.svg\n|mark-size = 6\n|mark-coord= {{coord|19.467971|-154.919341}}\n|label =  Leilani Estates\n|label-color = black\n|label-pos=top\n|mark-title= Leilani Estates\n|mark-coord1= {{coord|19|23|11|N|155|06|18|W}}\n|mark-size1 = 6\n| mark-size3= 8\n|       mark3 = red pog.svg\n| mark-coord3={{coord| 19.478860|-154.888612}}\n|      label3 = Puna Geothermal Venture\n|label-color3 = black\n| label-size3 = 12\n|  label-pos3=bottom\n|mark-title3= Puna Geothermal Venture\n}}\nIn 1980, HELCO requested a proposal for 25&nbsp;MW of geothermal electricity generation.
