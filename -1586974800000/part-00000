The Victoria forwards played a good game bringing many shots against Toronto's [[Hap Holmes|Harry Holmes]] in net. Victoria's Patrick injured his wrist in the second period and could not shoot after that. Davidson and [[Bobby Genge]] started a fight at 15 minutes of the third period, clearing the benches. Foyston scored for Toronto in the second period, and Cameron scored in the third to score the winning goal. Victoria's [[Dubby Kerr]] scored with seven minutes to go, but Victoria was not able to get an equalizer.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Globe\n |date=March 20, 1914 |title=Stanley Cup Will Come To Toronto |page=12}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"120\" | Date\n! width=\"140\" | Winning Team\n! width=\"10\" | Score\n! width=\"140\" | Losing Team\n!

Northwestern had been off to a slow start on the season, especially offensively, but the team seemed to wake up for the Iowa game.  Clayton Thorson got the scoring started with a 4-yard touchdown run to put the Wildcats up 7\u20130.  Akrum Wadley would answer that with a touchdown run of his own.  The first half featured a lot of offense as Northwestern took a 17\u20137 lead, only to see it disappear quickly as Wadley scored again, and the Hawkeyes capitalized on a fumble by Justin Jackson as C.J. Beathard found Riley McCarron in the end zone for a 15-yard touchdown and Iowa went into halftime up 21\u201317.  However, the Iowa defense could not stop the Wildcat offense, and they scored on three consecutive series.  Austin Carr hauled in a 16-yard touchdown catch with a terrific catch in the corner of the end zone to tie the game at 24\u201324, and then on the next drive Justin Jackson broke free and scored from 58 yards out to give Northwestern the lead back.

Iowa had a good drive early, but were unable to get points as long distance kicker Miguel Recinos missed a 50-yard field goal badly.  However, Iowa would get on the board first as Keith Duncan hit a short field goal for a 3\u20130 halftime lead.  Iowa once again moved the ball, but have a drive stall and it settled for another short field goal by Duncan for a 6\u20130 lead.  However, Minnesota answered with its best drive of the game, and the Gophers took the lead on a 9-yard touchdown run by Shannon Brooks.  This was a game of missed opportunities as Iowa repeatedly moved the ball, but could not come up with points.  Riley McCarron lost a fumble inside the Minnesota 35 yard-line after a long reception and C.J. Beathard threw an ill-advised interception with Iowa at the Minnesota 27.  Iowa was finally able to break through as Akrum Wadley broke free for a 54-yard touchdown run, and an ensuing two-point conversion gave the Hawkeyes a 14\u20137 lead.  The Iowa defense was able to stop an attempt by Minnesota to tie the game late, and the Hawkeyes held on for a 14\u20137 win and kept possession of the Floyd of Rosedale Trophy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wadley's big run nudges Iowa past Minnesota in 14\u20137 grinder |url=http://collegefootball.ap.org/article/wadleys-big-run-nudges-iowa-past-minnesota-14-7-grinder |work=[[Associated Press]]|date=October 8, 2016 |accessdate=October 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===at Purdue===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title='''Iowa at Purdue'''\n|Visitor='''Hawkeyes'''\n|V1=21|V2=14|V3=7|V4=7\n|Host=Boilermakers\n|H1=0|H2=7|H3=7|H4=21\n|Date=October 15\n|Location=[[Ross\u2013Ade Stadium]]<br>[[West Lafayette, Indiana|West Lafayette, IN]]\n|StartTime=12:01 PM\n|TimeZone=EDT\n|ElapsedTime=3:45\n|Attendance=40,239\n|Weather=67\u00b0, Cloudy, Wind SSW 14\n|Referee=Mike Cannon\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Anish Shroff]], [[Tom Ramsey]], Kevin Weidl\n|TVStation=[[ESPN2]] \n}}\n\n*'''Source''': [http://www.hawkeyesports.com/boxscore.aspx?id=3079&path=football Box Score]\n\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=1 |Time=8:57 |Team=Iowa |Event=LeShun Daniels 1-yard run (Keith Duncan kick) |Score=Iowa 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=2:20 |Team=Iowa |Event=C.J.

Early on, the Badgers were able to move up and down the field, but were unable to capitalize.  Their first drive stalled when kicker Andrew Endicott missed a 32-yard field goal.  Wisconsin did not get on the board until Bart Houston hit tight end Troy Fumagalli for a 17-yard touchdown with 10:06 left in the second.  Iowa would answer that with a 41-yard field goal from Keith Duncan.  Wisconsin continued to miss its opportunities as Corey Clement fumbled inside the Iowa 1 right before the half, and Iowa turned that into a field goal and despite getting significantly outgained, Iowa only went into halftime trailing 7\u20136.  Wisconsin continued to move the ball in the second half, as Corey Clement was able to score this time from the 1 and the Badgers extended their lead to 14\u20136.  With about 5 minutes left in the 4th, Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz decided to kick a field goal on 4th & 5 on the Wisconsin 20, instead of going for it and Keith Duncan missed a 38-yard field goal.  From there, Wisconsin was able to make a field goal of their own to essentially put the game on ice.  Iowa was able to get a field goal late in the game but Wisconsin recovered the ensuing onside kick and was able to hang on for the 17\u20139 win.   For Iowa, it was their third consecutive loss at Kinnick Stadium and dropped them to 5\u20133, 3\u20132 heading into their bye week.

Throughout much of the game, Iowa was completely dominated by Penn State.  On the very first drive, Penn State marched right down the field for a touchdown drive that ended with Trace McSorley finding Saaed Blacknall for a score.  Saquon Barkley continued to run all over the Hawkeyes as he broke free for a 57-yard touchdown run to extend the lead to 14\u20130.  Soon after, McSorley scored from 1 yard out and the Nittany Lions were rolling, up 21\u20130.  Iowa got a much needed touchdown late in the half when Beathard found Akrum Wadley for a 12-yard touchdown to get Iowa on the board.  However, Penn State answered right back with a field goal to head into halftime up 24\u20137.  The second half was much of the same as Saquon Barkley caught a long pass from McSorley for another touchdown.  Backup quarterback Tommy Stevens even got in on the fun and added a rushing touchdown of his own as Penn State crushed the Hawkeyes, winning 41\u201314.  Barkley and McSorley combined for nearly 450 yards and Penn State racked up 599 yards of offense on the Hawkeyes.  It was the second consecutive loss for Iowa, who dropped to 5\u20134, 3\u20133 in the Big Ten and a matchup with the undefeated Michigan Wolverines upcoming.  Penn State continued to play great football, getting its fifth straight win and the second straight blowout for the Lions after they defeated #2 and previously undefeated Ohio State two weeks earlier.  \n<ref>{{cite web |title=No. 20 Penn State hammers Iowa 41\u201314 |url=http://collegefootball.ap.org/article/no-20-penn-state-hammers-iowa-41-14 |work=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 6, 2016 |accessdate=November 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Michigan===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title='''Michigan at Iowa'''\n|Visitor=No. 2 Wolverines\n|V1=3|V2=7|V3=0|V4=3\n|Host='''Hawkeyes'''\n|H1=0|H2=8|H3=3|H4=3\n|Date=November 12\n|Location=[[Kinnick Stadium]]<br>[[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City, IA]]\n|StartTime=7:12 PM\n|TimeZone=CST\n|ElapsedTime=3:19\n|Attendance=70,585\n|Weather=41\u00b0, Mostly Cloudy, Wind S 4\n|Referee=John O'Neill\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Chris Fowler]], [[Kirk Herbstreit]], [[Sam Ponder]]\n|TVStation=[[Saturday Night Football|ABC]]\n}}\n\n*'''Source''': [http://www.hawkeyesports.com/boxscore.aspx?id=3082&path=football Box Score]\n\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=1 |Time=4:00|Team=Michigan |Event=Kenny Allen 26-yard field goal |Score=Michigan 3\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=8:56 |Team=Michigan |Event=Ty Isaac 7-yard run (Allen kick) |Score=Michigan 10\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=6:31 |Team=Iowa |Event=Team safety |Score=Michigan 10\u20132}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=1:27 |Team=Iowa |Event=Akrum Wadley 3-yard pass from C.J.

Iowa fell behind 10\u20130 in the second quarter, thanks to a Ty Isaac 7-yard touchdown run. Defensive tackle Jaleel Johnson gave Iowa some momentum when he tackled De'Veon Smith in the end zone for a safety.  Later, C.J. Beathard converted a 4th and goal by completing a screen pass to Akrum Wadley for a 3-yard touchdown.  The two-point conversion was unsuccessful and Iowa trailed 10\u20138 at halftime.  However, Iowa continued to control the game and Wadley was a force for Iowa, and Iowa took an 11\u201310 lead into the 4th quarter.  Michigan kicker Kenny Allen put them back in front with a 50-yard field goal midway through the 4th quarter, but Iowa would not go away.  With Iowa driving for the game-winning score, quarterback C.J. Beathard was intercepted by Michigan cornerback [[Channing Stribling]] with 1:54 left.  However, Iowa forced a Michigan punt, and the Wolverines committed a costly penalty on a punt return by Desmond King to set up Iowa with terrific field position.  From there, Iowa got two first downs and freshman kicker [[Keith Duncan]] drilled a 33-yard field goal as time expired to deliver Iowa a shocking 14\u201313 upset of Michigan.\n\nAkrum Wadley was the offensive standout for the Hawkeyes with 115 yards rushing, and another 52 yards receiving that included the touchdown late in the first half. The Hawkeye defense did their part as well, allowing only 201 total yards to a Wolverine offense that was averaging over 400 per game going into the contest.<ref>{{cite web |title=Iowa upsets No. 2 Michigan 14\u201313 on last-second field goal |url=http://collegefootball.ap.org/article/iowa-upsets-no-2-michigan-14-13-last-second-field-goal |work=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 12, 2016 |accessdate=November 12, 2016}}</ref> Senior DT Jaleel Johnson was named Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week, Duncan was named Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week, and Manny Rugamba was named Big Ten co-Freshman of the Week.<ref name=\"b1g-pow-week11\">{{cite web |title=Big Ten Football Players of the Week |url=http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/111416aaa.html |work=[[Big Ten Conference]] |date=November 14, 2016 |accessdate=November 14, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114233036/http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/111416aaa.html |archive-date=November 14, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWith Clemson and Washington both losing, this marked only the second time #2, #3, and #4 fell during the same day in the regular-season.

With Iowa heading in for a score, Akrum Wadley fumbled inside the Illini 5 to keep the game scoreless in the second quarter.  However, Iowa would respond with a Riley McCarron 55-yard punt return touchdown for the only score of the first half and Iowa led 7\u20130 at the break.  In the second half, Iowa dominated Illinois on the ground, as LeShun Daniels capped off a 12-play, 6 minute drive with a 1-yard touchdown run.  Daniels would add a 50-yard touchdown run midway through the 4th and Iowa cruised to an easy 28\u20130 victory.  The Iowa defense was phenomenal all game, allowing just 198 yards of total offense for the Illini, forcing two turnovers, and getting the team's first shutout since a 45\u20130 win over Ball State in 2010.  Daniels rushed for a season-high 159 yards and two touchdowns.

The Hawkeyes got explosive plays early as Akrum Wadley got the scoring started with a 75-yard touchdown run to put Iowa up 6\u20130. On the next offensive play for Iowa, C.J. Beathard found Riley McCarron for a 77-yard catch and run and Iowa was flying high, up 13\u20130 early.  After a Drew Brown field goal, Iowa again got a big play as LeShun Daniels had a 56-yard run which set up a 4-yard touchdown by Daniels and Iowa led 20\u20133.  In the second half, it was more of the same as Beathard found George Kittle for a 1-yard touchdown on the first drive of the second half and Iowa went up 26\u20133.  Nebraska momentarily got back into the game when Stanley Morgan Jr. caught a 13-yard touchdown pass on 4th down from Tommy Armstrong Jr. to cut the Iowa lead to 26\u201310.  But the running game for Iowa was too much for the Cornhuskers as the combination of Daniels and Wadley continued to wear down Nebraska.  Beathard found Kittle for another score, and late in the game, Daniels added a 1-yard touchdown to put the finishing touches on a 40\u201310 dismantling of the rival Cornhuskers.  The defense held Armstrong Jr. to 125 yards passing and gave up 217 total yards.  Iowa ran for 264 yards and Beathard threw for 3 touchdowns as Iowa won its third consecutive game to end the season, including knocking off two straight ranked opponents at Kinnick Stadium.

The Hawkeyes scored two touchdowns in the first, with the first one going to tight end George Kittle and the other one coming on a long pass to running back Akrum Wadley.  The Hawkeyes continued to pour it on as Beathard threw his third TD pass of the first half to Matt VandeBerg, and would run in another score to give Iowa a commanding 28\u20133 lead at halftime.  Iowa would score twice more in the third quarter and the defense hounded the Iowa State offense all game long, and the result was a dismantling of the Hawkeyes' in-state rival from Ames.

The Bison struck first as C.J. Beathard threw a pick-6 to M.J. Stumpf late in the first quarter, however Iowa tied the game at 7\u20137 when Beathard found Riley McCarron for a 30-yard touchdown on a 4th down play.  On the next drive, Beathard would connect with Matt VandeBerg for a 14-yard score and Iowa went into halftime leading 14\u20137.  The teams traded touchdowns in the third, with King Frazier tying up the game for the Bison, and Matt VandeBerg putting Iowa ahead 21\u201314 with his 2nd touchdown reception of the game in traffic.  But the Bison grinded out a long drive that took over 8 minutes of clock in the 4th quarter and ended with a touchdown.  However, NDSU went for two and was unsuccessful, and the Hawkeyes clung to a 21\u201320 lead.  After forcing a three-and-out, Easton Stick led North Dakota State right down the field and kicker Cam Pedersen nailed a 37-yard field goal as time expired to give the Bison a 23\u201321 victory.  For North Dakota State, it was their sixth consecutive victory over an FBS opponent. It was the first time Iowa lost a game to an FCS opponent, and was the first regular season loss in Iowa quarterback C.J.

Northwestern had been off to a slow start on the season, especially offensively, but the team seemed to wake up for the Iowa game.  Clayton Thorson got the scoring started with a 4-yard touchdown run to put the Wildcats up 7\u20130.  Akrum Wadley would answer that with a touchdown run of his own.  The first half featured a lot of offense as Northwestern took a 17\u20137 lead, only to see it disappear quickly as Wadley scored again, and the Hawkeyes capitalized on a fumble by Justin Jackson as C.J. Beathard found Riley McCarron in the end zone for a 15-yard touchdown and Iowa went into halftime up 21\u201317.  However, the Iowa defense could not stop the Wildcat offense, and they scored on three consecutive series.  Austin Carr hauled in a 16-yard touchdown catch with a terrific catch in the corner of the end zone to tie the game at 24\u201324, and then on the next drive Justin Jackson broke free and scored from 58 yards out to give Northwestern the lead back.  Carr then hauled in his third touchdown of the game and Northwestern went up 38\u201324.  LeShun Daniels cut the lead to 38\u201331 with a 1-yard touchdown run, but a last ditch effort by the Hawkeyes to come back was thwarted when Beathard was intercepted with 58 seconds left.  The win snapped a three-game losing streak for Northwestern at Kinnick Stadium, while the loss dropped Iowa to 3\u20132, 1\u20131 in Big Ten play.<ref>{{cite web |title=Carr's 3 TD catches help Northwestern down Iowa 38\u201331 |url=http://collegefootball.ap.org/article/carrs-3-td-catches-help-northwestern-down-iowa-38-31 |work=[[Associated Press]]|date=October 1, 2016 |accessdate=October 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===at Minnesota===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title='''Iowa at Minnesota'''<br><small>[[Iowa\u2013Minnesota football rivalry|Floyd of Rosedale]]</small>\n|Visitor='''Hawkeyes'''\n|V1=0|V2=3|V3=3|V4=8\n|Host=Golden Gophers\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=7|H4=0\n|Date=October 8\n|Location=[[TCF Bank Stadium]]<br>[[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis, MN]]\n|StartTime= 11:01 AM\n|TimeZone=CDT\n|ElapsedTime=3:14\n|Attendance=49,145\n|Weather=46\u00b0, Sunsplashed and cool, Wind N 6\n|Referee=Dan Capron\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Beth Mowins]], [[Anthony Becht]], [[Rocky Boiman]]\n|TVStation=[[ESPN2]]\n}}\n\n*'''Source''': [http://www.hawkeyesports.com/boxscore.aspx?id=3078&path=football Box Score]\n\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=2 |Time=13:32 |Team=Iowa |Event=Keith Duncan 22-yard field goal |Score=Iowa 3\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=10:10 |Team=Iowa |Event=Keith Duncan 28-yard field goal |Score=Iowa 6\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=6:17 |Team=Minnesota |Event=Shannon Brooks 9-yard run (Emmit Carpenter kick)|Score=Minnesota 7\u20136}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=5:28 |Team=Iowa |Event=Akrum Wadley 54-yard run (LeShun Daniels run)|Score=Iowa 14\u20137|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{{see also|2016 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|Iowa%E2%80%93Minnesota football rivalry}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n{{CollegeSecondaryHeader|team=Iowa Hawkeyes|Overall record|Last meeting|Result}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 45\u201362\u20132\n| 2015\n| '''W''' 40\u201335\n|}\n\nIowa went back to the road as they looked to defeat their rival Minnesota Golden Gophers for the second consecutive season.

However, Iowa would get on the board first as Keith Duncan hit a short field goal for a 3\u20130 halftime lead.  Iowa once again moved the ball, but have a drive stall and it settled for another short field goal by Duncan for a 6\u20130 lead.  However, Minnesota answered with its best drive of the game, and the Gophers took the lead on a 9-yard touchdown run by Shannon Brooks.  This was a game of missed opportunities as Iowa repeatedly moved the ball, but could not come up with points.  Riley McCarron lost a fumble inside the Minnesota 35 yard-line after a long reception and C.J. Beathard threw an ill-advised interception with Iowa at the Minnesota 27.  Iowa was finally able to break through as Akrum Wadley broke free for a 54-yard touchdown run, and an ensuing two-point conversion gave the Hawkeyes a 14\u20137 lead.  The Iowa defense was able to stop an attempt by Minnesota to tie the game late, and the Hawkeyes held on for a 14\u20137 win and kept possession of the Floyd of Rosedale Trophy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wadley's big run nudges Iowa past Minnesota in 14\u20137 grinder |url=http://collegefootball.ap.org/article/wadleys-big-run-nudges-iowa-past-minnesota-14-7-grinder |work=[[Associated Press]]|date=October 8, 2016 |accessdate=October 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===at Purdue===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title='''Iowa at Purdue'''\n|Visitor='''Hawkeyes'''\n|V1=21|V2=14|V3=7|V4=7\n|Host=Boilermakers\n|H1=0|H2=7|H3=7|H4=21\n|Date=October 15\n|Location=[[Ross\u2013Ade Stadium]]<br>[[West Lafayette, Indiana|West Lafayette, IN]]\n|StartTime=12:01 PM\n|TimeZone=EDT\n|ElapsedTime=3:45\n|Attendance=40,239\n|Weather=67\u00b0, Cloudy, Wind SSW 14\n|Referee=Mike Cannon\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Anish Shroff]], [[Tom Ramsey]], Kevin Weidl\n|TVStation=[[ESPN2]] \n}}\n\n*'''Source''': [http://www.hawkeyesports.com/boxscore.aspx?id=3079&path=football Box Score]\n\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=1 |Time=8:57 |Team=Iowa |Event=LeShun Daniels 1-yard run (Keith Duncan kick) |Score=Iowa 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=2:20 |Team=Iowa |Event=C.J.

Wisconsin continued to miss its opportunities as Corey Clement fumbled inside the Iowa 1 right before the half, and Iowa turned that into a field goal and despite getting significantly outgained, Iowa only went into halftime trailing 7\u20136.  Wisconsin continued to move the ball in the second half, as Corey Clement was able to score this time from the 1 and the Badgers extended their lead to 14\u20136.  With about 5 minutes left in the 4th, Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz decided to kick a field goal on 4th & 5 on the Wisconsin 20, instead of going for it and Keith Duncan missed a 38-yard field goal.  From there, Wisconsin was able to make a field goal of their own to essentially put the game on ice.  Iowa was able to get a field goal late in the game but Wisconsin recovered the ensuing onside kick and was able to hang on for the 17\u20139 win.   For Iowa, it was their third consecutive loss at Kinnick Stadium and dropped them to 5\u20133, 3\u20132 heading into their bye week.  The win snapped a two-game losing streak for Wisconsin and was also the team's fourth consecutive win in Kinnick.<ref>{{cite web |title=Clement Carries No. 10 Wisconsin to 17\u20139 Win Over Iowa |url=http://www.collegefootball.ap.org/article/clement-carries-no-10-wisconsin-17-9-win-over-iowa |work=[[Associated Press]]|date=October 22, 2016 |accessdate=November 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===at Penn State===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title='''Iowa at Penn State'''\n|Visitor=Hawkeyes\n|V1=0|V2=7|V3=0|V4=7\n|Host='''No. 20 Nittany Lions'''\n|H1=7|H2=17|H3=3|H4=14\n|Date=November 5\n|Location=[[Beaver Stadium]]<br>[[University Park, Pennsylvania|University Park, PA]]\n|StartTime=7:30 PM\n|TimeZone=EDT\n|ElapsedTime=3:08\n|Attendance=106,194\n|Weather=56\u00b0, Clear, Wind WNW 10\n|Referee=Rod Snodgrass\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Kevin Kugler]], [[Matt Millen]], [[Lisa Byington]]\n|TVStation=[[Big Ten Network|BTN]] \n}}\n\n*'''Source''': [http://www.hawkeyesports.com/boxscore.aspx?id=3081&path=football Box Score]\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=1 |Time=12:53|Team=Penn State|Event=Saeed Blacknall 19-yard TD pass from [[Trace McSorley]] (Tyler Davis kick) |Score=Penn State 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=10:28|Team=Penn State|Event=[[Saquon Barkley]] 57-yard run (Tyler Davis kick) |Score=Penn State 14\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=7:58|Team=Penn State|Event=Trace McSorley 1-yard run (Tyler Davis kick) |Score=Penn State 21\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=4:18|Team=Iowa|Event=Akrum Wadley 12-yard pass from C.J.

Throughout much of the game, Iowa was completely dominated by Penn State.  On the very first drive, Penn State marched right down the field for a touchdown drive that ended with Trace McSorley finding Saaed Blacknall for a score.  Saquon Barkley continued to run all over the Hawkeyes as he broke free for a 57-yard touchdown run to extend the lead to 14\u20130.  Soon after, McSorley scored from 1 yard out and the Nittany Lions were rolling, up 21\u20130.  Iowa got a much needed touchdown late in the half when Beathard found Akrum Wadley for a 12-yard touchdown to get Iowa on the board.  However, Penn State answered right back with a field goal to head into halftime up 24\u20137.  The second half was much of the same as Saquon Barkley caught a long pass from McSorley for another touchdown.  Backup quarterback Tommy Stevens even got in on the fun and added a rushing touchdown of his own as Penn State crushed the Hawkeyes, winning 41\u201314.  Barkley and McSorley combined for nearly 450 yards and Penn State racked up 599 yards of offense on the Hawkeyes.  It was the second consecutive loss for Iowa, who dropped to 5\u20134, 3\u20133 in the Big Ten and a matchup with the undefeated Michigan Wolverines upcoming.  Penn State continued to play great football, getting its fifth straight win and the second straight blowout for the Lions after they defeated #2 and previously undefeated Ohio State two weeks earlier.  \n<ref>{{cite web |title=No. 20 Penn State hammers Iowa 41\u201314 |url=http://collegefootball.ap.org/article/no-20-penn-state-hammers-iowa-41-14 |work=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 6, 2016 |accessdate=November 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Michigan===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title='''Michigan at Iowa'''\n|Visitor=No. 2 Wolverines\n|V1=3|V2=7|V3=0|V4=3\n|Host='''Hawkeyes'''\n|H1=0|H2=8|H3=3|H4=3\n|Date=November 12\n|Location=[[Kinnick Stadium]]<br>[[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City, IA]]\n|StartTime=7:12 PM\n|TimeZone=CST\n|ElapsedTime=3:19\n|Attendance=70,585\n|Weather=41\u00b0, Mostly Cloudy, Wind S 4\n|Referee=John O'Neill\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Chris Fowler]], [[Kirk Herbstreit]], [[Sam Ponder]]\n|TVStation=[[Saturday Night Football|ABC]]\n}}\n\n*'''Source''': [http://www.hawkeyesports.com/boxscore.aspx?id=3082&path=football Box Score]\n\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=1 |Time=4:00|Team=Michigan |Event=Kenny Allen 26-yard field goal |Score=Michigan 3\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=8:56 |Team=Michigan |Event=Ty Isaac 7-yard run (Allen kick) |Score=Michigan 10\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=6:31 |Team=Iowa |Event=Team safety |Score=Michigan 10\u20132}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=1:27 |Team=Iowa |Event=Akrum Wadley 3-yard pass from C.J.

Iowa fell behind 10\u20130 in the second quarter, thanks to a Ty Isaac 7-yard touchdown run. Defensive tackle Jaleel Johnson gave Iowa some momentum when he tackled De'Veon Smith in the end zone for a safety.  Later, C.J. Beathard converted a 4th and goal by completing a screen pass to Akrum Wadley for a 3-yard touchdown.  The two-point conversion was unsuccessful and Iowa trailed 10\u20138 at halftime.  However, Iowa continued to control the game and Wadley was a force for Iowa, and Iowa took an 11\u201310 lead into the 4th quarter.  Michigan kicker Kenny Allen put them back in front with a 50-yard field goal midway through the 4th quarter, but Iowa would not go away.  With Iowa driving for the game-winning score, quarterback C.J. Beathard was intercepted by Michigan cornerback [[Channing Stribling]] with 1:54 left.  However, Iowa forced a Michigan punt, and the Wolverines committed a costly penalty on a punt return by Desmond King to set up Iowa with terrific field position.  From there, Iowa got two first downs and freshman kicker [[Keith Duncan]] drilled a 33-yard field goal as time expired to deliver Iowa a shocking 14\u201313 upset of Michigan.\n\nAkrum Wadley was the offensive standout for the Hawkeyes with 115 yards rushing, and another 52 yards receiving that included the touchdown late in the first half. The Hawkeye defense did their part as well, allowing only 201 total yards to a Wolverine offense that was averaging over 400 per game going into the contest.<ref>{{cite web |title=Iowa upsets No. 2 Michigan 14\u201313 on last-second field goal |url=http://collegefootball.ap.org/article/iowa-upsets-no-2-michigan-14-13-last-second-field-goal |work=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 12, 2016 |accessdate=November 12, 2016}}</ref> Senior DT Jaleel Johnson was named Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week, Duncan was named Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week, and Manny Rugamba was named Big Ten co-Freshman of the Week.<ref name=\"b1g-pow-week11\">{{cite web |title=Big Ten Football Players of the Week |url=http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/111416aaa.html |work=[[Big Ten Conference]] |date=November 14, 2016 |accessdate=November 14, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114233036/http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/111416aaa.html |archive-date=November 14, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWith Clemson and Washington both losing, this marked only the second time #2, #3, and #4 fell during the same day in the regular-season.

With Iowa heading in for a score, Akrum Wadley fumbled inside the Illini 5 to keep the game scoreless in the second quarter.  However, Iowa would respond with a Riley McCarron 55-yard punt return touchdown for the only score of the first half and Iowa led 7\u20130 at the break.  In the second half, Iowa dominated Illinois on the ground, as LeShun Daniels capped off a 12-play, 6 minute drive with a 1-yard touchdown run.  Daniels would add a 50-yard touchdown run midway through the 4th and Iowa cruised to an easy 28\u20130 victory.  The Iowa defense was phenomenal all game, allowing just 198 yards of total offense for the Illini, forcing two turnovers, and getting the team's first shutout since a 45\u20130 win over Ball State in 2010.  Daniels rushed for a season-high 159 yards and two touchdowns.

The Hawkeyes got explosive plays early as Akrum Wadley got the scoring started with a 75-yard touchdown run to put Iowa up 6\u20130. On the next offensive play for Iowa, C.J. Beathard found Riley McCarron for a 77-yard catch and run and Iowa was flying high, up 13\u20130 early.  After a Drew Brown field goal, Iowa again got a big play as LeShun Daniels had a 56-yard run which set up a 4-yard touchdown by Daniels and Iowa led 20\u20133.  In the second half, it was more of the same as Beathard found George Kittle for a 1-yard touchdown on the first drive of the second half and Iowa went up 26\u20133.  Nebraska momentarily got back into the game when Stanley Morgan Jr. caught a 13-yard touchdown pass on 4th down from Tommy Armstrong Jr. to cut the Iowa lead to 26\u201310.  But the running game for Iowa was too much for the Cornhuskers as the combination of Daniels and Wadley continued to wear down Nebraska.  Beathard found Kittle for another score, and late in the game, Daniels added a 1-yard touchdown to put the finishing touches on a 40\u201310 dismantling of the rival Cornhuskers.  The defense held Armstrong Jr. to 125 yards passing and gave up 217 total yards.  Iowa ran for 264 yards and Beathard threw for 3 touchdowns as Iowa won its third consecutive game to end the season, including knocking off two straight ranked opponents at Kinnick Stadium.
