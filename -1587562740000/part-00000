[[Tayyibi Isma'ilism|Tayyibi Isma'ili]] Shi'ites, including the [[Dawoodi Bohra]]h, believe that [[At-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim]] is the current occulted Imam and Mahdi.\n\n==Historical development==\nThe term ''Mahdi'' does not occur in the [[Quran]]. It is derived from the Arabic root ''h-d-y'' ({{lang-ar|\u0647\u062f\u064a}}), commonly used to mean \"divine guidance\". The term ''al-Mahdi'' was employed from the beginning of Islam, but only as an honorific epithet and without any messianic significance.<ref name=\"EI2\">{{Cite encyclopedia | edition = 2nd| publisher = Brill Academic Publishers| volume = 5| pages = 1230\u20138| last = Madelung| first = Wilferd | title = al-Mahd\u012b| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]| date = 1986 | isbn = 90-04-09419-9}}</ref> As an honorific it has been used in some instances to describe Muhammad (by [[Hassan ibn Thabit]]), as well as [[Abraham]], [[al-Hussain]], and various [[Umayyad]] rulers (''hud\u0101t mahdiyy\u016bn'').<ref name=\"EI2\" /> During the [[Second Fitna|second civil war]] (680\u2013692), after the death of [[Mu\u02beawiya]], the term acquired a new meaning of a ruler who would restore Islam to its perfect form and restore justice after oppression.<ref name=\"EI2\" /> In [[Kufa]] during the rebellion in 680s, [[Al-Mukhtar]] proclaimed [[Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah|Muhammad al-Hanafiyyah]] as the Mahdi in this heightened sense. Among the Umayyads, caliph [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik]] encouraged the belief that he was the Mahdi, and other Umayyad rulers, like [[Umar II]], have been addressed as such in the [[panegyrics]] of [[Jarir (poet)|Jarir]] and [[al-Farazdaq]].<ref name=\"EI2\" />\n\nEarly discussions about the identity of al-Mahdi by religious scholars can be traced back to the time after the [[Second Fitna]]. These discussions developed in different directions and were influenced by traditions ([[hadith]]s) attributed to Muhammad. In Umayyad times, scholars and traditionists not only differed on which caliph or rebel leader should be designated as Mahdi, but also on whether the Mahdi is a messianic figure and if signs and predictions of his time have been satisfied.<ref name=\"EI2\" /> By the time of the [[Abbasid Revolution]] in the year 750, Mahdi was already a known concept. Evidence shows that the first Abbasid caliph [[As-Saffah]] assumed the title of \"the Mahdi\" for himself.<ref name=\"EI2\" />\n\nIn [[Shia Islam]], it seems likely that the attribution of messianic qualities to the Mahdi originated from two of the groups supporting al-Hanafiyyah: southern Arabian settlers and local recent converts in [[Iraq]]. They became known as [[Kaysanites Shia|Kaysanites]], and introduced what later became two key aspects of the Shia's concept of the Mahdi. The first was the notion of return of the dead, particularly of the Imams. The second was that after al-Hanafiyyah's death they believed he was, in fact, in hiding in the Razwa mountains near [[Medina]]. This later developed into the doctrine known as the [[Occultation (Islam)|occultation]].<ref name=\"Arjomand 2007 134\u2013136\"/> The Mahdi appeared in early [[Shia|Shi'ite]] narratives, spread widely among Shi'ite groups and became dissociated from its historical figure, Muhammad al-Hanafiyyah. During the 10th century, based on these earlier beliefs, the doctrine of Mahdism was extensively expanded by [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni|Al-Kulayni]], [[Ali ibn Ibrahim al-Qummi|Ibrahim al-Qummi]] and [[Ibn Babawayh]].<ref name=etan /> In particular, in the early 10th century, the doctrine of the occultation, which declares that the Twelfth Imam did not die but was concealed by God from the eyes of men, was expounded. The Mahdi became synonymous with the \"Hidden Imam\" who was thought to be in occultation awaiting the time that God has ordered for his return. This return is envisaged as occurring shortly before the final Day of judgment.<ref name=momen /> In fact, the concept of the \"hidden Imam\" was attributed to several Imams in turn.<ref name=corbin />\n\nSome historians suggest that the term itself was probably introduced into Islam by southern Arabian tribes who had settled in [[Syria (region)|Syria]] in the mid-7th century. They believed that the Mahdi would lead them back to their homeland and reestablish the [[Himyarite]] kingdom. They also believed that he would eventually conquer [[Constantinople]].<ref name=\"Arjomand 2007 134\u2013136\"/> It has also been suggested that the concept of the Mahdi may have been derived from messianic Judeo-Christian beliefs.<ref name=etan/><ref name=arjomand2 /> Accordingly, traditions were introduced to support certain political interests, especially Anti-[[Abbassid]] sentiments.<ref name=arjomand2 /><ref name=reza /> These traditions about the Mahdi appeared only at later times in hadith collections such as ''[[Jami' at-Tirmidhi]]'' and ''[[Sunan Abi Dawud]]'', but are absent from the early works of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Muslim]].<ref name=Glasse/>\n\n==Sunni Islam==\nSince Sunnism has no established doctrine of Mahdi, compositions of Mahdi varies among Sunni scholars.<ref>Hong Beom Rhee ''Asian Millenarianism: An Interdisciplinary Study of the Taiping and Tonghak Rebellions in a Global Context'' Cambria Press 2006 {{ISBN|978-1-934-04342-4}} page 230</ref> While some scholars like [[Ibn Khaldun]] even disputed the authenticity of references concerning the Mahdi in [[hadith]] literature, others like [[Ibn Kathir]] elaborated a whole apocalyptic scenario which included prophecies about Mahdi, Jesus and Dajjal during the endtime.<ref>Oddbj\u00f8rn Leirvik ''Images of Jesus Christ in Islam: 2nd Edition'' A&C Black {{ISBN|978-1-441-18160-2}} page 41</ref> Some Sunni beliefs deny the Mahdi as a separate figure, accordingly Jesus will fulfill this role and judge over mankind, thus ''Mahdi'' is considered as a title for Jesus, when he returns.<ref>John L.

Pictured are the [[Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan|Sultan Hasan]] and [[Al-Rifa'i Mosque]]s.]]\n\nThe [[Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b]] developed their own theory of the Mahdi with select Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b [[Imams]] representing the concept of Mahdi or Al-Qa'im (person) at various times. For the [[Sevener]] Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b, the Im\u0101mate ended with Isma'il ibn Ja'far, whose son [[Muhammad ibn Ismail]] was the expected Mahdi that Ja'far al-Sadiq had preached about. However, at this point the Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b Im\u0101ms according to the [[Nizari]] and [[Musta'li]] found areas where they would be able to be safe from the recently founded [[Abbasid Caliphate]], which had defeated and seized control from the Umayyads in 750 CE. During the period of Ja'far, the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] replaced the Umayyads and began to aggressively oppose belief in an Imamate. Due to strong suppression by the Abbasids, the seventh Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b Imam, [[Muhammad ibn Ismail]], went into a period of [[The Occultation#Ismaili|occultation]]. During this period his representative, the ''D\u0101\u02bf\u012b'', maintained the community. The names of the eighth, ninth, and tenth Imams are considered by some traditions to be \"hidden\", known only by their nicknames due to threats from the Abbasids.\n\nThe 11th Imam, [[Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah]], founded the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] in 909 CE in ''[[Ifriqiya]]'' (which includes present [[Tunisia]] in [[North Africa]]), ending the first occultation. In Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b eyes this act again united the Imamate and the Caliphate in one person. The Fatimids then extended up to the central [[Maghreb]] (now including [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]] and [[Libya]]). They entered and conquered Egypt in 969 CE during the reign of the fourteenth Imam, [[al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah]], and made [[Cairo]] their capital. After the eighteenth Imam, [[al-Mustansir Billah]], the Nizari sect believed that his son [[Nizar (Fatimid Imam)|Nizar]] was his successor, while another Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b branch known as the Mustaali (from whom the Dawoodi Bohra would eventually form), supported his other son, [[al-Musta'li]]. The Fatimid dynasty continued with al-Musta'li as both Imam and Caliph, and that joint position held until the 20th Imam, [[Al-Amir bi-Ahkami'l-Lah]] (1132 CE). At the death of 20th Imam Amir, one branch of the Mustaali faith claimed that he had transferred the Imamate to his son At-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim, who was then two years old. Tayyeb's claim to the imamate was endorsed by the ''Hurrah al-Malika'' (\"the Noble Queen\") [[Arwa al-Sulayhi]], the Queen of [[Yemen]], who created the office of the [[Dai al-Mutlaq]] to administer the community in the Imam's absence. [[Zoeb bin Moosa]] (d.546 [[Hijri year|AH]]/1151&nbsp;CE) was the first Dai-ul-Mutlaq, and lived and died in Haus, Yemen.<ref name=\"DaftaryIsmailis1990p104\">{{cite book |first=Farhad |last=Daftary |title=The Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs: Their history and doctrines |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge UniversityPress |year=1990 |isbn=0-521-42974-9 |page=104}}</ref> Tayyibis (which include the [[Dawoodi Bohra]]) believe the second and current period of occultation (''satr'') began after Imam Tayyeb went into seclusion and Imam from his progeny is very much present as Mahdi on earth every time.\n\nThe [[Nizari]] Ismailis maintain that the Shi\u2018a [[Ismaili]] Imams and Ismaili Muslim thinkers have explained that al-Mahdi is not a single person but actually a function undertaken by some of the hereditary Shi\u2018a Ismaili Imams from the progeny of Prophet Muhammad and Imam \u2018Ali ibn Abi Talib. Throughout history, only a certain number of Imams have had the practical means to undertake such a grand mission of establishing justice and equity and removing oppression and injustice from the world because most of the Ismaili Imams have been heavily persecuted. For example, the founder of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]], Imam \u2018Abdullah al-Mahdi, and the Fatimid-Imam Caliphs each performed the function or mission of the Mahdi. The Mahdi is therefore a mission carried out by several Shi\u2018a Ismaili Imams and not a specific individual. Today, the 49th hereditary Ismaili Imam, Shah Karim al-Husayni [[Aga Khan IV]], is undertaking the \u201cMahdi-ist\u201d mission \u2013 the functions of the Mahdi \u2013 through the work of his institutions in the [[Aga Khan Development Network]].\n\n==Other sects==\n{{Main|List of Mahdi claimants}}\n\n===Ahmadiyya===\n{{Main|Ahmadiyya}}\n{{See also|Prophethood in Ahmadiyya Islam|Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam}}\nIn Ahmadiyya belief the terms \"[[Messiah]]\" and \"Mahdi\" are synonymous terms for one and the same person.

[[Twelver]]s, who form the majority of Shi'ites today, believe that Muhammad al Mahdi who is the son of the 11th [[Imamah (Shia)|Imam]] Al-[[Hasan al-Askari]] is in [[Occultation (Islam)|occultation]] and is the awaited Mahdi. [[Tayyibi Isma'ilism|Tayyibi Isma'ili]] Shi'ites, including the [[Dawoodi Bohra]]h, believe that [[At-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim]] is the current occulted Imam and Mahdi.\n\n==Historical development==\nThe term ''Mahdi'' does not occur in the [[Quran]]. It is derived from the Arabic root ''h-d-y'' ({{lang-ar|\u0647\u062f\u064a}}), commonly used to mean \"divine guidance\". The term ''al-Mahdi'' was employed from the beginning of Islam, but only as an honorific epithet and without any messianic significance.<ref name=\"EI2\">{{Cite encyclopedia | edition = 2nd| publisher = Brill Academic Publishers| volume = 5| pages = 1230\u20138| last = Madelung| first = Wilferd | title = al-Mahd\u012b| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]| date = 1986 | isbn = 90-04-09419-9}}</ref> As an honorific it has been used in some instances to describe Muhammad (by [[Hassan ibn Thabit]]), as well as [[Abraham]], [[al-Hussain]], and various [[Umayyad]] rulers (''hud\u0101t mahdiyy\u016bn'').<ref name=\"EI2\" /> During the [[Second Fitna|second civil war]] (680\u2013692), after the death of [[Mu\u02beawiya]], the term acquired a new meaning of a ruler who would restore Islam to its perfect form and restore justice after oppression.<ref name=\"EI2\" /> In [[Kufa]] during the rebellion in 680s, [[Al-Mukhtar]] proclaimed [[Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah|Muhammad al-Hanafiyyah]] as the Mahdi in this heightened sense. Among the Umayyads, caliph [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik]] encouraged the belief that he was the Mahdi, and other Umayyad rulers, like [[Umar II]], have been addressed as such in the [[panegyrics]] of [[Jarir (poet)|Jarir]] and [[al-Farazdaq]].<ref name=\"EI2\" />\n\nEarly discussions about the identity of al-Mahdi by religious scholars can be traced back to the time after the [[Second Fitna]]. These discussions developed in different directions and were influenced by traditions ([[hadith]]s) attributed to Muhammad. In Umayyad times, scholars and traditionists not only differed on which caliph or rebel leader should be designated as Mahdi, but also on whether the Mahdi is a messianic figure and if signs and predictions of his time have been satisfied.<ref name=\"EI2\" /> By the time of the [[Abbasid Revolution]] in the year 750, Mahdi was already a known concept. Evidence shows that the first Abbasid caliph [[As-Saffah]] assumed the title of \"the Mahdi\" for himself.<ref name=\"EI2\" />\n\nIn [[Shia Islam]], it seems likely that the attribution of messianic qualities to the Mahdi originated from two of the groups supporting al-Hanafiyyah: southern Arabian settlers and local recent converts in [[Iraq]]. They became known as [[Kaysanites Shia|Kaysanites]], and introduced what later became two key aspects of the Shia's concept of the Mahdi. The first was the notion of return of the dead, particularly of the Imams. The second was that after al-Hanafiyyah's death they believed he was, in fact, in hiding in the Razwa mountains near [[Medina]]. This later developed into the doctrine known as the [[Occultation (Islam)|occultation]].<ref name=\"Arjomand 2007 134\u2013136\"/> The Mahdi appeared in early [[Shia|Shi'ite]] narratives, spread widely among Shi'ite groups and became dissociated from its historical figure, Muhammad al-Hanafiyyah. During the 10th century, based on these earlier beliefs, the doctrine of Mahdism was extensively expanded by [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni|Al-Kulayni]], [[Ali ibn Ibrahim al-Qummi|Ibrahim al-Qummi]] and [[Ibn Babawayh]].<ref name=etan /> In particular, in the early 10th century, the doctrine of the occultation, which declares that the Twelfth Imam did not die but was concealed by God from the eyes of men, was expounded. The Mahdi became synonymous with the \"Hidden Imam\" who was thought to be in occultation awaiting the time that God has ordered for his return. This return is envisaged as occurring shortly before the final Day of judgment.<ref name=momen /> In fact, the concept of the \"hidden Imam\" was attributed to several Imams in turn.<ref name=corbin />\n\nSome historians suggest that the term itself was probably introduced into Islam by southern Arabian tribes who had settled in [[Syria (region)|Syria]] in the mid-7th century. They believed that the Mahdi would lead them back to their homeland and reestablish the [[Himyarite]] kingdom. They also believed that he would eventually conquer [[Constantinople]].<ref name=\"Arjomand 2007 134\u2013136\"/> It has also been suggested that the concept of the Mahdi may have been derived from messianic Judeo-Christian beliefs.<ref name=etan/><ref name=arjomand2 /> Accordingly, traditions were introduced to support certain political interests, especially Anti-[[Abbassid]] sentiments.<ref name=arjomand2 /><ref name=reza /> These traditions about the Mahdi appeared only at later times in hadith collections such as ''[[Jami' at-Tirmidhi]]'' and ''[[Sunan Abi Dawud]]'', but are absent from the early works of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Muslim]].<ref name=Glasse/>\n\n==Sunni Islam==\nSince Sunnism has no established doctrine of Mahdi, compositions of Mahdi varies among Sunni scholars.<ref>Hong Beom Rhee ''Asian Millenarianism: An Interdisciplinary Study of the Taiping and Tonghak Rebellions in a Global Context'' Cambria Press 2006 {{ISBN|978-1-934-04342-4}} page 230</ref> While some scholars like [[Ibn Khaldun]] even disputed the authenticity of references concerning the Mahdi in [[hadith]] literature, others like [[Ibn Kathir]] elaborated a whole apocalyptic scenario which included prophecies about Mahdi, Jesus and Dajjal during the endtime.<ref>Oddbj\u00f8rn Leirvik ''Images of Jesus Christ in Islam: 2nd Edition'' A&C Black {{ISBN|978-1-441-18160-2}} page 41</ref> Some Sunni beliefs deny the Mahdi as a separate figure, accordingly Jesus will fulfill this role and judge over mankind, thus ''Mahdi'' is considered as a title for Jesus, when he returns.<ref>John L.

In this verse, Prophet Noah invited his people to God for 950 years. Some Hadiths say that he lived for 2500 years.<ref>[Shaikh Saduq, Kamal-u-Din wa Tamam-u-Ne\u2019mah, p.523.]</ref> Twenty-fifth verse of chapter Al-Kahf is the other one.

Through his deputy Mahdi would answer the demands and questions of the Shias. After Uthman ibn Sa\u2019id, his son Muhammad ibn Uthman Umari was appointed the deputy of him. After the death of Muhammad ibn Uthman, Abu\u2019l Qasim Husayn ibn Ruh Nawbakhti was the special\ndeputy, and after his death Ali ibn Muhammad Simmari was chosen for this\ntask.<ref name=Tabatabai />\n\nA few days before the death of Ali ibn Muhammad Simmari in 939 an order was issued by Mahdi stating that in six days Ali ibn Muhammad Simmari would die. Henceforth the special deputation of the Imam would come to an end and the major occultation (''ghaybat-i kubra'') would begin and would\ncontinue until the day God grants permission to the Imam to manifest himself.<ref name=Tabatabai />\n\nIn Shia view, the occultation of Mahdi is, therefore, divided into two parts:\nthe first, the minor occultation (''ghaybat-i sughra'') which began in 872 and ended in 939, lasting about seventy years; the second, the major occultation which commenced in 939 and will continue as long as God wills it. In a\nhadith upon whose authenticity Shia and Sunni agree, Muhammad has said, \"If there were to remain in the life of the world but one day, God would prolong that day until He sends in it a man from my community and my household.

Pictured are the [[Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan|Sultan Hasan]] and [[Al-Rifa'i Mosque]]s.]]\n\nThe [[Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b]] developed their own theory of the Mahdi with select Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b [[Imams]] representing the concept of Mahdi or Al-Qa'im (person) at various times. For the [[Sevener]] Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b, the Im\u0101mate ended with Isma'il ibn Ja'far, whose son [[Muhammad ibn Ismail]] was the expected Mahdi that Ja'far al-Sadiq had preached about. However, at this point the Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b Im\u0101ms according to the [[Nizari]] and [[Musta'li]] found areas where they would be able to be safe from the recently founded [[Abbasid Caliphate]], which had defeated and seized control from the Umayyads in 750 CE. During the period of Ja'far, the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] replaced the Umayyads and began to aggressively oppose belief in an Imamate. Due to strong suppression by the Abbasids, the seventh Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b Imam, [[Muhammad ibn Ismail]], went into a period of [[The Occultation#Ismaili|occultation]]. During this period his representative, the ''D\u0101\u02bf\u012b'', maintained the community. The names of the eighth, ninth, and tenth Imams are considered by some traditions to be \"hidden\", known only by their nicknames due to threats from the Abbasids.\n\nThe 11th Imam, [[Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah]], founded the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] in 909 CE in ''[[Ifriqiya]]'' (which includes present [[Tunisia]] in [[North Africa]]), ending the first occultation. In Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b eyes this act again united the Imamate and the Caliphate in one person. The Fatimids then extended up to the central [[Maghreb]] (now including [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]] and [[Libya]]). They entered and conquered Egypt in 969 CE during the reign of the fourteenth Imam, [[al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah]], and made [[Cairo]] their capital. After the eighteenth Imam, [[al-Mustansir Billah]], the Nizari sect believed that his son [[Nizar (Fatimid Imam)|Nizar]] was his successor, while another Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b branch known as the Mustaali (from whom the Dawoodi Bohra would eventually form), supported his other son, [[al-Musta'li]]. The Fatimid dynasty continued with al-Musta'li as both Imam and Caliph, and that joint position held until the 20th Imam, [[Al-Amir bi-Ahkami'l-Lah]] (1132 CE). At the death of 20th Imam Amir, one branch of the Mustaali faith claimed that he had transferred the Imamate to his son At-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim, who was then two years old. Tayyeb's claim to the imamate was endorsed by the ''Hurrah al-Malika'' (\"the Noble Queen\") [[Arwa al-Sulayhi]], the Queen of [[Yemen]], who created the office of the [[Dai al-Mutlaq]] to administer the community in the Imam's absence. [[Zoeb bin Moosa]] (d.546 [[Hijri year|AH]]/1151&nbsp;CE) was the first Dai-ul-Mutlaq, and lived and died in Haus, Yemen.<ref name=\"DaftaryIsmailis1990p104\">{{cite book |first=Farhad |last=Daftary |title=The Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs: Their history and doctrines |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge UniversityPress |year=1990 |isbn=0-521-42974-9 |page=104}}</ref> Tayyibis (which include the [[Dawoodi Bohra]]) believe the second and current period of occultation (''satr'') began after Imam Tayyeb went into seclusion and Imam from his progeny is very much present as Mahdi on earth every time.\n\nThe [[Nizari]] Ismailis maintain that the Shi\u2018a [[Ismaili]] Imams and Ismaili Muslim thinkers have explained that al-Mahdi is not a single person but actually a function undertaken by some of the hereditary Shi\u2018a Ismaili Imams from the progeny of Prophet Muhammad and Imam \u2018Ali ibn Abi Talib. Throughout history, only a certain number of Imams have had the practical means to undertake such a grand mission of establishing justice and equity and removing oppression and injustice from the world because most of the Ismaili Imams have been heavily persecuted. For example, the founder of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]], Imam \u2018Abdullah al-Mahdi, and the Fatimid-Imam Caliphs each performed the function or mission of the Mahdi. The Mahdi is therefore a mission carried out by several Shi\u2018a Ismaili Imams and not a specific individual. Today, the 49th hereditary Ismaili Imam, Shah Karim al-Husayni [[Aga Khan IV]], is undertaking the \u201cMahdi-ist\u201d mission \u2013 the functions of the Mahdi \u2013 through the work of his institutions in the [[Aga Khan Development Network]].\n\n==Other sects==\n{{Main|List of Mahdi claimants}}\n\n===Ahmadiyya===\n{{Main|Ahmadiyya}}\n{{See also|Prophethood in Ahmadiyya Islam|Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam}}\nIn Ahmadiyya belief the terms \"[[Messiah]]\" and \"Mahdi\" are synonymous terms for one and the same person.

The primary use for rubber then was for the rapid need for condoms. The 80s was an era of unprotected intercourse, and the demand for the rubber suits were at alarming rate. The government and cattle ranchers expelled many [[Rubber tapping|seringueiros]] from their land, including areas near Xapuri due to tensions surrounding the new invention of latex. At the time, the rubber industry across the nation was in decline, and land was frequently sold and burned for cattle pastures. \n\nRubber tappers additionally faced a severe lack of education. Schools were frequently forbidden on and near plantations, as the owners did not want the workers to be able to read and do arithmetic. For this reason, Mendes did not learn to read until he was 18 years old, when he sought out help interpreting his bills.<ref name=\"WalkForest\">{{Cite book|title=Walking the forest with Chico Mendes : struggle for justice in the Amazon|last=Rodrigues, Gomercindo.|date=2007|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292795044|oclc=191107529}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Chico-Mendes|title=Chico Mendes {{!}} Brazilian labour leader and conservationist|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref>\n\nMendes was taught to read and write by a man named Euclides Fernando T\u00e1vora, an activist turned rubber tapper. Most of his practice came from newspaper clippings on social and political issues within Brazil. These articles opened Chico\u2019s eyes to the widespread injustices in society, adding to his dissatisfaction with the treatment of seringueiros.\n\nAfter learning what he could from T\u00e1vora, Mendes became a literacy teacher in hopes of educating his community. As his fellow workers became more aware of unjust treatment, they formed the Rural Workers\u2019 Union, and the more localized Xapuri Rubber Tappers Union. Both of these organizations worked through peaceful protest to stop the logging and burning of the rainforest that acted as their livelihood.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Chico was known as both a radical unionist and an activist, though he also ran for several local political positions such as state deputy and city councilor.<ref>{{Cite thesis|title=Integridade ecol\u00f3gica em c\u00f3rregos de floresta de galeria do bioma Cerrado|publisher=Biblioteca Central da UNB|first=Tiago Borges|last=Kisaka|doi=10.26512/2015.03.d.18596|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Activism==\n\n{{blockquote|At first I thought I was fighting to save rubber trees, then I thought I was fighting to save the Amazon rainforest.

The primary use for rubber then was for the rapid need for condoms. The 80s was an era of unprotected intercourse, and the demand for the rubber suits were at alarming rate. The government and cattle ranchers expelled many [[Rubber tapping|seringueiros]] from their land, including areas near Xapuri due to tensions surrounding the new invention of latex. At the time, the rubber industry across the nation was in decline, and land was frequently sold and burned for cattle pastures. \n\nRubber tappers additionally faced a severe lack of education. Schools were frequently forbidden on and near plantations, as the owners did not want the workers to be able to read and do arithmetic. For this reason, Mendes did not learn to read until he was 18 years old, when he sought out help interpreting his bills.<ref name=\"WalkForest\">{{Cite book|title=Walking the forest with Chico Mendes : struggle for justice in the Amazon|last=Rodrigues, Gomercindo.|date=2007|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292795044|oclc=191107529}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Chico-Mendes|title=Chico Mendes {{!}} Brazilian labour leader and conservationist|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref>\n\nMendes was taught to read and write by a man named Euclides Fernando T\u00e1vora, an activist turned rubber tapper. Most of his practice came from newspaper clippings on social and political issues within Brazil. These articles opened Chico\u2019s eyes to the widespread injustices in society, adding to his dissatisfaction with the treatment of seringueiros.\n\nAfter learning what he could from T\u00e1vora, Mendes became a literacy teacher in hopes of educating his community. As his fellow workers became more aware of unjust treatment, they formed the Rural Workers\u2019 Union, and the more localized Xapuri Rubber Tappers Union. Both of these organizations worked through peaceful protest to stop the logging and burning of the rainforest that acted as their livelihood.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Chico was known as both a radical unionist and an activist, though he also ran for several local political positions such as state deputy and city councilor.<ref>{{Cite thesis|title=Integridade ecol\u00f3gica em c\u00f3rregos de floresta de galeria do bioma Cerrado|publisher=Biblioteca Central da UNB|first=Tiago Borges|last=Kisaka|doi=10.26512/2015.03.d.18596|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Activism==\n\n{{blockquote|At first I thought I was fighting to save rubber trees, then I thought I was fighting to save the Amazon rainforest.

One of Mendes\u2019 main ideas, and a lasting impact of his life and activism, is Brazil\u2019s [[extractive reserve]]s - forest land set aside by the Brazilian government to be managed cooperatively by locals, who keep it healthy while gathering its rubber, nuts, and other products to sell. These extractive reserves are funded in part by the [[World Bank]], which once financed roads to make the Amazon easier to cut down. Their change of heart can be attributed to Mendes\u2019 in-person, extensive lobbying of the organization.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/26/opinion/chico-mendes-s-legacy.html|title=Chico Mendes's Legacy|date=1998-12-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-05-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Following the increased pressure by the international community in the wake of the violence, the Brazilian government agreed to create extractive reserves and to demarcate Indian lands.

Messaris, who scored again three goals, became a hero and chant for the fans.\n\n=== Crisis and WWII years ===\nIn 1931, a serious disagreement between leading board member [[Apostolos Nikolaidis (athlete)|Apostolos Nikolaidis]] from one side, and some players (most notably [[Angelos Messaris]]) and club's officials on the other side,<ref name=\"ethnosport\"/> regarding the [[professionalization]] in the [[Football in Greece|Greek football]], which lasted two years, damaged the club and led to a counterproductive period. In the meantime, the HFF [[Greek Football Cup|Greek Cup]] had commenced in 1932. The last bright moment for the Greens before World War II was winning the Cup for the first time in 1940 against Aris, 3\u20131.\n\nIn 1940, with the break out of the [[Greco-Italian War]], many players of the club joined the [[Hellenic Army]]. [[Mimis Pierrakos]] was killed during the war (later, during the 1950s, his bones were transferred from Albania back to Athens). During the [[Axis Occupation of Greece]] from 1941 to 1944, many players of the team became members of [[United Panhellenic Organization of Youth]] (PEAN) resistance organization.,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xyzcontagion.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/podosfairo-polemos-katoxi-emfylios |title=Football during the War |website=Xyzcontagion.wordpress.com  |language=Greek }}</ref> while [[Michalis Papazoglou]] had a leading role in the resistance group of [[Jerzy Iwanow-Szajnowicz]].\n\nAfter this long crisis period, Panathinaikos had to wait until 1949 to win again a Greek Championship under the guidance of the Austrian coach [[Johann Strnad]]. That same year, Vangelis Panakis and [[Kostas Linoxilakis]] came to the club and quickly became the side's new star players. Panathinaikos was again champion for the [[1952\u201353 Panhellenic Championship]].\n\nUntil 1959, the team had also won seven of the last eight [[Athens Football Clubs Association|Athens Championships]], the regional championships organised in Greece. In 1959, [[Mimis Domazos]], the emblematic captain of the team, made his first appearance with Panathinaikos and the same year took place the first season under the new system of Alpha Ethniki ([[1959\u201360 Alpha Ethniki]]). Panathinaikos was the champion team.\n\n=== 1960s: The Golden Decade, the Bobek's rejuvenation ===\nDuring the next years, Panathinaikos were again champions in [[1960\u201361 Alpha Ethniki|1961]], [[1961\u201362 Alpha Ethniki|1962]], [[1963\u201364 Alpha Ethniki|1964]], [[1964\u201365 Alpha Ethniki|1965]], [[1968\u201369 Alpha Ethniki|1969]] and [[1969\u201370 Alpha Ethniki|1970]]. Moreover, the team won two more Greek Cups, in [[1966\u201367 Greek Cup|1967]] and [[1968\u201369 Greek Cup|1969]]. Also, during these years, a long process of rejuvenation took place in the club. Notable players retired, such as Panakis, Linoxilakis, [[Takis Loukanidis]] and [[Andreas Papaemmanouil]], and the team had to count on young players like Domazos, [[Antonis Antoniadis]], [[Anthimos Kapsis]], [[Kostas Eleftherakis]] and [[Takis Ikonomopoulos]].\n\n[[Stjepan Bobek]] was the main contributor to this process. In 1963, he became the club's head coach, changing the playing style of the team to a 4\u20133\u20133 and created a new team based on young players (the \"Bobek's rejuvenation\"). Under his guidance, Panathinaikos won the Championship of 1964 without a loss, making them one of the two teams that has won the Greek Championship (with its modern system) undefeated.<ref name=\"paohistory2\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.pao.gr/en/history/\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229045544/http://www.pao.gr/en/history/\n |archivedate=29 December 2015\n |title=History\n |website=Pao.gr\n |accessdate=23 June 2011\n |url-status=dead\n |df=dmy\n}}</ref> Notable players of the team included Panakis, Domazos, [[Takis Ikonomopoulos]], [[Totis Filakouris]], [[Frangiskos Sourpis]] and [[Aristidis Kamaras]].\n\nWith the establishment of the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|Greek military regime]], the president of the club, [[Loukas Panourgias]], was forced out of the presidency.

The stadium is located on [[Alexandras Avenue]] and is most commonly referred to as ''Leoforos'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for \"Avenue\"). It is considered one of the most historic stadiums in Greece, as it was used by the [[Greece national football team|Greek national team]] as home ground for many years (most recently for the [[UEFA Euro 2004]] qualifying matches) and even by Panathinaikos' biggest rivals, [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], on various occasions.\n\nPanathinaikos left ''Leoforos'' in 1984 to play in the newly-built [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Athens Olympic Stadium]]. In 2000, then-club president Angelos Filippidis announced a return to the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium, following a \u20ac7 million renovation. Capacity was reduced from 25,000 to 16,620, new dressing rooms were built and modular stand roofing was added in compliance with [[UEFA]] requirements, but in 2004, stricter standards were announced and the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium would need further expansion were it to remain suitable for UEFA-sanctioned matches. This was precluded by local zoning regulations and the team had to return to the Olympic Stadium once more until a new stadium, the proposed [[Votanikos Arena]], was built. The ''Leoforos'' ground was due for demolition.\n\nOn 27 January 2007, the board of Panathinaikos decided to reuse the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium for the team's 2007\u201308 domestic league and UEFA Cup home games. Additionally, the club officials decided to install new lawn, new seats and upgrade the press conference room and the restrooms.\n\nAs of October 2013, and due to the club's and the country's financial troubles, the construction of the Votanikos Arena has stopped and consequently the plans for the demolition of the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium have been put on hold. After another five-year spell at the Olympic Stadium, the team has returned to its traditional home ground once again.\n\nThe current president of the club, [[Giannis Alafouzos]], declared his intention for another renovation of the stadium and the capacity increase, while the [[Panathinaikos Movement]] made its propositions for a total reconstruction.\n\nIn 2019 the owner of Panathinaikos basketball team presented a funding plan for the construction of  the new football and basketball stadiums of [[Panathinaikos A.O.]] \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

In 2013, was decided the move of the club from the previous training center of Paiania to a new one, owned by the team. Located in the area of [[Koropi]], [[Georgios Kalafatis Sports Center]] became a new training ground and Academy base of Panathinaikos.\n\n==Financial information==\nUntil 1979, football in Greece was still in amateur level. The team, such as the other departments of [[Panathinaikos A.O.]], depended on the financial support of the club's members, while the president (responsible for all athletic departments) was elected by the Board members. In 1979, the Greek football turned professional and the Vardinogiannis family purchased the football department. [[Yiorgos Vardinogiannis|Giorgos Vardinogiannis]] became the new president.<ref name=\"ethnosport\"/> Vardinogiannis family were the owners of the club the next decades.\n\nOn 22 April 2008, and under pressure from the fan base, main shareholder Giannis Vardinogiannis gave a press conference in which he announced the decision of his family to reduce their share in the club to 50%\u2014after 30 years of full ownership\u2014through a \u20ac80 million increase of the company's capital stock. After the negotiations and the share capital increase, the Vardinogiannis family would hold 56% of the club, the amateur Club 10% (as before) and the new shareholders 34%.

Messaris, who scored again three goals, became a hero and chant for the fans.\n\n=== Crisis and WWII years ===\nIn 1931, a serious disagreement between leading board member [[Apostolos Nikolaidis (athlete)|Apostolos Nikolaidis]] from one side, and some players (most notably [[Angelos Messaris]]) and club's officials on the other side,<ref name=\"ethnosport\"/> regarding the [[professionalization]] in the [[Football in Greece|Greek football]], which lasted two years, damaged the club and led to a counterproductive period. In the meantime, the HFF [[Greek Football Cup|Greek Cup]] had commenced in 1932. The last bright moment for the Greens before World War II was winning the Cup for the first time in 1940 against Aris, 3\u20131.\n\nIn 1940, with the break out of the [[Greco-Italian War]], many players of the club joined the [[Hellenic Army]]. [[Mimis Pierrakos]] was killed during the war (later, during the 1950s, his bones were transferred from Albania back to Athens). During the [[Axis Occupation of Greece]] from 1941 to 1944, many players of the team became members of [[United Panhellenic Organization of Youth]] (PEAN) resistance organization.,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xyzcontagion.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/podosfairo-polemos-katoxi-emfylios |title=Football during the War |website=Xyzcontagion.wordpress.com  |language=Greek }}</ref> while [[Michalis Papazoglou]] had a leading role in the resistance group of [[Jerzy Iwanow-Szajnowicz]].\n\nAfter this long crisis period, Panathinaikos had to wait until 1949 to win again a Greek Championship under the guidance of the Austrian coach [[Johann Strnad]]. That same year, Vangelis Panakis and [[Kostas Linoxilakis]] came to the club and quickly became the side's new star players. Panathinaikos was again champion for the [[1952\u201353 Panhellenic Championship]].\n\nUntil 1959, the team had also won seven of the last eight [[Athens Football Clubs Association|Athens Championships]], the regional championships organised in Greece. In 1959, [[Mimis Domazos]], the emblematic captain of the team, made his first appearance with Panathinaikos and the same year took place the first season under the new system of Alpha Ethniki ([[1959\u201360 Alpha Ethniki]]). Panathinaikos was the champion team.\n\n=== 1960s: The Golden Decade, the Bobek's rejuvenation ===\nDuring the next years, Panathinaikos were again champions in [[1960\u201361 Alpha Ethniki|1961]], [[1961\u201362 Alpha Ethniki|1962]], [[1963\u201364 Alpha Ethniki|1964]], [[1964\u201365 Alpha Ethniki|1965]], [[1968\u201369 Alpha Ethniki|1969]] and [[1969\u201370 Alpha Ethniki|1970]]. Moreover, the team won two more Greek Cups, in [[1966\u201367 Greek Cup|1967]] and [[1968\u201369 Greek Cup|1969]]. Also, during these years, a long process of rejuvenation took place in the club. Notable players retired, such as Panakis, Linoxilakis, [[Takis Loukanidis]] and [[Andreas Papaemmanouil]], and the team had to count on young players like Domazos, [[Antonis Antoniadis]], [[Anthimos Kapsis]], [[Kostas Eleftherakis]] and [[Takis Ikonomopoulos]].\n\n[[Stjepan Bobek]] was the main contributor to this process. In 1963, he became the club's head coach, changing the playing style of the team to a 4\u20133\u20133 and created a new team based on young players (the \"Bobek's rejuvenation\"). Under his guidance, Panathinaikos won the Championship of 1964 without a loss, making them one of the two teams that has won the Greek Championship (with its modern system) undefeated.<ref name=\"paohistory2\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.pao.gr/en/history/\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229045544/http://www.pao.gr/en/history/\n |archivedate=29 December 2015\n |title=History\n |website=Pao.gr\n |accessdate=23 June 2011\n |url-status=dead\n |df=dmy\n}}</ref> Notable players of the team included Panakis, Domazos, [[Takis Ikonomopoulos]], [[Totis Filakouris]], [[Frangiskos Sourpis]] and [[Aristidis Kamaras]].\n\nWith the establishment of the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|Greek military regime]], the president of the club, [[Loukas Panourgias]], was forced out of the presidency.

The stadium is located on [[Alexandras Avenue]] and is most commonly referred to as ''Leoforos'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for \"Avenue\"). It is considered one of the most historic stadiums in Greece, as it was used by the [[Greece national football team|Greek national team]] as home ground for many years (most recently for the [[UEFA Euro 2004]] qualifying matches) and even by Panathinaikos' biggest rivals, [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], on various occasions.\n\nPanathinaikos left ''Leoforos'' in 1984 to play in the newly-built [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Athens Olympic Stadium]]. In 2000, then-club president Angelos Filippidis announced a return to the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium, following a \u20ac7 million renovation. Capacity was reduced from 25,000 to 16,620, new dressing rooms were built and modular stand roofing was added in compliance with [[UEFA]] requirements, but in 2004, stricter standards were announced and the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium would need further expansion were it to remain suitable for UEFA-sanctioned matches. This was precluded by local zoning regulations and the team had to return to the Olympic Stadium once more until a new stadium, the proposed [[Votanikos Arena]], was built. The ''Leoforos'' ground was due for demolition.\n\nOn 27 January 2007, the board of Panathinaikos decided to reuse the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium for the team's 2007\u201308 domestic league and UEFA Cup home games. Additionally, the club officials decided to install new lawn, new seats and upgrade the press conference room and the restrooms.\n\nAs of October 2013, and due to the club's and the country's financial troubles, the construction of the Votanikos Arena has stopped and consequently the plans for the demolition of the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium have been put on hold. After another five-year spell at the Olympic Stadium, the team has returned to its traditional home ground once again.\n\nThe current president of the club, [[Giannis Alafouzos]], declared his intention for another renovation of the stadium and the capacity increase, while the [[Panathinaikos Movement]] made its propositions for a total reconstruction.\n\nIn 2019 the owner of Panathinaikos basketball team presented a funding plan for the construction of  the new football and basketball stadiums of [[Panathinaikos A.O.]] \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

In 2013, was decided the move of the club from the previous training center of Paiania to a new one, owned by the team. Located in the area of [[Koropi]], [[Georgios Kalafatis Sports Center]] became a new training ground and Academy base of Panathinaikos.\n\n==Financial information==\nUntil 1979, football in Greece was still in amateur level. The team, such as the other departments of [[Panathinaikos A.O.]], depended on the financial support of the club's members, while the president (responsible for all athletic departments) was elected by the Board members. In 1979, the Greek football turned professional and the Vardinogiannis family purchased the football department. [[Yiorgos Vardinogiannis|Giorgos Vardinogiannis]] became the new president.<ref name=\"ethnosport\"/> Vardinogiannis family were the owners of the club the next decades.\n\nOn 22 April 2008, and under pressure from the fan base, main shareholder Giannis Vardinogiannis gave a press conference in which he announced the decision of his family to reduce their share in the club to 50%\u2014after 30 years of full ownership\u2014through a \u20ac80 million increase of the company's capital stock. After the negotiations and the share capital increase, the Vardinogiannis family would hold 56% of the club, the amateur Club 10% (as before) and the new shareholders 34%.

Its train services are transitioning from a peak direction commuter railway to a [[GO Transit Regional Express Rail|Regional Express Network]].]]\n\nMost commuter (or suburban) trains are built to main line rail standards,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} differing from [[light rail]] or [[rapid transit]] (metro rail)  systems by:\n*being larger\n*providing more seating and less standing room, owing to the longer distances involved\n*having (in most cases) a lower frequency of service\n*having scheduled services (i.e. trains run at specific times rather than at specific intervals)\n*serving lower-density suburban areas, typically connecting [[suburb]]s to the city center\n*sharing track or [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] with intercity or [[freight]] trains\n*not fully grade separated (containing at-grade crossings with crossing gates)\n*being able to skip certain stations as an express service due to normally being driver controlled\n\n===Train schedule===\nCompared to [[rapid transit]] (or metro rail), commuter/suburban rail often has lower [[headway|frequency]], following a schedule rather than fixed intervals, and fewer stations spaced further apart. They primarily serve lower density suburban areas (non inner-city), and often share [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] with intercity or [[freight]] trains. Some services operate only during peak hours and others uses fewer departures during off peak hours and weekends. Average speeds are high, often 50&nbsp;km/h (30&nbsp;mph) or higher. These higher speeds better serve the longer distances involved. Some services include express services which skip some stations in order to run faster and separate longer distance riders from short-distance ones.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe general range of commuter trains' distance varies between 15 and 200&nbsp;km (10 and 125 miles).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Sometimes long distances can be explained by that the train runs between two or several cities (e.g. S-Bahn in the [[Ruhr]] area of Germany). Distances between stations may vary, but are usually much longer than those of urban rail systems. In city centers the train either has a terminal station or passes through the city centre with notably fewer station stops than those of urban rail systems. Toilets are often available on-board trains and in stations.\n\n===Track===\nTheir ability to coexist with freight or intercity services in the same [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] can drastically reduce system construction costs. However, frequently they are built with dedicated tracks within that right-of-way to prevent delays, especially where service densities have converged in the inner parts of the network.\n\nMost such trains run on the [[List of track gauges|local standard gauge]] track. Some systems may run on a narrower or broader gauge. Examples of [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] systems are found in Japan, [[Kereta Commuter Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[KTM Komuter|Malaysia]], [[Greater Bangkok Commuter rail|Thailand]], Switzerland, in the [[Brisbane]] ([[Queensland Rail]]'s [[Queensland Rail City network|City network]]) and [[Perth]] ([[Transperth]]) systems in Australia, in some systems in Sweden, and on the [[:it:Ferrovia Genova-Casella|Genoa-Casella line]] in Italy. Some countries and regions, including [[Helsinki commuter rail|Finland]], India, Pakistan, [[Elektrichka|Russia]], Brazil and Sri Lanka, as well as [[San Francisco]] ([[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]]) in the US and [[Metro Trains Melbourne|Melbourne]] and [[Adelaide Metro|Adelaide]] in Australia, use [[broad gauge]] track.\n\n===Distinction between other modes of rail===\n\n====Metro====\nMetro rail or [[rapid transit]] usually covers a smaller inner-urban area ranging outwards to between 12&nbsp;km to 20&nbsp;km (or 8 to 14 miles), has a higher train frequency and runs on separate tracks (underground or elevated), whereas commuter rail often shares tracks, technology and the legal framework within mainline railway systems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nHowever, the classification as a metro or rapid rail can be difficult as both may typically cover a metropolitan area exclusively, run on separate tracks in the centre, and often feature purpose-built rolling stock. The fact that the terminology is not standardised across countries (even across English-speaking countries) further complicates matters. This distinction is most easily made when there are two (or more) systems such as New York's [[New York City Subway|subway]] and the [[Long Island Rail Road|LIRR]] and [[Metro-North Railroad]], Paris' [[Paris M\u00e9tro|M\u00e9tro]] and [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] along with [[Transilien]], London's tube lines of the [[London Underground|Underground]] and the [[London Overground|Overground]], (future) [[Crossrail]], [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]] along with other commuter rail [[Transport in London#Heavy rail|operators]], Madrid's [[Madrid Metro|Metro]] and [[Cercan\u00edas Madrid|Cercan\u00edas]], Barcelona's [[Barcelona Metro|Metro]] and [[Rodalies de Catalunya|Rodalies]], and Tokyo's [[Tokyo subway|subway]] and the [[East Japan Railway Company#Greater Tokyo Area|JR lines]] along with various privately owned and operated commuter rail systems.\n\n====S-Trains====\n\nAn [[S-Train]] is a type of hybrid [[urban rail|urban]]-[[suburban rail]] serving a [[metropolitan region]]. The most well-known S-train systems are the S-Bahn systems in Germany and Austria. Other well-known examples of S-train systems include the [[Copenhagen S-train|S-tog]] in [[Copenhagen]] and S-Bahn/RER systems in [[Switzerland]]. In Germany, the [[S-Bahn]] is regarded as a train category of its own, and exists in many large cities and in some other areas, with differing service and technical standards from city to city. \nMost S-Bahns typically behave like commuter rail with most trackage not separated from other trains, and long lines with trains running between cities and suburbs rather than within a city. The distances between stations however, are usually short. In larger systems there is usually a high frequency metro-like central corridor in the city center where all the lines converge into. Typical examples of large city S-Bahns include Munich and Frankfurt. S-Bahns also exist in some mid-size cities like Rostock and Magdeburg but behave more like typical commuter rail with lower frequencies and very little exclusive trackage. In [[Berlin]], the [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn systems]] arguably fulfill all considerations of a true metro system (despite the existence of [[U-Bahn]]s as well) \u2013 the trains run on tracks that are entirely separated from other trains, short distances between stations, high frequency and uses tunnels but do run a bit further out from the city centre, compared with U-Bahn. In Hamburg and Copenhagen, other, diesel driven trains, do continue where the S-Bahn ends (\"[[AKN Eisenbahn|A-Bahn]]\" in Hamburg area, and \"L-tog\" in Copenhagen).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n====Regional rail====\n[[Regional rail]] usually provides [[rail transport|rail services]] between towns and cities, rather than purely linking major population hubs in the way [[inter-city rail]] does. Regional rail operates outside major cities. Unlike Inter-city, it stops at most or all stations between cities. It provides a service between smaller communities along the line, and also connections with long-distance services at interchange stations located at junctions or at larger towns along the line. Alternative names are \"local train\" or \"stopping train\". Examples include the former [[British Rail|BR]]'s [[Regional Railways]], France's [[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]] (''Transport express r\u00e9gional''), Germany's [[DB Regio]] and South Korea's [[Tonggeun]] services.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nRegional rail does not exist in this sense in the United States, so the term \"regional rail\" has become synonymous with commuter rail there, although the two are more clearly defined in Europe.\n\n====Inter-city rail====\n{{see also|Inter-city rail}}\n[[File:Sydney Trains H22 OSCAR.jpg|thumb|A [[NSW TrainLink]] [[NSW TrainLink H set|H set]] at Sydney's [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central station]].]]\nIn some European countries the distinction between commuter trains and long-distance/intercity trains is very hard to make, because of the relatively short distances involved. For example, so-called \"[[Inter-city rail|intercity]]\" trains in Belgium and the Netherlands carry many commuters and their equipment, range and speeds are similar to those of commuter trains in some larger countries. In the United Kingdom there is no real division of organisation and brand name between commuter, regional and inter-city trains, making it hard to categorize train connections.\n\n[[Elektrichka|Russian commuter trains]], on the other hand, frequently cover areas larger than Belgium itself, although these are still short distances by Russian standards. They have a different ticketing system from long-distance trains, and in major cities they often operate from a separate section of the train station.\n\nThe easiest way to identify these \"inter-city\" services is that they tend to operate as express services - only linking the main stations in the cities they link, not stopping at any other stations. However, this term is used in Australia (Sydney for example) to describe the regional trains operating beyond the boundaries of the suburban services, even though some of these \"inter-city\" services stop all stations similar to German regional services. In this regard, the German service delineations and corresponding naming conventions are clearer and better used for academic purposes.\n\n====High-speed rail====\nSometimes [[high-speed rail]] can serve daily use of commuters. The Japanese [[Shinkansen]] high speed rail system is heavily used by commuters in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]]. They commute between 100 and 200&nbsp;km by [[Shinkansen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-high-speed-rail-development-worldwide|title=Fact Sheet: High Speed Rail Development Worldwide {{!}} White Papers {{!}} EESI|website=www.eesi.org|access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref> To meet the demand of commuters, [[Japan Railways Group|JR]] sells commuter discount passes and operates 16-car [[bilevel car|bilevel]] [[E4 Series Shinkansen]] trains at rush hour, providing a capacity of 1,600 seats. Several lines in China, such as the [[Beijing\u2013Tianjin Intercity Railway]] and the [[Shanghai\u2013Nanjing High-Speed Railway]], serve a similar role with many more under construction or planned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shine.cn/news/metro/1806116099/|title=Metro closes the gap with areas across the border - SHINE|website=SHINE|language=en|access-date=2018-06-23}}</ref>\n\nThe high-speed services linking [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Bern]] and [[Basel]] in [[Switzerland]] ({{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}) have brought the Central Business Districts (CBDs) of these three cities within 1 hour of each other. This has resulted in unexpectedly high demand for new commuter trips between the three cities and a corresponding increase in suburban rail passengers accessing the high-speed services at the main city-centre stations (or Hauptbahnhof). The [[Regional-Express]] commuter service between [[Munich]] and [[Nuremberg]] in Germany go in ({{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}) along a [[Nuremberg\u2013Munich high-speed railway|300 km/h high-speed line]].\n\nThe regional trains [[Stockholm]]\u2013[[Uppsala]], Stockholm\u2013[[V\u00e4ster\u00e5s]], Stockholm\u2013[[Eskilstuna]] and [[Gothenburg]]\u2013[[Trollh\u00e4ttan]] in [[Sweden]] reach {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}} and have many daily commuters.\n\n==Train types==\nCommuter/suburban trains are usually optimized for maximum passenger volume, in most cases without sacrificing too much comfort and [[luggage]] space, though they seldom have all the amenities of long-distance trains. Cars may be single- or [[bilevel car|double-level]], and aim to provide seating for all. Compared to intercity trains, they have less space, fewer amenities and limited baggage areas.\n\n===Multiple unit type===\n\nCommuter rail trains are usually composed of [[multiple unit]]s, which are self-propelled, bidirectional, articulated passenger rail cars with driving motors on each (or every other) [[bogie]]. Depending on local circumstances and tradition they may be powered either by [[diesel engines]] located below the passenger compartment ([[diesel multiple unit]]s) or by electricity picked up from [[third rail]]s or [[overhead lines]] ([[electric multiple unit]]s). Multiple units are almost invariably equipped with control cabs at both ends, which is why such units are so frequently used to provide commuter services, due to the associated short turn-around time.\n\n===Locomotive hauled services===\n[[File:ACE EMD F40PH Fremont - San Jose.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Altamont Corridor Express]] train operating along the [[San Francisco Bay]]; a MPI F40PH-2C locomotive hauls a consist of Bombardier Bi-Level VI coaches.]]\nLocomotive hauled services are used in some countries or locations. This is often a case of [[Business operations|asset sweating]], by using a single large combined fleet for intercity and regional services. Loco hauled services are usually run in [[Push-pull train|push-pull]] formation, that is, the train can run with the locomotive at the \"front\" or \"rear\" of the train (pushing or pulling). Trains are often equipped with a control cab at the other end of the train from the locomotive, allowing the train operator to operate the train from either end. The motive power for locomotive-hauled commuter trains may be either electric or [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]], although some countries, such as Germany and some of the former Soviet-bloc countries, also use diesel-hydraulic locomotives.\n\n=== Seat plans ===\nIn the US and some other countries, a three-and-two seat plan is used. However, few people sit in the middle seat on these trains because they feel crowded and uncomfortable.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/31/nyregion/for-train-riders-middle-seat-isnt-the-center-of-attention.html|title=For Train Riders, Middle Seat Isn't the Center of Attention|first=Patrick|last=McGeehan|date=31 May 2005|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/06/opinion/on-the-802-express-threes-a-crowd-139947.html|title=On the 8:02 Express, Three's a Crowd|date=6 June 2005|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nIn Japan and South Korea, longitudinal (sideways window-lining) seating is widely used in many commuter rail trains to increase capacity in rush hours. Carriages are usually not organized to increase [[seating capacity]] (although in some trains at least one carriage would feature more doors to facilitate easier boarding and alighting and bench seats so that they can be folded up during rush hour to provide more standing room) even in the case of commuting longer than 50&nbsp;km and commuters in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]] and the [[Seoul metropolitan area]] have to stand in the train for more than an hour.\n\n==Commuter rail systems around the world==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}\n\n===Africa===\n{{See also|Template:Suburban railways in Africa}}\n[[File:Kalk Bay Station 3.jpg|thumb|A [[Metrorail (South Africa)|Metrorail]] train pulling out of [[Kalk Bay]] station in [[Cape Town]]]]\nCurrently there are not many examples of commuter rail in Africa. [[Metrorail (South Africa)|Metrorail]] operates in the major cities of South Africa, and there are some commuter rail services in Algeria, Botswana, Kenya, Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia.\nIn Algeria, [[SNTF]] operates commuter rail lines between the capital [[Algiers]] and its southern and eastern suburbs. They also serve to connect [[Algiers]]' main [[University of Science and Technology, Houari Boumediene|universities]] to each other. The [[Dar es Salaam commuter rail]] offers intracity services in [[Dar es Salaam]], Tanzania. In Botswana, the ([[Botswana Railways]]) \"BR Express\" has a commuter train between [[Lobatse]] and [[Gaborone]].\n\n===Asia===\n\n====East Asia====\n[[File:Tokyo Metro 16000 Series 16111f Semi Express.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Tokyo Metro 16000 series]] train operating a through service on the [[JR East]] [[Joban Line]], an example of high-density commuter rail in Japan.]]\n\nIn Japan, commuter rail systems have extensive network and frequent service and are heavily used. In many cases, Japanese commuter rail is operationally more like a typical metro system (with very high operating frequencies, an emphasis on [[standing passenger]]s, short station spacing) than it is like commuter rail in other countries. Japanese commuter rail also tends to be heavily interlined with subway lines, with commuter rail trains continuing into the subway network, and then out onto different commuter rail systems on the other side of the city.  Many Japanese commuter systems operate several levels of express trains to reduce the travel time to distant locations, often using station bypass tracks instead of dedicated express tracks. It is notable that the larger Japanese commuter rail systems are owned and operated by for-profit [[private railway]] companies, without public subsidy.\n\nCommuter rail systems have been inaugurated in several cities in China such as [[Beijing Suburban Railway|Beijing]], [[Jinshan Railway|Shanghai]], [[Central Plain Metropolitan Intercity Rail|Zhengzhou]], [[Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway|Wuhan]], [[Changsha\u2013Zhuzhou\u2013Xiangtan Intercity Railway|Changsha]] and the [[Pearl River Delta Rapid Transit|Pearl River Delta]]. With plans for large systems in northeastern [[Zhejiang]], [[Jingjinji]], and [[Yangtze River Delta]] areas. The level of service varies considerably from line to line ranging [[high speed rail|high]] to near high speeds. More developed and established lines such as the [[Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen Railway|Guangshen Railway]] have more frequent metro like service. Hong Kong [[MTR]]'s [[East Rail Line]], [[West Rail Line]] and [[Tung Chung Line]] were built to commuter rail standards but are operated as a metro system.\n\nIn Taiwan, [[West Coast line (Taiwan)|Western Line]] in [[Taipei]]-[[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan]] Metropolitan Area, [[Taichung]] Metropolitan Area, [[Tainan]]-[[Kaohsiung]] Metropolitan Area as well as [[Neiwan Line|Neiwan]]-[[Liujia Line]] in [[Hsinchu]] Area is considered commuter rail.\n\nOther examples in East Asia include [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]] of which some lines are suburban lines operated by [[Korail]] in South Korea.\n\n====Southeast Asia====\n[[File:Commuterline at Palmerah Station 4.JPG|thumb|right|Electric multiple unit of [[KA Commuter Jabodetabek|KRL Commuterline]] [[KA Commuter Line Tanah Abang-Maja|Serpong Line]] train at Palmerah Station, [[Jakarta]]]]\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], the [[KRL Commuterline]] is the largest commuter rail system in the country, serving [[Jabodetabek|Jakarta metropolitan area]]. It connects the [[Jakarta]] city center with surrounding cities and sub-urbans in [[Banten]] and [[West Java]] provinces, including [[Depok]], [[Bogor]], [[Tangerang]], [[Bekasi]], Serpong and Maja. In July 2015, KA Commuter Jabodetabek served more than 850,000 passengers per day, which is almost triple of the 2011 figures, but still less than 3.5% of all Jabodetabek commutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2015/07/06/14142481/PT.KCJ.Keterlambatan.KRL.Sudah.di.Bawah.10.Menit |title=PT KCJ: Keterlambatan KRL Sudah di Bawah 10 Menit |date=July 6, 2015}}</ref> Other commuter rail systems in Indonesia include the [[Metro Surabaya Commuter Line]], [[Prambanan Express|Prambanan Ekspres Commuter]], Solo Ekspres, Kedung Sepur, Greater Bandung Commuter, and Cut Meutia.\n\nIn the Philippines, the [[Philippine National Railways]] has two commuter rail systems currently operational; the [[PNR Metro Commuter Line]] in the [[Greater Manila Area]] and the [[PNR Bicol Commuter]] in the [[Bicol Region]]. A new commuter rail line in Metro Manila, the [[North\u2013South Commuter Railway]], is currently under construction. Its North section is set to be partially opened by 2021.\n\nIn Malaysia, the [[KTM Komuter]] serves [[Kuala Lumpur]] and the surrounding [[Klang Valley|Klang Valley area]].\n\nIn Thailand, the [[Greater Bangkok Commuter rail]] and the [[Airport Rail Link (Bangkok)|Airport Rail Link]] serve the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]]. The [[SRT Red Lines]], a new commuter line in Bangkok, started construction in 2009. It is currently slated to be opened by 2020.\n\nAnother commuter rail system in Southeast Asia is the [[Yangon Circular Railway]] in [[Myanmar]].\n\n====South Asia====\nIn India, commuter rail systems are present in major cities. [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]], the oldest suburban rail system in Asia, carries more than 7.24 million commuters on a daily basis which constitutes more than half of the total daily passenger capacity of the Indian Railways itself. [[Kolkata Suburban Railway]] is the biggest Suburban Railway network in India covering 348 stations carries more than 3.5 million commuters per day. The [[Chennai Suburban Railway]] along with [[Chennai MRTS|MRTS]] is another railway of comparison where more than 1 million people travel daily to different areas in [[Chennai]]. Other commuter railways in India include [[Hyderabad MMTS]], [[Delhi Suburban Railway]], [[Pune Suburban Railway]] and [[Lucknow-Kanpur Suburban Railway]].\n\nDelhi Regional Rapid Transit System(RRTS) is under construction on 3 routes in [[National Capital Region|Delhi NCR]].The rotes have planned according to  [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] suburban lines in [[Paris]].\n\n==== West Asia ====\nIn Iran, SYSTRA has done a \"Tehran long term urban rail study\". SYSTRA proposed 4 express lines similar to [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] suburban lines in [[Paris]]. [[Tehran Metro]] is going to construct express lines. For instance, the Rahyab Behineh, a consultant for Tehran Metro, is studying Tehran Express Line 2. Tehran Metro currently has a commuter line between [[Tehran]] and [[Karaj]]. [[Isfahan]] has two lines to its suburbs [[Baharestan]] and [[Fuladshahr]] under construction, and a third line to [[Shahinshahr]] is planned.\n\n===Europe===\n{{Main|R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|Commuter rail in the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:Ny pendeltag stockholm.jpg|thumb|right|Type [[SL X60|X60]] at Stockholm Central in Sweden]]\nMajor metropolitan areas in most European countries are usually served by extensive commuter/suburban rail systems. Well-known examples include [[BG Voz]] in [[Belgrade]] (Serbia), [[S-Bahn]] in Germany and German-speaking areas of Switzerland and Austria, [[Proastiakos]] in Greece, [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] in France and Belgium, [[Milan suburban railway service|suburban lines]] in [[Milan]] (Italy), [[Cercan\u00edas]] and [[Rodalies de Catalunya|Rodalies]] ([[Catalonia]]) in Spain, [[CP Urban Services]] in Portugal, [[Esko Prague|Esko]] in [[Prague]] and [[Ostrava]] (Czech Republic), [[H\u00c9V]] in [[Budapest]] (Hungary) and [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]] in [[Dublin]] (Ireland).\n\nIn Russia, Ukraine and some other countries of the former [[Soviet Union]], electrical multiple unit passenger suburban trains called [[Elektrichka]] are widespread.\n\nIn Sweden, electrified commuter rail systems known as ''Pendelt\u00e5g'' are present in the cities of [[Stockholm]] and [[Gothenburg]]. The [[Stockholm commuter rail]] system, which began in 1968, is similar to the S-Bahn train systems of Munich and Frankfurt such that it may share railway tracks with inter-city trains and freight trains, but for the most part run on its own dedicated tracks, and that it is primarily used to transport passengers from nearby towns and other suburban areas into the city centre, not for transportation inside the city centre. The [[Gothenburg commuter rail]] system, which began in 1960, is similar to the Stockholm system, but does fully share tracks with long-distance trains. Other train systems that are also considered as commuter rail but not counted as ''pendelt\u00e5g'' include [[Roslagsbanan]] and [[Saltsj\u00f6banan]] in Stockholm, [[M\u00e4lart\u00e5g]] in the [[M\u00e4laren Valley]], [[\u00d6stg\u00f6tapendeln]] in [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland County]], [[Uppt\u00e5get]] in [[Uppsala County]], [[Norrt\u00e5g]] in northern [[Norrland]] and [[Sk\u00e5ne Commuter Rail]] in [[Sk\u00e5ne County]]. Sk\u00e5ne Commuter Rail (''P\u00e5gat\u00e5gen'') acts also as a regional rail system, as it serves cities over 100&nbsp;km (62 miles) and over one hour from the principal city of [[Malm\u00f6]].\n\nIn Norway, the [[Oslo Commuter Rail|Oslo commuter rail]] system mostly shares tracks with more long-distance trains, but also runs on some local railways without other traffic. Oslo has the largest commuter rail system in the Nordic countries in terms of line lengths and number of stations. But some lines have travel times (over an hour from Oslo) and frequencies (once per hour) which are more like regional trains. Also [[Bergen Commuter Rail|Bergen]], [[J\u00e6ren Commuter Rail|Stavanger]] and [[Tr\u00f8nderbanen|Trondheim]] have commuter rail systems. These have only one or two lines each and they share tracks with other trains.\n\nIn [[Finland]], the [[Helsinki commuter rail]] network runs on dedicated tracks from [[Helsinki Central railway station]] to [[Lepp\u00e4vaara railway station|Lepp\u00e4vaara]] and [[Kerava]]. The [[Ring Rail Line]] serves [[Helsinki Airport]] and northern suburbs of [[Vantaa]] and is exclusively used by the commuter rail network. On 15 December 2019 Tampere got its own commuter rail service.\n\nIn Poland, commuter rail systems exist in [[Szybka Kolej Miejska (Tricity)|Tricity]], [[Szybka Kolej Miejska (Warsaw)|Warsaw]], [[Krakow]] and [[Katowice]]. There is also a similar system planned in [[Wroc\u0142aw]] and [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]].\n\nIn Romania, the first commuter trains were introduced in December 2019. They operate currently between [[Bucharest]] and Funduea or [[Buftea]].\n\n===Americas===\n====North and Central America====\n{{Main|Commuter rail in North America}}\n[[File:Metrolink F59PHI 885.jpg|thumb|Metrolink provides commuter rail service to six counties in Southern California.]]\nIn the United States, Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Mexico regional passenger rail services are provided by governmental or quasi-governmental agencies, with a limited number of metropolitan areas served.\n\nEight commuter rail systems in the United States carried over ten million trips in 2018:{{Fix|text=which eight out of this list?}}\n* [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]'s [[Long Island Rail Road]], serving [[New York City]] and [[Long Island]]\n* [[NJ Transit Rail Operations]], serving New York City, New Jersey ([[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]]) and [[Philadelphia]]\n* Metropolitan Transportation Authority's [[Metro-North Railroad]], serving New York ([[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]] and New York City) and Southwest Connecticut ([[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]])\n* [[Metra]], serving northeast Illinois ([[Chicago]]), [[Northern Indiana]], and [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]\n* [[SEPTA Regional Rail]], serving southeast Pennsylvania (Philadelphia), as well as [[Wilmington, Delaware]], and [[Trenton, New Jersey]]\n* [[Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority]], serving Massachusetts (Boston, [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]]) and [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]]\n* [[Caltrain]], serving California ([[San Francisco]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], and the [[San Francisco Peninsula]])\n* [[Metrolink (California)|Metrolink]], serving California ([[Los Angeles]], [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], and [[Southern California]])\n*[[Utah Transit Authority]] [[FrontRunner]], serving Utah ([[Wasatch Front]])\n*[[North County Transit District]] [[Coaster (San Diego)|Coaster]], serving California ([[San Diego County]])\n*[[Maryland Area Regional Commuter]], serving [[Maryland]] ([[Baltimore]]) and [[Washington, D.C.]]\n*[[Regional Transportation District]], serving [[Colorado]] ([[Denver]])\n*[[Virginia Railway Express]], serving suburbs of [[Northern Virginia]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]\n*[[Sounder commuter rail]], serving [[Washington (state)|Washington]] ([[Seattle]] / [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]])\n*[[Tri-Rail]], serving [[Florida]] ([[Miami]] / [[Fort Lauderdale]] / [[West Palm Beach]])\n*[[Trinity Railway Express]], serving [[Texas]] ([[Dallas]] / [[Fort Worth]])\n*[[Altamont Corridor Express]], serving [[California]] ([[San Jose, California|San Jose]] / [[Stockton, California|Stockton]])\n*[[SunRail]], serving [[Florida]] ([[Orlando]]/[[Poinciana, Florida|Poinciana]])\n*[[WES Commuter Rail]], serving [[Oregon]] ([[Beaverton, Oregon|Beverton]]/[[willsonville, Oregon|Willsonville]])\n*[[New Mexico Rail Runner Express]], serving [[New Mexico]] ([[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]])\n*[[Northstar Line]], serving [[Minnesota]] ([[Big Lake, Minnesota|Big Lake]] and downtown [[Minneapolis]])\n*[[Capital MetroRail]], serving [[Texas]] ([[Austin]])\n*[[A-train (Denton County)|A-train]],serving [[Texas]] ([[Denton County]])\n*[[Sonoma\u2013Marin Area Rail Transit|SMART]], serving [[California]] ([[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma]] and [[Marin County, California|Marin]] counties)\n*[[Music City Star]], serving [[Nashville]] and [[Lebanon, Tennessee]].\n\nNorth American commuter rail systems outside of the United States include:\n* [[GO Transit rail services]] in [[Toronto]]\n* [[Exo (public transit)|Exo]] in [[Montreal]]\n* [[West Coast Express]] in [[Vancouver]]\n* [[Suburban Railway of the Valley of Mexico Metropolitan Area]] serving [[Mexico City]]\n* [[Toluca-M\u00e9xico City commuter line]] serving [[Toluca]] and [[Mexico City]]\n\n===Central America===\n*[[Rail Transport in Honduras|City Rail]] serving [[La Ceiba]]\n*[[Rail Transport in El Salvador|San Salvador Suburban Rail]] serving [[San Salvador]] and [[Santa Ana, El Salvador|Santa Ana]]\n*[[Tren Urbano de Costa Rica|Rail Transport in Costa Rica]] serving [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jose]]\n\n====South America====\n[[File:EMU CSR M20 en Barrancas.jpg|thumb|The [[Mitre Line]] is part of the extensive [[Rail transport in Argentina#Commuter networks|Buenos Aires metropolitan rail system]].]]\nExamples include an {{convert|899|km|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} commuter system in the [[Rail transport in Argentina#Commuter networks|Buenos Aires metropolitan area]], the {{convert|225|km|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} long [[Supervia]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the [[Metrotr\u00e9n]] in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]], and the [[Valpara\u00edso Metro]] in [[Valpara\u00edso]], Chile.

These networks have frequent services, with frequencies varying from every 10 to every 30 minutes on most suburban lines, and up to 3\u20135 minutes in peak on bundled underground lines in the city centres of Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Melbourne. The networks in each state developed from mainline railways and have never been completely operationally separate from long distance and freight traffic, unlike [[Rapid transit|metro]] systems in some comparable countries, but nevertheless have cohesive identities and are the backbones of their respective cities' public transport system. The suburban networks are almost completely electrified.\n\nThe main suburban rail networks in Australia are:\n*The [[Railways in Sydney|Sydney rail network]] operated by [[Sydney Trains]] in [[Sydney]] (with connected suburban services in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and [[Wollongong]] run by its counterpart intercity operator, [[NSW TrainLink]]).\n*The [[Railways in Melbourne|Melbourne rail network]] operated by [[Metro Trains Melbourne]] in [[Melbourne]].\n*The [[Queensland Rail City network]] operated by [[Queensland Rail]] in [[Brisbane]].\n*[[Transperth Trains]] in [[Perth]].\n*The [[Railways in Adelaide|Adelaide rail network]] operated by [[Adelaide Metro]] in [[Adelaide]].\n\nNew Zealand has two frequent suburban rail services comparable to those in Australia: the [[Public transport in Auckland|Auckland rail network]] is operated by [[Transdev Auckland]] and the [[Public transport in the Wellington Region|Wellington rail network]] is operated by [[Transdev Wellington]].\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[List of suburban and commuter rail systems]]\n*[[Public transport]]\n*[[Commuting]]\n*[[Cercan\u00edas]], the commuter rail systems of Spain's major metropolitan areas\n*[[Commuter rail in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Commuter rail in North America]]\n*[[Commuter rail in Australia]]\n*[[S-Bahn]], the combined city center and suburban railway system metro in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Denmark\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070515131747/http://www.railserve.com/railnews/commuter_rail_transit.html Commuter Rail & Transit News] Current news concerning commuter rail development and issues\n\n{{Public transport}}\n{{Portal bar|Transport}}\n\n[[Category:Regional rail|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the [[Ti\u00ebsto]] song|Suburban Train/Urban Train}}\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2019}}[[File:DART Unit 8203.jpg|thumb|The [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]] is part of [[Dublin|Dublin's]] commuter rail network.

Its train services are transitioning from a peak direction commuter railway to a [[GO Transit Regional Express Rail|Regional Express Network]].]]\n\nMost commuter (or suburban) trains are built to main line rail standards,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} differing from [[light rail]] or [[rapid transit]] (metro rail)  systems by:\n*being larger\n*providing more seating and less standing room, owing to the longer distances involved\n*having (in most cases) a lower frequency of service\n*having scheduled services (i.e. trains run at specific times rather than at specific intervals)\n*serving lower-density suburban areas, typically connecting [[suburb]]s to the city center\n*sharing track or [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] with intercity or [[freight]] trains\n*not fully grade separated (containing at-grade crossings with crossing gates)\n*being able to skip certain stations as an express service due to normally being driver controlled\n\n===Train schedule===\nCompared to [[rapid transit]] (or metro rail), commuter/suburban rail often has lower [[headway|frequency]], following a schedule rather than fixed intervals, and fewer stations spaced further apart. They primarily serve lower density suburban areas (non inner-city), and often share [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] with intercity or [[freight]] trains. Some services operate only during peak hours and others uses fewer departures during off peak hours and weekends. Average speeds are high, often 50&nbsp;km/h (30&nbsp;mph) or higher. These higher speeds better serve the longer distances involved. Some services include express services which skip some stations in order to run faster and separate longer distance riders from short-distance ones.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe general range of commuter trains' distance varies between 15 and 200&nbsp;km (10 and 125 miles).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Sometimes long distances can be explained by that the train runs between two or several cities (e.g. S-Bahn in the [[Ruhr]] area of Germany). Distances between stations may vary, but are usually much longer than those of urban rail systems. In city centers the train either has a terminal station or passes through the city centre with notably fewer station stops than those of urban rail systems. Toilets are often available on-board trains and in stations.\n\n===Track===\nTheir ability to coexist with freight or intercity services in the same [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] can drastically reduce system construction costs. However, frequently they are built with dedicated tracks within that right-of-way to prevent delays, especially where service densities have converged in the inner parts of the network.\n\nMost such trains run on the [[List of track gauges|local standard gauge]] track. Some systems may run on a narrower or broader gauge. Examples of [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] systems are found in Japan, [[Kereta Commuter Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[KTM Komuter|Malaysia]], [[Greater Bangkok Commuter rail|Thailand]], Switzerland, in the [[Brisbane]] ([[Queensland Rail]]'s [[Queensland Rail City network|City network]]) and [[Perth]] ([[Transperth]]) systems in Australia, in some systems in Sweden, and on the [[:it:Ferrovia Genova-Casella|Genoa-Casella line]] in Italy. Some countries and regions, including [[Helsinki commuter rail|Finland]], India, Pakistan, [[Elektrichka|Russia]], Brazil and Sri Lanka, as well as [[San Francisco]] ([[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]]) in the US and [[Metro Trains Melbourne|Melbourne]] and [[Adelaide Metro|Adelaide]] in Australia, use [[broad gauge]] track.\n\n===Distinction between other modes of rail===\n\n====Metro====\nMetro rail or [[rapid transit]] usually covers a smaller inner-urban area ranging outwards to between 12&nbsp;km to 20&nbsp;km (or 8 to 14 miles), has a higher train frequency and runs on separate tracks (underground or elevated), whereas commuter rail often shares tracks, technology and the legal framework within mainline railway systems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nHowever, the classification as a metro or rapid rail can be difficult as both may typically cover a metropolitan area exclusively, run on separate tracks in the centre, and often feature purpose-built rolling stock. The fact that the terminology is not standardised across countries (even across English-speaking countries) further complicates matters. This distinction is most easily made when there are two (or more) systems such as New York's [[New York City Subway|subway]] and the [[Long Island Rail Road|LIRR]] and [[Metro-North Railroad]], Paris' [[Paris M\u00e9tro|M\u00e9tro]] and [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] along with [[Transilien]], London's tube lines of the [[London Underground|Underground]] and the [[London Overground|Overground]], (future) [[Crossrail]], [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]] along with other commuter rail [[Transport in London#Heavy rail|operators]], Madrid's [[Madrid Metro|Metro]] and [[Cercan\u00edas Madrid|Cercan\u00edas]], Barcelona's [[Barcelona Metro|Metro]] and [[Rodalies de Catalunya|Rodalies]], and Tokyo's [[Tokyo subway|subway]] and the [[East Japan Railway Company#Greater Tokyo Area|JR lines]] along with various privately owned and operated commuter rail systems.\n\n====S-Trains====\n\nAn [[S-Train]] is a type of hybrid [[urban rail|urban]]-[[suburban rail]] serving a [[metropolitan region]]. The most well-known S-train systems are the S-Bahn systems in Germany and Austria. Other well-known examples of S-train systems include the [[Copenhagen S-train|S-tog]] in [[Copenhagen]] and S-Bahn/RER systems in [[Switzerland]]. In Germany, the [[S-Bahn]] is regarded as a train category of its own, and exists in many large cities and in some other areas, with differing service and technical standards from city to city. \nMost S-Bahns typically behave like commuter rail with most trackage not separated from other trains, and long lines with trains running between cities and suburbs rather than within a city. The distances between stations however, are usually short. In larger systems there is usually a high frequency metro-like central corridor in the city center where all the lines converge into. Typical examples of large city S-Bahns include Munich and Frankfurt. S-Bahns also exist in some mid-size cities like Rostock and Magdeburg but behave more like typical commuter rail with lower frequencies and very little exclusive trackage. In [[Berlin]], the [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn systems]] arguably fulfill all considerations of a true metro system (despite the existence of [[U-Bahn]]s as well) \u2013 the trains run on tracks that are entirely separated from other trains, short distances between stations, high frequency and uses tunnels but do run a bit further out from the city centre, compared with U-Bahn. In Hamburg and Copenhagen, other, diesel driven trains, do continue where the S-Bahn ends (\"[[AKN Eisenbahn|A-Bahn]]\" in Hamburg area, and \"L-tog\" in Copenhagen).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n====Regional rail====\n[[Regional rail]] usually provides [[rail transport|rail services]] between towns and cities, rather than purely linking major population hubs in the way [[inter-city rail]] does. Regional rail operates outside major cities. Unlike Inter-city, it stops at most or all stations between cities. It provides a service between smaller communities along the line, and also connections with long-distance services at interchange stations located at junctions or at larger towns along the line. Alternative names are \"local train\" or \"stopping train\". Examples include the former [[British Rail|BR]]'s [[Regional Railways]], France's [[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]] (''Transport express r\u00e9gional''), Germany's [[DB Regio]] and South Korea's [[Tonggeun]] services.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nRegional rail does not exist in this sense in the United States, so the term \"regional rail\" has become synonymous with commuter rail there, although the two are more clearly defined in Europe.\n\n====Inter-city rail====\n{{see also|Inter-city rail}}\n[[File:Sydney Trains H22 OSCAR.jpg|thumb|A [[NSW TrainLink]] [[NSW TrainLink H set|H set]] at Sydney's [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central station]].]]\nIn some European countries the distinction between commuter trains and long-distance/intercity trains is very hard to make, because of the relatively short distances involved. For example, so-called \"[[Inter-city rail|intercity]]\" trains in Belgium and the Netherlands carry many commuters and their equipment, range and speeds are similar to those of commuter trains in some larger countries. In the United Kingdom there is no real division of organisation and brand name between commuter, regional and inter-city trains, making it hard to categorize train connections.\n\n[[Elektrichka|Russian commuter trains]], on the other hand, frequently cover areas larger than Belgium itself, although these are still short distances by Russian standards. They have a different ticketing system from long-distance trains, and in major cities they often operate from a separate section of the train station.\n\nThe easiest way to identify these \"inter-city\" services is that they tend to operate as express services - only linking the main stations in the cities they link, not stopping at any other stations. However, this term is used in Australia (Sydney for example) to describe the regional trains operating beyond the boundaries of the suburban services, even though some of these \"inter-city\" services stop all stations similar to German regional services. In this regard, the German service delineations and corresponding naming conventions are clearer and better used for academic purposes.\n\n====High-speed rail====\nSometimes [[high-speed rail]] can serve daily use of commuters. The Japanese [[Shinkansen]] high speed rail system is heavily used by commuters in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]]. They commute between 100 and 200&nbsp;km by [[Shinkansen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-high-speed-rail-development-worldwide|title=Fact Sheet: High Speed Rail Development Worldwide {{!}} White Papers {{!}} EESI|website=www.eesi.org|access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref> To meet the demand of commuters, [[Japan Railways Group|JR]] sells commuter discount passes and operates 16-car [[bilevel car|bilevel]] [[E4 Series Shinkansen]] trains at rush hour, providing a capacity of 1,600 seats. Several lines in China, such as the [[Beijing\u2013Tianjin Intercity Railway]] and the [[Shanghai\u2013Nanjing High-Speed Railway]], serve a similar role with many more under construction or planned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shine.cn/news/metro/1806116099/|title=Metro closes the gap with areas across the border - SHINE|website=SHINE|language=en|access-date=2018-06-23}}</ref>\n\nThe high-speed services linking [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Bern]] and [[Basel]] in [[Switzerland]] ({{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}) have brought the Central Business Districts (CBDs) of these three cities within 1 hour of each other. This has resulted in unexpectedly high demand for new commuter trips between the three cities and a corresponding increase in suburban rail passengers accessing the high-speed services at the main city-centre stations (or Hauptbahnhof). The [[Regional-Express]] commuter service between [[Munich]] and [[Nuremberg]] in Germany go in ({{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}) along a [[Nuremberg\u2013Munich high-speed railway|300 km/h high-speed line]].\n\nThe regional trains [[Stockholm]]\u2013[[Uppsala]], Stockholm\u2013[[V\u00e4ster\u00e5s]], Stockholm\u2013[[Eskilstuna]] and [[Gothenburg]]\u2013[[Trollh\u00e4ttan]] in [[Sweden]] reach {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}} and have many daily commuters.\n\n==Train types==\nCommuter/suburban trains are usually optimized for maximum passenger volume, in most cases without sacrificing too much comfort and [[luggage]] space, though they seldom have all the amenities of long-distance trains. Cars may be single- or [[bilevel car|double-level]], and aim to provide seating for all. Compared to intercity trains, they have less space, fewer amenities and limited baggage areas.\n\n===Multiple unit type===\n\nCommuter rail trains are usually composed of [[multiple unit]]s, which are self-propelled, bidirectional, articulated passenger rail cars with driving motors on each (or every other) [[bogie]]. Depending on local circumstances and tradition they may be powered either by [[diesel engines]] located below the passenger compartment ([[diesel multiple unit]]s) or by electricity picked up from [[third rail]]s or [[overhead lines]] ([[electric multiple unit]]s). Multiple units are almost invariably equipped with control cabs at both ends, which is why such units are so frequently used to provide commuter services, due to the associated short turn-around time.\n\n===Locomotive hauled services===\n[[File:ACE EMD F40PH Fremont - San Jose.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Altamont Corridor Express]] train operating along the [[San Francisco Bay]]; a MPI F40PH-2C locomotive hauls a consist of Bombardier Bi-Level VI coaches.]]\nLocomotive hauled services are used in some countries or locations. This is often a case of [[Business operations|asset sweating]], by using a single large combined fleet for intercity and regional services. Loco hauled services are usually run in [[Push-pull train|push-pull]] formation, that is, the train can run with the locomotive at the \"front\" or \"rear\" of the train (pushing or pulling). Trains are often equipped with a control cab at the other end of the train from the locomotive, allowing the train operator to operate the train from either end. The motive power for locomotive-hauled commuter trains may be either electric or [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]], although some countries, such as Germany and some of the former Soviet-bloc countries, also use diesel-hydraulic locomotives.\n\n=== Seat plans ===\nIn the US and some other countries, a three-and-two seat plan is used. However, few people sit in the middle seat on these trains because they feel crowded and uncomfortable.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/31/nyregion/for-train-riders-middle-seat-isnt-the-center-of-attention.html|title=For Train Riders, Middle Seat Isn't the Center of Attention|first=Patrick|last=McGeehan|date=31 May 2005|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/06/opinion/on-the-802-express-threes-a-crowd-139947.html|title=On the 8:02 Express, Three's a Crowd|date=6 June 2005|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nIn Japan and South Korea, longitudinal (sideways window-lining) seating is widely used in many commuter rail trains to increase capacity in rush hours. Carriages are usually not organized to increase [[seating capacity]] (although in some trains at least one carriage would feature more doors to facilitate easier boarding and alighting and bench seats so that they can be folded up during rush hour to provide more standing room) even in the case of commuting longer than 50&nbsp;km and commuters in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]] and the [[Seoul metropolitan area]] have to stand in the train for more than an hour.\n\n==Commuter rail systems around the world==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}\n\n===Africa===\n{{See also|Template:Suburban railways in Africa}}\n[[File:Kalk Bay Station 3.jpg|thumb|A [[Metrorail (South Africa)|Metrorail]] train pulling out of [[Kalk Bay]] station in [[Cape Town]]]]\nCurrently there are not many examples of commuter rail in Africa. [[Metrorail (South Africa)|Metrorail]] operates in the major cities of South Africa, and there are some commuter rail services in Algeria, Botswana, Kenya, Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia.\nIn Algeria, [[SNTF]] operates commuter rail lines between the capital [[Algiers]] and its southern and eastern suburbs. They also serve to connect [[Algiers]]' main [[University of Science and Technology, Houari Boumediene|universities]] to each other. The [[Dar es Salaam commuter rail]] offers intracity services in [[Dar es Salaam]], Tanzania. In Botswana, the ([[Botswana Railways]]) \"BR Express\" has a commuter train between [[Lobatse]] and [[Gaborone]].\n\n===Asia===\n\n====East Asia====\n[[File:Tokyo Metro 16000 Series 16111f Semi Express.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Tokyo Metro 16000 series]] train operating a through service on the [[JR East]] [[Joban Line]], an example of high-density commuter rail in Japan.]]\n\nIn Japan, commuter rail systems have extensive network and frequent service and are heavily used. In many cases, Japanese commuter rail is operationally more like a typical metro system (with very high operating frequencies, an emphasis on [[standing passenger]]s, short station spacing) than it is like commuter rail in other countries. Japanese commuter rail also tends to be heavily interlined with subway lines, with commuter rail trains continuing into the subway network, and then out onto different commuter rail systems on the other side of the city.  Many Japanese commuter systems operate several levels of express trains to reduce the travel time to distant locations, often using station bypass tracks instead of dedicated express tracks. It is notable that the larger Japanese commuter rail systems are owned and operated by for-profit [[private railway]] companies, without public subsidy.\n\nCommuter rail systems have been inaugurated in several cities in China such as [[Beijing Suburban Railway|Beijing]], [[Jinshan Railway|Shanghai]], [[Central Plain Metropolitan Intercity Rail|Zhengzhou]], [[Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway|Wuhan]], [[Changsha\u2013Zhuzhou\u2013Xiangtan Intercity Railway|Changsha]] and the [[Pearl River Delta Rapid Transit|Pearl River Delta]]. With plans for large systems in northeastern [[Zhejiang]], [[Jingjinji]], and [[Yangtze River Delta]] areas. The level of service varies considerably from line to line ranging [[high speed rail|high]] to near high speeds. More developed and established lines such as the [[Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen Railway|Guangshen Railway]] have more frequent metro like service. Hong Kong [[MTR]]'s [[East Rail Line]], [[West Rail Line]] and [[Tung Chung Line]] were built to commuter rail standards but are operated as a metro system.\n\nIn Taiwan, [[West Coast line (Taiwan)|Western Line]] in [[Taipei]]-[[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan]] Metropolitan Area, [[Taichung]] Metropolitan Area, [[Tainan]]-[[Kaohsiung]] Metropolitan Area as well as [[Neiwan Line|Neiwan]]-[[Liujia Line]] in [[Hsinchu]] Area is considered commuter rail.\n\nOther examples in East Asia include [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]] of which some lines are suburban lines operated by [[Korail]] in South Korea.\n\n====Southeast Asia====\n[[File:Commuterline at Palmerah Station 4.JPG|thumb|right|Electric multiple unit of [[KA Commuter Jabodetabek|KRL Commuterline]] [[KA Commuter Line Tanah Abang-Maja|Serpong Line]] train at Palmerah Station, [[Jakarta]]]]\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], the [[KRL Commuterline]] is the largest commuter rail system in the country, serving [[Jabodetabek|Jakarta metropolitan area]]. It connects the [[Jakarta]] city center with surrounding cities and sub-urbans in [[Banten]] and [[West Java]] provinces, including [[Depok]], [[Bogor]], [[Tangerang]], [[Bekasi]], Serpong and Maja. In July 2015, KA Commuter Jabodetabek served more than 850,000 passengers per day, which is almost triple of the 2011 figures, but still less than 3.5% of all Jabodetabek commutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2015/07/06/14142481/PT.KCJ.Keterlambatan.KRL.Sudah.di.Bawah.10.Menit |title=PT KCJ: Keterlambatan KRL Sudah di Bawah 10 Menit |date=July 6, 2015}}</ref> Other commuter rail systems in Indonesia include the [[Metro Surabaya Commuter Line]], Prambanan Ekspres Commuter, Solo Ekspres, Kedung Sepur, Greater Bandung Commuter, and Cut Meutia.\n\nIn the Philippines, the [[Philippine National Railways]] has two commuter rail systems currently operational; the [[PNR Metro Commuter Line]] in the [[Greater Manila Area]] and the [[PNR Bicol Commuter]] in the [[Bicol Region]]. A new commuter rail line in Metro Manila, the [[North\u2013South Commuter Railway]], is currently under construction. Its North section is set to be partially opened by 2021.\n\nIn Malaysia, the [[KTM Komuter]] serves [[Kuala Lumpur]] and the surrounding [[Klang Valley|Klang Valley area]].\n\nIn Thailand, the [[Greater Bangkok Commuter rail]] and the [[Airport Rail Link (Bangkok)|Airport Rail Link]] serve the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]]. The [[SRT Red Lines]], a new commuter line in Bangkok, started construction in 2009. It is currently slated to be opened by 2020.\n\nAnother commuter rail system in Southeast Asia is the [[Yangon Circular Railway]] in [[Myanmar]].\n\n====South Asia====\nIn India, commuter rail systems are present in major cities. [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]], the oldest suburban rail system in Asia, carries more than 7.24 million commuters on a daily basis which constitutes more than half of the total daily passenger capacity of the Indian Railways itself. [[Kolkata Suburban Railway]] is the biggest Suburban Railway network in India covering 348 stations carries more than 3.5 million commuters per day. The [[Chennai Suburban Railway]] along with [[Chennai MRTS|MRTS]] is another railway of comparison where more than 1 million people travel daily to different areas in [[Chennai]]. Other commuter railways in India include [[Hyderabad MMTS]], [[Delhi Suburban Railway]], [[Pune Suburban Railway]] and [[Lucknow-Kanpur Suburban Railway]].\n\nDelhi Regional Rapid Transit System(RRTS) is under construction on 3 routes in [[National Capital Region|Delhi NCR]].The rotes have planned according to  [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] suburban lines in [[Paris]].\n\n==== West Asia ====\nIn Iran, SYSTRA has done a \"Tehran long term urban rail study\". SYSTRA proposed 4 express lines similar to [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] suburban lines in [[Paris]]. [[Tehran Metro]] is going to construct express lines. For instance, the Rahyab Behineh, a consultant for Tehran Metro, is studying Tehran Express Line 2. Tehran Metro currently has a commuter line between [[Tehran]] and [[Karaj]]. [[Isfahan]] has two lines to its suburbs [[Baharestan]] and [[Fuladshahr]] under construction, and a third line to [[Shahinshahr]] is planned.\n\n===Europe===\n{{Main|R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|Commuter rail in the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:Ny pendeltag stockholm.jpg|thumb|right|Type [[SL X60|X60]] at Stockholm Central in Sweden]]\nMajor metropolitan areas in most European countries are usually served by extensive commuter/suburban rail systems. Well-known examples include [[BG Voz]] in [[Belgrade]] (Serbia), [[S-Bahn]] in Germany and German-speaking areas of Switzerland and Austria, [[Proastiakos]] in Greece, [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] in France and Belgium, [[Milan suburban railway service|suburban lines]] in [[Milan]] (Italy), [[Cercan\u00edas]] and [[Rodalies de Catalunya|Rodalies]] ([[Catalonia]]) in Spain, [[CP Urban Services]] in Portugal, [[Esko Prague|Esko]] in [[Prague]] and [[Ostrava]] (Czech Republic), [[H\u00c9V]] in [[Budapest]] (Hungary) and [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]] in [[Dublin]] (Ireland).\n\nIn Russia, Ukraine and some other countries of the former [[Soviet Union]], electrical multiple unit passenger suburban trains called [[Elektrichka]] are widespread.\n\nIn Sweden, electrified commuter rail systems known as ''Pendelt\u00e5g'' are present in the cities of [[Stockholm]] and [[Gothenburg]]. The [[Stockholm commuter rail]] system, which began in 1968, is similar to the S-Bahn train systems of Munich and Frankfurt such that it may share railway tracks with inter-city trains and freight trains, but for the most part run on its own dedicated tracks, and that it is primarily used to transport passengers from nearby towns and other suburban areas into the city centre, not for transportation inside the city centre. The [[Gothenburg commuter rail]] system, which began in 1960, is similar to the Stockholm system, but does fully share tracks with long-distance trains. Other train systems that are also considered as commuter rail but not counted as ''pendelt\u00e5g'' include [[Roslagsbanan]] and [[Saltsj\u00f6banan]] in Stockholm, [[M\u00e4lart\u00e5g]] in the [[M\u00e4laren Valley]], [[\u00d6stg\u00f6tapendeln]] in [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland County]], [[Uppt\u00e5get]] in [[Uppsala County]], [[Norrt\u00e5g]] in northern [[Norrland]] and [[Sk\u00e5ne Commuter Rail]] in [[Sk\u00e5ne County]]. Sk\u00e5ne Commuter Rail (''P\u00e5gat\u00e5gen'') acts also as a regional rail system, as it serves cities over 100&nbsp;km (62 miles) and over one hour from the principal city of [[Malm\u00f6]].\n\nIn Norway, the [[Oslo Commuter Rail|Oslo commuter rail]] system mostly shares tracks with more long-distance trains, but also runs on some local railways without other traffic. Oslo has the largest commuter rail system in the Nordic countries in terms of line lengths and number of stations. But some lines have travel times (over an hour from Oslo) and frequencies (once per hour) which are more like regional trains. Also [[Bergen Commuter Rail|Bergen]], [[J\u00e6ren Commuter Rail|Stavanger]] and [[Tr\u00f8nderbanen|Trondheim]] have commuter rail systems. These have only one or two lines each and they share tracks with other trains.\n\nIn [[Finland]], the [[Helsinki commuter rail]] network runs on dedicated tracks from [[Helsinki Central railway station]] to [[Lepp\u00e4vaara railway station|Lepp\u00e4vaara]] and [[Kerava]]. The [[Ring Rail Line]] serves [[Helsinki Airport]] and northern suburbs of [[Vantaa]] and is exclusively used by the commuter rail network. On 15 December 2019 Tampere got its own commuter rail service.\n\nIn Poland, commuter rail systems exist in [[Szybka Kolej Miejska (Tricity)|Tricity]], [[Szybka Kolej Miejska (Warsaw)|Warsaw]], [[Krakow]] and [[Katowice]]. There is also a similar system planned in [[Wroc\u0142aw]] and [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]].\n\nIn Romania, the first commuter trains were introduced in December 2019. They operate currently between [[Bucharest]] and Funduea or [[Buftea]].\n\n===Americas===\n====North and Central America====\n{{Main|Commuter rail in North America}}\n[[File:Metrolink F59PHI 885.jpg|thumb|Metrolink provides commuter rail service to six counties in Southern California.]]\nIn the United States, Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Mexico regional passenger rail services are provided by governmental or quasi-governmental agencies, with a limited number of metropolitan areas served.\n\nEight commuter rail systems in the United States carried over ten million trips in 2018:{{Fix|text=which eight out of this list?}}\n* [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]'s [[Long Island Rail Road]], serving [[New York City]] and [[Long Island]]\n* [[NJ Transit Rail Operations]], serving New York City, New Jersey ([[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]]) and [[Philadelphia]]\n* Metropolitan Transportation Authority's [[Metro-North Railroad]], serving New York ([[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]] and New York City) and Southwest Connecticut ([[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]])\n* [[Metra]], serving northeast Illinois ([[Chicago]]), [[Northern Indiana]], and [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]\n* [[SEPTA Regional Rail]], serving southeast Pennsylvania (Philadelphia), as well as [[Wilmington, Delaware]], and [[Trenton, New Jersey]]\n* [[Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority]], serving Massachusetts (Boston, [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]]) and [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]]\n* [[Caltrain]], serving California ([[San Francisco]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], and the [[San Francisco Peninsula]])\n* [[Metrolink (California)|Metrolink]], serving California ([[Los Angeles]], [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], and [[Southern California]])\n*[[Utah Transit Authority]] [[FrontRunner]], serving Utah ([[Wasatch Front]])\n*[[North County Transit District]] [[Coaster (San Diego)|Coaster]], serving California ([[San Diego County]])\n*[[Maryland Area Regional Commuter]], serving [[Maryland]] ([[Baltimore]]) and [[Washington, D.C.]]\n*[[Regional Transportation District]], serving [[Colorado]] ([[Denver]])\n*[[Virginia Railway Express]], serving suburbs of [[Northern Virginia]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]\n*[[Sounder commuter rail]], serving [[Washington (state)|Washington]] ([[Seattle]] / [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]])\n*[[Tri-Rail]], serving [[Florida]] ([[Miami]] / [[Fort Lauderdale]] / [[West Palm Beach]])\n*[[Trinity Railway Express]], serving [[Texas]] ([[Dallas]] / [[Fort Worth]])\n*[[Altamont Corridor Express]], serving [[California]] ([[San Jose, California|San Jose]] / [[Stockton, California|Stockton]])\n*[[SunRail]], serving [[Florida]] ([[Orlando]]/[[Poinciana, Florida|Poinciana]])\n*[[WES Commuter Rail]], serving [[Oregon]] ([[Beaverton, Oregon|Beverton]]/[[willsonville, Oregon|Willsonville]])\n*[[New Mexico Rail Runner Express]], serving [[New Mexico]] ([[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]])\n*[[Northstar Line]], serving [[Minnesota]] ([[Big Lake, Minnesota|Big Lake]] and downtown [[Minneapolis]])\n*[[Capital MetroRail]], serving [[Texas]] ([[Austin]])\n*[[A-train (Denton County)|A-train]],serving [[Texas]] ([[Denton County]])\n*[[Sonoma\u2013Marin Area Rail Transit|SMART]], serving [[California]] ([[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma]] and [[Marin County, California|Marin]] counties)\n*[[Music City Star]], serving [[Nashville]] and [[Lebanon, Tennessee]].\n\nNorth American commuter rail systems outside of the United States include:\n* [[GO Transit rail services]] in [[Toronto]]\n* [[Exo (public transit)|Exo]] in [[Montreal]]\n* [[West Coast Express]] in [[Vancouver]]\n* [[Suburban Railway of the Valley of Mexico Metropolitan Area]] serving [[Mexico City]]\n* [[Toluca-M\u00e9xico City commuter line]] serving [[Toluca]] and [[Mexico City]]\n\n===Central America===\n*[[Rail Transport in Honduras|City Rail]] serving [[La Ceiba]]\n*[[Rail Transport in El Salvador|San Salvador Suburban Rail]] serving [[San Salvador]] and [[Santa Ana, El Salvador|Santa Ana]]\n*[[Tren Urbano de Costa Rica|Rail Transport in Costa Rica]] serving [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jose]]\n\n====South America====\n[[File:EMU CSR M20 en Barrancas.jpg|thumb|The [[Mitre Line]] is part of the extensive [[Rail transport in Argentina#Commuter networks|Buenos Aires metropolitan rail system]].]]\nExamples include an {{convert|899|km|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} commuter system in the [[Rail transport in Argentina#Commuter networks|Buenos Aires metropolitan area]], the {{convert|225|km|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} long [[Supervia]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the [[Metrotr\u00e9n]] in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]], and the [[Valpara\u00edso Metro]] in [[Valpara\u00edso]], Chile.

These networks have frequent services, with frequencies varying from every 10 to every 30 minutes on most suburban lines, and up to 3\u20135 minutes in peak on bundled underground lines in the city centres of Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Melbourne. The networks in each state developed from mainline railways and have never been completely operationally separate from long distance and freight traffic, unlike [[Rapid transit|metro]] systems in some comparable countries, but nevertheless have cohesive identities and are the backbones of their respective cities' public transport system. The suburban networks are almost completely electrified.\n\nThe main suburban rail networks in Australia are:\n*The [[Railways in Sydney|Sydney rail network]] operated by [[Sydney Trains]] in [[Sydney]] (with connected suburban services in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and [[Wollongong]] run by its counterpart intercity operator, [[NSW TrainLink]]).\n*The [[Railways in Melbourne|Melbourne rail network]] operated by [[Metro Trains Melbourne]] in [[Melbourne]].\n*The [[Queensland Rail City network]] operated by [[Queensland Rail]] in [[Brisbane]].\n*[[Transperth Trains]] in [[Perth]].\n*The [[Railways in Adelaide|Adelaide rail network]] operated by [[Adelaide Metro]] in [[Adelaide]].\n\nNew Zealand has two frequent suburban rail services comparable to those in Australia: the [[Public transport in Auckland|Auckland rail network]] is operated by [[Transdev Auckland]] and the [[Public transport in the Wellington Region|Wellington rail network]] is operated by [[Transdev Wellington]].\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[List of suburban and commuter rail systems]]\n*[[Public transport]]\n*[[Commuting]]\n*[[Cercan\u00edas]], the commuter rail systems of Spain's major metropolitan areas\n*[[Commuter rail in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Commuter rail in North America]]\n*[[Commuter rail in Australia]]\n*[[S-Bahn]], the combined city center and suburban railway system metro in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Denmark\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070515131747/http://www.railserve.com/railnews/commuter_rail_transit.html Commuter Rail & Transit News] Current news concerning commuter rail development and issues\n\n{{Public transport}}\n{{Portal bar|Transport}}\n\n[[Category:Regional rail|*]]\n", "name_user": "Hanif Al Husaini", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSoutheast Asia:Add link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuter_rail"}

This state of the eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse, but aided perhaps by natural selection. In South America, a burrowing rodent, the tuco-tuco, or [[Ctenomys]], is even more subterranean in its habits than the mole; and I was assured by a Spaniard, who had often caught them, that they were frequently blind. One which I kept alive was certainly in this condition, the cause, as appeared on dissection, having been inflammation of the nictitating membrane. As frequent inflammation of the eyes must be injurious to any animal, and as eyes are certainly not necessary to animals having subterranean habits, a reduction in their size, with the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them, might in such case be an advantage; and if so, natural selection would aid the effects of disuse.

This is called [[economical adaptation]]. However, studies have shown that blind cave fish embryos begin to grow eyes during development but then something actively stops this process and flesh grows over the partially grown eyes. Another theory is that some Mexican tetra randomly don't develop eyes (which is represented by broken genes in the fish's genome), and this lack of eyes spreads to the rest of the population despite having no advantage or disadvantage. This is called the [[unified neutral theory of biodiversity]].\n\nIn one experiment studying eye development, [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] scientists transplanted [[lens (anatomy)|lens]]es from the eyes of sighted surface-form [[embryo]]s into blind cave-form embryos, and vice versa.  In the cave form, lens development begins within the first 24 hours of embryonic development, but quickly aborts, the lens cells dying; most of the rest of the eye structures never develop.  Researchers found that the lens seemed to control the development of the rest of the eye, as the surface-form tetras which received cave-form lenses failed to develop eyes, while cave-form tetras which received surface-form lenses grew eyes with [[pupil]]s, [[cornea]]s, and [[iris (anatomy)|iris]]es.

This state of the eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse, but aided perhaps by natural selection. In South America, a burrowing rodent, the tuco-tuco, or [[Ctenomys]], is even more subterranean in its habits than the mole; and I was assured by a Spaniard, who had often caught them, that they were frequently blind. One which I kept alive was certainly in this condition, the cause, as appeared on dissection, having been inflammation of the nictitating membrane. As frequent inflammation of the eyes must be injurious to any animal, and as eyes are certainly not necessary to animals having subterranean habits, a reduction in their size, with the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them, might in such case be an advantage; and if so, natural selection would aid the effects of disuse.

This is called [[economical adaptation]]. However, studies have shown that blind cave fish embryos begin to grow eyes during development but then something actively stops this process and flesh grows over the partially grown eyes. Another theory is that some Mexican tetra randomly don't develop eyes (which is represented by broken genes in the fish's genome), and this lack of eyes spreads to the rest of the population despite having no advantage or disadvantage. This is called the [[unified neutral theory of biodiversity]].\n\nIn one experiment studying eye development, [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] scientists transplanted [[lens (anatomy)|lens]]es from the eyes of sighted surface-form [[embryo]]s into blind cave-form embryos, and vice versa.  In the cave form, lens development begins within the first 24 hours of embryonic development, but quickly aborts, the lens cells dying; most of the rest of the eye structures never develop.  Researchers found that the lens seemed to control the development of the rest of the eye, as the surface-form tetras which received cave-form lenses failed to develop eyes, while cave-form tetras which received surface-form lenses grew eyes with [[pupil]]s, [[cornea]]s, and [[iris (anatomy)|iris]]es.

Donkey Kong first made his appearance in the 1981 arcade machine called ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', in which he faced Jumpman ([[Mario]]), now Nintendo's flagship character. This game was also the first appearance of Mario, pre-dating the well-known ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' by four years. In 1994, the series was revived as the ''[[Donkey Kong Country (series)|Donkey Kong Country]]''  series, featuring Donkey Kong and his clan of other [[apes]] as [[protagonists]] in their native jungle setting versus a variety of [[anthropomorphic]] enemies, usually against the [[Kremlings]], a clan of crocodiles, and their leader [[King K. Rool]]. These are [[side-scrolling]] [[platform game]]s. Titles outside these two genres have included rhythm games (''[[Donkey Konga]]''), racing games (''[[Diddy Kong Racing]]''), and edutainment (''[[Donkey Kong Jr. Math]]'').\n\nA hallmark of the ''Donkey Kong'' franchise is [[barrel]]s, which the Kongs use as weapons, vehicles, furniture, and lodging. The Donkey Kong character is highly recognizable and very popular; the franchise has sold over 40 million units worldwide.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060907213926/http://press.nintendo.com/object?id=7657]</ref>\n\n== Characters ==\n{{main|List of Donkey Kong characters}}\n\n[[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] first appeared in the eponymous arcade game in 1981 as the opponent.  He would become the [[player character]] in later games. [[Donkey Kong Jr. (character)|Donkey Kong Jr.]] first appeared in the arcade style game ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'' released in 1982. The plot was that Donkey Kong Jr. saves his father, Donkey Kong, from [[Mario]]  (initially known as Jumpman in the Japanese arcade version of ''Donkey Kong''). [[Cranky Kong]] is the original Donkey Kong who has alternately been called the modern DK's grandfather and father.<ref>''Donkey Kong Country'' instruction manual</ref> He is elderly and frequently berates the younger generation of heroes. [[Diddy Kong]] was first introduced in ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' and is featured in ''[[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest]]'' as the main character. [[Dixie Kong]] first appeared in ''Donkey Kong Country 2'' as a sidekick to Diddy Kong and has been referred to as his girlfriend. She later starred in ''[[Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble]]'' alongside [[Kiddy Kong]]. Other notable members of the Kong family include [[Funky Kong]], [[Candy Kong]], [[Wrinkly Kong]], [[Tiny Kong]], and [[Lanky Kong]]. [[King K. Rool]] is the main antagonist of the ''Donkey Kong'' series, though additional villains have appeared as well, including [[Wizpig]] (''[[Diddy Kong Racing]]''), [[List of Donkey Kong characters#Evil Kings|Ghastly King]] (''[[Donkey Kong Jungle Beat]]''), the [[List of Donkey Kong characters#Tiki Tak Tribe|Tiki Tak Tribe]] (''[[Donkey Kong Country Returns]]''), and the [[List of Donkey Kong characters#Snowmads|Snowmads]] (''[[Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze]]'').\n\nCharacters from the ''Donkey Kong'' series have appeared in Nintendo's crossover titles such as the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' and the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series.\n\n== Games ==\n{{main|List of Donkey Kong video games}}\n{{Video game timeline\n| range1 = 1981 \u2013\n| range1_color = #d66300 #914200\n| summary = A timeline of releases in the main Donkey Kong game series, from the first in 1981 to present.\n|1981 = '''''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'''''\n|1982 = '''''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'''''\n|1983a= ''[[List of LCD games featuring Mario#Donkey Kong II|Donkey Kong II]]''\n|1983b = '''''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'''''\n|1983c = ''[[Donkey Kong Jr. Math]]''\n|1988 = ''[[Donkey Kong Classics]]'' (NES)\n|1994a = '''''[[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|Donkey Kong]]''''' (GB)\n|1994b = '''''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'''''\n|1995a = ''[[Donkey Kong Land]]''\n|1995b = '''''[[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest|Donkey Kong Country 2]]'''''\n|1996a = ''[[Donkey Kong Land 2]]''\n|1996b = '''''[[Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!|Donkey Kong Country 3]]'''''\n|1997a = ''[[Donkey Kong Land III]]''\n|1997b = ''[[Diddy Kong Racing]]''\n|1999 = '''''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'''''\n|2003 = ''[[Donkey Konga]]''\n|2004a = ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong (video game)|Mario vs. Donkey Kong]]''\n|2004b = ''[[Donkey Konga 2]]''\n|2004c = '''''[[Donkey Kong Jungle Beat]]'''''\n|2005a = ''[[Donkey Konga 3]]''\n|2005b = ''[[DK King of Swing|DK: King of Swing]]''\n|2006 = ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis]]''\n|2007a = ''[[Diddy Kong Racing|Diddy Kong Racing DS]]''\n|2007b = ''[[Donkey Kong Barrel Blast]]''\n|2007c = ''[[DK Jungle Climber|DK: Jungle Climber]]''\n|2009 = ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again!]]''\n|2010a = ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Mini-Land Mayhem!]]''\n|2010b = '''''[[Donkey Kong Country Returns]]'''''\n|2013 = ''[[Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move]]''\n|2014 = '''''[[Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze]]'''''\n|2015 = ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars]]''\n}}\n\n[[Image:Donkey Kong NES Screenshot.png|200px|thumb|left|The original ''Donkey Kong'' video game running on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]]]\n\n=== Original series ===\n;''Donkey Kong'':\nThe original arcade ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' game was created when [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] was assigned by [[Nintendo]] to convert ''[[Radar Scope]]'', a game that had been released to test audiences with poor results, into a game that would appeal more to Americans. The result was a major breakthrough for Nintendo and for the videogame industry. Sales of the machine were brisk, with the game becoming one of the best-selling arcade machines of the early 1980s. The gameplay itself was a large improvement over other games of its time, and with the growing base of arcades to sell to, it was able to gain huge distribution. In the game, 'Jumpman' (the character would later become Mario) must ascend a construction site while avoiding obstacles such as barrels and fireballs to rescue Pauline, his girlfriend,  from Donkey Kong. Miyamoto created a greatly simplified version for the [[Game & Watch]] multiscreen. Other ports include the [[Atari 2600]], [[Colecovision]], [[Amiga 500]], [[Apple II family|Apple II]], [[Atari 7800]], [[Intellivision]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore VIC-20]], [[Famicom Disk System]], [[IBM PC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[MSX]], [[Atari 8-bit family]] and Mini-Arcade versions. The game was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] in 1983 as one of the system's three [[launch title]]s; the same version was a launch title for the Famicom's North American version, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Both ''Donkey Kong'' and its sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'', are included in the 1988 NES compilation ''Donkey Kong Classics''. The NES version was re-released as an unlockable game in Donkey Kong 64 for the Nintendo 64, ''[[Animal Crossing (video game)|Animal Crossing]]'' for the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]]{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} and as an item for purchase on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/virtual-console-lineup-unveiled|title=Wii Virtual Console Lineup Unveiled|last=Parish|first=Jeremy|date=31 October 2006|website=[[1UP.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603233125/http://www.1up.com/news/virtual-console-lineup-unveiled|archivedate=3 June 2011}}</ref> The original arcade version of the game appears in the [[Nintendo 64]] game ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]''.

Additionally, in these games collecting puzzle pieces unlocks artwork from the games. In ''Tropical Freeze'', the Kongs are able to pluck items from the ground and pick up and throw stunned enemies. Additionally, filling up a 'Kong-POW' meter allows Donkey Kong and his partner to perform a special move which defeats all on-screen enemies and converts them into items depending on the partner.<ref>{{cite news |title=Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze rewards its most thorough players |author=Griffin McElroy |url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/11/4412408/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-hands-on-preview |newspaper=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=June 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Fahey|first=Mike|title=The Furry New Donkey Kong Yanks A Gimmick From Super Mario Bros. 2|url=http://kotaku.com/the-furry-new-donkey-kong-yanks-a-gimmick-from-super-ma-513016998|website=Kotaku}}</ref>\n\nIn the original trilogy, the player can switch between characters if they are both on the screen. This is changed in the [[Retro Studios]] games, where the player has to choose character(s) before each level. Starting with ''Donkey Kong Country Returns'', each character has their own specific characteristics: Donkey is the larger and stronger of the two, and can defeat enemies more easily, while Diddy is faster and more agile, but not as powerful, and can use his barrel jetpack to glide the air over short distances and his peanut gun to stun enemies.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> ''Tropical Freeze'' marked the debut of Dixie Kong, [[Cranky Kong]], and [[Funky Kong]]  as playable characters in the Retro Studios era. Dixie, returning from ''Donkey Kong Country 3'', can spin her ponytail into a propeller and slowly descend through the air, with an initial boost in height at the start, allowing her and Donkey Kong to fly up out-of-reach platforms or items, and can also use her candy gun to stun enemies. Cranky, in a similar mechanic to the ''[[DuckTales (video game)|DuckTales]]'' video game, can use his cane to bounce on dangerous surfaces such as spiky thorns and reach higher areas and defeat certain enemies the other Kongs cannot.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schulenberg|first=Thomas|title=Cranky Kong brandishes cane, joins Donkey Kong: Tropical Freeze roster on February 21|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/12/07/cranky-kong-brandishes-cane-joins-donkey-kong-tropical-freeze/|publisher=Joystiq}}</ref> Funky is featured as a playable character in the [[Nintendo Switch]] port of ''Tropical Freeze'', functioning similarly to Donkey Kong but with additional hit points, an extra jump, and the ability to stand on spikes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-port-of-donkey-kong-country-tropic/1100-6456037/|title=Nintendo Switch Port Of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze Announced With Release Date|website=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=CBS Interactive|last1=Dayus|first1=Oscar|date=January 12, 2018|accessdate=January 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Donkey Kong Land'' series ====\nThe ''Donkey Kong Land'' games were handheld counterparts of the ''Country'' games adapted to the hardware of the [[Game Boy]]. ''[[Donkey Kong Land]]'' was released in 1995, ''[[Donkey Kong Land 2]]'' in 1996 and ''[[Donkey Kong Land III]]'' in 1997. They were presented in distinctive yellow cartridges instead of the typical grey ones. A port of ''Donkey Kong Country'' was released for the [[Game Boy Color]] in 2000, featuring mini-games and an exclusive new level. Following the success of the ''Donkey Kong Land'' series and the GBC port of ''Donkey Kong Country'', ports of the original trilogy were released for the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2003,<ref>{{cite web|title=NOA clarifies release dates|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/article_47593|website=[[Eurogamer]]|author=Bramwell, Tom|date=March 20, 2003|accessdate=October 10, 2019}}</ref> 2004,<ref>{{cite web|title=Nintendo announces date for GBA Donkey Kong Country 2|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news120304dkc2|website=[[Eurogamer]]|author=Bramwell, Tom|date=March 12, 2004|accessdate=October 10, 2019}}</ref> and 2005,<ref>{{cite web|title=Nintendo's Christmas line-up|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news190805nintyxmas|website=[[Eurogamer]]|author=GamesIndustry International, Contributor|date=August 19, 2005|accessdate=October 10, 2019}}</ref> and a [[Donkey_Kong_Country_Returns#Donkey_Kong_Country_Returns_3D|handheld port]] of ''Donkey Kong Country Returns'' was released for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D release date swings in|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-15-donkey-kong-country-returns-3d-release-date|website=[[Eurogamer]]|author=Phillips, Tom|date=March 18, 2013|accessdate=October 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Donkey Kong 64'' ===\nA successful [[Nintendo 64]] sequel to Rare's ''Donkey Kong Country'' games was also developed. In ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'', Donkey Kong once again has the starring role as he joins forces with the DK crew to save Donkey Kong Island from destruction at the hands of [[King K. Rool]]. The playable characters include Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, and the newly introduced [[Lanky Kong]], [[Tiny Kong]] and [[Chunky Kong]]. ''Donkey Kong 64'' is a 3D [[platform game]] in the same vein as ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]''; players must navigate 3D environments while collecting Golden Bananas and other items as they advance through the game. It also features multiplayer arena-battle modes for up to four players. Like the ''Donkey Kong Land'' titles, this game features a unique banana yellow cartridge, and is only playable with the included [[Expansion Pak]].\n\n=== ''Donkey Kong Jungle Beat'' === \n''[[Donkey Kong Jungle Beat]]'' was released in Japan in December 2004 and elsewhere in 2005, this platform game used the [[DK Bongos]] as a controller; tapping one drum repeatedly made Donkey Kong run, tapping both at the same time made him jump, tapping both alternately made him attack, and clapping or blowing in to the microphone caused an explosion, shown by a ripple in the screen, attracting assorted jewels or clearing obstacles to progress. A [[New Play Control!]] remake of ''Donkey Kong Jungle Beat'' was released for Wii in Japan on December 11, 2008, and in North America and Europe the following year. The bongo controls were replaced with a more traditional control scheme; players use the Wii Remote and Nunchuck to control Donkey Kong instead of tapping on the DK Bongos.\n\nThere were two arcade titles released exclusively in Japan based on ''Donkey Kong Jungle Beat''. The first was ''Donkey Kong Jungle Fever'', a [[medal game]] released in 2005, and the second was a sequel,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/arcade/m_donkey_2/|title=CAPCOM ARCADE GAME \u2013 \u30ab\u30d7\u30b3\u30f3 \u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0|date=8 April 2008|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=30 September 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408012004/http://www.capcom.co.jp/arcade/m_donkey_2/|archivedate=8 April 2008}}</ref> ''Donkey Kong Banana Kingdom'' (released on November 16, 2006). Both games were developed and published by [[Capcom]] on the [[Triforce (arcade system board)|Triforce]] arcade system board. Neither title has been released outside Japan.\n\n===Other games===\n==== Racing games ====\n;''Diddy Kong Racing'': ''[[Diddy Kong Racing]]'' was a 1997 racing game for the Nintendo 64 developed by Rare. It is the first game to spin off from the ''Donkey Kong Country'' series. It currently stands as the Nintendo 64's sixth-most best selling game. A racing game like ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'', ''Diddy Kong Racing'' also has a distinctive adventure mode and allows players to choose between three different vehicle types; cars, planes, and hovercrafts. This game notably features the debut of Banjo the Bear and Conker the Squirrel, who would later appear in their own franchise titles. Banjo and Conker were replaced by Dixie Kong and Tiny Kong in ''[[Diddy Kong Racing DS]]'', an enhanced remake for the [[Nintendo DS]] released in 2007.\n\n;''Donkey Kong Barrel Blast'': Donkey Kong's first title role on the Wii was released in the form of ''[[Donkey Kong Barrel Blast]]'', a racing title originally in development for the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]]. It was to make use of the DK Bongos peripheral that was introduced alongside ''Donkey Konga''. Due to the declining sales of the GameCube, development shifted to the Wii console where the Bongo control scheme was replaced by motion controls.\n\n====''Donkey Konga'' series====\nThe first game in the Donkey Konga series, ''[[Donkey Konga]]'', was released for the GameCube in 2004. Created by [[Namco]], this musical rhythm action game relied upon use of the [[DK Bongos]] accessory (purchasable separately or included, depending on the package) to hit a beat in time with the tune. The tunes included pop songs and themes from some previous Nintendo games, including the ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' version of the [[DK Rap]]. Its sequel, ''[[Donkey Konga 2]]'', was released in 2005, and Japan got ''[[Donkey Konga 3: Tabe-houdai! Haru Mogitate 50 Kyoku|Donkey Konga 3]]'' exclusively that same year.\n\n==== ''Mario vs. Donkey Kong'' series ====\n{{main|Mario vs. Donkey Kong}} <!-- This section doesn't need to detail individual games because it already has a main article. -->\n\nNintendo's first ''Donkey Kong'' title for the [[Game Boy Advance]] after Rare left was ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong]]'', a return to the earlier arcade-style games that incorporated many elements from the Game Boy version. While its style was that of other games, the Rare design for Donkey Kong carried over. Donkey Kong, originally a villain, returns to this role in the game: wanting a Mini Mario clockwork toy, he finds that they are sold out at a local toy store. Enraged, he terrifies the Toads at the factory and steals the toys. This sets up the game's plot, where Mario chases Donkey Kong until he can take the Mini Marios back from Donkey Kong. The game was followed by ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis|March of the Minis]]'' for the Nintendo DS, ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again!|Minis March Again]]'' on DSiWare, ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Mini-Land Mayhem!|Mini-Land Mayhem]]'' in 2010 for the DS, ''[[Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move|Minis on the Move]]'' for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in 2013 and ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars|Tipping Stars]]'' for the Nintendo 3DS and [[Wii U]] in 2014.\n\n==== Miscellaneous genres ====\n;''Donkey Kong Circus'': ''[[Donkey Kong Circus]]'' was a ''[[Game & Watch]] Panorama'' series game released in 1984.<ref name=\"obscurepix\"/> In this game, the player controls [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]], who is placed on a barrel while juggling pineapples and avoiding flames. This game is very similar to ''Mario the Juggler'', the last [[Game & Watch]] game, as they both involve a character juggling while avoiding objects.\n\n;''Donkey Kong Jr. Math'': ''[[Donkey Kong Jr. Math]]'' was an [[edutainment]] game released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)]], wherein players must solve math problems in order to win. It is the only game in the \"Education Series\" of NES games in North America. The game features one and two player modes, both of which are single screen. In the first mode, the objective is to enter math answers in order to receive points. These questions include [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[division (mathematics)|division]]. In the two player mode, two players control two characters as they race to create a math formula to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, incorporating [[platform game]]play. ''Donkey Kong Jr. Math'' was made available in the video game ''[[Animal Crossing (video game)|Animal Crossing]]'', along with several other NES titles. It has also been released on the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in Europe, Australia, Japan, and North America.\n\n;''Donkey Kong Hockey'': It was developed by [[Nintendo Research & Development 1|Nintendo R&D1]] and released in 1985 as part of the ''[[Game & Watch]] Micro Vs.'' series. The game features one LCD screen and two attached control pads. The hockey features Donkey Kong as one of the players and Mario as the other.\n\n;''DK: King of Swing'': ''[[DK King of Swing|DK: King of Swing]]'' is a puzzle-platform game developed by [[Paon]] that features gameplay similar to ''[[Clu Clu Land]]''. Here, the player must navigate levels using only the GBA's left and right shoulder buttons. \n\n;''DK: Jungle Climber'': A sequel to the aforementioned game, ''[[DK Jungle Climber|DK: Jungle Climber]]'' is Donkey Kong's only title role on the Nintendo DS. It features pseudo-3D visuals that more closely resemble the ''Donkey Kong Country'' games, dual screen gameplay, and a team-up mechanic with Diddy Kong.\n\n=== Cancelled games ===\n;''Return of Donkey Kong'': A [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] game announced in the Official Nintendo Player's Guide in 1987. Not much is known about the title; whether it was cancelled or a working title for a game released under a different name is unknown.\n\n;''Donkey Kong Racing'': A demo for a racing game on the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], Nintendo's sixth generation console, was shown at [[Nintendo Space World|Space World]] 2001. It showed various characters, including Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, and Taj the Genie of ''Diddy Kong Racing'' fame racing on Rambi, Enguarde, Expresso, and Ellie, and Zinger, Necky, Army, and Chomps Jr. that had been introduced in previous ''Donkey Kong'' games. Following the sale of Nintendo's 49% stake in Rare to [[Microsoft]] in 2002, Rare announced that they were concentrating their efforts on [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] games. Although they had continued to support Nintendo's portable consoles, the [[Game Boy Advance]] and [[Nintendo DS]], the game was cancelled. Rare later reworked the game into ''[[Sabreman]] Stampede'', which incorporated a lot of the same ideas without the racing aspect, but was also later cancelled.\n\n;''Diddy Kong Pilot'': ''[[Diddy Kong Pilot]]'' was a planned sequel to ''[[Diddy Kong Racing]]'', but with flying as the only means of transportation. After Rare was sold to Microsoft, which caused the company to lose the rights to the ''Donkey Kong'' characters, ''Diddy Kong Pilot'' was converted into the game ''[[Banjo-Pilot]]'' in 2005. However, on November 5, 2011, a collector who had purchased a prototype cartridge leaked its ROM onto the internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unseen64.net/2011/11/06/beta-versions-of-diddy-kong-pilot-and-banjo-kazooie-gba-now-leaked-and-preserved/|title=Beta versions of Diddy Kong Pilot and Banjo Kazooie GBA now leaked and preserved.|publisher=Unseen64|date=November 7, 2011|accessdate=December 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n;''Donkey Kong Coconut Crackers'': ''[[Donkey Kong Coconut Crackers]]'' was a puzzle game for the Game Boy Advance that was being developed by Rare. Similar to ''Donkey Kong Racing'' and ''Diddy Kong Pilot'', the game was cancelled in 2002 due to Microsoft's acquisition of Rare. The game was eventually reworked into ''[[It's Mr. Pants]]'', and was released on December 7, 2004.\n\n;''Diddy Kong Racing Adventure'': A rejected pitch made by the Climax Group for a ''[[Diddy Kong Racing]]'' sequel on the Nintendo GameCube around 2004. The project was never announced to the public in any capacity and only became known after an amateur video game archivist acquired the prototype and published a video about it in November 2016.<ref>{{cite web|author=Allegra, Frank|url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/11/9/13574292/diddy-kong-racing-2-diddy-kong-racing-adventure-gamecube|title=We\u2019ll never get to play this canceled Diddy Kong Racing sequel|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=November 9, 2016|accessdate= October 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Spin-offs ===\n;''Mario'' franchise: After appearing in the original ''Donkey Kong'' and ''Donkey Kong Jr.'', Mario would star in the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]], beginning with the arcade game ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' and resulting in the [[Super Mario (series)|''Super Mario'' series]]\u2014becoming Nintendo's mascot in the process. The ''Super Mario'' series would have its own spin-offs, including ''[[Mario Kart]]'' and ''[[Mario Party]]''. Donkey Kong appears as a playable character in the vast majority of these spin-offs. The roots of the ''Mario'' franchise in ''Donkey Kong'' are further acknowledged in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'', with many elements of the DK franchise featured in the New Donk City level. DK and Diddy have their own [[Amiibo]] figures as part of the ''Super Mario'' line.<ref>{{cite web|title=E3 2016: Daisy, Waluigi, Boo Amiibo Announced Alongside New Mario Series Amiibo|url=https://ign.com/articles/2016/06/14/e3-2016-daisy-waluigi-boo-amiibo-announced-alongside-new-mario-series-amiibo|website=[[IGN]]|author=Goldfarb, Andrew|date=June 14, 2016|accessdate=October 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n;''Banjo-Kazooie'' series: Following his appearance in ''Diddy Kong Racing'', Banjo went on to star in ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'', leading to the [[Banjo-Kazooie series|''Banjo-Kazooie'' series]]. Although originally owned by Nintendo, Microsoft is the current owner of the ''Banjo-Kazooie'' series due to their acquisition of Rare in 2002.\n\n;''Conker'' series: Following his appearance in ''Diddy Kong Racing'', [[Conker the Squirrel]] went on to star in ''[[Conker's Pocket Tales]]'', leading to the [[Conker series|''Conker'' series]]. Unlike Banjo, Conker was never under the ownership of Nintendo.\n\n=== Crossovers ===\n;''Mario Kart'' series: The ''Donkey Kong'' series has been represented in every game of the [[Mario Kart|''Mario Kart'' series]]. Donkey Kong appears racing alongside characters from the ''[[Super Mario]]'',  ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' and ''[[Splatoon]]'' franchises. Diddy Kong appears as a playable character in ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'', ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' and ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]'', and Funky Kong appears as playable character in ''Mario Kart Wii.''

Here, he was given a space on the board maps as a foil to [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]. He returned as a playable character in ''[[Mario Party 10]]'' for the Wii U and ''[[Mario Party: Star Rush]]'' for the Nintendo 3DS. Diddy Kong makes cameo appearances in ''[[Mario Party DS]]'' and ''[[Mario Party 9]]'', and is an unlockable character in ''Mario Party: Star Rush'' and ''[[Super Mario Party]].''\n\n;''Mario'' sports series: Donkey Kong has appeared as a playable character in almost every game of the [[List of Mario sports games|''Mario'' sports series]] since the Nintendo 64 era, including ''[[Mario Golf (video game)|Mario Golf]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', ''[[Super Mario Strikers]]'', and ''[[Mario Superstar Baseball]]''. Diddy Kong is also featured as a playable character in many titles, while additional characters from the ''Donkey Kong'' series, such as Dixie Kong, Funky Kong, and King K. Rool, have made sporadic appearances. Donkey Kong appears as playable character in ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games]]'' and every game in the ''Mario & Sonic'' series thereafter. Diddy Kong was introduced to the series in ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games]]''.\n\n;''Super Smash Bros.'' series: Donkey Kong has appeared as a playable character in every game of the [[Super Smash Bros.|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]] first appearing as one of eight characters in the original ''[[Super Smash Bros.

Diddy Kong was later introduced as a playable character in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' as an agile fighter. In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', King K. Rool was introduced as a playable character, bringing with him an arsenal of attacks from the ''Donkey Kong Country'' series. Other characters, like Cranky Kong and Dixie Kong, have appeared throughout the series as collectible trophies.

Ultimate'', along with the N64 Kongo Jungle, Jungle Japes, and 75m.\n\n== Other media ==\n=== Television series ===\nThe ''[[Saturday Supercade#Donkey Kong|Saturday Supercade]]'' was the character's first role in a television series. In it, Donkey Kong (voiced by Soupy Sales) has escaped from the circus and Mario (voiced by Peter Cullen) and Pauline (voiced by Judy Strangis) are chasing the ape. As with the original game, Donkey Kong will often grab Pauline, and Mario has to save her.\n\nThe [[Donkey Kong Country (TV series)|''Donkey Kong Country'' television series]] was developed based on game of the same name. Airing in France in 1997 and in the US in 1998, the series lasted two seasons with 40 total episodes featuring exclusive characters including Bluster Kong, Eddie the Mean Old Yeti and Kaptain Scurvy.\n\nThe ''Planet of Donkey Kong'', later ''DKTV.cool'' was broadcast in France from September 4, 1996 to September 1, 2001.

In the case, ''[[Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.]]'', a [[United States District Court]] ruled that Universal had acted in [[bad faith]], and that it had no right over the name ''King Kong'' or the characters and story. The court further held that there was no possibility for consumers to confuse Nintendo's game and characters with the ''King Kong'' films and their characters. The case was an enormous victory for Nintendo, which was still a newcomer to the U.S. market. The case established the company as a major player in the industry and arguably gave the company the confidence that it could compete with the giants of American media.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sheff|first=David|year=1999|title=Game Over: Press Start to Continue: The Maturing of Mario|publisher=GamePress| location=Wilton, Connecticut|page=127}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the ''Donkey Kong'' series has resulted in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' awarding the series with seven world records in the ''Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008''.

Donkey Kong first made his appearance in the 1981 arcade machine called ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', in which he faced Jumpman ([[Mario]]), now Nintendo's flagship character. This game was also the first appearance of Mario, pre-dating the well-known ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' by four years. In 1994, the series was revived as the ''[[Donkey Kong Country (series)|Donkey Kong Country]]''  series, featuring Donkey Kong and his clan of other [[apes]] as [[protagonists]] in their native jungle setting versus a variety of [[anthropomorphic]] enemies, usually against the [[Kremlings]], a clan of crocodiles, and their leader [[King K. Rool]]. These are [[side-scrolling]] [[platform game]]s. Titles outside these two genres have included rhythm games (''[[Donkey Konga]]''), racing games (''[[Diddy Kong Racing]]''), and edutainment (''[[Donkey Kong Jr. Math]]'').\n\nA hallmark of the ''Donkey Kong'' franchise is [[barrel]]s, which the Kongs use as weapons, vehicles, furniture, and lodging. The Donkey Kong character is highly recognizable and very popular; the franchise has sold over 40 million units worldwide.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060907213926/http://press.nintendo.com/object?id=7657]</ref>\n\n== Characters ==\n{{main|List of Donkey Kong characters}}\n\n[[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] first appeared in the eponymous arcade game in 1981 as the opponent.  He would become the [[player character]] in later games. [[Donkey Kong Jr. (character)|Donkey Kong Jr.]] first appeared in the arcade style game ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'' released in 1982. The plot was that Donkey Kong Jr. saves his father, Donkey Kong, from [[Mario]]  (initially known as Jumpman in the Japanese arcade version of ''Donkey Kong''). [[Cranky Kong]] is the original Donkey Kong who has alternately been called the modern DK's grandfather and father.<ref>''Donkey Kong Country'' instruction manual</ref> He is elderly and frequently berates the younger generation of heroes. [[Diddy Kong]] was first introduced in ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' and is featured in ''[[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest]]'' as the main character. [[Dixie Kong]] first appeared in ''Donkey Kong Country 2'' as a sidekick to Diddy Kong and has been referred to as his girlfriend.

Other notable members of the Kong family include [[Funky Kong]], [[Candy Kong]], [[Wrinkly Kong]], [[Tiny Kong]], and [[Lanky Kong]]. [[King K.

The result was a major breakthrough for Nintendo and for the videogame industry. Sales of the machine were brisk, with the game becoming one of the best-selling arcade machines of the early 1980s. The gameplay itself was a large improvement over other games of its time, and with the growing base of arcades to sell to, it was able to gain huge distribution. In the game, 'Jumpman' (the character would later become Mario) must ascend a construction site while avoiding obstacles such as barrels and fireballs to rescue Pauline, his girlfriend,  from Donkey Kong. Miyamoto created a greatly simplified version for the [[Game & Watch]] multiscreen. Other ports include the [[Atari 2600]], [[Colecovision]], [[Amiga 500]], [[Apple II family|Apple II]], [[Atari 7800]], [[Intellivision]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore VIC-20]], [[Famicom Disk System]], [[IBM PC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[MSX]], [[Atari 8-bit family]] and Mini-Arcade versions. The game was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] in 1983 as one of the system's three [[launch title]]s; the same version was a launch title for the Famicom's North American version, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Both ''Donkey Kong'' and its sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'', are included in the 1988 NES compilation ''Donkey Kong Classics''. The NES version was re-released as an unlockable game in Donkey Kong 64 for the Nintendo 64, ''[[Animal Crossing (video game)|Animal Crossing]]'' for the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]]{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} and as an item for purchase on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/virtual-console-lineup-unveiled|title=Wii Virtual Console Lineup Unveiled|last=Parish|first=Jeremy|date=31 October 2006|website=[[1UP.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603233125/http://www.1up.com/news/virtual-console-lineup-unveiled|archivedate=3 June 2011}}</ref> The original arcade version of the game appears in the [[Nintendo 64]] game ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]''.

The game was once more ported to Nintendo consoles Wii, [[Wii U]] and [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]] in 2013 and 2014, under the name ''Donkey Kong Original Edition''.\n\n;''Donkey Kong Jr.'': The success of the original game spawned several ports, and a sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'' In this game, Donkey Kong Junior is trying to rescue his father Donkey Kong, who has been imprisoned. Donkey Kong's cage is guarded by Mario, in his only appearance as a villain in a video game.

Donkey Kong Jr. has to climb to the top screen while avoiding things such as electrical wires. When he gets to the top screen, Donkey Kong Jr. will have to touch the key again, and it will move to the keyhole of one of the chains. Donkey Kong Jr. has to climb up the rope below the keyhole, while avoiding birds. When he gets to the top of the rope, one of the chains will unlock. He has to do this 4 times until he saves Donkey Kong. After that, the game will start over, at a somewhat faster pace.\n\n;''Donkey Kong II'': ''[[Donkey Kong II]]'' was developed by [[Nintendo Research & Development 1|Nintendo R&D1]] and was released in 1983, as part of the [[Game & Watch]] Multi Screen series.\n\n;''Donkey Kong 3'': ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'' did not feature Mario. Its protagonist, Stanley, is a bugman. Donkey Kong has taken refuge in his greenhouse and it is now up to him to stop the ape from stirring up any more insects that will soon destroy his flowers. Stanley saves the flowers by spraying bug spray on Donkey Kong.\n\n;''Donkey Kong'' (Game Boy): In 1994, [[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|''Donkey Kong'']], a [[homonym]]ous [[Video game remake|remake]] of the [[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|original game]] was released for the [[Game Boy]], adding 96 new levels.  This game was also the first game released with [[Super Game Boy]] enhancements, to help sell the new SNES peripheral.

In ''Donkey Kong Country'', the original Donkey Kong's grandson, also called Donkey Kong, is the hero and he and his sidekick [[Diddy Kong]] have to save his hoard of [[banana]]s from the thieving [[King K. Rool]] and his [[Kremling]] Krew. The game was an action sidescrolling title similar to the ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' games and was enormously popular for its graphics, music and gameplay. The sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest]]'' involves Diddy and his girlfriend [[Dixie Kong]] embarking on a journey to Crocodile Isle to rescue DK from the clutches of K. Rool. In ''[[Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!]]'' both DK and Diddy are kidnapped by a mysterious robot named KAOS\u2060\u2014who is, in actuality, being operated by K. Rool\u2060\u2014and Dixie and her cousin [[Kiddy Kong]] have to venture to the Northern Kremisphere to save them in the final game of the series for the SNES.\n\nThe ''Donkey Kong Country'' trilogy games are primarily [[platform game|platforming]] games in which players complete [[side-scrolling]] levels.<ref name=\"Manual4-7\">{{Cite journal |title=Donkey Kong Country Instruction Booklet |publisher=Nintendo |year=1994 |id=SNS-8X-USA |pages=4\u20137 |postscript=}}</ref><ref name=\"Provo\">{{Cite journal |last=Provo |first=Frank |title=Donkey Kong Country (Wii) |publisher=[[CNET Networks]] |date=February 23, 2007 |accessdate=April 14, 2009 |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/wii-games/donkey-kong-country-wii/1707-9993_7-32313231.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117004639/http://reviews.cnet.com/wii-games/donkey-kong-country-wii/1707-9993_7-32313231.html |archivedate=November 17, 2010 }}</ref> Each world is uniquely themed and consists of tasks such as swimming, riding in mine carts, launching out of barrel cannons, or swinging from vine to vine.<ref name=\"Provo\"/> Players lose a life when hit by any enemy or falling off the screen.

''[[Donkey Kong Land]]'' was released in 1995, ''[[Donkey Kong Land 2]]'' in 1996 and ''[[Donkey Kong Land III]]'' in 1997. They were presented in distinctive yellow cartridges instead of the typical grey ones. A port of ''Donkey Kong Country'' was released for the [[Game Boy Color]] in 2000, featuring mini-games and an exclusive new level. Following the success of the ''Donkey Kong Land'' series and the GBC port of ''Donkey Kong Country'', ports of the original trilogy were released for the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2003,<ref>{{cite web|title=NOA clarifies release dates|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/article_47593|website=[[Eurogamer]]|author=Bramwell, Tom|date=March 20, 2003|accessdate=October 10, 2019}}</ref> 2004,<ref>{{cite web|title=Nintendo announces date for GBA Donkey Kong Country 2|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news120304dkc2|website=[[Eurogamer]]|author=Bramwell, Tom|date=March 12, 2004|accessdate=October 10, 2019}}</ref> and 2005,<ref>{{cite web|title=Nintendo's Christmas line-up|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news190805nintyxmas|website=[[Eurogamer]]|author=GamesIndustry International, Contributor|date=August 19, 2005|accessdate=October 10, 2019}}</ref> and a [[Donkey_Kong_Country_Returns#Donkey_Kong_Country_Returns_3D|handheld port]] of ''Donkey Kong Country Returns'' was released for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D release date swings in|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-15-donkey-kong-country-returns-3d-release-date|website=[[Eurogamer]]|author=Phillips, Tom|date=March 18, 2013|accessdate=October 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Donkey Kong 64'' ===\nA successful [[Nintendo 64]] sequel to Rare's ''Donkey Kong Country'' games was also developed. In ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'', Donkey Kong once again has the starring role as he joins forces with the DK crew to save Donkey Kong Island from destruction at the hands of [[King K. Rool]]. The playable characters include Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, and the newly introduced [[Lanky Kong]], [[Tiny Kong]] and [[Chunky Kong]]. ''Donkey Kong 64'' is a 3D [[platform game]] in the same vein as ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]''; players must navigate 3D environments while collecting Golden Bananas and other items as they advance through the game. It also features multiplayer arena-battle modes for up to four players. Like the ''Donkey Kong Land'' titles, this game features a unique banana yellow cartridge, and is only playable with the included [[Expansion Pak]].\n\n=== ''Donkey Kong Jungle Beat'' === \n''[[Donkey Kong Jungle Beat]]'' was released in Japan in December 2004 and elsewhere in 2005, this platform game used the [[DK Bongos]] as a controller; tapping one drum repeatedly made Donkey Kong run, tapping both at the same time made him jump, tapping both alternately made him attack, and clapping or blowing in to the microphone caused an explosion, shown by a ripple in the screen, attracting assorted jewels or clearing obstacles to progress. A [[New Play Control!]] remake of ''Donkey Kong Jungle Beat'' was released for Wii in Japan on December 11, 2008, and in North America and Europe the following year. The bongo controls were replaced with a more traditional control scheme; players use the Wii Remote and Nunchuck to control Donkey Kong instead of tapping on the DK Bongos.\n\nThere were two arcade titles released exclusively in Japan based on ''Donkey Kong Jungle Beat''. The first was ''Donkey Kong Jungle Fever'', a [[medal game]] released in 2005, and the second was a sequel,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/arcade/m_donkey_2/|title=CAPCOM ARCADE GAME \u2013 \u30ab\u30d7\u30b3\u30f3 \u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0|date=8 April 2008|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=30 September 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408012004/http://www.capcom.co.jp/arcade/m_donkey_2/|archivedate=8 April 2008}}</ref> ''Donkey Kong Banana Kingdom'' (released on November 16, 2006). Both games were developed and published by [[Capcom]] on the [[Triforce (arcade system board)|Triforce]] arcade system board. Neither title has been released outside Japan.\n\n===Other games===\n==== Racing games ====\n;''Diddy Kong Racing'': ''[[Diddy Kong Racing]]'' was a 1997 racing game for the Nintendo 64 developed by Rare. It is the first game to spin off from the ''Donkey Kong Country'' series. It currently stands as the Nintendo 64's sixth-most best selling game. A racing game like ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'', ''Diddy Kong Racing'' also has a distinctive adventure mode and allows players to choose between three different vehicle types; cars, planes, and hovercrafts. This game notably features the debut of Banjo the Bear and Conker the Squirrel, who would later appear in their own franchise titles. Banjo and Conker were replaced by Dixie Kong and Tiny Kong in ''[[Diddy Kong Racing DS]]'', an enhanced remake for the [[Nintendo DS]] released in 2007.\n\n;''Donkey Kong Barrel Blast'': Donkey Kong's first title role on the Wii was released in the form of ''[[Donkey Kong Barrel Blast]]'', a racing title originally in development for the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]]. It was to make use of the DK Bongos peripheral that was introduced alongside ''Donkey Konga''. Due to the declining sales of the GameCube, development shifted to the Wii console where the Bongo control scheme was replaced by motion controls.\n\n====''Donkey Konga'' series====\nThe first game in the Donkey Konga series, ''[[Donkey Konga]]'', was released for the GameCube in 2004. Created by [[Namco]], this musical rhythm action game relied upon use of the [[DK Bongos]] accessory (purchasable separately or included, depending on the package) to hit a beat in time with the tune. The tunes included pop songs and themes from some previous Nintendo games, including the ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' version of the [[DK Rap]]. Its sequel, ''[[Donkey Konga 2]]'', was released in 2005, and Japan got ''[[Donkey Konga 3: Tabe-houdai! Haru Mogitate 50 Kyoku|Donkey Konga 3]]'' exclusively that same year.\n\n==== ''Mario vs. Donkey Kong'' series ====\n{{main|Mario vs. Donkey Kong}} <!-- This section doesn't need to detail individual games because it already has a main article. -->\n\nNintendo's first ''Donkey Kong'' title for the [[Game Boy Advance]] after Rare left was ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong]]'', a return to the earlier arcade-style games that incorporated many elements from the Game Boy version. While its style was that of other games, the Rare design for Donkey Kong carried over. Donkey Kong, originally a villain, returns to this role in the game: wanting a Mini Mario clockwork toy, he finds that they are sold out at a local toy store. Enraged, he terrifies the Toads at the factory and steals the toys. This sets up the game's plot, where Mario chases Donkey Kong until he can take the Mini Marios back from Donkey Kong. The game was followed by ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis|March of the Minis]]'' for the Nintendo DS, ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again!|Minis March Again]]'' on DSiWare, ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Mini-Land Mayhem!|Mini-Land Mayhem]]'' in 2010 for the DS, ''[[Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move|Minis on the Move]]'' for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in 2013 and ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars|Tipping Stars]]'' for the Nintendo 3DS and [[Wii U]] in 2014.\n\n==== Miscellaneous genres ====\n;''Donkey Kong Circus'': ''[[Donkey Kong Circus]]'' was a ''[[Game & Watch]] Panorama'' series game released in 1984.<ref name=\"obscurepix\"/> In this game, the player controls [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]], who is placed on a barrel while juggling pineapples and avoiding flames. This game is very similar to ''Mario the Juggler'', the last [[Game & Watch]] game, as they both involve a character juggling while avoiding objects.\n\n;''Donkey Kong Jr. Math'': ''[[Donkey Kong Jr. Math]]'' was an [[edutainment]] game released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)]], wherein players must solve math problems in order to win. It is the only game in the \"Education Series\" of NES games in North America. The game features one and two player modes, both of which are single screen. In the first mode, the objective is to enter math answers in order to receive points. These questions include [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[division (mathematics)|division]]. In the two player mode, two players control two characters as they race to create a math formula to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, incorporating [[platform game]]play. ''Donkey Kong Jr. Math'' was made available in the video game ''[[Animal Crossing (video game)|Animal Crossing]]'', along with several other NES titles. It has also been released on the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in Europe, Australia, Japan, and North America.\n\n;''Donkey Kong Hockey'': It was developed by [[Nintendo Research & Development 1|Nintendo R&D1]] and released in 1985 as part of the ''[[Game & Watch]] Micro Vs.'' series. The game features one LCD screen and two attached control pads. The hockey features Donkey Kong as one of the players and Mario as the other.\n\n;''DK: King of Swing'': ''[[DK King of Swing|DK: King of Swing]]'' is a puzzle-platform game developed by [[Paon]] that features gameplay similar to ''[[Clu Clu Land]]''. Here, the player must navigate levels using only the GBA's left and right shoulder buttons. \n\n;''DK: Jungle Climber'': A sequel to the aforementioned game, ''[[DK Jungle Climber|DK: Jungle Climber]]'' is Donkey Kong's only title role on the Nintendo DS. It features pseudo-3D visuals that more closely resemble the ''Donkey Kong Country'' games, dual screen gameplay, and a team-up mechanic with Diddy Kong.\n\n=== Cancelled games ===\n;''Return of Donkey Kong'': A [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] game announced in the Official Nintendo Player's Guide in 1987. Not much is known about the title; whether it was cancelled or a working title for a game released under a different name is unknown.\n\n;''Donkey Kong Racing'': A demo for a racing game on the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], Nintendo's sixth generation console, was shown at [[Nintendo Space World|Space World]] 2001. It showed various characters, including Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, and Taj the Genie of ''Diddy Kong Racing'' fame racing on Rambi, Enguarde, Expresso, and Ellie, and Zinger, Necky, Army, and Chomps Jr. that had been introduced in previous ''Donkey Kong'' games. Following the sale of Nintendo's 49% stake in Rare to [[Microsoft]] in 2002, Rare announced that they were concentrating their efforts on [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] games. Although they had continued to support Nintendo's portable consoles, the [[Game Boy Advance]] and [[Nintendo DS]], the game was cancelled. Rare later reworked the game into ''[[Sabreman]] Stampede'', which incorporated a lot of the same ideas without the racing aspect, but was also later cancelled.\n\n;''Diddy Kong Pilot'': ''[[Diddy Kong Pilot]]'' was a planned sequel to ''[[Diddy Kong Racing]]'', but with flying as the only means of transportation. After Rare was sold to Microsoft, which caused the company to lose the rights to the ''Donkey Kong'' characters, ''Diddy Kong Pilot'' was converted into the game ''[[Banjo-Pilot]]'' in 2005.

The ''Super Mario'' series would have its own spin-offs, including ''[[Mario Kart]]'' and ''[[Mario Party]]''. Donkey Kong appears as a playable character in the vast majority of these spin-offs. The roots of the ''Mario'' franchise in ''Donkey Kong'' are further acknowledged in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'', with many elements of the DK franchise featured in the New Donk City level.

Diddy Kong is also featured as a playable character in many titles, while additional characters from the ''Donkey Kong'' series, such as Dixie Kong, Funky Kong, and King K. Rool, have made sporadic appearances. Donkey Kong appears as playable character in ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games]]'' and every game in the ''Mario & Sonic'' series thereafter. Diddy Kong was introduced to the series in ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games]]''.\n\n;''Super Smash Bros.'' series: Donkey Kong has appeared as a playable character in every game of the [[Super Smash Bros.|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]] first appearing as one of eight characters in the original ''[[Super Smash Bros.

As with the original game, Donkey Kong will often grab Pauline, and Mario has to save her.\n\nThe [[Donkey Kong Country (TV series)|''Donkey Kong Country'' television series]] was developed based on game of the same name. Airing in France in 1997 and in the US in 1998, the series lasted two seasons with 40 total episodes featuring exclusive characters including Bluster Kong, Eddie the Mean Old Yeti and Kaptain Scurvy.\n\nThe ''Planet of Donkey Kong'', later ''DKTV.cool'' was broadcast in France from September 4, 1996 to September 1, 2001. It was presented by M\u00e9lanie Ang\u00e9lie and Donkey Kong, voiced by Nicolas Bienvenu. After the departure of Ang\u00e9lie, the program continued without a host and was renamed DKTV.cool on July 1, 2000.

In the case, ''[[Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.]]'', a [[United States District Court]] ruled that Universal had acted in [[bad faith]], and that it had no right over the name ''King Kong'' or the characters and story. The court further held that there was no possibility for consumers to confuse Nintendo's game and characters with the ''King Kong'' films and their characters. The case was an enormous victory for Nintendo, which was still a newcomer to the U.S. market. The case established the company as a major player in the industry and arguably gave the company the confidence that it could compete with the giants of American media.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sheff|first=David|year=1999|title=Game Over: Press Start to Continue: The Maturing of Mario|publisher=GamePress| location=Wilton, Connecticut|page=127}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the ''Donkey Kong'' series has resulted in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' awarding the series with seven world records in the ''Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008''.
