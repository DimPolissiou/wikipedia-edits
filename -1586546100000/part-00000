Another proposes that Eiger is based on Latin and/or Greek words meaning sharp, pinnacle or peak. A third suggests that it derives from a German dialect phrase ''dr hej Ger'' - a ''ger'' being a sharp spear used in warfare. - Chapter 2, The Redoubtable Beufoys}}</ref> The three mountains of the ridge are commonly referred to as the Virgin (German: ''Jungfrau'' \u2013 translates to \"virgin\" or \"maiden\"), the Monk (''M\u00f6nch''), and the Ogre (''Eiger''; the standard German word for ogre is ''Oger'').\n\nThe name has been linked to the [[Latin language|Latin]] term ''acer'', meaning \"sharp\" or \"pointed\".\n\n==Geographic setting and description==\n[[File:Eiger und M\u00f6nch.jpg|thumb|right|The Eiger and M\u00f6nch from [[Kleine Scheidegg]]]]\n\nThe Eiger is located above the [[Lauterbrunnen Valley]] to the west and [[Grindelwald]] to the north in the [[Bernese Highlands]] of the [[canton of Bern]].<ref name=EMJ>{{cite map |url=https://s.geo.admin.ch/7883830474 |title=Eiger M\u00f6nch Jungfrau |map=3 - Suisse sud-ouest |map-url=https://shop.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/products/maps/national/lk200?layer=ch.swisstopo.landeskarte200_papier.metadata&product=3&productIdentifier=3#product-3 |scale=1:200 000 |series=National Map 1:200'000 |edition=2014 |date= |publisher=Federal Office of Topography \u2013 [[swisstopo]] |location=Wabern, Switzerland |isbn=978-3-302-00003-9 |via=map.geo.admin.ch |accessdate=2018-02-02}}</ref> It forms a renowned mountain range of the [[Bernese Alps]] together with its two companions: the [[Jungfrau]] ({{convert|4158|m|abbr=on}}) about {{convert|5.6|km}} southwest of it and the [[M\u00f6nch]] ({{convert|4107|m|abbr=on}}) about in the middle of them.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/travel/alps-glaciers-climate-change.html</ref> The nearest settlements are Grindelwald, [[Lauterbrunnen]] ({{convert|795|m|abbr=on}}) and [[Wengen]] ({{convert|1274|m|abbr=on}}).

It is one of the three [[great north faces of the Alps]], along with the north faces of the [[Matterhorn]] and the [[Grandes Jorasses]] (known as 'the Trilogy'). It is about 1,800&nbsp;m (5,900&nbsp;ft) tall and overlooks [[Kleine Scheidegg]] and [[Grindelwald]]. At 2,866 metres inside the mountain lies the [[Eigerwand railway station]]. The station is connected to the north face by a tunnel opening at the face, which has sometimes been used to rescue climbers. The Eiger Trail, at the base of the north face, runs from [[Eigergletscher railway station|Eigergletscher]] to [[Alpiglen railway station|Alpiglen]] railway stations.\n\nIt was first climbed on July 24, 1938 by [[Andreas Heckmair]], [[Ludwig V\u00f6rg]], [[Heinrich Harrer]] and [[Fritz Kasparek]], a [[Germany|German]]\u2013[[Austria]]n group. The group had originally consisted of two independent teams; Harrer and Kasparek were joined on the face by Heckmair and V\u00f6rg, who had started their ascent a day later and had been helped by the fixed rope that the lead group had left across the [[Andreas Hinterstoisser|Hinterstoisser Traverse]]. The two groups, led by the experienced Heckmair, cooperated on the more difficult later pitches, and finished the climb roped together as a single group of four.\n\n[[File:Eiger Pilz-Mushroom.jpg|thumb|left|Close view of the north face from the west ridge]]\nA portion of the upper face is called \"The White Spider\", as snow-filled cracks radiating from an ice-field resemble the legs of a [[spider]]. Harrer used this name for the title of his book about his successful climb, ''Die Weisse Spinne'' (translated into English as ''[[The White Spider: The Classic Account of the Ascent of the Eiger]]''). During the first successful ascent, the four men were caught in an avalanche as they climbed the Spider, but all had enough strength to resist being swept off the face.\n\nSince then, the north face has been climbed many times. Today it is regarded as a formidable challenge more because of the increased rockfall and diminishing ice-fields than because of its technical difficulties, which are exceeded by the 8,000 m peaks in the [[Himalaya]] and [[Karakoram]]. Climbers are increasingly electing to challenge the Eiger in winter, when the crumbling face is strengthened by ice.\n\n{{Anchor|Mordwand}}Since 1935, at least sixty-four climbers have died attempting the north face, earning it the German nickname, ''Mordwand'', or \"murderous wall\", a play on the face's German name ''Nordwand''.<ref name=\"Venables\"/>\n\n==Climbing history==\n[[File:Eiger.JPG|thumb|View from the railway station of [[Kleine Scheidegg]] ]]\nWhile the summit was reached without much difficulty in 1858 by a complex route on the west flank, the battle to climb the north face has captivated the interest of climbers and non-climbers alike. Before it was successfully climbed, most of the attempts on the face ended tragically and the Bernese authorities even banned climbing it and threatened to fine any party that should attempt it again. But the enthusiasm which animated the young talented climbers from Austria and Germany finally vanquished its reputation of unclimbability when a party of four climbers successfully reached the summit in 1938 by what is known as the \"1938\" or \"Heckmair\" route.\n\nThe climbers that attempted the north face could be easily watched through the telescopes from the [[Kleine Scheidegg]], a pass between Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen, connected by rail. The contrast between the comfort and civilization of the railway station and the agonies of the young men slowly dying a short yet uncrossable distance away led to intensive coverage by the international media.\n\nAfter World War II, the north face was climbed twice in 1947, first by a party of two French guides, [[Louis Lachenal]] and [[Lionel Terray]], then by a Swiss party consisting of H. Germann, with Hans and Karl Schlunegger.<ref name = Engel>Claire Eliane Engel, ''A History of Mountaineering in the Alps'', 1950</ref>\n\n===First ascent===\n[[File:Eigernordwand.JPG|thumb|The Eiger from the north side (and [[M\u00f6nch]] behind)]]\nThe first ascent was made by the western flank on August 11, 1858 by [[Charles Barrington (mountaineer)|Charles Barrington]] with guides Christian Almer and Peter Bohren. They started at 3:00&nbsp;a.m. from [[Wengen]]. Barrington describes the route much as it is followed today, staying close to the edge of the north face much of the way. They reached the summit at about noon, stayed for some 10 minutes and descended in about four hours. Barrington describes the reaching of the top, saying, \"the two guides kindly gave me the place of first man up.\" Their ascent was confirmed by observation of a flag left on the summit. According to Harrer's ''[[The White Spider]]'', Barrington was originally planning to make the first ascent of the [[Matterhorn]], but his finances did not allow him to travel there as he was already staying in the Eiger region.<ref>[http://www.summitpost.org/view_object.php?object_id=172575 First ascent of the Eiger] summitpost.org.

They waited a long time for good weather and when the clouds finally cleared they started. The two climbers reached the height of the Eigerwand station and made their first [[bivouac shelter|bivouac]]. On the following day, because of the greater difficulties, they gained little height. On the third day they made hardly any vertical ground. That night a storm broke and the mountain was hidden in fog, and then it began to snow. Avalanches of snow began to sweep the face and the clouds closed over it. Two days later, there was a short moment when the clouds cleared and the mountain was visible for a while. The two men were glimpsed, now a little higher and about to bivouac for the fifth time. Then the fog came down again and hid the climbers. A few days later the weather finally cleared, revealing a completely white north face. The two climbers were found later frozen to death at 3,300 m, at a place now known as \"[[Death Bivouac]]\".<ref name = Engel/><ref>[http://classic.mountainzone.com/climbing/eiger/ The north face of the Eiger] mountainzone.com.

Before their attempts started one of them was killed during a training climb, and the weather was so bad during that summer that, after waiting for a change and seeing none on the way, several members of the party gave up. Of the four that remained, two were Bavarians, [[Andreas Hinterstoisser]] and [[Toni Kurz]], and two were Austrians, [[Willy Angerer]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Edi Rainer|sv|3=Eduard Rainer|lt=Edi Rainer}}. When the weather improved they made a preliminary exploration of the lowest part of the face. Hinterstoisser fell {{convert|37|m|ft}} but was not injured. A few days later the four men finally began the ascent of the face. They climbed quickly, but on the next day, after their first bivouac, the weather changed; clouds came down and hid the group to the observers. They did not resume the climb until the following day, when, during a break, the party was seen descending, but the climbers could be seen only intermittently from the ground. The group had no choice but to retreat, since Angerer had suffered serious injuries from falling rock. The party became stuck on the face when they could not recross the difficult Hinterstoisser Traverse, from which they had taken the rope they had first used to climb it. The weather then deteriorated for two days. They were ultimately swept away by an avalanche, which only Kurz survived, hanging on a rope. Three guides started on an extremely perilous rescue attempt. They failed to reach him but came within shouting distance and learned what had happened. Kurz explained the fate of his companions: one had fallen down the face, another was frozen above him, and the third had fractured his skull in falling and was hanging dead on the rope.<ref name = Engel/>\n\nIn the morning the three guides came back, traversing the face from a hole near the Eigerwand station and risking their lives under incessant avalanches. Toni Kurz was still alive but almost helpless, with one hand and one arm completely frozen. Kurz hauled himself off the cliff after cutting loose the rope that bound him to his dead teammate below and climbed back onto the face. The guides were not able to pass an unclimbable overhang that separated them from Kurz. They managed to give him a rope long enough to reach them by tying two ropes together. While descending, Kurz could not get the knot to pass through his [[carabiner]]. He tried for hours to reach his rescuers who were only a few metres below him. Then he began to lose consciousness. One of the guides, climbing on another's shoulders, was able to touch the tip of Kurz's crampons with his ice-axe but could not reach higher. Kurz was unable to descend further and, completely exhausted, died slowly.<ref name = Engel/>\n\n====1937====\nAn attempt was made in 1937 by {{Interlanguage link multi|Mathias Rebitsch|de}} and [[Ludwig V\u00f6rg]]. Although the attempt was unsuccessful, they were nonetheless the first climbers who returned alive from a serious attempt on the face. They started the climb on 11 August and reached a high point of a few rope lengths above Death Bivouac. A storm then broke and after three days on the wall they had to retreat. This was the first successful withdrawal from a significant height on the wall.<ref>[http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/topicalbumbackground/2056/alptraum_der_alpen.html Alptraum der Alpen] einestages.spiegel.de.

The party had originally consisted of two independent teams: Harrer (who did not have a pair of [[crampons]] on the climb) and Kasparek were joined on the face by Heckmair and V\u00f6rg, who had started their ascent a day later and had been helped by the fixed rope that the lead team had left across the Hinterstoisser Traverse.  The two groups, led by the experienced Heckmair, decided to join their forces and roped together as a single group of four. Heckmair later wrote: \"We, the sons of the older Reich, united with our companions from the Eastern Border to march together to victory.\"<ref name = Engel/>\n\nThe expedition was constantly threatened by snow avalanches and climbed as quickly as possible between the falls. On the third day a storm broke and the cold was intense. The four men were caught in an avalanche as they climbed \"the Spider,\" the snow-filled cracks radiating from an ice-field on the upper face, but all possessed sufficient strength to resist being swept off the face. The members successfully reached the summit at four o'clock in the afternoon. They were so exhausted that they only just had the strength to descend by the normal route through a raging blizzard.<ref name = Engel/>\n\n===Other routes===\n[[Image:Maximilien de Meuron 001.jpg|thumb|right|Painting of the Eiger by [[Maximilien de Meuron]], early 19th century]]\n[[Image:The Eiger In Summer.JPG|thumb|right|The north face on a clear summer day]]\n[[Image:Eiger Felsabbruch20060721.JPG|thumb|right|Rockfall onto the [[Lower Grindelwald Glacier]] valley, July 2006]]\n\n* 1857: First attempt by [[Christian Almer]], Christian Kaufmann, [[Ulrich Kaufmann]] guiding the Viennese alpinist [[Sigismund Porges]].

Another proposes that Eiger is based on Latin and/or Greek words meaning sharp, pinnacle or peak. A third suggests that it derives from a German dialect phrase ''dr hej Ger'' - a ''ger'' being a sharp spear used in warfare. - Chapter 2, The Redoubtable Beufoys}}</ref> The three mountains of the ridge are commonly referred to as the Virgin (German: ''Jungfrau'' \u2013 translates to \"virgin\" or \"maiden\"), the Monk (''M\u00f6nch''), and the Ogre (''Eiger''; the standard German word for ogre is ''Oger'').\n\nThe name has been linked to the [[Latin language|Latin]] term ''acer'', meaning \"sharp\" or \"pointed\".\n\n==Geographic setting and description==\n[[File:Eiger und M\u00f6nch.jpg|thumb|right|The Eiger and M\u00f6nch from [[Kleine Scheidegg]]]]\n\nThe Eiger is located above the [[Lauterbrunnen Valley]] to the west and [[Grindelwald]] to the north in the [[Bernese Highlands]] of the [[canton of Bern]].<ref name=EMJ>{{cite map |url=https://s.geo.admin.ch/7883830474 |title=Eiger M\u00f6nch Jungfrau |map=3 - Suisse sud-ouest |map-url=https://shop.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/products/maps/national/lk200?layer=ch.swisstopo.landeskarte200_papier.metadata&product=3&productIdentifier=3#product-3 |scale=1:200 000 |series=National Map 1:200'000 |edition=2014 |date= |publisher=Federal Office of Topography \u2013 [[swisstopo]] |location=Wabern, Switzerland |isbn=978-3-302-00003-9 |via=map.geo.admin.ch |accessdate=2018-02-02}}</ref> It forms a renowned mountain range of the [[Bernese Alps]] together with its two companions: the [[Jungfrau]] ({{convert|4158|m|abbr=on}}) about {{convert|5.6|km}} southwest of it and the [[M\u00f6nch]] ({{convert|4107|m|abbr=on}}) about in the middle of them.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/travel/alps-glaciers-climate-change.html</ref> The nearest settlements are Grindelwald, [[Lauterbrunnen]] ({{convert|795|m|abbr=on}}) and [[Wengen]] ({{convert|1274|m|abbr=on}}).

It is one of the three [[great north faces of the Alps]], along with the north faces of the [[Matterhorn]] and the [[Grandes Jorasses]] (known as 'the Trilogy'). It is about 1,800&nbsp;m (5,900&nbsp;ft) tall and overlooks [[Kleine Scheidegg]] and [[Grindelwald]]. At 2,866 metres inside the mountain lies the [[Eigerwand railway station]]. The station is connected to the north face by a tunnel opening at the face, which has sometimes been used to rescue climbers. The Eiger Trail, at the base of the north face, runs from [[Eigergletscher railway station|Eigergletscher]] to [[Alpiglen railway station|Alpiglen]] railway stations.\n\nIt was first climbed on July 24, 1938 by [[Andreas Heckmair]], [[Ludwig V\u00f6rg]], [[Heinrich Harrer]] and [[Fritz Kasparek]], a [[Germany|German]]\u2013[[Austria]]n group. The group had originally consisted of two independent teams; Harrer and Kasparek were joined on the face by Heckmair and V\u00f6rg, who had started their ascent a day later and had been helped by the fixed rope that the lead group had left across the [[Andreas Hinterstoisser|Hinterstoisser Traverse]]. The two groups, led by the experienced Heckmair, cooperated on the more difficult later pitches, and finished the climb roped together as a single group of four.\n\n[[File:Eiger Pilz-Mushroom.jpg|thumb|left|Close view of the north face from the west ridge]]\nA portion of the upper face is called \"The White Spider\", as snow-filled cracks radiating from an ice-field resemble the legs of a [[spider]]. Harrer used this name for the title of his book about his successful climb, ''Die Weisse Spinne'' (translated into English as ''[[The White Spider: The Classic Account of the Ascent of the Eiger]]''). During the first successful ascent, the four men were caught in an avalanche as they climbed the Spider, but all had enough strength to resist being swept off the face.\n\nSince then, the north face has been climbed many times. Today it is regarded as a formidable challenge more because of the increased rockfall and diminishing ice-fields than because of its technical difficulties, which are exceeded by the 8,000 m peaks in the [[Himalaya]] and [[Karakoram]]. Climbers are increasingly electing to challenge the Eiger in winter, when the crumbling face is strengthened by ice.\n\n{{Anchor|Mordwand}}Since 1935, at least sixty-four climbers have died attempting the north face, earning it the German nickname, ''Mordwand'', or \"murderous wall\", a play on the face's German name ''Nordwand''.<ref name=\"Venables\"/>\n\n==Climbing history==\n[[File:Eiger.JPG|thumb|View from the railway station of [[Kleine Scheidegg]] ]]\nWhile the summit was reached without much difficulty in 1858 by a complex route on the west flank, the battle to climb the north face has captivated the interest of climbers and non-climbers alike. Before it was successfully climbed, most of the attempts on the face ended tragically and the Bernese authorities even banned climbing it and threatened to fine any party that should attempt it again. But the enthusiasm which animated the young talented climbers from Austria and Germany finally vanquished its reputation of unclimbability when a party of four climbers successfully reached the summit in 1938 by what is known as the \"1938\" or \"Heckmair\" route.\n\nThe climbers that attempted the north face could be easily watched through the telescopes from the [[Kleine Scheidegg]], a pass between Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen, connected by rail. The contrast between the comfort and civilization of the railway station and the agonies of the young men slowly dying a short yet uncrossable distance away led to intensive coverage by the international media.\n\nAfter World War II, the north face was climbed twice in 1947, first by a party of two French guides, [[Louis Lachenal]] and [[Lionel Terray]], then by a Swiss party consisting of H. Germann, with Hans and Karl Schlunegger.<ref name = Engel>Claire Eliane Engel, ''A History of Mountaineering in the Alps'', 1950</ref>\n\n===First ascent===\n[[File:Eigernordwand.JPG|thumb|The Eiger from the north side (and [[M\u00f6nch]] behind)]]\nThe first ascent was made by the western flank on August 11, 1858 by [[Charles Barrington (mountaineer)|Charles Barrington]] with guides Christian Almer and Peter Bohren. They started at 3:00&nbsp;a.m. from [[Wengen]]. Barrington describes the route much as it is followed today, staying close to the edge of the north face much of the way. They reached the summit at about noon, stayed for some 10 minutes and descended in about four hours. Barrington describes the reaching of the top, saying, \"the two guides kindly gave me the place of first man up.\" Their ascent was confirmed by observation of a flag left on the summit. According to Harrer's ''[[The White Spider]]'', Barrington was originally planning to make the first ascent of the [[Matterhorn]], but his finances did not allow him to travel there as he was already staying in the Eiger region.<ref>[http://www.summitpost.org/view_object.php?object_id=172575 First ascent of the Eiger] summitpost.org.

They waited a long time for good weather and when the clouds finally cleared they started. The two climbers reached the height of the Eigerwand station and made their first [[bivouac shelter|bivouac]]. On the following day, because of the greater difficulties, they gained little height. On the third day they made hardly any vertical ground. That night a storm broke and the mountain was hidden in fog, and then it began to snow. Avalanches of snow began to sweep the face and the clouds closed over it. Two days later, there was a short moment when the clouds cleared and the mountain was visible for a while. The two men were glimpsed, now a little higher and about to bivouac for the fifth time. Then the fog came down again and hid the climbers. A few days later the weather finally cleared, revealing a completely white north face. The two climbers were found later frozen to death at 3,300 m, at a place now known as \"[[Death Bivouac]]\".<ref name = Engel/><ref>[http://classic.mountainzone.com/climbing/eiger/ The north face of the Eiger] mountainzone.com.

Before their attempts started one of them was killed during a training climb, and the weather was so bad during that summer that, after waiting for a change and seeing none on the way, several members of the party gave up. Of the four that remained, two were Bavarians, [[Andreas Hinterstoisser]] and [[Toni Kurz]], and two were Austrians, [[Willy Angerer]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Edi Rainer|sv|3=Eduard Rainer|lt=Edi Rainer}}. When the weather improved they made a preliminary exploration of the lowest part of the face. Hinterstoisser fell {{convert|37|m|ft}} but was not injured. A few days later the four men finally began the ascent of the face. They climbed quickly, but on the next day, after their first bivouac, the weather changed; clouds came down and hid the group to the observers. They did not resume the climb until the following day, when, during a break, the party was seen descending, but the climbers could be seen only intermittently from the ground. The group had no choice but to retreat, since Angerer had suffered serious injuries from falling rock. The party became stuck on the face when they could not recross the difficult Hinterstoisser Traverse, from which they had taken the rope they had first used to climb it. The weather then deteriorated for two days. They were ultimately swept away by an avalanche, which only Kurz survived, hanging on a rope. Three guides started on an extremely perilous rescue attempt. They failed to reach him but came within shouting distance and learned what had happened. Kurz explained the fate of his companions: one had fallen down the face, another was frozen above him, and the third had fractured his skull in falling and was hanging dead on the rope.<ref name = Engel/>\n\nIn the morning the three guides came back, traversing the face from a hole near the Eigerwand station and risking their lives under incessant avalanches. Toni Kurz was still alive but almost helpless, with one hand and one arm completely frozen. Kurz hauled himself off the cliff after cutting loose the rope that bound him to his dead teammate below and climbed back onto the face. The guides were not able to pass an unclimbable overhang that separated them from Kurz. They managed to give him a rope long enough to reach them by tying two ropes together. While descending, Kurz could not get the knot to pass through his [[carabiner]]. He tried for hours to reach his rescuers who were only a few metres below him. Then he began to lose consciousness. One of the guides, climbing on another's shoulders, was able to touch the tip of Kurz's crampons with his ice-axe but could not reach higher. Kurz was unable to descend further and, completely exhausted, died slowly.<ref name = Engel/>\n\n====1937====\nAn attempt was made in 1937 by {{Interlanguage link multi|Mathias Rebitsch|de}} and [[Ludwig V\u00f6rg]]. Although the attempt was unsuccessful, they were nonetheless the first climbers who returned alive from a serious attempt on the face. They started the climb on 11 August and reached a high point of a few rope lengths above Death Bivouac. A storm then broke and after three days on the wall they had to retreat. This was the first successful withdrawal from a significant height on the wall.<ref>[http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/topicalbumbackground/2056/alptraum_der_alpen.html Alptraum der Alpen] einestages.spiegel.de.

Heckmair later wrote: \"We, the sons of the older Reich, united with our companions from the Eastern Border to march together to victory.\"<ref name = Engel/>\n\nThe expedition was constantly threatened by snow avalanches and climbed as quickly as possible between the falls. On the third day a storm broke and the cold was intense. The four men were caught in an avalanche as they climbed \"the Spider,\" the snow-filled cracks radiating from an ice-field on the upper face, but all possessed sufficient strength to resist being swept off the face. The members successfully reached the summit at four o'clock in the afternoon.

The documentary won an [[International Emmy Award for best documentary|Emmy Award]] the subsequent year.\n* The 2008 German historical fiction film ''[[North Face (film)|Nordwand]]'' is based on the [[Eiger#1936|1936 attempt]] to climb the Eiger north face. The film is about the two German climbers, [[Toni Kurz]] and [[Andreas Hinterstoisser]], involved in a competition with an Austrian duo to be the first to scale the north face of Eiger.\n* The 2010 documentary ''Eiger: Wall of Death'' by Steve Robinson.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mountains|Alps}}\n*[[List of mountains of Switzerland]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==Works cited==\n* {{cite book|last=Anker|first=Daniel|title=Eiger: The Vertical Arena|location=Seattle|publisher=The Mountaineers|year=2000}}\n* {{cite book|authorlink=Heinrich Harrer|last=Harrer|first=Heinrich|title=The White Spider: The History of the Eiger's North Face|language=German|location=London|year=1959|edition=3rd}}\n* {{cite journal|first=David|last=Pagel|title=My Dinner with Anderl|journal=Ascent|publisher=AAC Press|location=Golden, Colorado|year=1999|pages =13\u201326}}\n* {{cite book|first=Joe|last=Simpson|title=The Beckoning Silence|publisher=Jonathan Cape Publishers|location=London|year=2002|isbn=0-09-942243-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/beckoningsilence0000simp_g2n8}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Eiger}}\n* [http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/mountain_link.pl?mountain_id=46 The Eiger on Summitpost]\n* [http://www.peakware.com/peaks.html?pk=71 The Eiger on Peakware] - photos\n* [http://www.hikr.org/dir/Eiger_1505/ The Eiger on Hikr]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/groups/eiger The Eiger on Flickr]\n* [http://www.swisspanorama.com/ Live webcam view of the Eiger north face]\n* [http://fksa.org/showthread.php?t=6271 New and Old Explorations of the Eiger, Photos & Video]\n* [http://www.racingandsports.com.au/sports/rsNewsArt.asp?NID=128312&story=Steck_scales_new_heights_with_Eiger_Award_2008 Ueli Steck wins inaugural Eiger Award 2008]\n*[http://www.markseaton.com/stories/eiger.htm Are you still here?

He acts tough to the students at the school, but he is actually a pampered boy who misses his mother deeply. Saddened to be returning to the tedium of [[boarding school]], Julien's classes seem uneventful until P\u00e8re Jean, the headmaster, introduces three new pupils. One of them, Jean Bonnet, is the same age as Julien. Like the other students, Julien at first despises Bonnet, a socially awkward boy with a talent for [[arithmetic]] and playing the [[piano]].\n\nOne night, Julien wakes up and discovers that Bonnet is wearing a [[kippah]] and is praying in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. After digging through his new friend's locker, Julien learns the truth. His new friend's name is not Bonnet, but Jean Kippelstein. P\u00e8re Jean, a compassionate, sacrificing [[priest]] of the old school, had agreed to grant a secret asylum to hunted Jews. After a game of [[Treasure hunt (game)|treasure hunt]], however, Julien and Jean bond and a close friendship develops between them.\n\nWhen Julien's mother visits on Parents' Day, Julien asks his mother if Bonnet, whose parents could not come, could accompany them to lunch at a gourmet restaurant. As they sit around the table, the talk turns to Julien's father, a factory owner. When Julien's brother asks if he is still for [[Philippe P\u00e9tain|Marshal P\u00e9tain]], Madame Quentin responds, \"No one is anymore.\" However, the [[Milice]] arrive and attempt to expel a Jewish diner. When Julien's brother calls them ''\"[[Collaborationism|Collabos]],\"'' the Milice commander is enraged and tells Madam Quentin, \"We serve [[France]], madam. He insulted us.\" However, when a [[Wehrmacht]] officer coldly orders them to leave, the Milice officers grudgingly obey. Julien's mother comments that the Jewish diner appears to be a very distinguished gentleman. She insists that she has nothing against Jews, but would not object if the [[socialist]] politician [[L\u00e9on Blum]] were hanged.\n\nShortly thereafter, Joseph, the school's assistant cook, is exposed for selling the school's food supplies on the [[black market]]. He implicates several students as accomplices, including Julien and his brother, Fran\u00e7ois.

He acts tough to the students at the school, but he is actually a pampered boy who misses his mother deeply. Saddened to be returning to the tedium of [[boarding school]], Julien's classes seem uneventful until P\u00e8re Jean, the headmaster, introduces three new pupils. One of them, Jean Bonnet, is the same age as Julien. Like the other students, Julien at first despises Bonnet, a socially awkward boy with a talent for [[arithmetic]] and playing the [[piano]].\n\nOne night, Julien wakes up and discovers that Bonnet is wearing a [[kippah]] and is praying in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. After digging through his new friend's locker, Julien learns the truth. His new friend's name is not Bonnet, but Jean Kippelstein. P\u00e8re Jean, a compassionate, sacrificing [[priest]] of the old school, had agreed to grant a secret asylum to hunted Jews. After a game of [[Treasure hunt (game)|treasure hunt]], however, Julien and Jean bond and a close friendship develops between them.\n\nWhen Julien's mother visits on Parents' Day, Julien asks his mother if Bonnet, whose parents could not come, could accompany them to lunch at a gourmet restaurant. As they sit around the table, the talk turns to Julien's father, a factory owner. When Julien's brother asks if he is still for [[Philippe P\u00e9tain|Marshal P\u00e9tain]], Madame Quentin responds, \"No one is anymore.\" However, the [[Milice]] arrive and attempt to expel a Jewish diner. When Julien's brother calls them ''\"[[Collaborationism|Collabos]],\"'' the Milice commander is enraged and tells Madam Quentin, \"We serve [[France]], madam. He insulted us.\" However, when a [[Wehrmacht]] officer coldly orders them to leave, the Milice officers grudgingly obey. Julien's mother comments that the Jewish diner appears to be a very distinguished gentleman. She insists that she has nothing against Jews, but would not object if the [[socialist]] politician [[L\u00e9on Blum]] were hanged.\n\nShortly thereafter, Joseph, the school's assistant cook, is exposed for selling the school's food supplies on the [[black market]]. He implicates several students as accomplices, including Julien and his brother, Fran\u00e7ois. Although P\u00e8re Jean is visibly distressed by the injustice, he fires Joseph but does not expel the students for fear of offending their wealthy and influential parents.\n\nOn a cold morning in January 1944, the [[Gestapo]] raid the school. As his classroom is being searched, Julien unintentionally gives away Bonnet by looking in his direction. As the other two Jewish boys are hunted down, Julien encounters the person who denounced them, Joseph the kitchen hand. Trying to justify his betrayal in the face of Julien's mute disbelief, Joseph tells him, \"Don't act so pious. There's a war on, kid.\" Disgusted, Julien runs off. Jean and Julien exchange books, a shared hobby of theirs, as they pack away their belongings due to the closure of the school.\n\nAs the students are lined up in the school courtyard, a Gestapo officer denounces the illegal nature of P\u00e8re Jean's actions. He further accuses all French people of being weak and undisciplined. Meanwhile, P\u00e8re Jean and the three Jewish students are led away by the officers. P\u00e8re Jean shouts: ''\"Au revoir, les enfants! \u00c0 bient\u00f4t!\"'' to the children and they respond: ''\"Au revoir, mon p\u00e8re!\"'' As they leave the grounds, Jean glances over towards Julien briefly, and he waves in return.\n\nThe film ends with an older Julien providing a voiceover epilogue:\n\n''\"Bonnet, Negus and Dupre died at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]; Father Jean at [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Gusen I (Mauthausen)]].

He appeared in a total of 11 films directed by Bergman, among which were ''[[The Virgin Spring]]'' (1960) and ''[[Through a Glass Darkly (film)|Through a Glass Darkly]]'' (1961), both winners of the [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].

A [[remake]] of the [[Child's Play (1988 film)|1988 film of the same name]] and a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Child's Play (franchise)|''Child's Play'' franchise]], it follows a family terrorized by a high-tech doll who becomes self-aware and subsequently murderous. The film stars [[Aubrey Plaza]], [[Gabriel Bateman]], [[Brian Tyree Henry]], and [[Mark Hamill]] as the voice of [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]]. It is an international co-production of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].\n\nThe development of a ''Child's Play'' remake was announced in July 2018. Klevberg signed on as director from a script by Burton Smith, saying in an interview he drew inspiration from the 1982 [[science fiction film]], ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. [[Principal photography]] lasted from September to November 2018 in [[Vancouver]], Canada.\n\n''Child's Play'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 21, 2019, by [[Orion Pictures]] through [[United Artists|United Artists Releasing]]. The film received mixed reviews and grossed $45 million worldwide against a $10 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nThe multinational Kaslan Corporation has just launched ''Buddi'', a revolutionary line of high-tech dolls designed to be life-long companions to their owners, learning from their surroundings, and acting accordingly, quickly becoming a success for children worldwide. At an assembly factory in [[Vietnam]], an employee is fired by his supervisor for insufficient work. In retaliation, the employee manipulates the ''Buddi'' doll that he is assembling by disabling all of its safety protocols, before committing suicide. The doll is packed alongside others in preparation for international delivery. \n\nIn [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], retail clerk Karen Barclay and her 13-year-old hearing-impaired son, [[Andy Barclay|Andy]], have moved into their new apartment. In an attempt to cheer Andy up and make up for the unease cause by the relocation and her new boyfriend Shane, Karen blackmails her boss in order to procure a defective ''Buddi'' doll, giving it to Andy as an early birthday gift. Once Andy activates the doll, it names himself \"[[Chucky (character)|Chucky]]\" and becomes attached to his owner. Over time, Chucky helps Andy befriend two other kids in the building \u2014 Falyn and Pugg \u2014 but also begin to display violent tendencies. For instance, he tries to strangle the Barclays' pet cat after it scratches Andy, and one night, while he and his friends gleefully watch a horror film, Chucky starts mimicking the violence on the screen and approaches the trio with a kitchen knife before Andy disarms him.\n\nThe next morning, Andy arrives home to find that his cat is dead; Chucky admits to having killed it so that it would not hurt him anymore. Karen locks the doll in a closet, but he escapes and terrorizes Shane, which leads him to confront Andy. After overhearing Andy's pleas for Shane to disappear, Chucky follows him home, where it is revealed that Shane has a family and has been [[Affair|having an affair]] with Karen behind his wife's back. While Shane is outside taking down Christmas lights, Chucky breaks his legs and activates a [[tiller]] that scalps and kills him. The following day, Chucky delivers Shane's skinned face as a gift to a horrified Andy.\n\nWhile police detective Mike Norris begins an investigation, Andy, Falyn and Pugg disable Chucky and throw him in the garbage. Building voyeur and electrician Gabe finds the doll and takes him to the basement to prepare him for an online sale. Now fully repaired, Chucky tortures and murders Gabe with a [[table saw]]. After making his way back to the ground level, Chucky lands in possession of another kid named Omar and proceeds to kill Norris' mother, Doreen, in a controlled car crash. Meanwhile, Andy fails to convince Karen that the doll has become murderous, and she takes Andy along to her next shift work at the local [[shopping mall]] to keep him nearby.\n\nSuspecting that Andy is the killer, Mike travels to the mall and apprehends him just as Chucky takes full control of the building. Chaos is unleashed as several employees and customers are brutally killed by rampaging ''Buddi'' dolls while Chucky triggers the mall's lockdown sequence. Amid the massacre, Mike is wounded, and Andy and his friends manage to reach the exit, only for Andy to be forced to return when Chucky reveals that he is holding Karen hostage, intending to kill her. Andy manages to free his mother while being attacked by Chucky, before stabbing the doll in his [[Electric battery|power cell]], deactivating him. While paramedics tend Karen, Mike, and other survivors outside the mall, the kids destroy and burn Chucky's body in a nearby alleway.\n\nIn the aftermath of Chucky's killing spree, Kaslan Corporation CEO Henry Kaslan issues a statement regarding Chucky's programming, announcing a massive ''Buddi'' dolls recall. As one of the dolls is being placed into storage, its eyes flicker red and smiles, revealing that Chucky transfered his [[Artificial intelligence|A. I.]] awareness into a new doll.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gabriel Bateman]] as [[Andy Barclay]], Karen's 13-year-old son with a hearing aid who comes into the possession of Chucky, a murderous ''Buddi'' doll.\n* [[Aubrey Plaza]] as Karen Barclay, Andy's widowed single mother who does not believe her son that Chucky is a killer.\n* [[Brian Tyree Henry]] as Detective Mike Norris, a police detective investigating Chucky's murder strings.\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as the voice of [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]], a once-harmless Buddi doll transformed into a rampaging killing machine after being maliciously reprogrammed.\n* [[Tim Matheson]] as Henry Kaslan, founder and CEO of Kaslan Corporation, the company that manufactures the ''Buddi'' dolls.<ref name=\"teaser2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/childs-play-clip-buddi|title=New Child's Play Clip Promises that Buddi is 'More Than a Toy...

A [[remake]] of the [[Child's Play (1988 film)|1988 film of the same name]] and a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Child's Play (franchise)|''Child's Play'' franchise]], it follows a family terrorized by a high-tech doll who becomes self-aware and subsequently murderous. The film stars [[Aubrey Plaza]], [[Gabriel Bateman]], [[Brian Tyree Henry]], and [[Mark Hamill]] as the voice of [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]]. It is an international co-production of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].\n\nThe development of a ''Child's Play'' remake was announced in July 2018. Klevberg signed on as director from a script by Burton Smith, saying in an interview he drew inspiration from the 1982 [[science fiction film]], ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. [[Principal photography]] lasted from September to November 2018 in [[Vancouver]], Canada.\n\n''Child's Play'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 21, 2019, by [[Orion Pictures]] through [[United Artists|United Artists Releasing]]. The film received mixed reviews and grossed $45 million worldwide against a $10 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nThe multinational Kaslan Corporation has just launched ''Buddi'', a revolutionary line of high-tech dolls designed to be life-long companions to their owners, learning from their surroundings, and acting accordingly, quickly becoming a success for children worldwide. At an assembly factory in [[Vietnam]], an employee is fired by his supervisor for insufficient work. In retaliation, the employee manipulates the ''Buddi'' doll that he is assembling by disabling all of its safety protocols, before committing suicide. The doll is packed alongside others in preparation for international delivery. \n\nIn [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], retail clerk Karen Barclay and her 13-year-old hearing-impaired son, [[Andy Barclay|Andy]], have moved into their new apartment. In an attempt to cheer Andy up and make up for the unease cause by the relocation and her new boyfriend Shane, Karen blackmails her boss in order to procure a defective ''Buddi'' doll, giving it to Andy as an early birthday gift. Once Andy activates the doll, it names himself \"[[Chucky (character)|Chucky]]\" and becomes attached to his owner. Over time, Chucky helps Andy befriend two other kids in the building \u2014 Falyn and Pugg \u2014 but also begin to display violent tendencies. For instance, he tries to strangle the Barclays' pet cat after it scratches Andy, and one night, while he and his friends gleefully watch a horror film, Chucky starts mimicking the violence on the screen and approaches the trio with a kitchen knife before Andy disarms him.\n\nThe next morning, Andy arrives home to find that his cat is dead; Chucky admits to having killed it so that it would not hurt him anymore. Karen locks the doll in a closet, but he escapes and terrorizes Shane, which leads him to confront Andy. After overhearing Andy's pleas for Shane to disappear, Chucky follows him home, where it is revealed that Shane has a family and has been [[Affair|having an affair]] with Karen behind his wife's back. While Shane is outside taking down Christmas lights, Chucky breaks his legs and activates a [[tiller]] that scalps and kills him. The following day, Chucky delivers Shane's skinned face as a gift to a horrified Andy.\n\nWhile police detective Mike Norris begins an investigation, Andy, Falyn and Pugg disable Chucky and throw him in the garbage. Building voyeur and electrician Gabe finds the doll and takes him to the basement to prepare him for an online sale. Now fully repaired, Chucky tortures and murders Gabe with a [[table saw]]. After making his way back to the ground level, Chucky lands in possession of another kid named Omar and proceeds to kill Norris' mother, Doreen, in a controlled car crash. Meanwhile, Andy fails to convince Karen that the doll has become murderous, and she takes Andy along to her next shift work at the local [[shopping mall]] to keep him nearby.\n\nSuspecting that Andy is the killer, Mike travels to the mall and apprehends him just as Chucky takes full control of the building. Chaos is unleashed as several employees and customers are brutally killed by rampaging ''Buddi'' dolls while Chucky triggers the mall's lockdown sequence. Amid the massacre, Mike is wounded, and Andy and his friends manage to reach the exit, only for Andy to be forced to return when Chucky reveals that he is holding Karen hostage, intending to kill her. Andy manages to free his mother while being attacked by Chucky, before stabbing the doll in his [[Electric battery|power cell]], deactivating him. While paramedics tend Karen, Mike, and other survivors outside the mall, the kids destroy and burn Chucky's body in a nearby alleway.\n\nIn the aftermath of Chucky's killing spree, Kaslan Corporation CEO Henry Kaslan issues a statement regarding Chucky's programming, announcing a massive ''Buddi'' dolls recall. As one of the dolls is being placed into storage, its eyes flicker red and smiles, revealing that Chucky transfered his [[Artificial intelligence|A. I.]] awareness into a new doll.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aubrey Plaza]] as Karen Barclay, Andy's widowed single mother who does not believe her son that Chucky is a killer.\n* [[Gabriel Bateman]] as [[Andy Barclay]], Karen's 13-year-old son with a hearing aid who comes into the possession of Chucky, a murderous ''Buddi'' doll.\n* [[Brian Tyree Henry]] as Detective Mike Norris, a police detective investigating Chucky's murder strings.\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as the voice of [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]], a once-harmless Buddi doll transformed into a rampaging killing machine after being maliciously reprogrammed.\n* [[Tim Matheson]] as Henry Kaslan, founder and CEO of Kaslan Corporation, the company that manufactures the ''Buddi'' dolls.<ref name=\"teaser2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/childs-play-clip-buddi|title=New Child's Play Clip Promises that Buddi is 'More Than a Toy...
