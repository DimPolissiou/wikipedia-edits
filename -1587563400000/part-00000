Many of his plays are structured around a [[time slip]], and he went on to develop a new theory of time, with different dimensions that link past, present, and future.\n\nIn 1940, he broadcast a series of short [[propaganda]] radio talks that were credited with strengthening civilian morale during the [[Battle of Britain]]. In the following years, his left-wing beliefs brought him into conflict with the government and influenced the birth of the [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare state]].\n\n==Early years==\nPriestley was born on 13 September 1894 at 34 Mannheim Road, [[Manningham, Bradford|Manningham]], which he described as an \"extremely respectable\" suburb of [[Bradford]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Judith|authorlink=Judith Cook|title=Priestley|year=1997|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=0-7475-3508-6|page=5|chapter=Beginnings and Childhood}}</ref>\nHis father Jonathan Priestley (1868\u20131924) was a headmaster. His mother Emma (nee Holt) (1865\u20131896) died when he was just two years old, and his father remarried four years later.<ref name=\"konkle\">Lincoln Konkle, ''J. B. Priestley'', in British Playwrights, 1880\u20131956: A Research and Production Sourcebook, by William W. Demastes, Katherine E. Kelly; [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]], 1996</ref> Priestley was educated at [[Belle Vue Boys' School|Belle Vue Grammar School]], which he left at sixteen to work as a junior clerk at Helm & Co., a wool firm in the [[Swan Arcade, Bradford|Swan Arcade]]. During his years at Helm & Co. (1910\u20131914), he started writing at night and had articles published in local and London newspapers. He was to draw on memories of Bradford in many of the works he wrote after he had moved south, including ''[[Bright Day]]'' and ''[[When We Are Married]]''. As an old man, he deplored the destruction by developers of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] buildings in Bradford such as the Swan Arcade, where he had his first job.\n\nPriestley served in the British army during the [[First World War]], volunteering to join the 10th Battalion, the [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]] on 7 September 1914, and being posted to France as a Lance-Corporal on 26 August 1915. He was badly wounded in June 1916, when he was buried alive by a trench mortar. He spent many months in military hospitals and convalescent establishments, and on 26 January 1918 was commissioned as an officer in the [[Devonshire Regiment]] and posted back to France late summer 1918. As he describes in his literary reminiscences, ''Margin Released'', he suffered from the effects of poison gas, and then supervised German prisoners of war, before being demobilised in early 1919.\n\nAfter his military service, Priestley received a university education at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]]. By the age of 30, he had established a reputation as an essayist and critic. His novel ''[[Benighted (novel)|Benighted]]'' (1927) was adapted into the [[James Whale]] film ''[[The Old Dark House (1932 film)|The Old Dark House]]'' (1932); the novel has been published under the film's name in the United States.\n\n==Career==\nPriestley's first major success came with a novel, ''The Good Companions'' (1929), which earned him the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction and made him a national figure. His next novel, ''[[Angel Pavement]]'' (1930), further established him as a successful novelist. However, some critics were less than complimentary about his work, and Priestley threatened legal action against [[Graham Greene]] for what he took to be a defamatory portrait of him in the novel ''[[Stamboul Train]]'' (1932).\n\nIn 1934 he published the travelogue ''[[English Journey]]'', an account of what he saw and heard while travelling through the country in the depths of the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Marr | first=Andrew | authorlink=Andrew Marr | title=A History of Modern Britain | year=2008 | page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmodernb0000marr/page/ xxii] | publisher=Macmillan | isbn=978-0-330-43983-1 | url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmodernb0000marr/page/ }}</ref>\n\nPriestley is today seen as having a prejudice against the Irish,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/irish-butt-of-english-racism-for-more-than-eight-centuries-1342976.html|title=Irish butt of English racism for more than eight centuries|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"Fagge2011\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNpNtZAB0yoC&pg=PA29|title=The Vision of J.B.

B. Priestley, ''English Journey'' (London: William Heinemann, 1934), pp. 248-9</ref>\n\nHe moved into a new genre and became equally well known as a [[dramatist]]. ''[[Dangerous Corner]]'' (1932) was the first of many plays that would enthral West End theatre audiences. His best-known play is ''[[An Inspector Calls]]'' (1945). His plays are more varied in tone than the novels, several being influenced by [[J. W. Dunne]]'s theory of time, which plays a part in the plots of ''Dangerous Corner'' (1932) and ''[[Time and the Conways]]''.\n\nIn 1940, Priestley wrote an essay for ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'' magazine, where he criticised [[George Bernard Shaw]] for his support of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]: \"Shaw presumes that his friend Stalin has everything under control. Well, Stalin may have made special arrangements to see that Shaw comes to no harm, but the rest of us in Western Europe do not feel quite so sure of our fate, especially those of us who do not share Shaw's curious admiration for dictators.\"<ref>J.

The ''Postscript'', broadcast on Sunday night through 1940 and again in 1941, drew peak audiences of 16 million; only [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] was more popular with listeners. [[Graham Greene]] wrote that Priestley \"became in the months after Dunkirk a leader second only in importance to Mr. Churchill. And he gave us what our other leaders have always failed to give us \u2013 an ideology.\"<ref>Cited in {{cite book |ref=harv <!-- {{sfn|Addison|2011|p=}} --> |title=The Road To 1945: British Politics and the Second World War |last=Addison |first=Paul |publisher=Random House |year=2011|isbn=9781446424216 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2hit1s8B04C&q=priestley}}</ref> But his talks were cancelled.<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |title=Revisiting the Welfare State |series=Introducing Social Policy |last=Page |first=Robert M. |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK) |year=2007 |page=10 |isbn=9780335234981 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Os5EBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA10&lpg=PA10}}</ref> It was thought that this was the effect of complaints from Churchill that they were too left-wing; however, in 2015 Priestley's son said in a talk on the latest book being published about his father's life that it was in fact Churchill's Cabinet that brought about the cancellation by supplying negative reports on the broadcasts to Churchill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cheltenhamfestivals.com/whats_on/event_detail.html?id=2545 |title=? |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915121708/http://cheltenhamfestivals.com/whats_on/event_detail.html?id=2545 |archivedate=15 September 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"biography\">{{cite news|title=Priestley war letters published |publisher= BBC News website |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7655113.stm |accessdate=10 June 2008 | date=6 October 2008}}</ref>\n\nPriestley chaired the [[1941 Committee]], and in 1942 he was a co-founder of the socialist [[Common Wealth Party]]. The political content of his broadcasts and his hopes of a new and different Britain after the war influenced the politics of the period and helped the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] gain its landslide victory in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Priestley himself, however, was distrustful of the state and dogma, though he did stand for the [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University]] constituency in 1945.\n\nPriestley's name was on [[Orwell's list]], a list of people which George Orwell prepared in March 1949 for the [[Information Research Department]] (IRD), a propaganda unit set up at the [[Foreign Office]] by the Labour government. Orwell considered or suspected these people to have pro-communist leanings and therefore to be unsuitable to write for the IRD.<ref>{{cite news|title=Blair's babe Did love turn Orwell into a government stooge? |first=John |last=Ezard |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 June 2003 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/21/books.artsandhumanities |accessdate=30 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nHe was a founding member of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] in 1958.\n\nIn 1960, Priestley published ''Literature and Western Man'', a 500-page survey of [[Western literature]] in all its genres from the second half of the 15th&nbsp;century to the present (the last author discussed is [[Thomas Wolfe]]).\n\nHis interest in the problem of time led him to publish an extended essay in 1964 under the title of ''Man and Time'' (Aldus published this as a companion to [[Carl Jung]]'s ''[[Man and His Symbols]]''). In this book he explored in depth various theories and beliefs about time as well as his own research and unique conclusions, including an analysis of the phenomenon of [[precognitive dreams|precognitive dreaming]], based in part on a broad sampling of experiences gathered from the British public, who responded enthusiastically to a televised appeal he made while being interviewed in 1963 on the BBC programme, ''[[Monitor (BBC TV)|Monitor]]''.\n\n[[File:NMM Priestley 01.jpg|thumb|right|Statue outside the National Media Museum]]\nThe [[University of Bradford]] awarded Priestley the title of honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] in 1970, and he was awarded the [[Freedom of the City]] of Bradford in 1973. His connections with the city were also marked by the naming of the J. B. Priestley Library at the University of Bradford, which he officially opened in 1975,<ref>[http://www.bradford.ac.uk/library/special-collections/collections/j-b-priestley-archive/ J. B.

This love is reflected in a number of Priestley's works, notably his own favourite novel ''Bright Day'' (Heinemann, 1946). His book ''Trumpets Over the Sea'' is subtitled \"a rambling and egotistical account of the London Symphony Orchestra's engagement at Daytona Beach, Florida, in July\u2013August 1967\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fagge|first1=Roger|title=The Vision of J.B.

In 1949 the opera ''[[The Olympians]]'' by [[Arthur Bliss]], to a libretto by Priestley, was premiered.\n\nPriestley snubbed the chance to become a [[life peer]] in 1965 and also declined appointment as a [[Companion of Honour]] in 1969.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Individuals, now deceased, who refused honours between 1951 and 1999|publisher=[[Cabinet Office]]|date=25 January 2012|url=https://update.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/document2012-01-24-075439.pdf|accessdate=27 January 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120404180350/https%3A//update.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/document2012%2D01%2D24%2D075439.pdf|archivedate=4 April 2012}}</ref> But he did become a member of the [[Order of Merit]] in 1977. He also served as a British delegate to [[UNESCO]] conferences.\n\n=== Married life ===\nPriestley was married three times. Priestley also had a number of affairs, including a serious relationship with the actress [[Peggy Ashcroft]].

Many of his plays are structured around a [[time slip]], and he went on to develop a new theory of time, with different dimensions that link past, present, and future.\n\nIn 1940, he broadcast a series of short [[propaganda]] radio talks that were credited with strengthening civilian morale during the [[Battle of Britain]]. In the following years, his left-wing beliefs brought him into conflict with the government and influenced the birth of the [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare state]].\n\n==Early years==\nPriestley was born on 13 September 1894 at 34 Mannheim Road, [[Manningham, Bradford|Manningham]], which he described as an \"extremely respectable\" suburb of [[Bradford]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Judith|authorlink=Judith Cook|title=Priestley|year=1997|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=0-7475-3508-6|page=5|chapter=Beginnings and Childhood}}</ref>\nHis father Jonathan Priestley (1868\u20131924) was a headmaster. His mother Emma (nee Holt) (1865\u20131896) died when he was just two years old, and his father remarried four years later.<ref name=\"konkle\">Lincoln Konkle, ''J. B. Priestley'', in British Playwrights, 1880\u20131956: A Research and Production Sourcebook, by William W. Demastes, Katherine E. Kelly; [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]], 1996</ref> Priestley was educated at [[Belle Vue Boys' School|Belle Vue Grammar School]], which he left at sixteen to work as a junior clerk at Helm & Co., a wool firm in the [[Swan Arcade, Bradford|Swan Arcade]]. During his years at Helm & Co. (1910\u20131914), he started writing at night and had articles published in local and London newspapers. He was to draw on memories of Bradford in many of the works he wrote after he had moved south, including ''[[Bright Day]]'' and ''[[When We Are Married]]''. As an old man, he deplored the destruction by developers of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] buildings in Bradford such as the Swan Arcade, where he had his first job.\n\nPriestley served in the British army during the [[First World War]], volunteering to join the 10th Battalion, the [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]] on 7 September 1914, and being posted to France as a Lance-Corporal on 26 August 1915. He was badly wounded in June 1916, when he was buried alive by a trench mortar. He spent many months in military hospitals and convalescent establishments, and on 26 January 1918 was commissioned as an officer in the [[Devonshire Regiment]] and posted back to France late summer 1918. As he describes in his literary reminiscences, ''Margin Released'', he suffered from the effects of poison gas, and then supervised German prisoners of war, before being demobilised in early 1919.\n\nAfter his military service, Priestley received a university education at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]]. By the age of 30, he had established a reputation as an essayist and critic. His novel ''[[Benighted (novel)|Benighted]]'' (1927) was adapted into the [[James Whale]] film ''[[The Old Dark House (1932 film)|The Old Dark House]]'' (1932); the novel has been published under the film's name in the United States.\n\n==Career==\nPriestley's first major success came with a novel, ''The Good Companions'' (1929), which earned him the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction and made him a national figure. His next novel, ''[[Angel Pavement]]'' (1930), further established him as a successful novelist. However, some critics were less than complimentary about his work, and Priestley threatened legal action against [[Graham Greene]] for what he took to be a defamatory portrait of him in the novel ''[[Stamboul Train]]'' (1932).\n\nIn 1934 he published the travelogue ''[[English Journey]]'', an account of what he saw and heard while travelling through the country in the depths of the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Marr | first=Andrew | authorlink=Andrew Marr | title=A History of Modern Britain | year=2008 | page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmodernb0000marr/page/ xxii] | publisher=Macmillan | isbn=978-0-330-43983-1 | url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmodernb0000marr/page/ }}</ref>\n\nPriestley is today seen as having a prejudice against the Irish,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/irish-butt-of-english-racism-for-more-than-eight-centuries-1342976.html|title=Irish butt of English racism for more than eight centuries|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"Fagge2011\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNpNtZAB0yoC&pg=PA29|title=The Vision of J.B.

B. Priestley, ''English Journey'' (London: William Heinemann, 1934), pp. 248-9</ref>\n\nHe moved into a new genre and became equally well known as a [[dramatist]]. ''[[Dangerous Corner]]'' (1932) was the first of many plays that would enthral West End theatre audiences. His best-known play is ''[[An Inspector Calls]]'' (1945). His plays are more varied in tone than the novels, several being influenced by [[J. W. Dunne]]'s theory of time, which plays a part in the plots of ''Dangerous Corner'' (1932) and ''[[Time and the Conways]]''.\n\nIn 1940, Priestley wrote an essay for ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'' magazine, where he criticised [[George Bernard Shaw]] for his support of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]: \"Shaw presumes that his friend Stalin has everything under control. Well, Stalin may have made special arrangements to see that Shaw comes to no harm, but the rest of us in Western Europe do not feel quite so sure of our fate, especially those of us who do not share Shaw's curious admiration for dictators.\"<ref>J.

The ''Postscript'', broadcast on Sunday night through 1940 and again in 1941, drew peak audiences of 16 million; only [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] was more popular with listeners. [[Graham Greene]] wrote that Priestley \"became in the months after Dunkirk a leader second only in importance to Mr. Churchill. And he gave us what our other leaders have always failed to give us \u2013 an ideology.\"<ref>Cited in {{cite book |ref=harv <!-- {{sfn|Addison|2011|p=}} --> |title=The Road To 1945: British Politics and the Second World War |last=Addison |first=Paul |publisher=Random House |year=2011|isbn=9781446424216 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2hit1s8B04C&q=priestley}}</ref> But his talks were cancelled.<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |title=Revisiting the Welfare State |series=Introducing Social Policy |last=Page |first=Robert M. |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK) |year=2007 |page=10 |isbn=9780335234981 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Os5EBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA10&lpg=PA10}}</ref> It was thought that this was the effect of complaints from Churchill that they were too left-wing; however, in 2015 Priestley's son said in a talk on the latest book being published about his father's life that it was in fact Churchill's Cabinet that brought about the cancellation by supplying negative reports on the broadcasts to Churchill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cheltenhamfestivals.com/whats_on/event_detail.html?id=2545 |title=? |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915121708/http://cheltenhamfestivals.com/whats_on/event_detail.html?id=2545 |archivedate=15 September 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"biography\">{{cite news|title=Priestley war letters published |publisher= BBC News website |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7655113.stm |accessdate=10 June 2008 | date=6 October 2008}}</ref>\n\nPriestley chaired the [[1941 Committee]], and in 1942 he was a co-founder of the socialist [[Common Wealth Party]]. The political content of his broadcasts and his hopes of a new and different Britain after the war influenced the politics of the period and helped the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] gain its landslide victory in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Priestley himself, however, was distrustful of the state and dogma, though he did stand for the [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University]] constituency in 1945.\n\nPriestley's name was on [[Orwell's list]], a list of people which George Orwell prepared in March 1949 for the [[Information Research Department]] (IRD), a propaganda unit set up at the [[Foreign Office]] by the Labour government. Orwell considered or suspected these people to have pro-communist leanings and therefore to be unsuitable to write for the IRD.<ref>{{cite news|title=Blair's babe Did love turn Orwell into a government stooge? |first=John |last=Ezard |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 June 2003 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/21/books.artsandhumanities |accessdate=30 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nHe was a founding member of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] in 1958.\n\nIn 1960, Priestley published ''Literature and Western Man'', a 500-page survey of [[Western literature]] in all its genres from the second half of the 15th&nbsp;century to the present (the last author discussed is [[Thomas Wolfe]]).\n\nHis interest in the problem of time led him to publish an extended essay in 1964 under the title of ''Man and Time'' (Aldus published this as a companion to [[Carl Jung]]'s ''[[Man and His Symbols]]''). In this book he explored in depth various theories and beliefs about time as well as his own research and unique conclusions, including an analysis of the phenomenon of [[precognitive dreams|precognitive dreaming]], based in part on a broad sampling of experiences gathered from the British public, who responded enthusiastically to a televised appeal he made while being interviewed in 1963 on the BBC programme, ''[[Monitor (BBC TV)|Monitor]]''.\n\n[[File:NMM Priestley 01.jpg|thumb|right|Statue outside the National Media Museum]]\nThe [[University of Bradford]] awarded Priestley the title of honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] in 1970, and he was awarded the [[Freedom of the City]] of Bradford in 1973. His connections with the city were also marked by the naming of the J. B. Priestley Library at the University of Bradford, which he officially opened in 1975,<ref>[http://www.bradford.ac.uk/library/special-collections/collections/j-b-priestley-archive/ J. B.

This love is reflected in a number of Priestley's works, notably his own favourite novel ''Bright Day'' (Heinemann, 1946).

The Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship\". The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Gandhi supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that he intended to dislodge Gandhi, and the trio stood to prevent that. Gandhi's Congress party was soundly crushed in the elections. The Janata Party's democracy or dictatorship claim seemed to resonate with the public. Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi lost their seats, and Congress was reduced to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of Morarji Desai, came to power after the State of Emergency was lifted.

The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and [[China]], rivals of the USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at the United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Before the war, Gandhi signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. They were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Gandhi was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept her from criticising the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Gandhi years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Gandhi, by the early 1980s, the Soviets had become India's largest trading partner.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short-lived liberalisation programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969. The government targeted growth at 5.7% while stating as its goals, \"growth with stability and progressive achievement of self-reliance.\"{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}}<ref name=\"Gupta\">{{Cite book| publisher = Deep and Deep Publications| page = 7|url={{Googlebooks|8D0iS_EF8_AC|page=PA7|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|isbn=978-8176295598| last = Gupta| first =  K.

This had been her first economic policy formulation, six months after coming to office. The programme emphasised greater state control of the economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Related to this point were a set of policies which were meant to regulate the private sector.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} By the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalisation process was complete, and India's policies were characterised as \"protectionist as ever.\"<ref name=\"Kirk\"/>\n\nTo deal with India's food problems, Gandhi expanded the emphasis on production of inputs to agriculture that had already been initiated by her father, Jawaharlal Nehru.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/> The [[Green Revolution in India]] subsequently culminated under her government in the 1970s. It transformed the country from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains, and prone to famine, to one largely able to feed itself, and becoming successful in achieving its goal of food security. Gandhi had a personal motive in pursuing agricultural self-sufficiency, having found India's dependency on the U.S. for shipments of grains humiliating.<ref>{{cite book|first=Maya|last=Chadda|title=Building Democracy in South Asia|location=London|publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]]|year=2000|page=150|isbn=978-1555878597}}</ref>\n\nThe economic period of 1967\u201375 became significant for its major wave of nationalisation amidst increased regulation of the private sector.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/>\n\nSome other objectives of the economic plan for the period were to provide for the minimum needs of the community through a rural works program and the removal of the privy purses of the nobility.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Both these, and many other goals of the 1967 programme, were accomplished by 1974\u201375.

She noted that her main problem in office was how to balance her political duties with tending to her children, and \"stressed that motherhood was the most important part of her life.\"<ref>Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993.

The Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship\". The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Gandhi supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that he intended to dislodge Gandhi, and the trio stood to prevent that. Gandhi's Congress party was soundly crushed in the elections.

The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and [[China]], rivals of the USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at the United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Before the war, Gandhi signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. They were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Gandhi was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept her from criticising the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Gandhi years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Gandhi, by the early 1980s, the Soviets had become India's largest trading partner.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short-lived liberalisation programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969. The government targeted growth at 5.7% while stating as its goals, \"growth with stability and progressive achievement of self-reliance.\"{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}}<ref name=\"Gupta\">{{Cite book| publisher = Deep and Deep Publications| page = 7|url={{Googlebooks|8D0iS_EF8_AC|page=PA7|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|isbn=978-8176295598| last = Gupta| first =  K.

This had been her first economic policy formulation, six months after coming to office. The programme emphasised greater state control of the economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Related to this point were a set of policies which were meant to regulate the private sector.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} By the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalisation process was complete, and India's policies were characterised as \"protectionist as ever.\"<ref name=\"Kirk\"/>\n\nTo deal with India's food problems, Gandhi expanded the emphasis on production of inputs to agriculture that had already been initiated by her father, Jawaharlal Nehru.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/> The [[Green Revolution in India]] subsequently culminated under her government in the 1970s. It transformed the country from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains, and prone to famine, to one largely able to feed itself, and becoming successful in achieving its goal of food security. Gandhi had a personal motive in pursuing agricultural self-sufficiency, having found India's dependency on the U.S. for shipments of grains humiliating.<ref>{{cite book|first=Maya|last=Chadda|title=Building Democracy in South Asia|location=London|publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]]|year=2000|page=150|isbn=978-1555878597}}</ref>\n\nThe economic period of 1967\u201375 became significant for its major wave of nationalisation amidst increased regulation of the private sector.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/>\n\nSome other objectives of the economic plan for the period were to provide for the minimum needs of the community through a rural works program and the removal of the privy purses of the nobility.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Both these, and many other goals of the 1967 programme, were accomplished by 1974\u201375.
