It tells the story of a small-town [[Indiana]] high school [[basketball]] team that wins the state championship. It is loosely based on the [[Milan High School (Indiana)|Milan High School]] team that [[1954 Milan High School basketball team|won the 1954 state championship]].\n\n[[Gene Hackman]] stars as Norman Dale, a new coach with a spotty past. The film co-stars [[Barbara Hershey]] and [[Dennis Hopper]], whose role as the basketball-loving town drunk earned him an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination. [[Jerry Goldsmith]] was also nominated for an Academy Award for his [[film score|score]].

He was hired by his longtime friend, principal Cletus Summers. Speaking with Summers, Dale thanks him for the opportunity and mysteriously mentions that he hopes things will work out for him this time.\n\nThe townspeople are passionate about basketball. They are upset because the best player in town, Jimmy Chitwood, has left the team to focus on his schoolwork. He also is still mourning the death of the previous coach. At a meet-and-greet, Dale tells the townspeople he used to coach college basketball and has been in the [[United States Navy]] for the past ten years. Fellow teacher Myra Fleener, who senses something negative in Dale's past, warns him not to try to persuade Jimmy to change his mind.\n\nThe school is so small that the Huskers have only seven players. At the first practice, Dale quickly dismisses Buddy Walker for rudeness, and Whit Butcher also walks out but later returns. Dale begins drilling the remaining five players (Rade Butcher, Merle Webb, Everett Flatch, Strap Purl, and manager Ollie McLellan) with fundamentals and conditioning but no scrimmages or shooting, much to the players' dismay.\n\nWith the team having worked on a four-pass offense, Dale remains committed to this approach in the opening game of the season, even when Rade disobeys him and repeatedly shoots successfully without passing. Dale benches him and, when Merle fouls out, refuses to let Rade return to the game, leaving his team with only four players on the floor. In a subsequent game, when an opposing player pokes Dale in the chest during an on-court argument, Rade jumps to his defense and hits the player. After the ensuing brawl, Cletus, who has been assisting Dale in coaching, suffers a mild heart attack.\n\nThe coach further alienates the community by having the team play with a slow, defensive style that does not immediately produce results and also by losing his temper, causing him to be [[ejection (sports)|ejected]] from multiple games.\n\nWith Cletus laid up, Dale invites knowledgeable former Husker Wilbur \"Shooter\" Flatch, Everett's alcoholic father, to join him on the bench as a new assistant. This too confounds the town, including Everett. Dale has one major requirement for Shooter: he must be sober at all times around the boys.\n\nBy the middle of the season, the townspeople decide to hold a meeting and vote on whether Dale should be dismissed. Before the meeting, Fleener tells Dale she has learned from an old newspaper article that he was banned from coaching years ago after hitting one of his players. At the meeting, Fleener starts to tell the townspeople what she found out, but she changes her mind and tells them to give Dale a chance. As the ballots are being counted, Jimmy enters and announces that he is ready to rejoin the team, but only if Dale remains as coach. The ballot count is reported, and it has gone against Dale, but everyone votes again, this time overwhelmingly choosing for Dale to stay.\n\nWith Jimmy back on the team, the reenergized Huskers rack up a series of wins. Along the way, Dale proves Shooter's value (to the townspeople and to Shooter himself) by intentionally getting himself ejected from a game and forcing Shooter to demonstrate his coaching ability. Shooter does just that by designing a play that helps Hickory win the game on a last-second shot.\n\nDespite a setback in which Shooter arrives drunk at a sectional playoff game and ends up in the hospital, the team advances through tournament play with contributions from unsung players, such as the pint-sized Ollie and devoutly religious Strap. Hickory reaches the state championship game in [[Indianapolis]].\n\nAt Butler Fieldhouse, and before a crowd bigger than any they have ever seen, the Hickory players face long odds to defeat the [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] Central Bears, whose players are taller and more athletic. But with Jimmy scoring at the last second, Hickory wins the 1952 state championship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Norman Dale\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Myra Fleener\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as Shooter Flatch\n* [[Sheb Wooley]] as Cletus Summers\n* [[Maris Valainis]] as Jimmy Chitwood\n* David Neidorf as Everett Flatch\n* [[Brad Long (actor)|Brad Long]] as Buddy Walker\n* [[Steve Hollar]] as Rade Butcher\n* Brad Boyle as Whit Butcher\n* Wade Schenck as Ollie McLellan\n* Kent Poole as Merle Webb\n* Scott Summers as Strap Purl\n* [[Fern Persons]] as Opal Fleener\n* [[Chelcie Ross]] as George Walker\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Basis==\n[[File:Milan1954.jpg|thumb|right|[[Milan High School (Indiana)|Milan High School]] Basketball Team, 1954.]] The film is very loosely based on the story of the [[1954 Milan High School basketball team|1954 Indiana state champions]], [[Milan High School (Indiana)|Milan High School]] ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|m|a\u026a|l|\u0259n}} {{respell|MY|l\u0259n}}), but the term \"inspired by a true story\" may be more appropriate, as there was little the two teams had in common.<ref name=reallife>{{cite web | title=  'Hoosiers' in reel life | url = http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020327.html | publisher= [[ESPN.com]] |accessdate= June 11, 2010|first= Jeff|last= Merron}}</ref>\n\nIn most U.S. states, high school athletic teams are divided into different classes, usually based on the number of enrolled students, with separate state championship tournaments held for each classification. At the time, Indiana conducted a single state basketball championship for all of its high schools and continued to do so until 1997.<ref name=reallife/>\n\nSome elements of the film do match closely with those of Milan's real story. Like the film's fictional \"Hickory High School,\" Milan was a very small high school in a rural, southern Indiana town. Both schools had undersized teams. Both Hickory and Milan won the state finals by two points: Hickory won 42\u201340, and Milan won 32\u201330. The final seconds of the ''Hoosiers'' state final hold fairly closely to the details of Milan's 1954 final; the final shot in the film was taken from virtually the same spot on the floor as [[Bobby Plump]]'s actual game-winner. The film's final game was shot in the same building that hosted the 1954 Indiana final, [[Butler University]]'s [[Hinkle Fieldhouse]] (called Butler Fieldhouse in 1954) in [[Indianapolis]].<ref name=reallife/>\n\nHowever, unlike the film's plot, the 1954 Milan High School basketball team came into the season as heavy favorites and finished the '53-'54 regular season at 19\u20132. In addition, the previous 1952\u20131953 team went to the state semi-finals, and they were considered a powerhouse going into the championship season despite the school's small enrollment.<ref name=reallife/>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Gymnasium in Knightstown.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Hoosier Gym|Hickory's gymnasium]]]]\nDuring filming in the autumn of 1985, on location at Hinkle Fieldhouse, directors were unable to secure enough extras for shooting the final scenes even after casting calls through the Indianapolis media. To help fill the stands, they invited two local high schools to move a game to the Fieldhouse. [[Broad Ripple High School|Broad Ripple]] and [[Bishop Chatard High School|Chatard]], the alma mater of [[Maris Valainis]] who played the role of Jimmy Chitwood, obliged, and crowd shots were filmed during their actual game. Fans of both schools came out in period costumes to serve as extras and to supplement the hundreds of locals who had answered the call. At halftime and following the game, actors took to the court to shoot footage of the state championship scenes, including the game-winning shot by Hickory.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nThe film's producers chose [[New Richmond, Indiana|New Richmond]] to serve as the fictional town of Hickory and recorded most of the film's location shots in and around the community. Signs on the roads into New Richmond still recall its role in the film. In addition, the old schoolhouse in [[Nineveh, Indiana|Nineveh]] was used for the majority of the classroom scenes and many other scenes throughout the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hoosiersarchive.com/behind-the-scenes-2/filming-locations-and-schedule/sites/|title=Sites {{!}} The Hoosiers Archive|website=hoosiersarchive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-13}}</ref>\n\nThe home court of Hickory is located in [[Knightstown, Indiana|Knightstown]] and is now known as the \"[[Hoosier Gym]].\"\n\nPizzo and Anspaugh shopped the script for two years before they finally found investment for the project. Despite this seeming approval, the financiers only approved a production budget of $6 million, forcing the crew to hire most of the cast playing the Hickory basketball team and many of the extras from the local community around New Richmond. Gene Hackman also predicted that the film was going to be a \"career killer.\" Despite the small budget, dire predictions, and little help from distributor [[Orion Pictures]], ''Hoosiers'' grossed over $28 million and received two Oscar nominations (Dennis Hopper for Best Supporting Actor and Jerry Goldsmith for Best Original Score).<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=5813889 ESPN the Magazine Movie Spectacular - An oral history of \"Hoosiers,\" an iconic sports movie - ESPN<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nShortly after the film's release, five of the actors who portrayed basketball players in the film were suspended by the [[NCAA]] from their real-life college basketball teams for three games.

Goldsmith used a hybrid of orchestral and electronic elements in juxtaposition to the 1950s setting to score the film. He also helped tie the music to the film by using recorded hits of basketballs on a gymnasium floor to serve as additional [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] sounds.<ref name=\"filmtracks\">[http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/hoosiers.html ''Hoosiers''] soundtrack review at [http://www.filmtracks.com Filmtracks.com]</ref> ''[[Washington Post]]'' film critic [[Paul Attanasio]] praised the soundtrack, writing, \"And it's marvelously (and innovatively) scored (by composer Jerry Goldsmith), who weaves together electronics with symphonic effects to create a sense of the rhythmic energy of basketball within a traditional setting.\"<ref name=\"Attanasio\" />\n\nThe score would go on to garner Goldsmith an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], though he ultimately lost to [[Herbie Hancock]] for ''[[Round Midnight (film)|Round Midnight]]''.  Goldsmith would later work with filmmakers Angelo Pizzo and David Anspaugh again on their successful 1993 sports film ''[[Rudy (film)|Rudy]]''.\n\nUntil 2012, the soundtrack was primarily available under the European title ''Best Shot'', with several of the film's cues not included on the album. In 2012, [[Intrada Records]] released Goldsmith's complete score, marking the first time the soundtrack has been released on CD in the United States.<ref name=\"intrada\">[http://store.intrada.com/s.nl/it.A/id.7919/.f ''Hoosiers''] soundtrack listing at [http://www.intrada.com Intrada.com]</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n''Hoosiers'' received positive reviews. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 89% based on reviews from 44 critics, with an average score of 7.5/10.

Angelo Pizzo, who wrote the original screenplay, knows small-town sports. He knows all about high school politics and how the school board and the parents' groups always think they know more about basketball than the coach does. He knows about gossip, scandal and vengeance. And he knows a lot about human nature. All of his knowledge, however, would be pointless without Hackman's great performance at the center of this movie. Hackman is gifted at combining likability with complexity \u2014 two qualities that usually don't go together in the movies. He projects all of the single-mindedness of any good coach, but then he contains other dimensions, and we learn about the scandal in his past that led him to this one-horse town. David Anspaugh's direction is good at suggesting Hackman's complexity without belaboring it.}}\n\nEbert closed his review with the comment, \"It's a movie that is all heart.\"<ref>Ebert, Roger.

It tells the story of a small-town [[Indiana]] high school [[basketball]] team that wins the state championship. It is loosely based on the [[Milan High School (Indiana)|Milan High School]] team that [[1954 Milan High School basketball team|won the 1954 state championship]].\n\n[[Gene Hackman]] stars as Norman Dale, a new coach with a spotty past. The film co-stars [[Barbara Hershey]] and [[Dennis Hopper]], whose role as the basketball-loving town drunk earned him an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination. [[Jerry Goldsmith]] was also nominated for an Academy Award for his [[film score|score]].

He was hired by his longtime friend, principal Cletus Summers. Speaking with Summers, Dale thanks him for the opportunity and mysteriously mentions that he hopes things will work out for him this time.\n\nThe townspeople are passionate about basketball. They are upset because the best player in town, Jimmy Chitwood, has left the team to focus on his schoolwork. He also is still mourning the death of the previous coach. At a meet-and-greet, Dale tells the townspeople he used to coach college basketball and has been in the [[United States Navy]] for the past ten years. Fellow teacher Myra Fleener, who senses something negative in Dale's past, warns him not to try to persuade Jimmy to change his mind.\n\nThe school is so small that the Huskers have only seven players. At the first practice, Dale quickly dismisses Buddy Walker for rudeness, and Whit Butcher also walks out but later returns. Dale begins drilling the remaining five players (Rade Butcher, Merle Webb, Everett Flatch, Strap Purl, and manager Ollie McLellan) with fundamentals and conditioning but no scrimmages or shooting, much to the players' dismay.\n\nWith the team having worked on a four-pass offense, Dale remains committed to this approach in the opening game of the season, even when Rade disobeys him and repeatedly shoots successfully without passing. Dale benches him and, when Merle fouls out, refuses to let Rade return to the game, leaving his team with only four players on the floor. In a subsequent game, when an opposing player pokes Dale in the chest during an on-court argument, Rade jumps to his defense and hits the player. After the ensuing brawl, Cletus, who has been assisting Dale in coaching, suffers a mild heart attack.\n\nThe coach further alienates the community by having the team play with a slow, defensive style that does not immediately produce results and also by losing his temper, causing him to be [[ejection (sports)|ejected]] from multiple games.\n\nWith Cletus laid up, Dale invites knowledgeable former Husker Wilbur \"Shooter\" Flatch, Everett's alcoholic father, to join him on the bench as a new assistant. This too confounds the town, including Everett. Dale has one major requirement for Shooter: he must be sober at all times around the boys.\n\nBy the middle of the season, the townspeople decide to hold a meeting and vote on whether Dale should be dismissed. Before the meeting, Fleener tells Dale she has learned from an old newspaper article that he was banned from coaching years ago after hitting one of his players. At the meeting, Fleener starts to tell the townspeople what she found out, but she changes her mind and tells them to give Dale a chance. As the ballots are being counted, Jimmy enters and announces that he is ready to rejoin the team, but only if Dale remains as coach. The ballot count is reported, and it has gone against Dale, but everyone votes again, this time overwhelmingly choosing for Dale to stay.\n\nWith Jimmy back on the team, the reenergized Huskers rack up a series of wins. Along the way, Dale proves Shooter's value (to the townspeople and to Shooter himself) by intentionally getting himself ejected from a game and forcing Shooter to demonstrate his coaching ability. Shooter does just that by designing a play that helps Hickory win the game on a last-second shot.\n\nDespite a setback in which Shooter arrives drunk at a sectional playoff game and ends up in the hospital, the team advances through tournament play with contributions from unsung players, such as the pint-sized Ollie and devoutly religious Strap. Hickory reaches the state championship game in [[Indianapolis]].\n\nAt Butler Fieldhouse, and before a crowd bigger than any they have ever seen, the Hickory players face long odds to defeat the [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] Central Bears, whose players are taller and more athletic. But with Jimmy scoring at the last second, Hickory wins the 1952 state championship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Norman Dale\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Myra Fleener\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as Shooter Flatch\n* [[Sheb Wooley]] as Cletus Summers\n* [[Maris Valainis]] as Jimmy Chitwood\n* David Neidorf as Everett Flatch\n* [[Brad Long (actor)|Brad Long]] as Buddy Walker\n* [[Steve Hollar]] as Rade Butcher\n* Brad Boyle as Whit Butcher\n* Wade Schenck as Ollie McLellan\n* Kent Poole as Merle Webb\n* Scott Summers as Strap Purl\n* [[Fern Persons]] as Opal Fleener\n* [[Chelcie Ross]] as George Walker\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Basis==\n[[File:Milan1954.jpg|thumb|right|[[Milan High School (Indiana)|Milan High School]] Basketball Team, 1954.]] The film is very loosely based on the story of the [[1954 Milan High School basketball team|1954 Indiana state champions]], [[Milan High School (Indiana)|Milan High School]] ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|m|a\u026a|l|\u0259n}} {{respell|MY|l\u0259n}}), but the term \"inspired by a true story\" may be more appropriate, as there was little the two teams had in common.<ref name=reallife>{{cite web | title=  'Hoosiers' in reel life | url = http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020327.html | publisher= [[ESPN.com]] |accessdate= June 11, 2010|first= Jeff|last= Merron}}</ref>\n\nIn most U.S. states, high school athletic teams are divided into different classes, usually based on the number of enrolled students, with separate state championship tournaments held for each classification. At the time, Indiana conducted a single state basketball championship for all of its high schools and continued to do so until 1997.<ref name=reallife/>\n\nSome elements of the film do match closely with those of Milan's real story. Like the film's fictional \"Hickory High School,\" Milan was a very small high school in a rural, southern Indiana town. Both schools had undersized teams. Both Hickory and Milan won the state finals by two points: Hickory won 42\u201340, and Milan won 32\u201330. The final seconds of the ''Hoosiers'' state final hold fairly closely to the details of Milan's 1954 final; the final shot in the film was taken from virtually the same spot on the floor as [[Bobby Plump]]'s actual game-winner. The film's final game was shot in the same building that hosted the 1954 Indiana final, [[Butler University]]'s [[Hinkle Fieldhouse]] (called Butler Fieldhouse in 1954) in [[Indianapolis]].<ref name=reallife/>\n\nHowever, unlike the film's plot, the 1954 Milan High School basketball team came into the season as heavy favorites and finished the '53-'54 regular season at 19\u20132. In addition, the previous 1952\u20131953 team went to the state semi-finals, and they were considered a powerhouse going into the championship season despite the school's small enrollment.<ref name=reallife/>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Gymnasium in Knightstown.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Hoosier Gym|Hickory's gymnasium]]]]\nDuring filming in the autumn of 1985, on location at Hinkle Fieldhouse, directors were unable to secure enough extras for shooting the final scenes even after casting calls through the Indianapolis media. To help fill the stands, they invited two local high schools to move a game to the Fieldhouse. [[Broad Ripple High School|Broad Ripple]] and [[Bishop Chatard High School|Chatard]], the alma mater of [[Maris Valainis]] who played the role of Jimmy Chitwood, obliged, and crowd shots were filmed during their actual game. Fans of both schools came out in period costumes to serve as extras and to supplement the hundreds of locals who had answered the call. At halftime and following the game, actors took to the court to shoot footage of the state championship scenes, including the game-winning shot by Hickory.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nThe film's producers chose [[New Richmond, Indiana|New Richmond]] to serve as the fictional town of Hickory and recorded most of the film's location shots in and around the community. Signs on the roads into New Richmond still recall its role in the film. In addition, the old schoolhouse in [[Nineveh, Indiana|Nineveh]] was used for the majority of the classroom scenes and many other scenes throughout the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hoosiersarchive.com/behind-the-scenes-2/filming-locations-and-schedule/sites/|title=Sites {{!}} The Hoosiers Archive|website=hoosiersarchive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-13}}</ref>\n\nThe home court of Hickory is located in [[Knightstown, Indiana|Knightstown]] and is now known as the \"[[Hoosier Gym]].\"\n\nPizzo and Anspaugh shopped the script for two years before they finally found investment for the project. Despite this seeming approval, the financiers only approved a production budget of $6 million, forcing the crew to hire most of the cast playing the Hickory basketball team and many of the extras from the local community around New Richmond. Gene Hackman also predicted that the film was going to be a \"career killer.\" Despite the small budget, dire predictions, and little help from distributor [[Orion Pictures]], ''Hoosiers'' grossed over $28 million and received two Oscar nominations (Dennis Hopper for Best Supporting Actor and Jerry Goldsmith for Best Original Score).<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=5813889 ESPN the Magazine Movie Spectacular - An oral history of \"Hoosiers,\" an iconic sports movie - ESPN<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nShortly after the film's release, five of the actors who portrayed basketball players in the film were suspended by the [[NCAA]] from their real-life college basketball teams for three games.

Goldsmith used a hybrid of orchestral and electronic elements in juxtaposition to the 1950s setting to score the film. He also helped tie the music to the film by using recorded hits of basketballs on a gymnasium floor to serve as additional [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] sounds.<ref name=\"filmtracks\">[http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/hoosiers.html ''Hoosiers''] soundtrack review at [http://www.filmtracks.com Filmtracks.com]</ref> ''[[Washington Post]]'' film critic [[Paul Attanasio]] praised the soundtrack, writing, \"And it's marvelously (and innovatively) scored (by composer Jerry Goldsmith), who weaves together electronics with symphonic effects to create a sense of the rhythmic energy of basketball within a traditional setting.\"<ref name=\"Attanasio\" />\n\nThe score would go on to garner Goldsmith an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], though he ultimately lost to [[Herbie Hancock]] for ''[[Round Midnight (film)|Round Midnight]]''.  Goldsmith would later work with filmmakers Angelo Pizzo and David Anspaugh again on their successful 1993 sports film ''[[Rudy (film)|Rudy]]''.\n\nUntil 2012, the soundtrack was primarily available under the European title ''Best Shot'', with several of the film's cues not included on the album. In 2012, [[Intrada Records]] released Goldsmith's complete score, marking the first time the soundtrack has been released on CD in the United States.<ref name=\"intrada\">[http://store.intrada.com/s.nl/it.A/id.7919/.f ''Hoosiers''] soundtrack listing at [http://www.intrada.com Intrada.com]</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n''Hoosiers'' received positive reviews. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 89% based on reviews from 44 critics, with an average score of 7.5/10.

Angelo Pizzo, who wrote the original screenplay, knows small-town sports. He knows all about high school politics and how the school board and the parents' groups always think they know more about basketball than the coach does. He knows about gossip, scandal and vengeance. And he knows a lot about human nature. All of his knowledge, however, would be pointless without Hackman's great performance at the center of this movie. Hackman is gifted at combining likability with complexity \u2014 two qualities that usually don't go together in the movies. He projects all of the single-mindedness of any good coach, but then he contains other dimensions, and we learn about the scandal in his past that led him to this one-horse town. David Anspaugh's direction is good at suggesting Hackman's complexity without belaboring it.}}\n\nEbert closed his review with the comment, \"It's a movie that is all heart.\"<ref>Ebert, Roger.

From our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects, the decisions that we are making now will define the type of nation\u2014and world\u2014that we leave to our children.

In Afghanistan, we will complete our transition to Afghan responsibility for that country's security. ... Beyond Afghanistan, we must define our effort not as a boundless \"global war on terror,\" but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America. In many cases, this will involve partnerships with other countries.\" Nevertheless, in the same speech, in a bid to emphasise the legality of military actions undertaken by the U.S., noting that [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|Congress had authorised]] the use of force, he went on to say, \"Under domestic law, and international law, the United States is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces.

But we have to recognize that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11. ... From our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects, the decisions that we are making now will define the type of nation\u2014and world\u2014that we leave to our children.

We have to be mindful of James Madison's warning that \"No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.\" ... In Afghanistan, we will complete our transition to Afghan responsibility for that country's security. ... Beyond Afghanistan, we must define our effort not as a boundless \"global war on terror,\" but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America. In many cases, this will involve partnerships with other countries.\" Nevertheless, in the same speech, in a bid to emphasise the legality of military actions undertaken by the U.S., noting that [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|Congress had authorised]] the use of force, he went on to say, \"Under domestic law, and international law, the United States is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces.

Taking advantage of a power vacuum in the center of the country, far from the major cities of Tripoli and Benghazi, ISIS expanded rapidly over the next 18 months. Local militants were joined by jihadists from the rest of North Africa, the Middle East, Europe and the Caucasus. The force absorbed or defeated other Islamist groups inside Libya and the central ISIS leadership in Raqqa, Syria, began urging foreign recruits to head for Libya instead of Syria. ISIS seized control of the coastal city of [[Sirte]] in early 2015 and then began to expand to the east and south. By the beginning of 2016, it had effective control of 120 to 150 miles of coastline and portions of the interior and had reached Eastern Libya's major population center, [[Benghazi]].

According to U.S. military estimates, ISIS ranks shrank to somewhere between a few hundred and 2,000 fighters. In August 2016, the [[Military intervention against ISIL#Intervention in Libya|U.S. military began airstrikes]] that, along with continued pressure on the ground from the Libyan militias, pushed the remaining ISIS fighters back into Sirte, In all, U.S. drones and planes hit ISIS nearly 590 times, the Libyan militias reclaimed the city in mid-December.<ref name=\"Did Obama Defeat ISIS in Libya\" /> On 18 January 2017, ABC News reported that two USAF [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 bombers]] struck two ISIS camps {{convert|28|mi}} south of Sirte, the airstrikes targeted between 80 and 100 ISIS fighters in multiple camps, an unmanned aircraft also participated in the airstrikes.

Given the long delays encountered by the [[Government of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico government]] in obtaining reasonable turnaround from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] test labs in [[Atlanta]] for samples submitted for testing, the Island government took the position that every suspicious case was to be treated as a COVID-19 case until test results were received, and ordered patients to be kept in isolation for 14 days. On March 12, one day before the first COVID-19 case case was confirmed, the governor declared a state of emergency and activated the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]] to help monitor travelers coming into the Island through its airports and cruise ship docks. In Section 6 of the bulletin, the citizens of Puerto Rico were put on a curfew allowing them to travel out of their homes from 5:00 a.m a 9:00 p.m for specific reasons such as to buy medicine, to visit a doctor or pharmacy, to buy groceries, or to care for a sick person. \n\nThe first cases of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in Puerto Rico were reported on March 13. They consisted of two Italian tourists and a 71-year-old cancer patient.

Given the long delays encountered by the [[Government of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico government]] in obtaining reasonable turnaround from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] test labs in [[Atlanta]] for samples submitted for testing, the Island government took the position that every suspicious case was to be treated as a COVID-19 case until test results were received, and ordered patients to be kept in isolation for 14 days. On March 12, one day before the first COVID-19 case case was confirmed, the governor declared a state of emergency and activated the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]] to help monitor travelers coming into the Island through its airports and cruise ship docks. In Section 6 of the bulletin, the citizens of Puerto Rico were put on a curfew allowing them to travel out of their homes from 5:00 a.m a 9:00 p.m for specific reasons such as to buy medicine, to visit a doctor or pharmacy, to buy groceries, or to care for a sick person. \n\nThe first cases of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in Puerto Rico were reported on March 13. They consisted of two Italian tourists and a 71-year-old cancer patient. The governor expressing concern that the curfew established on the 12th was not being followed took stronger actions and asked all non-essential businesses be closed as of March 15 through March 30.<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=https://www.elvocero.com/gobierno/gobernadora-decreta-toque-de-queda-por-el-coronavirus/article_e8c283a2-66c7-11ea-aea1-03a07fae93f0.html|title=Gobernadora decreta toque de queda por el coronavirus|last=Rivera Clementa|first=Yaritza|date=2020-03-15|website=El Vocero de Puerto Rico|language=es|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316013700/https://www.elvocero.com/gobierno/gobernadora-decreta-toque-de-queda-por-el-coronavirus/article_e8c283a2-66c7-11ea-aea1-03a07fae93f0.html|archive-date=March 16, 2020|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref><ref name=\"END Toque de Queda\">{{cite web|url=https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/wandavazquezdecretatoquedequedaparatodopuertoricoparacontenerelcoronavirus-2552934/|title=Wanda V\u00e1zquez decreta toque de queda para todo Puerto Rico para contener el coronavirus [Wanda V\u00e1zquez declares curfew for all of Puerto Rico to contain coronavirus]|date=2020-03-15|website=El Nuevo Dia|language=es-pr|access-date=2020-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320052615/https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/wandavazquezdecretatoquedequedaparatodopuertoricoparacontenerelcoronavirus-2552934/|archive-date=March 20, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The first death recorded was that of the 68-year-old Italian woman tourist; a few days later her husband was reported to have recovered from the virus.
