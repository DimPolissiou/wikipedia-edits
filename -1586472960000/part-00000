The school became fully co-educational in 1989. The school has also been pioneering in other fields, making a major contribution to the [[School Mathematics Project]] (from 1961) and initiating the teaching of Business Studies at [[Advanced Level (UK)|A level]] (from 1968). The traditional British boarding school system, known as [[fagging]], where junior pupils became personal servants to the senior boys was officially abolished in the 1920s, and Marlborough was one of the first public schools to do so.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} However, unofficial fagging did persist beyond this change for some time.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 1963 a group of boys, led by the future political biographer [[Ben Pimlott]], wrote a book, ''Marlborough, an open examination written by the boys'', describing life at the school. The writer and television critic [[T.C. Worsley]] wrote about predatory masters at the school in his critically acclaimed autobiography ''[[Flannelled Fool|Flannelled Fool: A Slice of a Life in the Thirties]]''.<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Worsley\n  | first = T.

She wrote to [[John Vickers]], the OFT director-general, saying, \"They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer.

No remains of the castle can be seen today. [[Radiocarbon dating]] of core samples in the early 2010s indicated that the origins of the Mound date from 2400 BC. This is close to the dates established for [[Silbury Hill]].<ref>[http://www.marlboroughcollege.org/about-us/college-history/the-mound/ ''The Mound''], Marlborough College website, retrieved August 11, 2016</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/leary334/ |title=The Giants of Wessex: the chronology of the three largest mounds in Wiltshire, UK |last1=Leary |first1=Jim |last2=Marshall |first2=Peter |publisher=Antiquity Journal Vol. 86, Issue 334 |date=December 2012 |accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe main focus of the college is the Court. This is surrounded by buildings in a number of different styles. At the south end is the back of an early 18th-century mansion, later converted to a [[coaching inn]] which was bought as the first building for the school.<ref>[http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=220683 Marlborough Castle House \u2013 Pastscapes], Historic England web site, retrieved August 11, 2016</ref> Next to it are the old stables, now converted into boarding houses. The west side consists of the 1959 red brick dining hall, and a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] boarding house now converted to other purposes. The north west corner is dominated by its Victorian [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style chapel by the architects [[George Frederick Bodley]] and [[Thomas Garner]] which has an interesting collection of [[pre-Raphaelite]] style paintings by [[John Roddam Spencer Stanhope]] and stained glass by Old Marlburian [[William Morris]].\n\nThe rest of the Court is surrounded by buildings in styles ranging from the \"[[Jacobethan]]\" (a name coined by Old Marlburian [[John Betjeman]]) to classical [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] prison. The latter, B house (now just called B1), was (along with the College Chapel) designed by the Victorian architect [[Edward Blore]], whose other works included the facade of Buckingham Palace (since remodelled) and the Vorontsovsky Palace in Alupka, Ukraine.<ref>[http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/marlborough_-_approved_statement.pdf ''Marlborough Conservation Area Statement \u2013 June 2003'', page 27], Wiltshire Council website, retrieved August 11, 2016</ref>\n\nOn the other side of the Mound is the Science laboratory, built in 1933. It is an early example of shuttered concrete construction and was listed as a building of architectural significance in 1970.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=1273152&resourceID=5 |title=Listing of the Science Block by English Heritage |publisher=Heritagegateway.org.uk |date=28 January 1971 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Houses==\nPupils are assigned to one of the [[House system|Houses]] on entering the school. This is where they make their home while at school. The Houses compete against one another in sports.\n\nThe Houses are divided into In-College Houses which are mostly gathered around the central Court, and Out-College Houses at sites around the western side of the town. Unusually, the older In-College Houses were not historically given names but were referred to by an [[alphanumeric]] title. Newer Houses have been given names reflecting their location or commemorating a figure from the school's past.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboroughcollege.org/boarding/houses/|title=Houses|website=Marlborough College|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n===Names of the houses===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

There were five out-college junior houses: Priory and Upcot which were both closed in 1967, Barton Hill which became an all-age in-college house in 1974, Hermitage which had closed in 1911 but reopened 1974\u201377, and Elmhurst which was closed in 1988 and reopened as a girls' house the following year. There were two in-college junior houses (A1 and A2) which shared A house; these were closed in 1989 and reopened as a girls' house renamed Morris House.\n\nAt the same time the other senior houses began to take in boys directly from prep schools \u2013 Preshute (1970), Cotton (1976), Littlefield (1977) and the in-college houses in 1989. B2 (which had shared B house with B1) and B3 ceased taking in new boys in 1989 and were both closed in 1992.\n\nWhen the College became fully co-educational in 1989, three girls' houses were opened \u2013 Morris, Elmhurst and Mill Mead; New Court was opened in 1991. Morris was moved in 1995 from A house to Field House, which had previously been occupied by B3 and C2. New houses were built to accommodate C3, which had previously shared C house with C1 (in 1989) and C2 (in 1992). In 2012, the College acquired the Ivy House Hotel in Marlborough High Street which opened as a girls' house in the autumn of that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marlboroughnewsonline.co.uk/marlborough-loses-out-in-the-battle-to-halt-colleges-ivy-house-hotel-takeover|title=Report on purchase by College|website=Marlboroughnewsonline.co.uk|accessdate=10 September 2017}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Southern Railway Schools class==\nIn 1933, the school lent its name to one of the steam locomotives in the [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway's]] [[SR V Schools class|Schools class]], which were named after English public schools.

Following World War II, the names of those killed in that war were added to a memorial panel in the entrance hall.\n\nThe hall is a semi-circular auditorium of stepped seats. There is a stage at the front. Below the seats with access from the outside rear are a number of music practice rooms. The fa\u00e7ade of the hall towards the forecourt and road has two entrance lobbies linked together by eight stone columns. The forecourt is paved with stone.\n\nThe Hall holds about 800 people so can no longer be used for assemblies of the entire school. It is now most often used for concerts and theatrical productions where the whole school is not expected to attend.\n\n===The Chapel===\n[[File:Marlborough College Chapel.jpg|thumb|College Chapel]]\n\nThe current Chapel is the second to be built at the school. The first was opened in 1848 but by 1880 the school numbers had outgrown its space. After consideration of expanding the existing building, it was demolished in 1884 and a new Chapel was designed and built.\n\nThe new Chapel, designed in the Late Decorated Gothic style, was dedicated to St Michael and All Angels and was consecrated in 1886. The original colour scheme of greens and browns was much loved by Sir [[John Betjeman]] and there are twelve large [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] murals by [[Spencer Stanhope]] which depict various Biblical scenes involving angels. Those on the north side show scenes from the Old Testament while the six on the south side are from the New Testament.\n\nTwo other artistic features are the Scholars' Window on the south side, which was designed by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and made by Old Marlburian [[William Morris]], and a sculpture of \"The Virgin and Child\" by [[Eric Gill]] near the west door.\n\nIn 2010, the Chapel was closed owing to structural defects. After being repaired, it was declared safe to use.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.marlboroughcollege.org/col_Chapel_closure.aspx |title=Notice of closure of the Chapel |publisher=Marlborough College |date=1 December 2008 |accessdate=16 November 2010 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719052236/http://www.marlboroughcollege.org/col_Chapel_closure.aspx |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===The Design Technology Centre===\n\nThe department has recently created an onsite design library with dedicated seating to encourage student use.\n\n===Music facilities===\n\n====Performance areas====\nAll music halls and performance areas are fitted with soundproof windows which prevent sound from escaping, even while open, as well as walls engineered to prevent sound crossing at right angles. The floors of the centres also float on a bed of air, so as to maintain good soundproofing.\n\n===The Blackett Observatory===\n[[File:MC-Blackett-Obs.jpg|thumb|The Blackett Observatory]]\nThe Blackett Observatory houses a 10-inch-aperture [[T. Cooke & Sons|Cooke]] [[refracting telescope|refractor]] on a motorised equatorial mount. The telescope dates from 1860 and was used professionally at the [[Radcliffe Observatory]] at [[Oxford University]]. When the Observatory was relocated to South Africa in the 1930s, Sir [[Basil Blackett (civil servant)|Basil Blackett]], a president of the Marlburian Club, raised the funds to purchase it and have the observatory built on the playing fields of the college.\n\nIn 1997 a restoration effort was started which was finished in 2002 when the telescope was reopened for use. It is currently used to teach astronomy and is also open to local astronomers from outside the college.\n\n===Sports facilities===\nA fully operational army-only [[Combined Cadet Force|CCF]] detachment operates at the college under the supervision of a resident SSI (school staff instructor).<ref>{{cite web|title=CCF|url=http://www.marlboroughcollege.org/co-curricular/ccf/|website=Marlborough College|accessdate=30 May 2017}}</ref> Weekly parades take place at the parade ground adjacent to the armoury, with occasional off-campus activities, such as range-days or overnight exercises.\n\nNext to the CCF parade ground is a six-lane .22 rifle range.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shooting|url=http://www.marlboroughcollege.org/sport/other-sports/shooting/|website=Marlborough College|accessdate=30 May 2017}}</ref> Rifle shooting has had a long history at the college, with teams representing the school since 1862.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bradley |first1=Arthur Granville |last2=Champneys |first2=Arthur Charles |last3=Baines |first3=John Ward |last4= |first4= |author-link4= |last5= |first5= |author-link5= |date= |year= |orig-year= |chapter= |title=History of Marlborough College During Fifty Years, from Its Foundation to the Present Time |location= |publisher=J.

The school became fully co-educational in 1989. The school has also been pioneering in other fields, making a major contribution to the [[School Mathematics Project]] (from 1961) and initiating the teaching of Business Studies at [[Advanced Level (UK)|A level]] (from 1968). The traditional British boarding school system, known as [[fagging]], where junior pupils became personal servants to the senior boys was officially abolished in the 1920s, and Marlborough was one of the first public schools to do so.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} However, unofficial fagging did persist beyond this change for some time.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 1963 a group of boys, led by the future political biographer [[Ben Pimlott]], wrote a book, ''Marlborough, an open examination written by the boys'', describing life at the school. The writer and television critic [[T.C. Worsley]] wrote about predatory masters at the school in his critically acclaimed autobiography ''[[Flannelled Fool|Flannelled Fool: A Slice of a Life in the Thirties]]''.<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Worsley\n  | first = T.

She wrote to [[John Vickers]], the OFT director-general, saying, \"They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer.

No remains of the castle can be seen today. [[Radiocarbon dating]] of core samples in the early 2010s indicated that the origins of the Mound date from 2400 BC. This is close to the dates established for [[Silbury Hill]].<ref>[http://www.marlboroughcollege.org/about-us/college-history/the-mound/ ''The Mound''], Marlborough College website, retrieved August 11, 2016</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/leary334/ |title=The Giants of Wessex: the chronology of the three largest mounds in Wiltshire, UK |last1=Leary |first1=Jim |last2=Marshall |first2=Peter |publisher=Antiquity Journal Vol. 86, Issue 334 |date=December 2012 |accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe main focus of the college is the Court. This is surrounded by buildings in a number of different styles. At the south end is the back of an early 18th-century mansion, later converted to a [[coaching inn]] which was bought as the first building for the school.<ref>[http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=220683 Marlborough Castle House \u2013 Pastscapes], Historic England web site, retrieved August 11, 2016</ref> Next to it are the old stables, now converted into boarding houses. The west side consists of the 1959 red brick dining hall, and a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] boarding house now converted to other purposes. The north west corner is dominated by its Victorian [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style chapel by the architects [[George Frederick Bodley]] and [[Thomas Garner]] which has an interesting collection of [[pre-Raphaelite]] style paintings by [[John Roddam Spencer Stanhope]] and stained glass by Old Marlburian [[William Morris]].\n\nThe rest of the Court is surrounded by buildings in styles ranging from the \"[[Jacobethan]]\" (a name coined by Old Marlburian [[John Betjeman]]) to classical [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] prison. The latter, B house (now just called B1), was (along with the College Chapel) designed by the Victorian architect [[Edward Blore]], whose other works included the facade of Buckingham Palace (since remodelled) and the Vorontsovsky Palace in Alupka, Ukraine.<ref>[http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/marlborough_-_approved_statement.pdf ''Marlborough Conservation Area Statement \u2013 June 2003'', page 27], Wiltshire Council website, retrieved August 11, 2016</ref>\n\nOn the other side of the Mound is the Science laboratory, built in 1933. It is an early example of shuttered concrete construction and was listed as a building of architectural significance in 1970.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=1273152&resourceID=5 |title=Listing of the Science Block by English Heritage |publisher=Heritagegateway.org.uk |date=28 January 1971 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Houses==\nPupils are assigned to one of the [[House system|Houses]] on entering the school. This is where they make their home while at school. The Houses compete against one another in sports.\n\nThe Houses are divided into In-College Houses which are mostly gathered around the central Court, and Out-College Houses at sites around the western side of the town. Unusually, the older In-College Houses were not historically given names but were referred to by an [[alphanumeric]] title. Newer Houses have been given names reflecting their location or commemorating a figure from the school's past.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboroughcollege.org/boarding/houses/|title=Houses|website=Marlborough College|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n===Names of the houses===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

There were five out-college junior houses: Priory and Upcot which were both closed in 1967, Barton Hill which became an all-age in-college house in 1974, Hermitage which had closed in 1911 but reopened 1974\u201377, and Elmhurst which was closed in 1988 and reopened as a girls' house the following year. There were two in-college junior houses (A1 and A2) which shared A house; these were closed in 1989 and reopened as a girls' house renamed Morris House.\n\nAt the same time the other senior houses began to take in boys directly from prep schools \u2013 Preshute (1970), Cotton (1976), Littlefield (1977) and the in-college houses in 1989. B2 (which had shared B house with B1) and B3 ceased taking in new boys in 1989 and were both closed in 1992.\n\nWhen the College became fully co-educational in 1989, three girls' houses were opened \u2013 Morris, Elmhurst and Mill Mead; New Court was opened in 1991. Morris was moved in 1995 from A house to Field House, which had previously been occupied by B3 and C2. New houses were built to accommodate C3, which had previously shared C house with C1 (in 1989) and C2 (in 1992). In 2012, the College acquired the Ivy House Hotel in Marlborough High Street which opened as a girls' house in the autumn of that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marlboroughnewsonline.co.uk/marlborough-loses-out-in-the-battle-to-halt-colleges-ivy-house-hotel-takeover|title=Report on purchase by College|website=Marlboroughnewsonline.co.uk|accessdate=10 September 2017}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Southern Railway Schools class==\nIn 1933, the school lent its name to one of the steam locomotives in the [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway's]] [[SR V Schools class|Schools class]], which were named after English public schools.

Following World War II, the names of those killed in that war were added to a memorial panel in the entrance hall.\n\nThe hall is a semi-circular auditorium of stepped seats. There is a stage at the front. Below the seats with access from the outside rear are a number of music practice rooms. The fa\u00e7ade of the hall towards the forecourt and road has two entrance lobbies linked together by eight stone columns. The forecourt is paved with stone.\n\nThe Hall holds about 800 people so can no longer be used for assemblies of the entire school. It is now most often used for concerts and theatrical productions where the whole school is not expected to attend.\n\n===The Chapel===\n[[File:Marlborough College Chapel.jpg|thumb|College Chapel]]\n\nThe current Chapel is the second to be built at the school. The first was opened in 1848 but by 1880 the school numbers had outgrown its space. After consideration of expanding the existing building, it was demolished in 1884 and a new Chapel was designed and built.\n\nThe new Chapel, designed in the Late Decorated Gothic style, was dedicated to St Michael and All Angels and was consecrated in 1886. The original colour scheme of greens and browns was much loved by Sir [[John Betjeman]] and there are twelve large [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] murals by [[Spencer Stanhope]] which depict various Biblical scenes involving angels. Those on the north side show scenes from the Old Testament while the six on the south side are from the New Testament.\n\nTwo other artistic features are the Scholars' Window on the south side, which was designed by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and made by Old Marlburian [[William Morris]], and a sculpture of \"The Virgin and Child\" by [[Eric Gill]] near the west door.\n\nIn 2010, the Chapel was closed owing to structural defects. After being repaired, it was declared safe to use.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.marlboroughcollege.org/col_Chapel_closure.aspx |title=Notice of closure of the Chapel |publisher=Marlborough College |date=1 December 2008 |accessdate=16 November 2010 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719052236/http://www.marlboroughcollege.org/col_Chapel_closure.aspx |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===The Design Technology Centre===\n\nThe department has recently created an onsite design library with dedicated seating to encourage student use.\n\n===Music facilities===\n\n====Performance areas====\nAll music halls and performance areas are fitted with soundproof windows which prevent sound from escaping, even while open, as well as walls engineered to prevent sound crossing at right angles. The floors of the centres also float on a bed of air, so as to maintain good soundproofing.\n\n===The Blackett Observatory===\n[[File:MC-Blackett-Obs.jpg|thumb|The Blackett Observatory]]\nThe Blackett Observatory houses a 10-inch-aperture [[T. Cooke & Sons|Cooke]] [[refracting telescope|refractor]] on a motorised equatorial mount. The telescope dates from 1860 and was used professionally at the [[Radcliffe Observatory]] at [[Oxford University]]. When the Observatory was relocated to South Africa in the 1930s, Sir [[Basil Blackett (civil servant)|Basil Blackett]], a president of the Marlburian Club, raised the funds to purchase it and have the observatory built on the playing fields of the college.\n\nIn 1997 a restoration effort was started which was finished in 2002 when the telescope was reopened for use. It is currently used to teach astronomy and is also open to local astronomers from outside the college.\n\n===Sports facilities===\nA fully operational army-only [[Combined Cadet Force|CCF]] detachment operates at the college under the supervision of a resident SSI (school staff instructor).<ref>{{cite web|title=CCF|url=http://www.marlboroughcollege.org/co-curricular/ccf/|website=Marlborough College|accessdate=30 May 2017}}</ref> Weekly parades take place at the parade ground adjacent to the armoury, with occasional off-campus activities, such as range-days or overnight exercises.\n\nNext to the CCF parade ground is a six-lane .22 rifle range.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shooting|url=http://www.marlboroughcollege.org/sport/other-sports/shooting/|website=Marlborough College|accessdate=30 May 2017}}</ref> Rifle shooting has had a long history at the college, with teams representing the school since 1862.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bradley |first1=Arthur Granville |last2=Champneys |first2=Arthur Charles |last3=Baines |first3=John Ward |last4= |first4= |author-link4= |last5= |first5= |author-link5= |date= |year= |orig-year= |chapter= |title=History of Marlborough College During Fifty Years, from Its Foundation to the Present Time |location= |publisher=J.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

It was first published in September 2007 by [[Akita Shoten]]. It started serialization in the ninth volume and was concluded in Volume 25 of [[Akita Shoten]]'s ''[[Sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]]'' manga magazine ''[[Champion Red]]''. An [[Original video animation|OVA]] adaptation by [[Hoods Entertainment]] was released with the third volume of the manga on December 17, 2008. A second OVA adaptation, called {{Nihongo|''Aki Sora ~Yume no Naka~''|\u3042\u304d\u305d\u3089\uff5e\u5922\u306e\u4e2d\uff5e}} was released by [[Pony Canyon]] in two parts; the first part released on July 30, 2009, and the second part released on November 17, 2009. In April 2010, Masahiro Itosugi announced that there will be no more printings of Volumes 1 and 3 due to [[Tokyo Metropolitan Ordinance Regarding the Healthy Development of Youths|Bill 156]].\n\n==Plot==\nEver since he was a young child, Sora Aoi had always exchanged words of \"I love you\" with his attractive older sister Aki. Now, as he comes of age, he finds it much harder to exchange such comforts as they did in those simpler times. When Aki demonstrates her feelings toward him to go beyond a sister's love, Sora finds himself questioning his feelings for his sister. Realizing their affection for one another, they consummate their love in secret. In a society that would never understand, they must now keep their love a secret from their family and everyone they know. However, Sora soon finds himself exploring many forms of love with different kinds of women he met that is not accepted by society thus questioning his feelings for his sister.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Aoi family===\n;{{Nihongo|Sora Aoi|\u8475 \u30bd\u30e9|Aoi Sora}}\n:{{Voiced by|Aya Saotome (drama CD),<ref name=\"ANN OVA\" /> [[Sayaka Kinoshita]] (OVA 1), [[Kumo Shiroi]] (Yume no Naka)}}\n:His first name is written as \u84bc\u7a7a (''S\u014dk\u016b'') in [[kanji]]. He studies in the same high school as his sisters, Aki and Nami. Unlike his sisters, he is good at cooking and housework. Sora has a low alcohol tolerance, as he falls unconscious by drinking even a little [[sake]]. \n:Due to his upbringing without a father or any male figure in the household, as well as questionably awkward relationships with his sisters, Sora was raised with virtually no masculinity of any kind. Almost all of his postures, behavior, and mannerisms are those typically expected from a shy girl. His effeminate appearance makes him a perfect candidate for [[cross-dressing]], which he finds himself engaging in involuntarily because of Nami's fetish and Runa's belief that he enjoys it. He is very shy and very much a pushover, and completely lacks the will to stand up for himself against girls, which further allows him to be forced to cross-dress and sexually approached. Indeed very much every girl around him is immediately privileged with the opportunity to rape him, which some of them did or attempted to undeterred by his discomfort and protests.\n:He is deeply in love with Aki, and does not resist her the second time she tries to have sex with him, but he does question himself at times whether their [[incest taboo]] should be continued, since they have no future in a relationship. He has also had sexual relationships with other people, such as Kana, Runa and Nami, though with the latter two he was forced. After being [[rape]]d by Nami, who then threatened Sora with [[emasculation]] and death if anything about the rape should ever be brought to light, he became terrified of her, but claimed that he does not hate her. They eventually rekindle their relationship when Nami asked for consensual sex, and had since then became more close. In the final chapters, Sora fully accepts his relationship with Aki, even defending it against their father. When Aki is taken away by their father, Sora is lonely and wants to see her again. After Aki chooses to go away so that Sora would not be hurt by their love, Sora is heartbroken and realizes that he truly loves Aki and wants to be with her. In the final chapter, they meet at their mother's grave.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aki Aoi|\u8475 \u30a2\u30ad|Aoi Aki}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Uchino Pochi]] (drama CD), [[Shiho Kawaragi]] (OVA 1), [[Hiroko Taguchi|K\u014dri Natsuno]] (Yume no Naka)}}\n:Aki is Sora's elder sister. Her first name is written as \u4e9c\u5e0c (''Aki'') in kanji. Attractive, athletic, and intelligent, she\u2019s considered a model student at school and is highly popular. However, at home, she has no culinary talents and fails to keep her own room clean. She is deeply in love with Sora. Unlike the rest of her family, all of whom have blond hair, Aki is a brunette. She first attempts to have sex with Sora in the shower, but is unsuccessful, as Sora runs out of the bath in embarrassment. However, her second attempt, in his room, is successful, after which she gives him a heart-felt confession of her love towards him. After that, they engage in sexual intercourse many times, including in public places, such as the school gym's storage locker, an [[onsen]], and on top of a [[ferris wheel]]. During these times, she does not want Sora to call her ''n\u0113san'' (elder sister), but Sora feels weird saying her name. She seems to be unaware that he has had sex with other women, other than herself. Sora's grades drop as a result of the distraction of his relationship with his sister. In response to this Aki refuses to have sex with him until his grades improve, and she cries at the thought of her flirting being the reason that Sora is doing poorly at school. After noticing how close Sora and Nami seem to be, Aki takes him out-of-town to spend some time together alone. However, on the train there, Sora seems to reject her advances. When she tries to seduce him again at the park, they almost get caught. Ultimately, they rekindle their romance in a love hotel. However, after their father's death, she decides that they should end their relationship so that Sora does not get hurt any further and says goodbye to him. They later meet up at their mother's grave.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Nami Aoi|\u8475 \u30ca\u30df|Aoi Nami}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kana Ueda]] (OVA 1),<ref name=\"ANN OVA\" /> [[Hiromi Igarashi]] (Yume no Naka)}}\n:Nami is Sora's younger [[Twin#Dizygotic twins|twin]] sister whose features are almost completely identical to his (though in the anime her eye color is red, while Sora's eyes are brown; also, her hair is slightly darker than Sora's). Due to their similar appearance, Nami ties her hair in pigtails. Her hair is slightly longer than Sora's when let down and this is the only noticeable physical difference between them aside from their gender. Like Sora, Nami has a low tolerance to alcohol. \n:When they were children, she'd often pretend to be Sora, but as they grew up, it became apparent that their personalities are polar opposites. Unlike the quiet and well-behaved Sora, Nami is blunt and can be incredibly stubborn and harsh, and also quite eerie and threatening towards her brother. For instance, she had a habit of smashing his toys when they were children out of jealousy, and often forces Sora to [[cosplay]] for her own amusement. She has a very strong disregard for Sora's feelings, demonstrated by how she deceived him into signing up for the cosplay club for further cross-dressing, despite his clear discomfort, and upon receiving his resignation letter, she immediately tore it up in front of him without consideration.\n:She's secretly in love with her classmate Kana, though the latter is completely oblivious of the fact. In spite of this, she's actively trying to get Kana and Sora together. These efforts, culminating with her bearing witness to Sora and Kana having sex together, backfire on her and drove her into a dangerously precarious state of mind. Guided by the belief that her being a female and thus lacking a penis is what keeps her and Kana separated she assaults Sora in a fit of psychotic rage and, after almost [[Penis removal|cutting off his penis]] and slitting his throat with a pair of scissors, she proceeds to rape him, fantasizing during the whole act that she is making love to Kana. She obtains his silence through a death threat, and since then Nami has repeatedly had sex with Sora, rekindling their relationship and becoming more intimate. While vocally expressing her disgust at the act, she is becoming more and more obsessed with it, especially right after he has sex with Kana, craving her scent. It is unknown if she herself is attracted to Sora, or having sex with him is a way to vent her frustration. She is, however, apparently regretful of what she has done to her brother, though this, coupled with their unhealthy relationship, is gnawing more and more at her already unbalanced psyche. Despite this, Aki has noted since then that the twins have become much closer to each other. Nami's relationship with Sora is later discovered by Kana, and the three end up having sex together, during which Nami's feelings towards Kana are finally revealed.\n\n;Aoi family mother (false)\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hana Aoyama]] (Yume no Naka)}}\n:The as-yet-unnamed mother of the Aoi family, who is actually Aki, Sora, and Nami's mother's identical younger twin sister (to be precise, their maternal aunt), but ever since her sister \u2014 the kids' real mother \u2014 was killed in a traffic accident ten years ago, she has taken over the role as mother. She took over the role of their mother, and  did not tell the twins that their real mother died. She is usually busy working to support the family, and is not there for them, leading them to learn to live for themselves. She is also somewhat irresponsible, giving Nami some sake, when she is clearly underage, and appears somehow aloof and indifferent, something that puzzled Sora more than once. There is a running gag where she is unable to tell Nami and Sora apart, even when they are naked. Every day, she thinks about whether she should live the role as a false mother, and thought of telling Sora and Nami the truth. Sora himself is starting to question her identity, as she often forgets or is even oblivious of things easily identified by their late mother. Nevertheless, after being questioned about it by Sora, she even went so far as to procure herself a scar on an arm so as to mimic the one her late sister had, much to Aki's regret. However, they noted that one day they will tell the truth to the twins. In the manga, she was portrayed to have blonde hair, but in the second OVA, she is a light brunette.\n\n;Aoi family mother (true)\n:The real unnamed mother of the three Aoi children, she died ten years ago, when she was hit by a car while returning home from shopping. Her role as mother was taken over by her younger twin sister, and only Aki knows about it. When she first gave birth to Aki, she felt the body was surprisingly light, and offered her sister a chance to hold the baby. She sustained a scar during one Christmas in a cooking accident, in which her left arm was burned while saving Sora from falling. Eventually, Sora came to know her death, when he visited her grave at the end.\n\n;Aoi family father\n:The unnamed father of the three Aoi children, who makes his appearance in Chapter 26. He is a big man with dark hair like Aki and is very scary-looking. He walked out on the family when the Aoi children were very young, hence why Sora and Nami do not want anything to do with him. He returns to take Aki to live with him. He caught Aki and Sora when they were making love and punished Sora for it. It is revealed that the mothers of the Aoi children (true and false) are, in fact, his identical twin sisters, having had children with one of them, but left his family because society did not accept this.

Kana and Nami are the only members of the cosplay club. She makes female outfits for Sora and Nami forces these outfits unto her brother. She has feelings for Sora but is too shy to confess them. She is unaware of Nami's feelings towards her. Even when Nami stated she loved her, Kana believed it meant because they were friends. After a date, at which Kana gave Sora a kiss and performed oral sex on him, Nami, who was witnessing from a cupboard, snapped, leading to her raping Sora. After some persuasion from Nami later, Kana loses her virginity to Sora, which Nami secretly records. It is vaguely expressed that Kana loved Nami after this, as Kana remembers the first time she had met with Sora, and believed it was fate, because she had the chance to love a boy who looked exactly like Nami. She later stumbles upon Sora and Nami's affair and joins them in three way, where Nami's feelings for Kana are eventually revealed.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Runa Satsuki|\u54b2\u6708 \u30eb\u30ca|Satsuki Runa}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Soyogi Tono]] (CD Drama), [[Ema Kogure|Runa Sakaki]] (CD Drama)}}\n:Runa is Sora's senior at school. Ever since being forced to walk home from school only wearing her [[school swimsuit]], she's been an exhibitionist.

She later forces Sora on a \"fetish\" date with her\u2014she is wearing only a raincoat, and he is in drag\u2014and forces him to masturbate to her masturbating. Later, she tricks Sora into going to a swap sex orgy with her, as her pretend-boyfriend. She loses her virginity as Sora watches; they held hands through random partners. During the summer break, she takes him to the pool having him wear a girl's bathing suit while she painted a swimsuit on her body, where she pleasures Sora for helping with her exhibitionism again. It is unknown whether she has any feelings for Sora, however she has stated that it is only \"good\" if he is the one to see her naked. Because of this she has not returned to the \"party\", even though asked many times. In the autumn, Runa returns as a nude [[Model (art)|art model]] for the art club.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Natsumi Nosaka|\u91ce\u5742 \u306a\u3064\u307f|Nosaka Natsumi}}\n:Natsumi is Sora's classmate. She attended the party that Hitomi had, and was one of the many girls to have set eyes on having sex with Sora. She felt a little annoyed when Sora had difficulty at remembering her at first sight at the party. She expressed slight resentment when she heard rumors from Nami that Sora and Kana were going out.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Alice Himekawa|\u59eb\u5ddd \u3042\u308a\u3059|Himekawa Arisu}}\n:{{Voiced by|Mutsuki Tsuyuko (CD Drama)}}\n:Alice is Aki's classmate. She is a beautiful girl with blond hair, girlfriend of Miharu Mihara, the school's student council president and self-proclaimed rival of Aki. As Alice is second place in the test results (under Aki), she tends to act distastefully towards Aki. Aki, however, is oblivious to this rivalry and considers themselves as friends, much to Alice's irritation. Due to this rivalry, when Miharu asked Sora to have sex with Alice to satisfy her in his (Miharu's) place, Alice was skeptical due to Sora being Aki's brother. Regardless, Alice loved Miharu dearly, and agreed to have sex with Sora, and even giving up her virginity to him. Later, all three play a fantasy game, in which Alice rapes Sora for real while Miharu watches.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yuna Asana|\u671d\u83dc \u30e6\u30a6\u30ca|Asana Y\u016bna}}\n:{{Voiced by|Sakura Ichinomiya (CD Drama)}}\n:Yuna is the president of the school's art club. She agreed to let Runa take over as a substitute for the nude model in class, but noticed that the boys were looking at her more than drawing, and got angry at it.

After this party, Hitomi invited Runa to return many times, but because Runa only felt good with Sora, she did not return.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Miharu Mihara|\u7f8e\u539f \u307f\u306f\u308b|Mihara Miharu}}\n:Miharu is Sora's childhood friend who used to live in the same apartment complex with the Aoi family. He is younger than Sora, and Sora addresses him as \"Mi-chan\", and would view him as a younger brother, were it not for Miharu's tendency to cross-dress as a girl. Miharu has an effeminate appearance, similar to Sora, but unlike Sora, he likes to cross-dress. He came to Sora's school in order to ask Sora to have sex with his girlfriend, Alice, because Miharu himself has [[erectile dysfunction]], in order to make Alice happy. Miharu is shameless, as he not only cross-dresses and asks his friend to take away his girlfriend's virginity, but also narrates about Alice and Sora having sex with vulgar phrases. He got over his conditions only when witnessing Alice and Sora having sex. However, once Sora leaves and it was his turn,  Miharu became ED again. Therefore, he asks Sora to take care of Alice.\n\n;{{nihongo|Ria Sumiya|\u6f84\u5f25 \u7406\u4e9c|Sumiya Ria}}\n:Kana's younger sister who appeared in Chapter 21 with their father to photograph Kana and Sora as wedding models.

He further comments, \"While we get a fair bit of upper body nudity, there\u2019s no genitalia involved for those that are looking for that aspect of it ... it\u2019s not hiding the sex, but it\u2019s also straddling the line in a way to try to appeal to more people while not going all hardcore.\"<ref name=\"Beveridge\">{{cite web|last=Beveridge |first=Chris |date=May 29, 2013 |url=http://www.fandompost.com/2013/05/29/aki-sora-hentai-anime-dvd-review/ |title=''Aki Sora'' Hentai Anime DVD Review|publisher=Famdom Post |accessdate=December 27, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portalbar|Anime and manga}}\n* [[A Wish of My Sister]] - previous hentai manga by the same author, which characters (Keisuke and his unnamed sister) are similar in appearance and actions with Sora and Aki\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{ann|manga|11149}}\n\n{{Hoods Entertainment}}\n{{Jukki Hanada}}\n\n[[Category:2008 manga]]\n[[Category:2009 anime OVAs]]\n[[Category:2010 anime OVAs]]\n[[Category:Akita Shoten manga]]\n[[Category:Anime Works]]\n[[Category:Hentai anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Hoods Entertainment]]\n[[Category:Incest in fiction]]\n[[Category:Sh\u014dnen manga]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2013}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Aki Sora\n| image           = Aki Sora Japanese Vol 1 Cover.JPG\n| caption         = Cover of the first volume of ''Aki Sora''\n| ja_kanji        = \u3042\u304d\u305d\u3089\n| ja_romaji       =\n| genre           = <!-- Note: Use and cite reliable sources to identify genre/s, not personal interpretation.

It was first published in September 2007 by [[Akita Shoten]]. It started serialization in the ninth volume and was concluded in Volume 25 of [[Akita Shoten]]'s ''[[Sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]]'' manga magazine ''[[Champion Red]]''. An [[Original video animation|OVA]] adaptation by [[Hoods Entertainment]] was released with the third volume of the manga on December 17, 2008. A second OVA adaptation, called {{Nihongo|''Aki Sora ~Yume no Naka~''|\u3042\u304d\u305d\u3089\uff5e\u5922\u306e\u4e2d\uff5e}} was released by [[Pony Canyon]] in two parts; the first part released on July 30, 2009, and the second part released on November 17, 2009. In April 2010, Masahiro Itosugi announced that there will be no more printings of Volumes 1 and 3 due to [[Tokyo Metropolitan Ordinance Regarding the Healthy Development of Youths|Bill 156]].\n\n==Plot==\nEver since he was a young child, Sora Aoi had always exchanged words of \"I love you\" with his attractive older sister Aki. Now, as he comes of age, he finds it much harder to exchange such comforts as they did in those simpler times. When Aki demonstrates her feelings toward him to go beyond a sister's love, Sora finds himself questioning his feelings for his sister. Realizing their affection for one another, they consummate their love in secret. In a society that would never understand, they must now keep their love a secret from their family and everyone they know. However, Sora soon finds himself exploring many forms of love with different kinds of women he met that is not accepted by society thus questioning his feelings for his sister.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Aoi family===\n;{{Nihongo|Sora Aoi|\u8475 \u30bd\u30e9|Aoi Sora}}\n:{{Voiced by|Aya Saotome (drama CD),<ref name=\"ANN OVA\" /> [[Sayaka Kinoshita]] (OVA 1), [[Kumo Shiroi]] (Yume no Naka)}}\n:His first name is written as \u84bc\u7a7a (''S\u014dk\u016b'') in [[kanji]]. He studies in the same high school as his sisters, Aki and Nami. Unlike his sisters, he is good at cooking and housework. Sora has a low alcohol tolerance, as he falls unconscious by drinking even a little [[sake]]. \n:Due to his upbringing without a father or any male figure in the household, as well as questionably awkward relationships with his sisters, Sora was raised with virtually no masculinity of any kind. Almost all of his postures, behavior, and mannerisms are those typically expected from a shy girl. His effeminate appearance makes him a perfect candidate for [[cross-dressing]], which he finds himself engaging in involuntarily because of Nami's fetish and Runa's belief that he enjoys it. He is very shy and very much a pushover, and completely lacks the will to stand up for himself against girls, which further allows him to be forced to cross-dress and sexually approached. Indeed very much every girl around him is immediately privileged with the opportunity to rape him, which some of them did or attempted to undeterred by his discomfort and protests.\n:He is deeply in love with Aki, and does not resist her the second time she tries to have sex with him, but he does question himself at times whether their [[incest taboo]] should be continued, since they have no future in a relationship. He has also had sexual relationships with other people, such as Kana, Runa and Nami, though with the latter two he was forced. After being [[rape]]d by Nami, who then threatened Sora with [[emasculation]] and death if anything about the rape should ever be brought to light, he became terrified of her, but claimed that he does not hate her. They eventually rekindle their relationship when Nami asked for consensual sex, and had since then became more close. In the final chapters, Sora fully accepts his relationship with Aki, even defending it against their father. When Aki is taken away by their father, Sora is lonely and wants to see her again. After Aki chooses to go away so that Sora would not be hurt by their love, Sora is heartbroken and realizes that he truly loves Aki and wants to be with her. In the final chapter, they meet at their mother's grave.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aki Aoi|\u8475 \u30a2\u30ad|Aoi Aki}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Uchino Pochi]] (drama CD), [[Shiho Kawaragi]] (OVA 1), [[Hiroko Taguchi|K\u014dri Natsuno]] (Yume no Naka)}}\n:Aki is Sora's elder sister. Her first name is written as \u4e9c\u5e0c (''Aki'') in kanji. Attractive, athletic, and intelligent, she\u2019s considered a model student at school and is highly popular. However, at home, she has no culinary talents and fails to keep her own room clean. She is deeply in love with Sora. Unlike the rest of her family, all of whom have blond hair, Aki is a brunette. She first attempts to have sex with Sora in the shower, but is unsuccessful, as Sora runs out of the bath in embarrassment. However, her second attempt, in his room, is successful, after which she gives him a heart-felt confession of her love towards him. After that, they engage in sexual intercourse many times, including in public places, such as the school gym's storage locker, an [[onsen]], and on top of a [[ferris wheel]]. During these times, she does not want Sora to call her ''n\u0113san'' (elder sister), but Sora feels weird saying her name. She seems to be unaware that he has had sex with other women, other than herself. Sora's grades drop as a result of the distraction of his relationship with his sister. In response to this Aki refuses to have sex with him until his grades improve, and she cries at the thought of her flirting being the reason that Sora is doing poorly at school. After noticing how close Sora and Nami seem to be, Aki takes him out-of-town to spend some time together alone. However, on the train there, Sora seems to reject her advances. When she tries to seduce him again at the park, they almost get caught. Ultimately, they rekindle their romance in a love hotel. However, after their father's death, she decides that they should end their relationship so that Sora does not get hurt any further and says goodbye to him. They later meet up at their mother's grave.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Nami Aoi|\u8475 \u30ca\u30df|Aoi Nami}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kana Ueda]] (OVA 1),<ref name=\"ANN OVA\" /> [[Hiromi Igarashi]] (Yume no Naka)}}\n:Nami is Sora's younger [[Twin#Dizygotic twins|twin]] sister whose features are almost completely identical to his (though in the anime her eye color is red, while Sora's eyes are brown; also, her hair is slightly darker than Sora's). Due to their similar appearance, Nami ties her hair in pigtails. Her hair is slightly longer than Sora's when let down and this is the only noticeable physical difference between them aside from their gender. Like Sora, Nami has a low tolerance to alcohol. \n:When they were children, she'd often pretend to be Sora, but as they grew up, it became apparent that their personalities are polar opposites. Unlike the quiet and well-behaved Sora, Nami is blunt and can be incredibly stubborn and harsh, and also quite eerie and threatening towards her brother. For instance, she had a habit of smashing his toys when they were children out of jealousy, and often forces Sora to [[cosplay]] for her own amusement. She has a very strong disregard for Sora's feelings, demonstrated by how she deceived him into signing up for the cosplay club for further cross-dressing, despite his clear discomfort, and upon receiving his resignation letter, she immediately tore it up in front of him without consideration.\n:She's secretly in love with her classmate Kana, though the latter is completely oblivious of the fact. In spite of this, she's actively trying to get Kana and Sora together. These efforts, culminating with her bearing witness to Sora and Kana having sex together, backfire on her and drove her into a dangerously precarious state of mind. Guided by the belief that her being a female and thus lacking a penis is what keeps her and Kana separated she assaults Sora in a fit of psychotic rage and, after almost [[Penis removal|cutting off his penis]] and slitting his throat with a pair of scissors, she proceeds to rape him, fantasizing during the whole act that she is making love to Kana. She obtains his silence through a death threat, and since then Nami has repeatedly had sex with Sora, rekindling their relationship and becoming more intimate. While vocally expressing her disgust at the act, she is becoming more and more obsessed with it, especially right after he has sex with Kana, craving her scent. It is unknown if she herself is attracted to Sora, or having sex with him is a way to vent her frustration. She is, however, apparently regretful of what she has done to her brother, though this, coupled with their unhealthy relationship, is gnawing more and more at her already unbalanced psyche. Despite this, Aki has noted since then that the twins have become much closer to each other. Nami's relationship with Sora is later discovered by Kana, and the three end up having sex together, during which Nami's feelings towards Kana are finally revealed.\n\n;Aoi family mother (false)\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hana Aoyama]] (Yume no Naka)}}\n:The as-yet-unnamed mother of the Aoi family, who is actually Aki, Sora, and Nami's mother's identical younger twin sister (to be precise, their maternal aunt), but ever since her sister \u2014 the kids' real mother \u2014 was killed in a traffic accident ten years ago, she has taken over the role as mother. She took over the role of their mother, and  did not tell the twins that their real mother died. She is usually busy working to support the family, and is not there for them, leading them to learn to live for themselves. She is also somewhat irresponsible, giving Nami some sake, when she is clearly underage, and appears somehow aloof and indifferent, something that puzzled Sora more than once. There is a running gag where she is unable to tell Nami and Sora apart, even when they are naked. Every day, she thinks about whether she should live the role as a false mother, and thought of telling Sora and Nami the truth. Sora himself is starting to question her identity, as she often forgets or is even oblivious of things easily identified by their late mother. Nevertheless, after being questioned about it by Sora, she even went so far as to procure herself a scar on an arm so as to mimic the one her late sister had, much to Aki's regret. However, they noted that one day they will tell the truth to the twins. In the manga, she was portrayed to have blonde hair, but in the second OVA, she is a light brunette.\n\n;Aoi family mother (true)\n:The real unnamed mother of the three Aoi children, she died ten years ago, when she was hit by a car while returning home from shopping. Her role as mother was taken over by her younger twin sister, and only Aki knows about it. When she first gave birth to Aki, she felt the body was surprisingly light, and offered her sister a chance to hold the baby. She sustained a scar during one Christmas in a cooking accident, in which her left arm was burned while saving Sora from falling. Eventually, Sora came to know her death, when he visited her grave at the end.\n\n;Aoi family father\n:The unnamed father of the three Aoi children, who makes his appearance in Chapter 26. He is a big man with dark hair like Aki and is very scary-looking. He walked out on the family when the Aoi children were very young, hence why Sora and Nami do not want anything to do with him. He returns to take Aki to live with him. He caught Aki and Sora when they were making love and punished Sora for it. It is revealed that the mothers of the Aoi children (true and false) are, in fact, his identical twin sisters, having had children with one of them, but left his family because society did not accept this. He eventually dies in a hospital from an unknown illness.\n\n===Classmates===\n;{{Nihongo|Kana Sumiya|\u6f84\u5f25 \u53ef\u5948|Sumiya Kana}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tae Okajima]] (OVA 1),<ref name=\"ANN OVA\" /> [[Ry\u014dko Ono#Video game casts|Nazuna Gogy\u014d]] (Yume no Naka)}}\n:Kana is Sora's classmate and Nami\u2019s best friend. Kana and Nami are the only members of the cosplay club. She makes female outfits for Sora and Nami forces these outfits unto her brother. She has feelings for Sora but is too shy to confess them. She is unaware of Nami's feelings towards her. Even when Nami stated she loved her, Kana believed it meant because they were friends. After a date, at which Kana gave Sora a kiss and performed oral sex on him, Nami, who was witnessing from a cupboard, snapped, leading to her raping Sora. After some persuasion from Nami later, Kana loses her virginity to Sora, which Nami secretly records. It is vaguely expressed that Kana loved Nami after this, as Kana remembers the first time she had met with Sora, and believed it was fate, because she had the chance to love a boy who looked exactly like Nami. She later stumbles upon Sora and Nami's affair and joins them in three way, where Nami's feelings for Kana are eventually revealed.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Runa Satsuki|\u54b2\u6708 \u30eb\u30ca|Satsuki Runa}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Soyogi Tono]] (CD Drama), [[Ema Kogure|Runa Sakaki]] (CD Drama)}}\n:Runa is Sora's senior at school. Ever since being forced to walk home from school only wearing her [[school swimsuit]], she's been an exhibitionist. Sora first meets her as she was changing bare in the elevator at their apartment complex. She mistakenly thinks Sora finds cross-dressing exciting. She later forces Sora on a \"fetish\" date with her\u2014she is wearing only a raincoat, and he is in drag\u2014and forces him to masturbate to her masturbating. Later, she tricks Sora into going to a swap sex orgy with her, as her pretend-boyfriend. She loses her virginity as Sora watches; they held hands through random partners. During the summer break, she takes him to the pool having him wear a girl's bathing suit while she painted a swimsuit on her body, where she pleasures Sora for helping with her exhibitionism again. It is unknown whether she has any feelings for Sora, however she has stated that it is only \"good\" if he is the one to see her naked. Because of this she has not returned to the \"party\", even though asked many times. In the autumn, Runa returns as a nude [[Model (art)|art model]] for the art club.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Natsumi Nosaka|\u91ce\u5742 \u306a\u3064\u307f|Nosaka Natsumi}}\n:Natsumi is Sora's classmate. She attended the party that Hitomi had, and was one of the many girls to have set eyes on having sex with Sora. She felt a little annoyed when Sora had difficulty at remembering her at first sight at the party. She expressed slight resentment when she heard rumors from Nami that Sora and Kana were going out.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Alice Himekawa|\u59eb\u5ddd \u3042\u308a\u3059|Himekawa Arisu}}\n:{{Voiced by|Mutsuki Tsuyuko (CD Drama)}}\n:Alice is Aki's classmate. She is a beautiful girl with blond hair, girlfriend of Miharu Mihara, the school's student council president and self-proclaimed rival of Aki. As Alice is second place in the test results (under Aki), she tends to act distastefully towards Aki. Aki, however, is oblivious to this rivalry and considers themselves as friends, much to Alice's irritation. Due to this rivalry, when Miharu asked Sora to have sex with Alice to satisfy her in his (Miharu's) place, Alice was skeptical due to Sora being Aki's brother. Regardless, Alice loved Miharu dearly, and agreed to have sex with Sora, and even giving up her virginity to him. Later, all three play a fantasy game, in which Alice rapes Sora for real while Miharu watches.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yuna Asana|\u671d\u83dc \u30e6\u30a6\u30ca|Asana Y\u016bna}}\n:{{Voiced by|Sakura Ichinomiya (CD Drama)}}\n:Yuna is the president of the school's art club. She agreed to let Runa take over as a substitute for the nude model in class, but noticed that the boys were looking at her more than drawing, and got angry at it. However, Runa correctly guessed that Yuna was aroused by the atmosphere. Runa later encourages her to have sex with Sora in order to overcome her embarrassment around nude males.\n\n===Others===\n;{{Nihongo|Hitomi Tomozaki|\u53cb\u5d0e \u3072\u3068\u307f|Tomozaki Hitomi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shiho Kawaragi|Kaname Yuzuki]] (CD Drama)}}\n:Hitomi is Runa's friend. She held the orgy party that Runa tricked Sora into going, and had her sight set on Sora at the party's start. She was the first one to have sex with Sora at the party, and her boyfriend was the one who took Runa's virginity. After this party, Hitomi invited Runa to return many times, but because Runa only felt good with Sora, she did not return.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Miharu Mihara|\u7f8e\u539f \u307f\u306f\u308b|Mihara Miharu}}\n:Miharu is Sora's childhood friend who used to live in the same apartment complex with the Aoi family. He is younger than Sora, and Sora addresses him as \"Mi-chan\", and would view him as a younger brother, were it not for Miharu's tendency to cross-dress as a girl. Miharu has an effeminate appearance, similar to Sora, but unlike Sora, he likes to cross-dress. He came to Sora's school in order to ask Sora to have sex with his girlfriend, Alice, because Miharu himself has [[erectile dysfunction]], in order to make Alice happy. Miharu is shameless, as he not only cross-dresses and asks his friend to take away his girlfriend's virginity, but also narrates about Alice and Sora having sex with vulgar phrases. He got over his conditions only when witnessing Alice and Sora having sex. However, once Sora leaves and it was his turn,  Miharu became ED again. Therefore, he asks Sora to take care of Alice.\n\n;{{nihongo|Ria Sumiya|\u6f84\u5f25 \u7406\u4e9c|Sumiya Ria}}\n:Kana's younger sister who appeared in Chapter 21 with their father to photograph Kana and Sora as wedding models. She hopes they will marry so that Nami can be her sister.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\nThe ''Aki Sora'' manga, written and drawn by Masahiro Itosugi, was serialized in [[Akita Shoten]]'s ''[[Champion Red Ichigo]]'' magazine between September 5, 2008 and April 5, 2011.
