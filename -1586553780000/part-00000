It was a celebrated [[maritime republic]] and today its coat of arms is depicted in the flag of the [[Italian Navy]]. In 1284, Genoa fought victoriously against the [[Republic of Pisa]] in the [[battle of Meloria]] for the dominance over the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], and it was an eternal rival of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] for dominance in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe republic began when [[Genoa]] became a self-governing [[medieval commune|commune]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] [[Kingdom of Italy (imperial)|Kingdom of Italy]], and ended when it was conquered by the [[French First Republic]] under [[Napoleon]] and replaced with the [[Ligurian Republic]]. Corsica was ceded to France in the [[Treaty of Versailles (1768)|Treaty of Versailles of 1768]]. The Ligurian Republic was annexed by the [[First French Empire]] in 1805; its restoration was briefly proclaimed in 1814 following the defeat of Napoleon, but it was ultimately annexed by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] in 1815.\n\n==Overview==\nBefore 1100, Genoa emerged as an independent [[city-state]], one of a number of [[Italian city-states]] during this period. Nominally, the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] was overlord and the [[Bishop of Genoa]] was president of the city; however, actual power was wielded by a number of \"[[consul]]s\" annually elected by [[popular assembly]]. Genoa was one of the so-called \"Maritime Republics\" (''[[Repubbliche Marinare]]''), along with [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]], [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]], [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]], [[Republic of Ancona|Ancona]] and [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]].<ref name =sea>G.

The Republic of Genoa extended over modern [[Liguria]] and [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]], [[Sardinia]], [[Corsica]], [[County of Nice|Nice]] and had practically complete control of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]. Through Genoese participation on the [[Crusades]], [[Genoese colonies]] were established in the [[Middle East]], in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], in [[Sicily]] and Northern [[Africa]].\n\nThe collapse of the [[Crusader States]] was offset by Genoa's alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. As Venice's relations with the Byzantine Empire were temporarily disrupted by the [[Fourth Crusade]] and its aftermath, Genoa was able to improve its position. Genoa took advantage of this opportunity to expand into the [[Black Sea]] and [[Crimea]]. Internal feuds between the powerful families, the [[House of Grimaldi|Grimaldi]] and [[Fieschi]], the [[Doria (family)|Doria]], [[Spinola Family|Spinola]], and others caused much disruption, but in general the republic was run much as a business affair.\n\nBetween 1218\u20131220 Genoa was served by the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] ''[[podest\u00e0]]'' [[Rambertino Buvalelli]], who probably introduced [[Occitan literature]] to the city, which was soon to boast such [[troubadour]]s as [[Jacme Grils]], [[Lanfranc Cigala]], and [[Bonifaci Calvo]]. Genoa's political zenith came with its victory over the [[Republic of Pisa]] at the naval [[Battle of Meloria (1284)|Battle of Meloria]] in 1284, and with a temporary victory over its rival, Venice, at the naval [[Battle of Curzola]] in 1298.\n\nThis prosperity did not last. The [[Black Death]] was imported into Europe in 1347 from the Genoese trading post at [[Caffa]] ([[Feodosiya|Theodosia]]) in Crimea, on the Black Sea. Following the economic and population collapse, Genoa adopted the Venetian model of government, and was presided over by a [[doge]] (see [[Doge of Genoa]]). The wars with Venice continued, and the [[War of Chioggia]] (1378\u20131381)\u2014where Genoa almost managed to decisively subdue Venice\u2014ended with Venice's recovery of dominance in the Adriatic.\n\nIn 1390 Genoa [[Barbary Crusade|initiated a crusade]] against the [[Barbary pirates]] with help from the French and laid siege to [[Mahdia]]. Though it has not been well-studied, the fifteenth century seems to have been a tumultuous time for Genoa. After a period of French domination from 1394\u20131409, Genoa came under rule by the [[Visconti of Milan]]. Genoa lost Sardinia to [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], Corsica to internal revolt and its Middle Eastern, Eastern European and Asia Minor colonies to the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\n[[File:Genova 1481 (copy 1597).jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A view of Genoa and its fleet by Christoforo de Grassi (1597 copy, after a drawing of 1481); Galata Museo del Mare, Genoa.]]\nGenoa was able to stabilize its position as it moved into the sixteenth century, particularly thanks to the efforts of [[Andrea Doria]], who established a new constitution in 1528, making Genoa a satellite of the [[Spanish Empire]]. Under the ensuing economic recovery, many aristocratic Genoese families, such as the Balbi, Doria, Grimaldi, Pallavicini, and Serra, amassed tremendous fortunes. According to Felipe Fernandez-Armesto and others, the practices Genoa developed in the [[Mediterranean]] (such as chattel slavery) were crucial in the exploration and exploitation of the New World.<ref>''Before Columbus: Exploration and Colonization from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, 1229-1492''.</ref> [[Christopher Columbus]], for example, was a native of Genoa and donated one-tenth of his income from the discovery of the [[Americas]] for [[Spain]] to the [[Bank of Saint George]] in Genoa for the relief of taxation on foods.\n\nAt the time of Genoa's peak in the 16th century, the city attracted many artists, including [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Caravaggio]] and [[Van Dyck]]. The architect [[Galeazzo Alessi]] (1512\u20131572) designed many of the city's splendid [[palazzo|palazzi]], as did in the decades that followed by fifty years [[Bartolomeo Bianco]] (1590\u20131657), designer of centrepieces of [[University of Genoa]]. A number of [[Genoese Baroque and Rococo artists]] settled elsewhere and a number of local artists became prominent.\n\n==Territories during the Middle Ages==\nAt the time of its founding in the early 11th century the Republic of Genoa consisted of the city of [[Genoa]] and the surrounding areas. As the [[commerce]] of the city increased, so did the territory of the Republic. By 1015 all of [[Liguria]] fell under the Republic of Genoa. After the [[First Crusade]] in 1098 Genoa gained settlements in [[Syria (region)|Syria]]. (It lost the majority of them during the campaigns of [[Saladin]] in the 12th century.) In 1261 the city of [[Izmir|Smyrna]] in [[Asia Minor]] became Genoese territory.<ref name=\"vas\"/>\n\nIn 1255 Genoa established the [[Genoese colonies|colony]] of [[Feodosiya|Caffa]] in [[Crimea]].<ref name=\"latorio\">{{cite book|author= William Miller |title= The Latin Orient |year= 2009 |pages= 51\u201354 |publisher= Bibliobazaar LLC|isbn= 1-110-86390-X}}</ref> In the following years the Genoese established further colonies in Crimea: [[Sudak|Soldaia]], [[Kerch|Cherco]] and [[Balaklava|Cembalo]].<ref name=\"latorio\"/> In 1275 the [[Byzantine Empire]] granted the islands of [[Chios]] and [[Samos]] to Genoa.<ref name=\"latorio\"/>\n\nBetween 1316 and 1332 Genoa established the [[Black Sea]] colonies of [[Azov|La Tana]] (present-day Azov) and [[Samsun]] in [[Anatolia]].

The [[Republic of Venice]] played a significant role in the [[Fourth Crusade]], diverting \"Latin\" energies to the ruin of its former patron and present trading rival, [[Constantinople]].

The Spanish, with their intramural allies, the \"old nobility\" entrenched in the mountain fastnesses behind Genoa, captured the city on May 30, 1522, and subjected the city to a merciless pillage. When the great admiral [[Andrea Doria]] of the powerful [[Doria (family)|Doria]] family allied with the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] to oust the French and restore Genoa's independence, a renewed prospect opened: 1528 marks the first loan from Genovese banks to Charles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrea-Doria-Genoese-statesman|title=Andrea Doria {{!}} Genovese statesman|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=2016-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThereafter, Genoa underwent something of a revival as a junior associate of the Spanish Empire, with Genovese bankers, in particular, financing many of the Spanish crown's foreign endeavors from their [[counting house]]s in Seville. [[Fernand Braudel]] has even called the period 1557 to 1627 the \"age of the Genovese\", \"of a rule that was so discreet and sophisticated that historians for a long time failed to notice it\" (Braudel 1984 p.&nbsp;157), although the modern visitor passing brilliant Mannerist and Baroque palazzo facades along Genoa's ''Strada Nova'' (now Via Garibaldi) or ''via Balbi'' cannot fail to notice that there was conspicuous wealth, which in fact was not Genovese but concentrated in the hands of a tightly-knit circle of banker-financiers, true \"[[venture capital]]ists\". Genoa's trade, however, remained closely dependent on control of Mediterranean sealanes, and the loss of [[Chios]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1566), struck a severe blow.<ref>Philip P. Argenti, ''Chius Vincta or the Occupation of Chios by the Turks (1566) and Their Administration of the Island (1566\u20131912), Described in Contemporary Diplomatic Reports and Official Dispatches'' (Cambridge, 1941), Part I.</ref>\n\nThe opening for the Genovese banking consortium was the [[National bankruptcy|state bankruptcy]] of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] in 1557, which threw the German banking houses into chaos and ended the reign of the [[Fugger]]s as Spanish financiers. The Genovese bankers provided the unwieldy Habsburg system with fluid credit and a dependably regular income. In return the less dependable shipments of American silver were rapidly transferred from Seville to Genoa, to provide capital for further ventures. The Genovese banker [[Ambrogio Spinola, marqu\u00e9s de los Balbases]], for instance, himself raised and led an army that fought in the [[Eighty Years' War]] in the Netherlands in the early 17th century. The decline of Spain in the 17th century brought also the renewed decline of Genoa, and the Spanish crown's frequent bankruptcies, in particular, ruined many of Genoa's merchant houses. In 1684 the city was [[Bombardment of Genoa|heavily bombarded by a French fleet]] as punishment for its alliance with Spain.\n\n===Decline===\nIn May 1625 a French-Savoian army briefly laid siege to Genoa.  Though it was eventually [[Relief of Genoa|lifted with the aid of the Spanish]], the French would later [[Bombardment of Genoa|bombard the city]] in May 1684 for its support of Spain during the [[War of the Reunions]].<ref>[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/17cen/genoa1684.html ''Genoa 1684''], World History at KMLA.</ref> In-between, a [[Naples Plague|plague]] killed as many as half of the inhabitants of Genoa in 1656\u201357.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/297474/Italy/27687/Early-modern-Italy-16th-to-18th-centuries Early modern Italy (16th to 18th centuries) \u00bb The 17th-century crisis] ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.''</ref> Genoa continued its slow decline well into the 18th century, losing its last [[Mediterranean]] colony, the island fortress of [[Tabarka]], to the [[Bey of Tunis]] in 1742.<ref>Alberti Russell, Janice.

Seeking protection from the rival [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], who sought to annex the Mark of [[Finale Ligure]] and cut the republic in half, Genoa reluctantly supported Bourbon France and Spain.  This decision would prove disastrous for Genoa, which later surrendered to the Austrians in September 1746 and was briefly occupied before a revolt liberated the city two months later.  The Austrians returned in 1747 and, along with a contingent of Sardinian forces, [[Siege of Genoa (1747)|laid siege to Genoa]] before being driven off by the approach of a Franco-Spanish army.\n\nThough Genoa retained its lands in the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle]], it was unable to keep its hold on [[Corsica]] in its weakened state.  After driving out the Genoese, the [[Corsican Republic]] was declared in 1755.  Eventually relying on French intervention to quash the rebellion, Genoa was forced to cede Corsica to the French in the 1768 [[Treaty of Versailles (1768)|Treaty of Versailles]].\n\n===French satellite===\nIn 1797 the Republic was occupied by the French revolutionary army of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who overthrew the old elites which had ruled the city for all of its history, and replaced them with a popular republic known as the [[Ligurian Republic]], under the watchful care of Napoleonic France. After Bonaparte's seizure of power in France, a more conservative constitution was enacted, but the Ligurian Republic's life was short\u2014in 1805 it was annexed by France, becoming the ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partements]]'' of [[Apennins]], [[G\u00eanes]], and [[Montenotte (department)|Montenotte]]. Following the capture of the city by British troops between 17 and 22 April 1814, local elites encouraged by the British agent [[Lord William Bentinck]] proclaimed the restoration of the old Republic, but it was decided at the [[Congress of Vienna]] that Genoa should be given to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. British troops suppressed the republic on 26 December 1814 and then evacuated the city, which Sardinia annexed on 7 January 1815.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Battle of Meloria (1284)]]\n* [[Battle of Curzola|Battle of Curzola (1298)]]\n* [[Battle of Ponza (1435)]]\n* [[Doge of Genoa]]\n* [[Genoese colonies]]\n* [[Maritime republics]]\n* [[Italian city-states]]\n* [[Christopher Columbus]]\n* [[Spanish Empire]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{Former monarchies Italian peninsula}}\n{{Repubbliche Marinare}}\n{{Crusader States}}{{Authority control}}\n{{coord|44.4108|N|8.9322|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Republic of Genoa| ]]\n[[Category:1797 disestablishments in Italy]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1005]]\n[[Category:Maritime republics|Genoa]]\n[[Category:11th-century establishments in Italy]]\n[[Category:Former republics]]\n[[Category:1005 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:1000s establishments in the Holy Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:Christian states|Genoa]]\n[[Category:Italian city-states]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1797]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox country\n| native_name                = {{ubl\n  |{{native name|it|Repubblica di Genova<br/>\"La Superba\"|nolink=y}}\n  |{{native name|lij|Rep\u00fabrica de Z\u00eana|nolink=y}}\n  }}\n| conventional_long_name                = Republic of Genoa\n| common_name                = Genoa\n| image_flag                = Flag of Genoa.svg\n| image_coat                = Coat of arms of Republic of Genoa.svg\n| image_map                = Genoese Holdings.png\n| image_map_caption                = The Republic of Genoa in the [[early modern period]]\n| government_type                = [[Oligarchy|Oligarchic]] [[merchant republic]]\n| year_start                = 1005\n| year_end                = 1815\n| life_span                = {{ubl|1005\u20131797|Apr 1814 \u2013 Jan 1815|item2_style=font-size:85%;}}\n| era                = {{ubl\n  |[[Middle Ages]]\n  |[[Early modern period]]\n  }}\n| event_start                = \n| date_start                = \n| event1                = [[Ligurian Republic|Disestablished]]\n| date_event1                = June 14, 1797\n| event2                = Re-established\n| date_event2                = April 26, 1814\n| date_end                = January 7\n| event_end                = [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Disestablished]]\n| p1                = Kingdom of Italy (imperial)\n| flag_p1                = Corona ferrea monza (heraldry).svg\n| border_p1                = no\n| flag_p2                = Flag of Genoa.svg\n| s1                = Ligurian Republic\n| flag_s1                = Flag of Genoa.svg\n| s2                = Kingdom of Sardinia\n| flag_s2                = Civil Flag and Civil Ensign of the Kingdom of Sardinia (1816-1848).svg\n| s3                = Corsican Republic\n| flag_s3                = Flag of Corsica.svg\n| national_motto                = {{lang|la|Respublica superiorem non recognoscens}}<br/>{{small|({{langnf||Latin|\"Republic that recognizes [lit.

It was a celebrated [[maritime republic]] and today its coat of arms is depicted in the flag of the [[Italian Navy]]. In 1284, Genoa fought victoriously against the [[Republic of Pisa]] in the [[battle of Meloria]] for the dominance over the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], and it was an eternal rival of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] for dominance in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe republic began when [[Genoa]] became a self-governing [[medieval commune|commune]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] [[Kingdom of Italy (imperial)|Kingdom of Italy]], and ended when it was conquered by the [[French First Republic]] under [[Napoleon]] and replaced with the [[Ligurian Republic]]. Corsica was ceded to France in the [[Treaty of Versailles (1768)|Treaty of Versailles of 1768]]. The Ligurian Republic was annexed by the [[First French Empire]] in 1805; its restoration was briefly proclaimed in 1814 following the defeat of Napoleon, but it was ultimately annexed by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] in 1815.\n\n==Overview==\nBefore 1100, Genoa emerged as an independent [[city-state]], one of a number of [[Italian city-states]] during this period. Nominally, the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] was overlord and the [[Bishop of Genoa]] was president of the city; however, actual power was wielded by a number of \"[[consul]]s\" annually elected by [[popular assembly]]. Genoa was one of the so-called \"Maritime Republics\" (''[[Repubbliche Marinare]]''), along with [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]], [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]], [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]], [[Republic of Ancona|Ancona]] and [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]].<ref name =sea>G. Benvenuti - Le Repubbliche Marinare. Amalfi, Pisa, Genova, Venezia - Newton & Compton editori, Roma 1989; Armando Lodolini, ''Le repubbliche del mare'', Biblioteca di storia patria, 1967, Roma.</ref> Trade, shipbuilding and banking helped support one of the [[Genoese Navy|largest and most powerful navies]] in the [[Mediterranean]].\n\nThe [[Adorno (family)|Adorno]], Campofregoso, and other smaller merchant families fought for power in this [[Republic]], as the power of the consuls allowed each family faction to gain wealth and power in the city. The Republic of Genoa extended over modern [[Liguria]] and [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]], [[Sardinia]], [[Corsica]], [[County of Nice|Nice]] and had practically complete control of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]. Through Genoese participation on the [[Crusades]], [[Genoese colonies]] were established in the [[Middle East]], in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], in [[Sicily]] and Northern [[Africa]].\n\nThe collapse of the [[Crusader States]] was offset by Genoa's alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. As Venice's relations with the Byzantine Empire were temporarily disrupted by the [[Fourth Crusade]] and its aftermath, Genoa was able to improve its position. Genoa took advantage of this opportunity to expand into the [[Black Sea]] and [[Crimea]]. Internal feuds between the powerful families, the [[House of Grimaldi|Grimaldi]] and [[Fieschi]], the [[Doria (family)|Doria]], [[Spinola Family|Spinola]], and others caused much disruption, but in general the republic was run much as a business affair.\n\nBetween 1218\u20131220 Genoa was served by the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] ''[[podest\u00e0]]'' [[Rambertino Buvalelli]], who probably introduced [[Occitan literature]] to the city, which was soon to boast such [[troubadour]]s as [[Jacme Grils]], [[Lanfranc Cigala]], and [[Bonifaci Calvo]]. Genoa's political zenith came with its victory over the [[Republic of Pisa]] at the naval [[Battle of Meloria (1284)|Battle of Meloria]] in 1284, and with a temporary victory over its rival, Venice, at the naval [[Battle of Curzola]] in 1298.\n\nThis prosperity did not last. The [[Black Death]] was imported into Europe in 1347 from the Genoese trading post at [[Caffa]] ([[Feodosiya|Theodosia]]) in Crimea, on the Black Sea. Following the economic and population collapse, Genoa adopted the Venetian model of government, and was presided over by a [[doge]] (see [[Doge of Genoa]]). The wars with Venice continued, and the [[War of Chioggia]] (1378\u20131381)\u2014where Genoa almost managed to decisively subdue Venice\u2014ended with Venice's recovery of dominance in the Adriatic.\n\nIn 1390 Genoa [[Barbary Crusade|initiated a crusade]] against the [[Barbary pirates]] with help from the French and laid siege to [[Mahdia]]. Though it has not been well-studied, the fifteenth century seems to have been a tumultuous time for Genoa. After a period of French domination from 1394\u20131409, Genoa came under rule by the [[Visconti of Milan]]. Genoa lost Sardinia to [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], Corsica to internal revolt and its Middle Eastern, Eastern European and Asia Minor colonies to the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\n[[File:Genova 1481 (copy 1597).jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A view of Genoa and its fleet by Christoforo de Grassi (1597 copy, after a drawing of 1481); Galata Museo del Mare, Genoa.]]\nGenoa was able to stabilize its position as it moved into the sixteenth century, particularly thanks to the efforts of [[Andrea Doria]], who established a new constitution in 1528, making Genoa a satellite of the [[Spanish Empire]]. Under the ensuing economic recovery, many aristocratic Genoese families, such as the Balbi, Doria, Grimaldi, Pallavicini, and Serra, amassed tremendous fortunes. According to Felipe Fernandez-Armesto and others, the practices Genoa developed in the [[Mediterranean]] (such as chattel slavery) were crucial in the exploration and exploitation of the New World.<ref>''Before Columbus: Exploration and Colonization from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, 1229-1492''.</ref> [[Christopher Columbus]], for example, was a native of Genoa and donated one-tenth of his income from the discovery of the [[Americas]] for [[Spain]] to the [[Bank of Saint George]] in Genoa for the relief of taxation on foods.\n\nAt the time of Genoa's peak in the 16th century, the city attracted many artists, including [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Caravaggio]] and [[Van Dyck]]. The architect [[Galeazzo Alessi]] (1512\u20131572) designed many of the city's splendid [[palazzo|palazzi]], as did in the decades that followed by fifty years [[Bartolomeo Bianco]] (1590\u20131657), designer of centrepieces of [[University of Genoa]]. A number of [[Genoese Baroque and Rococo artists]] settled elsewhere and a number of local artists became prominent.\n\n==Territories during the Middle Ages==\nAt the time of its founding in the early 11th century the Republic of Genoa consisted of the city of [[Genoa]] and the surrounding areas. As the [[commerce]] of the city increased, so did the territory of the Republic. By 1015 all of [[Liguria]] fell under the Republic of Genoa. After the [[First Crusade]] in 1098 Genoa gained settlements in [[Syria (region)|Syria]]. (It lost the majority of them during the campaigns of [[Saladin]] in the 12th century.) In 1261 the city of [[Izmir|Smyrna]] in [[Asia Minor]] became Genoese territory.<ref name=\"vas\"/>\n\nIn 1255 Genoa established the [[Genoese colonies|colony]] of [[Feodosiya|Caffa]] in [[Crimea]].<ref name=\"latorio\">{{cite book|author= William Miller |title= The Latin Orient |year= 2009 |pages= 51\u201354 |publisher= Bibliobazaar LLC|isbn= 1-110-86390-X}}</ref> In the following years the Genoese established further colonies in Crimea: [[Sudak|Soldaia]], [[Kerch|Cherco]] and [[Balaklava|Cembalo]].<ref name=\"latorio\"/> In 1275 the [[Byzantine Empire]] granted the islands of [[Chios]] and [[Samos]] to Genoa.<ref name=\"latorio\"/>\n\nBetween 1316 and 1332 Genoa established the [[Black Sea]] colonies of [[Azov|La Tana]] (present-day Azov) and [[Samsun]] in [[Anatolia]].

At the end of the 14th century the colony of Samastri was established in the Black Sea and [[Cyprus]] was granted to the Republic.

Genoa (along with Venice) succeeded in gaining a central position in the Mediterranean [[slave trade]] at this time. This left the Republic with only one major rival in the Mediterranean: Venice.\n\nGenoese Crusaders brought home a green glass goblet from the [[Levant]], which Genoese long regarded as the [[Holy Grail]]. Not all of Genoa's merchandise was so innocuous, however, as medieval Genoa became a major player in the slave trade.<ref>Steven A.

The [[Republic of Venice]] played a significant role in the [[Fourth Crusade]], diverting \"Latin\" energies to the ruin of its former patron and present trading rival, [[Constantinople]]. As a result, Venetian support of the newly established [[Latin Empire]] meant that Venetian trading rights were enforced, and Venice gained control of large portion of the commerce of the eastern Mediterranean.<ref name=\"vas\"/>\n\nIn order to regain control of the commerce, the Republic of Genoa allied with [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] [[Empire of Nicaea|Emperor of Nicaea]], who wanted to restore the Byzantine Empire by recapturing [[Constantinople]].

Besides the control of commerce in the hands of Genoese merchants, Genoa received ports and way stations in many islands and settlements in the [[Aegean Sea]].<ref name=\"vas\"/> The islands of [[Chios]] and [[Lesbos]] became commercial stations of Genoa as well as the city of [[Smyrna]] (Izmir).\n\n[[File:Repubblica di Genova.png|upright=1.35|thumb|Territories of the Republic of Genoa (economic influence areas shown in pink) around the mediterranean & Black Sea coasts, 1400, since the ''Codex Latinus Parisinus'' (1395).]]\nGenoa and Pisa became the only states with trading rights in the [[Black Sea]].<ref name=\"vas\"/> In the same century the Republic conquered many settlements in [[Crimea]], where the Genoese colony of [[Feodosiya|Caffa]] was established.

The Pisan fleet avoided combat, and tried to wear out the Genoese fleet during 1283. On August 5, 1284, in the naval [[Battle of Meloria]] the Genoese fleet, consisting of 93 ships led by [[Oberto Doria]] and [[Benedetto I Zaccaria]], defeated the Pisan fleet, which consisted of 72 ships and was led by Alberto Morosini and [[Ugolino della Gherardesca]].

The Sardinian town of [[Sassari]], which was under Pisan control, became a [[Medieval commune|commune]] which was controlled by Genoa. Control of Sardinia, however, did not pass permanently to Genoa: the Aragonese kings of Naples disputed control and did not secure it until the fifteenth century.\n\n[[File:Genoese fortress in Sudak.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|The Genoese fortress in [[Sudak]], [[Crimea]].]]\nGenoese merchants pressed south, to the island of Sicily, and into Muslim North Africas, where Genoese established trading colonies, pursuing the gold that traveled up through the Sahara and establishing Atlantic depots as far afield as [[Sal\u00e9]] and [[Safi, Morocco|Safi]].<ref>H.

The Spanish, with their intramural allies, the \"old nobility\" entrenched in the mountain fastnesses behind Genoa, captured the city on May 30, 1522, and subjected the city to a merciless pillage. When the great admiral [[Andrea Doria]] of the powerful [[Doria (family)|Doria]] family allied with the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] to oust the French and restore Genoa's independence, a renewed prospect opened: 1528 marks the first loan from Genovese banks to Charles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrea-Doria-Genoese-statesman|title=Andrea Doria {{!}} Genovese statesman|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=2016-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThereafter, Genoa underwent something of a revival as a junior associate of the Spanish Empire, with Genovese bankers, in particular, financing many of the Spanish crown's foreign endeavors from their [[counting house]]s in Seville. [[Fernand Braudel]] has even called the period 1557 to 1627 the \"age of the Genovese\", \"of a rule that was so discreet and sophisticated that historians for a long time failed to notice it\" (Braudel 1984 p.&nbsp;157), although the modern visitor passing brilliant Mannerist and Baroque palazzo facades along Genoa's ''Strada Nova'' (now Via Garibaldi) or ''via Balbi'' cannot fail to notice that there was conspicuous wealth, which in fact was not Genovese but concentrated in the hands of a tightly-knit circle of banker-financiers, true \"[[venture capital]]ists\". Genoa's trade, however, remained closely dependent on control of Mediterranean sealanes, and the loss of [[Chios]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1566), struck a severe blow.<ref>Philip P. Argenti, ''Chius Vincta or the Occupation of Chios by the Turks (1566) and Their Administration of the Island (1566\u20131912), Described in Contemporary Diplomatic Reports and Official Dispatches'' (Cambridge, 1941), Part I.</ref>\n\nThe opening for the Genovese banking consortium was the [[National bankruptcy|state bankruptcy]] of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] in 1557, which threw the German banking houses into chaos and ended the reign of the [[Fugger]]s as Spanish financiers. The Genovese bankers provided the unwieldy Habsburg system with fluid credit and a dependably regular income. In return the less dependable shipments of American silver were rapidly transferred from Seville to Genoa, to provide capital for further ventures. The Genovese banker [[Ambrogio Spinola, marqu\u00e9s de los Balbases]], for instance, himself raised and led an army that fought in the [[Eighty Years' War]] in the Netherlands in the early 17th century. The decline of Spain in the 17th century brought also the renewed decline of Genoa, and the Spanish crown's frequent bankruptcies, in particular, ruined many of Genoa's merchant houses. In 1684 the city was [[Bombardment of Genoa|heavily bombarded by a French fleet]] as punishment for its alliance with Spain.\n\n===Decline===\nIn May 1625 a French-Savoian army briefly laid siege to Genoa.

Seeking protection from the rival [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], who sought to annex the Mark of [[Finale Ligure]] and cut the republic in half, Genoa reluctantly supported Bourbon France and Spain.  This decision would prove disastrous for Genoa, which later surrendered to the Austrians in September 1746 and was briefly occupied before a revolt liberated the city two months later.  The Austrians returned in 1747 and, along with a contingent of Sardinian forces, [[Siege of Genoa (1747)|laid siege to Genoa]] before being driven off by the approach of a Franco-Spanish army.\n\nThough Genoa retained its lands in the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle]], it was unable to keep its hold on [[Corsica]] in its weakened state.  After driving out the Genoese, the [[Corsican Republic]] was declared in 1755.  Eventually relying on French intervention to quash the rebellion, Genoa was forced to cede Corsica to the French in the 1768 [[Treaty of Versailles (1768)|Treaty of Versailles]].\n\n===French satellite===\nIn 1797 the Republic was occupied by the French revolutionary army of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who overthrew the old elites which had ruled the city for all of its history, and replaced them with a popular republic known as the [[Ligurian Republic]], under the watchful care of Napoleonic France. After Bonaparte's seizure of power in France, a more conservative constitution was enacted, but the Ligurian Republic's life was short\u2014in 1805 it was annexed by France, becoming the ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partements]]'' of [[Apennins]], [[G\u00eanes]], and [[Montenotte (department)|Montenotte]]. Following the capture of the city by British troops between 17 and 22 April 1814, local elites encouraged by the British agent [[Lord William Bentinck]] proclaimed the restoration of the old Republic, but it was decided at the [[Congress of Vienna]] that Genoa should be given to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. British troops suppressed the republic on 26 December 1814 and then evacuated the city, which Sardinia annexed on 7 January 1815.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Battle of Meloria (1284)]]\n* [[Battle of Curzola|Battle of Curzola (1298)]]\n* [[Battle of Ponza (1435)]]\n* [[Doge of Genoa]]\n* [[Genoese colonies]]\n* [[Maritime republics]]\n* [[Italian city-states]]\n* [[Christopher Columbus]]\n* [[Spanish Empire]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{Former monarchies Italian peninsula}}\n{{Repubbliche Marinare}}\n{{Crusader States}}{{Authority control}}\n{{coord|44.4108|N|8.9322|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Republic of Genoa| ]]\n[[Category:1797 disestablishments in Italy]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1005]]\n[[Category:Maritime republics|Genoa]]\n[[Category:11th-century establishments in Italy]]\n[[Category:Former republics]]\n[[Category:1005 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:1000s establishments in the Holy Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:Christian states|Genoa]]\n[[Category:Italian city-states]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1797]]\n", "name_user": "SAYUL KOLKATA TEAM", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Genoa"}

A single chain of mountains makes up two-thirds of the island.\n\nThe island is an administrative [[region of France]] (with the regional capital being [[Ajaccio]]), divided in two administrative departments, [[Haute-Corse]] and [[Corse-du-Sud]]. The corresponding regional and departmental [[territorial collectivity|territorial collectivities]], however, merged on 1 January 2018, forming the [[single territorial collectivity]] of Corsica. As a single territorial collectivity, Corsica enjoys a greater degree of autonomy than other French regional collectivities; for example, the [[Corsican Assembly]] is able to exercise limited executive powers. [[Bastia]], the prefecture city of Haute-Corse, is the second largest town in Corsica.\n\nAfter being ruled by the [[Republic of Genoa]] since 1285, in 1755 Corsica became a self-proclaimed [[Italian language|Italian]]-speaking [[Corsican Republic|Republic]], until it was officially ceded by Genoa to [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] as part of a [[Treaty of Versailles (1768)|pledge for debts]] and subsequently [[French conquest of Corsica|annexed]] to France in 1769. [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] was born the same year in Ajaccio, and his ancestral home ([[Maison Bonaparte]]) is today a significant visitor attraction and museum. Due to Corsica's historical ties with the Italian peninsula, the island retains many [[Italian culture|Italian cultural]] elements, and the [[Corsican language|native tongue]] is recognized as a regional language by the French government.\n\n==History==\n===Prehistory and antiquity===\n{{Main|Prehistory of Corsica|History of Corsica|Medieval Corsica}}\n[[File:Corse-04812-\u00e9glise de Aregno.jpg|thumb|upright|The medieval influence of [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] in Corsica can be seen in the Romanesque-Pisan style of the [[Church of the Trinity and Saint John|Church of Aregno]].]]\nThe origin of the name Corsica is subject to much debate and remains a mystery.

After 26 years of struggle against the [[Republic of Genoa]] (plus an ephemeral attempt to proclaim in 1736 an independent Kingdom of Corsica under the German adventurer [[Theodore of Corsica|Theodor von Neuhoff]]), the independent [[Corsican Republic]] was proclaimed in 1755 under the leadership of Pasquale Paoli and remained sovereign until 1769, when the island was [[French conquest of Corsica|conquered by France]]. The first [[Corsican Constitution]] was written in Italian (the language of culture in Corsica until the middle of the 19th century) by Paoli.\n\nThe Corsican Republic was unable to eject the Genoese from the major coastal fortresses (Calvi and Bonifacio). After the Corsican conquest of [[Capraia]], a small island of the [[Tuscan Archipelago]], in 1767, the [[Republic of Genoa]], exhausted by forty years of fighting, decided to sell the island to France which, after [[France in the Seven Years War|its defeat in the Seven Years' War]], was trying to reinforce its position in the Mediterranean.  In 1768, with the [[Treaty of Versailles (1768)|Treaty of Versailles]], the Genoese republic ceded all its rights on the island. After an initial successful resistance culminating with the victory at [[Borgo, Haute-Corse|Borgo]], the Corsican republic was crushed by a large French army led by the [[No\u00ebl Jourda de Vaux|Count of Vaux]] at the [[Battle of Ponte Novu]]. This marked the end of Corsican sovereignty. Despite triggering the [[Corsican Crisis]] in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], whose government gave secret aid, no foreign military support came for the Corsicans. However, nationalist feelings still ran high. Despite the conquest, Corsica was not incorporated into the French state until 1789.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, Pasquale Paoli was able to return to Corsica from exile in Britain. In 1794, he invited British forces under [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Lord Hood]] to intervene to free Corsica from French rule. Anglo-Corsican forces drove the French from the island and established an [[Anglo-Corsican Kingdom]]. Following Spain's entry into the war, the British decided to withdraw from Corsica in 1796. Corsica returned to French rule.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Ajaccio, Corsica, France - Napoleon's Birthday Celebration 2006 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Corsicans commemorating the anniversary of the birth of [[Napoleon]]]] \nDespite being the birthplace of the Emperor, who had supported Paoli in his youth, the island was neglected by Napoleon's government.<ref>Howard, John E., ''Letters and Documents of Napoleon: Vol. 1 Rise to Power''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1961.</ref> In 1814, near the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Corsica was briefly occupied again by British troops. The [[Treaty of Bastia]] gave the British crown sovereignty over the island, but it was later repudiated by [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Lord Castlereagh]] who insisted that the island should be returned to a [[Bourbon Restoration|restored French monarchy]].\n\nAfter the restoration, the island was further neglected by the French state. Despite the presence of a middle class in Bastia and Ajaccio, Corsica remained an otherwise primitive place, whose economy consisted mainly of a subsistence agriculture, and whose population constituted a pastoral society, dominated by [[clan]]s and the rules of [[feud|vendetta]]. The code of vendetta required Corsicans to seek deadly revenge for offences against their family's honor. Between 1821 and 1852, no fewer than 4,300 murders were perpetrated in Corsica.<ref>{{cite book| url= https://archive.org/details/wanderingsincors01greg |title= Wanderings in Corsica: its history and its heroes| publisher= Thomas Constable and Company | first= Ferdinand |last= Gregorovius |year= 1855| page= [https://archive.org/details/wanderingsincors01greg/page/196 196]}}</ref> In this period a myth proved of interest as an historical fact by virtue of its being introduced by [[Herodotus]] and furthered by writers like [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]] and [[Ferdinand Gregorovius|Gregorovius]], of Corsica as having been populated by [[Arcadia (ancient region)#Arcadians|Arcadians]] ([[Oenotrians]] and citizens of [[Phocaea]]), fierce and loyal people. During the first half of the century, the people of Corsica belonged still to the Italian cultural world: the bourgeoisie sent children to [[University of Pisa|Pisa]] to study, official acts were enacted in Italian and most books were printed in Italian.<ref name=ra1124/> Moreover, many islanders sympathised with [[risorgimento|the national struggle]] which was taking place in nearby Italy in those years: several political refugees from the peninsula, like [[Niccol\u00f2 Tommaseo]], spent years in the island, while some Corsicans, like Count [[Leonetto Cipriani]], took active part in the fights for Italian independence.\n\nDespite all that, during those years the Corsicans began to feel a stronger and stronger attraction to France. The reasons for that are manifold: the knowledge of the French language, which thanks to the mandatory primary school started to penetrate among the local youth, the high prestige of French culture, the awareness of being part of a big, powerful state, the possibility of well-paid jobs as civil servants, both in the island, in the mainland and in the colonies, the prospect of serving the French army during the wars for the conquest of the colonial empire, the introduction of [[steamboat]]s, which reduced the travel time between mainland France from the island drastically, and \u2014 last but not least \u2014 Napoleon himself, whose existence alone constituted an indissoluble link between France and Corsica. Thanks to all these factors by around 1870 Corsica had landed in the French cultural world.<ref name=ra1124>Ravis-Giordani (1991), p. 112\u201314</ref>\n\nFrom the 19th century into the mid-20th century, Corsicans also grew closer to the French nation through participation in the French Empire. Compared to much of Metropolitan France, Corsica was poor and many Corsicans emigrated. While Corsicans emigrated globally, especially to many South American countries, many chose to move within the French Empire which acted as a conduit for emigration and eventual return, as many young Corsican men could find better job opportunities in the far corners of the Empire where many other French hesitated to go. In many parts of the Empire, Corsicans were strongly represented, such as in [[Saigon]] where in 1926 12% of European were from Corsica.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Echo de la Corse |date= May\u2013June 1929 |title=Inepuissable pepiniere de soldats et de coloniaux |journal=Saigon-Cyrnos: Bulletin de l'Amicale Corse de la Cochinchine et du Cambodge |volume=43 |pages= 13\u201314}}</ref> Across the French Empire, many Corsicans retained a sense of community by establishing organizations where they would meet regularly, keep one another informed of developments in Corsica, and come to one anothers\u2019 aid in times of need.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Guelfi |first= A.D. |date= April 1931 |title=Les Corses hors de Corse partout presents toujours unis |journal= Saigon-Cyrnos: Bulletin de l'Amicale Corse de la Cochinchine et du Cambodge |volume=58 |pages=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\n===Modern Corsica===\n[[File:Monument-Solaro.jpg|thumb|Monument to the [[French Resistance]] during WWII in [[Solaro, Haute-Corse|Solaro]] (plaine orientale)]]\nCorsica paid a high price for the French victory in the First World War: agriculture was disrupted by the years-long absence of almost all of the young workers, and the percentage of dead or wounded Corsicans in the conflict was double that of those from metropolitan France. Moreover, the protectionist policies of the French government, started in the 1880s and never stopped, had ruined the Corsican export of wine and olive oil, and forced many young Corsicans to emigrate to mainland France or to the Americas. As reaction to these conditions, a nationalist movement was born in the 1920s around the newspaper ''A Muvra'', having as its objective the autonomy of the island from France. In the 1930s, many exponents of this movement became [[Italian irredentism|irredentist]], seeing annexation of the island to fascist Italy as the only solution to its problems. Under [[Benito Mussolini]] annexation of Corsica had become one of the main goals of Italy's unification policy.\n\nAfter the collapse of France to the German [[Wehrmacht]] in 1940, Corsica came under the rule of the [[Vichy French]] regime, which was collaborating with [[Nazi Germany]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Az\u00e9ma|first1=Jean-Pierre|last2=Wieviorka|first2=Olivier|title=Vichy, 1940-44| date= 1997| publisher= Perrin| location=Paris|pages=231\u201333|language=French}}</ref> In November 1942 the island, following the [[Operation Torch|Anglo-American landings in North Africa]] was [[Italian occupation of Corsica|occupied by Italian and German forces]].

Tensions escalated until an armed police assault on a pieds-noirs-owned wine cellar in [[Aleria]], occupied by Corsican nationalists on 23 August 1975. This marked the beginning of the armed nationalist struggle against the French government. Ever since, [[Corsican nationalism]] has been a feature of the island's politics, with calls for greater autonomy and protection for Corsican culture and the [[Corsican language]]. Periodic flare-ups of raids and killings culminated in the assassination of Prefect [[Claude \u00c9rignac]] in 1998.\n\nIn 2013, Corsica hosted the first three stages of the 100th [[2013 Tour de France|Tour de France]], which passed through the island for the first time in the event's 110-year history.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Corsica-calvi-panorama.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2.75|The Bay of [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]]: Corsica is the most mountainous Mediterranean island.]]\n[[File:Speloncato general view.jpg|thumb|A view of [[Speloncato]]]]\n[[File:Corsica-geographic map-en.svg|thumb|Geographic map of Corsica]]\nCorsica was formed about 250 million years ago with the uplift of a [[granite]] backbone on the western side.

This zone is uninhabited.\n\n===Zones by region===\n{{empty section|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Parc Naturel R\u00e9gional de Corse===\nThe island has a natural park ([[Parc Naturel R\u00e9gional de Corse]], Parcu di Corsica), which protects rare animal and plant species. The Park was created in 1972 and includes the Golfe de Porto, the [[Scandola Nature Reserve]] (a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]), and some of the highest mountains on the island. Scandola cannot be reached on foot, but people can gain access by boat from the village of Gal\u00e9ria and Porto (Ota). Two endangered subspecies of hoofed mammals, the [[mouflon]] (''Ovis aries musimon'') and [[Corsican red deer]] (''Cervus elaphus corsicanus'') inhabit the park. The Corsican red deer was re-introduced after it was extinct due to over hunting. This Corsican subspecies was the same that survived on Sardinia, so it is [[Endemism|endemic]]. There are other species endemic to Corsica especially in the upper mountain ranges, i.e. [[Corsican nuthatch]], [[Corsican fire salamander]] and [[Corsican brook salamander]] and many plant subspecies.\n\n===Extinct animals===\nCorsica, like all the other Mediterranean islands, was home to indigenous animals of the [[Pleistocene]], some endemic to it and some coming to it and [[Sardinia]] (as Sardinia was joined to Corsica for much of the Pleistocene). After the proliferation of humans in the [[Mesolithic]], these began to disappear, partly from extinction of the species, and partly from eradication only in Corsica. However, it is now known that many species managed to survive the Mesolithic, and many were still present well into recorded history.<ref>{{cite book|title=Extinctions in Near Time: Causes, Contexts, and Consequences|year=1999|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-306-46092-0|first=R.D.E.|last=MacPhee|author2=Hans-Dieter Sues|page=179}}</ref>\n\nThe globally extinct species are the [[Sardinian dhole]], ''[[Megaloceros cazioti]]'', [[Corsican giant shrew]], [[Tyrrhenian mole]], [[Sardinian pika]], [[Corsican-Sardinian vole]], [[Corsican-Sardinian wood mouse]], ''[[Bubo insularis]]'' and ''[[Athene angelis]]''.

[[Corsican language|Corsican]] (''Corsu''), a [[minority language]] that is closely related to medieval [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]] (''Toscano''), has a better prospect of survival than most other [[Languages in France|French regional languages]]: Corsican is in fact, after [[French language|French]] (''Fran\u00e7ais''), the most widely spoken language on the island. However, since the annexation of the island by France in the 18th century, Corsican has been under heavy pressure from French, and today it is estimated that only 10% of Corsica's population speak the language natively, with only 50% having some sort of proficiency in it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/homean/index1.html |title=Euromosaic-Index1 |publisher= Open University of Catalonia | website= uoc.edu |accessdate=2012-10-27}}</ref>\n\nThe language is divided into two main varieties: ''Cismuntanu'' and ''Ultramuntanu'', spoken respectively northeast and southwest of the Girolata - [[Porto Vecchio]] line. This division was due to the massive immigration from Tuscany which took place in Corsica during the lower Middle Ages: as a result, the ''Cismuntanu'' became very similar to the Tuscan dialects, being part of the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian language group]], while the ''Ultramuntanu'' could keep its original characteristics which make it much more similar to a [[Southern Romance languages|Southern Romance language]] like [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] (''Sardu'').<ref>{{Cite book|title=Italia dialettale | first= Giulio| last= Bertoni| year= 1916| publisher= Hoepli|location=Milano|language=Italian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Il linguaggio d'Italia|first=Giacomo|last= Devoto |authorlink=Giacomo Devoto|year= 1974|publisher=Rizzoli|location=Milano|language=Italian}}</ref> Therefore, due to the differences between the main dialectal varieties, many linguists classify Corsican as an Italo-Dalmatian language,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Romance Languages|first=Martin |last= Harris|first2= Nigel| last2= Vincent|year= 1997|isbn=0-415-16417-6|publisher=Routlegde|location=London}}</ref> while others consider it a Southern Romance one.<ref>{{cite web |editor=Nordhoff, Sebastian |editor2=Hammarstr\u00f6m, Harald |editor3=Forkel, Robert |editor4=Haspelmath, Martin |year=2013 |title=Subfamily: Italo-Dalmatian |website=Glottolog 2.2 |url=http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/ital1286}}</ref>\n\nFewer and fewer people speak a [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian dialect]], known as ''bunifazzinu'',<ref>[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/dialetti-liguri_%28Enciclopedia-dell%27Italiano%29/ Enciclopedia Treccani - Dialetti liguri]</ref> in what has long been a [[language island]], [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]], and in [[Ajaccio]], the ''aghjaccinu'' dialect.

Game such as wild boar (''Cingale'', ''Singhjari'') is popular. There also is seafood and river fish such as trout. Delicacies such as ''figatellu'' (also named as ''ficateddu''), made with liver, ''coppa'', ham (''prizuttu''), ''lonzu'' are made from Corsican pork (''porcu nustrale''). Characteristic among the cheeses is ''[[brocciu]]'' (similar to ricotta), which is used as a fresh ingredient in many dishes, from first courses (''[[Strozzapreti#Corsican Strozzapreti|sturzapreti]]'') to cakes (''[[fiadone]]''). Other cheeses, like ''casgiu merzu'' (\"rotten cheese\", the Corsican counterpart of the [[Sardinia]]n ''[[casu marzu]]''), ''casgiu veghju'' are made from goat or sheep milk. Chestnuts are the main ingredient in the making of ''pulenta castagnina'' and cakes (''[[falculelle]]''). A variety of alcohol also exists ranging from ''aquavita'' (brandy), red and white [[Corsica wine|Corsican wines]] (''Vinu Corsu''), muscat wine (plain or sparkling), and the famous \"Cap Corse\" ap\u00e9ritif produced by Mattei. The herbs which are part of [[Maquis shrubland|Maquis]] ({{lang-co|machja}}) and the chestnuts and oak nuts of the Corsican forests are eaten by local animals, resulting in the noticeable taste in the food there.\n\n===Art===\n{{See also|Music of Corsica}}\nCorsica has produced a number of known artists: \n* [[Aliz\u00e9e]]\n* [[Martha Angelici]] (opera singer)\n* [[A Filetta]] (polyphonic chant group)\n* [[:fr:Canta U Populu Corsu|Canta U Populu Corsu]] (band)\n* [[Laetitia Casta]] (model/actress)\n* [[Baptiste Giabiconi]] (model/singer)\n* [[:fr:Julien de Casabianca-Caumer|Julien de Casabianca]] (cineast)\n* [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Ferrari]] (writer)\n* [[Patrick Fiori]] (singer)\n* [[Petru Guelfucci]] (singer)\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Luccioni]] (opera singer)\n* [[Gaston Micheletti]] (opera singer)\n* [[I Muvrini]] (band)\n* [[Jenifer (singer)|Jenifer]] (singer)\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Lanzi]] (painter)\n* [[Ange Leccia]] (visual art)\n* [[Henri Padovani]] (musician; original guitarist for The Police)\n* [[Thierry de Peretti]] (cineast)\n* [[Marie-Claude Pietragalla]] (dancer)\n* [[Jean-Paul Poletti]] (singer)\n* [[Robin Renucci]] (comedian)\n* [[Tino Rossi]] (singer)\n* [[C\u00e9sar Vezzani]] (opera singer)\n\n===Sport===\n\n[[AC Ajaccio]] and [[SC Bastia]] are the two main football teams, which have played the [[Ligue 1]] frequently since the 1960s and contest the [[Corsica derby]]. Since 2015, [[Gaz\u00e9lec Ajaccio]], the city's second team, has begun playing in the Ligue 1. The [[Tour de Corse]] is a rally held since 1956, which was a round of the [[World Rally Championship]] from 1973 to 2008 and later the [[Intercontinental Rally Challenge]] and [[European Rally Championship]]. The Tour de Corse returned as a World Rally Championship round in 2015.\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:Map of Corsica.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Map of Corsica]]\nBefore 1975, Corsica was a ''[[d\u00e9partment]]'' of the [[regions of France|French region]] of [[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]. In 1975 two new d\u00e9partements, [[Haute-Corse]] and [[Corse-du-Sud]], were created by splitting the hitherto united departement of Corsica.\n\nOn 2 March 1982, a law was passed that gave Corsica the status of ''[[territorial collectivity]]'' (''collectivit\u00e9 territoriale''), abolishing the Corsican Regional Council. Unlike the regional councils, the Corsican Assembly has executive powers over the island.\n\nIn 1992, three institutions were formed in the territorial collectivity of Corsica:\n* The [[Executive Council of Corsica]], which exercises the type of executive functions held in other French regions by the presidents of the Regional Councils. It ensures the stability and consistency needed to manage the affairs of the territory\n* The [[Corsican Assembly]], a deliberative, [[unicameral]] [[legislature|legislative body]] with greater powers than the regional councils on the mainland\n* The [[Economic, Social and Cultural Council of Corsica]], an advisory body\n\nA [[Corsican autonomy referendum, 2003|local referendum]] held in 2003, aimed at abolishing the two ''d\u00e9partements'' to leave a territorial collectivity with extended powers, was voted down by a narrow margin. However, the issue of [[Corsican nationalism|Corsican autonomy]] and greater powers for the Corsican Assembly continues to hold sway over Corsican politics.\n\n==Economy==\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 9.6 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 0.4% of French economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 25,400 euros or 84% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 103% of the EU average.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>[[File:Propriano 1.jpg|thumb|Corsica's coastline is a major driver for tourism \u2013 coastline by the town of [[Propriano]]]]\nTourism plays a big part in the Corsican economy.

The island's busiest seaport is [[Bastia]], which saw more than 2.5 million passengers in 2012.<ref>{{citation | url = http://ec.europa.eu/transport/facts-fundings/statistics/doc/2012/pocketbook2012.pdf | title = EU transport in figures - Statistical Pocketbook 2012 | newspaper = [[European Commission]]}}</ref> The second busiest seaport is [[Ajaccio]], followed by [[L'\u00cele-Rousse]] and [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]]. [[Propriano]] and [[Porto Vecchio]] in the south also have smaller ferry docks and are seasonally served from France (Marseille), while [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio's]] harbour is only frequented by smaller car ferries from the neighbouring island of [[Sardinia]].\n\nThe ferry companies serving Corsica are [[Corsica Ferries - Sardinia Ferries]] (from Savona, Livorno and Piombino in Italy; Toulon and Nice in France), [[SNCM]] (from Marseille, Toulon and Nice in France), CMN - La M\u00e9ridionale (from Marseille in France) and [[Moby Lines]] (from Livorno and Genoa in Italy).<ref>{{citation | url = https://www.corsica-ferries.co.uk | title = Corsica Ferries - Official Website}}</ref><ref>{{citation | url = http://www.sncm.fr | title = SNCM - Official Website}}</ref><ref>{{citation | url = http://www.lameridionale.fr/ | title = Compagnie m\u00e9ridionale de navigation (CMN) - Official Website}}</ref><ref>{{citation | url = http://www.mobylines.com | title = Moby Lines - Official Website}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2012}}\nThere are several groups and two [[Corsican nationalism|nationalist]] parties (the [[autonomism (political doctrine)|autonomist]] ''Femu a Corsica'' and the [[separatism|separatist]] ''Corsica Libera'') active on the island calling for some degree of Corsican [[self-governance|autonomy]] from France or even full independence. Generally speaking, regionalist proposals focus on the promotion of the [[Corsican language]], more power for local governments, and some exemptions from national taxes in addition to those already applying to Corsica.\n\nThe French government is opposed to full independence but has at times shown support for some level of autonomy. There is support on the island for proposals for greater autonomy, but polls show that a large majority of Corsicans are opposed to full independence.<ref>{{citation | url = http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualite/politique/20081001.OBS3635/89-des-corses-opposes-a-l-independance-de-l-ile.html | title = 89 % des corses oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 l'ind\u00e9pendance de l'\u00eele |trans-title=89% Corsicans are opposed to Corsican independence | newspaper = [[Nouvel Observateur]] | language = French}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rue89.com/rue89-politique/2012/08/06/quoi-pensent-les-corses-quand-ils-pensent-la-corse-234434 Enqu\u00eate: la Corse vue par les Corses - Rue89, Le nouvel observateur]</ref>\n\nIn 1972, the Italian company Montedison dumped toxic waste off the Corsican coast, creating what looked like red mud in waters around the island with the poisoning of the sea, the most visible effects being [[cetaceans]] found dead on the shores.

{{IPA-co|\u02c8korsiga|}} and {{IPA-it|\u02c8k\u0254rsika|}} respectively) is an island in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and one of the 18 [[regions of France]]. It is located southeast of the French [[mainland]] and west of the [[Italian Peninsula]], with the nearest land mass being the [[Italy|Italian]] island of [[Sardinia]] to the immediate south. A single chain of mountains makes up two-thirds of the island.\n\nThe island is an administrative [[region of France]] (with the regional capital being [[Ajaccio]]), divided in two administrative departments, [[Haute-Corse]] and [[Corse-du-Sud]]. The corresponding regional and departmental [[territorial collectivity|territorial collectivities]], however, merged on 1 January 2018, forming the [[single territorial collectivity]] of Corsica. As a single territorial collectivity, Corsica enjoys a greater degree of autonomy than other French regional collectivities; for example, the [[Corsican Assembly]] is able to exercise limited executive powers. [[Bastia]], the prefecture city of Haute-Corse, is the second largest town in Corsica.\n\nAfter being ruled by the [[Republic of Genoa]] since 1284, in 1755 Corsica became a self-proclaimed [[Italian language|Italian]]-speaking [[Corsican Republic|Republic]], until it was officially ceded by Genoa to [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] as part of a [[Treaty of Versailles (1768)|pledge for debts]] and subsequently [[French conquest of Corsica|annexed]] to France in 1769. [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] was born the same year in Ajaccio, and his ancestral home ([[Maison Bonaparte]]) is today a significant visitor attraction and museum. Due to Corsica's historical ties with the Italian peninsula, the island retains many [[Italian culture|Italian cultural]] elements, and the [[Corsican language|native tongue]] is recognized as a regional language by the French government.\n\n==History==\n===Prehistory and antiquity===\n{{Main|Prehistory of Corsica|History of Corsica|Medieval Corsica}}\n[[File:Corse-04812-\u00e9glise de Aregno.jpg|thumb|upright|The medieval influence of [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] in Corsica can be seen in the Romanesque-Pisan style of the [[Church of the Trinity and Saint John|Church of Aregno]].]]\nThe origin of the name Corsica is subject to much debate and remains a mystery. To the [[Ancient Greeks]] it was known as ''Kalliste'', ''Corsis'', ''Cyrnos'', ''Cernealis'', or ''Cirn\u00e9''. The last three names derive from the most ancient Greek name of the island, \"{{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9}}\" (\"Seirinoussai\", meaning ''of the Sirens''), the very same Sirens mentioned in [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]].\n\nCorsica has been occupied continuously since the [[Mesolithic]] era. Its population was influential in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] during its long prehistory.\n\nAfter a brief occupation by the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]], [[Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul|colonization by the ancient Greeks]], and an only slightly longer occupation by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], it was incorporated by the [[Roman Republic]] at the end of the [[First Punic War]] and, with [[Sardinia]], in 238&nbsp;BC became [[Corsica and Sardinia|a province]] of the [[Roman Republic]].<ref name=be41>Bertarelli (1929), p.41</ref> The Romans, who built a colony in [[Al\u00e9ria]], considered Corsica as one of the most backward regions of the Roman world. The island produced sheep, honey, [[resin]] and wax, and exported many slaves, not well considered because of their fierce and rebellious character.<ref name=be41/> Moreover, it was known for its cheap wines, exported to Rome, and was used as a place of relegation, one of the most famous exiles being the Roman philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pais|first1=Ettore|title=Storia della Sardegna e della Corsica durante il periodo romano|date=1999|publisher=Ilisso|location=Nuoro|isbn=88-85098-92-4|pages=76\u201377|language=Italian}}</ref> Administratively, the island was divided in ''[[Pagus#Roman usage|pagi]]'', which in the Middle Ages became the ''[[Pieve|pievi]]'', the basic administrative units of the island until 1768.<ref name=be41/> During the diffusion of Christianity, which arrived quite early from Rome and the Tuscan harbors, Corsica was home to many martyrs and saints: among them, the most important are [[Devota|Saint Devota]] and [[Julia of Corsica|Saint Julia]], both patrons of the island.

After 26 years of struggle against the [[Republic of Genoa]] (plus an ephemeral attempt to proclaim in 1736 an independent Kingdom of Corsica under the German adventurer [[Theodore of Corsica|Theodor von Neuhoff]]), the independent [[Corsican Republic]] was proclaimed in 1755 under the leadership of Pasquale Paoli and remained sovereign until 1769, when the island was [[French conquest of Corsica|conquered by France]]. The first [[Corsican Constitution]] was written in Italian (the language of culture in Corsica until the middle of the 19th century) by Paoli.\n\nThe Corsican Republic was unable to eject the Genoese from the major coastal fortresses (Calvi and Bonifacio). After the Corsican conquest of [[Capraia]], a small island of the [[Tuscan Archipelago]], in 1767, the [[Republic of Genoa]], exhausted by forty years of fighting, decided to sell the island to France which, after [[France in the Seven Years War|its defeat in the Seven Years' War]], was trying to reinforce its position in the Mediterranean.  In 1768, with the [[Treaty of Versailles (1768)|Treaty of Versailles]], the Genoese republic ceded all its rights on the island. After an initial successful resistance culminating with the victory at [[Borgo, Haute-Corse|Borgo]], the Corsican republic was crushed by a large French army led by the [[No\u00ebl Jourda de Vaux|Count of Vaux]] at the [[Battle of Ponte Novu]]. This marked the end of Corsican sovereignty. Despite triggering the [[Corsican Crisis]] in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], whose government gave secret aid, no foreign military support came for the Corsicans. However, nationalist feelings still ran high. Despite the conquest, Corsica was not incorporated into the French state until 1789.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, Pasquale Paoli was able to return to Corsica from exile in Britain. In 1794, he invited British forces under [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Lord Hood]] to intervene to free Corsica from French rule. Anglo-Corsican forces drove the French from the island and established an [[Anglo-Corsican Kingdom]]. Following Spain's entry into the war, the British decided to withdraw from Corsica in 1796. Corsica returned to French rule.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Ajaccio, Corsica, France - Napoleon's Birthday Celebration 2006 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Corsicans commemorating the anniversary of the birth of [[Napoleon]]]] \nDespite being the birthplace of the Emperor, who had supported Paoli in his youth, the island was neglected by Napoleon's government.<ref>Howard, John E., ''Letters and Documents of Napoleon: Vol. 1 Rise to Power''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1961.</ref> In 1814, near the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Corsica was briefly occupied again by British troops. The [[Treaty of Bastia]] gave the British crown sovereignty over the island, but it was later repudiated by [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Lord Castlereagh]] who insisted that the island should be returned to a [[Bourbon Restoration|restored French monarchy]].\n\nAfter the restoration, the island was further neglected by the French state. Despite the presence of a middle class in Bastia and Ajaccio, Corsica remained an otherwise primitive place, whose economy consisted mainly of a subsistence agriculture, and whose population constituted a pastoral society, dominated by [[clan]]s and the rules of [[feud|vendetta]]. The code of vendetta required Corsicans to seek deadly revenge for offences against their family's honor. Between 1821 and 1852, no fewer than 4,300 murders were perpetrated in Corsica.<ref>{{cite book| url= https://archive.org/details/wanderingsincors01greg |title= Wanderings in Corsica: its history and its heroes| publisher= Thomas Constable and Company | first= Ferdinand |last= Gregorovius |year= 1855| page= [https://archive.org/details/wanderingsincors01greg/page/196 196]}}</ref> In this period a myth proved of interest as an historical fact by virtue of its being introduced by [[Herodotus]] and furthered by writers like [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e|M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]] and [[Ferdinand Gregorovius|Gregorovius]], of Corsica as having been populated by [[Arcadia (ancient region)#Arcadians|Arcadians]] ([[Oenotrians]] and citizens of [[Phocaea]]), fierce and loyal people. During the first half of the century, the people of Corsica belonged still to the Italian cultural world: the bourgeoisie sent children to [[University of Pisa|Pisa]] to study, official acts were enacted in Italian and most books were printed in Italian.<ref name=ra1124/> Moreover, many islanders sympathised with [[risorgimento|the national struggle]] which was taking place in nearby Italy in those years: several political refugees from the peninsula, like [[Niccol\u00f2 Tommaseo]], spent years in the island, while some Corsicans, like Count [[Leonetto Cipriani]], took active part in the fights for Italian independence.\n\nDespite all that, during those years the Corsicans began to feel a stronger and stronger attraction to France. The reasons for that are manifold: the knowledge of the French language, which thanks to the mandatory primary school started to penetrate among the local youth, the high prestige of French culture, the awareness of being part of a big, powerful state, the possibility of well-paid jobs as civil servants, both in the island, in the mainland and in the colonies, the prospect of serving the French army during the wars for the conquest of the colonial empire, the introduction of [[steamboat]]s, which reduced the travel time between mainland France from the island drastically, and \u2014 last but not least \u2014 Napoleon himself, whose existence alone constituted an indissoluble link between France and Corsica. Thanks to all these factors by around 1870 Corsica had landed in the French cultural world.<ref name=ra1124>Ravis-Giordani (1991), p. 112\u201314</ref>\n\nFrom the 19th century into the mid-20th century, Corsicans also grew closer to the French nation through participation in the French Empire. Compared to much of Metropolitan France, Corsica was poor and many Corsicans emigrated. While Corsicans emigrated globally, especially to many South American countries, many chose to move within the French Empire which acted as a conduit for emigration and eventual return, as many young Corsican men could find better job opportunities in the far corners of the Empire where many other French hesitated to go. In many parts of the Empire, Corsicans were strongly represented, such as in [[Saigon]] where in 1926 12% of European were from Corsica.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Echo de la Corse |date= May\u2013June 1929 |title=Inepuissable pepiniere de soldats et de coloniaux |journal=Saigon-Cyrnos: Bulletin de l'Amicale Corse de la Cochinchine et du Cambodge |volume=43 |pages= 13\u201314}}</ref> Across the French Empire, many Corsicans retained a sense of community by establishing organizations where they would meet regularly, keep one another informed of developments in Corsica, and come to one anothers\u2019 aid in times of need.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Guelfi |first= A.D. |date= April 1931 |title=Les Corses hors de Corse partout presents toujours unis |journal= Saigon-Cyrnos: Bulletin de l'Amicale Corse de la Cochinchine et du Cambodge |volume=58 |pages=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\n===Modern Corsica===\n[[File:Monument-Solaro.jpg|thumb|Monument to the [[French Resistance]] during WWII in [[Solaro, Haute-Corse|Solaro]] (plaine orientale)]]\nCorsica paid a high price for the French victory in the First World War: agriculture was disrupted by the years-long absence of almost all of the young workers, and the percentage of dead or wounded Corsicans in the conflict was double that of those from metropolitan France. Moreover, the protectionist policies of the French government, started in the 1880s and never stopped, had ruined the Corsican export of wine and olive oil, and forced many young Corsicans to emigrate to mainland France or to the Americas. As reaction to these conditions, a nationalist movement was born in the 1920s around the newspaper ''A Muvra'', having as its objective the autonomy of the island from France. In the 1930s, many exponents of this movement became [[Italian irredentism|irredentist]], seeing annexation of the island to fascist Italy as the only solution to its problems. Under [[Benito Mussolini]] annexation of Corsica had become one of the main goals of Italy's unification policy.\n\nAfter the collapse of France to the German [[Wehrmacht]] in 1940, Corsica came under the rule of the [[Vichy French]] regime, which was collaborating with [[Nazi Germany]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Az\u00e9ma|first1=Jean-Pierre|last2=Wieviorka|first2=Olivier|title=Vichy, 1940-44| date= 1997| publisher= Perrin| location=Paris|pages=231\u201333|language=French}}</ref> In November 1942 the island, following the [[Operation Torch|Anglo-American landings in North Africa]] was [[Italian occupation of Corsica|occupied by Italian and German forces]].

Tensions escalated until an armed police assault on a pieds-noirs-owned wine cellar in [[Aleria]], occupied by Corsican nationalists on 23 August 1975. This marked the beginning of the armed nationalist struggle against the French government. Ever since, [[Corsican nationalism]] has been a feature of the island's politics, with calls for greater autonomy and protection for Corsican culture and the [[Corsican language]]. Periodic flare-ups of raids and killings culminated in the assassination of Prefect [[Claude \u00c9rignac]] in 1998.\n\nIn 2013, Corsica hosted the first three stages of the 100th [[2013 Tour de France|Tour de France]], which passed through the island for the first time in the event's 110-year history.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Corsica-calvi-panorama.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2.75|The Bay of [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]]: Corsica is the most mountainous Mediterranean island.]]\n[[File:Speloncato general view.jpg|thumb|A view of [[Speloncato]]]]\n[[File:Corsica-geographic map-en.svg|thumb|Geographic map of Corsica]]\nCorsica was formed about 250 million years ago with the uplift of a [[granite]] backbone on the western side.

The Park was created in 1972 and includes the Golfe de Porto, the [[Scandola Nature Reserve]] (a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]), and some of the highest mountains on the island. Scandola cannot be reached on foot, but people can gain access by boat from the village of Gal\u00e9ria and Porto (Ota). Two endangered subspecies of hoofed mammals, the [[mouflon]] (''Ovis aries musimon'') and [[Corsican red deer]] (''Cervus elaphus corsicanus'') inhabit the park. The Corsican red deer was re-introduced after it was extinct due to over hunting. This Corsican subspecies was the same that survived on Sardinia, so it is [[Endemism|endemic]]. There are other species endemic to Corsica especially in the upper mountain ranges, i.e. [[Corsican nuthatch]], [[Corsican fire salamander]] and [[Corsican brook salamander]] and many plant subspecies.\n\n===Extinct animals===\nCorsica, like all the other Mediterranean islands, was home to indigenous animals of the [[Pleistocene]], some endemic to it and some coming to it and [[Sardinia]] (as Sardinia was joined to Corsica for much of the Pleistocene). After the proliferation of humans in the [[Mesolithic]], these began to disappear, partly from extinction of the species, and partly from eradication only in Corsica. However, it is now known that many species managed to survive the Mesolithic, and many were still present well into recorded history.<ref>{{cite book|title=Extinctions in Near Time: Causes, Contexts, and Consequences|year=1999|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-306-46092-0|first=R.D.E.|last=MacPhee|author2=Hans-Dieter Sues|page=179}}</ref>\n\nThe globally extinct species are the [[Sardinian dhole]], ''[[Megaloceros cazioti]]'', [[Corsican giant shrew]], [[Tyrrhenian mole]], [[Sardinian pika]], [[Corsican-Sardinian vole]], [[Corsican-Sardinian wood mouse]], ''[[Bubo insularis]]'' and ''[[Athene angelis]]''.

[[Corsican language|Corsican]] (''Corsu''), a [[minority language]] that is closely related to medieval [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]] (''Toscano''), has a better prospect of survival than most other [[Languages in France|French regional languages]]: Corsican is in fact, after [[French language|French]] (''Fran\u00e7ais''), the most widely spoken language on the island. However, since the annexation of the island by France in the 18th century, Corsican has been under heavy pressure from French, and today it is estimated that only 10% of Corsica's population speak the language natively, with only 50% having some sort of proficiency in it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/homean/index1.html |title=Euromosaic-Index1 |publisher= Open University of Catalonia | website= uoc.edu |accessdate=2012-10-27}}</ref>\n\nThe language is divided into two main varieties: ''Cismuntanu'' and ''Ultramuntanu'', spoken respectively northeast and southwest of the Girolata - [[Porto Vecchio]] line. This division was due to the massive immigration from Tuscany which took place in Corsica during the lower Middle Ages: as a result, the ''Cismuntanu'' became very similar to the Tuscan dialects, being part of the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian language group]], while the ''Ultramuntanu'' could keep its original characteristics which make it much more similar to a [[Southern Romance languages|Southern Romance language]] like [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] (''Sardu'').<ref>{{Cite book|title=Italia dialettale | first= Giulio| last= Bertoni| year= 1916| publisher= Hoepli|location=Milano|language=Italian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Il linguaggio d'Italia|first=Giacomo|last= Devoto |authorlink=Giacomo Devoto|year= 1974|publisher=Rizzoli|location=Milano|language=Italian}}</ref> Therefore, due to the differences between the main dialectal varieties, many linguists classify Corsican as an Italo-Dalmatian language,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Romance Languages|first=Martin |last= Harris|first2= Nigel| last2= Vincent|year= 1997|isbn=0-415-16417-6|publisher=Routlegde|location=London}}</ref> while others consider it a Southern Romance one.<ref>{{cite web |editor=Nordhoff, Sebastian |editor2=Hammarstr\u00f6m, Harald |editor3=Forkel, Robert |editor4=Haspelmath, Martin |year=2013 |title=Subfamily: Italo-Dalmatian |website=Glottolog 2.2 |url=http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/ital1286}}</ref>\n\nFewer and fewer people speak a [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian dialect]], known as ''bunifazzinu'',<ref>[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/dialetti-liguri_%28Enciclopedia-dell%27Italiano%29/ Enciclopedia Treccani - Dialetti liguri]</ref> in what has long been a [[language island]], [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]], and in [[Ajaccio]], the ''aghjaccinu'' dialect.

Game such as wild boar (''Cingale'', ''Singhjari'') is popular. There also is seafood and river fish such as trout. Delicacies such as ''figatellu'' (also named as ''ficateddu''), made with liver, ''coppa'', ham (''prizuttu''), ''lonzu'' are made from Corsican pork (''porcu nustrale''). Characteristic among the cheeses is ''[[brocciu]]'' (similar to ricotta), which is used as a fresh ingredient in many dishes, from first courses (''[[Strozzapreti#Corsican Strozzapreti|sturzapreti]]'') to cakes (''[[fiadone]]''). Other cheeses, like ''casgiu merzu'' (\"rotten cheese\", the Corsican counterpart of the [[Sardinia]]n ''[[casu marzu]]''), ''casgiu veghju'' are made from goat or sheep milk. Chestnuts are the main ingredient in the making of ''pulenta castagnina'' and cakes (''[[falculelle]]''). A variety of alcohol also exists ranging from ''aquavita'' (brandy), red and white [[Corsica wine|Corsican wines]] (''Vinu Corsu''), muscat wine (plain or sparkling), and the famous \"Cap Corse\" ap\u00e9ritif produced by Mattei. The herbs which are part of [[Maquis shrubland|Maquis]] ({{lang-co|machja}}) and the chestnuts and oak nuts of the Corsican forests are eaten by local animals, resulting in the noticeable taste in the food there.\n\n===Art===\n{{See also|Music of Corsica}}\nCorsica has produced a number of known artists: \n* [[Aliz\u00e9e]]\n* [[Martha Angelici]] (opera singer)\n* [[A Filetta]] (polyphonic chant group)\n* [[:fr:Canta U Populu Corsu|Canta U Populu Corsu]] (band)\n* [[Laetitia Casta]] (model/actress)\n* [[Baptiste Giabiconi]] (model/singer)\n* [[:fr:Julien de Casabianca-Caumer|Julien de Casabianca]] (cineast)\n* [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Ferrari]] (writer)\n* [[Patrick Fiori]] (singer)\n* [[Petru Guelfucci]] (singer)\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Luccioni]] (opera singer)\n* [[Gaston Micheletti]] (opera singer)\n* [[I Muvrini]] (band)\n* [[Jenifer (singer)|Jenifer]] (singer)\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Lanzi]] (painter)\n* [[Ange Leccia]] (visual art)\n* [[Henri Padovani]] (musician; original guitarist for The Police)\n* [[Thierry de Peretti]] (cineast)\n* [[Marie-Claude Pietragalla]] (dancer)\n* [[Jean-Paul Poletti]] (singer)\n* [[Robin Renucci]] (comedian)\n* [[Tino Rossi]] (singer)\n* [[C\u00e9sar Vezzani]] (opera singer)\n\n===Sport===\n\n[[AC Ajaccio]] and [[SC Bastia]] are the two main football teams, which have played the [[Ligue 1]] frequently since the 1960s and contest the [[Corsica derby]]. Since 2015, [[Gaz\u00e9lec Ajaccio]], the city's second team, has begun playing in the Ligue 1. The [[Tour de Corse]] is a rally held since 1956, which was a round of the [[World Rally Championship]] from 1973 to 2008 and later the [[Intercontinental Rally Challenge]] and [[European Rally Championship]]. The Tour de Corse returned as a World Rally Championship round in 2015.\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:Map of Corsica.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Map of Corsica]]\nBefore 1975, Corsica was a ''[[d\u00e9partment]]'' of the [[regions of France|French region]] of [[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]. In 1975 two new d\u00e9partements, [[Haute-Corse]] and [[Corse-du-Sud]], were created by splitting the hitherto united departement of Corsica.\n\nOn 2 March 1982, a law was passed that gave Corsica the status of ''[[territorial collectivity]]'' (''collectivit\u00e9 territoriale''), abolishing the Corsican Regional Council. Unlike the regional councils, the Corsican Assembly has executive powers over the island.\n\nIn 1992, three institutions were formed in the territorial collectivity of Corsica:\n* The [[Executive Council of Corsica]], which exercises the type of executive functions held in other French regions by the presidents of the Regional Councils. It ensures the stability and consistency needed to manage the affairs of the territory\n* The [[Corsican Assembly]], a deliberative, [[unicameral]] [[legislature|legislative body]] with greater powers than the regional councils on the mainland\n* The [[Economic, Social and Cultural Council of Corsica]], an advisory body\n\nA [[Corsican autonomy referendum, 2003|local referendum]] held in 2003, aimed at abolishing the two ''d\u00e9partements'' to leave a territorial collectivity with extended powers, was voted down by a narrow margin. However, the issue of [[Corsican nationalism|Corsican autonomy]] and greater powers for the Corsican Assembly continues to hold sway over Corsican politics.\n\n==Economy==\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 9.6 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 0.4% of French economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 25,400 euros or 84% of the EU27 average in the same year.

Oriental goods, like silk and spices, were carried from Egypt to ports like [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Constantinople]] by sailors and Jewish merchants. The [[Viking expansion|Viking raids]] further disrupted the trade in western Europe and brought it to a halt. However, the [[Norsemen]] developed the trade from Norway to the [[White Sea]], while also trading in luxury goods from [[Al-Andalus|Spain]] and the Mediterranean. The [[Byzantine Empire under the Isaurian dynasty|Byzantines in the mid-8th century]] retook control of the area around the north-eastern part of the Mediterranean.

The surface waters entering the eastern Mediterranean basin circulate along the Libyan and Israelian coasts. Upon reaching the [[Levantine Sea]], the surface waters having experienced warming and saltening from their initial Atlantic state, are now more dense and sink to form the Levantine Intermediate Waters (LIW). Most of the water found anywhere between 50 and 600 m deep in the Mediterranean originates from the LIW.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/b107143 |chapter=Circulation in the Mediterranean Sea |title=The Mediterranean Sea |volume=5K |pages=29\u201366 |series=Handbook of Environmental Chemistry |year=2005 |last1=Millot |first1=Claude |last2=Taupier-Letage |first2=Isabelle |isbn=978-3-540-25018-0 |chapter-url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01191856/file/Millot_Taupier-Letage_Circulation_Med_Handbook_2005_HAL%20%281%29.pdf }}</ref> LIW are formed along the coasts of Turkey and circulate westwards along the Greek and South Italian coasts. LIW are the only waters passing the Sicily Strait westwards. After the Strait of Sicily, the LIW waters circulate along the Italian, French and Spanish coasts before exiting the Mediterranean through the depths of the Strait of Gibraltar. Deep water in the Mediterranean originates from three main areas: the [[Adriatic Sea]], from which most of the deep water in the eastern Mediterranean originates, the [[Aegean Sea]], and the [[Gulf of Lion]]. Deep water formation in the Mediterranean is triggered by strong winter [[convection]] fueled by intense cold winds like the [[Bora (wind)|Bora]]. When new deep water is formed, the older waters mix with the overlaying intermediate waters and eventually exit the Mediterranean. The [[Water cycle#Residence times|residence time of water]] in the Mediterranean is approximately 100 years, making the Mediterranean especially sensitive to climate change.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Millot |first1=C. |year=1989 |title=La Circulation G\u00e9n\u00e9rale En M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Occidentale : Aper\u00e7u De Nos Connaissances Et Projets D'\u00e9tudes |trans-title=General Circulation in the Western Mediterranean: Overview of Our Knowledge and Study Projects |language=French |journal=Annales de G\u00e9ographie |volume=98 |issue=549 |pages=497\u2013515 |jstor=23452851 |doi=10.3406/geo.1989.20925 }}</ref>\n\n===Other events affecting water circulation===\nBeing a semi-enclosed basin, the Mediterranean experiences transitory events that can affect the water circulation on short time scales. In the mid 1990s, the Aegean Sea became the main area for deep water formation in the eastern Mediterranean after particularly cold winter conditions. This transitory switch in the origin of deep waters in the eastern Mediterranean was termed Eastern Mediterranean Transient (EMT) and had major consequences on water circulation of the Mediterranean.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gasparini |first1=G.P. |last2=Ortona |first2=A. |last3=Budillon |first3=G. |last4=Astraldi |first4=M. |last5=Sansone |first5=E. |title=The effect of the Eastern Mediterranean Transient on the hydrographic characteristics in the Strait of Sicily and in the Tyrrhenian Sea |journal=Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers |date=June 2005 |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=915\u2013935 |doi=10.1016/j.dsr.2005.01.001 |bibcode=2005DSRI...52..915G }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lascaratos |first1=Alex |last2=Roether |first2=Wolfgang |last3=Nittis |first3=Kostas |last4=Klein |first4=Birgit |title=Recent changes in deep water formation and spreading in the eastern Mediterranean Sea: a review |journal=Progress in Oceanography |date=August 1999 |volume=44 |issue=1\u20133 |pages=5\u201336 |doi=10.1016/S0079-6611(99)00019-1 |bibcode=1999PrOce..44....5L }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Theocharis |first1=Alexander |last2=Nittis |first2=Kostas |last3=Kontoyiannis |first3=Harilaos |last4=Papageorgiou |first4=Emanuel |last5=Balopoulos |first5=Efstathios |title=Climatic changes in the Aegean Sea influence the eastern Mediterranean thermohaline circulation (1986\u20131997) |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |date=1 June 1999 |volume=26 |issue=11 |pages=1617\u20131620 |doi=10.1029/1999GL900320 |bibcode=1999GeoRL..26.1617T }}</ref>\n\nAnother example of a transient event affecting the Mediterranean circulation is the periodic inversion of the North Ionian Gyre, which is an [[Anticyclonic rotation|anticyclonic]] [[ocean gyre]] observed in the northern part of the [[Ionian Sea]], off the Greek coast. The transition from anticyclonic to cyclonic rotation of this gyre changes the origin of the waters fueling it; when the circulation is anticyclonic (most common), the waters of the gyre originate from the Adriatic Sea. When the circulation is cyclonic, the waters originate from the [[Levantine Sea]]. These waters have different physical and chemical characteristics, and the periodic inversion of the North Ionian Gyre (called Bimodal Oscillating System or BiOS) changes the Mediterranean circulation and biogeochemistry around the Adriatic and Levantine regions.<ref>Civitarese, G., Gacic, M., Lipizer, M., and Borzelli, G.

The Mediterranean Sea is commonly referred to as an LNLC (Low-Nutrient, Low-Chlorophyll) area. The Mediterranean Sea fits the definition of a [[desert]] as it has low precipitation and its nutrient contents are low, making it difficult for plants and animals to develop.\n\nThere are steep gradients in nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll concentrations and primary productivity in the Mediterranean. Nutrient concentrations in the western part of the basin are about double the concentrations in the eastern basin. The [[Alboran Sea]], close to the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], has a daily [[primary productivity]] of about 0.25 g C (grams of carbon) m<sup>\u22122</sup> day<sup>\u22121</sup> whereas the eastern basin has an average daily productivity of 0.16 g C m<sup>\u22122</sup> day<sup>\u22121</sup>.<ref>Uitz, J., Stramski, D., Gentili, B., D\u2019Ortenzio, F., and Claustre, H.

As Africa-Arabia drifted northward, it closed over the ancient [[Tethys Ocean]] which had earlier separated the two supercontinents [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]].\nAt about that time in the middle [[Jurassic]] period (roughly 170 million years ago {{dubious|date=November 2018}}) a much smaller sea basin, dubbed the [[Neotethys]], was formed shortly before the Tethys Ocean closed at its western (Arabian) end. The broad line of collisions pushed up a very long system of mountains from the [[Pyrenees]] in Spain to the [[Zagros Mountains]] in Iran in an episode of mountain-building tectonics known as the [[Alpine orogeny]]. The Neotethys grew larger during the episodes of collisions (and associated foldings and subductions) that occurred during the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] epochs (34 to 5.33 mya); see animation: [[Supercontinent|Africa-Arabia colliding with Eurasia]]. Accordingly, the Mediterranean [[Oceanic basin|basin]] consists of several stretched [[Tectonics|tectonic]] plates in [[subduction]] which are the foundation of the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea. Various zones of subduction contain the highest oceanic ridges, east of the [[Ionian Sea]] and south of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].

As mentioned, there were two earlier gateways: the [[Betic Corridor]] across southern Spain and the [[Rifian Corridor]] across northern Morocco. The Betic closed about 6 mya, causing the Messinian salinity crisis (MSC); the Rifian or possibly both gateways closed during the earlier [[Tortonian]] times, causing a \"[[Tortonian salinity crisis]]\" (from 11.6 to 7.2 mya), long before the MSC and lasting much longer. Both \"crises\" resulted in broad connections between the mainlands of Africa and Europe, which allowed migrations of flora and fauna\u2014especially large mammals including primates\u2014between the two continents. The [[Vallesian|Vallesian crisis]] indicates a typical extinction and replacement of mammal species in Europe during Tortonian times following climatic upheaval and overland migrations of new species:<ref>{{Cite book\n | last1 = Agusti | first1 = J\n | last2 = Moya-Sola | first2 = S\n | title = Mammal extinctions in the Vallesian (Upper Miocene)\n | volume = 30 | year = 1990 | pages = 425\u2013432\n | issn = 1613-2580 | doi = 10.1007/BFb0011163\n| series = Lecture Notes in Earth Sciences\n | isbn = 978-3-540-52605-6\n }} (Abstract)</ref> see Animation: Messinian salinity crisis (and mammal migrations), at right.\n\nThe almost complete enclosure of the Mediterranean basin has enabled the oceanic gateways to dominate seawater circulation and the environmental evolution of the sea and basin. Circulation patterns are also affected by several other factors\u2014including climate, bathymetry, and water chemistry and temperature\u2014which are interactive and can induce precipitation of [[evaporite]]s. Deposits of evaporites accumulated earlier in the nearby [[Geology of the Western Carpathians#Foredeep|Carpathian foredeep]] during the [[Middle Miocene]], and the adjacent [[Red Sea Basin]] (during the [[Late Miocene]]), and in the whole Mediterranean basin (during the MSC and the [[Messinian]] age). Many [[diatomite]]s are found underneath the evaporite deposits, suggesting a connection between their{{clarify|date=August 2019}} formations.\n\nToday, evaporation of surface seawater (output) is more than the supply (input) of fresh water by precipitation and coastal drainage systems, causing the salinity of the Mediterranean to be much higher than that of the Atlantic\u2014so much so that the saltier Mediterranean waters sink below the waters incoming from the Atlantic, causing a two-layer flow across the Strait of Gibraltar: that is, an outflow [[Strait of Gibraltar#Inflow and outflow|''submarine current'']] of warm saline Mediterranean water, counterbalanced by an inflow surface current of less saline cold oceanic water from the Atlantic. In the 1920s, Herman S\u00f6rgel proposed the building of a hydroelectric dam (the [[Atlantropa]] project) across the Straits, using the inflow current to provide a large amount of hydroelectric energy. The underlying energy grid was also intended to support a political union between Europe and, at least, the Maghreb part of Africa (compare [[Eurafrique|Eurafrika]] for the later impact and [[Desertec]] for a later project with some parallels in the planned grid).<ref>Politische Geographien Europas: Ann\u00e4herungen an ein umstrittenes Konstrukt, Anke Str\u00fcver, LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster, 2005, p. 43</ref>\n\n====Shift to a \"Mediterranean climate\"====\nThe end of the [[Miocene]] also marked a change in the climate of the Mediterranean basin. Fossil evidence from that period reveals that the larger basin had a humid subtropical climate with rainfall in the summer supporting [[laurel forest]]s. The shift to a \"Mediterranean climate\" occurred largely within the last three million years (the late [[Pliocene]] epoch) as summer rainfall decreased. The subtropical laurel forests retreated; and even as they persisted on the islands of [[Macaronesia]] off the Atlantic coast of Iberia and North Africa, the present Mediterranean vegetation evolved, dominated by coniferous trees and [[sclerophyllous]] trees and shrubs with small, hard, waxy leaves that prevent moisture loss in the dry summers. Much of these forests and shrublands have been altered beyond recognition by thousands of years of human habitation. There are now very few relatively intact natural areas in what was once a heavily wooded region.\n\n==Paleoclimate==\nBecause of its latitude and its land-locked position, the Mediterranean is especially sensitive to astronomically induced climatic variations, which are well documented in its sedimentary record. Since the Mediterranean is subject to the deposition of [[eolian dust]] from the [[Sahara]] during dry periods, whereas riverine [[detritus (geology)|detrital]] input prevails during wet ones, the Mediterranean marine [[sapropel]]-bearing sequences provide high-resolution climatic information. These data have been employed in reconstructing astronomically calibrated time scales for the last 9 Ma of the Earth's history, helping to constrain the time of past [[geomagnetic reversal]]s.<ref>FJ, Hilgen.

The stable [[marine ecosystem]] of the Mediterranean Sea and [[Sea surface temperature|sea temperature]] provides a nourishing environment for [[Marine biology|life in the deep sea]] to flourish while assuring a balanced [[aquatic ecosystem]] excluded from any external [[Deep sea|deep]] [[Ocean|oceanic factors]]. It is estimated that there are more than 17,000 [[Marine life|marine species]] in the Mediterranean Sea with generally higher marine [[biodiversity]] in [[Coast|coastal areas]], [[Continental shelf|continental shelves]], and decreases with depth.<ref>Coll, Marta, et al., \"The biodiversity of the Mediterranean Sea: estimates, patterns, and threats.\" ''PloS one 5.8'', 2010.</ref>\n\nAs a result of the drying of the sea during the [[Messinian salinity crisis]],<ref>[[Kenneth J.

The North Atlantic is considerably colder and more nutrient-rich than the Mediterranean, and the marine life of the Mediterranean has had to adapt to its differing conditions in the five million years since the basin was reflooded.\n\nThe [[Alboran Sea]] is a transition zone between the two seas, containing a mix of Mediterranean and Atlantic species. The Alboran Sea has the largest population of [[bottlenose dolphin]]s in the Western Mediterranean, is home to the last population of [[harbour porpoise]]s in the Mediterranean, and is the most important feeding grounds for [[loggerhead sea turtle]]s in Europe. The Alboran Sea also hosts important commercial fisheries, including [[sardine]]s and [[swordfish]]. The [[Mediterranean monk seal]]s live in the Aegean Sea in Greece. In 2003, the [[World Wildlife Fund]] raised concerns about the widespread [[drift net]] fishing endangering populations of dolphins, turtles, and other marine animals such as the [[Galathea strigosa|spiny squat lobster]].\n\nThere was a resident population of [[killer whale]] in the Mediterranean until the 1980s, when they went extinct, probably due to long term PCB exposure.

The Red Sea is higher than the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], so the canal functions as a [[tidal strait]] that pours Red Sea water into the Mediterranean. The [[Bitter Lakes]], which are hyper-saline natural lakes that form part of the canal, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalised with that of the Red Sea, the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonise the Eastern Mediterranean. The Red Sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the Atlantic, so the Red Sea species have advantages over Atlantic species in the salty and nutrient-poor Eastern Mediterranean. Accordingly, Red Sea species invade the Mediterranean biota, and not vice versa; this phenomenon is known as the [[Lessepsian migration]] (after [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], the French engineer) or Erythrean (\"red\") invasion. The construction of the [[Aswan High Dam]] across the [[Nile]] River in the 1960s reduced the inflow of freshwater and nutrient-rich [[silt]] from the Nile into the Eastern Mediterranean, making conditions there even more like the Red Sea and worsening the impact of the [[invasive species]].\n\nInvasive species have become a major component of the Mediterranean ecosystem and have serious impacts on the Mediterranean ecology, endangering many local and [[endemism|endemic]] Mediterranean species. A first look at some groups of exotic species shows that more than 70% of the non-indigenous [[Decapoda|decapod]]s and about 63% of the exotic fishes occurring in the Mediterranean are of Indo-Pacific origin,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.issg.org/infpaper_invasive.pdf |title=IUCN Guidelines for the Prevention of Biodiversity Loss Caused by Alien Invasive Species |accessdate=11 August 2009 |year=2000 |publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115235640/http://www.issg.org/infpaper_invasive.pdf |archivedate=15 January 2009 }}</ref> [[introduced species|introduced]] into the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal. This makes the Canal the first pathway of arrival of [[Introduced species|alien]] species into the Mediterranean. The impacts of some Lessepsian species have proven to be considerable, mainly in the Levantine basin of the Mediterranean, where they are replacing native species and becoming a familiar sight.\n\nAccording to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] definition, as well as [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and [[Ramsar Convention]] terminologies, they are alien species, as they are non-native (non-indigenous) to the Mediterranean Sea, and they are outside their normal area of distribution which is the Indo-Pacific region. When these species succeed in establishing populations in the Mediterranean Sea, compete with and begin to replace native species they are \"Alien Invasive Species\", as they are an agent of change and a threat to the native biodiversity. In the context of CBD, \"introduction\" refers to the movement by human agency, indirect or direct, of an alien species outside of its natural range (past or present). The Suez Canal, being an artificial (man made) canal, is a human agency. Lessepsian migrants are therefore \"introduced\" species (indirect, and unintentional). Whatever wording is chosen, they represent a threat to the native Mediterranean biodiversity, because they are non-indigenous to this sea. In recent years, the Egyptian government's announcement of its intentions to deepen and widen the canal have raised concerns from [[marine biologist]]s, fearing that such an act will only worsen the invasion of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean, and lead to even more species passing through the canal.<ref>Galil, B.S. and Zenetos, A.

Whether this reflects an expansion of the natural area of these species that now enter the Mediterranean through the Gibraltar strait, because of a warming trend of the water caused by [[global warming]]; or an extension of the maritime traffic; or is simply the result of a more intense scientific investigation, is still an open question.

land: on the north by [[Southern Europe]] and [[Anatolia]], on the south by [[North Africa]] and on the east by the [[Levant]]. Although the sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, it is usually referred to as a separate body of water. Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9&nbsp;million years ago, the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely [[desiccated]] over a period of some 600,000 years (the [[Messinian salinity crisis]]) before being refilled by the [[Zanclean flood]] about 5.3&nbsp;million years ago.\n\nIt covers an area of about {{convert|2500000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}},<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Mediterranean-Sea|title=Mediterranean Sea|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=23 October 2015}}</ref> representing 0.7% of the global [[ocean]] surface, but its connection to the Atlantic via the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]\u2014the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates [[Spain]] in [[Europe]] from [[Morocco]] in [[Africa]]\u2014is only {{convert|14|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide.

Its west\u2013east length, from the Strait of Gibraltar to the [[Gulf of Iskenderun]], on the southeastern coast of Turkey, is about {{Convert|4000|km||abbr=}}.\n\nThe sea was an important route for [[merchant]]s and travellers of ancient times, facilitating trade and cultural exchange between peoples of the region. The [[history of the Mediterranean region]] is crucial to understanding the origins and development of many modern societies. The sea was owned by the [[Roman Empire]] for many centuries, as the Romans controlled entry.\n\nThe countries surrounding the Mediterranean in clockwise order are [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Monaco]], [[Italy]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[Albania]], [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], and [[Morocco]]; [[Malta]] and [[Cyprus]] are island countries in the sea. In addition, the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[British Overseas Territories]] of [[Gibraltar]] and [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] have coastlines on the sea.\n\n==Names and etymology==\n[[File:Wadj-ur.png|left|thumb|upright=0.65|Wadj-Ur, or Wadj-Wer, ancient Egyptian name of the Mediterranean Sea]]\n[[File:EFS highres STS034 STS034-86-96.jpg|thumb|With its highly indented coastline and large number of islands, Greece has the longest Mediterranean coastline.]]\nThe [[Ancient Egyptians]] called the Mediterranean Wadj-wr/Wadj-Wer/Wadj-Ur.\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] called the Mediterranean simply {{lang|grc|\u1f21 \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1}} (''h\u0113 th\u00e1lassa''; \"the Sea\") or sometimes {{lang|grc|\u1f21 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1}} (''h\u0113 meg\u00e1l\u0113 th\u00e1lassa''; \"the Great Sea\"), {{lang|grc|\u1f21 \u1f21\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1}} (''h\u0113 h\u0113m\u00e9tera th\u00e1lassa''; \"Our Sea\"), or {{lang|grc|\u1f21 \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 \u1f21 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8'\u1f21\u03bc\u1fb6\u03c2}} (''h\u0113 th\u00e1lassa h\u0113 kath\u2019h\u0113m\u00e2s''; \"the sea around us\").\n\nThe [[Roman people|Romans]] called it ''Mare Magnum'' (\"Great Sea\") or ''Mare Internum'' (\"Internal Sea\") and, starting with the [[Roman Empire]], ''[[Mare Nostrum]]'' (\"Our Sea\").

Temporarily the east was again dominant as Roman power lived on in the [[Byzantine Empire]] formed in the 4th century from the eastern half of the [[Roman Empire]]. Another power arose in the 7th century, and with it the religion of [[Islam]], which soon swept across from the east; at its greatest extent, the [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] controlled 75% of the Mediterranean region and left a lasting footprint on its eastern and southern shores.\n\nThe [[Early Muslim conquests|Arab invasions]] disrupted the trade relations between Western and Eastern Europe while cutting the trade route with Oriental lands. This, however, had the indirect effect of promoting the trade across the [[Caspian Sea]]. The export of grains from [[Egypt]] was re-routed towards the [[Eastern world]]. Oriental goods, like silk and spices, were carried from Egypt to ports like [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Constantinople]] by sailors and Jewish merchants. The [[Viking expansion|Viking raids]] further disrupted the trade in western Europe and brought it to a halt. However, the [[Norsemen]] developed the trade from Norway to the [[White Sea]], while also trading in luxury goods from [[Al-Andalus|Spain]] and the Mediterranean. The [[Byzantine Empire under the Isaurian dynasty|Byzantines in the mid-8th century]] retook control of the area around the north-eastern part of the Mediterranean. Venetian ships from the 9th century armed themselves to counter the harassment by Arabs while concentrating trade of oriental goods at Venice.<ref>{{cite book|last=Couper |first=Alastair |title=The Geography of Sea Transport|url= https://books.google.com/?id=WFVACwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37&dq=The+Geography+of+Sea+Transport#v=onepage&q&f=falsepublisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-1-317-35150-4|pages=33\u201337}}</ref>\n[[File:Battle of Lepanto 1571.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Lepanto]], 1571, ended in victory for the European [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]] against the Ottoman Turks.]]\nThe [[Fatimids]] maintained trade relations with the [[Italian city-states]] like [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] before the Crusades, according to the [[Cairo Geniza]] documents.

These cool and relatively low-salinity waters circulate eastwards along the North African coasts. A part of these surface waters does not pass the Strait of Sicily, but deviates towards [[Corsica]] before exiting the Mediterranean. The surface waters entering the eastern Mediterranean basin circulate along the Libyan and Israelian coasts. Upon reaching the [[Levantine Sea]], the surface waters having experienced warming and saltening from their initial Atlantic state, are now more dense and sink to form the Levantine Intermediate Waters (LIW). Most of the water found anywhere between 50 and 600 m deep in the Mediterranean originates from the LIW.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/b107143 |chapter=Circulation in the Mediterranean Sea |title=The Mediterranean Sea |volume=5K |pages=29\u201366 |series=Handbook of Environmental Chemistry |year=2005 |last1=Millot |first1=Claude |last2=Taupier-Letage |first2=Isabelle |isbn=978-3-540-25018-0 |chapter-url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01191856/file/Millot_Taupier-Letage_Circulation_Med_Handbook_2005_HAL%20%281%29.pdf }}</ref> LIW are formed along the coasts of Turkey and circulate westwards along the Greek and South Italian coasts. LIW are the only waters passing the Sicily Strait westwards. After the Strait of Sicily, the LIW waters circulate along the Italian, French and Spanish coasts before exiting the Mediterranean through the depths of the Strait of Gibraltar. Deep water in the Mediterranean originates from three main areas: the [[Adriatic Sea]], from which most of the deep water in the eastern Mediterranean originates, the [[Aegean Sea]], and the [[Gulf of Lion]]. Deep water formation in the Mediterranean is triggered by strong winter [[convection]] fueled by intense cold winds like the [[Bora (wind)|Bora]]. When new deep water is formed, the older waters mix with the overlaying intermediate waters and eventually exit the Mediterranean. The [[Water cycle#Residence times|residence time of water]] in the Mediterranean is approximately 100 years, making the Mediterranean especially sensitive to climate change.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Millot |first1=C. |year=1989 |title=La Circulation G\u00e9n\u00e9rale En M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Occidentale : Aper\u00e7u De Nos Connaissances Et Projets D'\u00e9tudes |trans-title=General Circulation in the Western Mediterranean: Overview of Our Knowledge and Study Projects |language=French |journal=Annales de G\u00e9ographie |volume=98 |issue=549 |pages=497\u2013515 |jstor=23452851 |doi=10.3406/geo.1989.20925 }}</ref>\n\n===Other events affecting water circulation===\nBeing a semi-enclosed basin, the Mediterranean experiences transitory events that can affect the water circulation on short time scales. In the mid 1990s, the Aegean Sea became the main area for deep water formation in the eastern Mediterranean after particularly cold winter conditions. This transitory switch in the origin of deep waters in the eastern Mediterranean was termed Eastern Mediterranean Transient (EMT) and had major consequences on water circulation of the Mediterranean.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gasparini |first1=G.P. |last2=Ortona |first2=A. |last3=Budillon |first3=G. |last4=Astraldi |first4=M. |last5=Sansone |first5=E. |title=The effect of the Eastern Mediterranean Transient on the hydrographic characteristics in the Strait of Sicily and in the Tyrrhenian Sea |journal=Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers |date=June 2005 |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=915\u2013935 |doi=10.1016/j.dsr.2005.01.001 |bibcode=2005DSRI...52..915G }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lascaratos |first1=Alex |last2=Roether |first2=Wolfgang |last3=Nittis |first3=Kostas |last4=Klein |first4=Birgit |title=Recent changes in deep water formation and spreading in the eastern Mediterranean Sea: a review |journal=Progress in Oceanography |date=August 1999 |volume=44 |issue=1\u20133 |pages=5\u201336 |doi=10.1016/S0079-6611(99)00019-1 |bibcode=1999PrOce..44....5L }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Theocharis |first1=Alexander |last2=Nittis |first2=Kostas |last3=Kontoyiannis |first3=Harilaos |last4=Papageorgiou |first4=Emanuel |last5=Balopoulos |first5=Efstathios |title=Climatic changes in the Aegean Sea influence the eastern Mediterranean thermohaline circulation (1986\u20131997) |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |date=1 June 1999 |volume=26 |issue=11 |pages=1617\u20131620 |doi=10.1029/1999GL900320 |bibcode=1999GeoRL..26.1617T }}</ref>\n\nAnother example of a transient event affecting the Mediterranean circulation is the periodic inversion of the North Ionian Gyre, which is an [[Anticyclonic rotation|anticyclonic]] [[ocean gyre]] observed in the northern part of the [[Ionian Sea]], off the Greek coast. The transition from anticyclonic to cyclonic rotation of this gyre changes the origin of the waters fueling it; when the circulation is anticyclonic (most common), the waters of the gyre originate from the Adriatic Sea. When the circulation is cyclonic, the waters originate from the [[Levantine Sea]]. These waters have different physical and chemical characteristics, and the periodic inversion of the North Ionian Gyre (called Bimodal Oscillating System or BiOS) changes the Mediterranean circulation and biogeochemistry around the Adriatic and Levantine regions.<ref>Civitarese, G., Gacic, M., Lipizer, M., and Borzelli, G.

The Mediterranean Sea is commonly referred to as an LNLC (Low-Nutrient, Low-Chlorophyll) area. The Mediterranean Sea fits the definition of a [[desert]] as it has low precipitation and its nutrient contents are low, making it difficult for plants and animals to develop.\n\nThere are steep gradients in nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll concentrations and primary productivity in the Mediterranean. Nutrient concentrations in the western part of the basin are about double the concentrations in the eastern basin. The [[Alboran Sea]], close to the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], has a daily [[primary productivity]] of about 0.25 g C (grams of carbon) m<sup>\u22122</sup> day<sup>\u22121</sup> whereas the eastern basin has an average daily productivity of 0.16 g C m<sup>\u22122</sup> day<sup>\u22121</sup>.<ref>Uitz, J., Stramski, D., Gentili, B., D\u2019Ortenzio, F., and Claustre, H.

High (i.e. more than 0.5 grams of [[chlorophyll a|Chlorophyll ''a'']] per cubic meter) productivity occurs in coastal areas, close to the river mouths which are the primary suppliers of dissolved nutrients. The [[Gulf of Lion]] has a relatively high productivity because it is an area of high vertical mixing, bringing nutrients to the surface waters that can be used by [[phytoplankton]] to produce Chlorophyll ''a''.<ref name=\"Bosc, E. 2004\">Bosc, E., Bricaud, A., and Antoine, D.

Between March and April, spring offers the ideal trade-off between light intensity and nutrient concentrations in surface for a [[spring bloom]] to occur. In summer, high atmospheric temperatures lead to the warming of the surface waters. The resulting [[density]] difference virtually isolates the surface waters from the rest of the water column and nutrient exchanges are limited. As a consequence, primary productivity is very low between June and October.<ref>d\u2019Ortenzio, F. and Ribera d\u2019Alcal\u00e0, M. (2009).

Underlain by [[oceanic crust]], the sea basin was once thought to be a tectonic remnant of the ancient [[Tethys Ocean]]; it is now known to be a structurally younger basin, called the [[Neotethys]], which was first formed by the convergence of the [[African plate|African]] and [[Eurasian plate]]s during the Late [[Triassic]] and Early [[Jurassic]]. Because it is a near-landlocked body of water in a normally dry climate, the Mediterranean is subject to intensive evaporation and the precipitation of [[evaporites]]. The [[Messinian salinity crisis]] started about six million years ago (mya) when the Mediterranean became landlocked, and then essentially dried up. There are salt deposits accumulated on the bottom of the basin of more than a million cubic kilometres\u2014in some places more than three kilometres thick.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.2008.01031.x |title=Decoding the Mediterranean salinity crisis |journal=Sedimentology |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=95\u2013136 |year=2009 |last1=Ryan |first1=William B.

As Africa-Arabia drifted northward, it closed over the ancient [[Tethys Ocean]] which had earlier separated the two supercontinents [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]].\nAt about that time in the middle [[Jurassic]] period (roughly 170 million years ago {{dubious|date=November 2018}}) a much smaller sea basin, dubbed the [[Neotethys]], was formed shortly before the Tethys Ocean closed at its western (Arabian) end. The broad line of collisions pushed up a very long system of mountains from the [[Pyrenees]] in Spain to the [[Zagros Mountains]] in Iran in an episode of mountain-building tectonics known as the [[Alpine orogeny]]. The Neotethys grew larger during the episodes of collisions (and associated foldings and subductions) that occurred during the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] epochs (34 to 5.33 mya); see animation: [[Supercontinent|Africa-Arabia colliding with Eurasia]]. Accordingly, the Mediterranean [[Oceanic basin|basin]] consists of several stretched [[Tectonics|tectonic]] plates in [[subduction]] which are the foundation of the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea. Various zones of subduction contain the highest oceanic ridges, east of the [[Ionian Sea]] and south of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].

As mentioned, there were two earlier gateways: the [[Betic Corridor]] across southern Spain and the [[Rifian Corridor]] across northern Morocco. The Betic closed about 6 mya, causing the Messinian salinity crisis (MSC); the Rifian or possibly both gateways closed during the earlier [[Tortonian]] times, causing a \"[[Tortonian salinity crisis]]\" (from 11.6 to 7.2 mya), long before the MSC and lasting much longer. Both \"crises\" resulted in broad connections between the mainlands of Africa and Europe, which allowed migrations of flora and fauna\u2014especially large mammals including primates\u2014between the two continents. The [[Vallesian|Vallesian crisis]] indicates a typical extinction and replacement of mammal species in Europe during Tortonian times following climatic upheaval and overland migrations of new species:<ref>{{Cite book\n | last1 = Agusti | first1 = J\n | last2 = Moya-Sola | first2 = S\n | title = Mammal extinctions in the Vallesian (Upper Miocene)\n | volume = 30 | year = 1990 | pages = 425\u2013432\n | issn = 1613-2580 | doi = 10.1007/BFb0011163\n| series = Lecture Notes in Earth Sciences\n | isbn = 978-3-540-52605-6\n }} (Abstract)</ref> see Animation: Messinian salinity crisis (and mammal migrations), at right.\n\nThe almost complete enclosure of the Mediterranean basin has enabled the oceanic gateways to dominate seawater circulation and the environmental evolution of the sea and basin. Circulation patterns are also affected by several other factors\u2014including climate, bathymetry, and water chemistry and temperature\u2014which are interactive and can induce precipitation of [[evaporite]]s. Deposits of evaporites accumulated earlier in the nearby [[Geology of the Western Carpathians#Foredeep|Carpathian foredeep]] during the [[Middle Miocene]], and the adjacent [[Red Sea Basin]] (during the [[Late Miocene]]), and in the whole Mediterranean basin (during the MSC and the [[Messinian]] age). Many [[diatomite]]s are found underneath the evaporite deposits, suggesting a connection between their{{clarify|date=August 2019}} formations.\n\nToday, evaporation of surface seawater (output) is more than the supply (input) of fresh water by precipitation and coastal drainage systems, causing the salinity of the Mediterranean to be much higher than that of the Atlantic\u2014so much so that the saltier Mediterranean waters sink below the waters incoming from the Atlantic, causing a two-layer flow across the Strait of Gibraltar: that is, an outflow [[Strait of Gibraltar#Inflow and outflow|''submarine current'']] of warm saline Mediterranean water, counterbalanced by an inflow surface current of less saline cold oceanic water from the Atlantic. In the 1920s, Herman S\u00f6rgel proposed the building of a hydroelectric dam (the [[Atlantropa]] project) across the Straits, using the inflow current to provide a large amount of hydroelectric energy. The underlying energy grid was also intended to support a political union between Europe and, at least, the Maghreb part of Africa (compare [[Eurafrique|Eurafrika]] for the later impact and [[Desertec]] for a later project with some parallels in the planned grid).<ref>Politische Geographien Europas: Ann\u00e4herungen an ein umstrittenes Konstrukt, Anke Str\u00fcver, LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster, 2005, p. 43</ref>\n\n====Shift to a \"Mediterranean climate\"====\nThe end of the [[Miocene]] also marked a change in the climate of the Mediterranean basin. Fossil evidence from that period reveals that the larger basin had a humid subtropical climate with rainfall in the summer supporting [[laurel forest]]s. The shift to a \"Mediterranean climate\" occurred largely within the last three million years (the late [[Pliocene]] epoch) as summer rainfall decreased. The subtropical laurel forests retreated; and even as they persisted on the islands of [[Macaronesia]] off the Atlantic coast of Iberia and North Africa, the present Mediterranean vegetation evolved, dominated by coniferous trees and [[sclerophyllous]] trees and shrubs with small, hard, waxy leaves that prevent moisture loss in the dry summers. Much of these forests and shrublands have been altered beyond recognition by thousands of years of human habitation. There are now very few relatively intact natural areas in what was once a heavily wooded region.\n\n==Paleoclimate==\nBecause of its latitude and its land-locked position, the Mediterranean is especially sensitive to astronomically induced climatic variations, which are well documented in its sedimentary record. Since the Mediterranean is subject to the deposition of [[eolian dust]] from the [[Sahara]] during dry periods, whereas riverine [[detritus (geology)|detrital]] input prevails during wet ones, the Mediterranean marine [[sapropel]]-bearing sequences provide high-resolution climatic information. These data have been employed in reconstructing astronomically calibrated time scales for the last 9 Ma of the Earth's history, helping to constrain the time of past [[geomagnetic reversal]]s.<ref>FJ, Hilgen.

The stable [[marine ecosystem]] of the Mediterranean Sea and [[Sea surface temperature|sea temperature]] provides a nourishing environment for [[Marine biology|life in the deep sea]] to flourish while assuring a balanced [[aquatic ecosystem]] excluded from any external [[Deep sea|deep]] [[Ocean|oceanic factors]]. It is estimated that there are more than 17,000 [[Marine life|marine species]] in the Mediterranean Sea with generally higher marine [[biodiversity]] in [[Coast|coastal areas]], [[Continental shelf|continental shelves]], and decreases with depth.<ref>Coll, Marta, et al., \"The biodiversity of the Mediterranean Sea: estimates, patterns, and threats.\" ''PloS one 5.8'', 2010.</ref>\n\nAs a result of the drying of the sea during the [[Messinian salinity crisis]],<ref>[[Kenneth J.

The North Atlantic is considerably colder and more nutrient-rich than the Mediterranean, and the marine life of the Mediterranean has had to adapt to its differing conditions in the five million years since the basin was reflooded.\n\nThe [[Alboran Sea]] is a transition zone between the two seas, containing a mix of Mediterranean and Atlantic species. The Alboran Sea has the largest population of [[bottlenose dolphin]]s in the Western Mediterranean, is home to the last population of [[harbour porpoise]]s in the Mediterranean, and is the most important feeding grounds for [[loggerhead sea turtle]]s in Europe. The Alboran Sea also hosts important commercial fisheries, including [[sardine]]s and [[swordfish]]. The [[Mediterranean monk seal]]s live in the Aegean Sea in Greece. In 2003, the [[World Wildlife Fund]] raised concerns about the widespread [[drift net]] fishing endangering populations of dolphins, turtles, and other marine animals such as the [[Galathea strigosa|spiny squat lobster]].\n\nThere was a resident population of [[killer whale]] in the Mediterranean until the 1980s, when they went extinct, probably due to long term PCB exposure.

The Red Sea is higher than the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], so the canal functions as a [[tidal strait]] that pours Red Sea water into the Mediterranean. The [[Bitter Lakes]], which are hyper-saline natural lakes that form part of the canal, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalised with that of the Red Sea, the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonise the Eastern Mediterranean. The Red Sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the Atlantic, so the Red Sea species have advantages over Atlantic species in the salty and nutrient-poor Eastern Mediterranean. Accordingly, Red Sea species invade the Mediterranean biota, and not vice versa; this phenomenon is known as the [[Lessepsian migration]] (after [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], the French engineer) or Erythrean (\"red\") invasion. The construction of the [[Aswan High Dam]] across the [[Nile]] River in the 1960s reduced the inflow of freshwater and nutrient-rich [[silt]] from the Nile into the Eastern Mediterranean, making conditions there even more like the Red Sea and worsening the impact of the [[invasive species]].\n\nInvasive species have become a major component of the Mediterranean ecosystem and have serious impacts on the Mediterranean ecology, endangering many local and [[endemism|endemic]] Mediterranean species. A first look at some groups of exotic species shows that more than 70% of the non-indigenous [[Decapoda|decapod]]s and about 63% of the exotic fishes occurring in the Mediterranean are of Indo-Pacific origin,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.issg.org/infpaper_invasive.pdf |title=IUCN Guidelines for the Prevention of Biodiversity Loss Caused by Alien Invasive Species |accessdate=11 August 2009 |year=2000 |publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115235640/http://www.issg.org/infpaper_invasive.pdf |archivedate=15 January 2009 }}</ref> [[introduced species|introduced]] into the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal. This makes the Canal the first pathway of arrival of [[Introduced species|alien]] species into the Mediterranean. The impacts of some Lessepsian species have proven to be considerable, mainly in the Levantine basin of the Mediterranean, where they are replacing native species and becoming a familiar sight.\n\nAccording to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] definition, as well as [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and [[Ramsar Convention]] terminologies, they are alien species, as they are non-native (non-indigenous) to the Mediterranean Sea, and they are outside their normal area of distribution which is the Indo-Pacific region. When these species succeed in establishing populations in the Mediterranean Sea, compete with and begin to replace native species they are \"Alien Invasive Species\", as they are an agent of change and a threat to the native biodiversity. In the context of CBD, \"introduction\" refers to the movement by human agency, indirect or direct, of an alien species outside of its natural range (past or present). The Suez Canal, being an artificial (man made) canal, is a human agency. Lessepsian migrants are therefore \"introduced\" species (indirect, and unintentional). Whatever wording is chosen, they represent a threat to the native Mediterranean biodiversity, because they are non-indigenous to this sea. In recent years, the Egyptian government's announcement of its intentions to deepen and widen the canal have raised concerns from [[marine biologist]]s, fearing that such an act will only worsen the invasion of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean, and lead to even more species passing through the canal.<ref>Galil, B.S. and Zenetos, A.

It is estimated that approximately 220,000 [[merchant vessel]]s of more than 100 [[gross tonnage|tonnes]] cross the Mediterranean Sea each year\u2014about one third of the world's total merchant shipping. These ships often carry hazardous cargo, which if lost would result in severe damage to the marine environment.\n\nThe discharge of chemical tank washings and oily wastes also represent a significant source of marine pollution. The Mediterranean Sea constitutes 0.7% of the global water surface and yet receives 17% of global marine oil pollution. It is estimated that every year between {{convert|100000|t|LT|abbr=on}} and {{convert|150000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of crude oil are deliberately released into the sea from shipping activities.\n\nApproximately {{convert|370000000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of oil are transported annually in the Mediterranean Sea (more than 20% of the world total), with around 250\u2013300 [[oil tanker]]s crossing the sea every day. Accidental [[oil spill]]s happen frequently with an average of 10 spills per year.

The countries have tried to extinguish rising man-made chaotic zones{{clarify|date=August 2019}} that might affect the region's economies and societies in neighboring coastal countries, and [[shipping route]]s. Naval and rescue components in the Mediterranean Sea are considered to be among the best{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} due to the rapid cooperation between various [[List of fleets|naval fleets]].

However, tourism has also played major role in the [[environmental degradation|degradation]] of the coastal and [[marine environment]]. Rapid development has been encouraged by Mediterranean governments to support the large numbers of tourists visiting the region; but this has caused serious disturbance to [[marine habitat]]s by erosion and [[#Pollution|pollution]] in many places along the Mediterranean coasts.\n\nTourism often concentrates in areas of high natural wealth{{clarify|date=August 2019}}, causing a serious threat to the habitats of endangered species such as [[sea turtle]]s and [[monk seal]]s. Reductions in natural wealth may reduce the incentive for tourists to visit.<ref name=\"greenpeace.org\"/>\n\n{{see also|Environmental impact of tourism}}\n\n===Overfishing===\n{{main|overfishing}}\nFish stock levels in the Mediterranean Sea are alarmingly low. The European Environment Agency says that more than 65% of all fish stocks in the region are outside safe biological limits and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, that some of the most important fisheries\u2014such as [[albacore]] and [[Atlantic bluefin tuna|bluefin tuna]], [[hake]], [[marlin]], [[swordfish]], [[red mullet]] and [[sea bream]]\u2014are threatened.{{date missing}}\n\nThere are clear indications that catch size and quality have declined, often dramatically, and in many areas larger and longer-lived species have disappeared entirely from commercial catches.\n\nLarge open water fish like tuna have been a shared fisheries resource for thousands of years but the stocks are now dangerously low. In 1999, [[Greenpeace]] published a report revealing that the amount of bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean had decreased by over 80% in the previous 20 years and government scientists warn that without immediate action the stock will collapse.\n\n==Gallery==\n<!--Please limit the images in this gallery to only 1 image per country/territory-->\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"120px\" style=\"text-align:center\">\nFile:Hammametgolf.jpg|Beach of [[Hammamet, Tunisia|Hammamet]], Tunisia\nFile:Plage-de-la-courtade.jpg|The beach of la Courtade in the [[\u00celes d'Hy\u00e8res]], France\nFile:Chia beach, Sardinia, Italy.jpg|[[Sardinia]]'s south coast, Italy\nFile:Malta - Birzebbuga - Triq il-Bajja s-Sabiha + Pretty Bay + Gnien Mons.

From 1992 to 1999   Peter Henschel was Executive Director.\n\nIRL was a nonprofit research organization that looked at learning in  schools, workplaces, and informal settings, using collaborative, multidisciplinary teams. Research questions were based in real-world problems and settings defined in partnership with people in schools and workplaces who championed these activities. The institute had a significant impact on education and knowledge management (among many other fields) not only in the US but globally through the development of the concept of a [[community of practice]].<ref>Wenger, E. (1998) Communities of practice: learning, meaning, and identity. New York: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\n==Social Approach to Learning==\nThe first group of researchers was recruited from Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley, and from Xerox PARC, in disciplines including anthropology, computer science,  education, psychology, and linguistics.\n\nThe institute developed its unique social approach to learning, expressed in the [[Seven Principles of Learning]] and in the conception of communities-of-practice. Its innovative view of learning, the use of qualitative methods and the coupling of research with design were path breaking in its time, inspired an enthusiastic following and have enriched organizational and educational discourses to this day.\n\n===IRL's Seven Principles of Learning===\n#Learning is fundamentally social.\n#Knowledge is integrated in the life of communities.\n#Learning is an act of membership.\n#Knowing depends on engagement in practice.\n#Engagement is inseparable from empowerment.\n#\u201cFailure to Learn\u201d is the normal result of exclusion from participation.\n#We already have a society of [[lifelong learning|lifelong learners]].\n\n== IRL\u2019s Core Capabilities==\n\nIRL defined its core capabilities as:\n*\tLearning to see Learning\n*\tDesign for Learning \n*\tLearning and Work Design\n*\tLearning, Identity and Diversity\n\nIRL's projects were grouped into research settings:\n\n;Research of Learning in the Classroom:\n*Funding from Education Grants. (NSF, Hearst Foundation and others)\n*Researchers: Shelley Goldman, Jim Greeno, Jennifer Knudsen, Ray McDermott, Angela Booker, Karen Cole, Ralph Manak, Judit Moschkovich, [[Roy Pea]], Tina Syer, and more.\n*Partners and clients: NSF, US Dept. of Education, Hearst Foundation, Spencer Foundation, Stanford University, Middle Schools in the Bay Area and more.\n*Research focused on Learning in the K 8- 12 classroom, with special emphasis on mathematics as the greatest hurdle to school success. Researchers developed alternatives to, and support of, traditional math modules by embedding mathematical topics in practical tasks (e.g. design of a building) executed in groups and with computers.\n\n;Research on Learning in the Workplace:\n* Financed through corporate sponsorship.\n* Research projects for corporate clients. Research topics were co-developed with the corporate clients to have academic and corporate relevance. Results were shared with the client and a network of affiliates in the form of articles, reports and presentations. \n* Researchers: Libby Bishop, Melissa Cefkin, [[William Clancey]], Chris Darrouzet, Gitte Jordan, Ted Kahn, Charlotte Linde, Patricia Sachs, Susan Stucky, Eric Vinkhuyzen, Etienne Wenger, Marilyn and Jack Whalen, Helga Wild, and more.\n* Partners and clients: e.g. [[Xerox Corporation]], [[State Farm]] Insurance, [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Nynex]], [[Steelcase]], [[Hermann Miller]], [[IDEO]], [[Stanford University]], and more.\n;Research Initiative on Learning, Identity and Diversity:\n* Researchers: Penny Eckert, Charlotte Linde, working on social identity and memory through sociolinguistic analysis and the analysis of an organization's (his)tories.\n\n== History and Philosophy of IRL==\nThe chief scientist at [[Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC), John Seely Brown, psychologist by training, saw the computer revolution open up the possibility of dramatic changes in learning. He gained the support of [[David Kearns]], CEO of Xerox Corporation, who encouraged the Xerox Foundation to grant a substantial amount of money to the creation of an institution to study learning and innovation in the context of the use of computers.\n\nThe institute was to operate as an independent entity, even though it was incubated with the knowledge and the assistance of key people from Xerox PARC. It gradually weaned itself from dependence on the grant and earned its keep by the fruits of its research.\n\nThe institute was named Institute for Research on Learning (IRL) and founded in 1988. Its first director was George Pake, a physicist from PARC. Its staff was composed of an inter-disciplinary group of researchers: recruited in part from PARC and from Stanford and UC Berkeley. Researchers came from the disciplines of education, linguistics, anthropology, computer science, and psychology. Of particular note, James G. Greeno, a senior educational psychologist, worked to define themes and guide research projects throughout IRL's history. This first generation of researchers developed the vision and methodology for the institute. They were inspired by anthropology's conception of learning as a social and cultural phenomenon and inspired by books like \u201cSituated Learning\u201d (Co-authors Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger were members of the institute).<ref>Lave, J. and Wenger, E. (1991) Situated learning: legitimate peripheral participation.  New York: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nThe institute adopted [[ethnography]] as its main research method, a factor that distinguished it in major ways from other thinktanks. \nUnder this influence the initial image of learning as an individual's interaction with knowledge mediated possibly by computational tools made way for a vision of learning as apprenticeship. In apprenticeship the knowledge content could not be isolated from the learner's social status in a socio-cultural field: apprentices had to be received into a community \u2013 a guild, profession or team \u2013 and migrated within this group from the periphery towards greater and greater participation in the social and professional activities.\n\nThe learning process was seen to be substantially one of interaction with the members of one's own community or group first and with related social groups and networks secondarily. From gaining access to a practice to learning how it is carried out by this group, to collaborating with peers on a shared task or agenda, and finally socializing others as an established member \u2013 all these were aspects of learning but also evidence of transformations of identity. They establish both the position of the learner and the content of what is to be learned as part of a social practice shaped by and shaping a material and institutional environment.\n\nIRL's social perspective opened up areas of learning where none had been suspected before. Learning was found to be present not just in schools and training camps, but also in clubs, prisons, neighborhoods, in highly formalized as well as highly informal settings.\n\nIn traditional schools and workplaces, social interaction was often frowned upon as an interruption of work proper. It was the institute's conviction and commitment to convince the public otherwise. The school part of the institute took on the key gatekeeper in Middle School, mathematics, and created social and practical learning substitutes for the individualized learning tasks in the school curriculum. For instance, instead of teaching fractions in the traditional manner through a series of manipulations of numbers, they developed collaborative design exercises that involved fractions in a practical context \u2013 designing a room layout and furniture \u2013 that taught students the relevance of fractions in maintaining proportions and gave them a grounded understanding as well as a practical use.\n\nThe analogous research on the industry side consisted in ethnographic projects in organizations to uncover social forms of learning inside the workplace and to enhance what benefits they could bring to the corporation. These enhancements could relate to the spatial and institutional aspects of work: Several large projects were dedicated to designing work processes, strategies and workplaces in support of the social aspects of work. They could focus on furniture and technology, on organizational processes or on team building, orientation and training. What all had in common was the theoretical position of the institute \u2013 to treat a corporation as a social entity composed of individuals and communities formed around key practices or competencies. Communities-of-Practice were seen as building blocks for learning and identity formation and as holders of organizational know-how.\n\nDuring its twelve years of pioneering research, IRL had developed and disseminated many radical advances in social and cognitive science: the use of systematic ethnographic methods to study organizations, the social approach to learning, research projects with corporate clients, emphasis on communities and social networks as instrumental for innovation and organizational knowledge, and the awareness of the informal aspects of an organization.\n\nThroughout those twelve years the institute managed to keep itself afloat through national and other grants and specialized corporate projects. It hired researchers, developed a network of affiliates and corporate sponsors, conducted industry retreats, delivered reports and presentations, and contributed to journals and conferences. In 2000, as the dotcom bubble was bursting, funding for learning research projects became hard to come by. After the institute lost a major project at the end of its fiscal year, the decision was made to cease operations. A number of key educational projects and research staff were transferred into WestEd, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research, development, and service agency which also worked with education and other communities throughout the United States and abroad.\n\nAfter the institute closed, staff members and researchers dispersed, some back to universities, some to other research institutions such as WestEd noted above and to [[NASA Ames]].  Others returned to the corporate sector or made their way newly into the corporate world to work in the emerging field of business anthropology or Ethnographic practice in corporations.\n\n=== IRL Projects and Researchers (from Annual Reports) ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

From 1992 to 1999   Peter Henschel was Executive Director.\n\nIRL was a nonprofit research organization that looked at learning in  schools, workplaces, and informal settings, using collaborative, multidisciplinary teams. Research questions were based in real-world problems and settings defined in partnership with people in schools and workplaces who championed these activities. The institute had a significant impact on education and knowledge management (among many other fields) not only in the US but globally through the development of the concept of a [[community of practice]].<ref>Wenger, E. (1998) Communities of practice: learning, meaning, and identity. New York: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\n==Social Approach to Learning==\nThe first group of researchers was recruited from Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley, and from Xerox PARC, in disciplines including anthropology, computer science,  education, psychology, and linguistics.\n\nThe institute developed its unique social approach to learning, expressed in the [[Seven Principles of Learning]] and in the conception of communities-of-practice. Its innovative view of learning, the use of qualitative methods and the coupling of research with design were path breaking in its time, inspired an enthusiastic following and have enriched organizational and educational discourses to this day.\n\n===IRL's Seven Principles of Learning===\n#Learning is fundamentally social.\n#Knowledge is integrated in the life of communities.\n#Learning is an act of membership.\n#Knowing depends on engagement in practice.\n#Engagement is inseparable from empowerment.\n#\u201cFailure to Learn\u201d is the normal result of exclusion from participation.\n#We already have a society of [[lifelong learning|lifelong learners]].\n\n== IRL\u2019s Core Capabilities==\n\nIRL defined its core capabilities as:\n*\tLearning to see Learning\n*\tDesign for Learning \n*\tLearning and Work Design\n*\tLearning, Identity and Diversity\n\nIRL's projects were grouped into research settings:\n\n;Research of Learning in the Classroom:\n*Funding from Education Grants. (NSF, Hearst Foundation and others)\n*Researchers: Shelley Goldman, Jim Greeno, Jennifer Knudsen, Ray McDermott, Angela Booker, Karen Cole, Ralph Manak, Judit Moschkovich, Tina Syer, and more.\n*Partners and clients: NSF, Dep. of Education, Hearst Foundation Spencer Foundation, Stanford University, Middle Schools in the Bay Area and more.\n*Research focused on Learning in the K 8- 12 classroom, with special emphasis on mathematics as the greatest hurdle to school success. Researchers developed alternatives to, and support of, traditional math modules by embedding mathematical topics in practical tasks (e.g. design of a building) executed in groups and with computers.\n\n;Research on Learning in the Workplace:\n* Financed through corporate sponsorship.\n* Research projects for corporate clients. Research topics were co-developed with the corporate clients to have academic and corporate relevance. Results were shared with the client and a network of affiliates in the form of articles, reports and presentations. \n* Researchers: Libby Bishop, Melissa Cefkin, [[William Clancey]], Chris Darrouzet, Gitte Jordan, Ted Kahn, Charlotte Linde, Patricia Sachs, Susan Stucky, Eric Vinkhuyzen, Etienne Wenger, Marilyn and Jack Whalen, Helga Wild, and more.\n* Partners and clients: e.g. [[Xerox Corporation]], [[State Farm]] Insurance, [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Nynex]], [[Steelcase]], [[Hermann Miller]], [[IDEO]], [[Stanford University]], and more.\n;Research Initiative on Learning, Identity and Diversity:\n* Researchers: Penny Eckert, Charlotte Linde, working on social identity and memory through sociolinguistic analysis and the analysis of an organization's (his)tories.\n\n== History and Philosophy of IRL==\nThe chief scientist at [[Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC), John Seely Brown, psychologist by training, saw the computer revolution open up the possibility of dramatic changes in learning. He gained the support of [[David Kearns]], CEO of Xerox Corporation, who encouraged the Xerox Foundation to grant a substantial amount of money to the creation of an institution to study learning and innovation in the context of the use of computers.\n\nThe institute was to operate as an independent entity, even though it was incubated with the knowledge and the assistance of key people from Xerox PARC. It gradually weaned itself from dependence on the grant and earned its keep by the fruits of its research.\n\nThe institute was named Institute for Research on Learning (IRL) and founded in 1988. Its first director was George Pake, a physicist from PARC. Its staff was composed of an inter-disciplinary group of researchers: recruited in part from PARC and from Stanford and UC Berkeley. Researchers came from the disciplines of education, linguistics, anthropology, computer science, and psychology. Of particular note, James G. Greeno, a senior educational psychologist, worked to define themes and guide research projects throughout IRL's history. This first generation of researchers developed the vision and methodology for the institute. They were inspired by anthropology's conception of learning as a social and cultural phenomenon and inspired by books like \u201cSituated Learning\u201d (Co-authors Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger were members of the institute).<ref>Lave, J. and Wenger, E. (1991) Situated learning: legitimate peripheral participation.  New York: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nThe institute adopted [[ethnography]] as its main research method, a factor that distinguished it in major ways from other thinktanks. \nUnder this influence the initial image of learning as an individual's interaction with knowledge mediated possibly by computational tools made way for a vision of learning as apprenticeship. In apprenticeship the knowledge content could not be isolated from the learner's social status in a socio-cultural field: apprentices had to be received into a community \u2013 a guild, profession or team \u2013 and migrated within this group from the periphery towards greater and greater participation in the social and professional activities.\n\nThe learning process was seen to be substantially one of interaction with the members of one's own community or group first and with related social groups and networks secondarily. From gaining access to a practice to learning how it is carried out by this group, to collaborating with peers on a shared task or agenda, and finally socializing others as an established member \u2013 all these were aspects of learning but also evidence of transformations of identity. They establish both the position of the learner and the content of what is to be learned as part of a social practice shaped by and shaping a material and institutional environment.\n\nIRL's social perspective opened up areas of learning where none had been suspected before. Learning was found to be present not just in schools and training camps, but also in clubs, prisons, neighborhoods, in highly formalized as well as highly informal settings.\n\nIn traditional schools and workplaces, social interaction was often frowned upon as an interruption of work proper. It was the institute's conviction and commitment to convince the public otherwise. The school part of the institute took on the key gatekeeper in Middle School, mathematics, and created social and practical learning substitutes for the individualized learning tasks in the school curriculum. For instance, instead of teaching fractions in the traditional manner through a series of manipulations of numbers, they developed collaborative design exercises that involved fractions in a practical context \u2013 designing a room layout and furniture \u2013 that taught students the relevance of fractions in maintaining proportions and gave them a grounded understanding as well as a practical use.\n\nThe analogous research on the industry side consisted in ethnographic projects in organizations to uncover social forms of learning inside the workplace and to enhance what benefits they could bring to the corporation. These enhancements could relate to the spatial and institutional aspects of work: Several large projects were dedicated to designing work processes, strategies and workplaces in support of the social aspects of work. They could focus on furniture and technology, on organizational processes or on team building, orientation and training. What all had in common was the theoretical position of the institute \u2013 to treat a corporation as a social entity composed of individuals and communities formed around key practices or competencies. Communities-of-Practice were seen as building blocks for learning and identity formation and as holders of organizational know-how.\n\nDuring its twelve years of pioneering research, IRL had developed and disseminated many radical advances in social and cognitive science: the use of systematic ethnographic methods to study organizations, the social approach to learning, research projects with corporate clients, emphasis on communities and social networks as instrumental for innovation and organizational knowledge, and the awareness of the informal aspects of an organization.\n\nThroughout those twelve years the institute managed to keep itself afloat through national and other grants and specialized corporate projects. It hired researchers, developed a network of affiliates and corporate sponsors, conducted industry retreats, delivered reports and presentations, and contributed to journals and conferences. In 2000, as the dotcom bubble was bursting, funding for learning research projects became hard to come by. After the institute lost a major project at the end of its fiscal year, the decision was made to cease operations. A number of key educational projects and research staff were transferred into WestEd, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research, development, and service agency which also worked with education and other communities throughout the United States and abroad.\n\nAfter the institute closed, staff members and researchers dispersed, some back to universities, some to other research institutions such as WestEd noted above and to [[NASA Ames]].  Others returned to the corporate sector or made their way newly into the corporate world to work in the emerging field of business anthropology or Ethnographic practice in corporations.\n\n=== IRL Projects and Researchers (from Annual Reports) ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
