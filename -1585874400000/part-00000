{"title_page": "NCFC", "text_new": "The abbreviation '''NCFC''' may refer to: \n\nNCFC (No Crown For Chop)\n\nNCFC is a cult/fraternity group established by JWM, LRE, CLE, and WEDH. Main ideas are getting extremely under the influence(studies show either alcohol or marijuana) at what some call \u201cGrand Haven\u201d or \u201c616\u201d at any and every moment possible. The acronym \u201cNCFC\u201d was formed the first night CLE went to Grand Haven, in which he proceeded to take 10+ double shots of crown royale whiskey, and he puked in the bathroom for the entirety of the night while JRE proceeded to go unconscious from excessive alcohol intake. From that night forward they had established that CLE is not allowed to drink crown anymore, thus creating \u201cno crown for chop\u201d, otherwise known as the infamous \u201cNCFC\u201d.\n\n\nNCFC Past Events\n\nAlthough many of these cult/fraternity meeting have went without large recognition, only two major events have happened throughout this cults history. The first documented account of this group (other than the start) was late June or early July. With the extension of a few new members this malicious group decided to have a cookout. With the endeavors of WEDH accumulation of a large amount of alcohol and beef they put the plan in action. They hired and recruited Chef \u201cBean\u201d to cook and serve burgers. After a long night of destroying livers, brain cells, and JWM bed frame the night came to an end.\n\nAnother documented account of this frat was shortly after \u201cThe Cookout\u201d took place at a females house who goes by the name of \u201cSnake\u201d and he foreign friend \u201cBofum\u201d. After a DEA agent almost caught the group lackin 4 beers down the group pulled through and proceeded to act normal. At approximately 8:30 PM LRE received a phone call with commands of returning home there were only three members left, JWM, CLE, WEDH. With the last remaining three members remaining they continued their mission to get face throttled. After three hours of straight alcohol consumption one particular member happened to pass out on snakes futon. After he laid there for approximately ten minutes the boys check on him and he had vomited on the futon. After seeing such blasphemy snake requested that they leave immediately. While the two drunk members tried to corral their friend who was blacked out intoxicated CLE had a sudden urge that he was not done parting. WEDH assured CLE that he had them covered and he had a spot. While guiding their friend JWM to the exit of the house, almost knocking over every vase, picture, or anything of value, the trio finally made it out the door. When they made it out JWM finally gained a small amount of consciousness and mustered a few words implying how intoxicated he was by saying \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in gta and I just left the bar\u201d. After hearing the remark the boys knew the had to get on his level, so to the next party they ensued. After CLE had driven WEDH vehicle to said location they knew it was go time. Although JWM was passed out in the back seat of WEDH vehicle (commonly referred to as the \u201cShaggin Wagon\u201d or \u201cCocaine Train\u201d) the boys pressed onwards. CLE consumed a small amount of marijuana and WEDH consumed approximately 1/2 of Smirnoff Vodka. After approximately an hour of partying the duo realized they were running out of time to make it back to 616. They made their way back to the Shaggin Wagon and booked it back to 616. They made it back to the Haven around 3 AM and no one got hurt.\n\n\nThe Breakup\n\nAlthough this group had been through a lot together they couldn\u2019t seem to fix an ongoing issue with the group. After someone had allegedly stole some property from 616 and no one could figure out, accusations started to fly. After accusing many new members that they had taken the property and kicking them out there were only 6 left. The group-chat had died and CLE had been banned from 616 due to altercations. After a quiet week or to the NCFC group-chat went live with cap. After large amounts of arguing had ensued everyone had finally left and it was over.\n\n\nThe Make Up\n\nAlthough they had broken the group up and had many personal disputes, the group members still kicked it every now and then. But around Jan.-Feb. they banded back together. The group reunited and have been reported with more individuals and more power. Although the late 2019 COVID-19 had slowed the plans of NCFC there has been reports of them in NAC and still have been sightings of them at 616.\n\n\n==Football (soccer) clubs==\n*[[Norwich City F.C.]]\n*[[Notts County F.C.]]\n*[[Newport County A.F.C.]]\n*[[Nairn County F.C.]]\n*[[North Carolina FC]]\n*[[North Carolina FC Youth]] (NCFC Youth)\n\n==Other uses==\n* [[Neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous syndromes]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[NCAFC (disambiguation)]]\n\n{{disambig}}\n", "text_old": "The abbreviation '''NCFC''' may refer to:\n\n==Football (soccer) clubs==\n*[[Norwich City F.C.]]\n*[[Notts County F.C.]]\n*[[Newport County A.F.C.]]\n*[[Nairn County F.C.]]\n*[[North Carolina FC]]\n*[[North Carolina FC Youth]] (NCFC Youth)\n\n==Other uses==\n* [[Neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous syndromes]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[NCAFC (disambiguation)]]\n\n{{disambig}}\n", "name_user": "HuntingtonHistory", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Defined the real meaning of NCFC)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCFC"}

Prior to 1390 there are some similar images such as the [[Pray Codex]]. However, what is claimed by some to be the image of a shroud on the Pray Codex has crosses on one side, an interlocking step pyramid pattern on the other, and no image of Jesus. Critics point out that it may not be a shroud at all, but rather a rectangular tombstone, as seen on other sacred images.<ref>G.M.Rinaldi, \"Il Codice Pray\", http://sindone.weebly.com/pray.html</ref>  The text of the codex also fails to mention a miraculous image on the codex shroud.\n\nThe first possible historical record dates from 1353 or 1357.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" /><ref>{{Cite news |date=31 January 2005 |title=Turin shroud 'older than thought' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4210369.stm |work=BBC News}}</ref> and the first certain record (in [[Lirey]], [[France]]) in 1390 when Bishop Pierre d'Arcis wrote a [[memorandum]] to [[Antipope Clement VII|Pope Clement VII]] (Avignon Obedience), stating that the shroud was a forgery and that the artist had confessed.<ref name=\"Poulle 2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Poulle |first1=Emmanuel |authorlink=Emmanuel Poulle |title=Les sources de l'histoire du linceul de Turin.

In 1453 Margaret de Charny deeded the Shroud to the [[House of Savoy]]. In 1578 the shroud was transferred to Turin. Since the 17th century the shroud has been displayed (e.g. in the chapel built for that purpose by [[Guarino Guarini]]<ref>John Beldon Scott, ''Architecture for the shroud: relic and ritual in Turin'', University of Chicago Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-226-74316-0}}, p. xxi</ref>) and in the 19th century it was first photographed during a public exhibition.\n\nIn 1532, the shroud suffered damage from a fire in a chapel of [[Chamb\u00e9ry]], capital of the [[Savoy]] region, where it was stored. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. [[Poor Clare Nuns]] attempted to repair this damage with patches.

Among the most prominent portable early ''acheiropoieta'' are the [[Image of Camuliana]] and the [[Mandylion]] or Image of [[Edessa]], both painted icons of Christ held in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and now generally regarded as lost or destroyed, as is the [[Hodegetria]] image of the Virgin.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kitzinger |first1=Ernst |title=The Cult of Images in the Age before Iconoclasm |journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers |date=1954 |volume=8 |pages=83\u2013150 |doi=10.2307/1291064 |jstor=1291064}}</ref> Other early images in Italy, all heavily and unfortunately restored, that have been revered as ''acheiropoieta'' now have relatively little following, as attention has focused on the Shroud.\n\nProponents for the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin argue that empirical analysis and scientific methods are insufficient for understanding the methods used for image formation on the shroud, believing that the image was miraculously produced at the moment of [[Resurrection of Christ|Resurrection]].<ref>Charles S.

John Jackson (a member of [[Shroud of Turin Research Project|STURP]]) proposed that the image was formed by radiation methods beyond the understanding of current science, in particular via the \"collapsing cloth\" onto a body that was radiating energy at the moment of resurrection.<ref name=\"Ruffin155\">''The Shroud of Turin'' by Bernard Ruffin 1999 {{ISBN|0-87973-617-8}}, pp. 155\u2013156</ref> However, STURP member Alan Adler has stated that Jackson's theory is not generally accepted as scientific, given that it runs counter to the laws of physics.<ref name=\"Ruffin155\" /> In 1989 physicist Thomas Phillips speculated that the Shroud image was formed by [[neutron radiation]] due to a miraculous bodily resurrection.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Phillips |first1=Thomas J. |title=Shroud irradiated with neutrons? |journal=Nature |date=16 February 1989 |volume=337 |issue=6208 |pages=594 |doi=10.1038/337594a0|bibcode=1989Natur.337..594P }}</ref>\n\n===Vatican position===\n[[Antipope Clement VII]] refrained from expressing his opinion on the shroud; however, subsequent popes from [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]] on took its authenticity for granted.<ref>\"Shroud of Turin (relic)\".

The authorization was granted and the first medal with the image was offered to [[Pope Pius XII]] who approved the medal. The image was then used on what became known as the [[Holy Face Medal]] worn by many Catholics, initially as a means of protection during World War II. In 1958 Pope Pius XII approved of the image in association with the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, and declared its [[Feast of the Holy Winding Sheet of Christ|feast]] to be celebrated every year the day before [[Ash Wednesday]].<ref>Maria Rigamonti, ''Mother Maria Pierina'', Cenacle Publishing, 1999</ref><ref>Joan Carroll Cruz, \"Saintly Men of Modern Times\", ''Our Sunday Visitor'', 2003, {{ISBN|1-931709-77-7}}</ref> Following the approval by Pope Pius XII, Catholic devotions to the Holy Face of Jesus have been almost exclusively associated with the image on the shroud.\n\nIn 1983 the Shroud was given to the Holy See by the [[House of Savoy]].<ref name=\"Michael Freze 1993, p. 57\">Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing, {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}, p. 57</ref> However, as with all relics of this kind, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] made no pronouncements on its authenticity.

A variety of scientific theories regarding the shroud have since been proposed, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis. The scientific approaches to the study of the Shroud fall into three groups: ''material analysis'' (both chemical and historical), ''biology and medical forensics'' and ''image analysis''.\n\n===Early studies===\n<!--THIS IS AN ENCYCLOPEDIA ARTICLE AND IS NOT INTENDED TO\nINCLUDE ENTIRE PASSAGES FROM BOOKS AND OTHER REFERENCES.\n\nPLEASE ADD INFORMATION IN A \"CONCISE\" FORM WITHOUT\nQUOTING LARGE SEGMENTS OF TEXT, IN ORDER TO KEEP THE\nARTICLE LENGTH WITHIN WIKIPEDIA LIMITS.

In 1902 [[Yves Delage]], a French professor of [[comparative anatomy]], published the first study on the subject.<ref name=\"Delage, Yves 1902\" /> Delage declared the image anatomically flawless and argued that the features of [[rigor mortis]], wounds, and blood flows were evidence that the image was formed by direct or indirect contact with a corpse. William Meacham mentions several other medical studies between 1936 and 1981 that agree with Delage.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" /> These were all indirect studies without access to the shroud itself.\n\nThe first direct examination of the shroud by a scientific team was undertaken in 1969\u20131973 in order to advise on preservation of the shroud and determine specific testing methods. This led to the appointment of an 11-member Turin Commission to advise on the preservation of the relic and on specific testing. Five of the commission members were scientists, and preliminary studies of samples of the fabric were conducted in 1973.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" />\n\nIn 1976 physicist John P. Jackson, thermodynamicist Eric Jumper and photographer William Mottern used [[image analysis]] technologies developed in aerospace science for analyzing the images of the Shroud. In 1977 these three scientists and over thirty others formed the [[Shroud of Turin Research Project]]. In 1978 this group, often called STURP, was given direct access to the Shroud.\n\nAlso in 1978, independently from the STURP research, Giovanni Tamburelli obtained at [[CSELT]] a 3D-elaboration from the Shroud with higher resolution than Jumper and Mottern. A second result of Tamburelli was the electronic removal from the image of the blood that apparently covers the face.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tamburelli |first1=Giovanni |title=Some Results in the Processing of the Holy Shroud of Turin |journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence |date=November 1981 |volume=PAMI-3 |issue=6 |pages=670\u2013676 |doi=10.1109/TPAMI.1981.4767168|pmid=21868987 }}</ref>\n\n===Material chemical analysis===\n[[File:discyellow.jpg |thumbnail |Phase contrast microscopic view of image-bearing fiber from the Shroud of Turin.

In addition, the rivulets on the front of the image are not consistent with the lines on the lumbar area, even supposing there might have been different episodes of bleeding at different times.

In fact, Jesus' hands and face are depicted with great detail, while his buttocks and his navel are faintly outlined or invisible, a discrepancy explained with the artist's consideration of modesty. Also, Jesus' right arm and hand are abnormally elongated, allowing him to modestly cover his genital area, which is physically impossible for an ordinary dead body lying supine. No wrinkles or other irregularities distort the image, which is improbable if the cloth had covered the irregular form of a body. For comparison, see [[oshiguma]]; the making of face-prints as an artform, in Japan.

To demonstrate this, he successfully produced photographic images similar to the shroud using only techniques and materials available at the time the shroud was supposedly made. He described his results in his PhD thesis,<ref>Allen, Nicholas P. L.

They first did a carbon-dust drawing of a Jesus-like face (using collagen dust) on a newsprint made from wood pulp (which is similar to 13th- and 14th-century paper). They next placed the drawing on a table and covered it with a piece of linen. They then pressed the linen against the newsprint by firmly rubbing with the flat side of a wooden spoon. By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three-dimensional image and no sign of brush strokes.<ref>Craig, Emily A, Bresee, Randal R, \"Image Formation and the Shroud of Turin\", ''Journal of Imaging Science and Technology'', Volume 34, Number 1, 1994</ref> However, according to Fanti and Moroni, this does not reproduce many special features of the Shroud at microscopic level.<ref name=Fanti2002/>\n\n====Bas-relief====\nIn 1978, [[Joe Nickell]] noted that the Shroud image had a three-dimensional quality and thought its creation may have involved a sculpture of some type. He advanced the hypothesis that a medieval rubbing technique was used to explain the image, and set out to demonstrate this. He noted that while wrapping a cloth around a sculpture with normal contours would result in a distorted image, Nickell believed that wrapping a cloth over a [[bas-relief]] might result in an image like the one seen on the shroud, as it would eliminate wraparound distortions. For his demonstration, Nickell wrapped a wet cloth around a bas-relief sculpture and allowed it to dry. He then applied powdered pigment rather than wet paint (to prevent it soaking into the threads). The pigment was applied with a dauber, similar to making a rubbing from a gravestone. The result was an image with dark regions and light regions convincingly arranged. In a photo essay in ''[[Popular Photography]]'' magazine, Nickell demonstrated this technique step-by-step.<ref name = JNInquest/><ref name =PopPhoto>{{cite journal |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe |title=The Turin Shroud: Fake? Fact? Photograph? |journal=Popular Photography |volume=November 1979 |page=97-147}}</ref>{{efn|For his pigment, Nickell first used the burial spices myrrh and aloes, but changed to red iron oxide (the pigment [[Ochre|red ocher]]) when microanalyst, [[Walter McCrone]] identified it as constituting the shroud\u2019s image. (McCrone had identified the blood as red ochre and [[vermilion]] tempers paint.)<ref name = JNInquest/>}} Other researchers later replicated this process. \n\nIn 2005, researcher Jacques di Costanzo constructed a bas-relief of a Jesus-like face and draped wet linen over it. After the linen dried, he dabbed it with a mixture of [[ferric oxide]] and [[gelatine]]. The result was an image similar to that of the face on the Shroud. The imprinted image turned out to be wash-resistant, impervious to temperatures of {{convert |250 |C |abbr=on}} and was undamaged by exposure to a range of harsh chemicals, including bisulphite which, without the gelatine, would normally have degraded ferric oxide to the compound ferrous oxide.<ref name=\"'Ingham\">{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Ingham |title=Turin Shroud Confirmed as Fake |date=21 June 2005 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |url=http://www.physorg.com/news4652.html |work=Physorg.com |pages=|access-date=17 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nInstead of painting, it has been suggested that the bas-relief could also be heated and used to scorch an image onto the cloth. However researcher Thibault Heimburger performed some experiments with the scorching of linen, and found that a scorch mark is only produced by direct contact with the hot object\u2014thus producing an all-or-nothing discoloration with no graduation of color as is found in the shroud.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/scorch-paper-en.pdf |title=The Turin Shroud Body Image: The Scorch Hypothesis Revisited |author=Thibault Heimburger |accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Fanti and Moroni, after comparing the [[Color histogram|histogram]]s of 256 different grey levels, it was found that the image obtained with a bas-relief has grey values included between 60 and 256 levels, but it is much contrasted with wide areas of white saturation (levels included between 245 and 256) and lacks of intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200). The face image on the Shroud instead has grey tonalities that vary in the same values field (between 60 and 256), but the white saturation is much less marked and the histogram is practically flat in correspondence of the intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200).<ref name=Fanti2002>{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |last2=Moroni |first2=M. |title=Comparison of Luminance Between Face of Turin Shroud Man and Experimental Results |journal=Journal of Imaging Science and Technology |date=1 March 2002 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=142\u2013154 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ist/jist/2002/00000046/00000002/art00009#expand/collapse |accessdate=1 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Maillard reaction====\nThe [[Maillard reaction]] is a form of non-enzymatic browning involving an amino acid and a reducing sugar. The [[cellulose]] fibers of the shroud are coated with a thin [[carbohydrate]] layer of [[starch]] fractions, various [[sugars]], and other impurities.

Rogers|Raymond Rogers]] and Anna Arnoldi propose that [[amine]]s from a recently deceased human body may have undergone Maillard reactions with this carbohydrate layer within a reasonable period of time, before liquid [[decomposition]] products stained or damaged the cloth. The gases produced by a dead body are extremely reactive chemically and within a few hours, in an environment such as a tomb, a body starts to produce heavier amines in its tissues such as [[putrescine]] and [[cadaverine]]. However the potential source for amines required for the reaction is a decomposing body,<ref name=Rogers2008/>{{rp|100}} and no signs of decomposition have been found on the Shroud.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shroudcentersocal.com/ |format= |title=Features of the Center |publisher=Shroud Center of Southern California |access-date=27 March 2010}}</ref> Rogers also notes that their tests revealed that there were no proteins or bodily fluids on the image areas.<ref name=Rogers2008/>{{rp|38}} Also, the image resolution and the uniform coloration of the linen resolution seem to be incompatible with a mechanism involving diffusion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |last2=Botella |first2=J.

Giulio Fanti, a scientist at the [[University of Padua]], wrote an article on this subject with colleagues in 2005 that envisages electrostatic [[corona discharge]] as the probable mechanism to produce the images of the body in the Shroud.<ref>G.

As with the front picture, it is entirely superficial, with coloration limited to the carbohydrate layer. The images correspond to, and are in registration with, those on the other side of the cloth. No image is detectable in the reverse side of the dorsal view of the body.\n\nRaymond Rogers criticized the theory, saying: \"It is clear that a corona discharge (plasma) in air will cause easily observable changes in a linen sample.

They demonstrated that the photochemical reactions caused by exposing linen to [[ultraviolet]] light could reproduce the main characteristics of the Shroud image, such as the shallowness of the coloration and the gradient of the color, which are not reproducible by other means.

Prior to 1390 there are some similar images such as the [[Pray Codex]]. However, what is claimed by some to be the image of a shroud on the Pray Codex has crosses on one side, an interlocking step pyramid pattern on the other, and no image of Jesus. Critics point out that it may not be a shroud at all, but rather a rectangular tombstone, as seen on other sacred images.<ref>G.M.Rinaldi, \"Il Codice Pray\", http://sindone.weebly.com/pray.html</ref>  The text of the codex also fails to mention a miraculous image on the codex shroud.\n\nThe first possible historical record dates from 1353 or 1357.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" /><ref>{{Cite news |date=31 January 2005 |title=Turin shroud 'older than thought' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4210369.stm |work=BBC News}}</ref> and the first certain record (in [[Lirey]], [[France]]) in 1390 when Bishop Pierre d'Arcis wrote a [[memorandum]] to [[Antipope Clement VII|Pope Clement VII]] (Avignon Obedience), stating that the shroud was a forgery and that the artist had confessed.<ref name=\"Poulle 2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Poulle |first1=Emmanuel |authorlink=Emmanuel Poulle |title=Les sources de l'histoire du linceul de Turin.

In 1453 Margaret de Charny deeded the Shroud to the [[House of Savoy]]. In 1578 the shroud was transferred to Turin. Since the 17th century the shroud has been displayed (e.g. in the chapel built for that purpose by [[Guarino Guarini]]<ref>John Beldon Scott, ''Architecture for the shroud: relic and ritual in Turin'', University of Chicago Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-226-74316-0}}, p. xxi</ref>) and in the 19th century it was first photographed during a public exhibition.\n\nIn 1532, the shroud suffered damage from a fire in a chapel of [[Chamb\u00e9ry]], capital of the [[Savoy]] region, where it was stored. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. [[Poor Clare Nuns]] attempted to repair this damage with patches. In 1578 [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]] ordered the cloth to be brought from Chamb\u00e9ry to Turin and it has remained at Turin ever since.<ref>See House of Savoy historian Filiberto Pingone in Filiberto Pingone, ''La Sindone dei Vangeli (Sindon Evangelica).

The authorization was granted and the first medal with the image was offered to [[Pope Pius XII]] who approved the medal. The image was then used on what became known as the [[Holy Face Medal]] worn by many Catholics, initially as a means of protection during World War II. In 1958 Pope Pius XII approved of the image in association with the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, and declared its [[Feast of the Holy Winding Sheet of Christ|feast]] to be celebrated every year the day before [[Ash Wednesday]].<ref>Maria Rigamonti, ''Mother Maria Pierina'', Cenacle Publishing, 1999</ref><ref>Joan Carroll Cruz, \"Saintly Men of Modern Times\", ''Our Sunday Visitor'', 2003, {{ISBN|1-931709-77-7}}</ref> Following the approval by Pope Pius XII, Catholic devotions to the Holy Face of Jesus have been almost exclusively associated with the image on the shroud.\n\nIn 1983 the Shroud was given to the Holy See by the [[House of Savoy]].<ref name=\"Michael Freze 1993, p. 57\">Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing, {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}, p. 57</ref> However, as with all relics of this kind, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] made no pronouncements on its authenticity.

A variety of scientific theories regarding the shroud have since been proposed, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis.

In 1902 [[Yves Delage]], a French professor of [[comparative anatomy]], published the first study on the subject.<ref name=\"Delage, Yves 1902\" /> Delage declared the image anatomically flawless and argued that the features of [[rigor mortis]], wounds, and blood flows were evidence that the image was formed by direct or indirect contact with a corpse. William Meacham mentions several other medical studies between 1936 and 1981 that agree with Delage.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" /> These were all indirect studies without access to the shroud itself.\n\nThe first direct examination of the shroud by a scientific team was undertaken in 1969\u20131973 in order to advise on preservation of the shroud and determine specific testing methods. This led to the appointment of an 11-member Turin Commission to advise on the preservation of the relic and on specific testing. Five of the commission members were scientists, and preliminary studies of samples of the fabric were conducted in 1973.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" />\n\nIn 1976 physicist John P. Jackson, thermodynamicist Eric Jumper and photographer William Mottern used [[image analysis]] technologies developed in aerospace science for analyzing the images of the Shroud. In 1977 these three scientists and over thirty others formed the [[Shroud of Turin Research Project]]. In 1978 this group, often called STURP, was given direct access to the Shroud.\n\nAlso in 1978, independently from the STURP research, Giovanni Tamburelli obtained at [[CSELT]] a 3D-elaboration from the Shroud with higher resolution than Jumper and Mottern.

In fact, Jesus' hands and face are depicted with great detail, while his buttocks and his navel are faintly outlined or invisible, a discrepancy explained with the artist's consideration of modesty. Also, Jesus' right arm and hand are abnormally elongated, allowing him to modestly cover his genital area, which is physically impossible for an ordinary dead body lying supine. No wrinkles or other irregularities distort the image, which is improbable if the cloth had covered the irregular form of a body. For comparison, see [[oshiguma]]; the making of face-prints as an artform, in Japan.

To demonstrate this, he successfully produced photographic images similar to the shroud using only techniques and materials available at the time the shroud was supposedly made. He described his results in his PhD thesis,<ref>Allen, Nicholas P. L.

They first did a carbon-dust drawing of a Jesus-like face (using collagen dust) on a newsprint made from wood pulp (which is similar to 13th- and 14th-century paper). They next placed the drawing on a table and covered it with a piece of linen. They then pressed the linen against the newsprint by firmly rubbing with the flat side of a wooden spoon. By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three-dimensional image and no sign of brush strokes.<ref>Craig, Emily A, Bresee, Randal R, \"Image Formation and the Shroud of Turin\", ''Journal of Imaging Science and Technology'', Volume 34, Number 1, 1994</ref> However, according to Fanti and Moroni, this does not reproduce many special features of the Shroud at microscopic level.<ref name=Fanti2002/>\n\n====Bas-relief====\nIn 1978, [[Joe Nickell]] noted that the Shroud image had a three-dimensional quality and thought its creation may have involved a sculpture of some type. He advanced the hypothesis that a medieval rubbing technique was used to explain the image, and set out to demonstrate this. He noted that while wrapping a cloth around a sculpture with normal contours would result in a distorted image, Nickell believed that wrapping a cloth over a [[bas-relief]] might result in an image like the one seen on the shroud, as it would eliminate wraparound distortions. For his demonstration, Nickell wrapped a wet cloth around a bas-relief sculpture and allowed it to dry. He then applied powdered pigment rather than wet paint (to prevent it soaking into the threads). The pigment was applied with a dauber, similar to making a rubbing from a gravestone. The result was an image with dark regions and light regions convincingly arranged. In a photo essay in ''[[Popular Photography]]'' magazine, Nickell demonstrated this technique step-by-step.<ref name = JNInquest/><ref name =PopPhoto>{{cite journal |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe |title=The Turin Shroud: Fake? Fact?

(McCrone had identified the blood as red ochre and [[vermilion]] tempers paint.)<ref name = JNInquest/>}} Other researchers later replicated this process. \n\nIn 2005, researcher Jacques di Costanzo constructed a bas-relief of a Jesus-like face and draped wet linen over it.

Giulio Fanti, a scientist at the [[University of Padua]], wrote an article on this subject with colleagues in 2005 that envisages electrostatic [[corona discharge]] as the probable mechanism to produce the images of the body in the Shroud.<ref>G. Fanti, F. Lattarulo, O.

As with the front picture, it is entirely superficial, with coloration limited to the carbohydrate layer. The images correspond to, and are in registration with, those on the other side of the cloth. No image is detectable in the reverse side of the dorsal view of the body.\n\nRaymond Rogers criticized the theory, saying: \"It is clear that a corona discharge (plasma) in air will cause easily observable changes in a linen sample. No such effects can be observed in image fibers from the Shroud of Turin.

They demonstrated that the photochemical reactions caused by exposing linen to [[ultraviolet]] light could reproduce the main characteristics of the Shroud image, such as the shallowness of the coloration and the gradient of the color, which are not reproducible by other means. When subsequently illuminated with a UV lamp, the irradiated linen fabrics behaved like the linen of the Shroud. They also determined that UV radiation changes the crystalline structure of cellulose in a similar manner as aging and long-duration background radiation.<ref>{{cite web | first1=Paolo|last1=Di Lazzaro|first2=Daniele|last2=Murra|first3=Antonino|last3=Santoni|first4=Enrico|last4=Nichelatti|url=http://www.enea.it/it/produzione-scientifica/EAI/anno-2012/knowledge-diagnostics-and-preservation-of-cultural-heritage/the-conservation-of-the-shroud-of-turin-optical-studies |title=The Conservation of the Shroud of Turin: Optical Studies |accessdate=10 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416225452/http://www.enea.it/it/produzione-scientifica/EAI/anno-2012/knowledge-diagnostics-and-preservation-of-cultural-heritage/the-conservation-of-the-shroud-of-turin-optical-studies |archivedate=16 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=COLORAZIONE SIMIL\u2013SINDONICA DI TESSUTI DI LINO TRAMITE RADIAZIONE NEL LONTANO ULTRAVIOLETTO |issn=0393-3016 |url=http://opac.bologna.enea.it:8991/RT/2011/2011_14_ENEA.pdf}}</ref>\n\nPaolo Di Lazzaro, the lead researcher, indicated in an e-mail interview that \"...&nbsp;it appears unlikely a forger may have done this image with technologies available in the Middle Ages or earlier\", but their study does not mean the Shroud image was created by the flash of a miraculous resurrection, contrary to how the story was presented in the media, especially on the Web.<ref name=\"lazzaro\">{{cite web |url=http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/12/22/9636065-was-holy-shroud-created-in-a-flash-italian-researchers-resurrect-claim |title=Was Holy Shroud created in a flash?

It is commonly used to make the wearer's eyes stand out or look more attractive.\n\nEye shadow can add depth and dimension to one's eyes, complement one's eye color, make one's eyes appear larger, or simply draw attention to the eyes. Eye shadow comes in many different colors and textures. It is usually made from a [[Powder (substance)|powder]] and [[mica]], but can also be found in [[liquid]], [[pencil]], cream or mousse form. Just like other trends, eyeshadow looks also have trends. \n \nCivilizations across the world use eye shadow predominantly on females but also occasionally on males. In Western society, it is seen as a feminine cosmetic, even when used by men. In [[Gothic fashion]], black or similarly dark-colored eye shadow and other types of eye makeup are popular among both sexes. In India, eye liner, called Kohl, played a prominent role in various dance forms and ceremonies such as weddings.\n\nMany people use eye shadow simply to improve their appearance, but it is also commonly used in theatre and other plays, to create a memorable look, with bright, bold colors. Depending on skin tone and experience, the effect of eye shadow usually brings out glamour and gains attention. The use of eye shadow attempts to replicate the natural eye shadow that some women exhibit due to a natural contrasting pigmentation on their eyelids. Natural eye shadow can range anywhere from a glossy shine to one's eyelids, to a pinkish tone, or even a silver look.\n\n==Use==\n[[File:A woman wearing Eye Shadow.jpg|thumb|right|Eyes with heavy gold eye shadow]]\n[[File:Eyeshadow.webm|thumb|Video demonstrating application of eye shadow.]]\nEye shadow can be applied in a wide variety of ways depending upon the desired look and formulation. Typically application is done using fingers or brushes. The most important aspect of applying eye shadow, and makeup in general, is blending well. However, you must not forget to include a primer to limit the chances of creases in your eye shadow later.\n \nTo remove eye shadow, a commercial eye makeup remover can be utilized, though a rich face wash will usually remove all traces of color. Generally it is easy to remove, and simple water and soap can be used. Eye shadow, eyeliner, and mascara may also be removed using [[baby oil]]. There are also makeup wipes that can be used.\n\n==History==\nCosmetics have been used for as long as there have been people to use them. Face painting is mentioned in the Old Testament ([[Book of Ezekiel]] 23:40), and eye shadow was used in Egyptian burials dating back to 10,000 BC. The history of cosmetics traverse from at least 7,000 years and is common in mostly every society. Over the years many women have used burnt matches to intensify their eye makeup. Many women would often dust rice powder to hide any imperfections or freckles they had on their face. Eyeshadow or eye paint was very popular during the victorian era, less was more. The less eyeshadow you wore, the more respected you were. The word \"cosmetae\" was first used to describe Roman slaves whose duty was to bathe men and women in perfume.\n\n==Modern time==\nEye Shadow has gone through lots of different phases, for example during the 1920s where the smoky eyes were in trend, and the 1930s was when people started adding lots of colors to their eyeshadow looks.\n\n===Egypt===\n[[File:Nefertiti 30-01-2006.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Nefertiti]] bust with eye shadow applied]]\nAs early as 10,000 BC, men and women used scented oils and ointments to clean and soften their skin and mask body odor. Dyes and paints were used to color the skin, body and hair. The birth of eyeshadow can be brought up 12000 years ago to ancient Egypt, also the same goes for Eyeliner. They [[rouge (cosmetics)|rouge]]d their lips and cheeks, stained their nails with [[henna]], and lined their eyes and eyebrows heavily with [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]]. Kohl was a dark-colored powder made of crushed [[antimony]], burnt [[almond]]s, [[lead]], [[oxidize]]d [[copper]], [[ochre]], ash, [[malachite]], and [[chrysocolla]] (a blue-green copper ore) or any combination thereof.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smith.edu/hsc/museum/ancient_inventions/hsc01b.htm|title=Smith College Museum of Ancient Inventions: Cosmetics and Perfumes|publisher=}}</ref> \nIt was applied with a small stick. The upper and lower eyelids were painted in a line that extended to the sides of the face for an almond effect. In addition to reducing sun glare, it was believed that kohl eyeliner could restore good eyesight and reduce eye infection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courses.dsu.edu/ed370/crispage.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030529074319/http://www.courses.dsu.edu/ed370/crispage.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-05-29 |title=Ancient Egyptian Thematic |date= |accessdate=2019-06-03}}</ref> Kohl was kept in a small, flat-bottomed pot with a wide, tiny rim and a flat, disk-shaped lid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clpgh.org/cmnh/tours/egypt/dailylife.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19981203120352/http://www.clpgh.org/cmnh/tours/egypt/dailylife.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=1998-12-03 |title=http://www.clpgh.org/cmnh/tours/egypt/dailylife.html |date= |accessdate=2019-06-03}}</ref>\n\nAccording to images of the time, the use of makeup was not limited to women. Highly polished silver and copper mirrors aided the application of makeup.\n\n===Greece===\nIn Greece, precious oils, perfumes, cosmetic powders, eye shadows, skin glosses, paints, beauty unguents, and hair dyes were in universal use. Export and sale of these items formed an important part of [[Ancient Mediterranean trade|trade around the Mediterranean]]. During the 7th and 8th centuries BC, [[Corinth]]ian, [[Rhodes|Rhodian]] and East Greek traders dominated markets in perfume flasks and cosmetic containers. The containers included [[aryballoi]], [[alabastra]], [[pyxides]] and other small specialized shapes.\n\n===Rome===\nMen and women in the Near East painted their faces with kohl just like the Egyptians did. This was to protect them from the \u2018[[evil eye]].\u2019 After the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|defeat of the Greeks by the Romans]], the Romans adapted the Egyptian custom, albeit with different ends. To the Romans, applying eye shadow became a matter of fashion and esthetics.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Other cosmetics took on a medicinal application in Rome. Plagues were so rampant throughout Rome that aromatic gums and resins were burned to repel demons and bad spirits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinelodge.net/webdoc26.htm|title=Unknown|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Ingredients==\nCommon ingredients in eye shadows consist of mica, which is a mineral that is used as a bulk of the powder, and makes most of the eyeshadow and also absorbs the moisture and makes the eyeshadow opaque in color. Zinc stearate, which is an ingredient that adds color and can be used to increase the thickness of the eyeshadow itself. Mica, is an ingredient that is added to give the eyeshadow shine and luster. [[sericite]], [[magnesium stearate]], colorants, and preservatives. Fillers in eye shadows are primarily talc. The liquid binders are typically a silicone and the dry binders are typically magnesium stearate. In order to make an eye shadow, there has to be a balance between the fillers, dry binders as well as liquid binders. \n\n===Types of eyeshadow===\nMany types of eyeshadows exist: powder eyeshadows (also called \"pigments\"), liquid eyeshadows, cream eyeshadows, and many more.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Eye liner]]\n===Types of Brushes===\nThere are different kind of Eyeshadow brushes, there are brushes for blending the eyeshadows, which is called a blending brush. Another brush is called the crease brush which is used to pack the eyeshadow on the crease of the eyelid and blend. Another eyeshadow brush that is used on the eyelids is an angular brush that is used for the inner tear duct of the eye to make the eyeshadow pop in eyes and is a very precise brush.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.museum.upenn.edu/greek_world/Trade_craft/Precious.html \"University of Pennsylvania #1], accessed on June 27, 2008.

Eye shadow comes in many different colors and textures. It is usually made from a [[Powder (substance)|powder]] and [[mica]], but can also be found in [[liquid]], [[pencil]], cream or mousse form. Just like other trends, eyeshadow looks also have trends. \n \nCivilizations across the world use eye shadow predominantly on females but also occasionally on males. In Western society, it is seen as a feminine cosmetic, even when used by men. In [[Gothic fashion]], black or similarly dark-colored eye shadow and other types of eye makeup are popular among both sexes. In India, eye liner, called Kohl, played a prominent role in various dance forms and ceremonies such as weddings.\n\nMany people use eye shadow simply to improve their appearance, but it is also commonly used in theatre and other plays, to create a memorable look, with bright, bold colors. Depending on skin tone and experience, the effect of eye shadow usually brings out glamour and gains attention. The use of eye shadow attempts to replicate the natural eye shadow that some women exhibit due to a natural contrasting pigmentation on their eyelids. Natural eye shadow can range anywhere from a glossy shine to one's eyelids, to a pinkish tone, or even a silver look.\n\n==Use==\n[[File:A woman wearing Eye Shadow.jpg|thumb|right|Eyes with heavy gold eye shadow]]\n[[File:Eyeshadow.webm|thumb|Video demonstrating application of eye shadow.]]\nEye shadow can be applied in a wide variety of ways depending upon the desired look and formulation. Typically application is done using fingers or brushes. The most important aspect of applying eye shadow, and makeup in general, is blending well. However, you must not forget to include a primer to limit the chances of creases in your eye shadow later.\n \nTo remove eye shadow, a commercial eye makeup remover can be utilized, though a rich face wash will usually remove all traces of color. Generally it is easy to remove, and simple water and soap can be used. Eye shadow, eyeliner, and mascara may also be removed using [[baby oil]]. There are also makeup wipes that can be used.\n\n==History==\nCosmetics have been used for as long as there have been people to use them. Face painting is mentioned in the Old Testament ([[Book of Ezekiel]] 23:40), and eye shadow was used in Egyptian burials dating back to 10,000 BC. The history of cosmetics traverse from at least 7,000 years and is common in mostly every society. Over the years many women have used burnt matches to intensify their eye makeup. Many women would often dust rice powder to hide any imperfections or freckles they had on their face. Eyeshadow or eye paint was very popular during the victorian era, less was more. The less eyeshadow you wore, the more respected you were. The word \"cosmetae\" was first used to describe Roman slaves whose duty was to bathe men and women in perfume.\n\n==Modern time==\nEye Shadow has gone through lots of different phases, for example during the 1920s where the smoky eyes were in trend, and the 1930s was when people started adding lots of colors to their eyeshadow looks.\n\n===Egypt===\n[[File:Nefertiti 30-01-2006.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Nefertiti]] bust with eye shadow applied]]\nAs early as 10,000 BC, men and women used scented oils and ointments to clean and soften their skin and mask body odor. Dyes and paints were used to color the skin, body and hair. The birth of eyeshadow can be brought up 12000 years ago to ancient Egypt, also the same goes for Eyeliner. They [[rouge (cosmetics)|rouge]]d their lips and cheeks, stained their nails with [[henna]], and lined their eyes and eyebrows heavily with [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]]. Kohl was a dark-colored powder made of crushed [[antimony]], burnt [[almond]]s, [[lead]], [[oxidize]]d [[copper]], [[ochre]], ash, [[malachite]], and [[chrysocolla]] (a blue-green copper ore) or any combination thereof.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smith.edu/hsc/museum/ancient_inventions/hsc01b.htm|title=Smith College Museum of Ancient Inventions: Cosmetics and Perfumes|publisher=}}</ref> \nIt was applied with a small stick. The upper and lower eyelids were painted in a line that extended to the sides of the face for an almond effect. In addition to reducing sun glare, it was believed that kohl eyeliner could restore good eyesight and reduce eye infection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courses.dsu.edu/ed370/crispage.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030529074319/http://www.courses.dsu.edu/ed370/crispage.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-05-29 |title=Ancient Egyptian Thematic |date= |accessdate=2019-06-03}}</ref> Kohl was kept in a small, flat-bottomed pot with a wide, tiny rim and a flat, disk-shaped lid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clpgh.org/cmnh/tours/egypt/dailylife.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19981203120352/http://www.clpgh.org/cmnh/tours/egypt/dailylife.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=1998-12-03 |title=http://www.clpgh.org/cmnh/tours/egypt/dailylife.html |date= |accessdate=2019-06-03}}</ref>\n\nAccording to images of the time, the use of makeup was not limited to women. Highly polished silver and copper mirrors aided the application of makeup.\n\n===Greece===\nIn Greece, precious oils, perfumes, cosmetic powders, eye shadows, skin glosses, paints, beauty unguents, and hair dyes were in universal use. Export and sale of these items formed an important part of [[Ancient Mediterranean trade|trade around the Mediterranean]]. During the 7th and 8th centuries BC, [[Corinth]]ian, [[Rhodes|Rhodian]] and East Greek traders dominated markets in perfume flasks and cosmetic containers. The containers included [[aryballoi]], [[alabastra]], [[pyxides]] and other small specialized shapes.\n\n===Rome===\nMen and women in the Near East painted their faces with kohl just like the Egyptians did. This was to protect them from the \u2018[[evil eye]].\u2019 After the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|defeat of the Greeks by the Romans]], the Romans adapted the Egyptian custom, albeit with different ends. To the Romans, applying eye shadow became a matter of fashion and esthetics.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Other cosmetics took on a medicinal application in Rome. Plagues were so rampant throughout Rome that aromatic gums and resins were burned to repel demons and bad spirits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinelodge.net/webdoc26.htm|title=Unknown|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Ingredients==\nCommon ingredients in eye shadows consist of mica, which is a mineral that is used as a bulk of the powder, and makes most of the eyeshadow and also absorbs the moisture and makes the eyeshadow opaque in color. Zinc stearate, which is an ingredient that adds color and can be used to increase the thickness of the eyeshadow itself. Mica, is an ingredient that is added to give the eyeshadow shine and luster. [[sericite]], [[magnesium stearate]], colorants, and preservatives. Fillers in eye shadows are primarily talc. The liquid binders are typically a silicone and the dry binders are typically magnesium stearate. In order to make an eye shadow, there has to be a balance between the fillers, dry binders as well as liquid binders. \n\n===Types of eyeshadow===\nMany types of eyeshadows exist: powder eyeshadows (also called \"pigments\"), liquid eyeshadows, cream eyeshadows, and many more.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Eye liner]]\n===Types of Brushes===\nThere are different kind of Eyeshadow brushes, there are brushes for blending the eyeshadows, which is called a blending brush. Another brush is called the crease brush which is used to pack the eyeshadow on the crease of the eyelid and blend. Another eyeshadow brush that is used on the eyelids is an angular brush that is used for the inner tear duct of the eye to make the eyeshadow pop in eyes and is a very precise brush.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.museum.upenn.edu/greek_world/Trade_craft/Precious.html \"University of Pennsylvania #1], accessed on June 27, 2008.

She is a [[cardiologist]] at the eponymous hospital, and [[widow]] of physician [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Alan Quartermaine]] ([[Stuart Damon]]). The role was originated by Patsy Rahn in 1976, who played the role until [[showrunner]]s replaced her with Charleson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2013/08/history-august-17.html|title=Today in Soap Opera History (August 17)|date=August 17, 2013|first=Roger|last=Newcomb|work=[[List of soap opera media outlets|We Love Soaps]]|publisher=[[Blogger (website)|Blogger]]|location=United States|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref> Charleson's tenure with the [[serial (radio and television)|serial]] is [[List of longest-serving soap opera actors#United States|one of the longest in American soap operas]].\n\n==Character and casting==\nMonica becomes [[Chief Physician|Chief of Staff]] at General Hospital following the death of her husband, [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Dr. Alan Quartermaine]]. Her specialty is [[cardiology]]. Her various affairs, primarily with fellow doctors [[Jeff Webber]] and his older brother [[Rick Webber]], and her quarrels with husband and their dysfunctional family were all major stories on the show throughout the late 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn her time on the show, Monica has battled [[breast cancer]], and dealt with outliving almost all of her children. Her two remaining children are Jason Morgan and Skye Quartermaine. She is the owner of the [[Quartermaine]] mansion, as she often reminds her family when they begin quarreling. She has been known to throw them out of her house.\n\nIn 2006, she only had rare appearances. New storylines developed in 2007 (an investigation into the murder of Rick Webber, the deaths of her husband and daughter [[Emily Quartermaine]]), and she is being featured more prominently.\n\nWith the returns of [[Denise Alexander]] ([[Lesley Webber]]), [[Genie Francis]] ([[Laura Spencer (General Hospital)|Laura Spencer]]), and [[Kin Shriner]] ([[Scott Baldwin]]), Monica remains the fourth oldest character on ''General Hospital''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/generalhospital/episodes/1976-77/1976.html|title=General Hospital 1976|date=January 1, 1976|work=[[ABC Daytime]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=[[New York City]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326104340/http://abc.go.com/daytime/generalhospital/episodes/1976-77/1976.html|archivedate=March 26, 2008|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hvROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cwIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6987%2C5357067|title=Frank Plans To Divorce Nancy; Mac Moves Back With Rachel|date=February 21, 1977|department=The Soaps|first=Lynda|last=Hirsch|work=[[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|Toledo Blade]]|publisher=[[Block Communications]]|location=[[Toledo, Ohio]]|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-03-10/features/9303190826_1_leslie-charleson-soap-gloria-monty|title=Seeing 'General Hospital' Through Good Times And Ill|date=March 10, 1993|first=Marla|last=Hart|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[tronc|tronc, inc.]]|location=[[Chicago]]|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}</ref> and Charleson is the show's most tenured performer.<ref name=\"Monica Biography\">{{cite web |url=http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/general-hospital/quartermaine-family/character-monica-quartermaine |title=Character Monica Quartermaine Biography |publisher=[[ABC Daytime]] |work=[[General Hospital]] |location=United States |accessdate=July 10, 2018|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919003854/http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/general-hospital/quartermaine-family/character-monica-quartermaine |archivedate=September 19, 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2013/08/history-august-17.html|title=Today in Soap Opera History (August 17)|date=August 17, 2013|first=Roger|last=Newcomb|work=[[List of soap opera media outlets|We Love Soaps]]|publisher=[[Blogger (website)|Blogger]]|location=United States|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn August 24, 2010, it was announced that Charleson was being demoted to recurring status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/gh/news/2010/0825-charleson.php|title=Leslie Charleson dropped to recurring status|website=[[SoapCentral]]|location=United States|publisher=Soap Central Live|accessdate=September 15, 2012|date=August 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Charleson off contract\">{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Fairman|title=Leslie Charleson taken off contract at GH!|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/leslie-charleson-taken-off-contract-at-gh/2010/08/24/|website=[[Michael Fairman TV]]|publisher=The Michael Fairman Company|location=United States|accessdate=September 15, 2012|date=August 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2011, newly appointed head writer [[Garin Wolf]] expressed his interest in having Charleson appear on a much more frequent basis.

However, Greg, Gail's husband took advantage of Monica and raped her. Gail remained unaware of this for many years but the two were able to reconcile once the truth came out. Monica was able to use her experience with Greg to help [[Laura Spencer (General Hospital)|Laura Spencer]] when she was raped.\n\nMonica later had an affair with David Langston and gave birth to a daughter, Dawn, whom she gave up for adoption.\n\nJust prior to her arrival on GH, Monica had been engaged to [[Rick Webber]]. However, he had broken up with her and flew off to [[Africa]] where he became caught up in a [[civil war]] and was presumed dead. Monica turned to [[Jeff Webber]], Rick's brother, for comfort and married him, not knowing that Rick was still alive.\n\n===1970s===\nMonica arrived in [[Port Charles, New York (fictional city)|Port Charles]] in 1976, having recently married [[Jeff Webber]]. [[Steve Hardy]], who had been recently appointed as Chief of Staff at [[Port Charles, New York (fictional city)#General Hospital|General Hospital]], invited the couple to take part in his ''Mr. and Mrs. Intern Programme'', believing that the couple had an idyllic marriage. However, the truth was that Monica had only married Jeff on the rebound. She was still deeply in love with Jeff's brother, Rick, who had been presumed dead in Africa. Thus, the marriage collapsed when Rick was revealed to be still alive and Monica cheated on Jeff with Rick, while Jeff cheated on Monica with [[Heather Grant]], with whom he had a son, [[Steven Webber]]. Jeff and Monica divorced in 1977.\n\nThroughout this time, Rick had grown close to [[Lesley Webber|Lesley Faulkner]] and planned to marry her. Monica was devastated, and tried to put a stop to it, blackmailing Lesley into turning down Rick's proposal. If Lesley didn't, Monica would tell the hospital board of Monica's affair with Rick, denying him the opportunity to become Chief of Cardiology at General Hospital. During the argument, a pregnant Lesley fell down the stairs and miscarried. Lesley was despondent, and called off her engagement to Rick, hoping to save Rick's career. Meanwhile, Monica and Rick talk about how important the promotion is to Rick, and Monica realizes she cannot go through with her threat, but doesn't tell Lesley as much. Monica's found out when Lesley's daughter Laura's tape recorder is found to have caught Monica's threats to Lesley. Lesley and Rick are married in October 1977.\n\nRick and Monica's relationship becomes embittered, and Monica nearly loses her job, though Lesley sets aside her personal feelings and vouches for Monica's talents as a doctor to Steve, saving her job. Monica claims to be moving on, but she and Rick are forced to work together with [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Dr. Alan Quartermaine]] on plans for a new wing at the hospital. Monica makes a last-ditch effort to bed Rick while trapped in a remote ranger station overnight during a storm while working on the project, but is turned down. While Monica continues to antagonize Lesley and Rick, she soon begins a relationship with Alan, though she's still very much attracted to Rick.\n\nMonica had doubts about her relationship with Alan, but these were soon overshadowed when Monica's foster mother Gail Adamson discovered that Monica had slept with Gail's late husband Greg. Gail did not believe Monica's explanation that Greg had forced her into the affair and cut ties with Monica. Monica turned to Alan for support and agreed to marry him. Eventually Gail and Monica made amends. She was thrilled when Gail found happiness by finally agreeing to marry [[Lee Baldwin]] after months of putting him off. Monica became a close confidante to Laura who found that Monica treated her like an adult while her mother continuously treated her like a child.\n\nAfter their 1978 wedding, Alan bought a mansion for Monica as a wedding present, and his family ended up re-settling in Port Charles as well. Monica adored Alan's parents, Edward (who ran the family empire, ELQ) and Lila, but his sister, Tracy, felt Monica was beneath them and caused problems every chance she got. Monica continued to be a confidante to Lesley's young daughter, Laura, and when nurse Bobbie Spencer began to harass Laura and blamed her for attacking her in the hospital book store, Monica took Laura's side, realizing the extent of her own harassment towards Lesley whom she made an effort to become friends with. However, within a year of her second marriage, Monica once again fell into Rick's arms and the two had a one-night stand. Monica was pregnant and didn't know who the father was. Tracy, who had made efforts to get to know her sister-in-law whom she respected as a physician, suspected the truth and plotted to have the unborn child declared illegitimate so her son Ned would inherit the Quartermaine estate. For many months, Monica was bedridden, and innocent student nurse [[Amy Vining]] her only companion. Monica was unaware that the gossipy Amy was totally enamored of the handsome Alan who used her as a spy to keep an eye on his wife. Monica gave birth to a son, [[A. J. Quartermaine|A.J.]] during the middle of a winter storm with only Gail and Lesley present and screamed out that Rick was the father.\n\n===1980s===\nRick and Lesley divorced so Rick and Monica could be together. Alan was enraged by this turn of events and made several attempts to kill Rick and Monica, but was thwarted at every attempt. While both Scotty and Lee found Monica's actions repulsive, their wives Laura and Gail were more compassionate even though Laura was heartsick at seeing Lesley and her adoptive father separated. Monica managed to trick Alan into admitting on tape that he had tried to kill her and Rick and moved into Tracy's old apartment as she prepared to file for an uncontested divorce. Eventually, both Monica and Alan realized that A.J. was indeed Alan's son and not Rick's. Monica attempted to hide this fact from Rick, but Alan eventually exposed the truth that there were rare circumstances when two parents with type O blood could conceive a type B blood baby. Rick, disgusted with Monica's continued manipulations, left her and focused on the formation of the waterfront clinic. A confrontation with Lesley over the revelation of Alan Jr.'s paternity ended up with Monica viciously maligning Lesley's lack of passion and Lesley's surprising response of a hard slap across Monica's face. The next day when Monica went to get her final divorce decree, she discovered that Alan had contested it, and when she confronted him, he threatened her with the loss of her son for her actions, forcing her to return to him even though she couldn't stand the sight of him. Eventually, because of issues concerning Laura on the run, Rick went back to Lesley, having Monica removed as his assistant in surgery, although he later relented, citing their shared excellence in the operating room. Monica felt that she had no other alternative but to stay with Alan, biding her time to find a way out. The only good thing that happened for Monica around this time was Tracy's departure after discovering that her husband [[Mitch Williams]] was having an affair with sexy waitress [[Susan Moore (General Hospital)|Susan Moore]] who ended up being manager of the Campus Disco which Alan bought as a side investment after owner [[Frank Smith (General Hospital)|Frank Smith]] was sent to prison for mob activities.\n\nFollowing their 'reconciliation', Monica refused to sleep with Alan and insisted on separate rooms. Despite attempts by both to be civil to each other, Alan grew frustrated and in 1981, he embarked on an affair with Susan, who became pregnant and would give birth to Alan's son, [[Jason Morgan (General Hospital)|Jason]] while out of town. Alan moved Susan into a cottage but continued to live in the Quartermaine mansion until the tensions became so great between him and Monica that he moved in with Susan. The only calm moments between Alan and Monica was their shared desire to prove that Alan's cousin, [[Alexandria Quartermaine]] was utilizing the family fortune in ways that would not keep their holdings strong. Monica was greatly amused when Alexandria's will left all of her ELQ stock to Lila, putting her in control and keeping Edward from making deals he felt important to gain more money and power. Monica hired private investigator Larry Corrigan ([[Frank Ashmore]]) to get proof of Alan's affair with Susan, and he took a job at the campus disco, managing it after Susan went to New York to have her baby. Between Larry and Cathy Summers (A.J.'s nanny), she got the evidence she needed and used it to make Alan's life a living hell. In spite of public scenes at the hospital which caused both of them to be reprimanded by Steve Hardy, Monica would continue to be seen with Alan at social functions, including Luke and Laura's wedding, even though she was preparing to file for divorce and sell the Quartermaine house, a move that Alan put a stop to. But the chemistry between Alan and Susan soon waned and he found himself becoming bored with her which lead to him unable to make love. Arguing with Monica over Susan and Jason led to them admitting their passion for one another, and Alan broke off with Susan who sued him for palimony and major child support. The final straw for Alan came when she turned into a drunk and married Scott Baldwin after being in a horrendous car accident. In 1983, Susan was murdered by Lila's first husband, Crane Tolliver (discovered after all of the Quartermaines, including Monica, were questioned as suspects), and Susan's aunt Alice Grant took Jason in. After Alice died of an embolism a few months later, Monica and Alan fought her daughter, Heather (the same Heather whom Jeff had cheated on Monica with seven years earlier) for custody of the baby. Monica was not pleased at having her husband's illegitimate offspring in the house at first, but eventually grew to love Jason as if he were her own. She later legally adopted him as well.\n\nMonica was saddened by the sudden death in a car accident of her old rival Lesley Webber whom she had somewhat made peace with. Only a few months before, the Quartermaines had shared in the Webber family's joy over Laura Spencer's return from the dead. While determined to make her marriage to Alan work this time around, Monica did become a source of comfort for her ex-lover, Rick, and even wished him much happiness when he married [[Ginny Blake]], the natural mother of Rick and Lesley's adopted son, Mikey. The Quartermaines had more than their share of tensions on their hand when Edward's illegitimate son Jimmy Lee Holt showed up and ended up with proof that Edward and Lila's marriage had not been legal. The following year, Jimmy Lee's mother, Beatrice LaSeur, showed up and proceeded to attempt to blackmail the family, leading to her apparent murder in which Monica was once again a suspect. But she had accidentally drank Lila's heart medication which caused her death. One of the suspects in Beatrice's death was spa owner [[Lorena Sharpe]] who turned out to be Monica's long-lost cousin. In 1986, Monica had an affair with [[Sean Donely]], and kicked all the [[Quartermaine family|Quartermaine]]s out of the mansion. Alan concocted a bizarre scheme to frame Sean for his 'murder' and even went missing for several months as part of the plan. Eventually, Sean left Monica for [[Tiffany Hill]], and Monica reluctantly reconciled with Alan and let the Quartermaines back into the mansion.\n\nMonica went away to a spa resort and ended up sleeping with one of the workers there, a young man named Ward. To Monica's surprise, Ward turned out to be [[List of past General Hospital characters#Ned Ashton|Ned Ashton]], the son of her sister-in-law, [[Tracy Quartermaine]] (who came back after a decade's absence) and thus, Alan's nephew. The two agreed to keep the affair a secret, but soon another secret of Monica's would come out. Monica's secret daughter, [[Dawn Winthrop]] turned up and began dating Ned. These two secrets proved at last to be the deathblow to Monica and Alan's marriage and the two divorced. Alan later married [[Lucy Coe]] in 1990. During this time, the family believed that Edward had been killed in a helicopter crash and fought brutally over his estate.\n\n===1990s===\nDawn was later murdered and Monica was devastated by her death. After Alan's marriage to Lucy also proved a disaster, Monica and Alan were drawn back together by their son A.J's rebellious behavior. In 1991, the two remarried and the next three years of their marriage were relatively calm, although the return of David Langton (Dawn's father), A.J.'s relationship with David's daughter Nikki and Alan's friendship with Rhonda Wexler did give the couple some cause for concern. It was during this time that Edward was found alive and returned to Port Charles to help the Quartermaine's take on the cartel who had tried to take over ELQ. Alan and Monica also welcomed Lee and Gail Baldwin back to Port Charles, getting Gail to provide some therapy for the problematic A.J. Monica supported Alan fully when he confessed to her that he had discovered that Ray Conway, Rhonda's boyfriend, had sexually molested Karen, and had pushed him after finding Ray beating up Rhonda, causing Ray to hit his head and die.\n\nMonica's life was changed forever when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1994. Monica became despondent and began pushing Alan away, though Alan fought hard to give Monica the support she needed. During this time, Monica befriended [[Paige Bowen]], a fellow cancer patient. Monica was devastated when Paige died, but ended up adopting Paige's daughter, [[Emily Quartermaine|Emily]]. Finally, Monica went into remission, but she and Alan were drifting further and further apart.\n\nBy 1995, A.J.'s alcoholism, which had been developing for several years, culminated in family tragedy when he and Jason were in a serious car accident. A.J. escaped relatively unhurt, but Jason was left with amnesia and brain damage. The family's attempts to make Jason remember alienated him from the family and he eventually rejected all of them including Monica in favor of working for local mob boss, [[Sonny Corinthos]]. As a result of all the tragedy in her life, Monica separated from Alan and longed to make herself feel better. Monica embarked on an affair with Dr. [[Pierce Dorman]], which predictably ended in disaster when Dorman made false allegations of sexual harassment against Monica. In court, Dorman's lawyers brought up Monica's past indiscretions, including her affair with Ned and ended up winning the case. Monica was fired from General Hospital as a result. Monica also had to deal with both A.J.'s alcoholism and Emily's drug addiction. Monica snapped and kidnapped Dorman, and threatened to give him a lobotomy. Only Jason's intervention stopped her from doing so. Eventually though, Monica was vindicated when Dorman was murdered and revealed to have been a drug dealer. Monica and the rest of the Quartermaines were both shocked and delighted when it was revealed that the presumably deceased Lesley Webber was very much alive. When Monica went to visit her old rival, the mentally fragile Lesley calmly said she could never ever forget Monica. The two women would socialize at hospital events even though Lesley did not return to the medical profession, but on occasion, their pasts would create some comic tension.\n\nMore family drama ensued in 1998 when [[Carly Corinthos|Carly Roberts]] claimed that her son [[Michael Corinthos III|Michael]] was Jason's. Monica's father-in-law, [[Edward Quartermaine]], wanted to gain custody of Michael and thus Jason, who had been growing close to the Quartermaines was alienated from the family once again. Eventually, it was revealed that Jason was covering for Carly and that Michael was not Jason's son, but rather A.J.'s. During this time, Alan had become addicted to painkillers, which caused another brief estrangement between Alan and Monica.\n\n===2000s===\nAlan and Monica eventually reconciled and briefly considered trying for another baby. In 2001, they decided to renew their vows only for [[Skye Quartermaine|Skye Chandler]] to turn up and claim that she was Alan's daughter. While Monica and Skye clashed at first, they eventually established a cordial relationship and Monica even allowed Skye to stay at the mansion after Tracy revealed she wasn't Alan's daughter after all. Alan and Monica stayed stable for several years, even as drama occurred amongst their children. A.J. lost custody of Michael to Carly and her new husband Sonny Corinthos, while Emily was temporarily paralyzed in an accident and later diagnosed with breast cancer. When [[Rick Webber]] returned to town for Laura's remarriage to Luke, he re-kindled his old friendship with Monica which caused Alan to become jealous of them once again and brought back some bad memories for Lesley Webber who had never stopped loving him. When Rick was suddenly killed, Alan and Monica were both mentioned as suspects, and for a long time, everybody believed that Laura had killed him in self-defense. The real killer was eventually revealed to be Scotty Baldwin.\n\nIn 2005, A.J. faked his death as part of a complicated plot to frame his ex-wife, [[Courtney Matthews]], for murder and eventually kidnap his son Michael. Alan and Monica blamed each other for failing to show A.J. enough love and attention and once again a rift began in their marriage. When A.J. turned up alive and was subsequently murdered, Alan and Monica separated. Monica also believed that she had witnessed Michael kill A.J. and helped in the cover up, though eventually it was revealed that her grandson was not to blame. Monica and Alan eventually patched up their differences and decided to remain married.\n\nAs of 2006, Monica spends most of her time at the hospital, or being amused by the various dramas that have been occurring in her family. In February 2007, she was devastated by the death of her husband Alan, followed in November 2007 by the death of Emily after district attorney and Sonny's half-brother [[Ric Lansing]] tightened security at the Metro Court Hotel. Monica blamed Jason for Emily's death. Even though he was her only child left, she would not have anything to do with him, and turned to alcohol. Her drinking led to her being sued for medical malpractice by her sister-in-law [[Tracy Quartermaine Spencer|Tracy Quartermaine]] after a botched surgery that Monica performed on Tracy's husband [[Luke Spencer]]. Monica also drank while driving, and hit [[Sam McCall]] in a hit and run. She continued to blame Jason both for her grief and her drinking problem because his job had cost her Alan, A.J. and Emily.\n\nMonica's drinking landed her in a horrific car accident; Jason insisted that she seek treatment otherwise he would report her to the police. Monica chose to get help and report herself. Monica would reconcile with Jason, apologize for the way she had treated him and reassure him that regardless of his parentage, she thought of him aa her son and she loves him. Jason would promise help her in future, be a better son, and hire his lawyer [[Diane Miller]] (who bores a striking resemblance to Ric) to defend Monica. She pleaded guilty to Sam's hit and run and driving while under the influence. Though a deal was made to have Monica attend rehab and do six months of community service, the judge insists that Monica deserves a more severe punishment, stating that Monica's grief did not give her an excuse to endanger people's lives and that she should have sought help for her condition sooner. However, Nikolas and Sam's testimonies convinced the judge to accept Monica's plea bargain.\n\nMonica resumed her position as Chief of Staff at General Hospital after completing rehab. While assisting in a patient's operation, Monica, along with the rest of the operation room's surgical staff, was infected with an airborne toxin that was inside the patient. She was taken to the ICU at Mercy, but was quickly released. Monica immediately took to newcomer [[Rebecca Shaw (General Hospital)|Rebecca Shaw]], Emily's twin sister, and shared with Rebecca her own breast cancer struggle.\n\nMonica once again became a key player in the reconstruction efforts for General Hospital to re-open after the toxin outbreak. She later stepped down from her role as Chief of Staff, contacting former physician [[Steven Webber|Dr. Steven Webber]] to take over for her so that she could re-focus on her specialty of cardiology.\n\n===2010s===\nEarly in the decade, Monica was seen infrequently, often not present from Quartermaine family events because it is too painful for her after Alan's death. After [[Elizabeth Webber]]'s son, [[Jacob Spencer|Jake Webber]], died in a hit-and-run, Monica found out that he was actually Jason's son. She was heartbroken over Jake's death, and admonished both Jason and Elizabeth for denying her the right to know her grandson. She also yelled at Luke, the driver who accidentally hit Jake. After Jason is admitted to the hospital following a car accident, Monica finds out that he & Sam are engaged. She imagines a life where Jason never got in the car with A.J., and was still Jason Quartermaine. She's later glad to still have Jason as he is. When Jason eventually woke up, she helped him and Sam plan their wedding. She gave Alan's wedding ring to Sam, who in turn gave it to Jason on their wedding day. Monica eventually returns to her job as Chief of Staff at the hospital.\n\nMonica is thrilled when Jason and Sam have a son, [[Daniel Morgan (General Hospital)|Daniel Morgan]], and ask her to be part of her grandson's life. Sadly, Jason disappears, and is presumed dead shortly after, and Monica had to deal with losing another child. At the same time, A.J. returns, and it's revealed that Monica helped him fake his death and sneak out of the country to avoid the criminal charges. A.J. comes back, wanting to reconnect with his family, especially Michael. Monica supported him, despite others saying he was going to cause trouble. However, he did reconnect with Michael and, in turn, Monica. When A.J. was accused of murdering [[Connie Falconeri]] and lapsed back into alcoholism, Monica got fired as chief of staff trying to support A.J. She lost her son again when A.J. was murdered by Sonny. Monica was furious, but happy when Michael disowned Sonny and started to bond more with the Quartermaines because of Sonny being like [[List of General Hospital characters (1990s)#Cesar Faison|Cesar Faison]].\n\nMonica found out that Jake was actually alive, having been held captive by [[Helena Cassadine]], and got a chance to be a part of Jake's life. She also bonded with \"Jake Doe,\" an amnesiac patient who had a facial reconstruction surgery after an accident. It later turned out that \"Jake Doe\" was actually Jason, though he had no memories of his past. Monica promised not to make the same mistakes with Jason that she made before, and was able to reconnect with him. Meanwhile, Monica had to deal with the new chief of staff, [[Liesl Obrecht]], and her strict conduct rules. Tracy, though, helped Monica get back the job after Monica called in Dr. [[General Hospital characters (2016)#Hamilton Finn|Hamilton Finn]] to help an ailing Tracy. She fought to help Finn stay on staff, despite Liesl's objections. Jason, meanwhile, recovered his memories, and apologized to Monica for pushing her away for many years. He promised to make more of an effort to include her as his mother; Monica assured Jason that she loved him.\n\nMonica was targeted by the General Hospital serial killer, later revealed to be [[Paul Hornsby]] who is like [[Valentin Cassadine|Valentin]] and [[List of General Hospital characters (1980s)#Victor Cassadine|Victor Cassadine]]. She was attacked and left unconscious, but was saved by Nurse [[Sabrina Santiago]]. Unfortunately, Sabrina figured out Paul was the culprit, and he killed her to keep her silent. Monica survived, but she and Tracy were forced to shut down General Hospital to prevent anyone else from getting killed. When Paul was caught and sent to prison, she and Tracy both feverishly worked to get the hospital opened up again. They succeeded, but were facing financial trouble trying to keep the hospital open. Monica and the Quartermaines rallied together, and decided to buy out the hospital so that it wouldn't be sold to develop condominiums. With Finn's help, they succeeded in stopping the Jeromes in their tracks. Monica was there when Jason and Sam decided to name their newborn daughter [[Emily Morgan (General Hospital)|Emily]], in honor of Monica's daughter. She was thrilled by the tribute, and met her granddaughter after [[List of General Hospital characters (1980s)#Olivia St. John|Olivia Jerome]] was sent to a mental asylum when Judge Horace Sanchez found out Liv was unfit to stand trial.\n\nIn January 2019, Monica learned from Scotty that the widowed Gail Baldwin had died. Along with Lucy, Monica and Scotty shared memories of Gail whom Monica believed had help guide her through many situations.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{General Hospital}}\n{{General Hospital characters|present}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quartermaine, Monica}}\n[[Category:General Hospital characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional adoptees]]\n[[Category:Fictional physicians]]\n[[Category:Fictional socialites]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with cancer]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:General Hospital: Night Shift characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional female doctors]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox soap character\n| series = General Hospital\n| image1 = Leslie Charleson as Monica Quartermaine.png\n| caption1 = Leslie Charleson as Monica Quartermaine\n| portrayer = {{unbulleted list|Patsy Rahn (1976\u20131977)|[[Leslie Charleson]] (1977\u2013present)|[[Patty McCormack]] (2018)}}\n| creator = [[Eileen Pollock (writer)|Eileen Pollock]] and [[Robert Mason Pollock]]\n| introducer = Tom Donovan\n| years = 1976\u2013present\n| first = 1976\n| last = \n| classification = [[List of General Hospital cast members#Recurring cast|Present; recurring]]\n| books = ''[[Robin's Diary]]''<br>''[[The Secret Life of Damian Spinelli]]''\n| spinoffs = ''[[Port Charles]]'' <br> ''[[General Hospital: Night Shift]]''\n| alias = {{unbulleted list|Monica Bard|Monica Webber}}\n| occupation = ELQ shareholder (5%) <br> Chief of Staff at General Hospital <br> Chief [[cardiologist]] at General Hospital \n| residence = [[Port Charles (fictional city)|Port Charles]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n| family = [[Quartermaine family|Quartermaine]]\n| spouse= {{unbulleted list|[[List of General Hospital characters (1970s)#Jeff Webber|Jeff Webber]] (1976\u20131977)|[[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Alan Quartermaine]] (1978\u20131990, 1991\u20132007)}}\n| adoptivemother = [[List of General Hospital characters (1970s)#Gail Baldwin|Gail Adamson]] (foster)\n| sons = [[A.

She is a [[cardiologist]] at the eponymous hospital, and [[widow]] of physician [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Alan Quartermaine]] ([[Stuart Damon]]). The role was originated by Patsy Rahn in 1976, who played the role until [[showrunner]]s replaced her with Charleson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2013/08/history-august-17.html|title=Today in Soap Opera History (August 17)|date=August 17, 2013|first=Roger|last=Newcomb|work=[[List of soap opera media outlets|We Love Soaps]]|publisher=[[Blogger (website)|Blogger]]|location=United States|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref> Charleson's tenure with the [[serial (radio and television)|serial]] is [[List of longest-serving soap opera actors#United States|one of the longest in American soap operas]].\n\n==Character and casting==\nMonica becomes [[Chief Physician|Chief of Staff]] at General Hospital following the death of her husband, [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Dr. Alan Quartermaine]]. Her specialty is [[cardiology]]. Her various affairs, primarily with fellow doctors [[Jeff Webber]] and his older brother [[Rick Webber]], and her quarrels with husband and their dysfunctional family were all major stories on the show throughout the late 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn her time on the show, Monica has battled [[breast cancer]], and dealt with outliving almost all of her children. Her two remaining children are Jason Morgan and Skye Quartermaine. She is the owner of the [[Quartermaine]] mansion, as she often reminds her family when they begin quarreling. She has been known to throw them out of her house.\n\nIn 2006, she only had rare appearances. New storylines developed in 2007 (an investigation into the murder of [[Rick Webber]], the deaths of her husband and daughter [[Emily Quartermaine]]), and she is being featured more prominently.\n\nWith the returns of [[Denise Alexander]] ([[Lesley Webber]]), [[Genie Francis]] ([[Laura Spencer (General Hospital)|Laura Spencer]]), and [[Kin Shriner]] ([[Scott Baldwin]]), Monica remains the fourth oldest character on ''General Hospital''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/generalhospital/episodes/1976-77/1976.html|title=General Hospital 1976|date=January 1, 1976|work=[[ABC Daytime]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=[[New York City]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326104340/http://abc.go.com/daytime/generalhospital/episodes/1976-77/1976.html|archivedate=March 26, 2008|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hvROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cwIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6987%2C5357067|title=Frank Plans To Divorce Nancy; Mac Moves Back With Rachel|date=February 21, 1977|department=The Soaps|first=Lynda|last=Hirsch|work=[[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|Toledo Blade]]|publisher=[[Block Communications]]|location=[[Toledo, Ohio]]|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-03-10/features/9303190826_1_leslie-charleson-soap-gloria-monty|title=Seeing 'General Hospital' Through Good Times And Ill|date=March 10, 1993|first=Marla|last=Hart|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[tronc|tronc, inc.]]|location=[[Chicago]]|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}</ref> and Charleson is the show's most tenured performer.<ref name=\"Monica Biography\">{{cite web |url=http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/general-hospital/quartermaine-family/character-monica-quartermaine |title=Character Monica Quartermaine Biography |publisher=[[ABC Daytime]] |work=[[General Hospital]] |location=United States |accessdate=July 10, 2018|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919003854/http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/general-hospital/quartermaine-family/character-monica-quartermaine |archivedate=September 19, 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2013/08/history-august-17.html|title=Today in Soap Opera History (August 17)|date=August 17, 2013|first=Roger|last=Newcomb|work=[[List of soap opera media outlets|We Love Soaps]]|publisher=[[Blogger (website)|Blogger]]|location=United States|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn August 24, 2010, it was announced that Charleson was being demoted to recurring status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/gh/news/2010/0825-charleson.php|title=Leslie Charleson dropped to recurring status|website=[[SoapCentral]]|location=United States|publisher=Soap Central Live|accessdate=September 15, 2012|date=August 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Charleson off contract\">{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Fairman|title=Leslie Charleson taken off contract at GH!|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/leslie-charleson-taken-off-contract-at-gh/2010/08/24/|website=[[Michael Fairman TV]]|publisher=The Michael Fairman Company|location=United States|accessdate=September 15, 2012|date=August 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2011, newly appointed head writer [[Garin Wolf]] expressed his interest in having Charleson appear on a much more frequent basis.

However, Greg, Gail's husband took advantage of Monica and raped her. Gail remained unaware of this for many years but the two were able to reconcile once the truth came out. Monica was able to use her experience with Greg to help [[Laura Spencer (General Hospital)|Laura Spencer]] when she was raped.\n\nMonica later had an affair with David Langston and gave birth to a daughter, Dawn, whom she gave up for adoption.\n\nJust prior to her arrival on GH, Monica had been engaged to [[Rick Webber]]. However, he had broken up with her and flew off to [[Africa]] where he became caught up in a [[civil war]] and was presumed dead. Monica turned to [[Jeff Webber]], Rick's brother, for comfort and married him, not knowing that Rick was still alive.\n\n===1970s===\nMonica arrived in [[Port Charles, New York (fictional city)|Port Charles]] in 1976, having recently married [[Jeff Webber]]. [[Steve Hardy]], who had been recently appointed as Chief of Staff at [[Port Charles, New York (fictional city)#General Hospital|General Hospital]], invited the couple to take part in his ''Mr. and Mrs. Intern Programme'', believing that the couple had an idyllic marriage. However, the truth was that Monica had only married Jeff on the rebound. She was still deeply in love with Jeff's brother, Rick, who had been presumed dead in Africa. Thus, the marriage collapsed when Rick was revealed to be still alive and Monica cheated on Jeff with Rick, while Jeff cheated on Monica with [[Heather Grant]], with whom he had a son, [[Steven Webber]]. Jeff and Monica divorced in 1977.\n\nThroughout this time, Rick had grown close to [[Lesley Webber|Lesley Faulkner]] and planned to marry her. Monica was devastated, and tried to put a stop to it, blackmailing Lesley into turning down Rick's proposal. If Lesley didn't, Monica would tell the hospital board of Monica's affair with Rick, denying him the opportunity to become Chief of Cardiology at General Hospital. During the argument, a pregnant Lesley fell down the stairs and miscarried. Lesley was despondent, and called off her engagement to Rick, hoping to save Rick's career. Meanwhile, Monica and Rick talk about how important the promotion is to Rick, and Monica realizes she cannot go through with her threat, but doesn't tell Lesley as much. Monica's found out when Lesley's daughter Laura's tape recorder is found to have caught Monica's threats to Lesley. Lesley and Rick are married in October 1977.\n\nRick and Monica's relationship becomes embittered, and Monica nearly loses her job, though Lesley sets aside her personal feelings and vouches for Monica's talents as a doctor to Steve, saving her job. Monica claims to be moving on, but she and Rick are forced to work together with [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Dr. Alan Quartermaine]] on plans for a new wing at the hospital. Monica makes a last-ditch effort to bed Rick while trapped in a remote ranger station overnight during a storm while working on the project, but is turned down. While Monica continues to antagonize Lesley and Rick, she soon begins a relationship with Alan, though she's still very much attracted to Rick.\n\nMonica had doubts about her relationship with Alan, but these were soon overshadowed when Monica's foster mother Gail Adamson discovered that Monica had slept with Gail's late husband Greg. Gail did not believe Monica's explanation that Greg had forced her into the affair and cut ties with Monica. Monica turned to Alan for support and agreed to marry him. Eventually Gail and Monica made amends. She was thrilled when Gail found happiness by finally agreeing to marry [[Lee Baldwin]] after months of putting him off. Monica became a close confidante to Laura who found that Monica treated her like an adult while her mother continuously treated her like a child.\n\nAfter their 1978 wedding, Alan bought a mansion for Monica as a wedding present, and his family ended up re-settling in Port Charles as well. Monica adored Alan's parents, Edward (who ran the family empire, ELQ) and Lila, but his sister, Tracy, felt Monica was beneath them and caused problems every chance she got. Monica continued to be a confidante to Lesley's young daughter, Laura, and when nurse Bobbie Spencer began to harass Laura and blamed her for attacking her in the hospital book store, Monica took Laura's side, realizing the extent of her own harassment towards Lesley whom she made an effort to become friends with. However, within a year of her second marriage, Monica once again fell into Rick's arms and the two had a one-night stand. Monica was pregnant and didn't know who the father was. Tracy, who had made efforts to get to know her sister-in-law whom she respected as a physician, suspected the truth and plotted to have the unborn child declared illegitimate so her son Ned would inherit the Quartermaine estate. For many months, Monica was bedridden, and innocent student nurse [[Amy Vining]] her only companion. Monica was unaware that the gossipy Amy was totally enamored of the handsome Alan who used her as a spy to keep an eye on his wife. Monica gave birth to a son, [[A. J. Quartermaine|A.J.]] during the middle of a winter storm with only Gail and Lesley present and screamed out that Rick was the father.\n\n===1980s===\nRick and Lesley divorced so Rick and Monica could be together. Alan was enraged by this turn of events and made several attempts to kill Rick and Monica, but was thwarted at every attempt. While both Scotty and Lee found Monica's actions repulsive, their wives Laura and Gail were more compassionate even though Laura was heartsick at seeing Lesley and her adoptive father separated. Monica managed to trick Alan into admitting on tape that he had tried to kill her and Rick and moved into Tracy's old apartment as she prepared to file for an uncontested divorce. Eventually, both Monica and Alan realized that A.J. was indeed Alan's son and not Rick's. Monica attempted to hide this fact from Rick, but Alan eventually exposed the truth that there were rare circumstances when two parents with type O blood could conceive a type B blood baby. Rick, disgusted with Monica's continued manipulations, left her and focused on the formation of the waterfront clinic. A confrontation with Lesley over the revelation of Alan Jr.'s paternity ended up with Monica viciously maligning Lesley's lack of passion and Lesley's surprising response of a hard slap across Monica's face. The next day when Monica went to get her final divorce decree, she discovered that Alan had contested it, and when she confronted him, he threatened her with the loss of her son for her actions, forcing her to return to him even though she couldn't stand the sight of him. Eventually, because of issues concerning Laura on the run, Rick went back to Lesley, having Monica removed as his assistant in surgery, although he later relented, citing their shared excellence in the operating room. Monica felt that she had no other alternative but to stay with Alan, biding her time to find a way out. The only good thing that happened for Monica around this time was Tracy's departure after discovering that her husband [[Mitch Williams]] was having an affair with sexy waitress [[Susan Moore (General Hospital)|Susan Moore]] who ended up being manager of the Campus Disco which Alan bought as a side investment after owner [[Frank Smith (General Hospital)|Frank Smith]] was sent to prison for mob activities.\n\nFollowing their 'reconciliation', Monica refused to sleep with Alan and insisted on separate rooms. Despite attempts by both to be civil to each other, Alan grew frustrated and in 1981, he embarked on an affair with Susan, who became pregnant and would give birth to Alan's son, [[Jason Morgan (General Hospital)|Jason]] while out of town. Alan moved Susan into a cottage but continued to live in the Quartermaine mansion until the tensions became so great between him and Monica that he moved in with Susan. The only calm moments between Alan and Monica was their shared desire to prove that Alan's cousin, [[Alexandria Quartermaine]] was utilizing the family fortune in ways that would not keep their holdings strong. Monica was greatly amused when Alexandria's will left all of her ELQ stock to Lila, putting her in control and keeping Edward from making deals he felt important to gain more money and power. Monica hired private investigator Larry Corrigan ([[Frank Ashmore]]) to get proof of Alan's affair with Susan, and he took a job at the campus disco, managing it after Susan went to New York to have her baby. Between Larry and Cathy Summers (A.J.'s nanny), she got the evidence she needed and used it to make Alan's life a living hell. In spite of public scenes at the hospital which caused both of them to be reprimanded by Steve Hardy, Monica would continue to be seen with Alan at social functions, including Luke and Laura's wedding, even though she was preparing to file for divorce and sell the Quartermaine house, a move that Alan put a stop to. But the chemistry between Alan and Susan soon waned and he found himself becoming bored with her which lead to him unable to make love. Arguing with Monica over Susan and Jason led to them admitting their passion for one another, and Alan broke off with Susan who sued him for palimony and major child support. The final straw for Alan came when she turned into a drunk and married Scott Baldwin after being in a horrendous car accident. In 1983, Susan was murdered by Lila's first husband, Crane Tolliver (discovered after all of the Quartermaines, including Monica, were questioned as suspects), and Susan's aunt Alice Grant took Jason in. After Alice died of an embolism a few months later, Monica and Alan fought her daughter, Heather (the same Heather whom Jeff had cheated on Monica with seven years earlier) for custody of the baby. Monica was not pleased at having her husband's illegitimate offspring in the house at first, but eventually grew to love Jason as if he were her own. She later legally adopted him as well.\n\nMonica was saddened by the sudden death in a car accident of her old rival Lesley Webber whom she had somewhat made peace with. Only a few months before, the Quartermaines had shared in the Webber family's joy over Laura Spencer's return from the dead. While determined to make her marriage to Alan work this time around, Monica did become a source of comfort for her ex-lover, Rick, and even wished him much happiness when he married [[Ginny Blake]], the natural mother of Rick and Lesley's adopted son, Mikey. The Quartermaines had more than their share of tensions on their hand when Edward's illegitimate son Jimmy Lee Holt showed up and ended up with proof that Edward and Lila's marriage had not been legal. The following year, Jimmy Lee's mother, Beatrice LaSeur, showed up and proceeded to attempt to blackmail the family, leading to her apparent murder in which Monica was once again a suspect. But she had accidentally drank Lila's heart medication which caused her death. One of the suspects in Beatrice's death was spa owner [[Lorena Sharpe]] who turned out to be Monica's long-lost cousin. In 1986, Monica had an affair with [[Sean Donely]], and kicked all the [[Quartermaine family|Quartermaine]]s out of the mansion. Alan concocted a bizarre scheme to frame Sean for his 'murder' and even went missing for several months as part of the plan. Eventually, Sean left Monica for [[Tiffany Hill]], and Monica reluctantly reconciled with Alan and let the Quartermaines back into the mansion.\n\nMonica went away to a spa resort and ended up sleeping with one of the workers there, a young man named Ward. To Monica's surprise, Ward turned out to be [[List of past General Hospital characters#Ned Ashton|Ned Ashton]], the son of her sister-in-law, [[Tracy Quartermaine]] (who came back after a decade's absence) and thus, Alan's nephew. The two agreed to keep the affair a secret, but soon another secret of Monica's would come out. Monica's secret daughter, [[Dawn Winthrop]] turned up and began dating Ned. These two secrets proved at last to be the deathblow to Monica and Alan's marriage and the two divorced. Alan later married [[Lucy Coe]] in 1990. During this time, the family believed that Edward had been killed in a helicopter crash and fought brutally over his estate.\n\n===1990s===\nDawn was later murdered and Monica was devastated by her death. After Alan's marriage to Lucy also proved a disaster, Monica and Alan were drawn back together by their son A.J's rebellious behavior. In 1991, the two remarried and the next three years of their marriage were relatively calm, although the return of David Langton (Dawn's father), A.J.'s relationship with David's daughter Nikki and Alan's friendship with Rhonda Wexler did give the couple some cause for concern. It was during this time that Edward was found alive and returned to Port Charles to help the Quartermaine's take on the cartel who had tried to take over ELQ. Alan and Monica also welcomed Lee and Gail Baldwin back to Port Charles, getting Gail to provide some therapy for the problematic A.J. Monica supported Alan fully when he confessed to her that he had discovered that Ray Conway, Rhonda's boyfriend, had sexually molested Karen, and had pushed him after finding Ray beating up Rhonda, causing Ray to hit his head and die.\n\nMonica's life was changed forever when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1994. Monica became despondent and began pushing Alan away, though Alan fought hard to give Monica the support she needed. During this time, Monica befriended [[Paige Bowen]], a fellow cancer patient. Monica was devastated when Paige died, but ended up adopting Paige's daughter, [[Emily Quartermaine|Emily]]. Finally, Monica went into remission, but she and Alan were drifting further and further apart.\n\nBy 1995, A.J.'s alcoholism, which had been developing for several years, culminated in family tragedy when he and Jason were in a serious car accident. A.J. escaped relatively unhurt, but Jason was left with amnesia and brain damage. The family's attempts to make Jason remember alienated him from the family and he eventually rejected all of them including Monica in favor of working for local mob boss, [[Sonny Corinthos]]. As a result of all the tragedy in her life, Monica separated from Alan and longed to make herself feel better. Monica embarked on an affair with Dr. [[Pierce Dorman]], which predictably ended in disaster when Dorman made false allegations of sexual harassment against Monica. In court, Dorman's lawyers brought up Monica's past indiscretions, including her affair with Ned and ended up winning the case. Monica was fired from General Hospital as a result. Monica also had to deal with both A.J.'s alcoholism and Emily's drug addiction. Monica snapped and kidnapped Dorman, and threatened to give him a lobotomy. Only Jason's intervention stopped her from doing so. Eventually though, Monica was vindicated when Dorman was murdered and revealed to have been a drug dealer. Monica and the rest of the Quartermaines were both shocked and delighted when it was revealed that the presumably deceased Lesley Webber was very much alive. When Monica went to visit her old rival, the mentally fragile Lesley calmly said she could never ever forget Monica. The two women would socialize at hospital events even though Lesley did not return to the medical profession, but on occasion, their pasts would create some comic tension.\n\nMore family drama ensued in 1998 when [[Carly Corinthos|Carly Roberts]] claimed that her son [[Michael Corinthos III|Michael]] was Jason's. Monica's father-in-law, [[Edward Quartermaine]], wanted to gain custody of Michael and thus Jason, who had been growing close to the Quartermaines was alienated from the family once again. Eventually, it was revealed that Jason was covering for Carly and that Michael was not Jason's son, but rather A.J.'s. During this time, Alan had become addicted to painkillers, which caused another brief estrangement between Alan and Monica.\n\n===2000s===\nAlan and Monica eventually reconciled and briefly considered trying for another baby. In 2001, they decided to renew their vows only for [[Skye Quartermaine|Skye Chandler]] to turn up and claim that she was Alan's daughter. While Monica and Skye clashed at first, they eventually established a cordial relationship and Monica even allowed Skye to stay at the mansion after Tracy revealed she wasn't Alan's daughter after all. Alan and Monica stayed stable for several years, even as drama occurred amongst their children. A.J. lost custody of Michael to Carly and her new husband Sonny Corinthos, while Emily was temporarily paralyzed in an accident and later diagnosed with breast cancer. When [[Rick Webber]] returned to town for Laura's remarriage to Luke, he re-kindled his old friendship with Monica which caused Alan to become jealous of them once again and brought back some bad memories for Lesley Webber who had never stopped loving him. When Rick was suddenly killed, Alan and Monica were both mentioned as suspects, and for a long time, everybody believed that Laura had killed him in self-defense. The real killer was eventually revealed to be Scotty Baldwin.\n\nIn 2005, A.J. faked his death as part of a complicated plot to frame his ex-wife, [[Courtney Matthews]], for murder and eventually kidnap his son Michael. Alan and Monica blamed each other for failing to show A.J. enough love and attention and once again a rift began in their marriage. When A.J. turned up alive and was subsequently murdered, Alan and Monica separated. Monica also believed that she had witnessed Michael kill A.J. and helped in the cover up, though eventually it was revealed that her grandson was not to blame. Monica and Alan eventually patched up their differences and decided to remain married.\n\nAs of 2006, Monica spends most of her time at the hospital, or being amused by the various dramas that have been occurring in her family. In February 2007, she was devastated by the death of her husband Alan, followed in November 2007 by the death of Emily after district attorney and Sonny's half-brother [[Ric Lansing]] tightened security at the Metro Court Hotel. Monica blamed Jason for Emily's death. Even though he was her only child left, she would not have anything to do with him, and turned to alcohol. Her drinking led to her being sued for medical malpractice by her sister-in-law [[Tracy Quartermaine Spencer|Tracy Quartermaine]] after a botched surgery that Monica performed on Tracy's husband [[Luke Spencer]]. Monica also drank while driving, and hit [[Sam McCall]] in a hit and run. She continued to blame Jason both for her grief and her drinking problem because his job had cost her Alan, A.J. and Emily.\n\nMonica's drinking landed her in a horrific car accident; Jason insisted that she seek treatment otherwise he would report her to the police. Monica chose to get help and report herself. Monica would reconcile with Jason, apologize for the way she had treated him and reassure him that regardless of his parentage, she thought of him aa her son and she loves him. Jason would promise help her in future, be a better son, and hire his lawyer [[Diane Miller]] (who bores a striking resemblance to Ric) to defend Monica. She pleaded guilty to Sam's hit and run and driving while under the influence. Though a deal was made to have Monica attend rehab and do six months of community service, the judge insists that Monica deserves a more severe punishment, stating that Monica's grief did not give her an excuse to endanger people's lives and that she should have sought help for her condition sooner. However, Nikolas and Sam's testimonies convinced the judge to accept Monica's plea bargain.\n\nMonica resumed her position as Chief of Staff at General Hospital after completing rehab. While assisting in a patient's operation, Monica, along with the rest of the operation room's surgical staff, was infected with an airborne toxin that was inside the patient. She was taken to the ICU at Mercy, but was quickly released. Monica immediately took to newcomer [[Rebecca Shaw (General Hospital)|Rebecca Shaw]], Emily's twin sister, and shared with Rebecca her own breast cancer struggle.\n\nMonica once again became a key player in the reconstruction efforts for General Hospital to re-open after the toxin outbreak. She later stepped down from her role as Chief of Staff, contacting former physician [[Steven Webber|Dr. Steven Webber]] to take over for her so that she could re-focus on her specialty of cardiology.\n\n===2010s===\nEarly in the decade, Monica was seen infrequently, often not present from Quartermaine family events because it is too painful for her after Alan's death. After [[Elizabeth Webber]]'s son, [[Jacob Spencer|Jake Webber]], died in a hit-and-run, Monica found out that he was actually Jason's son. She was heartbroken over Jake's death, and admonished both Jason and Elizabeth for denying her the right to know her grandson. She also yelled at Luke, the driver who accidentally hit Jake. After Jason is admitted to the hospital following a car accident, Monica finds out that he & Sam are engaged. She imagines a life where Jason never got in the car with A.J., and was still Jason Quartermaine. She's later glad to still have Jason as he is. When Jason eventually woke up, she helped him and Sam plan their wedding. She gave Alan's wedding ring to Sam, who in turn gave it to Jason on their wedding day. Monica eventually returns to her job as Chief of Staff at the hospital.\n\nMonica is thrilled when Jason and Sam have a son, [[Daniel Morgan (General Hospital)|Daniel Morgan]], and ask her to be part of her grandson's life. Sadly, Jason disappears, and is presumed dead shortly after, and Monica had to deal with losing another child. At the same time, A.J. returns, and it's revealed that Monica helped him fake his death and sneak out of the country to avoid the criminal charges. A.J. comes back, wanting to reconnect with his family, especially Michael. Monica supported him, despite others saying he was going to cause trouble. However, he did reconnect with Michael and, in turn, Monica. When A.J. was accused of murdering [[Connie Falconeri]] and lapsed back into alcoholism, Monica got fired as chief of staff trying to support A.J. She lost her son again when A.J. was murdered by Sonny. Monica was furious, but happy when Michael disowned Sonny and started to bond more with the Quartermaines because of Sonny being like [[List of General Hospital characters (1990s)#Cesar Faison|Cesar Faison]].\n\nMonica found out that Jake was actually alive, having been held captive by [[Helena Cassadine]], and got a chance to be a part of Jake's life. She also bonded with \"Jake Doe,\" an amnesiac patient who had a facial reconstruction surgery after an accident. It later turned out that \"Jake Doe\" was actually Jason, though he had no memories of his past. Monica promised not to make the same mistakes with Jason that she made before, and was able to reconnect with him. Meanwhile, Monica had to deal with the new chief of staff, [[Liesl Obrecht]], and her strict conduct rules. Tracy, though, helped Monica get back the job after Monica called in Dr. [[General Hospital characters (2016)#Hamilton Finn|Hamilton Finn]] to help an ailing Tracy. She fought to help Finn stay on staff, despite Liesl's objections. Jason, meanwhile, recovered his memories, and apologized to Monica for pushing her away for many years. He promised to make more of an effort to include her as his mother; Monica assured Jason that she loved him.\n\nMonica was targeted by the General Hospital serial killer, later revealed to be [[Paul Hornsby]] who is like [[Valentin Cassadine|Valentin]] and [[List of General Hospital characters (1980s)#Victor Cassadine|Victor Cassadine]]. She was attacked and left unconscious, but was saved by Nurse [[Sabrina Santiago]]. Unfortunately, Sabrina figured out Paul was the culprit, and he killed her to keep her silent. Monica survived, but she and Tracy were forced to shut down General Hospital to prevent anyone else from getting killed. When Paul was caught and sent to prison, she and Tracy both feverishly worked to get the hospital opened up again. They succeeded, but were facing financial trouble trying to keep the hospital open. Monica and the Quartermaines rallied together, and decided to buy out the hospital so that it wouldn't be sold to develop condominiums. With Finn's help, they succeeded in stopping the Jeromes in their tracks. Monica was there when Jason and Sam decided to name their newborn daughter [[Emily Morgan (General Hospital)|Emily]], in honor of Monica's daughter. She was thrilled by the tribute, and met her granddaughter after [[List of General Hospital characters (1980s)#Olivia St. John|Olivia Jerome]] was sent to a mental asylum when Judge Horace Sanchez found out Liv was unfit to stand trial.\n\nIn January 2019, Monica learned from Scotty that the widowed Gail Baldwin had died. Along with Lucy, Monica and Scotty shared memories of Gail whom Monica believed had help guide her through many situations.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{General Hospital}}\n{{General Hospital characters|present}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quartermaine, Monica}}\n[[Category:General Hospital characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional adoptees]]\n[[Category:Fictional physicians]]\n[[Category:Fictional socialites]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with cancer]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:General Hospital: Night Shift characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional female doctors]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Canonblack", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCharacter and casting:Excessive linking to the same article", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Quartermaine"}

If the sequence of convergents never approaches a limit the continued fraction is divergent. It may diverge by oscillation (for example, the odd and even convergents may approach two different limits), or it may produce an infinite number of zero denominators ''B''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe story of continued fractions begins with the [[Euclidean algorithm]],<ref>300 BC [[Euclid]], ''Elements'' -  The Euclidean algorithm generates a continued fraction as a by-product.</ref> a procedure for finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of two natural numbers ''m'' and ''n''. That algorithm introduced the idea of dividing to extract a new remainder &ndash; and then dividing by the new remainder repeatedly.\n\nNearly two thousand years passed before [[Rafael Bombelli]]<ref>1579  [[Rafael Bombelli]], ''L'Algebra Opera''</ref> devised a [[Solving quadratic equations with continued fractions|technique for approximating the roots of quadratic equations]] with continued fractions. Now the pace of development quickened. Just 24 years later [[Pietro Cataldi]] introduced the first formal notation<ref>1613  [[Pietro Cataldi]], ''Trattato del modo brevissimo di trovar la radice quadra delli numeri''; roughly translated, ''A treatise on a quick way to find square roots of numbers''.</ref> for the generalized continued fraction. Cataldi represented a continued fraction as\n\n:<math>a_0.\\,</math> &<math> n_1 \\over d_1. </math> &<math> n_2 \\over d_2. </math> &<math> {n_3 \\over d_3},</math>\n\nwith the dots indicating where the next fraction goes, and each & representing a modern plus sign.\n\nLate in the seventeenth century [[John Wallis]]<ref>1695  [[John Wallis]], ''Opera Mathematica'', Latin for ''Mathematical Works''.</ref> introduced the term \"continued fraction\" into mathematical literature. New techniques for mathematical analysis  ([[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz's]] [[calculus]]) had recently come onto the scene, and a generation of Wallis' contemporaries put the new phrase to use.\n\nIn 1748 [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] published a theorem showing that a particular kind of continued fraction is equivalent to a certain very general [[infinite series]].<ref name=\"Euler\">1748  [[Leonhard Euler]], ''Introductio in analysin infinitorum'', Vol. I, Chapter 18.</ref> [[Euler's continued fraction formula]] is still the basis of many modern proofs of [[convergence problem|convergence of continued fractions]].\n\nIn 1761, [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] gave the first [[Proof that \u03c0 is irrational#Lambert's proof|proof that {{pi}} is irrational]], by using the following continued fraction for {{math|tan ''x''}}:<ref>''The Irrationals: A Story of the Numbers You Can't Count On'', Julian Havil, Princeton University Press, 2012, pp.104-105</ref>\n\n:<math>\\tan(x) = \\cfrac{x}{1 + \\cfrac{-x^2}{3 + \\cfrac{-x^2}{5 + \\cfrac{-x^2}{7 + {}\\ddots}}}}</math>\n\nContinued fractions can also be applied to problems in [[number theory]], and are especially useful in the study of [[Diophantine equation]]s. In the late eighteenth century [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] used continued fractions to construct the general solution of [[Pell's equation]], thus answering a question that had fascinated mathematicians for more than a thousand years.<ref>[[Brahmagupta]] (598 - 670) was the first mathematician to make a systematic study of Pell's equation.</ref> Amazingly, Lagrange's discovery implies that the canonical continued fraction expansion of the [[square root#As periodic continued fractions|square root]] of every non-square integer is periodic and that, if the period is of length ''p'' &gt; 1, it contains a [[palindrome|palindromic]] string of length ''p'' - 1.\n\nIn 1813 [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] derived from complex-valued [[hypergeometric function]]s what is now called [[Gauss's continued fraction]]s.<ref>1813  [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], ''Werke'', Vol. 3, pp. 134-138.</ref> They can be used to express many elementary functions and some more advanced functions (such as the [[Bessel function]]s), as continued fractions that are rapidly convergent almost everywhere in the complex plane.\n\n== Notation ==\n\nThe long continued fraction expression displayed in the introduction is probably the most intuitive form for the reader. Unfortunately, it takes up a lot of space in a book (and it's not easy for the typesetter, either). So mathematicians have devised several alternative notations. One convenient way to express a generalized continued fraction looks like this:\n\n:<math>\nx = b_0+\n\\frac{a_1}{b_1+}\\,\n\\frac{a_2}{b_2+}\\,\n\\frac{a_3}{b_3+}\\cdots\n</math>\n\n[[Alfred Pringsheim|Pringsheim]] wrote a generalized continued fraction this way:\n\n:<math>\nx = b_0 + \\frac{a_1 \\mid}{\\mid b_1} + \\frac{a_2 \\mid}{\\mid b_2} + \\frac{a_3 \\mid}{\\mid b_3}+\\cdots\\,\n</math>.\n\n[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] evoked the more familiar [[infinite product]] \u03a0 when he devised this notation:\n\n:<math>\nx = b_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{b_i}.\\,\n</math>\n\nHere the \"K\" stands for ''Kettenbruch'', the German word for \"continued fraction\". This is probably the most compact and convenient way to express continued fractions; however, it is not widely used by English typesetters.\n\n== Some elementary considerations ==\n\nHere are some elementary results that are of fundamental importance in the further development of the analytic theory of continued fractions.\n\n=== Partial numerators and denominators ===\n\nIf one of the partial numerators ''a''<sub>''n''+1</sub> is zero, the infinite continued fraction\n\n:<math>\nb_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{b_i}\\,\n</math>\n\nis really just a finite continued fraction with ''n'' fractional terms, and therefore a [[rational function]] of the first ''n'' ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>'s and the first (''n'' + 1) ''b''<sub>''i''</sub>'s. Such an object is of little interest from the point of view adopted in mathematical analysis, so it is usually assumed that none of the ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> = 0. There is no need to place this restriction on the partial denominators ''b''<sub>''i''</sub>.\n\n=== The determinant formula ===\n\nWhen the ''n''th convergent of a continued fraction\n\n:<math>\nx_n = b_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{n}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{b_i}\\,\n</math>\n\nis expressed as a simple fraction ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> = ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>/''B''<sub>''n''</sub> we can use the ''determinant formula''\n\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>A_{n-1}B_n - A_nB_{n-1} = (-1)^na_1a_2\\cdots a_n = \\Pi_{i=1}^n (-a_i)</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nto relate the numerators and denominators of successive convergents ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> and ''x''<sub>''n''-1</sub> to one another. \nThe proof for this can be easily seen by induction.\n\n'''Base Case'''\n\nIt is trivially true.\n \n'''Inductive Step'''\n\nAssume the ({{EquationNote|1}}) holds for <math>n-1</math>.\nThen we need to see the same relation holding true for <math> n </math>.\nSubstituting the value of <math>A_n</math> and <math>B_n</math> in {{EquationNote|1}} we obtain:\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\n &=b_n A_{n-1} B_{n-1} + a_n A_{n-1} B_{n-2} - b_n A_{n-1} B_{n-1} - a_n A_{n-2} B_{n-1} \\\\\n &=a_n(A_{n-1}B_{n-2} - A_{n-2} B_{n-1})\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhich is true because of our induction hypothesis.\n\n<math>\nA_{n-1}B_n - A_nB_{n-1} = (-1)^na_1a_2\\cdots a_n = \\Pi_{i=1}^n (-a_i)\\,\n</math>\n\nSpecifically, if neither ''B''<sub>''n''</sub> nor ''B''<sub>''n''-1</sub> is zero we can express the difference between the ''n''-1st and ''n''th (''n'' &gt; 0) convergents like this:\n\n:<math>\nx_{n-1} - x_n = \\frac{A_{n-1}}{B_{n-1}} - \\frac{A_n}{B_n} = \n(-1)^n \\frac{a_1a_2\\cdots a_n}{B_nB_{n-1}} = \\frac{\\Pi_{i=1}^n (-a_i)}{B_nB_{n-1}}.\\,\n</math>\n\n=== The equivalence transformation ===\n\nIf {''c''<sub>''i''</sub>} = {''c''<sub>1</sub>, ''c''<sub>2</sub>, ''c''<sub>3</sub>, ...} is any infinite sequence of non-zero complex numbers we can prove, by [[mathematical induction|induction]], that\n\n:<math>\nb_0 + \\cfrac{a_1}{b_1 + \\cfrac{a_2}{b_2 + \\cfrac{a_3}{b_3 + \\cfrac{a_4}{b_4 + \\ddots\\,}}}} =\nb_0 + \\cfrac{c_1a_1}{c_1b_1 + \\cfrac{c_1c_2a_2}{c_2b_2 + \\cfrac{c_2c_3a_3}{c_3b_3 + \\cfrac{c_3c_4a_4}{c_4b_4 + \\ddots\\,}}}}\n</math>\n\nwhere equality is understood as equivalence, which is to say that the successive convergents of the continued fraction on the left are exactly the same as the convergents of the fraction on the right.\n\nThe equivalence transformation is perfectly general, but two particular cases deserve special mention. First, if none of the ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> are zero a sequence {''c''<sub>''i''</sub>} can be chosen to make each partial numerator a 1:\n\n:<math>\nb_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{b_i} = \nb_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{1}{c_i b_i}\\,\n</math>\n<!--b_0 + \\cfrac{a_1}{b_1 + \\cfrac{a_2}{b_2 + \\cfrac{a_3}{b_3 + \\cfrac{a_4}{\\ddots\\,}}}} =\nb_0 + \\cfrac{1}{c_1b_1 + \\cfrac{1}{c_2b_2 + \\cfrac{1}{c_3b_3 + \\cfrac{1}{c_4b_4 + \\ddots\\,}}}}-->\n\nwhere ''c''<sub>1</sub> = 1/''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''c''<sub>2</sub> = ''a''<sub>1</sub>/''a''<sub>2</sub>, ''c''<sub>3</sub> = ''a''<sub>2</sub>/(''a''<sub>1</sub>''a''<sub>3</sub>), and in general ''c''<sub>''n''+1</sub> = 1/(''a''<sub>''n''+1</sub>''c''<sub>''n''</sub>).\n\nSecond, if none of the partial denominators ''b''<sub>''i''</sub> are zero we can use a similar procedure to choose another sequence {''d''<sub>''i''</sub>} to make each partial denominator a 1:\n\n:<math>\nb_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{b_i} = \nb_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{d_i a_i}{1}\\,\n</math>\n<!--b_0 + \\cfrac{a_1}{b_1 + \\cfrac{a_2}{b_2 + \\cfrac{a_3}{b_3 + \\cfrac{a_4}{b_4 + \\ddots\\,}}}} =\nb_0 + \\cfrac{d_1a_1}{1 + \\cfrac{d_2a_2}{1 + \\cfrac{d_3a_3}{1 + \\cfrac{d_4a_4}{1 + \\ddots\\,}}}}-->\n\nwhere ''d''<sub>1</sub> = 1/''b''<sub>1</sub> and otherwise ''d''<sub>''n''+1</sub> = 1/(''b''<sub>''n''</sub>''b''<sub>''n''+1</sub>).\n\nThese two special cases of the equivalence transformation are enormously useful when the general [[convergence problem]] is analyzed.\n\n=== Simple convergence concepts ===\n\nIt has already been noted that the continued fraction\n\n:<math>\nx = b_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{b_i}\\,\n</math>\n\nconverges if the sequence of convergents {''x''<sub>''n''</sub>} tends to a finite limit.\n\nThe notion of [[absolute convergence]] plays a central role in the theory of [[infinite series]]. No corresponding notion exists in the analytic theory of continued fractions &ndash; in other words, mathematicians do not speak of an ''absolutely convergent'' continued fraction. Sometimes the notion of absolute convergence does enter the discussion, however, especially in the study of the convergence problem. For instance, a particular continued fraction\n\n:<math>\nx = \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{1}{b_i}\\,\n</math>\n\ndiverges by oscillation if the series ''b''<sub>1</sub> + ''b''<sub>2</sub> + ''b''<sub>3</sub> + ... is absolutely convergent.<ref>1895  [[Helge von Koch]], ''Bull. Soc. Math. de France'', \"Sur un th\u00e9or\u00e8me de Stieltjes et sur les fractions continues\".</ref>\n\nSometimes the partial numerators and partial denominators of a continued fraction are expressed as functions of a complex variable ''z''. For example, a relatively simple function<ref>When ''z'' is taken to be an integer this function is quite famous; it generates the [[golden ratio]] and the closely related sequence of [[silver ratio#Silver means|silver means]].</ref> might be defined as\n\n:<math>\nf(z) = \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{1}{z}.\\,\n</math>\n\nFor a continued fraction like this one the notion of [[uniform convergence]] arises quite naturally. A continued fraction of one or more complex variables is ''uniformly convergent'' in an [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|open neighborhood]] \u03a9 if the fraction's convergents converge uniformly at every point in \u03a9. Or, more precisely: if, for every ''\u03b5'' &gt; 0 an integer ''M'' can be found such that the [[absolute value]] of the difference\n\n:<math>\nf(z) - f_n(z) = \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i(z)}{b_i(z)}\n- \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{n}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i(z)}{b_i(z)}\\,\n</math>\n\nis less than ''\u03b5'' for every point ''z'' in an open neighborhood \u03a9 whenever ''n'' &gt; ''M'', the continued fraction defining ''f''(''z'') is uniformly convergent on \u03a9. (Here ''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(''z'') denotes the ''n''th convergent of the continued fraction, evaluated at the point ''z'' inside \u03a9, and ''f''(''z'') is the value of the infinite continued fraction at the point ''z''.)\n\nThe [[\u015aleszy\u0144ski\u2013Pringsheim theorem]] provides a sufficient condition for convergence.\n\n=== Even and odd convergents ===\n\nIt is sometimes necessary to separate a continued fraction into its even and odd parts. For example, if the continued fraction diverges by oscillation between two distinct limit points ''p'' and ''q'', then the sequence {''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>4</sub>, ...} must converge to one of these, and {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>, ''x''<sub>5</sub>, ...} must converge to the other. In such a situation it may be convenient to express the original continued fraction as two different continued fractions, one of them converging to ''p'', and the other converging to ''q''.\n\nThe formulas for the even and odd parts of a continued fraction can be written most compactly if the fraction has already been transformed so that all its partial denominators are unity. Specifically, if\n\n:<math>\nx = \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{1}\\,\n</math>\n\nis a continued fraction, then the even part ''x''<sub>even</sub> and the odd part ''x''<sub>odd</sub> are given by\n\n:<math>\nx_\\mathrm{even} = \\cfrac{a_1}{1+a_2-\\cfrac{a_2a_3} {1+a_3+a_4-\\cfrac{a_4a_5} {1+a_5+a_6-\\cfrac{a_6a_7} {1+a_7+a_8-\\ddots}}}}\\,\n</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\nx_\\mathrm{odd} = a_1 - \\cfrac{a_1a_2}{1+a_2+a_3-\\cfrac{a_3a_4} {1+a_4+a_5-\\cfrac{a_5a_6} {1+a_6+a_7-\\cfrac{a_7a_8} {1+a_8+a_9-\\ddots}}}}\\,\n</math>\n\nrespectively. More precisely, if the successive convergents of the continued fraction ''x'' are {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>, ...}, then the successive convergents of ''x''<sub>even</sub> as written above are {''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>4</sub>, ''x''<sub>6</sub>, ...}, and the successive convergents of ''x''<sub>odd</sub> are {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>, ''x''<sub>5</sub>, ...}.<ref>1929 [[Oskar Perron]], ''Die Lehre von den Kettenbr\u00fcchen'' derives even more general extension and contraction formulas for continued fractions.</ref>\n\n===Conditions for irrationality===\n\nIf <math> a_1,a_2, \\text{ . . .}</math> and <math> b_1,b_2, \\text{ . . .}</math> are positive integers with <math> a_k </math> \u2264 <math> b_k </math> for all sufficiently large <math> k </math>, then\n:<math>\nx = b_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{b_i}\\,\n</math>\n\nconverges to an irrational limit.<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last        = Angell\n  | first       = David\n  | title       = Irrationality and Transcendence - Lambert's Irrationality Proofs\n  | publisher   = School of Mathematics, University of New South Wales\n  | year        = 2007\n  | url         = http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~angell/5535}}</ref>\n\n===Fundamental recurrence formulas===\n\nThe partial numerators and denominators of the fraction's successive convergents are related by the ''fundamental recurrence formulas'':\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nA_{-1}& = 1& B_{-1}& = 0\\\\\nA_0& = b_0& B_0& = 1\\\\\nA_{n+1}& = b_{n+1} A_n + a_{n+1} A_{n-1}& B_{n+1}& = b_{n+1} B_n + a_{n+1} B_{n-1}\\,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe continued fraction's successive convergents are then given by\n:<math>x_n=\\frac{A_n}{B_n}.\\,</math>\n\nThese recurrence relations are due to [[John Wallis]] (1616-1703) and [[Leonhard Euler]] (1707-1783).<ref name=num_theory>{{cite web|first=\u0160tefan |last=Porubsk\u00fd |title=Basic definitions for continued fractions |work=Interactive Information Portal for Algorithmic Mathematics |publisher=Institute of Computer Science of the Czech Academy of Sciences |location=Prague, Czech Republic |url=http://www.cs.cas.cz/portal/AlgoMath/NumberTheory/ContinuedFractions/BasicDefinitions.htm |accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs an example, consider the [[continued fraction|regular continued fraction in canonical form]] that represents the [[golden ratio|golden ratio \u03c6]]:\n\n:<math>x = 1 + \\cfrac{1}{1 + \\cfrac{1}{1 + \\cfrac{1}{1 + \\cfrac{1}{1 + \\ddots\\,}}}} </math>\n\nApplying the fundamental recurrence formulas we find that the successive numerators ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> are {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...} and the successive denominators  ''B''<sub>''n''</sub> are {1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...}, the [[Fibonacci number]]s. Since all the partial numerators in this example are equal to one, the determinant formula assures us that the absolute value of the difference between successive convergents approaches zero quite rapidly.\n\n== Linear fractional transformations ==\n\nA linear fractional transformation (LFT) is a [[complex function]] of the form\n\n:<math>\nw = f(z) = \\frac{a + bz}{c + dz},\\,\n</math>\n\nwhere ''z'' is a complex variable, and ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' are arbitrary complex constants such that <math>c+dz\\neq 0</math>. An additional restriction &ndash; that ''ad'' \u2260 ''bc'' &ndash; is customarily imposed, to rule out the cases in which ''w'' = ''f''(''z'') is a constant. The linear fractional transformation, also known as a [[M\u00f6bius transformation]], has many fascinating properties. Four of these are of primary importance in developing the analytic theory of continued fractions.\n*If ''d'' \u2260 0 the LFT has one or two [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]]. This can be seen by considering the equation\n\n::<math>\nf(z) = z \\Rightarrow dz^2 + cz = a + bz\\,\n</math>\n\n:which is clearly a [[quadratic equation]] in ''z''. The roots of this equation are the fixed points of ''f''(''z''). If the [[discriminant]] (''c'' &minus; ''b'')<sup>2</sup> + 4''ad'' is zero the LFT fixes a single point; otherwise it has two fixed points.\n\n*If ''ad'' \u2260 ''bc'' the LFT is an [[bijection|invertible]] [[conformal map]]ping of the [[Riemann sphere|extended complex plane]] onto itself.

In other words, the set of all LFTs for which ''ad'' \u2260 ''bc'' is closed under composition of functions. The collection of all such LFTs &ndash; together with the \"group operation\" composition of functions &ndash; is known as the [[automorphism group]] of the extended complex plane.\n*If ''b'' = 0 the LFT reduces to\n\n::<math>\nw = f(z) = \\frac{a}{c + dz},\\,\n</math>\n\n:which is a very simple [[meromorphic function]] of ''z'' with one [[pole (complex analysis)|simple pole]] (at &minus;''c''/''d'') and a [[residue theorem|residue]] equal to ''a''/''d''.

We also introduce a new symbol '''''\u03a4'''''<sub>'''''n'''''</sub> to represent the composition of ''n''+1 little ''\u03c4''s &ndash; that is,\n\n:<math>\n\\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{1}}(z) = \\tau_0\\circ\\tau_1(z) = \\tau_0(\\tau_1(z)),\\quad\n\\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{2}}(z) = \\tau_0\\circ\\tau_1\\circ\\tau_2(z) = \\tau_0(\\tau_1(\\tau_2(z))),\\,\n</math>\n\nand so forth.

And, since ''b''<sub>''n''</sub> + 0 = ''b''<sub>''n''</sub>, the image of the point ''z'' = 0 under the iterated LFT '''''\u03a4'''''<sub>'''''n'''''</sub> is indeed the value of the finite continued fraction with ''n'' partial numerators:\n\n:<math>\n\\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{n}}(0) = \\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{n+1}}(\\infty) = \nb_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{n}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{b_i}.\\,\n</math>\n\n=== A geometric interpretation ===\n\nDefining a finite continued fraction as the image of a point under the iterated [[M\u00f6bius transformation|linear functional transformation]] '''\u03a4'''<sub>'''n'''</sub>(''z'') leads to an intuitively appealing geometric interpretation of infinite continued fractions.\n\nThe relationship\n\n:<math>\nx_n = b_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{n}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{b_i} = \\frac{A_n}{B_n} = \\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{n}}(0) = \\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{n+1}}(\\infty)\\,\n</math>\n\ncan be understood by rewriting '''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''(''z'') and '''\u03a4<sub>''n''+1</sub>'''(''z'') in terms of the [[#Fundamental recurrence formulas|fundamental recurrence formulas]]:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{n}}(z)& = \\frac{(b_n+z)A_{n-1} + a_nA_{n-2}}{(b_n+z)B_{n-1} + a_nB_{n-2}}& \\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{n}}(z)& =  \\frac{zA_{n-1} + A_n}{zB_{n-1} + B_n};\\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{n+1}}(z)& = \\frac{(b_{n+1}+z)A_n + a_{n+1}A_{n-1}}{(b_{n+1}+z)B_n + a_{n+1}B_{n-1}}& \\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{n+1}}(z)& = \\frac{zA_n + A_{n+1}} {zB_n + B_{n+1}}.\\,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nIn the first of these equations the ratio tends toward ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>/''B''<sub>''n''</sub> as ''z'' tends toward zero. In the second, the ratio tends toward ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>/''B''<sub>''n''</sub> as ''z'' tends to infinity. This leads us to our first geometric interpretation. If the continued fraction converges, the successive convergents ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>/''B''<sub>''n''</sub> are eventually [[cauchy sequence|arbitrarily close together]]. Since the linear fractional transformation '''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''(''z'') is a [[continuous function|continuous mapping]], there must be a neighborhood of ''z'' = 0 that is mapped into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of '''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''(0) = ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>/''B''<sub>''n''</sub>. Similarly, there must be a neighborhood of the point at infinity which is mapped into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of '''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''(\u221e) = ''A''<sub>''n''-1</sub>/''B''<sub>''n''-1</sub>. So if the continued fraction converges the transformation '''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''(''z'') maps both very small ''z'' and very large ''z'' into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of ''x'', the value of the continued fraction, as ''n'' gets larger and larger.\n\nWhat about intermediate values of ''z''? Well, since the successive convergents are getting closer together we must have\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{A_{n-1}}{B_{n-1}} \\approx \\frac{A_n}{B_n} \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \n\\frac{A_{n-1}}{A_n} \\approx \\frac{B_{n-1}}{B_n} = k\\,\n</math>\n\nwhere ''k'' is a constant, introduced for convenience. But then, by substituting in the expression for '''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''(''z'') we obtain\n\n:<math>\n\\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{n}}(z) = \\frac{zA_{n-1} + A_n}{zB_{n-1} + B_n}\n= \\frac{A_n}{B_n} \\left(\\frac{z\\frac{A_{n-1}}{A_n} + 1}{z\\frac{B_{n-1}}{B_n} + 1}\\right)\n\\approx \\frac{A_n}{B_n} \\left(\\frac{zk + 1}{zk + 1}\\right) = \\frac{A_n}{B_n}\\,\n</math>\n\nso that even the intermediate values of ''z'' (except when ''z'' \u2248 &minus;''k''<sup>&minus;1</sup>) are mapped into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of ''x'', the value of the continued fraction, as ''n'' gets larger and larger. Intuitively, it is almost as if the convergent continued fraction maps the entire extended complex plane into a single point.<ref>This intuitive interpretation is not rigorous because an infinite continued fraction is not a mapping &ndash; it is the ''limit'' of a sequence of mappings. This construction of an infinite continued fraction is roughly analogous to the construction of an irrational number as the limit of a [[Cauchy sequence]] of rational numbers.</ref>\n\nNotice that the sequence {'''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''} lies within the [[automorphism group]] of the extended complex plane, since each '''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>''' is a linear fractional transformation for which ''ab'' \u2260 ''cd''. And every member of that automorphism group maps the extended complex plane into itself &ndash; not one of the '''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''s can possibly map the plane into a single point. Yet in the limit the sequence {'''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''} defines an infinite continued fraction which (if i\nt converges) represents a single point in the complex plane.\n\nHow is this possible? Think of it this way. When an infinite continued fraction converges, the corresponding sequence {'''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''} of LFTs \"focuses\" the plane in the direction of ''x'', the value of the continued fraction. At each stage of the process a larger and larger region of the plane is mapped into a neighborhood of ''x'', and the smaller and smaller region of the plane that's left over is stretched out ever more thinly to cover everything outside that neighborhood.<ref>Because of analogies like this one, the theory of [[conformal map]]ping is sometimes described as \"rubber sheet geometry\".</ref>\n\nWhat about divergent continued fractions? Can those also be interpreted geometrically? In a word, yes. We distinguish three cases.\n#The two sequences {'''\u03a4<sub>2''n''-1</sub>'''} and {'''\u03a4<sub>2''n''</sub>'''} might themselves define two convergent continued fractions that have two different values, ''x''<sub>odd</sub> and ''x''<sub>even</sub>. In this case the continued fraction defined by the sequence {'''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''} diverges by oscillation between two distinct limit points. And in fact this idea can be generalized &ndash; sequences {'''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''} can be constructed that oscillate among three, or four, or indeed any number of limit points. Interesting instances of this case arise when the sequence {'''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''} constitutes a [[subgroup]] of finite order within the group of automorphisms over the extended complex plane.\n# The sequence {'''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''} may produce an infinite number of zero denominators ''B''<sub>''i''</sub> while also producing a subsequence of finite convergents. These finite convergents may not repeat themselves or fall into a recognizable oscillating pattern. Or they may converge to a finite limit, or even oscillate among multiple finite limits. No matter how the finite convergents behave, the continued fraction defined by the sequence {'''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''} diverges by oscillation with the point at infinity in this case.<ref>One approach to the [[convergence problem]] is to construct ''positive definite'' continued fractions, for which the denominators ''B''<sub>''i''</sub> are never zero.</ref>\n#The sequence {'''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''} may produce no more than a finite number of zero denominators ''B''<sub>''i''</sub>. while the subsequence of finite convergents dances wildly around the plane in a pattern that never repeats itself and never approaches any finite limit, either.\n\nInteresting examples of cases 1 and 3 can be constructed by studying the simple continued fraction\n\n:<math>\nx = 1 + \\cfrac{z}{1 + \\cfrac{z}{1 + \\cfrac{z}{1 + \\cfrac{z}{1 + \\ddots}}}}\\,\n</math>\n\nwhere ''z'' is any real number such that ''z'' &lt; &minus;\u00bc.<ref>This periodic fraction of period one is discussed more fully in the article [[convergence problem]].</ref>\n\n== Euler's continued fraction formula ==\n{{main|Euler's continued fraction formula}}\n\n[[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] proved the following identity:<ref name=\"Euler\"/>\n\n:<math>\na_0 + a_0a_1 + a_0a_1a_2 + \\cdots + a_0a_1a_2\\cdots a_n =\n\\frac{a_0}{1-}\n\\frac{a_1}{1+a_1-}\n\\frac{a_2}{1+a_2-}\\cdots\n\\frac{a_{n}}{1+a_n}.\\,\n</math>\n\nFrom this many other results can be derived, such as\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{1}{u_1}+\n\\frac{1}{u_2}+\n\\frac{1}{u_3}+\n\\cdots+\n\\frac{1}{u_n} =\n\\frac{1}{u_1-}\n\\frac{u_1^2}{u_1+u_2-}\n\\frac{u_2^2}{u_2+u_3-}\\cdots\n\\frac{u_{n-1}^2}{u_{n-1}+u_n},\\,\n</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{1}{a_0} + \\frac{x}{a_0a_1} + \\frac{x^2}{a_0a_1a_2} + \\cdots +\n\\frac{x^n}{a_0a_1a_2 \\ldots a_n} =\n\\frac{1}{a_0-}\n\\frac{a_0x}{a_1+x-}\n\\frac{a_1x}{a_2+x-}\\cdots\n\\frac{a_{n-1}x}{a_n+x}.\\,\n</math>\n\nEuler's formula connecting continued fractions and series is the motivation for the {{clarify|text=fundamental inequalities|pre-text=link or|date=September 2014}}, and also the basis of elementary approaches to the [[convergence problem]].\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Transcendental functions and numbers===\n\nHere are two continued fractions that can be built via [[Euler's continued fraction formula|Euler's identity]].\n\n<math>\ne^x = \\frac{x^0}{0!} + \\frac{x^1}{1!} + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!} + \\cdots \n= 1+\\cfrac{x} {1-\\cfrac{1x} {2+x-\\cfrac{2x} {3+x-\\cfrac{3x} {4+x-\\ddots}}}}\n</math>\n\n<math>\n\\log(1+x) = \\frac{x^1}{1} - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots \n=\\cfrac{x} {1-0x+\\cfrac{1^2x} {2-1x+\\cfrac{2^2x} {3-2x+\\cfrac{3^2x} {4-3x+\\ddots}}}}\n</math>\n\nHere are additional generalized continued fractions:\n\n<math>\n\\tan^{-1}\\cfrac{x}{y}=\\cfrac{xy} {1y^2+\\cfrac{(1xy)^2} {3y^2-1x^2+\\cfrac{(3xy)^2} {5y^2-3x^2+\\cfrac{(5xy)^2} {7y^2-5x^2+\\ddots}}}}\n=\\cfrac{x} {1y+\\cfrac{(1x)^2} {3y+\\cfrac{(2x)^2} {5y+\\cfrac{(3x)^2} {7y+\\ddots}}}}\n</math>\n\n<math>\ne^{x/y} = 1+\\cfrac{2x} {2y-x+\\cfrac{x^2} {6y+\\cfrac{x^2} {10y+\\cfrac{x^2} {14y+\\cfrac{x^2} {18y+\\ddots}}}}};\\;\ne^2 = 7+\\cfrac{2} {5+\\cfrac{1} {7+\\cfrac{1} {9+\\cfrac{1} {11+\\ddots}}}}\n</math>\n\n<math>\n\\log \\left( 1+\\frac{x}{y} \\right) = \\cfrac{x} {y+\\cfrac{1x} {2+\\cfrac{1x} {3y+\\cfrac{2x} {2+\\cfrac{2x} {5y+\\cfrac{3x} {2+\\ddots}}}}}} \n= \\cfrac{2x} {2y+x-\\cfrac{(1x)^2} {3(2y+x)-\\cfrac{(2x)^2} {5(2y+x)-\\cfrac{(3x)^2} {7(2y+x)-\\ddots}}}}\n</math>\n\nThis last is based on an algorithm derived by Alekse\u012d Nikolaevich Khovanski\u012d in the 1970s.<ref>[https://math.stackexchange.com/q/75074 An alternative way to calculate log(x)]</ref>\n\nExample: the [[natural logarithm of 2]] (= [0;1,2,3,1,5,2/3,7,1/2,9,2/5,...,2k-1,2/k,...] \u2248 0.693147...):<ref>[http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EMIS/journals/EM/expmath/volumes/13/13.3/BorweinCrandallFee.pdf On the Ramanujan AGM Fraction, I: The Real-Parameter Case.

For example, there is a close relationship between the simple continued fraction in canonical form for the irrational real number \u03b1, and the way [[lattice point]]s in two dimensions lie to either side of the line ''y'' = \u03b1''x''. Generalizing this idea, one might ask about something related to lattice points in three or more dimensions. One reason to study this area is to quantify the [[mathematical coincidence]] idea; for example, for [[monomial]]s in several real numbers, take the [[logarithmic form]] and consider how small it can be.  Another reason is to find a possible solution to [[Hermite's problem]].\n\nThere have been numerous attempts to construct a generalized theory. Notable efforts in this direction were made by [[Felix Klein]] (the [[Klein polyhedron]]), [[Georges Poitou]] and [[George Szekeres]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gauss's continued fraction]]\n* [[Pad\u00e9 table]]\n* [[Solving quadratic equations with continued fractions]]\n* [[Convergence problem]]\n* [[Infinite compositions of analytic functions]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation | last1=Jones | first1=William B. | last2=Thron | first2=W.J. | title=Continued fractions.

It may diverge by oscillation (for example, the odd and even convergents may approach two different limits), or it may produce an infinite number of zero denominators ''B''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe story of continued fractions begins with the [[Euclidean algorithm]],<ref>300 BC [[Euclid]], ''Elements'' -  The Euclidean algorithm generates a continued fraction as a by-product.</ref> a procedure for finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of two natural numbers ''m'' and ''n''. That algorithm introduced the idea of dividing to extract a new remainder &ndash; and then dividing by the new remainder repeatedly.\n\nNearly two thousand years passed before [[Rafael Bombelli]]<ref>1579  [[Rafael Bombelli]], ''L'Algebra Opera''</ref> devised a [[Solving quadratic equations with continued fractions|technique for approximating the roots of quadratic equations]] with continued fractions. Now the pace of development quickened. Just 24 years later [[Pietro Cataldi]] introduced the first formal notation<ref>1613  [[Pietro Cataldi]], ''Trattato del modo brevissimo di trovar la radice quadra delli numeri''; roughly translated, ''A treatise on a quick way to find square roots of numbers''.</ref> for the generalized continued fraction. Cataldi represented a continued fraction as\n\n:<math>a_0.\\,</math> &<math> n_1 \\over d_1. </math> &<math> n_2 \\over d_2. </math> &<math> {n_3 \\over d_3},</math>\n\nwith the dots indicating where the next fraction goes, and each & representing a modern plus sign.\n\nLate in the seventeenth century [[John Wallis]]<ref>1695  [[John Wallis]], ''Opera Mathematica'', Latin for ''Mathematical Works''.</ref> introduced the term \"continued fraction\" into mathematical literature. New techniques for mathematical analysis  ([[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz's]] [[calculus]]) had recently come onto the scene, and a generation of Wallis' contemporaries put the new phrase to use.\n\nIn 1748 [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] published a theorem showing that a particular kind of continued fraction is equivalent to a certain very general [[infinite series]].<ref name=\"Euler\">1748  [[Leonhard Euler]], ''Introductio in analysin infinitorum'', Vol. I, Chapter 18.</ref> [[Euler's continued fraction formula]] is still the basis of many modern proofs of [[convergence problem|convergence of continued fractions]].\n\nIn 1761, [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] gave the first [[Proof that \u03c0 is irrational#Lambert's proof|proof that {{pi}} is irrational]], by using the following continued fraction for {{math|tan ''x''}}:<ref>''The Irrationals: A Story of the Numbers You Can't Count On'', Julian Havil, Princeton University Press, 2012, pp.104-105</ref>\n\n:<math>\\tan(x) = \\cfrac{x}{1 + \\cfrac{-x^2}{3 + \\cfrac{-x^2}{5 + \\cfrac{-x^2}{7 + {}\\ddots}}}}</math>\n\nContinued fractions can also be applied to problems in [[number theory]], and are especially useful in the study of [[Diophantine equation]]s. In the late eighteenth century [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] used continued fractions to construct the general solution of [[Pell's equation]], thus answering a question that had fascinated mathematicians for more than a thousand years.<ref>[[Brahmagupta]] (598 - 670) was the first mathematician to make a systematic study of Pell's equation.</ref> Amazingly, Lagrange's discovery implies that the canonical continued fraction expansion of the [[square root#As periodic continued fractions|square root]] of every non-square integer is periodic and that, if the period is of length ''p'' &gt; 1, it contains a [[palindrome|palindromic]] string of length ''p'' - 1.\n\nIn 1813 [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] derived from complex-valued [[hypergeometric function]]s what is now called [[Gauss's continued fraction]]s.<ref>1813  [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], ''Werke'', Vol. 3, pp. 134-138.</ref> They can be used to express many elementary functions and some more advanced functions (such as the [[Bessel function]]s), as continued fractions that are rapidly convergent almost everywhere in the complex plane.\n\n== Notation ==\n\nThe long continued fraction expression displayed in the introduction is probably the most intuitive form for the reader. Unfortunately, it takes up a lot of space in a book (and it's not easy for the typesetter, either). So mathematicians have devised several alternative notations. One convenient way to express a generalized continued fraction looks like this:\n\n:<math>\nx = b_0+\n\\frac{a_1}{b_1+}\\,\n\\frac{a_2}{b_2+}\\,\n\\frac{a_3}{b_3+}\\cdots\n</math>\n\n[[Alfred Pringsheim|Pringsheim]] wrote a generalized continued fraction this way:\n\n:<math>\nx = b_0 + \\frac{a_1 \\mid}{\\mid b_1} + \\frac{a_2 \\mid}{\\mid b_2} + \\frac{a_3 \\mid}{\\mid b_3}+\\cdots\\,\n</math>.\n\n[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] evoked the more familiar [[infinite product]] \u03a0 when he devised this notation:\n\n:<math>\nx = b_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{b_i}.\\,\n</math>\n\nHere the \"K\" stands for ''Kettenbruch'', the German word for \"continued fraction\". This is probably the most compact and convenient way to express continued fractions; however, it is not widely used by English typesetters.\n\n== Some elementary considerations ==\n\nHere are some elementary results that are of fundamental importance in the further development of the analytic theory of continued fractions.\n\n=== Partial numerators and denominators ===\n\nIf one of the partial numerators ''a''<sub>''n''+1</sub> is zero, the infinite continued fraction\n\n:<math>\nb_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{b_i}\\,\n</math>\n\nis really just a finite continued fraction with ''n'' fractional terms, and therefore a [[rational function]] of the first ''n'' ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>'s and the first (''n'' + 1) ''b''<sub>''i''</sub>'s. Such an object is of little interest from the point of view adopted in mathematical analysis, so it is usually assumed that none of the ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> = 0. There is no need to place this restriction on the partial denominators ''b''<sub>''i''</sub>.\n\n=== The determinant formula ===\n\nWhen the ''n''th convergent of a continued fraction\n\n:<math>\nx_n = b_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{n}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{b_i}\\,\n</math>\n\nis expressed as a simple fraction ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> = ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>/''B''<sub>''n''</sub> we can use the ''determinant formula''\n\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>A_{n-1}B_n - A_nB_{n-1} = (-1)^na_1a_2\\cdots a_n = \\Pi_{i=1}^n (-a_i)</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nto relate the numerators and denominators of successive convergents ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> and ''x''<sub>''n''-1</sub> to one another. \nThe proof for this can be easily seen by induction.\n\n'''Base Case'''\n\nIt is trivially true.\n \n'''Inductive Step'''\n\nAssume the ({{EquationNote|1}}) holds for <math>n-1</math>.\nThen we need to see the same relation holding true for <math> n </math>.\nSubstituting the value of <math>A_n</math> and <math>B_n</math> in {{EquationNote|1}} we obtain:\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\n &=b_n A_{n-1} B_{n-1} + a_n A_{n-1} B_{n-2} - b_n A_{n-1} B_{n-1} - a_n A_{n-2} B_{n-1} \\\\\n &=a_n(A_{n-1}B_{n-2} - A_{n-2} B_{n-1})\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhich is true because of our induction hypothesis.\n\n<math>\nA_{n-1}B_n - A_nB_{n-1} = (-1)^na_1a_2\\cdots a_n = \\Pi_{i=1}^n (-a_i)\\,\n</math>\n\nSpecifically, if neither ''B''<sub>''n''</sub> nor ''B''<sub>''n''-1</sub> is zero we can express the difference between the ''n''-1st and ''n''th (''n'' &gt; 0) convergents like this:\n\n:<math>\nx_{n-1} - x_n = \\frac{A_{n-1}}{B_{n-1}} - \\frac{A_n}{B_n} = \n(-1)^n \\frac{a_1a_2\\cdots a_n}{B_nB_{n-1}} = \\frac{\\Pi_{i=1}^n (-a_i)}{B_nB_{n-1}}.\\,\n</math>\n\n=== The equivalence transformation ===\n\nIf {''c''<sub>''i''</sub>} = {''c''<sub>1</sub>, ''c''<sub>2</sub>, ''c''<sub>3</sub>, ...} is any infinite sequence of non-zero complex numbers we can prove, by [[mathematical induction|induction]], that\n\n:<math>\nb_0 + \\cfrac{a_1}{b_1 + \\cfrac{a_2}{b_2 + \\cfrac{a_3}{b_3 + \\cfrac{a_4}{b_4 + \\ddots\\,}}}} =\nb_0 + \\cfrac{c_1a_1}{c_1b_1 + \\cfrac{c_1c_2a_2}{c_2b_2 + \\cfrac{c_2c_3a_3}{c_3b_3 + \\cfrac{c_3c_4a_4}{c_4b_4 + \\ddots\\,}}}}\n</math>\n\nwhere equality is understood as equivalence, which is to say that the successive convergents of the continued fraction on the left are exactly the same as the convergents of the fraction on the right.\n\nThe equivalence transformation is perfectly general, but two particular cases deserve special mention. First, if none of the ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> are zero a sequence {''c''<sub>''i''</sub>} can be chosen to make each partial numerator a 1:\n\n:<math>\nb_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{b_i} = \nb_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{1}{c_i b_i}\\,\n</math>\n<!--b_0 + \\cfrac{a_1}{b_1 + \\cfrac{a_2}{b_2 + \\cfrac{a_3}{b_3 + \\cfrac{a_4}{\\ddots\\,}}}} =\nb_0 + \\cfrac{1}{c_1b_1 + \\cfrac{1}{c_2b_2 + \\cfrac{1}{c_3b_3 + \\cfrac{1}{c_4b_4 + \\ddots\\,}}}}-->\n\nwhere ''c''<sub>1</sub> = 1/''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''c''<sub>2</sub> = ''a''<sub>1</sub>/''a''<sub>2</sub>, ''c''<sub>3</sub> = ''a''<sub>2</sub>/(''a''<sub>1</sub>''a''<sub>3</sub>), and in general ''c''<sub>''n''+1</sub> = 1/(''a''<sub>''n''+1</sub>''c''<sub>''n''</sub>).\n\nSecond, if none of the partial denominators ''b''<sub>''i''</sub> are zero we can use a similar procedure to choose another sequence {''d''<sub>''i''</sub>} to make each partial denominator a 1:\n\n:<math>\nb_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{b_i} = \nb_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{d_i a_i}{1}\\,\n</math>\n<!--b_0 + \\cfrac{a_1}{b_1 + \\cfrac{a_2}{b_2 + \\cfrac{a_3}{b_3 + \\cfrac{a_4}{b_4 + \\ddots\\,}}}} =\nb_0 + \\cfrac{d_1a_1}{1 + \\cfrac{d_2a_2}{1 + \\cfrac{d_3a_3}{1 + \\cfrac{d_4a_4}{1 + \\ddots\\,}}}}-->\n\nwhere ''d''<sub>1</sub> = 1/''b''<sub>1</sub> and otherwise ''d''<sub>''n''+1</sub> = 1/(''b''<sub>''n''</sub>''b''<sub>''n''+1</sub>).\n\nThese two special cases of the equivalence transformation are enormously useful when the general [[convergence problem]] is analyzed.\n\n=== Simple convergence concepts ===\n\nIt has already been noted that the continued fraction\n\n:<math>\nx = b_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{b_i}\\,\n</math>\n\nconverges if the sequence of convergents {''x''<sub>''n''</sub>} tends to a finite limit.\n\nThe notion of [[absolute convergence]] plays a central role in the theory of [[infinite series]]. No corresponding notion exists in the analytic theory of continued fractions &ndash; in other words, mathematicians do not speak of an ''absolutely convergent'' continued fraction. Sometimes the notion of absolute convergence does enter the discussion, however, especially in the study of the convergence problem. For instance, a particular continued fraction\n\n:<math>\nx = \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{1}{b_i}\\,\n</math>\n\ndiverges by oscillation if the series ''b''<sub>1</sub> + ''b''<sub>2</sub> + ''b''<sub>3</sub> + ... is absolutely convergent.<ref>1895  [[Helge von Koch]], ''Bull. Soc. Math. de France'', \"Sur un th\u00e9or\u00e8me de Stieltjes et sur les fractions continues\".</ref>\n\nSometimes the partial numerators and partial denominators of a continued fraction are expressed as functions of a complex variable ''z''. For example, a relatively simple function<ref>When ''z'' is taken to be an integer this function is quite famous; it generates the [[golden ratio]] and the closely related sequence of [[silver ratio#Silver means|silver means]].</ref> might be defined as\n\n:<math>\nf(z) = \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{1}{z}.\\,\n</math>\n\nFor a continued fraction like this one the notion of [[uniform convergence]] arises quite naturally. A continued fraction of one or more complex variables is ''uniformly convergent'' in an [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|open neighborhood]] \u03a9 if the fraction's convergents converge uniformly at every point in \u03a9. Or, more precisely: if, for every ''\u03b5'' &gt; 0 an integer ''M'' can be found such that the [[absolute value]] of the difference\n\n:<math>\nf(z) - f_n(z) = \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i(z)}{b_i(z)}\n- \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{n}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i(z)}{b_i(z)}\\,\n</math>\n\nis less than ''\u03b5'' for every point ''z'' in an open neighborhood \u03a9 whenever ''n'' &gt; ''M'', the continued fraction defining ''f''(''z'') is uniformly convergent on \u03a9. (Here ''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(''z'') denotes the ''n''th convergent of the continued fraction, evaluated at the point ''z'' inside \u03a9, and ''f''(''z'') is the value of the infinite continued fraction at the point ''z''.)\n\nThe [[\u015aleszy\u0144ski\u2013Pringsheim theorem]] provides a sufficient condition for convergence.\n\n=== Even and odd convergents ===\n\nIt is sometimes necessary to separate a continued fraction into its even and odd parts. For example, if the continued fraction diverges by oscillation between two distinct limit points ''p'' and ''q'', then the sequence {''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>4</sub>, ...} must converge to one of these, and {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>, ''x''<sub>5</sub>, ...} must converge to the other. In such a situation it may be convenient to express the original continued fraction as two different continued fractions, one of them converging to ''p'', and the other converging to ''q''.\n\nThe formulas for the even and odd parts of a continued fraction can be written most compactly if the fraction has already been transformed so that all its partial denominators are unity. Specifically, if\n\n:<math>\nx = \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{1}\\,\n</math>\n\nis a continued fraction, then the even part ''x''<sub>even</sub> and the odd part ''x''<sub>odd</sub> are given by\n\n:<math>\nx_\\mathrm{even} = \\cfrac{a_1}{1+a_2-\\cfrac{a_2a_3} {1+a_3+a_4-\\cfrac{a_4a_5} {1+a_5+a_6-\\cfrac{a_6a_7} {1+a_7+a_8-\\ddots}}}}\\,\n</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\nx_\\mathrm{odd} = a_1 - \\cfrac{a_1a_2}{1+a_2+a_3-\\cfrac{a_3a_4} {1+a_4+a_5-\\cfrac{a_5a_6} {1+a_6+a_7-\\cfrac{a_7a_8} {1+a_8+a_9-\\ddots}}}}\\,\n</math>\n\nrespectively. More precisely, if the successive convergents of the continued fraction ''x'' are {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>, ...}, then the successive convergents of ''x''<sub>even</sub> as written above are {''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>4</sub>, ''x''<sub>6</sub>, ...}, and the successive convergents of ''x''<sub>odd</sub> are {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>, ''x''<sub>5</sub>, ...}.<ref>1929 [[Oskar Perron]], ''Die Lehre von den Kettenbr\u00fcchen'' derives even more general extension and contraction formulas for continued fractions.</ref>\n\n===Conditions for irrationality===\n\nIf <math> a_1,a_2, \\text{ . . .}</math> and <math> b_1,b_2, \\text{ . . .}</math> are positive integers with <math> a_k </math> \u2264 <math> b_k </math> for all sufficiently large <math> k </math>, then\n:<math>\nx = b_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{b_i}\\,\n</math>\n\nconverges to an irrational limit.<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last        = Angell\n  | first       = David\n  | title       = Irrationality and Transcendence - Lambert's Irrationality Proofs\n  | publisher   = School of Mathematics, University of New South Wales\n  | year        = 2007\n  | url         = http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~angell/5535}}</ref>\n\n===Fundamental recurrence formulas===\n\nThe partial numerators and denominators of the fraction's successive convergents are related by the ''fundamental recurrence formulas'':\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nA_{-1}& = 1& B_{-1}& = 0\\\\\nA_0& = b_0& B_0& = 1\\\\\nA_{n+1}& = b_{n+1} A_n + a_{n+1} A_{n-1}& B_{n+1}& = b_{n+1} B_n + a_{n+1} B_{n-1}\\,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe continued fraction's successive convergents are then given by\n:<math>x_n=\\frac{A_n}{B_n}.\\,</math>\n\nThese recurrence relations are due to [[John Wallis]] (1616-1703) and [[Leonhard Euler]] (1707-1783).<ref name=num_theory>{{cite web|first=\u0160tefan |last=Porubsk\u00fd |title=Basic definitions for continued fractions |work=Interactive Information Portal for Algorithmic Mathematics |publisher=Institute of Computer Science of the Czech Academy of Sciences |location=Prague, Czech Republic |url=http://www.cs.cas.cz/portal/AlgoMath/NumberTheory/ContinuedFractions/BasicDefinitions.htm |accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs an example, consider the [[continued fraction|regular continued fraction in canonical form]] that represents the [[golden ratio|golden ratio \u03c6]]:\n\n:<math>x = 1 + \\cfrac{1}{1 + \\cfrac{1}{1 + \\cfrac{1}{1 + \\cfrac{1}{1 + \\ddots\\,}}}} </math>\n\nApplying the fundamental recurrence formulas we find that the successive numerators ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> are {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...} and the successive denominators  ''B''<sub>''n''</sub> are {1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...}, the [[Fibonacci number]]s. Since all the partial numerators in this example are equal to one, the determinant formula assures us that the absolute value of the difference between successive convergents approaches zero quite rapidly.\n\n== Linear fractional transformations ==\n\nA linear fractional transformation (LFT) is a [[complex function]] of the form\n\n:<math>\nw = f(z) = \\frac{a + bz}{c + dz},\\,\n</math>\n\nwhere ''z'' is a complex variable, and ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' are arbitrary complex constants such that <math>c+dz\\neq 0</math>. An additional restriction &ndash; that ''ad'' \u2260 ''bc'' &ndash; is customarily imposed, to rule out the cases in which ''w'' = ''f''(''z'') is a constant. The linear fractional transformation, also known as a [[M\u00f6bius transformation]], has many fascinating properties. Four of these are of primary importance in developing the analytic theory of continued fractions.\n*If ''d'' \u2260 0 the LFT has one or two [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]]. This can be seen by considering the equation\n\n::<math>\nf(z) = z \\Rightarrow dz^2 + cz = a + bz\\,\n</math>\n\n:which is clearly a [[quadratic equation]] in ''z''. The roots of this equation are the fixed points of ''f''(''z''). If the [[discriminant]] (''c'' &minus; ''b'')<sup>2</sup> + 4''ad'' is zero the LFT fixes a single point; otherwise it has two fixed points.\n\n*If ''ad'' \u2260 ''bc'' the LFT is an [[bijection|invertible]] [[conformal map]]ping of the [[Riemann sphere|extended complex plane]] onto itself. In other words, this LFT has an inverse function\n\n::<math>\nz = g(w) = \\frac{-a + cw}{b - dw}\\,\n</math>\n\n:such that ''f''(''g''(''z'')) = ''g''(''f''(''z'')) = ''z'' for every point ''z'' in the extended complex plane, and both ''f'' and ''g'' preserve angles and shapes at vanishingly small scales. From the form of ''z'' = ''g''(''w'') we see that ''g'' is also an LFT.\n\n*The [[function composition|composition]] of two different LFTs for which ''ad'' \u2260 ''bc'' is itself an LFT for which ''ad'' \u2260 ''bc''. In other words, the set of all LFTs for which ''ad'' \u2260 ''bc'' is closed under composition of functions. The collection of all such LFTs &ndash; together with the \"group operation\" composition of functions &ndash; is known as the [[automorphism group]] of the extended complex plane.\n*If ''b'' = 0 the LFT reduces to\n\n::<math>\nw = f(z) = \\frac{a}{c + dz},\\,\n</math>\n\n:which is a very simple [[meromorphic function]] of ''z'' with one [[pole (complex analysis)|simple pole]] (at &minus;''c''/''d'') and a [[residue theorem|residue]] equal to ''a''/''d''. (See also [[Laurent series]].)\n\n=== The continued fraction as a composition of LFTs ===\n\nConsider a sequence of simple linear fractional transformations\n\n:<math>\n\\tau_0(z) = b_0 + z,\\quad \\tau_1(z) = \\frac{a_1}{b_1 + z},\\quad \n\\tau_2(z) = \\frac{a_2}{b_2 + z},\\quad \\tau_3(z) = \\frac{a_3}{b_3 + z},\\quad\\cdots\\,\n</math>\n\nHere we use the Greek letter ''\u03c4'' (tau) to represent each simple LFT, and we adopt the conventional circle notation for composition of functions. We also introduce a new symbol '''''\u03a4'''''<sub>'''''n'''''</sub> to represent the composition of ''n''+1 little ''\u03c4''s &ndash; that is,\n\n:<math>\n\\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{1}}(z) = \\tau_0\\circ\\tau_1(z) = \\tau_0(\\tau_1(z)),\\quad\n\\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{2}}(z) = \\tau_0\\circ\\tau_1\\circ\\tau_2(z) = \\tau_0(\\tau_1(\\tau_2(z))),\\,\n</math>\n\nand so forth. By direct substitution from the first set of expressions into the second we see that\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{1}}(z)& = \\tau_0\\circ\\tau_1(z)& =&\\quad b_0 + \\cfrac{a_1}{b_1 + z}\\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{2}}(z)& = \\tau_0\\circ\\tau_1\\circ\\tau_2(z)& =&\\quad b_0 + \\cfrac{a_1}{b_1 + \\cfrac{a_2}{b_2 + z}}\\,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nand, in general,\n\n:<math>\n\\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{n}}(z) = \\tau_0\\circ\\tau_1\\circ\\tau_2\\circ\\cdots\\circ\\tau_n(z) =\nb_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{n}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{b_i}\\,\n</math>\n\nwhere the last partial denominator in the finite continued fraction ''K'' is understood to be ''b''<sub>''n''</sub> + ''z''. And, since ''b''<sub>''n''</sub> + 0 = ''b''<sub>''n''</sub>, the image of the point ''z'' = 0 under the iterated LFT '''''\u03a4'''''<sub>'''''n'''''</sub> is indeed the value of the finite continued fraction with ''n'' partial numerators:\n\n:<math>\n\\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{n}}(0) = \\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{n+1}}(\\infty) = \nb_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{n}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{b_i}.\\,\n</math>\n\n=== A geometric interpretation ===\n\nDefining a finite continued fraction as the image of a point under the iterated [[M\u00f6bius transformation|linear functional transformation]] '''\u03a4'''<sub>'''n'''</sub>(''z'') leads to an intuitively appealing geometric interpretation of infinite continued fractions.\n\nThe relationship\n\n:<math>\nx_n = b_0 + \\underset{i=1}{\\overset{n}{\\mathrm K}} \\frac{a_i}{b_i} = \\frac{A_n}{B_n} = \\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{n}}(0) = \\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{n+1}}(\\infty)\\,\n</math>\n\ncan be understood by rewriting '''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''(''z'') and '''\u03a4<sub>''n''+1</sub>'''(''z'') in terms of the [[#Fundamental recurrence formulas|fundamental recurrence formulas]]:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{n}}(z)& = \\frac{(b_n+z)A_{n-1} + a_nA_{n-2}}{(b_n+z)B_{n-1} + a_nB_{n-2}}& \\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{n}}(z)& =  \\frac{zA_{n-1} + A_n}{zB_{n-1} + B_n};\\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{n+1}}(z)& = \\frac{(b_{n+1}+z)A_n + a_{n+1}A_{n-1}}{(b_{n+1}+z)B_n + a_{n+1}B_{n-1}}& \\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{n+1}}(z)& = \\frac{zA_n + A_{n+1}} {zB_n + B_{n+1}}.\\,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nIn the first of these equations the ratio tends toward ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>/''B''<sub>''n''</sub> as ''z'' tends toward zero. In the second, the ratio tends toward ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>/''B''<sub>''n''</sub> as ''z'' tends to infinity. This leads us to our first geometric interpretation. If the continued fraction converges, the successive convergents ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>/''B''<sub>''n''</sub> are eventually [[cauchy sequence|arbitrarily close together]]. Since the linear fractional transformation '''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''(''z'') is a [[continuous function|continuous mapping]], there must be a neighborhood of ''z'' = 0 that is mapped into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of '''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''(0) = ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>/''B''<sub>''n''</sub>. Similarly, there must be a neighborhood of the point at infinity which is mapped into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of '''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''(\u221e) = ''A''<sub>''n''-1</sub>/''B''<sub>''n''-1</sub>. So if the continued fraction converges the transformation '''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''(''z'') maps both very small ''z'' and very large ''z'' into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of ''x'', the value of the continued fraction, as ''n'' gets larger and larger.\n\nWhat about intermediate values of ''z''? Well, since the successive convergents are getting closer together we must have\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{A_{n-1}}{B_{n-1}} \\approx \\frac{A_n}{B_n} \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \n\\frac{A_{n-1}}{A_n} \\approx \\frac{B_{n-1}}{B_n} = k\\,\n</math>\n\nwhere ''k'' is a constant, introduced for convenience. But then, by substituting in the expression for '''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''(''z'') we obtain\n\n:<math>\n\\boldsymbol{\\Tau}_{\\boldsymbol{n}}(z) = \\frac{zA_{n-1} + A_n}{zB_{n-1} + B_n}\n= \\frac{A_n}{B_n} \\left(\\frac{z\\frac{A_{n-1}}{A_n} + 1}{z\\frac{B_{n-1}}{B_n} + 1}\\right)\n\\approx \\frac{A_n}{B_n} \\left(\\frac{zk + 1}{zk + 1}\\right) = \\frac{A_n}{B_n}\\,\n</math>\n\nso that even the intermediate values of ''z'' (except when ''z'' \u2248 &minus;''k''<sup>&minus;1</sup>) are mapped into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of ''x'', the value of the continued fraction, as ''n'' gets larger and larger. Intuitively, it is almost as if the convergent continued fraction maps the entire extended complex plane into a single point.<ref>This intuitive interpretation is not rigorous because an infinite continued fraction is not a mapping &ndash; it is the ''limit'' of a sequence of mappings. This construction of an infinite continued fraction is roughly analogous to the construction of an irrational number as the limit of a [[Cauchy sequence]] of rational numbers.</ref>\n\nNotice that the sequence {'''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''} lies within the [[automorphism group]] of the extended complex plane, since each '''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>''' is a linear fractional transformation for which ''ab'' \u2260 ''cd''. And every member of that automorphism group maps the extended complex plane into itself &ndash; not one of the '''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''s can possibly map the plane into a single point. Yet in the limit the sequence {'''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''} defines an infinite continued fraction which (if i\nt converges) represents a single point in the complex plane.\n\nHow is this possible? Think of it this way. When an infinite continued fraction converges, the corresponding sequence {'''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''} of LFTs \"focuses\" the plane in the direction of ''x'', the value of the continued fraction. At each stage of the process a larger and larger region of the plane is mapped into a neighborhood of ''x'', and the smaller and smaller region of the plane that's left over is stretched out ever more thinly to cover everything outside that neighborhood.<ref>Because of analogies like this one, the theory of [[conformal map]]ping is sometimes described as \"rubber sheet geometry\".</ref>\n\nWhat about divergent continued fractions? Can those also be interpreted geometrically? In a word, yes. We distinguish three cases.\n#The two sequences {'''\u03a4<sub>2''n''-1</sub>'''} and {'''\u03a4<sub>2''n''</sub>'''} might themselves define two convergent continued fractions that have two different values, ''x''<sub>odd</sub> and ''x''<sub>even</sub>. In this case the continued fraction defined by the sequence {'''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''} diverges by oscillation between two distinct limit points. And in fact this idea can be generalized &ndash; sequences {'''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''} can be constructed that oscillate among three, or four, or indeed any number of limit points. Interesting instances of this case arise when the sequence {'''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''} constitutes a [[subgroup]] of finite order within the group of automorphisms over the extended complex plane.\n# The sequence {'''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''} may produce an infinite number of zero denominators ''B''<sub>''i''</sub> while also producing a subsequence of finite convergents. These finite convergents may not repeat themselves or fall into a recognizable oscillating pattern. Or they may converge to a finite limit, or even oscillate among multiple finite limits. No matter how the finite convergents behave, the continued fraction defined by the sequence {'''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''} diverges by oscillation with the point at infinity in this case.<ref>One approach to the [[convergence problem]] is to construct ''positive definite'' continued fractions, for which the denominators ''B''<sub>''i''</sub> are never zero.</ref>\n#The sequence {'''\u03a4<sub>''n''</sub>'''} may produce no more than a finite number of zero denominators ''B''<sub>''i''</sub>. while the subsequence of finite convergents dances wildly around the plane in a pattern that never repeats itself and never approaches any finite limit, either.\n\nInteresting examples of cases 1 and 3 can be constructed by studying the simple continued fraction\n\n:<math>\nx = 1 + \\cfrac{z}{1 + \\cfrac{z}{1 + \\cfrac{z}{1 + \\cfrac{z}{1 + \\ddots}}}}\\,\n</math>\n\nwhere ''z'' is any real number such that ''z'' &lt; &minus;\u00bc.<ref>This periodic fraction of period one is discussed more fully in the article [[convergence problem]].</ref>\n\n== Euler's continued fraction formula ==\n{{main|Euler's continued fraction formula}}\n\n[[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] proved the following identity:<ref name=\"Euler\"/>\n\n:<math>\na_0 + a_0a_1 + a_0a_1a_2 + \\cdots + a_0a_1a_2\\cdots a_n =\n\\frac{a_0}{1-}\n\\frac{a_1}{1+a_1-}\n\\frac{a_2}{1+a_2-}\\cdots\n\\frac{a_{n}}{1+a_n}.\\,\n</math>\n\nFrom this many other results can be derived, such as\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{1}{u_1}+\n\\frac{1}{u_2}+\n\\frac{1}{u_3}+\n\\cdots+\n\\frac{1}{u_n} =\n\\frac{1}{u_1-}\n\\frac{u_1^2}{u_1+u_2-}\n\\frac{u_2^2}{u_2+u_3-}\\cdots\n\\frac{u_{n-1}^2}{u_{n-1}+u_n},\\,\n</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{1}{a_0} + \\frac{x}{a_0a_1} + \\frac{x^2}{a_0a_1a_2} + \\cdots +\n\\frac{x^n}{a_0a_1a_2 \\ldots a_n} =\n\\frac{1}{a_0-}\n\\frac{a_0x}{a_1+x-}\n\\frac{a_1x}{a_2+x-}\\cdots\n\\frac{a_{n-1}x}{a_n+x}.\\,\n</math>\n\nEuler's formula connecting continued fractions and series is the motivation for the {{clarify|text=fundamental inequalities|pre-text=link or|date=September 2014}}, and also the basis of elementary approaches to the [[convergence problem]].\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Transcendental functions and numbers===\n\nHere are two continued fractions that can be built via [[Euler's continued fraction formula|Euler's identity]].\n\n<math>\ne^x = \\frac{x^0}{0!} + \\frac{x^1}{1!} + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!} + \\cdots \n= 1+\\cfrac{x} {1-\\cfrac{1x} {2+x-\\cfrac{2x} {3+x-\\cfrac{3x} {4+x-\\ddots}}}}\n</math>\n\n<math>\n\\log(1+x) = \\frac{x^1}{1} - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots \n=\\cfrac{x} {1-0x+\\cfrac{1^2x} {2-1x+\\cfrac{2^2x} {3-2x+\\cfrac{3^2x} {4-3x+\\ddots}}}}\n</math>\n\nHere are additional generalized continued fractions:\n\n<math>\n\\tan^{-1}\\cfrac{x}{y}=\\cfrac{xy} {1y^2+\\cfrac{(1xy)^2} {3y^2-1x^2+\\cfrac{(3xy)^2} {5y^2-3x^2+\\cfrac{(5xy)^2} {7y^2-5x^2+\\ddots}}}}\n=\\cfrac{x} {1y+\\cfrac{(1x)^2} {3y+\\cfrac{(2x)^2} {5y+\\cfrac{(3x)^2} {7y+\\ddots}}}}\n</math>\n\n<math>\ne^{x/y} = 1+\\cfrac{2x} {2y-x+\\cfrac{x^2} {6y+\\cfrac{x^2} {10y+\\cfrac{x^2} {14y+\\cfrac{x^2} {18y+\\ddots}}}}};\\;\ne^2 = 7+\\cfrac{2} {5+\\cfrac{1} {7+\\cfrac{1} {9+\\cfrac{1} {11+\\ddots}}}}\n</math>\n\n<math>\n\\log \\left( 1+\\frac{x}{y} \\right) = \\cfrac{x} {y+\\cfrac{1x} {2+\\cfrac{1x} {3y+\\cfrac{2x} {2+\\cfrac{2x} {5y+\\cfrac{3x} {2+\\ddots}}}}}} \n= \\cfrac{2x} {2y+x-\\cfrac{(1x)^2} {3(2y+x)-\\cfrac{(2x)^2} {5(2y+x)-\\cfrac{(3x)^2} {7(2y+x)-\\ddots}}}}\n</math>\n\nThis last is based on an algorithm derived by Alekse\u012d Nikolaevich Khovanski\u012d in the 1970s.<ref>[https://math.stackexchange.com/q/75074 An alternative way to calculate log(x)]</ref>\n\nExample: the [[natural logarithm of 2]] (= [0;1,2,3,1,5,2/3,7,1/2,9,2/5,...,2k-1,2/k,...] \u2248 0.693147...):<ref>[http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EMIS/journals/EM/expmath/volumes/13/13.3/BorweinCrandallFee.pdf On the Ramanujan AGM Fraction, I: The Real-Parameter Case.

This is because the ''folded'' GCF ''folds'' each pair of fractions from the ''unfolded'' GCF into one fraction, thus doubling the convergence pace.

For example, there is a close relationship between the simple continued fraction in canonical form for the irrational real number \u03b1, and the way [[lattice point]]s in two dimensions lie to either side of the line ''y'' = \u03b1''x''. Generalizing this idea, one might ask about something related to lattice points in three or more dimensions. One reason to study this area is to quantify the [[mathematical coincidence]] idea; for example, for [[monomial]]s in several real numbers, take the [[logarithmic form]] and consider how small it can be.  Another reason is to find a possible solution to [[Hermite's problem]].\n\nThere have been numerous attempts to construct a generalized theory. Notable efforts in this direction were made by [[Felix Klein]] (the [[Klein polyhedron]]), [[Georges Poitou]] and [[George Szekeres]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gauss's continued fraction]]\n* [[Pad\u00e9 table]]\n* [[Solving quadratic equations with continued fractions]]\n* [[Convergence problem]]\n* [[Infinite compositions of analytic functions]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation | last1=Jones | first1=William B. | last2=Thron | first2=W.J. | title=Continued fractions.
