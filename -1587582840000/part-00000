After making 58 appearances for the club, he moved to German [[Bundesliga]] side [[Dynamo Dresden]] in 1994, appearing twice, and then to Bundesliga side [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]] in 1995, appearing four times. Schwarzer joined then-second tier side [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] in 1996 and made 16 appearances before joining [[Premier League]] club [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in February 1997. He made 445 appearances for Middlesbrough, but decided to leave the club in May 2008. He then switched to Premier League side [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], and made 218 appearances for the club until he moved to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2013. He was the first \u2013 and, to date, only \u2013 non-Brit to have made more than 500 Premier League appearances (making him the highest-appearing non-Brit in the Premier League's history), and also the oldest player to have played in the knockout stages of the [[UEFA Champions League]]. He joined [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] on a free transfer in January 2015 and left the club at the end of their [[2015\u201316 Leicester City F.C. season|2015\u201316 Premier League-winning season]].\n\nHaving played for Australia at [[Australia national under-17 soccer team|under-17]] and [[Australia national under-20 soccer team|under-20]] level, Schwarzer made his full international debut in a World Cup qualifying match against [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] in 1993 as a substitute after [[Robert Zabica]] was sent off in the 17th minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/canada-v-australia-31-july-1993-244575/|title=Canada v Australia, 31 July 1993|publisher=}}</ref> During the course of his international career, he won a total of 109 [[cap (association football)|caps]] for his country. He became Australia's most capped player when he surpassed [[Alex Tobin]]'s appearance record in January 2011.\n\n==Personal life==\nSchwarzer was born in North Richmond, a semi-rural suburb in north-western Sydney, and attended Richmond North Public School and Colo High School. He played for the local [[Association football|soccer]] club the Colo Cougars.

It officially separated from [[Lynn, Massachusetts|Lynn]] and incorporated as Reading in 1644 when the first church (First Parish Congregational Church) and the first mill were established. This first corn mill was built on the Mill River on Water Street, and later small saw mills were built on  the Mill River and the [[Saugus River]].\n\nThe old parish church became known  as the Old or South Parish when in 1713 the North Parish was established. This North Parish later became  the town of [[North Reading, Massachusetts|North Reading]]. In 1769 the West Parish was established.  In 1812 the Old or South Parish of Reading separated from [[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]] and was officially  incorporated as South Reading. At the time it was spelled ''South Redding'', not ''South Reading''.\n\nThe  railroad  was chartered and built in 1844 between [[Wilmington, Massachusetts|Wilmington]] and [[Boston]]. This later became the main line of the [[Boston and Maine Railroad]]. The Boston and Maine Foundry was built in 1854 and was later reincorporated  as the Smith and Anthony Stove Company. The Boston Ice Company cut and shipped ice from [[Lake Quannapowitt]] starting in 1851.\n\nThe Rattan Works (which made wicker furniture) was established in 1856 by [[Cyrus Wakefield]]. This later grew into the [[Wakefield Rattan Company]] and at one time had a thousand employees.  In 1868 Cyrus Wakefield donated land and  money for a new town hall, and in thanks the town voted to change its name from South Reading to Wakefield.  The town hall, currently named for William J. Lee,<ref>[http://wakefield.patch.com/listings/william-j-lee-memorial-town-hall William J.

In 1923, the [[Lucius Beebe Memorial Library]] was built and established by Junius Beebe, the son of Lucius Beebe (1810\u20131884).<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Library & Lucius Beebe|url=http://www.wakefieldlibrary.org/about/about-the-library\u2013/#Lucius-Beebe|website=Lucius Beebe Memorial Library}}</ref>\n\nThe first weekly newspaper in Wakefield was established in 1858.\n\nOne of the oldest and largest manufacturers of flying [[model airplane]] toys in the world, [[Paul K. Guillow, Inc.]] is located in Wakefield. The company is particularly notable for its extensive line of [[balsa wood]] model airplane kits.\n\n[[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] was built along the north edge of the town by 1958, and the American Mutual Insurance Company built its headquarters between Lake Quannapowitt and Route 128. American Mutual had over 1000 employees, most of them commuting to work via Route 128. By the late 1980s American Mutual was in liquidation due to the [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]] [[W. R. Grace and Company|W. R. Grace]] litigation. The headquarters building was sold to the Beal Company and was home to Boston Technology Inc. which invented and manufactured corporate voice mail systems that operated on computer systems. Boston Technology merged in 1997 with [[Comverse Technology]], a digital telecommunications equipment manufacturer, which later bought the building; Wakefield became headquarters of its eventual spinoff, [[Comverse]].\n\n[[File:Lake Quannapowitt Panorama.jpg|thumb|300px|Panoramic view of [[Lake Quannapowitt]] from its eastern shore, looking westward&nbsp;\u2014 June 2016]]\n\nThe northeastern part of Wakefield was home to an amusement park, [[Pleasure Island (Massachusetts amusement park)|Pleasure Island]], billed as \"The Disneyland of the Northeast,\" but the park closed in 1969 after only ten years of operation<ref name=pleasure>[http://www.wakefieldhistory.org/pleasureisland.html Pleasure Island, Wakefield, Massachusetts: 1959\u20131969]</ref> due to unseasonably cold weather that brought diminishing returns among tourists.<ref name=pleasure />  In April 1971, a fire burned down much of the amusement park.

The 42-year-old gunman was an application supporter at Edgewater Technology.\n\nDuring his trial, he stated that he was born without a soul and that God had allowed him to earn a soul by traveling back in time to kill [[Nazi Party|Nazis]]. However, the prosecution asserted that the killings were motivated by his employer's [[garnishment|garnishing]] of his wages to the [[U.S. Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], as he failed to pay back taxes. He was found guilty of seven counts of [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees of murder in the United States|first degree murder]] and sentenced to seven consecutive life sentences without the possibility of [[parole]].\n\nIn 2008 this case was studied on the psychology program ''[[Most Evil]]''.\n\n==Geography==\n{{Geographic location|width=auto\n | Northwest = [[Image:Downtown Reading Massachusetts.jpg|60px]]\n\n[[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]]\n | North = [[Image:North Reading Common, MA.jpg|60px]]\n\n[[North Reading, Massachusetts|North Reading]]\n | Northeast = [[Image:Lynnfield Old Meeting House.JPG|60px]]\n\n[[Lynnfield, Massachusetts|Lynnfield]]\n | West = [[Image:I-93.svg|45px]]\n\n[[Interstate 93#Massachusetts|I\u201393]]\n | Centre = [[Image:Wakefield common.jpg|40px]]<br />Wakefield\n | East = [[Image:BreakheartReservationLowerPondView.jpg|60px]]\n\n[[Breakheart Reservation]]\n | Southwest = [[Image:Stoneham-welcome-sign.jpg|100px]]\n\n[[Stoneham, Massachusetts|Stoneham]]\n | South = [[Image:Melrose city hall.JPG|60px]]\n\n'''''[[Melrose, Massachusetts|Melrose]]'''''\n | Southeast = [[Image:Saugus Town Hall.jpg|60px]]\n\n'''''[[Saugus, Massachusetts|Saugus]]'''''\n}}\n{{noprint|<center><small>The diagram above shows what is to the east, west, north, south, and other directions of the center of Wakefield.

Lake Quannapowitt, meanwhile, is used for a wide variety of recreational activities, including boating, windsurfing, kayaking, and fishing, and is the primary source of the Saugus River.\n\nIn 1847, Lake Quannapowitt was named for the Native American James Quannapowitt, one of the signers of the old [[Aboriginal title in the United States|Indian Deed]] of 1686. The earliest settlers referred to the lake simply as the \"Greate Pond\" or \"Reading Pond.\"\n<!-- picture start -->[[Image:Lake Quannapowitt.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Lake Quannapowitt]], seen here, is the larger of Wakefield's two principal lakes, the other being Crystal Lake.]]<!-- picture end -->\nLake Quannapowitt is also home to the oldest inland yacht club in the United States, Quannapowitt Yacht Club, which was founded in 1886.\n\nLong regarded as \"Wakefield's greatest natural resource,\" [[Lake Quannapowitt]] covers an area of {{convert|247|acre|km2}}. Its outlet is the [[Saugus River]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. [[Common District (Wakefield, Massachusetts)|Wakefield Common]] sits to the south of the lake, and is the site of many recreational activities and events throughout the year. In 1991, a group of local citizens formed \"The Friends of Lake Quannapowitt\" to advocate for the lake and to educate the public about this natural resource.

It officially separated from [[Lynn, Massachusetts|Lynn]] and incorporated as Reading in 1644 when the first church (First Parish Congregational Church) and the first mill were established. This first corn mill was built on the Mill River on Water Street, and later small saw mills were built on  the Mill River and the [[Saugus River]].\n\nThe old parish church became known  as the Old or South Parish when in 1713 the North Parish was established. This North Parish later became  the town of [[North Reading, Massachusetts|North Reading]]. In 1769 the West Parish was established.  In 1812 the Old or South Parish of Reading separated from [[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]] and was officially  incorporated as South Reading. At the time it was spelled ''South Redding'', not ''South Reading''.\n\nThe  railroad  was chartered and built in 1844 between [[Wilmington, Massachusetts|Wilmington]] and [[Boston]]. This later became the main line of the [[Boston and Maine Railroad]]. The Boston and Maine Foundry was built in 1854 and was later reincorporated  as the Smith and Anthony Stove Company. The Boston Ice Company cut and shipped ice from [[Lake Quannapowitt]] starting in 1851.\n\nThe Rattan Works (which made wicker furniture) was established in 1856 by [[Cyrus Wakefield]]. This later grew into the [[Wakefield Rattan Company]] and at one time had a thousand employees.  In 1868 Cyrus Wakefield donated land and  money for a new town hall, and in thanks the town voted to change its name from South Reading to Wakefield.  The town hall, currently named for William J.

The company is particularly notable for its extensive line of [[balsa wood]] model airplane kits.\n\n[[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] was built along the north edge of the town by 1958, and the American Mutual Insurance Company built its headquarters between Lake Quannapowitt and Route 128. American Mutual had over 1000 employees, most of them commuting to work via Route 128. By the late 1980s American Mutual was in liquidation due to the [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]] [[W. R. Grace and Company|W. R. Grace]] litigation. The headquarters building was sold to the Beal Company and was home to Boston Technology Inc. which invented and manufactured corporate voice mail systems that operated on computer systems. Boston Technology merged in 1997 with [[Comverse Technology]], a digital telecommunications equipment manufacturer, which later bought the building; Wakefield became headquarters of its eventual spinoff, [[Comverse]].\n\n[[File:Lake Quannapowitt Panorama.jpg|thumb|300px|Panoramic view of [[Lake Quannapowitt]] from its eastern shore, looking westward&nbsp;\u2014 June 2016]]\n\nThe northeastern part of Wakefield was home to an amusement park, [[Pleasure Island (Massachusetts amusement park)|Pleasure Island]], billed as \"The Disneyland of the Northeast,\" but the park closed in 1969 after only ten years of operation<ref name=pleasure>[http://www.wakefieldhistory.org/pleasureisland.html Pleasure Island, Wakefield, Massachusetts: 1959\u20131969]</ref> due to unseasonably cold weather that brought diminishing returns among tourists.<ref name=pleasure />  In April 1971, a fire burned down much of the amusement park.

However, the prosecution asserted that the killings were motivated by his employer's [[garnishment|garnishing]] of his wages to the [[U.S. Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], as he failed to pay back taxes.

Lake Quannapowitt, meanwhile, is used for a wide variety of recreational activities, including boating, windsurfing, kayaking, and fishing, and is the primary source of the Saugus River.\n\nIn 1847, Lake Quannapowitt was named for the Native American James Quannapowitt, one of the signers of the old [[Aboriginal title in the United States|Indian Deed]] of 1686. The earliest settlers referred to the lake simply as the \"Greate Pond\" or \"Reading Pond.\"\n<!-- picture start -->[[Image:Lake Quannapowitt.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Lake Quannapowitt]], seen here, is the larger of Wakefield's two principal lakes, the other being Crystal Lake.]]<!-- picture end -->\nLake Quannapowitt is also home to the oldest inland yacht club in the United States, Quannapowitt Yacht Club, which was founded in 1886.\n\nLong regarded as \"Wakefield's greatest natural resource,\" [[Lake Quannapowitt]] covers an area of {{convert|247|acre|km2}}. Its outlet is the [[Saugus River]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. [[Common District (Wakefield, Massachusetts)|Wakefield Common]] sits to the south of the lake, and is the site of many recreational activities and events throughout the year. In 1991, a group of local citizens formed \"The Friends of Lake Quannapowitt\" to advocate for the lake and to educate the public about this natural resource.
