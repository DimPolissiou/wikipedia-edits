The turnover of the business had increased from \u00a32,700 in 1841 to \u00a3125,000 in 1857. He was later joined by his son, [[George William Palmer (England)|George William Palmer]].{{sfn|Courtney|1901}}  Two other sons of George and four of his nephews, sons of Samuel, later became partners in the business. By the time of his death in 1897, the business had an annual turnover of more than \u00a31.25 million, selling around 23,000 tons of biscuits each year.  The company claimed to be the largest manufacturer of biscuit in the world.\n\n==Politics==\nIn addition to his business career, George Palmer was involved in politics.  He served in the local council in Reading from 1850, was as [[mayor of Reading]] in 1857\u201358, and represented the town in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]].  He served as [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament]] for the [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Parliamentary Borough of Reading]] from 1878 until 1885, when the two-member seat was reduced to one member.  Palmer stood as a candidate for the new constituency of [[Newbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Newbury]] in 1885, one of three created from the former county seat of [[Berkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Berkshire]], but he was not elected.  His son George William Palmer was twice elected to represent Reading, serving from 1892 to 1895 and from 1898 to 1904.\n\nPalmer's country estate was [[Brockhurst and Marlston House School|Marlston House]] in [[Bucklebury]].

One daughter Emily married the [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]], whilst his daughter Alice married the [[Physiology|physiologist]] [[Augustus Desir\u00e9 Waller|Augustus Desire Wallace]].\n\nHis wife died in 1894, and he died of a stroke at home three years later.\n\n==Business==\nPalmer went into business with a cousin Thomas Huntley in 1841, after Thomas's father [[Joseph Huntley]], the founder of the business in 1822, was forced to retire through ill-health, and it became apparent that Thomas Huntley did not have his father's good sense of business.<ref>Reading History Trail. ''[http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/radstock/rht/themes/manufacture/handp.html Huntley and Palmers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117130121/http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/radstock/rht/themes/manufacture/handp.html |date=17 January 2010 }}'', Retrieved 30 January 2006</ref> The firm was renamed Huntley & Palmers.\n\nWhilst it was Joseph Huntley's innovation in the introduction of the [[biscuit tin]] and in the sale of biscuits to [[stage coach]] travellers that created the business, George Palmer is generally credited with making it a major [[Victorian era|Victorian]] success through industrial manufacturing techniques, and by using the [[rail transport|railway]]s for distribution.{{sfn|Courtney|1901}}  With the engineer [[William Exall]], Palmer invented new machinery to manufacture biscuits on an industrial scale.\n\nWhen Thomas Huntley died, in 1857, George Palmer was joined in the business by two brothers, [[William Isaac Palmer]] and [[Samuel Palmer (businessman)|Samuel Palmer]].  The turnover of the business had increased from \u00a32,700 in 1841 to \u00a3125,000 in 1857. He was later joined by his son, [[George William Palmer (England)|George William Palmer]].{{sfn|Courtney|1901}}  Two other sons of George and four of his nephews, sons of Samuel, later became partners in the business. By the time of his death in 1897, the business had an annual turnover of more than \u00a31.25 million, selling around 23,000 tons of biscuits each year.  The company claimed to be the largest manufacturer of biscuit in the world.\n\n==Politics==\nIn addition to his business career, George Palmer was involved in politics.  He served in the local council in Reading from 1850, was as [[mayor of Reading]] in 1857-58, and represented the town in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]].  He served as [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament]] for the [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Parliamentary Borough of Reading]] from 1878 until 1885, when the two-member seat was reduced to one member.  Palmer stood as a candidate for the new constituency of [[Newbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Newbury]] in 1885, one of three created from the former county seat of [[Berkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Berkshire]], but he was not elected.  His son George William Palmer was twice elected to represent Reading, serving from 1892 to 1895 and from 1898 to 1904.\n\nPalmer's country estate was [[Brockhurst and Marlston House School|Marlston House]] in [[Bucklebury]].  He donated the 49 acres of land to Reading which became [[Palmer Park, Reading|Palmer Park]].\n\n==Statue==\n{{Details|Statue of George Palmer}}\n[[File:The statue of George Palmer, Broad Street, Reading, c. 1890.jpg|thumb|The statue of Palmer in [[Broad Street, Reading|Broad Street]], c. 1890 by [[Henry Taunt]]]]\nThe statue of George Palmer which now stands in Palmer Park was by sculptor [[George Blackall Simonds]] and originally sited in [[Broad Street, Reading|Broad Street]]. It was unveiled in 1891, the same day that [[Palmer Park, Reading|Palmer Park]] opened.  The same year, Palmer was given the freedom of Reading, and declined the offer of a baronetcy.  The statue was moved ''c.'' 1930 to its current location as it caused traffic congestion.<ref>Statue of George Palmer, Reading.

It was formed on 1 January 2002 after the [[Partition of Midnapore]] into Paschim Medinipur and [[Purba Medinipur]]. On 4 April 2017, the Jhargram subdivision was converted into a district.\n\n==Geography==\n===Overview===\nPaschim Medinipur, located in the south-western part of West Bengal, was created with the partition of the erstwhile [[Midnapore district]], then the largest district of India, on 1 January 2002. It ranks second in terms of geographical area (9,295.28 &nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) amongst the districts of the state, next to South 24-Parganas (9,960 &nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). It ranks third in terms of rural population (4.58&nbsp;million) following South 24-Parganas (5.82&nbsp;million) and Murshidabad (5.13&nbsp;million). It ranked fourth in terms of percentage of tribal population (14.87) following Jalpaiguri (18.87), Purulia (18.27) and Dakshin Dinajpur (16.12) in 2011.<ref name=\"geography\">{{cite web| url = http://wbplan.gov.in/HumanDev/DHDR/DHDR_Paschim%20Medinipur.pdf  |title =  District Human Development Report: Paschim Medinipur |work= Chapter I Introduction and Human Development Indices for Paschim Mednipur |publisher= Development and Planning Department, Government of West Bengal, 2011  | accessdate = 25 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two natural divisions of the district. [[National Highway 14 (India)|NH 14]] and [[National Highway 16 (India)|NH 16]] (old numbering [[National Highway 60 (India)(old numbering)|NH 60]]) from Bankura to Balasore, cuts across the district and roughly is the dividing line between the two natural divisions. To the east of this road, the soil is fertile alluvial and the area is flat. To the west, the [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]] gradually slopes down creating an undulating area with infertile laterite rocks and soil. The landscape changes from dense dry deciduous forests in the west to marshy wetlands in the east.<ref name=\"geography\"/>\n\nThe alluvial portion may be further subdivided into two divisions. First, it is a strip of purely deltaic country nearer to the Hooghly and the Rupnarayan, intersected by numerous rivers and watercourses subject to tidal influences. Second, it is rest of the eastern half of the district. It is a monotonous rice plain with numerous waterways and tidal creeks intersecting it. The tidal creeks are lined with embankments to prevent flooding of the fields. Much of the area is water-logged.<ref name=\"geography\"/>\n\n===Floods and drought===\nPaschim Medinipur district is subject to both [[flood]]s and [[drought]]. Ghatal and parts of Kharagpur subdivision covering an area of {{convert|142647| ha| km2}} are flood prone. Water logging during the rainy season affects Ghatal and the southern parts of Kharagpur subdivion and results in loss of crops in such areas as Sabang, Pingla and Narayangarh CD Blocks.{{convert|335248| ha|km2}} Medinipur Sadar subdivision is drought prone. Although the district is away from the sea, cyclones hit it frequently in October\u2013November.<ref name=\"geography\"/>\n\n===Major cities and towns===\n[[Midnapore]] is the district headquarters. [[Kharagpur]] is the largest city in the district. Other important towns and cities in the district include: [[Kharagpur]], [[Ghatal]], [[Belda]], [[Chandrakona]], [[Ramjibanpur]], [[Garbeta]], [[Balichak]], [[Dantan]], [[Mohanpur (community development block)|Mohanpur]], [[Keshiari]], [[Keshpur]], [[Narayangarh (community development block)|Narayangarh]], [[Sabang (community development block)|Sabang]], [[Daspur]].\n\n===Villages===\nPaschim Medinipur district is home to the most villages of any district in India. The 2011 census lists Paschim Medinipur as having 8,694 villages, of which 7,600 are populated, and 1,094 are uninhabited. The district with the next highest number of villages, [[Mayurbhanj]], in the state of [[Odisha]], has 3,950 villages, 3,751 of which are inhabited.\n\n==Economy and politics==\nIn 2006 the [[Ministry of Panchayati Raj]] named Paschim Medinipur one of the country's 250 [[Poverty in India|most backward districts]] (out of a total of [[Districts of India|640]]).<ref name=brgf/> It is one of the eleven districts in West Bengal currently receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF).<ref name=brgf>{{cite web|author=Ministry of Panchayati Raj|date=8 September 2009|title=A Note on the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme|publisher=National Institute of Rural Development|url=http://www.nird.org.in/brgf/doc/brgf_BackgroundNote.pdf|accessdate=27 September 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405033402/http://www.nird.org.in/brgf/doc/brgf_BackgroundNote.pdf|archivedate=5 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n106 districts spanning 10 states across India, described as being part of [[Far-left politics|Left Wing Extremism]] activities, constitute the [[Red corridor]].

Bengal]], [[India]]. It was formed on 1 January 2002 after the [[Partition of Midnapore]] into Paschim Medinipur and [[Purba Medinipur]]. On 4 April 2017, the Jhargram subdivision was converted into a district.\n\n==Geography==\n===Overview===\nPaschim Medinipur, located in the south-western part of West Bengal, was created with the partition of the erstwhile [[Midnapore district]], then the largest district of India, on 1 January 2002. It ranks second in terms of geographical area (9,295.28 &nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) amongst the districts of the state, next to South 24-Parganas (9,960 &nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). It ranks third in terms of rural population (4.58&nbsp;million) following South 24-Parganas (5.82&nbsp;million) and Murshidabad (5.13&nbsp;million). It ranked fourth in terms of percentage of tribal population (14.87) following Jalpaiguri (18.87), Purulia (18.27) and Dakshin Dinajpur (16.12) in 2011.<ref name=\"geography\">{{cite web| url = http://wbplan.gov.in/HumanDev/DHDR/DHDR_Paschim%20Medinipur.pdf  |title =  District Human Development Report: Paschim Medinipur |work= Chapter I Introduction and Human Development Indices for Paschim Mednipur |publisher= Development and Planning Department, Government of West Bengal, 2011  | accessdate = 25 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two natural divisions of the district. [[National Highway 14 (India)|NH 14]] and [[National Highway 16 (India)|NH 16]] (old numbering [[National Highway 60 (India)(old numbering)|NH 60]]) from Bankura to Balasore, cuts across the district and roughly is the dividing line between the two natural divisions. To the east of this road, the soil is fertile alluvial and the area is flat. To the west, the [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]] gradually slopes down creating an undulating area with infertile laterite rocks and soil. The landscape changes from dense dry deciduous forests in the west to marshy wetlands in the east.<ref name=\"geography\"/>\n\nThe alluvial portion may be further subdivided into two divisions. First, it is a strip of purely deltaic country nearer to the Hooghly and the Rupnarayan, intersected by numerous rivers and watercourses subject to tidal influences. Second, it is rest of the eastern half of the district. It is a monotonous rice plain with numerous waterways and tidal creeks intersecting it. The tidal creeks are lined with embankments to prevent flooding of the fields. Much of the area is water-logged.<ref name=\"geography\"/>\n\n===Floods and drought===\nPaschim Medinipur district is subject to both [[flood]]s and [[drought]]. Ghatal and parts of Kharagpur subdivision covering an area of {{convert|142647| ha| km2}} are flood prone. Water logging during the rainy season affects Ghatal and the southern parts of Kharagpur subdivion and results in loss of crops in such areas as Sabang, Pingla and Narayangarh CD Blocks.{{convert|335248| ha|km2}} Medinipur Sadar subdivision is drought prone. Although the district is away from the sea, cyclones hit it frequently in October\u2013November.<ref name=\"geography\"/>\n\n===Major cities and towns===\n[[Midnapore]] is the district headquarters. [[Kharagpur]] is the largest city in the district. Other important towns and cities in the district include: [[Kharagpur]], [[Ghatal]], [[Belda]], [[Chandrakona]], [[Ramjibanpur]], [[Garbeta]], [[Balichak]], [[Dantan]], [[Mohanpur (community development block)|Mohanpur]], [[Keshiari]], [[Keshpur]], [[Narayangarh (community development block)|Narayangarh]], [[Sabang (community development block)|Sabang]], [[Daspur]].\n\n===Villages===\nPaschim Medinipur district is home to the most villages of any district in India. The 2011 census lists Paschim Medinipur as having 8,694 villages, of which 7,600 are populated, and 1,094 are uninhabited. The district with the next highest number of villages, [[Mayurbhanj]], in the state of [[Odisha]], has 3,950 villages, 3,751 of which are inhabited.\n\n==Economy and politics==\nIn 2006 the [[Ministry of Panchayati Raj]] named Paschim Medinipur one of the country's 250 [[Poverty in India|most backward districts]] (out of a total of [[Districts of India|640]]).<ref name=brgf/> It is one of the eleven districts in West Bengal currently receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF).<ref name=brgf>{{cite web|author=Ministry of Panchayati Raj|date=8 September 2009|title=A Note on the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme|publisher=National Institute of Rural Development|url=http://www.nird.org.in/brgf/doc/brgf_BackgroundNote.pdf|accessdate=27 September 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405033402/http://www.nird.org.in/brgf/doc/brgf_BackgroundNote.pdf|archivedate=5 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n106 districts spanning 10 states across India, described as being part of [[Far-left politics|Left Wing Extremism]] activities, constitute the [[Red corridor]]. In West Bengal the districts of Paschim Medinipur, Bankura, Purulia and Birbhum are part of the Red corridor.
