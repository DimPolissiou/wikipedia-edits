It originated as a shoe store, and evolved into a full-line retailer with departments for clothing, footwear, handbags, jewelry, accessories, cosmetics, and fragrances. Some stores feature home furnishings and wedding departments, and several have in-house cafes, restaurants, and espresso bars.\n\nAs of 2020, Nordstrom operates 117 stores in 40 [[U.S. state]]s, three [[Canadian province]]s, and [[Puerto Rico]]. The corporate headquarters and flagship store are located in the former [[Frederick & Nelson]] building in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]; a second flagship store is located near [[Columbus Circle]] in [[New York City]]. Its subsidiaries include the [[off-price]] department store chain [[Nordstrom Rack]] and the members-only online store [[HauteLook]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nJohn W.
