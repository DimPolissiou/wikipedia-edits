He focuses on the rise in presidential fundraising and the targeting of key electoral states throughout a president's term in office \u2013 illustrating that recent presidents have disproportionately visited those states that are important to their political prospects while largely neglecting those without electoral payoff.

{"title_page": "Rent strike", "text_new": "[[Image:Rent Strike, New York Times, 1919.JPG|thumb|Rent Strike, New York Times, 1919.]]\n\nA '''rent strike''' is a method of protest commonly employed against large [[landlord]]s. In a rent strike, a group of [[leasehold estate|tenant]]s come together and agree to refuse to pay their [[Renting|rent]] ''en masse'' until a specific list of demands is met by the landlord. This can be a useful tactic of final resort for use against intransigent landlords, but carries the obvious risk of [[eviction]] and bad [[credit history]] in some cases.\n\nHistorically, rent strikes have often been used in response to problems such as high rents, poor conditions in the property, or unreasonable tenancy demands; however, there have been situations where wider issues have led to such action.\n\n==Notable rent strikes==\n\n===Europe===\n\n'''[[Red Clydeside#Rent strikes|Glasgow]]'''\nDuring the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Land War]] of the 1880s and during [[World War I]] when the landlords of tenement buildings in [[Glasgow]] sought to take advantage of the influx of shipbuilders coming into the city and the absence of many local men to raise rents on the tenements' remaining residents. These women left behind were seen as an easy target and were faced with a rent increase of up to 25% and would be forcibly evicted by bailiffs if they failed to pay. As a result of this rent increase, there was a popular backlash against the landlords and a rent strike was initiated. This was led by [[Mary Barbour]], [[Mary Laird|Mary B. Laird]], [[Helen Crawfurd]], [[Agnes Dollan]], and other women who were dubbed 'Mrs. Barbour's Army'. During rent strikes, women would forcibly prevent the bailiffs from entering the tenements to deliver eviction notices by pelting them with flour bombs, pulling down their trousers, or throwing them into the 'midden' (trash) in the back court of tenement buildings. The strikes soon spread and became an overwhelming success, moving out from Glasgow and on to other cities throughout the UK, that the government, on 27 November 1915, introduced legislation to restrict rents to the pre-war level.\n\n'''The Leeds rent strike in 1914''' \nIn early January 1914, around 300 tenants living in the Burley area of Leeds went on rent strike against a 6d increase in rents imposed by the landlords. The rent increase had been called for by the Leeds branch of the Property Owners Association. At a mass meeting of the tenants on Sunday January 10, the rent strike organisers called for a citywide protest against the increase. A week later, the [[Leeds Trades Council]] hosted a Labour conference intended to organise mass rent resistance. A Tenants Defence League was formed with a central committee of nine and a mission to spread the rent campaign across the city through a series of public meetings and neighbourhood canvassing.  The strike lasted eight weeks.  In the end, committee members had been evicted and blacklisted from renting any other home in the area.<ref>[http://freespace.virgin.net/labwise.history6/rentrick.htm The Leeds rent strike in 1914; A reappraisal of the radical history of the tenants movement, Quintin Bradley] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150124050824/http://freespace.virgin.net/labwise.history6/rentrick.htm |date=2015-01-24 }}</ref>\n\n'''[[Kirkby Rent Strike]]'''\nA 14-month-long rent strike initiated by 3,000 tenants on October 9, 1972 in the town of [[Kirkby]], outside [[Liverpool]], against the Housing Finances Act.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0anu9hlQ9iA |title=Behind Rent Strike 1970's \u2013 Full |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=April 16, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first=Jon |last=Murden |year=2006 |url=http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2006/Assets/MurdenAbstractIIIF.doc |format=DOC |title=The 1972 Kirkby Rent Strike: Dockland Solidarity in a New Setting? |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[Economic History Society]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925051552/http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2006/Assets/MurdenAbstractIIIF.doc |archivedate=2006-09-25 }}</ref> caused a \u00a31 rent rise.

In a rent strike, a group of [[leasehold estate|tenant]]s come together and agree to refuse to pay their [[Renting|rent]] ''en masse'' until a specific list of demands is met by the landlord. This can be a useful tactic of final resort for use against intransigent landlords, but carries the obvious risk of [[eviction]] and bad [[credit history]] in some cases.\n\nHistorically, rent strikes have often been used in response to problems such as high rents, poor conditions in the property, or unreasonable tenancy demands; however, there have been situations where wider issues have led to such action.\n\n==Notable rent strikes==\n\n===Europe===\n\n'''[[Red Clydeside#Rent strikes|Glasgow]]'''\nDuring the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Land War]] of the 1880s and during [[World War I]] when the landlords of tenement buildings in [[Glasgow]] sought to take advantage of the influx of shipbuilders coming into the city and the absence of many local men to raise rents on the tenements' remaining residents. These women left behind were seen as an easy target and were faced with a rent increase of up to 25% and would be forcibly evicted by bailiffs if they failed to pay. As a result of this rent increase, there was a popular backlash against the landlords and a rent strike was initiated. This was led by [[Mary Barbour]], [[Mary Laird|Mary B. Laird]], [[Helen Crawfurd]], [[Agnes Dollan]], and other women who were dubbed 'Mrs. Barbour's Army'. During rent strikes, women would forcibly prevent the bailiffs from entering the tenements to deliver eviction notices by pelting them with flour bombs, pulling down their trousers, or throwing them into the 'midden' (trash) in the back court of tenement buildings. The strikes soon spread and became an overwhelming success, moving out from Glasgow and on to other cities throughout the UK, that the government, on 27 November 1915, introduced legislation to restrict rents to the pre-war level.\n\n'''The Leeds rent strike in 1914''' \nIn early January 1914, around 300 tenants living in the Burley area of Leeds went on rent strike against a 6d increase in rents imposed by the landlords. The rent increase had been called for by the Leeds branch of the Property Owners Association. At a mass meeting of the tenants on Sunday January 10, the rent strike organisers called for a citywide protest against the increase. A week later, the [[Leeds Trades Council]] hosted a Labour conference intended to organise mass rent resistance. A Tenants Defence League was formed with a central committee of nine and a mission to spread the rent campaign across the city through a series of public meetings and neighbourhood canvassing.  The strike lasted eight weeks.  In the end, committee members had been evicted and blacklisted from renting any other home in the area.<ref>[http://freespace.virgin.net/labwise.history6/rentrick.htm The Leeds rent strike in 1914; A reappraisal of the radical history of the tenants movement, Quintin Bradley] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150124050824/http://freespace.virgin.net/labwise.history6/rentrick.htm |date=2015-01-24 }}</ref>\n\n'''[[Kirkby Rent Strike]]'''\nA 14-month-long rent strike initiated by 3,000 tenants on October 9, 1972 in the town of [[Kirkby]], outside [[Liverpool]], against the Housing Finances Act.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0anu9hlQ9iA |title=Behind Rent Strike 1970's \u2013 Full |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=April 16, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first=Jon |last=Murden |year=2006 |url=http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2006/Assets/MurdenAbstractIIIF.doc |format=DOC |title=The 1972 Kirkby Rent Strike: Dockland Solidarity in a New Setting? |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[Economic History Society]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925051552/http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2006/Assets/MurdenAbstractIIIF.doc |archivedate=2006-09-25 }}</ref> caused a \u00a31 rent rise.

For example, the patient may complete actions in incorrect orders, such as buttering bread before putting it in the toaster, or putting on shoes before putting on socks. There is also a loss of ability to voluntarily perform a learned task when given the necessary objects or tools.

He was listed as {{height|ft=5|in=11}} tall and 185&nbsp;lbs. After a successful career at [[Bradley-Bourbonnais Community High School]], Prince was drafted twice by the [[Atlanta Braves]]; with the 195th pick of the 1983 January draft, as part of that draft's 8th round, and with the 76th overall pick of that same year's June draft, as part of that draft's 4th round.<ref name=\"Tom Prince MLB Draft data\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thebaseballcube.com/draft/research.asp?Y=&R=&T=&School=&Player=Tom%20Prince |title=Tom Prince MLB Draft data |publisher=thebaseballcube.com |accessdate=29 March 2017 }}</ref> He elected not to sign both times, instead attending [[Kankakee Community College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=princto01|title=Tom Prince Stats|publisher= Baseball Almanac |accessdate= October 30, 2012}}</ref> There, he attracted the attention of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], who selected him with the 64th overall pick of the [[1984 Major League Baseball draft|1984 January draft]].<ref name=\"Tom Prince MLB Draft data\"/> This time, he signed the deal, and that summer began play with the Pirates' farm club in the [[Gulf Coast League]].<ref name=\"Tom Prince minor league statistics\">{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=prince001tho |title=Tom Prince minor league statistics |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=29 March 2017 }}</ref>\n\nPrince enjoyed a strong defensive reputation as a prospect, but his offensive production fluctuated wildly as he advanced through the system. With the [[Macon Pirates]] of the [[South Atlantic League]], he put up an unusually low .208 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], but hit for moderate power and drew 96 [[base on balls]] in only 360 [[at bats]].<ref name=\"Tom Prince minor league statistics\"/> Two years later at AA, he put up a .307 batting average with the [[Harrisburg Senators]] of the [[Eastern League (U.S. baseball)|Eastern League]].<ref name=\"Tom Prince minor league statistics\"/>\n\nAfter a promotion to the AAA [[Buffalo Bisons]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] the next year, his batting average dropped back down to .260 and his walk rate collapsed, but he started hitting for substantially more power, putting up a .451 [[slugging percentage]].<ref name=\"Tom Prince minor league statistics\"/> He was generally well regarded as a prospect, but talent evaluators weren't sure exactly which skills he would display after promotion to the majors.\n\nPrince ultimately settled in as a backup catcher, relying on solid defense to compensate for a weak bat.<ref name=\"Sustaining a Long Career\"/> He would never total even 200 at-bats in a single major league season, but he spent parts of seventeen years in the big leagues with the Pirates, [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[Philadelphia Phillies]], [[Minnesota Twins]], and [[Kansas City Royals]]. During that time, he caught for some of the best pitchers in baseball, including [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young]] winners [[Doug Drabek]] and [[Johan Santana]], and six-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] [[Curt Schilling]].\n\n==Career statistics==\nIn a seventeen-year major league career, Prince played in 519 [[Games played|games]], accumulating 248 [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] in 1,190 [[at bats]] for a .208 career batting average along with 24 [[home run]]s, 140 [[runs batted in]] and an [[on-base percentage]] of .286.<ref name=\"Tom Prince statistics\"/> He ended his career with a .992 [[fielding percentage]].<ref name=\"Tom Prince statistics\"/>\n\n==Post-playing career==\nAfter retiring as a player, Prince retained his connection with professional baseball.

|accessdate=8 December 2011 }}</ref> He played in [[Major League Baseball]] as an [[catcher]] from 1987 to 2003. Although Prince didn't produce impressive offensive statistics, he excelled defensively as a catcher which enabled him to sustain a seventeen-year playing career with several major league teams.<ref name=\"Sustaining a Long Career\">{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4i4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=sustaining+a+long+career+by+al+doyle&source=bl&ots=rxidgIn9sW&sig=OeHPmfNqVCwqzGz4b7hriYgIZkQ&hl=en&ei=V2ZzTNS0DoWClAfz8oW7AQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CCUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=sustaining%20a%20long%20career%20by%20al%20doyle&f=false |title=Sustaining a Long Career |author=Doyle, Al |publisher=Books.Google.com |date=November 2002 |work=Baseball Digest |accessdate=22 October 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Baseball career==\nPrimarily a [[catcher]] during his playing career, Prince batted and threw with his right hand.  He was listed as {{height|ft=5|in=11}} tall and 185&nbsp;lbs. After a successful career at [[Bradley-Bourbonnais Community High School]], Prince was drafted twice by the [[Atlanta Braves]]; with the 195th pick of the 1983 January draft, as part of that draft's 8th round, and with the 76th overall pick of that same year's June draft, as part of that draft's 4th round.<ref name=\"Tom Prince MLB Draft data\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thebaseballcube.com/draft/research.asp?Y=&R=&T=&School=&Player=Tom%20Prince |title=Tom Prince MLB Draft data |publisher=thebaseballcube.com |accessdate=29 March 2017 }}</ref> He elected not to sign both times, instead attending [[Kankakee Community College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=princto01|title=Tom Prince Stats|publisher= Baseball Almanac |accessdate= October 30, 2012}}</ref> There, he attracted the attention of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], who selected him with the 64th overall pick of the [[1984 Major League Baseball draft|1984 January draft]].<ref name=\"Tom Prince MLB Draft data\"/> This time, he signed the deal, and that summer began play with the Pirates' farm club in the [[Gulf Coast League]].<ref name=\"Tom Prince minor league statistics\">{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=prince001tho |title=Tom Prince minor league statistics |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=29 March 2017 }}</ref>\n\nPrince enjoyed a strong defensive reputation as a prospect, but his offensive production fluctuated wildly as he advanced through the system. With the [[Macon Pirates]] of the [[South Atlantic League]], he put up an unusually low .208 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], but hit for moderate power and drew 96 [[base on balls]] in only 360 [[at bats]].<ref name=\"Tom Prince minor league statistics\"/> Two years later at AA, he put up a .307 batting average with the [[Harrisburg Senators]] of the [[Eastern League (U.S. baseball)|Eastern League]].<ref name=\"Tom Prince minor league statistics\"/>\n\nAfter a promotion to the AAA [[Buffalo Bisons]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] the next year, his batting average dropped back down to .260 and his walk rate collapsed, but he started hitting for substantially more power, putting up a .451 [[slugging percentage]].<ref name=\"Tom Prince minor league statistics\"/> He was generally well regarded as a prospect, but talent evaluators weren't sure exactly which skills he would display after promotion to the majors.\n\nPrince ultimately settled in as a backup catcher, relying on solid defense to compensate for a weak bat.<ref name=\"Sustaining a Long Career\"/> He would never total even 200 at-bats in a single major league season, but he spent parts of seventeen years in the big leagues with the Pirates, [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[Philadelphia Phillies]], [[Minnesota Twins]], and [[Kansas City Royals]]. During that time, he caught for some of the best pitchers in baseball, including [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young]] winners [[Doug Drabek]] and [[Johan Santana]], and six-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] [[Curt Schilling]].\n\n==Career statistics==\nIn a seventeen-year major league career, Prince played in 519 [[Games played|games]], accumulating 248 [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] in 1,190 [[at bats]] for a .208 career batting average along with 24 [[home run]]s, 140 [[runs batted in]] and an [[on-base percentage]] of .286.<ref name=\"Tom Prince statistics\"/> He ended his career with a .992 [[fielding percentage]].<ref name=\"Tom Prince statistics\"/>\n\n==Post-playing career==\nAfter retiring as a player, Prince retained his connection with professional baseball.
