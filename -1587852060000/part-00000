{"title_page": "Missives (Scots law)", "text_new": "{{Scots law}}The missives of sale, in scots property law, are a series of formal letters between the two parties, the Buyer and the Seller, containing the contract of sale for the transfer of corporeal heritable property (land) in Scotland. The term 'land' includes buildings and other structures upon the land.<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012 s.113, ''meaning of land.''</ref>  The missives of sale form the first of three stages required to validly transfer ownership of land in Scotland. The three stages are: \n\n# The Contractual Stage (The Missives of Sale) \n# The Conveyancing Stage\n# The Registration Stage\n\n== The Missives of Sale ==\nThe first stage of a voluntary transfer is contractual in nature, where parties negotiate the formal contract of sale between the owner (the Seller) and the Buyer. In Scots law, this contract is known as a \"missive of sale\" and typically are a series of formal letters with each parties offers and qualifications (containing conditions needed to be complied by either party).

The [[Plantation house in the Southern United States|plantation house]] is a [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]]- and [[Italianate architecture|Italianate-styled]] [[mansion]] built by John Hampden Randolph in 1859, and is the largest extant [[antebellum architecture|antebellum]] plantation house in the South with {{convert|53000|sqft|m2}} of floor space.\n\n==Mansion and grounds==\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Nottoway Plantation House.jpg|thumb|left|250px|North Front of Nottoway]]\nJohn Randolph commissioned renowned architect [[Henry Howard (architect)|Henry Howard]] of [[New Orleans]] with the task of designing the grand mansion with the intention that no expense would be spared in the construction. Howard sited the three-story wooden frame house, that includes a one-story rusticated stucco-covered brick base on a concrete foundation, to face east towards the [[Mississippi River]]. The entrance facade is asymmetrically balanced with a projecting bedroom wing to the left side and a large curved bay with galleries on the right. The main five-bay structure, with a central projecting portico, emphasizes height rather than width with the main living areas on the second and third-stories both being {{convert|15.5|ft|m}} in height above the one-story basement, scored to appear as stone, and featuring an arched niche flanked with narrow [[Fenestration (architecture)|fenestrations]]. The galleries are embellished with custom ornamental iron railings made in New Orleans, capped with molded wooden handrails. Double curved [[granite]] staircases, installed by skilled mason, Newton Richards, rise to the second-story. These steps were built with the left side intended for ladies and the right side for gentlemen. The steps for the men can also be identified by the boot scraper at the bottom. The separate staircases were so that the men would not see the women's ankles beneath their skirts as they climbed, which was considered a severe breach of social [[etiquette]] at the time. The close spacing and angularity of the gallery's 22 square columns and their elongated capitals also emphasize the vertical qualities of the house. Above the capitals, small brackets branch out to carry a tall [[entablature]] decorated with [[modillions]], supporting a projecting [[cornice]] that nearly covers the hipped roof that is pierced with six chimneys. In the rear of the house is a two-story [[studio apartment|gar\u00e7onni\u00e8re]] wing where the Randolph sons resided.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nottoway Plantation|url=http://www.knowla.org/entry/1727/|publisher=Knowla.org|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of Nottoway was completed in 1859 at an estimated cost of $80,000; to prevent any duplicate homes being built, Randolph destroyed the architect's plans after completion.\n\n===Interiors===\n[[File:Nottoway Interior.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The White Ballroom]][[File:Nottoway Dining Room.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Dining Room]]\nNottoway has over an acre of floor space spread out over three floors, and a total of 64 rooms with 165 doors and 200 windows, most of which can also double as doors.  The house enjoyed 19th-century novelties such as a bathroom located on each floor with flushing toilets and hot and cold running water, gas lighting throughout the house and a complex servant call bell system. The principal rooms of the house are located on the second floor. The entrance hall runs the length of the house and is 12 feet wide and 40 feet long. Large [[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat crystal]] and brass chandeliers hang from the {{convert|15.5|ft|m}} high ceilings and the doors with hand-painted German Dresden porcelain doorknobs and matching keyhole covers, leading to the adjacent rooms are {{convert|11|ft|m}} tall. Above the doors and along the ceilings are plaster frieze moldings, with modillions interspersed with [[paterae]], that are made from mud, clay, horse hair and Spanish moss. To the right of the entrance hall is the most unusual, and reportedly John Randolph's most favorite room in the house, the White Ballroom. With [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns, hand-cast archways and an L-shaped extension into a curved bay, Randolph had it painted completely white, including the flooring, to show off the natural beauty of his seven daughters, six of whom would be married there. Featuring two fireplaces with hand-carved [[rococo]] white marble mantles, there is also an original mirror placed so that the women could see if their ankles or [[Hoop skirt|hoops]] were showing beneath their skirts. Over one of the fireplaces, there is a painting of Mary Henshaw (no relation to the family), whose eyes are said to follow the viewer around the room. Flanking the entrance hall to the left is a gentleman's study, a stair hall and the formal dining room. Both the study and the dining room feature black Italian hand-carved marble mantles on their coal burning fireplaces, and the rooms are filled with period antique furniture. The dining room plasterwork showcases pink camellias, Emily Randolph's favorite flower, and is the only plasterwork in the house to have color.\n\nThe main staircase of Honduran mahogany is covered in green velvet and ascends to the Ancestral Hall on the third-floor. The hall was used by the Randolphs as a family parlor, being a central thoroughfare to many of the adjacent bedrooms, and gave access to the third-floor gallery with views of the Mississippi River. Nearby, is the master bedroom, with one of the three original bathrooms, as well as a small room that was used as a [[Nursery (room)|nursery]] for Julia Marceline, the Randolph's last and only child born at Nottoway. During the Civil War, Emily Randolph utilized a bedpost at the end of the bed to hide valuable jewelry. Though originally bedrooms, one has been made into a music room displaying musical instruments from the 19th-century, and another known as the Wicker Room features wicker furniture originally owned by the Randolph family.\n\nThe first floor basement has been transformed into a restaurant and a small museum about the Randolph family, and the history of the plantation. Originally the space held the laundry, dairy, wine cellar and servants quarters, as well as a 10-pin bowling alley for the amusement of the children.\n\n===Grounds===\nThe landscape for Nottoway was designed by John Nelson of New Orleans whose plan included 120 fruit and citrus trees, 12 magnolia trees, poplar and live oak trees, 75 rose bushes, 150 strawberry plants and a variety of flower and vegetable gardens. However, due to neglect and the erosion of six and a half acres of land by the Mississippi River, the gardens designed by Nelson no longer exist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nottoway's Architectural History|url=https://nottowayplantation.wordpress.com/|publisher=Nottoway Plantation's Blog|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}</ref> Today, the house sits only 200 feet behind a river levee and the grounds include a small formal hedge garden adjacent to the gar\u00e7onni\u00e8re where the detached kitchen once stood, and a fountain courtyard in front of the southern bedroom wing. Surrounding the house are modern ancillary buildings that house offices and event facilities. The owners expanded the property in 2008 by building a carriage house, ballroom and nine Acadian-style cottages modeled after the property's original slave quarters, while the plantation was closed to the public for repairs, as a result of damage incurred by [[Hurricane Gustav]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic Louisiana plantation to be auctioned|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/02/historic-louisiana-plantation-to-be-auctioned/|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref> To the north of the house is the reconstructed stables, now re-purposed as a ballroom, and the Randolph cemetery where the remains of the family were reinterred in 2003.\n\n==History==\n\n===19th century===\nJohn Hampden Randolph was born in [[Virginia]] in 1813, a member of the prominent [[Randolph family of Virginia|Randolph family]]. He migrated with his family to Mississippi when his father, [[Peter Randolph|Peter Randolph Jr.]], was appointed a federal judge in [[Woodville, Mississippi]], by [[James Monroe|President James Monroe]] in 1820.\n\nJohn Randolph married Emily Jane Liddell in 1837 and went on to have eleven children with her. Randolph devoted most of his time to his [[cotton]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]], but believing sugar production would be more lucrative he decided to move his family to southern Louisiana in 1842 where he purchased a {{convert|1650|acre|km2}} cotton plantation that he named Forest Home. Converting the plantation to [[sugar cane]] production two years later and constructing [[Iberville Parish, Louisiana|Iberville Parish's]] first [[steam engine|steam-powered]] [[sugar cane mill|sugar mill]], he was able to triple his earnings over his cotton production. Within ten years he had increased his holdings to {{convert|7116|acre|km2}} and owned 176 [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved people]] making Randolph one of the larger slaveholders in the South. In 1855 he purchased an additional {{convert|400|acre|km2}} of highland, and {{convert|620|acre|km2}} of [[swamp]] and Mississippi River-front land where he sought to build a more prestigious home that he named \"Nottoway\", after [[Nottoway County, Virginia|Nottoway County]] in the part of Virginia where he was born.\n\n[[File:Nottoway Plantation-022.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Painting by Cornelia Randolph showing original garden landscape]]\nHe selected Henry Howard, a very popular architect of the time, considered to have been one of the finest architects of 19th-century [[New Orleans]]. Many of his Greek Revival and Italianate style buildings, churches, and homes can still be found in the city.  He also designed the neighboring [[Belle Grove Plantation (Iberville Parish, Louisiana)|Belle Grove]], now destroyed.  Randolph and the owner of Belle Grove, John Andrews, are known to have had a rivalry of sorts that even extended to their homes.<ref name=\"lostplan\">{{cite book |title=Lost Plantations of the South |last=Matrana |first=Marc R. |year=2009 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson, MS |isbn=978-1-57806-942-2 |pages=184\u2013192 }}</ref> Compiling the materials for his [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantation home]], cypress logs were cut and cured under water for six years, then cut into planks and dried into what is called virgin cypress. The wood's most notable feature is not its durability, but its resistance to termites. Handmade bricks were baked in kilns by enslaved workers and 40 carpenters, brick masons and plumbers were hired by Howard, who lived in tents at the site of construction while doing their work.

Randolph did not support secession from the Union, but once the war began, backed the war financially and sent his three sons to fight for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], losing his oldest son, Algernon Sidney Randolph, at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]]. With the war coming ever closer to Nottoway, it was decided that Randolph would take 200 enslaved people to [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]], and grow cotton there while his wife, Emily, stayed at Nottoway with the youngest children, hoping that their presence would save it from destruction. The plantation was occupied by both [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and Confederate troops and though the grounds were damaged and the animals taken, Nottoway survived the war with only a single [[grapeshot]] to the far left column that did not fall out until 1971.\n\nWith the [[Emancipation Proclamation|emancipation]] of the slaves, John Randolph contracted with 53 of his former bond people to continue working as laborers.

The sugar business was not as profitable after the war and by 1875, Nottoway was reduced to {{convert|800|acre|km2}}. John Randolph died at Nottoway on September 8, 1883, leaving the plantation to his wife.\n\nEmily Randolph sold the plantation in 1889 for [[$]]50,000, which she divided equally among her nine surviving children and herself.

Soon after, Hanlon lost Nottoway to foreclosure in 1913 due to crop failures the previous two years that resulted in tax problems and accrued medical bills by his wife's failing health. Dr. Whyte G. Owen purchased the plantation out of foreclosure in the amount of $10,000.\n\nDr. Owen, one-time Surgeon General of Louisiana, attempted to run the estate as a sugar plantation, but was not successful.  He sold off {{convert|1193|acre|ha}}, keeping the house and surrounding property. After his death in 1949, Nottoway was inherited by his son Stanford who lived with his wife Odessa in the house until his death in 1974. Thereafter, Odessa Owen lived alone in the massive house, trying to maintain it with her limited resources. Knowing she was unable to adequately care for the house, Owen sold the plantation to Arlin K. Dease in 1980, who had restored three other antebellum mansions, including the [[Myrtles Plantation]] in [[St. Francisville, Louisiana]], with the caveat that she be allowed to live in house until her death. After she died in 2003, the house ceased to be a private home. Dease restored Nottoway, working a crew of 40 to 60 men for 12 hours a day, and opened the house to the public three months after his purchase.

The [[Plantation house in the Southern United States|plantation house]] is a [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]]- and [[Italianate architecture|Italianate-styled]] [[mansion]] built by John Hampden Randolph in 1859, and is the largest extant [[antebellum architecture|antebellum]] plantation house in the South with {{convert|53000|sqft|m2}} of floor space.\n\n==Mansion and grounds==\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Nottoway Plantation House.jpg|thumb|left|250px|North Front of Nottoway]]\nJohn Randolph commissioned renowned architect [[Henry Howard (architect)|Henry Howard]] of [[New Orleans]] with the task of designing the grand mansion with the intention that no expense would be spared in the construction. Howard sited the three-story wooden frame house, that includes a one-story rusticated stucco-covered brick base on a concrete foundation, to face east towards the [[Mississippi River]]. The entrance facade is asymmetrically balanced with a projecting bedroom wing to the left side and a large curved bay with galleries on the right. The main five-bay structure, with a central projecting portico, emphasizes height rather than width with the main living areas on the second and third-stories both being {{convert|15.5|ft|m}} in height above the one-story basement, scored to appear as stone, and featuring an arched niche flanked with narrow [[Fenestration (architecture)|fenestrations]]. The galleries are embellished with custom ornamental iron railings made in New Orleans, capped with molded wooden handrails. Double curved [[granite]] staircases, installed by skilled mason, Newton Richards, rise to the second-story. These steps were built with the left side intended for ladies and the right side for gentlemen. The steps for the men can also be identified by the boot scraper at the bottom. The separate staircases were so that the men would not see the women's ankles beneath their skirts as they climbed, which was considered a severe breach of social [[etiquette]] at the time. The close spacing and angularity of the gallery's 22 square columns and their elongated capitals also emphasize the vertical qualities of the house. Above the capitals, small brackets branch out to carry a tall [[entablature]] decorated with [[modillions]], supporting a projecting [[cornice]] that nearly covers the hipped roof that is pierced with six chimneys. In the rear of the house is a two-story [[studio apartment|gar\u00e7onni\u00e8re]] wing where the Randolph sons resided.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nottoway Plantation|url=http://www.knowla.org/entry/1727/|publisher=Knowla.org|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of Nottoway was completed in 1859 at an estimated cost of $80,000; to prevent any duplicate homes being built, Randolph destroyed the architect's plans after completion.\n\n===Interiors===\n[[File:Nottoway Interior.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The White Ballroom]][[File:Nottoway Dining Room.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Dining Room]]\nNottoway has over an acre of floor space spread out over three floors, and a total of 64 rooms with 165 doors and 200 windows, most of which can also double as doors.  The house enjoyed 19th-century novelties such as a bathroom located on each floor with flushing toilets and hot and cold running water, gas lighting throughout the house and a complex servant call bell system. The principal rooms of the house are located on the second floor. The entrance hall runs the length of the house and is 12 feet wide and 40 feet long. Large [[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat crystal]] and brass chandeliers hang from the {{convert|15.5|ft|m}} high ceilings and the doors with hand-painted German Dresden porcelain doorknobs and matching keyhole covers, leading to the adjacent rooms are {{convert|11|ft|m}} tall. Above the doors and along the ceilings are plaster frieze moldings, with modillions interspersed with [[paterae]], that are made from mud, clay, horse hair and Spanish moss. To the right of the entrance hall is the most unusual, and reportedly John Randolph's most favorite room in the house, the White Ballroom. With [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns, hand-cast archways and an L-shaped extension into a curved bay, Randolph had it painted completely white, including the flooring, to show off the natural beauty of his seven daughters, six of whom would be married there. Featuring two fireplaces with hand-carved [[rococo]] white marble mantles, there is also an original mirror placed so that the women could see if their ankles or [[Hoop skirt|hoops]] were showing beneath their skirts. Over one of the fireplaces, there is a painting of Mary Henshaw (no relation to the family), whose eyes are said to follow the viewer around the room. Flanking the entrance hall to the left is a gentleman's study, a stair hall and the formal dining room. Both the study and the dining room feature black Italian hand-carved marble mantles on their coal burning fireplaces, and the rooms are filled with period antique furniture. The dining room plasterwork showcases pink camellias, Emily Randolph's favorite flower, and is the only plasterwork in the house to have color.\n\nThe main staircase of Honduran mahogany is covered in green velvet and ascends to the Ancestral Hall on the third-floor. The hall was used by the Randolphs as a family parlor, being a central thoroughfare to many of the adjacent bedrooms, and gave access to the third-floor gallery with views of the Mississippi River. Nearby, is the master bedroom, with one of the three original bathrooms, as well as a small room that was used as a [[Nursery (room)|nursery]] for Julia Marceline, the Randolph's last and only child born at Nottoway. During the Civil War, Emily Randolph utilized a bedpost at the end of the bed to hide valuable jewelry. Though originally bedrooms, one has been made into a music room displaying musical instruments from the 19th-century, and another known as the Wicker Room features wicker furniture originally owned by the Randolph family.\n\nThe first floor basement has been transformed into a restaurant and a small museum about the Randolph family, and the history of the plantation. Originally the space held the laundry, dairy, wine cellar and servants quarters, as well as a 10-pin bowling alley for the amusement of the children.\n\n===Grounds===\nThe landscape for Nottoway was designed by John Nelson of New Orleans whose plan included 120 fruit and citrus trees, 12 magnolia trees, poplar and live oak trees, 75 rose bushes, 150 strawberry plants and a variety of flower and vegetable gardens. However, due to neglect and the erosion of six and a half acres of land by the Mississippi River, the gardens designed by Nelson no longer exist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nottoway's Architectural History|url=https://nottowayplantation.wordpress.com/|publisher=Nottoway Plantation's Blog|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}</ref> Today, the house sits only 200 feet behind a river levee and the grounds include a small formal hedge garden adjacent to the gar\u00e7onni\u00e8re where the detached kitchen once stood, and a fountain courtyard in front of the southern bedroom wing. Surrounding the house are modern ancillary buildings that house offices and event facilities. The owners expanded the property in 2008 by building a carriage house, ballroom and nine Acadian-style cottages modeled after the property's original slave quarters, while the plantation was closed to the public for repairs, as a result of damage incurred by [[Hurricane Gustav]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic Louisiana plantation to be auctioned|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/02/historic-louisiana-plantation-to-be-auctioned/|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref> To the north of the house is the reconstructed stables, now re-purposed as a ballroom, and the Randolph cemetery where the remains of the family were reinterred in 2003.\n\n==History==\n\n===19th century===\nJohn Hampden Randolph was born in [[Virginia]] in 1813, a member of the prominent [[Randolph family of Virginia|Randolph family]]. He migrated with his family to Mississippi when his father, [[Peter Randolph|Peter Randolph Jr.]], was appointed a federal judge in [[Woodville, Mississippi]], by [[James Monroe|President James Monroe]] in 1820.\n\nJohn Randolph married Emily Jane Liddell in 1837 and went on to have eleven children with her. Randolph devoted most of his time to his [[cotton]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]], but believing sugar production would be more lucrative he decided to move his family to southern Louisiana in 1842 where he purchased a {{convert|1650|acre|km2}} cotton plantation that he named Forest Home. Converting the plantation to [[sugar cane]] production two years later and constructing [[Iberville Parish, Louisiana|Iberville Parish's]] first [[steam engine|steam-powered]] [[sugar cane mill|sugar mill]], he was able to triple his earnings over his cotton production. Within ten years he had increased his holdings to {{convert|7116|acre|km2}} and owned 176 [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved people]] making Randolph one of the larger slaveholders in the South. In 1855 he purchased an additional {{convert|400|acre|km2}} of highland, and {{convert|620|acre|km2}} of [[swamp]] and Mississippi River-front land where he sought to build a more prestigious home that he named \"Nottoway\", after [[Nottoway County, Virginia|Nottoway County]] in the part of Virginia where he was born.\n\n[[File:Nottoway Plantation-022.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Painting by Cornelia Randolph showing original garden landscape]]\nHe selected Henry Howard, a very popular architect of the time, considered to have been one of the finest architects of 19th-century [[New Orleans]]. Many of his Greek Revival and Italianate style buildings, churches, and homes can still be found in the city.  He also designed the neighboring [[Belle Grove Plantation (Iberville Parish, Louisiana)|Belle Grove]], now destroyed.  Randolph and the owner of Belle Grove, John Andrews, are known to have had a rivalry of sorts that even extended to their homes.<ref name=\"lostplan\">{{cite book |title=Lost Plantations of the South |last=Matrana |first=Marc R. |year=2009 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson, MS |isbn=978-1-57806-942-2 |pages=184\u2013192 }}</ref> Compiling the materials for his [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantation home]], cypress logs were cut and cured under water for six years, then cut into planks and dried into what is called virgin cypress.

Social discussion and sharing suffer when people have a narrow information base and don't reach outside their network. The echo chambers can be detrimental to the well-being of a person. Essentially, the filter bubble can distort our very own realities that we thought could not be altered by outside sources. The Farnam Street academic blog explains that the filter bubble can have a bigger impact on us than we think. It can create echo chambers that leads us to believe that what you are seeing through ads is the only opinion or perspective that is right.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.blog/2017/07/filter-bubbles/|title=How Filter Bubbles Distort Reality: Everything You Need to Know|last=Parrish|first=Shane|date=2017-07-31|website=Farnam Street}}</ref> This goes back to political ads that were constantly in circulation on the internet making the user think that it is the only correct opinion out there. Put otherwise, \u201cIf we don\u2019t like facts, we don\u2019t believe them. If we DO like something presented to us as fact, even if it is false, we tend to believe it. If we see too much of our viewpoint and perspectives everyday, we believe that there are no other opinions and that ours is the correct one in all cases.\"\n\nMany offline communities are also segregated by political beliefs and cultural views. The echo chamber effect may prevent individuals from noticing changes in language and culture involving groups other than their own. Online echo chambers can sometimes influence an individual\u2019s willingness to participate in similar discussions offline. A 2016 study found that \u201cTwitter users who felt their audience on Twitter agreed with their opinion were more willing to speak out on that issue in the workplace\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<br />\n\n== Alleged examples ==\nIdeological echo chambers have existed in many forms, for centuries.

A high-profile example of this is the changes [[Facebook]] made to its \u201cTrending\u201d page, which is an on-site news source for its users. Facebook modified their \u201cTrending\u201d page by transitioning from displaying a single news source to multiple news sources for a topic or event. The intended purpose of this was to expand the breadth of news sources for any given headline, and therefore expose readers to a variety of viewpoints. There are startups building apps with the mission of encouraging users to open their echo chambers. ''UnFound.news'' offers an AI([[Artifical Intelligence]]) curated news app to readers presenting them news from diverse and distinct perspectives, helping them form rational and informed opinion rather than succumbing to their own biases.

Social discussion and sharing suffer when people have a narrow information base and don't reach outside their network. The echo chambers can be detrimental to the well-being of a person. Essentially, the filter bubble can distort our very own realities that we thought could not be altered by outside sources. The Farnam Street academic blog explains that the filter bubble can have a bigger impact on us than we think. It can create echo chambers that leads us to believe that what you are seeing through ads is the only opinion or perspective that is right.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.blog/2017/07/filter-bubbles/|title=How Filter Bubbles Distort Reality: Everything You Need to Know|last=Parrish|first=Shane|date=2017-07-31|website=Farnam Street}}</ref> This goes back to political ads that were constantly in circulation on the internet making the user think that it is the only correct opinion out there. Put otherwise, \u201cIf we don\u2019t like facts, we don\u2019t believe them. If we DO like something presented to us as fact, even if it is false, we tend to believe it. If we see too much of our viewpoint and perspectives everyday, we believe that there are no other opinions and that ours is the correct one in all cases.\"\n\nMany offline communities are also segregated by political beliefs and cultural views. The echo chamber effect may prevent individuals from noticing changes in language and culture involving groups other than their own. Online echo chambers can sometimes influence an individual\u2019s willingness to participate in similar discussions offline. A 2016 study found that \u201cTwitter users who felt their audience on Twitter agreed with their opinion were more willing to speak out on that issue in the workplace\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<br />\n\n== Alleged examples ==\nIdeological echo chambers have existed in many forms, for centuries.

A high-profile example of this is the changes [[Facebook]] made to its \u201cTrending\u201d page, which is an on-site news source for its users. Facebook modified their \u201cTrending\u201d page by transitioning from displaying a single news source to multiple news sources for a topic or event. The intended purpose of this was to expand the breadth of news sources for any given headline, and therefore expose readers to a variety of viewpoints. There are startups building apps with the mission of encouraging users to open their echo chambers. ''UnFound.news'' offers an AI([[Artifical Intelligence]]) curated news app to readers presenting them news from diverse and distinct perspectives, helping them form rational and informed opinion rather than succumbing to their own biases.

He suggested that, \"We should use the same media to remove the misconceptions, misquotations, misinterpretations, and misrepresentations about Islam.\"<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/> He claimed, [[western power]]s and [[western media|media]] play a double-standard strategy, who describe Muslims as [[extremist]]s and [[fundamentalist]]s to defame Islam.<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/><ref name=\"Gambia3\"/> He said, \"The maximum damage done to the image of Islam today is by the international media which is bombarding misconceptions about it day and night using an array of strategies. International media, be it print, audio, video, or online, use a number of strategies to malign Islam by first picking up the black sheep of the Muslim community, and portraying them as though they are exemplary Muslims.\" Naik also claimed the \"third and fourth\" strategy by international media is \"to pick a word from [[Quran]] or [[sunnah]] and mistranslate it\" and \"to malign Islam by saying something that does not belong to it\".<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\nNaik also said, \"If a Muslim woman wears [[hijab]] or veil it is labeled as women subjugation, but if a [[nun]] does to the same it turns into a sign of respect and modesty. A 50-year-old Muslim marrying a 16-year-old girl (willingly) is a headline, but a 50-year-old non-Muslim raping a six-year-old girl appears as brief news or filler. They say Islam does not give [[Women's rights|rights to women]], and is an illogical [[religion]]. They portray Islam as the problem of humanity though it is the solution to all man's problems. The same applies to the misinterpreted words 'fundamentalist' and 'extremist' which are basically western words.<ref name=\"Gambia3\"/> A true Muslim must be an extremist in the correct direction, by being extremely kind, loving, tolerant, honest and just. While [[Indian people|Indians]] were [[Indian independence movement|fighting for their freedom]], the [[British government]] was labelling them as terrorists; same activity, same people, but two different labels. The same happened with Muslims who are labelled as terrorists in media, so we should look into backgrounds and reasons for an activity before labelling people.\" <ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\nHe criticizes the portrayal of Muslims in films saying, \"Hundreds of movies were made in [[Hollywood]] to malign the image of Islam that a non-Muslim gets scared when he heard a Muslim saying '[[Allah Akbar]]', thinking that he is going to kill him. If anyone really wants to know how good Islam is, he or she has to study its authentic sources; the glorious [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] rather than looking to its followers ([[Muslim]]s) as is the case with a motorist whose reckless driving should be blamed for an accident rather than the latest [[Mercedes (marque)|Mercedes car]] he was driving. The best exemplary Muslim is the last and final messenger prophet [[Muhammad]], peace be upon him.\" He also criticized media for \"pick(ing) up Muslims who criticised Islam like [[Salman Rushdie]], and giv(ing) them awards\", saying, \"If a Muslim does something great, they may give him credit but ignore his religion or change his Muslim name like the Aristotle of the East, [[Avicenna]], whose real name was \"Ali Ibn Sina\".\"<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\n=== Other religions ===\n\n====Apostasy====\nNaik believes that Muslims who [[apostasy in Islam|convert from Islam]] should not necessarily receive death sentences, but that under Islamic law those who leave Islam<ref name=\"hp10\" /> and then \"propagate the non-Islamic faith and speak against Islam\" should be put to death.<ref name=\"apostat4\">\n[http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/30405 \"Maldivian renounces Islam, gets attacked by Zakir Naik audience\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827113937/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/30405 |date=27 August 2013 }}  May 2010.

He suggested that, \"We should use the same media to remove the misconceptions, misquotations, misinterpretations, and misrepresentations about Islam.\"<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/> He claimed, [[western power]]s and [[western media|media]] play a double-standard strategy, who describe Muslims as [[extremist]]s and [[fundamentalist]]s to defame Islam.<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/><ref name=\"Gambia3\"/> He said, \"The maximum damage done to the image of Islam today is by the international media which is bombarding misconceptions about it day and night using an array of strategies. International media, be it print, audio, video, or online, use a number of strategies to malign Islam by first picking up the black sheep of the Muslim community, and portraying them as though they are exemplary Muslims.\" Naik also claimed the \"third and fourth\" strategy by international media is \"to pick a word from [[Quran]] or [[sunnah]] and mistranslate it\" and \"to malign Islam by saying something that does not belong to it\".<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\nNaik also said, \"If a Muslim woman wears [[hijab]] or veil it is labeled as women subjugation, but if a [[nun]] does to the same it turns into a sign of respect and modesty. A 50-year-old Muslim marrying a 16-year-old girl (willingly) is a headline, but a 50-year-old non-Muslim raping a six-year-old girl appears as brief news or filler. They say Islam does not give [[Women's rights|rights to women]], and is an illogical [[religion]]. They portray Islam as the problem of humanity though it is the solution to all man's problems. The same applies to the misinterpreted words 'fundamentalist' and 'extremist' which are basically western words.<ref name=\"Gambia3\"/> A true Muslim must be an extremist in the correct direction, by being extremely kind, loving, tolerant, honest and just. While [[Indian people|Indians]] were [[Indian independence movement|fighting for their freedom]], the [[British government]] was labelling them as terrorists; same activity, same people, but two different labels. The same happened with Muslims who are labelled as terrorists in media, so we should look into backgrounds and reasons for an activity before labelling people.\" <ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\nHe criticizes the portrayal of Muslims in films saying, \"Hundreds of movies were made in [[Hollywood]] to malign the image of Islam that a non-Muslim gets scared when he heard a Muslim saying '[[Allah Akbar]]', thinking that he is going to kill him. If anyone really wants to know how good Islam is, he or she has to study its authentic sources; the glorious [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] rather than looking to its followers ([[Muslim]]s) as is the case with a motorist whose reckless driving should be blamed for an accident rather than the latest [[Mercedes (marque)|Mercedes car]] he was driving. The best exemplary Muslim is the last and final messenger prophet [[Muhammad]], peace be upon him.\" He also criticized media for \"pick(ing) up Muslims who criticised Islam like [[Salman Rushdie]], and giv(ing) them awards\", saying, \"If a Muslim does something great, they may give him credit but ignore his religion or change his Muslim name like the Aristotle of the East, [[Avicenna]], whose real name was \"Ali Ibn Sina\".\"<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\n=== Other religions ===\n\n====Apostasy====\nNaik believes that Muslims who [[apostasy in Islam|convert from Islam]] should not necessarily receive death sentences, but that under Islamic law those who leave Islam<ref name=\"hp10\" /> and then \"propagate the non-Islamic faith and speak against Islam\" should be put to death.<ref name=\"apostat4\">\n[http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/30405 \"Maldivian renounces Islam, gets attacked by Zakir Naik audience\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827113937/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/30405 |date=27 August 2013 }}  May 2010.
