The store allows users to browse and download apps developed with Apple's [[iOS SDK|iOS software development kit]]. Apps can be downloaded on the [[iPhone]] smartphone, the [[iPod Touch]] handheld computer, or the [[iPad]] tablet computer, and some can be transferred to the [[Apple Watch]] smartwatch or 4th-generation or newer [[Apple TV]]s as extensions of iPhone apps.\n\nThe App Store was opened on July 10, 2008, with an initial 500 applications available. {{As of|2017|}}, the store features over 2.2 million apps.\n\nDevelopers have multiple options for monetizing their applications, ranging from free, free with in-app purchases, and paid. However, App Store has been criticized for a lackluster development environment, prompting the company in June 2016 to announce a \"renewed focus and energy\" on the store. Major changes introduced in the following months include ads in search results, a new app subscription model, and the ability for developers to respond to customer reviews. Additionally, Apple began a process to remove old apps that do not function as intended or that don't follow current app guidelines, with app research firms noticing significant numbers of app removals from the store. Furthermore, with the release of [[iOS 11]] in September 2017, App Store received a complete design overhaul, bringing a greater focus on editorial content and daily highlights, as well as a design similar in style to several of Apple's built-in iOS apps.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Download on iTunes.svg|thumb|''Download on the App Store'' badge as of 2017]]\n\nThe iPhone App Store opened on July

Originally introduced as part of Apple's [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|2017 developer conference]], new App Store guidelines allow the company to ban apps making use of templates or commercial app services. This affected many small businesses, with ''TechCrunch''{{'}}s report citing that \"local retailers, restaurants, small fitness studios, nonprofits, churches and other organizations\" benefit from using templates or app services due to minimal costs. Developers had received notice from Apple with a January 1, 2018 deadline to change their respective apps. The news caught the attention of Congress, with Congressman [[Ted Lieu]] writing a letter to Apple at the beginning of December, asking it to reconsider, writing that \"It is my understanding that many small businesses, research organizations, and religious institutions rely on template apps when they do not possess the resources to develop apps in-house\", and that the new rules cast \"too wide a net\", specifically \"invalidating apps from longstanding and legitimate developers who pose no threat to the App Store\u2019s integrity\". Additionally, the news of stricter enforcement caused significant criticism from app development firms; one company told ''TechCrunch'' that it chose to close down its business following the news, saying that \"The 4.2.6 [rule enforcement] was just a final drop that made us move on a bit faster with that decision [to close]\", and another company told the publication that \"There was no way in June [when the guidelines changed] that we would have said, \u2018that\u2019s going to target our apps' ... Apple had told us you aren\u2019t being targeted by this from a quality standpoint. So being hit now under the umbrella of spam is shocking to every quality developer out there and all the good actors\". Furthermore, the latter company stated that \"there\u2019s only so much you can do with apps that perform the same utility \u2013 ordering food\". A third company said that \"Rule 4.2.6 is a concrete illustration of the danger of Apple\u2019s dominant position\", and a fourth said that \"They\u2019ve wiped out pretty much an entire industry.

distribution]] platform, developed and maintained by [[Apple Inc.]], for [[mobile app]]s on its [[iOS]] operating system. The store allows users to browse and download apps developed with Apple's [[iOS SDK|iOS software development kit]]. Apps can be downloaded on the [[iPhone]] smartphone, the [[iPod Touch]] handheld computer, or the [[iPad]] tablet computer, and some can be transferred to the [[Apple Watch]] smartwatch or 4th-generation or newer [[Apple TV]]s as extensions of iPhone apps.\n\nThe App Store was opened on July 10, 2008, with an initial 500 applications available. {{As of|2017|}}, the store features over 2.2 million apps.\n\nDevelopers have multiple options for monetizing their applications, ranging from free, free with in-app purchases, and paid. However, App Store has been criticized for a lackluster development environment, prompting the company in June 2016 to announce a \"renewed focus and energy\" on the store. Major changes introduced in the following months include ads in search results, a new app subscription model, and the ability for developers to respond to customer reviews. Additionally, Apple began a process to remove old apps that do not function as intended or that don't follow current app guidelines, with app research firms noticing significant numbers of app removals from the store. Furthermore, with the release of [[iOS 11]] in September 2017, App Store received a complete design overhaul, bringing a greater focus on editorial content and daily highlights, as well as a design similar in style to several of Apple's built-in iOS apps.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Download on iTunes.svg|thumb|''Download on the App Store'' badge as of 2017]]\n\nThe iPhone App Store opened on July

Originally introduced as part of Apple's [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|2017 developer conference]], new App Store guidelines allow the company to ban apps making use of templates or commercial app services. This affected many small businesses, with ''TechCrunch''{{'}}s report citing that \"local retailers, restaurants, small fitness studios, nonprofits, churches and other organizations\" benefit from using templates or app services due to minimal costs. Developers had received notice from Apple with a January 1, 2018 deadline to change their respective apps. The news caught the attention of Congress, with Congressman [[Ted Lieu]] writing a letter to Apple at the beginning of December, asking it to reconsider, writing that \"It is my understanding that many small businesses, research organizations, and religious institutions rely on template apps when they do not possess the resources to develop apps in-house\", and that the new rules cast \"too wide a net\", specifically \"invalidating apps from longstanding and legitimate developers who pose no threat to the App Store\u2019s integrity\". Additionally, the news of stricter enforcement caused significant criticism from app development firms; one company told ''TechCrunch'' that it chose to close down its business following the news, saying that \"The 4.2.6 [rule enforcement] was just a final drop that made us move on a bit faster with that decision [to close]\", and another company told the publication that \"There was no way in June [when the guidelines changed] that we would have said, \u2018that\u2019s going to target our apps' ... Apple had told us you aren\u2019t being targeted by this from a quality standpoint. So being hit now under the umbrella of spam is shocking to every quality developer out there and all the good actors\". Furthermore, the latter company stated that \"there\u2019s only so much you can do with apps that perform the same utility \u2013 ordering food\". A third company said that \"Rule 4.2.6 is a concrete illustration of the danger of Apple\u2019s dominant position\", and a fourth said that \"They\u2019ve wiped out pretty much an entire industry.

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

He was England's second ever player to score at the new [[Wembley Stadium]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nHe was an important member of the team which won promotion to the Premiership via the play-offs in 2003\u201304, and he was ever present as Palace battled for their Premiership place in [[2004-05 in English football|2004\u201305]] and, although they just failed to avoid the drop, Routledge proved to be an exciting talent on the wing and up front, chipping in with an impressive 8 assists. He was not to leave the top flight, though. After rejecting a contract with the club that developed him as a youngster in January, [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] signed him on 1 July 2005.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/4103062.stm |title=Tottenham agree deal on Routledge |website=BBC Sport |date=17 June 2005}}</ref> The clubs could not come to an agreement over a fee for Routledge so the transfer went to a tribunal. There it was agreed that Palace would receive an initial \u00a31.25 million, rising to \u00a32&nbsp;million depending upon appearances in future.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Tottenham Hotspur===\nAfter impressing in the pre-season, his career at [[White Hart Lane]] started slowly as he sustained a broken foot on his league debut for the club, but on 12 December 2005 he made his return as a substitute in only his second match for Spurs against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nHe was loaned to Portsmouth in the January 2006 transfer window<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/4663326.stm |title=Pompey sign Routledge & Koroman |website=BBC Sport |date=30 January 2006}}</ref> and made 13 appearances for them before returning to Spurs at the season's end. Routledge impressed Portsmouth boss [[Harry Redknapp]] in a home match against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in March 2006, when, with Bolton 1\u20130 ahead with only three minutes left to play, Routledge outpaced three Bolton players into the penalty box to connect with a long pass from [[Matthew Taylor (footballer)|Matthew Taylor]] and set [[Azar Karadas]] up for a spectacular volley which levelled the match and ultimately earned relegation-threatened Portsmouth a crucial 1\u20131 draw, a result that began a run of good late season form for them.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAfter impressing in the pre-season again, he was once again loaned out on a year deal to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] as part of the deal that brought [[Steed Malbranque]] to Spurs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/5302196.stm |title=Malbranque & Routledge swap clubs |website=BBC Sport |date=31 August 2006}}</ref> This was also partly due to the emergence of [[Aaron Lennon]] at both club and international level.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nHis Fulham bow came as a 34th minute replacement for injury victim [[Jimmy Bullard]] in a 2\u20131 victory at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. He went on to create two goals in the final ten minutes of the match. He is most remembered during his time at Fulham for his winning goal in a thrilling FA Cup tie against Leicester City in January 2007, which ended 4\u20133 to Fulham.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/6258849.stm |title=Fulham 4\u20133 Leicester |website=BBC Sport |date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=2 September 2009 |first=Paul |last=Fletcher}}</ref>\n\n===Aston Villa===\nOn 30 January 2008 Routledge joined [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on an 18-month contract in a deal worth \u00a31.5&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Routledge completes Villa switch |website=BBC Sport |date=30 January 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/7218693.stm |accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref> He made his first-team debut on 5 April 2008 coming on as a late substitute for [[Stiliyan Petrov]] in the 86th minute in a 4\u20130 win against Bolton.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nOn 10 July 2008, Routledge was the subject of a scathing verbal attack from Crystal Palace chairman [[Simon Jordan]].

plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for {{English football updater|SwanseaC}} club [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]]. He has represented [[England national football team|England]] at under-16, under-19 and [[England national under-21 football team|under-21]] level.\n\nRoutledge began his career in London with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] as a youth before making senior appearances with the first team. He then moved to Premier League club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for two years but spent part of that time on loan to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. He made only five appearances with Tottenham before moving to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for one season but only made two appearances and spent part of the time with Championship club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on loan before a permanent transfer to fellow Championship team [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].\n\nAfter one season with them, he moved clubs again, this time to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], helping them to win promotion and the Championship title. During his time there, he was loaned back to QPR who also sealed the title at the end of the season. After they were promoted, Routledge signed for Swansea City from Newcastle after the latter terminated his contract. During his spell with Swansea, he scored his first Premier League goal against Aston Villa, and has made over 200 appearances in all competitions within eight seasons before the club released him. He then rejoined Swansea city, after being offered a one-year contract.\n\n==Early life==\nRoutledge was born in [[Sidcup]], Greater London<ref>{{cite web |url=https://uk.soccerway.com/players/wayne-routledge/2946/ |title=W. Routledge: Summary |website=Soccerway |publisher=Perform Group |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> and attended [[The Archbishop Lanfranc School|Archbishop Lanfranc School]] in [[Croydon]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Archbishop Lanfranc School offers 'unique' sports opportunities |date=22 October 2010 |url=http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/Lanfranc-cuts-unique-deal-elite-performers/story-11372128-detail/story.html |website=This is Croydon Today |accessdate=28 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730031935/http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/Lanfranc-cuts-unique-deal-elite-performers/story-11372128-detail/story.html |archivedate=30 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n===Crystal Palace===\nRoutledge began his career at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], making his starting debut against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] at the age of 17 in September 2002, and scoring after just one minute on the field. He made his Palace debut in October 2001 in a 1\u20130 home defeat by [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], aged only 16. He was England's second ever player to score at the new [[Wembley Stadium]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nHe was an important member of the team which won promotion to the Premiership via the play-offs in 2003\u201304, and he was ever present as Palace battled for their Premiership place in [[2004-05 in English football|2004\u201305]] and, although they just failed to avoid the drop, Routledge proved to be an exciting talent on the wing and up front, chipping in with an impressive 8 assists. He was not to leave the top flight, though. After rejecting a contract with the club that developed him as a youngster in January, [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] signed him on 1 July 2005.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/4103062.stm |title=Tottenham agree deal on Routledge |website=BBC Sport |date=17 June 2005}}</ref> The clubs could not come to an agreement over a fee for Routledge so the transfer went to a tribunal. There it was agreed that Palace would receive an initial \u00a31.25 million, rising to \u00a32&nbsp;million depending upon appearances in future.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Tottenham Hotspur===\nAfter impressing in the pre-season, his career at [[White Hart Lane]] started slowly as he sustained a broken foot on his league debut for the club, but on 12 December 2005 he made his return as a substitute in only his second match for Spurs against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nHe was loaned to Portsmouth in the January 2006 transfer window<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/4663326.stm |title=Pompey sign Routledge & Koroman |website=BBC Sport |date=30 January 2006}}</ref> and made 13 appearances for them before returning to Spurs at the season's end. Routledge impressed Portsmouth boss [[Harry Redknapp]] in a home match against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in March 2006, when, with Bolton 1\u20130 ahead with only three minutes left to play, Routledge outpaced three Bolton players into the penalty box to connect with a long pass from [[Matthew Taylor (footballer)|Matthew Taylor]] and set [[Azar Karadas]] up for a spectacular volley which levelled the match and ultimately earned relegation-threatened Portsmouth a crucial 1\u20131 draw, a result that began a run of good late season form for them.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAfter impressing in the pre-season again, he was once again loaned out on a year deal to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] as part of the deal that brought [[Steed Malbranque]] to Spurs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/5302196.stm |title=Malbranque & Routledge swap clubs |website=BBC Sport |date=31 August 2006}}</ref> This was also partly due to the emergence of [[Aaron Lennon]] at both club and international level.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nHis Fulham bow came as a 34th minute replacement for injury victim [[Jimmy Bullard]] in a 2\u20131 victory at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. He went on to create two goals in the final ten minutes of the match. He is most remembered during his time at Fulham for his winning goal in a thrilling FA Cup tie against Leicester City in January 2007, which ended 4\u20133 to Fulham.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/6258849.stm |title=Fulham 4\u20133 Leicester |website=BBC Sport |date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=2 September 2009 |first=Paul |last=Fletcher}}</ref>\n\n===Aston Villa===\nOn 30 January 2008 Routledge joined [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on an 18-month contract in a deal worth \u00a31.5&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Routledge completes Villa switch |website=BBC Sport |date=30 January 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/7218693.stm |accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref> He made his first-team debut on 5 April 2008 coming on as a late substitute for [[Stiliyan Petrov]] in the 86th minute in a 4\u20130 win against Bolton.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nOn 10 July 2008, Routledge was the subject of a scathing verbal attack from Crystal Palace chairman [[Simon Jordan]]. Jordan was giving an interview about now ex-Palace midfielder [[John Bostock]], during which he used Routledge as an example of why he believed the youth player should not leave Palace to join Tottenham.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n<blockquote>\n''\"When Spurs came knocking I told Wayne to stay and learn his trade at Palace, but he went, he grabbed the money, and now he's at Villa not getting in the first team, just like he didn't get in the Spurs team, just like he didn't get in the Portsmouth team and just like he didn't get in the Fulham team.\"''<ref>{{cite news |title=Jordan warns Spurs-bound Bostock |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/7499205.stm |website=BBC Sport |date=8 July 2008 |accessdate=8 July 2008}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Cardiff City===\nIn November 2008 after making just one league appearance for Aston Villa so far during the season, Routledge was allowed to join [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on a two-month loan deal after the club suffered a double injury blow when both [[Joe Ledley]] and [[Peter Whittingham]] were ruled out for one and three months respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10335~1460630,00.html |title=Wayne Routledge signs |publisher=Cardiff City F.C. |date=20 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722111012/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10335~1460630,00.html |archivedate=22 July 2012}}</ref> He made his debut for the club on 22 November in a 2\u20131 defeat to [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] during which he supplied the through pass for [[Michael Chopra]] to score Cardiff's only goal of the match.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7727300.stm |title=Plymouth 2\u20131 Cardiff |website=BBC Sport |date=22 November 2008 |accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref> He scored his first goal for the club in just his second match when he found the net against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] during a 2\u20132 draw on 25 November.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7741583.stm |title=Cardiff 2\u20132 Reading |website=BBC Sport |date=25 November 2008 |accessdate=2 September 2009}}</ref> He soon found the net for a second time, this time scoring Cardiff's second goal in the 2\u20132 draw at [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7763305.stm |title=Burnley 2\u20132 Cardiff |website=BBC Sport |date=9 December 2008 |accessdate=2 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn the lead up to the opening of the January transfer window it was revealed that Cardiff had offered a fee of around \u00a33&nbsp;million in order to sign Routledge on a permanent deal.

He started Newcastle's opening five matches on the wide right of midfield, in an unchanged team which saw them pick up seven points from the first five matches and climb to 5th in the table on 18 September 2010.

Together with his early climbing partner, Don Whillans, he was one of a new breed of British post-war climbers who came from working-class backgrounds in contrast to the [[upper class|upper]] and [[middle class]] professionals who had dominated the sport up to the [[Second World War]].\n\n==Early life==\nBrown was born the seventh and last child of a family in [[Ardwick]], [[Manchester]], [[Lancashire]], England,<ref>\"Joe Brown Biography.\" /</ref> His father was a builder and merchant seaman who died in 1931 when Brown was eight months old. Brown's mother was forced to take in washing before she began work as a cleaner. In his biography, 'The Hard Years', Brown remembered being banned from the Scouts for refusing to go on a church parade and recalled how he began exploring the countryside - camping out, playing and climbing in old quarries. At around 16 he came to Kinder Downfall and, having read Colin Kirkus' 'Let's Go Climbing', he borrowed his mother's old washing line to use as a rope.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.thebmc.co.uk/legendary-climber-joe-brown-dies | title=Legendary climber Joe Brown dies | author=Ed Douglas | publisher=BMC | date=16 April 2020}}</ref>  \n\nAfter leaving school he trained as an apprentice plumber and general builder, working for a company called Archies.<ref name=\"Joe Brown Biography 2012\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20120512003631/http://www.joe-brown.com/docman/joe-brown/joe-browns-biography/download.html \"Joe Brown Biography\"] Joe-Brown.com.</ref> In 1949-50, he was [[Conscription in the United Kingdom#After 1945|enlisted]] for 18 months in the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]], where he spent his free time climbing with friends. Brown broke his leg in three places in a scrum for the tea urn but was back up and climbing three months later.<ref name=\"Joe Brown Biography 2012\" />\n\n==Climbing career==\n[[File:Joe Brown's Shop - geograph.org.uk - 1452330.jpg|thumb|right|Joe Brown shop in [[Capel Curig]]]]\nBrown, who was known as \"The Master\" and \"The Human Fly\", became famous for climbing during the 1950s. He was a member of the Valkyrie Climbing Club and founding member of the [[Rock and Ice climbing club]].<ref name=\"Thompson 2010\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Simon|title=Unjustifiable Risk?|year=2010|publisher=Cicerone|pages=207\u2013209}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/tributes-joe-brown-pioneering-climber-died-aged-89 | title=Tributes to pioneering climber Joe Brown, who has died aged 89 | work=The Guardian | date=16 April 2020}}</ref> In Hard Rock<ref>{{cite book | title=Hard Rock | author=Ken Wilson | publisher=HarperCollins | date=1980}}</ref> Ken Wilson said of Brown: \"The reader may gain some idea of his ability by studying those of his climbs featured in this book. He has brought to climbing a rare combination of attributes: keenness, patience, strength, technical ability, eye for a line, competitiveness and, above all, a subtle and mysterious charisma. Few would deny that his place in British rock climbing remains pre-eminent.\"  \n\nAn early climbing partner was [[Don Whillans]], from the neighbouring city of [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]]. They were among the first of a new breed of post-war climbers from [[working-class]] backgrounds, in contrast to the [[upper class|upper]] and [[middle class]] professionals who had dominated the sport up to the [[Second World War]]. So famous was he that the [[Post Office]] delivered a letter to him simply addressed \"The Human Fly, UK\".<ref name=\"Scott2015\">{{cite book|first = Doug |last =  Scott | title = Up and About: The Hard Road to Everest | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rgoNCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT372 | date = 2 November 2015 | publisher = Vertebrate Publishing | isbn=978-1-910240-42-7 | pages=372}}</ref>\n\nBrown established a number of new routes in [[Snowdonia]] and the [[Peak District]] that were at the leading edge of the hardest [[Grade (climbing)|grade]]s. Examples on [[Dinas Cromlech]] in the [[Llanberis Pass]] include \"Cenotaph Corner\" (1952, [[Grade (climbing)#Adjectival grade|graded E1]], with Doug Belshaw) and \"Cemetery Gates\" (1951, E1, with Don Whillans).<ref name=\"Thompson 2010\" /> \n\nBrown's mountaineering achievements in the [[Alps]] and [[Himalayas]] included many ascents in the 1950s with Whillans and other members of the Rock and Ice climbing club and, in 1955, the first ascent of the world's third highest mountain, [[Kangchenjunga]] in the [[Nepal]]ese [[Himalaya]], with [[George Band]]. In 1956 he made the first ascent of the west summit of the [[Muztagh Tower]] in the [[Karakoram]] with [[Ian McNaught-Davis]]. The other members of the team, John Hartog and [[Tom Patey]], reached the main summit the next day.\n\nAs well as creating pioneering routes, he helped create new types of \"[[Climbing protection|protection]]\" to improve safety on climbs, and is acknowledged to have created some of the first \"[[Nut (climbing)|nuts]]\" by drilling the thread out of [[Nut (hardware)|engineering nut]]s and threading the centre with a [[Sling (climbing equipment)|sling]]. He started to create and improve climbing gear and in 1966 opened a shop,<ref name=\"Joe Brown Biography 2012\"/> since expanded to three shops in [[Snowdonia]] and an online presence, branded in English as \"Joe Brown shops\" and in Welsh as \"Siopau Joe Brown\".\n\n==Personal life==\nOn 17 February 1957, Brown married Valerie Melville Gray. His first daughter Helen was born in 1960 followed six years later by Zoe.

Together with his early climbing partner, Don Whillans, he was one of a new breed of post-war climbers who came from working-class backgrounds in contrast to the [[upper class|upper]] and [[middle class]] professionals who had dominated the sport up to the [[Second World War]].\n\n==Early life==\nBrown was born the seventh and last child of a family in [[Ardwick]], [[Manchester]], [[Lancashire]], England,<ref>\"Joe Brown Biography.\" /</ref> His father was a builder and merchant seaman who died in 1931 when Brown was eight months old. Brown's mother was forced to take in washing before she began work as a cleaner. In his biography, 'The Hard Years', Brown remembered being banned from the Scouts for refusing to go on a church parade and recalled how he began exploring the countryside - camping out, playing and climbing in old quarries. At around 16 he came to Kinder Downfall and, having read Colin Kirkus' 'Let's Go Climbing', he borrowed his mother's old washing line to use as a rope.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.thebmc.co.uk/legendary-climber-joe-brown-dies | title=Legendary climber Joe Brown dies | author=Ed Douglas | publisher=BMC | date=16 April 2020}}</ref>  \n\nAfter leaving school he trained as an apprentice plumber and general builder, working for a company called Archies.<ref name=\"Joe Brown Biography 2012\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20120512003631/http://www.joe-brown.com/docman/joe-brown/joe-browns-biography/download.html \"Joe Brown Biography\"] Joe-Brown.com.</ref> In 1949-50, he was [[Conscription in the United Kingdom#After 1945|enlisted]] for 18 months in the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]], where he spent his free time climbing with friends. Brown broke his leg in three places in a scrum for the tea urn but was back up and climbing three months later.<ref name=\"Joe Brown Biography 2012\" />\n\n==Climbing career==\n[[File:Joe Brown's Shop - geograph.org.uk - 1452330.jpg|thumb|right|Joe Brown shop in [[Capel Curig]]]]\nBrown, who was known as \"The Master\" and \"The Human Fly\", became famous for climbing during the 1950s. He was a member of the Valkyrie Climbing Club and founding member of the [[Rock and Ice climbing club]].<ref name=\"Thompson 2010\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Simon|title=Unjustifiable Risk?|year=2010|publisher=Cicerone|pages=207\u2013209}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/tributes-joe-brown-pioneering-climber-died-aged-89 | title=Tributes to pioneering climber Joe Brown, who has died aged 89 | work=The Guardian | date=16 April 2020}}</ref> In Hard Rock<ref>{{cite book | title=Hard Rock | author=Ken Wilson | publisher=HarperCollins | date=1980}}</ref> Ken Wilson said of Brown: \"The reader may gain some idea of his ability by studying those of his climbs featured in this book. He has brought to climbing a rare combination of attributes: keenness, patience, strength, technical ability, eye for a line, competitiveness and, above all, a subtle and mysterious charisma. Few would deny that his place in British rock climbing remains pre-eminent.\"  \n\nAn early climbing partner was [[Don Whillans]], from the neighbouring city of [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]]. They were among the first of a new breed of post-war climbers from [[working-class]] backgrounds, in contrast to the [[upper class|upper]] and [[middle class]] professionals who had dominated the sport up to the [[Second World War]]. So famous was he that the [[Post Office]] delivered a letter to him simply addressed \"The Human Fly, UK\".<ref name=\"Scott2015\">{{cite book|first = Doug |last =  Scott | title = Up and About: The Hard Road to Everest | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rgoNCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT372 | date = 2 November 2015 | publisher = Vertebrate Publishing | isbn=978-1-910240-42-7 | pages=372}}</ref>\n\nBrown established a number of new routes in [[Snowdonia]] and the [[Peak District]] that were at the leading edge of the hardest [[Grade (climbing)|grade]]s. Examples on [[Dinas Cromlech]] in the [[Llanberis Pass]] include \"Cenotaph Corner\" (1952, [[Grade (climbing)#Adjectival grade|graded E1]], with Doug Belshaw) and \"Cemetery Gates\" (1951, E1, with Don Whillans).<ref name=\"Thompson 2010\" /> \n\nBrown's mountaineering achievements in the [[Alps]] and [[Himalayas]] included many ascents in the 1950s with Whillans and other members of the Rock and Ice climbing club and, in 1955, the first ascent of the world's third highest mountain, [[Kangchenjunga]] in the [[Nepal]]ese [[Himalaya]], with [[George Band]]. In 1956 he made the first ascent of the west summit of the [[Muztagh Tower]] in the [[Karakoram]] with [[Ian McNaught-Davis]]. The other members of the team, John Hartog and [[Tom Patey]], reached the main summit the next day.\n\nAs well as creating pioneering routes, he helped create new types of \"[[Climbing protection|protection]]\" to improve safety on climbs, and is acknowledged to have created some of the first \"[[Nut (climbing)|nuts]]\" by drilling the thread out of [[Nut (hardware)|engineering nut]]s and threading the centre with a [[Sling (climbing equipment)|sling]]. He started to create and improve climbing gear and in 1966 opened a shop,<ref name=\"Joe Brown Biography 2012\"/> since expanded to three shops in [[Snowdonia]] and an online presence, branded in English as \"Joe Brown shops\" and in Welsh as \"Siopau Joe Brown\".\n\n==Personal life==\nOn 17 February 1957, Brown married Valerie Melville Gray. His first daughter Helen was born in 1960 followed six years later by Zoe.
