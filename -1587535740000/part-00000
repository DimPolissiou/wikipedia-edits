{"title_page": "Christian views on magic", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2007}}\n{{original research|date=November 2011}}\n}}\n{{short description|Christian views on magick}}\n\n'''Christian views on magick''' vary widely among [[Christian denomination|denominations]] and among individuals. Most [[Christians]] actively condemn any form of [[Magick (paranormal)|magic]] as [[satan]]ic, holding that it opens the way for [[demonic possession]]. Others simply dismiss it as [[superstition]]. Conversely, some branches of [[esoteric Christianity]] actively engage in magickal practices.\n\n==Biblical references==\n{{Main|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}\nThere are several references to [[witchcraft]] in the [[Bible]] that strongly condemn such practices. For example, {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|18:11-12|NIV}} condemns anyone who \"..casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord, and because of these detestable practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you\", and {{bibleref2|Exodus|22:18|NIV}} states \"Do not allow a sorceress to live\" (or in the [[King James Bible]] \"thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\"). It has also been suggested that the word \"witch\" might be a mistranslation of \"poisoner.\"<ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/thou-shalt-not-suffer-a-witch-to-live-a-murderous-mistranslation-1.5443682 \"Thou Shalt Not Suffer a Witch to Live: A Murderous Mistranslation?\"] by Elizabeth Sloane, at Haaretz.com, 17 August 2017.</ref> \n\nOthers point to a primitive idealist belief in a relation between bewitching and coveting, reflected in the occasional translation of the Tenth Commandment as 'Thou shalt not bewitch'.<ref>[http://apatheticagnostic.com/articles/reflections/ref04/ref065.html \"Reflections on Ethics 65: The Tenth Commandment: The Hidden Meaning of Coveting\" by Joseph Lewis (1946)], at apathetic agnostic.com, 2020.</ref> This may suggest that the prohibition related specifically to [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]] or the casting of spells to unnaturally possess something.\n\nSome adherents of near-east religions acted as [[Mediumship|mediums]], channeling messages from the dead or from a [[familiar spirit]]. The Bible sometimes is translated as referring to \"necromancer\" and \"[[necromancy]]\" ({{bibleref|Deuteronomy|18:11|KJV}}). However, some lexicographers, including [[James Strong (theologian)|James Strong]] and Spiros Zodhiates, disagree. These scholars say that the Hebrew word ''kashaph'', used in Exodus 22:18 and 5 other places in the [[Tanakh]] comes from a root meaning \"to whisper\". Strong therefore concludes that the word means \"to whisper a spell, ''i.e.'' to [[Incantation|incant]] or practice magic\". The [[Contemporary English Version]] translates {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|18:11|CEV}} as referring to \"any kind of magic\".\n\nAt the very least, older biblical prohibitions included those against '[[Magic (supernatural)|sorcery]]' to obtain something unnaturally; '[[necromancy]]' as the practice of magic or divination through demons or the dead; and any forms of malevolent '[[bewitchery]]'.\n\n==Early Christianity==\n{{See also|Early Christianity}}\n\nThe [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]]'s [[Epistle to the Galatians]] includes sorcery in a list of \"works of the flesh\".<ref>{{bibleref2|Galatians|5:19-21}}</ref> This disapproval is echoed in the ''[[Didache]]'',<ref name=Didache>{{cite book|title=Teaching of the twelve Apostles, tr. from the 'editio princeps' of Bryennios, by A.

Among [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]] concentrated in the [[Byzantine Empire]], belief in witchcraft was widely regarded as ''deisidaimonia''\u2014[[superstition]]\u2014and by the 9th and 10th centuries in the [[Western Christianity|Latin Christian West]], belief in witchcraft had begun to be seen as [[heresy]].\n\nChristian perspectives began to change with the influential writings of mystic poet [[Dante Alighieri]] and scholastic philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]], both of whom believed in [[astrology]], whilst condemning [[wikt:sorcery|sorcery]] as moral perversion.<ref>Tarrant, Neil \"Between Aquinas and Eymerich: The Roman Inquisition\u2019s Use of Dominican Thought in the Censorship of Alchemy\" Pages 210-231 | Published online: 22 Aug 2018</ref> [[Dante]] also condemned then current forms of [[alchemy]] and [[divination]], whilst [[Aquinas]] had a more nuanced and sympathetic view.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Late Middle Ages|Middle Ages]] and the beginning of the [[early modern period]] (post-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]), belief in witchcraft became more popular and witches were seen as directly in league with the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]]. This marked the beginning of a period of [[witch hunt]]s among early [[Protestantism|Protestants]] which lasted about 200 years, and in some countries, particularly in North-Western Europe, tens of thousands of people were accused of witchcraft and sentenced to death.<ref>{{cite book|author-link=Brian P.

For example, in 1610 as the result of a witch hunting craze the Suprema (the ruling council of the [[Spanish Inquisition]]) gave everybody an Edict of Grace (during which confessing witches were ''not'' to be punished) and put the only dissenting inquisitor, [[Alonso de Salazar Fr\u00edas]], in charge of the subsequent investigation. The results of Salazar's investigation was that the Spanish Inquisition did not bother witches ever again though they still went after heretics and [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto-Jews]].<ref>1978 \"A witch with three toes too many\"; Out of this World Encyclopedia 23:9-12</ref>\n\n===Martin Luther===\n[[Martin Luther]] shared some of the views about witchcraft that were common in his time.<ref>{{cite book\n | first1 = Susan C. | last1 = Karant-Nunn\n | first2 = Merry E. | last2=  Wiesner-Hanks\n | title = Luther on Women: A Sourcebook | location = Cambridge | publisher =  Cambridge U.

Both bourgeoisie and nobility of that era showed great fascination with these arts, which exerted an [[exoticism|exotic charm]] by their ascription to Arabic, Jewish, Romani, and Egyptian sources. There was great uncertainty in distinguishing practices of vain superstition, blasphemous occultism, and perfectly sound scholarly knowledge or pious ritual. The people during this time found that the existence of magic was something that could answer the questions that they could not explain through science. To them it was suggesting that while science may explain reason, magic could explain \"unreason\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dawes|first=Gregory|date=|title=The Rationality of Renaissance Magic|journal=Paregon|volume=30|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Marsilio Ficino]] advocated the existence of spiritual beings and spirits in general, though many such theories ran counter to the ideas of the later [[Age of Enlightenment]], and were treated with hostility by the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

But the reasons for disbelief differed from those of early Christians. For the early Christians the reason was theological\u2014that Christ had already defeated the powers of evil. For the post-Enlightenment Christians, the disbelief was based on a belief in [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]].\n\nIt was at this time, however, that Western Christianity began expanding to parts of Africa and Asia where premodern worldviews still held sway, and where belief in the power of witches and sorcerers to harm was, if anything, stronger than it had been in [[Northern Europe]]. Many [[African Initiated Church|African Independent Churches]] developed their own responses to witchcraft and sorcery.<ref name=\"Hayes\">Hayes, Stephen. 1995. Christian responses to witchcraft and sorcery, in Missionalia, Vol. 23(3) November.

These perspectives do not claim that witches actually consciously enter into a pact with Satan because Satan is not normally believed to exist in [[Wicca]] or other modern neo-pagan witchcraft practices.<ref name=\"Hayes\"/><ref>U.S. Department of the Army, \"Religious Requirements and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains\": \"It is very important to be aware that Wiccans do not in any way worship or believe in \"Satan\", \"the Devil\", or any similar entities.\"</ref>\n\n===Christian opposition to witchcraft===\nSeveral Christian groups continue to believe in witchcraft and view it as a negative force. Much of the criticism originates among [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] groups, especially those of a [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] tendency, who believe that witchcraft is a danger to children. The 2006 documentary ''[[Jesus Camp]]'', which depicts the life of young children attending [[Becky Fischer]]'s summer camp, shows Fischer condemning the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novels and telling the students that \"Warlocks are enemies of God\" (see also [[Religious debates over the Harry Potter series|Religious debates over the ''Harry Potter'' series]]). While Fischer's summer camp has sometimes been incorrectly identified as [[Pentecostal]], Fischer is most closely associated with the neo-Pentecostal movement known as the [[New Apostolic Reformation]]. NAR prophet Lou Engle, who serves in the NAR apostolic group The Apostolic Council of Prophetic Elders, makes an extended appearance in ''Jesus Camp''.\n\nAmong Christian tendencies, the NAR is especially aggressive in efforts to counter alleged acts of witchcraft; the NAR's globally distributed \"Transformations\" pseudo-documentaries by filmmaker George Otis, Jr. show charismatic Christians creating mini-utopias by driving off \"territorial spirits\" and by banishing or even killing accused witches. During the 2008 United States presidential election, footage surfaced from a 2005 church ceremony in which a NAR apostle, Kenyan bishop Thomas Muthee laid hands on [[Sarah Palin]] and called upon God to protect her from \"every form of witchcraft\".\n\nIn 2009, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] denounced belief in witchcraft during a visit to Angola.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7956460.stm |title=Pope warns Angola of witchcraft |date=March 21, 2009 |accessdate=2010-04-04 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\nModern Christian views vary as to whether witchcraft is a ''general'' term for communion with evil, or a ''specific'' form of religious system and practice.  Christians often espouse the idea that [[Satan]] and evil are real, while condemning accusations of witchcraft found throughout history as dubious.\n\n===Magic in literature===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2011}}\n{{See also|Religious debates over the Harry Potter series}}\nMagic in literature, while condemned by some Christians, is often viewed by Christians as non-evil. The key distinction would be between real-life magic and pretend magic. This view holds that in real life, practice of supernatural abilities (i.e. magic) must have a supernatural power source or origin, which would be either holy or evil. Thus born of Holy Spirit or of demons. (See [[Spiritual gift]] and [[Christian demonology]] for details on these teachings.) Thus, magic in the Biblical context would be viewed as only an act of evil, whereas in literature, pretend magic is a morally neutral tool available to conduct both good and bad behaviors.\n\nIn literature, magical abilities have many different power sources. Technological ability (science) can appear as magic.<ref>Arthur C. Clarke. \"Profiles of The Future\", 1961 (Clarke's third law)</ref> Often, wielding magic is accomplished by imposing one's will by concentration and/or use of devices to control an external magical force.  This explanation is offered for [[the Force]] in ''[[Star Wars]]'', magic in ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'', and magic in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. \n\nThe latter two works are by notable Christians, [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], respectively. In the first book in ''The Chronicles of Narnia'', ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'', Lewis specifically explains that magic is a power readily available in some other worlds, less so on Earth. The Empress Jadis (later, the [[White Witch]]) was tempted to use magic for selfish reasons to retain control of her world Charn, which ultimately led to the destruction of life there. Lewis related questions of the morality of magic to the same category as the morality of technology, including whether it is real, represents an 'unhealthy interest', or contravenes the basic divine plan for our universe.<ref>Matthew T. Dickerson, David O'Hara. \"Narnia and the Fields of Arbol: The Environmental Vision of C.S.Lewis\", 2009</ref> \n\nTolkien, a devout Catholic, had strict rules imposed by the ruling powers, angels who had assumed the 'raiment of earth', for the use of magic by their servants. These included a general discouragement of magic in all but exceptional circumstances, and also prohibitions against use of magic to control others, to set the self up as a political power, or to create a world that violates the natural order.<ref>Tolkien, J.R.R. 'The Istari', in \"Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-earth\", edited with commentary by Christopher Tolkien; published posthumously, George Allen & Unwin: 1980, pp.390-391.</ref>  He did however allow his wizard character to entertain children with magical fireworks. <ref>Tolkien, J.R.R. \"The Hobbit\", 1937; 4th edition, George Allen & Unwin, 1978: p.14</ref><ref>Tolkien, J.R.R. 'A long-expected party', in \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", 1954; 15th impression, George Allen & Unwin, 1966, pp. 35-36.</ref>\n\n==Syncretic religions involving Christianity and magic==\n{{See also|Christianity and Neopaganism}}\nFrom the Middle Ages, many [[Hermeticism|Hermeticists]] combined Christianity with [[occult]] practices (mostly [[alchemy]]). These Christo-pagan perspectives have a long history in the Middle East and Europe, from the [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonists]] and [[Templars]] right through to [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola|Mirandola]] in the 15th century, but also through [[freemasonry]] to the early Rosicrucian [[The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Inc.|Golden Dawn]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Another notable example of syncretism is [[Santer\u00eda]], a [[syncretism|syncretic]] hybrid of African [[animism]] and Christianity.

Most [[Christians]] actively condemn any form of [[Magick (paranormal)|magick]] as [[satan]]ic, holding that it opens the way for [[demonic possession]]. Others simply dismiss it as [[superstition]]. Conversely, some branches of [[esoteric Christianity]] actively engage in magickal practices.\n\n==Biblical references==\n{{Main|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}\nThere are several references to [[witchcraft]] in the [[Bible]] that strongly condemn such practices. For example, {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|18:11-12|NIV}} condemns anyone who \"..casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord, and because of these detestable practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you\", and {{bibleref2|Exodus|22:18|NIV}} states \"Do not allow a sorceress to live\" (or in the [[King James Bible]] \"thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\"). It has also been suggested that the word \"witch\" might be a mistranslation of \"poisoner.\"<ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/thou-shalt-not-suffer-a-witch-to-live-a-murderous-mistranslation-1.5443682 \"Thou Shalt Not Suffer a Witch to Live: A Murderous Mistranslation?\"] by Elizabeth Sloane, at Haaretz.com, 17 August 2017.</ref> \n\nOthers point to a primitive idealist belief in a relation between bewitching and coveting, reflected in the occasional translation of the Tenth Commandment as 'Thou shalt not bewitch'.<ref>[http://apatheticagnostic.com/articles/reflections/ref04/ref065.html \"Reflections on Ethics 65: The Tenth Commandment: The Hidden Meaning of Coveting\" by Joseph Lewis (1946)], at apathetic agnostic.com, 2020.</ref> This may suggest that the prohibition related specifically to [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]] or the casting of spells to unnaturally possess something.\n\nSome adherents of near-east religions acted as [[Mediumship|mediums]], channeling messages from the dead or from a [[familiar spirit]]. The Bible sometimes is translated as referring to \"necromancer\" and \"[[necromancy]]\" ({{bibleref|Deuteronomy|18:11|KJV}}). However, some lexicographers, including [[James Strong (theologian)|James Strong]] and Spiros Zodhiates, disagree. These scholars say that the Hebrew word ''kashaph'', used in Exodus 22:18 and 5 other places in the [[Tanakh]] comes from a root meaning \"to whisper\". Strong therefore concludes that the word means \"to whisper a spell, ''i.e.'' to [[Incantation|incant]] or practice magic\". The [[Contemporary English Version]] translates {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|18:11|CEV}} as referring to \"any kind of magic\".\n\nAt the very least, older biblical prohibitions included those against '[[Magic (supernatural)|sorcery]]' to obtain something unnaturally; '[[necromancy]]' as the practice of magic or divination through demons or the dead; and any forms of malevolent '[[bewitchery]]'.\n\n==Early Christianity==\n{{See also|Early Christianity}}\n\nThe [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]]'s [[Epistle to the Galatians]] includes sorcery in a list of \"works of the flesh\".<ref>{{bibleref2|Galatians|5:19-21}}</ref> This disapproval is echoed in the ''[[Didache]]'',<ref name=Didache>{{cite book|title=Teaching of the twelve Apostles, tr. from the 'editio princeps' of Bryennios, by A.

Among [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]] concentrated in the [[Byzantine Empire]], belief in witchcraft was widely regarded as ''deisidaimonia''\u2014[[superstition]]\u2014and by the 9th and 10th centuries in the [[Western Christianity|Latin Christian West]], belief in witchcraft had begun to be seen as [[heresy]].\n\nChristian perspectives began to change with the influential writings of mystic poet [[Dante Alighieri]] and scholastic philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]], both of whom believed in [[astrology]], whilst condemning [[wikt:sorcery|sorcery]] as moral perversion.<ref>Tarrant, Neil \"Between Aquinas and Eymerich: The Roman Inquisition\u2019s Use of Dominican Thought in the Censorship of Alchemy\" Pages 210-231 | Published online: 22 Aug 2018</ref> [[Dante]] also condemned then current forms of [[alchemy]] and [[divination]], whilst [[Aquinas]] had a more nuanced and sympathetic view.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Late Middle Ages|Middle Ages]] and the beginning of the [[early modern period]] (post-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]), belief in witchcraft became more popular and witches were seen as directly in league with the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]]. This marked the beginning of a period of [[witch hunt]]s among early [[Protestantism|Protestants]] which lasted about 200 years, and in some countries, particularly in North-Western Europe, tens of thousands of people were accused of witchcraft and sentenced to death.<ref>{{cite book|author-link=Brian P.

For example, in 1610 as the result of a witch hunting craze the Suprema (the ruling council of the [[Spanish Inquisition]]) gave everybody an Edict of Grace (during which confessing witches were ''not'' to be punished) and put the only dissenting inquisitor, [[Alonso de Salazar Fr\u00edas]], in charge of the subsequent investigation. The results of Salazar's investigation was that the Spanish Inquisition did not bother witches ever again though they still went after heretics and [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto-Jews]].<ref>1978 \"A witch with three toes too many\"; Out of this World Encyclopedia 23:9-12</ref>\n\n===Martin Luther===\n[[Martin Luther]] shared some of the views about witchcraft that were common in his time.<ref>{{cite book\n | first1 = Susan C. | last1 = Karant-Nunn\n | first2 = Merry E. | last2=  Wiesner-Hanks\n | title = Luther on Women: A Sourcebook | location = Cambridge | publisher =  Cambridge U.

But the reasons for disbelief differed from those of early Christians. For the early Christians the reason was theological\u2014that Christ had already defeated the powers of evil. For the post-Enlightenment Christians, the disbelief was based on a belief in [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]].\n\nIt was at this time, however, that Western Christianity began expanding to parts of Africa and Asia where premodern worldviews still held sway, and where belief in the power of witches and sorcerers to harm was, if anything, stronger than it had been in [[Northern Europe]]. Many [[African Initiated Church|African Independent Churches]] developed their own responses to witchcraft and sorcery.<ref name=\"Hayes\">Hayes, Stephen. 1995.

These perspectives do not claim that witches actually consciously enter into a pact with Satan because Satan is not normally believed to exist in [[Wicca]] or other modern neo-pagan witchcraft practices.<ref name=\"Hayes\"/><ref>U.S. Department of the Army, \"Religious Requirements and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains\": \"It is very important to be aware that Wiccans do not in any way worship or believe in \"Satan\", \"the Devil\", or any similar entities.\"</ref>\n\n===Christian opposition to witchcraft===\nSeveral Christian groups continue to believe in witchcraft and view it as a negative force. Much of the criticism originates among [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] groups, especially those of a [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] tendency, who believe that witchcraft is a danger to children. The 2006 documentary ''[[Jesus Camp]]'', which depicts the life of young children attending [[Becky Fischer]]'s summer camp, shows Fischer condemning the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novels and telling the students that \"Warlocks are enemies of God\" (see also [[Religious debates over the Harry Potter series|Religious debates over the ''Harry Potter'' series]]). While Fischer's summer camp has sometimes been incorrectly identified as [[Pentecostal]], Fischer is most closely associated with the neo-Pentecostal movement known as the [[New Apostolic Reformation]]. NAR prophet Lou Engle, who serves in the NAR apostolic group The Apostolic Council of Prophetic Elders, makes an extended appearance in ''Jesus Camp''.\n\nAmong Christian tendencies, the NAR is especially aggressive in efforts to counter alleged acts of witchcraft; the NAR's globally distributed \"Transformations\" pseudo-documentaries by filmmaker George Otis, Jr. show charismatic Christians creating mini-utopias by driving off \"territorial spirits\" and by banishing or even killing accused witches. During the 2008 United States presidential election, footage surfaced from a 2005 church ceremony in which a NAR apostle, Kenyan bishop Thomas Muthee laid hands on [[Sarah Palin]] and called upon God to protect her from \"every form of witchcraft\".\n\nIn 2009, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] denounced belief in witchcraft during a visit to Angola.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7956460.stm |title=Pope warns Angola of witchcraft |date=March 21, 2009 |accessdate=2010-04-04 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\nModern Christian views vary as to whether witchcraft is a ''general'' term for communion with evil, or a ''specific'' form of religious system and practice.  Christians often espouse the idea that [[Satan]] and evil are real, while condemning accusations of witchcraft found throughout history as dubious.\n\n===Magic in literature===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2011}}\n{{See also|Religious debates over the Harry Potter series}}\nMagic in literature, while condemned by some Christians, is often viewed by Christians as non-evil. The key distinction would be between real-life magic and pretend magic. This view holds that in real life, practice of supernatural abilities (i.e. magic) must have a supernatural power source or origin, which would be either holy or evil. Thus born of Holy Spirit or of demons. (See [[Spiritual gift]] and [[Christian demonology]] for details on these teachings.) Thus, magic in the Biblical context would be viewed as only an act of evil, whereas in literature, pretend magic is a morally neutral tool available to conduct both good and bad behaviors.\n\nIn literature, magical abilities have many different power sources. Technological ability (science) can appear as magic.<ref>Arthur C. Clarke. \"Profiles of The Future\", 1961 (Clarke's third law)</ref> Often, wielding magic is accomplished by imposing one's will by concentration and/or use of devices to control an external magical force.  This explanation is offered for [[the Force]] in ''[[Star Wars]]'', magic in ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'', and magic in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. \n\nThe latter two works are by notable Christians, [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], respectively. In the first book in ''The Chronicles of Narnia'', ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'', Lewis specifically explains that magic is a power readily available in some other worlds, less so on Earth. The Empress Jadis (later, the [[White Witch]]) was tempted to use magic for selfish reasons to retain control of her world Charn, which ultimately led to the destruction of life there. Lewis related questions of the morality of magic to the same category as the morality of technology, including whether it is real, represents an 'unhealthy interest', or contravenes the basic divine plan for our universe.<ref>Matthew T. Dickerson, David O'Hara. \"Narnia and the Fields of Arbol: The Environmental Vision of C.S.Lewis\", 2009</ref> \n\nTolkien, a devout Catholic, had strict rules imposed by the ruling powers, angels who had assumed the 'raiment of earth', for the use of magic by their servants. These included a general discouragement of magic in all but exceptional circumstances, and also prohibitions against use of magic to control others, to set the self up as a political power, or to create a world that violates the natural order.<ref>Tolkien, J.R.R. 'The Istari', in \"Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-earth\", edited with commentary by Christopher Tolkien; published posthumously, George Allen & Unwin: 1980, pp.390-391.</ref>  He did however allow his wizard character to entertain children with magical fireworks. <ref>Tolkien, J.R.R. \"The Hobbit\", 1937; 4th edition, George Allen & Unwin, 1978: p.14</ref><ref>Tolkien, J.R.R. 'A long-expected party', in \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", 1954; 15th impression, George Allen & Unwin, 1966, pp. 35-36.</ref>\n\n==Syncretic religions involving Christianity and magic==\n{{See also|Christianity and Neopaganism}}\nFrom the Middle Ages, many [[Hermeticism|Hermeticists]] combined Christianity with [[occult]] practices (mostly [[alchemy]]). These Christo-pagan perspectives have a long history in the Middle East and Europe, from the [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonists]] and [[Templars]] right through to [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola|Mirandola]] in the 15th century, but also through [[freemasonry]] to the early Rosicrucian [[The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Inc.|Golden Dawn]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Another notable example of syncretism is [[Santer\u00eda]], a [[syncretism|syncretic]] hybrid of African [[animism]] and Christianity. There are also those who practice from a combination of Neopagan/Wiccan and Christian perspectives, as for example in [[Christian Wicca]] or in some [[Gaianism|Gaian 'Goddess' communities]]. Other modern syncretic traditions include mesoamerican folk healing traditions, such as the [[Curandero|''curanderismo'']] practices found in Mexico, and Andean folk healing traditions of Peru and Bolivia.\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Evelyn Underhill]] - Anglican mystic, member of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].\n*[[Arthur Machen]] - Anglican writer, member of the HOGD\n*[[Charles_Williams_(British_writer)|Charles Williams]] - Anglican theologian, mystic, member of the [[Fellowship of the Rosy Cross]].\n*[[Robert Felkin]] - Anglican missionary, ceremonical magician and occult writer, chief of the [[Stella Matutina]]\n*Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] - Author and \"[[Spiritualism (beliefs)|Christian Spiritualist]]\"\n*[[Rosicrucianism]] and [[Rose Cross]]\n* [[Thomas Ady]]\n* [[Benedicaria]]\n* [[Christianity and neopaganism]]\n* [[Christianity and Paganism]]\n* [[Christian Kabbalah]]\n* [[Christian views on astrology]]\n* [[Christian views on Freemasonry]]\n* ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]: Science as a Candle in the Dark''\n* ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]''\n*[[Enochian magic]]\n* [[Esoteric Christianity]]\n* [[Folk Catholicism]]\n* [[Folk religion#Folk Christianity|Folk Christianity]]\n* [[Magic and religion]]\n* ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]''\n* [[Nehushtan]]\n* [[Anton Praetorius]]\n* ''[[Saducismus Triumphatus]]''\n* ''[[Wonders of the Invisible World]]''\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Cohn\n  | first = Norman\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Europe's inner demons\n  | publisher = Sussex University Press\n  | year = 1975\n  | location = London\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 0-435-82183-0 }}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Fox\n  | first = Robin Lane\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Pagans and Christians\n  | publisher = Knopf\n  | year = 1987\n  | location = New York\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 0-394-55495-7 }}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Hutton\n  | first = Ronald\n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Pagan religions of the ancient British Isles\n  | publisher = Blackwell\n  | year = 1991\n  | location = Oxford\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780631172888\n  | doi = \n  | isbn = 0-631-17288-2\n  | url-access = registration\n  }}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Williams\n  | first = Charles\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Witchcraft\n  | publisher = Meridian\n  | year = 1959\n  | location = New York\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =  }}\n\n==Further reading==\n''Ancient Christian Magic: Coptic Texts of Ritual Power'' by Marvin W.

The Fortescue family ([[Earl Fortescue]]) were lords of the manor of Filleigh, in which parish is situated their former seat, [[Castle Hill, Filleigh|Castle Hill]]. The last Fortescue to own Castle Hill was Lady Margaret Fortescue (1923-2013), eldest daughter and co-heiress of [[Hugh Fortescue, 5th Earl Fortescue]] (1888-1958), although now owned by her daughter Eleanor, Countess of Arran (n\u00e9e van Cutsem) who lives there with her husband [[Arthur Gore, 9th Earl of Arran]]]]\nThe [[landed gentry]] and [[nobility]] of [[Devonshire]], like the rest of the English and European gentry, bore [[heraldry|heraldic arms]] from the start of the age of heraldry ''circa'' 1200-1215. The fashion for the display of heraldry ceased about the end of the [[Victorian era]] (1901) by which time most of the ancient armigerous families of Devonshire had died out, moved away or parted with their landed estates.<ref>For a discussion of the disappearance of the old gentry families of Devon, see [[Sabine Baring-Gould]], ''Old Country Life'', first published 1889, 5th ed., 1894, pp.7-22, ''Old County Families''[https://archive.org/details/oldcountrylife00bari]</ref> \n\nToday a very few ancient families remain in the county represented by direct male descendants, most notably [[Earl of Devon|Courtenay]] of [[Manor of Powderham|Powderham]], Fulford of [[Great Fulford|Fulford]],  Kelly of Kelly, Cruwys of [[Cruwys Morchard]], [[Baron Clifford|Clifford]] of [[Chudleigh]], [[Acland Baronets|Acland]] of [[Killerton]] and [[Broadclyst]], [[Wrey Baronets|Wrey]] of [[Tawstock]], etc. A few ancient Devon estates are still owned by descendants via female lines, for example [[Castle Hill, Filleigh]], [[Manor of Molland|Molland]], [[Incledon, Braunton]], [[Hall, Bishop's Tawton]], [[Newnham Park]], etc. In most cases the laws of English heraldry preclude the transmission of paternal armorials via a female heiress (other than in the form of [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartering]]), thus most of these inheritors via female lines, generally deriving from the same pool of high-status English armigerous families, bring their own paternal heraldry, possibly previously foreign to Devon, to the estates inherited. \n\nFor example, the Irish arms of Gore ([[Earl of Arran (Ireland)|Earl of Arran]]) are now associated with [[Castle Hill, Filleigh]], until 1958 the seat of the last male representative of the [[Earl Fortescue|Fortescue family]] which originated in Devon in the 12th century. In a few cases however, male heirs via female lines have been required by the legator to seek royal licence to adopt his own arms and surname, otherwise destined to disappearance, in lieu of the legatees own. This was the case with the families most notably of [[Mark Rolle|Rolle]], [[Basset family|Basset]], [[Stucley Baronets|Stucley]], [[Bradfield House|Walrond]], etc.\n\n{{Compact ToC |pre1=Standard sources |pre2=List of Devon arms |prebreak=yes |custom1=Blazons by Sir William Pole  |notes=yes|seealso=yes|x=|z=}}\n\n==Standard sources==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}\nThe standard sources for students of the '''heraldry of Devon''' are as follows:\n\n===Documents===\n*[[Heraldic visitation|Heraldic Visitations]] of Devon: [[John Lambrick Vivian|Vivian, Lt.Col.

As for the arms of Courtenay: \"the stamp of whose almost princely authority may be extensively recognised throughout the county\" (Davidson).<ref>Quoted by [[William Henry Hamilton Rogers|Rogers, William Henry Hamilton]], Memorials of the West, Historical and Descriptive, Collected on the Borderland of Somerset, Dorset and Devon, Exeter, 1888, p.351 [https://archive.org/stream/memorialsofwesth00roge#page/n415/mode/2up]</ref> Frequently discrepancies between these sources exist. Painted monuments in parish churches often have been restored, in some cases several times over the centuries, and the arms depicted may not be as originally painted. Heraldry sculpted in relief on stone is liable to wear and crumbling, especially when placed in the favourite location, exposed to the elements for centuries, on the porch or gatehouse of the family mansion. Ancient [[monumental brass]]es do not show tinctures but otherwise provide lasting records of heraldry. Stained glass depictions are optimal sources as they include tinctures, but ancient survivals are rare. Mural monuments placed high up on walls generally survive vandalism of past ages whilst paintings of arms on escutcheons sculpted in stone on mediaeval [[chest tomb]]s have rarely survived and often were \"scraped\" clean of all decoration in the 17th century. Heraldic monuments displaying a family's arms are generally found in the church of the parish in which is situated their seat, but the paternal arms may also be found in remoter parish churches where a daughter of the family has married into a family resident there. In such a case the arms are shown [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaled]] by the arms of her husband. Clearly the greatest problems in tracing heraldry relate to long extinct families. A few ancient Devon families survive, such as the Fortescues, and a flag showing the Fortescue arms still flies above [[Castle Hill, Filleigh|Castle Hill]] in 2013. There is no shortage of surviving examples of the arms of the Chichesters and Rolles, but surviving heraldry of the ancient Courtenay Earls of Devon seated at Tiverton Castle is rare, although frequently shown as [[Quartering (heraldry)|quarterings]] in the arms of related families.\n\n==List of Devon arms==\nThe following [[Heraldry|armorials]] are listed in the [[Heraldic visitation|Heraldic Visitations]] of Devon, 1531, 1564 & 1620:{{sfn|Vivian|1895}}\n{{Expand list|date=May 2013}}\n\n===A===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, mention is made of [[Week St Mary]] (in Cornwall), 13 miles south of Welcombe near Hartland, and the Roache family originated in \"Lesawnte\" ([[Lezant]]?, Cornwall. Lysons, Magna Britannia, Cornwall, Extinct Gentry, states: \"Roche or De la Rupe of Roche \u2014 traced to the reign of Richard I. Hals says, that this family became extinct, in the male line, in 1357; that Sir William Blundell, husband of the heiress, took the name of Roche, which continued till the reign of Henry VIII., when the last of the family left four daughters, three of whom married Fortescue, Penkevil, and Boscawen.

This house, later known as the \"Abbot's Lodge\", was destroyed in 1942 during [[World War II]] bombing. It had been the townhouse of the Abbot of [[Buckfast Abbey]], which Abbey and much of its lands, apparently excluding the Abbot's Lodge, had been acquired following the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] by Sir [[Thomas Denys]] (c.1477-1561) of [[Holcombe Burnell]], whose eventual heir (by coincidence) was the Rolle family. It was at the Abbot's Lodge that the Grand Duke of Tuscany was entertained by Sir John Rolle in 1669 and it remained in the Rolle family until 1737 when it was sold to the Rev.

The Fortescue family ([[Earl Fortescue]]) were lords of the manor of Filleigh, in which parish is situated their former seat, [[Castle Hill, Filleigh|Castle Hill]]. The last Fortescue to own Castle Hill was Lady Margaret Fortescue (1923-2013), eldest daughter and co-heiress of [[Hugh Fortescue, 5th Earl Fortescue]] (1888-1958), although now owned by her daughter Eleanor, Countess of Arran (n\u00e9e van Cutsem) who lives there with her husband [[Arthur Gore, 9th Earl of Arran]]]]\nThe [[landed gentry]] and [[nobility]] of [[Devonshire]], like the rest of the English and European gentry, bore [[heraldry|heraldic arms]] from the start of the age of heraldry ''circa'' 1200-1215. The fashion for the display of heraldry ceased about the end of the [[Victorian era]] (1901) by which time most of the ancient armigerous families of Devonshire had died out, moved away or parted with their landed estates.<ref>For a discussion of the disappearance of the old gentry families of Devon, see [[Sabine Baring-Gould]], ''Old Country Life'', first published 1889, 5th ed., 1894, pp.7-22, ''Old County Families''[https://archive.org/details/oldcountrylife00bari]</ref> \n\nToday a very few ancient families remain in the county represented by direct male descendants, most notably [[Earl of Devon|Courtenay]] of [[Manor of Powderham|Powderham]], Fulford of [[Great Fulford|Fulford]],  Kelly of Kelly, Cruwys of [[Cruwys Morchard]], [[Baron Clifford|Clifford]] of [[Chudleigh]], [[Acland Baronets|Acland]] of [[Killerton]] and [[Broadclyst]], [[Wrey Baronets|Wrey]] of [[Tawstock]], etc. A few ancient Devon estates are still owned by descendants via female lines, for example [[Castle Hill, Filleigh]], [[Manor of Molland|Molland]], [[Incledon, Braunton]], [[Hall, Bishop's Tawton]], [[Newnham Park]], etc. In most cases the laws of English heraldry preclude the transmission of paternal armorials via a female heiress (other than in the form of [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartering]]), thus most of these inheritors via female lines, generally deriving from the same pool of high-status English armigerous families, bring their own paternal heraldry, possibly previously foreign to Devon, to the estates inherited. \n\nFor example, the Irish arms of Gore ([[Earl of Arran (Ireland)|Earl of Arran]]) are now associated with [[Castle Hill, Filleigh]], until 1958 the seat of the last male representative of the [[Earl Fortescue|Fortescue family]] which originated in Devon in the 12th century. In a few cases however, male heirs via female lines have been required by the legator to seek royal licence to adopt his own arms and surname, otherwise destined to disappearance, in lieu of the legatees own. This was the case with the families most notably of [[Mark Rolle|Rolle]], [[Basset family|Basset]], [[Stucley Baronets|Stucley]], [[Bradfield House|Walrond]], etc.\n\n{{Compact ToC |pre1=Standard sources |pre2=List of Devon arms |prebreak=yes |custom1=Blazons by Sir William Pole  |notes=yes|seealso=yes|x=|z=}}\n\n==Standard sources==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}\nThe standard sources for students of the '''heraldry of Devon''' are as follows:\n\n===Documents===\n*[[Heraldic visitation|Heraldic Visitations]] of Devon: [[John Lambrick Vivian|Vivian, Lt.Col.

As for the arms of Courtenay: \"the stamp of whose almost princely authority may be extensively recognised throughout the county\" (Davidson).<ref>Quoted by [[William Henry Hamilton Rogers|Rogers, William Henry Hamilton]], Memorials of the West, Historical and Descriptive, Collected on the Borderland of Somerset, Dorset and Devon, Exeter, 1888, p.351 [https://archive.org/stream/memorialsofwesth00roge#page/n415/mode/2up]</ref> Frequently discrepancies between these sources exist. Painted monuments in parish churches often have been restored, in some cases several times over the centuries, and the arms depicted may not be as originally painted. Heraldry sculpted in relief on stone is liable to wear and crumbling, especially when placed in the favourite location, exposed to the elements for centuries, on the porch or gatehouse of the family mansion. Ancient [[monumental brass]]es do not show tinctures but otherwise provide lasting records of heraldry. Stained glass depictions are optimal sources as they include tinctures, but ancient survivals are rare. Mural monuments placed high up on walls generally survive vandalism of past ages whilst paintings of arms on escutcheons sculpted in stone on mediaeval [[chest tomb]]s have rarely survived and often were \"scraped\" clean of all decoration in the 17th century. Heraldic monuments displaying a family's arms are generally found in the church of the parish in which is situated their seat, but the paternal arms may also be found in remoter parish churches where a daughter of the family has married into a family resident there. In such a case the arms are shown [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaled]] by the arms of her husband. Clearly the greatest problems in tracing heraldry relate to long extinct families. A few ancient Devon families survive, such as the Fortescues, and a flag showing the Fortescue arms still flies above [[Castle Hill, Filleigh|Castle Hill]] in 2013. There is no shortage of surviving examples of the arms of the Chichesters and Rolles, but surviving heraldry of the ancient Courtenay Earls of Devon seated at Tiverton Castle is rare, although frequently shown as [[Quartering (heraldry)|quarterings]] in the arms of related families.\n\n==List of Devon arms==\nThe following [[Heraldry|armorials]] are listed in the [[Heraldic visitation|Heraldic Visitations]] of Devon, 1531, 1564 & 1620:{{sfn|Vivian|1895}}\n{{Expand list|date=May 2013}}\n\n===A===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This house, later known as the \"Abbot's Lodge\", was destroyed in 1942 during [[World War II]] bombing. It had been the townhouse of the Abbot of [[Buckfast Abbey]], which Abbey and much of its lands, apparently excluding the Abbot's Lodge, had been acquired following the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] by Sir [[Thomas Denys]] (c.1477-1561) of [[Holcombe Burnell]], whose eventual heir (by coincidence) was the Rolle family.

He wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval, and is best known for his [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667), written in [[blank verse]], and widely considered to be one of the greatest works of literature ever written.\n\nWriting in English, Latin, Greek, and Italian, he achieved international renown within his lifetime; his celebrated ''[[Areopagitica]]'' (1644), written in condemnation of [[Prior restraint|pre-publication censorship]], is among history's most influential and impassioned defences of [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]]. His desire for freedom extended into his style: he introduced new words (coined from Latin) to the English language, and was the first modern writer to employ unrhymed verse outside of the theatre or translations.\n\n[[William Hayley]]'s 1796 biography called him the \"greatest English author\",<ref>McCalman 2001 p. 605.</ref> and he remains generally regarded \"as one of the preeminent writers in the English language\",<ref>''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. [http://www.enotes.com/literary-criticism/milton-john \"Milton, John \u2013 Introduction\"].</ref> though critical reception has oscillated in the centuries since his death (often on account of his [[republicanism]]). [[Samuel Johnson]] praised ''Paradise Lost'' as \"a poem which...with respect to design may claim the first place, and with respect to performance, the second, among the productions of the human mind\", though he (a [[Tory]] and recipient of royal patronage) described Milton's politics as those of an \"acrimonious and surly republican\".<ref name=Works>{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Arthur|title=The Works of Samuel Johnson, LL.

Milton studied, travelled, wrote poetry mostly for private circulation, and launched a career as pamphleteer and publicist under the increasingly personal rule of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and its breakdown into constitutional confusion and war. The shift in accepted attitudes in government placed him in public office under the [[Commonwealth of England]], from being thought dangerously radical and even heretical, and he even acted as an official spokesman in certain of his publications. The [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of 1660 deprived Milton, now completely blind, of his public platform, but this period saw him complete most of his major works of poetry.\n\nMilton's views developed from his very extensive reading, as well as travel and experience, from his student days of the 1620s to the [[English Civil War]].<ref>Masson 1859 pp. v\u2013vi.</ref> By the time of his death in 1674, Milton was impoverished and on the margins of English intellectual life, yet famous throughout Europe and unrepentant for his political choices.\n\n===Early life===\n{{Main|Early life of John Milton}}\n[[File:John Milton plaque Bread Street London.jpg|thumb|left|Blue plaque in Bread Street, London, where Milton was born]]\n\nJohn Milton was born in Bread Street, London on 9 December 1608, the son of composer [[John Milton (composer)|John Milton]] and his wife Sarah Jeffrey. The senior John Milton (1562\u20131647) moved to London around 1583 after being disinherited by his devout Catholic father Richard \"the Ranger\" Milton for embracing Protestantism.<ref name=\":3\" /> In London, the senior John Milton married Sarah Jeffrey (1572\u20131637) and found lasting financial success as a [[scrivener]].<ref name=Forsyth16>{{cite book |last=Forsyth |first=Neil |title=John Milton A Biography |edition=1st |year=2008 |publisher=[[Lion Hudson]] |location=Wilkinson House, Jordan Hill Road, Oxford OX2 8DR, England |isbn=978-0-7459-5310-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/johnmiltonbiogra0000fors/page/16 16] |chapter=St. Paul's |url=https://archive.org/details/johnmiltonbiogra0000fors/page/16 }}</ref> He lived in and worked from a house on [[Bread Street]], where the [[Mermaid Tavern]] was located in [[Cheapside]]. The elder Milton was noted for his skill as a musical composer, and this talent left his son with a lifelong appreciation for music and friendships with musicians such as [[Henry Lawes]].<ref>Lewalski 2003 p. 3.</ref>\n\nMilton's father's prosperity provided his eldest son with a private tutor, [[Thomas Young (1587\u20131655)|Thomas Young]], a Scottish Presbyterian with an M.A. from the University of St. Andrews. Research suggests that Young's influence served as the poet's introduction to religious radicalism.<ref>Skerpan-Wheeler, Elizabeth. \"John Milton.\" British Rhetoricians and Logicians, 1500\u20131660: Second Series. Ed. Edward A. Malone. Detroit: Gale, 2003. Dictionary of Literary Biography Vol. 281. Literature Resource Center.</ref> After Young's tutorship, Milton attended [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in London. There he began the study of Latin and Greek, and the classical languages left an imprint on both his poetry and prose in English (he also wrote in Italian and Latin).\n\n[[File:John Milton portrait.jpg|thumb|John Milton at age 10 by [[Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen]]. In [[Milton's Cottage]], [[Chalfont St Giles]].]]\n\nMilton's first datable compositions are two psalms done at age 15 at [[Long Bennington]]. One contemporary source is the ''[[Brief Lives]]'' of [[John Aubrey]], an uneven compilation including first-hand reports. In the work, Aubrey quotes Christopher, Milton's younger brother: \"When he was young, he studied very hard and sat up very late, commonly till twelve or one o'clock at night\". Aubrey adds, \"\"His complexion exceeding faire\u2014he was so faire that they called him the Lady of Christ's College.\"<ref name=OLD>Dick 1962 pp. 270\u201375.</ref>\n\nIn 1625, Milton began attending [[Christ's College, Cambridge]]. He graduated with a B.A. in 1629,<ref>{{acad|id=MLTN624J|name=Milton, John}}</ref> ranking fourth of 24&nbsp;honours graduates that year in the University of Cambridge.<ref>Hunter 1980 p. 99.</ref> Preparing to become an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest, Milton stayed on and obtained his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts degree]] on 3 July 1632.\n\nMilton may have been [[rustication (academia)|rusticated]] (suspended) in his first year for quarrelling with his tutor, Bishop [[William Chappell (bishop)|William Chappell]]. He was certainly at home in London in the Lent Term 1626; there he wrote his ''Elegia Prima'', a first Latin [[elegy]], to Charles Diodati, a friend from St Paul's. Based on remarks of [[John Aubrey]], Chappell \"whipt\" Milton.<ref name=OLD/> This story is now disputed, though certainly Milton disliked Chappell.<ref>Wedgwood 1961 p. 178.</ref> Historian [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] cautiously notes that Milton was \"apparently\" rusticated, and that the differences between Chappell and Milton may have been either religious or personal.<ref>Hill 1977 p. 34.</ref> It is also possible that, like [[Isaac Newton]] four decades later, Milton was sent home because of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], by which Cambridge was badly affected in 1625. In 1626, Milton's tutor was Nathaniel Tovey.\n\nAt Cambridge, Milton was on good terms with [[Edward King (British poet)|Edward King]], for whom he later wrote \"[[Lycidas]]\". He also befriended Anglo-American dissident and theologian [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]. Milton tutored Williams in Hebrew in exchange for lessons in Dutch.<ref>Pfeiffer 1955 pp. 363\u201373.</ref> Despite developing a reputation for poetic skill and general erudition, Milton experienced alienation from his peers and university life as a whole. Having once watched his fellow students attempting comedy upon the college stage, he later observed 'they thought themselves gallant men, and I thought them fools'.<ref>Milton 1959 pp. 887\u201388.</ref>\n\nMilton was disdainful of the university curriculum, which consisted of stilted formal debates conducted in Latin on abstruse topics. His own corpus is not devoid of humour, notably his sixth [[wikt:prolusion|prolusion]] and his epitaphs on the death of [[Thomas Hobson]]. While at Cambridge, he wrote a number of his well-known shorter English poems, among them \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity\", his \"Epitaph on the admirable Dramaticke Poet, W. Shakespeare\" (his first poem to appear in print), ''[[L'Allegro]]'', and ''[[Il Penseroso]]''.\n\n===Study, poetry, and travel===\n{{Details|Early life of John Milton}}\n{{quote box\n|width=40%\n|quote=It appears in all his writings that he had the usual concomitant of great abilities, a lofty and steady confidence in himself, perhaps not without some contempt of others; for scarcely any man ever wrote so much, and praised so few. Of his praise he was very frugal; as he set its value high, and considered his mention of a name as a security against the waste of time, and a certain preservative from oblivion.<ref>Johnson 1826 Vol. I. p. 64.</ref>\n|source=\u2013 [[Samuel Johnson]], ''[[Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets]]''\n}}\n\nUpon receiving his M.A. in 1632, Milton retired to [[Hammersmith]], his father's new home since the previous year. He also lived at [[Horton, Berkshire|Horton]], Berkshire, from 1635 and undertook six years of self-directed private study. Hill argues that this was not retreat into a rural idyll; Hammersmith was then a \"suburban village\" falling into the orbit of London, and even Horton was becoming deforested and suffered from the plague.<ref>Hill 1977 p. 38.</ref> He read both ancient and modern works of theology, philosophy, history, politics, literature, and science in preparation for a prospective poetical career. Milton's intellectual development can be charted via entries in his [[commonplace book]] (like a scrapbook), now in the [[British Library]]. As a result of such intensive study, Milton is considered to be among the most learned of all English poets. In addition to his years of private study, Milton had command of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, Spanish, and Italian from his school and undergraduate days; he also added Old English to his linguistic repertoire in the 1650s while researching his ''History of Britain'', and probably acquired proficiency in Dutch soon after.<ref>Lewalski 2003 p. 103.</ref>\n\n[[File:John Milton plaque Berkyn Manor Farm Horton.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Commemorative blue plaque 'John Milton lived here 1632\u20131638' at Berkyn Manor Farm, [[Horton, Berkshire]]]]\n\nMilton continued to write poetry during this period of study; his ''[[Arcades (Milton)|Arcades]]'' and ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'' were both commissioned for [[masques]] composed for noble patrons, connections of the Egerton family, and performed in 1632 and 1634 respectively. ''Comus'' argues for the virtuousness of [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] and [[chastity]].  He contributed his [[pastoral]] [[elegy]] ''[[Lycidas]]'' to a memorial collection for one of his fellow-students at Cambridge.  Drafts of these poems are preserved in Milton's poetry notebook, known as the Trinity Manuscript because it is now kept at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], Cambridge.\n\nIn May 1638, Milton embarked upon a tour of France and Italy that lasted until July or August 1639.<ref>Chaney 1985 and 2000.</ref> His travels supplemented his study with new and direct experience of artistic and religious traditions, especially Roman Catholicism. He met famous theorists and intellectuals of the time, and was able to display his poetic skills. For specific details of what happened within Milton's \"[[grand tour]]\", there appears to be just one [[primary source]]: Milton's own ''[[Defensio Secunda]]''. There are other records, including some letters and some references in his other prose tracts, but the bulk of the information about the tour comes from a work that, according to [[Barbara Lewalski]], \"was not intended as autobiography but as rhetoric, designed to emphasise his sterling reputation with the learned of Europe.\"<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 87\u201388.</ref>\n\nHe first went to [[Calais]] and then on to Paris, riding horseback, with a letter from diplomat [[Henry Wotton]] to ambassador [[John Scudamore (ambassador)|John Scudamore]]. Through Scudamore, Milton met [[Hugo Grotius]], a Dutch law philosopher, playwright, and poet. Milton left France soon after this meeting. He travelled south from [[Nice, France|Nice]] to [[Genoa]], and then to [[Livorno]] and [[Pisa]]. He reached Florence in July 1638. While there, Milton enjoyed many of the sites and structures of the city. His candour of manner and erudite neo-Latin poetry earned him friends in Florentine intellectual circles, and he met the astronomer [[Galileo]] who was under [[house arrest]] at [[Arcetri]], as well as others.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 88\u201394.</ref> Milton probably visited the Florentine Academy and the [[Accademia della Crusca]] along with smaller academies in the area, including the Apatisti and the [[Svogliati]].\n\n{{quote box |width=40% |quote=In [Florence], which I have always admired above all others because of the elegance, not just of its tongue, but also of its wit, I lingered for about two months. There I at once became the friend of many gentlemen eminent in rank and learning, whose private academies I frequented\u2014a Florentine institution which deserves great praise not only for promoting humane studies but also for encouraging friendly intercourse.<ref>Milton 1959 Vol. IV part I. pp. 615\u201317.</ref> |source=\u2013 Milton's account of Florence in ''Defensio Secunda''}}\n\nHe left Florence in September to continue to Rome. With the connections from Florence, Milton was able to have easy access to Rome's intellectual society. His poetic abilities impressed those like Giovanni Salzilli, who praised Milton within an epigram. In late October, Milton attended a dinner given by the [[English College, Rome]], despite his dislike for the [[Society of Jesus]], meeting English Catholics who were also guests\u2014theologian [[Henry Holden]] and the poet [[Patrick Cary]].<ref>Chaney 1985 and 2000 and Lewalski p. 96.</ref> He also attended musical events, including oratorios, operas, and melodramas. Milton left for [[Naples]] toward the end of November, where he stayed only for a month because of the Spanish control.<ref>Chaney 1985 p. 244\u201351 and Chaney 2000 p. 313.</ref> During that time, he was introduced to Giovanni Battista Manso, patron to both [[Torquato Tasso]] and to [[Giambattista Marino]].<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 94\u201398.</ref>\n\nOriginally, Milton wanted to leave Naples in order to travel to [[Sicily]] and then on to Greece, but he returned to England during the summer of 1639 because of what he claimed in ''Defensio Secunda''<ref>Lewalski 2003 p. 98.</ref> were \"sad tidings of civil war in England.\"<ref>Milton 1959 Vol. IV part I pp. 618\u201319.</ref> Matters became more complicated when Milton received word that his childhood friend Diodati had died. Milton in fact stayed another seven months on the continent, and spent time at [[Geneva]] with Diodati's uncle after he returned to Rome. In ''Defensio Secunda'', Milton proclaimed that he was warned against a return to Rome because of his frankness about religion, but he stayed in the city for two months and was able to experience [[Carnival]] and meet [[Lukas Holste]], a Vatican librarian who guided Milton through its collection. He was introduced to Cardinal [[Francesco Barberini (1597\u20131679)|Francesco Barberini]] who invited Milton to an opera hosted by the Cardinal. Around March, Milton travelled once again to Florence, staying there for two months, attending further meetings of the academies, and spending time with friends. After leaving Florence, he travelled through Lucca, Bologna, and Ferrara before coming to [[Venice]]. In Venice, Milton was exposed to a model of Republicanism, later important in his political writings, but he soon found another model when he travelled to Geneva. From Switzerland, Milton travelled to Paris and then to Calais before finally arriving back in England in either July or August 1639.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 99\u2013109.</ref>\n\n===Civil war, prose tracts, and marriage===\n{{Main|Milton's antiprelatical tracts}}\n[[File:Areopagitica bridwell.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Title page of the 1644 edition of ''[[Areopagitica]]'']]\n\nOn returning to England where the [[Bishops' Wars]] presaged further armed conflict, Milton began to write prose [[tract (literature)|tracts]] against [[episcopacy]], in the service of the [[Puritan]] and [[Long Parliament|Parliamentary]] cause. Milton's first foray into polemics was ''Of Reformation touching Church Discipline in England'' (1641), followed by ''Of Prelatical Episcopacy'', the two defences of [[Smectymnuus]] (a group of Presbyterian divines named from their initials; the \"TY\" belonged to Milton's old tutor Thomas Young), and ''[[The Reason of Church-Government Urged against Prelaty]]''. He vigorously attacked the High-church party of the Church of England and their leader [[William Laud]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], with frequent passages of real eloquence lighting up the rough controversial style of the period, and deploying a wide knowledge of church history.\n\nHe was supported by his father's investments, but Milton became a private schoolmaster at this time, educating his nephews and other children of the well-to-do. This experience and discussions with educational reformer [[Samuel Hartlib]] led him to write his short tract ''[[Of Education]]'' in 1644, urging a reform of the national universities.\n\nIn June 1642, Milton paid a visit to the manor house at [[Forest Hill, Oxfordshire]], and returned with 16-year-old bride Mary Powell.<ref name=\"ODNB Milton\">{{cite journal|first=Gordon|last=Campbell|title=Milton, John (1608\u20131674)|journal=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|volume=1|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|edition=Online|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18800|accessdate=25 October 2013|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/18800}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref><ref>Lobel 1957 pp. 122\u201334.</ref> Mary found life difficult with the severe 35-year-old schoolmaster and pamphleteer, and she returned to her family a month later. She did not return until 1645, partly because of the outbreak of the [[First English Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\"ODNB Milton\"/>\n\nIn the meantime, her desertion prompted Milton to publish [[Milton's divorce tracts|a series of pamphlets]] over the next three years arguing for the legality and morality of divorce. ([[Anna Beer]], one of Milton's most recent biographers, points to a lack of evidence and the dangers of cynicism in urging that it was not necessarily the case that the private life so animated the public polemicising.) In 1643, Milton had a brush with the authorities over these writings, in parallel with [[Hezekiah Woodward]], who had more trouble.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 181\u201382, 600.</ref> It was the hostile response accorded the divorce tracts that spurred Milton to write ''[[Areopagitica|Areopagitica; A speech of Mr. John Milton for the Liberty of Unlicenc'd Printing, to the Parlament of England]]'', his celebrated attack on pre-printing censorship.  In ''Areopagitica'', Milton aligns himself with the parliamentary cause, and he also begins to synthesize the ideal of neo-Roman liberty with that of Christian liberty.<ref>Ann Hughes, 'Milton, Areopagitica, and the Parliamentary Cause', ''The Oxford Handbook of Milton'', ed. Nicholas McDowell and Nigel Smith, Oxford University Press, 2009</ref><ref>Blair Hoxby, 'Areopagitica and Liberty', ''The Oxford Handbook of Milton'', ed. Nicholas McDowell and Nigel Smith, Oxford University Press, 2009</ref>\n\n===Secretary for Foreign Tongues===\nWith the parliamentary victory in the Civil War, Milton used his pen in defence of the republican principles represented by the Commonwealth. ''[[The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates]]'' (1649) defended the right of the people to hold their rulers to account, and implicitly sanctioned the [[regicide]]; Milton's political reputation got him appointed Secretary for Foreign Tongues by the Council of State in March 1649. His main job description was to compose the English Republic's foreign correspondence in Latin, but he also was called upon to produce propaganda for the regime and to serve as a censor.<ref>C. Sullivan, 'Milton and the Beginning of Civil Service', in ''Literature in the Public Service'' (2013), Ch. 2.</ref>\n\n[[File:19 York Street, Westminster (1848).jpg|thumb|The back of no 19 York Street (1848). In 1651, Milton moved into a \"pretty garden-house\" in [[Petty France, Westminster]]. He lived there until the Restoration. Later it became No. 19 York Street, belonged to [[Jeremy Bentham]], was occupied successively by [[James Mill]] and [[William Hazlitt]], and finally was demolished in 1877.<ref>{{cite DNB |first=Leslie |last=Stephen |title=Milton, John (1608-1674)|volume=38|p=32}}</ref>]]\n\nIn October 1649, he published ''[[Eikonoklastes]]'', an explicit defence of the regicide, in response to the ''[[Eikon Basilike]]'', a phenomenal best-seller popularly attributed to Charles I that portrayed the King as an innocent Christian [[martyr]]. Milton tried to break this powerful image of Charles I (the literal translation of Eikonoklastes is 'the image breaker'). A month later, however, the exiled [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and his party published the defence of monarchy ''Defensio Regia pro Carolo Primo'', written by leading humanist [[Claudius Salmasius]]. By January of the following year, Milton was ordered to write a defence of the English people by the [[English Council of State|Council of State]]. Milton worked more slowly than usual, given the European audience and the English Republic's desire to establish diplomatic and cultural legitimacy, as he drew on the learning marshalled by his years of study to compose a riposte.\n\nOn 24 February 1652, Milton published his Latin defence of the English people ''[[Defensio pro Populo Anglicano]]'', also known as the ''First Defence''. Milton's pure Latin prose and evident learning exemplified in the ''First Defence'' quickly made him a European reputation, and the work ran to numerous editions.<ref>von Maltzahn 1999 p. 239.</ref> He addressed his ''Sonnet 16'' to 'The Lord Generall Cromwell in May 1652' beginning  \"Cromwell, our chief of men...\", although it was not published until 1654.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=POOLEY|first=ROGER|date=1993|title=The poets' Cromwell|journal=Critical Survey|volume=5|issue=3|pages=223\u2013234|jstor=41555744}}</ref>\n\nIn 1654, Milton completed the second defence of the English nation ''Defensio secunda'' in response to an anonymous Royalist tract ''\"Regii Sanguinis Clamor ad Coelum Adversus Parricidas Anglicanos\"'' [The Cry of the Royal Blood to Heaven  Against the English Parricides], a work that made many personal attacks on Milton.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cOoXuk5wEbQC&dq=Regii+sanguinis+clam+royalist|title=The Milton Encyclopedia|last=Corns|first=Thomas N.|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300094442|location=|pages=216}}</ref> The second defence praised [[Oliver Cromwell]], now Lord Protector, while exhorting him to remain true to the principles of the Revolution. [[Alexander Morus]], to whom Milton wrongly attributed the ''Clamor'' (in fact by [[Peter du Moulin]]), published an attack on Milton, in response to which Milton published the autobiographical ''Defensio pro se'' in 1655. Milton held the appointment of Secretary for Foreign Tongues to the Commonwealth Council of State until 1660, although after he had become totally blind, most of the work was done by his deputies, Georg Rudolph Wecklein, then Philip Meadows, and from 1657 by the poet [[Andrew Marvell]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/milton-appointed-latin-secretary|title=Milton appointed Latin Secretary {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|accessdate=3 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy 1652, Milton had become totally blind;<ref>John Leonard, in the introduction to \"Paradise Lost\", Penguin Classics page ix  2000</ref> the cause of his blindness is debated but bilateral [[retinal detachment]] or [[glaucoma]] are most likely.<ref name=pmid18168884>{{cite journal|last=Sorsby|first=A.|title=On The Nature of Milton's Blindness|journal=British Journal of Ophthalmology|year=1930|volume=14|issue=7|pages=339\u201354|pmid=18168884|pmc=511199|doi=10.1136/bjo.14.7.339}}</ref> His blindness forced him to dictate his [[verse (poetry)|verse]] and prose to [[amanuensis|amanuenses]] who copied them out for him; one of these was poet Andrew Marvell.

Milton, however, stubbornly clung to the beliefs that had originally inspired him to write for the Commonwealth. In 1659, he published ''[[A Treatise of Civil Power]]'', attacking the concept of a state-dominated church (the position known as [[Erastianism]]), as well as ''Considerations touching the likeliest means to remove hirelings'', denouncing corrupt practises in church governance. As the Republic disintegrated, Milton wrote several proposals to retain a non-monarchical government against the wishes of parliament, soldiers, and the people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/john-milton/miltons-works|title=Milton's Works|date=3 February 2017|website=Milton's Works|publisher=Christ's College Cambridge}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lewalski|first=Barbara Kiefer|year=1959|title=Milton: Political Beliefs and Polemical Methods, 1659\u201360|jstor=460581|journal=PMLA|volume=74|issue=3|pages=191\u2013202|doi=10.2307/460581}}</ref>\n\n*''A Letter to a Friend, Concerning the Ruptures of the Commonwealth'', written in October 1659, was a response to [[John Lambert (general)|General Lambert]]'s recent dissolution of the [[Rump Parliament]].\n*''Proposals of certain expedients for the preventing of a civil war now feared'', written in November 1659.\n*''[[The Ready and Easy Way to Establishing a Free Commonwealth]]'', in two editions, responded to [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|General Monck]]'s march towards London to restore the [[Long Parliament]] (which led to the restoration of the monarchy). The work is an impassioned, bitter, and futile [[jeremiad]] damning the English people for backsliding from the cause of [[liberty]] and advocating the establishment of an authoritarian rule by an [[oligarchy]] set up by unelected parliament.\n\nUpon the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in May 1660, Milton went into hiding for his life, while a warrant was issued for his arrest and his writings were burnt. He re-emerged after [[Indemnity and Oblivion Act|a general pardon]] was issued, but was nevertheless arrested and briefly imprisoned before influential friends intervened, such as Marvell, now an MP. Milton married for a third and final time on 24 February 1663, marrying Elizabeth (Betty) Minshull, aged 24, a native of [[Wistaston]], Cheshire. He spent the remaining decade of his life living quietly in London, only retiring to a cottage during the [[Great Plague of London]]\u2014[[Milton's Cottage]] in [[Chalfont St. Giles]], his only extant home.\n\nDuring this period, Milton published several minor prose works, such as the grammar textbook ''Art of Logic'' and a ''History of Britain''. His only explicitly political tracts were the 1672 ''Of True Religion'', arguing for [[toleration]] (except for Catholics), and a translation of a Polish tract advocating an elective monarchy. Both these works were referred to in the [[Exclusion Bill|Exclusion]] debate, the attempt to exclude the heir presumptive from the throne of England\u2014[[James, Duke of York]]\u2014because he was Roman Catholic. That debate preoccupied politics in the 1670s and 1680s and precipitated the formation of the [[British Whig Party|Whig party]] and the [[Glorious Revolution]].\n\nMilton died of kidney failure on 8 November 1674 and was buried in the church of [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]], [[Fore Street, London|Fore Street]], London.<ref name=EncylLon>{{cite book|author1=[[Christopher Hibbert|Hibbert, Christopher]]; Ben Weinreb; John Keay; Julia Keay.|title=The London Encyclopaedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xa0D0PqiwfEC&pg=PA762|year=2010|location=London|publisher=Pan Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-73878-2|page=762}}</ref> According to an early biographer, his funeral was attended by \"his learned and great Friends in London, not without a friendly concourse of the Vulgar.\"<ref>Toland 1932 p. 193.</ref> A monument was added in 1793, sculpted by [[John Bacon (sculptor, born 1740)|John Bacon the Elder]].\n\n===Family===\nMilton and his first wife Mary Powell (1625\u20131652) had four children:\n*Anne (born 7 July 1646)\n*Mary (born 25 October 1648)\n*John (16 March 1651 \u2013 June 1652)\n*Deborah (2 May 1652 \u2013 10 August 1727<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Monthly Mirror: Reflecting Men and Manners|publisher=Harding & Wright|year=1810|location=Edinburgh|pages=49|quote=|via=Google Books}}</ref>)\n\nMary Powell died on 5 May 1652 from complications following Deborah's birth. Milton's daughters survived to adulthood, but he always had a strained relationship with them.\n\nOn 12 November 1656, Milton was married to Katherine Woodcock at [[St Margaret's, Westminster]].<ref>'Milton, John', in ''Journal of the Society of Arts, 8 November 1867, p. 755</ref> She died on 3 February 1658, less than four months after giving birth to her daughter Katherine, who also died.\n\nMilton married for a third time on 24 February 1663 to Elizabeth Mynshull or Minshull (1638\u20131728), the niece of Thomas Mynshull, a wealthy apothecary and philanthropist in Manchester. The marriage took place at [[St Mary Aldermary]] in the City of London. Despite a 31-year age gap, the marriage seemed happy, according to [[John Aubrey]], and lasted more than 12 years until Milton's death. (A plaque on the wall of Mynshull's House in Manchester describes Elizabeth as Milton's \"3rd and Best wife\".) Samuel Johnson, however, claims that Mynshull was \"a domestic companion and attendant\" and that Milton's nephew [[Edward Phillips]] relates that Mynshull \"oppressed his children in his lifetime, and cheated them at his death\".<ref>Johnson 1826 Vol. I 86.</ref>\n\nHis nephews, [[Edward Phillips|Edward]] and [[John Phillips (author)|John Phillips]] (sons of Milton's sister Anne), were educated by Milton and became writers themselves. John acted as a secretary, and Edward was Milton's first biographer.\n\n==Poetry==\nMilton's poetry was slow to see the light of day, at least under his name. His first published poem was \"On Shakespeare\" (1630), anonymously included in the [[Second Folio]] edition of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays in 1632. An annoted copy of the [[First Folio]] has been suggested to contain marginal notes by Milton.<ref>Flood, Alison,  ''[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/16/when-milton-met-shakespeare-poets-notes-on-bard-appear-to-have-been-found?

The anonymous edition of ''Comus'' was published in 1637, and the publication of ''Lycidas'' in 1638 in ''Justa Edouardo King Naufrago'' was signed J. M. Otherwise.

Both of these works also reflect Milton's post-Restoration political situation. Just before his death in 1674, Milton supervised a second edition of ''Paradise Lost'', accompanied by an explanation of \"why the poem rhymes not\", and prefatory verses by [[Andrew Marvell]]. In 1673, Milton republished his ''1645 Poems'', as well as a collection of his letters and the Latin prolusions from his Cambridge days.\n\n==Views==\nAn unfinished religious manifesto, ''[[De Doctrina Christiana (Milton)|De doctrina christiana]]'', probably written by Milton, lays out many of his heterodox theological views, and was not discovered and published until 1823. Milton's key beliefs were idiosyncratic, not those of an identifiable group or faction, and often they go well beyond the orthodoxy of the time. Their tone, however, stemmed from the Puritan emphasis on the centrality and inviolability of conscience.<ref>See, for instance, Barker, Arthur. ''Milton and the Puritan Dilemma, 1641\u20131660''.

According to Fallon, Milton's monism is most notably reflected in ''Paradise Lost'' when he has angels eat (5.433\u201339){{clarify|date=May 2012}} and apparently engage in sexual intercourse (8.622\u201329){{clarify|date=May 2012}} and the ''De Doctrina'', where he denies the dual natures of man and argues for a theory of Creation [[Ex nihilo|''ex Deo'']].\n\n===Political thought===\n{{Main|John Milton's politics}}Milton was a \"passionately individual Christian Humanist poet.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A Critical History of English Literature, Vol. I|last=Daiches|first=David|publisher=Seeker & Warburg|year=1960|isbn=|location=London|pages=457}}</ref> He appears on the pages of seventeenth century English Puritanism, an age characterized as \"the world turned upside down.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The world turned upside down : radical ideas during the English revolution|last=Hill|first=Christopher|publisher=Penguin|year=1984|isbn=9780140137323|location=London|pages=}}</ref> He is a Puritan and yet is unwilling to surrender conscience to party positions on public policy.

In both the cases, he seems in control, taking stock of the situation arising from the polarization of the English society on religious and political lines.

After his divorce writings, ''Areopagitica'', and a gap, he wrote in 1649\u201354 in the aftermath of the [[execution of Charles I]], and in polemic justification of the regicide and the existing Parliamentarian regime. Then in 1659\u201360 he foresaw the Restoration, and wrote to head it off.<ref>Blair Worden, ''Literature and Politics in Cromwellian England: John Milton, Andrew Marvell and Marchamont Nedham'' (2007), p. 154.</ref>\n\nMilton's own beliefs were in some cases both unpopular and dangerous, and this was true particularly to his commitment to [[republicanism]].

John Milton wrestled with the great doctrines of the Church amidst the theological crosswinds of his age.

Like many [[Renaissance]] artists before him, Milton attempted to integrate Christian theology with classical modes. In his early poems, the poet narrator expresses a tension between vice and virtue, the latter invariably related to Protestantism. In ''Comus'', Milton may make ironic use of the [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] court [[masque]] by elevating notions of purity and virtue over the conventions of court revelry and superstition. In his later poems, Milton's theological concerns become more explicit.\n\nHis use of biblical citation was wide-ranging; Harris Fletcher, standing at the beginning of the intensification of the study of the use of scripture in Milton's work (poetry and prose, in all languages Milton mastered), notes that typically Milton clipped and adapted biblical quotations to suit the purpose, giving precise chapter and verse only in texts for a more specialized readership. As for the plenitude of Milton's quotations from scripture, Fletcher comments, \"For this work, I have in all actually collated about twenty-five hundred of the five to ten thousand direct Biblical quotations which appear therein\".<ref name=harris/> Milton's customary English Bible was the [[King James Version#Authorized Version|Authorized King James]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=E.

He has been accused of rejecting the [[Trinity]], believing instead that the Son was subordinate to the Father, a position known as [[Arianism]]; and his sympathy or curiosity was probably engaged by [[Socinianism]]: in August 1650 he licensed for publication by [[William Dugard]] the ''[[Racovian Catechism]]'', based on a non-trinitarian creed.<ref>Lewalski, ''Life of Milton'', p. 253.</ref><ref>William Bridges Hunter, ''A Milton Encyclopedia'' (1980), Vol. VIII, p. 13.</ref> Milton's alleged Arianism, like much of his theology, is still subject of debate and controversy. [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]] argued that \"In none of his great works is there a passage from which it can be inferred that he was an Arian; and in the very last of his writings he declares that \"the doctrine of the Trinity is a plain doctrine in Scripture.\"<ref>John Milton, The Prose Works of John Milton: With a Biographical Introduction by Rufus Wilmot Griswold. In Two Volumes (Philadelphia: John W. Moore, 1847). Vol. 1. [[wikisource:The Prose Works of John Milton/Biographical introduction|The Prose Works of John Milton, Biographical introduction]]</ref> In ''Areopagitica,'' Milton classified Arians and Socinians as \"errorists\" and \"schismatics\" alongside [[Arminians]] and [[Anabaptists]].<ref>W.F. Draper, \"The Religious Life and Opinions of John Milton.\" In \"The Bibliotheca Sacra and Biblical Repository,\" Volume 17 (1860) p. 38.</ref> A source has interpreted him as broadly Protestant, if not always easy to locate in a more precise religious category.\n\nIn his 1641 treatise, ''[[Of Reformation]]'', Milton expressed his dislike for Catholicism and episcopacy, presenting Rome as a modern [[Babylon]], and bishops as Egyptian taskmasters. These analogies conform to Milton's puritanical preference for [[Old Testament]] imagery.

These views were bound up in Protestant views of the [[Millennium]], which some sects, such as the [[Fifth Monarchists]] predicted would arrive in England. Milton, however, would later criticise the \"worldly\" millenarian views of these and others, and expressed orthodox ideas on the prophecy of the [[Four Empires]].<ref>Walter S. H. Lim, ''John Milton, Radical Politics, and Biblical Republicanism'' (2006), p. 141.</ref>\n\nThe Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 began a new phase in Milton's work. In ''Paradise Lost'', ''[[Paradise Regained]]'' and ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', Milton mourns the end of the godly [[English Commonwealth|Commonwealth]]. The [[Garden of Eden]] may allegorically reflect Milton's view of England's recent [[The Fall of Man|Fall from Grace]], while [[Samson]]'s blindness and captivity\u2014mirroring Milton's own lost sight\u2014may be a metaphor for England's blind acceptance of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as king.\nIllustrated by ''Paradise Lost'' is [[Soul sleep|mortalism]], the belief that the soul lies dormant after the body dies.<ref>John Rogers, ''The Matter of Revolution'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1998), p. xi.</ref>\n\nDespite the Restoration of the monarchy, Milton did not lose his personal faith; Samson shows how the loss of national [[salvation]] did not necessarily preclude the salvation of the individual, while ''Paradise Regained'' expresses Milton's continuing belief in the promise of Christian salvation through Jesus Christ.\n\nThough he maintained his personal faith in spite of the defeats suffered by his cause, the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' recounted how he had been alienated from the Church of England by Archbishop William Laud, and then moved similarly from the [[Dissenters]] by their denunciation of religious tolerance in England.\n\n{{quote|Milton had come to stand apart from all sects, though apparently finding the [[Quakers]] most congenial. He never went to any religious services in his later years. When a servant brought back accounts of sermons from [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] meetings, Milton became so sarcastic that the man at last gave up his place.}}Writing of the enigmatic and often conflicting views of Milton in the Puritan age, David Daiches wrote convincingly,<blockquote>\"Christian and Humanist, Protestant, patriot and heir of the golden ages of Greece and Rome, he faced what appeared to him to be the birth-pangs of a new and regenerate England with high excitement and idealistic optimism.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>A fair theological summary may be: that John Milton was a Puritan, though his tendency to press further for liberty of conscience, sometimes out of conviction and often out of mere intellectual curiosity, made the great man, at least, a vital if not uncomfortable ally in the broader Puritan movement.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Religious toleration===\nMilton called in the ''[[Areopagitica]]'' for \"the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties\" (applied, however, only to the conflicting Protestant denominations, and not to atheists, Jews, Muslims or Catholics).<ref>Hill, C.

In August of that year, he presented his thoughts to the [[Westminster Assembly of Divines]], which had been created by the [[Long Parliament]] to bring greater reform to the Church of England. The Assembly convened on 1 July against the will of King Charles I.\n\nMilton's thinking on divorce caused him considerable trouble with the authorities. An orthodox Presbyterian view of the time was that Milton's views on divorce constituted a one-man [[heresy]]:\n\n{{quote|The fervently Presbyterian [[Thomas Edwards (heresiographer)|Edwards]] had included Milton's divorce tracts in his list in ''[[Gangraena]]'' of heretical publications that threatened the religious and moral fabric of the nation; Milton responded by mocking him as \"shallow Edwards\" in the satirical sonnet \"On the New Forcers of Conscience under the Long Parliament\", usually dated to the latter half of 1646.<ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119394388/PDFSTART (PDF) Nicholas McDowell, ''Family Politics; Or, How John Phillips Read His Uncle's Satirical Sonnets'', Milton Quarterly Vol. 42 Issue 1, pp. 1\u201321.

However, Milton's basic approval of divorce within strict parameters set by the biblical witness was typical of many influential Christian intellectuals, particularly the Westminster divines. Milton addressed the Assembly on the matter of divorce in August 1643,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/ddd/book_1/notes.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704170506/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/ddd/book_1/notes.shtml |archivedate= 4 July 2013 }}</ref> at a moment when the Assembly was beginning to form its opinion on the matter. In the Doctrine & Discipline of Divorce, Milton argued that divorce was a private matter, not a legal or ecclesiastical one. Neither the Assembly nor Parliament condemned Milton or his ideas. In fact, when the Westminster Assembly wrote the Westminster Confession of Faith they allowed for divorce ('Of Marriage and Divorce,' Chapter 24, Section 5) in cases of infidelity or abandonment. Thus, the Christian community, at least a majority within the 'Puritan' sub-set, approved of Milton's views.\n\nNevertheless, reaction among Puritans to Milton's views on divorce was mixed. [[Herbert Palmer (Puritan)|Herbert Palmer]], a member of the [[Westminster Assembly]], condemned Milton in the strongest possible language:\n\n{{quote|If any plead Conscience ... for divorce for other causes than Christ and His Apostles mention; Of which a wicked booke is abroad and uncensured, though deserving to be burnt, whose Author, hath been so impudent as to set his Name to it, and dedicate it to your selves ... will you grant a Toleration for all this?|The Glasse of God's Providence Towards His Faithfull Ones, 1644, p. 54.<ref>Ernest Sirluck, \"Introduction\", Complete Prose Works of John Milton, New Haven: Yale U.

He cast a formidable shadow over English poetry in the 18th and 19th centuries; he was often judged equal or superior to all other English poets, including [[Shakespeare]].

A subsequent prose translation by [[Johann Jakob Bodmer]] was very popular; it influenced Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock. The German-language Milton tradition returned to England in the person of the artist [[Henry Fuseli]].\n\nMany enlightenment thinkers of the 18th century revered and commented on Milton's poetry and non-poetical works. In addition to John Dryden, among them were [[Alexander Pope]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[Thomas Newton]], and [[Samuel Johnson]]. For example, in ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'',<ref>Nos 267, 273, 279, 285, 291, 297, 303, 309, 315, 321, 327, 333, 339, 345, 351, 357, 363, and 369.</ref> Joseph Addison wrote extensive notes, annotations, and interpretations of certain passages of ''Paradise Lost''. [[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson, senior]], and Jonathan Richardson, the younger, co-wrote a book of criticism.<ref>''Explanatory Notes and Remarks on Milton's Paradise Lost'' (1734).</ref> In 1749, Thomas Newton published an extensive edition of Milton's poetical works with annotations provided by himself, Dryden, Pope, Addison, the Richardsons (father and son) and others. Newton's edition of Milton was a culmination of the honour bestowed upon Milton by early Enlightenment thinkers; it may also have been prompted by Richard Bentley's infamous edition, described above. Samuel Johnson wrote numerous essays on ''Paradise Lost'', and Milton was included in his ''[[Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets]]'' (1779\u20131781). In ''[[The Age of Louis XIV]]'', [[Voltaire]] said \"Milton remains the glory and the wonder (''l'admiration'') of England.\"<ref>Voltaire, ''Le Siecle de Louis XIV 2,'' Paris: Garnier-Flammarion, 1966, p.66.</ref>\n\n===Blake===\n[[File:Milton a Poem copy D 1818 Library of Congress object 1.jpg|thumb|[[Frontispiece (book)|Frontispiece]] to ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books]]'']]\n\n[[William Blake]] considered Milton the major English poet.

At the time, poetic blank verse was considered distinct from its use in verse drama, and ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' was taken as a unique examplar.<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 443.</ref> Said [[Isaac Watts]] in 1734, \"Mr. Milton is esteemed the parent and author of blank verse among us\".<ref>Watts 1810 iv. 619.</ref> \"Miltonic verse\" might be synonymous for a century with blank verse as poetry, a new poetic terrain independent from both the drama and the [[heroic couplet]].\n\nLack of rhyme was sometimes taken as Milton's defining innovation. He himself considered the rhymeless quality of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' to be an extension of his own personal liberty:\n\n{{quote|This neglect then of Rhime&nbsp;... is to be esteem'd an example set, the first in English, of ancient liberty recover'd to heroic Poem from the troublesom and modern bondage of Rimeing.<ref>Milton 1668 xi.</ref>}}\n\nThis pursuit of freedom was largely a reaction against conservative values entrenched within the rigid heroic couplet.<ref>Gordon 2008 p. 234.</ref> Within a dominant culture that stressed elegance and finish, he granted primacy to freedom, breadth and imaginative suggestiveness, eventually developed into the romantic vision of sublime terror. Reaction to Milton's poetic worldview included, grudgingly, acknowledgement that of poet's resemblance to classical writers (Greek and Roman poetry being unrhymed). Blank verse came to be a recognised medium for religious works and for translations of the classics. Unrhymed lyrics like [[William Collins (poet)|Collins]]' ''[[Ode to Evening]]'' (in the meter of Milton's translation of [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ode to Pyrrha]]'') were not uncommon after 1740.<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 46.</ref>\n\nA second aspect of Milton's blank verse was the use of unconventional rhythm:\n\n{{quote|His blank-verse paragraph, and his audacious and victorious attempt to combine blank and rhymed verse with paragraphic effect in Lycidas, lay down indestructible models and patterns of English verse-rhythm, as distinguished from the narrower and more strait-laced forms of English metre.<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 457.</ref>}}\n\nBefore Milton, \"the sense of regular rhythm&nbsp;... had been knocked into the English head so securely that it was part of their nature\".<ref>Saintsbury 1916 p. 101.</ref> The \"Heroick measure\", according to [[Samuel Johnson]], \"is pure&nbsp;... when the accent rests upon every second syllable through the whole line&nbsp;...

In order to support this symmetry, lines were most often octo- or deca-syllabic, with no [[enjambed]] endings. To this schema Milton introduced modifications, which included [[hypermetric]]al [[syllable]]s (trisyllabic [[Foot (prosody)|feet]]), [[inversion (prosody)|inversion]] or slighting of [[stress (linguistics)|stresses]], and the shifting of pauses to all parts of the line.<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 57.</ref> Milton deemed these features to be reflective of \"the transcendental union of order and freedom\".<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 458\u201359.</ref> Admirers remained hesitant to adopt such departures from traditional metrical schemes: \"The English&nbsp;... had been writing separate lines for so long that they could not rid themselves of the habit\".<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 59.</ref> Isaac Watts preferred his lines distinct from each other, as did [[Oliver Goldsmith]], [[Henry Pemberton]], and [[Scott of Amwell]], whose general opinion it was that Milton's frequent omission of the initial unaccented foot was \"displeasing to a nice ear\".<ref>Saintsbury 1916 p. 114.</ref> It was not until the late 18th century that poets (beginning with [[Thomas Gray|Gray]]) began to appreciate \"the composition of Milton's harmony&nbsp;... how he loved to vary his pauses, his measures, and his feet, which gives that enchanting air of freedom and wilderness to his versification\".<ref>Gray 1748 ''Observations on English Metre''.</ref> By the 20th century, American poet and critic John Hollander would go so far as to say that Milton \"was able, by plying that most remarkable instrument of English meter ... to invent a new mode of image-making in English poetry.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/visionresonancet0000holl/page/116|title=Vision and resonance : two senses of poetic form|last=Hollander|first=John|date=1975|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=0-19-501898-2|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/visionresonancet0000holl/page/116 116]|oclc=1530446}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St Giles-without-Cripplegate, London 01.JPG|thumb|Memorial in [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]], London]]\n\nWhile [[neoclassicism|neo-classical]] diction was as restrictive as its [[prosody (poetry)|prosody]], and narrow imagery paired with uniformity of sentence structure resulted in a small set of 800 nouns circumscribing the vocabulary of 90% of heroic couplets ever written up to the eighteenth century,<ref>Hobsbaum 1996 p. 40.</ref> and tradition required that the same adjectives attach to the same nouns, followed by the same verbs, Milton's pursuit of liberty extended into his vocabulary as well.

Milton also wrote the hymn [[Let us with a gladsome mind]], a versification of Psalm 136.

He wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval, and is best known for his [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667), written in [[blank verse]], and widely considered to be one of the greatest works of literature ever written.\n\nWriting in English, Latin, Greek, and Italian, he achieved international renown within his lifetime; his celebrated ''[[Areopagitica]]'' (1644), written in condemnation of [[Prior restraint|pre-publication censorship]], is among history's most influential and impassioned defences of [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]]. His desire for freedom extended into his style: he introduced new words (coined from Latin) to the English language, and was the first modern writer to employ unrhymed verse outside of the theatre or translations.\n\n[[William Hayley]]'s 1796 biography called him the \"greatest English author\",<ref>McCalman 2001 p. 605.</ref> and he remains generally regarded \"as one of the preeminent writers in the English language\",<ref>''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. [http://www.enotes.com/literary-criticism/milton-john \"Milton, John \u2013 Introduction\"].</ref> though critical reception has oscillated in the centuries since his death (often on account of his [[republicanism]]). [[Samuel Johnson]] praised ''Paradise Lost'' as \"a poem which...with respect to design may claim the first place, and with respect to performance, the second, among the productions of the human mind\", though he (a [[Tory]] and recipient of royal patronage) described Milton's politics as those of an \"acrimonious and surly republican\".<ref name=Works>{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Arthur|title=The Works of Samuel Johnson, LL.

Milton studied, travelled, wrote poetry mostly for private circulation, and launched a career as pamphleteer and publicist under the increasingly personal rule of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and its breakdown into constitutional confusion and war. The shift in accepted attitudes in government placed him in public office under the [[Commonwealth of England]], from being thought dangerously radical and even heretical, and he even acted as an official spokesman in certain of his publications. The [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of 1660 deprived Milton, now completely blind, of his public platform, but this period saw him complete most of his major works of poetry.\n\nMilton's views developed from his very extensive reading, as well as travel and experience, from his student days of the 1620s to the [[English Civil War]].<ref>Masson 1859 pp. v\u2013vi.</ref> By the time of his death in 1674, Milton was impoverished and on the margins of English intellectual life, yet famous throughout Europe and unrepentant for his political choices.\n\n===Early life===\n{{Main|Early life of John Milton}}\n[[File:John Milton plaque Bread Street London.jpg|thumb|left|Blue plaque in Bread Street, London, where Milton was born]]\n\nJohn Milton was born in Bread Street, London on 9 December 1608, the son of composer [[John Milton (composer)|John Milton]] and his wife Sarah Jeffrey.

The elder Milton was noted for his skill as a musical composer, and this talent left his son with a lifelong appreciation for music and friendships with musicians such as [[Henry Lawes]].<ref>Lewalski 2003 p. 3.</ref>\n\nMilton's father's prosperity provided his eldest son with a private tutor, [[Thomas Young (1587\u20131655)|Thomas Young]], a Scottish Presbyterian with an M.A. from the University of St. Andrews. Research suggests that Young's influence served as the poet's introduction to religious radicalism.<ref>Skerpan-Wheeler, Elizabeth. \"John Milton.\" British Rhetoricians and Logicians, 1500\u20131660: Second Series. Ed. Edward A. Malone. Detroit: Gale, 2003. Dictionary of Literary Biography Vol. 281. Literature Resource Center.</ref> After Young's tutorship, Milton attended [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in London. There he began the study of Latin and Greek, and the classical languages left an imprint on both his poetry and prose in English (he also wrote in Italian and Latin).\n\n[[File:John Milton portrait.jpg|thumb|John Milton at age 10 by [[Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen]]. In [[Milton's Cottage]], [[Chalfont St Giles]].]]\n\nMilton's first datable compositions are two psalms done at age 15 at [[Long Bennington]]. One contemporary source is the ''[[Brief Lives]]'' of [[John Aubrey]], an uneven compilation including first-hand reports. In the work, Aubrey quotes Christopher, Milton's younger brother: \"When he was young, he studied very hard and sat up very late, commonly till twelve or one o'clock at night\". Aubrey adds, \"\"His complexion exceeding faire\u2014he was so faire that they called him the Lady of Christ's College.\"<ref name=OLD>Dick 1962 pp. 270\u201375.</ref>\n\nIn 1625, Milton began attending [[Christ's College, Cambridge]]. He graduated with a B.A. in 1629,<ref>{{acad|id=MLTN624J|name=Milton, John}}</ref> ranking fourth of 24&nbsp;honours graduates that year in the University of Cambridge.<ref>Hunter 1980 p. 99.</ref> Preparing to become an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest, Milton stayed on and obtained his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts degree]] on 3 July 1632.\n\nMilton may have been [[rustication (academia)|rusticated]] (suspended) in his first year for quarrelling with his tutor, Bishop [[William Chappell (bishop)|William Chappell]]. He was certainly at home in London in the Lent Term 1626; there he wrote his ''Elegia Prima'', a first Latin [[elegy]], to Charles Diodati, a friend from St Paul's. Based on remarks of [[John Aubrey]], Chappell \"whipt\" Milton.<ref name=OLD/> This story is now disputed, though certainly Milton disliked Chappell.<ref>Wedgwood 1961 p. 178.</ref> Historian [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] cautiously notes that Milton was \"apparently\" rusticated, and that the differences between Chappell and Milton may have been either religious or personal.<ref>Hill 1977 p. 34.</ref> It is also possible that, like [[Isaac Newton]] four decades later, Milton was sent home because of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], by which Cambridge was badly affected in 1625. In 1626, Milton's tutor was Nathaniel Tovey.\n\nAt Cambridge, Milton was on good terms with [[Edward King (British poet)|Edward King]], for whom he later wrote \"[[Lycidas]]\". He also befriended Anglo-American dissident and theologian [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]. Milton tutored Williams in Hebrew in exchange for lessons in Dutch.<ref>Pfeiffer 1955 pp. 363\u201373.</ref> Despite developing a reputation for poetic skill and general erudition, Milton experienced alienation from his peers and university life as a whole. Having once watched his fellow students attempting comedy upon the college stage, he later observed 'they thought themselves gallant men, and I thought them fools'.<ref>Milton 1959 pp. 887\u201388.</ref>\n\nMilton was disdainful of the university curriculum, which consisted of stilted formal debates conducted in Latin on abstruse topics. His own corpus is not devoid of humour, notably his sixth [[wikt:prolusion|prolusion]] and his epitaphs on the death of [[Thomas Hobson]]. While at Cambridge, he wrote a number of his well-known shorter English poems, among them \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity\", his \"Epitaph on the admirable Dramaticke Poet, W. Shakespeare\" (his first poem to appear in print), ''[[L'Allegro]]'', and ''[[Il Penseroso]]''.\n\n===Study, poetry, and travel===\n{{Details|Early life of John Milton}}\n{{quote box\n|width=40%\n|quote=It appears in all his writings that he had the usual concomitant of great abilities, a lofty and steady confidence in himself, perhaps not without some contempt of others; for scarcely any man ever wrote so much, and praised so few. Of his praise he was very frugal; as he set its value high, and considered his mention of a name as a security against the waste of time, and a certain preservative from oblivion.<ref>Johnson 1826 Vol. I. p. 64.</ref>\n|source=\u2013 [[Samuel Johnson]], ''[[Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets]]''\n}}\n\nUpon receiving his M.A. in 1632, Milton retired to [[Hammersmith]], his father's new home since the previous year. He also lived at [[Horton, Berkshire|Horton]], Berkshire, from 1635 and undertook six years of self-directed private study. Hill argues that this was not retreat into a rural idyll; Hammersmith was then a \"suburban village\" falling into the orbit of London, and even Horton was becoming deforested and suffered from the plague.<ref>Hill 1977 p. 38.</ref> He read both ancient and modern works of theology, philosophy, history, politics, literature, and science in preparation for a prospective poetical career. Milton's intellectual development can be charted via entries in his [[commonplace book]] (like a scrapbook), now in the [[British Library]]. As a result of such intensive study, Milton is considered to be among the most learned of all English poets. In addition to his years of private study, Milton had command of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, Spanish, and Italian from his school and undergraduate days; he also added Old English to his linguistic repertoire in the 1650s while researching his ''History of Britain'', and probably acquired proficiency in Dutch soon after.<ref>Lewalski 2003 p. 103.</ref>\n\n[[File:John Milton plaque Berkyn Manor Farm Horton.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Commemorative blue plaque 'John Milton lived here 1632\u20131638' at Berkyn Manor Farm, [[Horton, Berkshire]]]]\n\nMilton continued to write poetry during this period of study; his ''[[Arcades (Milton)|Arcades]]'' and ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'' were both commissioned for [[masques]] composed for noble patrons, connections of the Egerton family, and performed in 1632 and 1634 respectively. ''Comus'' argues for the virtuousness of [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] and [[chastity]].  He contributed his [[pastoral]] [[elegy]] ''[[Lycidas]]'' to a memorial collection for one of his fellow-students at Cambridge.  Drafts of these poems are preserved in Milton's poetry notebook, known as the Trinity Manuscript because it is now kept at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], Cambridge.\n\nIn May 1638, Milton embarked upon a tour of France and Italy that lasted until July or August 1639.<ref>Chaney 1985 and 2000.</ref> His travels supplemented his study with new and direct experience of artistic and religious traditions, especially Roman Catholicism. He met famous theorists and intellectuals of the time, and was able to display his poetic skills. For specific details of what happened within Milton's \"[[grand tour]]\", there appears to be just one [[primary source]]: Milton's own ''[[Defensio Secunda]]''. There are other records, including some letters and some references in his other prose tracts, but the bulk of the information about the tour comes from a work that, according to [[Barbara Lewalski]], \"was not intended as autobiography but as rhetoric, designed to emphasise his sterling reputation with the learned of Europe.\"<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 87\u201388.</ref>\n\nHe first went to [[Calais]] and then on to Paris, riding horseback, with a letter from diplomat [[Henry Wotton]] to ambassador [[John Scudamore (ambassador)|John Scudamore]]. Through Scudamore, Milton met [[Hugo Grotius]], a Dutch law philosopher, playwright, and poet. Milton left France soon after this meeting. He travelled south from [[Nice, France|Nice]] to [[Genoa]], and then to [[Livorno]] and [[Pisa]]. He reached Florence in July 1638. While there, Milton enjoyed many of the sites and structures of the city. His candour of manner and erudite neo-Latin poetry earned him friends in Florentine intellectual circles, and he met the astronomer [[Galileo]] who was under [[house arrest]] at [[Arcetri]], as well as others.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 88\u201394.</ref> Milton probably visited the Florentine Academy and the [[Accademia della Crusca]] along with smaller academies in the area, including the Apatisti and the [[Svogliati]].\n\n{{quote box |width=40% |quote=In [Florence], which I have always admired above all others because of the elegance, not just of its tongue, but also of its wit, I lingered for about two months.

With the connections from Florence, Milton was able to have easy access to Rome's intellectual society. His poetic abilities impressed those like Giovanni Salzilli, who praised Milton within an epigram. In late October, Milton attended a dinner given by the [[English College, Rome]], despite his dislike for the [[Society of Jesus]], meeting English Catholics who were also guests\u2014theologian [[Henry Holden]] and the poet [[Patrick Cary]].<ref>Chaney 1985 and 2000 and Lewalski p. 96.</ref> He also attended musical events, including oratorios, operas, and melodramas. Milton left for [[Naples]] toward the end of November, where he stayed only for a month because of the Spanish control.<ref>Chaney 1985 p. 244\u201351 and Chaney 2000 p. 313.</ref> During that time, he was introduced to Giovanni Battista Manso, patron to both [[Torquato Tasso]] and to [[Giambattista Marino]].<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 94\u201398.</ref>\n\nOriginally, Milton wanted to leave Naples in order to travel to [[Sicily]] and then on to Greece, but he returned to England during the summer of 1639 because of what he claimed in ''Defensio Secunda''<ref>Lewalski 2003 p. 98.</ref> were \"sad tidings of civil war in England.\"<ref>Milton 1959 Vol. IV part I pp. 618\u201319.</ref> Matters became more complicated when Milton received word that his childhood friend Diodati had died. Milton in fact stayed another seven months on the continent, and spent time at [[Geneva]] with Diodati's uncle after he returned to Rome. In ''Defensio Secunda'', Milton proclaimed that he was warned against a return to Rome because of his frankness about religion, but he stayed in the city for two months and was able to experience [[Carnival]] and meet [[Lukas Holste]], a Vatican librarian who guided Milton through its collection. He was introduced to Cardinal [[Francesco Barberini (1597\u20131679)|Francesco Barberini]] who invited Milton to an opera hosted by the Cardinal. Around March, Milton travelled once again to Florence, staying there for two months, attending further meetings of the academies, and spending time with friends. After leaving Florence, he travelled through Lucca, Bologna, and Ferrara before coming to [[Venice]]. In Venice, Milton was exposed to a model of Republicanism, later important in his political writings, but he soon found another model when he travelled to Geneva. From Switzerland, Milton travelled to Paris and then to Calais before finally arriving back in England in either July or August 1639.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 99\u2013109.</ref>\n\n===Civil war, prose tracts, and marriage===\n{{Main|Milton's antiprelatical tracts}}\n[[File:Areopagitica bridwell.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Title page of the 1644 edition of ''[[Areopagitica]]'']]\n\nOn returning to England where the [[Bishops' Wars]] presaged further armed conflict, Milton began to write prose [[tract (literature)|tracts]] against [[episcopacy]], in the service of the [[Puritan]] and [[Long Parliament|Parliamentary]] cause. Milton's first foray into polemics was ''Of Reformation touching Church Discipline in England'' (1641), followed by ''Of Prelatical Episcopacy'', the two defences of [[Smectymnuus]] (a group of Presbyterian divines named from their initials; the \"TY\" belonged to Milton's old tutor Thomas Young), and ''[[The Reason of Church-Government Urged against Prelaty]]''. He vigorously attacked the High-church party of the Church of England and their leader [[William Laud]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], with frequent passages of real eloquence lighting up the rough controversial style of the period, and deploying a wide knowledge of church history.\n\nHe was supported by his father's investments, but Milton became a private schoolmaster at this time, educating his nephews and other children of the well-to-do. This experience and discussions with educational reformer [[Samuel Hartlib]] led him to write his short tract ''[[Of Education]]'' in 1644, urging a reform of the national universities.\n\nIn June 1642, Milton paid a visit to the manor house at [[Forest Hill, Oxfordshire]], and returned with 16-year-old bride Mary Powell.<ref name=\"ODNB Milton\">{{cite journal|first=Gordon|last=Campbell|title=Milton, John (1608\u20131674)|journal=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|volume=1|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|edition=Online|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18800|accessdate=25 October 2013|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/18800}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref><ref>Lobel 1957 pp. 122\u201334.</ref> Mary found life difficult with the severe 35-year-old schoolmaster and pamphleteer, and she returned to her family a month later.

([[Anna Beer]], one of Milton's most recent biographers, points to a lack of evidence and the dangers of cynicism in urging that it was not necessarily the case that the private life so animated the public polemicising.) In 1643, Milton had a brush with the authorities over these writings, in parallel with [[Hezekiah Woodward]], who had more trouble.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 181\u201382, 600.</ref> It was the hostile response accorded the divorce tracts that spurred Milton to write ''[[Areopagitica|Areopagitica; A speech of Mr. John Milton for the Liberty of Unlicenc'd Printing, to the Parlament of England]]'', his celebrated attack on pre-printing censorship.  In ''Areopagitica'', Milton aligns himself with the parliamentary cause, and he also begins to synthesize the ideal of neo-Roman liberty with that of Christian liberty.<ref>Ann Hughes, 'Milton, Areopagitica, and the Parliamentary Cause', ''The Oxford Handbook of Milton'', ed.

''[[The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates]]'' (1649) defended the right of the people to hold their rulers to account, and implicitly sanctioned the [[regicide]]; Milton's political reputation got him appointed Secretary for Foreign Tongues by the Council of State in March 1649. His main job description was to compose the English Republic's foreign correspondence in Latin, but he also was called upon to produce propaganda for the regime and to serve as a censor.<ref>C.

Milton tried to break this powerful image of Charles I (the literal translation of Eikonoklastes is 'the image breaker'). A month later, however, the exiled [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and his party published the defence of monarchy ''Defensio Regia pro Carolo Primo'', written by leading humanist [[Claudius Salmasius]]. By January of the following year, Milton was ordered to write a defence of the English people by the [[English Council of State|Council of State]]. Milton worked more slowly than usual, given the European audience and the English Republic's desire to establish diplomatic and cultural legitimacy, as he drew on the learning marshalled by his years of study to compose a riposte.\n\nOn 24 February 1652, Milton published his Latin defence of the English people ''[[Defensio pro Populo Anglicano]]'', also known as the ''First Defence''. Milton's pure Latin prose and evident learning exemplified in the ''First Defence'' quickly made him a European reputation, and the work ran to numerous editions.<ref>von Maltzahn 1999 p. 239.</ref> He addressed his ''Sonnet 16'' to 'The Lord Generall Cromwell in May 1652' beginning  \"Cromwell, our chief of men...\", although it was not published until 1654.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=POOLEY|first=ROGER|date=1993|title=The poets' Cromwell|journal=Critical Survey|volume=5|issue=3|pages=223\u2013234|jstor=41555744}}</ref>\n\nIn 1654, Milton completed the second defence of the English nation ''Defensio secunda'' in response to an anonymous Royalist tract ''\"Regii Sanguinis Clamor ad Coelum Adversus Parricidas Anglicanos\"'' [The Cry of the Royal Blood to Heaven  Against the English Parricides], a work that made many personal attacks on Milton.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cOoXuk5wEbQC&dq=Regii+sanguinis+clam+royalist|title=The Milton Encyclopedia|last=Corns|first=Thomas N.|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300094442|location=|pages=216}}</ref> The second defence praised [[Oliver Cromwell]], now Lord Protector, while exhorting him to remain true to the principles of the Revolution. [[Alexander Morus]], to whom Milton wrongly attributed the ''Clamor'' (in fact by [[Peter du Moulin]]), published an attack on Milton, in response to which Milton published the autobiographical ''Defensio pro se'' in 1655. Milton held the appointment of Secretary for Foreign Tongues to the Commonwealth Council of State until 1660, although after he had become totally blind, most of the work was done by his deputies, Georg Rudolph Wecklein, then Philip Meadows, and from 1657 by the poet [[Andrew Marvell]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/milton-appointed-latin-secretary|title=Milton appointed Latin Secretary {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|accessdate=3 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy 1652, Milton had become totally blind;<ref>John Leonard, in the introduction to \"Paradise Lost\", Penguin Classics page ix  2000</ref> the cause of his blindness is debated but bilateral [[retinal detachment]] or [[glaucoma]] are most likely.<ref name=pmid18168884>{{cite journal|last=Sorsby|first=A.|title=On The Nature of Milton's Blindness|journal=British Journal of Ophthalmology|year=1930|volume=14|issue=7|pages=339\u201354|pmid=18168884|pmc=511199|doi=10.1136/bjo.14.7.339}}</ref> His blindness forced him to dictate his [[verse (poetry)|verse]] and prose to [[amanuensis|amanuenses]] who copied them out for him; one of these was poet Andrew Marvell.

Milton, however, stubbornly clung to the beliefs that had originally inspired him to write for the Commonwealth. In 1659, he published ''[[A Treatise of Civil Power]]'', attacking the concept of a state-dominated church (the position known as [[Erastianism]]), as well as ''Considerations touching the likeliest means to remove hirelings'', denouncing corrupt practises in church governance. As the Republic disintegrated, Milton wrote several proposals to retain a non-monarchical government against the wishes of parliament, soldiers, and the people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/john-milton/miltons-works|title=Milton's Works|date=3 February 2017|website=Milton's Works|publisher=Christ's College Cambridge}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lewalski|first=Barbara Kiefer|year=1959|title=Milton: Political Beliefs and Polemical Methods, 1659\u201360|jstor=460581|journal=PMLA|volume=74|issue=3|pages=191\u2013202|doi=10.2307/460581}}</ref>\n\n*''A Letter to a Friend, Concerning the Ruptures of the Commonwealth'', written in October 1659, was a response to [[John Lambert (general)|General Lambert]]'s recent dissolution of the [[Rump Parliament]].\n*''Proposals of certain expedients for the preventing of a civil war now feared'', written in November 1659.\n*''[[The Ready and Easy Way to Establishing a Free Commonwealth]]'', in two editions, responded to [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|General Monck]]'s march towards London to restore the [[Long Parliament]] (which led to the restoration of the monarchy). The work is an impassioned, bitter, and futile [[jeremiad]] damning the English people for backsliding from the cause of [[liberty]] and advocating the establishment of an authoritarian rule by an [[oligarchy]] set up by unelected parliament.\n\nUpon the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in May 1660, Milton went into hiding for his life, while a warrant was issued for his arrest and his writings were burnt. He re-emerged after [[Indemnity and Oblivion Act|a general pardon]] was issued, but was nevertheless arrested and briefly imprisoned before influential friends intervened, such as Marvell, now an MP. Milton married for a third and final time on 24 February 1663, marrying Elizabeth (Betty) Minshull, aged 24, a native of [[Wistaston]], Cheshire. He spent the remaining decade of his life living quietly in London, only retiring to a cottage during the [[Great Plague of London]]\u2014[[Milton's Cottage]] in [[Chalfont St. Giles]], his only extant home.\n\nDuring this period, Milton published several minor prose works, such as the grammar textbook ''Art of Logic'' and a ''History of Britain''. His only explicitly political tracts were the 1672 ''Of True Religion'', arguing for [[toleration]] (except for Catholics), and a translation of a Polish tract advocating an elective monarchy. Both these works were referred to in the [[Exclusion Bill|Exclusion]] debate, the attempt to exclude the heir presumptive from the throne of England\u2014[[James, Duke of York]]\u2014because he was Roman Catholic. That debate preoccupied politics in the 1670s and 1680s and precipitated the formation of the [[British Whig Party|Whig party]] and the [[Glorious Revolution]].\n\nMilton died of kidney failure on 8 November 1674 and was buried in the church of [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]], [[Fore Street, London|Fore Street]], London.<ref name=EncylLon>{{cite book|author1=[[Christopher Hibbert|Hibbert, Christopher]]; Ben Weinreb; John Keay; Julia Keay.|title=The London Encyclopaedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xa0D0PqiwfEC&pg=PA762|year=2010|location=London|publisher=Pan Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-73878-2|page=762}}</ref> According to an early biographer, his funeral was attended by \"his learned and great Friends in London, not without a friendly concourse of the Vulgar.\"<ref>Toland 1932 p. 193.</ref> A monument was added in 1793, sculpted by [[John Bacon (sculptor, born 1740)|John Bacon the Elder]].\n\n===Family===\nMilton and his first wife Mary Powell (1625\u20131652) had four children:\n*Anne (born 7 July 1646)\n*Mary (born 25 October 1648)\n*John (16 March 1651 \u2013 June 1652)\n*Deborah (2 May 1652 \u2013 10 August 1727<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Monthly Mirror: Reflecting Men and Manners|publisher=Harding & Wright|year=1810|location=Edinburgh|pages=49|quote=|via=Google Books}}</ref>)\n\nMary Powell died on 5 May 1652 from complications following Deborah's birth. Milton's daughters survived to adulthood, but he always had a strained relationship with them.\n\nOn 12 November 1656, Milton was married to Katherine Woodcock at [[St Margaret's, Westminster]].<ref>'Milton, John', in ''Journal of the Society of Arts, 8 November 1867, p. 755</ref> She died on 3 February 1658, less than four months after giving birth to her daughter Katherine, who also died.\n\nMilton married for a third time on 24 February 1663 to Elizabeth Mynshull or Minshull (1638\u20131728), the niece of Thomas Mynshull, a wealthy apothecary and philanthropist in Manchester. The marriage took place at [[St Mary Aldermary]] in the City of London. Despite a 31-year age gap, the marriage seemed happy, according to [[John Aubrey]], and lasted more than 12 years until Milton's death. (A plaque on the wall of Mynshull's House in Manchester describes Elizabeth as Milton's \"3rd and Best wife\".) Samuel Johnson, however, claims that Mynshull was \"a domestic companion and attendant\" and that Milton's nephew [[Edward Phillips]] relates that Mynshull \"oppressed his children in his lifetime, and cheated them at his death\".<ref>Johnson 1826 Vol. I 86.</ref>\n\nHis nephews, [[Edward Phillips|Edward]] and [[John Phillips (author)|John Phillips]] (sons of Milton's sister Anne), were educated by Milton and became writers themselves. John acted as a secretary, and Edward was Milton's first biographer.\n\n==Poetry==\nMilton's poetry was slow to see the light of day, at least under his name. His first published poem was \"On Shakespeare\" (1630), anonymously included in the [[Second Folio]] edition of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays in 1632. An annoted copy of the [[First Folio]] has been suggested to contain marginal notes by Milton.<ref>Flood, Alison,  ''[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/16/when-milton-met-shakespeare-poets-notes-on-bard-appear-to-have-been-found?

The anonymous edition of ''Comus'' was published in 1637, and the publication of ''Lycidas'' in 1638 in ''Justa Edouardo King Naufrago'' was signed J. M. Otherwise.

In 1673, Milton republished his ''1645 Poems'', as well as a collection of his letters and the Latin prolusions from his Cambridge days.\n\n==Views==\nAn unfinished religious manifesto, ''[[De Doctrina Christiana (Milton)|De doctrina christiana]]'', probably written by Milton, lays out many of his heterodox theological views, and was not discovered and published until 1823. Milton's key beliefs were idiosyncratic, not those of an identifiable group or faction, and often they go well beyond the orthodoxy of the time. Their tone, however, stemmed from the Puritan emphasis on the centrality and inviolability of conscience.<ref>See, for instance, Barker, Arthur. ''Milton and the Puritan Dilemma, 1641\u20131660''.

John Milton wrestled with the great doctrines of the Church amidst the theological crosswinds of his age. The great Poet was undoubtedly Reformed (though his grandfather, Richard \"the Ranger\" Milton had been Roman Catholic).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Arms of the Family: The Significance of John Milton's Relatives and Associates|last=Shawcross|first=John T.|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=2004|isbn=978-0813122915|location=Lexington|pages=7}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=In the Days of Milton|last=Jenks|first=Tudor|publisher=A.S.

Like many [[Renaissance]] artists before him, Milton attempted to integrate Christian theology with classical modes. In his early poems, the poet narrator expresses a tension between vice and virtue, the latter invariably related to Protestantism. In ''Comus'', Milton may make ironic use of the [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] court [[masque]] by elevating notions of purity and virtue over the conventions of court revelry and superstition. In his later poems, Milton's theological concerns become more explicit.\n\nHis use of biblical citation was wide-ranging; Harris Fletcher, standing at the beginning of the intensification of the study of the use of scripture in Milton's work (poetry and prose, in all languages Milton mastered), notes that typically Milton clipped and adapted biblical quotations to suit the purpose, giving precise chapter and verse only in texts for a more specialized readership. As for the plenitude of Milton's quotations from scripture, Fletcher comments, \"For this work, I have in all actually collated about twenty-five hundred of the five to ten thousand direct Biblical quotations which appear therein\".<ref name=harris/> Milton's customary English Bible was the [[King James Version#Authorized Version|Authorized King James]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=E.

He has been accused of rejecting the [[Trinity]], believing instead that the Son was subordinate to the Father, a position known as [[Arianism]]; and his sympathy or curiosity was probably engaged by [[Socinianism]]: in August 1650 he licensed for publication by [[William Dugard]] the ''[[Racovian Catechism]]'', based on a non-trinitarian creed.<ref>Lewalski, ''Life of Milton'', p. 253.</ref><ref>William Bridges Hunter, ''A Milton Encyclopedia'' (1980), Vol. VIII, p. 13.</ref> Milton's alleged Arianism, like much of his theology, is still subject of debate and controversy. [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]] argued that \"In none of his great works is there a passage from which it can be inferred that he was an Arian; and in the very last of his writings he declares that \"the doctrine of the Trinity is a plain doctrine in Scripture.\"<ref>John Milton, The Prose Works of John Milton: With a Biographical Introduction by Rufus Wilmot Griswold. In Two Volumes (Philadelphia: John W. Moore, 1847). Vol. 1. [[wikisource:The Prose Works of John Milton/Biographical introduction|The Prose Works of John Milton, Biographical introduction]]</ref> In ''Areopagitica,'' Milton classified Arians and Socinians as \"errorists\" and \"schismatics\" alongside [[Arminians]] and [[Anabaptists]].<ref>W.F.

These analogies conform to Milton's puritanical preference for [[Old Testament]] imagery. He knew at least four commentaries on ''Genesis'': those of [[John Calvin]], [[Paulus Fagius]], [[David Pareus]] and [[Andreus Rivetus]].<ref>Arnold Williams, ''Renaissance Commentaries on \"Genesis\" and Some Elements of the Theology of Paradise Lost'', PMLA, Vol. 56, No. 1 (Mar. 1941), pp. 151\u201364.</ref>\n\nThrough the [[Interregnum (1649\u20131660)|Interregnum]], Milton often presents England, rescued from the trappings of a worldly monarchy, as an [[elect]] nation akin to the Old Testament [[Israel]], and shows its leader, [[Oliver Cromwell]], as a latter-day [[Moses]]. These views were bound up in Protestant views of the [[Millennium]], which some sects, such as the [[Fifth Monarchists]] predicted would arrive in England. Milton, however, would later criticise the \"worldly\" millenarian views of these and others, and expressed orthodox ideas on the prophecy of the [[Four Empires]].<ref>Walter S. H. Lim, ''John Milton, Radical Politics, and Biblical Republicanism'' (2006), p. 141.</ref>\n\nThe Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 began a new phase in Milton's work. In ''Paradise Lost'', ''[[Paradise Regained]]'' and ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', Milton mourns the end of the godly [[English Commonwealth|Commonwealth]]. The [[Garden of Eden]] may allegorically reflect Milton's view of England's recent [[The Fall of Man|Fall from Grace]], while [[Samson]]'s blindness and captivity\u2014mirroring Milton's own lost sight\u2014may be a metaphor for England's blind acceptance of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as king.\nIllustrated by ''Paradise Lost'' is [[Soul sleep|mortalism]], the belief that the soul lies dormant after the body dies.<ref>John Rogers, ''The Matter of Revolution'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1998), p. xi.</ref>\n\nDespite the Restoration of the monarchy, Milton did not lose his personal faith; Samson shows how the loss of national [[salvation]] did not necessarily preclude the salvation of the individual, while ''Paradise Regained'' expresses Milton's continuing belief in the promise of Christian salvation through Jesus Christ.\n\nThough he maintained his personal faith in spite of the defeats suffered by his cause, the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' recounted how he had been alienated from the Church of England by Archbishop William Laud, and then moved similarly from the [[Dissenters]] by their denunciation of religious tolerance in England.\n\n{{quote|Milton had come to stand apart from all sects, though apparently finding the [[Quakers]] most congenial. He never went to any religious services in his later years. When a servant brought back accounts of sermons from [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] meetings, Milton became so sarcastic that the man at last gave up his place.}}Writing of the enigmatic and often conflicting views of Milton in the Puritan age, David Daiches wrote convincingly,<blockquote>\"Christian and Humanist, Protestant, patriot and heir of the golden ages of Greece and Rome, he faced what appeared to him to be the birth-pangs of a new and regenerate England with high excitement and idealistic optimism.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>A fair theological summary may be: that John Milton was a Puritan, though his tendency to press further for liberty of conscience, sometimes out of conviction and often out of mere intellectual curiosity, made the great man, at least, a vital if not uncomfortable ally in the broader Puritan movement.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Religious toleration===\nMilton called in the ''[[Areopagitica]]'' for \"the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties\" (applied, however, only to the conflicting Protestant denominations, and not to atheists, Jews, Muslims or Catholics).<ref>Hill, C.

In August of that year, he presented his thoughts to the [[Westminster Assembly of Divines]], which had been created by the [[Long Parliament]] to bring greater reform to the Church of England. The Assembly convened on 1 July against the will of King Charles I.\n\nMilton's thinking on divorce caused him considerable trouble with the authorities. An orthodox Presbyterian view of the time was that Milton's views on divorce constituted a one-man [[heresy]]:\n\n{{quote|The fervently Presbyterian [[Thomas Edwards (heresiographer)|Edwards]] had included Milton's divorce tracts in his list in ''[[Gangraena]]'' of heretical publications that threatened the religious and moral fabric of the nation; Milton responded by mocking him as \"shallow Edwards\" in the satirical sonnet \"On the New Forcers of Conscience under the Long Parliament\", usually dated to the latter half of 1646.<ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119394388/PDFSTART (PDF) Nicholas McDowell, ''Family Politics; Or, How John Phillips Read His Uncle's Satirical Sonnets'', Milton Quarterly Vol. 42 Issue 1, pp. 1\u201321.

However, Milton's basic approval of divorce within strict parameters set by the biblical witness was typical of many influential Christian intellectuals, particularly the Westminster divines. Milton addressed the Assembly on the matter of divorce in August 1643,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/ddd/book_1/notes.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704170506/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/ddd/book_1/notes.shtml |archivedate= 4 July 2013 }}</ref> at a moment when the Assembly was beginning to form its opinion on the matter. In the Doctrine & Discipline of Divorce, Milton argued that divorce was a private matter, not a legal or ecclesiastical one. Neither the Assembly nor Parliament condemned Milton or his ideas. In fact, when the Westminster Assembly wrote the Westminster Confession of Faith they allowed for divorce ('Of Marriage and Divorce,' Chapter 24, Section 5) in cases of infidelity or abandonment. Thus, the Christian community, at least a majority within the 'Puritan' sub-set, approved of Milton's views.\n\nNevertheless, reaction among Puritans to Milton's views on divorce was mixed. [[Herbert Palmer (Puritan)|Herbert Palmer]], a member of the [[Westminster Assembly]], condemned Milton in the strongest possible language:\n\n{{quote|If any plead Conscience ... for divorce for other causes than Christ and His Apostles mention; Of which a wicked booke is abroad and uncensured, though deserving to be burnt, whose Author, hath been so impudent as to set his Name to it, and dedicate it to your selves ... will you grant a Toleration for all this?|The Glasse of God's Providence Towards His Faithfull Ones, 1644, p. 54.<ref>Ernest Sirluck, \"Introduction\", Complete Prose Works of John Milton, New Haven: Yale U.

He cast a formidable shadow over English poetry in the 18th and 19th centuries; he was often judged equal or superior to all other English poets, including [[Shakespeare]].

A subsequent prose translation by [[Johann Jakob Bodmer]] was very popular; it influenced Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock. The German-language Milton tradition returned to England in the person of the artist [[Henry Fuseli]].\n\nMany enlightenment thinkers of the 18th century revered and commented on Milton's poetry and non-poetical works. In addition to John Dryden, among them were [[Alexander Pope]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[Thomas Newton]], and [[Samuel Johnson]]. For example, in ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'',<ref>Nos 267, 273, 279, 285, 291, 297, 303, 309, 315, 321, 327, 333, 339, 345, 351, 357, 363, and 369.</ref> Joseph Addison wrote extensive notes, annotations, and interpretations of certain passages of ''Paradise Lost''. [[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson, senior]], and Jonathan Richardson, the younger, co-wrote a book of criticism.<ref>''Explanatory Notes and Remarks on Milton's Paradise Lost'' (1734).</ref> In 1749, Thomas Newton published an extensive edition of Milton's poetical works with annotations provided by himself, Dryden, Pope, Addison, the Richardsons (father and son) and others. Newton's edition of Milton was a culmination of the honour bestowed upon Milton by early Enlightenment thinkers; it may also have been prompted by Richard Bentley's infamous edition, described above. Samuel Johnson wrote numerous essays on ''Paradise Lost'', and Milton was included in his ''[[Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets]]'' (1779\u20131781). In ''[[The Age of Louis XIV]]'', [[Voltaire]] said \"Milton remains the glory and the wonder (''l'admiration'') of England.\"<ref>Voltaire, ''Le Siecle de Louis XIV 2,'' Paris: Garnier-Flammarion, 1966, p.66.</ref>\n\n===Blake===\n[[File:Milton a Poem copy D 1818 Library of Congress object 1.jpg|thumb|[[Frontispiece (book)|Frontispiece]] to ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books]]'']]\n\n[[William Blake]] considered Milton the major English poet.

He himself considered the rhymeless quality of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' to be an extension of his own personal liberty:\n\n{{quote|This neglect then of Rhime&nbsp;... is to be esteem'd an example set, the first in English, of ancient liberty recover'd to heroic Poem from the troublesom and modern bondage of Rimeing.<ref>Milton 1668 xi.</ref>}}\n\nThis pursuit of freedom was largely a reaction against conservative values entrenched within the rigid heroic couplet.<ref>Gordon 2008 p. 234.</ref> Within a dominant culture that stressed elegance and finish, he granted primacy to freedom, breadth and imaginative suggestiveness, eventually developed into the romantic vision of sublime terror. Reaction to Milton's poetic worldview included, grudgingly, acknowledgement that of poet's resemblance to classical writers (Greek and Roman poetry being unrhymed). Blank verse came to be a recognised medium for religious works and for translations of the classics. Unrhymed lyrics like [[William Collins (poet)|Collins]]' ''[[Ode to Evening]]'' (in the meter of Milton's translation of [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ode to Pyrrha]]'') were not uncommon after 1740.<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 46.</ref>\n\nA second aspect of Milton's blank verse was the use of unconventional rhythm:\n\n{{quote|His blank-verse paragraph, and his audacious and victorious attempt to combine blank and rhymed verse with paragraphic effect in Lycidas, lay down indestructible models and patterns of English verse-rhythm, as distinguished from the narrower and more strait-laced forms of English metre.<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 457.</ref>}}\n\nBefore Milton, \"the sense of regular rhythm&nbsp;... had been knocked into the English head so securely that it was part of their nature\".<ref>Saintsbury 1916 p. 101.</ref> The \"Heroick measure\", according to [[Samuel Johnson]], \"is pure&nbsp;... when the accent rests upon every second syllable through the whole line&nbsp;... The repetition of this sound or percussion at equal times, is the most complete harmony of which a single verse is capable\".<ref>Johnson 1751 no. 86.</ref> [[Caesura]]l pauses, most agreed, were best placed at the middle and the end of the line. In order to support this symmetry, lines were most often octo- or deca-syllabic, with no [[enjambed]] endings. To this schema Milton introduced modifications, which included [[hypermetric]]al [[syllable]]s (trisyllabic [[Foot (prosody)|feet]]), [[inversion (prosody)|inversion]] or slighting of [[stress (linguistics)|stresses]], and the shifting of pauses to all parts of the line.<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 57.</ref> Milton deemed these features to be reflective of \"the transcendental union of order and freedom\".<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 458\u201359.</ref> Admirers remained hesitant to adopt such departures from traditional metrical schemes: \"The English&nbsp;... had been writing separate lines for so long that they could not rid themselves of the habit\".<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 59.</ref> Isaac Watts preferred his lines distinct from each other, as did [[Oliver Goldsmith]], [[Henry Pemberton]], and [[Scott of Amwell]], whose general opinion it was that Milton's frequent omission of the initial unaccented foot was \"displeasing to a nice ear\".<ref>Saintsbury 1916 p. 114.</ref> It was not until the late 18th century that poets (beginning with [[Thomas Gray|Gray]]) began to appreciate \"the composition of Milton's harmony&nbsp;... how he loved to vary his pauses, his measures, and his feet, which gives that enchanting air of freedom and wilderness to his versification\".<ref>Gray 1748 ''Observations on English Metre''.</ref> By the 20th century, American poet and critic John Hollander would go so far as to say that Milton \"was able, by plying that most remarkable instrument of English meter ... to invent a new mode of image-making in English poetry.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/visionresonancet0000holl/page/116|title=Vision and resonance : two senses of poetic form|last=Hollander|first=John|date=1975|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=0-19-501898-2|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/visionresonancet0000holl/page/116 116]|oclc=1530446}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St Giles-without-Cripplegate, London 01.JPG|thumb|Memorial in [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]], London]]\n\nWhile [[neoclassicism|neo-classical]] diction was as restrictive as its [[prosody (poetry)|prosody]], and narrow imagery paired with uniformity of sentence structure resulted in a small set of 800 nouns circumscribing the vocabulary of 90% of heroic couplets ever written up to the eighteenth century,<ref>Hobsbaum 1996 p. 40.</ref> and tradition required that the same adjectives attach to the same nouns, followed by the same verbs, Milton's pursuit of liberty extended into his vocabulary as well. It included many Latinate [[neologism]]s, as well as obsolete words already dropped from popular usage so completely that their meanings were no longer understood. In 1740, [[Francis Peck]] identified some examples of Milton's \"old\" words (now popular).<ref>They included \"self-same\", \"hue\", \"minstrelsy\", \"murky\", \"carol\", and \"chaunt\". Among Milton's naturalized Latin words were \"humid\", \"orient\", \"hostil\", \"facil\", \"fervid\", \"jubilant\", \"ire\", \"bland\", \"reluctant\", \"palpable\", \"fragil\", and \"ornate\". Peck 1740 pp. 110\u201311.</ref> The \"Miltonian dialect\", as it was called, was emulated by later poets; Pope used the diction of ''Paradise Lost'' in his [[Homer]] translation, while the lyric poetry of Gray and Collins was frequently criticised for their use of \"obsolete words out of Spenser and Milton\".<ref>Scott 1785 63.</ref> The language of [[James Thomson (poet)|Thomson]]'s finest poems (e.g. ''[[The Seasons (Thomson poem)|The Seasons]]'', ''[[The Castle of Indolence]]'') was self-consciously modelled after the Miltonian dialect, with the same tone and sensibilities as ''Paradise Lost''. Following to Milton, English poetry from Pope to [[John Keats]] exhibited a steadily increasing attention to the connotative, the imaginative and poetic, value of words.<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 468.</ref>\n\n===Musical settings===\n\nMilton's [[ode]] ''At a solemn Musick'' was set for choir and orchestra as ''[[Blest Pair of Sirens]]'' by [[Hubert Parry]] (1848\u20131918), and Milton's poem ''On the Morning of Christ's Nativity'' was set as a large-scale choral work by [[Cyril Rootham]] (1875\u20131938). Milton also wrote the hymn [[Let us with a gladsome mind]], a versification of Psalm 136. His 'L'Allegro' and 'Il Penseroso', with additional material, were magnificently set by Handel (1740).\n\n==Works==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Poetry and drama===\n<!-- Years link to \"[years] in poetry\" for poetry, \"[years] in literature\" for drama: -->\n*1629: ''[[On the Morning of Christ's Nativity]]''\n*1630: ''[[On Shakespeare]]''\n*1631: ''[[On Arriving at the Age of Twenty-Three]]''\n*1632: ''[[L'Allegro]]''\n*1632: ''[[Il Penseroso]]''\n*1634: ''[[A Mask Presented at Ludlow Castle, 1634]]'', commonly known as ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'' (a [[masque]])\n*1637: ''[[Lycidas]]''\n*1645: ''[[Milton's 1645 Poems|Poems of Mr John Milton, Both English and Latin]]''\n*1652: ''[[When I Consider How My Light is Spent]]'' (Commonly referred to as \"On his blindness\", though Milton did not use this title){{Efn|\"When I consider how my light is spent\" is one of the best known of Milton's sonnets.

In its fullest form, it consists of seventeen chapters, though a separate \"explanatory tantra\" (''vy\u0101khy\u0101tantra'') known as the ''Later Tantra'' (Sanskrit: Guhyasam\u0101ja Uttaratantra; Tibetan: Rgyud phyi ma. (Toh 443)) is sometimes considered to be its eighteenth chapter. Many scholars believe that the original core of the work consisted of the first twelve chapters, with chapters thirteen to seventeen being added later as explanatory material.\n\nIn India, it was classified as a [[Yoga]] or [[Mahayoga|Mah\u0101yoga]] [[Tantra]]. In [[Tibet]] it is considered an Unexcelled [[Yoga]] Tantra (''rnal \u2019byor bla med rgyud''). It develops traditions found in earlier scriptures such as the ''Compendium of Reality'' (Sanskrit: Sarva-tath\u0101gata-[[Tattvasa\u1e43graha Tantra|tattva-sa\u1e43graha]]; De bzhin gshegs pa thams\ncad kyi de kho na nyid bsdus pa (Toh 479)) but is focused to a greater extent on the [[antinomian]] aspects characteristic of the later Buddhist Tantras. [[Naropa]] and [[Aryadeva]] considered the Compendium of Reality to be a root tantra in relation to the Guhyasamaja Tantra. The Guhyasamaja Tantra survives in [[Sanskrit]] manuscripts and in Tibetan and Chinese translation.\n\nThe Guhyasiddhi of Padmavajra, a work associated with the Guhyasamaja tradition, prescribes acting as a Saiva guru and initiating members into [[Shaiva Siddhanta]] scriptures and mandalas.<ref>Sanderson, Alexis. \"The \u015aaiva Age: The Rise and Dominance of \u015aaivism during the Early Medieval Period.\" In: Genesis and Development of Tantrism,edited by Shingo Einoo.

Institute of Oriental Culture Special Series, 23, pp. 144-145.</ref> Statues and pictures were also created to beautify the radical [[methodology]]. \n\n==Origin==\nAccording to one tradition, the Guhyasam\u0101ja [[Tantra]] was taught for the first time by the [[Buddha]] in the form of [[Vajradhara]] to [[Indrabhuti]] the King of [[Oddiyana]], also called King Dza.\n\nAs with most tantras, there are different traditions and transmissions. Perhaps the oldest surviving lineage is the [[Jnanapada|J\u00f1\u0101napada]] Tradition (''ye shes zhabs lugs''), which goes back to Buddha\u015brij\u00f1\u0101na (late 8th century). The most important historically is the [[\u0100rya]] tradition (''gsang 'dus 'phags lugs'') which is based on commentaries attributed to [[Nagarjuna|N\u0101g\u0101rjuna]], [[Aryadeva|\u0100ryadeva]], and [[Candrak\u012brti]].  'Gos Lotsawa Khug pa lhas btsas originated a transmission in [[Tibet]], as did [[Marpa Lotsawa]]. The [[Sakya]] tradition received both transmissions. [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsongkhapa]], founder of the [[Gelug]] tradition, considered the ''Esoteric Community'' to be the most important of the tantras and used the [[\u0100rya]] tradition as a template for interpreting all the other tantric traditions.\n\n==Iconography==\n[[File:Guhyasamaja.jpg|thumb|Statue of Guhyasamaja in union with consort, [[Capital Museum]]|left ]]\n\nThere are two main commentarial traditions on the Guhyasam\u0101ja Tantra, the [[\u0100rya]] Tradition and the [[Janapada|J\u00f1\u0101napada]] tradition.\n\nIn the practice of the [[\u0100rya]] Tradition, the central deity of the Guhyasam\u0101ja is blue-black Ak\u1e63obhyavajra, a form of [[Akshobhya|Ak\u1e63obhya]], one of the five [[Tath\u0101gata|tath\u0101gathas]] (pa\u00f1catath\u0101gata), sometimes called the [[Five Dhyani Buddhas|dhy\u0101ni buddhas]]. Ak\u1e63obhyavajra holds a vajra and bell (ghanta) in his first two hands, and other hands hold the symbols of the four other [[Tath\u0101gata|tath\u0101gathas]]: wheel of [[Vairocana]] and lotus of [[Amit\u0101bha]] in his rights, and gem of [[Ratnasambhava]] and sword of [[Amoghasiddhi]] in his lefts. The [[Mandala|ma\u1e47\u1e0dala]] consists of thirty-two deities in all.\n\nIn the [[Janapada|J\u00f1\u0101napada]] tradition, the central deity is yellow Ma\u00f1juvajra, a form of [[Manjusri|Ma\u1e47ju\u015br\u012b]], with nineteen deities in the mandala. Ma\u00f1juvajra has three faces\u2014the right one is white and red one on the left\u2014and six arms. The three faces may represent the three main channels of the subtle body, the three stages of purification of the mind or the illusory body, light, and their union.<ref name=\"Catherine Cummings pp 432-448\">Catherine Cummings, \"A Guhyasamaja Tantra,\" in John C.

In its fullest form, it consists of seventeen chapters, though a separate \"explanatory tantra\" (''vy\u0101khy\u0101tantra'') known as the ''Later Tantra'' (Sanskrit: Guhyasam\u0101ja Uttaratantra; Tibetan: Rgyud phyi ma. (Toh 443)) is sometimes considered to be its eighteenth chapter. Many scholars believe that the original core of the work consisted of the first twelve chapters, with chapters thirteen to seventeen being added later as explanatory material.\n\nIn India, it was classified as a [[Yoga]] or [[Mahayoga|Mah\u0101yoga]] [[Tantra]]. In [[Tibet]] it is considered an Unexcelled [[Yoga]] Tantra (''rnal \u2019byor bla med rgyud''). It develops traditions found in earlier scriptures such as the ''Compendium of Reality'' (Sanskrit: Sarva-tath\u0101gata-[[Tattvasa\u1e43graha Tantra|tattva-sa\u1e43graha]]; De bzhin gshegs pa thams\ncad kyi de kho na nyid bsdus pa (Toh 479)) but is focused to a greater extent on the [[antinomian]] aspects characteristic of the later Buddhist Tantras. [[Naropa]] and [[Aryadeva]] considered the Compendium of Reality to be a root tantra in relation to the Guhyasamaja Tantra. The Guhyasamaja Tantra survives in [[Sanskrit]] manuscripts and in Tibetan and Chinese translation.\n\nThe Guhyasiddhi of Padmavajra, a work associated with the Guhyasamaja tradition, prescribes acting as a Saiva guru and initiating members into [[Shaiva Siddhanta]] scriptures and mandalas.<ref>Sanderson, Alexis. \"The \u015aaiva Age: The Rise and Dominance of \u015aaivism during the Early Medieval Period.\" In: Genesis and Development of Tantrism,edited by Shingo Einoo.

Perhaps the oldest surviving lineage is the [[Janapada|J\u00f1\u0101napada]] Tradition (''ye shes zhabs lugs''), which goes back to Buddha\u015brij\u00f1\u0101na (late 8th century). The most important historically is the [[\u0100rya]] tradition (''gsang 'dus 'phags lugs'') which is based on commentaries attributed to [[Nagarjuna|N\u0101g\u0101rjuna]], [[Aryadeva|\u0100ryadeva]], and [[Candrak\u012brti]].  'Gos Lotsawa Khug pa lhas btsas originated a transmission in [[Tibet]], as did [[Marpa Lotsawa]]. The [[Sakya]] tradition received both transmissions. [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsongkhapa]], founder of the [[Gelug]] tradition, considered the ''Esoteric Community'' to be the most important of the tantras and used the [[\u0100rya]] tradition as a template for interpreting all the other tantric traditions.\n\n==Iconography==\n[[File:Guhyasamaja.jpg|thumb|Statue of Guhyasamaja in union with consort, [[Capital Museum]]|left ]]\n\nThere are two main commentarial traditions on the Guhyasam\u0101ja Tantra, the [[\u0100rya]] Tradition and the [[Janapada|J\u00f1\u0101napada]] tradition.\n\nIn the practice of the [[\u0100rya]] Tradition, the central deity of the Guhyasam\u0101ja is blue-black Ak\u1e63obhyavajra, a form of [[Akshobhya|Ak\u1e63obhya]], one of the five [[Tath\u0101gata|tath\u0101gathas]] (pa\u00f1catath\u0101gata), sometimes called the [[Five Dhyani Buddhas|dhy\u0101ni buddhas]]. Ak\u1e63obhyavajra holds a vajra and bell (ghanta) in his first two hands, and other hands hold the symbols of the four other [[Tath\u0101gata|tath\u0101gathas]]: wheel of [[Vairocana]] and lotus of [[Amit\u0101bha]] in his rights, and gem of [[Ratnasambhava]] and sword of [[Amoghasiddhi]] in his lefts. The [[Mandala|ma\u1e47\u1e0dala]] consists of thirty-two deities in all.\n\nIn the [[Janapada|J\u00f1\u0101napada]] tradition, the central deity is yellow Ma\u00f1juvajra, a form of [[Manjusri|Ma\u1e47ju\u015br\u012b]], with nineteen deities in the mandala. Ma\u00f1juvajra has three faces\u2014the right one is white and red one on the left\u2014and six arms.

Two versions were recorded. The first, recorded in June 1949, was very much like a hardboiled detective series and starred [[Michael Rye]] (credited as Rye Billsbury) as Dillon;<ref>The Billsbury version of June 1949 is available at https://open.spotify.com/episode/4pTJkv4h9IngjwUpQ09PzV</ref><ref name=\"BigBroadcast\" /> the second, recorded in July 1949, starred ''[[Straight Arrow]]'' actor [[Howard Culver]] in a more Western, lighter version of the same script.<ref>The Culver version of July 1949 is available at https://open.spotify.com/episode/3NGrKyv5wM4trxcDEULOm7</ref><ref>Both versions included [[June Foray]], [[Gerald Mohr]], [[Vic Perrin]] and [[Jay Novello]] in the cast.</ref> CBS liked the Culver version better, and Ackerman was told to proceed.\n\nA complication arose, though; Culver's contract as the star of ''Straight Arrow'' would not allow him to do another Western series. The project was shelved for three years, when producer [[Norman Macdonnell]] and writer [[John Meston]] discovered it while creating an adult Western series of their own.<ref>''Gunsmoke'' 2 Volume Set: A Complete History and Analysis of the Legendary Broadcast Series with a Comprehensive Episode-By-Episode Guide to Both the Radio and Television Programs -Suzanne Barabas and Gabor Barabas</ref>\n\nMacdonnell and Meston wanted to create a radio Western for adults, in contrast to the prevailing juvenile fare such as ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' and ''[[The Cisco Kid]].'' ''Gunsmoke'' was set in Dodge City, Kansas, during the thriving cattle days of the 1870s. Dunning<ref>Dunning, p. 303.</ref> notes, \"The show drew critical acclaim for unprecedented realism.\"\n\n=== Radio cast and character biographies ===\nThe radio series first aired on CBS on April 26, 1952 with the episode \"Billy the Kid\", written by [[Walter Newman (screenwriter)|Walter Newman]], and ended on June 18, 1961. The show stars [[William Conrad]] as Marshal Matt Dillon, [[Howard McNear]] as Doc Charles Adams, [[Georgia Ellis]] as Kitty Russell, and [[Parley Baer]] as Dillon's assistant, Chester Wesley Proudfoot.\n\n==== Matt Dillon ====\n[[File:William Conrad 1952.JPG|thumb|right|[[William Conrad]] in 1952, when Matt Dillon was created on radio]]\n\n[[Matt Dillon (Gunsmoke)|Matt Dillon]] was played on radio by William Conrad and on TV by James Arness. Two versions of the same pilot episode titled \"Mark Dillon Goes to Gouge Eye\" were produced with two different actors, Rye Billsbury and Howard Culver, playing Marshal \"Mark\" Dillon<!-- sic --> as the lead, not yet played by Conrad. Conrad was one of the last actors to audition for the role of Marshal Dillon. With a resonantly powerful and distinctive voice, Conrad was already one of radio's busiest actors. Though Meston championed him, Macdonnell thought Conrad might be overexposed. During his audition, however, Conrad won over Macdonnell after reading only a few lines. Dillon, as portrayed by Conrad, was a lonely, isolated man, toughened by a hard life. Macdonnell later claimed, \"Much of Matt Dillon's character grew out of Bill Conrad.\"<ref>[http://gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/79-WilliamDillon.htm \"Matt Dillon's character grew out of Bill Conrad\"], GunsmokeNet.com.</ref>\n\nMeston relished the upending of cherished Western fiction clich\u00e9s and felt that few Westerns gave any inkling of how brutal the Old West was in reality. Many episodes were based on man's cruelty to man and woman, inasmuch as the prairie woman's life and the painful treatment of women as [[Personal property|chattels]] were touched on well ahead of their time in most media. As originally pitched to CBS executives, this was to be an adult Western, not a grown-up [[Hopalong Cassidy]].\n\nDunning writes that Meston was especially disgusted by the archetypal Western hero and set out \"to destroy [that type of] character he loathed\". In Meston's view, \"Dillon was almost as scarred as the homicidal psychopaths who drifted into Dodge from all directions.\"<ref name=\"Dunning, 304\">Dunning, 304.</ref>\n\n==== Chester ====\nChester was played by [[Parley Baer]] on radio, and by [[Dennis Weaver]] on television.\nChester's character had no surname until Baer [[Ad libitum|ad libbed]] \"Proudfoot\" during an early rehearsal. Initial ''Gunsmoke'' scripts gave him no name at all; his lines were simply slugged{{clarify|date=April 2019}} to be spoken by \"Townsman\". Again, Conrad's sense of what the program would be supervened, and Chester was born. Chester's middle initial was given as \"W\" in the June 15, 1958, episode \"Old Flame\", and a few episodes later, on the July 7, 1958, episode \"Marshal Proudfoot\", his middle name, and that of his 10 siblings, is revealed to be Wesley. The amiable Waco expatriate was usually described as Dillon's \"assistant\", but in the December 13, 1952, episode \"Post Martin\", Dillon described Chester as Dillon's deputy. Contradicting this description, in the July 5, 1954, episode \"Hank Prine\" (episode 116, minute 3:02) Dillon corrects a prisoner who describes Chester as his \"deputy\", stating \"Chester is not my deputy\", though they both agree Chester acts like he is. Whatever his title, Chester was Dillon's foil, friend, partner, and in an episode in which Chester nearly dies (\"Never Pester Chester\"), Dillon allows that Chester was the only person he could trust.\n\nThe TV series changed the newly limping Chester's last name from Proudfoot to Goode. Chester was played by Dennis Weaver, who went on to star in the [[NBC]] ''[[NBC Mystery Movie|Mystery Movie]]'' rotating TV series entry of a police drama with a comedic touch, ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', in the early 1970s. Weaver, himself an impressive 6'2\", often looked small alongside Arness' height at 6'7\"; this could be partly due to the character Chester having a limp. Season two, episode 25 reveals that Chester was in the army. He would not have had the limp then, so probably got injured in the Civil War, not long ago, but long enough that he would have learned to live with the limp and virtually forget it.\n\n==== Doc Adams ====\n[[Howard McNear]] starred as Dr. Charles Adams in the radio series, with [[Milburn Stone]] portraying [[Dr. Galen Adams]] in the television version.\nIn the radio series, \"Doc\" Adams was initially a self-interested and somewhat dark character with a predilection for constantly attempting to increase his revenue through the procurement of autopsy fees. However, McNear's performances steadily became more warm-hearted and sympathetic. Most notably, this transformation began during (and progressed steadily following) the July 1952 episode \"Never Pester Chester\", in which a physician with a more compassionate and devoted temperament is essential to the plotline when Chester is near-fatally injured by two trouble-making Texas drovers.\n\nDoc Adams' backstory evokes a varied and experienced life: In some episodes, he had educational ties to [[Philadelphia]]; in others, he spent time as ship's doctor aboard the gambling boats that plied the [[Mississippi River]], which provided a background for his knowledge of [[New Orleans]] (and acquaintance with [[Mark Twain]]). In the January 31, 1953, episode \"Cavalcade\", a fuller history is offered, though subsequent programs kept close listeners' heads spinning. In \"Cavalcade\", his real name is Calvin Moore, educated in [[Boston]], and he practiced as a doctor for a year in [[Richmond, Virginia]], where he fell in love with a beautiful young woman, who was also being courted by a wealthy young man named Roger Beauregard. Beauregard forced Doc into fighting a duel with him, resulting in Beauregard's being shot and killed. Though it was a fair duel, as a Yankee and an outsider, Doc was forced to flee. The young woman fled after him and they were married in [[St. Louis]], but two months later, she died of [[typhus]].\n\nDoc wandered throughout the territories until he settled in [[Dodge City]] 17 years later under the name of \"Charles Adams\". The Adams moniker was another Conrad invention, borrowing the surname from cartoonist [[Charles Addams]] as a testament to Doc's initially ghoulish comportment.\n\n==== Miss Kitty ====\nKitty was played by [[Georgia Ellis]] on radio, and by [[Amanda Blake]] on TV.\nWhile actress Georgia Ellis first appeared in the radio episode \"Billy the Kid\" (April 26, 1952) as \"Francie Richards\" - a former girlfriend of Matt Dillon and the widow of a criminal - the character of \"Miss Kitty\" did not appear until the May 10, 1952, episode \"Jaliscoe\". Sometime in 1959, Ellis was billed as Georgia Hawkins instead of Georgia Ellis. Amanda Blake appeared in over 500 episodes of the television series, with her last being the April 1, 1974 episode titled, \"The Disciple\" when the character was last seen.\n\nIn the radio series, Kitty's profession was hinted at, but never explicit; in a 1953 interview with ''Time,'' Macdonnell declared, \"Kitty is just someone Matt has to visit every once in a while\".<ref name=\"Dunning, 304\"/> The magazine observed that she is \"obviously not selling chocolate bars\".<ref name=\"sixgungalahad\">{{Cite magazine |date=1959-03-30 |title=The Six-Gun Galahad |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,892441,00.html?internalid=ACA |magazine=TIME |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214134022/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,892441,00.html |archive-date=2008-02-14}}</ref> An out-take from the program makes this hilariously obvious.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/GunsmokeRehearsals |at=0:00:00\u20130:1:26 |title=Gunsmoke Rehearsals |work=Internet Archive |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref> The television show first portrayed Kitty as a saloon employee (dance-hall girl/prostitute), then from season three as half-owner of the [[Long Branch Saloon]].\n\n=== Distinction from other radio Westerns ===\n[[File:Long Branch Saloon interior.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of the actual interior of the real-life [[Long Branch Saloon]] in [[Dodge City, Kansas]], taken between 1870 and 1885]]\n''Gunsmoke'' was often a somber program, particularly in its early years. Dunning writes that Dillon <blockquote>\"played his hand and often lost. He arrived too late to prevent a lynching. He amputated a dying man's leg and lost the patient anyway. He saved a girl from brutal rapists then found himself unable to offer her what she needed to stop her from moving into ... life as a prostitute.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">(Dunning, 304)</ref></blockquote> Some listeners, such as Dunning, argue the radio version was more realistic. Episodes were aimed at adults and featured some of the most explicit content of their time, including violent crimes, [[scalping]]s, [[wikt:massacre|massacres]], and [[opium]] addicts. Many episodes ended on a somber note, and villains often got away with their crimes.\n\nNonetheless, due to the subtle scripts and outstanding ensemble cast, over the years, the program evolved into a warm, often humorous celebration of human nature. Despite Gunsmoke's realism in some areas, the show took liberties with accuracy in others. The program was set after the arrival of the railroad in Dodge City (1872) and Kansas had been a state since 1861. A U.S. Marshal (actually a deputy marshal, only the senior officer in the district holds the title \"marshal\") would not be based in Dodge City and would not be involved in local law enforcement. Any peace officer, then and now, also would not approach an armed individual with his side arm holstered, and give the suspect a chance to draw.\n\nApart from the doleful tone, ''Gunsmoke'' was distinct from other radio Westerns, as the dialogue was often slow and halting, and due to the outstanding [[sound effect]]s, listeners had a nearly palpable sense of the prairie where the show was set. The effects were subtle but multilayered, giving the show a spacious feel. [[John Dunning (radio historian)|John Dunning]] wrote, \"The listener heard extraneous dialogue in the background, just above the muted shouts of kids playing in an alley. He heard noises from the next block, too, where the inevitable dog was barking.\"<ref name=\"Dunning, 305\">(Dunning, 305)</ref>\n\n''Gunsmoke'' was also unique from other Westerns in that it was unsponsored in the first few years of production. The program got its support from CBS in the first two years. Series producers felt that if the show were sponsored, they would have to \"clean the show up\".<ref>(''Time'', 1953)</ref> The producers wanted to find a sponsor that would allow them to keep the show the way it was.<ref>{{cite news |title=Weeks of Prestige |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1953-03-23 |page=106}}</ref>\n\n=== Talk of adapting ''Gunsmoke'' to television ===\n\nNot long after the radio show began, talk began of adapting it to television. Privately, Macdonnell had a guarded interest in taking the show to television, but publicly, he declared, \"our show is perfect for radio,\" and he feared, as Dunning writes, \"''Gunsmoke'' confined by a picture could not possibly be as authentic or attentive to detail.\" \"In the end\", wrote Dunning, \"CBS simply took it away from Macdonnell and began preparing for the television version.\"<ref name=\"Dunning, 305\"/>\n\nConrad and the others were given auditions, but they were little more than token efforts\u2014especially in Conrad's case, due to his obesity. However, Meston was kept as the main writer. In the early years, a majority of the TV episodes were adapted from the radio scripts, often using identical scenes and dialogue. Dunning wrote, \"That radio fans considered the TV show a sham and its players impostors should surprise no one. That the TV show was not a sham is due in no small part to the continued strength of Meston's scripts.\" <ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMacdonnell and Meston continued the radio version of ''Gunsmoke'' until 1961, making it one of the most enduring vintage radio dramas.\n\nConrad directed two television episodes, in 1963 and 1971, while McNear appeared on six, playing characters other than Doc, including three times as storekeeper Howard Rudd.\n\n== Television series (1955\u20131975) ==\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name = Gunsmoke\n| image = Gunsmoke (title screen).jpg\n| caption = \n| developer = [[Charles Marquis Warren]]\n| based_on = ''Gunsmoke'' created by<br>[[John Meston]]<br>[[Norman Macdonnell]]\n| starring = {{Plainlist|\n* [[James Arness]]\n* [[Milburn Stone]]\n* [[Amanda Blake]]\n* [[Dennis Weaver]]\n* [[Burt Reynolds]]\n* [[Ken Curtis]]\n* [[Roger Ewing]]\n* [[Buck Taylor]]\n}}\n| theme_music_composer = [[Rex Koury]]<br>[[Glenn Spencer (composer)|Glenn Spencer]]\n| country = United States\n| num_seasons = 6 (''Marshal Dillon'', syndication retitling of half-hour episodes)<br>14 (''Gunsmoke''),<br>20 (total seasons)\n| num_episodes = 233 (''Marshal Dillon'', syndication retitling of half-hour episodes), 402 (''Gunsmoke'')<br>635 (total episodes)\n| list_episodes = List of Gunsmoke television episodes\n  | runtime = 26 minutes (1955\u20131961),<br /> 50 minutes (1961\u20131975)\n| company = [[CBS Television Studios|CBS Productions]]<br>[[Filmaster Productions]]<br>[[James Arness|Arness and Company]]<br>(1959\u20131961)<br>[[James Arness|The Arness Production Company]]<br>(1961\u20131964)\n| distributor = [[CBS Television Distribution]] (current)\n| network = [[CBS]]\n| picture_format = [[Black-and-white|Black and white]] (1955\u20131966) <br> [[Color television|Color]] (1966\u20131975)\n| first_aired = {{Start date|1955|9|10}}\n| last_aired = {{End date|1975|3|31}}\n|}}\n\nThe TV series ran from September 10, 1955, to March 31, 1975, on CBS, with 635 total episodes.

Conrad's weight was rumored to be a deciding factor. [[Denver Pyle]] was also considered for the leading role, as was [[Raymond Burr]], who was ultimately also seen as too heavy for the part. [[Charles Marquis Warren|Charles Warren]], television ''Gunsmoke'''s first director, said, \"His voice was fine, but he was too big. When he stood up, his chair stood with him.\"<ref>[http://gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/91-MattBurr.htm \"Raymond Burr auditioned for the role of television's Matt Dillon\"], GunsmokeNet.com.</ref> According to Dennis Weaver's comments on the 50th Anniversary DVD, disc one, episode \"Hack Prine\", John Wayne was never considered for the role; to have done so would have been preposterous, since Wayne was a top movie leading man. The belief that Wayne was asked to star is disputed by Warren. Although he agrees Wayne encouraged Arness to take the role, Warren says, \"I hired Jim Arness on the strength of a picture he's done for me ... I never thought for a moment of offering it to Wayne.\"<ref name=\"Wayne\" />\n\nAccording to Thomas \"Duke\" Miller, a TV/movie/celebrity expert, this story was told to him by legendary actor [[James Stewart]]: <blockquote>\"Jimmy said he was in the office with Charles Warren when Mr. Wayne came in. Mr. Warren asked Wayne if he knew James Arness, and Mr. Wayne said yes. Mr. Warren told Mr. Wayne about the transition of the show from radio to TV, and Mr. Wayne readily agreed that James Arness would be a terrific choice for the part of Matt Dillon. I have no reason to doubt the story, because Jimmy absolutely knew everybody.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn the end, the primary roles were all recast, with Arness taking the lead role of Marshal Matt Dillon (on the recommendation of Wayne, who also introduced the pilot), Dennis Weaver playing Chester Goode, Milburn Stone being cast as Dr. G. \"Doc\" Adams (later Galen \"Doc\" Adams), and Amanda Blake taking on the role of Miss Kitty Russell. Macdonnell became the associate producer of the TV show and later the producer. Meston was named head writer.\n\n{{quote|Good evening. My name's Wayne. Some of you may have seen me before; I hope so.

Three of the actors, who played Dodge deputies, Ken Curtis, Roger Ewing, and Buck Taylor, had previous guest roles. Curtis, a big band and Western singer ([[Tommy Dorsey]] Orchestra, [[Shep Fields]] Band, [[Sons of the Pioneers]]), had five previous guest roles, including one in 1963 as a shady ladies' man named Kyle Kelly (\"Lover Boy,\" season 9, show two [episode 307]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0594225/?ref_=ttep_ep24|title=\"Gunsmoke\" Lover Boy (TV Episode 1963)|author=Morganalee|date=November 16, 2010|work=IMDb|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nCurtis first appeared in the 1959 episode \"Jayhawkers\" (season four, episode 21 [episode 138]), wherein he played Phil Jacks, a Texas cowboy, with Jack Elam as his boss during a cattle drive from Texas. The second was another 1959 episode entitled \"Change of Heart\" (season four, episode 32 [episode 149]), where he played Brisco. The third appearance is the 1960 episode \"The Ex-Urbanites\" (season five, episode 30 [episode 186]), where he plays Jesse. He also had a small role as an Indian named Scout in the episode \"Speak Me Fair\" (season five, episode 34 [episode 190]) in 1960. Curtis was reared in [[Las Animas, Colorado]], and for a time was a son-in-law of director [[John Ford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0594366/|title=\"Gunsmoke\" Speak Me Fair (TV Episode 1960)|author=dougdoepke|date=April 30, 2013|work=IMDb|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, Weaver left the series to pursue a broader acting career in TV series and films. In 1964, Curtis was signed as a regular to play the stubbornly illiterate hillbilly Festus Haggen. The character, heretofore a comic feature, came to town in a 1962 episode titled \"Us Haggens\" to avenge the death of his twin brother Fergus, and decided to stay in Dodge when the deed was done. Initially on the fringes of Dodge society, Festus was slowly phased in as a reliable sidekick/part-time deputy to Matt Dillon when Reynolds left in 1965. In the episode \"Alias Festus Haggen\", he is mistaken for a robber and killer, whom he has to expose, to free himself (both parts played by Curtis). In a [[comic relief]] episode, \"Mad Dog\", another case of mistaken identity forces Festus to fight three sons of a man killed by his cousin. As a side note, only one episode has all three actors in it playing their respective roles, in the 1964 episode entitled \"Prairie Wolfer\" (season 9, episode 16 [episode 321]), with Dennis Weaver as Chester, Burt Reynolds as Quint, and Ken Curtis as Festus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0594317/|title=Gunsmoke (TV Series 1955\u20131975)|work=IMDb|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> The 1964 episode entitled \"Once a Haggen\" (season 9, episode 18 [episode 323]) is the second of only two occasions in which Chester and Festus appear in the same episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0594296/|title=Gunsmoke (TV Series 1955\u20131975)|work=IMDb|access-date=December 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen Milburn Stone left the series for heart bypass surgery in 1971, [[Pat Hingle]] played his temporary replacement, Dr. John Chapman, for several episodes. His presence was at first roundly resisted by Festus, a bickersome but close friend of Doc Adams.\n\nWell-known actors played \"visiting characters\".\nJeanette Nolan played Dirty Sally in several episodes.\n\n=== Character back stories ===\n\n[[File:Gunsmoke main cast 1967.JPG|right|thumb|Clockwise from top: Ken Curtis (Festus), James Arness (Matt), Amanda Blake (Kitty), and Milburn Stone (Doc) in 1968]]\nThe back stories of some of the main characters were largely left to the imagination of the viewer. Matt Dillon spent his early years in foster care, knew the Bible, was a wayward, brawling cowboy, and was later mentored by a caring lawman. In a few episodes, he mentions having spent some time in the army. Kitty Russell was born in New Orleans and reared by a flashy foster mother (who once visited Dodge), although her father visited Dodge on one occasion and wished to have her return to New Orleans. <!-- (See \"Miss Kitty\" in the following section \"Differences between the characters on the radio & TV versions\".) --> Barkeep Sam is said to be married, but no wife is ever seen. (In the episode \"Tafton\", he is seen side-by-side with a woman in a church singing.)\n\nQuint Asper's white father was killed by white scavengers. Thad Greenwood's father, a storekeeper, was harassed to death by a trio of loathsome ne'er-do-well thieves. Chester Goode is known to be one of many brothers raised by an aunt and uncle, and on one occasion, he mentions his mother; he refers to past service in the cavalry and years as a [[Cattle drives in the United States|cattle driver]] in Texas. The cause of Chester's stiff right leg is never given, but it is shown as his own leg and not a prosthesis. No direct reference to his disability is ever made in the script, although some oblique moments paint the free-spirited, comic deputy with a darker tone. Newly O'Brien was named after a physician uncle who ignited his interest in medicine.\n\nWhile Dillon and Miss Kitty clearly have a close personal relationship, the two never marry. In a July 2, 2002, [[Associated Press]] interview with Bob Thomas, Arness explained, \"If they were man and wife, it would make a lot of difference. The people upstairs decided it was better to leave the show as it was, which I totally agreed with.\" In the episode \"Waste\", featuring [[Johnny Whitaker]] as a boy with a prostitute mother, her madam questions Dillon as to why the law overlooks Miss Kitty's enterprise. Apparently, bordellos could exist \"at the law's discretion,\" (meaning the marshal's). As a historical matter, prior to the [[First World War]], few laws criminalized [[prostitution in the United States]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/when-prostitution-wasnt-crime-fascinating-history-sex-work-america |title=When Prostitution Wasn't a Crime: The Fascinating History of Sex Work in America |first=Melissa Gira |last=Grant |date=February 18, 2013 |publisher= |via=AlterNet}}</ref> The nearest that Matt and Miss Kitty have to a romantic evening together is when they try to have dinner over the Long Branch Saloon (\"A Quiet Day In Dodge\", 1973). Unfortunately, Marshal Dillon has been going over 30 hours without sleep, and when Kitty is distracted, he falls soundly asleep.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0593975/reviews |title=\"Gunsmoke\" A Quiet Day in Dodge (TV Episode 1973) |publisher= |via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> The nearest Miss Kitty gets to being married is when she has to pretend to be married to Cavalry Sgt. Holly to save her from a robber gang (\"Sergeant Holly\", 1970). By the time of the \"Gold Train\" episode, Kitty remembers when she first met Matt \u2013 17 years before. Miss Kitty was written out in 1974. The actress said she was tired and quit to protect the cast and crew she loved so much.\nWhen Blake decided not to return for the show's 20th (and final) season, the character was said to have returned to New Orleans. She was replaced by the hoarse-voiced, matronly actress [[Fran Ryan]] (known to many as the second Doris Ziffel on CBS's ''[[Green Acres]]''.)\n\nFor over a decade on television, a sign hung over Doc's office that read \"Dr. G. Adams\". Milburn Stone was given free rein to choose the character's first name. The actor chose the name of the ancient Greek physician and medical researcher [[Galen]]. He is first referred to in this manner by [[Theodore Bikel]] as \"Martin Kellums\" in the season-10 episode, \"Song for Dying\", aired February 13, 1965.<ref>[[List of Gunsmoke television episodes]]</ref>\n\n=== Radio and TV character differences ===\n\n[[File:Dennis Weaver Mariette Hartley Gunsmoke 1962.JPG|thumb|right|Dennis Weaver and [[Mariette Hartley]], 1962]]\nDifferences were noted between the characters on the radio and TV versions of ''Gunsmoke.'' In the radio series, Doc was acerbic, somewhat mercenary, and borderline alcoholic, at least in the program's early years. On radio's ''Gunsmoke'', Doc Adams's real name was Dr. Calvin Moore.<ref>[http://gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/76-DocsRealName.htm \"On radio's ''Gunsmoke'', Doc Adams' real name was Dr. Calvin Moore\"], GunsmokeNet.com.</ref> He came west and changed his name to escape a charge of murder. The television Doc, though still crusty, was in many ways softer and warmer.\n\nNothing in the radio series suggested that Chester Proudfoot was disabled; this merely visual feature was added to the Chester Goode character on television because of actor Dennis Weaver's athletic build, to emphasize Chester's role as a follower and not an independent agent.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nMiss Kitty, who after the radio series ended, was said by some to have engaged in prostitution, began in that role in the television series, working in the Long Branch Saloon. In an earlier 1956 episode (\"How to Cure a Friend\", season two, episode seven), the owner of the Long Branch was named Bill Pence (a role played by at least three different actors over the years). A later episode (\"Daddy O\", Season two, episode 36, filmed in 1956 and aired in 1957) begins with Chester pointing out to Matt (who had been out of town) a new sign under the Long Branch Saloon sign saying \"Russell & Pence, Proprietors\". In that same episode, John Dehner portrayed a dubious New Orleans businessman claiming to be Kitty's father, who tried to talk her into selling her half interest in the Long Branch and returning to New Orleans with him as a partner in his alleged freight business. In another 1956 episode (involving a new saloon girl named \"Rena Decker\", who causes four deaths by provoking men into fighting over her), Miss Kitty identifies herself as half-owner of the Long Branch with Mr. Pence (played by Judson Pratt). Subsequently, Miss Kitty transitioned to sole owner. Although early film episodes showed her descending from her second-floor rooms in the saloon with Matt, or showed her or one of her girls leading a cowboy up to those same rooms, these scenes disappeared later on, and viewers were guided to see Miss Kitty just as a kindhearted businesswoman.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n=== Format ===\n\nFrom 1955 to 1961, ''Gunsmoke'' was a half-hour show (retitled ''Marshal Dillon'' in syndication). It then went to an hour-long format. The series was retitled ''Gun Law'' in the UK. The ''Marshal Dillon'' syndicated rerun lasted from 1961 until 1964 on CBS, originally on Tuesday nights within its time in reruns.\n\n=== Popularity ===\n\n''Gunsmoke'' was TV's number one-ranked show from 1957 to 1961 before slipping into a decline after expanding to an hour. In 1967, the show's 12th season, CBS planned to cancel the series, but widespread viewer reaction (including a mention in Congress and the behind-the-scenes pressure from [[Babe Paley]], the wife of CBS's longtime president [[William S. Paley]]) prevented its demise. On the Biography Channel's ''Behind The Scenes: Gilligan's Island'' (2002), ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' producer [[Sherwood Schwartz]] states that Babe pressured her husband not to cancel ''Gunsmoke'' in 1967, so the network cut ''Gilligan's Island'' instead. The show continued in its new time slot at 8&nbsp;pm on Mondays. This scheduling move led to a spike in ratings that had it once again rally to the top 10 in the [[Nielsen ratings]], which again saved the series when CBS [[Rural purge|purged most of its rural content]] in 1971. The series remained in the top 10 until the 1973\u201374 television season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1973.htm |title=ClassicTVHits.com: TV Ratings > 1970's |publisher= |accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> In September 1975, despite still ranking among the top-30 programs in the ratings, ''Gunsmoke'' was cancelled after a 20-year run; it was replaced by ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show|Mary Tyler Moore]]'' spin-offs ''[[Rhoda]]'' and ''[[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis]]'' (though ''Rhoda'' actually debuted while ''Gunsmoke'' was still airing first-run). Thirty TV Westerns came and went during its 20-year tenure, and ''Gunsmoke'' was the sole survivor, with ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]'' and ''[[Bonanza]]'' both leaving the airwaves 2 1/2 years earlier in January 1973.\n\n<!--not related [[Image:Coffeepot at Cracker Barrel, Lubbock, TX IMG 4686.JPG|200px|right|thumb|For most of its run, ''Gunsmoke'' ran its closing credits over a photograph of a coffee pot sitting on a stove in the [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]] jail.

According to Arness, \"We didn't do a final, wrap-up show. We finished the 20th year, we all expected to go on for another season, or two or three. The (network) never told anybody they were thinking of canceling.\" The cast and crew read the news in the trade papers.<ref>Associated Press, July 2, 2002, Bob Thomas.</ref> This seemed to have been a habit of CBS. Three other popular shows, ''Gilligan's Island'', ''Lost in Space'', and ''The Incredible Hulk'' met the same fate, in the same, abrupt manner.\n\n=== TV movies ===\n\nIn 1987, CBS commissioned a reunion movie entitled ''[[Gunsmoke: Return to Dodge]]''. James Arness and Amanda Blake returned in their iconic roles of Matt Dillon and Miss Kitty, with Fran Ryan returning in her role as Kitty's friend/saloon-owner Hannah and Buck Taylor returning as Newly O'Brian. Doc Adams and Festus Haggen were not featured in the film. Milburn Stone had died 7 years earlier in 1980 and the role of Doc was not recast. Ken Curtis, meanwhile, balked at the salary offer he received and said that he should be paid based on Festus' importance in the character hierarchy. The screenwriters responded to Curtis' absence by making Newly the new Dodge City marshal. The film, shot in [[Alberta]], featured a now-retired Marshal Dillon being attacked and a vengeful former rival returning to Dodge City to entrap him.\n\nIn 1990, the second telefilm, ''Gunsmoke: The Last Apache'', premiered. Since Amanda Blake had died the year before, the writers decided to revisit a 1973 episode for the movie. The episode was based on \"Matt's Love Story\", which was noted for the marshal's first overnight visit to a female's lodgings.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} In the episode, Matt loses his memory and his heart during a brief [[affair|liaison]] with \"Mike\" Yardner (played by [[Michael Learned]]).<ref group=\"notes>The character and the actor are both women.</ref> In the film, Learned returns as Mike, who reveals to Marshal Dillon that he is the father of their daughter,<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.ohio.com/akron/entertainment/tv/heldenfels-mailbag-the-little-couple-jean-peters-game-show-prizes |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171107011436/https://www.ohio.com/akron/entertainment/tv/heldenfels-mailbag-the-little-couple-jean-peters-game-show-prizes |archivedate=November 7, 2017 |title=Heldenfels' Mailbag: 'The Little Couple,' Jean Peters, game show prizes |last=Heldenfels |first=Rich |work=[[Akron Beacon-Journal]] |date=July 23, 2017 |accessdate=September 30, 2018}}</ref> Beth (played by [[Amy Stock-Poynton]]) and asks him for help in saving her.

When first-run, prime-time episodes of ''Gunsmoke'' expanded to an hour in fall 1961, CBS-TV reran the half-hour episodes as ''Marshal Dillon'' on the network on Tuesday nights from 1961 through 1964. These were later rerun in syndication. General syndication ended in the 1980s, but they do air occasionally on cable TV. Local stations would show the retitled ''Marshal Dillon'' version of the series, while the series under the original ''Gunsmoke'' title (with some episodes under the ''Marshal Dillon'' retitling) were seen in the late 1990s on [[TV Land]] and later [[Hallmark Channel]]. STARZ! [[Encore (TV channel)#Channels|Westerns]] Channel aired this version under the ''Marshal Dillon'' title. [[RetroPlex]] also aired two half-hour episodes under the original ''Gunsmoke'' title, although the episodes are advertised as ''Marshal Dillon'', on Saturday nights from 8 to 9 pm Eastern time. [[MeTV]] announced that it will begin the half-hour black-and-white episodes beginning on January 2, 2017.\n* '''1961\u201366 one-hour black-and-white episodes''': These episodes have not been widely seen in regular syndication since the 1980s, although selected episodes did air from the mid-1980s through the early 1990s on [[ABC Family|CBN Cable/The Family Channel]], and later on Encore Westerns on a three-year contract that ended around 2006. As of January 2010, Encore Westerns was again airing the episodes. In October 2015, MeTV announced that it would begin airing the one-hour black-and-white episodes on October 26.<ref>[http://www.metv.com/lists/6-classic-black-and-white-episodes-of-gunsmoke Classic black and white episodes of ''Gunsmoke''] at MeTV.com</ref>\n* '''1966\u201375 one-hour color episodes''': The last nine seasons of the Western, the most widely syndicated episodes of the entire series run, are still aired on some local stations, as well as nationally on TV Land and MeTV.\n\n===Home media===\n\nIn 2006, as part of ''Gunsmoke''{{'}}s 50th anniversary on TV, certain selected episodes were released on DVD in three different box sets. Twelve episodes, from 1955 to 1964, were selected for the ''Gunsmoke: Volume I'' box set, and another twelve episodes, from 1964 to 1975, were selected for the ''Gunsmoke: Volume II'' box set. Both sets are also available as a combined single \"Gift Box Set\". A third unique DVD box set, known as ''Gunsmoke: The Directors Collection'', was also released with 10 selected episodes from certain seasons throughout the series' 20-year history. All of these box sets are available on Region 1 DVD from [[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount Home Entertainment]] and [[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS DVD]].\n\nAdditionally, Paramount Home Entertainment and CBS DVD have released seasons 1 through 19 (seasons one to six are known as the \"half-hour years\") on DVD in Region 1. The final 20th season will be released on May 5, 2020 along with the entire series in one box set. All DVDs have been released with English audio and close captioning from season 1 to 5 and starting season 6 English SDH.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ DVD releases&nbsp;\u2014 Seasons 1-19\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!

Two versions were recorded. The first, recorded in June 1949, was very much like a hardboiled detective series and starred [[Michael Rye]] (credited as Rye Billsbury) as Dillon;<ref>The Billsbury version of June 1949 is available at https://open.spotify.com/episode/4pTJkv4h9IngjwUpQ09PzV</ref><ref name=\"BigBroadcast\" /> the second, recorded in July 1949, starred ''[[Straight Arrow]]'' actor [[Howard Culver]] in a more Western, lighter version of the same script.<ref>The Culver version of July 1949 is available at https://open.spotify.com/episode/3NGrKyv5wM4trxcDEULOm7</ref><ref>Both versions included [[June Foray]], [[Gerald Mohr]], [[Vic Perrin]] and [[Jay Novello]] in the cast.</ref> CBS liked the Culver version better, and Ackerman was told to proceed.\n\nA complication arose, though; Culver's contract as the star of ''Straight Arrow'' would not allow him to do another Western series.

''Gunsmoke'' was set in Dodge City, Kansas, during the thriving cattle days of the 1870s. Dunning<ref>Dunning, p. 303.</ref> notes, \"The show drew critical acclaim for unprecedented realism.\"\n\n=== Radio cast and character biographies ===\nThe radio series first aired on CBS on April 26, 1952 with the episode \"Billy the Kid\", written by [[Walter Newman (screenwriter)|Walter Newman]], and ended on June 18, 1961.

Two versions of the same pilot episode titled \"Mark Dillon Goes to Gouge Eye\" were produced with two different actors, Rye Billsbury and Howard Culver, playing Marshal \"Mark\" Dillon<!-- sic --> as the lead, not yet played by Conrad. Conrad was one of the last actors to audition for the role of Marshal Dillon. With a resonantly powerful and distinctive voice, Conrad was already one of radio's busiest actors. Though Meston championed him, Macdonnell thought Conrad might be overexposed. During his audition, however, Conrad won over Macdonnell after reading only a few lines. Dillon, as portrayed by Conrad, was a lonely, isolated man, toughened by a hard life. Macdonnell later claimed, \"Much of Matt Dillon's character grew out of Bill Conrad.\"<ref>[http://gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/79-WilliamDillon.htm \"Matt Dillon's character grew out of Bill Conrad\"], GunsmokeNet.com.</ref>\n\nMeston relished the upending of cherished Western fiction clich\u00e9s and felt that few Westerns gave any inkling of how brutal the Old West was in reality. Many episodes were based on man's cruelty to man and woman, inasmuch as the prairie woman's life and the painful treatment of women as [[Personal property|chattels]] were touched on well ahead of their time in most media. As originally pitched to CBS executives, this was to be an adult Western, not a grown-up [[Hopalong Cassidy]].\n\nDunning writes that Meston was especially disgusted by the archetypal Western hero and set out \"to destroy [that type of] character he loathed\". In Meston's view, \"Dillon was almost as scarred as the homicidal psychopaths who drifted into Dodge from all directions.\"<ref name=\"Dunning, 304\">Dunning, 304.</ref>\n\n==== Chester ====\nChester was played by [[Parley Baer]] on radio, and by [[Dennis Weaver]] on television.\nChester's character had no surname until Baer [[Ad libitum|ad libbed]] \"Proudfoot\" during an early rehearsal. Initial ''Gunsmoke'' scripts gave him no name at all; his lines were simply slugged{{clarify|date=April 2019}} to be spoken by \"Townsman\". Again, Conrad's sense of what the program would be supervened, and Chester was born. Chester's middle initial was given as \"W\" in the June 15, 1958, episode \"Old Flame\", and a few episodes later, on the July 7, 1958, episode \"Marshal Proudfoot\", his middle name, and that of his 10 siblings, is revealed to be Wesley. The amiable Waco expatriate was usually described as Dillon's \"assistant\", but in the December 13, 1952, episode \"Post Martin\", Dillon described Chester as Dillon's deputy. Contradicting this description, in the July 5, 1954, episode \"Hank Prine\" (episode 116, minute 3:02) Dillon corrects a prisoner who describes Chester as his \"deputy\", stating \"Chester is not my deputy\", though they both agree Chester acts like he is. Whatever his title, Chester was Dillon's foil, friend, partner, and in an episode in which Chester nearly dies (\"Never Pester Chester\"), Dillon allows that Chester was the only person he could trust.\n\nThe TV series changed the newly limping Chester's last name from Proudfoot to Goode. Chester was played by Dennis Weaver, who went on to star in the [[NBC]] ''[[NBC Mystery Movie|Mystery Movie]]'' rotating TV series entry of a police drama with a comedic touch, ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', in the early 1970s. Weaver, himself an impressive 6'2\", often looked small alongside Arness' height at 6'7\"; this could be partly due to the character Chester having a limp. Season two, episode 25 reveals that Chester was in the army. He would not have had the limp then, so probably got injured in the Civil War, not long ago, but long enough that he would have learned to live with the limp and virtually forget it.\n\n==== Doc Adams ====\n[[Howard McNear]] starred as Dr. Charles Adams in the radio series, with [[Milburn Stone]] portraying [[Dr. Galen Adams]] in the television version.\nIn the radio series, \"Doc\" Adams was initially a self-interested and somewhat dark character with a predilection for constantly attempting to increase his revenue through the procurement of autopsy fees. However, McNear's performances steadily became more warm-hearted and sympathetic. Most notably, this transformation began during (and progressed steadily following) the July 1952 episode \"Never Pester Chester\", in which a physician with a more compassionate and devoted temperament is essential to the plotline when Chester is near-fatally injured by two trouble-making Texas drovers.\n\nDoc Adams' backstory evokes a varied and experienced life: In some episodes, he had educational ties to [[Philadelphia]]; in others, he spent time as ship's doctor aboard the gambling boats that plied the [[Mississippi River]], which provided a background for his knowledge of [[New Orleans]] (and acquaintance with [[Mark Twain]]). In the January 31, 1953, episode \"Cavalcade\", a fuller history is offered, though subsequent programs kept close listeners' heads spinning. In \"Cavalcade\", his real name is Calvin Moore, educated in [[Boston]], and he practiced as a doctor for a year in [[Richmond, Virginia]], where he fell in love with a beautiful young woman, who was also being courted by a wealthy young man named Roger Beauregard. Beauregard forced Doc into fighting a duel with him, resulting in Beauregard's being shot and killed. Though it was a fair duel, as a Yankee and an outsider, Doc was forced to flee. The young woman fled after him and they were married in [[St. Louis]], but two months later, she died of [[typhus]].\n\nDoc wandered throughout the territories until he settled in [[Dodge City]] 17 years later under the name of \"Charles Adams\". The Adams moniker was another Conrad invention, borrowing the surname from cartoonist [[Charles Addams]] as a testament to Doc's initially ghoulish comportment.\n\n==== Miss Kitty ====\nKitty was played by [[Georgia Ellis]] on radio, and by [[Amanda Blake]] on TV.\nWhile actress Georgia Ellis first appeared in the radio episode \"Billy the Kid\" (April 26, 1952) as \"Francie Richards\" - a former girlfriend of Matt Dillon and the widow of a criminal - the character of \"Miss Kitty\" did not appear until the May 10, 1952, episode \"Jaliscoe\". Sometime in 1959, Ellis was billed as Georgia Hawkins instead of Georgia Ellis. Amanda Blake appeared in over 500 episodes of the television series, with her last being the April 1, 1974 episode titled, \"The Disciple\" when the character was last seen.\n\nIn the radio series, Kitty's profession was hinted at, but never explicit; in a 1953 interview with ''Time,'' Macdonnell declared, \"Kitty is just someone Matt has to visit every once in a while\".<ref name=\"Dunning, 304\"/> The magazine observed that she is \"obviously not selling chocolate bars\".<ref name=\"sixgungalahad\">{{Cite magazine |date=1959-03-30 |title=The Six-Gun Galahad |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,892441,00.html?internalid=ACA |magazine=TIME |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214134022/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,892441,00.html |archive-date=2008-02-14}}</ref> An out-take from the program makes this hilariously obvious.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/GunsmokeRehearsals |at=0:00:00\u20130:1:26 |title=Gunsmoke Rehearsals |work=Internet Archive |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref> The television show first portrayed Kitty as a saloon employee (dance-hall girl/prostitute), then from season three as half-owner of the [[Long Branch Saloon]].\n\n=== Distinction from other radio Westerns ===\n[[File:Long Branch Saloon interior.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of the actual interior of the real-life [[Long Branch Saloon]] in [[Dodge City, Kansas]], taken between 1870 and 1885]]\n''Gunsmoke'' was often a somber program, particularly in its early years. Dunning writes that Dillon <blockquote>\"played his hand and often lost. He arrived too late to prevent a lynching. He amputated a dying man's leg and lost the patient anyway. He saved a girl from brutal rapists then found himself unable to offer her what she needed to stop her from moving into ... life as a prostitute.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">(Dunning, 304)</ref></blockquote> Some listeners, such as Dunning, argue the radio version was more realistic. Episodes were aimed at adults and featured some of the most explicit content of their time, including violent crimes, [[scalping]]s, [[wikt:massacre|massacres]], and [[opium]] addicts. Many episodes ended on a somber note, and villains often got away with their crimes.\n\nNonetheless, due to the subtle scripts and outstanding ensemble cast, over the years, the program evolved into a warm, often humorous celebration of human nature. Despite Gunsmoke's realism in some areas, the show took liberties with accuracy in others. The program was set after the arrival of the railroad in Dodge City (1872) and Kansas had been a state since 1861. A U.S. Marshal (actually a deputy marshal, only the senior officer in the district holds the title \"marshal\") would not be based in Dodge City and would not be involved in local law enforcement. Any peace officer, then and now, also would not approach an armed individual with his side arm holstered, and give the suspect a chance to draw.\n\nApart from the doleful tone, ''Gunsmoke'' was distinct from other radio Westerns, as the dialogue was often slow and halting, and due to the outstanding [[sound effect]]s, listeners had a nearly palpable sense of the prairie where the show was set. The effects were subtle but multilayered, giving the show a spacious feel. [[John Dunning (radio historian)|John Dunning]] wrote, \"The listener heard extraneous dialogue in the background, just above the muted shouts of kids playing in an alley. He heard noises from the next block, too, where the inevitable dog was barking.\"<ref name=\"Dunning, 305\">(Dunning, 305)</ref>\n\n''Gunsmoke'' was also unique from other Westerns in that it was unsponsored in the first few years of production. The program got its support from CBS in the first two years. Series producers felt that if the show were sponsored, they would have to \"clean the show up\".<ref>(''Time'', 1953)</ref> The producers wanted to find a sponsor that would allow them to keep the show the way it was.<ref>{{cite news |title=Weeks of Prestige |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1953-03-23 |page=106}}</ref>\n\n=== Talk of adapting ''Gunsmoke'' to television ===\n\nNot long after the radio show began, talk began of adapting it to television. Privately, Macdonnell had a guarded interest in taking the show to television, but publicly, he declared, \"our show is perfect for radio,\" and he feared, as Dunning writes, \"''Gunsmoke'' confined by a picture could not possibly be as authentic or attentive to detail.\" \"In the end\", wrote Dunning, \"CBS simply took it away from Macdonnell and began preparing for the television version.\"<ref name=\"Dunning, 305\"/>\n\nConrad and the others were given auditions, but they were little more than token efforts\u2014especially in Conrad's case, due to his obesity. However, Meston was kept as the main writer. In the early years, a majority of the TV episodes were adapted from the radio scripts, often using identical scenes and dialogue. Dunning wrote, \"That radio fans considered the TV show a sham and its players impostors should surprise no one. That the TV show was not a sham is due in no small part to the continued strength of Meston's scripts.\" <ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMacdonnell and Meston continued the radio version of ''Gunsmoke'' until 1961, making it one of the most enduring vintage radio dramas.\n\nConrad directed two television episodes, in 1963 and 1971, while McNear appeared on six, playing characters other than Doc, including three times as storekeeper Howard Rudd.\n\n== Television series (1955\u20131975) ==\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name = Gunsmoke\n| image = Gunsmoke (title screen).jpg\n| caption = \n| developer = [[Charles Marquis Warren]]\n| based_on = ''Gunsmoke'' created by<br>[[John Meston]]<br>[[Norman Macdonnell]]\n| starring = {{Plainlist|\n* [[James Arness]]\n* [[Milburn Stone]]\n* [[Amanda Blake]]\n* [[Dennis Weaver]]\n* [[Burt Reynolds]]\n* [[Ken Curtis]]\n* [[Roger Ewing]]\n* [[Buck Taylor]]\n}}\n| theme_music_composer = [[Rex Koury]]<br>[[Glenn Spencer (composer)|Glenn Spencer]]\n| country = United States\n| num_seasons = 6 (''Marshal Dillon'', syndication retitling of half-hour episodes)<br>14 (''Gunsmoke''),<br>20 (total seasons)\n| num_episodes = 233 (''Marshal Dillon'', syndication retitling of half-hour episodes), 402 (''Gunsmoke'')<br>635 (total episodes)\n| list_episodes = List of Gunsmoke television episodes\n  | runtime = 26 minutes (1955\u20131961),<br /> 50 minutes (1961\u20131975)\n| company = [[CBS Television Studios|CBS Productions]]<br>[[Filmaster Productions]]<br>[[James Arness|Arness and Company]]<br>(1959\u20131961)<br>[[James Arness|The Arness Production Company]]<br>(1961\u20131964)\n| distributor = [[CBS Television Distribution]] (current)\n| network = [[CBS]]\n| picture_format = [[Black-and-white|Black and white]] (1955\u20131966) <br> [[Color television|Color]] (1966\u20131975)\n| first_aired = {{Start date|1955|9|10}}\n| last_aired = {{End date|1975|3|31}}\n|}}\n\nThe TV series ran from September 10, 1955, to March 31, 1975, on CBS, with 635 total episodes.

Conrad's weight was rumored to be a deciding factor. [[Denver Pyle]] was also considered for the leading role, as was [[Raymond Burr]], who was ultimately also seen as too heavy for the part. [[Charles Marquis Warren|Charles Warren]], television ''Gunsmoke'''s first director, said, \"His voice was fine, but he was too big. When he stood up, his chair stood with him.\"<ref>[http://gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/91-MattBurr.htm \"Raymond Burr auditioned for the role of television's Matt Dillon\"], GunsmokeNet.com.</ref> According to Dennis Weaver's comments on the 50th Anniversary DVD, disc one, episode \"Hack Prine\", John Wayne was never considered for the role; to have done so would have been preposterous, since Wayne was a top movie leading man. The belief that Wayne was asked to star is disputed by Warren. Although he agrees Wayne encouraged Arness to take the role, Warren says, \"I hired Jim Arness on the strength of a picture he's done for me ... I never thought for a moment of offering it to Wayne.\"<ref name=\"Wayne\" />\n\nAccording to Thomas \"Duke\" Miller, a TV/movie/celebrity expert, this story was told to him by legendary actor [[James Stewart]]: <blockquote>\"Jimmy said he was in the office with Charles Warren when Mr. Wayne came in. Mr. Warren asked Wayne if he knew James Arness, and Mr. Wayne said yes. Mr. Warren told Mr. Wayne about the transition of the show from radio to TV, and Mr. Wayne readily agreed that James Arness would be a terrific choice for the part of Matt Dillon. I have no reason to doubt the story, because Jimmy absolutely knew everybody.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn the end, the primary roles were all recast, with Arness taking the lead role of Marshal Matt Dillon (on the recommendation of Wayne, who also introduced the pilot), Dennis Weaver playing Chester Goode, Milburn Stone being cast as Dr. G. \"Doc\" Adams (later Galen \"Doc\" Adams), and Amanda Blake taking on the role of Miss Kitty Russell. Macdonnell became the associate producer of the TV show and later the producer. Meston was named head writer.\n\n{{quote|Good evening. My name's Wayne. Some of you may have seen me before; I hope so.

Three of the actors, who played Dodge deputies, Ken Curtis, Roger Ewing, and Buck Taylor, had previous guest roles. Curtis, a big band and Western singer ([[Tommy Dorsey]] Orchestra, [[Shep Fields]] Band, [[Sons of the Pioneers]]), had five previous guest roles, including one in 1963 as a shady ladies' man named Kyle Kelly (\"Lover Boy,\" season 9, show two [episode 307]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0594225/?ref_=ttep_ep24|title=\"Gunsmoke\" Lover Boy (TV Episode 1963)|author=Morganalee|date=November 16, 2010|work=IMDb|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nCurtis first appeared in the 1959 episode \"Jayhawkers\" (season four, episode 21 [episode 138]), wherein he played Phil Jacks, a Texas cowboy, with Jack Elam as his boss during a cattle drive from Texas. The second was another 1959 episode entitled \"Change of Heart\" (season four, episode 32 [episode 149]), where he played Brisco. The third appearance is the 1960 episode \"The Ex-Urbanites\" (season five, episode 30 [episode 186]), where he plays Jesse. He also had a small role as an Indian named Scout in the episode \"Speak Me Fair\" (season five, episode 34 [episode 190]) in 1960. Curtis was reared in [[Las Animas, Colorado]], and for a time was a son-in-law of director [[John Ford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0594366/|title=\"Gunsmoke\" Speak Me Fair (TV Episode 1960)|author=dougdoepke|date=April 30, 2013|work=IMDb|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, Weaver left the series to pursue a broader acting career in TV series and films. In 1964, Curtis was signed as a regular to play the stubbornly illiterate hillbilly Festus Haggen. The character, heretofore a comic feature, came to town in a 1962 episode titled \"Us Haggens\" to avenge the death of his twin brother Fergus, and decided to stay in Dodge when the deed was done. Initially on the fringes of Dodge society, Festus was slowly phased in as a reliable sidekick/part-time deputy to Matt Dillon when Reynolds left in 1965. In the episode \"Alias Festus Haggen\", he is mistaken for a robber and killer, whom he has to expose, to free himself (both parts played by Curtis). In a [[comic relief]] episode, \"Mad Dog\", another case of mistaken identity forces Festus to fight three sons of a man killed by his cousin. As a side note, only one episode has all three actors in it playing their respective roles, in the 1964 episode entitled \"Prairie Wolfer\" (season 9, episode 16 [episode 321]), with Dennis Weaver as Chester, Burt Reynolds as Quint, and Ken Curtis as Festus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0594317/|title=Gunsmoke (TV Series 1955\u20131975)|work=IMDb|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> The 1964 episode entitled \"Once a Haggen\" (season 9, episode 18 [episode 323]) is the second of only two occasions in which Chester and Festus appear in the same episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0594296/|title=Gunsmoke (TV Series 1955\u20131975)|work=IMDb|access-date=December 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen Milburn Stone left the series for heart bypass surgery in 1971, [[Pat Hingle]] played his temporary replacement, Dr. John Chapman, for several episodes. His presence was at first roundly resisted by Festus, a bickersome but close friend of Doc Adams.\n\nWell-known actors played \"visiting characters\".\nJeanette Nolan played Dirty Sally in several episodes.\n\n=== Character back stories ===\n\n[[File:Gunsmoke main cast 1967.JPG|right|thumb|Clockwise from top: Ken Curtis (Festus), James Arness (Matt), Amanda Blake (Kitty), and Milburn Stone (Doc) in 1968]]\nThe back stories of some of the main characters were largely left to the imagination of the viewer. Matt Dillon spent his early years in foster care, knew the Bible, was a wayward, brawling cowboy, and was later mentored by a caring lawman. In a few episodes, he mentions having spent some time in the army. Kitty Russell was born in New Orleans and reared by a flashy foster mother (who once visited Dodge), although her father visited Dodge on one occasion and wished to have her return to New Orleans. <!-- (See \"Miss Kitty\" in the following section \"Differences between the characters on the radio & TV versions\".) --> Barkeep Sam is said to be married, but no wife is ever seen. (In the episode \"Tafton\", he is seen side-by-side with a woman in a church singing.)\n\nQuint Asper's white father was killed by white scavengers. Thad Greenwood's father, a storekeeper, was harassed to death by a trio of loathsome ne'er-do-well thieves. Chester Goode is known to be one of many brothers raised by an aunt and uncle, and on one occasion, he mentions his mother; he refers to past service in the cavalry and years as a [[Cattle drives in the United States|cattle driver]] in Texas. The cause of Chester's stiff right leg is never given, but it is shown as his own leg and not a prosthesis. No direct reference to his disability is ever made in the script, although some oblique moments paint the free-spirited, comic deputy with a darker tone. Newly O'Brien was named after a physician uncle who ignited his interest in medicine.\n\nWhile Dillon and Miss Kitty clearly have a close personal relationship, the two never marry. In a July 2, 2002, [[Associated Press]] interview with Bob Thomas, Arness explained, \"If they were man and wife, it would make a lot of difference. The people upstairs decided it was better to leave the show as it was, which I totally agreed with.\" In the episode \"Waste\", featuring [[Johnny Whitaker]] as a boy with a prostitute mother, her madam questions Dillon as to why the law overlooks Miss Kitty's enterprise. Apparently, bordellos could exist \"at the law's discretion,\" (meaning the marshal's). As a historical matter, prior to the [[First World War]], few laws criminalized [[prostitution in the United States]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/when-prostitution-wasnt-crime-fascinating-history-sex-work-america |title=When Prostitution Wasn't a Crime: The Fascinating History of Sex Work in America |first=Melissa Gira |last=Grant |date=February 18, 2013 |publisher= |via=AlterNet}}</ref> The nearest that Matt and Miss Kitty have to a romantic evening together is when they try to have dinner over the Long Branch Saloon (\"A Quiet Day In Dodge\", 1973). Unfortunately, Marshal Dillon has been going over 30 hours without sleep, and when Kitty is distracted, he falls soundly asleep.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0593975/reviews |title=\"Gunsmoke\" A Quiet Day in Dodge (TV Episode 1973) |publisher= |via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> The nearest Miss Kitty gets to being married is when she has to pretend to be married to Cavalry Sgt. Holly to save her from a robber gang (\"Sergeant Holly\", 1970). By the time of the \"Gold Train\" episode, Kitty remembers when she first met Matt \u2013 17 years before. Miss Kitty was written out in 1974. The actress said she was tired and quit to protect the cast and crew she loved so much.\nWhen Blake decided not to return for the show's 20th (and final) season, the character was said to have returned to New Orleans. She was replaced by the hoarse-voiced, matronly actress [[Fran Ryan]] (known to many as the second Doris Ziffel on CBS's ''[[Green Acres]]''.)\n\nFor over a decade on television, a sign hung over Doc's office that read \"Dr. G. Adams\". Milburn Stone was given free rein to choose the character's first name. The actor chose the name of the ancient Greek physician and medical researcher [[Galen]]. He is first referred to in this manner by [[Theodore Bikel]] as \"Martin Kellums\" in the season-10 episode, \"Song for Dying\", aired February 13, 1965.<ref>[[List of Gunsmoke television episodes]]</ref>\n\n=== Radio and TV character differences ===\n\n[[File:Dennis Weaver Mariette Hartley Gunsmoke 1962.JPG|thumb|right|Dennis Weaver and [[Mariette Hartley]], 1962]]\nDifferences were noted between the characters on the radio and TV versions of ''Gunsmoke.'' In the radio series, Doc was acerbic, somewhat mercenary, and borderline alcoholic, at least in the program's early years. On radio's ''Gunsmoke'', Doc Adams's real name was Dr. Calvin Moore.<ref>[http://gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/76-DocsRealName.htm \"On radio's ''Gunsmoke'', Doc Adams' real name was Dr. Calvin Moore\"], GunsmokeNet.com.</ref> He came west and changed his name to escape a charge of murder. The television Doc, though still crusty, was in many ways softer and warmer.\n\nNothing in the radio series suggested that Chester Proudfoot was disabled; this merely visual feature was added to the Chester Goode character on television because of actor Dennis Weaver's athletic build, to emphasize Chester's role as a follower and not an independent agent.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nMiss Kitty, who after the radio series ended, was said by some to have engaged in prostitution, began in that role in the television series, working in the Long Branch Saloon. In an earlier 1956 episode (\"How to Cure a Friend\", season two, episode seven), the owner of the Long Branch was named Bill Pence (a role played by at least three different actors over the years). A later episode (\"Daddy O\", Season two, episode 36, filmed in 1956 and aired in 1957) begins with Chester pointing out to Matt (who had been out of town) a new sign under the Long Branch Saloon sign saying \"Russell & Pence, Proprietors\". In that same episode, John Dehner portrayed a dubious New Orleans businessman claiming to be Kitty's father, who tried to talk her into selling her half interest in the Long Branch and returning to New Orleans with him as a partner in his alleged freight business. In another 1956 episode (involving a new saloon girl named \"Rena Decker\", who causes four deaths by provoking men into fighting over her), Miss Kitty identifies herself as half-owner of the Long Branch with Mr. Pence (played by Judson Pratt). Subsequently, Miss Kitty transitioned to sole owner. Although early film episodes showed her descending from her second-floor rooms in the saloon with Matt, or showed her or one of her girls leading a cowboy up to those same rooms, these scenes disappeared later on, and viewers were guided to see Miss Kitty just as a kindhearted businesswoman.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n=== Format ===\n\nFrom 1955 to 1961, ''Gunsmoke'' was a half-hour show (retitled ''Marshal Dillon'' in syndication). It then went to an hour-long format. The series was retitled ''Gun Law'' in the UK. The ''Marshal Dillon'' syndicated rerun lasted from 1961 until 1964 on CBS, originally on Tuesday nights within its time in reruns.\n\n=== Popularity ===\n\n''Gunsmoke'' was TV's number one-ranked show from 1957 to 1961 before slipping into a decline after expanding to an hour. In 1967, the show's 12th season, CBS planned to cancel the series, but widespread viewer reaction (including a mention in Congress and the behind-the-scenes pressure from [[Babe Paley]], the wife of CBS's longtime president [[William S. Paley]]) prevented its demise. On the Biography Channel's ''Behind The Scenes: Gilligan's Island'' (2002), ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' producer [[Sherwood Schwartz]] states that Babe pressured her husband not to cancel ''Gunsmoke'' in 1967, so the network cut ''Gilligan's Island'' instead. The show continued in its new time slot at 8&nbsp;pm on Mondays. This scheduling move led to a spike in ratings that had it once again rally to the top 10 in the [[Nielsen ratings]], which again saved the series when CBS [[Rural purge|purged most of its rural content]] in 1971. The series remained in the top 10 until the 1973\u201374 television season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1973.htm |title=ClassicTVHits.com: TV Ratings > 1970's |publisher= |accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> In September 1975, despite still ranking among the top-30 programs in the ratings, ''Gunsmoke'' was cancelled after a 20-year run; it was replaced by ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show|Mary Tyler Moore]]'' spin-offs ''[[Rhoda]]'' and ''[[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis]]'' (though ''Rhoda'' actually debuted while ''Gunsmoke'' was still airing first-run). Thirty TV Westerns came and went during its 20-year tenure, and ''Gunsmoke'' was the sole survivor, with ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]'' and ''[[Bonanza]]'' both leaving the airwaves 2 1/2 years earlier in January 1973.\n\n<!--not related [[Image:Coffeepot at Cracker Barrel, Lubbock, TX IMG 4686.JPG|200px|right|thumb|For most of its run, ''Gunsmoke'' ran its closing credits over a photograph of a coffee pot sitting on a stove in the [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]] jail. Pictured here is a pot similar to the one used on the TV show.]] -->\nArness and Stone remained with the show for its entire run, though Stone missed seven episodes in 1971 due to illness.\n\nThe entire cast was stunned by the cancellation, as they were unaware that CBS was considering it. According to Arness, \"We didn't do a final, wrap-up show. We finished the 20th year, we all expected to go on for another season, or two or three. The (network) never told anybody they were thinking of canceling.\" The cast and crew read the news in the trade papers.<ref>Associated Press, July 2, 2002, Bob Thomas.</ref> This seemed to have been a habit of CBS. Three other popular shows, ''Gilligan's Island'', ''Lost in Space'', and ''The Incredible Hulk'' met the same fate, in the same, abrupt manner.\n\n=== TV movies ===\n\nIn 1987, CBS commissioned a reunion movie entitled ''[[Gunsmoke: Return to Dodge]]''. James Arness and Amanda Blake returned in their iconic roles of Matt Dillon and Miss Kitty, with Fran Ryan returning in her role as Kitty's friend/saloon-owner Hannah and Buck Taylor returning as Newly O'Brian. Doc Adams and Festus Haggen were not featured in the film. Milburn Stone had died 7 years earlier in 1980 and the role of Doc was not recast. Ken Curtis, meanwhile, balked at the salary offer he received and said that he should be paid based on Festus' importance in the character hierarchy. The screenwriters responded to Curtis' absence by making Newly the new Dodge City marshal. The film, shot in [[Alberta]], featured a now-retired Marshal Dillon being attacked and a vengeful former rival returning to Dodge City to entrap him.\n\nIn 1990, the second telefilm, ''Gunsmoke: The Last Apache'', premiered. Since Amanda Blake had died the year before, the writers decided to revisit a 1973 episode for the movie. The episode was based on \"Matt's Love Story\", which was noted for the marshal's first overnight visit to a female's lodgings.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} In the episode, Matt loses his memory and his heart during a brief [[affair|liaison]] with \"Mike\" Yardner (played by [[Michael Learned]]).<ref group=\"notes>The character and the actor are both women.</ref> In the film, Learned returns as Mike, who reveals to Marshal Dillon that he is the father of their daughter,<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.ohio.com/akron/entertainment/tv/heldenfels-mailbag-the-little-couple-jean-peters-game-show-prizes |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171107011436/https://www.ohio.com/akron/entertainment/tv/heldenfels-mailbag-the-little-couple-jean-peters-game-show-prizes |archivedate=November 7, 2017 |title=Heldenfels' Mailbag: 'The Little Couple,' Jean Peters, game show prizes |last=Heldenfels |first=Rich |work=[[Akron Beacon-Journal]] |date=July 23, 2017 |accessdate=September 30, 2018}}</ref> Beth (played by [[Amy Stock-Poynton]]) and asks him for help in saving her.

When first-run, prime-time episodes of ''Gunsmoke'' expanded to an hour in fall 1961, CBS-TV reran the half-hour episodes as ''Marshal Dillon'' on the network on Tuesday nights from 1961 through 1964. These were later rerun in syndication. General syndication ended in the 1980s, but they do air occasionally on cable TV. Local stations would show the retitled ''Marshal Dillon'' version of the series, while the series under the original ''Gunsmoke'' title (with some episodes under the ''Marshal Dillon'' retitling) were seen in the late 1990s on [[TV Land]] and later [[Hallmark Channel]]. STARZ! [[Encore (TV channel)#Channels|Westerns]] Channel aired this version under the ''Marshal Dillon'' title. [[RetroPlex]] also aired two half-hour episodes under the original ''Gunsmoke'' title, although the episodes are advertised as ''Marshal Dillon'', on Saturday nights from 8 to 9 pm Eastern time. [[MeTV]] announced that it will begin the half-hour black-and-white episodes beginning on January 2, 2017.\n* '''1961\u201366 one-hour black-and-white episodes''': These episodes have not been widely seen in regular syndication since the 1980s, although selected episodes did air from the mid-1980s through the early 1990s on [[ABC Family|CBN Cable/The Family Channel]], and later on Encore Westerns on a three-year contract that ended around 2006. As of January 2010, Encore Westerns was again airing the episodes. In October 2015, MeTV announced that it would begin airing the one-hour black-and-white episodes on October 26.<ref>[http://www.metv.com/lists/6-classic-black-and-white-episodes-of-gunsmoke Classic black and white episodes of ''Gunsmoke''] at MeTV.com</ref>\n* '''1966\u201375 one-hour color episodes''': The last nine seasons of the Western, the most widely syndicated episodes of the entire series run, are still aired on some local stations, as well as nationally on TV Land and MeTV.\n\n===Home media===\n\nIn 2006, as part of ''Gunsmoke''{{'}}s 50th anniversary on TV, certain selected episodes were released on DVD in three different box sets. Twelve episodes, from 1955 to 1964, were selected for the ''Gunsmoke: Volume I'' box set, and another twelve episodes, from 1964 to 1975, were selected for the ''Gunsmoke: Volume II'' box set. Both sets are also available as a combined single \"Gift Box Set\". A third unique DVD box set, known as ''Gunsmoke: The Directors Collection'', was also released with 10 selected episodes from certain seasons throughout the series' 20-year history. All of these box sets are available on Region 1 DVD from [[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount Home Entertainment]] and [[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS DVD]].\n\nAdditionally, Paramount Home Entertainment and CBS DVD have released seasons 1 through 19 (seasons one to six are known as the \"half-hour years\") on DVD in Region 1. The final 20th season will be released on May 5, 2020 along with the entire series in one box set. All DVDs have been released with English audio and close captioning from season 1 to 5 and starting season 6 English SDH.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ DVD releases&nbsp;\u2014 Seasons 1-19\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!
