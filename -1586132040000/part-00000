Although privately developed at first, the City of Charleston floated bonds in 1931 to acquire a portion of the site for passenger service. Within ten years, three runways were paved and outfitted with lighting for nighttime operations. In [[World War II]], control of the airfield passed to the [[United States Army]] though civilian service was allowed to continue to use the airfield. After the war, the airfield reverted to civilian use for a short time. In 1949, a new passenger terminal was built.\n\nDuring the [[Korean War]], the airfield was reactivated for military use and in 1952, the City of Charleston and the [[United States Air Force]] reached an agreement on control of the base and the runways\u2014an arrangement that has been renegotiated over time and that continues to this day. In 1979, the civilian portions of the airport were transferred from the City of Charleston to the Charleston County Aviation Authority, which had operated two other airports in the area. The current terminal on the south end of the airport was built in the 1980s on land acquired by [[Georgia Pacific]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chs-airport.com/About-the-CCAA/Airport-History.aspx |title=Airport History |publisher=Chs Airport |date=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Charleston-Field-AFB-8594.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Charleston Field]], a U.S. Air Force base]]\n\nIn October 2009, [[Boeing]] announced that it would build a major plant on 265 acres at the airport as a second final assembly site for its [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787 Dreamliner]] commercial aircraft. The facility began limited operations in July 2011 and rolled out its first completed aircraft in April 2012. Additional facilities to complement aircraft assembly have since been announced by the company.<ref name=\"boeing.com\"/>\n\nThroughout its history, all three domestic legacy carriers ([[American Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], and [[United Airlines]]) and their predecessor companies or affiliates have served Charleston International Airport. Aside from the legacy carriers, Charleston has seen periods of additional air service from other carriers, but prior to 2010, those services were short-lived. The airport has had brief periods of international service. In 2001, [[Air Canada]] briefly served the airport from [[Toronto]] but ended service immediately after the [[September 11th attacks]]. [[Porter Airlines]] briefly served Charleston with flights to Toronto in 2015.\n\nSince 2010, the airport's passenger figures have doubled.<ref name=\"Charleston Post & Courier\">{{cite web |url= https://www.postandcourier.com/business/charleston-airport-saw-nearly-additional-passengers-in/article_41077776-2587-11e9-96a7-a3bc1c305600.html|title= Charleston Airport saw nearly 500,000 additional passengers in 2018|accessdate=March 9, 2019|publisher= [[Post & Courier]]|date= January 31, 2019}}</ref> New services established by additional airlines during this time along with increased services from the three legacy carriers have contributed to this growth.

Although privately developed at first, the City of Charleston floated bonds in 1931 to acquire a portion of the site for passenger service. Within ten years, three runways were paved and outfitted with lighting for nighttime operations. In [[World War II]], control of the airfield passed to the [[United States Army]] though civilian service was allowed to continue to use the airfield. After the war, the airfield reverted to civilian use for a short time. In 1949, a new passenger terminal was built.\n\nDuring the [[Korean War]], the airfield was reactivated for military use and in 1952, the City of Charleston and the [[United States Air Force]] reached an agreement on control of the base and the runways\u2014an arrangement that has been renegotiated over time and that continues to this day. In 1979, the civilian portions of the airport were transferred from the City of Charleston to the Charleston County Aviation Authority, which had operated two other airports in the area. The current terminal on the south end of the airport was built in the 1980s on land acquired by [[Georgia Pacific]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chs-airport.com/About-the-CCAA/Airport-History.aspx |title=Airport History |publisher=Chs Airport |date=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Charleston-Field-AFB-8594.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Charleston Field]], a U.S. Air Force base]]\n\nIn October 2009, [[Boeing]] announced that it would build a major plant on 265 acres at the airport as a second final assembly site for its [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787 Dreamliner]] commercial aircraft. The facility began limited operations in July 2011 and rolled out its first completed aircraft in April 2012. Additional facilities to complement aircraft assembly have since been announced by the company.<ref name=\"boeing.com\"/>\n\nThroughout its history, all three domestic legacy carriers ([[American Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], and [[United Airlines]]) and their predecessor companies or affiliates have served Charleston International Airport. Aside from the legacy carriers, Charleston has seen periods of additional air service from other carriers, but prior to 2010, those services were short-lived. The airport has had brief periods of international service. In 2001, [[Air Canada]] briefly served the airport from [[Toronto]] but ended service immediately after the [[September 11th attacks]]. [[Porter Airlines]] briefly served Charleston with flights to Toronto in 2015.\n\nSince 2010, the airport's passenger figures have doubled.<ref name=\"Charleston Post & Courier\">{{cite web |url= https://www.postandcourier.com/business/charleston-airport-saw-nearly-additional-passengers-in/article_41077776-2587-11e9-96a7-a3bc1c305600.html|title= Charleston Airport saw nearly 500,000 additional passengers in 2018|accessdate=March 9, 2019|publisher= [[Post & Courier]]|date= January 31, 2019}}</ref> New services established by additional airlines during this time along with increased services from the three legacy carriers have contributed to this growth.

The screenplay was written by Daniel Goldberg and [[Len Blum]].\n\nThe film is an [[Anthology film|anthology]] of various science fiction and fantasy stories adapted from ''Heavy Metal'' magazine and original stories in the same spirit. Like the magazine, the film features a great deal of [[graphic violence]], [[sexuality]], and [[nudity]]. Its production was expedited by having several [[animation company|animation houses]] working simultaneously on different segments.\n\nA sequel titled ''[[Heavy Metal 2000]]'' was released in 2000.\n\n==Plot==\n===Soft Landing===\nThe title sequence story opens with a [[space shuttle]] orbiting the Earth. The bay doors open, releasing a [[Chevrolet Corvette (C1)|Corvette]]. An [[astronaut]] seated in the car then begins descending through Earth's atmosphere, landing in a desert canyon.\n\n;Crew\n* [[Jimmy T.

He says he has something to show her. When he opens his case, a green, crystalline sphere rises out and melts him. It introduces itself to the terrified girl as \"the sum of all evils\". Looking into the orb known as the Loc-Nar, the girl sees how it has influenced societies throughout time and space.\n\n;Cast\n* [[Percy Rodriguez]] (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n* [[Don Francks]] as Grimaldi\n* Caroline Semple as Girl\n\n;Crew\n* [[Harold Whitaker]] \u2013 director\n* [[John Halas]] \u2013 producer\n\n===Harry Canyon===\nOriginal story by [[Daniel Goldberg (producer)|Daniel Goldberg]] and [[Len Blum]]; inspired by [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]]' ''[[The Long Tomorrow (comics)|The Long Tomorrow]]'' stories.\n\nIn a dystopian [[New York City]] in 2031, cynical taxicab driver Harry Canyon narrates his day in film-noir style, grumbling about his fares and occasional robbery attempts, which he thwarts with a [[disintegrator ray|disintegrator]] installed in the back of his seat. He stumbles into an incident where he rescues a girl from a gangster named Rudnick, who had murdered the girl's father. She tells him about her father's discovery: the Loc-Nar, an [[Artifact (fantasy)|artifact]] over which people are killing each other. Harry takes the girl back to his apartment where she climbs into his bed and has sex with him. The next day, one of his fares is Rudnick, who threatens Harry if he does not cooperate. The girl decides to sell the Loc-Nar to Rudnick and split the proceeds with Harry. At the exchange, Rudnick takes the Loc-Nar out of its case and is disintegrated. Meanwhile, the girl informs Harry that she is keeping all the money for herself and pulls a gun on him. Harry is forced to use his disintegrator on her. He keeps all the money and writes it up as a \"two-day ride with one hell of a tip\".\n\n;Cast\n{{div col}}\n* Percy Rodriguez (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n* [[Harvey Atkin]] as Alien, Henchman\n* [[John Candy]] as Desk Sergeant\n* [[Marilyn Lightstone]] as Whore\n* [[Susan Roman]] as Girl, Satellite\n* [[Richard Romanus]] as Harry Canyon\n* [[Al Waxman]] as Rudnick\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{div col}}\n;Crew\n* Pino Van Lamsweerde \u2013 director\n* W.

During a lightning experiment, the orb hurls the boy into the world of Neverwhere, where he transforms into a naked, bald-headed muscular man called [[Den (comics)|Den]], an acronym for his earth name, David Ellis Norman. After getting a nearby flag around him to keep anyone from seeing his \"dork\" hanging out, Den witnesses a strange ritual, rescuing a alluring young topless woman who was about to be sacrificed to [[Cthulhu|Uhluhtc]]. Reaching safety, she introduces herself as Katherine Wells from the British colony of Gibraltar. While she demonstrates her gratitude with sexual favours, they are interrupted by the minions of Ard, an immortal man who wants to obtain the Loc-Nar for himself. He orders Den to get the Loc-Nar from the Queen, who performed the ritual. Den agrees and infiltrates the palace, but is promptly caught by the Queen, who offers leniency if he has sex with her. He complies, thereby distracting the Queen while the raiding party steals the Loc-Nar. Den escapes and races back to rescue Katherine from Ard. Recreating the lightning incident that drew him to Neverwhere, he is able to banish Ard and the Queen. Den's voice-over has him suspecting that they were teleported to his mom's house and she will be surprised. Refusing the opportunity to take the Loc-Nar for himself, Den rides with Katherine into the sunset content to remain in Neverwhere. As for the Loc-Nar, it rises into the sky and lands on a space station where it is picked up by someone.\n\n;Cast\n* Percy Rodriguez (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n* John Candy as [[Den (comics)|Den]]\n* [[Jackie Burroughs]] as Katherine Wells\n* [[Martin Lavut]] as Ard\n* Marilyn Lightstone as Queen\n* [[August Schellenberg]] as Norl\n\n;Crew\n* [[Jack Stokes (director)|Jack Stokes]] \u2013 director\n* Jerry Hibbert \u2013 producer\n* [[Richard Corben]] \u2013 writer\n\n===Captain Sternn===\nOn a space station, crooked space captain [[Captain Sternn|Lincoln F. Sternn]] is on trial for numerous serious charges presented by the prosecutor consisting of 12 counts of murder on the first degree, 14 counts of armed theft of Federation property, 22 counts of piracy in high space, 18 counts of fraud, 37 counts of rape&nbsp;\u2014 and one moving violation. Pleading \"not guilty\" against the advice of his [[lawyer]] Charlie, Sternn explains that he expects to be acquitted because he bribed a witness named Hanover Fiste. Fiste takes the stand upon being called to by the prosecutor, but his perjury is subverted when the Loc-Nar, now the size of a marble, causes him to blurt out highly incriminating statements about Sternn (though whether or not any of them are true is unknown) before changing him into a hulking muscular form that chases Sternn throughout the station, breaking through bulkheads and wreaking havoc. Eventually, he corners Sternn, who gives him his promised payoff, and he promptly shrinks back to his gangly original form. Sternn opens a trap door under Fiste, ejecting him into space. The Loc-Nar enters Earth's atmosphere with Fiste's flaming severed hand still clinging to it.\n\n;Cast\n* Percy Rodriguez (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n* [[Rodger Bumpass]] as Hanover Fiste\n* [[Joe Flaherty]] as Charlie, the lawyer\n* [[Douglas Kenney]] as Regolian\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as [[Captain Sternn|Captain Lincoln F.

This original story was created by Cornelius Cole III.\n\nThe original rough animatics are set to a loop of the beginning of [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]\". The 1996 VHS release included this segment at the end of the tape. On the DVD release, this segment is included as a bonus feature. In both released versions, the sequence is set to the music of \"Passacaglia\" (from ''Magnificat''), composed and conducted by [[Krzysztof Penderecki]].\n\n===B-17===\nA [[World War II]] [[B-17 bomber]] nicknamed the ''Pacific Pearl'' makes a difficult bombing run with heavy damage and casualties. As the bomber limps home, the co-pilot goes back to check on the crew. Finding nothing but dead bodies, he notices the Loc-Nar trailing the plane. Informing the pilot, he heads back to the cockpit, when the Loc-Nar rams itself into the plane and reanimates the dead crew members as [[zombie]]s. The co-pilot is killed, while the pilot parachutes away in time. He lands on an island where he finds a graveyard of airplanes from various times, along with the wrecked airplanes' zombified airmen, who surround him, sealing the horrified pilot's fate.\n\n;Cast\n* Percy Rodriguez (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n* Don Francks as Co-Pilot (Holden)\n* [[George Touliatos]] as Pilot (Skip)\n* [[Zal Yanovsky]] as Navigator\n\n;Crew\n* Barrie Nelson \u2013 director\n* W.

At the meeting, the doctor tries to dismiss the occurrences. When he sees the Loc-Nar in the locket of Gloria, a beautiful buxom stenographer, he begins to behave erratically and sexually assaults her. A colossal starship drills through the roof and abducts the doctor and, by accident, Gloria. The ship's robot is irritated at Anrak, who is actually a malfunctioning [[Android (robot)|android]], but its mood changes when it sees Gloria. With the help of the ship's alien pilot Edsel and co-pilot Zeke, the robot convinces Gloria to stay on board and have [[Sex robot|\"robot sex\"]] (albeit off-screen). Meanwhile, Edsel and Zeke snort a huge amount of a powdered drug called Plutonian Nyborg before flying home, zoning out on the cosmos. Too intoxicated to fly straight, they crash-land unharmed in a huge space station.\n\n;Cast\n* Percy Rodriguez (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n* Rodger Bumpass as Dr. Anrak\n* John Candy as Robot\n* Joe Flaherty as General\n* Eugene Levy as Male Reporter / Edsel\n* [[Alice Playten]] as Gloria\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as Zeke\n* Patty Dworkin as Female Reporter\n* [[Warren Munson]] as Senator\n\n;Crew\n* [[John Halas]] \u2013 director\n* [[Angus McKie]] \u2013 writer\n\n;Music\n* \"I Must Be Dreamin'\" by Cheap Trick\n* \"Queen Bee\" by [[Grand Funk Railroad]]\n* \"Crazy?

The elders desperately try to summon the last of a warrior race, the Taarakians. Taarna, a strong, beautiful, and mute Taarakian warrior maiden, answers the call but was summoned too late to stop the massacre and resolves to avenge the city. Her search leads to the barbarians' stronghold, where she is captured, stripped of her clothing, tormented and left for dead. With the help of her Taarakian mount, she escapes, places her outfit back on, and confronts the barbarian leader. Though wounded, she defeats him. With Taarna readying her final attack, with her loyal and also injured mount, on the Loc-Nar it tells her not to sacrifice herself as she cannot destroy it. She does not relent and her self-sacrifice destroys the Loc-Nar.\n\n'''Cast'''\n* Percy Rodriguez (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n* [[Thor Bishopric]] as Boy\n* Ned Conlon as Councilman #1\n* Len Doncheff as Barbarian #1\n* Don Francks as Barbarian #2\n* Joseph Golland as Councilman #2\n* Charles Joliffe as Councilman #3\n* [[Mavor Moore]] as Elder\n* August Schellenberg as Taarak\n* [[Cedric Smith (actor)|Cedric Smith]] as Bartender\n* George Touliatos as Barbarian #3\n* [[Vlasta Vr\u00e1na]] as Barbarian Leader\n* Zal Yanovsky as Barbarian #4\n\n'''Music'''\n* \"[[The Mob Rules]]\" by [[Black Sabbath]]\n* \"[[Through Being Cool (Devo song)|Through Being Cool]]\" by [[Devo]]\n* \"[[Working in the Coal Mine]]\" by Devo\n* \"E5150\" by Black Sabbath\n\n===Epilogue===\nAs the final story ends, the Loc-Nar terrorizing the girl is similarly destroyed, blowing the mansion to pieces. Taarna's reborn mount appears outside and the girl happily flies away on it. It is then revealed that Taarna's soul has been reincarnated in the girl. The girl's hair color changes to that of Taarna and she reveals a Taarakian mark on her neck.\n\n'''Cast'''\n* Percy Rodriguez (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Animation===\nAnimator [[Robert Balser]] directed the animated \"Den\" sequence for the film.<ref name=awn>{{cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Wolfe|title=\u2018Yellow Submarine\u2019 Animation Director Robert Balser Passes at 88 |url=http://www.awn.com/news/yellow-submarine-animation-director-robert-balser-passes-88|work=[[Animation World Network]] |date=January 6, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe film uses the [[rotoscoping]] technique of animation in several shots.

It was not until 1996 that there was an official home video release on [[VHS]] when [[Kevin Eastman]], who had bought the publishing rights of ''Heavy Metal'' magazine in 1992 and previously contributed to the magazine, reached a settlement with the music copyright holders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/heavy-metal-soundtrack/|title=35 Years Ago: Sammy Hagar, Black Sabbath and More Appear on 'Heavy Metal' Soundtrack|last=Konow|first=David|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=May 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline        =\n| extra_column    = Artist\n| total_length    =\n| writing_credits =\n| title1          = Heavy Metal\n| note1           = Original Version\n| writer1         =\n| extra1          = [[Sammy Hagar]]\n| length1         = 3:50\n| title2          = Heartbeat\n| writer2         =\n| extra2          = [[Jerry Riggs|Riggs]]\n| length2         = 4:20\n| title3          = [[Working in the Coal Mine]]\n| writer3         =\n| extra3          = [[Devo]]\n| length3         = 2:48\n| title4          = [[Veteran of the Psychic Wars]]\n| writer4         =\n| extra4          = [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]\n| length4         = 4:48\n| title5          = [[Reach Out (Cheap Trick song)|Reach Out]]\n| writer5         =\n| extra5          = [[Cheap Trick]]\n| length5         = 3:35\n| title6          = [[Heavy Metal (Takin' a Ride)]]\n| writer6         =\n| extra6          = [[Don Felder]]\n| length6         = 5:00\n| title7          = True Companion\n| writer7         =\n| extra7          = [[Donald Fagen]]\n| length7         = 5:02\n| title8          = Crazy (A Suitable Case for Treatment)\n| writer8         =\n| extra8          = [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]]\n| length8         = 3:24\n| title9          = Radar Rider\n| writer9         =\n| extra9          = [[Jerry Riggs|Riggs]]\n| length9         = 2:40\n| title10          = [[Open Arms (Journey song)|Open Arms]]\n| writer10         =\n| extra10          = [[Journey (band)|Journey]]\n| length10         = 3:20\n| title11          = Queen Bee\n| writer11         =\n| extra11          = [[Grand Funk Railroad]]\n| length11         = 3:11\n| title12          = I Must Be Dreamin'\n| writer12         =\n| extra12          = [[Cheap Trick]]\n| length12         = 5:37\n| title13          = [[The Mob Rules]]\n| note13           = alternate version\n| writer13         =\n| extra13          = [[Black Sabbath]]\n| length13         = 3:16\n| title14          = All of You\n| writer14         =\n| extra14          = [[Don Felder]]\n| length14         = 4:18\n| title15          = Prefabricated\n| writer15         =\n| extra15          = [[Trust (French band)|Trust]]\n| length15         = 2:59\n| title16          = Blue Lamp\n| writer16         =\n| extra16          = [[Stevie Nicks]]\n| length16         = 3:48\n}}\n\n===Score===\nUnusual for the time, an [[Gramophone record|LP recording]] of [[Elmer Bernstein]]'s score was released alongside the soundtrack in 1981, and it featured the composer's first use of the [[ondes Martenot]], an instrument which became a trademark of Bernstein's later career.

[[Susan Roman]], [[Richard Romanus]], [[August Schellenberg]], [[John Vernon]], and [[Zal Yanovsky]]. The screenplay was written by Daniel Goldberg and [[Len Blum]].\n\nThe film is an [[Anthology film|anthology]] of various science fiction and fantasy stories adapted from ''Heavy Metal'' magazine and original stories in the same spirit. Like the magazine, the film features a great deal of [[graphic violence]], [[sexuality]], and [[nudity]]. Its production was expedited by having several [[animation company|animation houses]] working simultaneously on different segments.\n\nA sequel titled ''[[Heavy Metal 2000]]'' was released in 2000.\n\n==Plot==\n===Soft Landing===\nThe title sequence story opens with a [[space shuttle]] orbiting the Earth.

He says he has something to show her. When he opens his case, a green, crystalline sphere rises out and melts him. It introduces itself to the terrified girl as \"the sum of all evils\". Looking into the orb known as the Loc-Nar, the girl sees how it has influenced societies throughout time and space.\n\n;Cast\n* [[Percy Rodriguez]] (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n* [[Don Francks]] as Grimaldi\n* Caroline Semple as Girl\n\n;Crew\n* [[Harold Whitaker]] \u2013 director\n* [[John Halas]] \u2013 producer\n\n===Harry Canyon===\nOriginal story by [[Daniel Goldberg (producer)|Daniel Goldberg]] and [[Len Blum]]; inspired by [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]]' ''[[The Long Tomorrow (comics)|The Long Tomorrow]]'' stories.\n\nIn a dystopian [[New York City]] in 2031, cynical taxicab driver Harry Canyon narrates his day in film-noir style, grumbling about his fares and occasional robbery attempts, which he thwarts with a [[disintegrator ray|disintegrator]] installed in the back of his seat. He stumbles into an incident where he rescues a girl from a gangster named Rudnick, who had murdered the girl's father. She tells him about her father's discovery: the Loc-Nar, an [[Artifact (fantasy)|artifact]] over which people are killing each other. Harry takes the girl back to his apartment where she climbs into his bed and has sex with him. The next day, one of his fares is Rudnick, who threatens Harry if he does not cooperate. The girl decides to sell the Loc-Nar to Rudnick and split the proceeds with Harry. At the exchange, Rudnick takes the Loc-Nar out of its case and is disintegrated. Meanwhile, the girl informs Harry that she is keeping all the money for herself and pulls a gun on him. Harry is forced to use his disintegrator on her. He keeps all the money and writes it up as a \"two-day ride with one hell of a tip\".\n\n;Cast\n{{div col}}\n* Percy Rodriguez (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n* [[Harvey Atkin]] as Alien, Henchman\n* [[John Candy]] as Desk Sergeant\n* [[Marilyn Lightstone]] as Whore\n* [[Susan Roman]] as Girl, Satellite\n* [[Richard Romanus]] as Harry Canyon\n* [[Al Waxman]] as Rudnick\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{div col}}\n;Crew\n* Pino Van Lamsweerde \u2013 director\n* W.

During a lightning experiment, the orb hurls the boy into the world of Neverwhere, where he transforms into a naked, bald-headed muscular man called [[Den (comics)|Den]], an acronym for his earth name, David Ellis Norman. After getting a nearby flag around him to keep anyone from seeing his \"dork\" hanging out, Den witnesses a strange ritual, rescuing a alluring young topless woman who was about to be sacrificed to [[Cthulhu|Uhluhtc]]. Reaching safety, she introduces herself as Katherine Wells from the British colony of Gibraltar. While she demonstrates her gratitude with sexual favours, they are interrupted by the minions of Ard, an immortal man who wants to obtain the Loc-Nar for himself. He orders Den to get the Loc-Nar from the Queen, who performed the ritual. Den agrees and infiltrates the palace, but is promptly caught by the Queen, who offers leniency if he has sex with her. He complies, thereby distracting the Queen while the raiding party steals the Loc-Nar. Den escapes and races back to rescue Katherine from Ard. Recreating the lightning incident that drew him to Neverwhere, he is able to banish Ard and the Queen. Den's voice-over has him suspecting that they were teleported to his mom's house and she will be surprised. Refusing the opportunity to take the Loc-Nar for himself, Den rides with Katherine into the sunset content to remain in Neverwhere. As for the Loc-Nar, it rises into the sky and lands on a space station where it is picked up by someone.\n\n;Cast\n* Percy Rodriguez (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n* John Candy as [[Den (comics)|Den]]\n* [[Jackie Burroughs]] as Katherine Wells\n* [[Martin Lavut]] as Ard\n* Marilyn Lightstone as Queen\n* [[August Schellenberg]] as Norl\n\n;Crew\n* [[Jack Stokes (director)|Jack Stokes]] \u2013 director\n* Jerry Hibbert \u2013 producer\n* [[Richard Corben]] \u2013 writer\n\n===Captain Sternn===\nOn a space station, crooked space captain [[Captain Sternn|Lincoln F. Sternn]] is on trial for numerous serious charges presented by the prosecutor consisting of 12 counts of murder on the first degree, 14 counts of armed theft of Federation property, 22 counts of piracy in high space, 18 counts of fraud, 37 counts of rape&nbsp;\u2014 and one moving violation. Pleading \"not guilty\" against the advice of his [[lawyer]] Charlie, Sternn explains that he expects to be acquitted because he bribed a witness named Hanover Fiste. Fiste takes the stand upon being called to by the prosecutor, but his perjury is subverted when the Loc-Nar, now the size of a marble, causes him to blurt out highly incriminating statements about Sternn (though whether or not any of them are true is unknown) before changing him into a hulking muscular form that chases Sternn throughout the station, breaking through bulkheads and wreaking havoc. Eventually, he corners Sternn, who gives him his promised payoff, and he promptly shrinks back to his gangly original form. Sternn opens a trap door under Fiste, ejecting him into space. The Loc-Nar enters Earth's atmosphere with Fiste's flaming severed hand still clinging to it.\n\n;Cast\n* Percy Rodriguez (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n* [[Rodger Bumpass]] as Hanover Fiste\n* [[Joe Flaherty]] as Charlie, the lawyer\n* [[Douglas Kenney]] as Regolian\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as [[Captain Sternn|Captain Lincoln F.

This original story was created by Cornelius Cole III.\n\nThe original rough animatics are set to a loop of the beginning of [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]\". The 1996 VHS release included this segment at the end of the tape. On the DVD release, this segment is included as a bonus feature. In both released versions, the sequence is set to the music of \"Passacaglia\" (from ''Magnificat''), composed and conducted by [[Krzysztof Penderecki]].\n\n===B-17===\nA [[World War II]] [[B-17 bomber]] nicknamed the ''Pacific Pearl'' makes a difficult bombing run with heavy damage and casualties. As the bomber limps home, the co-pilot goes back to check on the crew. Finding nothing but dead bodies, he notices the Loc-Nar trailing the plane. Informing the pilot, he heads back to the cockpit, when the Loc-Nar rams itself into the plane and reanimates the dead crew members as [[zombie]]s. The co-pilot is killed, while the pilot parachutes away in time.

At the meeting, the doctor tries to dismiss the occurrences. When he sees the Loc-Nar in the locket of Gloria, a beautiful buxom stenographer, he begins to behave erratically and sexually assaults her. A colossal starship drills through the roof and abducts the doctor and, by accident, Gloria. The ship's robot is irritated at Anrak, who is actually a malfunctioning [[Android (robot)|android]], but its mood changes when it sees Gloria. With the help of the ship's alien pilot Edsel and co-pilot Zeke, the robot convinces Gloria to stay on board and have [[Sex robot|\"robot sex\"]] (albeit off-screen). Meanwhile, Edsel and Zeke snort a huge amount of a powdered drug called Plutonian Nyborg before flying home, zoning out on the cosmos. Too intoxicated to fly straight, they crash-land unharmed in a huge space station.\n\n;Cast\n* Percy Rodriguez (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n* Rodger Bumpass as Dr. Anrak\n* John Candy as Robot\n* Joe Flaherty as General\n* Eugene Levy as Male Reporter / Edsel\n* [[Alice Playten]] as Gloria\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as Zeke\n* Patty Dworkin as Female Reporter\n* [[Warren Munson]] as Senator\n\n;Crew\n* [[John Halas]] \u2013 director\n* [[Angus McKie]] \u2013 writer\n\n;Music\n* \"I Must Be Dreamin'\" by Cheap Trick\n* \"Queen Bee\" by [[Grand Funk Railroad]]\n* \"Crazy?

The elders desperately try to summon the last of a warrior race, the Taarakians. Taarna, a strong, beautiful, and mute Taarakian warrior maiden, answers the call but was summoned too late to stop the massacre and resolves to avenge the city. Her search leads to the barbarians' stronghold, where she is captured, stripped of her clothing, tormented and left for dead. With the help of her Taarakian mount, she escapes, places her outfit back on, and confronts the barbarian leader. Though wounded, she defeats him. With Taarna readying her final attack, with her loyal and also injured mount, on the Loc-Nar it tells her not to sacrifice herself as she cannot destroy it. She does not relent and her self-sacrifice destroys the Loc-Nar.\n\n'''Cast'''\n* Percy Rodriguez (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n* [[Thor Bishopric]] as Boy\n* Ned Conlon as Councilman #1\n* Len Doncheff as Barbarian #1\n* Don Francks as Barbarian #2\n* Joseph Golland as Councilman #2\n* Charles Joliffe as Councilman #3\n* [[Mavor Moore]] as Elder\n* August Schellenberg as Taarak\n* [[Cedric Smith (actor)|Cedric Smith]] as Bartender\n* George Touliatos as Barbarian #3\n* [[Vlasta Vr\u00e1na]] as Barbarian Leader\n* Zal Yanovsky as Barbarian #4\n\n'''Music'''\n* \"[[The Mob Rules]]\" by [[Black Sabbath]]\n* \"[[Through Being Cool (Devo song)|Through Being Cool]]\" by [[Devo]]\n* \"[[Working in the Coal Mine]]\" by Devo\n* \"E5150\" by Black Sabbath\n\n===Epilogue===\nAs the final story ends, the Loc-Nar terrorizing the girl is similarly destroyed, blowing the mansion to pieces. Taarna's reborn mount appears outside and the girl happily flies away on it. It is then revealed that Taarna's soul has been reincarnated in the girl. The girl's hair color changes to that of Taarna and she reveals a Taarakian mark on her neck.\n\n'''Cast'''\n* Percy Rodriguez (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Animation===\nAnimator [[Robert Balser]] directed the animated \"Den\" sequence for the film.<ref name=awn>{{cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Wolfe|title=\u2018Yellow Submarine\u2019 Animation Director Robert Balser Passes at 88 |url=http://www.awn.com/news/yellow-submarine-animation-director-robert-balser-passes-88|work=[[Animation World Network]] |date=January 6, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe film uses the [[rotoscoping]] technique of animation in several shots.

It is also the seat of the judicial district that covers the localities of [[Moral de Calatrava]], [[Santa Cruz de Mudela]], [[Viso del Marqu\u00e9s]], [[Torrenueva]], [[Castellar de Santiago]] and [[Almuradiel]].\n\n== Geography ==\nIts name means \"Valley of Rocks\", because it is located in a wide hilly area surrounded by a meander of the Jabal\u00f3n River, just bordering on the plain south of La Mancha, and the subsoil is rich in limestone rock. It is located in the Campo de Calatrava, an extensive plain north of the [[Sierra Morena]], and lies on the left bank of [[Jabal\u00f3n River]], a tributary of the [[Guadiana]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Valdepe\u00f1as|volume=27|page=843}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] ''(pedan\u00eda)'' of [[Consolaci\u00f3n]] is a dependency of Valdepe\u00f1as and is located at the intersection between [[Autov\u00eda A-4]] (Autovia del Sur) and road [[CR-5214]]. It was built by the [[Instituto Nacional de Colonizaci\u00f3n]] in 1949.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nThe municipal area houses numerous prehistoric remains, platforms and watchtowers located in the hills, compatible with settlers of the [[Bronze Age]] called  [[Motillas|Culture of the Motillas]], dated between the 10th and 13th centuries BC. Vasco Merlo in his ''History of Valdepe\u00f1as'' <ref>Fernando Vasco Merlo, ''Historia de Valdepe\u00f1as''.</ref> described these structures erroneously as [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] settlements, despite their being much older than that and possibly belonging to the [[Culture of Argar]].\n\n=== Ancient history ===\n[[File:Cerro Cabezas.png|thumb|left|160px|Archaeological iberian ensemble of ''Cerro Cabezas'' in Valdepe\u00f1as.]]\nEight kilometres to the south of the city is located the [[Iberians|Iberian]] city of \"Cerro de las Cabezas\" (Hill of the Heads), a great ''[[oppidum]]'' or town fortified with a true castle in the summit of the hill that it occupies, inhabited between the 7th and 2nd centuries BC.  It is an important archaeological deposit of the Oretana Culture and shows signs of the first vestige of the [[grapevine]] in this region.\n\nIn the 16th century and later artefacts such as graves, coins and other [[ancient Roman]] items, from a Roman villa of the 1st century BC, that still existed in the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] period.\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nDuring the Middle Ages period the area was part of the Moorish [[taifa of Toledo]]. The Arab inscriptions and a sun dial on the walls of the Church of the Assumption date from this period. According to oral tradition, the Caliphate gave permission to the inhabitants  to cultivate vineyards and make wine, which is prohibited by the [[Quran]]. \nThe Moors were expelled from Valdepenas at the end of the 15th century.\n[[File:Valdepe\u00f1as. Ermita de la Veracruz.JPG|thumb|200px|Veracruz Hermitage]]\n\nBy order of Queen [[Berenguela of Castile]] and after the [[battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] in 1212, settlers of several villages (Aberturas, Corral Rubio de Jabal\u00f3n, Santa Mar\u00eda de las Flores and Castilnuevo) moved to the area around the present Church of the Assumption, which had been an old castle.\nFrom that moment Valdepe\u00f1as belonged to the military [[Order of Calatrava]] and the first text it is mentioned in is the record of The Order of Calatrava in 1243.  The new settlers came from the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] ([[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] mainly) and [[Arag\u00f3n]].  The Order demanded conditions of establishment and right of citizenship, the continued care of the grapevine.\n\nIn medieval times the [[jews|Jewish]] community became important and this is reflected in the existence at least two [[synagogue]]s, one of which was eventually converted into the hermitage of Veracruz and the old building where the Parish of The Christ was located, behind its present location.\n\n===Early modern age===\n[[File:Convento de los Padres Trinitarios S. XVI. Valdepe\u00f1as.jpg|thumb|200px|Trinitarians Convent (16th century).]]\n\nThe [[Catholic Monarchs]], Ferdinand and [[Isabella of Castille]], lodged in Valdepe\u00f1as on 18 February 1488 at the mother of Alfonso de Merlo's house, and left to the care of the widow the infants during part of the conquest of Granada.\nThe same Alfonso de Merlo was named Captain and went with more than two hundred men to the Conquest of Granada, funding the campaign with his own money. The Catholic Monarchs recognized and granted him the title of Knight. Some of his descendants moved to the New World and took important positions in Peru and Chile.<ref>Fernando Vasco Merlo, ''Historia de Valdepe\u00f1as'', and also in \n[http://www.ehumanista.ucsb.edu/volumes/volume_07/index.shtml \"El Memorial de Don Alonso Merlo de la Fuente\" (Noviembre, 1650)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206174351/http://www.ehumanista.ucsb.edu/volumes/volume_07/index.shtml |date=2008-12-06 }}.  Work of Arturo Gir\u00e1ldez (print in \u201ce Humanista Volume 07, 2006\u201d). University of the Pacific. About manuscript  held in the  [[British Library]].</ref>\n\nCurrently diverse religious and civil buildings from the 16th century such as the Trinitarians Covent can be found in the town.\n\nKing [[Ferdinand the Catholic]] wanted to control the power of Military Orders, and [[Pope Adrian VI]] granted orders to the Kingdom of Castile,  passing to Royal Jurisdiction an important patrimony: two cities, two hundred villas (Valdepe\u00f1as among them) and a hundred of villages, distributed in an ample territory.\n \nKing [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] sold the villa on 22 April 1575 to D. [[Alvaro de Baz\u00e1n]] first Marquess of '''Santa Cruz''', who became '''Lord of Valdepe\u00f1as'''. Valdepe\u00f1as would happen to be a \"Se\u00f1or\u00edo\", secreting itself of the Order of Calatrava.\n\nThe successive marquesses promoted the wines of Valdepe\u00f1as in the ''Spanish Court of the Austrian'' and its fame consequently extended all over the country.  Valdepe\u00f1as' \"clarete\" became known as \"aloque\" at this time.\n\n=== Contemporary history ===\n[[File:Estatua La Galana.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Juana Gal\u00e1n|La Galana]].]]\n\nValdepe\u00f1as led a quiet existence until 6 June 1808, when Napoleon's occupation of Spain became an issue after the events of 2 May in Madrid of that year.\nNapoleon's troops went to Andalusia as reinforcements and attempted to cross the villa; the entire population (men, women and also some of the neighbouring villas) took up arms to prevent the passage of the troops. The result was a high number of lives lost and a major fire. Highlighted in the fight was a woman, [[Juana Gal\u00e1n]] \"La Galana\". The outcome was that the troops had to retreat from the province of [[La Mancha]], a delay which led, at least in part, to the Spanish victory at the [[Battle of Bailen]]. King Fernando VII would give the villa the Title of \"Very Heroic\".  After these events some inhabitants from Valdepe\u00f1as took part of the [[guerrilla|guerrilla fighting]] against the Napoleonic troops in the \"Guerra de la Independencia\", [[Francisco Abad Moreno \"Chaleco\"|Francisco Abad, \"Chaleco\"]], became a famous guerrillero.  \n[[File:Plaza de Espa\u00f1a Valdepe\u00f1as.jpg|thumb|200px|Spain Square.]]\n[[File:Valdepe\u00f1as.Fiestas.2007.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Valdepe\u00f1as festival, 2007.]]\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the appearance of [[Phylloxera]] led to the introduction of the resistant American vine but did not change the economy much.  The Spanish Civil War broke this development, and the city's population decreased. From the 1940s to the 1970s the only economical activities were agriculture and the traditional family industry of wine, a common phenomenon of central Spain in these times.  In the 1980s, Valdepe\u00f1as saw a modernization of the wine sector, including new kinds of grapes, and the introduction of techniques in wine production.\n\n== Culture ==\nValdepe\u00f1as has several museums of history, art and wine. \nThere are two Fairs, in August \"the summer fair\" at the first week and in September known as \"Fiesta de la Vendimia\" (Grape Harvest Fair).\n[[File:Learn Spanish in Spain - Valdepe\u00f1as (Ruta \u00d1).jpg|thumb|Valdepe\u00f1as is member of the cultural programme Ruta \u00d1 to promote the Spanish language and culture.

It is also the seat of the judicial district that covers the localities of [[Moral de Calatrava]], [[Santa Cruz de Mudela]], [[Viso del Marqu\u00e9s]], [[Torrenueva]], [[Castellar de Santiago]] and [[Almuradiel]].\n\n== Geography ==\nIts name means \"Valley of Rocks\", because it is located in a wide hilly area surrounded by a meander of the Jabal\u00f3n River, just bordering on the plain south of La Mancha, and the subsoil is rich in limestone rock. It is located in the Campo de Calatrava, an extensive plain north of the [[Sierra Morena]], and lies on the left bank of [[Jabal\u00f3n River]], a tributary of the [[Guadiana]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Valdepe\u00f1as|volume=27|page=843}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] ''(pedan\u00eda)'' of [[Consolaci\u00f3n]] is a dependency of Valdepe\u00f1as and is located at the intersection between [[Autov\u00eda A-4]] (Autovia del Sur) and road [[CR-5214]]. It was built by the [[Instituto Nacional de Colonizaci\u00f3n]] in 1949.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nThe municipal area houses numerous prehistoric remains, platforms and watchtowers located in the hills, compatible with settlers of the [[Bronze age]] called  [[Motillas|Culture of the Motillas]], dated between the 10th and 13th centuries BC. Vasco Merlo in his ''History of Valdepe\u00f1as'' <ref>Fernando Vasco Merlo, ''Historia de Valdepe\u00f1as''.</ref> described these structures erroneously as [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] settlements, despite their being much older than that and possibly belonging to the [[Culture of Argar]].\n\n=== Ancient history ===\n[[File:Cerro Cabezas.png|thumb|left|160px|Archaeological iberian ensemble of ''Cerro Cabezas'' in Valdepe\u00f1as.]]\nEight kilometres to the south of the city is located the [[Iberians|Iberian]] city of \"Cerro de las Cabezas\" (Hill of the Heads), a great ''[[oppidum]]'' or town fortified with a true castle in the summit of the hill that it occupies, inhabited between the 7th and 2nd centuries BC.  It is an important archaeological deposit of the Oretana Culture and shows signs of the first vestige of the [[grapevine]] in this region.\n\nIn the 16th century and later artefacts such as graves, coins and other [[ancient Roman]] items, from a Roman villa of the 1st century BC, that still existed in the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] period.\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nDuring the Middle Ages period the area was part of the Moorish [[taifa of Toledo]]. The Arab inscriptions and a sun dial on the walls of the Church of the Assumption date from this period. According to oral tradition, the Caliphate gave permission to the inhabitants  to cultivate vineyards and make wine, which is prohibited by the [[Quran]]. \nThe Moors were expelled from Valdepenas at the end of the 15th century.\n[[File:Valdepe\u00f1as. Ermita de la Veracruz.JPG|thumb|200px|Veracruz Hermitage]]\n\nBy order of Queen [[Berenguela of Castile]] and after the [[battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] in 1212, settlers of several villages (Aberturas, Corral Rubio de Jabal\u00f3n, Santa Mar\u00eda de las Flores and Castilnuevo) moved to the area around the present Church of the Assumption, which had been an old castle.\nFrom that moment Valdepe\u00f1as belonged to the military [[Order of Calatrava]] and the first text it is mentioned in is the record of The Order of Calatrava in 1243.  The new settlers came from the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] ([[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] mainly) and [[Arag\u00f3n]].  The Order demanded conditions of establishment and right of citizenship, the continued care of the grapevine.\n\nIn medieval times the [[jews|Jewish]] community became important and this is reflected in the existence at least two [[synagogue]]s, one of which was eventually converted into the hermitage of Veracruz and the old building where the Parish of The Christ was located, behind its present location.\n\n===Early modern age===\n[[File:Convento de los Padres Trinitarios S. XVI. Valdepe\u00f1as.jpg|thumb|200px|Trinitarians Convent (16th century).]]\n\nThe [[Catholic Monarchs]], Ferdinand and [[Isabella of Castille]], lodged in Valdepe\u00f1as on 18 February 1488 at the mother of Alfonso de Merlo's house, and left to the care of the widow the infants during part of the conquest of Granada.\nThe same Alfonso de Merlo was named Captain and went with more than two hundred men to the Conquest of Granada, funding the campaign with his own money. The Catholic Monarchs recognized and granted him the title of Knight. Some of his descendants moved to the New World and took important positions in Peru and Chile.<ref>Fernando Vasco Merlo, ''Historia de Valdepe\u00f1as'', and also in \n[http://www.ehumanista.ucsb.edu/volumes/volume_07/index.shtml \"El Memorial de Don Alonso Merlo de la Fuente\" (Noviembre, 1650)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206174351/http://www.ehumanista.ucsb.edu/volumes/volume_07/index.shtml |date=2008-12-06 }}.

[[Alvaro de Baz\u00e1n]] first Marquess of '''Santa Cruz''', who became '''Lord of Valdepe\u00f1as'''. Valdepe\u00f1as would happen to be a \"Se\u00f1or\u00edo\", secreting itself of the Order of Calatrava.\n\nThe successive marquesses promoted the wines of Valdepe\u00f1as in the ''Spanish Court of the Austrian'' and its fame consequently extended all over the country.  Valdepe\u00f1as' \"clarete\" became known as \"aloque\" at this time.\n\n=== Contemporary history ===\n[[File:Estatua La Galana.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Juana Gal\u00e1n|La Galana]].]]\n\nValdepe\u00f1as led a quiet existence until 6 June 1808, when Napoleon's occupation of Spain became an issue after the events of 2 May in Madrid of that year.\nNapoleon's troops went to Andalusia as reinforcements and attempted to cross the villa; the entire population (men, women and also some of the neighbouring villas) took up arms to prevent the passage of the troops. The result was a high number of lives lost and a major fire. Highlighted in the fight was a woman, [[Juana Gal\u00e1n]] \"La Galana\". The outcome was that the troops had to retreat from the province of [[La Mancha]], a delay which led, at least in part, to the Spanish victory at the [[Battle of Bailen]]. King Fernando VII would give the villa the Title of \"Very Heroic\".  After these events some inhabitants from Valdepe\u00f1as took part of the [[guerrilla|guerrilla fighting]] against the Napoleonic troops in the \"Guerra de la Independencia\", [[Francisco Abad Moreno \"Chaleco\"|Francisco Abad, \"Chaleco\"]], became a famous guerrillero.  \n[[File:Plaza de Espa\u00f1a Valdepe\u00f1as.jpg|thumb|200px|Spain Square.]]\n[[File:Valdepe\u00f1as.Fiestas.2007.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Valdepe\u00f1as festival, 2007.]]\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the appearance of [[Phylloxera]] led to the introduction of the resistant American vine but did not change the economy much.  The Spanish Civil War broke this development, and the city's population decreased. From the 1940s to the 1970s the only economical activities were agriculture and the traditional family industry of wine, a common phenomenon of central Spain in these times.

The Romans were commanded by [[Gaius Marius]], the Numidians by an unknown commander. The Romans main objective was to capture one of king [[Jugurtha]]'s treasuries which was reported to be inside the fortress. Marius besieged the fortress town and finally took it by trickery.<ref>Marc Hyden, ''Gaius Marius'', pp 82\u201384.</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Jugurthine war Numidia-en.svg|thumb|300px|[[Numidia]] between 112 and 105 B.C. and main battles of the war.]]\nKing [[Masinissa]] of Numidia, who was a steadfast ally of Rome, died in 149, he was succeeded by his son [[Micipsa]], who ruled from 149 to 118 BC. At the time of his death Micipsa had three potential heirs, his two sons, [[Adherbal (king of Numidia)|Adherbal]] and [[Hiempsal I|Hiempsal]], and an illegitimate nephew, [[Jugurtha]]. Jugurtha had fought under [[Scipio Aemilianus]] at the [[siege of Numantia]], where he had formed a friendship with Roman aristocrats and learned about Roman society and military tactics. Micipsa, worried that after his death Jugurtha would usurp the kingdom from his own somewhat less able sons, adopted him, and bequeathed the kingship jointly to his two sons and Jugurtha. After Micipsa's death the three kings fell out, and ultimately agreed between themselves to divide their inheritance into three separate kingdoms. When they were unable to agree on the terms of the division Jugurtha declared open war on his cousins. Hiempsal, the younger and braver of the brothers, was assassinated by Jugurtha's agents. Jugurtha gathered an army and marched against Adherbal, who fled to Rome. There he appealed to the [[Roman Senate]] for arbitration.\n\nAlthough the Senate were securities for Micipsa's will, they now allowed themselves to be bribed by Jugurtha into overlooking his crimes, and organized a commission, led by the ex-[[Consul]] [[Lucius Opimius]], to fairly divide Numidia between the remaining contestants in 116 BC. Jugurtha bribed the Roman officials in the commission and was alloted the more fertile and populous western half of Numidia, while Adherbal received the east. Powerless Adherbal accepted and peace was made. Shortly after, in 113 BC, Jugurtha again declared war on his brother, and defeated him, forcing him to retreat into [[Cirta]], Adherbal's capital. Adherbal held out for some months, aided by a large number of Romans and Italians who had settled in Africa for commercial purposes. From inside his siege lines, Adherbal appealed again to Rome, and the Senate dispatched a message to Jugurtha to desist. The latter ignored the demand, and the Senate sent a second commission, this time headed by [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Marcus Scaurus]], a respected member of the aristocracy, to threaten the Numidian king into submission. The king, pretending to be open to discussion, protracted negotiations with Scaurus long enough for Cirta to run out of provisions and hope of relief. When Scaurus left without having forced Jugurtha to a commitment, Adherbal surrendered. Jugurtha promptly had him executed, along with the Romans who had joined in the defence of Cirta. But the deaths of Roman citizens caused an immediate furore among the commoners at home, and the Senate, threatened by the popular tribune [[Gaius Memmius (tribune)|Gaius Memmius]], finally declared war on Jugurtha in 111 BC.\n\nIn 111 BC, the consul [[Lucius Calpurnius Bestia (consul 111 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Bestia]] commanded a Roman army against Jugurtha, but he allowed himself to be bribed. The following year the consul [[Spurius Postumius Albinus (consul 110 BC)|Spurius Postumius Albinus]] succeeded the command against the Numidian king, but he let himself be bribed too. Spurius's brother, [[Aulus Postumius Albinus Magnus|Aulus Postumius Albinus]], allowed Jugurtha to lure him into the desolate wilds of the [[Sahara]], where the cunning Numidian king, who had reportedly bribed Roman officers to facilitate his attack, was able to catch the Romans at a disadvantage. Half the Roman army were killed, and the survivors were forced to pass under the yoke in a disgraceful symbolism of surrender. The [[Roman Senate]], however, when it heard of this capitulation, refused to honour the conditions and continued the war.\n\nAfter Postumius' defeat, the Senate finally shook itself from its lethargy, appointing as commander in Africa the plebeian noble [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], who had a reputation for integrity and courage. Metellus proved the soundness of his judgement by selecting as officers for the campaign men of ability rather than of rank, men like [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Publius Rutilius Rufus]]. Metellus arrived in Africa as consul in 109 BC and dedicated the remainder of the year to a serious disciplinary reform of his demoralised forces.\nIn spring of 108, Metellus led his reorganised army into Numidia; Jugurtha was alarmed and attempted negotiation, but Metellus prevaricated; and, without granting Jugurtha terms, he conspired with Jugurtha's envoys to capture Jugurtha and deliver him to the Romans. The crafty Jugurtha, guessing Metellus' intentions, broke up negotiation and retreated. Metellus followed and crossed the mountains into the desert, advancing to the river Muthul where the Numidians ambushed them. Through the capable leadership of Metellus, Marius and Rutilius Rufus the Romans won an indecisive victory at the [[Battle of the Muthul]]. Later that year Metellus surprised Jugurtha by capturing the treasury fortresses at [[Siege of Thala|Thala]]. \n\nThe following year (107 BC), one of the new consuls, Gaius Marius, took over command of the war against Jugurtha. Marius marched west plundering the Numidian countryside, seizing minor Numidian towns and fortresses trying to provoke Jugurtha into a set-piece battle, but the Numidian king refused to engage. Marius destroyed the Numidian city of Capsa; after which town after town fell, most without military action. By the beginning of 106 BC, Marius had carved a path of destruction through the Numidian heartland, and subdued most of Jugurtha's kingdom in the process. He now reached one of Jugurtha's primary treasuries, which was kept in a fortress town near the River Muluccha.<ref>Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, pp 78\u201382.</ref>\n\n==The Siege==\nMarius was determined to capture the town and its treasury, but because of the landscape and the location of fortress he was unable to employ the necessary siege engines. Several attempts at storming the fortress ended in failure.<ref>Marc Hyden, ''Gaius Marius'', pp 82\u201383.</ref>\n\nBy chance, a [[Liguria|Ligurian]] [[Auxiliary (Roman military)|auxiliary]] had gone in search of water at the base of the elevated town's rear. Apparently, he was in the mood for snails and went climbing to look for them. As he sought his dinner he found a way onto the plateau and into the town. He returned to the camp and reported what he had discovered. Marius assigned five horn players and four centurions to accompany the Ligurian and infiltrate the town. The Romans created a diversion to draw the defenders attention to the front of the town so the infiltration party could enter via the rear. When the infiltration party was in place Marius ordered a full assault on the town. He sent a [[Testudo formation|testudo]] towards the gate. While the Numidian were defending against Marius' offensive they suddenly heard horns coming from inside the town. The horns caused confusion and panic<ref>the defenders probably assumed the Romans had breached their defences at the rear while they were occupied fighting the frontal assault</ref>, the Romans took advantage of the situation, storming the walls and sacking the settlement.<ref>Marc Hyden, ''Gaius Marius'', pp 83\u201384.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nJugurtha continued his war against Rome for two more years. Unfortunately for Jugurtha, Marius and his subordinate [[Sulla]] were able to convince king Bocchus, Jugurtha's ally and father-in-law, it was in his best interest to abandon his son-in-law. Bocchus conspired with Sulla, who had traveled to Mauretania on a special mission to capture Jugurtha.

The Romans were commanded by [[Gaius Marius]], the Numidians by an unknown commander. The Romans main objective was to capture one of king [[Jugurtha]]'s treasuries which was reported to be inside the fortress. Marius besieged the fortress town and finally took it by trickery.<ref>Marc Hyden, ''Gaius Marius'', pp 82\u201384.</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Jugurthine war Numidia-en.svg|thumb|300px|[[Numidia]] between 112 and 105 B.C. and main battles of the war.]]\nKing [[Masinissa]] of Numidia, who was a steadfast ally of Rome, died in 149, he was succeeded by his son [[Micipsa]], who ruled from 149 to 118 BC. At the time of his death Micipsa had three potential heirs, his two sons, [[Adherbal (king of Numidia)|Adherbal]] and [[Hiempsal I|Hiempsal]], and an illegitimate nephew, [[Jugurtha]]. Jugurtha had fought under [[Scipio Aemilianus]] at the [[siege of Numantia]], where he had formed a friendship with Roman aristocrats and learned about Roman society and military tactics. Micipsa, worried that after his death Jugurtha would usurp the kingdom from his own somewhat less able sons, adopted him, and bequeathed the kingship jointly to his two sons and Jugurtha. After Micipsa's death the three kings fell out, and ultimately agreed between themselves to divide their inheritance into three separate kingdoms. When they were unable to agree on the terms of the division Jugurtha declared open war on his cousins. Hiempsal, the younger and braver of the brothers, was assassinated by Jugurtha's agents. Jugurtha gathered an army and marched against Adherbal, who fled to Rome. There he appealed to the [[Roman Senate]] for arbitration.\n\nAlthough the Senate were securities for Micipsa's will, they now allowed themselves to be bribed by Jugurtha into overlooking his crimes, and organized a commission, led by the ex-[[Consul]] [[Lucius Opimius]], to fairly divide Numidia between the remaining contestants in 116 BC. Jugurtha bribed the Roman officials in the commission and was alloted the more fertile and populous western half of Numidia, while Adherbal received the east. Powerless Adherbal accepted and peace was made. Shortly after, in 113 BC, Jugurtha again declared war on his brother, and defeated him, forcing him to retreat into [[Cirta]], Adherbal's capital. Adherbal held out for some months, aided by a large number of Romans and Italians who had settled in Africa for commercial purposes. From inside his siege lines, Adherbal appealed again to Rome, and the Senate dispatched a message to Jugurtha to desist. The latter ignored the demand, and the Senate sent a second commission, this time headed by [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Marcus Scaurus]], a respected member of the aristocracy, to threaten the Numidian king into submission. The king, pretending to be open to discussion, protracted negotiations with Scaurus long enough for Cirta to run out of provisions and hope of relief. When Scaurus left without having forced Jugurtha to a commitment, Adherbal surrendered. Jugurtha promptly had him executed, along with the Romans who had joined in the defence of Cirta. But the deaths of Roman citizens caused an immediate furore among the commoners at home, and the Senate, threatened by the popular tribune [[Gaius Memmius (tribune)|Gaius Memmius]], finally declared war on Jugurtha in 111 BC.\n\nIn 111 BC, the consul [[Lucius Calpurnius Bestia (consul 111 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Bestia]] commanded a Roman army against Jugurtha, but he allowed himself to be bribed. The following year the consul [[Spurius Postumius Albinus (consul 110 BC)|Spurius Postumius Albinus]] succeeded the command against the Numidian king, but he let himself be bribed too. Spurius's brother, [[Aulus Postumius Albinus Magnus|Aulus Postumius Albinus]], allowed Jugurtha to lure him into the desolate wilds of the [[Sahara]], where the cunning Numidian king, who had reportedly bribed Roman officers to facilitate his attack, was able to catch the Romans at a disadvantage. Half the Roman army were killed, and the survivors were forced to pass under the yoke in a disgraceful symbolism of surrender. The [[Roman Senate]], however, when it heard of this capitulation, refused to honour the conditions and continued the war.\n\nAfter Postumius' defeat, the Senate finally shook itself from its lethargy, appointing as commander in Africa the plebeian noble [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], who had a reputation for integrity and courage. Metellus proved the soundness of his judgement by selecting as officers for the campaign men of ability rather than of rank, men like [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Publius Rutilius Rufus]]. Metellus arrived in Africa as consul in 109 BC and dedicated the remainder of the year to a serious disciplinary reform of his demoralised forces.\nIn spring of 108, Metellus led his reorganised army into Numidia; Jugurtha was alarmed and attempted negotiation, but Metellus prevaricated; and, without granting Jugurtha terms, he conspired with Jugurtha's envoys to capture Jugurtha and deliver him to the Romans. The crafty Jugurtha, guessing Metellus' intentions, broke up negotiation and retreated. Metellus followed and crossed the mountains into the desert, advancing to the river Muthul where the Numidians ambushed them. Through the capable leadership of Metellus, Marius and Rutilius Rufus the Romans won an indecisive victory at the [[Battle of the Muthul]]. Later that year Metellus surprised Jugurtha by capturing the treasury fortresses at [[Siege of Thala|Thala]]. \n\nThe following year (107 BC), one of the new consuls, Gaius Marius, took over command of the war against Jugurtha. Marius marched west plundering the Numidian countryside, seizing minor Numidian towns and fortresses trying to provoke Jugurtha into a set-piece battle, but the Numidian king refused to engage. Marius destroyed the Numidian city of Capsa; after which town after town fell, most without military action. By the beginning of 106 BC, Marius had carved a path of destruction through the Numidian heartland, and subdued most of Jugurtha's kingdom in the process. He now reached one of Jugurtha's primary treasuries, which was kept in a fortress town near the River Muluccha.<ref>Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, pp 78\u201382.</ref>\n\n==The Siege==\nMarius was determined to capture the town and its treasury, but because of the landscape and the location of fortress he was unable to employ the necessary siege engines. Several attempts at storming the fortress ended in failure.<ref>Marc Hyden, ''Gaius Marius'', pp 82\u201383.</ref>\n\nBy chance, a [[Liguria|Ligurian]] [[Auxiliary (Roman military)|auxiliary]] had gone in search of water at the base of the elevated town's rear. Apparantly, he was in the mood for snails and went climbing to look for them. As he sought his dinner he found a way onto the plateau and into the town. He returned to the camp and reported what he had discovered. Marius assigned five horn players and four centurions to accompany the Ligurian and infiltrate the town. The Romans created a diversion to draw the defenders attention to the front of the town so the infiltration party could enter via the rear. When the infiltration party was in place Marius ordered a full assault on the town. He sent a [[Testudo formation|testudo]] towards the gate. While the Numidian were defending against Marius' offensive they suddenly heard horns coming from inside the town. The horns caused confusion and panic<ref>the defenders probably assumed the Romans had breached their defences at the rear while they were occupied fighting the frontal assault</ref>, the Romans took advantage of the situation, storming the walls and sacking the settlement.<ref>Marc Hyden, ''Gaius Marius'', pp 83\u201384.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nJugurtha continued his war against Rome for two more years. Unfortunately for Jugurtha, Marius and his subordinate [[Sulla]] were able to convince king Bocchus, Jugurtha's ally and father-in-law, it was in his best interest to abandon his son-in-law. Bocchus conspired with Sulla, who had traveled to Mauretania on a special mission to capture Jugurtha. It was a dangerous operation from the beginning, with King Bocchus weighing up the advantages of handing Jugurtha over to Sulla or Sulla over to Jugurtha. In the end Bocchus decided his future lay with Rome and he helped capture Jugurtha.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Sulla'', 3.</ref> Although Sulla had engineered the capture of Jugurtha, as Sulla was serving under Marius at the time, Marius took credit for this feat.

The town is located approximately {{convert|10|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} north of the border crossing into the United States It is about a one-hour drive southwest from [[Cranbrook, British Columbia|Cranbrook]] along the [[Crowsnest Highway]]. Due to its proximity to the U.S. border, many businesses in the town accept American currency. Similarly, [[Porthill, Idaho|Porthill]], the nearby US border town, accepts Canadian currency and sells gasoline in litres.\n\nCreston is the eastern terminus of the [[British Columbia Highway 3|Salmo-Creston highway]] constructed in the 1920s as a shortcut to avoid the long route north to [[Nelson, British Columbia|Nelson]] and crossing [[Kootenay Lake]] on the [[Kootenay Lake Ferry]] between [[Balfour, British Columbia|Balfour]] and [[Kootenay Bay]]. The Salmo-Creston highway, which is part of the Crowsnest Highway, connected with earlier highways eastward of Creston.\n\nCreston is one of the few towns in British Columbia that does not observe [[daylight saving time]].<ref name=\"mstdst\"/>\n\n==Economy==\nThe Creston Valley's economy is largely resource-based with [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]]. Many are employed in the service sector, and [[tourism]] is increasingly prominent, while government services and education<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page_Custom.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=5903004&Geo2=PR&Code2=59&Data=Count&SearchText=creston&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=59&B1=Custom |title=Statistics Canada |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109163849/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page_Custom.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=5903004&Geo2=PR&Code2=59&Data=Count&SearchText=creston&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=59&B1=Custom |archivedate=2016-01-09 }}</ref> comprise a large portion of the labour force. Since 1959, [[Kokanee beer]] has been [[brewing|brewed]] in Creston at the [[Columbia Brewery]].<ref>[http://www.columbiabrewery.ca/node/3 \"History\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013053209/http://www.columbiabrewery.ca/node/3 |date=2013-10-13 }} Columbia Brewery. Retrieved 2013-11-17.</ref>  The town is also home to two [[grain elevator]]s. Many apple, and cherry orchards grow in [[Erickson, British Columbia|Erickson]], an unincorporated area outside of Creston, and the valley is also an important dairy centre. The Creston Area produces the largest cherries{{clarify|date=November 2012}} grown in the northern hemisphere and exports them globally.  A primary market is Europe while Asia is second. A number of growers sell the same product they export to Europe at their road side markets.  The Skimmerhorn Winery<ref>[http://www.skimmerhorn.ca skimmerhorn.ca]</ref> is now producing award-winning wines, and the valley includes other growers cultivating vines.  Creston is home to [[CIDO-FM]], a volunteer-run, locally based, [[community radio]] station, which broadcasts in town, and in the Creston Valley at 97.7 FM.\n\n==Demographics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Canada 2016 Census!!

Daily maximum temperatures are usually above freezing even in January except when air masses of [[Arctic]] origin move over the area. The worst cold outbreaks may send temperatures below {{Convert|-30|C}} on rare occasions. Spring comes early by Canadian standards; trees usually start to leaf out before the end of April. A clear summer day is likely to have a daily maximum near or above {{Convert|25|C}}; the record maximum is {{Convert|39.4|C|0}}. The first fall frost usually holds off until October where air drainage is good.\n\nThe mean annual [[precipitation]] is {{Convert|662.4|mm|abbr=on|2}} in mid-town, but the area has a rather steep precipitation gradient which is reflected in regional ecosystems.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Creston, 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1912\u2013present\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan

[[Thuja plicata|western red cedar]], is common in the area. The sun-loving [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pine]] forms a larger proportion of the vegetation near Creston's southern boundary. [[Douglas fir]] is the most common native tree throughout; other large [[Pinophyta|conifers]] include [[Abies grandis|grand fir]], [[Larix occidentalis|western larch]], [[western white pine]] and [[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]]. Large pines other than the ponderosa are seldom seen in town, but are common in some of the woods nearby. The only native [[deciduous]] tree which matches the conifers in size is the [[Populus trichocarpa|black cottonwood]]. [[Betula papyrifera|White birch]] and [[Populus tremuloides|trembling aspen]] grow to medium size; smaller trees include the [[Acer glabrum|Rocky Mountain maple]] and [[Prunus emarginata|bitter cherry]]. Prominent among the non-native trees are [[blue spruce]], [[Aesculus|horsechestnut]], [[Acer platanoides|Norway maple]], [[Acer saccharinum|silver maple]], and several species of [[walnut]], including the [[Juglans cinerea|butternut]]. There also are occasional examples of [[catalpa]], [[chestnut]], [[Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia|London plane]], and [[Liriodendron tulipifera|tulip tree]].\n\nLarge mammals at Creston include [[cougar]], bear, [[beaver]], [[coyote]], deer, [[elk]], [[moose]], [[muskrat]] and [[North American river otter|river otter]].<ref>[http://www.crestonwildlife.ca/visit.shtml Things to see and do at the Creston Valley Wildlife Management Area - a 17,000 Acre Wetland of International Importance<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817050333/http://www.crestonwildlife.ca/visit.shtml |date=2007-08-17 }}</ref> More than 265 bird species occur in the Creston Valley, which is in a migration corridor for [[Anseriformes|waterfowl]] such as goose and swan; the valley is also a wintering area for [[bird of prey|birds of prey]].<ref>[http://www.crestonwildlife.ca/wildlifehabitatmanagement.html Creston Valley Wildlife Management Area<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602075754/http://www.crestonwildlife.ca/wildlifehabitatmanagement.html |date=2007-06-02 }}</ref> The Creston area hosts British Columbia's only remaining population of [[northern leopard frog]].<ref>[http://www.livinglandscapes.bc.ca/cbasin/endangered/northern2.htm Living Landscapes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Physiography and soils==\n[[Image:Skimmerhorn2.jpg|thumb|left| Purcell Mountains|alt=]]\n\nCreston is built on rolling [[Bench (geology)|bench-land]] immediately to the east of the [[Kootenay River]] floodplain. Beyond the bench-land to the east are the [[Purcell Mountains]]; their steep west-facing scarps are mistakenly called the Skimmerhorns, while the [[Selkirk Mountains]] rise west of the floodplain.\n\nSilt [[loam]] is the most common soil texture at Creston. The [[floodplain]] soils are dark and poorly drained for the most part; they are excellent for pasture and grains where drainage is improved. Some of the bench-land soils are brown and of good tilth; others are gray, deficient in organic matter, and have rather heavy calcareous subsoils.\n\n== History ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}\nThe Creston Valley has been inhabited by the [[Kutenai]] people for at least 11,000 years. The Kutenai are known for their [[Kutenai language|unique language]], the distinctive [[sturgeon-nosed canoe]], and cultural traditions that blend a dependence on fish, small game, and waterfowl with the annual bison-hunting traditions of the Plains nations.\n\nExploration of the Creston Valley began in 1808, when [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] passed through the region, followed by fur traders, prospectors, and government surveyors.  White settlement began in the early 1880s, and two railways, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and [[List of defunct Canadian railways#G|Great Northern Railroad]], built into the valley in the last years of the century. When the CPR purchased land from Fred Little for construction of the railway in 1897-8, he made it a condition of the sale that the town be named after [[Creston, Iowa|his home town in Iowa]]<ref name = Akrigg>{{Citation | last =Akrigg | first =G.P.V. | last2 =Akrigg | first2 =Helen B. | title =British Columbia Place Names | place =Vancouver | publisher =UBC Press | year =1986 | edition =3rd, 1997 | isbn =0-7748-0636-2 | url-access =registration | url =https://archive.org/details/britishcolumbiap0000akri_w1q9 }}</ref>{{rp|55}}\n\nAgriculture and forestry were the primary industries of the new community.  Mining attracted many people, but, like many other communities around the Kootenays, the mineral deposits of the Creston Valley were not large enough to support a significant mining industry here.\n\nSmall fruits and tree fruits were the principal agricultural products of the early decades of the 20th century, and the Creston Valley quickly gained a reputation for the quality, quantity, and variety of fruit. The neighbouring town of [[Wynndel]], for example, was known as the \"strawberry capital of the world\" by 1912. Reclamation of the flats alongside the Kootenay River, west of Creston, in 1935 led to large-scale grain production, again with outstanding quality and yields. Today, many livestock, dairy, and hay operations also contribute to the Valley's agricultural industry.\n\nGrowth of the community followed the development of local industry. By 1899 hotels, stores, and restaurants were established, along with the first volunteer fire department.  The first school was established in 1899; church services were being held by the early 1890s and the first church, outside of the missionary church on the Lower Kootenay Band reserve, was built in 1906. The first resident doctor, Dr. Henderson, arrived in 1908, and the first hospital opened in 1930.  Creston has a lot of buildings, downtown, that are or feature [[Art Deco]] architecture, and is one of the art deco capitals of [[Western Canada]] (for its size).  Creston was incorporated as a village in 1924, and as a town in 1965.\n\n== Notable current and former residents ==\n*[[Winston Blackmore]], polygamist sect leader<ref name=blackmore>Global News.

The town is located approximately {{convert|10|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} north of the border crossing into the United States It is about a one-hour drive southwest from [[Cranbrook, British Columbia|Cranbrook]] along the [[Crowsnest Highway]]. Due to its proximity to the U.S. border, many businesses in the town accept American currency. Similarly, [[Porthill, Idaho|Porthill]], the nearby US border town, accepts Canadian currency and sells gasoline in litres.\n\nCreston is the eastern terminus of the [[British Columbia Highway 3|Salmo-Creston highway]] constructed in the 1960s as a shortcut to avoid the long route north to [[Nelson, British Columbia|Nelson]] and crossing [[Kootenay Lake]] on the [[Kootenay Lake Ferry]] between [[Balfour, British Columbia|Balfour]] and [[Kootenay Bay]].

Daily maximum temperatures are usually above freezing even in January except when air masses of [[Arctic]] origin move over the area. The worst cold outbreaks may send temperatures below {{Convert|-30|C}} on rare occasions. Spring comes early by Canadian standards; trees usually start to leaf out before the end of April. A clear summer day is likely to have a daily maximum near or above {{Convert|25|C}}; the record maximum is {{Convert|39.4|C|0}}. The first fall frost usually holds off until October where air drainage is good.\n\nThe mean annual [[precipitation]] is {{Convert|662.4|mm|abbr=on|2}} in mid-town, but the area has a rather steep precipitation gradient which is reflected in regional ecosystems.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Creston, 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1912\u2013present\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan

[[Thuja plicata|western red cedar]], is common in the area. The sun-loving [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pine]] forms a larger proportion of the vegetation near Creston's southern boundary. [[Douglas fir]] is the most common native tree throughout; other large [[Pinophyta|conifers]] include [[Abies grandis|grand fir]], [[Larix occidentalis|western larch]], [[western white pine]] and [[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]]. Large pines other than the ponderosa are seldom seen in town, but are common in some of the woods nearby. The only native [[deciduous]] tree which matches the conifers in size is the [[Populus trichocarpa|black cottonwood]]. [[Betula papyrifera|White birch]] and [[Populus tremuloides|trembling aspen]] grow to medium size; smaller trees include the [[Acer glabrum|Rocky Mountain maple]] and [[Prunus emarginata|bitter cherry]]. Prominent among the non-native trees are [[blue spruce]], [[Aesculus|horsechestnut]], [[Acer platanoides|Norway maple]], [[Acer saccharinum|silver maple]], and several species of [[walnut]], including the [[Juglans cinerea|butternut]]. There also are occasional examples of [[catalpa]], [[chestnut]], [[Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia|London plane]], and [[Liriodendron tulipifera|tulip tree]].\n\nLarge mammals at Creston include [[cougar]], bear, [[beaver]], [[coyote]], deer, [[elk]], [[moose]], [[muskrat]] and [[North American river otter|river otter]].<ref>[http://www.crestonwildlife.ca/visit.shtml Things to see and do at the Creston Valley Wildlife Management Area - a 17,000 Acre Wetland of International Importance<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817050333/http://www.crestonwildlife.ca/visit.shtml |date=2007-08-17 }}</ref> More than 265 bird species occur in the Creston Valley, which is in a migration corridor for [[Anseriformes|waterfowl]] such as goose and swan; the valley is also a wintering area for [[bird of prey|birds of prey]].<ref>[http://www.crestonwildlife.ca/wildlifehabitatmanagement.html Creston Valley Wildlife Management Area<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602075754/http://www.crestonwildlife.ca/wildlifehabitatmanagement.html |date=2007-06-02 }}</ref> The Creston area hosts British Columbia's only remaining population of [[northern leopard frog]].<ref>[http://www.livinglandscapes.bc.ca/cbasin/endangered/northern2.htm Living Landscapes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Physiography and soils==\n[[Image:Skimmerhorn2.jpg|thumb|left| Purcell Mountains|alt=]]\n\nCreston is built on rolling [[Bench (geology)|bench-land]] immediately to the east of the [[Kootenay River]] floodplain. Beyond the bench-land to the east are the [[Purcell Mountains]]; their steep west-facing scarps are mistakenly called the Skimmerhorns, while the [[Selkirk Mountains]] rise west of the floodplain.\n\nSilt [[loam]] is the most common soil texture at Creston. The [[floodplain]] soils are dark and poorly drained for the most part; they are excellent for pasture and grains where drainage is improved. Some of the bench-land soils are brown and of good tilth; others are gray, deficient in organic matter, and have rather heavy calcareous subsoils.\n\n== History ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}\nThe Creston Valley has been inhabited by the [[Kutenai]] people for at least 11,000 years. The Kutenai are known for their [[Kutenai language|unique language]], the distinctive [[sturgeon-nosed canoe]], and cultural traditions that blend a dependence on fish, small game, and waterfowl with the annual bison-hunting traditions of the Plains nations.\n\nExploration of the Creston Valley began in 1808, when [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] passed through the region, followed by fur traders, prospectors, and government surveyors.  White settlement began in the early 1880s, and two railways, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and [[List of defunct Canadian railways#G|Great Northern Railroad]], built into the valley in the last years of the century. When the CPR purchased land from Fred Little for construction of the railway in 1897-8, he made it a condition of the sale that the town be named after [[Creston, Iowa|his home town in Iowa]]<ref name = Akrigg>{{Citation | last =Akrigg | first =G.P.V. | last2 =Akrigg | first2 =Helen B. | title =British Columbia Place Names | place =Vancouver | publisher =UBC Press | year =1986 | edition =3rd, 1997 | isbn =0-7748-0636-2 | url-access =registration | url =https://archive.org/details/britishcolumbiap0000akri_w1q9 }}</ref>{{rp|55}}\n\nAgriculture and forestry were the primary industries of the new community.  Mining attracted many people, but, like many other communities around the Kootenays, the mineral deposits of the Creston Valley were not large enough to support a significant mining industry here.\n\nSmall fruits and tree fruits were the principal agricultural products of the early decades of the 20th century, and the Creston Valley quickly gained a reputation for the quality, quantity, and variety of fruit. The neighbouring town of [[Wynndel]], for example, was known as the \"strawberry capital of the world\" by 1912. Reclamation of the flats alongside the Kootenay River, west of Creston, in 1935 led to large-scale grain production, again with outstanding quality and yields. Today, many livestock, dairy, and hay operations also contribute to the Valley's agricultural industry.\n\nGrowth of the community followed the development of local industry. By 1899 hotels, stores, and restaurants were established, along with the first volunteer fire department.  The first school was established in 1899; church services were being held by the early 1890s and the first church, outside of the missionary church on the Lower Kootenay Band reserve, was built in 1906. The first resident doctor, Dr. Henderson, arrived in 1908, and the first hospital opened in 1930.  Creston has a lot of buildings, downtown, that are or feature [[Art Deco]] architecture, and is one of the art deco capitals of [[Western Canada]] (for its size).  Creston was incorporated as a village in 1924, and as a town in 1965.\n\n== Notable current and former residents ==\n*[[Winston Blackmore]], polygamist sect leader<ref name=blackmore>Global News.
