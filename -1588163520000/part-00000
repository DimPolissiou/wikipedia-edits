Consisting of woodwind, brass, and percussion instruments (and until 2014, also stringed instruments), it represented both the Royal Regiment of Artillery, and the state. The Royal Artillery Orchestra (of the Royal Artillery Band) [disbanded on 9 February 2014] was Britain's first permanent professional orchestra.<ref>Groves Dictionary of Music & Musicians</ref> All other bands in the British Army received official, permanent status from 1763 onward. Now that the band's overall history of over four and a half centuries has come to an end, it is now claimed that the Band of the Grenadier Guards are the oldest band, with their overall history of over three hundred and thirty years. It is however, important to consider that until 1762, all military bands were formed as and when required, and then immediately disbanded when not, and that they consisted only of hired, civilian musicians.\n\n[[File:RA Band Lyre.jpg|thumb|The RA Band lyre, (No. 1 dress version) as worn only by the Royal Artillery's musicians, and on the right forearm ''(rather than the standard army 'bandsman's lyre' which is worn by other Army bandsmen and musicians, on the upper arm)'']]\n\nIt was announced on 30 July 2013 that the Royal Artillery Orchestra would cease to exist in favour of a forthcoming \"State String Orchestra\", now known as \"The [[Countess of Wessex\u2019s String Orchestra]]\" following the most recent cuts to Army Music.<ref name=\"army.mod.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/music/23333.aspx|title=The British Army - The Countess of Wessex\u2019s String Orchestra|website=Army.mod.uk|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn Sunday 9 February 2014, the Royal Artillery Band, and a specially formed 'Veterans of the Royal Artillery Band' paraded on General Gordon's Square for the last time in their home town of Woolwich, thus ending a 252-year era, before relocating to join their regiment at Tidworth Barracks, Wiltshire <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/music/23262.aspx|title=The British Army - Bands of the Corps|website=Army.mod.uk|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref> The Band spent [[Christmas]] 2013 in [[Afghanistan]], where they carried out their wartime role<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-26111473]</ref>, as well as continuing to entertain the troops, and accompanying such celebrities as Gary Barlow, and Katherine Jenkins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgreenwich.gov.uk/press/article/312/the_royal_artillery_band_will_be_marching_out_of_their_barracks_in_woolwich_for_the_last_time_on_sunday_9_february_ending_an_association_with_the_town_of_more_than_250_years|title=Greenwich press releases|first=|last=Greenwich|website=Royalgreenwich.gov.uk|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref> Its former accommodation in the historic Georgian Royal Artillery Barracks is now the home of the 24-piece Countess of Wessex's String Orchestra.<ref name=\"army.mod.uk\"/> \n\nIn October 2019, it was announced by the Corps of Army Music, that the last remaining artillery band, based at Tidworth in Hampshire, England, would amalgamate with two other army bands in line with the latest reorganization of music in the service.\n\n==History==\nThe Royal Artillery Band served as the musical arm of the artillery branch of the [[British Army]] (the [[Royal Regiment of Artillery]]).\n\nIn May 1660, the Lifeguards had their 'unofficial' kettledrums and trumpets. They also formed a band proper in 1763 after the end of the Seven Years' War. The [[First Foot Guards]] had their 'unofficial' fifes and drums in 1685 (some accounts state 1665), but their band proper was not founded until 1783 along with two other \"bands of the Foot Guards\".<ref name=\"farmer\">{{cite book | title=History of The Royal Artillery Band | url=https://archive.org/details/memoirsroyalart00farmgoog | publisher=London New York, Boosey & Co. | author=[[Henry George Farmer]] | year=1904}}</ref> As the [[Grenadier Guards]] were not formed until after the Battle of Waterloo (from surviving troops of the First and Second Foot Guards), any claim to a band of the Grenadier Guards  must be regarded as incorrect, and there are no accounts available of continuity between any Guards band which may have existed, and that of today's Grenadier Guards.\n\nIt was announced in a press release by CAMUS on 29 July 2013, that all orchestral capability in British Army bands would be terminated<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/music/23264.aspx]</ref> in favour of a new 24-piece state string orchestra, formed from a nucleus of ex-Royal Artillery strings players, who had been temporarily held, in various Guards bands during the establishment period of the orchestra, and newly recruited ex-civilian string players.

Bands known as 'Hoboys' (''Fr.'' ''hautbois'' = oboes) of the French Horse Grenadiers appeared throughout the English cavalry and foot guards regiments during campaigns, but were disbanded immediately afterwards, as \"surplus to requirements\". The regiment did however, appoint permanent drummers at least from 1751, because the Royal Clothing Warrant of that year states that the drummers \"were clothed in red. lined, faced, and lapelled on the breast with blue, and laced with the royal lace\" (i.e. 'royal livery' as still worn today by the Household Cavalry Band). The royal lace is a 22-karat gold braid with two thin purple stripes. The English Artillery's (civilian) musicians expanded into an eight-piece ensemble consisting of 4 oboes and 4 bassoons, with each of the musicians required to also perform at Court on a stringed instrument, and increasingly at regimental dinners. The eight musicians were hired by the officers of the regiment, and disbanded after every event. It wasn't until 1762, that a total of eight musicians would be hired permanently by the Regiment, when the Royal Artillery Band was 'officially' formed at Minden, Germany. In 1717 twenty (civilian) musicians - eight wind instrumentalists and twelve drummers - from the 'Artillerie' list augmented the Royal Band of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] aboard a barge on the [[River Thames]], situated \"close to the Royal Barge\" for the first performance of the ''[[Water Music (Handel)|Water Music]]'', by [[George Frideric Handel]]. The 'English' Artillery (the title 'Royal' was first used in the Regiment's appellation in 1720) raised additional musicians on ''ad hoc'' terms for occasions such as these, reverting immediately afterwards to the permanent eight. The composer Handel once again enlisted the musical services of the 'Artillerie' [Royal Artillery] on 27 April 1749 at the Royal Fireworks in [[Green Park]]. [The number of musicians augmenting the Royal Band on that occasion is unspecified, but particular mention of the \"Artillerie kettledrums (of a particularly large pattern)\" is nevertheless well documented. Kettledrums were confined to royal events in those days, and only the Lifeguards otherwise used kettledrums, but of the standard size, or in battle. In Germany, all kettledrummers were licensed to play them, and had to belong to the Guild of Kettledrummers]. The King had also requested that \"no fi''\u0111''els (stringed instruments) be used\", but the composer wrote on the score that all the oboe and bassoon parts should be doubled on strings (these players were again drafted from the Artillery) thereby confirming Handel's defiant intention to use string players regardless of the King's express wish.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nPrior to those given by Handel, all public performances of music in England were arranged directly by the Church, with the exceptions of processional music (royal, and military), and music for recruiting purposes. These performances of Handel's music are the first recorded in Britain, that were not connected to the Church, and among the first in Europe. Their popularity gave rise to occasional concerts before fee-paying audiences, and eventually to the existence of the first civilian professional orchestras, and the building of public concert halls.\n\nAt the formation of the now 'Royal Artillery' regiment in 1720, a special unit of artillerymen - which had been in existence since 1537 by royal charter, and which incorporated the Artillery Pikemen who date back to c. 1450 - the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] - was designated a ceremonial role, and in this capacity, they continue to exist, still maintaining their own band, the Band of the Honourable Artillery Company. The Honourable Artillery Company (now part of the British Army Reserve) is the oldest regiment in continuous service in the British Army (the [[Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey]], were formed 1337 but had a break in service to the crown from 1946-1987). The Honourable Artillery Company have always maintained through their ceremonial duties, close links with the Brigade of Guards. The Honourable Artillery's regimental band recruits a large number of ex-serving regular army musicians from the Royal Artillery, Corps of Royal Engineers and Guards as well as civilians with no previous military background. Apart from their source of musicians, there is no connection between the Honourable Artillery Company, and the Royal Artillery.  In 1830 [[King William IV]] decread that the HAC's ceremonial uniform should be modelled on that of the [[Grenadier Guards]]. The HAC are regarded as a [[City of London]] regiment, being the closest Territorial Army regiment to the \"Square Mile\"'. All City of London regiments (the oldest of these being the [[Royal Fusiliers]]) are entitled to wear red tunic and pelt headdress on parade.\n\nThe origin of these pikemen in fact predates the formation, in 1485 under the reign of King Henry VII, of the '[[Yeoman of the Guard]] of the State' (the Royal Bodyguard) and of the [[Yeoman Warders]] of the Tower of London (the Palace and Fortress Guard), whose identical livery is based closely on that of the pikemen of the period, from a time when helmets (rather than the Tudor hat), and breastplates were worn by all three bodies. The Yeoman Warders broke away from the body of the Yeoman of the Guard when the king gave up his residence at the Tower of London, which remained a royal palace, and therefore still required royal guards. One can readily identify the Yeoman of the Guard by their [[shoulder belt (military)|shoulder belts]] on an otherwise identical livery.\n\nThe original kettledrums of the Royal Regiment of Artillery were of a uniquely large pattern, and were mounted on a carriage, designed especially for the purpose, modelled on the already extant Prussian drum carriages, and which were drawn by six white horses. The first appearance of the carriage was during the [[Williamite War in Ireland]] of 1689. In 1751 the drums were described as being painted blue at the forefront, with rims in red, and carrying the arms of Great Britain. In 1772 the carriage was employed at the funeral of the first Duke of Marlborough, [[John Churchill]]. Until 1756 it remained in permanent use, and stored in the Tower of London (where the artillery guns were made), where it was eventually destroyed by fire in the mid-nineteenth century.\n\nThe  uniform worn by the kettle-drummer, the driver, and the leader, was not the usual uniform of the Royal Artillery. Instead, they wore court livery, as is still seen worn by the drum majors and mounted musicians of the Household Cavalry, on royal and state occasions {{as of | 2013 | lc = on}}. The entitlement of the Royal Artillery Band to wear court livery (or state dress) still remains, though nowadays it is never exercised, and is largely forgotten. A painting by J. Wootton, in the possession of Her Majesty the Queen and dated at around 1759, shows the drum carriage bearing the Artillery kettledrums, with the kettledrummer, driver, and rider dressed in state dress, and likewise, two mounted trumpeters halted behind the carriage. However, today's Royal Artillery [State] Band does maintain the distinction of being the only band in which each and every one of its musicians wears, as part of his ceremonial uniform, a band sword at the waist. These distinctive short swords were presented to the Band by [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|the Duke of Kent]], father of Queen Victoria. Band swords have been worn by other regiments' bands, and indeed by bandsmen in foreign bands, traditionally for the purpose of personal defence during active duty, in their non-combatant role.{{original research inline|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe Royal Artillery Band is also the British Army's only band whose members wear gold belts and gold crossbelts (all other bands wear white, where a crossbelt forms part of the uniform, apart from the Corps of Royal Engineers, the Royal Corps of Signals and now amalgamated Royal Corps of Transport who wear a crossbelt containing a high proportion of gold), as well as a uniquely styled musician's lyre badge, rather than the standard army bandsman's [[lyre]]. In 1994, because of the Royal Artillery Band's role supporting the ceremonial duties of the [[King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery]], it was granted permanent \"State\" status, thereby becoming the eighth, and only non-Household Division band to carry that status. It is for this reason that the Band continued to remain at Woolwich instead of relocating with the Regiment to Larkhill - the new permanent home of the Royal Regiment. On 7 February 2012, the King's Troop relocated from St. Johns Wood, to Woolwich. The Royal Artillery Band had however, assumed temporary State status on a number of significant occasions during the past. The Band will cease to be a State band in 2014, when, owing to funding cuts announced in 2013 in Army Music, it will lose its string capability, be reduced in number, and relocate to Tidworth, in Hampshire.\n\nBoth the Royal Regiment and the Royal Artillery Band have always been particularly important to the British monarchs, since the Prince of Wales (later King George IV), first regularly sang with the Band. It was George IV who was responsible for the Royal Artillery Orchestra's regular concerts, given at Windsor Castle - the first concerts in Britain performed by a professional orchestra (leading to the famous Woolwich Town Hall concerts, which continued until 2011). Indeed, Her Majesty the Queen, Queen Elizabeth II, as well as holding the honorary rank of Colonel-In-Chief of several other regiments, also holds the prestigious rank of \"Captain General\" both of the Royal Artillery and of the Honourable Artillery Company.\n\nFifers were added at the instigation of the officers of the Regiment to the Royal Artillery Corps of Drummers in 1748 on a permanent basis, and this unit continued until after the [[Crimean War]], when it became a bugle band. It soon became apparent that the musicians were becoming bored with the limited five-note compass of the instrument, and so they persuaded the instrument maker, Henry Distin to supply them with sets of his newly patented chromatic attachments, to enable the bugle to have the same compass as the cornet.  This proved very successful, particularly after the furore created on Woolwich Front Parade, when two buglers performed the Mess Call, playing 'The Roast Beefe of Olde England' in (inadvertent) two-part harmony. From that time, the 'keyed bugle' went into production. In Europe, and among the English troops, fifers, drummers (and pipers) have always been fighting soldiers, acting additionally as stretcher bearers as necessary.  There is no record, however, that this was ever the case in the Royal Artillery.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] ''(1756 - 1763)'', the 'modern' Royal Artillery Band was founded and formed by Lieutenant Colonel W. Phillips, at the [[Battle of Minden]] (1759) in Germany. It was granted official status in 1762. Phillips had much experience of seeing and listening to the Prussian bands, on which he unsurprisingly modelled his band. By the following year, the (German) musicians - of whom one, John Michael Bach, was the son of the third cousin to Johann Sebastian Bach - were now permanent paid members of the British Army, stationed at Woolwich, to the south east of London, at the home of the Royal Regiment of Artillery. Prior to this period all bands were raised only for special occasions and purposes, after which, they were immediately disbanded. The bands were not paid for by the State, but by the officers of their particular regiments.  Article 3 of the Royal Artillery Band's 'Articles of Agreement' of 1762 state that the [RA] musicians \"will be looked upon as actual soldiers and cannot leave the regiment without a formal discharge.\" In 1783, we see the first mention of \"three Foot Guards bands, each of 8 performers.\"\n\nWoolwich has been the home of the Artillery since the fifteenth century, as an important defence position guarding the port of London, and the Tower of London - the original home of the Royal Arsenal, where everything associated with artillery and grenades was produced, before a new arsenal was built at Woolwich.\n\n==Development & Absolution==\nBy November 1787, the Band (by now stationed at [[Woolwich]]) was under the command of its 'Master-Musician' Friederich Wiele, also an outstanding violinist. Among the eight musicians, there now numbered five Englishmen, and all of the musicians were capable of performing on stringed, as well as on wind, instruments. In 1795 the bandmaster George McKenzie described the band as possessing fifteen musicians. The rank of 'Musician' was still peculiar to the Royal Artillery alone; the rank of 'Private' was usual in all other bands, with the term 'bandsmen' used instead of 'performers' or 'musicians' (during the 'Options For Change' discussions between 1993 and 1996 it was finally decided to abolish the system of regimental bands of the line, and to retain only the staff- and corps- bands. Today, there are no 'bandsmen' in the British Army, as those remaining in service all hold the appointment 'Musician').\n\nIn 1802 the Band had recorded twenty one performers (the increase was probably owing to the absorption into its ranks of the Band of the [[Royal Irish Artillery]], on its disbandment in 1801). The proficiency of the musicians led to the desirability of more bands to entertain the numerous artillery regiments of the day. King Louis 14th of France devised his own orchestra, the '24 Violinists of the King' based on the military orchestras of the day (in 1626) which infers that either those extant in Germany, or that of the still unofficial Royal Artillery Band were seen as models. Until the death of Queen Victoria, and for a great many years beyond, the standard of the Royal Artillery Orchestra remained unsurpassed in Britain. The Orchestra continued to be regularly engaged, by royal command, to play during and after state banquets at Buckingham Palace, and Windsor Castle. Many first performances were given by the Orchestra, including, in 1868, the overture to 'Die Meistersinger von N\u0171rnberg' conducted by James Smyth. This piece would not be performed in this country by a civilian orchestra until the Philharmonic Orchestra of London included the work in a programme in 1882.\n\nFor almost five years (1805\u20131810), the Band was under the charge of Colonel Charles A. Quist, the Commanding Officer, even though a Herr M. Eisenherdt had been appointed as Master Musician. Colonel Quist, who by 1810 had assumed the appointment of Band Commandant suggested the initiation of a series of vocal and orchestral concerts, known as the \"Royal Artillery Concerts\".  These were held every week during the winters, at the RA Officers' Mess, and were conducted by some of the most distinguished musicians in London.\n\nWhile under the direction of George McKenzie, Master Musician (1810\u20131845), King William IV, having heard the Band play at the launching ceremony in 1883, of a ship in Woolwich, commanded the Band to play at the royal palace within the very same week (George McKenzie was appointed at the insistence of King George IV to Lord Bloomfield). King William wanted to present the Band with a pair of sterling silver kettledrums, but was disappointed when they were instead made of copper, enamelled, and \"beautifully painted\", so he also presented the officers with a superb candelabra. The inscription on the kettledrums reads \"Presented by His Majesty [[King William IV]]., 1833).\" In 1815 the Band of the Coldstream Guards had risen to twenty-two 'bandsmen', while in 1812, it is also recorded that the Royal Artillery Band comprised thirty-eight 'musicians'. By regulations, all bands, except that of the Royal Artillery which was not controlled by the [[War Office]], were restricted to ten players and a bandmaster in 1821. In 1823, regulations permitted fourteen players, by which time, the Royal Artillery Band numbered thirty-nine. At this time, the finest bands in the kingdom were the Royal Artillery Band under George Mackenzie, and the Court Military Band of [[George IV]], directed by Christian Kramer. The nineteenth century was a period of experiment and refinement among the instruments of outdoor music. The most successful of these instruments, were the saxophones (c. 1840), patented by [[Adolphe Sax]], which although are regarded popularly as 'woodwind', are actually single-reed brass instruments.  The Royal Artillery Band were quick to adopt the alto and tenor members from the family of nine instruments, which became useful in supporting the clarinets.\n\nAt the International Music Festival in Le Havre in 1925 the Royal Artillery Band won three first prizes, plus the coveted Conductor's Medal.\n\nStandardization of military bands, including instrumentation, sheet music, and drill, was an obvious requirement, if different bands were to perform together. Carlo Boos\u00e9, Bandmaster of the Scots Guards (himself German) recognized the need for uniformity of instrumentation.  In 1845 he produced the first British publication of a military band arrangement, which was received with such great enthusiasm, that the firm Boosey & Co. provided the funds to establish 'Boos\u00e9's Military Journal'.\n\nThe number of musicians in the Royal Artillery Band had risen to over seventy, by 1856, and by 1890, there were over a hundred performers. In 1856, the [[Duke of Cambridge]] proposed the acquisition of [[Kneller Hall]], at Whitton, near [[Twickenham]], for the permanent use of training Army musicians. Approval was received from all commanding officers, by way of a circular, on 4 December, and the first music class was scheduled to take place on 1 January 1857. The Royal Military School of Music was initially supported well by the majority of military bands, but with only four pupils to represent the Household Cavalry and Foot Guards.  However, both the Royal Artillery, and Royal Engineers Bands continued to train their musicians exclusively at the Royal Artillery Junior Musicians Troop, at Woolwich - a practice that would continue until the 1980s, later also including musicians from the Band of the Royal Signals (The Corps of the Royal Signals developed from the Royal Engineers Signals Unit, and was established in 1920). In 1894 there were a hundred and eighty-eight bands in the British Army, and this rose to a hundred and ninety-eight in 1926. It can be seen that for a small town to host this prestigious band was a big event, such as when [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]] invited the band to open its newly extended [[Central Bandstand, Herne Bay|Central Bandstand]] in 1932.<ref name=\"Town and Around 2013\" >{{cite web|url=http://www.townandaround.co.uk/editorial.php|title=Town & Around|website=Townandaround.co.uk|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref> Over the next sixty-seven years, the number of bands would decline.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Royal Artillery Band was allotted a war station in Yorkshire, where it was responsible for tours in the Northern and Scottish Commands, and  also completed a single tour of Northern Ireland. Towards the end of the war, the Band returned to London to serve the South Eastern Command, where it also provided a small detachment at Watford. There even existed a 'Royal Artillery Travelling Orchestra', which was conducted by the composer Robert Still, to support the main band, by allowing them to concentrate on their regimental and ceremonial engagements. The war years saw many associations between the Band, and fellow Gunner celebrities, such as Max Jaffa, Eric Fenby, Harry Secombe, and Spike Milligan, as well as recordings, and broadcasts with the Orchestra, for Vera Lynn, which it shared with the RAF Concert Orchestra, Mantovani and His Orchestra, and Roland Shaw and His Orchestra. After the war, the Band resumed its enviable position of being the band of choice for the most prestigious of national occasions. One of the most notable occasions took place on 30 November 1954, when the Royal Artillery Band gave a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in honour of their great admirer, Sir Winston Churchill, on his 80th birthday.\n\nAt the height of Queen Victoria's reign, the number of band personnel in the Royal Artillery rose to over one hundred and fifty, including its 'symphony orchestra' of over eighty musicians. The massed bands of the Royal Regiment of Artillery must therefore have been a truly formidable sight, particularly in the company of the [[Royal Artillery Mounted Band]] \"The largest mounted band ever seen\" (reprinted in 1984 in ''The Times''), and the various other minor artillery bands that also existed. By the end of the so-named 'British Empire', its size had reduced, but it continued to grow again, until, in 1977, the band comprised one hundred and twenty musicians, and on special occasions could be seen on parade with the regiment's massed bands - the Royal Artillery Mounted Band (forty-seven strong), and the (forty strong) Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band). In 1980, the Army Board had come to the conclusion that the Royal Artillery Band, the Royal Artillery Mounted Band, and the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band would be required to adopt a wartime role. At that time, there were sixty-eight bands in the Army, and apart from the Royal Artillery bands, all of them fulfilled the traditional wartime role as stretcher bearers. It was decided that in the case of the Royal Artillery bands, the musicians would be trained as drivers, and all three bands quickly ensured that their members were trained and qualified as HGV 2 drivers, with additional experience driving 10-tonne Monarch trucks, during Operation Lionheart, in 1982.\n\nToday's busy schedule includes regular public duties, such as the Changing of The Guard, and investitures at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, as the musicians continue to support Royal Artillery regiments throughout the country, appear at ambassadorial duties worldwide, and play at private engagements (necessary for providing an income towards instrument purchase and repairs, and new music scores and parts). Royal Artillery musicians have performed in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Africa, New Zealand, Hungary, China, Switzerland, Germany, France, Italy, Slovenia, throughout Scandinavia, and the Benelux countries, and more recently in Russia for the 2011 [[Spasskaya Tower Military Music Festival and Tattoo|Moscow Tattoo]]. The military band has also performed on a number of occasions at the Edinburgh Tattoo to a worldwide television audience. Presently, owing to the present size of the Royal Artillery Band, it can no longer simultaneously provide an orchestra and marching band, however, the full orchestra continues to maintain symphonic capabilities. ''[The Royal Artillery Orchestra plays Wagner]:'' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZNh21GuWAo Until recently, and since 1993, the only other band capable of providing a full symphony orchestra, was the Band of the Royal Engineers, at Chatham. Other ensembles currently  provided by the Band include a concert band, a brass quintet, a string quartet and sextett, a jazz quartet, a woodwind quintet, and a contemporary Rock orchestra called 'Voice of the Guns'. The Orchestra appeared in 2011 as 'House Band' at the first revival of the [[Royal Tournament]] (1884 as 'Royal' - 1999) at Earls Court, London. The marching bands taking part were those of the Household Cavalry, the Royal Marines, and the Central Band of the Royal Air Force.\n\nNotably, the Orchestra has toured with various musical celebrities in the recent past, including Nigel Kennedy, Sir Harry Secombe, Anne Shelton, Moira Anderson, Carlos Bonnell, John Ogden, Stephen Isserlis, Hayley Westenra, David Russell, and Semprini, to name a few. There is evidence that the Royal Artillery Orchestra, or musicians from its ranks, are paving the way towards more involvement between military musicians and contemporary artists in a commercial capacity, including, so far, with Stanley Cornfield, and the Strawbs, with [[Rick Wakeman]] (Stanley Cornfield: ''The Seawall'' [CD]; ''The Strawbs 40th Anniversary'' Volume 2 [CD & DVD]). This welcome trend is not however, completely unprecedented, as members of the Royal Artillery Band, and Royal Artillery Mounted Band, augmented the London Symphony Orchestra on their first '[[classic rock]]' album on LP, in 1976. The original gatefold album sleeve includes a photograph of timpanist John Keel in ceremonial dress.\n\nThe founder, director and conductor of the New Sousa Band, [[Keith Brion]] embarked on a series of recordings of the complete works of John Philip Sousa in 2000 on the Naxos Label. The series is expected to reach sixteen volumes, and encompass marches, waltzes, operatic, and concert works, by the finest military bands and orchestras. Volumes 1 to 8 were recorded by the Royal Artillery Band, conducted by Keith Brion.\n\nIn addition to the Royal Artillery Band (\"Band of the Royal Regiment of Artillery\"), there existed the Royal Artillery Band (Mounted Portion), the Royal Horse Artillery Band, the Royal Artillery Mounted Band (Woolwich), The Royal Artillery Mounted Band (Aldershot) [= later, the Royal Artillery Mounted Band], the Royal Garrison Artillery Band, the Royal Artillery (Portsmouth) Band [= the Royal Artillery B.A.O.R Band = later, the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band], the Royal Artillery Mounted Band, and the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band. Of these, the Royal Artillery Mounted Band (\"...the largest mounted band ever seen\", according to The Times, in June 1984) existed as auxiliary bands, and minor staff bands, together with the Royal Artillery Band (Woolwich) until the Mounted Band was disbanded in 1984, and the Alanbrooke Band in 1993. These two bands had, for a number of years, alternately filled the \"B.A.O.R.\" (British Army of the Rhine) post, at West Riding Barracks, Dortmund, until the withdrawal of the Regiment from there. The changeover occurred every five years, and the band returning to the United Kingdom, was likewise stationed for five years at Larkhill, Wiltshire. On occasion, these three bands would unite, as 'massed bands', of up to 197 performers, and more, if the massed bands comprised these with the Territorial Army's Artillery bands, and the Band of the Honourable Artillery Company, such as on Horseguards Parade in Whitehall. The three regular bands also appeared on two separate years as massed bands at the Edinburgh Tattoo.\n\nOn February 9th, 2014, The Royal Artillery Band (Woolwich) paraded for the last time, on Gordon Square, at Woolwich, in London, in preparation for the move of the Royal Regiment of Artillery to its new headquarters at Larkhill, in Wiltshire. However, the Band was relocated to Tidworth, in Hampshire, close by. The now Royal Artillery (Tidworth) Band continued to serve in Tidworth through further cuts and changes to army music, which included a transformation from 'military band' (i.e. with woodwind, brass and percussion instruments) to a brass band, and eventual talk of the brass band being reduced further to a quintet. By early October, 2019, it was announced by the Corps of Army Music (CAMus), that band would be absolved, by merging its existing musicians with those of two other bands, to form a new divisional army band in Tidworth.\n\n==Uniforms==\n\nThe present uniform of the band was created for the massed bands of the Royal Regiment of Artillery for the official birthday parade for Her Majesty the Queen, on Horse Guards Parade, in June 1986. The tunic replaced the No. 1 Dress Jacket, and was quilt-lined. More elaborate gold braiding was added, with emphasis on rank of the wearer. Patent leather boots were worn by the 'other ranks' for the first time. As the famous Royal Artillery Mounted Band had been disbanded in 1984, the only other regular Army band to appear on that parade, was the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band (disbanded in 1993). From the Territorial Army, the Regimental Band of the Honourable Artillery Company contributed to the massed Artillery bands on that occasion.\n\nThe Royal Artillery musicians' uniforms are based on the officers' pattern ceremonial uniforms of the past. From its uniform are derived (in some cases almost identically) the uniforms of the bands of the [[Royal Canadian Artillery]], the [[Royal Australian Artillery]], the [[Royal New Zealand Artillery]], and the [[Royal Netherlands Army Artillery]] (indeed the latter even have their equivalent of the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery). Slight differences are obviously evident between the nations, for example, the [[Royal Canadian Artillery Band]] wear white plumes, and do not wear spurs. The Royal Artillery Busby (based on the standard Hussars-pattern head dress) was also adopted by the Corps of Royal Engineers and the Royal Corps Signals, from the Royal Engineers, came the unusual busby as worn by the Royal Air Force Music Service until 2011.\n\n==Ceremonial dress==\n\n===Head dress===\nRHA officers' pattern sealskin (formerly bearskin) [[Busby (military headdress)|busby]] (not to be confused with the [[bearskin cap]], as worn by soldiers in the guards, and infantry), with tall white plume (ostrich feathers) attached to ferrule to the top of the front. Lanyard looped around cap. Red busby bag apparently, during the Napoleonic period, the bag could contain dried fruit (raisins) for sustenance when times were hard. It is also said that the other ranks' horse hair plumes were used in place of a shaving brush. Black leather chin strap faced with brass links. Only worn by King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery officers, and Royal Artillery directors of music.\n\n===Tunic===\nRA officers'-pattern ceremonial tunic (worn only by Directors of Music) in navy blue felt, quilt lined. Standing collar, fastened with hooks, and cuffs in scarlet felt, with scarlet piping to front button-hole edge. Ornate edging, and 'Austrian knots' in 18K gold twine braide. RA officers'-pattern bomb badges sewn onto collar. Gold epaulettes. Worn on the right arm is the unique Royal Artillery musician pattern lyre, in 18K gold wire on a black felt background. All other musicians in the British Army wear the standard bandsman pattern lyre, with the exception of musicians from The Household Division who do not wear a lyre on their uniforms.\n\n===Accessories===\n;Crossbelt\nLeather, covered with 18K gold panel and braiding, attached to which is an RA officers'-pattern embroidered pouch at rear.\n\n;Waistbelt and swordbelt with sling\nIn matching pattern to the crossbelt (above).\n\n;Trousers\nNavy blue cavalry-pattern tight-fitting cavalry-style pantaloons, with wide RA stripe in scarlet felt sewn onto outside of each leg. Leather straps with buckles are attached to the bottoms of the legs, which fasten under the arch of the boots.\n\n;Footwear\nCavalry officers'-pattern George boots in black patent leather, with box fittings in heels, for detachable silver spurs. Boots are secured by leather straps attached to hose.\n\n==Other ranks==\n\n===Ceremonial dress===\n;Head dress\nOther Ranks: RA sealskin [sable] busby (often artificial nowadays), with six-inch scarlet plume (horse hair) slotted into brass plume holder, in the form of a grenade, with the old-pattern RFA cap badge depicted on the 'bomb'. The plume (formerly scarlet cut-feathers) is held closed by a brass ring (a thicker ring is used on the Drum Major's headdress). No lanyard attached to cap. Red busby bag (as above). Black leather chin strap, faced with brass links. A similar busby is worn by the musicians of the Royal Engineers, and Royal Signals bands, with busby bags in their own Corps' colours, with the plume mounted in a similar plume holder to the side of the cap.  The Bandmaster's busby is similar to that worn by the Director of Music, but the white plume is smaller. At various times during the Band's history, other forms of head dress were worn, according to fashion.  These included the bearskin cap (similar to that worn by Guardsmen), the shako, and the pith helmet (identical in shape to the Victorian police helmet). Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, the RA No. 1 Dress peaked cap was worn as the sole form of ceremonial head dress. Unlike in all other bands, the Royal Artillery Band has always included a bandmaster as assistant to the Director of Music.  Since the reorganization of bands, and the foundation of the Corps of Army Music, a bandmaster has been appointed to each band in the standard roll of Training Officer / Musician.\n\n;Tunic\nBandsman-pattern navy blue felt tunic, quilt lined. Standing collar, fastened with hooks, and cuffs in scarlet felt, with scarlet piping to front button-hole edge. Ornate edging (with emphasis on rank held reflected in gauge), and 'Austrian knots' in 18K gold twine braide (with emphasis on rank held reflected in gauge). Other ranks'-pattern RA bomb badges (gold twine) sewn onto collar. Worn on the right arm is the unique RA Musician lyre badge, in 18K gold twine on black felt (all other British army musicians wear the standard Army bandsman-pattern lyre badge).\n\n===Accessories===\n;Crossbelt\nLeather, covered with 18K gold panel and braiding, attached to which is a cavalry standard-pattern pouch at rear, onto which is mounted a brass RA gun badge. Depending on the instrument played, a crossbelt may cause damage to the instrument, or be restrictive to movement.  Therefore, not all musicians wear a crossbelt. Similarly, certain musicians will be seen to wear a protective bib, or apron, normally in a complementary colour to their individual band uniform.\n\nThe purpose of the crossbelt pouch was so that an officer or senior rank could post an important message into the courier's pouch, by unhooking the leather tab, inserting the note, then securing the flap, in the briefest possible time.  The courier would then ride off at speed to deliver it. In some bands - a tradition still held by the bands of the footguards, larger pouches were used to store march cards (cards measuring approximately 180&nbsp;mm \u00d7 130&nbsp;mm on which the individual instrumental sheet-music parts are pasted). The march cards are held, to enable the player to read his part, in a heavy duty clip (known as a 'lyre') which is attached to his instrument. At the back of the lyre, but facing forward, is placed the 'backing card', to hide the music from the view of the public. The backing card normally shows the 'cap badge' of the regiment or corps.\n\n;Swordbelt\nIn matching pattern to the crossbelt (above).\n\n;Band sword\nA unique-pattern short sword hooked onto the swordbelt. The hook protrudes through the tunic, allowing the sword to hang visibly. Only worn by the Royal Artillery Band. The sword has never been worn by other Royal Artillery bands. The Bandmaster, Drum Major, and Band Sergeant Major carry the standard British Army sword, as worn by warrant officers.\n\n;Trousers\nNavy blue cavalry-pattern tight-fitting cavalry-style pantaloons, with wide RA stripe in scarlet felt sewn onto outside of each leg. Leather straps with buckles are attached to the bottoms of the legs, which fasten under the arch of the boots.\n\n;Footwear\nCavalry-pattern George boots in black leather (nowadays patent leather), with silver spurs screwed into the heels of boots. Boots are secured by leather straps attached to hose.\n\n==Drum major==\n[[File:The Royal Artillery Band (16748454504).jpg|thumb|The band's drum  major leading a parade.]]\nThe drum major, as the figurehead, and leader of the marching band, historically always wore a more flamboyant uniform to emphasize his special status. Today, in the Royal Artillery, this is shown by the amount of gold braid and facings on his uniform, an elaborately decorated crossbelt, and a heavier plume ring, holding closed a taller scarlet cut-feather plume. He carries a mace, which is used to signal his commands to the musicians, in conjunction with vocal commands as required.  The signals are closely observed by the bass drummer, who then administers a drum signal which is audible to every musician.  This is necessary, because the musicians must concentrate on reading from their [sheet music] parts. There was a period when the RA Drum Majors wore, contrary to the rest of the Band, a tall bearskin cap (similar to that worn by the Guards regiments), with a plume rising up one side of the cap, and draped round the crown, and down the other side.\n\nFollowing the Drum Major's command a mace signal indicates to the drummers (bass and side drums) when to commence the drum rolls. In the tradition of most regiments, Royal Artillery troops step off after two sets of three-pace drum rolls are sounded, in quick march time. Guards regiments traditionally step off after one set of five-pace rolls.  When the Royal Artillery Band appears on parade at the same time as troops and bands from the Guards and other regiments, a seven-pace drum roll is sometimes used to differentiate between themselves, and all other bands, with the Royal Artillery taking precedence. With the exception of the Guards' five-pace roll, which equals six beats, all other combinations of rolls consist of eight beats (or two bars in quadruple time).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armyuniforms/britishartillery/rauniform.htm|title=The Royal Artillery|publisher=The British Empire|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Master Musicians, Band Masters, Directors Of Music (1762\u20131994)==\n\nIn 1994 the Royal Artillery Band and Orchestra were absorbed in the new Corps of Army Music, which meant that, as with all the bands in the Corps, its musicians could be borrowed by other bands, or be posted to other bands as the need arose.  Likewise, musicians from other bands could find themselves playing in the Royal Artillery Band. Effectively, this spelt the end of individuality of sound of all bands, and for this reason, only directors of music, and bandmasters from the original Royal Artillery Band are below.\n* ''1762:'' 'Officially recognized' band is founded by Lieutenant-Colonel W. Phillips at Minden\n* ''1771\u20131774:'' Anthony Rocca is appointed Master-Musician, or Band Master ''(not to be confused with the later-designated role of 'Bandmaster' at Warrant Officer Class 1 level)''\n* ''1774\u20131777:'' Georg K\u00fchler, Master-Musician ''(who later styled himself as 'George Kealer')''\n* ''1777\u20131802:'' Friederich Wiele, Master\n* ''1802\u20131805:'' Herr G.

Zavertal received the following honours: the Jubillee Medal; the Royal Victorian Order; Cavaliere of the Crown of Italy; Order of the Redeemer (from the King of Greece); Knight Commander Royal Order of Takoya (Serbia), the Commander's Star of the Osmanieh (from the Sultan of Turkey), Society of St. Cecilia of Rome (elected member) and the Saxe-Coburg- Ernestine Order of Art and Science''\n\n''A conductor of international fame.  Prior to his appointment, the Duke of Cambridge, 'Commanding-in-Chief' had issued a Horse Guards letter to every commanding officer praising Kneller Hall's work in producing British bandmaster for the Army: ''\"I am gratified at finding that the system of training regimental musicians for promotion to the situation of Bandmaster - to the exclusion of civilians and foreigners - has worked so well...\"'' The appointment of Zavertal was in fact permitted by the Duke of Cambridge, who was not actually 'Commanding-in-Chief', but rather 'Colonel-in-Chief'. For the first time, we see the term 'Bandmaster' applied to the Master of the Band, which is similar to the current appointment in appearance only. Today, 'bandmaster' is an auxiliary position, held by a Warrant Officer, Class 1''.\n\n''1907\u20131936:'' Major Edward C. Stretton, Director of Music\n\n''Appointed for the \"continued prestige he will bring the Band\" (under Cavaliere (Sir) Zavertal's command, the Orchestra became internationally known, and little emphasis was given to maintaining the standard of the Wind Band. Zavertal was not himself, keen to appear on parades, and was happy to leave this side of the organization to the command of his SNCOs. In 1918, Stretton was awarded the MVO, by King George V''.\n\n''1936\u20131955:'' Lieutenant-Colonel Owen W. Geary, Director of Music\n\n''1955\u20131966:'' Major Sidney Victor Hays, Director of Music\n\n''The recordings made by the band under the directorship of Major Hays are among the most sought-after by collectors of military band music worldwide''.\n* ''1966\u20131976:'' Major Robert Quinn\n* ''1976\u20131985:'' Lieutenant-Colonel Stanley William Patch\n\n''Under Colonel Patch's baton, the Band excelled at light music in particular, and his authoritative knowledge of the music and life of the Strauss family was popularly regarded''.\n\n''1985\u20131988:'' Lieutenant-Colonel Frank Anthony Renton\n\n''Colonel Renton later became Principal Director of Music, British Army. An ex-director of music, of both the Royal Artillery Mounted Band, and the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band (the only director of music to hold the distinction of having served in all three bands of the Royal Regiment), who is widely regarded as one of the finest conductors to have served in the British Army.''\n\n''1988\u20131992:'' Major Clarence Roberts Collier Garrity\n\n''Ex-Director of Music, the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band. A consummate composer, arranger, and dance-band performer (saxophone & keyboard)''.\n\n''1992\u20131996:'' Major Terence Sean Davis\n\n''The final director of music to command the band before its absorption into the Corps of Army Music (CAMus) in 1994''.\n\nThe 'Bandmaster' in today's British military band is the 'Assistant Conductor' to the Director of Music, and represents him in his absence.  Among the performers of the band are the instrumental section leaders, whose job it is, to ensure a cohesive style of playing within their own sections, and where applicable, to be able to play solos.  In an orchestra, there is the addition of the Leader (Principal First Violin), who on occasion must be able to direct the orchestra (from the violin), or conduct. An unusual aspect of military bands is that, by necessity, a leader or section leader is selected for being the best exponent on his chosen instrument. The situation arises therefore, on a day-to-day basis, that an ensemble, band, or orchestra, must perform under the command of a musician of any rank, notwithstanding the fact that there may be senior-ranking musicians playing within the sections. The musician in charge is also completely responsible in rehearsal. Such a situation is often difficult to comprehend or accept, even from fellow servicemen. However, it should be remembered, that the musician in charge is representing the Director of Music. Senior-ranking members of the band, although in this case under the command of the lower rank, nevertheless remain at all times in control, in such areas as attitude, discipline, and presentation, leaving artistic control, and interpretation firmly in the hands of the leading musician.\n\n==Formation of The Corps of Army Music (1994)==\nOn 13 August 1994 the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] signed a warrant to allow the formation of the Corps of Army Music. It was her will and pleasure that all officers who were directors of music in the various corps and regiments, and all army musicians should transfer to the Corps of Army Music. The transfer took place on 1 September 1994. From that time, all bands were accorded a director of music, and a bandmaster. The latter's role being concomitant with that of Training Officer. The 'Private' rank of 'Bandsman' was abolished, in favour of 'Musician' of the former staff bands. Individual bands continue to wear the uniforms and cap badges of the regiments and corps which they support, but their personnel all belong to the same corps.\n\nThe Royal Artillery Band does not take a direct role in the [[Trooping the Colour]] parade. The Trooping the Colour as seen on [[Horse Guards Parade]] is a ceremony, which involves the whole of the [[Household Division]], the [[Household Cavalry]], and nowadays, also the [[King's Troop]] (as head of Her Majesty's Household Troops). While other regiments and corps hold similar trooping-the-colour ceremonies, that of the Guards is held annually to celebrate the official birthday of Her Majesty the Queen. The Royal Artillery Band is nevertheless always very much in evidence on the day of the Trooping the Colour, by taking part in the Royal Birthday gun salute given by the King's Troop in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].\n\nThe total number of bands remaining after 'Options for Change' was 29. By 2013, there were 23.\n\n===State bands===\nThe Royal Artillery Band is the oldest band in the British Army, but was the last regular army band to be accorded 'state band' status, a status which it lost on 9 February 2014 when both the Royal Regiment and its band vacated Woolwich Barracks. However, the Band had held the status of a state band twice before, during the reigns of King George II/King George III, and Queen Victoria. Notwithstanding, the Royal Artillery Band was often in demand for important state and public duties, and to represent the nation. It was the favourite band of King George IV, the Duchess of Kent (Queen Victoria's mother), Queen Victoria, and Sir Winston Churchill. The number of Regular Army State Bands, was further reduced on 1 September 2014, when The [[Musical ensemble|Band]] of the [[Life Guards (United Kingdom)|Life Guards]] and The Band of The [[Blues and Royals]] were joined to form The Band of The [[Household Cavalry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/music/24533.aspx|title=The British Army - History|website=Army.mod.uk|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref> At the same time the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)]] Bands of the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] and the [[Royal Yeomanry]] were both granted State Band status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://3daysinlondon.info/2015/08/04/a-band-concert-at-guildhall/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032019/http://3daysinlondon.info/2015/08/04/a-band-concert-at-guildhall/ |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Regimental music==\n===British Grenadiers March===\nThe tune '[[The British Grenadiers]]' was first adopted for use as a regimental march by the Honourable Artillery Company (the oldest British regiment), during the [[English Civil War]].  Although grenades were first launched by artillerymen in 1643, the term 'grenade' was only first documented in 1688.  Originally a Dutch song, the melody now known as 'The British Grenadiers' was brought to England by [[King William III of the Netherlands]].  Soon after the melody became popular in these islands, a version of it, titled 'The New Bath' appeared in a '17th Century Dance Book' by Playford.  In the Netherlands, it is known as 'De jonge prins van Friesland' ('The Young Friesian Prince') after Prince Johann Willem Friso.  In 1716, the march became the regimental quick march of the Royal Artillery, and was known as the 'Royal Artillery Grenadiers March', but was not declared 'official' until 1882.  It first appeared in print, as 'The British Grenadiers' in 1740.\n\nDuring the [[War of Spanish Succession]] (1702-1713) a text was added, which remains to this day in publications of the tune as a British folk song.\n\nThe 'British Grenadiers' later became the regimental march of both the Grenadier Guards, and the Royal Fusiliers (the Grenadier Guards were formed after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815). Notwithstanding the formation of the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) in 1685, the Grenade (a small incendiary device originating during the Eastern Roman 'Byzantine' Empire) is a weapon of artillery, and as such was always manufactured and kept in the royal arsenals of King Henry VIII at the Tower of London, and at Chatham, and Woolwich - both in the county of Kent, until the Fusilier regiments, and later the Foot Guards, each adopted them as standard weaponry. Therefore, the original grenadiers, were in fact artillerymen.\n\nAs a regimental quick march, the short duration of the melody has always resulted in unwanted repetition, but in 1983, Lieutenant-Colonel Stanley Patch (then Director of Music) provided a suitable solution, by adding the ''Trio'' section of another favourite artillery march, 'The Voice of The Guns', composed by Major F.J. Ricketts under the pseudonym '[[Kenneth J. Alford]]'. The popularity of the tune 'The British Grenadiers' during the Napoleonic Wars rivalled that of its contemporary '[[Lilliburlero]]', and subsequently led to its adoption by all regiments who wear as their cap or collar badges, the symbol of the grenade.\n\n===The Trayne Of Artillery's Grenadiers March===\nPrior to the Royal Artillery adopting 'The British Grenadiers' in 1716 as its regimental quick march, 'The Train of Artillery' (as it is now known) was the rather elegant (medium-) original quick march of the royal regiment. The march later appeared in print for the first time, published by Thompson & Son, London, in 'The Compleat Tutor for the Fife', circa 1760. The first ''grenadiers'', or grenade-throwers were artillery soldiers.\n\nThe original military march is scored for eight players, comprising 2 piccolos (in two-part counterpoint), 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, and 2 drums. At the time, the two piccolos were played by the two clarinetists of the band, who alternated between clarinet and piccolo as required. Two updated recordings exist by the Royal Artillery - one conducted by its director of music Major Robert Quinn (in 18th-century style, albeit for full modern military band), and a contemporary version, arranged and conducted by Lt Colonel Malcom Torrent.\n\n===The Minden Rose===\nThe origins of this march are obscure.  The piece was first documented as 'Mindener-Marsch', and possibly came into being during the battle of Minden.\nIn style, it is a ceremonial 'Reiter-Marsch', or cavalry march, and probably adapted to accompany the horse-drawn guns of the Artillery, from a German regional folk song.\n\n===The Marquess Of Granby's March===\nThe [[Marquess of Granby]] (the Earl of Rutland) was Master-General of the Regiment (1763\u20131772), and was preceded by General Ligonier (1759\u20131763) after whom, a now forgotten slow march 'General Ligonier's March' was named. The appointment 'Master-General' is nowadays known as 'Master Gunner, St. James's Park' (not to be confused with 'Master Gunner', which is a Warrant Officer special skills appointment).\n\n===The Royal Artillery Slow March===\nThe Royal Artillery Slow March was composed by Princess Louisa Victoria, Duchess of Kent, and mother of Queen Victoria (herself \"a most competent musician\"), circa 1836, and first used in 1843.  It is also the regimental walk march of the Royal Horse Artillery, and is also used (but in a different version) by the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. Until 1843, when the first 'regimental marches' were officially chosen (at the suggestion of George Mackenzie, Master of the Royal Artillery Band), regiments became accustomed to those marches that were played regularly for representation and recognition purposes, which had usually been composed by the current masters of their bands. With each change of master, marches lapsed into disuse, to be replaced by newer ones.\n\n===Regimental Trot 'The Keel Row'===\nThe Royal Horse Artillery (and cavalry regiments) adopted this Tyneside air in 1903 on its publication by the War Office.\nThis march is one example of the Regiment's intention to cater for all of its troops, drawn, as they were, from all regions of the United Kingdom. By comparison, almost all other regiments have traditionally recruited locally (e.g. the Devon & Dorset Regiment, the Durham Light Infantry, the Royal Hampshire Regiment, the Green Howards, etc.).\n\n===Regimental Canter 'Bonnie Dundee'===\nThe melody of 'Bonnie Dundee' dates back to the [[battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314. By 1600 the melody was certainly known all over Scotland and England.  It appears in 'The Beggar's Opera' and was used by Robert Burns. It is also associated with a poem by Sir Walter Scott, which commemorates the Viscount of Dundee's bravery in the 1689 rebellion. It is believed that the title of this melody refers to the Viscount of Dundee, rather than to the jute-, and marmalade-producing city of the same name.\n\n===Fanfare 'The Royal Regiment'===\nThe composer [[Frederic Curzon]] (1899, London \u2013 1973, Bournemouth) was at one time, a Gunner officer. Curzon wrote this fanfare for the opening of the Royal Artillery Association Rally in 1952. Its masterful use of both the RA's and RHA's 'Trumpet Call' typify the composer's penchant for incorporating melodies that he associated with his personal experiences in life.\n\nOf his many lasting compositions, perhaps the most perennial are the suites \"Robin Hood\", \"In Malaga\", \"Dance Of An Ostracized Imp\", \"Galavant\", and \"The Boulevardier\", all of which continue to be performed, and recorded by orchestras worldwide. Frederic Curzon frequently performed as an unofficial band member at the Royal Artillery Officers Mess in Woolwich, playing violin, cello, piano, and organ. He was an honorary member of the Royal Artillery Band.\n\nOther notable composers who wrote specially for the Royal Artillery Band include Zavertal, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, C P E Bach, and Sir Arthur Bliss, Master of the Queen's Music.\n\n===The 'Eton Boating Song'===\nThe 'Eton Boating Song' was composed in 1863 by one Captain Algernon Drummond, and transcribed by T. L. Mitchell, and the piano accompaniment was arranged by Evelyn Wodehouse. The words of [[Kipling]]'s 'Screw Guns' from his 'Barrack Room Ballads' are well known to RA officers and soldiers.  Screw guns were so-named, because the barrels could be broken down into pieces, to be carried on mules in mountainous regions. They were last used during the Second World War, by RA Mountain Regiments in the campaign in Italy.  The piece was arranged for orchestra, with a transcribed edition for military band, by Karl Kaps, as an 'English' (='slow', with 3 definite beats to the bar) waltz, and published by B. Feldman & Co. London.\n\n== First performances & Cinema ==\n* H\u00c4NDEL: 'Music For The Royal Fireworks'* (orchestra comprising musicians from the Royal Artillery, and from the Royal Band) (World Premiere)\n* H\u00c4NDEL: 'Water Music'* (orchestra comprising musicians from the Royal Artillery, and from the Royal Band) (World Premiere)\n* DVO\u0158\u00c1K: Symphony No. 2 (British premiere to a private, invited audience at Woowich, London)\n* DVO\u0158\u00c1K: 'A Symphony From The New World' (British premiere to a private, invited audience at Woowich, London)\n* WAGNER: Overture, and orchestral music from 'Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg' (British Premiere)\n* SMETANA: Overture to 'Prodana Nevesta' ('The Bartered Bride') (British Premiere)\n\n''*Royal Band of King George II/strings and kettledrums of the Artillery Band''\n\n'''CINEMA'''\n\nThis list includes the most recent appearances by the Royal Artillery Band in films (movies), and films in which recordings by the Royal Artillery Band have been included on the soundtracks.

Consisting of woodwind, brass, and percussion instruments (and until 2014, also stringed instruments), it represented both the Royal Regiment of Artillery, and the state.

It is however, important to consider that until 1762, all military bands were formed as and when required, and then immediately disbanded when not, and that they consisted only of hired, civilian musicians.\n\n[[File:RA Band Lyre.jpg|thumb|The RA Band lyre, (No. 1 dress version) as worn only by the Royal Artillery's musicians, and on the right forearm ''(rather than the standard army 'bandsman's lyre' which is worn by other Army bandsmen and musicians, on the upper arm)'']]\n\nIt was announced on 30 July 2013 that the Royal Artillery Orchestra would cease to exist in favour of a forthcoming \"State String Orchestra\", now known as \"The [[Countess of Wessex\u2019s String Orchestra]]\" following the most recent cuts to Army Music.<ref name=\"army.mod.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/music/23333.aspx|title=The British Army - The Countess of Wessex\u2019s String Orchestra|website=Army.mod.uk|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn Sunday 9 February 2014, the Royal Artillery Band, and a specially formed 'Veterans of the Royal Artillery Band' paraded on General Gordon's Square for the last time in their home town of Woolwich, thus ending a 252-year era, before relocating to join their regiment at Tidworth Barracks, Wiltshire <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/music/23262.aspx|title=The British Army - Bands of the Corps|website=Army.mod.uk|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref> The Band spent [[Christmas]] 2013 in [[Afghanistan]], where they carried out their wartime role<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-26111473]</ref>, as well as continuing to entertain the troops, and accompanying such celebrities as Gary Barlow, and Katherine Jenkins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgreenwich.gov.uk/press/article/312/the_royal_artillery_band_will_be_marching_out_of_their_barracks_in_woolwich_for_the_last_time_on_sunday_9_february_ending_an_association_with_the_town_of_more_than_250_years|title=Greenwich press releases|first=|last=Greenwich|website=Royalgreenwich.gov.uk|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref> Its former accommodation in the historic Georgian Royal Artillery Barracks is now the home of the 24-piece Countess of Wessex's String Orchestra.<ref name=\"army.mod.uk\"/> \n\nIn October 2019, it was announced by the Corps of Army Music, that the last remaining artillery band, based at Tidworth in Hampshire, England, would amalgamate with two other army bands in line with the latest reorganization of music in the service.\n\n==History==\nThe Royal Artillery Band served as the musical arm of the artillery branch of the [[British Army]] (the [[Royal Regiment of Artillery]]).\n\nIn May 1660, the Lifeguards had their 'unofficial' kettledrums and trumpets. They also formed a band proper in 1763 after the end of the Seven Years' War. The [[First Foot Guards]] had their 'unofficial' fifes and drums in 1685 (some accounts state 1665), but their band proper was not founded until 1783 along with two other \"bands of the Foot Guards\".<ref name=\"farmer\">{{cite book | title=History of The Royal Artillery Band | url=https://archive.org/details/memoirsroyalart00farmgoog | publisher=London New York, Boosey & Co. | author=[[Henry George Farmer]] | year=1904}}</ref> As the [[Grenadier Guards]] were not formed until after the Battle of Waterloo (from surviving troops of the First and Second Foot Guards), any claim to a band of the Grenadier Guards  must be regarded as incorrect, and there are no accounts available of continuity between any Guards band which may have existed, and that of today's Grenadier Guards.\n\nIt was announced in a press release by CAMUS on 29 July 2013, that all orchestral capability in British Army bands would be terminated<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/music/23264.aspx]</ref> in favour of a new 24-piece state string orchestra, formed from a nucleus of ex-Royal Artillery strings players, who had been temporarily held, in various Guards bands during the establishment period of the orchestra, and newly recruited ex-civilian string players.

Bands known as 'Hoboys' (''Fr.'' ''hautbois'' = oboes) of the French Horse Grenadiers appeared throughout the English cavalry and foot guards regiments during campaigns, but were disbanded immediately afterwards, as \"surplus to requirements\". The regiment did however, appoint permanent drummers at least from 1751, because the Royal Clothing Warrant of that year states that the drummers \"were clothed in red. lined, faced, and lapelled on the breast with blue, and laced with the royal lace\" (i.e. 'royal livery' as still worn today by the Household Cavalry Band). The royal lace is a 22-karat gold braid with two thin purple stripes. The English Artillery's (civilian) musicians expanded into an eight-piece ensemble consisting of 4 oboes and 4 bassoons, with each of the musicians required to also perform at Court on a stringed instrument, and increasingly at regimental dinners. The eight musicians were hired by the officers of the regiment, and disbanded after every event. It wasn't until 1762, that a total of eight musicians would be hired permanently by the Regiment, when the Royal Artillery Band was 'officially' formed at Minden, Germany. In 1717 twenty (civilian) musicians - eight wind instrumentalists and twelve drummers - from the 'Artillerie' list augmented the Royal Band of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] aboard a barge on the [[River Thames]], situated \"close to the Royal Barge\" for the first performance of the ''[[Water Music (Handel)|Water Music]]'', by [[George Frideric Handel]]. The 'English' Artillery (the title 'Royal' was first used in the Regiment's appellation in 1720) raised additional musicians on ''ad hoc'' terms for occasions such as these, reverting immediately afterwards to the permanent eight. The composer Handel once again enlisted the musical services of the 'Artillerie' [Royal Artillery] on 27 April 1749 at the Royal Fireworks in [[Green Park]]. [The number of musicians augmenting the Royal Band on that occasion is unspecified, but particular mention of the \"Artillerie kettledrums (of a particularly large pattern)\" is nevertheless well documented. Kettledrums were confined to royal events in those days, and only the Lifeguards otherwise used kettledrums, but of the standard size, or in battle. In Germany, all kettledrummers were licensed to play them, and had to belong to the Guild of Kettledrummers]. The King had also requested that \"no fi''\u0111''els (stringed instruments) be used\", but the composer wrote on the score that all the oboe and bassoon parts should be doubled on strings (these players were again drafted from the Artillery) thereby confirming Handel's defiant intention to use string players regardless of the King's express wish.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nPrior to those given by Handel, all public performances of music in England were arranged directly by the Church, with the exceptions of processional music (royal, and military), and music for recruiting purposes. These performances of Handel's music are the first recorded in Britain, that were not connected to the Church, and among the first in Europe. Their popularity gave rise to occasional concerts before fee-paying audiences, and eventually to the existence of the first civilian professional orchestras, and the building of public concert halls.\n\nAt the formation of the now 'Royal Artillery' regiment in 1720, a special unit of artillerymen - which had been in existence since 1537 by royal charter, and which incorporated the Artillery Pikemen who date back to c. 1450 - the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] - was designated a ceremonial role, and in this capacity, they continue to exist, still maintaining their own band, the Band of the Honourable Artillery Company. The Honourable Artillery Company (now part of the British Army Reserve) is the oldest regiment in continuous service in the British Army (the [[Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey]], were formed 1337 but had a break in service to the crown from 1946-1987). The Honourable Artillery Company have always maintained through their ceremonial duties, close links with the Brigade of Guards. The Honourable Artillery's regimental band recruits a large number of ex-serving regular army musicians from the Royal Artillery, Corps of Royal Engineers and Guards as well as civilians with no previous military background. Apart from their source of musicians, there is no connection between the Honourable Artillery Company, and the Royal Artillery.  In 1830 [[King William IV]] decread that the HAC's ceremonial uniform should be modelled on that of the [[Grenadier Guards]]. The HAC are regarded as a [[City of London]] regiment, being the closest Territorial Army regiment to the \"Square Mile\"'. All City of London regiments (the oldest of these being the [[Royal Fusiliers]]) are entitled to wear red tunic and pelt headdress on parade.\n\nThe origin of these pikemen in fact predates the formation, in 1485 under the reign of King Henry VII, of the '[[Yeoman of the Guard]] of the State' (the Royal Bodyguard) and of the [[Yeoman Warders]] of the Tower of London (the Palace and Fortress Guard), whose identical livery is based closely on that of the pikemen of the period, from a time when helmets (rather than the Tudor hat), and breastplates were worn by all three bodies. The Yeoman Warders broke away from the body of the Yeoman of the Guard when the king gave up his residence at the Tower of London, which remained a royal palace, and therefore still required royal guards. One can readily identify the Yeoman of the Guard by their [[shoulder belt (military)|shoulder belts]] on an otherwise identical livery.\n\nThe original kettledrums of the Royal Regiment of Artillery were of a uniquely large pattern, and were mounted on a carriage, designed especially for the purpose, modelled on the already extant Prussian drum carriages, and which were drawn by six white horses. The first appearance of the carriage was during the [[Williamite War in Ireland]] of 1689. In 1751 the drums were described as being painted blue at the forefront, with rims in red, and carrying the arms of Great Britain. In 1772 the carriage was employed at the funeral of the first Duke of Marlborough, [[John Churchill]]. Until 1756 it remained in permanent use, and stored in the Tower of London (where the artillery guns were made), where it was eventually destroyed by fire in the mid-nineteenth century.\n\nThe  uniform worn by the kettle-drummer, the driver, and the leader, was not the usual uniform of the Royal Artillery. Instead, they wore court livery, as is still seen worn by the drum majors and mounted musicians of the Household Cavalry, on royal and state occasions {{as of | 2013 | lc = on}}. The entitlement of the Royal Artillery Band to wear court livery (or state dress) still remains, though nowadays it is never exercised, and is largely forgotten. A painting by J. Wootton, in the possession of Her Majesty the Queen and dated at around 1759, shows the drum carriage bearing the Artillery kettledrums, with the kettledrummer, driver, and rider dressed in state dress, and likewise, two mounted trumpeters halted behind the carriage. However, today's Royal Artillery [State] Band does maintain the distinction of being the only band in which each and every one of its musicians wears, as part of his ceremonial uniform, a band sword at the waist. These distinctive short swords were presented to the Band by [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|the Duke of Kent]], father of Queen Victoria. Band swords have been worn by other regiments' bands, and indeed by bandsmen in foreign bands, traditionally for the purpose of personal defence during active duty, in their non-combatant role.{{original research inline|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe Royal Artillery Band is also the British Army's only band whose members wear gold belts and gold crossbelts (all other bands wear white, where a crossbelt forms part of the uniform, apart from the Corps of Royal Engineers, the Royal Corps of Signals and now amalgamated Royal Corps of Transport who wear a crossbelt containing a high proportion of gold), as well as a uniquely styled musician's lyre badge, rather than the standard army bandsman's [[lyre]]. In 1994, because of the Royal Artillery Band's role supporting the ceremonial duties of the [[King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery]], it was granted permanent \"State\" status, thereby becoming the eighth, and only non-Household Division band to carry that status. It is for this reason that the Band continued to remain at Woolwich instead of relocating with the Regiment to Larkhill - the new permanent home of the Royal Regiment. On 7 February 2012, the King's Troop relocated from St. Johns Wood, to Woolwich. The Royal Artillery Band had however, assumed temporary State status on a number of significant occasions during the past. The Band will cease to be a State band in 2014, when, owing to funding cuts announced in 2013 in Army Music, it will lose its string capability, be reduced in number, and relocate to Tidworth, in Hampshire.\n\nBoth the Royal Regiment and the Royal Artillery Band have always been particularly important to the British monarchs, since the Prince of Wales (later King George IV), first regularly sang with the Band. It was George IV who was responsible for the Royal Artillery Orchestra's regular concerts, given at Windsor Castle - the first concerts in Britain performed by a professional orchestra (leading to the famous Woolwich Town Hall concerts, which continued until 2011). Indeed, Her Majesty the Queen, Queen Elizabeth II, as well as holding the honorary rank of Colonel-In-Chief of several other regiments, also holds the prestigious rank of \"Captain General\" both of the Royal Artillery and of the Honourable Artillery Company.\n\nFifers were added at the instigation of the officers of the Regiment to the Royal Artillery Corps of Drummers in 1748 on a permanent basis, and this unit continued until after the [[Crimean War]], when it became a bugle band. It soon became apparent that the musicians were becoming bored with the limited five-note compass of the instrument, and so they persuaded the instrument maker, Henry Distin to supply them with sets of his newly patented chromatic attachments, to enable the bugle to have the same compass as the cornet.  This proved very successful, particularly after the furore created on Woolwich Front Parade, when two buglers performed the Mess Call, playing 'The Roast Beefe of Olde England' in (inadvertent) two-part harmony. From that time, the 'keyed bugle' went into production. In Europe, and among the English troops, fifers, drummers (and pipers) have always been fighting soldiers, acting additionally as stretcher bearers as necessary.  There is no record, however, that this was ever the case in the Royal Artillery.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] ''(1756 - 1763)'', the 'modern' Royal Artillery Band was founded and formed by Lieutenant Colonel W. Phillips, at the [[Battle of Minden]] (1759) in Germany. It was granted official status in 1762. Phillips had much experience of seeing and listening to the Prussian bands, on which he unsurprisingly modelled his band. By the following year, the (German) musicians - of whom one, John Michael Bach, was the son of the third cousin to Johann Sebastian Bach - were now permanent paid members of the British Army, stationed at Woolwich, to the south east of London, at the home of the Royal Regiment of Artillery. Prior to this period all bands were raised only for special occasions and purposes, after which, they were immediately disbanded. The bands were not paid for by the State, but by the officers of their particular regiments.  Article 3 of the Royal Artillery Band's 'Articles of Agreement' of 1762 state that the [RA] musicians \"will be looked upon as actual soldiers and cannot leave the regiment without a formal discharge.\" In 1783, we see the first mention of \"three Foot Guards bands, each of 8 performers.\"\n\nWoolwich has been the home of the Artillery since the fifteenth century, as an important defence position guarding the port of London, and the Tower of London - the original home of the Royal Arsenal, where everything associated with artillery and grenades was produced, before a new arsenal was built at Woolwich.\n\n==Development & Absolution==\nBy November 1787, the Band (by now stationed at [[Woolwich]]) was under the command of its 'Master-Musician' Friederich Wiele, also an outstanding violinist. Among the eight musicians, there now numbered five Englishmen, and all of the musicians were capable of performing on stringed, as well as on wind, instruments. In 1795 the bandmaster George McKenzie described the band as possessing fifteen musicians. The rank of 'Musician' was still peculiar to the Royal Artillery alone; the rank of 'Private' was usual in all other bands, with the term 'bandsmen' used instead of 'performers' or 'musicians' (during the 'Options For Change' discussions between 1993 and 1996 it was finally decided to abolish the system of regimental bands of the line, and to retain only the staff- and corps- bands. Today, there are no 'bandsmen' in the British Army, as those remaining in service all hold the appointment 'Musician').\n\nIn 1802 the Band had recorded twenty one performers (the increase was probably owing to the absorption into its ranks of the Band of the [[Royal Irish Artillery]], on its disbandment in 1801). The proficiency of the musicians led to the desirability of more bands to entertain the numerous artillery regiments of the day. King Louis 14th of France devised his own orchestra, the '24 Violinists of the King' based on the military orchestras of the day (in 1626) which infers that either those extant in Germany, or that of the still unofficial Royal Artillery Band were seen as models. Until the death of Queen Victoria, and for a great many years beyond, the standard of the Royal Artillery Orchestra remained unsurpassed in Britain. The Orchestra continued to be regularly engaged, by royal command, to play during and after state banquets at Buckingham Palace, and Windsor Castle. Many first performances were given by the Orchestra, including, in 1868, the overture to 'Die Meistersinger von N\u0171rnberg' conducted by James Smyth. This piece would not be performed in this country by a civilian orchestra until the Philharmonic Orchestra of London included the work in a programme in 1882.\n\nFor almost five years (1805\u20131810), the Band was under the charge of Colonel Charles A. Quist, the Commanding Officer, even though a Herr M. Eisenherdt had been appointed as Master Musician. Colonel Quist, who by 1810 had assumed the appointment of Band Commandant suggested the initiation of a series of vocal and orchestral concerts, known as the \"Royal Artillery Concerts\".  These were held every week during the winters, at the RA Officers' Mess, and were conducted by some of the most distinguished musicians in London.\n\nWhile under the direction of George McKenzie, Master Musician (1810\u20131845), King William IV, having heard the Band play at the launching ceremony in 1883, of a ship in Woolwich, commanded the Band to play at the royal palace within the very same week (George McKenzie was appointed at the insistence of King George IV to Lord Bloomfield). King William wanted to present the Band with a pair of sterling silver kettledrums, but was disappointed when they were instead made of copper, enamelled, and \"beautifully painted\", so he also presented the officers with a superb candelabra. The inscription on the kettledrums reads \"Presented by His Majesty [[King William IV]]., 1833).\" In 1815 the Band of the Coldstream Guards had risen to twenty-two 'bandsmen', while in 1812, it is also recorded that the Royal Artillery Band comprised thirty-eight 'musicians'. By regulations, all bands, except that of the Royal Artillery which was not controlled by the [[War Office]], were restricted to ten players and a bandmaster in 1821. In 1823, regulations permitted fourteen players, by which time, the Royal Artillery Band numbered thirty-nine. At this time, the finest bands in the kingdom were the Royal Artillery Band under George Mackenzie, and the Court Military Band of [[George IV]], directed by Christian Kramer. The nineteenth century was a period of experiment and refinement among the instruments of outdoor music. The most successful of these instruments, were the saxophones (c. 1840), patented by [[Adolphe Sax]], which although are regarded popularly as 'woodwind', are actually single-reed brass instruments.  The Royal Artillery Band were quick to adopt the alto and tenor members from the family of nine instruments, which became useful in supporting the clarinets.\n\nAt the International Music Festival in Le Havre in 1925 the Royal Artillery Band won three first prizes, plus the coveted Conductor's Medal.\n\nStandardization of military bands, including instrumentation, sheet music, and drill, was an obvious requirement, if different bands were to perform together. Carlo Boos\u00e9, Bandmaster of the Scots Guards (himself German) recognized the need for uniformity of instrumentation.  In 1845 he produced the first British publication of a military band arrangement, which was received with such great enthusiasm, that the firm Boosey & Co. provided the funds to establish 'Boos\u00e9's Military Journal'.\n\nThe number of musicians in the Royal Artillery Band had risen to over seventy, by 1856, and by 1890, there were over a hundred performers. In 1856, the [[Duke of Cambridge]] proposed the acquisition of [[Kneller Hall]], at Whitton, near [[Twickenham]], for the permanent use of training Army musicians. Approval was received from all commanding officers, by way of a circular, on 4 December, and the first music class was scheduled to take place on 1 January 1857. The Royal Military School of Music was initially supported well by the majority of military bands, but with only four pupils to represent the Household Cavalry and Foot Guards.  However, both the Royal Artillery, and Royal Engineers Bands continued to train their musicians exclusively at the Royal Artillery Junior Musicians Troop, at Woolwich - a practice that would continue until the 1980s, later also including musicians from the Band of the Royal Signals (The Corps of the Royal Signals developed from the Royal Engineers Signals Unit, and was established in 1920). In 1894 there were a hundred and eighty-eight bands in the British Army, and this rose to a hundred and ninety-eight in 1926. It can be seen that for a small town to host this prestigious band was a big event, such as when [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]] invited the band to open its newly extended [[Central Bandstand, Herne Bay|Central Bandstand]] in 1932.<ref name=\"Town and Around 2013\" >{{cite web|url=http://www.townandaround.co.uk/editorial.php|title=Town & Around|website=Townandaround.co.uk|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref> Over the next sixty-seven years, the number of bands would decline.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Royal Artillery Band was allotted a war station in Yorkshire, where it was responsible for tours in the Northern and Scottish Commands, and  also completed a single tour of Northern Ireland. Towards the end of the war, the Band returned to London to serve the South Eastern Command, where it also provided a small detachment at Watford. There even existed a 'Royal Artillery Travelling Orchestra', which was conducted by the composer Robert Still, to support the main band, by allowing them to concentrate on their regimental and ceremonial engagements. The war years saw many associations between the Band, and fellow Gunner celebrities, such as Max Jaffa, Eric Fenby, Harry Secombe, and Spike Milligan, as well as recordings, and broadcasts with the Orchestra, for Vera Lynn, which it shared with the RAF Concert Orchestra, Mantovani and His Orchestra, and Roland Shaw and His Orchestra. After the war, the Band resumed its enviable position of being the band of choice for the most prestigious of national occasions. One of the most notable occasions took place on 30 November 1954, when the Royal Artillery Band gave a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in honour of their great admirer, Sir Winston Churchill, on his 80th birthday.\n\nAt the height of Queen Victoria's reign, the number of band personnel in the Royal Artillery rose to over one hundred and fifty, including its 'symphony orchestra' of over eighty musicians. The massed bands of the Royal Regiment of Artillery must therefore have been a truly formidable sight, particularly in the company of the [[Royal Artillery Mounted Band]] \"The largest mounted band ever seen\" (reprinted in 1984 in ''The Times''), and the various other minor artillery bands that also existed. By the end of the so-named 'British Empire', its size had reduced, but it continued to grow again, until, in 1977, the band comprised one hundred and twenty musicians, and on special occasions could be seen on parade with the regiment's massed bands - the Royal Artillery Mounted Band (forty-seven strong), and the (forty strong) Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band). In 1980, the Army Board had come to the conclusion that the Royal Artillery Band, the Royal Artillery Mounted Band, and the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band would be required to adopt a wartime role. At that time, there were sixty-eight bands in the Army, and apart from the Royal Artillery bands, all of them fulfilled the traditional wartime role as stretcher bearers. It was decided that in the case of the Royal Artillery bands, the musicians would be trained as drivers, and all three bands quickly ensured that their members were trained and qualified as HGV 2 drivers, with additional experience driving 10-tonne Monarch trucks, during Operation Lionheart, in 1982.\n\nToday's busy schedule includes regular public duties, such as the Changing of The Guard, and investitures at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, as the musicians continue to support Royal Artillery regiments throughout the country, appear at ambassadorial duties worldwide, and play at private engagements (necessary for providing an income towards instrument purchase and repairs, and new music scores and parts). Royal Artillery musicians have performed in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Africa, New Zealand, Hungary, China, Switzerland, Germany, France, Italy, Slovenia, throughout Scandinavia, and the Benelux countries, and more recently in Russia for the 2011 [[Spasskaya Tower Military Music Festival and Tattoo|Moscow Tattoo]]. The military band has also performed on a number of occasions at the Edinburgh Tattoo to a worldwide television audience. Presently, owing to the present size of the Royal Artillery Band, it can no longer simultaneously provide an orchestra and marching band, however, the full orchestra continues to maintain symphonic capabilities. ''[The Royal Artillery Orchestra plays Wagner]:'' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZNh21GuWAo Until recently, and since 1993, the only other band capable of providing a full symphony orchestra, was the Band of the Royal Engineers, at Chatham. Other ensembles currently  provided by the Band include a concert band, a brass quintet, a string quartet and sextett, a jazz quartet, a woodwind quintet, and a contemporary Rock orchestra called 'Voice of the Guns'. The Orchestra appeared in 2011 as 'House Band' at the first revival of the [[Royal Tournament]] (1884 as 'Royal' - 1999) at Earls Court, London. The marching bands taking part were those of the Household Cavalry, the Royal Marines, and the Central Band of the Royal Air Force.\n\nNotably, the Orchestra has toured with various musical celebrities in the recent past, including Nigel Kennedy, Sir Harry Secombe, Anne Shelton, Moira Anderson, Carlos Bonnell, John Ogden, Stephen Isserlis, Hayley Westenra, David Russell, and Semprini, to name a few. There is evidence that the Royal Artillery Orchestra, or musicians from its ranks, are paving the way towards more involvement between military musicians and contemporary artists in a commercial capacity, including, so far, with Stanley Cornfield, and the Strawbs, with [[Rick Wakeman]] (Stanley Cornfield: ''The Seawall'' [CD]; ''The Strawbs 40th Anniversary'' Volume 2 [CD & DVD]). This welcome trend is not however, completely unprecedented, as members of the Royal Artillery Band, and Royal Artillery Mounted Band, augmented the London Symphony Orchestra on their first '[[classic rock]]' album on LP, in 1976. The original gatefold album sleeve includes a photograph of timpanist John Keel in ceremonial dress.\n\nThe founder, director and conductor of the New Sousa Band, [[Keith Brion]] embarked on a series of recordings of the complete works of John Philip Sousa in 2000 on the Naxos Label. The series is expected to reach sixteen volumes, and encompass marches, waltzes, operatic, and concert works, by the finest military bands and orchestras. Volumes 1 to 8 were recorded by the Royal Artillery Band, conducted by Keith Brion.\n\nIn addition to the Royal Artillery Band (\"Band of the Royal Regiment of Artillery\"), there existed the Royal Artillery Band (Mounted Portion), the Royal Horse Artillery Band, the Royal Artillery Mounted Band (Woolwich), The Royal Artillery Mounted Band (Aldershot) [= later, the Royal Artillery Mounted Band], the Royal Garrison Artillery Band, the Royal Artillery (Portsmouth) Band [= the Royal Artillery B.A.O.R Band = later, the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band], the Royal Artillery Mounted Band, and the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band. Of these, the Royal Artillery Mounted Band (\"...the largest mounted band ever seen\", according to The Times, in June 1984) existed as auxiliary bands, and minor staff bands, together with the Royal Artillery Band (Woolwich) until the Mounted Band was disbanded in 1984, and the Alanbrooke Band in 1993. These two bands had, for a number of years, alternately filled the \"B.A.O.R.\" (British Army of the Rhine) post, at West Riding Barracks, Dortmund, until the withdrawal of the Regiment from there. The changeover occurred every five years, and the band returning to the United Kingdom, was likewise stationed for five years at Larkhill, Wiltshire. On occasion, these three bands would unite, as 'massed bands', of up to 197 performers, and more, if the massed bands comprised these with the Territorial Army's Artillery bands, and the Band of the Honourable Artillery Company, such as on Horseguards Parade in Whitehall. The three regular bands also appeared on two separate years as massed bands at the Edinburgh Tattoo.\n\nOn February 9th, 2014, The Royal Artillery Band (Woolwich) paraded for the last time, on Gordon Square, at Woolwich, in London, in preparation for the move of the Royal Regiment of Artillery to its new headquarters at Larkhill, in Wiltshire. However, the Band was relocated to Tidworth, in Hampshire, close by. The now Royal Artillery (Tidworth) Band continued to serve in Tidworth through further cuts and changes to army music, which included a transformation from 'military band' (i.e. with woodwind, brass and percussion instruments) to a brass band, and eventual talk of the brass band being reduced further to a quintet. By early October, 2019, it was announced by the Corps of Army Music (CAMus), that band would be absolved, by merging its existing musicians with those of two other bands, to form a new divisional army band in Tidworth.\n\n==Uniforms==\n\nThe present uniform of the band was created for the massed bands of the Royal Regiment of Artillery for the official birthday parade for Her Majesty the Queen, on Horse Guards Parade, in June 1986. The tunic replaced the No. 1 Dress Jacket, and was quilt-lined. More elaborate gold braiding was added, with emphasis on rank of the wearer. Patent leather boots were worn by the 'other ranks' for the first time. As the famous Royal Artillery Mounted Band had been disbanded in 1984, the only other regular Army band to appear on that parade, was the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band (disbanded in 1993). From the Territorial Army, the Regimental Band of the Honourable Artillery Company contributed to the massed Artillery bands on that occasion.\n\nThe Royal Artillery musicians' uniforms are based on the officers' pattern ceremonial uniforms of the past. From its uniform are derived (in some cases almost identically) the uniforms of the bands of the [[Royal Canadian Artillery]], the [[Royal Australian Artillery]], the [[Royal New Zealand Artillery]], and the [[Royal Netherlands Army Artillery]] (indeed the latter even have their equivalent of the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery). Slight differences are obviously evident between the nations, for example, the [[Royal Canadian Artillery Band]] wear white plumes, and do not wear spurs. The Royal Artillery Busby (based on the standard Hussars-pattern head dress) was also adopted by the Corps of Royal Engineers and the Royal Corps Signals, from the Royal Engineers, came the unusual busby as worn by the Royal Air Force Music Service until 2011.\n\n==Ceremonial dress==\n\n===Head dress===\nRHA officers' pattern sealskin (formerly bearskin) [[Busby (military headdress)|busby]] (not to be confused with the [[bearskin cap]], as worn by soldiers in the guards, and infantry), with tall white plume (ostrich feathers) attached to ferrule to the top of the front. Lanyard looped around cap. Red busby bag apparently, during the Napoleonic period, the bag could contain dried fruit (raisins) for sustenance when times were hard. It is also said that the other ranks' horse hair plumes were used in place of a shaving brush. Black leather chin strap faced with brass links. Only worn by King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery officers, and Royal Artillery directors of music.\n\n===Tunic===\nRA officers'-pattern ceremonial tunic (worn only by Directors of Music) in navy blue felt, quilt lined. Standing collar, fastened with hooks, and cuffs in scarlet felt, with scarlet piping to front button-hole edge. Ornate edging, and 'Austrian knots' in 18K gold twine braide. RA officers'-pattern bomb badges sewn onto collar. Gold epaulettes. Worn on the right arm is the unique Royal Artillery musician pattern lyre, in 18K gold wire on a black felt background. All other musicians in the British Army wear the standard bandsman pattern lyre, with the exception of musicians from The Household Division who do not wear a lyre on their uniforms.\n\n===Accessories===\n;Crossbelt\nLeather, covered with 18K gold panel and braiding, attached to which is an RA officers'-pattern embroidered pouch at rear.\n\n;Waistbelt and swordbelt with sling\nIn matching pattern to the crossbelt (above).\n\n;Trousers\nNavy blue cavalry-pattern tight-fitting cavalry-style pantaloons, with wide RA stripe in scarlet felt sewn onto outside of each leg. Leather straps with buckles are attached to the bottoms of the legs, which fasten under the arch of the boots.\n\n;Footwear\nCavalry officers'-pattern George boots in black patent leather, with box fittings in heels, for detachable silver spurs. Boots are secured by leather straps attached to hose.\n\n==Other ranks==\n\n===Ceremonial dress===\n;Head dress\nOther Ranks: RA sealskin [sable] busby (often artificial nowadays), with six-inch scarlet plume (horse hair) slotted into brass plume holder, in the form of a grenade, with the old-pattern RFA cap badge depicted on the 'bomb'. The plume (formerly scarlet cut-feathers) is held closed by a brass ring (a thicker ring is used on the Drum Major's headdress). No lanyard attached to cap. Red busby bag (as above). Black leather chin strap, faced with brass links. A similar busby is worn by the musicians of the Royal Engineers, and Royal Signals bands, with busby bags in their own Corps' colours, with the plume mounted in a similar plume holder to the side of the cap.  The Bandmaster's busby is similar to that worn by the Director of Music, but the white plume is smaller. At various times during the Band's history, other forms of head dress were worn, according to fashion.  These included the bearskin cap (similar to that worn by Guardsmen), the shako, and the pith helmet (identical in shape to the Victorian police helmet). Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, the RA No. 1 Dress peaked cap was worn as the sole form of ceremonial head dress. Unlike in all other bands, the Royal Artillery Band has always included a bandmaster as assistant to the Director of Music.  Since the reorganization of bands, and the foundation of the Corps of Army Music, a bandmaster has been appointed to each band in the standard roll of Training Officer / Musician.\n\n;Tunic\nBandsman-pattern navy blue felt tunic, quilt lined. Standing collar, fastened with hooks, and cuffs in scarlet felt, with scarlet piping to front button-hole edge. Ornate edging (with emphasis on rank held reflected in gauge), and 'Austrian knots' in 18K gold twine braide (with emphasis on rank held reflected in gauge). Other ranks'-pattern RA bomb badges (gold twine) sewn onto collar. Worn on the right arm is the unique RA Musician lyre badge, in 18K gold twine on black felt (all other British army musicians wear the standard Army bandsman-pattern lyre badge).\n\n===Accessories===\n;Crossbelt\nLeather, covered with 18K gold panel and braiding, attached to which is a cavalry standard-pattern pouch at rear, onto which is mounted a brass RA gun badge. Depending on the instrument played, a crossbelt may cause damage to the instrument, or be restrictive to movement.  Therefore, not all musicians wear a crossbelt. Similarly, certain musicians will be seen to wear a protective bib, or apron, normally in a complementary colour to their individual band uniform.\n\nThe purpose of the crossbelt pouch was so that an officer or senior rank could post an important message into the courier's pouch, by unhooking the leather tab, inserting the note, then securing the flap, in the briefest possible time.  The courier would then ride off at speed to deliver it. In some bands - a tradition still held by the bands of the footguards, larger pouches were used to store march cards (cards measuring approximately 180&nbsp;mm \u00d7 130&nbsp;mm on which the individual instrumental sheet-music parts are pasted). The march cards are held, to enable the player to read his part, in a heavy duty clip (known as a 'lyre') which is attached to his instrument. At the back of the lyre, but facing forward, is placed the 'backing card', to hide the music from the view of the public. The backing card normally shows the 'cap badge' of the regiment or corps.\n\n;Swordbelt\nIn matching pattern to the crossbelt (above).\n\n;Band sword\nA unique-pattern short sword hooked onto the swordbelt. The hook protrudes through the tunic, allowing the sword to hang visibly. Only worn by the Royal Artillery Band. The sword has never been worn by other Royal Artillery bands. The Bandmaster, Drum Major, and Band Sergeant Major carry the standard British Army sword, as worn by warrant officers.\n\n;Trousers\nNavy blue cavalry-pattern tight-fitting cavalry-style pantaloons, with wide RA stripe in scarlet felt sewn onto outside of each leg. Leather straps with buckles are attached to the bottoms of the legs, which fasten under the arch of the boots.\n\n;Footwear\nCavalry-pattern George boots in black leather (nowadays patent leather), with silver spurs screwed into the heels of boots. Boots are secured by leather straps attached to hose.\n\n==Drum major==\n[[File:The Royal Artillery Band (16748454504).jpg|thumb|The band's drum  major leading a parade.]]\nThe drum major, as the figurehead, and leader of the marching band, historically always wore a more flamboyant uniform to emphasize his special status. Today, in the Royal Artillery, this is shown by the amount of gold braid and facings on his uniform, an elaborately decorated crossbelt, and a heavier plume ring, holding closed a taller scarlet cut-feather plume. He carries a mace, which is used to signal his commands to the musicians, in conjunction with vocal commands as required.  The signals are closely observed by the bass drummer, who then administers a drum signal which is audible to every musician.  This is necessary, because the musicians must concentrate on reading from their [sheet music] parts. There was a period when the RA Drum Majors wore, contrary to the rest of the Band, a tall bearskin cap (similar to that worn by the Guards regiments), with a plume rising up one side of the cap, and draped round the crown, and down the other side.\n\nFollowing the Drum Major's command a mace signal indicates to the drummers (bass and side drums) when to commence the drum rolls. In the tradition of most regiments, Royal Artillery troops step off after two sets of three-pace drum rolls are sounded, in quick march time. Guards regiments traditionally step off after one set of five-pace rolls.  When the Royal Artillery Band appears on parade at the same time as troops and bands from the Guards and other regiments, a seven-pace drum roll is sometimes used to differentiate between themselves, and all other bands, with the Royal Artillery taking precedence. With the exception of the Guards' five-pace roll, which equals six beats, all other combinations of rolls consist of eight beats (or two bars in quadruple time).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armyuniforms/britishartillery/rauniform.htm|title=The Royal Artillery|publisher=The British Empire|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Master Musicians, Band Masters, Directors Of Music (1762\u20131994)==\n\nIn 1994 the Royal Artillery Band and Orchestra were absorbed in the new Corps of Army Music, which meant that, as with all the bands in the Corps, its musicians could be borrowed by other bands, or be posted to other bands as the need arose.  Likewise, musicians from other bands could find themselves playing in the Royal Artillery Band. Effectively, this spelt the end of individuality of sound of all bands, and for this reason, only directors of music, and bandmasters from the original Royal Artillery Band are below.\n* ''1762:'' 'Officially recognized' band is founded by Lieutenant-Colonel W. Phillips at Minden\n* ''1771\u20131774:'' Anthony Rocca is appointed Master-Musician, or Band Master ''(not to be confused with the later-designated role of 'Bandmaster' at Warrant Officer Class 1 level)''\n* ''1774\u20131777:'' Georg K\u00fchler, Master-Musician ''(who later styled himself as 'George Kealer')''\n* ''1777\u20131802:'' Friederich Wiele, Master\n* ''1802\u20131805:'' Herr G.

Zavertal received the following honours: the Jubillee Medal; the Royal Victorian Order; Cavaliere of the Crown of Italy; Order of the Redeemer (from the King of Greece); Knight Commander Royal Order of Takoya (Serbia), the Commander's Star of the Osmanieh (from the Sultan of Turkey), Society of St. Cecilia of Rome (elected member) and the Saxe-Coburg- Ernestine Order of Art and Science''\n\n''A conductor of international fame.  Prior to his appointment, the Duke of Cambridge, 'Commanding-in-Chief' had issued a Horse Guards letter to every commanding officer praising Kneller Hall's work in producing British bandmaster for the Army: ''\"I am gratified at finding that the system of training regimental musicians for promotion to the situation of Bandmaster - to the exclusion of civilians and foreigners - has worked so well...\"'' The appointment of Zavertal was in fact permitted by the Duke of Cambridge, who was not actually 'Commanding-in-Chief', but rather 'Colonel-in-Chief'. For the first time, we see the term 'Bandmaster' applied to the Master of the Band, which is similar to the current appointment in appearance only. Today, 'bandmaster' is an auxiliary position, held by a Warrant Officer, Class 1''.\n\n''1907\u20131936:'' Major Edward C.

An ex-director of music, of both the Royal Artillery Mounted Band, and the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band (the only director of music to hold the distinction of having served in all three bands of the Royal Regiment), who is widely regarded as one of the finest conductors to have served in the British Army.''\n\n''1988\u20131992:'' Major Clarence Roberts Collier Garrity\n\n''Ex-Director of Music, the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band.

Among the performers of the band are the instrumental section leaders, whose job it is, to ensure a cohesive style of playing within their own sections, and where applicable, to be able to play solos.  In an orchestra, there is the addition of the Leader (Principal First Violin), who on occasion must be able to direct the orchestra (from the violin), or conduct. An unusual aspect of military bands is that, by necessity, a leader or section leader is selected for being the best exponent on his chosen instrument. The situation arises therefore, on a day-to-day basis, that an ensemble, band, or orchestra, must perform under the command of a musician of any rank, notwithstanding the fact that there may be senior-ranking musicians playing within the sections. The musician in charge is also completely responsible in rehearsal. Such a situation is often difficult to comprehend or accept, even from fellow servicemen. However, it should be remembered, that the musician in charge is representing the Director of Music. Senior-ranking members of the band, although in this case under the command of the lower rank, nevertheless remain at all times in control, in such areas as attitude, discipline, and presentation, leaving artistic control, and interpretation firmly in the hands of the leading musician.\n\n==Formation of The Corps of Army Music (1994)==\nOn 13 August 1994 the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] signed a warrant to allow the formation of the Corps of Army Music. It was her will and pleasure that all officers who were directors of music in the various corps and regiments, and all army musicians should transfer to the Corps of Army Music. The transfer took place on 1 September 1994. From that time, all bands were accorded a director of music, and a bandmaster. The latter's role being concomitant with that of Training Officer. The 'Private' rank of 'Bandsman' was abolished, in favour of 'Musician' of the former staff bands. Individual bands continue to wear the uniforms and cap badges of the regiments and corps which they support, but their personnel all belong to the same corps.\n\nThe Royal Artillery Band does not take a direct role in the [[Trooping the Colour]] parade. The Trooping the Colour as seen on [[Horse Guards Parade]] is a ceremony, which involves the whole of the [[Household Division]], the [[Household Cavalry]], and nowadays, also the [[King's Troop]] (as head of Her Majesty's Household Troops). While other regiments and corps hold similar trooping-the-colour ceremonies, that of the Guards is held annually to celebrate the official birthday of Her Majesty the Queen. The Royal Artillery Band is nevertheless always very much in evidence on the day of the Trooping the Colour, by taking part in the Royal Birthday gun salute given by the King's Troop in [[Hyde Park]].\n\nThe total number of bands remaining after 'Options for Change' was 29. By 2013, there were 23.\n\n===State bands===\nThe Royal Artillery Band is the oldest band in the British Army, but was the last regular army band to be accorded 'state band' status, a status which it lost on 9 February 2014 when both the Royal Regiment and its band vacated Woolwich Barracks. However, the Band had held the status of a state band twice before, during the reigns of King George II/King George III, and Queen Victoria. Notwithstanding, the Royal Artillery Band was often in demand for important state and public duties, and to represent the nation. It was the favourite band of King George IV, the Duchess of Kent (Queen Victoria's mother), Queen Victoria, and Sir Winston Churchill. The number of Regular Army State Bands, was further reduced on 1 September 2014, when The [[Musical ensemble|Band]] of the [[Life Guards (United Kingdom)|Life Guards]] and The Band of The [[Blues and Royals]] were joined to form The Band of The [[Household Cavalry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/music/24533.aspx|title=The British Army - History|website=Army.mod.uk|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref> At the same time the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)]] Bands of the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] and the [[Royal Yeomanry]] were both granted State Band status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://3daysinlondon.info/2015/08/04/a-band-concert-at-guildhall/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032019/http://3daysinlondon.info/2015/08/04/a-band-concert-at-guildhall/ |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Regimental music==\n===British Grenadiers March===\nThe tune '[[The British Grenadiers]]' was first adopted for use as a regimental march by the Honourable Artillery Company (the oldest British regiment), during the [[English Civil War]].  Although grenades were first launched by artillerymen in 1643, the term 'grenade' was only first documented in 1688.  Originally a Dutch song, the melody now known as 'The British Grenadiers' was brought to England by [[King William III of the Netherlands]].  Soon after the melody became popular in these islands, a version of it, titled 'The New Bath' appeared in a '17th Century Dance Book' by Playford.  In the Netherlands, it is known as 'De jonge prins van Friesland' ('The Young Friesian Prince') after Prince Johann Willem Friso.  In 1716, the march became the regimental quick march of the Royal Artillery, and was known as the 'Royal Artillery Grenadiers March', but was not declared 'official' until 1882.  It first appeared in print, as 'The British Grenadiers' in 1740.\n\nDuring the [[War of Spanish Succession]] (1702-1713) a text was added, which remains to this day in publications of the tune as a British folk song.\n\nThe 'British Grenadiers' later became the regimental march of both the Grenadier Guards, and the Royal Fusiliers (the Grenadier Guards were formed after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815). Notwithstanding the formation of the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) in 1685, the Grenade (a small incendiary device originating during the Eastern Roman 'Byzantine' Empire) is a weapon of artillery, and as such was always manufactured and kept in the royal arsenals of King Henry VIII at the Tower of London, and at Chatham, and Woolwich - both in the county of Kent, until the Fusilier regiments, and later the Foot Guards, each adopted them as standard weaponry. Therefore, the original grenadiers, were in fact artillerymen.\n\nAs a regimental quick march, the short duration of the melody has always resulted in unwanted repetition, but in 1983, Lieutenant-Colonel Stanley Patch (then Director of Music) provided a suitable solution, by adding the ''Trio'' section of another favourite artillery march, 'The Voice of The Guns', composed by Major F.J. Ricketts under the pseudonym '[[Kenneth J. Alford]]'. The popularity of the tune 'The British Grenadiers' during the Napoleonic Wars rivalled that of its contemporary '[[Lilliburlero]]', and subsequently led to its adoption by all regiments who wear as their cap or collar badges, the symbol of the grenade.\n\n===The Trayne Of Artillery's Grenadiers March===\nPrior to the Royal Artillery adopting 'The British Grenadiers' in 1716 as its regimental quick march, 'The Train of Artillery' (as it is now known) was the rather elegant (medium-) original quick march of the royal regiment. The march later appeared in print for the first time, published by Thompson & Son, London, in 'The Compleat Tutor for the Fife', circa 1760. The first ''grenadiers'', or grenade-throwers were artillery soldiers.\n\nThe original military march is scored for eight players, comprising 2 piccolos (in two-part counterpoint), 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, and 2 drums. At the time, the two piccolos were played by the two clarinetists of the band, who alternated between clarinet and piccolo as required. Two updated recordings exist by the Royal Artillery - one conducted by its director of music Major Robert Quinn (in 18th-century style, albeit for full modern military band), and a contemporary version, arranged and conducted by Lt Colonel Malcom Torrent.\n\n===The Minden Rose===\nThe origins of this march are obscure.  The piece was first documented as 'Mindener-Marsch', and possibly came into being during the battle of Minden.\nIn style, it is a ceremonial 'Reiter-Marsch', or cavalry march, and probably adapted to accompany the horse-drawn guns of the Artillery, from a German regional folk song.\n\n===The Marquess Of Granby's March===\nThe [[Marquess of Granby]] (the Earl of Rutland) was Master-General of the Regiment (1763\u20131772), and was preceded by General Ligonier (1759\u20131763) after whom, a now forgotten slow march 'General Ligonier's March' was named. The appointment 'Master-General' is nowadays known as 'Master Gunner, St. James's Park' (not to be confused with 'Master Gunner', which is a Warrant Officer special skills appointment).\n\n===The Royal Artillery Slow March===\nThe Royal Artillery Slow March was composed by Princess Louisa Victoria, Duchess of Kent, and mother of Queen Victoria (herself \"a most competent musician\"), circa 1836, and first used in 1843.  It is also the regimental walk march of the Royal Horse Artillery, and is also used (but in a different version) by the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. Until 1843, when the first 'regimental marches' were officially chosen (at the suggestion of George Mackenzie, Master of the Royal Artillery Band), regiments became accustomed to those marches that were played regularly for representation and recognition purposes, which had usually been composed by the current masters of their bands. With each change of master, marches lapsed into disuse, to be replaced by newer ones.\n\n===Regimental Trot 'The Keel Row'===\nThe Royal Horse Artillery (and cavalry regiments) adopted this Tyneside air in 1903 on its publication by the War Office.\nThis march is one example of the Regiment's intention to cater for all of its troops, drawn, as they were, from all regions of the United Kingdom. By comparison, almost all other regiments have traditionally recruited locally (e.g. the Devon & Dorset Regiment, the Durham Light Infantry, the Royal Hampshire Regiment, the Green Howards, etc.).\n\n===Regimental Canter 'Bonnie Dundee'===\nThe melody of 'Bonnie Dundee' dates back to the [[battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314. By 1600 the melody was certainly known all over Scotland and England.  It appears in 'The Beggar's Opera' and was used by Robert Burns. It is also associated with a poem by Sir Walter Scott, which commemorates the Viscount of Dundee's bravery in the 1689 rebellion. It is believed that the title of this melody refers to the Viscount of Dundee, rather than to the jute-, and marmalade-producing city of the same name.\n\n===Fanfare 'The Royal Regiment'===\nThe composer [[Frederic Curzon]] (1899, London \u2013 1973, Bournemouth) was at one time, a Gunner officer. Curzon wrote this fanfare for the opening of the Royal Artillery Association Rally in 1952. Its masterful use of both the RA's and RHA's 'Trumpet Call' typify the composer's penchant for incorporating melodies that he associated with his personal experiences in life.\n\nOf his many lasting compositions, perhaps the most perennial are the suites \"Robin Hood\", \"In Malaga\", \"Dance Of An Ostracized Imp\", \"Galavant\", and \"The Boulevardier\", all of which continue to be performed, and recorded by orchestras worldwide. Frederic Curzon frequently performed as an unofficial band member at the Royal Artillery Officers Mess in Woolwich, playing violin, cello, piano, and organ. He was an honorary member of the Royal Artillery Band.\n\nOther notable composers who wrote specially for the Royal Artillery Band include Zavertal, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, C P E Bach, and Sir Arthur Bliss, Master of the Queen's Music.\n\n===The 'Eton Boating Song'===\nThe 'Eton Boating Song' was composed in 1863 by one Captain Algernon Drummond, and transcribed by T. L. Mitchell, and the piano accompaniment was arranged by Evelyn Wodehouse. The words of [[Kipling]]'s 'Screw Guns' from his 'Barrack Room Ballads' are well known to RA officers and soldiers.  Screw guns were so-named, because the barrels could be broken down into pieces, to be carried on mules in mountainous regions. They were last used during the Second World War, by RA Mountain Regiments in the campaign in Italy.  The piece was arranged for orchestra, with a transcribed edition for military band, by Karl Kaps, as an 'English' (='slow', with 3 definite beats to the bar) waltz, and published by B. Feldman & Co. London.\n\n== First performances & Cinema ==\n* H\u00c4NDEL: 'Music For The Royal Fireworks'* (orchestra comprising musicians from the Royal Artillery, and from the Royal Band) (World Premiere)\n* H\u00c4NDEL: 'Water Music'* (orchestra comprising musicians from the Royal Artillery, and from the Royal Band) (World Premiere)\n* DVO\u0158\u00c1K: Symphony No. 2 (British premiere to a private, invited audience at Woowich, London)\n* DVO\u0158\u00c1K: 'A Symphony From The New World' (British premiere to a private, invited audience at Woowich, London)\n* WAGNER: Overture, and orchestral music from 'Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg' (British Premiere)\n* SMETANA: Overture to 'Prodana Nevesta' ('The Bartered Bride') (British Premiere)\n\n''*Royal Band of King George II/strings and kettledrums of the Artillery Band''\n\n'''CINEMA'''\n\nThis list includes the most recent appearances by the Royal Artillery Band in films (movies), and films in which recordings by the Royal Artillery Band have been included on the soundtracks.

The decks of cards, along with the user's statistics, are stored in the open [[SQLite]] format.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Notes===\nCards are generated from information stored as \"notes\". Notes are analogous to database entries and can have an arbitrary number of fields. For example, with respect to learning a language, a note may have the following fields and example entries:\n* Field 1: Expression in target language \u2013 {{lang|fr|\"g\u00e2teau\"}}\n* Field 2: Pronunciation \u2013 [sound file with the word {{lang|fr|\"g\u00e2teau\"}} pronounced]\n* Field 3: Meaning of expression in familiar language \u2013 \"cake\"\nThis example illustrates what some programs call a [[three-sided flashcard]], but Anki's model is more general and allows any number of fields to be combined in various cards.\n\nThe user can design cards that test the information contained in each note. One card may have a question (expression) and an answer (pronunciation, meaning).\n\nBy keeping the separate cards linked to the same fact, spelling mistakes can be adjusted against all cards at the same time and Anki can ensure that related cards are not shown in too short a spacing.\n\nA special note type allows for generation of [[cloze deletion]] cards (in Anki 1.2.x, those were ordinary cards with cloze markup added using a tool in the fact editor).\n\n===Syncing===\nAnki supports synchronization with a free (but proprietary) online server called AnkiWeb.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ankiweb.net|title=Anki - friendly, intelligent flashcards|work=ankiweb.net}}</ref> This allows users to keep decks synchronized across multiple computers, and to study online or on a cell phone.\n\nThere is a third-party open source ([[Affero General Public License|AGPLv3]]) AnkiServer software which users can run on their own local computers or servers, though it is not compatible with recent Anki versions. It also provides a RESTful API for manipulating Anki collections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/dsnopek/anki-sync-server|title=dsnopek/anki-sync-server|work=GitHub|date=24 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Japanese and Chinese reading generation===\nAnki can automatically fill in the reading of Japanese and Chinese text.

With AnkiDroid it is possible to have the flashcards read in several languages using [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] (TTS). If a language does not exist in the Android TTS engine (e.g. Russian in the Android version Ice Cream Sandwich), a different TTS engine  such as SVOX TTS Classic can be used.\n\n==History==\nThe oldest mention of Anki that the developer, Damien Elmes, could find in 2011 was dated 5 October 2006<!-- (which may be <span title=\"* initial import from forcer's last version\">the first entry in the ChangeLog file for an [[Emacs]]-based spaced repetition program, [http://ichi2.net/flashcard/index.html Flashcard])-->, which was thus declared Anki's birthdate.<ref>[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/anki-users/M8mDFN7-H-I/discussion Happy birthday, Anki!], a thread started by Damien Elmes in the ankisrs Google Group on 5 October 2011.</ref>\n\nIn 2010, [[Roger Craig (Jeopardy! contestant)|Roger Craig]] obtained the then-all-time record for single-day winnings on the [[Game Show|quiz show]] ''[[Jeopardy!]]''<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|title=Record Set On 'Jeopardy!'|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|newspaper=The New York Times|date=15 September 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/arts/television/16arts-RECORDSETONJ_BRF.html?_r=1|accessdate=20 September 2010}}</ref> after using Anki to memorize a vast number of facts.<ref name=\"Baker 2011\">{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Stephen|author-link=Stephen L.

A study in 2015 at [[Washington University School of Medicine]] found that 31% of students who responded to a medical education survey reported using Anki as a study resource. The same study found a positive relationship between the number of unique Anki cards studied and USMLE Step 1 scores in a multi-variate analysis.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Deng|first=Francis|last2=Gluckstein|first2=Jeffrey A.|last3=Larsen|first3=Douglas P.|date=1 December 2015|title=Student-directed retrieval practice is a predictor of medical licensing examination performance|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s40037-015-0220-x|journal=Perspectives on Medical Education|language=en|volume=4|issue=6|pages=308\u2013313|doi=10.1007/s40037-015-0220-x|issn=2212-277X|pmc=4673073|pmid=26498443}}</ref> Some third-party resources, such as Boards and Beyond, have Anki decks based on them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/8rdcqz/lightyear_a_boards_and_beyond_based_step_1_anki/|title=r/medicalschoolanki - LIGHTYEAR: A Boards and Beyond based STEP 1 Anki deck (~22.5k cards)|website=reddit|language=en-US|access-date=26 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boardsbeyond.com/how-to-use-boards-and-beyond|title=Boards and Beyond|last=Ryan|first=Jason|date=|website=Boards and Beyond|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Copera Inc.'s Anki for Palm OS==\nAn unrelated flashcard program called Anki for Palm OS<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eichert.com/copera.com/anki.com/index.html|title=About Anki for Palm OS|work=Mirror of old anki.com website}}</ref> was created by Copera, Inc.

The family belongs to an Oppressed-caste community (Kaikadi) and earns its living by doing menial jobs. Owing to the caste-ridden power structure of the village society, the boy's father has a fearful and submissive personality which is exploited by the upper-caste villagers.\n\nJabya is disillusioned by the predicament of his family and shows interest in school where he has also fallen in one-sided love with a forward caste girl named Shalini (nickname: Shalu) (Rajeshwari Kharat) who he has never talked to but tries desperately to get her to notice him.\n\nThe plot opens with Jabya and his school friend Pirya (Suraj Pawar) armed with a slingshot trying to catch a bird (the Black Sparrow) in the wilderness. However, the bird call that punctuates the film is that of the Red Wattled Lapwing (Titawi), which is supposed to bring bad luck. The black sparrow, with its distinctive forked tail, and the call of the red wattled lapwing occur repeatedly throughout the film. The duo keep trying to catch the bird in the entire film for an unknown reason which is later explained in the film. According to a local legend, it is believed that when the ash obtained by burning the black sparrow is sprinkled on someone, it hypnotizes them to fall in love with the person sprinkling it.\n\nJabya also befriends a bicycle mechanic named Chankya (Nagraj Manjule) who sees his young self in the boy. Chankya had once married a girl but she was soon forcefully taken away by her brother and left him beaten very badly. Since then he has renounced family life and taken up refuge in spirituality, mysticism and liquor. Jabya seeks support from Chankya in his quest to obtain his love, which Chankya readily extends. Perhaps the idea of sprinkling the ash of black sparrow on Shalu is suggested to Jabya by Chankya himself. The idea, however, is executed only in Jabya's dream.\n\nBack in the village, Jabya's family members comply as they are exploited and dehumanized by the villagers over and over again. In the film's climax, Jabya finally acknowledges the existence of the kingdom and the boundaries of its residents (castes). He realises that he himself is the odd one out who is trying to assimilate in a world that prefers to stay within their own boundaries (a form of security).\n\nHe understands that his own boundaries have collapsed in his attempts to assimilate with the other castes and has thus become vulnerable to their attacks. Reaching self-awareness for the first time in his life, he suddenly explodes in rage and grabs a rock and throws it at his oppressors, thus re-establishing his boundary. His personal quest to assimilate with the others now broken by himself.\n\n==Cast==\n* Somnath Awghade as Jambuwant Kachru Mane (Jabya)\n* Suraj Pawar as a Piraji (Pirya)\n* Chhaya Kadam as Nani\n* [[Kishor Kadam]] as a Kachru Mane (Nana)\n* [[Rajeshwari Kharat]] as Shalu\n* Bhushan Manjule as Dada Patil\n* [[Nagraj Manjule]] as a Chankya (Chankeshwar Sathe)\n* Sohail Shaikh as Sangram\n* Sanjay Chaudhri as Teacher\n* Vikas Pandurang Patil as a Navhi\n* Prashant Kamble\n* Jyoti Subhash\n* Suhas Sirsat\n* Moinuddin Inamdar as a principal\n* Pooja Dolas as a Vedant's mother\n* Shruti Awate as a Rani\n* Sakshi Vyavhare as a Dhurpa\n* Pravin Tarde as a Sarpanch\n* Suresh Vishwakarma\n\n==Crew==\n*Story, screenplay, dialogues & direction \u2013 Nagraj Manjule\n*Producers \u2013 Nilesh Navlakha and [[Vivek Kajaria]]\n*Executive producer \u2013 Vivek Wagh\n*Costume designers \u2013 Gargee Kulkarni and Priyanka Dubey\n*Art director \u2013 Santosh Sankhad\n*Sound design \u2013 Nimish Chheda\n*Chief assistant director \u2013 Gargee Kulkarni and Kutub Inamdar\n*Assistant editor \u2013 Kutub Inamdar\n*On location sound \u2013 Christopher Robleto Harvey\n\n==Production and release==\nThe film was praised at the Mumbai International Film Festival and was subsequently picked up by Zee Entertainment for distribution rights in Maharashtra in 125 to 150 screens.

The family belongs to an Oppressed-caste community (Kaikadi) and earns its living by doing menial jobs. Owing to the caste-ridden power structure of the village society, the boy's father has a fearful and submissive personality which is exploited by the upper-caste villagers.\n\nJabya is disillusioned by the predicament of his family and shows interest in school where he has also fallen in one-sided love with a forward caste girl named Shalini (nickname: Shalu) (Rajeshwari Kharat) who he has never talked to but tries desperately to get her to notice him.\n\nThe plot opens with Jabya and his school friend Pirya (Suraj Pawar) armed with a slingshot trying to catch a bird (the Black Sparrow) in the wilderness. However, the bird call that punctuates the film is that of the Red Wattled Lapwing (Titawi), which is supposed to bring bad luck. The black sparrow, with its distinctive forked tail, and the call of the red wattled lapwing occur repeatedly throughout the film. The duo keep trying to catch the bird in the entire film for an unknown reason which is later explained in the film. According to a local legend, it is believed that when the ash obtained by burning the black sparrow is sprinkled on someone, it hypnotizes them to fall in love with the person sprinkling it.\n\nJabya also befriends a bicycle mechanic named Chankya (Nagraj Manjule) who sees his young self in the boy. Chankya had once gotten married to a girl but she was soon forcefully taken away by her brother and left him beaten very badly. Since then he has renounced family life and taken up refuge in spirituality, mysticism and liquor. Jabya seeks support from Chankya in his quest to obtain his love, which Chankya readily extends. Perhaps the idea of sprinkling the ash of black sparrow on Shalu is suggested to Jabya by Chankya himself. The idea, however, is executed only in Jabya's dream.\n\nBack in the village, Jabya's family members comply as they are exploited and dehumanized by the villagers over and over again. In the film's climax, Jabya finally acknowledges the existence of the kingdom and the boundaries of its residents(castes). He realises that he himself is the odd one out who is trying to assimilate in a world that prefers to stay within their own boundaries(a form of security).\n\nHe understands that his own boundaries have collapsed in his attempts to assimilate with the other castes and has thus become vulnerable to their attacks. Reaching self-awareness for the first time in his life, he suddenly explodes in rage and grabs a rock and throws it at his oppressors, thus re-establishing his boundary. His personal quest to assimilate with the others now broken by himself.\n\n==Cast==\n* Somnath Awghade as Jambuwant Kachru Mane (Jabya)\n* Suraj Pawar as a Piraji (Pirya)\n* Chhaya Kadam as Nani\n* [[Kishor Kadam]] as a Kachru Mane (Nana)\n* [[Rajeshwari Kharat]] as Shalu\n* Bhushan Manjule as Dada Patil\n* [[Nagraj Manjule]] as a Chankya (Chankeshwar Sathe)\n* Sohail Shaikh as Sangram\n* Sanjay Chaudhri as Teacher\n* Vikas Pandurang Patil as a Navhi\n* Prashant Kamble\n* Jyoti Subhash\n* Suhas Sirsat\n* Moinuddin Inamdar as a principal\n* Pooja Dolas as a Vedant's Mother\n* Shruti Awate as a Rani\n* Sakshi Vyavhare as a Dhurpa\n* Pravin Tarde as a Sarpanch\n* Suresh Vishwakarma\n\n==Crew==\n*Story, screenplay, dialogues & direction \u2013 Nagraj Manjule\n*Producers \u2013 Nilesh Navlakha & [[Vivek Kajaria]]\n*Executive producer \u2013 Vivek Wagh\n*Costume designers \u2013 Gargee Kulkarni and Priyanka Dubey\n*Art director \u2013 Santosh Sankhad\n*Sound design \u2013 Nimish Chheda\n*Chief assistant director \u2013 Gargee Kulkarni and Kutub Inamdar\n*Assistant editor \u2013 Kutub Inamdar\n*On location sound \u2013 Christopher Robleto Harvey\n\n==Production and release==\nThe film was praised at the Mumbai International Film Festival and was subsequently picked up by Zee Entertainment for distribution rights in Maharashtra in 125 to 150 screens.

It was released on November 3, 1958 not long after Cash's departure from [[Sun Records]], and was re-issued in 2002 by [[Sony Music]]'s [[Legacy Recordings|Legacy]] imprint. The re-issue contains six bonus tracks and unedited versions of the songs. [[Legacy Records]] reissued the album in 180 gram vinyl for Record Store Day in November 23, 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.johnnycashonline.com/news/fabulous-johnny-cash-180-gram-vinyl-be-released-record-store-day|title=Johnny Cash - Fabulous Johnny Cash|work=johnnycashonline.com|accessdate=March 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe album features five tracks written by Cash and [[backing vocal]] performances by [[The Jordanaires]] (who at this time were also regulars on [[Elvis Presley]]'s recording sessions for [[RCA Records]]). Overall, even though the album is only 29 minutes in length, it is considered one of Cash's most cohesive pieces. This is largely because his sessions with Columbia were completed over a two-month period. That is greatly reduced when compared to the year by year sessions by Sun Records.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adriandenning.co.uk/cash.html|title=Johnny Cash|work=adriandenning.co.uk|accessdate=March 4, 2015}}</ref> ''The Fabulous Johnny Cash'' was a successful debut on Columbia for Cash as it sold over half a million copies during its initial release.<ref>http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/cas0bio-1</ref> The album was recorded simultaneously with ''[[Hymns by Johnny Cash]]'', released in 1959.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| total_length = 28:28\n\n| title1 = Run Softly, Blue River\n| writer1 = [[Johnny Cash]]\n| length1 = 2:22\n\n| title2 = [[Frankie and Johnny (song)|Frankie's Man, Johnny]]\n| writer2 = Cash\n| length2 = 2:15\n\n| title3 = That's All Over\n| writer3 = [[Dick Glasser]]\n| length3 = 1:52\n\n| title4 = The Troubadour\n| writer4 = [[Cindy Walker]]\n| length4 = 2:15\n\n| title5 = One More Ride\n| writer5 = [[Bob Nolan]]\n| length5 = 1:59\n\n| title6 = That's Enough\n| writer6 = [[Dorothy Love Coates|Dorothy Coates]]\n| length6 = 2:41\n\n| title7 = [[I Still Miss Someone]]\n| writer7 = Cash, Roy Cash\n| length7 = 2:34\n\n| title8 = [[Don't Take Your Guns to Town]]\n| writer8 = Cash\n| length8 = 3:03\n\n| title9 = I'd Rather Die Young\n| writer9 = Beasley Smith, [[Billy Vaughn]], [[Randy Wood (record producer)|Randy Wood]]\n| length9 = 2:29\n\n| title10 = Pickin' Time\n| writer10 = Cash\n| length10 = 1:58\n\n| title11 = Shepherd of My Heart\n| writer11 = [[Jenny Lou Carson]]\n| length11 = 2:10\n\n| title12 = Suppertime\n| writer12 = [[Ira Stanphill]]\n| length12 = 2:50\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Re-issue Bonus Tracks\n| collapsed = yes\n| total_length = 41:22\n\n| title13 = Oh, What a Dream (Take 1) *\n| writer13 = Cash\n| length13 = 2:08\n\n| title14 = Mama's Baby**\n| writer14 = Cash\n| length14 = 2:22\n\n| title15 = Fool's Hall of Fame**\n| writer15 = Jerry Freeman, Danny Wolfe\n| length15 = 2:10\n\n| title16 = I'll Remember You\n| writer16 = Cash\n| length16 = 2:07\n\n| title17 = Cold Shoulder**\n| writer17 = Helene Hudgins\n| length17 = 1:55\n\n| title18 = Walking the Blues**\n| writer18 = Cash, Robert Lunn\n| length18 = 2:12\n}}\n\n\u2217 This song was re-recorded as \"You Dreamer You\" in a different arrangement and released as a single in 1959 (US Country #15), also found as a bonus track on his 1959 album ''[[Songs of Our Soil]]''.<br/>\n\u2217\u2217 These songs remained unissued in the U.S. until 2002\n\n==Personnel==\n'''Musicians'''\n\n*Johnny Cash -

It was released on November 3, 1958 not long after Cash's departure from [[Sun Records]], and was re-issued in 2002 by [[Sony Music]]'s [[Legacy Recordings|Legacy]] imprint. The re-issue contains six bonus tracks and unedited versions of the songs. [[Legacy Records]] reissued the album in 180 gram vinyl for Record Store Day in November 23, 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.johnnycashonline.com/news/fabulous-johnny-cash-180-gram-vinyl-be-released-record-store-day|title=Johnny Cash - Fabulous Johnny Cash|work=johnnycashonline.com|accessdate=March 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe album features five tracks written by Cash and [[backing vocal]] performances by [[The Jordanaires]] (who at this time were also regulars on [[Elvis Presley]]'s recording sessions for [[RCA Records]]). Overall, even though the album is only 29 minutes in length, it is considered one of Cash's most cohesive pieces. This is largely because his sessions with Columbia were completed over a two-month period. That is greatly reduced when compared to the year by year sessions by Sun Records.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adriandenning.co.uk/cash.html|title=Johnny Cash|work=adriandenning.co.uk|accessdate=March 4, 2015}}</ref> ''The Fabulous Johnny Cash'' was a successful debut on Columbia for Cash as it sold over half a million copies during its initial release.<ref>http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/cas0bio-1</ref> The album was recorded simultaneously with ''[[Hymns by Johnny Cash]]'', released in 1959.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| total_length = 28:28\n\n| title1 = Run Softly, Blue River\n| writer1 = [[Johnny Cash]]\n| length1 = 2:22\n\n| title2 = Frankie's Man, Johnny\n| writer2 = Cash\n| length2 = 2:15\n\n| title3 = That's All Over\n| writer3 = [[Dick Glasser]]\n| length3 = 1:52\n\n| title4 = The Troubadour\n| writer4 = [[Cindy Walker]]\n| length4 = 2:15\n\n| title5 = One More Ride\n| writer5 = [[Bob Nolan]]\n| length5 = 1:59\n\n| title6 = That's Enough\n| writer6 = [[Dorothy Love Coates|Dorothy Coates]]\n| length6 = 2:41\n\n| title7 = [[I Still Miss Someone]]\n| writer7 = Cash, Roy Cash\n| length7 = 2:34\n\n| title8 = [[Don't Take Your Guns to Town]]\n| writer8 = Cash\n| length8 = 3:03\n\n| title9 = I'd Rather Die Young\n| writer9 = Beasley Smith, [[Billy Vaughn]], [[Randy Wood (record producer)|Randy Wood]]\n| length9 = 2:29\n\n| title10 = Pickin' Time\n| writer10 = Cash\n| length10 = 1:58\n\n| title11 = Shepherd of My Heart\n| writer11 = [[Jenny Lou Carson]]\n| length11 = 2:10\n\n| title12 = Suppertime\n| writer12 = [[Ira Stanphill]]\n| length12 = 2:50\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Re-issue Bonus Tracks\n| collapsed = yes\n| total_length = 41:22\n\n| title13 = Oh, What a Dream (Take 1) *\n| writer13 = Cash\n| length13 = 2:08\n\n| title14 = Mama's Baby**\n| writer14 = Cash\n| length14 = 2:22\n\n| title15 = Fool's Hall of Fame**\n| writer15 = Jerry Freeman, Danny Wolfe\n| length15 = 2:10\n\n| title16 = I'll Remember You\n| writer16 = Cash\n| length16 = 2:07\n\n| title17 = Cold Shoulder**\n| writer17 = Helene Hudgins\n| length17 = 1:55\n\n| title18 = Walking the Blues**\n| writer18 = Cash, Robert Lunn\n| length18 = 2:12\n}}\n\n\u2217 This song was re-recorded as \"You Dreamer You\" in a different arrangement and released as a single in 1959 (US Country #15), also found as a bonus track on his 1959 album ''[[Songs of Our Soil]]''.<br/>\n\u2217\u2217 These songs remained unissued in the U.S. until 2002\n\n==Personnel==\n'''Musicians'''\n\n*Johnny Cash - [[Guitar]], Vocals, Leader\n*[[Luther Perkins]] - Guitar\n*[[Don Helms]] - Steel Guitar\n*[[Marshall Grant]] - [[Bass guitar|Bass]]\n*[[The Jordanaires]] - Background vocals\n*Marvin Hughes - [[Piano]]\n*[[Buddy Harman]] - [[Drum kit|Drums]] on \"Suppertime,\" \"Oh, What a Dream\" and \"I'll Remember You\"\n*Morris Palmer - Drums\n\n'''Additional personnel'''\n*Al Quaglieri - Producer\n*[[Don Law]] - Producer\n*Billy Altman - Liner Notes\n*[[Don Hunstein]] - Photography\n*Seth Foster - Mastering\n*Mark Wilder - Mastering, Mixing\n*Hal Adams - Cover Photo\n*Stacey Boyle - Tape Research\n*Kay Smith - Tape Research\n*Matt Kelly - Tape Research\n*Geoff Gillette - Sleeve Design\n*Steven Berkowitz - A&R\n*Darren Salmieri - A&R\n*Patti Matheny - A&R\n*Howard Fritzson - Art Direction\n*Nick Shaffran - Series Consultant\n\n==Charts==\n'''Album''' - [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] (North America)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Year\n!align=\"left\"|Chart\n!align=\"left\"|Position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|1958\n|align=\"left\"|Pop Albums\n|align=\"left\"|19\n|-\n|}\n\n'''Singles''' - Billboard (North America)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Year\n!align=\"left\"|Single\n!align=\"left\"|Chart\n!align=\"left\"|Position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|1959\n|align=\"left\"|\"Don't Take Your Guns to Town\"\n|align=\"left\"|Country Singles\n|align=\"left\"|1\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|1959\n|align=\"left\"|\"Don't Take Your Guns to Town\"\n|align=\"left\"|Pop Singles\n|align=\"left\"|32\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|1959\n|align=\"left\"|\"Frankie's Man, Johnny\"\n|align=\"left\"|Country Singles\n|align=\"left\"|9\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|1959\n|align=\"left\"|\"Frankie's Man, Johnny\"\n|align=\"left\"|Pop Singles\n|align=\"left\"|57\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{Johnny Cash|studio}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fabulous Johnny Cash, The}}\n[[Category:Johnny Cash albums]]\n[[Category:1959 albums]]\n[[Category:Columbia Records albums]]\n{{1950s-country-album-stub|Fabulous Johnny Cash, The}}\n", "name_user": "Moscow Connection", "label": "safe", "comment": "wikification", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabulous_Johnny_Cash"}

It is typically written in the formal, [[grammatical|third-person]] language and mailed five to eight weeks before the wedding date.\n\nLike any other invitation, it is the privilege and duty of the host\u2014historically, for younger brides in [[Western culture]], the mother of the bride, on behalf of the bride's family\u2014to issue invitations, either by sending them herself or causing them to be sent, either by enlisting the help of relatives, friends, or her social [[secretary]] to select the guest list and address envelopes, or by hiring a service.  With computer technology, some are able to print directly on envelopes from a guest list using a [[mail merge]] with [[word processing]] and [[spreadsheet]] software.\n\n==History==\n\n===The Middle Ages and before===\nPrior to the invention of the moveable-type [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in 1447, weddings in England were typically announced by means of a [[Town crier]]: a man who would walk through the streets announcing in a loud voice the news of the day. Traditionally, anyone within earshot became part of the celebration.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, illiteracy was widespread, so the practice of sending written wedding invitations emerged among the nobility. Families of means would commission monks, skilled in the art of [[Calligraphy]], to hand-craft their notices.\n\nSuch documents often carried the [[Coat of arms]], or personal crest, of the individual and were sealed with wax.\n\n===From 1600 onward===\nDespite the emergence of the printing press, the ordinary printing techniques of the time, in which ink was simply stamped onto the paper using lead type, produced too poor a result for stylish invitations. However, the tradition of announcing weddings in the newspaper did become established at this time.\n\nIn 1642, the invention of metal-plate engraving (or [[Mezzotint]]) by [[Ludwig von Siegen]] brought higher-quality wedding invitations within the reach of the emerging middle class.<ref>Griffiths, Antony (ed), ''Landmarks in Print Collecting - Connoisseurs and Donors at the British Museum since 1753'', p. 138, 1996, British Museum Press, {{ISBN|0714126098}}</ref> [[Engraving]], as the name implies, requires an artisan to \"hand write\" the text in reverse onto a metal plate using a carving tool, and the plate was then used to print the invitation. The resulting engraved invitations were protected from smudging by a sheet of tissue paper placed on top, which is a tradition that remains to this day.\n\nAt the time, the wording of wedding invitations was more elaborate than today; typically, the name of each guest was individually printed on the invitation.\n\n===The Industrial Revolution===\nFollowing the invention of [[Lithography]] by [[Alois Senefelder]] in 1798, it became possible to produce very sharp and distinctive inking without the need for engraving.<ref>{{cite book|title=Lithography and Lithographers|publisher=T. Fisher Unwin Publisher|place=London|year=1915|editor=Pennel ER|url=https://archive.org/details/lithographylitho00penn}}</ref> This paved the way for the emergence of a genuine mass-market in wedding invitations.\n\nWedding invitations were still delivered by hand and on horseback, however, due to the unreliability of the nascent postal system. A \u2018double envelope\u2019 was used to protect the invitation from damage en route to its recipient. This tradition remains today, despite advances in postal reliability.\n\n===Modern times===\nThe origins of commercially printed 'fine wedding stationery' can be traced to the period immediately following World War II, where a combination of democracy and rapid industrial growth gave the common man the ability to mimic the lifestyles and materialism of society's elite. About this time, prominent society figures, such as [[Amy Vanderbilt]] and [[Emily Post]], emerged to advise the ordinary man and woman on appropriate [[etiquette]].\n\nGrowth in the use of wedding stationery was also underpinned by the development of [[thermographic printing|thermography]]. Although it lacks the fineness and distinctiveness of engraving, thermography is a less expensive method of achieving raised type. This technique often called poor man's engraving, produces shiny, raised lettering without impressing the surface of the paper (in the way traditional engraving does). As such, wedding invitations - either printed or engraved - finally became affordable for all.\n\nMore recently [[Letterpress printing]] has made a strong resurgence in popularity for wedding invitations. It has a certain boutique and [[craft]] appeal due to the deep impression or bite that can be achieved. It was not the original intent of letterpress to bite into the paper in this way, but rather to kiss it creating a flat print. The bite or deep impression is a recent aesthetic that adds the sensory experience of touch to letterpress printed wedding invitations. Many letterpress printers that specialize in wedding invitations are small start-ups or artisan printers, rather than large printing companies.\n\nLaser engraving has also been making headway in the wedding invitation market over the last few years.  Primarily used for engraving wood veneer invitations, it is also used to engrave acrylic or to mark certain types of metal invitations.\n\nThe latest trend in wedding invitations is to order them online. Using the internet has made viewing, organizing and ordering wedding invitations an easy task. There are hundreds of websites that offer wedding invitations and stationery and being online allows the customer to order from anywhere in the world.\n\n==Mashood  weds pommi==\nEtiquette regarding the text on a formal wedding invitation varies according to country, culture and language.  In Western countries, a formal invitation is typically written in the formal, third-person language, saying that the [[Hospitality|host]]s wish for the recipient to attend the wedding and giving its date, time, and place. Even in countries like India, where the concept of wedding invitations was acquired through the British, the language continues to follow western traditions.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bard Graduate Center|url = http://www.bgc.bard.edu/news/multimedia/academic/indian-wedding.html|website = www.bgc.bard.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-16}}</ref>\n\nAs the bride's parents are traditionally the hosts of the wedding, the text commonly begins with the names of the bride's parents as they use them in formal social contexts, e.g., \"Mr. and Mrs. John A Smith\" or \"Dr. Mary Jones and Mr. John Smith\". The exact wording varies, but a typical phrasing runs as follows:\n\n[[Image:RedBumbleBeeInvitations.JPG|thumb|right|A modern wedding invitation]]\n<blockquote><center>\nMr. and Mrs. John A Smith<br />\nrequest the honor of your presence<br />\nat the wedding of their daughter<br />\nJessica Marie<br />\nto<br />\nMr. Michael Francis Miller<br />\non the first of November <br />\nat twelve noon <br />\nChristchurch Hall<br />\nRichmond, Virginia<br />\n</center></blockquote>\n\nNote the seemingly anglicized spelling 'honour'; this derives from a ruling laid down by [[Emily Post]] in the 1920s.\n\nIn the United States, the line \"request...presence\" is used when the ceremony is held in a house of worship; \"pleasure of your company\" is used when it is held elsewhere.\n\nIf the groom's parents are also hosts of the wedding, then their names may be added as well.  If the parents are not the hosts of the wedding, then the host's name is substituted in the first line, or, especially if the bride and groom are themselves the hosts, it may be written in the passive voice:  \"The honour of your presence is requested at the wedding of...\"\n\nFormal announcements, sent after the wedding ceremony, omit the time and sometimes the place, but usually retain the same general form.\n\nInformal invitations, appropriate to less formal weddings, are issued by word of mouth or by hand-written letter.  So long as they convey the necessary practical information about the time and place, there is no set form for these invitations.\n\n==Printing and design==\n\nCommercial wedding invitations are typically printed using one of the following methods: [[engraving]], [[lithography]], [[thermography]], [[letterpress printing]], sometimes blind [[Embossing (paper)|embossing]], compression plate process, or [[offset printing]].  More recently, many [[Do it yourself|do-it-yourself]] brides are printing on their home computers using a [[laser printer]] or [[inkjet printer]].  For the artistically inclined, they can be handmade or written in [[calligraphy]].\n\nHistorically, wedding invitations were hand-written unless the length of the guest list made this impractical.<ref name=Judith>{{cite book\n|author=Martin, Judith\n|title=Miss Manners' Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior\n|publisher=W.W.

Invitations are generally chosen to match the couple's personal preferences, the level of formality of the event, and any color scheme or planned theme.  For example, a casual beach wedding may have light, fresh colors and beach-related graphics. A formal church wedding may have more scripty [[typefaces]] and lots of ornamentation that matches the formal nature of the event. The design of the invitation is becoming less and less traditional and more reflective of the couple's personality. Some web-based print-on-demand companies now allow couples to design or customize their own wedding invitations. \n[[File:Rose_Foil_Invitation.jpg|alt=|thumb|An example of a foil modern wedding invitation]]\nMore recently in 2019, foil stamping and foil sleeking invitations have come back into trend. Foil sleeking is applied by applying a thick layer of toner to a paper using all four CMYK colours and a fifth white colour, next the card is fed through a foil heat transfer machine where the foil sticks to the toner and design. {{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe invitation is typically a note card, folded in half, or perhaps French folded (folded twice, into quarters).  Other options include a sheet of paper, a [[tri-fold]], or a trendy pocket-fold design.  The appropriate [[paper density]] depends on the design but typically ranges from heavy paper to very stiff card stock.\n\n==Mailing==\nTraditionally, wedding invitations are mailed in double envelopes. The inner [[envelope]] may be lined, is not gummed, and fits into the outer envelope. The outer envelope is gummed for sealing and addressing.  More recently, the inner envelope is often left out in the interest of saving money, paper, and postage. In some cases, a pocketfold takes the place of an inner envelope.\n\nIn countries that issue them, the envelope may be [[franking|franked]] with [[love stamp]]s. The [[United States Postal Service|United States postal service]] issues a love stamp each year specifically denominated to cover the double weight of the invitation and reply (a rate slightly less than the cost of two regular stamps).\n\n==Other items==\n\nIn addition to the invitation itself, sellers promote a full panoply of optional printed materials.  The ensemble may include an [[RSVP (invitations)|RSVP]] response card, a separate invitation to a [[wedding reception]], and information such as maps, directions, childcare options, and hotel accommodations.\n\nWedding invitations should be sent out 6\u20138 weeks prior to a wedding with slightly more time being given for out of town or destination weddings.  Guests should be asked to have their reply given between 3 and 2 weeks before the wedding date. Although many couples request RSVPs to be returned up to a month prior to the wedding day.\n\nThese printers also sell matching pieces intended for the day of the wedding, such as programs, menus, table cards, place cards as well as wedding favors and party favors such as napkins, coasters, cocktail stirrers and matchboxes.\n\n==Response==\nAs with any invitation, the sole obligation of the person receiving it is to respond, as promptly as reasonably possible, to let the hosts know whether or not he will be able to attend.<ref>{{cite book\n|author=Martin, Judith\n|title=Miss Manners' guide for the turn-of-the-millennium\n|publisher=Simon & Schuster\n|location=New York\n|year=1990\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/missmannersguide00mart_0/page/436 436]\n|isbn=0-671-72228-X\n|url-access=registration\n|url=https://archive.org/details/missmannersguide00mart_0/page/436\n}}</ref>  Receiving a wedding invitation does not obligate the recipient either to attend the wedding or to send a gift.\n\nA proper response is written on the recipient's normal [[stationery]], following the form of the invitation.  For example, if the invitation uses formal, third-person language, then the recipient replies in formal, third-person language, saying either \"Mr. Robert Jones accepts with pleasure the kind invitation to the wedding on the first of November\", or \"Ms. Susan Brown regrets that she is unable to attend the wedding on the first of November.\"\n\nPre-printed, pre-addressed, pre-stamped response cards are frequently sent in the hope of encouraging a greater proportion of invited people to respond to the invitation.

It is typically written in the formal, [[grammatical|third-person]] language and mailed five to eight weeks before the wedding date.\n\nLike any other invitation, it is the privilege and duty of the host\u2014historically, for younger brides in [[Western culture]], the mother of the bride, on behalf of the bride's family\u2014to issue invitations, either by sending them herself or causing them to be sent, either by enlisting the help of relatives, friends, or her social [[secretary]] to select the guest list and address envelopes, or by hiring a service.

{"title_page": "List of churches in Malta", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2016}}\nIn the small island state of [[Malta]], the church or chapel is a common feature of the landscape. Many churches in Malta dominate the skyline, and the domes and steeples can usually be seen from across the island. One can usually find the centre of a town or village by driving towards the parish church, although many towns and village cores feature two or more churches and chapels.\n\nOn the islands of Malta and [[Gozo]], which are two separate [[dioceses]], there are a total of 359 churches (313 in Malta and 46 in Gozo). Of these, 78 are [[parish]]es (63 in Malta and 15 in Gozo) and six are national parishes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Charles Buttigieg, P.R.O., Archbishop's Curia, Malta| title=THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN CONTEMPORARY MALTA|date=1995-10-24|url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/grazio/church.html|accessdate=2007-11-15}}</ref>\nThis means that there is a \"church density\" of slightly more than one church per square kilometer. In Malta, every locality has its [[parish church]], apart from two or three small localities. There are also localities that have more than one parish church, like [[Sliema]] and [[Birkirkara]], which have four parishes each. The list below lists most of the churches in Malta, Gozo and Comino, starting from the cathedrals, minor basilicas, parish churches and churches/chapels.\n\n== List of cathedrals, basilicas, parish churches and other churches and chapels in Malta and Gozo ==\n {| class=\"wikitable sortable zebra toptextcells\"\n!

Many churches in Malta dominate the skyline, and the domes and steeples can usually be seen from across the island. One can usually find the centre of a town or village by driving towards the parish church, although many towns and village cores feature two or more churches and chapels.\n\nOn the islands of Malta and [[Gozo]], which are two separate [[dioceses]], there are a total of 359 churches (313 in Malta and 46 in Gozo). Of these, 78 are [[parish]]es (63 in Malta and 15 in Gozo) and six are national parishes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Charles Buttigieg, P.R.O., Archbishop's Curia, Malta| title=THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN CONTEMPORARY MALTA|date=1995-10-24|url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/grazio/church.html|accessdate=2007-11-15}}</ref>\nThis means that there is a \"church density\" of slightly more than one church per square kilometer. In Malta, every locality has its [[parish church]], apart from two or three small localities. There are also localities that have more than one parish church, like [[Sliema]] and [[Birkirkara]], which have four parishes each.

He was a seven-time national [[Steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] champion in the 1950s and 1960s, and represented [[India]] at the [[1958 Asian Games]]. After a premature retirement from the army, Tomar returned to his native village. He later gained notoriety as a [[Chambal River|Chambal Valley]] [[dacoit|rebel]] when he resorted to violence after a land feud there. In late 1981, Tomar lost his life in a shootout with hundreds of armed members of a police task force sent to capture him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/betrayal-caste-haunt-village-where-paan-singh-tomar-was-killed/story-oBevIl7CrH72f2fr5hWkBO.html|title=Betrayal, caste haunt village where Paan Singh Tomar was killed|website=hindustantimes.com/|access-date=2016-03-20}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nPaan Singh Tomar was born in the small village of Bhidosa, near [[Porsa]] city, in a [[Tomar clan|Tomar]] [[Rajput]] [[Hindu]] family living on banks of [[Chambal River|Chambhal River]] in the erstwhile [[Tonwarghar]] district of the [[princely state]] of [[Gwalior State|Gwalior]] under the rule of the [[British Raj]] in India. Tomar's father was Eashwari Singh Tomar, whose younger brother Dayaram Singh Tomar went on to sire a branch of the Tomar family that owns most of the fertile agricultural land in and around the Bhidosa area. Tomar would later go on to murder Babbu Singh Tomar, his nephew and Dayaram Singh Tomar's grandson, in 1977 following a shady land dispute in which Tomar was cheated out of land.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paan Singh.

He was a champion sportsman, a national-ranking athlete, back in the 1950s and '60s. Legend has it that his initiation into serious running came off a dispute. When Tomar had just enrolled in the army in his regiment, he got into an argument with an instructor. As punishment, Tomar was asked to run numerous laps of the parade ground. As he ran, he caught the eye of the other officers. What they saw impressed them. Soon Tomar, exempt from regular duties, was put on the special diet for army sportsmen, even enjoying other perks and benefits.<ref>{{cite web |title= Who was this man? |url= http://www.timescrest.com/sports/who-was-this-man-7394 |publisher= Bennett, Coleman & Co.

He was not allowed to fight in the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]] and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] due to his career in sports, which ended in 1972.\n\n==After retirement==\nUpon retiring in 1977, Tomar returned to Bhidosa village. There arose a land dispute between him and his nephews Jandel Singh, Havaldar Singh, and Babbu Singh Tomar. Babbu Singh Tomar was a powerful landowner who owned seven licensed guns and was the then head of the 200-member extended Tomar family. To solve the dispute, a ''[[Panchayat raj|panchayat]]'' (congregational meeting) was held with the collector where Paan Singh was asked to give {{INR}}3,000 to Babbu Singh Tomar and his siblings to keep his own land; Tomar obliged. However, his own nephew Balwant Singh Tomar retaliated for the duplicity. The collector promised to return in 15 days. In the meantime, Babbu Singh Tomar came to Tomar's house and assaulted his 95-year-old mother who was alone in the household at the time. Following Tomar's return, his mother commanded him to take revenge and return her ''[[izzat (honour)|izzat]]'' (honor) by the morning if he was truly her son. Balwant and Tomar went to the fields armed where they espied Babbu Singh. Tomar then vigorously opened fire on Babbu Singh, who continued to run for about a kilometer before he collapsed despite being shot several times. Tomar would later give an interview with a local newspaper in [[Gwalior]] which may have prompted the administration to start taking his case seriously, considering this an act of defiance. At that time, there was a price of {{INR}}10,000 on his head. As per the interview, he did not want to kill the eight villagers whose family tip-off led to the killing of his elder brother Matadin Singh Tomar, who initially sold the land to Babbu Singh Tomar, setting off the dispute. But he could not stop his nephew Balwant, who was Matadin's son. During the entire interview, he toyed with a bullet.\n\n==Death of Paan Singh Tomar==\nOn October 1, 1981, the [[Circle Inspector]] Mahendra Pratap Singh Chauhan and his special task force of 500 gendarmes cornered and shot dead Tomar. 14 other members of his crew were also killed. The standoff and gunfight lasted over 12 hours. Chauhan had been tipped off about Tomar's arrival by Motiram Jatav, one of the village Dalits who was angered by Tomar's discriminatory attitude.<ref name=End>{{cite web|last=Mukherjee|first=Arindam|title=The Last Moments of Paana|url=http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/nation/the-last-moments-of-paana|work=[[Open (Indian magazine)|Open Magazine]]|accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref><ref> [https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/betrayal-caste-haunt-village-where-paan-singh-tomar-was-killed/story-oBevIl7CrH72f2fr5hWkBO.html Betrayal of Paan Singh Haunts Dalit Community of Rathiyan Ka Pura To This Day  - By Hindustan Times] </ref>\n\nAccording to newspaper reports, Tomar was shot when he was alive and was asking for water: \"Any Rajput here who could please give me some water?\"; [[Hawaldar]] Tribhuwan Singh started walking towards Tomar with some water but Circle Inspector Chauhan shouted at him: \"Tribhuwan, dacoits have no caste.\" And he was left to die.\n\n==Family members of Paan Singh's family==\nPaan Singh's son, Souram Singh Tomar (b. 1959) is a retired [[Indian Army]] ''[[subedar]]'' (captain) who lives in [[Babina, Uttar Pradesh|Babina]] in the Jhansi District of Uttar Pradesh.

He was a seven-time national [[Steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] champion in the 1950s and 1960s, and represented [[India]] at the [[1958 Asian Games]]. After a premature retirement from the army, Tomar returned to his native village. He later gained notoriety as a [[Chambal River|Chambal Valley]] [[dacoit|rebel]] when he resorted to violence after a land feud there. In late 1981, Tomar lost his life in a shootout with hundreds of armed members of a police task force sent to capture him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/betrayal-caste-haunt-village-where-paan-singh-tomar-was-killed/story-oBevIl7CrH72f2fr5hWkBO.html|title=Betrayal, caste haunt village where Paan Singh Tomar was killed|website=hindustantimes.com/|access-date=2016-03-20}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nPaan Singh Tomar was born in the small village of Bhidosa, near [[Porsa]] city, in a [[Tomar clan|Tomar]] [[Rajput]] [[Hindu]] family living on banks of [[Chambal River|Chambhal River]] in the erstwhile [[Tonwarghar]] district of the [[princely state]] of [[Gwalior State|Gwalior]] under the rule of the [[British Raj]] in India. Tomar's father was Eashwari Singh Tomar, whose younger brother Dayaram Singh Tomar went on to sire a branch of the Tomar family that owns most of the fertile agricultural land in and around the Bhidosa area. Tomar would later go on to murder Babbu Singh Tomar, his nephew and Dayaram Singh Tomar's grandson, in 1977 following a shady land dispute in which Tomar was cheated out of land.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paan Singh.

He was a champion sportsman, a national-ranking athlete, back in the 1950s and '60s. Legend has it that his initiation into serious running came off a dispute. When Tomar had just enrolled in the army in his regiment, he got into an argument with an instructor. As punishment, Tomar was asked to run numerous laps of the parade ground. As he ran, he caught the eye of the other officers. What they saw impressed them. Soon Tomar, exempt from regular duties, was put on the special diet for army sportsmen, even enjoying other perks and benefits.<ref>{{cite web |title= Who was this man? |url= http://www.timescrest.com/sports/who-was-this-man-7394 |publisher= Bennett, Coleman & Co.
