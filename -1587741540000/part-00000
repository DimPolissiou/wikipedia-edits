Antiquarianism focused on the empirical evidence that existed for the understanding of the past, encapsulated in the motto of the 18th-century antiquary, Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]], \"We speak from facts not theory\".

[[Flavio Biondo]], an Italian [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]] historian, created a systematic guide to the ruins and [[topography of ancient Rome]] in the early 15th century, for which he has been called an early founder of archaeology. Antiquarians of the 16th century, including [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] and [[William Camden]], conducted surveys of the English countryside, drawing, describing and interpreting the monuments that they encountered.\n\nThe [[OED]] first cites \"archaeologist\" from 1824; this soon took over as the usual term for one major branch of antiquarian activity. \"Archaeology\", from 1607 onwards, initially meant what we would call \"ancient history\" generally, with the narrower modern sense first seen in 1837.\n\n===First excavations===\n[[File:stonehenge 1877.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|alt=old photograph of stonehenge with toppled stones|An early photograph of [[Stonehenge]] taken July 1877]]\nOne of the first sites to undergo archaeological excavation was [[Stonehenge]] and other [[Megalith|megalithic monuments]] in England. [[John Aubrey]] (1626\u20131697) was a pioneer archaeologist who recorded numerous [[megalith]]ic and other [[Ancient monument|field monuments]] in southern England. He was also ahead of his time in the analysis of his findings. He attempted to chart the chronological stylistic evolution of handwriting, medieval architecture, costume, and shield-shapes.<ref>{{Citation |first=Michael |last=Hunter |authorlink=Michael Hunter (historian) |title=John Aubrey and the Realm of Learning |place=London |publisher=Duckworth |year=1975 |isbn=978-0-7156-0818-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/johnaubreyrealmo0000hunt/page/156 156\u201357, 162\u201366, 181] |url=https://archive.org/details/johnaubreyrealmo0000hunt/page/156 }}</ref>\n\nExcavations were also carried out by the Spanish military engineer [[Roque Joaqu\u00edn de Alcubierre]] in the ancient towns of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], both of which had been covered by ash during the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79]]. These excavations began in 1748 in Pompeii, while in Herculaneum they began in 1738. The discovery of entire towns, complete with utensils and even human shapes, as well the unearthing of [[fresco]]s, had a big impact throughout Europe.\n\nHowever, prior to the development of modern techniques, excavations tended to be haphazard; the importance of concepts such as [[Stratification (archaeology)|stratification]] and [[Archaeological context|context]] were overlooked.<ref>[[Dorothy King]], ''The Elgin Marbles'' (Hutchinson, January 2006)</ref>\n\n===Development of archaeological method===\n[[File:Both Lozenges.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Artifacts discovered at the 1808 [[Bush Barrow]] excavation by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]] and [[William Cunnington]].]]\nThe father of archaeological excavation was [[William Cunnington]] (1754\u20131810). He undertook excavations in [[Wiltshire]] from around 1798,<ref>Everill, P. 2010. The Parkers of Heytesbury: Archaeological pioneers. Antiquaries Journal 90: 441\u201353</ref> funded by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]]. Cunnington made meticulous recordings of [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[tumulus|barrows]], and the terms he used to categorize and describe them are still used by archaeologists today.<ref>Everill, P. 2009. Invisible Pioneers. British Archaeology 108: 40\u201343</ref>\n\nOne of the major achievements of 19th-century archaeology was the development of [[stratigraphy]]. The idea of overlapping strata tracing back to successive periods was borrowed from the new [[geology|geological]] and [[palaeontology|paleontological]] work of scholars like [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], [[James Hutton]] and [[Charles Lyell]]. The application of stratigraphy to archaeology first took place with the excavations of [[Prehistory|prehistorical]] and [[Bronze Age]] sites. In the third and fourth decades of the 19th-century, archaeologists like [[Jacques Boucher de Perthes]] and [[Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen]] began to put the artifacts they had found in chronological order.\n\nA major figure in the development of archaeology into a rigorous science was the army officer and [[ethnology|ethnologist]], [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]],<ref>Bowden, Mark (1984) ''General Pitt Rivers: The father of scientific archaeology''. [[Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum]]. {{ISBN|0-947535-00-4}}.</ref> who began excavations on his land in England in the 1880s. His approach was highly methodical by the standards of the time, and he is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist. He [[Pitt Rivers Museum|arranged his artifacts]] by type or \"[[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]], and within types by date or \"chronologically\". This style of arrangement, designed to highlight the evolutionary trends in human artifacts, was of enormous significance for the accurate dating of the objects. His most important methodological innovation was his insistence that ''all'' artifacts, not just beautiful or unique ones, be collected and catalogued.<ref>{{citation|first=Dan|last=Hicks|year=2013|chapter=Characterizing the World Archaeology Collections of the Pitt Rivers Museum|title=World Archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum: a characterization|publisher=Archaeopress|location=Oxford|editor1-first=Dan|editor1-last=Hicks|editor2-first=Alice|editor2-last=Stevenson|chapter-url=http://archaeopress.com/ArchaeopressShop/Public/download.asp?id=%7B64476CB8-7963-40E1-B225-F54DA37A2F9A%7D|isbn=978-1-905739-58-5}}</ref>\n\n[[William Flinders Petrie]] is another man who may legitimately be called the Father of Archaeology. His painstaking recording and study of artifacts, both in Egypt and later in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], laid down many of the ideas behind modern archaeological recording; he remarked that \"I believe the true line of research lies in the noting and comparison of the smallest details.\" Petrie developed the [[seriation (archaeology)|system of dating layers based on pottery and ceramic findings]], which revolutionized the chronological basis of [[Egyptology]]. Petrie was the first to scientifically investigate the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] in Egypt during the 1880s.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.pef.org.uk/profiles/sir-william-flinders-petrie-1853-1942|title= Sir William Flinders Petrie|publisher=Palestine Exploration Fund|year=2000|accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref> He was also responsible for mentoring and training a whole generation of Egyptologists, including [[Howard Carter]] who went on to achieve fame with the discovery of the tomb of 14th-century BC pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]].\n\n[[File:Aerial photograph of Maiden Castle from the west, 1937.jpg|thumb|left|alt=earthern fort with many walls|[[Mortimer Wheeler]] pioneered [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|systematic excavation]] in the early 20th century. Pictured, are his excavations at [[Maiden Castle, Dorset]], in October 1937.]]\nThe first stratigraphic excavation to reach wide popularity with public was that of [[Hissarlik]], on the site of ancient [[Troy]], carried out by [[Heinrich Schliemann]], [[Frank Calvert]] and [[Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld]] in the 1870s. These scholars individuated nine different cities that had overlapped with one another, from prehistory to the [[Hellenistic period]].<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=363| title=Great Ancient Civilizations of Asia Minor| first=Kenneth W.| last=Harl| accessdate=23 November 2012}}</ref> Meanwhile, the work of Sir [[Arthur Evans]] at [[Knossos]] in [[Crete]] revealed the ancient existence of an equally advanced [[Minoan civilization]].<ref>{{citation|first=Joseph Alexander|last=MacGillivray|title=Minotaur: Sir Arthur Evans and the Archaeology of the Minoan Myth|location=New York|publisher=Hill and Wang (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nThe next major figure in the development of archaeology was Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]], whose highly disciplined approach to excavation and systematic coverage in the 1920s and 1930s brought the science on swiftly. Wheeler developed the [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|grid system of excavation]], which was further improved by his student [[Kathleen Kenyon]].\n\nArchaeology became a professional activity in the first half of the 20th century, and it became possible to study archaeology as a subject in universities and even schools. By the end of the 20th century nearly all professional archaeologists, at least in developed countries, were graduates. Further adaptation and innovation in archaeology continued in this period, when [[maritime archaeology]] and [[urban archaeology]] became more prevalent and [[rescue archaeology]] was developed as a result of increasing commercial development.<ref name=\"Renfrew_Bahn1991#5\">Renfrew and Bahn (2004 [1991]:33\u201335)</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\n[[File:Australopithecus africanus - Cast of taung child.jpg|thumb|Cast of the skull of the [[Taung child]], uncovered in [[South Africa]]. The Child was an infant of the ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' species, an early form of [[hominin]]]]\nThe purpose of archaeology is to learn more about past societies and the development of the [[human race]]. Over 99% of the development of humanity has occurred within [[prehistory|prehistoric cultures]], who did not make use of [[literacy|writing]], thereby no written records exist for study purposes. Without such written sources, the only way to understand prehistoric societies is through archaeology. Because archaeology is the study of past human activity, it stretches back to about 2.5&nbsp;million years ago when we find the first stone tools \u2013 [[Oldowan|The Oldowan Industry]]. Many important developments in human history occurred during prehistory, such as the [[human evolution|evolution of humanity]] during the [[Paleolithic]] period, when the [[hominin]]s developed from the [[australopithecines]] in [[Africa]] and eventually into modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Archaeology also sheds light on many of humanity's technological advances, for instance the ability to use fire, the development of [[stone tool]]s, the discovery of [[metallurgy]], the beginnings of [[religion]] and the creation of [[agriculture]]. Without archaeology, we would know little or nothing about the use of material culture by humanity that pre-dates writing.<ref name=\"ncl\"/>\n\nHowever, it is not only prehistoric, pre-literate cultures that can be studied using archaeology but historic, literate cultures as well, through the sub-discipline of [[historical archaeology]]. For many literate cultures, such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Mesopotamia]], their surviving records are often incomplete and biased to some extent. In many societies, literacy was restricted to the [[elite]] classes, such as the [[clergy]] or the [[bureaucracy]] of court or temple. The literacy even of [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts. The interests and world-view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the populace. Writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into [[library|libraries]] and be preserved there for posterity. Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases, assumptions, cultural values and possibly deceptions of a limited range of individuals, usually a small fraction of the larger population. Hence, written records cannot be trusted as a sole source. The material record may be closer to a fair representation of society, though it is subject to its own biases, such as [[sampling bias]] and [[differential preservation]].<ref name=\"archaeological\"/>\n\nOften, archaeology provides the only means to learn of the existence and behaviors of people of the past. Across the millennia many thousands of cultures and societies and billions of people have come and gone of which there is little or no written record or existing records are misrepresentative or incomplete. Writing as it is known today did not exist in human civilization until the 4th millennium BC, in a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilizations. In contrast, ''Homo sapiens'' has existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of ''Homo'' for millions of years (see [[Human evolution]]). These civilizations are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they are open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a literate civilization many events and important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the early years of human civilization \u2013 the development of agriculture, cult practices of folk religion, the rise of the first cities \u2013 must come from archaeology.\n\nIn addition to their scientific importance, archaeological remains sometimes have political or cultural significance to descendants of the people who produced them, monetary value to collectors, or simply strong aesthetic appeal. Many people identify archaeology with the recovery of such aesthetic, religious, political, or economic treasures rather than with the reconstruction of past societies.\n\nThis view is often espoused in works of popular fiction, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Mummy, and King Solomon's Mines. When such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously, accusations of pseudoscience are invariably levelled at their proponents ''(see [[Pseudoarchaeology]])''. However, these endeavours, real and fictional, are not representative of modern archaeology.\n\n===Theory===\n{{main|Archaeological theory}}\n[[File:Archeologists sign at Lubbock Lake Monument IMG 1591.JPG|upright=0.9|right|thumb|alt=Archaeologists dig in the dirt very carefully so they won't miss anything important. |Sign at [[Lubbock Lake Landmark]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Texas]]]]\n\nThere is no one approach to archaeological theory that has been adhered to by all archaeologists. When archaeology developed in the late 19th century, the first approach to archaeological theory to be practiced was that of [[cultural-history archaeology]], which held the goal of explaining why cultures changed and adapted rather than just highlighting the fact that they did, therefore emphasizing [[historical particularism]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In the early 20th century, many archaeologists who studied past societies with direct continuing links to existing ones (such as those of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Siberia]]ns, [[Mesoamerica]]ns etc.) followed the [[direct historical approach]], compared the continuity between the past and contemporary ethnic and cultural groups.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In the 1960s, an archaeological movement largely led by American archaeologists like [[Lewis Binford]] and [[Kent Flannery]] arose that rebelled against the established cultural-history archaeology.<ref name=\"Binford1962\"/><ref name=\"Flannery1967\"/> They proposed a \"New Archaeology\", which would be more \"scientific\" and \"anthropological\", with [[hypothesis]] testing and the [[scientific method]] very important parts of what became known as [[processual archaeology]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nIn the 1980s, a new [[postmodern]] movement arose led by the British archaeologists [[Michael Shanks (archaeologist)|Michael Shanks]],<ref name=\"Shanks_Tilley1987\"/><ref name=\"Shanks_Tilley1988\"/><ref name=\"Shanks1991\"/><ref name=\"Shanks1993\"/> [[Christopher Tilley]],<ref name=\"Tilley1993\"/> [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]],<ref name=\"Miller_Tilley1984\"/><ref name=\"Miller_etal1989\"/> and [[Ian Hodder]],<ref name=\"Hodder1982\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1985\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1987\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1990\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1991\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1992\"/> which has become known as [[post-processual archaeology]]. It questioned processualism's appeals to scientific positivism and impartiality, and emphasized the importance of a more self-critical theoretical [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} However, this approach has been criticized by processualists as lacking scientific rigor, and the validity of both processualism and post-processualism is still under debate. Meanwhile, another theory, known as [[historical processualism]] has emerged seeking to incorporate a focus on process and post-processual archaeology's emphasis of reflexivity and history.<ref name=\"Pauketat2001\"/>\n\nArchaeological theory now borrows from a wide range of influences, including [[evolution|neo-evolutionary thought]],<ref name=\"Hinshaw2000\"/>[[#cite note-Hinshaw2000-35|<span class=\"mw-reflink-text\">[35]</span>]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[postmodernism]], [[Structure and agency|agency theory]], [[Cognitive archaeology|cognitive science]], [[structural functionalism]], [[Gender archaeology|gender-based]] and [[feminist archaeology]], and [[systems theory in archaeology|systems theory]].\n\n==Methods==\n[[File:Indusketa arkeologikoa.webm|thumb|Video showing the different works in an archaeological recovery and analysis]]\nAn archaeological investigation usually involves several distinct phases, each of which employs its own variety of methods. Before any practical work can begin, however, a clear objective as to what the archaeologists are looking to achieve must be agreed upon. This done, a site is [[Archaeological survey|surveyed]] to find out as much as possible about it and the surrounding area. Second, an excavation may take place to uncover any archaeological features buried under the ground. And, third, the information collected during the excavation is studied and evaluated in an attempt to achieve the original research objectives of the archaeologists. It is then considered good practice for the information to be published so that it is available to other archaeologists and historians, although this is sometimes neglected.<ref name=\"renfrew\"/>\n\n===Remote sensing===\nBefore actually starting to dig in a location, [[Remote sensing (archaeology)|remote sensing]] can be used to look where sites are located within a large area or provide more information about sites or regions. There are two types of remote sensing instruments\u2014passive and active. Passive instruments detect natural energy that is reflected or emitted from the observed scene. Passive instruments sense only radiation emitted by the object being viewed or reflected by the object from a source other than the instrument. Active instruments emit energy and record what is reflected. [[Satellite imagery]] is an example of passive remote sensing. Here are two active remote sensing instruments:\n\n'''[[Lidar]]''' (Light Detection and Ranging)\nA lidar uses a laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) to transmit a light pulse and a receiver with sensitive detectors to measure the backscattered or reflected light. Distance to the object is determined by recording the time between the transmitted and backscattered pulses and using the speed of light to calculate the distance travelled. Lidars can determine atmospheric profiles of aerosols, clouds, and other constituents of the atmosphere.\n\n'''[[Laser altimeter]]'''\nA laser altimeter uses a lidar (see above) to measure the height of the instrument platform above the surface. By independently knowing the height of the platform with respect to the mean Earth's surface, the topography of the underlying surface can be determined.\n<ref>{{citation|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/RemoteSensing/|title=Remote Sensing : Feature Articles|first=Graham|last=Steve|date=17 September 1999|publisher=NASA|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Field survey===\n{{main|Archaeological survey}}\n[[File:Monte Alb\u00e1n archeological site, Oaxaca.jpg|thumb|[[Monte Alban]] archaeological site]]\nThe archaeological project then continues (or alternatively, begins) with a [[archaeological survey|field survey]]. Regional survey is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region. Site survey is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest, such as houses and [[midden]]s, within a site. Each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods.\n\nSurvey was not widely practiced in the early days of archaeology. Cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace, and excavating only the plainly visible [[Feature (archaeology)|features]] there. [[Gordon Willey]] pioneered the technique of regional settlement pattern survey in 1949 in the [[Viru Valley]] of coastal [[Peru]],<ref name=\"Willey1953\"/><ref name=\"Willey1968\"/> and survey of all levels became prominent with the rise of processual archaeology some years later.<ref name=\"Billmand_Feinman1999\"/>\n\nSurvey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to, or even in place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and expense, because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artifacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] methods.)<ref name=\"Redman1974\"/> As with other forms of non-destructive archaeology, survey avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It is the only way to gather some forms of information, such as [[Human settlement|settlement patterns]] and settlement structure. Survey data are commonly assembled into [[map]]s, which may show surface features and/or artifact distribution.\n[[File:Archeoscan excavation site.jpg|thumbnail|right|Inverted kite aerial photo of an excavation of a Roman building at Nesley near Tetbury in Gloucestershire.]]\nThe simplest survey technique is surface survey. It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanized transport, to search for features or artifacts visible on the surface. Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as [[auger (drill)|augers]], [[corer]]s, and [[shovel test]] pits. If no materials are found, the area surveyed is deemed [[sterile deposit|sterile]].\n\n[[Aerial survey]] is conducted using [[camera]]s attached to [[airplane]]s, [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]], [[UAVs]], or even [[Kite]]s.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.armadale.org.uk/kite03.htm |title=Kite Aerial Photography |accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref> A bird's-eye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial photographs are used to document the status of the archaeological dig. Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface. [[Plant]]s growing above a buried man made structure, such as a stone wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as [[midden]]s) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening [[cereal|grain]], which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial photographs taken at different times of day will help show the outlines of structures by changes in shadows. Aerial survey also employs [[ultraviolet]], [[infrared]], ground-penetrating [[radar]] wavelengths, [[LiDAR]] and [[thermography]].<ref>{{citation|last=Reeves|first= D.M. |year=1936|title=Aerial photography and archaeology|journal=American Antiquity|volume=2|issue=2|pages= 102\u201307|doi=10.2307/275881|jstor=275881}}</ref>\n\n[[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|Geophysical survey]] can be the most effective way to see beneath the ground. [[Magnetometer]]s detect minute deviations in the [[Earth's magnetic field]] caused by [[iron]] artifacts, [[kiln]]s, some types of [[stone structures]], and even ditches and middens. Devices that measure the [[electrical resistivity]] of the soil are also widely used. Archaeological features whose electrical resistivity contrasts with that of surrounding soils can be detected and mapped. Some archaeological features (such as those composed of stone or brick) have higher resistivity than typical soils, while others (such as organic deposits or unfired clay) tend to have lower resistivity.\n\nAlthough some archaeologists consider the use of [[metal detector]]s to be tantamount to treasure hunting, others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying.<ref>{{citation |last=S\u00e1nchez |first=Rosal\u00eda |title=Para los arque\u00f3logos es un ladr\u00f3n, para los buscadores de tesoros un \u00eddolo |url=http://www.elmundo.es/cultura/2015/02/25/54ee2718ca4741d71a8b457b.html |date=25 February 2015 |access-date=19 December 2017 |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |language=es}}</ref> Examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on [[English Civil War]] battlefields, metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a 19th-century ship wreck, and service cable location during evaluation. Metal detectorists have also contributed to archaeology where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts from their archaeological context. In the UK, metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]].\n\nRegional survey in [[underwater archaeology]] uses geophysical or remote sensing devices such as marine magnetometer, [[side-scan sonar]], or sub-bottom sonar.<ref>{{citation|last=Hall|first= E.T. |year=1970|title= Survey techniques in underwater archaeology|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

It can reveal several types of information usually not accessible to survey, such as [[stratigraphy]], three-dimensional structure, and verifiably primary context.\n\nModern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features, known as their [[provenance]] or provenience, be recorded. This always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes vertical position as well (also see [[Harris matrix#Harris's Laws of Archaeological Stratigraphy|Primary Laws of Archaeology]]). Likewise, their [[archaeological association|association]], or [[relationship (archaeology)|relationship]] with nearby objects and [[feature (archaeology)|features]], needs to be recorded for later analysis. This allows the archaeologist to deduce which [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and features were likely used together and which may be from different [[archaeological phase|phases]] of activity. For example, excavation of a site reveals its [[stratigraphy]]; if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct cultures, artifacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures.\n\nExcavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research, in relative terms. Also, as a destructive process, it carries [[ethics|ethical]] concerns. As a result, very few sites are excavated in their entirety. Again the percentage of a site excavated depends greatly on the country and \"method statement\" issued. [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] is even more important in excavation than in survey. Sometimes large mechanical equipment, such as [[backhoe]]s ([[J. C. Bamford|JCBs]]), is used in excavation, especially to remove the [[topsoil]] ([[overburden]]), though this method is increasingly used with great caution. Following this rather dramatic step, the exposed area is usually hand-cleaned with [[trowel]]s or [[hoe (tool)|hoes]] to ensure that all features are apparent.\n\nThe next task is to form a [[Archaeological plan|site plan]] and then use it to help decide the method of excavation. Features dug into the [[Archaeological natural|natural subsoil]] are normally excavated in portions to produce a visible [[archaeological section]] for recording. A feature, for example a pit or a ditch, consists of two parts: the [[Cut (archaeology)|cut]] and the [[Fill (archaeology)|fill]]. The cut describes the edge of the feature, where the feature meets the natural soil. It is the feature's boundary. The fill is what the feature is filled with, and will often appear quite distinct from the natural soil. The cut and fill are given consecutive numbers for recording purposes. Scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and [[Single context recording|recording]] sheets are filled in describing the [[Archaeological context|context]] of each. All this information serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.\n\n===Analysis===\n{{main|Post-excavation analysis}}\n[[File:LuzonensisMolars.jpg|thumb|Five of the seven known fossil teeth of ''[[Homo luzonensis]]'' found in [[Callao Cave]], the [[Philippines]].]]\nOnce artifacts and structures have been excavated, or collected from surface surveys, it is necessary to properly study them. This process is known as [[post-excavation analysis]], and is usually the most time-consuming part of an archaeological investigation. It is not uncommon for final excavation reports for major sites to take years to be published.\n\nAt a basic level of analysis, artifacts found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections. This comparison process often involves classifying them [[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]] and identifying other sites with similar artifact assemblages. However, a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through [[archaeological science]], meaning that artifacts can be dated and their compositions examined. Bones, plants, and pollen collected from a site can all be analyzed using the methods of [[zooarchaeology]], [[paleoethnobotany]], [[palynology]] and [[stable isotopes]]<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/10256016.2019.1598986 | pmid=30943760 | volume=55 | issue=3 | title=Is the 'canine surrogacy approach' (CSA) still valid for dogs and humans in market-oriented and subsistence-oriented communities in Brazil? | year=2019 | journal=Isotopes in Environmental and Health Studies | pages=227\u2013236 | author=Luiz Abdalla Filho Adibe, Bielefeld Nardoto Gabriela, de Aro Galera Leonardo, Leite de Souza Janaina, Santos Reis Luiza, Almoza Hernandez Yeleine, Sales Rebeca, Guimar\u00e3es Gerardi Daniel, Antonio Martinelli Luiz}}</ref> while any texts can usually be [[Deciphering|deciphered]].\n\nThese techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known, and therefore they contribute greatly to the understanding of a site.\n\n===Computational and virtual archaeology===\n{{main|Computational archaeology}}\n{{main|Virtual archaeology}}\n[[Computer graphics]] are now used to build virtual [[3D modeling|3D models]] of sites, such as the throne room of an Assyrian palace or ancient Rome.<ref name=\"virt\"/> [[Photogrammetry]] is also used as an analytical tool, and digital [[topography|topographical]] models have been combined with [[astronomy|astronomical]] calculations to verify whether or not certain structures (such as pillars) were aligned with astronomical events such as the sun's position at a [[solstice]].<ref name=virt/> [[Agent-based modeling]] and [[Computer simulation|simulation]] can be used to better understand past social dynamics and outcomes.

Experimental techniques remain a crucial component to improving the inferential frameworks for interpreting the archaeological record.\n\n===Archaeometry===\n{{Main|Archaeological science}}\n\n[[Archaeometry]] aims to systematize archaeological measurement. It emphasizes the application of analytical techniques from physics, chemistry, and engineering. It is a field of research that frequently focuses on the definition of the chemical composition of archaeological remains for source analysis.<ref name=\"Glasscock_et_al1994\"/> Archaeometry also investigates different spatial characteristics of features, employing methods such as space syntax techniques and [[geodesy]] as well as computer-based tools such as [[geographic information system]] technology.<ref name=\"GIS, critique, representation and beyond\"/> [[Rare earth elements]] patterns may also be used.<ref name=\"An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns\"/>  A relatively nascent subfield is that of archaeological materials, designed to enhance understanding of prehistoric and non-industrial culture through scientific analysis of the structure and properties of materials associated with human activity.<ref name=\"mit\"/>\n\n===Cultural resources management===\n{{Main|Cultural resources management}}\n{{Original research|section|date=March 2014}}\n\nArchaeology can be a subsidiary activity within [[Cultural resources management]] (CRM), also called [[Cultural heritage management]] (CHM) in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"The University of Exeter - SoGAER - Department of Archaeology\"/> CRM archaeologists frequently examine archaeological sites that are threatened by development. Today, CRM accounts for most of the archaeological research done in the United States and much of that in [[western Europe]] as well. In the US, CRM archaeology has been a growing concern since the passage of the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] (NHPA) of 1966, and most taxpayers, scholars, and politicians believe that CRM has helped preserve much of that nation's history and prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of cities, dams, and highways. Along with other statutes, the NHPA mandates that projects on federal land or involving federal funds or permits consider the effects of the project on each [[archaeological site]].\n\nThe application of CRM in the United Kingdom is not limited to government-funded projects. Since 1990, [[PPG 16]]<ref name=\"Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and planning - Planning, building and the environment - Communities and Local Government\"/> has required planners to consider archaeology as a [[material consideration]] in determining applications for new development. As a result, numerous archaeological organizations undertake mitigation work in advance of (or during) construction work in archaeologically sensitive areas, at the [[polluter pays principle|developer's expense]].\n\nIn England, ultimate responsibility of care for the historic environment rests with the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]<ref name=\"Department for Culture Media and Sport - historic environment\"/> in association with [[English Heritage]].<ref name=\"English Heritage - Stonehenge & the History of England: English Heritage\"/> In [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], the same responsibilities lie with [[Historic Scotland]],<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/ |title= Historic Scotland |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=5 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090426014641/http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/| archivedate= 26 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> [[Cadw]]<ref name=\"Cadw\"/> and the [[Northern Ireland Environment Agency]]<ref name=\"Built Environment\"/> respectively.\n\nIn France, the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage) trains curators specialized in archaeology. Their mission is to enhance the objects discovered. The [[curator]] is the link between scientific knowledge, administrative regulations, heritage objects and the public.\n\nAmong the goals of CRM are the identification, preservation, and maintenance of [[cultural]] sites on public and private lands, and the removal of culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity, such as proposed construction. This study involves at least a cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction. If these do exist, time and money must be allotted for their excavation. If initial survey and/or test excavations indicate the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site, the construction may be prohibited entirely.\n\nCultural resources management has, however, been criticized. CRM is conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour. Compounding the time pressure is the vetting process of site reports that are required (in the US) to be submitted by CRM firms to the appropriate [[State Historic Preservation Office]] (SHPO). From the SHPO's perspective there is to be no difference between a report submitted by a CRM firm operating under a deadline, and a multi-year academic project. The end result is that for a Cultural Resource Management archaeologist to be successful, they must be able to produce academic quality documents at a corporate world pace.\n\nThe annual ratio of open academic archaeology positions (inclusive of [[postdoctoral|post-doc]], temporary, and non- tenure track appointments) to the annual number of archaeology MA/MSc and PhD students is disproportionate. Cultural Resource Management, once considered an intellectual backwater for individuals with \"strong backs and weak minds,\"<ref name=\"Flannery1982\"/> has attracted these graduates, and CRM offices are thus increasingly staffed by advance degreed individuals with a track record of producing scholarly articles but who also have extensive CRM field experience.\n\n==Popular views of archaeology==\n\n[[File:Beit shean1.jpg|thumb|right|Extensive excavations at [[Beit She'an]], [[Israel]]]]\n[[File:Exhibition in a multi-storey car park on archological discoveries having been made during construction.JPG|thumb|Permanent exhibition in a German [[multi-storey car park]], explaining the archaeological discoveries made during the construction of this building]]\n\nEarly archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities and was mostly done by upper class, scholarly men. This general tendency laid the foundation for the modern popular view of archaeology and archaeologists. Many of the public view archaeology as something only available to a narrow demographic. The job of archaeologist is depicted as a \"romantic adventurist occupation\".<ref name=\"McGeough 2006 174\u2013185\">{{Citation|last=McGeough|first=Kevin|title=Heroes, Mummies, and Treasure: Near Eastern Archaeology in the Movies|journal=Near Eastern Archaeology|year=2006|volume=69|issue=3\u20134|pages=174\u201385|doi=10.1086/NEA25067670|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/10ec642c63fb8691174749138c5429ce983936e2}}</ref> and as a hobby more than a job in the scientific community. Cinema audiences form a notion of \"who archaeologists are, why they do what they do, and how relationships to the past are constituted\",<ref name=\"McGeough 2006 174\u2013185\"/> and is often under the impression that all archaeology takes place in a distant and foreign land, only to collect monetarily or spiritually priceless artifacts. The modern depiction of archaeology has incorrectly formed the public's perception of what archaeology is.\n\nMuch thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as [[Cop\u00e1n]] and the [[Valley of the Kings]], but the bulk of activities and finds of modern archaeology are not so sensational. Archaeological adventure stories tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in carrying out modern surveys, [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]], and [[archaeological data processing|data processing]]. Some archaeologists refer to such off-the-mark portrayals as \"[[pseudoarchaeology]]\".<ref name=\"Romancing the Past-Archaeology\"/>\nArchaeologists are also very much reliant on public support; the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed.<ref name=\"Denning2004\"/>\n\n==Current issues and controversy==\n\n===Public archaeology===\n[[File:Dolina-Pano-3.jpg|thumb|upright|Excavations at the site of [[Gran Dolina]], in the [[Atapuerca Mountains]], Spain, 2008]]\nMotivated by a desire to halt looting, curb [[#Pseudoarchaeology|pseudoarchaeology]], and to help preserve archaeological sites through education and fostering public appreciation for the importance of archaeological heritage, archaeologists are mounting public-outreach campaigns.<ref name=\"Anthropological Studies Center (ASC)\"/> They seek to stop looting by combatting people who illegally take artifacts from protected sites, and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting. Common methods of public outreach include press releases, and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation by professional archaeologists.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Public appreciation of the significance of archaeology and archaeological sites often leads to improved protection from encroaching development or other threats.\n\nOne audience for archaeologists' work is the public. They increasingly realize that their work can benefit non-academic and non-archaeological audiences, and that they have a responsibility to educate and inform the public about archaeology. Local heritage awareness is aimed at increasing civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects, and better public presentations of archaeological sites and knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} The U.S.Dept. of Agriculture, [[US Forest Service|Forest Service]] (USFS) operates a volunteer archaeology and historic preservation program called the Passport in Time (PIT).

Archaeological excavation, however, is best undertaken by well-trained staff that can work quickly and accurately. Often this requires observing the necessary [[health and safety]] and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern [[construction|building site]] with tight deadlines. Certain charities and [[local government]] bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} There is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial [[training excavations]] and archaeological holiday tours.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nArchaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies, which is one reason why [[Community archaeology]] projects are starting to become more common. Often archaeologists are assisted by the public in the locating of archaeological sites, which professional archaeologists have neither the funding, nor the time to do.\n\nArchaeological Legacy Institute (ALI), is a registered 501[c] [3] non-profit, media and education corporation registered in Oregon in 1999. ALI founded a website, [http://archaeologychannel.org/ The Archaeology Channel] to support the organization's mission \"to nurturing and bringing attention to the human cultural heritage, by using media in the most efficient and effective ways possible.\"<ref name=\"The Archaeology Channel and About Us: Archaeological Legacy Institute\"/>\n\n===Pseudoarchaeology===\n{{Main|Pseudoarchaeology}}\n\n[[Pseudoarchaeology]] is an umbrella term for all activities that falsely claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted and scientific archaeological practices. It includes much fictional archaeological work (discussed above), as well as some actual activity. Many non-fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of processual archaeology, or the specific critiques of it contained in [[Post-processual archaeology|post-processualism]].\n\nAn example of this type is the writing of [[Erich von D\u00e4niken]]. His 1968 book, ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', together with many subsequent lesser-known works, expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilization on Earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. This theory, known as [[palaeocontact theory]], or [[Ancient astronaut theory]], is not exclusively D\u00e4niken's, nor did the idea originate with him. Works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of well-established theories on the basis of limited evidence, and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind.\n\n===Looting===\n[[File:Looting rontoy2007.jpg|thumb|right|A looter's pit on the morning following its excavation, taken at [[Rontoy]], [[Huaura Valley]], [[Peru]] in June 2007.

For instance, many of the tombs of the Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s were looted during [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]].<ref name=\"civilizations\" /> Archaeology stimulates interest in ancient objects, and people in search of artifacts or treasure cause damage to archaeological sites. The commercial and academic demand for artifacts unfortunately contributes directly to the [[illicit antiquities]] trade. Smuggling of antiquities abroad to private collectors has caused great cultural and economic damage in many countries whose governments lack the resources and or the will to deter it. Looters damage and destroy archaeological sites, denying future generations information about their ethnic and cultural heritage. Indigenous peoples especially lose access to and control over their 'cultural resources', ultimately denying them the opportunity to know their past.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nIn 1937, W. F. Hodge the Director of the [[Southwest Museum]] released a statement that the museum would no longer purchase or accept collections from looted contexts.<ref name=\"Hodge1937\" /> The first conviction of the transport of artifacts illegally removed from private property under the [http://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/FHPL_ArchRsrcsProt.pdf Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA; Public Law 96-95; 93 Statute 721]; {{usc|16|470aamm}}) was in 1992 in the State of Indiana.<ref name=\"Munson_et_al1995\" />\n\nArchaeologists trying to protect artifacts may be placed in danger by looters or locals trying to protect the artifacts from archaeologists who are viewed as looters by the locals.<ref>{{Citation|title=Archaeologist's Execution Highlights Risks to History's Guardians|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/08/150820-syria-archaeologist-isis-protecting-artifacts/|website=National Geographic News|accessdate=21 August 2015|first=Mark|last=Strauss|date=20 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nSome historical archaeology sites are subjected to looting by [[metal detector]] hobbyists who search for artifacts using increasingly advanced technology. Efforts are underway among all major Archaeological organizations to increase education and legitimate cooperation between amateurs and professionals in the metal detecting community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Open Minds, Clearer Signals \u2013 Metal Detectorist and Archaeologist Cooperation Takes Another Step |url=https://sha.org/blog/2013/04/open-minds-clearer-signals-metal-detectorist-and-archaeologist-cooperation-takes-another-step/ |website=The Society for Historical Archaeology |publisher=The Society for Historical Archaeology|date=10 April 2013 }}</ref>\n\nWhile most looting is deliberate, accidental looting can occur when amateurs, who are unaware of the importance of Archaeological rigor, collect artifacts from sites and place them into private collections.\n\n===Descendant peoples===\nIn the United States, examples such as the case of [[Kennewick Man]] have illustrated the tensions between [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and archaeologists, which can be summarized as a conflict between a need to remain respectful toward sacred burial sites and the academic benefit from studying them. For years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artifacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied. Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, the past is long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present.\n\nAs a consequence of this, American Indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors, while American archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies. This contradictory situation was addressed by the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA, 1990), which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research institutions to possess human remains. Due in part to the spirit of [[postprocessualism]], some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of [[indigenous peoples]] likely to be descended from those under study.\n\nArchaeologists have also been obliged to re-examine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space. To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes, mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance. Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites to give them some protection from being developed. Such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same time study.\n\nWhile this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to fieldwork, it has benefits for all parties involved. Tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred, while the archaeologists gain the elders' aid in interpreting their finds. There have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession.\n\n====Repatriation====\n:''See [[Repatriation and reburial of human remains]]''\nA new trend in the heated controversy between [[First Nations]] groups and scientists is the [[repatriation]] of native [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] to the original descendants. An example of this occurred on 21 June 2005, when community members and elders from a number of the 10 [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] nations in the [[Ottawa]] area convened on the Kitigan Zibi reservation near [[Maniwaki, Quebec]], to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods\u2014some dating back 6,000 years. It was not determined, however, if the remains were directly related to the Algonquin people who now inhabit the region. The remains may be of Iroquoian ancestry, since Iroquoian people inhabited the area before the Algonquin. Moreover, the oldest of these remains might have no relation at all to the Algonquin or Iroquois, and belong to an earlier culture who previously inhabited the area.\n\nThe remains and artifacts, including [[jewelry]], [[tool]]s and [[weapons]], were originally excavated from various sites in the [[Ottawa Valley]], including [[Morrison Island|Morrison]] and the [[Allumette Island]]s. They had been part of the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]]'s research collection for decades, some since the late 19th century. Elders from various Algonquin communities conferred on an appropriate reburial, eventually deciding on traditional [[Juniperus virginiana|redcedar]] and [[birchbark]] boxes lined with redcedar chips, [[muskrat]] and [[Beaver#Commercial uses|beaver pelts]].\n\nAn inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to 80 boxes of various sizes are buried. Because of this reburial, no further scientific study is possible. Although negotiations were at times tense between the Kitigan Zibi community and museum, they were able to reach agreement.<ref name=\"Canadian Geographic Online\" />\n\n[[Kennewick Man]] is another repatriation candidate that has been the source of heated debate.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{annotated link|Anthropology}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeobiology}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeogenetics}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeology of religion and ritual}}\n* {{annotated link|Area of archaeological potential}}\n* {{annotated link|Chronological dating}}\n* {{annotated link|Classical archaeology}}\n* {{annotated link|Dump digging}}\n* {{annotated link|GIS in archaeology}}\n* {{annotated link|Harris matrix}}\n* {{annotated link|Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage project}}\n* {{annotated link|Paleoanthropology|Palaeoanthropology}}\n\n'''Lists'''\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeological periods}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeological sites by country}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeologists}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeology awards}}\n* {{annotated link|List of paleoethnobotanists}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns\">{{Citation |title= An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns |author1=Saiano, F.  |author2=Scalenghe, R.|year= 2009|volume=36|issue=11|pages=2502\u201306|doi= 10.1016/j.jas.2009.06.025|journal= Journal of Archaeological Science}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Anthropological Studies Center (ASC)\">{{Citation|url=http://www.sonoma.edu/asc/roadshow.html |title=Anthropological Studies Center (ASC) |publisher=Sonoma.edu |accessdate=5 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090328003841/http://www.sonoma.edu/asc/roadshow.html| archivedate= 28 March 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"archaeological\">{{citation | author = Schiffer M.

Antiquarians studied [[history]] with particular attention to ancient artifacts and manuscripts, as well as historical sites. Antiquarianism focused on the empirical evidence that existed for the understanding of the past, encapsulated in the motto of the 18th-century antiquary, Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]], \"We speak from facts not theory\". Tentative steps towards the systematization of archaeology as a [[science]] took place during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]] in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>{{citation|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/historyofarchaeology/a/history_series.htm|last=Hirst|first=K. Kris|title=The History of Archaeology: How Ancient Relic Hunting Became Science|work=ThoughtCo|date=9 February 2017|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn Europe, philosophical interest in the remains of [[Ancient Greece|Greco]]-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] civilization and the rediscovery of classical culture began in the late [[Middle Age]]. [[Flavio Biondo]], an Italian [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]] historian, created a systematic guide to the ruins and [[topography of ancient Rome]] in the early 15th century, for which he has been called an early founder of archaeology. Antiquarians of the 16th century, including [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] and [[William Camden]], conducted surveys of the English countryside, drawing, describing and interpreting the monuments that they encountered.\n\nThe [[OED]] first cites \"archaeologist\" from 1824; this soon took over as the usual term for one major branch of antiquarian activity. \"Archaeology\", from 1607 onwards, initially meant what we would call \"ancient history\" generally, with the narrower modern sense first seen in 1837.\n\n===First excavations===\n[[File:stonehenge 1877.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|alt=old photograph of stonehenge with toppled stones|An early photograph of [[Stonehenge]] taken July 1877]]\nOne of the first sites to undergo archaeological excavation was [[Stonehenge]] and other [[Megalith|megalithic monuments]] in England. [[John Aubrey]] (1626\u20131697) was a pioneer archaeologist who recorded numerous [[megalith]]ic and other [[Ancient monument|field monuments]] in southern England. He was also ahead of his time in the analysis of his findings. He attempted to chart the chronological stylistic evolution of handwriting, medieval architecture, costume, and shield-shapes.<ref>{{Citation |first=Michael |last=Hunter |authorlink=Michael Hunter (historian) |title=John Aubrey and the Realm of Learning |place=London |publisher=Duckworth |year=1975 |isbn=978-0-7156-0818-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/johnaubreyrealmo0000hunt/page/156 156\u201357, 162\u201366, 181] |url=https://archive.org/details/johnaubreyrealmo0000hunt/page/156 }}</ref>\n\nExcavations were also carried out by the Spanish military engineer [[Roque Joaqu\u00edn de Alcubierre]] in the ancient towns of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], both of which had been covered by ash during the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79]]. These excavations began in 1748 in Pompeii, while in Herculaneum they began in 1738. The discovery of entire towns, complete with utensils and even human shapes, as well the unearthing of [[fresco]]s, had a big impact throughout Europe.\n\nHowever, prior to the development of modern techniques, excavations tended to be haphazard; the importance of concepts such as [[Stratification (archaeology)|stratification]] and [[Archaeological context|context]] were overlooked.<ref>[[Dorothy King]], ''The Elgin Marbles'' (Hutchinson, January 2006)</ref>\n\n===Development of archaeological method===\n[[File:Both Lozenges.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Artifacts discovered at the 1808 [[Bush Barrow]] excavation by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]] and [[William Cunnington]].]]\nThe father of archaeological excavation was [[William Cunnington]] (1754\u20131810). He undertook excavations in [[Wiltshire]] from around 1798,<ref>Everill, P. 2010. The Parkers of Heytesbury: Archaeological pioneers. Antiquaries Journal 90: 441\u201353</ref> funded by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]]. Cunnington made meticulous recordings of [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[tumulus|barrows]], and the terms he used to categorize and describe them are still used by archaeologists today.<ref>Everill, P. 2009. Invisible Pioneers. British Archaeology 108: 40\u201343</ref>\n\nOne of the major achievements of 19th-century archaeology was the development of [[stratigraphy]]. The idea of overlapping strata tracing back to successive periods was borrowed from the new [[geology|geological]] and [[palaeontology|paleontological]] work of scholars like [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], [[James Hutton]] and [[Charles Lyell]]. The application of stratigraphy to archaeology first took place with the excavations of [[Prehistory|prehistorical]] and [[Bronze Age]] sites. In the third and fourth decades of the 19th-century, archaeologists like [[Jacques Boucher de Perthes]] and [[Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen]] began to put the artifacts they had found in chronological order.\n\nA major figure in the development of archaeology into a rigorous science was the army officer and [[ethnology|ethnologist]], [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]],<ref>Bowden, Mark (1984) ''General Pitt Rivers: The father of scientific archaeology''. [[Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum]]. {{ISBN|0-947535-00-4}}.</ref> who began excavations on his land in England in the 1880s. His approach was highly methodical by the standards of the time, and he is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist. He [[Pitt Rivers Museum|arranged his artifacts]] by type or \"[[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]], and within types by date or \"chronologically\". This style of arrangement, designed to highlight the evolutionary trends in human artifacts, was of enormous significance for the accurate dating of the objects. His most important methodological innovation was his insistence that ''all'' artifacts, not just beautiful or unique ones, be collected and catalogued.<ref>{{citation|first=Dan|last=Hicks|year=2013|chapter=Characterizing the World Archaeology Collections of the Pitt Rivers Museum|title=World Archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum: a characterization|publisher=Archaeopress|location=Oxford|editor1-first=Dan|editor1-last=Hicks|editor2-first=Alice|editor2-last=Stevenson|chapter-url=http://archaeopress.com/ArchaeopressShop/Public/download.asp?id=%7B64476CB8-7963-40E1-B225-F54DA37A2F9A%7D|isbn=978-1-905739-58-5}}</ref>\n\n[[William Flinders Petrie]] is another man who may legitimately be called the Father of Archaeology. His painstaking recording and study of artifacts, both in Egypt and later in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], laid down many of the ideas behind modern archaeological recording; he remarked that \"I believe the true line of research lies in the noting and comparison of the smallest details.\" Petrie developed the [[seriation (archaeology)|system of dating layers based on pottery and ceramic findings]], which revolutionized the chronological basis of [[Egyptology]]. Petrie was the first to scientifically investigate the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] in Egypt during the 1880s.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.pef.org.uk/profiles/sir-william-flinders-petrie-1853-1942|title= Sir William Flinders Petrie|publisher=Palestine Exploration Fund|year=2000|accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref> He was also responsible for mentoring and training a whole generation of Egyptologists, including [[Howard Carter]] who went on to achieve fame with the discovery of the tomb of 14th-century BC pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]].\n\n[[File:Aerial photograph of Maiden Castle from the west, 1937.jpg|thumb|left|alt=earthern fort with many walls|[[Mortimer Wheeler]] pioneered [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|systematic excavation]] in the early 20th century.

These scholars individuated nine different cities that had overlapped with one another, from prehistory to the [[Hellenistic period]].<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=363| title=Great Ancient Civilizations of Asia Minor| first=Kenneth W.| last=Harl| accessdate=23 November 2012}}</ref> Meanwhile, the work of Sir [[Arthur Evans]] at [[Knossos]] in [[Crete]] revealed the ancient existence of an equally advanced [[Minoan civilization]].<ref>{{citation|first=Joseph Alexander|last=MacGillivray|title=Minotaur: Sir Arthur Evans and the Archaeology of the Minoan Myth|location=New York|publisher=Hill and Wang (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nThe next major figure in the development of archaeology was Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]], whose highly disciplined approach to excavation and systematic coverage in the 1920s and 1930s brought the science on swiftly. Wheeler developed the [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|grid system of excavation]], which was further improved by his student [[Kathleen Kenyon]].\n\nArchaeology became a professional activity in the first half of the 20th century, and it became possible to study archaeology as a subject in universities and even schools. By the end of the 20th century nearly all professional archaeologists, at least in developed countries, were graduates. Further adaptation and innovation in archaeology continued in this period, when [[maritime archaeology]] and [[urban archaeology]] became more prevalent and [[rescue archaeology]] was developed as a result of increasing commercial development.<ref name=\"Renfrew_Bahn1991#5\">Renfrew and Bahn (2004 [1991]:33\u201335)</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\n[[File:Australopithecus africanus - Cast of taung child.jpg|thumb|Cast of the skull of the [[Taung child]], uncovered in [[South Africa]]. The Child was an infant of the ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' species, an early form of [[hominin]]]]\nThe purpose of archaeology is to learn more about past societies and the development of the [[human race]]. Over 99% of the development of humanity has occurred within [[prehistory|prehistoric cultures]], who did not make use of [[literacy|writing]], thereby no written records exist for study purposes. Without such written sources, the only way to understand prehistoric societies is through archaeology. Because archaeology is the study of past human activity, it stretches back to about 2.5&nbsp;million years ago when we find the first stone tools \u2013 [[Oldowan|The Oldowan Industry]]. Many important developments in human history occurred during prehistory, such as the [[human evolution|evolution of humanity]] during the [[Paleolithic]] period, when the [[hominin]]s developed from the [[australopithecines]] in [[Africa]] and eventually into modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Archaeology also sheds light on many of humanity's technological advances, for instance the ability to use fire, the development of [[stone tool]]s, the discovery of [[metallurgy]], the beginnings of [[religion]] and the creation of [[agriculture]]. Without archaeology, we would know little or nothing about the use of material culture by humanity that pre-dates writing.<ref name=\"ncl\"/>\n\nHowever, it is not only prehistoric, pre-literate cultures that can be studied using archaeology but historic, literate cultures as well, through the sub-discipline of [[historical archaeology]]. For many literate cultures, such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Mesopotamia]], their surviving records are often incomplete and biased to some extent. In many societies, literacy was restricted to the [[elite]] classes, such as the [[clergy]] or the [[bureaucracy]] of court or temple. The literacy even of [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts. The interests and world-view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the populace. Writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into [[library|libraries]] and be preserved there for posterity. Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases, assumptions, cultural values and possibly deceptions of a limited range of individuals, usually a small fraction of the larger population. Hence, written records cannot be trusted as a sole source. The material record may be closer to a fair representation of society, though it is subject to its own biases, such as [[sampling bias]] and [[differential preservation]].<ref name=\"archaeological\"/>\n\nOften, archaeology provides the only means to learn of the existence and behaviors of people of the past. Across the millennia many thousands of cultures and societies and billions of people have come and gone of which there is little or no written record or existing records are misrepresentative or incomplete. Writing as it is known today did not exist in human civilization until the 4th millennium BC, in a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilizations. In contrast, ''Homo sapiens'' has existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of ''Homo'' for millions of years (see [[Human evolution]]). These civilizations are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they are open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a literate civilization many events and important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the early years of human civilization \u2013 the development of agriculture, cult practices of folk religion, the rise of the first cities \u2013 must come from archaeology.\n\nIn addition to their scientific importance, archaeological remains sometimes have political or cultural significance to descendants of the people who produced them, monetary value to collectors, or simply strong aesthetic appeal. Many people identify archaeology with the recovery of such aesthetic, religious, political, or economic treasures rather than with the reconstruction of past societies.\n\nThis view is often espoused in works of popular fiction, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Mummy, and King Solomon's Mines. When such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously, accusations of pseudoscience are invariably levelled at their proponents ''(see [[Pseudoarchaeology]])''. However, these endeavours, real and fictional, are not representative of modern archaeology.\n\n===Theory===\n{{main|Archaeological theory}}\n[[File:Archeologists sign at Lubbock Lake Monument IMG 1591.JPG|upright=0.9|right|thumb|alt=Archaeologists dig in the dirt very carefully so they won't miss anything important. |Sign at [[Lubbock Lake Landmark]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Texas]]]]\n\nThere is no one approach to archaeological theory that has been adhered to by all archaeologists. When archaeology developed in the late 19th century, the first approach to archaeological theory to be practiced was that of [[cultural-history archaeology]], which held the goal of explaining why cultures changed and adapted rather than just highlighting the fact that they did, therefore emphasizing [[historical particularism]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In the early 20th century, many archaeologists who studied past societies with direct continuing links to existing ones (such as those of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Siberia]]ns, [[Mesoamerica]]ns etc.) followed the [[direct historical approach]], compared the continuity between the past and contemporary ethnic and cultural groups.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In the 1960s, an archaeological movement largely led by American archaeologists like [[Lewis Binford]] and [[Kent Flannery]] arose that rebelled against the established cultural-history archaeology.<ref name=\"Binford1962\"/><ref name=\"Flannery1967\"/> They proposed a \"New Archaeology\", which would be more \"scientific\" and \"anthropological\", with [[hypothesis]] testing and the [[scientific method]] very important parts of what became known as [[processual archaeology]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nIn the 1980s, a new [[postmodern]] movement arose led by the British archaeologists [[Michael Shanks (archaeologist)|Michael Shanks]],<ref name=\"Shanks_Tilley1987\"/><ref name=\"Shanks_Tilley1988\"/><ref name=\"Shanks1991\"/><ref name=\"Shanks1993\"/> [[Christopher Tilley]],<ref name=\"Tilley1993\"/> [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]],<ref name=\"Miller_Tilley1984\"/><ref name=\"Miller_etal1989\"/> and [[Ian Hodder]],<ref name=\"Hodder1982\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1985\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1987\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1990\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1991\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1992\"/> which has become known as [[post-processual archaeology]]. It questioned processualism's appeals to scientific positivism and impartiality, and emphasized the importance of a more self-critical theoretical [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} However, this approach has been criticized by processualists as lacking scientific rigor, and the validity of both processualism and post-processualism is still under debate. Meanwhile, another theory, known as [[historical processualism]] has emerged seeking to incorporate a focus on process and post-processual archaeology's emphasis of reflexivity and history.<ref name=\"Pauketat2001\"/>\n\nArchaeological theory now borrows from a wide range of influences, including [[evolution|neo-evolutionary thought]],<ref name=\"Hinshaw2000\"/>[[#cite note-Hinshaw2000-35|<span class=\"mw-reflink-text\">[35]</span>]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[postmodernism]], [[Structure and agency|agency theory]], [[Cognitive archaeology|cognitive science]], [[structural functionalism]], [[Gender archaeology|gender-based]] and [[feminist archaeology]], and [[systems theory in archaeology|systems theory]].\n\n==Methods==\n[[File:Indusketa arkeologikoa.webm|thumb|Video showing the different works in an archaeological recovery and analysis]]\nAn archaeological investigation usually involves several distinct phases, each of which employs its own variety of methods. Before any practical work can begin, however, a clear objective as to what the archaeologists are looking to achieve must be agreed upon. This done, a site is [[Archaeological survey|surveyed]] to find out as much as possible about it and the surrounding area. Second, an excavation may take place to uncover any archaeological features buried under the ground. And, third, the information collected during the excavation is studied and evaluated in an attempt to achieve the original research objectives of the archaeologists. It is then considered good practice for the information to be published so that it is available to other archaeologists and historians, although this is sometimes neglected.<ref name=\"renfrew\"/>\n\n===Remote sensing===\nBefore actually starting to dig in a location, [[Remote sensing (archaeology)|remote sensing]] can be used to look where sites are located within a large area or provide more information about sites or regions. There are two types of remote sensing instruments\u2014passive and active. Passive instruments detect natural energy that is reflected or emitted from the observed scene. Passive instruments sense only radiation emitted by the object being viewed or reflected by the object from a source other than the instrument. Active instruments emit energy and record what is reflected. [[Satellite imagery]] is an example of passive remote sensing. Here are two active remote sensing instruments:\n\n'''[[Lidar]]''' (Light Detection and Ranging)\nA lidar uses a laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) to transmit a light pulse and a receiver with sensitive detectors to measure the backscattered or reflected light. Distance to the object is determined by recording the time between the transmitted and backscattered pulses and using the speed of light to calculate the distance travelled. Lidars can determine atmospheric profiles of aerosols, clouds, and other constituents of the atmosphere.\n\n'''[[Laser altimeter]]'''\nA laser altimeter uses a lidar (see above) to measure the height of the instrument platform above the surface. By independently knowing the height of the platform with respect to the mean Earth's surface, the topography of the underlying surface can be determined.\n<ref>{{citation|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/RemoteSensing/|title=Remote Sensing : Feature Articles|first=Graham|last=Steve|date=17 September 1999|publisher=NASA|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Field survey===\n{{main|Archaeological survey}}\n[[File:Monte Alb\u00e1n archeological site, Oaxaca.jpg|thumb|[[Monte Alban]] archaeological site]]\nThe archaeological project then continues (or alternatively, begins) with a [[archaeological survey|field survey]]. Regional survey is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region. Site survey is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest, such as houses and [[midden]]s, within a site. Each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods.\n\nSurvey was not widely practiced in the early days of archaeology. Cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace, and excavating only the plainly visible [[Feature (archaeology)|features]] there. [[Gordon Willey]] pioneered the technique of regional settlement pattern survey in 1949 in the [[Viru Valley]] of coastal [[Peru]],<ref name=\"Willey1953\"/><ref name=\"Willey1968\"/> and survey of all levels became prominent with the rise of processual archaeology some years later.<ref name=\"Billmand_Feinman1999\"/>\n\nSurvey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to, or even in place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and expense, because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artifacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] methods.)<ref name=\"Redman1974\"/> As with other forms of non-destructive archaeology, survey avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It is the only way to gather some forms of information, such as [[Human settlement|settlement patterns]] and settlement structure. Survey data are commonly assembled into [[map]]s, which may show surface features and/or artifact distribution.\n[[File:Archeoscan excavation site.jpg|thumbnail|right|Inverted kite aerial photo of an excavation of a Roman building at Nesley near Tetbury in Gloucestershire.]]\nThe simplest survey technique is surface survey. It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanized transport, to search for features or artifacts visible on the surface. Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as [[auger (drill)|augers]], [[corer]]s, and [[shovel test]] pits. If no materials are found, the area surveyed is deemed [[sterile deposit|sterile]].\n\n[[Aerial survey]] is conducted using [[camera]]s attached to [[airplane]]s, [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]], [[UAVs]], or even [[Kite]]s.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.armadale.org.uk/kite03.htm |title=Kite Aerial Photography |accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref> A bird's-eye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial photographs are used to document the status of the archaeological dig. Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface. [[Plant]]s growing above a buried man made structure, such as a stone wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as [[midden]]s) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening [[cereal|grain]], which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial photographs taken at different times of day will help show the outlines of structures by changes in shadows. Aerial survey also employs [[ultraviolet]], [[infrared]], ground-penetrating [[radar]] wavelengths, [[LiDAR]] and [[thermography]].<ref>{{citation|last=Reeves|first= D.M. |year=1936|title=Aerial photography and archaeology|journal=American Antiquity|volume=2|issue=2|pages= 102\u201307|doi=10.2307/275881|jstor=275881}}</ref>\n\n[[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|Geophysical survey]] can be the most effective way to see beneath the ground. [[Magnetometer]]s detect minute deviations in the [[Earth's magnetic field]] caused by [[iron]] artifacts, [[kiln]]s, some types of [[stone structures]], and even ditches and middens. Devices that measure the [[electrical resistivity]] of the soil are also widely used. Archaeological features whose electrical resistivity contrasts with that of surrounding soils can be detected and mapped. Some archaeological features (such as those composed of stone or brick) have higher resistivity than typical soils, while others (such as organic deposits or unfired clay) tend to have lower resistivity.\n\nAlthough some archaeologists consider the use of [[metal detector]]s to be tantamount to treasure hunting, others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying.<ref>{{citation |last=S\u00e1nchez |first=Rosal\u00eda |title=Para los arque\u00f3logos es un ladr\u00f3n, para los buscadores de tesoros un \u00eddolo |url=http://www.elmundo.es/cultura/2015/02/25/54ee2718ca4741d71a8b457b.html |date=25 February 2015 |access-date=19 December 2017 |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |language=es}}</ref> Examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on [[English Civil War]] battlefields, metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a 19th-century ship wreck, and service cable location during evaluation. Metal detectorists have also contributed to archaeology where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts from their archaeological context. In the UK, metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]].\n\nRegional survey in [[underwater archaeology]] uses geophysical or remote sensing devices such as marine magnetometer, [[side-scan sonar]], or sub-bottom sonar.<ref>{{citation|last=Hall|first= E.T. |year=1970|title= Survey techniques in underwater archaeology|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

It can reveal several types of information usually not accessible to survey, such as [[stratigraphy]], three-dimensional structure, and verifiably primary context.\n\nModern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features, known as their [[provenance]] or provenience, be recorded. This always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes vertical position as well (also see [[Harris matrix#Harris's Laws of Archaeological Stratigraphy|Primary Laws of Archaeology]]). Likewise, their [[archaeological association|association]], or [[relationship (archaeology)|relationship]] with nearby objects and [[feature (archaeology)|features]], needs to be recorded for later analysis. This allows the archaeologist to deduce which [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and features were likely used together and which may be from different [[archaeological phase|phases]] of activity. For example, excavation of a site reveals its [[stratigraphy]]; if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct cultures, artifacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures.\n\nExcavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research, in relative terms. Also, as a destructive process, it carries [[ethics|ethical]] concerns. As a result, very few sites are excavated in their entirety. Again the percentage of a site excavated depends greatly on the country and \"method statement\" issued. [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] is even more important in excavation than in survey. Sometimes large mechanical equipment, such as [[backhoe]]s ([[J. C. Bamford|JCBs]]), is used in excavation, especially to remove the [[topsoil]] ([[overburden]]), though this method is increasingly used with great caution. Following this rather dramatic step, the exposed area is usually hand-cleaned with [[trowel]]s or [[hoe (tool)|hoes]] to ensure that all features are apparent.\n\nThe next task is to form a [[Archaeological plan|site plan]] and then use it to help decide the method of excavation. Features dug into the [[Archaeological natural|natural subsoil]] are normally excavated in portions to produce a visible [[archaeological section]] for recording. A feature, for example a pit or a ditch, consists of two parts: the [[Cut (archaeology)|cut]] and the [[Fill (archaeology)|fill]]. The cut describes the edge of the feature, where the feature meets the natural soil. It is the feature's boundary. The fill is what the feature is filled with, and will often appear quite distinct from the natural soil. The cut and fill are given consecutive numbers for recording purposes. Scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and [[Single context recording|recording]] sheets are filled in describing the [[Archaeological context|context]] of each. All this information serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.\n\n===Analysis===\n{{main|Post-excavation analysis}}\n[[File:LuzonensisMolars.jpg|thumb|Five of the seven known fossil teeth of ''[[Homo luzonensis]]'' found in [[Callao Cave]], the [[Philippines]].]]\nOnce artifacts and structures have been excavated, or collected from surface surveys, it is necessary to properly study them. This process is known as [[post-excavation analysis]], and is usually the most time-consuming part of an archaeological investigation. It is not uncommon for final excavation reports for major sites to take years to be published.\n\nAt a basic level of analysis, artifacts found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections. This comparison process often involves classifying them [[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]] and identifying other sites with similar artifact assemblages. However, a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through [[archaeological science]], meaning that artifacts can be dated and their compositions examined. Bones, plants, and pollen collected from a site can all be analyzed using the methods of [[zooarchaeology]], [[paleoethnobotany]], [[palynology]] and [[stable isotopes]]<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/10256016.2019.1598986 | pmid=30943760 | volume=55 | issue=3 | title=Is the 'canine surrogacy approach' (CSA) still valid for dogs and humans in market-oriented and subsistence-oriented communities in Brazil? | year=2019 | journal=Isotopes in Environmental and Health Studies | pages=227\u2013236 | author=Luiz Abdalla Filho Adibe, Bielefeld Nardoto Gabriela, de Aro Galera Leonardo, Leite de Souza Janaina, Santos Reis Luiza, Almoza Hernandez Yeleine, Sales Rebeca, Guimar\u00e3es Gerardi Daniel, Antonio Martinelli Luiz}}</ref> while any texts can usually be [[Deciphering|deciphered]].\n\nThese techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known, and therefore they contribute greatly to the understanding of a site.\n\n===Computational and virtual archaeology===\n{{main|Computational archaeology}}\n{{main|Virtual archaeology}}\n[[Computer graphics]] are now used to build virtual [[3D modeling|3D models]] of sites, such as the throne room of an Assyrian palace or ancient Rome.<ref name=\"virt\"/> [[Photogrammetry]] is also used as an analytical tool, and digital [[topography|topographical]] models have been combined with [[astronomy|astronomical]] calculations to verify whether or not certain structures (such as pillars) were aligned with astronomical events such as the sun's position at a [[solstice]].<ref name=virt/> [[Agent-based modeling]] and [[Computer simulation|simulation]] can be used to better understand past social dynamics and outcomes.

Experimental techniques remain a crucial component to improving the inferential frameworks for interpreting the archaeological record.\n\n===Archaeometry===\n{{Main|Archaeological science}}\n\n[[Archaeometry]] aims to systematize archaeological measurement. It emphasizes the application of analytical techniques from physics, chemistry, and engineering. It is a field of research that frequently focuses on the definition of the chemical composition of archaeological remains for source analysis.<ref name=\"Glasscock_et_al1994\"/> Archaeometry also investigates different spatial characteristics of features, employing methods such as space syntax techniques and [[geodesy]] as well as computer-based tools such as [[geographic information system]] technology.<ref name=\"GIS, critique, representation and beyond\"/> [[Rare earth elements]] patterns may also be used.<ref name=\"An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns\"/>  A relatively nascent subfield is that of archaeological materials, designed to enhance understanding of prehistoric and non-industrial culture through scientific analysis of the structure and properties of materials associated with human activity.<ref name=\"mit\"/>\n\n===Cultural resources management===\n{{Main|Cultural resources management}}\n{{Original research|section|date=March 2014}}\n\nArchaeology can be a subsidiary activity within [[Cultural resources management]] (CRM), also called [[Cultural heritage management]] (CHM) in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"The University of Exeter - SoGAER - Department of Archaeology\"/> CRM archaeologists frequently examine archaeological sites that are threatened by development. Today, CRM accounts for most of the archaeological research done in the United States and much of that in [[western Europe]] as well. In the US, CRM archaeology has been a growing concern since the passage of the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] (NHPA) of 1966, and most taxpayers, scholars, and politicians believe that CRM has helped preserve much of that nation's history and prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of cities, dams, and highways. Along with other statutes, the NHPA mandates that projects on federal land or involving federal funds or permits consider the effects of the project on each [[archaeological site]].\n\nThe application of CRM in the United Kingdom is not limited to government-funded projects. Since 1990, [[PPG 16]]<ref name=\"Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and planning - Planning, building and the environment - Communities and Local Government\"/> has required planners to consider archaeology as a [[material consideration]] in determining applications for new development. As a result, numerous archaeological organizations undertake mitigation work in advance of (or during) construction work in archaeologically sensitive areas, at the [[polluter pays principle|developer's expense]].\n\nIn England, ultimate responsibility of care for the historic environment rests with the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]<ref name=\"Department for Culture Media and Sport - historic environment\"/> in association with [[English Heritage]].<ref name=\"English Heritage - Stonehenge & the History of England: English Heritage\"/> In [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], the same responsibilities lie with [[Historic Scotland]],<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/ |title= Historic Scotland |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=5 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090426014641/http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/| archivedate= 26 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> [[Cadw]]<ref name=\"Cadw\"/> and the [[Northern Ireland Environment Agency]]<ref name=\"Built Environment\"/> respectively.\n\nIn France, the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage) trains curators specialized in archaeology. Their mission is to enhance the objects discovered. The [[curator]] is the link between scientific knowledge, administrative regulations, heritage objects and the public.\n\nAmong the goals of CRM are the identification, preservation, and maintenance of [[cultural]] sites on public and private lands, and the removal of culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity, such as proposed construction. This study involves at least a cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction. If these do exist, time and money must be allotted for their excavation. If initial survey and/or test excavations indicate the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site, the construction may be prohibited entirely.\n\nCultural resources management has, however, been criticized. CRM is conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour. Compounding the time pressure is the vetting process of site reports that are required (in the US) to be submitted by CRM firms to the appropriate [[State Historic Preservation Office]] (SHPO). From the SHPO's perspective there is to be no difference between a report submitted by a CRM firm operating under a deadline, and a multi-year academic project. The end result is that for a Cultural Resource Management archaeologist to be successful, they must be able to produce academic quality documents at a corporate world pace.\n\nThe annual ratio of open academic archaeology positions (inclusive of [[postdoctoral|post-doc]], temporary, and non- tenure track appointments) to the annual number of archaeology MA/MSc and PhD students is disproportionate. Cultural Resource Management, once considered an intellectual backwater for individuals with \"strong backs and weak minds,\"<ref name=\"Flannery1982\"/> has attracted these graduates, and CRM offices are thus increasingly staffed by advance degreed individuals with a track record of producing scholarly articles but who also have extensive CRM field experience.\n\n==Popular views of archaeology==\n\n[[File:Beit shean1.jpg|thumb|right|Extensive excavations at [[Beit She'an]], [[Israel]]]]\n[[File:Exhibition in a multi-storey car park on archological discoveries having been made during construction.JPG|thumb|Permanent exhibition in a German [[multi-storey car park]], explaining the archaeological discoveries made during the construction of this building]]\n\nEarly archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities and was mostly done by upper class, scholarly men. This general tendency laid the foundation for the modern popular view of archaeology and archaeologists. Many of the public view archaeology as something only available to a narrow demographic. The job of archaeologist is depicted as a \"romantic adventurist occupation\".<ref name=\"McGeough 2006 174\u2013185\">{{Citation|last=McGeough|first=Kevin|title=Heroes, Mummies, and Treasure: Near Eastern Archaeology in the Movies|journal=Near Eastern Archaeology|year=2006|volume=69|issue=3\u20134|pages=174\u201385|doi=10.1086/NEA25067670|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/10ec642c63fb8691174749138c5429ce983936e2}}</ref> and as a hobby more than a job in the scientific community. Cinema audiences form a notion of \"who archaeologists are, why they do what they do, and how relationships to the past are constituted\",<ref name=\"McGeough 2006 174\u2013185\"/> and is often under the impression that all archaeology takes place in a distant and foreign land, only to collect monetarily or spiritually priceless artifacts. The modern depiction of archaeology has incorrectly formed the public's perception of what archaeology is.\n\nMuch thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as [[Cop\u00e1n]] and the [[Valley of the Kings]], but the bulk of activities and finds of modern archaeology are not so sensational. Archaeological adventure stories tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in carrying out modern surveys, [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]], and [[archaeological data processing|data processing]]. Some archaeologists refer to such off-the-mark portrayals as \"[[pseudoarchaeology]]\".<ref name=\"Romancing the Past-Archaeology\"/>\nArchaeologists are also very much reliant on public support; the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed.<ref name=\"Denning2004\"/>\n\n==Current issues and controversy==\n\n===Public archaeology===\n[[File:Dolina-Pano-3.jpg|thumb|upright|Excavations at the site of [[Gran Dolina]], in the [[Atapuerca Mountains]], Spain, 2008]]\nMotivated by a desire to halt looting, curb [[#Pseudoarchaeology|pseudoarchaeology]], and to help preserve archaeological sites through education and fostering public appreciation for the importance of archaeological heritage, archaeologists are mounting public-outreach campaigns.<ref name=\"Anthropological Studies Center (ASC)\"/> They seek to stop looting by combatting people who illegally take artifacts from protected sites, and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting. Common methods of public outreach include press releases, and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation by professional archaeologists.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Public appreciation of the significance of archaeology and archaeological sites often leads to improved protection from encroaching development or other threats.\n\nOne audience for archaeologists' work is the public. They increasingly realize that their work can benefit non-academic and non-archaeological audiences, and that they have a responsibility to educate and inform the public about archaeology. Local heritage awareness is aimed at increasing civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects, and better public presentations of archaeological sites and knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} The U.S.Dept. of Agriculture, [[US Forest Service|Forest Service]] (USFS) operates a volunteer archaeology and historic preservation program called the Passport in Time (PIT). Volunteers work with professional USFS archaeologists and historians on national forests throughout the U.S. Volunteers are involved in all aspects of professional archaeology under expert supervision.<ref name=\"rapidcityjournal\"/>\n\nTelevision programs, web videos and social media can also bring an understanding of underwater archaeology to a broad audience. The ''Mardi Gras'' Shipwreck Project<ref>{{citation|title=Mardi Gras Shipwreck |url=http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |website=uwf.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516045935/http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |archivedate=16 May 2015 }}</ref> integrated a one-hour HD documentary,<ref name=\"Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck\">{{citation|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=Nautilus Productions}}</ref> short videos for public viewing and video updates during the expedition as part of the educational outreach.

Archaeological excavation, however, is best undertaken by well-trained staff that can work quickly and accurately. Often this requires observing the necessary [[health and safety]] and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern [[construction|building site]] with tight deadlines. Certain charities and [[local government]] bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} There is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial [[training excavations]] and archaeological holiday tours.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nArchaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies, which is one reason why [[Community archaeology]] projects are starting to become more common. Often archaeologists are assisted by the public in the locating of archaeological sites, which professional archaeologists have neither the funding, nor the time to do.\n\nArchaeological Legacy Institute (ALI), is a registered 501[c] [3] non-profit, media and education corporation registered in Oregon in 1999. ALI founded a website, [http://archaeologychannel.org/ The Archaeology Channel] to support the organization's mission \"to nurturing and bringing attention to the human cultural heritage, by using media in the most efficient and effective ways possible.\"<ref name=\"The Archaeology Channel and About Us: Archaeological Legacy Institute\"/>\n\n===Pseudoarchaeology===\n{{Main|Pseudoarchaeology}}\n\n[[Pseudoarchaeology]] is an umbrella term for all activities that falsely claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted and scientific archaeological practices. It includes much fictional archaeological work (discussed above), as well as some actual activity. Many non-fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of processual archaeology, or the specific critiques of it contained in [[Post-processual archaeology|post-processualism]].\n\nAn example of this type is the writing of [[Erich von D\u00e4niken]]. His 1968 book, ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', together with many subsequent lesser-known works, expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilization on Earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. This theory, known as [[palaeocontact theory]], or [[Ancient astronaut theory]], is not exclusively D\u00e4niken's, nor did the idea originate with him. Works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of well-established theories on the basis of limited evidence, and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind.\n\n===Looting===\n[[File:Looting rontoy2007.jpg|thumb|right|A looter's pit on the morning following its excavation, taken at [[Rontoy]], [[Huaura Valley]], [[Peru]] in June 2007. Several small holes left by looters' prospecting probes can be seen, as well as their footprints.]]\n\n[[Looting]] of archaeological sites is an ancient problem. For instance, many of the tombs of the Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s were looted during [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]].<ref name=\"civilizations\" /> Archaeology stimulates interest in ancient objects, and people in search of artifacts or treasure cause damage to archaeological sites. The commercial and academic demand for artifacts unfortunately contributes directly to the [[illicit antiquities]] trade. Smuggling of antiquities abroad to private collectors has caused great cultural and economic damage in many countries whose governments lack the resources and or the will to deter it. Looters damage and destroy archaeological sites, denying future generations information about their ethnic and cultural heritage. Indigenous peoples especially lose access to and control over their 'cultural resources', ultimately denying them the opportunity to know their past.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nIn 1937, W. F. Hodge the Director of the [[Southwest Museum]] released a statement that the museum would no longer purchase or accept collections from looted contexts.<ref name=\"Hodge1937\" /> The first conviction of the transport of artifacts illegally removed from private property under the [http://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/FHPL_ArchRsrcsProt.pdf Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA; Public Law 96-95; 93 Statute 721]; {{usc|16|470aamm}}) was in 1992 in the State of Indiana.<ref name=\"Munson_et_al1995\" />\n\nArchaeologists trying to protect artifacts may be placed in danger by looters or locals trying to protect the artifacts from archaeologists who are viewed as looters by the locals.<ref>{{Citation|title=Archaeologist's Execution Highlights Risks to History's Guardians|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/08/150820-syria-archaeologist-isis-protecting-artifacts/|website=National Geographic News|accessdate=21 August 2015|first=Mark|last=Strauss|date=20 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nSome historical archaeology sites are subjected to looting by [[metal detector]] hobbyists who search for artifacts using increasingly advanced technology. Efforts are underway among all major Archaeological organizations to increase education and legitimate cooperation between amateurs and professionals in the metal detecting community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Open Minds, Clearer Signals \u2013 Metal Detectorist and Archaeologist Cooperation Takes Another Step |url=https://sha.org/blog/2013/04/open-minds-clearer-signals-metal-detectorist-and-archaeologist-cooperation-takes-another-step/ |website=The Society for Historical Archaeology |publisher=The Society for Historical Archaeology|date=10 April 2013 }}</ref>\n\nWhile most looting is deliberate, accidental looting can occur when amateurs, who are unaware of the importance of Archaeological rigor, collect artifacts from sites and place them into private collections.\n\n===Descendant peoples===\nIn the United States, examples such as the case of [[Kennewick Man]] have illustrated the tensions between [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and archaeologists, which can be summarized as a conflict between a need to remain respectful toward sacred burial sites and the academic benefit from studying them. For years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artifacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied. Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, the past is long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present.\n\nAs a consequence of this, American Indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors, while American archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies. This contradictory situation was addressed by the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA, 1990), which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research institutions to possess human remains. Due in part to the spirit of [[postprocessualism]], some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of [[indigenous peoples]] likely to be descended from those under study.\n\nArchaeologists have also been obliged to re-examine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space. To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes, mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance. Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites to give them some protection from being developed. Such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same time study.\n\nWhile this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to fieldwork, it has benefits for all parties involved. Tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred, while the archaeologists gain the elders' aid in interpreting their finds. There have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession.\n\n====Repatriation====\n:''See [[Repatriation and reburial of human remains]]''\nA new trend in the heated controversy between [[First Nations]] groups and scientists is the [[repatriation]] of native [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] to the original descendants. An example of this occurred on 21 June 2005, when community members and elders from a number of the 10 [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] nations in the [[Ottawa]] area convened on the Kitigan Zibi reservation near [[Maniwaki, Quebec]], to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods\u2014some dating back 6,000 years. It was not determined, however, if the remains were directly related to the Algonquin people who now inhabit the region. The remains may be of Iroquoian ancestry, since Iroquoian people inhabited the area before the Algonquin. Moreover, the oldest of these remains might have no relation at all to the Algonquin or Iroquois, and belong to an earlier culture who previously inhabited the area.\n\nThe remains and artifacts, including [[jewelry]], [[tool]]s and [[weapons]], were originally excavated from various sites in the [[Ottawa Valley]], including [[Morrison Island|Morrison]] and the [[Allumette Island]]s. They had been part of the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]]'s research collection for decades, some since the late 19th century. Elders from various Algonquin communities conferred on an appropriate reburial, eventually deciding on traditional [[Juniperus virginiana|redcedar]] and [[birchbark]] boxes lined with redcedar chips, [[muskrat]] and [[Beaver#Commercial uses|beaver pelts]].\n\nAn inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to 80 boxes of various sizes are buried. Because of this reburial, no further scientific study is possible. Although negotiations were at times tense between the Kitigan Zibi community and museum, they were able to reach agreement.<ref name=\"Canadian Geographic Online\" />\n\n[[Kennewick Man]] is another repatriation candidate that has been the source of heated debate.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{annotated link|Anthropology}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeobiology}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeogenetics}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeology of religion and ritual}}\n* {{annotated link|Area of archaeological potential}}\n* {{annotated link|Chronological dating}}\n* {{annotated link|Classical archaeology}}\n* {{annotated link|Dump digging}}\n* {{annotated link|GIS in archaeology}}\n* {{annotated link|Harris matrix}}\n* {{annotated link|Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage project}}\n* {{annotated link|Paleoanthropology|Palaeoanthropology}}\n\n'''Lists'''\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeological periods}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeological sites by country}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeologists}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeology awards}}\n* {{annotated link|List of paleoethnobotanists}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns\">{{Citation |title= An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns |author1=Saiano, F.  |author2=Scalenghe, R.|year= 2009|volume=36|issue=11|pages=2502\u201306|doi= 10.1016/j.jas.2009.06.025|journal= Journal of Archaeological Science}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Anthropological Studies Center (ASC)\">{{Citation|url=http://www.sonoma.edu/asc/roadshow.html |title=Anthropological Studies Center (ASC) |publisher=Sonoma.edu |accessdate=5 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090328003841/http://www.sonoma.edu/asc/roadshow.html| archivedate= 28 March 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"archaeological\">{{citation | author = Schiffer M.

This episode first aired in the [[United States]] on Sunday, July 29, 2007.\n\n==Plot synopsis==\nA sidewalk fruit vendor, Sinjay ([[Aziz Ansari]]), refuses Bret and Jemaine service due to the fact that they are New Zealanders. He disinfects the fruit they touch, and they leave empty handed.\n\nThey visit the consulate for a band meeting, where Bret is clearly upset about the incident. There they meet Jessica (Joan Hess), the pretty blonde tech support lady who is upgrading the consulate's computers from aging [[Commodore VIC-20]]s to newer [[IBM PC]]s. After she leaves, Murray tells the band that he is in love with her. Bret asks Murray about his wife, Shelley, and Murray reminds them that they are separated. Bret receives a package from home &mdash; his favorite cardboard box &mdash; and Murray lends them a [[Videotape|tape]] of New Zealand TV shows that he received from his mother.\n\nAt their apartment, the pair discuss the incident while they watch some of the recorded shows on Murray's tape. One of the shows is episode six of a children's program called ''\"Albi The Racist Dragon\"''. Bret, still upset about the vendor's attitude, watches from the comfort of his cardboard box.\n\nAt Mohumbhai & Son, Bret and Jemaine consult Dave about the racism they experienced. Dave informs them of the great amount of \"prejudism\" against the [[English people|English]] that exists in America. Ignoring their insistence that they are not English, Dave admits that even he hates them sometimes. A montage of scenes follow in which we see Jemaine and Bret being jostled on the street, being denied entry to a nightclub, getting cheated by a hot dog vendor, and being forced to ride at the back of a bus.\n\nThey try once more to buy fruit from Sinjay but are chased off again. The frustrated pair ride off on their bicycles singing ''\"''Mutha Uckas''\"''.\n\nAt another band meeting, Murray fakes a computer problem in order to see Jessica again. He asks the band to help him with a love song he is writing for her (so far he has written one word &mdash; \"Hi\" &mdash; which Jemaine admits is better than he expected).\n\nBack at their place, Bret, Jemaine and Dave try to come up with ideas for dealing with Sinjay. Dave suggests that they frame him for murder by poisoning his fruit, but settles for merely teaching Bret and Jemaine how to \"[[Finger (gesture)|flip the bird]]\".\n\nAfter Sinjay escalates the conflict by nailing a kiwi fruit to their door, the boys storm to his fruit stand to confront him. They furiously flip him the bird and chastise him for his racism. However they soon realize that he has New Zealanders and Australians mixed up, and it is actually Australians that he hates. Realizing his mistake, the vendor apologizes and gives them some free fruit.\n\nBack at the consulate, Murray learns from Greg that Jessica is gone, as her upgrade work is complete. A despondent Murray sings \"Leggy Blonde\" to his lost love.\n\nOver the end credits, we see shots of Bret, Jemaine and Sinjay flipping the bird to the guard at the Australian consulate.\n\n==Notes==\n\n* We learn that Murray is married, which explains the wedding ring that he has been wearing in the preceding episodes.\n* We discover that Dave is of [[India]]n descent, as is [[Arj Barker]], the actor who plays him.\n* This is the only episode of the series in which [[Kristen Schaal]] (Mel) does not appear.\n\n==Songs==\n[[Image:Conchords 107 Drive By Albi.jpg|thumb|right|Titles of fictitious program ''Albi''.]]\n\nThe following songs are featured in this episode:\n\n=== \"Albi the Racist Dragon\" ===\n\n\"Albi the Racist Dragon\", sung by Jemaine, concerns the eponymous dragon's persecution by an angry mob and subsequent redemption, through the companionship of one of his victims, a \"badly-burned [[Albanians|Albanian]] boy.\"  It is mostly spoken word set to an [[Animation|animated]] sequence in a children's TV style.

She accepts the assistance of a stranger wearing a priest's collar and driving a truck and is horrified to discover that she has fallen into a trap. The man, who introduces himself as Caleb, terrifies her and burns his mark into her neck. He gives her a message for the Slayer (which the viewer does not hear at this time), stabs her in the stomach, and forces her out of the car. Minutes later, Faith and Willow find the girl on their way back to Sunnydale after [[Orpheus (Angel)|re-ensouling Angel in Los Angeles]] and take her to the hospital.\n\nAt his apartment, Xander's erotic dream about the teenage Potentials is cut short when the girls wake him up to fix the toilet.\n\nAt the hospital, Faith asks Willow why the Scooby Gang failed to warn her about the threat of the Bringers. Faith subsequently encounters Spike chasing a young woman and mistakenly believes Spike is evil again. The young woman, now in her vampire form, attacks Faith, who (borrowing a stake from Buffy) quickly slays her.\n\nBack at the house, Faith encounters a cold reception from both Dawn and Giles, and Spike explains that the tension is not all because of her. Meanwhile, the [[First Evil]] reveals Buffy's form to Caleb who is residing in the basement of a winery.\n\nThe next day, Andrew tries to bring the interested Potentials up to speed on Faith's history. While they are quick to point out that Faith had [[Graduation Day (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|killed]] a [[Volcanology|volcanologist]], not a [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]], they watch Faith exercise in the back yard with fascination over this other Slayer.\n\nAt Sunnydale High School, Robin calls Buffy into his office where he fires her from her school job, emphasizing the need for her to focus on the mission.\n\nIn the Summers' home, Faith sneaks down into the basement to smoke a cigarette and have a moment away from the \"wanna-bes\" who, in her opinion, have way too much energy and are needy for more stories from her about her life. Spike sees her and also asks for a cigarette. She and Spike talk, and bond over their respective periods of being dangerous. Faith reveals they met once before years ago [[Who Are You (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|when Faith was in Buffy's body]], and Spike reveals that he and Buffy had been more than just friends at one point. Buffy, having been fired by Principal Wood so she can focus more on the mission at hand, comes down and seems a bit unnerved at seeing the two of them so cozy. Dawn calls down that Willow has reported from the hospital: Shannon is awake. Buffy goes to the hospital, where Shannon tells Buffy of Caleb's message: he has something of Buffy's.\n\nLater at the house, Buffy tries to motivate the terrified Potentials to accompany her when she attacks Caleb (who, meanwhile, is re-enacting scenes of his past murders with the First Evil). Buffy alone is confident in her plan; Giles, Spike, her friends, and the Potentials all question her decision. Buffy and Faith, on a recon mission, follow a Bringer through the woods. They discuss Faith's intentions and her recent experiences with Angel before locating Caleb's stronghold in an old winery.\n\nAt the Summers' home, Xander directs the Potentials on the methods of attacking in battle. When Rona criticizes Buffy's intentions, Xander strongly defends his friend. Leaving Willow and Giles to stay behind to protect the more inexperienced girls, Buffy leads Spike, Faith, Xander, and the more experienced Potentials (including Kennedy, Molly, Rona, Chao-Ahn, Amanda, Diane, and several others) to the vineyard; they divide into two groups: an assault team and a back-up team. After an initial clash with the Bringers, Caleb appears. He has super-strength: he quickly knocks aside Buffy and Spike, and breaks Rona's arm. Xander and Faith arrive with the back-up team, but Faith is soon knocked unconscious. Caleb kills Diane and Molly, and Buffy orders a retreat after managing to knock Caleb down. Xander starts to yell that everyone needs to get out, but is then attacked himself by Caleb. Caleb says \"So, you're the one who sees everything? Let's see what we can do about that.\" He stabs his thumb into Xander's eye as Xander screams. Spike tackles Caleb, giving them enough time to get Xander and leave the vineyard.\n\nAlone and distraught, Buffy leaves the injured girls and walks through the empty streets as Caleb tells the First, in Buffy's form, that their victory is imminent.\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Buffy the Vampire Slayer#Dirty Girls|Dirty Girls}}\n* {{imdb episode|0533413}}\n* {{tv.com episode|buffy-the-vampire-slayer/dirty-girls-232624}}\n\n{{Buffy episodes}}\n\n[[Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 7) episodes]]\n[[Category:2003 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Television episodes written by Drew Goddard]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{unreferenced|date=September 2016}}\n{{short lead|date=July 2019}}\n{{All plot|date=July 2019}}\n{{Notability|date=July 2019}}\n}}\n{{Infobox television episode\n| title=Dirty Girls\n\n| caption=Faith returns to Sunnydale to help Buffy in the fight against The First Evil and Caleb\n| series=[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]\n| season=7\n| episode=18\n| airdate=April 15, 2003\n| production=7ABB18\n| writer=[[Drew Goddard]]\n| director=[[Michael Gershman (director)|Michael Gershman]]\n| guests=*[[Anthony Head|Anthony Stewart Head]] as [[Rupert Giles]]\n*[[Eliza Dushku]] as [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]]\n*[[Nathan Fillion]] as [[Caleb (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Caleb]]\n*[[Tom Lenk]] as [[Andrew Wells]]\n*[[Iyari Limon]] as [[Kennedy (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kennedy]]\n*[[Indigo (actress)|Indigo]] as [[List of minor Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters#Rona|Rona]]\n*[[Clara Bryant]] as [[List of minor Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters#Molly|Molly]]\n*[[Sarah Hagan]] as [[List of minor Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters#Amanda|Amanda]]\n*[[Kristy Wu]] as [[List of minor Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters#Chao-Ahn|Chao-Ahn]]\n*[[D.

[[Paul J. Griffiths]] notes: \"Recent Catholic thought on purgatory typically preserves the essentials of the basic doctrine while also offering second-hand speculative interpretations of these elements\".<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1XYXMTe1jYC&pg=PA436&dq=Griffiths+purgatory+second-order&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi42pv2wNHfAhWyQxUIHZV2A14Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=Griffiths%20purgatory%20second-order&f=false |author=Paul J.

Rather it is the inwardly necessary process of transformation in which a person becomes capable of Christ, capable of God, and thus capable of unity with the whole communion of saints\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AfomsX5KtYkC&pg=PA230&dq=supra-worldly+concentration#v=onepage&q=supra-worldly%20concentration&f=false |author=Joseph Ratzinger |title=Eschatology: Death and Eternal Life |publisher=CUA Press |year=2007 |p=230|isbn=9780813215167 }}</ref>\n\nThe speculations and popular imaginings that, especially in late medieval times, were common in the Western or [[Latin Church]] have not necessarily found acceptance in the [[eastern Catholic Churches]], of which there are 23 in [[full communion]] with the Pope. Some have explicitly rejected the notions of punishment by fire in a particular place that are prominent in the popular picture of purgatory. The representatives of the [[Orthodox Church]] at the [[Council of Florence]] argued against these notions, while declaring that they do hold that there is a cleansing after death of the souls of the saved and that these are assisted by the prayers of the living: \"If souls depart from this life in faith and charity but marked with some defilements, whether unrepented minor ones or major ones repented of but without having yet borne the fruits of repentance, we believe that within reason they are purified of those faults, but not by some purifying fire and particular punishments in some place.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/patrologiaorient15pariuoft/page/40 \"First Speech by Mark, Archbishop of Ephesus, on Purifying Fire\" in ''Patrologia Orientalis'', vol. 15, pp. 40\u201341]</ref> The definition of purgatory adopted by that council excluded the two notions with which the Orthodox disagreed and mentioned only the two points that, they said, were part of their faith also. Accordingly, the agreement, known as the [[Union of Brest]], that formalized the admission of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] into the full [[communion (Christian)|communion]] of the Roman Catholic Church stated: \"We shall not debate about purgatory, but we entrust ourselves to the teaching of the Holy Church\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1595brest.html|title=Treaty of Brest, Article 5|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Fire====\nFire has an important place in the popular image of purgatory and has been the object of speculation by theologians, speculation to which the article on purgatory in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' relates the warning by the Council of Trent against \"difficult and subtle questions which tend not to edification.\"<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia on Purgatory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12575a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Purgatory|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref>\n\nFire has never been included in the Catholic Church's defined doctrine on purgatory, but speculation about it is traditional. \"The tradition of the Church, by reference to certain texts of Scripture, speaks of a cleansing fire.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2N.HTM#$1BW Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1031]</ref> In this regard the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' references in particular two New Testament passages: \"If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire\"<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Corinthians|3:15|ESV}}</ref> and \"so that the tested genuineness of your faith\u2014more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire\u2014may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ\".<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Peter|1:7|ESV}}</ref> Catholic theologians have also cited verses such as \"I will put this third into the fire, and refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested.

But again do you want to be left behind in the fire on account of the ''hay'', the ''wood'', the ''stubble'', and to receive nothing due you for the ''gold'' and the ''silver'' and ''precious stone''?

Thus the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]] considered it probable that purgatory was situated close to hell, so that the same fire that tormented the damned cleansed the just souls in purgatory.<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.AP2_Q1_A2.html ''Summa Theologica'', appendix 2, article 2: \"Whether it is the same place where souls are cleansed, and the damned punished?\"]</ref>\n\nIdeas about the supposed fire of purgatory have changed with time: in the early 20th century the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' reported that, while in the past most theologians had held that the fire of purgatory was in some sense a material fire, though of a nature different from ordinary fire, the view of what then seemed to be the majority of theologians was that the term was to be understood metaphorically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm#VI|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Hell|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref>\n\n[[Pope Benedict XVI]] recommended to theologians the presentation of purgatory by Saint [[Catherine of Genoa]], for whom purgatory is not an external but an inner fire: \"The Saint speaks of the soul's journey of purification on the way to full communion with God, starting from her own experience of profound sorrow for the sins committed, in comparison with God's infinite love. [...] 'The soul', Catherine says, 'presents itself to God still bound to the desires and suffering that derive from sin and this makes it impossible for it to enjoy the [[beatific vision]] of God'. Catherine asserts that God is so pure and holy that a soul stained by sin cannot be in the presence of the divine majesty. We too feel how distant we are, how full we are of so many things that we cannot see God. The soul is aware of the immense love and perfect justice of God and consequently suffers for having failed to respond in a correct and perfect way to this love; and love for God itself becomes a flame, love itself cleanses it from the residue of sin.\"<ref>[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2011/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20110112.html Pope Benedict XVI, General Audience of 12 January 2011]</ref>\n\nIn his 2007 encyclical ''Spe salvi'', Pope Benedict XVI, referring to the words of [[Paul the Apostle]] in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|3:12\u201315|ESV}} about a fire that both burns and saves, spoke of the opinion that \"the fire which both burns and saves is Christ himself, the Judge and Saviour. The encounter with him is the decisive act of judgement. Before his gaze all falsehood melts away. This encounter with him, as it burns us, transforms and frees us, allowing us to become truly ourselves. All that we build during our lives can prove to be mere straw, pure bluster, and it collapses. Yet in the pain of this encounter, when the impurity and sickness of our lives become evident to us, there lies salvation. His gaze, the touch of his heart heals us through an undeniably painful transformation 'as through fire'. But it is a blessed pain, in which the holy power of his love sears through us like a flame, enabling us to become totally ourselves and thus totally of God. In this way the inter-relation between justice and grace also becomes clear: the way we live our lives is not immaterial, but our defilement does not stain us for ever if we have at least continued to reach out towards Christ, towards truth and towards love. Indeed, it has already been burned away through Christ's Passion.

Above the mountain St Patrick introduces the prayers of the faithful that can help attenuate the sufferings of the souls undergoing purification. In each opening, sinners are tormented by demons and by fire. Each of the seven deadly sins \u2013 avarice, envy, sloth, pride, anger, lust, and gluttony \u2013 has its own region of purgatory and its own appropriate tortures. \n\n[[File:Dante03.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dante gazes at purgatory (shown as a mountain) in this 16th-century painting.]]\nLe Goff dedicates the final chapter of his book to the ''Purgatorio'', the second book in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s fourteenth-century ''[[The Divine Comedy|La divina commedia]]'' (''The Divine Comedy''). In an interview Le Goff declared: \"Dante's ''Purgatorio'' represents the sublime conclusion of the slow development of Purgatory that took place in the course of the Middle Ages. The power of Dante's poetry made a decisive contribution to fixing in the public imagination this 'third place', whose birth was on the whole quite recent.\"<ref>[https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2005/09/27/invenzione-del-purgatorio.html Fabio Gambaro, \"L'invenzione del purgatorio\" in ''La Repubblica'', 27 September 2005]</ref>\n\nDante pictures purgatory as an island at the [[antipodes]] of Jerusalem, pushed up, in an otherwise empty sea, by the displacement caused by the fall of Satan, which left him fixed at the central point of the globe of the Earth. The cone-shaped island has seven terraces on which souls are cleansed from the [[seven deadly sins]] or capital vices as they ascend. Additional spurs at the base hold those for whom beginning the ascent is delayed because in life they were excommunicates, indolent or late repenters. At the summit is the [[Garden of Eden|earthly paradise]], from where the souls, cleansed of evil tendencies and made perfect, are taken to heaven.\n\nThe Catholic Church has not included in its teaching this idea of purgatory as a place, any more than it has sealed with its authority the idea of a [[Limbo]], which also has been postulated by some theologians.\n\nOn 4 August 1999, [[Pope John Paul II]], speaking of purgatory, said: \"The term does not indicate a place, but a condition of existence. Those who, after death, exist in a state of purification, are already in the love of Christ who removes from them the remnants of imperfection as \"a condition of existence\".<ref name=\"Audience of 4 August 1999\"/>\n\nSimilarly in 2011, [[Pope Benedict XVI]], speaking of Saint [[Catherine of Genoa]] (1447\u20131510) in relation to purgatory, said that \"In her day it was depicted mainly using images linked to space: a certain space was conceived of in which purgatory was supposed to be located.

According to the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]]:\n\n<blockquote>The moral progress of the soul, either for better or for worse, ends at the very moment of the separation of the body and soul; at that very moment the definite destiny of the soul in the everlasting life is decided. ...There is no way of repentance, no way of escape, no reincarnation and no help from the outside world. Its place is decided forever by its Creator and judge. The Orthodox Church does not believe in purgatory (a place of purging), that is, the inter-mediate state after death in which the souls of the saved (those who have not received temporal punishment for their sins) are purified of all taint preparatory to entering into Heaven, where every soul is perfect and fit to see God. Also, the Orthodox Church does not believe in indulgences as remissions from purgatorial punishment. Both purgatory and indulgences are inter-corelated theories, unwitnessed in the Bible or in the Ancient Church, and when they were enforced and applied they brought about evil practices at the expense of the prevailing Truths of the Church. If Almighty God in His merciful loving-kindness changes the dreadful situation of the sinner, it is unknown to the Church of Christ. The Church lived for fifteen hundred years without such a theory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7076|title=Death, the Threshold to Eternal Life - Liturgy & Worship - Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|website=www.goarch.org}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nEastern Orthodox teaching is that, while all undergo an [[particular judgment|individual judgment]] immediately after death, neither the just nor the wicked attain the final state of bliss or punishment before the Last Day,<ref>John Meyondorff, ''Byzantine Theology'' (London: Mowbrays, 1974) pp. 220\u2013221. \"At death man's body goes to the earth from which it was taken, and the soul, being immortal, goes to God, who gave it.

Many Protestant denominations, though not all, teach the doctrine of ''[[sola scriptura]]'' (\"scripture alone\") or ''[[prima scriptura]]'' (\"scripture first\"). The general Protestant view is that the Bible, from which Protestants exclude [[deuterocanonical books]] such as [[2 Maccabees]], contains no overt, explicit discussion of purgatory and therefore it should be rejected as an unbiblical belief.<ref>Robert L. Millet, ''By what Authority?: The Vital Question of Religious Authority in Christianity'' (Mercer University, 2010), 66.</ref>\n\nAnother view held by many Protestants, such as the [[Lutheran Church]]es and the [[Reformed Church]]es, is ''[[sola fide]]'' (\"by faith alone\"): that faith alone is what achieves [[salvation]], and that good works are merely ''evidence'' of that faith.<ref>Alan Richardson, John Bowden, eds, ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology'' (Westminster John Knox, 1983), s.v. sola fide, 545.</ref> Justification is generally seen as a discrete event that takes place once for all during one's lifetime, not the result of a transformation of character.

Rather his basic argument is that, in a phrase he often uses, it \"makes sense.\"<ref>For example, Walls,  2012, p. 71</ref> For Walls, purgatory has a [[logic]], as in the title of his book. He documents the \"contrast between the satisfaction and sanctification models\" of purgatory. In the satisfaction model, \"the punishment of purgatory\" is to satisfy God's justice. In the sanctification model, Wall writes: \"Purgatory might be pictured ... as a regimen to regain one\u2019s spiritual health and get back into moral shape.\"<ref>Walls, 2012, pp. 76, 90.</ref> In Catholic theology Walls finds that the doctrine of purgatory has \"swung\" between the \"poles of satisfaction and sanctification\" sometimes \"combining both elements somewhere in the middle\". He believes the sanctification model \"can be affirmed by Protestants without in any way contradicting their theology\" and that they may find that it \"makes better sense of how the remains of sin are purged\" than an instantaneous cleansing at the moment of death.<ref>Walls 2012, p. 90</ref>\n\nWhile purgatory was disputed by the Reformers, some early patristic theologians of the Eastern Church taught and believed in \"[[apocatastasis]]\", the belief that all creation would be restored to its original perfect condition after a remedial purgatorial reformation. [[Clement of Alexandria]] was one of the early church theologians who taught this view. Protestants have always contended that there are no second chances.

This place, called \"the spirit world,\" includes \"paradise\" for the righteous and \"prison\" for those who do not know God. Spirits in paradise serve as missionaries to the spirits in prison, who can still accept salvation. In this sense, spirit prison can be conceptualized as a type of purgatory. In addition to hearing the message from the missionary spirits, the spirits in prison can also accept posthumous baptism and other posthumous ordinances performed by living church members in temples on Earth. This is frequently referred to as \"baptism for the dead\" and \"temple work.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christiandataresources.com/mormonbeliefs2.htm|title=What Do Mormons Believe (The God Makers)?|website=www.christiandataresources.com}}</ref> Members of the Church believe that during the three days following Christ's crucifixion, he preached his gospel to inhabitants of spirit prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Spirit_Prison|title=Spirit Prison - The Encyclopedia of Mormonism|website=eom.byu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==Judaism==\nIn [[Judaism]], [[Gehenna]] is a place of purification where, according to some traditions, most sinners spend up to a year before release.\n\nThe view of purgatory can be found in the teaching of the Shammaites: \"In the last judgment day there shall be three classes of souls: the righteous shall at once be written down for the life everlasting; the wicked, for Gehenna; but those whose virtues and sins counterbalance one another shall go down to Gehenna and float up and down until they rise purified; for of them it is said: 'I will bring the third part into the fire and refine them as silver is refined, and try them as gold is tried' [Zech. xiii. 9.]; also, 'He [the Lord] bringeth down to Sheol and bringeth up again'\" (I Sam. ii. 6). The Hillelites seem to have had no purgatory; for they said: \"He who is 'plenteous in mercy' [Ex. xxxiv. 6.] inclines the balance toward mercy, and consequently the intermediates do not descend into Gehenna\" (Tosef., Sanh. xiii. 3; R. H. 16b; Bacher, \"Ag. Tan.\" i. 18). Still they also speak of an intermediate state.\n\nRegarding the time which purgatory lasts, the accepted opinion of R. Akiba is twelve months; according to R. Johanan b. Nuri, it is only forty-nine days. Both opinions are based upon Isa. lxvi. 23\u201324: \"From one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before Me, and they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against Me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched\"; the former interpreting the words \"from one new moon to another\" to signify all the months of a year; the latter interpreting the words \"from one Sabbath to another,\" in accordance with Lev. xxiii. 15\u201316, to signify seven weeks. During the twelve months, declares the baraita (Tosef., Sanh. xiii. 4\u20135; R. H. 16b), the souls of the wicked are judged, and after these twelve months are over they are consumed and transformed into ashes under the feet of the righteous (according to Mal. iii. 21 [A. V. iv. 3]), whereas the great seducers and blasphemers are to undergo eternal tortures in Gehenna without cessation (according to Isa. lxvi. 24).\n\nThe righteous, however, and, according to some, also the sinners among the people of Israel for whom Abraham intercedes because they bear the Abrahamic sign of the covenant are not harmed by the fire of Gehenna even when they are required to pass through the intermediate state of purgatory ('Er. 19b; \u1e24ag. 27a).<ref>\"There are three categories of men; the wholly pious and the arch-sinners are not purified, but only those between these two classes\" ([http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=115&letter=G Jewish Encyclopedia: Gehenna])</ref>\n\n[[Maimonides]] declares, in [[Jewish principles of faith#Maimonides' 13 principles of faith|his 13 principles of faith]], that the descriptions of Gehenna, as a place of punishment in rabbinic literature, were pedagocically motivated inventions to encourage respect of the [[Torah]] commandements by mankind, which had been regarded as immature.<ref name=\"perek-helek-d\">Maimonides\u2019 Introduction to Perek Helek, publ. and transl. by [[Maimonides Heritage Center]], p. 3\u20134.</ref> Instead of being sent to Gehenna, the souls of the wicked would actually get annihilated.<ref name=\"perek-helek-c\">Maimonides\u2019 Introduction to Perek Helek, publ. and transl. by [[Maimonides Heritage Center]], p. 22-23.</ref>\n\n== Islam ==\n{{main article|Barzakh}}\nIslam has a concept similar to that of purgatory in Christianity.

The representatives of the [[Orthodox Church]] at the [[Council of Florence]] argued against these notions, while declaring that they do hold that there is a cleansing after death of the souls of the saved and that these are assisted by the prayers of the living: \"If souls depart from this life in faith and charity but marked with some defilements, whether unrepented minor ones or major ones repented of but without having yet borne the fruits of repentance, we believe that within reason they are purified of those faults, but not by some purifying fire and particular punishments in some place.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/patrologiaorient15pariuoft/page/40 \"First Speech by Mark, Archbishop of Ephesus, on Purifying Fire\" in ''Patrologia Orientalis'', vol. 15, pp. 40\u201341]</ref> The definition of purgatory adopted by that council excluded the two notions with which the Orthodox disagreed and mentioned only the two points that, they said, were part of their faith also.

[...] 'The soul', Catherine says, 'presents itself to God still bound to the desires and suffering that derive from sin and this makes it impossible for it to enjoy the [[beatific vision]] of God'. Catherine asserts that God is so pure and holy that a soul stained by sin cannot be in the presence of the divine majesty. We too feel how distant we are, how full we are of so many things that we cannot see God. The soul is aware of the immense love and perfect justice of God and consequently suffers for having failed to respond in a correct and perfect way to this love; and love for God itself becomes a flame, love itself cleanses it from the residue of sin.\"<ref>[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2011/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20110112.html Pope Benedict XVI, General Audience of 12 January 2011]</ref>\n\nIn his 2007 encyclical ''Spe salvi'', Pope Benedict XVI, referring to the words of [[Paul the Apostle]] in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|3:12\u201315|ESV}} about a fire that both burns and saves, spoke of the opinion that \"the fire which both burns and saves is Christ himself, the Judge and Saviour. The encounter with him is the decisive act of judgement. Before his gaze all falsehood melts away. This encounter with him, as it burns us, transforms and frees us, allowing us to become truly ourselves. All that we build during our lives can prove to be mere straw, pure bluster, and it collapses. Yet in the pain of this encounter, when the impurity and sickness of our lives become evident to us, there lies salvation. His gaze, the touch of his heart heals us through an undeniably painful transformation 'as through fire'. But it is a blessed pain, in which the holy power of his love sears through us like a flame, enabling us to become totally ourselves and thus totally of God. In this way the inter-relation between justice and grace also becomes clear: the way we live our lives is not immaterial, but our defilement does not stain us for ever if we have at least continued to reach out towards Christ, towards truth and towards love. Indeed, it has already been burned away through Christ's Passion. At the moment of judgement we experience and we absorb the overwhelming power of his love over all the evil in the world and in ourselves. The pain of love becomes our salvation and our joy. It is clear that we cannot calculate the 'duration' of this transforming burning in terms of the chronological measurements of this world. The transforming 'moment' of this encounter eludes earthly time-reckoning \u2014 it is the heart's time, it is the time of 'passage' to communion with God in the Body of Christ.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20071130_spe-salvi_en.html Encyclical ''Spe salvi''], 46\u201347].</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Peter Paul Rubens 172.jpg | Purgatory, by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]\nFile:Concepcion Santa Cruz 09.jpg | Altar in [[Iglesia de la Concepci\u00f3n (Santa Cruz de Tenerife)|Iglesia de la Concepci\u00f3n]], [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]\nFile:Folio 113v - Purgatory.jpg | A fiery purgatory in the ''[[Tr\u00e8s riches heures du Duc de Berry]]''\nFile:V.Carmen de Beniajan-general.jpg | [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] and purgatory, [[Beniaj\u00e1n]], [[Spain]]\nFile:LadyOfMtCarmelWithSufferingSouls.jpg | [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] and purgatory, [[North End, Boston]]\nFile:Auhausen St. Maria 473gf.JPG | Detail of altar in Lutheran church in [[Auhausen]], [[Bavaria]]\nFile:AMR Kirche - Altar 3.jpg | Our Lady, St Monica and souls in purgatory, [[Rattenberg]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]\nFile:Kientzheim StFelix 30.JPG | Our Lady of Passau in St Felix Church, [[Kientzheim]], [[Alsace]]\nFile:Heidelberg cpg 144 Els\u00e4ssische Legenda Aurea 338r St. Patricks Fegefeuer.jpg | Purgatory, 1419 drawing by unknown artist from [[Strasbourg]]\nFile:Michel-Serre-Vierge \u00e0 l'enfant et le purgatoire.jpg | Painting by [[Michel Serre]] in the Saint Cannat Church, [[Marseilles]]\nFile:Wimpfen-stadtkirche-predell.jpg |Altar predella in the town church of [[Bad Wimpfen]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\nFile:Mantlach - Velburg NM 002.JPG | Request for prayer for the souls in purgatory\nFile:Catedral de San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico - DSC06866.JPG | Stained-glass window in [[Puerto Rico]] Cathedral\nFile:Cristobal Rojas 46a.JPG | Purgatory by Venezuelan painter [[Crist\u00f3bal Rojas (artist)|Crist\u00f3bal Rojas]] (1890)\nFile:St.Ulrich am Pillersee - Deckenfresko 1a.jpg | Ceiling of St Ulrich Church in [[Pillersee]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], Austria\nFile:Andrea Vaccaro - The Virgin intercedes for the Souls in Purgatory.jpg |Our Lady Interceding for the Souls in Purgatory, by [[Andrea Vaccaro]]\nFile:Stephan Lochner Souls in Purgatory.jpg | Miniature by [[Stefan Lochner]] showing souls in purgatory\nFile:\u00c1nimas Benditas.jpg | [[Azulejo]] of souls in purgatory, [[Seville]], [[Spain]]\n</gallery>\n\n==== Popular notion of purgatory as a place ====\n[[File:William Frederick Wakeman Lough Derg.png|thumb|The island of St Patrick's Purgatory]]\nIn his ''La naissance du Purgatoire'' (''The Birth of Purgatory''), [[Jacques Le Goff]] attributes the origin of the idea of a third other-world domain, similar to heaven and hell, called Purgatory, to Paris intellectuals and [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]] at some point in the last three decades of the twelfth century, possibly as early as 1170\u22121180.

Above the mountain St Patrick introduces the prayers of the faithful that can help attenuate the sufferings of the souls undergoing purification. In each opening, sinners are tormented by demons and by fire. Each of the seven deadly sins \u2013 avarice, envy, sloth, pride, anger, lust, and gluttony \u2013 has its own region of purgatory and its own appropriate tortures. \n\n[[File:Dante03.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dante gazes at purgatory (shown as a mountain) in this 16th-century painting.]]\nLe Goff dedicates the final chapter of his book to the ''Purgatorio'', the second book in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s fourteenth-century ''[[The Divine Comedy|La divina commedia]]'' (''The Divine Comedy''). In an interview Le Goff declared: \"Dante's ''Purgatorio'' represents the sublime conclusion of the slow development of Purgatory that took place in the course of the Middle Ages. The power of Dante's poetry made a decisive contribution to fixing in the public imagination this 'third place', whose birth was on the whole quite recent.\"<ref>[https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2005/09/27/invenzione-del-purgatorio.html Fabio Gambaro, \"L'invenzione del purgatorio\" in ''La Repubblica'', 27 September 2005]</ref>\n\nDante pictures purgatory as an island at the [[antipodes]] of Jerusalem, pushed up, in an otherwise empty sea, by the displacement caused by the fall of Satan, which left him fixed at the central point of the globe of the Earth. The cone-shaped island has seven terraces on which souls are cleansed from the [[seven deadly sins]] or capital vices as they ascend. Additional spurs at the base hold those for whom beginning the ascent is delayed because in life they were excommunicates, indolent or late repenters. At the summit is the [[Garden of Eden|earthly paradise]], from where the souls, cleansed of evil tendencies and made perfect, are taken to heaven.\n\nThe Catholic Church has not included in its teaching this idea of purgatory as a place, any more than it has sealed with its authority the idea of a [[Limbo]], which also has been postulated by some theologians.\n\nOn 4 August 1999, [[Pope John Paul II]], speaking of purgatory, said: \"The term does not indicate a place, but a condition of existence.

Its place is decided forever by its Creator and judge. The Orthodox Church does not believe in purgatory (a place of purging), that is, the inter-mediate state after death in which the souls of the saved (those who have not received temporal punishment for their sins) are purified of all taint preparatory to entering into Heaven, where every soul is perfect and fit to see God. Also, the Orthodox Church does not believe in indulgences as remissions from purgatorial punishment. Both purgatory and indulgences are inter-corelated theories, unwitnessed in the Bible or in the Ancient Church, and when they were enforced and applied they brought about evil practices at the expense of the prevailing Truths of the Church. If Almighty God in His merciful loving-kindness changes the dreadful situation of the sinner, it is unknown to the Church of Christ. The Church lived for fifteen hundred years without such a theory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7076|title=Death, the Threshold to Eternal Life - Liturgy & Worship - Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|website=www.goarch.org}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nEastern Orthodox teaching is that, while all undergo an [[particular judgment|individual judgment]] immediately after death, neither the just nor the wicked attain the final state of bliss or punishment before the Last Day,<ref>John Meyondorff, ''Byzantine Theology'' (London: Mowbrays, 1974) pp. 220\u2013221. \"At death man's body goes to the earth from which it was taken, and the soul, being immortal, goes to God, who gave it.

Millet, ''By what Authority?: The Vital Question of Religious Authority in Christianity'' (Mercer University, 2010), 66.</ref>\n\nAnother view held by many Protestants, such as the [[Lutheran Church]]es and the [[Reformed Church]]es, is ''[[sola fide]]'' (\"by faith alone\"): that faith alone is what achieves [[salvation]], and that good works are merely ''evidence'' of that faith.<ref>Alan Richardson, John Bowden, eds, ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology'' (Westminster John Knox, 1983), s.v. sola fide, 545.</ref> Justification is generally seen as a discrete event that takes place once for all during one's lifetime, not the result of a transformation of character. However, most Protestants teach that a transformation of character naturally follows the salvation experience; others, such as those of the [[Methodist]] tradition (inclusive of the [[Holiness Movement]]) teach that after justification, Christians must pursue holiness and good works.<ref name=\"Jones2002\">{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Scott J.|title=United Methodist Doctrine|year=2002|publisher=Abingdon Press|isbn=9780687034857|page=190|quote=Faith is necessary to salvation unconditionally.

Rather his basic argument is that, in a phrase he often uses, it \"makes sense.\"<ref>For example, Walls,  2012, p. 71</ref> For Walls, purgatory has a [[logic]], as in the title of his book. He documents the \"contrast between the satisfaction and sanctification models\" of purgatory. In the satisfaction model, \"the punishment of purgatory\" is to satisfy God's justice. In the sanctification model, Wall writes: \"Purgatory might be pictured ... as a regimen to regain one\u2019s spiritual health and get back into moral shape.\"<ref>Walls, 2012, pp. 76, 90.</ref> In Catholic theology Walls finds that the doctrine of purgatory has \"swung\" between the \"poles of satisfaction and sanctification\" sometimes \"combining both elements somewhere in the middle\". He believes the sanctification model \"can be affirmed by Protestants without in any way contradicting their theology\" and that they may find that it \"makes better sense of how the remains of sin are purged\" than an instantaneous cleansing at the moment of death.<ref>Walls 2012, p. 90</ref>\n\nWhile purgatory was disputed by the Reformers, some early patristic theologians of the Eastern Church taught and believed in \"[[apocatastasis]]\", the belief that all creation would be restored to its original perfect condition after a remedial purgatorial reformation. [[Clement of Alexandria]] was one of the early church theologians who taught this view. Protestants have always contended that there are no second chances.

This is frequently referred to as \"baptism for the dead\" and \"temple work.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christiandataresources.com/mormonbeliefs2.htm|title=What Do Mormons Believe (The God Makers)?|website=www.christiandataresources.com}}</ref> Members of the Church believe that during the three days following Christ's crucifixion, he preached his gospel to inhabitants of spirit prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Spirit_Prison|title=Spirit Prison - The Encyclopedia of Mormonism|website=eom.byu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==Judaism==\nIn [[Judaism]], [[Gehenna]] is a place of purification where, according to some traditions, most sinners spend up to a year before release.\n\nThe view of purgatory can be found in the teaching of the Shammaites: \"In the last judgment day there shall be three classes of souls: the righteous shall at once be written down for the life everlasting; the wicked, for Gehenna; but those whose virtues and sins counterbalance one another shall go down to Gehenna and float up and down until they rise purified; for of them it is said: 'I will bring the third part into the fire and refine them as silver is refined, and try them as gold is tried' [Zech. xiii. 9.]; also, 'He [the Lord] bringeth down to Sheol and bringeth up again'\" (I Sam. ii. 6). The Hillelites seem to have had no purgatory; for they said: \"He who is 'plenteous in mercy' [Ex. xxxiv. 6.] inclines the balance toward mercy, and consequently the intermediates do not descend into Gehenna\" (Tosef., Sanh. xiii. 3; R. H. 16b; Bacher, \"Ag. Tan.\" i. 18). Still they also speak of an intermediate state.\n\nRegarding the time which purgatory lasts, the accepted opinion of R. Akiba is twelve months; according to R. Johanan b. Nuri, it is only forty-nine days. Both opinions are based upon Isa. lxvi. 23\u201324: \"From one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before Me, and they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against Me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched\"; the former interpreting the words \"from one new moon to another\" to signify all the months of a year; the latter interpreting the words \"from one Sabbath to another,\" in accordance with Lev. xxiii. 15\u201316, to signify seven weeks. During the twelve months, declares the baraita (Tosef., Sanh. xiii. 4\u20135; R. H. 16b), the souls of the wicked are judged, and after these twelve months are over they are consumed and transformed into ashes under the feet of the righteous (according to Mal. iii. 21 [A. V. iv. 3]), whereas the great seducers and blasphemers are to undergo eternal tortures in Gehenna without cessation (according to Isa. lxvi. 24).\n\nThe righteous, however, and, according to some, also the sinners among the people of Israel for whom Abraham intercedes because they bear the Abrahamic sign of the covenant are not harmed by the fire of Gehenna even when they are required to pass through the intermediate state of purgatory ('Er. 19b; \u1e24ag. 27a).<ref>\"There are three categories of men; the wholly pious and the arch-sinners are not purified, but only those between these two classes\" ([http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=115&letter=G Jewish Encyclopedia: Gehenna])</ref>\n\n[[Maimonides]] declares, in [[Jewish principles of faith#Maimonides' 13 principles of faith|his 13 principles of faith]], that the descriptions of Gehenna, as a place of punishment in rabbinic literature, were pedagocically motivated inventions to encourage respect of the [[Torah]] commandements by mankind, which had been regarded as immature.<ref name=\"perek-helek-d\">Maimonides\u2019 Introduction to Perek Helek, publ. and transl. by [[Maimonides Heritage Center]], p. 3\u20134.</ref> Instead of being sent to Gehenna, the souls of the wicked would actually get annihilated.<ref name=\"perek-helek-c\">Maimonides\u2019 Introduction to Perek Helek, publ. and transl. by [[Maimonides Heritage Center]], p. 22-23.</ref>\n\n== Islam ==\n{{main article|Barzakh}}\nIslam has a concept similar to that of purgatory in Christianity. [[Barzakh]] is thought to be a realm between paradise ([[Jannah]]) and hell ([[Jahannam]]) and according to [[Ghazali]] the place of those who go neither to hell or to heaven.<ref>BRILL ''Islam and Rationality: The Impact of al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b.
