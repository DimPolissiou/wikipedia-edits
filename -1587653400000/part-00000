When the identity of a certain taxon (or a genetic sequence in the case of DNA barcoding) is in doubt, the original specimen can be re-examined to review and ideally solve the issue. Voucher specimens should be clearly labelled as such, including a permanent voucher identifier that unambiguously connects the specimen with the DNA barcode data derived from it.

The airport is not crowded and basic facilities are available for users.\n\nPenang International Airport won the Best Emerging Airport (Asia) award in the 23rd annual Asian Freight and Supply Chain Awards 2009 (AFSCA), and was named the Airport of the Year (below 15 million passengers annually) in the 2009 Frost and Sullivan Asia Pacific Aerospace and Defence Awards.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Penang International Airport at night.jpg|left|thumb|Penang International Airport at night]]\nThe airport, then named Bayan Lepas International Airport, was completed in 1935, when [[Penang]] was part of the [[British crown colony]] of the [[Straits Settlements]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.skyscanner.co.in/airports/pen/penang-airport.html|title=Handy Penang airport information from Skyscanner|website=www.skyscanner.co.in|accessdate=23 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] attacked [[Penang]] in December 1941, the airport was one of the first places to be hit by Japanese air raids.<ref>{{cite book|title=Penang at War : A History of Penang During and Between the First and Second World Wars|last=Barber|first=Andrew|publisher=AB&A|year=2010}}</ref> The Japanese sought to neutralise the [[Royal Air Force|British]] and [[Royal Australian Air Force|Australian]] air force units by targeting all airfields in [[Penang]], including [[RMAF Butterworth|RAF Butterworth]] and the Bayan Lepas International Airport.\n\nIn the 1970s, a major expansion of the airport was carried out, during which a terminal building of Minangkabau architecture was built and the runway extended to accommodate [[Boeing 747]]<nowiki/>s, then the largest passenger jet aircraft.  Upon the completion of the expansion works in 1979, the airport was renamed Penang International Airport.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe airport was renovated between 2009 and 2013, giving the terminal building a major facelift. At present, Penang International Airport is run by the national airport operator, [[Malaysia Airports|Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad]] (MAHB).\n\n==Facilities==\n[[File:Penang airport checkin.jpg|thumb|Passenger check-in counters|left]]Penang International Airport has the capacity to handle up to 6.5 million passengers per year, while its cargo centre can handle 360,000 tonnes of cargo within the same annual period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiaairports.com.my/?m=business&c=business_about&id=18|title=International Airports|website=www.malaysiaairports.com.my|accessdate=23 September 2017}}</ref> Its two runways are about {{convert|3.35|km||abbr=on}} in total length.\n\nThe airport also has 64 check-in desks and 11 gates, 12 aerobridges and three luggage claim belts. The terminal building houses various restaurants, boutiques and shops, as well as premium passenger lounges.\n\nThe airport became a source of contention between the [[Government of Penang|Penang state government]] and the [[Government of Malaysia|Malaysian federal government]] in recent years, as transportation infrastructure throughout Malaysia falls under the purview of the latter authority. Calls by the Penang state government to expand the airport largely went unheeded by the Malaysian federal government, even though the airport has exceeded its maximum capacity of 6.5 million passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/guan-eng-demands-putrajaya-approve-penang-international-airport-expansion-n|title=Guan Eng demands Putrajaya approve

Dried chickpeas need a long cooking time (1\u20132 hours) but will easily fall apart when cooked longer. If soaked for 12\u201324 hours before use, cooking time can be shortened by around 30 minutes. Chickpeas can also be [[pressure cooked]] or ''[[sous vide]]'' cooked at {{convert|90|C}}.\n\nMature chickpeas can be cooked and eaten cold in [[salad]]s, cooked in [[stew]]s, ground into [[flour]], ground and shaped in balls and fried as ''[[falafel]]'', made into a batter and baked to make [[farinata|''farinata'' or ''cecina'']], or fried to make ''[[panelle]]''. Chickpea flour is known as ''[[gram flour]]'' or ''besan'' in South Asia and used frequently in [[South Asian cuisine]].\n\nIn [[Portugal]], chickpeas are one of the main ingredients in ''rancho'', eaten with pasta and meat or with rice. They are used in other hot dishes with ''[[bacalhau]]'' and in soups, meat stews, and salads mixed with tuna and vegetables, olive oil, vinegar, hot pepper and salt.

In South Asian cuisine the chickpea flour ([[Gram flour|besan]]) is used as a batter to coat vegetables before deep frying to make [[pakora]]s. The flour is also used as a batter to coat vegetables and meats before frying, or fried alone such as  ''panelle'' (little bread), a chickpea [[fritter]] from [[Sicily]]. Chickpea flour is used to make the Mediterranean flatbread ''[[socca]]'' and  called ''panisse'' in Provence, southern France. It is made of cooked chickpea flour, poured into saucers, allowed to set, cut in strips, and fried in olive oil, often eaten during Lent. In Tuscany chickpea flour (farina di ceci) is used to make an oven baked pancake: the flour is mixed with water, oil and salt.

This leads to higher nutrition values and fewer digestive problems in nonruminants. Nonruminant diets can be completed with 200 g/kg of raw chickpeas to promote egg production and growth of birds and pigs. Higher amounts can be used when chickpeas are treated with heat.<ref name= Bampidis/>\n\nExperiments have shown that ruminants grow equally well and produce an equal amount and quality of milk when soybean or cereal meals are replaced with chickpeas. Pigs show the same performance, but growing pigs experience a negative effect of raw chickpea feed; extruded chickpeas can increase performance even in growing pigs. In poultry diet experiments with untreated chickpeas, only young broilers (starting period) showed worse performance. Fish performed equally well when their soybean or cereal diet was replaced by extruded chickpeas.<ref name= Bampidis/> Chickpea seeds have also been used in rabbit diets.<ref name= \"fao\" />\n\nSecondary components of legumes\u2014such as [[lecithin]], [[polyphenols]], [[oligosaccharides]]; and [[amylase]], [[protease]], [[trypsin]] and [[chymotrypsin]] inhibitors\u2014can lead to lower nutrient availability, and thus to impaired growth and health of animals (especially in non[[ruminants]]). Ruminants have generally less trouble digesting legumes with secondary components, since they can inactivate them in the rumen liquor. Their diets can be supplemented by 300 g/kg or more raw chickpea seeds.<ref name= Bampidis/> However, protein digestibility and energy availability can be improved through treatments, such as germination, dehulling, and heat. Extrusion is a very good heat technique to destroy secondary components in legumes, since the proteins are irreversibly denatured. Overprocessing may decrease the nutritional value; extrusion leads to losses in minerals and vitamins, while dry heating does not change the chemical composition.<ref name= Bampidis/>\n\n==Nutrition==\n{{Infobox nutritional value\n|name=Chickpeas, mature seeds, cooked no salt\n|kJ=686\n|protein=8.86 g\n|fat=2.59 g\n|satfat=0.27 g\n|monofat=0.58 g\n|polyfat=1.16 g\n|carbs=27.42 g\n|sugars=4.8 g\n|fibre=7.6 g\n|sodium_mg=7\n|potassium_mg=291\n|vitA_ug=1\n|vitC_mg=1.3\n|thiamin_mg=0.12\n|riboflavin_mg=0.06\n|niacin_mg=0.53\n|pantothenic_mg=0.29\n|folate_ug=172\n|vitE_mg=0.35\n|vitK_ug=4\n|calcium_mg=49\n|iron_mg=2.89\n|phosphorus_mg=168\n|magnesium_mg=48\n|zinc_mg=1.53\n|vitB6_mg=0.14\n|vitB12_ug=0\n|water=60.21 g\n|source_usda=1\n|right=0}}\n{{Infobox nutritional value\n|name=Chickpeas, mature seeds, raw\n|kJ=1581\n|protein=20.47 g\n|fat=6.04 g\n|satfat=0.603\n|monofat=1.377\n|polyfat=2.731\n|carbs=62.95 g\n|sugars=10.7 g\n|fibre=12.2 g\n|sodium_mg=24\n|potassium_mg=718\n|vitA_ug=3\n|vitC_mg=4\n|thiamin_mg=0.477\n|riboflavin_mg=0.212\n|niacin_mg=1.541\n|pantothenic_mg=1.588\n|folate_ug=557\n|vitE_mg=0.82\n|vitK_ug=9\n|calcium_mg=57\n|copper_mg=0.656\n|iron_mg=4.31\n|manganese_mg=21.306 \t\n|magnesium_mg=79\n|phosphorus_mg=252\n|zinc_mg=2.76\n|vitB6_mg=0.535\n|vitB12_ug=0\n|water=60.21 g\n|source_usda=1\n|right=1}}\n\nChickpeas are a nutrient-dense food, providing rich content (20% or higher of the [[Daily Value]], DV) of [[protein]], [[dietary fiber]], [[folate]], and certain [[dietary minerals]], such as [[iron]] and [[phosphorus]] in a 100 gram reference amount (see adjacent nutrition table).

Thus, cooking can increase protein quality by inactivating or destroying heat-labile antinutritional factors.<ref name=El-Adawy /> Cooking also increases protein digestibility, essential amino acid index, and protein efficiency ratio. Although cooking lowers concentrations of amino acids such as tryptophan, lysine, total aromatic, and sulphur-containing amino acids, their contents are still higher than proposed by the FAO/WHO reference.<ref name=El-Adawy /> Diffusion of reducing sugars, raffinose, sucrose and others into cooking water reduces or completely removes these components.  Cooking also significantly reduces fat and mineral contents. The B vitamins riboflavin, thiamin, niacin, and pyridoxine dissolve into cooking water at differing rates.<ref name=El-Adawy />\n\n===Germination===\nGermination of chickpeas improves protein digestibility, although at a lower level than cooking. Germination degrades proteins to simple peptides, so improves crude protein, nonprotein nitrogen, and crude fiber content. Germination decreases lysine, tryptophan, sulphur and total aromatic amino acids, but most contents are still higher than proposed by the FAO/WHO reference pattern.<ref name=El-Adawy />\n\nOligosaccharides, such as stachyose and raffinose, are reduced in higher amounts during germination than during cooking. Minerals and [[B vitamins]] are retained more effectively during germination than with cooking. Phytic acids are reduced significantly, but trypsin inhibitor, tannin, and saponin reduction is less effective than cooking.<ref name=El-Adawy />\n\n===Autoclaving, microwave cooking, boiling===\nProtein digestibility is improved by all treatments of cooking. Essential amino acids are slightly increased by boiling and microwave cooking when compared to autoclaving and germination. Overall, microwave cooking leads to a significantly lower loss of nutrients compared to autoclaving and boiling.\n\nFinally, all treatments lead to an improved protein digestibility, protein efficiency ratio, and essential amino acid index. Microwave cooking seems to be an effective method to prepare chickpeas because of its improvement of nutritional values and its lower cooking time.<ref name=El-Adawy />\n\n===Leaves===\nIn some parts of the world, young chickpea leaves are consumed as cooked green vegetables.

Recent research has indicated that a combination of heat treatment along with the two vital micronutrients, phosphorus and nitrogen, are the most critical components to increasing the overall yield of ''Cicer arietinum''.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nPerennial chickpeas are a fundamental source of nutrition in animal feed as they are high sources of energy and protein for livestock. Unlike other food crops, the perennial chickpea shows a remarkable capacity to change its nutritional content in response to heat cultivation. Treating the chickpea with a constant heat source increases its protein content almost threefold.<ref name=\":1\">Bampidis, V.A. & Christodoulou, V. (2011). Chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.) in animal nutrition: A review.

Increasing the height and size of chickpea plants involves using micronutrient fertilization with varying doses of inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe level of phosphorus that a chickpea seed is exposed to during its lifecycle has a positive correlation relative to the height of the plant at full maturity.<ref name=\":0\">Mishra, U.S., Sirothia, P., & Bhadoria, U.S. (2009). Effects of phosphorus nutrition on growth and yield of chickpea (''Cicer arietinum'') under rain fed conditions. International Journal of Agricultural and Statistical Sciences, 5(1): 85\u201388.</ref> Increasing the levels of inorganic phosphorus at all doses incrementally increases the height of the chickpea plant. Thus, the seasonal changes in phosphorus soil content as well as periods of drought that are known to be a native characteristic of the dry [[Middle East|Middle-Eastern]] region where the chickpea is most commonly cultivated have a strong effect on the growth of the plant itself. Plant yield is also affected by a combination of phosphorus nutrition and water supply, resulting in a 12% increase in yield of the crop.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNitrogen nutrition is another factor that affects the yield of ''Cicer arietinum'', although the application itself differs from other perennial crops with regards to the levels administered on the plant. High doses of nitrogen inhibit the yield of the chickpea plant.<ref name=\":2\" /> Drought stress is a likely factor that also inhibits the uptake of nitrogen and subsequent fixation in the roots of ''Cicer arietinum''. The growth of the perennial chickpea is dependent on the balance between nitrogen fixation and assimilation that is also characteristic of many other agricultural plant types. The influence of drought stress, sowing date, and mineral nitrogen supply all have an effect on the yield and size of the plant, with trials showing that ''Cicer arietinum'' differed from other plant species in its capacity to assimilate mineral nitrogen supply from soil during drought stress.<ref name=\":2\">Wery, J., Deschamps, M., & Leger-Cresson, N.

Thus, cooking can increase protein quality by inactivating or destroying heat-labile antinutritional factors.<ref name=El-Adawy /> Cooking also increases protein digestibility, essential amino acid index, and protein efficiency ratio. Although cooking lowers concentrations of amino acids such as tryptophan, lysine, total aromatic, and sulphur-containing amino acids, their contents are still higher than proposed by the FAO/WHO reference.<ref name=El-Adawy /> Diffusion of reducing sugars, raffinose, sucrose and others into cooking water reduces or completely removes these components.  Cooking also significantly reduces fat and mineral contents. The B vitamins riboflavin, thiamin, niacin, and pyridoxine dissolve into cooking water at differing rates.<ref name=El-Adawy />\n\n===Germination===\nGermination of chickpeas improves protein digestibility, although at a lower level than cooking. Germination degrades proteins to simple peptides, so improves crude protein, nonprotein nitrogen, and crude fiber content. Germination decreases lysine, tryptophan, sulphur and total aromatic amino acids, but most contents are still higher than proposed by the FAO/WHO reference pattern.<ref name=El-Adawy />\n\nOligosaccharides, such as stachyose and raffinose, are reduced in higher amounts during germination than during cooking.

Essential amino acids are slightly increased by boiling and microwave cooking when compared to autoclaving and germination. Overall, microwave cooking leads to a significantly lower loss of nutrients compared to autoclaving and boiling.\n\nFinally, all treatments lead to an improved protein digestibility, protein efficiency ratio, and essential amino acid index. Microwave cooking seems to be an effective method to prepare chickpeas because of its improvement of nutritional values and its lower cooking time.<ref name=El-Adawy />\n\n===Leaves===\nIn some parts of the world, young chickpea leaves are consumed as cooked green vegetables.

Recent research has indicated that a combination of heat treatment along with the two vital micronutrients, phosphorus and nitrogen, are the most critical components to increasing the overall yield of ''Cicer arietinum''.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nPerennial chickpeas are a fundamental source of nutrition in animal feed as they are high sources of energy and protein for livestock. Unlike other food crops, the perennial chickpea shows a remarkable capacity to change its nutritional content in response to heat cultivation. Treating the chickpea with a constant heat source increases its protein content almost threefold.<ref name=\":1\">Bampidis, V.A. & Christodoulou, V. (2011). Chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.) in animal nutrition: A review.

Increasing the height and size of chickpea plants involves using micronutrient fertilization with varying doses of inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe level of phosphorus that a chickpea seed is exposed to during its lifecycle has a positive correlation relative to the height of the plant at full maturity.<ref name=\":0\">Mishra, U.S., Sirothia, P., & Bhadoria, U.S. (2009). Effects of phosphorus nutrition on growth and yield of chickpea (''Cicer arietinum'') under rain fed conditions. International Journal of Agricultural and Statistical Sciences, 5(1): 85\u201388.</ref> Increasing the levels of inorganic phosphorus at all doses incrementally increases the height of the chickpea plant. Thus, the seasonal changes in phosphorus soil content as well as periods of drought that are known to be a native characteristic of the dry [[Middle East|Middle-Eastern]] region where the chickpea is most commonly cultivated have a strong effect on the growth of the plant itself. Plant yield is also affected by a combination of phosphorus nutrition and water supply, resulting in a 12% increase in yield of the crop.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNitrogen nutrition is another factor that affects the yield of ''Cicer arietinum'', although the application itself differs from other perennial crops with regards to the levels administered on the plant. High doses of nitrogen inhibit the yield of the chickpea plant.<ref name=\":2\" /> Drought stress is a likely factor that also inhibits the uptake of nitrogen and subsequent fixation in the roots of ''Cicer arietinum''. The growth of the perennial chickpea is dependent on the balance between nitrogen fixation and assimilation that is also characteristic of many other agricultural plant types. The influence of drought stress, sowing date, and mineral nitrogen supply all have an effect on the yield and size of the plant, with trials showing that ''Cicer arietinum'' differed from other plant species in its capacity to assimilate mineral nitrogen supply from soil during drought stress.<ref name=\":2\">Wery, J., Deschamps, M., & Leger-Cresson, N.

The government donated the metal, which is bronze from captured enemy cannon melted down after the Battle of Waterloo, and valued at the time at \u00a31500. The total cost of the statue was \u00a39000. The remainder being raised by public subscription.<br/>\nThe sculptor, Sir Francis Chantrey (1781 to 1841), was commissioned in 1838 but died before the work was completed. It was finished by his assistant Henry Weekes (1807 to 1877).<br/>\nThe Lord Mayor, William Magnay, unveiled the statue on 18th June 1844, the anniversary of Waterloo, in the presence of his guest the King of Saxony.\nAdjoining the statue, a piece of granite from London Bridge (1825 to 1967) has been set into the pavement by the Corporation of London. The elevational stonework from the same bridge was re-erected over the Colorado River in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, USA, in 1971.<ref name=LR/>}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|London|Visual arts}}\n* {{Commons category inline|Equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington, Royal Exchange, London}}\n\n{{Wellington}}\n{{Public art in London}}\n\n[[Category:1844 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1844 sculptures]]\n[[Category:Equestrian statues in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Grade II listed buildings in the City of London]]\n[[Category:Grade II listed monuments and memorials]]\n[[Category:Military memorials in London]]\n[[Category:Monuments and memorials in London]]\n[[Category:Outdoor sculptures in London]]\n[[Category:Sculptures of men in the United Kingdom|Wellington, London]]\n[[Category:Statues in London]]\n[[Category:Statues of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|London, City]]\n", "name_user": "Ham II", "label": "safe", "comment": "style", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrian_statue_of_the_Duke_of_Wellington,_City_of_London"}
