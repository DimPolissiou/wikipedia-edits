Only seven other wrestlers have held the title for longer than a day: [[Carmella (wrestler)|Carmella]], [[Drake Maverick]], [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]], [[Maria Kanellis]], [[Mojo Rawley]], and both [[The Singh Brothers|Singh Brothers]], Samir and Sunil. WWE announcer Mike Rome has the shortest reign, which lasted approximately 9 seconds.

Former WWE wrestler [[Kelly Kelly]] was the first of six women to have won the title. WWE Hall of Famer [[Ted DiBiase|\"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]] is the only title holder to become champion without winning the title; he purchased it from fellow Hall of Famer [[Alundra Blayze]], who was about to drop the belt into a trash can (reenacting the infamous incident of what she had done to the then-[[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWF Women's Championship]] when she joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1995). [[The Revival (professional wrestling)|The Revival]] ([[Scott Dawson (wrestler)|Scott Dawson]] and [[Dash Wilder]]) are the only tag team to win the title, being recognized as co-champions.

Former WWE wrestler [[Kelly Kelly]] was the first of six women to have won the title. WWE Hall of Famer [[Ted DiBiase|\"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]] is the only title holder to become champion without winning the title; he purchased it from fellow Hall of Famer [[Alundra Blayze]], who was about to drop the belt into a trash can (reenacting the infamous incident of what she had done to the then-[[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWF Women's Championship]] when she joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1995). [[The Revival (professional wrestling)|The Revival]] ([[Scott Dawson (wrestler)|Scott Dawson]] and [[Dash Wilder]]) are the only tag team to win the title, being recognized as co-champions.

Depending on the region, this is called a [[bolillo]], [[telera]], [[Birote (food)|birote]], or ''pan franc\u00e9s''. Tortas can be eaten cold or hot, and grilled or toasted in a press in the same manner as a [[Cuban sandwich]].\n\n[[Garnish (food)|Garnishes]] such as [[avocado]], [[chili pepper]] (usually [[poblano]] or [[jalape\u00f1o]]), [[tomato]], and [[onion]] are common. The dish is popular throughout Mexico, and is also available anywhere with a large Mexican population. In Northern Mexico, the ''torta'' is very frequently called '''''lonche''''' by influence of the English \"[[lunch]]\", as it may be eaten during lunch break.\n\nThe sandwich is normally named according to its main ingredient:\n* ''Torta de jam\u00f3n'', ham-filled ''torta''\n* ''Torta de aguacate'', avocado-filled ''torta''\n* ''Torta de adobada'', [[adobo]] meat-filled ''torta''\n* ''Torta de huevo'', scrambled eggs-filled ''torta''\n* ''Torta de milanesa'', [[milanesa]] meat-filled ''torta''\n* ''Tortope'', chicken [[sope]]-filled ''torta''\n\nThe ''[[torta ahogada]]'' (meaning \"drowned\" ''torta'') of Guadalajara is smothered in a red sauce. Different fillings are available and they may be mixed to create an original ''torta''.\n\nThe Torta Cubana is another take on the classic torta sandwich [[Mexico]] has been accredited for. As the name implies by meaning literally the \"Cuban Torta\", this sandwich is stuffed with a variety of meats that is dependent on where it is being made. This sandwich should not be confused for the [[Cuban sandwich]] by the similar name, the \"Cubano\" as the two sandwiches are not related. One may have come before the other, but this coincidence in names is not to be taken seriously as the Mexicans decided to name this dish after the street it was invented on, the ''Calle Republica de Cuba in Mexico City''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/lucky-peach/on-tortas-cubanas-834c317961c6|title=On Tortas Cubanas|first=Lucky|last=Peach|date=3 September 2014|publisher=}}</ref> To add on to the contrasts, the breads used to make the sandwiches are different, and the condiments of the sandwiches varies.\n\nDue to the practicality of being hand-carried, ''tortas'' are sold at massive events, such as football matches, parades, and outdoor concerts, but they are also available for breakfast, lunch, or dinner at dedicated establishments or sold as [[street food]] by [[food cart]]s.\n\nThe origin of the torta is unclear, but some claim it sprouted in [[Puebla]] due to Spanish-French interaction.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Alaniz|first1=Leticia|title=Tortas -

Almonds are a very common ingredient in Maltese cuisine, although some people prefer to use marzipan over almonds, either because of ease, taste preference or cost.\n\n===South America===\nIn [[Venezuela]], [[Chile]], and [[Uruguay]], people typically refer to dessert cakes as \"tortas.\"\n\n==Sandwiches==\n===Mexico===\n[[File:tortamex.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Typical Mexican Torta|Mexican-style torta with typical accompaniments]]\n[[File:Torta ahogada.jpg|thumb|right|Mexican ''[[torta ahogada]]'', a pork sandwich with chili/tomato sauce, onion slices and lime juice]]\nIn [[Mexico]], a ''torta'' is a kind of [[sandwich]],<ref>\"[http://www.averagebetty.com/recipes/grilled-chicken-torta-recipe/ Mexican Torta recipe]\"</ref> served on an oblong 15&nbsp;cm firm, crusty white [[sandwich]] roll. Depending on the region, this is called a [[bolillo]], [[telera]], [[Birote (food)|birote]], or ''pan franc\u00e9s''. Tortas can be eaten cold or hot, and grilled or toasted in a press in the same manner as a [[Cuban sandwich]].\n\n[[Garnish (food)|Garnishes]] such as [[avocado]], [[chili pepper]] (usually [[poblano]] or [[jalape\u00f1o]]), [[tomato]], and [[onion]] are common. The dish is popular throughout Mexico, and is also available anywhere with a large Mexican population. In Northern Mexico, the ''torta'' is very frequently called '''''lonche''''' by influence of the English \"[[lunch]]\", as it may be eaten during lunch break.\n\nThe sandwich is normally named according to its main ingredient:\n* ''Torta de jam\u00f3n'', ham-filled ''torta''\n* ''Torta de aguacate'', avocado-filled ''torta''\n* ''Torta de adobada'', [[adobo]] meat-filled ''torta''\n* ''Torta de huevo'', scrambled eggs-filled ''torta''\n* ''Torta de milanesa'', [[milanesa]] meat-filled ''torta''\n* ''Tortope'', chicken [[sope]]-filled ''torta''\n\nThe ''[[torta ahogada]]'' (meaning \"drowned\" ''torta'') of Guadalajara is smothered in a red sauce. Different fillings are available and they may be mixed to create an original ''torta''.\n\nThe Torta Cubana is another take on the classic torta sandwich [[Mexico]] has been accredited for. As the name implies by meaning literally the \"Cuban Torta\", this sandwich is stuffed with a variety of meats that is dependent on where it is being made. This sandwich should not be confused for the [[Cuban sandwich]] by the similar name, the \"Cubano\" as the two sandwiches are not related. One may have come before the other, but this coincidence in names is not to be taken seriously as the Mexicans decided to name this dish after the street it was invented on, the ''Calle Republica de Cuba in Mexico City''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/lucky-peach/on-tortas-cubanas-834c317961c6|title=On Tortas Cubanas|first=Lucky|last=Peach|date=3 September 2014|publisher=}}</ref> To add on to the contrasts, the breads used to make the sandwiches are different, and the condiments of the sandwiches varies.\n\nDue to the practicality of being hand-carried, ''tortas'' are sold at massive events, such as football matches, parades, and outdoor concerts, but they are also available for breakfast, lunch, or dinner at dedicated establishments or sold as [[street food]] by [[food cart]]s.\n\nThe origin of the torta is unclear, but some claim it sprouted in [[Puebla]] due to Spanish-French interaction.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Alaniz|first1=Leticia|title=Tortas - The Mexican Quintessential Sandwich|url=http://leticiaalaniz.blogspot.com/2011/08/tortas-mexican-quintessential-sandwich.html|website=Leticia Alaniz|accessdate=12 February 2015}}</ref> ''Teleras'' (the bread usually used in tortas) were inspired by French baguettes.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Torta|url=https://bolillotortas.wordpress.com/2011/12/06/history-of-the-torta/|website=bolillotortas|publisher=Bolillo Tortas|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Torta Chicharrones-Galicia.jpg|''Torta de chicharrones'' from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Spain\nFile:Tortas de aceite.jpg|''[[Tortas de aceite]]'' in [[Seville]], [[Andalusia]], Spain\nFile:06.Torta de Huevo 02.JPG|Packed ''torta de huevo'', from [[Sobrarbe]], [[Aragon]], Spain\nFile:Houghton LAC8.Ib170.839t - Trages y Costumbres 6.jpg|An 1839 drawing of a woman selling tortas\nFile:01.Torta.JPG|Torta from [[Ribagorza (comarca)|Ribagorza]], Aragon, Spain\nFile:TortaImperial-P1090313.JPG|Torta imperial, Spain\nFile:TortaFrita.jpg|''[[Torta frita]]'' from [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]]\nFile:Torta verde.jpg|''Torta verde'' from [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]], Italy\nFile:Tortas Oaxaquenas.jpg|Tortas being prepared on a griddle in [[Oaxaca]], Mexico\nFile:TORTA DE HUEVO.jpg|Mexican ''torta de huevo''\nFile:Tortang-Talong-Eggplant-Fritter-1068x801.jpg|''[[Tortang talong]]'' is an [[eggplant]] omelette commonly served for breakfast or as a side dish for other meals.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Arepa]]\n* [[Tortilla]]\n* [[Migas]]\n* [[Pupusa]]\n* [[Sopaipilla]]\n* [[Torta de Gazpacho]]\n* [[Torta del Casar]], a cheese made from sheep's milk in [[Extremadura]], Spain.\n* [[Torte]]\n* [[List of sandwiches]]\n* {{portal-inline|food}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category multi|Torta (flatbread)|Tortas (sandwich)}}\n* [http://www.spanishdict.com/translate/torta Spanish Dictionary: Torta]\n\n{{Mexican cuisine}}\n{{Sandwiches}}\n{{Omelettes}}\n\n[[Category:Cuisine of the Western United States]]\n[[Category:Flatbreads]]\n[[Category:Mexican cuisine]]\n[[Category:Omelettes]]\n[[Category:Philippine cuisine]]\n[[Category:Sandwiches]]\n[[Category:Spanish words and phrases]]\n[[Category:Unleavened breads]]\n", "name_user": "2601:8c3:4100:f6e0:9124:f433:239d:96e8", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Fixed typo)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torta"}

These standards are concerned with three occupational categories: professional engineer, engineering technologist, and engineering associate. The titles of  Chartered Professional Engineer, Chartered Engineering Technologist and Chartered Engineering Associate (Officer) are available to members of Engineers Australia who have demonstrated the required competencies.<ref>{{cite book |last= |engineers australia= |date= November 2003 |title= Australian Engineering Competency Standards|url= |location= |publisher= Engineers Australia |page=5  |isbn= 0 85825 771 8 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nTo be recognised as part as a member, individuals must complete formal educational qualifications [https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/sites/default/files/shado/Representation/FAQ/faq_1_eng_team.pdf formal educational qualifications]\nin engineering, and after qualifying, must undertake continuing professional\ndevelopment in their chosen field of engineering to ensure their training remains up to date.\nThe educational qualifications required are:\n* Professional engineers, at least the equivalent of a four-year, bachelor's degree in engineering.\n* Engineering technologist, at least the equivalent of a three-year, bachelor's degree in engineering.\n* Engineering associate, at least the equivalent of a two-year, associate degree or a diploma or advanced diploma in engineering\n\n==Regulatory Schemes <ref>[http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/nerb/regulatory-schemes Regulatory Schemes]</ref>==\nThere is no formal system of regulation for engineers throughout Australia. Engineering services are regulated under a variety of Acts in ad hoc areas, many of which relate to engineers in the building and construction industry. There are also many pieces of subordinate legislation, such as regulations, by-laws and orders-in-council that impose various prescriptive standards and incur unnecessary costs to the engineering industry in complying.\n\nIn Queensland, persons who are not registered with the Board of Professional Engineers Queensland are prohibited from offering or providing professional engineering services. The only exception is for individuals who practise under the direct supervision of registered professional engineers.\n\n==Registers==\n\n===State Register===\nQueensland is currently the only Australian jurisdiction to apply a comprehensive registration system for engineers.<ref>[http://www.bpeq.qld.gov.au/BPEQ/Registration/BPEQ/Navigation/Registration/Registration_-_the_RPEQ_system.aspx?hkey=906af6b0-d2d3-43d5-acf1-e64b38fdfe39 The RPEQ System]</ref> The Queensland Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology appointed Engineers Australia on 1 July 2008<ref>[https://www.bpeq.qld.gov.au/imis15/BPEQ/Registration/BPEQ/Navigation/Registration/Registration.aspx?hkey=906af6b0-d2d3-43d5-acf1-e64b38fdfe39 Board of Professional Engineers Queensland-Approved Assessment Entity]</ref> as one of the Approved Assessment entities for assessing applicants for Registration with the Board of Professional Engineers of Queensland.<ref>[https://www.bpeq.qld.gov.au/imis15/BPEQ/Registration/Areas_of_Engineering/BPEQ/Navigation/Registration/AreasofEngineering/Areas_of_Engineering.aspx Board of Professional Engineers Queensland- Areas of Engineering]</ref>\n\n===National Register===\nThe National Engineering Register (NER) has been created by Engineers Australia to provide a means of presenting registered engineers and their services to the public. It also provides assurance to consumers that engineers engaged from the NER meet the high standards of professionalism expected in the engineering profession. It is the largest Engineering Register in the country delivering a uniform national benchmark standard of professionalism in the broadest areas of engineering practice, both general and special.<ref name=\"WHATISNER\">[http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/national-engineering-register What is the National Engineering Register?]</ref>\n\nThe NER is a [https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/portal/ner/search// publicly searchable database] providing a national system of \u2018registration\u2019 for the engineering profession in Australia of professional engineers, engineering technologists and engineering associates in both the private and public sectors. It is expected that the NER will facilitate access to existing State/Territory registers and to new registers, as and when they are developed. The NER is aimed at removing any current inconsistencies across State/Territory jurisdictions.<ref name=\"Register\">[https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/national-engineering-register/national-engineering-register-guidelines-registration Engineering Registers]</ref>\n\nThe NER caters for nine (9) general and ten (10) special areas of practice aligned to demonstrated professional competence and experience.  Registration on the 10 special areas of practice will be restricted to Chartered members of Engineers Australia and registrants who have successfully completed Engineers Australia's Chartered assessment process.<ref name=\"NER_AREAS\">[https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/national-engineering-register/section-3-ner-areas-practice NER Areas of Practice]</ref>\n\nRegistrants on the NER will be able to confirm the following eligibility criteria. the remaining\n\n* A recognised qualification\n* Relevant professional practice\n* Currency of continuing professional development (CPD)\n* The benefit of Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII)\n* A commitment to ethical practice\n\n===International Register===\nNER registered Chartered members of Engineers Australia in the occupational category of professional engineer with 7 + years of relevant engineering industry experience in their area(s) of practice since graduation and who have spent at least two years in responsible charge of engineering work will also be eligible to apply to join the APEC Engineers Register and the International Professional Engineers Register (IPEA) for non APEC economies.  Chartered members assessed as eligible will be entitled to also use the postnominal APEC Engineer and/or IntPE(Aus).<ref name=\"Register\" />\n\n==Continuing Professional Development==\nThe Board expects Chartered Members and Registrants to maintain records of continuing Professional Development (CPD) activities that extend or update their knowledge, skill or judgment in their area or areas of engineering practice. An individual's CPD records must demonstrate a minimum of 150 hours of structured CPD in the last three years.<ref>[https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/sites/default/files/shado/About%20Us/Overview/Governance/Policies/CPD%20Policy.pdf Continuing Professional Development (CPD)Policy, 19 February 2009]</ref> To maintain Chartered Status, registrants must complete Continuing Professional Development (CPD), which is subject to review every five years.<ref>[https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/professional-development/audit 5 year Audit]</ref>\n\n==Code of Ethics==\nSince its inception, Engineers Australia has had a Code of Ethics and disciplinary processes that enable it to take action against members who breach that Code.
