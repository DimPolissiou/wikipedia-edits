It is the third track from their 1991 album ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', and it was released as the record's third single in February 1992. During the album's recording sessions at [[Hansa Studios]] in Berlin, conflict arose between the band members over the direction of U2's sound and the quality of their material. Tensions almost prompted the band to break up until they achieved a breakthrough with the improvisation of \"One\"; the song was written after the band members were inspired by a chord progression that guitarist [[the Edge]] was playing in the studio. The lyrics, written by lead singer [[Bono]], were inspired by the band members' fractured relationships and the [[German reunification]]. Although the lyrics ostensibly describe \"disunity\", they have been interpreted in other ways.\n\n\"One\" was released as a [[charity record|benefit single]], with proceeds going towards [[HIV/AIDS research|AIDS research]]. The song topped the [[Irish Singles Charts]], the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles chart and the US ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Album Rock Tracks]] and [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] charts. It also peaked at number three in New Zealand, number four in Australia, number seven on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In promotion of the song, the band filmed several music videos, although they were not pleased until a third was created.\n\nThe song was acclaimed by critics upon its release, and it has since been featured in polls of the greatest songs of all time. U2 has performed \"One\" at most of their tour concerts since the song's live debut in 1992, and it has appeared in many of the band's [[concert film]]s. In a live setting, \"One\" is often used by the group to promote human rights or [[social justice]] causes, and the song lends its namesake to Bono's charitable organisation, [[ONE Campaign|One Campaign]]. In 2005, U2 re-recorded the song as part of a duet with [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] recording artist [[Mary J. Blige]] on her album ''[[The Breakthrough]]''.\n\n==Writing and recording==\nIn October 1990, U2 arrived in Berlin on the eve of [[German reunification]] to begin the recording sessions for ''Achtung Baby'' at [[Hansa Studios]].{{Sfn | McCormick | 2006 | pp = 216, 221}} Expecting to be inspired by a \"[[New Europe (political expression)|New Europe]]\" and the reuniting city, the band instead found the mood to be bleak and soon conflict arose over their musical direction and the quality of their material. While bassist [[Adam Clayton]] and drummer [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]] preferred a sound similar to U2's previous work, vocalist [[Bono]] and guitarist [[the Edge]] were inspired by European [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[electronic dance music]] of the time and were advocating a change.{{Sfn | McCormick | 2006 | pp = 216, 221}} The band also had difficulty developing demos and musical ideas into completed songs.{{Sfn | McCormick | 2006 | pp = 216, 221}} Bono and the Edge believed the lack of progress was the fault of the band, while Clayton and Mullen Jr. believed the problem was the quality of the songs.{{Sfn | McCormick | 2006 | pp = 216, 221}} Mullen said he \"thought this might be the end\" of the band.{{Sfn | McCormick | 2006 | pp = 216, 221}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote=\"At the instant we were recording it, I got a very strong sense of its power.

Until the second leg of the [[U2 360\u00b0 Tour]], \"One\" was played live in the key of A{{music |flat}} minor, while the recorded version is played a [[semitone]] higher.  Throughout its history, Bono has often sung the song with an extra verse generally known as \"Hear Us Coming\", whose lyrics are usually some variation of:\n<poem>You hear us coming Lord?\nYou hear us call?\nYou hear us knocking, knocking at Your door?\nYou hear us coming, Lord?\nYou hear us call?\nYou hear us scratching, will You make me crawl?</poem>\n\nIt was a nearly-regular feature on the Zoo TV Tour, PopMart, and [[Elevation Tour|Elevation]] Tours, but was sung less often on the Vertigo Tour. The verse made a re-emergence on the 2009 legs of the [[U2 360\u00b0 Tour]]; although it was not a nightly feature, Bono sang it very often, segueing into \"[[Amazing Grace]]\" and from there into \"[[Where the Streets Have No Name]]\" on most of the second leg. \"One\" has also been played at several benefit concerts, including the 1995 ''[[Pavarotti and Friends]]'' concert in Modena, the 1997 [[Tibetan Freedom Concert]] in New York, the 2003 [[46664 (concerts)|46664]] concert, at [[Live 8]] in 2005, and with Mary J. Blige on ''[[Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast]]''.\n\nLive performances of the song are also depicted in the concert films ''[[Zoo TV: Live from Sydney]]'', ''[[U2 Go Home: Live from Slane Castle]]'', ''[[Vertigo 2005: Live from Chicago]]'', ''[[U2 3D]]'', and ''[[U2 360\u00b0 at the Rose Bowl]]''.\n\n==Track listings==\nThe single was released on various formats including [[gramophone record|7-inch]], [[12-inch single|12-inch]], [[cassette single|cassette]], and [[Compact Disc single|CD]].  All releases featured a new song \"Lady with the Spinning Head (UV1)\" as a B-side track. This version was later included in the 20th anniversary release of ''Achtung Baby'', whereas an extended 'dance' remix was included on the double album version of ''[[The Best of 1990\u20132000]]''.

It is the third track from their 1991 album ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', and it was released as the record's third single in February 1992. During the album's recording sessions at [[Hansa Studios]] in Berlin, conflict arose between the band members over the direction of U2's sound and the quality of their material. Tensions almost prompted the band to break up until they achieved a breakthrough with the improvisation of \"One\"; the song was written after the band members were inspired by a chord progression that guitarist [[the Edge]] was playing in the studio. The lyrics, written by lead singer [[Bono]], were inspired by the band members' fractured relationships and the [[German reunification]]. Although the lyrics ostensibly describe \"disunity\", they have been interpreted in other ways.\n\n\"One\" was released as a [[charity record|benefit single]], with proceeds going towards [[HIV/AIDS research|AIDS research]]. The song topped the [[Irish Singles Charts]], the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles chart and the US ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Album Rock Tracks]] and [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] charts. It also peaked at number three in New Zealand, number four in Australia, number seven on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In promotion of the song, the band filmed several music videos, although they were not pleased until a third was created.\n\nThe song was acclaimed by critics upon its release, and it has since been featured in polls of the greatest songs of all time. U2 has performed \"One\" at most of their tour concerts since the song's live debut in 1992, and it has appeared in many of the band's [[concert film]]s. In a live setting, \"One\" is often used by the group to promote human rights or [[social justice]] causes, and the song lends its namesake to Bono's charitable organisation, the [[ONE Campaign]]. In 2005, U2 re-recorded the song as part of a duet with [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] recording artist [[Mary J. Blige]] on her album ''[[The Breakthrough]]''.\n\n==Writing and recording==\nIn October 1990, U2 arrived in Berlin on the eve of [[German reunification]] to begin the recording sessions for ''Achtung Baby'' at [[Hansa Studios]].{{Sfn | McCormick | 2006 | pp = 216, 221}} Expecting to be inspired by a \"[[New Europe (political expression)|New Europe]]\" and the reuniting city, the band instead found the mood to be bleak and soon conflict arose over their musical direction and the quality of their material. While bassist [[Adam Clayton]] and drummer [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]] preferred a sound similar to U2's previous work, vocalist [[Bono]] and guitarist [[the Edge]] were inspired by European [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[electronic dance music]] of the time and were advocating a change.{{Sfn | McCormick | 2006 | pp = 216, 221}} The band also had difficulty developing demos and musical ideas into completed songs.{{Sfn | McCormick | 2006 | pp = 216, 221}} Bono and the Edge believed the lack of progress was the fault of the band, while Clayton and Mullen Jr. believed the problem was the quality of the songs.{{Sfn | McCormick | 2006 | pp = 216, 221}} Mullen said he \"thought this might be the end\" of the band.{{Sfn | McCormick | 2006 | pp = 216, 221}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote=\"At the instant we were recording it, I got a very strong sense of its power.

One is not about oneness, it's about difference. It's not the old hippie idea of 'let's all live together.' It is a much more [[punk rock]] concept. It's anti-romantic: 'we are one but not the same.

It spent two weeks atop the ''[[New York Times]]'' Bestseller List and reached number 3 on the ''[https://jobonlinelist.com/ USA Today]'' bestseller list, marking the first time one of Roberts' books had become a bestseller in [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] format. A downloadable casual-play computer game based on the book was introduced by [[Oberon Media|I-Play]] in 2010.\n\nIn her thirty-year career, Roberts had published almost 200 novels. ''Vision in White'' was one of ten Roberts novels published in 2009, including five new releases and five reprints. When it was released on April 28, 2009, its cover premiered the use of a special logo to differentiate her new releases from reprints of her past works.\n\nThe novel marked Roberts' return to [[contemporary romance]]. The new series revolved around a wedding planning enterprise run by four childhood friends. This first story featured the developing relationship between wedding photographer Mackensie \"Mac\" Elliot and English professor Carter Maguire. Like several other Roberts novels, ''Vision in White'' explored how a protagonist balanced a successful career with a dysfunctional family environment. Although the hero is a fairly typical representation of the romance novel archetype of the professor, the novel is slightly unusual for a romance in that the hero must convince the heroine to take a chance on love.\n\n==Background==\n[[Nora Roberts]] is a prolific author of [[romance novel|romance]] and futuristic suspense novels.<ref name=kopun>{{citation|last=Kopun|first=Francine|title=Nora Roberts, a bestselling author rarely reviewed|newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]]|date=October 19, 2009|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/2009/10/19/nora_roberts_a_bestselling_author_rarely_reviewed.html|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> From 1979 through 2008, almost 200 of her novels were published.

Mac and her childhood friends Parker, Emma, and Laurel are the founders of Vows, a fictional wedding planning company in Connecticut. While accompanying his sister to a planning session at Vows, Carter renews his acquaintance with Mac, and confesses that he had been infatuated with her since high school. She is intrigued by his honesty and earnestness and decides to embark on a casual fling with him.\n\nAfter seeing her parents' numerous failed marriages, Mac does not trust the idea of commitment. Her determination to avoid emotional intimacy is reinforced as she struggles against her mother's continued tactics of [[emotional manipulation]].\n\nTheir relationship progresses slowly through the book. Each protagonist receives much advice from a large circle of friends and family. With the support of her friends and Carter, Mac develops the courage to stand up to her mother. By the end of the novel, she realizes that she does not have to relive her parents' mistakes, and chooses to embrace her love for Carter.\n\n==Analysis==\n[[File:NoraRoberts.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Author [[Nora Roberts]]]]\nThe four novels of the Bride Quartet share a strong emphasis on sisterhood. The heroines of the books bonded as children and have become sisters by choice. Throughout the series, they provide mutual support and acceptance of each other's quirks. Focused on their careers, the heroines have little time for outside relationships, and they rely heavily on each other for comfort, help, and distractions.<ref name=snodgrass85>Snodgrass (2010), p. 85.</ref> A similar theme is seen in several of Roberts' other works; her [[In Death]] series, written as J. D. Robb, has a heroine who has created a family from female friends and colleagues.<ref name=snodgrass86>Snodgrass (2010), p. 86.</ref>\n\nAccording to critic [[Betsy Prioleau]], ''Vision in White'''s hero is a typical representation of one of the eight [[archetype]]s of a romance hero: the professor.<ref name=prioleau/> Several scenes in the novel show him teaching students or in parent-teacher conferences.<ref name=snodgrass86/> Like most intellectual romance heroes, Carter is a \"sober good guy\", and the heroine is attracted to him primarily for his mind.<ref name=prioleau>Prioleau (2013), Chapter 5.</ref> In an unusual twist for a romance novel, however, the hero is the character who is ready for a commitment but must help the heroine overcome her fears.<ref name=pw/> After seeing her mother divorce four husbands and discard countless boyfriends, Mac prefers to avoid emotional intimacy rather than risk the relationship splintering.<ref name=snodgrass88/> Carter provides reassurance that their relationship is built on a solid foundation.<ref name=snodgrass89>Snodgrass (2010), p. 89.</ref>\n\nCritic [[Mary Ellen Snodgrass]] calls ''Vision in White'' a story of the [[New Woman]], with a strong heroine who is extremely proud of her significant career accomplishments.<ref name=snodgrass66>Snodgrass (2010), p. 66.</ref> Roberts uses the heroine's choices of how to pose or spotlight her photography clients as pointed ways of celebrating both monogamy and \"unconventional views of femininity\".<ref name=snodgrass87>Snodgrass (2010), p. 87.</ref> In one scene, Mac convinces a heavily pregnant woman to pose nude, despite her feelings of awkwardness; through the resulting photos, the client comes to believe that she is actually beautiful.<ref name=snodgrass88>Snodgrass (2010), p. 88.</ref><ref name=snodgrass87/> In another poke at traditional stereotypes, Mac photographs a bride and groom posing together on a horse, evoking the metaphor of a knight coming to rescue the princess\u2014but the couple are equals.<ref name=snodgrass87/>\n\nRoberts contrasts Mac's competence in business matters with her difficulties in dealing with an extremely dysfunctional family, a theme Roberts had previously used in the Chesapeake Bay Series (''Rising Tides'', ''[[Sea Swept]]'', and ''Inner Harbor'') and the Calhoun Series.<ref name=snodgrass66/> In ''Visions in White'', the family difficulties are caused by the heroine's mother, who is essentially a cross between the mothers in ''[[Carolina Moon (novel)|Carolina Moon]]'' and ''Tribute''.<ref name=snodgrass66/>  Roberts shows that, as a result of her family's dysfunction, Mac has chosen to distance herself from deeper emotions.<ref name=snodgrass67/> The camera allows Mac to interact with other people's happiness and lives without having to fully participate; as the book progresses, she gradually develops the courage to come out of her shell and fully participate in life.<ref name=snodgrass67>Snodgrass (2010), p. 67.</ref>\n\nThe use of the wedding industry is, per Snodgrass, \"a wry reprise of Roberts' career in fictional matchmaking\".<ref name=snodgrass66/> The novel celebrates the joy of a traditional wedding ceremony,<ref name=snodgrass67/> including the playful ceremonies arranged by children playing dress-up. Roberts' treatment of these themes \"validates the dress-up game of playing bride as both fantasy and a stabilizing preface on women's devotion to mate and family\".<ref name=snodgrass66/> Roberts included significant detail on the wedding planning industry, which Snodgrass posits is meant to highlight and celebrate the success the female characters had at niche marketing.<ref name=snodgrass67/>\n\n==Reception==\nJill M. Smith in ''[[Romantic Times]]'' gave the novel four out of five stars, labeling it a \"wonderful and cozy read\".<ref name=smith/> A ''Publishers Weekly'' review highlighted the \"gentle humor and likable cast\" and predicted that readers would be eager to follow the characters through the rest of the series.<ref name=pw>{{citation|title=Vision in White|newspaper=Publishers Weekly|date=May 2009|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-425-22751-0|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> In ''[[Booklist]]'', John Charles called the novel \"thoroughly charming\" and lauded the deep characterization and \"sharp, clever writing\" that combined to celebrate \"friendship and love\".<ref name=charles/>\n\nIn a survey of readers, Snodgrass found mixed opinions. Many were delighted to see Roberts return to traditional contemporary romances, minus the elements of fantasy and magic that had woven through her more recent novels. Some praised the tight bonds of sisterhood that Roberts created for the four founders of Vows, but other readers complained that the character voices were too similar. A vocal minority pointed out similarities between this novel and Roberts' Calhoun series.<ref name=snodgrass121>Snodgrass (2010), p. 121.</ref>\n\nBy February 2010, ''Vision in White'' and ''Bed of Roses'' had sold a combined 1&nbsp;million print copies.<ref name=ign/> Over 100,000 copies of ''Vision in White'' were sold in Canada alone between May and October 2009.<ref name=kopun/> The novel spent 32 weeks on the ''USA Today'' bestseller list, peaking at number 3.<ref>{{citation|title=Vision in White|newspaper=USA Today|date=June 21, 2013|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/06/21/vision-in-white/2444877/isbn/9780425227510/|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> It was number 1 on the ''New York Times'' Bestseller List for trade paperback fiction for two weeks.<ref>{{citation|title=Paperback trade fiction|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 17, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2009-05-17/trade-fiction-paperback/list.html|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Paperback trade fiction|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 20, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2009-05-24/trade-fiction-paperback/list.html|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> It was the first of Roberts' novels to be a bestseller in trade paperback format.<ref name=ign>{{citation\n|title=I-play launches Nora Roberts: Vision in White for PC|date=25 February 2010|publisher=IGN|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/02/25/i-play-launches-nora-roberts-vision-in-white-for-pc|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Computer game==\nWithin months of the novel's release, computer gaming company [[Oberon Media|I-Play]] began developing a downloadable casual-play game based on the story.<ref name=ew>{{citation|last=Staskiewicz|first=Keith|title=Nora Roberts to release a downloadable game based on her work|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=December 8, 2009|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2009/12/08/nora-roberts-to-release-a-downloadable-game-based-on-her-work|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> Roberts' input was limited to approval of the graphics and the game's interpretation of the story line.

By the end of the novel, she realizes that she does not have to relive her parents' mistakes, and chooses to embrace her love for Carter.\n\n==Analysis==\n[[File:NoraRoberts.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Author [[Nora Roberts]]]]\nThe four novels of the Bride Quartet share a strong emphasis on sisterhood. The heroines of the books bonded as children and have become sisters by choice. Throughout the series, they provide mutual support and acceptance of each other's quirks. Focused on their careers, the heroines have little time for outside relationships, and they rely heavily on each other for comfort, help, and distractions.<ref name=snodgrass85>Snodgrass (2010), p. 85.</ref> A similar theme is seen in several of Roberts' other works; her [[In Death]] series, written as J. D. Robb, has a heroine who has created a family from female friends and colleagues.<ref name=snodgrass86>Snodgrass (2010), p. 86.</ref>\n\nAccording to critic [[Betsy Prioleau]], ''Vision in White'''s hero is a typical representation of one of the eight [[archetype]]s of a romance hero: the professor.<ref name=prioleau/> Several scenes in the novel show him teaching students or in parent-teacher conferences.<ref name=snodgrass86/> Like most intellectual romance heroes, Carter is a \"sober good guy\", and the heroine is attracted to him primarily for his mind.<ref name=prioleau>Prioleau (2013), Chapter 5.</ref> In an unusual twist for a romance novel, however, the hero is the character who is ready for a commitment but must help the heroine overcome her fears.<ref name=pw/> After seeing her mother divorce four husbands and discard countless boyfriends, Mac prefers to avoid emotional intimacy rather than risk the relationship splintering.<ref name=snodgrass88/> Carter provides reassurance that their relationship is built on a solid foundation.<ref name=snodgrass89>Snodgrass (2010), p. 89.</ref>\n\nCritic [[Mary Ellen Snodgrass]] calls ''Vision in White'' a story of the [[New Woman]], with a strong heroine who is extremely proud of her significant career accomplishments.<ref name=snodgrass66>Snodgrass (2010), p. 66.</ref> Roberts uses the heroine's choices of how to pose or spotlight her photography clients as pointed ways of celebrating both monogamy and \"unconventional views of femininity\".<ref name=snodgrass87>Snodgrass (2010), p. 87.</ref> In one scene, Mac convinces a heavily pregnant woman to pose nude, despite her feelings of awkwardness; through the resulting photos, the client comes to believe that she is actually beautiful.<ref name=snodgrass88>Snodgrass (2010), p. 88.</ref><ref name=snodgrass87/> In another poke at traditional stereotypes, Mac photographs a bride and groom posing together on a horse, evoking the metaphor of a knight coming to rescue the princess\u2014but the couple are equals.<ref name=snodgrass87/>\n\nRoberts contrasts Mac's competence in business matters with her difficulties in dealing with an extremely dysfunctional family, a theme Roberts had previously used in the Chesapeake Bay Series (''Rising Tides'', ''[[Sea Swept]]'', and ''Inner Harbor'') and the Calhoun Series.<ref name=snodgrass66/> In ''Visions in White'', the family difficulties are caused by the heroine's mother, who is essentially a cross between the mothers in ''[[Carolina Moon (novel)|Carolina Moon]]'' and ''Tribute''.<ref name=snodgrass66/>  Roberts shows that, as a result of her family's dysfunction, Mac has chosen to distance herself from deeper emotions.<ref name=snodgrass67/> The camera allows Mac to interact with other people's happiness and lives without having to fully participate; as the book progresses, she gradually develops the courage to come out of her shell and fully participate in life.<ref name=snodgrass67>Snodgrass (2010), p. 67.</ref>\n\nThe use of the wedding industry is, per Snodgrass, \"a wry reprise of Roberts' career in fictional matchmaking\".<ref name=snodgrass66/> The novel celebrates the joy of a traditional wedding ceremony,<ref name=snodgrass67/> including the playful ceremonies arranged by children playing dress-up. Roberts' treatment of these themes \"validates the dress-up game of playing bride as both fantasy and a stabilizing preface on women's devotion to mate and family\".<ref name=snodgrass66/> Roberts included significant detail on the wedding planning industry, which Snodgrass posits is meant to highlight and celebrate the success the female characters had at niche marketing.<ref name=snodgrass67/>\n\n==Reception==\nJill M. Smith in ''[[Romantic Times]]'' gave the novel four out of five stars, labeling it a \"wonderful and cozy read\".<ref name=smith/> A ''Publishers Weekly'' review highlighted the \"gentle humor and likable cast\" and predicted that readers would be eager to follow the characters through the rest of the series.<ref name=pw>{{citation|title=Vision in White|newspaper=Publishers Weekly|date=May 2009|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-425-22751-0|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> In ''[[Booklist]]'', John Charles called the novel \"thoroughly charming\" and lauded the deep characterization and \"sharp, clever writing\" that combined to celebrate \"friendship and love\".<ref name=charles/>\n\nIn a survey of readers, Snodgrass found mixed opinions. Many were delighted to see Roberts return to traditional contemporary romances, minus the elements of fantasy and magic that had woven through her more recent novels. Some praised the tight bonds of sisterhood that Roberts created for the four founders of Vows, but other readers complained that the character voices were too similar. A vocal minority pointed out similarities between this novel and Roberts' Calhoun series.<ref name=snodgrass121>Snodgrass (2010), p. 121.</ref>\n\nBy February 2010, ''Vision in White'' and ''Bed of Roses'' had sold a combined 1&nbsp;million print copies.<ref name=ign/> Over 100,000 copies of ''Vision in White'' were sold in Canada alone between May and October 2009.<ref name=kopun/> The novel spent 32 weeks on the ''USA Today'' bestseller list, peaking at number 3.<ref>{{citation|title=Vision in White|newspaper=USA Today|date=June 21, 2013|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/06/21/vision-in-white/2444877/isbn/9780425227510/|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> It was number 1 on the ''New York Times'' Bestseller List for trade paperback fiction for two weeks.<ref>{{citation|title=Paperback trade fiction|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 17, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2009-05-17/trade-fiction-paperback/list.html|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Paperback trade fiction|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 20, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2009-05-24/trade-fiction-paperback/list.html|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> It was the first of Roberts' novels to be a bestseller in trade paperback format.<ref name=ign>{{citation\n|title=I-play launches Nora Roberts: Vision in White for PC|date=25 February 2010|publisher=IGN|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/02/25/i-play-launches-nora-roberts-vision-in-white-for-pc|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Computer game==\nWithin months of the novel's release, computer gaming company [[Oberon Media|I-Play]] began developing a downloadable casual-play game based on the story.<ref name=ew>{{citation|last=Staskiewicz|first=Keith|title=Nora Roberts to release a downloadable game based on her work|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=December 8, 2009|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2009/12/08/nora-roberts-to-release-a-downloadable-game-based-on-her-work|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> Roberts' input was limited to approval of the graphics and the game's interpretation of the story line.
