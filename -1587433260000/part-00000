Freeform radio stands in contrast to most commercial radio stations, in which [[Disc jockey|DJs]] have little or no influence over programming structure or [[playlist]]s. In the [[United States]], freeform DJs are still bound by [[Federal Communications Commission]] regulations.\n\n==History in the United States==\nMany shows claim to be the first freeform radio program, but the earliest on record is \"Nightsounds\" on [[KPFA-FM]] in [[Berkeley, California]], D.J.'d by [[John Leonard (critic)|John Leonard]]. Probably the best-remembered in the Midwest is [[Beaker Street]], which ran for almost 10 years on KAAY \"The Mighty 1090\" in Little Rock, Arkansas, beginning in 1966, making it also probably the best-known such show on an AM station; its signal reached from Canada to Mexico and Cuba, blanketing the Midwest and Midsouth of the U.S. [[WFMU]] is currently the longest-running freeform radio station in the [[United States]]. WNEW-FM 102.7 in NYC was the first commercial station in the US to introduce a freeform format. It stayed that way under the ownership of [[Metromedia|Metromedia Broadcasting]] till it was sold and the new owners were not interested. WNEW-FM was a leader in introducing new music and making household names of a good deal of the bands we know from the 1960s and '70s. [[Jim Ladd]] of [[KLOS]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] was one of the most notable freeform DJs. Tom Petty wrote a song about Jim Ladd called \"[[The Last DJ]]\". The only time Jim Ladd didn't have complete control over what music is being played is when he turned control over to his faithful listeners commonly referred to as \"The Tribe\".<ref>[http://www.wfmu.org/LCD/21/freeform.html \"A Brief History of Freeform Radio\"], Lowest Common Denominator, Issue #21 (c. 1998)</ref>\nOn October 26, 2011, Ladd was among various staffers let go from KLOS following the acquisition of station owner [[Citadel Broadcasting]] by [[Cumulus Media]]. As of 2012 Ladd is hosting a daily freeform show on [[Sirius XM Radio|Sirius XM's]] [[Deep Tracks]].\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"FM's free-form progressivism had proven essential to the pop process. But the new radio was only another example of the quirkish vitality of a new [[mass culture]] (call it [[youth culture|youth]], call it [[popular culture|pop]]) that seemed destined to defy the [[status quo]].\"|source=\u2014 ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981)<ref>{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=0899190251|chapter=The Guide|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg70/guide.php|accessdate=March 30, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}\n\nThe freeform [[ethos]] tends to disdain playlists confined to a single [[music genre]]. However, DJs may opt to play selections according to an arbitrary theme (e.g., [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]\" followed by [[Radiohead]]'s \"Subterranean Homesick Alien\"). Freeform-ish stations that played only or almost only rock music were known as [[progressive rock (radio format)|progressive rock]] stations, while those that play mostly [[American folk music|folk]] and/or [[country music|country]]-leaning cuts are known as [[Americana (music)|Americana]] stations.\n\nCommercial freeform radio stations were common in the late 1960s and early '70s, particularly on the [[FM broadcasting|FM]] band, but are rare today. An exceptional case was [[KDLD|Indie 103.1]] [[FM band|FM]] of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] and [[Newport Beach, California]]. Indie 103.1 broadcast radio programs in which famous musicians from the world of [[popular music]] host radio programs and choose the playlist.  Indie 103.1 recently left the FM airwaves, but currently continues on the internet.\n\nAnother commercial freeform radio station is [[KHUM]], \"radio without the rules,\" at 104.3 and 104.7 FM in Ferndale, California. KHUM has transmitted since 1996 and is the most popular station in [[Humboldt County, California]].\n\n[[Internet radio]] and, to a lesser extent, [[college radio]] are sanctuaries of the freeform format (although even the latter has lost much of its independence as stations begin modeling corporate stations in their presentation). On [[Sirius XM Radio|Sirius XM]] [[satellite radio]], the weekly [[Bob Dylan]]-hosted ''[[Theme Time Radio Hour]]'' featured a freeform format, as do several specialty programs on [[The Loft (Sirius XM)|The Loft]].

Unlike freeform radio, the eclectic radio format involves prescribed playlists. While freeform radio stands in contrast to commercial radio formats, a number of commercial radio stations offer programs showcasing an eclectic variety of music.\n\nSome eclectic radio stations in the United States are:\n*[[KCRW]] ([[Santa Monica, California]])\n*[[KEOS]] ([[College Station, Texas]])\n*[[KEXP]] ([[Seattle, Washington]])\n*[[KFAI]] ([[Minneapolis, Minnesota]])\n*[[KGLT]] ([[Bozeman, Montana]])\n*[[KNYE]] ([[Pahrump, Nevada]])\n*[[KGSR]] ([[Austin, Texas]])\n*[[KPIG]] ([[Freedom, California]])\n*[[KUOM]] ([[University of Minnesota]], [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]])\n*[[KXUA]] ([[Fayetteville, Arkansas]])\n*[[WERS]] ([[Boston, Massachusetts]])\n*[[WGWE]] ([[Seneca Nation of New York|Seneca Nation of Indians]], [[Little Valley (village), New York|Little Valley, New York]])\n*[[WHPK]] ([[University of Chicago]], [[Chicago, Illinois]])\n*[[WJCU]] ([[University Heights, Ohio]])\n*[[WMLB]] ([[Avondale Estates, Georgia]])\n*[[WUSM-FM|WUSM]] ([[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]])\n*[[WXPN]] ([[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]])\n*[[WNCW]] ([[Spindale, North Carolina]])\n*[[The Loft (Sirius XM)]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Progressive rock (radio format)]]\n*[[Jack FM]]/[[Adult hits]] (A radio format very similar to the freeform format)\n*[[Album-oriented rock]]\n*[[Adult album alternative]]\n*[[Public broadcasting]]\n*[[Independent radio]]\n*[[Jim Ladd]]\n*''[[Anything Anything with Rich Russo]]''\n*[[Tom Donahue]]\n*[[Payola]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wfmu.org/LCD/21/freeform.html History of Freeform Radio from WFMU]\n*[http://www.channel501.com/kmpx/index.html Brief History of the Broadcast Music Revolution] Introduction to the concepts for young listeners.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Freeform}}\n[[Category:Radio formats]]\n[[Category:Freeform (radio format)| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Radio format in which the disc jockey is given total control over what music to play}}\n{{Other uses|Freeform (disambiguation)}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=May 2008}}\n{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the [[United States]]|date=September 2009}}\n}}\n\n'''Freeform''', or '''freeform radio''', is a [[radio station]] [[Radio programming|programming]] [[Radio format|format]] in which the [[disc jockey]] is given total control over what music to play, regardless of [[music genre]] or commercial interests. Freeform radio stands in contrast to most commercial radio stations, in which [[Disc jockey|DJs]] have little or no influence over programming structure or [[playlist]]s. In the [[United States]], freeform DJs are still bound by [[Federal Communications Commission]] regulations.\n\n==History in the United States==\nMany shows claim to be the first freeform radio program, but the earliest on record is \"Nightsounds\" on [[KPFA-FM]] in [[Berkeley, California]], D.J.'d by [[John Leonard (critic)|John Leonard]]. Probably the best-remembered in the Midwest is [[Beaker Street]], which ran for almost 10 years on KAAY \"The Mighty 1090\" in Little Rock, Arkansas, beginning in 1966, making it also probably the best-known such show on an AM station; its signal reached from Canada to Mexico and Cuba, blanketing the Midwest and Midsouth of the U.S. [[WFMU]] is currently the longest-running freeform radio station in the [[United States]]. WNEW-FM 102.7 in NYC was the first commercial station in the US to introduce a freeform format. It stayed that way under the ownership of [[Metromedia|Metromedia Broadcasting]] till it was sold and the new owners were not interested. WNEW-FM was a leader in introducing new music and making household names of a good deal of the bands we know from the 1960s and '70s. [[Jim Ladd]] of [[KLOS]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] was one of the most notable freeform DJs. Tom Petty wrote a song about Jim Ladd called \"[[The Last DJ]]\". The only time Jim Ladd didn't have complete control over what music is being played is when he turned control over to his faithful listeners commonly referred to as \"The Tribe\".<ref>[http://www.wfmu.org/LCD/21/freeform.html \"A Brief History of Freeform Radio\"], Lowest Common Denominator, Issue #21 (c. 1998)</ref>\nOn October 26, 2011, Ladd was among various staffers let go from KLOS following the acquisition of station owner [[Citadel Broadcasting]] by [[Cumulus Media]]. As of 2012 Ladd is hosting a daily freeform show on [[Sirius XM Radio|Sirius XM's]] [[Deep Tracks]].\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"FM's free-form progressivism had proven essential to the pop process. But the new radio was only another example of the quirkish vitality of a new [[mass culture]] (call it [[youth culture|youth]], call it [[popular culture|pop]]) that seemed destined to defy the [[status quo]].\"|source=\u2014 ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981)<ref>{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=0899190251|chapter=The Guide|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg70/guide.php|accessdate=March 30, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}\n\nThe freeform [[ethos]] tends to disdain playlists confined to a single [[music genre]]. However, DJs may opt to play selections according to an arbitrary theme (e.g., [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]\" followed by [[Radiohead]]'s \"Subterranean Homesick Alien\"). Freeform-ish stations that played only or almost only rock music were known as [[progressive rock (radio format)|progressive rock]] stations, while those that play mostly [[American folk music|folk]] and/or [[country music|country]]-leaning cuts are known as [[Americana (music)|Americana]] stations.\n\nCommercial freeform radio stations were common in the late 1960s and early '70s, particularly on the [[FM broadcasting|FM]] band, but are rare today. An exceptional case was [[KDLD|Indie 103.1]] [[FM band|FM]] of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] and [[Newport Beach, California]]. Indie 103.1 broadcast radio programs in which famous musicians from the world of [[popular music]] host radio programs and choose the playlist.  Indie 103.1 recently left the FM airwaves, but currently continues on the internet.\n\nAnother commercial freeform radio station is [[KHUM]], \"radio without the rules,\" at 104.3 and 104.7 FM in Ferndale, California. KHUM has transmitted since 1996 and is the most popular station in [[Humboldt County, California]].\n\n[[Internet radio]] and, to a lesser extent, [[college radio]] are sanctuaries of the freeform format (although even the latter has lost much of its independence as stations begin modeling corporate stations in their presentation). On [[Sirius XM Radio|Sirius XM]] [[satellite radio]], the weekly [[Bob Dylan]]-hosted ''[[Theme Time Radio Hour]]'' featured a freeform format, as do several specialty programs on [[The Loft (Sirius XM)|The Loft]]. The nationally syndicated ''Undercurrents'', distributed by [[Native Voice One]], follows a freeform format. Many terrestrial freeform stations are small and lack corporate backing, and therefore have relatively weak radio [[transmitter]]s (especially around [[metropolitan area]]s where corporate radio signals dominate, but at the same time have enough of a population density to cover enough people to support such a station), a problem that has caused numerous broadcasters to transition to [[Internet radio]], [[pirate radio]] or both.\n\nThe [[full service (radio format)|full service]] format can be seen as a variant of the freeform format, though since most full-service stations are located in rural areas, [[country music]], [[adult standards]], [[classic hits]] ([[oldies]] or [[classic rock]]), and occasionally [[adult contemporary music]] tend to form the bulk of the music on a full-service station, and the vast majority of full-service stations focus primarily on mainstream, popular music (whereas freeform stations often put the emphasis on less widely known or more exotic selections).\n\n==Freeform stations==\n\n===United States===\n\n{{Expand list|date=January 2014}}\n*[[KALX]] ([[Berkeley, California]])\n*[[KAOS (FM)|KAOS]] ([[Olympia, Washington]])\n*[[KBGA]] ([[Missoula, Montana]])\n*[[KBOO]] ([[Portland, Oregon]])\n*[[KBUT]] ([[Crested Butte, Colorado]])\n*[[KCOU]] ([[University of Missouri]], [[Columbia, Missouri]])\n*[[KCR (SDSU)|KCR]] ([[San Diego State University]], [[San Diego, California]])\n*[[KCRW]] ([[Santa Monica College]], [[Santa Monica, California]])\n*[[KCSB-FM]] ([[University of California, Santa Barbara]], [[Goleta, California]])\n*[[KDHX]] ([[St. Louis, Missouri]])\n*[[KDVS]] ([[University of California, Davis]], [[Davis, California]])\n*[[KDEO]] ([[Radio Free Hawaii, Waipahu, Oahu, Hawaii]])\n*[[KEOL]] ([[Eastern Oregon University]], [[La Grande, Oregon]])\n*[[KFAT (defunct)]], ([[Gilroy, California]])\n*[[KFFP-LP]] ([[Portland, Oregon]] [[Freeform Portland]]) \n*[[KFJC]] ([[Foothill College]], [[Los Altos Hills, California]])\n*[[KHUM]] ([[Ferndale, California]])\n*[[KJHK]] ([[University of Kansas]], [[Lawrence, Kansas]])\n*[[KMMT]] ([[Mammoth Lakes, California]])\n*[[KMNR]] ([[Missouri University of Science and Technology]], [[Rolla, Missouri]])\n*[[KMUD]] ([[Garberville, California]])\n*[[KOPN]] ([[Columbia, Missouri]])\n*[[KPSU (Portland)|KPSU]] ([[Portland State University]], [[Portland, Oregon]])\n*[[KRBX]] ([[Boise, Idaho]])\n*[[KRHV]] ([[Big Pine, California]])\n*[[KRLX]] ([[Carleton College]], [[Northfield, Minnesota]])\n*[[KRUI-FM|KRUI]] ([[University of Iowa]], [[Iowa City, Iowa]])\n*[[KSPC]] ([[Pomona College]], Claremont, California)\n*[[KTEC]] ([[Oregon Institute of Technology]], [[Klamath Falls, Oregon]])\n*[[KTEQ-FM]] ([[South Dakota School of Mines and Technology]], [[Rapid City, South Dakota]])\n*[[KTRM]] ([[Truman State University]], [[Kirksville, Missouri]])\n*[[K-UTE]] ([[University of Utah]], [[Salt Lake City, Utah]])\n*[[KUCI]] ([[University of California, Irvine]], [[Irvine, California]])\n*[[KUOI]] ([[University of Idaho]], [[Moscow, Idaho]])\n*[[KURE]] ([[Iowa State University]].

It is one of the four charter franchises of the [[National Women's Hockey League]] (NWHL).  Its name and colors are an homage to the former [[National Hockey League|NHL]] and [[World Hockey Association|WHA]] franchise known as the [[Hartford Whalers]].\n\n==History==\nFor their first season, the Whale played home games in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] at Chelsea Piers.

The team is the second professional hockey team to bear the Connecticut Whale name, following the [[American Hockey League]] team previously and currently known as the [[Hartford Wolf Pack]].\n\nAmong their off-season acquisitions, the Whale signed [[Kaleigh Fratkin]] to a contract on July 1, 2015. She was the first Canadian player to sign a contract in the NWHL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nwhl.co/whale-signs-fratkin-first-canadian-in-the-nwhl/|title=Whale signs Kaleigh Fratkin, First Canadian in the NWHL|website=NWHL.co |date=2015-07-01|accessdate=2016-01-06}}</ref>\n\nThe team made its debut in the [[2015\u201316 NWHL season|2015\u201316 season]].

In the same game, Kelli Stack had one goal and two assists, becoming the first player to record a multi-point performance. Whale goaltender Jaimie Leonoff was credited the win, capturing the game's First Star. Stack was recognized as the Second Star, and [[Kelly Babstock]], who became the first Canadian-born player to score a goal in an NWHL regular season game, was acknowledged as the Third Star.\n\nThe Whale won their first three games in franchise history with three different goalies. In the first game, the Whale prevailed with Jaimie Leonoff, while former Quinnipiac goaltender Chelsea Laden captured the second win, and Nicole Stock played her first game in over five years to capture the third win on the road against the New York Riveters.\n\nPrior to the team's second season, the Whale moved to the [[Northford Ice Pavilion]] in [[Northford, Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite web

Connecticut]]. It is one of the four charter franchises of the [[National Women's Hockey League]] (NWHL).  Its name and colors are an homage to the former [[National Hockey League|NHL]] and [[World Hockey Association|WHA]] franchise known as the [[Hartford Whalers]].\n\n==History==\nFor their first season, the Whale played home games in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] at Chelsea Piers. Chris Ardito was hired as the first general manager in franchise history,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nwhl.co/pro-hockey-returns-to-connecticut/|title=The Whale Brings Pro Hockey Back to the Nutmeg State|website=NWHL.co}}</ref> while Jake Mastel and Lisa Giovanelli coached the team. The team is the second professional hockey team to bear the Connecticut Whale name, following the [[American Hockey League]] team previously and currently known as the [[Hartford Wolf Pack]].\n\nAmong their off-season acquisitions, the Whale signed [[Kaleigh Fratkin]] to a contract on July 1, 2015. She was the first Canadian player to sign a contract in the NWHL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nwhl.co/whale-signs-fratkin-first-canadian-in-the-nwhl/|title=Whale signs Kaleigh Fratkin, First Canadian in the NWHL|website=NWHL.co |date=2015-07-01|accessdate=2016-01-06}}</ref>\n\nThe team made its debut in the [[2015\u201316 NWHL season|2015\u201316 season]].

In the same game, Kelli Stack had one goal and two assists, becoming the first player to record a multi-point performance. Whale goaltender Jaimie Leonoff was credited the win, capturing the game's First Star. Stack was recognized as the Second Star, and [[Kelly Babstock]], who became the first Canadian-born player to score a goal in an NWHL regular season game, was acknowledged as the Third Star.\n\nThe Whale won their first three games in franchise history with three different goalies. In the first game, the Whale prevailed with Jaimie Leonoff, while former Quinnipiac goaltender Chelsea Laden captured the second win, and Nicole Stock played her first game in over five years to capture the third win on the road against the New York Riveters.\n\nPrior to the team's second season, the Whale moved to the [[Northford Ice Pavilion]] in [[Northford, Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite web

{"title_page": "Sizang people", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=January 2007}}\n[[File:Siyin chiefs.jpg|thumb|Siyin chiefs in British Burma.]]\n'''The Siyin (Sizang) people''' or the '''Thaute people'''  meaning someone with a stout or sturdy build. Siyin are mainly the descendants of [[Pu Thuantak]] as also known as Suantak in [[Tedim language]] and related [[clan]]s, and their adopted sons and daughters.  The [[Siyin Valley]] is located in the present day [[Chin State]], [[Burma]], founded by the descendants of the Pu Thuantak, when they moved away from their original home of [[Ciimnuai]] with other [[Zo (people)|Zo]] (Chin) people such as the [[Sukte people|Sukte]], [[Thadou people|Thado]], [[Zou people|Zou]], and other related tribes.\n\nZo lived collectively in the place known as [[Ciimnuai]], for a long period of time until they experienced [[Human overpopulation|population explosion]]. Finding new settlements then became essential for their survival for [[Tillage|cultivation]], in the hope of getting sufficient food from fertile soil for each community. Consequently, they scattered throughout the mountains, dales and valleys within and surrounding the present Chin State. Due to communication difficulties and their isolation, each departed group from Ciimnuai developed a unique [[dialect]]. The [[Sizang language]] emerged the same way{{clarify|date=May 2012}} as [[Vaiphei language|Vaiphei]], [[Teizang]], [[Saizang]], Val, Zou, Dim, [[Khuangsai]], [[Hangmi/Milhiem]] and others, and are closely related to one another.\n\n==Meaning and definition==\n''Si'' means salt water; ''Zang'' means the northern side or plain.  ''Sizang'' is known as Siyin thus represents people who live at the northern part of ''the spring of salt water''. ''Sizang'' was already the name of a place to which [[immigrant]]s from Ciimuai relocated.  Later generations that continued to live in the same location, have adopted ''Sizang'' as their [[ethnic group|ethnic identity]].\n\n===Culture and Tradition===\nThe siyin (sizang) had a proud warrior tradition that is somewhat similar to the [[Naga people]] with slight variations. The Siyin widely practiced head hunting and kept the head in the main hall of the village (innpi) and when a siyin die it is the duty of his/her family to dry up the body before the burial which usually take months .{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}.\n\n===Religion===\nBefore their [[religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Christianity]], the Siyin (Sizang) were [[animist]]s, worshipping nature, Doai (Devil/spirit), and Pathian (God). They worshiped unknown spirits in order to avoid being harmed.

Siyin are mainly the descendants of [[Pu Thuantak]] as also known as Suantak in [[Tedim language]] and related [[clan]]s, and their adopted sons and daughters.  The [[Siyin Valley]] is located in the present day [[Chin State]], [[Burma]], founded by the descendants of the Pu Thuantak, when they moved away from their original home of [[Ciimnuai]] with other [[Zo (people)|Zo]] (Chin) people such as the [[Sukte people|Sukte]], [[Thadou people|Thado]], [[Zou people|Zou]], and other related tribes.\n\nZo lived collectively in the place known as [[Ciimnuai]], for a long period of time until they experienced [[Human overpopulation|population explosion]]. Finding new settlements then became essential for their survival for [[Tillage|cultivation]], in the hope of getting sufficient food from fertile soil for each community. Consequently, they scattered throughout the mountains, dales and valleys within and surrounding the present Chin State. Due to communication difficulties and their isolation, each departed group from Ciimnuai developed a unique [[dialect]]. The [[Sizang language]] emerged the same way{{clarify|date=May 2012}} as [[Vaiphei language|Vaiphei]], [[Teizang]], [[Saizang]], Val, Zou, Dim, [[Khuangsai]], [[Hangmi/Milhiem]] and others, and are closely related to one another.\n\n==Meaning and definition==\n''Si'' means salt water; ''Zang'' means the northern side or plain.  ''Sizang'' is known as Siyin thus represents people who live at the northern part of ''the spring of salt water''. ''Sizang'' was already the name of a place to which [[immigrant]]s from Ciimuai relocated.  Later generations that continued to live in the same location, have adopted ''Sizang'' as their [[ethnic group|ethnic identity]].\n\n===Culture and Tradition===\nThe siyin (sizang) had a proud warrior tradition that is somewhat similar to the [[Naga people]] with slight variations. The Siyin widely practiced head hunting and kept the head in the main hall of the village (innpi) and when a siyin die it is the duty of his/her family to dry up the body before the burial which usually take months .{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}.\n\n===Religion===\nBefore their [[religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Christianity]], the Siyin (Sizang) were [[animist]]s, worshipping nature, Doai (Devil/spirit), and Pathian (God). They worshiped unknown spirits in order to avoid being harmed.
