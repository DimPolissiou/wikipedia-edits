She was the eleventh of thirteen children, and the youngest female of the Scottish immigrant farmer, George McGillivray (1813-1894) and his wife, Caroline Amelia Fothergill McGillivray (1828-1909). McGillivray had three close siblings; Elizabeth Fothergill McGillivray Hillary (1847-1877), Mary Eliza McGillivray (1849-1911) and William McGillivray (1865-1904).\n\nIn 1870, the family moved to Inverlynn, a house located at 1300 Gifford Street in Whitby, Ontario. To this day, the property has remained in the possession of George McGillivray`s descendants. The children attended a grammar school in Whitby, and she had shown artistic talent in her early childhood years so she pursued her art by attending The Central Ontario School of Art, where she studied under Professor [[William Cruikshank (painter)|William Cruikshank]].

Her artwork is expressed mainly with vivid colours of contouring shapes and dabs of paint that simplifies the form of an object.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Later Years==\nMcGillivray traveled extensively in search of new landscape scenery to paint. In 1930, by then in her mid-60s, McGillivray bought a house in Toronto where she retired.<ref name=\":1\" /> She continued to paint primarily from the sketches she had accumulated from around the world. As a landscape painter, McGillivray found some prestige and recognition while alive, but not quite as much as Thomson though she had encouraged him in his modernist path. Painting landscapes in a modernist style was not something expected from a woman in the early 1900s. McGillivray never married and left no children. She died at age 74 in Toronto, on May 7, 1938.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Allen, Bill. \"Up the Gatineau!\" ''Following Florence'' XLII, 2016.\n* Art Gallery of Ontario. \"The Canadian Collection.\" ''Art Gallery of Ontario'', 288-289.

Her art works expresses a view of landscape in bold colours that would be categorized later on as part of the Group of Seven landscape painting that captures the two visions of the land: the romantic-realist view of the railway artists of the 1880s and the heroic view of the landscape in the 1890s.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nShe joined the Womens Art Association of Canada where she studied painting on china with Mary E. Dignam, its founding president.<ref name=\":1\" /> McGillivray was welcomed into communities and numerous social affairs which included the Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and the Women Painters and Sculptors Art Club (Women Painters and Sculptors 1917) which were both centralized in New York City.<ref name=\"cwahi.concordia.ca\" /> She continued her study of painting on china  with Marshall Fry in New York in 1898 and sold her pieces later from her studio in Whitby <ref name=\":1\" />. She also gave painting classes in Whitby.<ref name=\":1\" /> She became an instructor and a critic at an all boys\u2019 school in Pickering College and an assistant art instructor at the Ontario's Ladies\u2019 College in the 1900s and later, the head of the art department.<ref name=\"images.ourontario.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://images.ourontario.ca/whitby/43070/data|title=Florence Helena McGillivray, 1906|website=images.ourontario.ca}}</ref> \n\nThe artist also helped encourage fellow Canadian artist [[Tom Thomson]], who was praised for his landscape paintings.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 1913 during her trip in Paris, her instructors  at the [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re|Academie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]] were Lucien Simon and Emile-Rene Menard.

Her works of art in this mode were acknowledged and she was invited to display her paintings at the Salon des Beaux Arts.<ref name=\"cwahi.concordia.ca\" /> Not long later, it is said, the artist was voted as president of the International Union.<ref name=\":2\" />  In the later years of McGillivray's life she joined the [[Ontario Society of Artists]] (1917), she was elected an Associate member of the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]](1924),<ref name=\":1\" /> and was a Charter member of the Canadian Society of Painters in Watercolour and its first woman member. <ref name=\"images.ourontario.ca\" /> \n  \n== Influence and Style ==\n[[File:St. Anthony Harbour, Newfoundland, Florence H. McGillivray.jpg|thumb|St. Anthony Harbour, Newfoundland, Florence H. McGillivray Canadian, 1864 - 1938 oil on canvas 46.7 x 61.6&nbsp;cm Purchased 1926 National Gallery of Canada (no. 3352)]]\n\nMcGillivray traveled across Canada for inspiration.<ref name=\":1\" /> She painted her environment using bold colours and the contour of shapes.<ref name=\":1\" /> McGillivray's artistic style stressed the \"abstract qualities of lines, shapes and forms\"<ref name=\":1\" /> that was expressed in her work through a large amount of paint applied using the palette knife in her oil paintings.<ref name=\":1\" /> Working outdoors, the painter developed a powerful style that defined her career.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHer inspiration derived from various environments<ref name=\":1\" /> including her hometown of Whitby, and her travel to the Gatineau area <ref name=\":0\" />, as well as to Eastern Canada, including Newfoundland, and to Trinidad, Jamaica, Bahama Islands in the West Indies, Alaska, Eastern United States, Western Canada, Venice, Italy and the Swiss Alps.<ref name=\"cwahi.concordia.ca\" /> She worked in many media which included watercolour, pastel and oil.<ref name=\":1\" /> During her trip to Europe, she had encountered newly forming art styles of Symbolism and Post Impressionism that impacted and influenced her art. Her artwork is expressed mainly with vivid colours of contouring shapes and dabs of paint that simplifies the form of an object.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Later Years==\nMcGillivray traveled extensively in search of new landscape scenery to paint. In 1930, by then in her mid-60s, McGillivray bought a house in Toronto where she retired.<ref name=\":1\" /> She continued to paint primarily from the sketches she had accumulated from around the world. As a landscape painter, McGillivray found some prestige and recognition while alive, but not quite as much as Thomson though she had encouraged him in his modernist path. Painting landscapes in a modernist style was not something expected from a woman in the early 1900s. McGillivray never married and left no children. She died at age 74 in Toronto, on May 7, 1938.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Allen, Bill. \"Up the Gatineau!\" ''Following Florence'' XLII, 2016.\n* Art Gallery of Ontario. \"The Canadian Collection.\" ''Art Gallery of Ontario'', 288-289.

He received his B.S. degree from the [[Air Force Academy]] in 1964. Later, he earned MS degrees in Aeronautics and Astronautics and in Electrical Engineering from [[MIT]], and, in 1971, a Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from [[Stanford University]].\n\n==Military and government career==\nKaminski served 20 years on active duty in the U.S. Air Force, mostly within Air Force Systems Command, rising to the rank of full colonel. Among other Air Force assignments, Kaminski was responsible for test and evaluation of [[inertial guidance]] components for the [[LGM-30 Minuteman]] missile and terminal guidance systems for the first U.S. [[precision-guided munition]]s.<ref name=\"mda\">U.S. Missile Defense Agency, [http://www.mda.mil/about/kaminiski_award.html \"Dr. Paul G.

During that time he met Under Secretary of Defense [[William J. Perry]], and became Perry's Special Assistant in 1977. One of his assignments was to assess early work on [[stealth technology]].  Kaminski recommended going ahead with the creation of a large program that included, already by 1978, the experimental [[Have Blue]] airplane.<ref name=\"soe\"/><ref name=\"blue\">David C.

He received his B.S. degree from the [[Air Force Academy]] in 1964. Later, he earned MS degrees in Aeronautics and Astronautics and in Electrical Engineering from [[MIT]], and, in 1971, a Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from [[Stanford University]].\n\n==Military and government career==\nKaminski served 20 years on active duty in the U.S. Air Force, mostly within Air Force Systems Command, rising to the rank of full colonel. Among other Air Force assignments, Kaminski was responsible for test and evaluation of [[inertial guidance]] components for the [[LGM-30 Minuteman]] missile and terminal guidance systems for the first U.S. [[precision-guided munition]]s.<ref name=\"mda\">U.S. Missile Defense Agency, [http://www.mda.mil/about/kaminiski_award.html \"Dr. Paul G.

During that time he met Under Secretary of Defense [[William J. Perry]], and became Perry's Special Assistant in 1977. One of his assignments was to assess early work on [[stealth technology]].  Kaminski recommended going ahead with the creation of a large program that included, already by 1978, the experimental [[Have Blue]] airplane.<ref name=\"soe\"/><ref name=\"blue\">David C. Aronstein and Albert C.
