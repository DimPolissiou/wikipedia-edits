Its population in the 2014 census was 2,240.\n\nThal is the birthplace of bodybuilder, actor, and politician [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], who lived there until the age of 19. In July 2011, Schwarzenegger opened his childhood house as the Arnold Schwarzenegger Museum.\n\n==History==\nThe first forest village settlement was established in the 10th century. In the following two centuries, scattered hamlets grew up in the area. On 1 January 1850, the settlement became known as \"St. Jacob Thal\". On 1 January 1895, the village became a settlement with market town (\"Marktgemeinde\") status.\n\n==Geography==\nThe village is located about {{cvt|3.2|km}} west of the Styrian capital of [[Graz]]. Thal is a scattered settlement of houses, consisting of about 19 grouped hamlets: Eben, Eck, Hardt, Haslau, Kirchberg, K\u00f6tschberg, Linak, Oberbichl, Oberthal, Plabutsch, Schl\u00fcsselhof, Steinberg, Unterbichl, Unterthal, Waldsdorf, Waldsdorfberg, Wendlleiten, Windhof, and Winkel. The village contains a small lake called Thalersee.\n\n==Notable landmarks==\n===Parish church of St. Jacob===\nIn 1735, a wooden chapel was built in Baroque style. In 1772, the parish church of St. Jacob was built and originally dedicated to [[St. Sebastian]]. It was extended in 1992, with the foundation stone laid on May 23, 1992 and the church was consecrated on 15 May 1994 by Johann Weber. The extension to the existing church was by the architect Manfred Fuchs Bichler, and the Austrian painter, graphic artist and architect Ernst Fuchs. The artistic design of the entire complex with bright colors and shapes and impressive lighting effects received critical acclaim.\n\n=== Oberthal House ===\n[[File:Thalersee im Herbst.jpg|thumb|right|Thalersee, pictured in October 2002]]\nBy the 12th century, the lords of Waldsdorf had established their seat on the site of the present stately home in the shape of a fortified manor house with a large dairy farm. From 1315 to 1605 it was owned by the noble family of [[Windisch-Graetz]]. In 1563 major conversion and renovation work was carried out on the castle under the then-owner and designer, Erasmus of Windisch-Graetz, which saw it expanded into a [[Renaissance]] style stately home with a courtyard surrounded on three sides by three-storey high, columnar [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s. There is still an underground passage, dating to that period, that runs as far as Graz, but it is impassable after the first several hundred metres.\n\nFrom 1605 to 1622 the house was owned by Bernard Walter of Walthersweil and, from 1622 to 1624, by the Schranz of Schranzenegg family, who sold it to Siegmund Friedrich, Count Trautmannsdorff. During the rule of Sigmund Frederick the Younger of Trautmannsdorff, Oberthal House was converted and expanded between 1656 and 1661 into one of the most splendid in the area around the state capital. Above the house, a large pleasure garden (''Lustgarten'') was established, based on French prototypes, surrounded by a wall and decorated with grottos and a small [[maison de plaisance]]. In 1798 Thal House and its estate was sold to Leopold Edler of Warnhauser and remained in the possession of his family until 1841. From 1841 onwards the palace was owned by the ''[[Freiherr]]en'' of Walterskirchen. In 1846 the house was remodelled into the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style of a [[Scotland|Scottish]] castle.\n\nIn 1905 Oberthal was sold to a [[Slovenia]]n consortium, who had to give up the property after a short time for financial reasons. The house subsequently changed hands several times in the ensuing period and steadily fell into a state of dilapidation until it ended up in the hands of Dr. Friedrich Schuster, who had the building repaired again, getting rid of the 1846 modifications and reinstating its original Baroque appearance. In 1940 the house and the estate went to the Essberger family. From 1945 to 1955 the British garrison headquarters was located here, and from 1955 to 1957 part of the house was rented to the British ambassador. On 1 November 1958 the house was restored to John Theodor Essberger, who died in 1959, whereupon his daughter, Lieselotte [[House of Rantzau|von Rantzau]] inherited it. Frau Liselotte von Rantzau died in 1993, since when it has been owned by her sons, Dr. Eberhart and Heinrich von Rantzau.\n\n=== Ruins of Thal Castle ===\nThal Castle was first mentioned in the records in 1259, having been built on a hillock between the present parish church and the lake of Thalersee, probably at the beginning of the 13th century. The castle was surrounded by a thick defensive wall with embrasures and battlement walks (''Wehrg\u00e4nge''). Within the wall was the ''[[Palas]]'' and other residential buildings like the castle church dedicated to St. James. In 1569, Unterthal Castle and the estates of Sebastian of Windisch-Graetz were sold to the [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]]n governor (''Landeshauptmann''), [[Georg von Khevenh\u00fcller]]. From 1621, when it was owned by the Eggenberger family, the castle fell into ruins. In 1715 a fire destroyed large parts of the fortress. By around 1750 the castle church had also fallen into ruins. In 1772 the statue of the church patron was ceremoniously transferred to the present parish church and the old church demolished. In the subsequent period only the round tower was occupied until 1979. In 1996 parts of the castle were restored and made habitable again.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://archive.is/20070929080309/http://www.thalbeigraz.at/thalwiki/index.php/Hauptseite Thal im Wiki]\n\n{{Cities and towns in Graz-Umgebung (district)}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Arnold Schwarzenegger]]\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Graz-Umgebung District]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|a village near Graz|a list of various other places of that name|Thal (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name            = Thal\n| native_name     = \n| settlement_type = \n<!-- Images     -->\n| image_skyline   = Pfarrkirche St.Jakob in Thal bei Graz 09.561.jpg\n| imagesize       = 300px\n| image_caption   = Thal's local church in July 2009\n| image_shield    = AUT Thal COA.gif\n| shield_size     = 80x110px\n| shield_link     = \n<!-- Maps           -->\n| pushpin_map         = Austria\n| pushpin_mapsize     = 270\n| pushpin_map_caption = Location within Austria\n| image_map           = Thal in GU.png\n| mapsize             = 260x260px\n| map_alt             =\n| map_caption         = Location within Graz-Umgebung district\n<!-- Location    -->\n| coordinates       = {{coord|47|04|42|N|15|21|15|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type  = Country\n| subdivision_name  = [[Austria]]\n| subdivision_type1 = [[States of Austria|State]]\n| subdivision_name1 = [[Styria]]\n| subdivision_type2 = [[District (Austria)|District]]\n| subdivision_name2 = [[Graz-Umgebung District|Graz-Umgebung]]\n| parts_type        = \n| parts_style       = para\n| p1                = \n<!-- Leaders -->\n| leader_title  = [[Burgomaster|Mayor]]\n| leader_name   = Peter Schickhofer\n| leader_party  = {{Polparty|Austria| SP\u00d6 }}\n| leader_title1 = \n| leader_name1  = \n<!-- Statistics -->\n| area_footnotes   = {{Austria population Wikidata|area_footnotes}}\n| area_total_km2   = {{Austria population Wikidata|area_total_km2}}\n| area_metro_km2   = \n| elevation_m      = 440\n| elevation_max_m  = \n| elevation_min_m  = \n| population_as_of = {{Austria population Wikidata|population_as_of}}\n| population_footnotes = {{Austria population Wikidata|population_footnotes}}\n| population_total = {{Austria population Wikidata|population_total}}\n| population_urban =  \n| population_metro =  \n| population_note  = \n| population_density_km2 = auto\n| established_title = \n| established_date  = \n| timezone          = [[Central European Time|CET]]\n| timezone_DST      = [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n| utc_offset        = +1\n| utc_offset_DST    = +2\n| registration_plate = [[Vehicle registration plates of Austria|GU]]\n| postal_code_type   = [[List of postal codes in Austria|Postal code]]\n| postal_code        = 8051, 8052, 8151\n| area_code_type = [[Telephone numbers in Austria|Area code]]\n| area_code      = 0316\n| website   = [http://www.thal.steiermark.at/ www.thal.steiermark.at]\n| footnotes = \n}}\n'''Thal''' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8ta\u02d0l}}) is a village in the Austrian state of [[Styria]], about {{convert|3.2|km}} west from the edge of [[Graz]], Austria's second largest city.

Thal is a scattered settlement of houses, consisting of about 19 grouped hamlets: Eben, Eck, Hardt, Haslau, Kirchberg, K\u00f6tschberg, Linak, Oberbichl, Oberthal, Plabutsch, Schl\u00fcsselhof, Steinberg, Unterbichl, Unterthal, Waldsdorf, Waldsdorfberg, Wendlleiten, Windhof, and Winkel. The village contains a small lake called Thalersee.\n\n==Notable landmarks==\n===Parish church of St. Jacob===\nIn 1735, a wooden chapel was built in Baroque style. In 1772, the parish church of St. Jacob was built and originally dedicated to [[St. Sebastian]]. It was extended in 1992, with the foundation stone laid on May 23, 1992 and the church was consecrated on 15 May 1994 by Johann Weber. The extension to the existing church was by the architect Manfred Fuchs Bichler, and the Austrian painter, graphic artist and architect Ernst Fuchs. The artistic design of the entire complex with bright colors and shapes and impressive lighting effects received critical acclaim.\n\n=== Oberthal House ===\n[[File:Thalersee im Herbst.jpg|thumb|right|Thalersee, pictured in October 2002]]\nBy the 12th century, the lords of Waldsdorf had established their seat on the site of the present stately home in the shape of a fortified manor house with a large dairy farm. From 1315 to 1605 it was owned by the noble family of [[Windisch-Graetz]]. In 1563 major conversion and renovation work was carried out on the castle under the then-owner and designer, Erasmus of Windisch-Graetz, which saw it expanded into a [[Renaissance]] style stately home with a courtyard surrounded on three sides by three-storey high, columnar [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s. There is still an underground passage, dating to that period, that runs as far as Graz, but it is impassable after the first several hundred metres.\n\nFrom 1605 to 1622 the house was owned by Bernard Walter of Walthersweil and, from 1622 to 1624, by the Schranz of Schranzenegg family, who sold it to Siegmund Friedrich, Count Trautmannsdorff. During the rule of Sigmund Frederick the Younger of Trautmannsdorff, Oberthal House was converted and expanded between 1656 and 1661 into one of the most splendid in the area around the state capital. Above the house, a large pleasure garden (''Lustgarten'') was established, based on French prototypes, surrounded by a wall and decorated with grottos and a small [[maison de plaisance]]. In 1798 Thal House and its estate was sold to Leopold Edler of Warnhauser and remained in the possession of his family until 1841. From 1841 onwards the palace was owned by the ''[[Freiherr]]en'' of Walterskirchen. In 1846 the house was remodelled into the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style of a [[Scotland|Scottish]] castle.\n\nIn 1905 Oberthal was sold to a [[Slovenia]]n consortium, who had to give up the property after a short time for financial reasons. The house subsequently changed hands several times in the ensuing period and steadily fell into a state of dilapidation until it ended up in the hands of Dr. Friedrich Schuster, who had the building repaired again, getting rid of the 1846 modifications and reinstating its original Baroque appearance. In 1940 the house and the estate went to the Essberger family. From 1945 to 1955 the British garrison headquarters was located here, and from 1955 to 1957 part of the house was rented to the British ambassador. On 1 November 1958 the house was restored to John Theodor Essberger, who died in 1959, whereupon his daughter, Lieselotte [[House of Rantzau|von Rantzau]] inherited it. Frau Liselotte von Rantzau died in 1993, since when it has been owned by her sons, Dr. Eberhart and Heinrich von Rantzau.\n\n=== Ruins of Thal Castle ===\nThal Castle was first mentioned in the records in 1259, having been built on a hillock between the present parish church and the lake of Thalersee, probably at the beginning of the 13th century. The castle was surrounded by a thick defensive wall with embrasures and battlement walks (''Wehrg\u00e4nge''). Within the wall was the ''[[Palas]]'' and other residential buildings like the castle church dedicated to St. James. In 1569, Unterthal Castle and the estates of Sebastian of Windisch-Graetz were sold to the [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]]n governor (''Landeshauptmann''), [[Georg von Khevenh\u00fcller]]. From 1621, when it was owned by the Eggenberger family, the castle fell into ruins. In 1715 a fire destroyed large parts of the fortress. By around 1750 the castle church had also fallen into ruins. In 1772 the statue of the church patron was ceremoniously transferred to the present parish church and the old church demolished. In the subsequent period only the round tower was occupied until 1979. In 1996 parts of the castle were restored and made habitable again.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://archive.is/20070929080309/http://www.thalbeigraz.at/thalwiki/index.php/Hauptseite Thal im Wiki]\n\n{{Cities and towns in Graz-Umgebung (district)}}\n\n[[Category:Arnold Schwarzenegger]]\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Graz-Umgebung District]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thal,_Styria"}

The young artiste kept his cool, saying, 'If you want us to dress like that, in torn clothes, we can.'\"</ref>\n\nSince 2007, SBT Delhi is running the [[Salaam Baalak City Walk - New Delhi|City Walk Program]], a guided tour through [[Paharganj]] and [[New Delhi Railway Station]] area. The guides are former street children from the Trust. The walk aims to sensitise participants about street life, street children and Indian society problems; and uniquely engages them in the lives of children in distress. During the Walk, the guides share their personal story of survival with the participants and show them the contact points and shelter homes SBT provides. The walk, thus, also provides an opportunity for the young people to improve their [[communication]] and [[marketing]] skills. All proceeds go directly to the Trust to enable more opportunities to be made for the children; thus the walk is 100% non-profit making. During 2012\u201313, under the City Walk Program, about 593 walks were conducted and 4849 people were sensitised from across the world.\n\nIn addition to the City Walk tour, SBT also offers a Heritage Walk through [[Old Delhi]], showcasing six hidden places, including markets, havelis, and five different religions that have existed in the region since 1638. This walk acquaints tourists with all that has survived in Old Delhi since [[Shah Jahan]], the fifth Mughal Emperor who made Delhi the capital of his empire. The walk takes tourists on a rickshaw ride through the city and lands panoramic views of Old Delhi from a spice market rooftop. It ends in an SBT shelter home for boys to offer a glimpse into what street children have survived through.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Salaam Baalak Contact Point Platform New Delhi Railway Station.JPG|right|thumb|250px|SBT contact point for [[street children]] on a platform from [[New Delhi Railway Station]]]]\nOriginally established in 1988 to rehabilitate the children who appeared in the film, ''[[Salaam Bombay!]]'' (1988) in [[Mumbai]], Salaam Baalak Trust started working in 1989, and by 2005 it had 17 centres for street child throughout India.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HEte5ilhCTcC&pg=PA61&dq=Salaam+Baalak+Trust&sig=ACfU3U2zsjEfv-ulxQtXNSID042Ikg_BAw Salaam Baalak Trust] ''Mercy in Her Eyes: The Films of Mira Nair'', by John Kenneth Muir.

A [[trust law|trust]] was created where young street boys and girls could feel secure and could breathe hope. In [[New Delhi]], SBT started its operations with a staff of 3 and 25 children in the open-air balcony of the Police Station at the [[New Delhi Railway Station]].

The guides are former street children from the Trust. The walk aims to sensitise participants about street life, street children and Indian society problems; and uniquely engages them in the lives of children in distress. During the Walk, the guides share their personal story of survival with the participants and show them the contact points and shelter homes SBT provides. The walk, thus, also provides an opportunity for the young people to improve their [[communication]] and [[marketing]] skills. All proceeds go directly to the Trust to enable more opportunities to be made for the children; thus the walk is 100% non-profit making. During 2012-13, under the City Walk Program, about 593 walks were conducted and 4849 people were sensitised from across the world.\n\nIn addition to the City Walk tour, SBT also offers a Heritage Walk through [[Old Delhi]], showcasing six hidden places, including markets, havelis, and five different religions that have existed in the region since 1638. This walk acquaints tourists with all that has survived in Old Delhi since [[Shah Jahan]], the fifth Mughal Emperor who made Delhi the capital of his empire. The walk takes tourists on a rickshaw ride through the city and lands panoramic views of Old Delhi from a spice market rooftop. It ends in an SBT shelter home for boys to offer a glimpse into what street children have survived through.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Salaam Baalak Contact Point Platform New Delhi Railway Station.JPG|right|thumb|250px|SBT contact point for [[street children]] on a platform from [[New Delhi Railway Station]]]]\nOriginally established in 1988 to rehabilitate the children who appeared in the film, ''[[Salaam Bombay!]]'' (1988) in [[Mumbai]], Salaam Baalak Trust started working in 1989, and by 2005 it had 17 centres for street child throughout India.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HEte5ilhCTcC&pg=PA61&dq=Salaam+Baalak+Trust&sig=ACfU3U2zsjEfv-ulxQtXNSID042Ikg_BAw Salaam Baalak Trust] ''Mercy in Her Eyes: The Films of Mira Nair'', by John Kenneth Muir.
