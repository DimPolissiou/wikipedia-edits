The original seven members consisted of [[Millersville University of Pennsylvania|Millersville University]], [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] (NJIT), [[Princeton University]], [[Seton Hall University]], [[The College of New Jersey]] (TCNJ), the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[West Chester University]].

The results of these games will count towards league standings and determine the playoff seeds. The top six teams at the conclusion of the regular season will qualify for the conference playoffs, which are held at a single venue over the course of one weekend. \n\nThe top two seeds receive a bye in the first round. The third seed faces the sixth seed, while the fourth seed faces the fifth. The second round sees the top seed take on the lowest remaining seed, and the second seed take on the highest seed remaining. The two teams that advance will face each-other in the championship game, with the winner receiving both the conference trophy and a birth in the ACHA Southeast Regional Tournament.\n\n==Member

States)|mid-Atlantic]] region of the United States. The conference is part of the [[American Collegiate Hockey Association]] Division 2 and is made up of ten teams from colleges and universities based in [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Original CSCHC Logo.png|thumb|left|150px|The original logo of the CSCHC. Used from 2014<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cschc.pointstreaksites.com/view/cschc/news-1470/news_149567|title=WELCOME {{!}} Colonial States College Hockey Conference|website=cschc.pointstreaksites.com|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref> until 2017.]]\nThe conference was formed on April 14, 2014 by programs previously associated with the [[Great Northeast Collegiate Hockey Conference]] (GNCHC). The original seven members consisted of [[Millersville University of Pennsylvania|Millersville University]], [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] (NJIT), [[Princeton University]], [[Seton Hall University]], [[The College of New Jersey]] (TCNJ), the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[West Chester University]]. The founder and first president of the conference was Tom Hench (2014-2016).

The top six teams at the conclusion of the regular season will qualify for the conference playoffs, which are held at a single venue over the course of one weekend. \n\nThe top two seeds receive a bye in the first round. The third seed faces the sixth seed, while the fourth seed faces the fifth. The second round sees the top seed take on the lowest remaining seed, and the second seed take on the highest seed remaining. The two teams that advance will face each-other in the championship game, with the winner receiving both the conference trophy and a birth in the ACHA Southeast Regional Tournament.\n\n==Member

[[Doron Saphir]] was Hiriya's chairman. Three recycling plants operated at the foot of the mound, grinding building waste into gravel and dry organic matter into [[mulch]], and a patented [[mechanical biological treatment]] demonstration facility where [[municipal solid waste]] was sorted utilising the properties of water.<ref name=NYT/> The facility was a form of [[materials recovery facility]] including [[upflow anaerobic sludge blanket]] [[anaerobic digestion|digesters]] for the provision of [[biogas]], which was in turn used to generate [[renewable energy]] utilising [[gas engine]]s.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn 2007 garden waste was sorted, and tree trunks were sent to the Hiriya carpentry shop to be recycled into wooden furniture such as benches and garden accessories for use in the park.<ref name=AA/> Sixty gas wells have been drilled at the site to collect the methane gas trapped in the landfill. The plant generated all the electricity required by the Hiriya site and sold the excess to the [[Israel Electric Corporation]].<ref name=AA/>\n\n==Ariel Sharon Park==\nPlans were subsequently drawn up to remediate the site and use the mountain and surrounding land as the centerpiece of Ariel Sharon Park .<ref>Dan Association of Towns (2004) A landscape vision, Ayalon Park - planning concepts and design strategies, summary of results and conclusions from the Ayalon Park International Charrette, Tel Aviv, Israel, January 2003</ref> A {{convert|2000|acre|km2|adj=on}} area was demarcated for the park during the term of [[Ariel Sharon]], who was an avid supporter of the project.<ref name=HA/> The planner is landscape architect and urban planner [[Peter Latz]].<ref name=HA>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1082816.html An 'oasis' named Hiriya] Haaretz, 5 May 2009</ref> The park was later named for Sharon.

However, the Alhambra has more options fitted for a given price range. The Alhambra has seven seats\u2014the five rear seats can be folded down or unclipped and removed completely. When removed the seats leave a flat-floored load space, a unique feature for SEAT vehicles at that time. The load volume varies, from 256l with seven seats, to 852l with five seats, and 2610l with only the two front seats fitted.\n\nThe Alhambra was essentially unchanged from 1996 to 2010 but a major restyling in 2000 reflected the new SEAT image. Even so, the Alhambra remained faithful to the original design produced under the Volkswagen Group and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] technology sharing agreement. When Volkswagen and Ford lost market share to other manufacture's MPVs, including the [[Toyota Previa]] and [[Mitsubishi Space Wagon]], they changed the design of their versions.\n\nThe Alhambra, Sharan, and Galaxy were built on the same production line at the joint venture [[AutoEuropa]] plant in [[Palmela]], [[Portugal]], and were essentially the same but with different engine options and interiors. This led to the three vehicles being referred to collectively as the \"Sharalaxy\" or \"Shalambraxy\"{{who|date=October 2012}}.

The following year the production Alhambra was launched at the same motor show and went on sale in June.<ref>SEAT Hoy http://media.seat.com/en/company/368-seat-sa-en-cifras-2005-2009.html</ref> The Alhambra shares most of its components and design with the [[Volkswagen Sharan|VW Sharan Mk1]] and [[Ford Galaxy|Ford Galaxy Mk1]]. However, the Alhambra has more options fitted for a given price range. The Alhambra has seven seats\u2014the five rear seats can be folded down or unclipped and removed completely. When removed the seats leave a flat-floored load space, a unique feature for SEAT vehicles at that time. The load volume varies, from 256l with seven seats, to 852l with five seats, and 2610l with only the two front seats fitted.\n\nThe Alhambra was essentially unchanged from 1996 to 2010 but a major restyling in 2000 reflected the new SEAT image. Even so, the Alhambra remained faithful to the original design produced under the Volkswagen Group and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] technology sharing agreement. When Volkswagen and Ford lost market share to other manufacture's MPVs, including the [[Toyota Previa]] and [[Mitsubishi Space Wagon]], they changed the design of their versions.\n\nThe Alhambra, Sharan, and Galaxy were built on the same production line at the joint venture [[AutoEuropa]] plant in [[Palmela]], [[Portugal]], and were essentially the same but with different engine options and interiors. This led to the three vehicles being referred to collectively as the \"Sharalaxy\" or \"Shalambraxy\"{{who|date=October 2012}}. Ford has now withdrawn from the collaboration, and the [[Ford Galaxy#Galaxy MkIII (2006\u2212)|Galaxy Mk III]] and the [[Ford S-MAX|S-Max]] (a seven-seater based on the [[Ford Mondeo#Mk4|Mondeo Mk IV]] platform) are built in Genk, Belgium, alongside the [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]]. The AutoEuropa plant now produces the [[Volkswagen Scirocco#3rd generation|VW Scirocco III]].\n\nIntroduced in 2009, the environmentally friendly SEAT Alhambra Ecomotive is fitted with the 2.0 TDI {{convert|140|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine producing 159 g/km CO2 emissions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seat.co.uk/content/uk/brand/en/models/ecomotive/ecomotive-alhambra.html |title=SEAT Alhambra Ecomotive |publisher=Seat.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"150\">\n1997 SEAT Alhambra TDi 1.9 Rear.jpg|Seat Alhambra pre-facelift (United Kingdom)\nSEAT Alhambra Mk1 odometer.jpg|SEAT Alhambra first generation pre-facelift instrument panel\nSeat Alhambra Facelift 20090706 front.JPG|Seat Alhambra facelift (Europe)\nSeat Alhambra Facelift 20090706 rear.JPG|Seat Alhambra facelift (Europe)\n</gallery>\n\n===Awards===\n*'Monovolume do Ano' award in 1997, in Portugal<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seat.pt/content/pt/brand/pt/models/alhambra/discover.html |title=Alhambra on SEAT Portugal official site |publisher=Seat.pt |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\n*Petrol\n**1.8L [[straight-4|I4]] {{Convert|110|kW|PS|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} [[Multi-valve|20V]] [[Turbocharger|Turbo]]\n**2.0L I4 {{Convert|85|kW|PS|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}\n**2.8L [[VR6 engine|VR6]] {{Convert|150|kW|PS|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} [[Multi-valve|24V]]\n*Diesel\n**1.9L [[straight-4|I4]] {{Convert|66|kW|PS|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]]\n**1.9L I4 {{Convert|81|kW|PS|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} TDI\n**1.9L I4 {{Convert|85|kW|PS|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} TDI\n**1.9L I4 {{Convert|96|kW|PS|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} TDI\n**1.9L I4 {{Convert|110|kW|PS|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} TDI\n**2.0L I4 {{Convert|103|kW|PS|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} TDI\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Second generation (''Typ'' 7N; 2011\u2013present)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = SEAT Alhambra Mk2 (7N)\n| image = 2012 SEAT Alhambra SE Ecomotive CR 2.0 Front.jpg\n| aka = [[Volkswagen Sharan]] Mk2\n| production = 2011\u20132020\n| body_style = \n| platform = [[Volkswagen Group B platform#B6|Volkswagen Group A6 (PQ46)]]\n| related = [[Volkswagen Sharan]] Mk2\n| engine = ''[[Petrol engine]]s:''<br />1.4 L {{Convert|110|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} TSI<br />2.0 L {{Convert|147|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} TSI<br />''[[Diesel engine]]s:''<br />2.0 L {{Convert|103|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]]<br />2.0 L {{Convert|125|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} TDI\n| transmission = \n| length = {{convert|4850|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = \n| height = \n}}\n\nThe second generation SEAT Alhambra was announced on 19 April 2010 and went on sale in October 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.seat.com/es/noticias-seat/584-seat-invirtio-510-millones-de-euros-en-2009.html |title=New SEAT models for 2010 |publisher=Media.seat.com |date=2010-03-24 |access-date=2012-01-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223013552/http://media.seat.com/es/noticias-seat/584-seat-invirtio-510-millones-de-euros-en-2009.html |archive-date=2012-02-23 |df= }}</ref> At {{convert|4.85|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, it is 22&nbsp;cm longer than the first generation: it is also 9&nbsp;cm wider.

Lennox stated that while on a trip to South Africa in December 2007 to appear at the [[46664 (concerts)|46664]] campaign in Johannesburg, the regional company office of the label failed to return phone calls and e-mails she made to them for three weeks, and had completely failed to promote the Sing project as planned. Upon her return to the UK, Lennox met with the head of Sony BMG UK, Ged Docherty, who was \"mortified\" by the problems she had encountered with the South African branch. However, the debacle (partly inflamed when Lennox's dissatisfaction with the South African office was made public on her blog) led to press reports falsely stating that she was being dropped by Sony BMG. The record company themselves quickly refuted the rumour stating that Lennox's contract with them had merely been fulfilled and that they hoped she would consider remaining with them. The British tabloid, ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', subsequently printed a retraction of its story about her being dropped by the label.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.annielennox.com/news.php?newsItem=871 |title=Official press statement Jan 2008 |publisher=Annielennox.com |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=27 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707145210/http://www.annielennox.com/news.php?newsItem=871 |archivedate=7 July 2011  }}</ref>\n\n===2010\u20132013: Island Records and ''A Christmas Cornucopia''===\n{{main|A Christmas Cornucopia}}\nIn August 2010, Lennox signed a new contract with [[Island Records]] in the UK and [[Decca Records]] in the US (both part of the [[Universal Music Group]]).<ref>[http://www.universalmusic.com/corporate/international-superstar-annie-lennox-signs-with-universal-music-group-umg-for-worldwide-re International Superstar Annie Lennox signs with Universal Music Group (UMG)] Universal Music.

Lennox stated that while on a trip to South Africa in December 2007 to appear at the [[46664 (concerts)|46664]] campaign in Johannesburg, the regional company office of the label failed to return phone calls and e-mails she made to them for three weeks, and had completely failed to promote the Sing project as planned. Upon her return to the UK, Lennox met with the head of Sony BMG UK, Ged Docherty, who was \"mortified\" by the problems she had encountered with the South African branch. However, the debacle (partly inflamed when Lennox's dissatisfaction with the South African office was made public on her blog) led to press reports falsely stating that she was being dropped by Sony BMG. The record company themselves quickly refuted the rumour stating that Lennox's contract with them had merely been fulfilled and that they hoped she would consider remaining with them. The British tabloid, ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', subsequently printed a retraction of its story about her being dropped by the label.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.annielennox.com/news.php?newsItem=871 |title=Official press statement Jan 2008 |publisher=Annielennox.com |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=27 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707145210/http://www.annielennox.com/news.php?newsItem=871 |archivedate=7 July 2011  }}</ref>\n\n===2010\u20132013: Island Records and ''A Christmas Cornucopia''===\n{{main|A Christmas Cornucopia}}\nIn August 2010, Lennox signed a new contract with [[Island Records]] in the UK and [[Decca Records]] in the US (both part of the [[Universal Music Group]]).<ref>[http://www.universalmusic.com/corporate/international-superstar-annie-lennox-signs-with-universal-music-group-umg-for-worldwide-re International Superstar Annie Lennox signs with Universal Music Group (UMG)] Universal Music.

census|current}}\n\nLocated along the eastern border of [[Metro Manila]], Pasig is bordered on the west by [[Quezon City]] and [[Mandaluyong]]; to the north by [[Marikina]]; to the south by [[Makati]], the municipality of [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]], and [[Taguig]]; and to the east by the municipalities of [[Cainta]] and [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]] in the province of [[Rizal]].\n\nThe city shares its name with the [[Pasig River]] which runs through it and forms its southwestern and southeastern borders with Makati and Taguig respectively, while the [[Marikina River]] forms its western border with Quezon City. The artificial [[Manggahan Floodway]], built in 1986, begins at its confluence with the Marikina River in its northeast.\n\nA formerly [[rural settlement]], Pasig is primarily residential and industrial, but has been becoming increasingly [[commercial district|commercial]] in recent years, particularly after the construction of the [[Ortigas Center]] business district in its west. The city is home to the [[Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines|Roman Catholic]] [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pasig|Diocese of Pasig]], based in [[Pasig Cathedral]], a landmark built around the same time as the town's foundation in 1573.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nPasig was formerly part of Rizal province before the formation of [[Metro Manila]], the [[National Capital Region]] of the country.<ref name=antipolocapital>{{cite news|last1=Rosario|first1=Ben|title=Bill seeks to make Antipolo City the capital of Rizal|url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2017/09/23/bill-seeks-to-make-antipolo-city-the-capital-of-rizal/|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=[[Manila Bulletin]]|date=23 September 2017}}</ref> The seat of government of Rizal was hosted in Pasig at the old Rizal Provincial Capitol until a new capitol was opened in [[Antipolo]], within Rizal's jurisdiction in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE NEW RIZAL PROVINCIAL CAPITOL|url=http://rizalprovince.ph/monitor-Apr302009-2.html|publisher=Rizal Provincial Government|accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref> However it remains the ''de jure'', or official capital of the province.<ref name=antipolocapital/>\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Pasig City 1.jpg|thumb|left|Old center of Pasig at the Pasig City Museum and near the [[Pasig Cathedral|Immaculate Conception Cathedral]]]]\nThe city's name ''Pasig'' was believed to have come from the old [[Sanskrit]] word ''\"pasega\"'', meaning \"sand\" (similar to Malay [[wiktionary:pasir|pasir]]), which refers to the tribal community beside the sandy edges of the river.<ref>[http://www.philtravelcenter.com/philippines/travelinfo/pasig-information.html Pasig Travel Tips and General Information]</ref> Some historians believed that ''El Pasig'' came from \"Legazpi\" ([[Miguel Lopez de Legazpi]], the [[Basque people|Basque]] explorer well known for being involved in the \"[[Sanduguan]]\", and was the first Governor-General of the Spanish [[East Indies]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIt was pronounced ''\"mapaksik\"'' by the Pre-Hispanic Chinese inhabitants of [[Binondo]], [[Manila]] (\"Mabagsik\" is [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"terrifying\" \u2013 depicting the river's raging current during the [[typhoon season]], causing massive floods on nearby towns and villages, destroying wide hectares of farmland, and even bringing huge amounts of logs and water lilies from [[Marikina River]], [[Laguna de Bay]], and [[San Juan River (Metro Manila)|San Juan River]] towards Colonial Manila). ''\"Mapaksik\"'' later became ''\"Pah-sik\"'', and was then changed to what is now \"Pasig\". It may have also come from the Tagalog word ''\"dalampasigan\"'', which means \"[[wikt:riverbank|riverbank]]\".\n\nAccording to Jose Villa Panganiban, the former director of the Institute of National Language, \"Pasig\" is another ancient Sanskrit word meaning \"a waterway coming from one body of water to another,\" which briefly describes the river because its flow starts from Laguna de Bay, leading to [[Manila Bay]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Climate==\nThe [[dry season]] runs through the months of November to April, while the [[wet season]] starts in May and lasts to November. The wet season reaches its peak in the month of August. Maximum [[rainfall]] in Muntinlupa usually occurs from the month of June to September. The average annual of rainfall is 2,014.8 millimeters with a peak of 420.0 millimeters in July and a low 26.9 millimeters in April. The highest [[temperature]] occurs during the month of April and May (34 degrees Celsius) while the lowest occurs during the months of January & February (24 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe Philippines, due to its geographical location, is one of the Asian countries often affected by [[typhoons]]. It is located within the so-called \u201ctyphoon belt\u201d. Generally, typhoon season starts from June and ends in November. However, the rest of the months are not entirely free of the typhoons since they are unpredictable in nature and might enter the country anytime of the year.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThere are no surviving firsthand accounts of the history of Pasig before Spanish colonizers arrived in 1573 and established the settlement which they called the Ciudad-Municipal de Pasig.<ref name=\"Scott1984\">{{Cite book|title=Prehispanic Source Materials for the Study of Philippine History|last1=Scott|first1=William Henry|authorlink=William Henry Scott (historian)|publisher=New Day Publishers|date=1984|location=[[Quezon City]]|isbn=978-9711002268|chapter=Societies in Prehispanic Philippines}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pasig City (41).jpg|thumb|left|A section of the Bitukang Manok]]\nHowever, surviving genealogical records and folk histories speak of a thriving indigenous community ([[Barangay state|Barangay]]) on the banks of the Bitukang Manok river (now nearly extinct, and known as Parian Creek), which eventually became modern-day Pasig. The greatest rulers of this pre-colonial polity are named [[Rajah Lontok]] and [[Dayang Kalangitan]] by the legends, which also say that they are closely related to the pre-colonial rulers of [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]] and [[Rajahnate of Maynila|Maynila]].<ref name=\"Dery2001\">{{cite book|last=Dery|first=Luis Camara|authorlink=|title=A History of the Inarticulate|publisher=New Day Publishers|date=2001|location=[[Quezon City]]|isbn=971-10-1069-0}}</ref>\n\nThe creek was given the name \"Bitukang Manok\" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"Chicken [[Gut (anatomy)|Gut]]\"), due to the serpentine shape of its waterway. Among its early dwellers were [[Ethnic Malays]], the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] from [[Southern China]] (with their origins dating back from the [[Ming Dynasty]]), and the Indigenous [[Tinguian]] nomads who migrated from the deep jungles of the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] Mountain Range. The Bitukang Manok was once a principal tributary of the [[Marikina River]]. The Spanish colonizers called the creek \"Rio de Pasig\"; however, the natives still referred to it as the Bitukang Manok.\n\nThe first stretch of the Bitukang Manok became known as the \"Pariancillo\" (Estero de San Agustin), where its shoreline was once settled by Chinese and Malay merchants to trade their goods with the natives, until it developed up to the 1970s as the city's main public market. Likewise, the creek contributed enormously to the economic growth of Pasig during the Spanish Colonial Era, through irrigation of its wide [[paddy fields]], and by being the progressive center of barter trade.\n\nThe Bitukang Manok, also known as the \"Parian Creek\", had once linked the Marikina River with the \"[[Antipolo]] River\". Before the [[Manggahan Floodway]] was built in 1986, The Parian Creek was actually connected to the Sapang Bato-Buli Creek (which serves as the boundary between Pasig's barangays Dela Paz-Manggahan-Rosario-Santa Lucia and the Municipality of [[Cainta]]), the Kasibulan Creek (situated at Vista Verde, Barangay San Isidro, Cainta), the Palanas Creek (leaving Antipolo through Barangay Muntindilao), the Bulaw Creek (on Barangay Mambungan, besides the Valley Golf and Country Club), and the [[Hinulugang Taktak]] Falls of Barangay Dela Paz (fed by the Taktak Creek passing close to the Antipolo Town Square), thus being the detached and long-abandoned Antipolo River.\n\n===Colonial period===\n[[File:Pasig City (98).jpg|thumb|Bahay na Tisa (Tech House), the oldest existing [[bahay na bato]] in Pasig, was built in the 1850s.]]\n\nSince the early 1600s up to the period of [[Japanese Imperialism]], over a thousand Catholic devotees coming from \"Maynilad\" (Manila), \"Hacienda Pineda\" ([[Pasay]]), \"[[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] del Monte\", \"[[Hacienda]] de Mandaloyon\" ([[Mandaluyong]]), \"Hacienda Mariquina\" ([[Marikina]]), \"Barrio [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]]\", \"Pueblo de Tagig\" ([[Taguig]]), and \"San Pedro de Macati\" ([[Makati]]), followed the trail of the Parian Creek to the Pilgrimage Cathedral on the mountainous pueblo of Antipolo, [[Morong, Rizal|Morong]] (the present-day [[Rizal Province]]).\n\nThe Antipole\u00f1os and several locals from the far-reached barrios of \"Poblacion de San Mateo\", \"Montalban\" ([[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]]), \"Monte de Tanhai\" ([[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]]), \"Santa Rosa-Oroquieta\" ([[Teresa, Rizal|Teresa]]), and \"Punta Ibayo\" ([[Baras, Rizal|Baras]]), had also navigated this freshwater creek once to go down to the vast \"Kapatagan\" (Rice plains) of lowland Pasig. Even the [[marian devotions|marian]] processions of the [[Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage]] passed this route back and forth eleven times.\n\nThe creek has been also used during the [[British Occupation of Manila]] in 1762 to 1764 by the Royal [[British army]], under the leadership of General [[William Draper (British Army officer)|William Draper]] and Vice Admiral [[Sir Samuel Cornish, 1st Baronet]], to transport their red troops (and also the [[Sepoys]] they've brought from [[East India]]) upstream to take over the nearby forest-surrounded villages of Cainta and [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]]. They even did an ambush at the \"Plaza Central\" in front of the [[Pasig Cathedral]], and turned the [[Roman Catholic]] Parish into their military headquarters, with the church's fortress-like \"Campanilla\" ([[belfry (architecture)|belfry]]) serving as a watchtower against Spanish defenders sailing from the walled city of [[Intramuros]] via the [[Pasig River]].\n\nThe Sepoys backstabbed their abusive British lieutenants and sided with the combined forces of the Spanish [[Conquistadors]] (assigned by the [[Governor-General]] [[Simon de Anda y Salazar]]), local rice farmers, fisherfolk, and even Chinese traders. After the British Invasion, the Sepoys remained and intermarried with [[Filipina]] women, and that explains the [[Hindu]] features of some of today's citizens of Pasig, especially Cainta and Taytay.\n\nIn 1742, an [[Augustinian]] friar named Fray Domingo Diaz, together with a group of wealthy \"Mestizos de [[Sangley]]\" (Chinese Mestizos) from Sagad, ordered a construction of a marble, roof-tiled cover bridge across the creek in the style of an oriental pagoda. It was named \"Puente del Pariancillo\", and a few years later, it changed to \"Puente de Fray Felix Trillo\", dedicated to the dynamic parochial curate of the [[Immaculate Conception Parish (Philippines)|Immaculate Conception Parish]]. [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|Edmund Roberts]] visited Pasig in 1832.<ref name=Roberts1>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Edmund|authorlink=Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|title=Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat|year=1837|publisher=[[Harper (publisher)#Harper & Brothers (1833\u20131962)|Harper & Brothers]]|location=New York|page=60|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/60/}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pasig City (89) Old Capitol.jpg|thumb|Remains of the American-era capitol building, when Pasig was the capital of Rizal province]]\n\nOn the night of May 2, 1896, more than 300 revolutionary [[Katipunan|Katipuneros]], led by the Supremo Gat. [[Andres Bonifacio]], [[Emilio Jacinto]] and [[Pio Valenzuela]], secretly gained access in this very creek aboard a fleet of seventeen \"Bangkas\" (canoes) to the old residence of a notable Valentin Cruz at Barangay San Nicolas, and formed the \"Asamblea Magna\" (mass meeting).\n\nThree months later on Saturday evening, 29 August, about less than 2,000 working-class Pasigue\u00f1os (along with a hundred Chinese \"[[Trabajadores]]\" (laborers) from the failed Sangley revolts of 1639 and throughout the 17th century), armed with coconuts, machetes and bayoneted muskets (some were donated by the rich [[Ilustrado]] families, while many of those guns were looted from Spanish authorities), joined the [[Katipunan]] and made a surprise attack at the \"Municipio del [[Gobernadorcillo]]\" (the current site of the Pasig City Hall) and its adjacent garrison of the \"Guardias Civil\" ([[Civil Guard (Philippines)|Civil Guard]]), situated near the border of barangays Maybunga and Caniogan.\n\n[[File:Pasig City (69).jpg|thumb|Guanio residence, the site of the \"Nagsabado sa Pasig\"]]\n\nThat was the first and victorious rebellion ever accomplished by the Katipunan, and that particular event was popularly known as the \"Nagsabado sa Pasig\" (the Saturday Uprising on Pasig). After they had managed to successfully out-thrown the seat of Spanish [[government]] on Pasig, the Katipuneros fled immediately and advanced towards a \"[[Sitio]]\" located at the neighboring \"Ciudad de San Juan\" called \"Pinaglabanan\", and there they launched their second attempt to end the numerous cases of corruption made by the greedy Castilian \"[[Encomenderos]]\" (town officials) and \"Hacienderos\" (landlords), which shall be commemorated as the [[Battle of San Juan del Monte]].\n\nOn June 11, 1901, during the [[Philippine-American War]], the province of [[Rizal]] was created through Act No. 137 of the Philippine Commission. Pasig was incorporated into the province of Rizal, and was designated as the capital of the new province. In 1975, Pasig was carved out of Rizal province and became part of [[Metro Manila]] when the Metro Manila Commission (precursor of Metro Manila Authority and later [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]]) was created by Pres. [[Ferdinand Marcos]] through Presidential Decree 824.\n\n===After World War II===\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the Bitukang Manok was slowly exposing its ecological downfall. It resulted in water pollution due to rational ignorance. The worst came to the Bitukang Manok in the late 1960s when the disappearing waterway, instead of being revived was totally separated from the Marikina River, and was converted into an open sewage ditch, with its original flow now moving in reverse towards the direction of the Napindan Channel (a portion of the Pasig River bordering between the barangays Kalawaan-Pinagbuhatan and Taguig), to give way to public commercial facilities.\n\nIn July 1994, Pasig was converted into a highly urbanized city through Republic Act 7829. And in December 1994, President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] signed it into law, which was ratified through a plebiscite on January 21, 1995.\n\nOn February 4, 2006, the [[PhilSports Stadium stampede|ULTRA Stampede]], in which 71 people died, happened during the first anniversary celebration of [[ABS-CBN]]'s noontime show ''[[Wowowee]]'', because of the prizes that were to be given away. The anniversary of the show would be held on [[PhilSports Arena]] but the event has been already canceled due to the tragedy.\n\nPasig was one of the areas struck by the high flood created by [[Typhoon Ketsana|Typhoon Ondoy]] on September 26, 2009, which affected the Ortigas Avenue and the east city side of the Manggahan Floodway. It is the most destructive flood in Philippine history. Pasig is accessed by the [[Pasig River]], wherein the waters of [[Marikina River]] channeled and the Manggahan Floodway routed to [[Laguna de Bay]].\n\nIn the first week of August 2012, intense monsoon rain caused the [[2012 Philippines flooding]], which affected again Pasig and particularly the [[National Capital Region]] (NCR), [[CALABARZON]] and the southwest part of [[Luzon]]. The nonstop eight-day monsoon rain, strengthened by [[Typhoon Saola (2012)|Typhoon Gener]], caused the Marikina River to overflow and destroyed the same places that were ruined by Typhoon Ondoy in 2009.\n\nIn 2020, the city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= right\n| title= Population census of Pasig\n| 1903 = 11278\n| 1918 = 16767\n| 1939 = 27541\n| 1948 = 35407\n| 1960 = 62130\n| 1970 = 156492\n| 1975 = 209915\n| 1980 = 268570\n| 1990 = 397679\n| 1995 = 471075\n| 2000 = 505058 \n| 2007 = 617301\n| 2010 = 669773\n| 2015 = 755300\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\nPopulation growth of Pasig has consistently been higher than the regional average.

The eastern part was mostly dominated with residential areas but numerous commercial establishments are now being developed along [[Marikina\u2013Infanta Highway|Marcos Highway]].

Numerous high-rise office buildings, residential condominiums, commercial establishments, schools and malls are situated here. The [[University of Asia and the Pacific]] is also located here. The head office of the [[Integrated Bar of the Philippines]] was established in the district. The former headquarters of the [[Philippine Stock Exchange]] is located along [[ADB Avenue]]. [[San Miguel Corporation]], owner of one of the largest producer of beer in Asia, also has its headquarters in the district along [[San Miguel Avenue]]. Situated along Ortigas Avenue is [[Crowne Plaza]], a five-star hotel near [[Robinsons Galleria]].\n\nNotable developments along E. Rodriguez Jr. Avenue ([[Circumferential Road 5|C-5]]) include [[Arcovia City]], The Grove by Rockwell, and Ortigas East (formerly Frontera Verde), home of the [[Tiendesitas]] market. El-Pueblo, a colonial-themed commercial complex in Ortigas Center, provides new concept of cafes, restaurants and bars. [[Metrowalk]] (formerly Payanig), a commercial hub along Ortigas Avenue and [[Meralco Avenue]], was established in 2005 and comprises shops, depot warehouses, stalls, restaurants and bars.

There is also a similar \"Daangbakal\" in the [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]]-Montalban ([[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]]) area, and on the maps one can notice that the two roads should have been connected with each other. In fact, as the name suggests in Tagalog, these streets were once a single railway line. The two sides of the \"Daangbakal\" roads were once connected by a bridge in the San Mateo-Marikina border. However, as the railroad tracks have been largely ignored after the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese cccupation]] and was transformed into separate highways, the railway connection was abandoned.\n\nThe old railroad tracks, called the Marikina Line, was connected from [[Tutuban station]] in [[Manila]], passing through Tramo (Barangay Rosario, Pasig) coming all the way to the town of [[Marikina]] up to [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Montalban]]. On the northern end of the \"Daangbakal\" road in Montablan is a basketball court. That basketball court which stands today, surrounded by the Montalban Catholic Church and Cemetery, was once the railway station terminus of that particular line.\n\nThe present-day Santo Ni\u00f1o Elementary School in Marikina was said to be a train depot. And also it was said that a railroad station once stood in the Marikina City Sports Park.\n\nThe Marikina Line was completed in 1906, and continued its operation until 1936. It was said that the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] made use of this railway line during the Second World War. These railways were dismantled during the 1960s and were converted into ordinary roads.\n\nToday, the citizens are dependent on [[Tricycles]], [[Jeepneys]], Taxis, FX, Buses, and AUV's which contribute to the everyday unusual and unbearable traffic of Metropolitan Manila. Even now, there is uncertainty in the Northrail project, which links Manila to the northern provinces of [[Luzon]], because of corruption within the project's construction.\n\nAside from the Marikina Line, two other railways have existed before but are now removed permanently.\n\nFirst is the [[Cavite]] Line, which passed through [[Paco, Manila|Paco]], [[Para\u00f1aque]], [[Bacoor]] and up to [[Naic]], Cavite. Completed in 1908, its operation continued until 1936.\n\nSecond is the [[Antipolo]] Line, which passed through [[Santa Mesa]], [[Mandaluyong]], Pasig, [[Cainta]], [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]], up to Antipolo near the \"[[Hinulugang Taktak]]\" Falls. There is also a street named \"Daangbakal\" in Antipolo, where like the \"Daangbakal\" roads on Marikina and San Mateo, a railway line once existed. The railroad tracks also passed through what is now the [[Ortigas Avenue]] Extension. Its operation ceased in 1917.\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|List of schools in Pasig}}\n{{summarize section|date=March 2017}}\n\nAlong C. Raymundo Avenue lies the national headquarters of [[Parents for Education Foundation]], Inc. which runs schools such as [[PAREF Southridge School]], [[PAREF Woodrose School]], [[PAREF Northfield School]], [[PAREF Rosehill School]], and seven other schools.\n\nAt the heart of city proper, lies Colegio del Buen Consejo (CBC). It is one of the oldest school in Pasig and one of the educational institutions promulgated by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pasig]].\n\n===Secondary Schools===\n[[File:Ph-mm-pasig-caniogan-dr. sixto antonio ave.-rizal hs-v.p. eusebio bldg.

It is established under the mayoralty of Vicente C. Eusebio in 1999.\n\n[[St. Paul College Pasig]] was near the Philippine Institute of Sports Complex (ULTRA). It was established in 1970 as one of the educational institutions administered by the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres.\n\n[[University of Asia and the Pacific]] (UA&P) in Ortigas Center traces back to the Center for Research and Communication (CRC) which started by two Harvard graduates in 1967 as an economic and social think-tank institution. Its spiritual and doctrinal formation is entrusted to [[Opus Dei]].\n\n===Technical and vocational training===\n[[MFI Foundation Inc.]] (formerly [[Meralco]] Foundation Institute) was located near the [[Ortigas Center]] along Ortigas Avenue. It is established in 1983 to serve and meet the industry's demand for middle-level technical manpower. As a partner of Philippine government's institution of the [[Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (Philippines)]] or TESDA, it provided two main programs in the Industrial Technician Program (ITP) which targets the youth and the Technical Training and MFI Training (formerly Testing Program) for skilled workers and professionals.\n\n===International Schools===\n[[Domuschola International School|Domuschola International School (DIS)]] is located in Barangay Ugong and offers the [[International Baccalaureate]] PYP program for elementary students. Established in 2000 as a pre-school under the name Second Mom, it has expanded to primary and secondary education. The school is in partnership with the TAO Corporation and as of 2015, became a candidate school of the IB Diploma Program.\n\n[[Saint Gabriel International School]] in Sandoval Avenue is the sister school of the Chinese-based [[Manila Xiamen International School]]. It provides Mandarin Chinese classes and [[ESL]] education for local and foreign students.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=27em|\n*[[Atoy Co]], actor, basketball player and former 1st

The artificial [[Manggahan Floodway]], built in 1986, begins at its confluence with the Marikina River in its northeast.\n\nA formerly [[rural settlement]], Pasig is primarily residential and industrial, but has been becoming increasingly [[commercial district|commercial]] in recent years, particularly after the construction of the [[Ortigas Center]] business district in its west. The city is home to the [[Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines|Roman Catholic]] [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pasig|Diocese of Pasig]], based in [[Pasig Cathedral]], a landmark built around the same time as the town's foundation in 1573.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nPasig was formerly part of Rizal province before the formation of [[Metro Manila]], the [[National Capital Region]] of the country.<ref name=antipolocapital>{{cite news|last1=Rosario|first1=Ben|title=Bill seeks to make Antipolo City the capital of Rizal|url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2017/09/23/bill-seeks-to-make-antipolo-city-the-capital-of-rizal/|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=[[Manila Bulletin]]|date=23 September 2017}}</ref> The seat of government of Rizal was hosted in Pasig at the old Rizal Provincial Capitol until a new capitol was opened in [[Antipolo]], within Rizal's jurisdiction in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE NEW RIZAL PROVINCIAL CAPITOL|url=http://rizalprovince.ph/monitor-Apr302009-2.html|publisher=Rizal Provincial Government|accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref> However it remains the ''de jure'', or official capital of the province.<ref name=antipolocapital/>\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Pasig City 1.jpg|thumb|left|Old center of Pasig at the Pasig City Museum and near the [[Pasig Cathedral|Immaculate Conception Cathedral]]]]\nThe city's name ''Pasig'' was believed to have come from the old [[Sanskrit]] word ''\"pasega\"'', meaning \"sand\" (similar to Malay [[wiktionary:pasir|pasir]]), which refers to the tribal community beside the sandy edges of the river.<ref>[http://www.philtravelcenter.com/philippines/travelinfo/pasig-information.html Pasig Travel Tips and General Information]</ref> Some historians believed that ''El Pasig'' came from \"Legazpi\" ([[Miguel Lopez de Legazpi]], the [[Basque people|Basque]] explorer well known for being involved in the \"[[Sanduguan]]\", and was the first Governor-General of the Spanish [[East Indies]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIt was pronounced ''\"mapaksik\"'' by the Pre-Hispanic Chinese inhabitants of [[Binondo]], [[Manila]] (\"Mabagsik\" is [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"terrifying\" \u2013 depicting the river's raging current during the [[typhoon season]], causing massive floods on nearby towns and villages, destroying wide hectares of farmland, and even bringing huge amounts of logs and water lilies from [[Marikina River]], [[Laguna de Bay]], and [[San Juan River (Metro Manila)|San Juan River]] towards Colonial Manila). ''\"Mapaksik\"'' later became ''\"Pah-sik\"'', and was then changed to what is now \"Pasig\". It may have also come from the Tagalog word ''\"dalampasigan\"'', which means \"[[wikt:riverbank|riverbank]]\".\n\nAccording to Jose Villa Panganiban, the former director of the Institute of National Language, \"Pasig\" is another ancient Sanskrit word meaning \"a waterway coming from one body of water to another,\" which briefly describes the river because its flow starts from Laguna de Bay, leading to [[Manila Bay]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Climate==\nThe [[dry season]] runs through the months of November to April, while the [[wet season]] starts in May and lasts to November. The wet season reaches its peak in the month of August. Maximum [[rainfall]] in Muntinlupa usually occurs from the month of June to September. The average annual of rainfall is 2,014.8 millimeters with a peak of 420.0 millimeters in July and a low 26.9 millimeters in April. The highest [[temperature]] occurs during the month of April and May (34 degrees Celsius) while the lowest occurs during the months of January & February (24 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe Philippines, due to its geographical location, is one of the Asian countries often affected by [[typhoons]]. It is located within the so-called \u201ctyphoon belt\u201d. Generally, typhoon season starts from June and ends in November. However, the rest of the months are not entirely free of the typhoons since they are unpredictable in nature and might enter the country anytime of the year.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThere are no surviving firsthand accounts of the history of Pasig before Spanish colonizers arrived in 1573 and established the settlement which they called the Ciudad-Municipal de Pasig.<ref name=\"Scott1984\">{{Cite book|title=Prehispanic Source Materials for the Study of Philippine History|last1=Scott|first1=William Henry|authorlink=William Henry Scott (historian)|publisher=New Day Publishers|date=1984|location=[[Quezon City]]|isbn=978-9711002268|chapter=Societies in Prehispanic Philippines}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pasig City (41).jpg|thumb|left|A section of the Bitukang Manok]]\nHowever, surviving genealogical records and folk histories speak of a thriving indigenous community ([[Barangay state|Barangay]]) on the banks of the Bitukang Manok river (now nearly extinct, and known as Parian Creek), which eventually became modern-day Pasig. The greatest rulers of this pre-colonial polity are named [[Rajah Lontok]] and [[Dayang Kalangitan]] by the legends, which also say that they are closely related to the pre-colonial rulers of [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]] and [[Rajahnate of Maynila|Maynila]].<ref name=\"Dery2001\">{{cite book|last=Dery|first=Luis Camara|authorlink=|title=A History of the Inarticulate|publisher=New Day Publishers|date=2001|location=[[Quezon City]]|isbn=971-10-1069-0}}</ref>\n\nThe creek was given the name \"Bitukang Manok\" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"Chicken [[Gut (anatomy)|Gut]]\"), due to the serpentine shape of its waterway. Among its early dwellers were [[Ethnic Malays]], the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] from [[Southern China]] (with their origins dating back from the [[Ming Dynasty]]), and the Indigenous [[Tinguian]] nomads who migrated from the deep jungles of the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] Mountain Range. The Bitukang Manok was once a principal tributary of the [[Marikina River]]. The Spanish colonizers called the creek \"Rio de Pasig\"; however, the natives still referred to it as the Bitukang Manok.\n\nThe first stretch of the Bitukang Manok became known as the \"Pariancillo\" (Estero de San Agustin), where its shoreline was once settled by Chinese and Malay merchants to trade their goods with the natives, until it developed up to the 1970s as the city's main public market. Likewise, the creek contributed enormously to the economic growth of Pasig during the Spanish Colonial Era, through irrigation of its wide [[paddy fields]], and by being the progressive center of barter trade.\n\nThe Bitukang Manok, also known as the \"Parian Creek\", had once linked the Marikina River with the \"[[Antipolo]] River\". Before the [[Manggahan Floodway]] was built in 1986, The Parian Creek was actually connected to the Sapang Bato-Buli Creek (which serves as the boundary between Pasig's barangays Dela Paz-Manggahan-Rosario-Santa Lucia and the Municipality of [[Cainta]]), the Kasibulan Creek (situated at Vista Verde, Barangay San Isidro, Cainta), the Palanas Creek (leaving Antipolo through Barangay Muntindilao), the Bulaw Creek (on Barangay Mambungan, besides the Valley Golf and Country Club), and the [[Hinulugang Taktak]] Falls of Barangay Dela Paz (fed by the Taktak Creek passing close to the Antipolo Town Square), thus being the detached and long-abandoned Antipolo River.\n\n===Colonial period===\n[[File:Pasig City (98).jpg|thumb|Bahay na Tisa (Tech House), the oldest existing [[bahay na bato]] in Pasig, was built in the 1850s.]]\n\nSince the early 1600s up to the period of [[Japanese Imperialism]], over a thousand Catholic devotees coming from \"Maynilad\" (Manila), \"Hacienda Pineda\" ([[Pasay]]), \"[[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] del Monte\", \"[[Hacienda]] de Mandaloyon\" ([[Mandaluyong]]), \"Hacienda Mariquina\" ([[Marikina]]), \"Barrio [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]]\", \"Pueblo de Tagig\" ([[Taguig]]), and \"San Pedro de Macati\" ([[Makati]]), followed the trail of the Parian Creek to the Pilgrimage Cathedral on the mountainous pueblo of Antipolo, [[Morong, Rizal|Morong]] (the present-day [[Rizal Province]]).\n\nThe Antipole\u00f1os and several locals from the far-reached barrios of \"Poblacion de San Mateo\", \"Montalban\" ([[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]]), \"Monte de Tanhai\" ([[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]]), \"Santa Rosa-Oroquieta\" ([[Teresa, Rizal|Teresa]]), and \"Punta Ibayo\" ([[Baras, Rizal|Baras]]), had also navigated this freshwater creek once to go down to the vast \"Kapatagan\" (Rice plains) of lowland Pasig. Even the [[marian devotions|marian]] processions of the [[Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage]] passed this route back and forth eleven times.\n\nThe creek has been also used during the [[British Occupation of Manila]] in 1762 to 1764 by the Royal [[British army]], under the leadership of General [[William Draper (British Army officer)|William Draper]] and Vice Admiral [[Sir Samuel Cornish, 1st Baronet]], to transport their red troops (and also the [[Sepoys]] they've brought from [[East India]]) upstream to take over the nearby forest-surrounded villages of Cainta and [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]]. They even did an ambush at the \"Plaza Central\" in front of the [[Pasig Cathedral]], and turned the [[Roman Catholic]] Parish into their military headquarters, with the church's fortress-like \"Campanilla\" ([[belfry (architecture)|belfry]]) serving as a watchtower against Spanish defenders sailing from the walled city of [[Intramuros]] via the [[Pasig River]].\n\nThe Sepoys backstabbed their abusive British lieutenants and sided with the combined forces of the Spanish [[Conquistadors]] (assigned by the [[Governor-General]] [[Simon de Anda y Salazar]]), local rice farmers, fisherfolk, and even Chinese traders. After the British Invasion, the Sepoys remained and intermarried with [[Filipina]] women, and that explains the [[Hindu]] features of some of today's citizens of Pasig, especially Cainta and Taytay.\n\nIn 1742, an [[Augustinian]] friar named Fray Domingo Diaz, together with a group of wealthy \"Mestizos de [[Sangley]]\" (Chinese Mestizos) from Sagad, ordered a construction of a marble, roof-tiled cover bridge across the creek in the style of an oriental pagoda. It was named \"Puente del Pariancillo\", and a few years later, it changed to \"Puente de Fray Felix Trillo\", dedicated to the dynamic parochial curate of the [[Immaculate Conception Parish (Philippines)|Immaculate Conception Parish]]. [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|Edmund Roberts]] visited Pasig in 1832.<ref name=Roberts1>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Edmund|authorlink=Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|title=Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat|year=1837|publisher=[[Harper (publisher)#Harper & Brothers (1833\u20131962)|Harper & Brothers]]|location=New York|page=60|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/60/}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pasig City (89) Old Capitol.jpg|thumb|Remains of the American-era capitol building, when Pasig was the capital of Rizal province]]\n\nOn the night of May 2, 1896, more than 300 revolutionary [[Katipunan|Katipuneros]], led by the Supremo Gat. [[Andres Bonifacio]], [[Emilio Jacinto]] and [[Pio Valenzuela]], secretly gained access in this very creek aboard a fleet of seventeen \"Bangkas\" (canoes) to the old residence of a notable Valentin Cruz at Barangay San Nicolas, and formed the \"Asamblea Magna\" (mass meeting).\n\nThree months later on Saturday evening, 29 August, about less than 2,000 working-class Pasigue\u00f1os (along with a hundred Chinese \"[[Trabajadores]]\" (laborers) from the failed Sangley revolts of 1639 and throughout the 17th century), armed with coconuts, machetes and bayoneted muskets (some were donated by the rich [[Ilustrado]] families, while many of those guns were looted from Spanish authorities), joined the [[Katipunan]] and made a surprise attack at the \"Municipio del [[Gobernadorcillo]]\" (the current site of the Pasig City Hall) and its adjacent garrison of the \"Guardias Civil\" ([[Civil Guard (Philippines)|Civil Guard]]), situated near the border of barangays Maybunga and Caniogan.\n\n[[File:Pasig City (69).jpg|thumb|Guanio residence, the site of the \"Nagsabado sa Pasig\"]]\n\nThat was the first and victorious rebellion ever accomplished by the Katipunan, and that particular event was popularly known as the \"Nagsabado sa Pasig\" (the Saturday Uprising on Pasig). After they had managed to successfully out-thrown the seat of Spanish [[government]] on Pasig, the Katipuneros fled immediately and advanced towards a \"[[Sitio]]\" located at the neighboring \"Ciudad de San Juan\" called \"Pinaglabanan\", and there they launched their second attempt to end the numerous cases of corruption made by the greedy Castilian \"[[Encomenderos]]\" (town officials) and \"Hacienderos\" (landlords), which shall be commemorated as the [[Battle of San Juan del Monte]].\n\nOn June 11, 1901, during the [[Philippine-American War]], the province of [[Rizal]] was created through Act No. 137 of the Philippine Commission. Pasig was incorporated into the province of Rizal, and was designated as the capital of the new province. In 1975, Pasig was carved out of Rizal province and became part of [[Metro Manila]] when the Metro Manila Commission (precursor of Metro Manila Authority and later [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]]) was created by Pres. [[Ferdinand Marcos]] through Presidential Decree 824.\n\n===After World War II===\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the Bitukang Manok was slowly exposing its ecological downfall. It resulted in water pollution due to rational ignorance. The worst came to the Bitukang Manok in the late 1960s when the disappearing waterway, instead of being revived was totally separated from the Marikina River, and was converted into an open sewage ditch, with its original flow now moving in reverse towards the direction of the Napindan Channel (a portion of the Pasig River bordering between the barangays Kalawaan-Pinagbuhatan and Taguig), to give way to public commercial facilities.\n\nIn July 1994, Pasig was converted into a highly urbanized city through Republic Act 7829. And in December 1994, President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] signed it into law, which was ratified through a plebiscite on January 21, 1995.\n\nOn February 4, 2006, the [[PhilSports Stadium stampede|ULTRA Stampede]], in which 71 people died, happened during the first anniversary celebration of [[ABS-CBN]]'s noontime show ''[[Wowowee]]'', because of the prizes that were to be given away. The anniversary of the show would be held on [[PhilSports Arena]] but the event has been already canceled due to the tragedy.\n\nPasig was one of the areas struck by the high flood created by [[Typhoon Ketsana|Typhoon Ondoy]] on September 26, 2009, which affected the Ortigas Avenue and the east city side of the Manggahan Floodway. It is the most destructive flood in Philippine history. Pasig is accessed by the [[Pasig River]], wherein the waters of [[Marikina River]] channeled and the Manggahan Floodway routed to [[Laguna de Bay]].\n\nIn the first week of August 2012, intense monsoon rain caused the [[2012 Philippines flooding]], which affected again Pasig and particularly the [[National Capital Region]] (NCR), [[CALABARZON]] and the southwest part of [[Luzon]]. The nonstop eight-day monsoon rain, strengthened by [[Typhoon Saola (2012)|Typhoon Gener]], caused the Marikina River to overflow and destroyed the same places that were ruined by Typhoon Ondoy in 2009.\n\nIn 2020, the city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= right\n| title= Population census of Pasig\n| 1903 = 11278\n| 1918 = 16767\n| 1939 = 27541\n| 1948 = 35407\n| 1960 = 62130\n| 1970 = 156492\n| 1975 = 209915\n| 1980 = 268570\n| 1990 = 397679\n| 1995 = 471075\n| 2000 = 505058 \n| 2007 = 617301\n| 2010 = 669773\n| 2015 = 755300\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\nPopulation growth of Pasig has consistently been higher than the regional average.

The eastern part was mostly dominated with residential areas but numerous commercial establishments are now being developed along [[Marikina\u2013Infanta Highway|Marcos Highway]]. Per capita income ([[Gross domestic product|GDP]]) of Pasig is $12,032 per year. {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} The [[barangay]] of San Antonio has the largest income in Pasig, second only to San Lorenzo of [[Makati]] as the largest single income-generating local government unit in the Philippines.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} In the arguably more significant western part of Pasig, east of the city of [[Mandaluyong]] and part of the barangay of San Antonio, lies the [[Ortigas Center]].\n\n[[Ortigas Center]] is one of the top business districts in the country. Numerous high-rise office buildings, residential condominiums, commercial establishments, schools and malls are situated here. The [[University of Asia and the Pacific]] is also located here. The head office of the [[Integrated Bar of the Philippines]] was established in the district. The former headquarters of the [[Philippine Stock Exchange]] is located along [[ADB Avenue]]. [[San Miguel Corporation]], owner of one of the largest producer of beer in Asia, also has its headquarters in the district along [[San Miguel Avenue]]. Situated along Ortigas Avenue is [[Crowne Plaza]], a five-star hotel near [[Robinsons Galleria]].\n\nNotable developments along E. Rodriguez Jr. Avenue ([[Circumferential Road 5|C-5]]) include [[Arcovia City]], The Grove by Rockwell, and Ortigas East (formerly Frontera Verde), home of the [[Tiendesitas]] market. El-Pueblo, a colonial-themed commercial complex in Ortigas Center, provides new concept of cafes, restaurants and bars. [[Metrowalk]] (formerly Payanig), a commercial hub along Ortigas Avenue and [[Meralco Avenue]], was established in 2005 and comprises shops, depot warehouses, stalls, restaurants and bars.

Located in Meralco Avenue, it is where the offices of the [[Philippine Sports Commission]], [[Philippine Olympic Committee]] and some national sports associations are.\n\nPasig will host some matches at the [[2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup]] at the [[PhilSports Arena]].\n\n==Transportation==\n===Road network===\n[[File:Pasig City 2.jpg|thumb|Dr. Sixto Antonio Avenue is a major north\u2013south road in Pasig.]]\n\nPasig is accessed by the following major roads:\n*[[Ortigas Avenue]]\n*E.

There is also a similar \"Daangbakal\" in the [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]]-Montalban ([[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]]) area, and on the maps one can notice that the two roads should have been connected with each other. In fact, as the name suggests in Tagalog, these streets were once a single railway line. The two sides of the \"Daangbakal\" roads were once connected by a bridge in the San Mateo-Marikina border. However, as the railroad tracks have been largely ignored after the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese cccupation]] and was transformed into separate highways, the railway connection was abandoned.\n\nThe old railroad tracks, called the Marikina Line, was connected from [[Tutuban station]] in [[Manila]], passing through Tramo (Barangay Rosario, Pasig) coming all the way to the town of [[Marikina]] up to [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Montalban]]. On the northern end of the \"Daangbakal\" road in Montablan is a basketball court. That basketball court which stands today, surrounded by the Montalban Catholic Church and Cemetery, was once the railway station terminus of that particular line.\n\nThe present-day Santo Ni\u00f1o Elementary School in Marikina was said to be a train depot. And also it was said that a railroad station once stood in the Marikina City Sports Park.\n\nThe Marikina Line was completed in 1906, and continued its operation until 1936. It was said that the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] made use of this railway line during the Second World War. These railways were dismantled during the 1960s and were converted into ordinary roads.\n\nToday, the citizens are dependent on [[Tricycles]], [[Jeepneys]], Taxis, FX, Buses, and AUV's which contribute to the everyday unusual and unbearable traffic of Metropolitan Manila. Even now, there is uncertainty in the Northrail project, which links Manila to the northern provinces of [[Luzon]], because of corruption within the project's construction.\n\nAside from the Marikina Line, two other railways have existed before but are now removed permanently.\n\nFirst is the [[Cavite]] Line, which passed through [[Paco, Manila|Paco]], [[Para\u00f1aque]], [[Bacoor]] and up to [[Naic]], Cavite. Completed in 1908, its operation continued until 1936.\n\nSecond is the [[Antipolo]] Line, which passed through [[Santa Mesa]], [[Mandaluyong]], Pasig, [[Cainta]], [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]], up to Antipolo near the \"[[Hinulugang Taktak]]\" Falls. There is also a street named \"Daangbakal\" in Antipolo, where like the \"Daangbakal\" roads on Marikina and San Mateo, a railway line once existed. The railroad tracks also passed through what is now the [[Ortigas Avenue]] Extension. Its operation ceased in 1917.\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|List of schools in Pasig}}\n{{summarize section|date=March 2017}}\n\nAlong C. Raymundo Avenue lies the national headquarters of [[Parents for Education Foundation]], Inc. which runs schools such as [[PAREF Southridge School]], [[PAREF Woodrose School]], [[PAREF Northfield School]], [[PAREF Rosehill School]], and seven other schools.\n\nAt the heart of city proper, lies Colegio del Buen Consejo (CBC). It is one of the oldest school in Pasig and one of the educational institutions promulgated by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pasig]].\n\n===Secondary Schools===\n[[File:Ph-mm-pasig-caniogan-dr. sixto antonio ave.-rizal hs-v.p. eusebio bldg. (main bldg) - back view (2015) 01.JPG|thumb|Rizal High School]]\n\n[[Pasig Catholic College]] (PCC) is a private sectarian college located at the heart of Pasig. Established in 1913 as a small school managed by the CICM Fathers headed by Fr. Pierre Cornelis De Brouwer at the present [[Pasig Cathedral|Immaculate Conception Cathedral]] of Pasig, it is considered as the city's center of Catholic educational institution of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pasig]].\n\n[[Pasig City Science High School]] (PCSHS) is the second science high school in Pasig recognized by the [[Department of Education]] for bright students of the city. It is located near Rainforest, a fully restored public resort and amusement park.\n\n[[Rizal High School]] (RHS) is located in Pasig. Named after the Philippine national hero [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]], it is one of the world's largest secondary education by student population. Formerly hailed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the largest school by overall enrolled students, it is now surpassed by the [[City Mississippi School]] (CMS) in [[Lucknow]], India.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/metro/2003/06/17/210456/metro-police-chief-inspects-world146s-biggest-high-school |title=Metro police chief inspects world's biggest high school |publisher=Philstar.com |date= |accessdate=2019-09-24}}</ref>\n===Tertiary Schools===\n[[Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Pasig]], a local university in Kapasigan, offers degree courses for poor, bright and deserving residents of Pasig. It is established under the mayoralty of Vicente C. Eusebio in 1999.\n\n[[St. Paul College Pasig]] was near the Philippine Institute of Sports Complex (ULTRA). It was established in 1970 as one of the educational institutions administered by the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres.\n\n[[University of Asia and the Pacific]] (UA&P) in Ortigas Center traces back to the Center for Research and Communication (CRC) which started by two Harvard graduates in 1967 as an economic and social think-tank institution. Its spiritual and doctrinal formation is entrusted to [[Opus Dei]].\n\n===Technical and vocational training===\n[[MFI Foundation Inc.]] (formerly [[Meralco]] Foundation Institute) was located near the [[Ortigas Center]] along Ortigas Avenue. It is established in 1983 to serve and meet the industry's demand for middle-level technical manpower. As a partner of Philippine government's institution of the [[Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (Philippines)]] or TESDA, it provided two main programs in the Industrial Technician Program (ITP) which targets the youth and the Technical Training and MFI Training (formerly Testing Program) for skilled workers and professionals.\n\n===International Schools===\n[[Domuschola International School|Domuschola International School (DIS)]] is located in Barangay Ugong and offers the [[International Baccalaureate]] PYP program for elementary students. Established in 2000 as a pre-school under the name Second Mom, it has expanded to primary and secondary education. The school is in partnership with the TAO Corporation and as of 2015, became a candidate school of the IB Diploma Program.\n\n[[Saint Gabriel International School]] in Sandoval Avenue is the sister school of the Chinese-based [[Manila Xiamen International School]].
