They are closely related to the [[Oligochaeta|oligochaetes]], which include the [[earthworm]]s, and like them have soft, muscular, segmented bodies that can lengthen and contract. Both groups are [[hermaphrodite]]s and have a [[clitellum]], but leeches typically differ from the oligochaetes in having suckers at both ends and in having external annulations that do not correspond with their internal segmentation. The body is muscular and relatively solid, and the [[coelom]], the spacious body cavity found in other annelids, is reduced to small channels.\n\nThe majority of leeches live in freshwater habitats, while some species can be found in terrestrial and marine environments. The best-known species, such as the medicinal leech, ''[[Hirudo medicinalis]]'', are [[hematophagous]], attaching themselves to a host with a sucker and feeding on blood, having first secreted the peptide [[hirudin]] to prevent the blood from clotting. The jaws used by these to pierce the skin are replaced in other species by a proboscis, which is pushed into the skin. A minority of leech species are predatory, mostly preying on small invertebrates.\n\nThe eggs are enclosed in a cocoon which in aquatic species is usually attached to an underwater surface; members of one family, [[Glossiphoniidae]], exhibit  parental care, the eggs being brooded by the parent. In terrestrial species, the cocoon is often concealed under a log or in a crevice. Almost seven hundred species of leech are currently recognised, of which some hundred are marine, ninety terrestrial and the remainder freshwater.\n\nLeeches have been used in [[medicine]] from ancient times until the 19th century to [[bloodletting|draw blood]] from patients. In modern times, leeches find medical use in treatment of joint diseases such as [[epicondylitis]] and osteoarthritis, extremity vein diseases, and in [[microsurgery]], while hirudin is used as an [[anticoagulant]] drug to treat blood-clotting disorders.\n\n==Diversity and phylogeny==\n[[File:Haemadipsa zeylanica japonica.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Haemadipsidae|Haemadipsa zeylanica]]'', a terrestrial leech found in the mountains of Japan]][[File:Parasite180056-fig1 Placobdelloides siamensis (Glossiphoniidae).png|thumb|''[[Placobdelloides siamensis]]'', a parasite of turtles in Thailand: left, dorsal face; right, ventral face with many young leeches]]\n\nSome 700 species of leech have been described, of which around 100 are marine, 90 terrestrial and the remainder freshwater.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Sket, Boris |author2=Trontelj, Peter |year=2008 |title=Global diversity of leeches (Hirudinea) in freshwater |journal=[[Hydrobiologia]] |volume=595 |issue=1 |pages=129\u2013137 |doi=10.1007/s10750-007-9010-8}}</ref><ref name=\"Fogden\">{{Cite journal |author1=Fogden, S. |author2= Proctor, J. | title=Notes on the Feeding of Land Leeches (''Haemadipsa zeylanica'' Moore and ''H. picta'' Moore) in Gunung Mulu National Park, Sarawak |journal=Biotropica |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=172\u2013174 |year=1985 |doi=10.2307/2388511 | jstor=2388511 }}</ref> The smallest is about {{convert|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long, and the largest is the giant Amazonian leech, ''[[Haementeria ghilianii]]'', which can reach {{convert|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}. With the exception of Antarctica, leeches are found throughout the world but are at their most abundant in temperate lakes and ponds in the northern hemisphere; in fact the North Amarican leech fauna is largely identical to that of Europe. The terrestrial [[Haemadipsidae]] are mostly native to the tropics and subtropics while the acquatic [[Hirudinidae]] have a wider global range; both of these feed largely on mammals, including humans.<ref name=Ruppert/> \n\nOf freshwater leeches, very few species tolerate fast-flowing water, the majority preferring the shallow, vegetated areas on the edges of ponds and lakes, or the pools and backwaters of sluggish streams.

Typically, the body is [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorso-ventrally]] flattened and tapers at both ends.

The last seven segments contain the posterior brain and are fused to form the animal's tail sucker.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nThe body wall consists of a [[cuticle]], an [[epidermis]] and a thick layer of fibrous [[connective tissue]] in which are embedded the circular muscles, the diagonal muscles and the powerful longitudinal muscles. There are also dorso-ventral muscles. The coelomic channels run the full length of the body, the two main ones being on either side. The coelom has taken over the function of the hemal system (blood vessels) in other annelids. Part of the lining [[epithelium]] consists of [[chloragogen cell]]s which are used for the storage of nutrients and in [[excretion]]. There are ten to seventeen pairs of [[metanephridia]] (excretory organs) in the mid-region of the leech. From these, ducts typically lead to a [[urinary bladder]], which empties to the outside at a [[nephridiopore]].<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\n===Reproduction and development===\n{{further|Leech embryogenesis}}\n\nLeeches are [[Protandry|protandric]] hermaphrodites, with the male [[Sex organ|reproductive organs]], the [[testicle|testes]], maturing first and the [[ovary|ovaries]] later. In hirudinids, a pair will line up with the clitellar regions in contact, with the anterior end of one leech pointing towards the posterior end of the other; this results in the male gonopore of one leech being in contact with the female gonopore of the other. The penis passes a spermatophore into the female gonopore and sperm is transferred, and probably stored in, the vagina.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nSome [[Rhynchobdellida|jawless leeches]] (Rhynchobdellida) and [[Arhynchobdellida|proboscisless leeches]] (Arhynchobdellida) lack a penis, and in these, sperm is passed from one individual to another by hypodermic injection. The leeches intertwine and grasp each other with their suckers. A spermatophore is pushed by one through the integument of the other, usually into the clitellar region. The sperm is liberated and passes to the ovisacs, either through the coelomic channels or interstitially through specialist \"target tissue\" pathways.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nSome time after copulation, the small, relatively yolkless eggs are laid. In most species, an albumin-filled cocoon is secreted by the clitellum and receives one or more eggs as it passes over the female gonopore. The cocoon is fixed to a submerged object, or in the case of terrestrial leeches, deposited under a stone or buried in damp soil.

Leeches either have a pharynx that they can protrude, commonly called a proboscis, or a pharynx that they cannot protrude, and which in some groups is armed with jaws.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nIn the proboscisless leeches, the jaws of Arhynchobdellids are at the front of the mouth, and have three blades set at an angle to each other. In feeding these slice their way through the skin of the host, leaving a Y-shaped incision. Behind the blades is the mouth, located ventrally at the anterior end of the body. It leads successively into the [[pharynx]], a short oesophagus, a [[crop (anatomy)|crop]] (in some species), a stomach and a hindgut, which ends at an anus located just above the posterior sucker. The stomach may be a simple tube, but the crop, when present, is an enlarged part of the midgut with a number of pairs of ceca that stores ingested blood. The leech secretes an anticoagulant, [[hirudin]], in its [[saliva]] which prevents the blood from clotting before ingestion.<ref name=Ruppert/> A mature [[medicinal leech]] may feed only twice a year, taking months to digest a blood meal.<ref name=\"Brusca 2016\"/>\n\n[[File:Leach bite site.jpg|thumb|Leech bites on a cow's udder]]\n\nThe bodies of predatory leeches are similar, though instead of jaws many have a protrusible [[proboscis]], which for most of the time they keep retracted into the mouth. Such leeches are often [[ambush predator]]s that lie in wait till they can strike prey with the proboscises in a spear-like fashion.<ref>{{cite web |title=All about leeches |last1=Govedich |first1=Fredric R. |last2=Bain |first2=Bonnie A. |date=14 March 2005 |url=http://www.invertebrate.us/leech/info/leech.pdf |accessdate=19 January 2010}}</ref> Predatory leeches feed on small invertebrates such as snails, earthworms and insect larvae.

Once attached, leeches use a combination of mucus and suction to stay in place while they inject hirudin into the hosts' [[Blood|blood stream]]s. In general, sanguivorous leeches are non host-specific, and do little harm to their host, dropping off after consuming a blood meal. Some marine species, however, remain attached until it is time to reproduce.

Nonbloodsucking leeches, such as ''Erpobdella punctata'', are host to three bacterial symbionts, ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', ''[[Aeromonas]]'', and ''[[Klebsiella]]'' spp. (a slime producer). The bacteria are passed from parent to offspring in the cocoon as it is formed.<ref name=\"Sawyer2\"/>\n\n[[File:PSM V17 D495 The medicinal leech.jpg|thumb|upright|The leech and its nervous system]]\n\n===Nervous system===\n\nThe nervous system of leeches is formed of a small number of large [[nerve cell]]s; this has resulted in leeches being used as [[model organism]]s for the study of invertebrate nervous systems. The main nerve centre consists of the cerebral ganglion above the gut and another ganglion beneath it, with connecting nerves forming a ring around the pharynx a little way behind the mouth. A nerve cord runs backwards from this in the ventral coelomic channel, with 21 pairs of [[segmental ganglia|ganglia in segments]] 6 to 26. In segments 27 to 33, other paired ganglia fuse to form the caudal ganglion.<ref name=Ruppert/> Several sensory nerves connect directly to the cerebral ganglion; there are sensory and motor nerve cells connected to the ventral nerve cord ganglia in each segment.<ref name=\"Brusca 2016\"/>\n\nLeeches have between two and ten [[Pigment spot ocellus|pigment spot ocelli]], arranged in pairs towards the front of the body. There are also sensory papillae arranged in a lateral row in one annulation of each segment. Each papilla contains many sensory cells. Some rhynchobdellids have the ability to change colour dramatically by moving pigment in [[chromatophore]] cells; this process is under the control of the nervous system but its function is unclear as the change in hue seems unrelated to the colour of the surroundings.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nLeeches can detect touch, vibration, movement of nearby objects, and chemicals secreted by their hosts; freshwater leeches crawl or swim towards a potential host standing in their pond within a few seconds. Species that feed on warm-blooded hosts move towards warmer objects. Many leeches avoid light, though some blood feeders move towards light when they are ready to feed, presumably increasing the chances of finding a host.<ref name=\"Brusca 2016\"/>\n\n===Gas exchange===\n\nLeeches live in damp surroundings and in general respire through their body wall. The exception to this is in the Piscicolidae, where branching or leaf-like lateral outgrowths from the body wall form [[gill]]s.

The posterior end is attached to the substrate, and the anterior end is projected forward peristaltically by the circular muscles until it touches down, as far as it can reach, and the anterior end is attached. Then the posterior end is released, pulled forward by the longitudinal muscles, and reattached; then the anterior end is released, and the cycle repeats.<ref name=\"Brusca 2016\">{{cite book |last=Brusca |first=Richard |title=Hirudinoidea: Leeches and Their Relatives |work=Invertebrates |publisher=Sinauer Associates |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-60535-375-3 |pages=591\u2013597}}</ref> Leeches explore their environment with head movements and body waving.<ref name=Sawyer/> The Hirudinidae and [[Erpobdellidae]] can swim rapidly with up-and-down or sideways undulations of the body; the Glossiphoniidae in contrast are poor swimmers, and curl up and fall to the substrate when disturbed.<ref name=Smith>{{cite book|author=Smith, Douglas Grant|title=Pennak's Freshwater Invertebrates of the United States: Porifera to Crustacea |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xt3WDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA305 |year=2001 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-35837-4 |page=305}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Leech looping locomotion.jpg|Leeches [[Animal locomotion#Peristalsis and looping|move by looping]] using their front and back suckers.\nFile:20100214 Leech climbing door at Lake Leake, Tasmania.ogv|Video of looping movement\n</gallery>\n\n==Interactions with humans==\n[[File:Leech Removal.JPG|upright|thumb|Leeches can be removed by hand, since they do not burrow into the skin or leave the head in the wound.<ref>{{cite book |last=Burke |first=Don |year=2005 |title=The complete Burke's backyard: the ultimate book of fact sheets |publisher=Murdoch Books |isbn=978-1-74045-739-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMMjW6AuzHAC}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Fujimoto |first1=Gary |last2=Robin |first2=Marc |last3=Dessery |first3=Bradford | year=2003 |title=The Traveler's Medical Guide |publisher=Prairie Smoke Press |isbn=978-0-9704482-5-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ah-85u5kmywC}}</ref>]]\n\n===Bites===\n\nLeech bites are generally alarming rather than dangerous, though a small percentage of people have severe allergic or [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reactions]] and require urgent medical care.

They are closely related to the [[Oligochaeta|oligochaetes]], which include the [[earthworm]]s, and like them have soft, muscular, segmented bodies that can lengthen and contract. Both groups are [[hermaphrodite]]s and have a [[clitellum]], but leeches typically differ from the oligochaetes in having suckers at both ends and in having external annulations that do not correspond with their internal segmentation. The body is muscular and relatively solid, and the [[coelom]], the spacious body cavity found in other annelids, is reduced to small channels.\n\nThe majority of leeches live in freshwater habitats, while some species can be found in terrestrial and marine environments. The best-known species, such as the medicinal leech, ''[[Hirudo medicinalis]]'', are [[hematophagous]], attaching themselves to a host with a sucker and feeding on blood, having first secreted the peptide [[hirudin]] to prevent the blood from clotting. The jaws used by these to pierce the skin are replaced in other species by a proboscis, which is pushed into the skin. A minority of leech species are predatory, mostly preying on small invertebrates.\n\nThe eggs are enclosed in a cocoon which in aquatic species is usually attached to an underwater surface; members of one family, [[Glossiphoniidae]], exhibit  parental care, the eggs being brooded by the parent. In terrestrial species, the cocoon is often concealed under a log or in a crevice. Almost seven hundred species of leech are currently recognised, of which some hundred are marine, ninety terrestrial and the remainder freshwater.\n\nLeeches have been used in [[medicine]] from ancient times until the 19th century to [[bloodletting|draw blood]] from patients. In modern times, leeches find medical use in treatment of joint diseases such as [[epicondylitis]] and osteoarthritis, extremity vein diseases, and in [[microsurgery]], while hirudin is used as an [[anticoagulant]] drug to treat blood-clotting disorders.\n\n==Diversity and phylogeny==\n[[File:Haemadipsa zeylanica japonica.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Haemadipsidae|Haemadipsa zeylanica]]'', a terrestrial leech found in the mountains of Japan]][[File:Parasite180056-fig1 Placobdelloides siamensis (Glossiphoniidae).png|thumb|''[[Placobdelloides siamensis]]'', a parasite of turtles in Thailand: left, dorsal face; right, ventral face with many young leeches]]\n\nSome 700 species of leech have been described, of which around 100 are marine, 90 terrestrial and the remainder freshwater.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Sket, Boris |author2=Trontelj, Peter |year=2008 |title=Global diversity of leeches (Hirudinea) in freshwater |journal=[[Hydrobiologia]] |volume=595 |issue=1 |pages=129\u2013137 |doi=10.1007/s10750-007-9010-8}}</ref><ref name=\"Fogden\">{{Cite journal |author1=Fogden, S. |author2= Proctor, J. | title=Notes on the Feeding of Land Leeches (''Haemadipsa zeylanica'' Moore and ''H. picta'' Moore) in Gunung Mulu National Park, Sarawak |journal=Biotropica |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=172\u2013174 |year=1985 |doi=10.2307/2388511 | jstor=2388511 }}</ref> The smallest is about {{convert|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long, and the largest is the giant Amazonian leech, ''[[Haementeria ghilianii]]'', which can reach {{convert|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}.

Typically, the body is [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorso-ventrally]] flattened and tapers at both ends.

The last seven segments contain the posterior brain and are fused to form the animal's tail sucker.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nThe body wall consists of a [[cuticle]], an [[epidermis]] and a thick layer of fibrous [[connective tissue]] in which are embedded the circular muscles, the diagonal muscles and the powerful longitudinal muscles. There are also dorso-ventral muscles. The coelomic channels run the full length of the body, the two main ones being on either side. The coelom has taken over the function of the hemal system (blood vessels) in other annelids. Part of the lining [[epithelium]] consists of [[chloragogen cell]]s which are used for the storage of nutrients and in [[excretion]]. There are ten to seventeen pairs of [[metanephridia]] (excretory organs) in the mid-region of the leech. From these, ducts typically lead to a [[urinary bladder]], which empties to the outside at a [[nephridiopore]].<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\n===Reproduction and development===\n{{further|Leech embryogenesis}}\n\nLeeches are [[Protandry|protandric]] hermaphrodites, with the male [[Sex organ|reproductive organs]], the [[testicle|testes]], maturing first and the [[ovary|ovaries]] later. In hirudinids, a pair will line up with the clitellar regions in contact, with the anterior end of one leech pointing towards the posterior end of the other; this results in the male gonopore of one leech being in contact with the female gonopore of the other. The penis passes a spermatophore into the female gonopore and sperm is transferred, and probably stored in, the vagina.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nSome [[Rhynchobdellida|jawless leeches]] (Rhynchobdellida) and [[Arhynchobdellida|proboscisless leeches]] (Arhynchobdellida) lack a penis, and in these, sperm is passed from one individual to another by hypodermic injection. The leeches intertwine and grasp each other with their suckers. A spermatophore is pushed by one through the integument of the other, usually into the clitellar region. The sperm is liberated and passes to the ovisacs, either through the coelomic channels or interstitially through specialist \"target tissue\" pathways.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nSome time after copulation, the small, relatively yolkless eggs are laid. In most species, an albumin-filled cocoon is secreted by the clitellum and receives one or more eggs as it passes over the female gonopore. The cocoon is fixed to a submerged object, or in the case of terrestrial leeches, deposited under a stone or buried in damp soil.

Leeches either have a pharynx that they can protrude, commonly called a proboscis, or a pharynx that they cannot protrude, and which in some groups is armed with jaws.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nIn the proboscisless leeches, the jaws of Arhynchobdellids are at the front of the mouth, and have three blades set at an angle to each other. In feeding these slice their way through the skin of the host, leaving a Y-shaped incision. Behind the blades is the mouth, located ventrally at the anterior end of the body. It leads successively into the [[pharynx]], a short oesophagus, a [[crop (anatomy)|crop]] (in some species), a stomach and a hindgut, which ends at an anus located just above the posterior sucker. The stomach may be a simple tube, but the crop, when present, is an enlarged part of the midgut with a number of pairs of ceca that stores ingested blood. The leech secretes an anticoagulant, [[hirudin]], in its [[saliva]] which prevents the blood from clotting before ingestion.<ref name=Ruppert/> A mature [[medicinal leech]] may feed only twice a year, taking months to digest a blood meal.<ref name=\"Brusca 2016\"/>\n\n[[File:Leach bite site.jpg|thumb|Leech bites on a cow's udder]]\n\nThe bodies of predatory leeches are similar, though instead of jaws many have a protrusible [[proboscis]], which for most of the time they keep retracted into the mouth. Such leeches are often [[ambush predator]]s that lie in wait till they can strike prey with the proboscises in a spear-like fashion.<ref>{{cite web |title=All about leeches |last1=Govedich |first1=Fredric R. |last2=Bain |first2=Bonnie A. |date=14 March 2005 |url=http://www.invertebrate.us/leech/info/leech.pdf |accessdate=19 January 2010}}</ref> Predatory leeches feed on small invertebrates such as snails, earthworms and insect larvae.

Once attached, leeches use a combination of mucus and suction to stay in place while they inject hirudin into the hosts' [[Blood|blood stream]]s. In general, sanguivorous leeches are non host-specific, and do little harm to their host, dropping off after consuming a blood meal. Some marine species, however, remain attached until it is time to reproduce.

Nonbloodsucking leeches, such as ''Erpobdella punctata'', are host to three bacterial symbionts, ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', ''[[Aeromonas]]'', and ''[[Klebsiella]]'' spp. (a slime producer). The bacteria are passed from parent to offspring in the cocoon as it is formed.<ref name=\"Sawyer2\"/>\n\n[[File:PSM V17 D495 The medicinal leech.jpg|thumb|upright|The leech and its nervous system]]\n\n===Nervous system===\n\nThe nervous system of leeches is formed of a small number of large [[nerve cell]]s; this has resulted in leeches being used as [[model organism]]s for the study of invertebrate nervous systems. The main nerve centre consists of the cerebral ganglion above the gut and another ganglion beneath it, with connecting nerves forming a ring around the pharynx a little way behind the mouth. A nerve cord runs backwards from this in the ventral coelomic channel, with 21 pairs of [[segmental ganglia|ganglia in segments]] 6 to 26. In segments 27 to 33, other paired ganglia fuse to form the caudal ganglion.<ref name=Ruppert/> Several sensory nerves connect directly to the cerebral ganglion; there are sensory and motor nerve cells connected to the ventral nerve cord ganglia in each segment.<ref name=\"Brusca 2016\"/>\n\nLeeches have between two and ten [[Pigment spot ocellus|pigment spot ocelli]], arranged in pairs towards the front of the body. There are also sensory papillae arranged in a lateral row in one annulation of each segment. Each papilla contains many sensory cells. Some rhynchobdellids have the ability to change colour dramatically by moving pigment in [[chromatophore]] cells; this process is under the control of the nervous system but its function is unclear as the change in hue seems unrelated to the colour of the surroundings.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nLeeches can detect touch, vibration, movement of nearby objects, and chemicals secreted by their hosts; freshwater leeches crawl or swim towards a potential host standing in their pond within a few seconds. Species that feed on warm-blooded hosts move towards warmer objects. Many leeches avoid light, though some blood feeders move towards light when they are ready to feed, presumably increasing the chances of finding a host.<ref name=\"Brusca 2016\"/>\n\n===Gas exchange===\n\nLeeches live in damp surroundings and in general respire through their body wall. The exception to this is in the Piscicolidae, where branching or leaf-like lateral outgrowths from the body wall form [[gill]]s.

The posterior end is attached to the substrate, and the anterior end is projected forward peristaltically by the circular muscles until it touches down, as far as it can reach, and the anterior end is attached. Then the posterior end is released, pulled forward by the longitudinal muscles, and reattached; then the anterior end is released, and the cycle repeats.<ref name=\"Brusca 2016\">{{cite book |last=Brusca |first=Richard |title=Hirudinoidea: Leeches and Their Relatives |work=Invertebrates |publisher=Sinauer Associates |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-60535-375-3 |pages=591\u2013597}}</ref> Leeches explore their environment with head movements and body waving.<ref name=Sawyer/> The Hirudinidae and [[Erpobdellidae]] can swim rapidly with up-and-down or sideways undulations of the body; the Glossiphoniidae in contrast are poor swimmers, and curl up and fall to the substrate when disturbed.<ref name=Smith>{{cite book|author=Smith, Douglas Grant|title=Pennak's Freshwater Invertebrates of the United States: Porifera to Crustacea |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xt3WDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA305 |year=2001 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-35837-4 |page=305}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Leech looping locomotion.jpg|Leeches [[Animal locomotion#Peristalsis and looping|move by looping]] using their front and back suckers.\nFile:20100214 Leech climbing door at Lake Leake, Tasmania.ogv|Video of looping movement\n</gallery>\n\n==Interactions with humans==\n[[File:Leech Removal.JPG|upright|thumb|Leeches can be removed by hand, since they do not burrow into the skin or leave the head in the wound.<ref>{{cite book |last=Burke |first=Don |year=2005 |title=The complete Burke's backyard: the ultimate book of fact sheets |publisher=Murdoch Books |isbn=978-1-74045-739-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMMjW6AuzHAC}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Fujimoto |first1=Gary |last2=Robin |first2=Marc |last3=Dessery |first3=Bradford | year=2003 |title=The Traveler's Medical Guide |publisher=Prairie Smoke Press |isbn=978-0-9704482-5-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ah-85u5kmywC}}</ref>]]\n\n===Bites===\n\nLeech bites are generally alarming rather than dangerous, though a small percentage of people have severe allergic or [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reactions]] and require urgent medical care.
