He explains that, unlike other cases of sexual abuse or harassment that could have been ignored without being taken seriously or adequately investigated, Mia Farrow's accusation against him was taken with the utmost seriousness and was immediately and thoroughly investigated by two groups of different experts.\n\nOn the one hand, the police and the prosecution hired the most prestigious experts in the country: the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic at the Yale-New Haven Hospital, whom the police used to look into such matters and who concluded that the evidence conclusively proved that there was not sexual abuse, that Dylan\u00b4s statements had \"a rehearsed quality\" and were likely \"coached or influenced by her mother. \" Regarding the criticism against Yale New haven for having destroyed the original notes at the time of incorporating them into the report, Allen reveals that in the course of the trial it turned out that it was the usual procedure of both Yale New Haven and the FBI to preserve privacy\n\nOn the other hand, the New York State Child Welfare scrupulously investigated the case for 14 months and concluded that there was no credible evidence of abuse and that the allegation was unfounded.\n\nAllen recounts a session of the Yale-New Haven investigation during which Mia Farrow explained to experts how Dylan was so disturbed by the sexual abuse that she immediately rushed to her sister Lark's room for comfort. Farrow described how Dylan hugged Lark and how Lark comforted her. When Allen noted that Lark was in New York on the day the abuse was alleged to have happened and there was no way Dylan would have come to her, hugged her, and Lark comfort her, Mia Farrow changed her account and said that \"\" Lark was in New York at the time, but Dylan hugged her spiritually. \" Allen concluded that while Mia Farrow's story may have had some impact on the judges, it did not mislead investigators.\n\nRegarding the investigation conducted by Connecticut prosecutor Frank Maco, Allen indicates that from the moment the experts the prosecution had hired totally rejected the possibility of sexual abuse, the prosecution's investigation should have been closed. That it was kept open without any justification and that this fact was in favor of Farrow during the custody trial, that the statement at the prosecutor's press conference saying that there was probable cause was totally unfounded once the prosecution experts had already completely ruled out the possibility of sexual abuse. Allen points out that it is absurd to think that the prosecutor did not initiate prosecution becouse he did not want to hurt Dylan when he had police question Dylan for months without caring at all about Dylan's well-being. Allen also indicates that a nanny and a housekeeper who worked at Mia Farrow's house stated that on multiple occasions the prosecutor \u00a0showed up by the house and he and Mia Farrow went out to luch. Allen \u00a0regrets that this does not seem the most appropriate way conducting an impartial investigation.\n\nAllen also says that in the custody trial, the Court Clerk drove Mia Farrow to her home from the courthouse many nights and thinks it was a \u00a0\u201cunfair conduit to the judge\u201d, recalls the testimony by Moses Farrow, who said he witnessed how Mia Farrow coached Dylan to say that she had been abused, collects the testimony of a babysitter to whom Dylan said \"Mummy wants me to lie.\" Allen says that long before the allegation of abuse emerged Mia Farrow took Dylan to a child therapist because the girl had trouble distinguishing between reality and fantasy. The girl who under normal conditions had trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy was in the exclusive care of her mother, and during this strong and confusing emotional crisis, Farrow suggested to the child that she had been abused, which resulted in Dylan sincerely believing it.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Allen, Woody.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1147948052|title=Apropos of Nothing|isbn=978-1-951627-34-8|oclc=1147948052}}</ref>\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|26em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite news|last1=Hoban|first1=Phoebe|title=Woody and Mia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uQCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA40|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=September 21, 1992|pages=32\u201342}}\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/nyregion/doctor-cites-inconsistencies-in-dylan-farrow-s-statements.html Doctor Cites Inconsistencies In Dylan Farrow's Statements], The New York Times, May 4, 1993\n* [http://articles.latimes.com/1993-02-02/news/mn-952_1_woody-allen Nanny Casts Doubt on Farrow Charges : Custody: She tells Allen's lawyers the actress pressured her to support molestation accusations against him.

Moses explains that on the afternoon of August 4 he was at home: \"As the \u201cman of the house\u201d that day, I had promised to keep an eye out for any trouble, and I was doing just that. I remember where Woody sat in the TV room, and I can picture where Dylan and Satchel were. Not that everybody stayed glued to the same spot, but I deliberately made sure to note everyone's coming and going. I do remember that Woody would leave the room on occasion, but never with Dylan. He would wander into another room to make a phone call, read the paper, use the bathroom, or step outside to get some air and walk around the large pond on the property.\"<ref name=\"MosesFarrowMay2018\" /> Moses also indicates that the memory that his sister keeps from having suffered abuse while focusing her attention on an electric train set is not possible: \"It\u2019s a precise and compelling narrative, but there\u2019s a major problem: there ''was'' no electric train set in that attic. There was, in fact, no way for kids to play up there, even if we had wanted to. It was an unfinished crawl space, under a steeply-angled gabled roof, with exposed nails and floorboards, billows of fiberglass insulation, filled with mousetraps and droppings and stinking of mothballs, and crammed with trunks full of hand-me-down clothes and my mother\u2019s old wardrobes.

He explains that, unlike other cases of sexual abuse or harassment that could have been ignored without being taken seriously or adequately investigated, Mia Farrow's accusation against him was taken with the utmost seriousness and was immediately and thoroughly investigated by two groups of different experts.\n\nOn the one hand, the police and the prosecution hired the most prestigious experts in the country: the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic at the Yale-New Haven Hospital, whom the police used to look into such matters and who concluded that the evidence conclusively proved that there was not sexual abuse, that Dylan\u00b4s statements had \"a rehearsed quality\" and were likely \"coached or influenced by her mother. \" Regarding the criticism against Yale New haven for having destroyed the original notes at the time of incorporating them into the report, Allen reveals that in the course of the trial it turned out that it was the usual procedure of both Yale New Haven and the FBI to preserve privacy\n\nOn the other hand, the New York State Child Welfare scrupulously investigated the case for 14 months and concluded that there was no credible evidence of abuse and that the allegation was unfounded.\n\nAllen recounts a session of the Yale-New Haven investigation during which Mia Farrow explained to experts how Dylan was so disturbed by the sexual abuse that she immediately rushed to her sister Lark's room for comfort. Farrow described how Dylan hugged Lark and how Lark comforted her. When Allen noted that Lark was in New York on the day the abuse was alleged to have happened and there was no way Dylan would have come to her, hugged her, and Lark comfort her, Mia Farrow changed her account and said that \"\" Lark was in New York at the time, but Dylan hugged her spiritually. \" Allen concluded that while Mia Farrow's story may have had some impact on the judges, it did not mislead investigators.\n\nRegarding the investigation conducted by Connecticut prosecutor Frank Maco, Allen indicates that from the moment the experts the prosecution had hired totally rejected the possibility of sexual abuse, the prosecution's investigation should have been closed. That it was kept open without any justification and that this fact was in favor of Farrow during the custody trial, that the statement at the prosecutor's press conference saying that there was probable cause was totally unfounded once the prosecution experts had already completely ruled out the possibility of sexual abuse. Allen points out that it is absurd to think that the prosecutor did not initiate prosecution becouse he did not want to hurt Dylan when he had police question Dylan for months without caring at all about Dylan's well-being. Allen also indicates that a nanny and a housekeeper who worked at Mia Farrow's house stated that on multiple occasions the prosecutor \u00a0showed up by the house and he and Mia Farrow went out to luch. Allen \u00a0regrets that this does not seem the most appropriate way conducting an impartial investigation.\n\nAllan also says that in the custody trial, the Court Clerk drove Mia Farrow to her home from the courthose many nigths and thinks it was a \u00a0\u201cunfair conduit to the judge\u201d, recalls the testimony by Moses Farrow, who said he witnessed how Mia Farrow coached Dylan to say that she had been abused, collects the testimony of a babysitter to whom Dylan said \"Mummy want me to lie.\" Allen says that long before the allegation of abuse emerged Mia Farrow took Dylan to a child therapist because the girl had trouble distinguishing between reality and fantasy. The girl who under normal conditions had trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy was at the exclusive care of her mother during a strong and confusing emotional crisis Farrow suggested the child that she had been abused, which ended up leading to Dylan sincerely believed it.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Allen, Woody.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1147948052|title=Apropos of Nothing|isbn=978-1-951627-34-8|oclc=1147948052}}</ref>\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|26em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite news|last1=Hoban|first1=Phoebe|title=Woody and Mia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uQCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA40|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=September 21, 1992|pages=32\u201342}}\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/nyregion/doctor-cites-inconsistencies-in-dylan-farrow-s-statements.html Doctor Cites Inconsistencies In Dylan Farrow's Statements], The New York Times, May 4, 1993\n* [http://articles.latimes.com/1993-02-02/news/mn-952_1_woody-allen Nanny Casts Doubt on Farrow Charges : Custody: She tells Allen's lawyers the actress pressured her to support molestation accusations against him.

The Deaf communities of India are still struggling for ISL to gain the status of sign language as a minority language. Though sign language is used by many deaf people in India, it is not used officially in schools for teaching purposes.In 2005, India the National Curricular Framework (NCF) gave some degree of legitimacy to sign language education, by hinting that sign languages may qualify as an optional third language choice for hearing students.  [[NCERT]] in March 2006 launched a class III text includes a chapter on sign language, emphasising the fact that it is a language like any other and is \"yet another mode of communication.\" The aim was to create healthy attitudes towards the [[differently abled]].\n \nMany efforts have been made by the Deaf communities, NGO's, researchers and other organisations working for deaf people, including All India Federation of Deaf (AIFD), National association of the Deaf (NAD) in the direction of encouraging ISL.Until 2001, no formal classes for teaching ISL were conducted in India. During this period, Ali Yavar Jung National Institute of Hearing Handicapped (AYJNIHH), Mumbai, established ISL cell. It started a course \"Diploma in Sign Language Interpreter Course\".  The curriculum designed for the course aims to develop professional communicative competence in Sign language and ability to interpret professionally. It also focused on the basic understanding of Deaf community and Deaf culture. Later, the course was offered in the regional centres in Hyderabad, Bhuvaneshwar, Kolkata and Delhi.\nBesides AYJNIHH, organisations like Mook Badhir Sangathan in Indore and several other organisations are offering ISL classes. Many NGO's all over the India use ISL to teach English and various academic and vocational courses. These include ISHARA, Mumbai; Deaf Way Foundation, Delhi; Noida Deaf Society; Leadership Education Empowerment of Deaf (LEED), Pune; Speaking Hands Institute for the Deaf, Punjab, etc. (Randhawa, 2014) . The associations like Association of Sign Language Interpreters (ASLI) and Indian Sign Language Interpreters Association (ISLIA) were established in 2006 and 2008 respectively for the professional development of Interpreters in India.\nThe two schools have been established in India which is following bilingual approach to teach deaf students. One is Bajaj Institute of Learning (BIL) in Dehradun and the other is Mook Badhir Sangathan in Indore. \nApart from the establishment of organisations working for Deaf people there has been a spurt in research on sign language in India. Recent additions are the research studies by research scholars of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and University of Delhi including Wallang, 2007 ; Sinha,2003,2008/2013 ; Hidam,2010 ; Kulsheshtra, 2013 . There is also work on problems and awareness of ISL and typology of ISL verbs (Morgan 2009,2010) . Apart from these there have been continued works by scholars on linguistic aspects of ISL as well as on varieties of ISL (Bhattacharya and Hidam 2010, Aboh, Pfau, and Zeshan 2005, Zeshan and Panda 2011, Panda 2011, Panda 2012).\nThe earnest step taken by the Government of India to promote sign language was establishment of the ISLRTC. However, currently the autonomy of the Research centre is a contentious issue, yet to be resolved.\n\n==Varieties==\nThere are many [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of sign language in the region, including many pockets of [[home sign]] and local sign languages, such as [[Ghandruk Sign Language]], [[Jhankot Sign Language]], and [[Jumla Sign Language]] in Nepal, and [[Alipur Sign Language]] in India, which appear to be [[language isolates]]. There are also various [[Sri Lankan sign languages]] which may not even be related to each other. However, the urban varieties of India, Pakistan, Nepal ([[Nepalese Sign Language]]), and Bangladesh are clearly related (although, for [[Nepalese Sign Language]] at least, it is not clear whether the relation is genetic, or perhaps rather one of borrowing compounded by extensive incorporation of a shared South Asian gestural base). There is disagreement whether these related varieties should be considered separate languages.\n\n* Woodward (1993) found cognacy rates of 62\u201371%; he concluded that the various varieties are separate languages belonging to the same language family.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last= Woodward\n| first= J\n| year = 1993\n| title = The relationship of sign language varieties in India, Pakistan and Nepal\n| journal= Sign Language Studies\n| volume= 1078\n| issue= 78\n| pages= 15\u201322| doi= 10.1353/sls.1993.0010\n}}</ref>\n\n* Zeshan (2000)<ref name=Zeshan/> proposes that Indian and Pakistani SL are varieties of a single language.\n* The [[ISO 639-3]] standard categorises these varieties as three separate sign languages in India and Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal. ''Ethnologue'' (2016), which follows the ISO standard, acknowledges the relatedness of these varieties as well as the controversy over whether they are one language or many.<ref>{{citation \n|chapter= Indian Sign Language\n|title= Ethnologue\n|edition= 19\n|date= 2016\n|accessdate= 23 October 2016\n|publisher= SIL International\n|chapter-url= http://www.ethnologue.com/language/ins\n}}</ref> They identify the following dialects within India: Bangalore-Chennai-Hyderabad Sign Language, Mumbai-Delhi Sign Language and  Kolkata Sign Language.\n\n* Johnson and Johnson (2016)<ref name=\"JohnsonJohnson2016\">{{cite journal\n|last1=  Johnson\n|first1= Russell J.\n|last2=  Johnson\n|first2= Jane E.\n|year=   2016\n|title=  Distinction between West Bengal Sign Language, and Indian Sign Language Based on Statistical Assessment\n|journal= Sign Language Studies\n|volume= 16\n|issue= 4\n|pages= 473\u2013499\n|url= http://gupress.gallaudet.edu/SLS/SLS16-4.html#bengalsl\n|doi= 10.1353/sls.2016.0016\n}}</ref> argue that the varieties used in Kolkata and Bangladesh are distinct from that used in Delhi, and probably also from each other.\n\nWhile the sign system in ISL appears to be largely indigenous, elements in ISL are derived from [[British Sign Language]]. For example, most ISL signers nowadays use [[fingerspelling]] based on [[British Sign Language]] [[fingerspelling]], with only isolated groups using an indigenous [[devanagari]]-based [[fingerspelling]] system (for example, Deaf students and graduates of the school for the deaf in [[Vadodara]]/Baroda, [[Gujarat]]). In addition, more recently contact with foreign Deaf has resulted in rather extensive borrowing from International Signs and (either directly or via International Signs) from [[American Sign Language]]. A small number of the Deaf in and around [[Bengaluru]] are often said to use [[American Sign Language]] (owing to a longstanding ASL deaf school there); however it is probably more correct to say that they use a lexicon based largely on ASL (or [[Signed English]]), while incorporating also a not inconsequential ISL element.

The first study of the sign language of these children, which is almost certainly related to modern IPSL, was in 1928 by British teacher H. C. Banerjee. She visited three residential schools for deaf children, at [[Dacca]], [[Barisal]] and Calcutta, observing that \"in all these schools the teachers have discouraged the growth of the sign language, which in spite of this official disapproval, has grown and flourished.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Banerjee | first1 = H.C. | year = 1928 | title = The sign language of deaf-mutes | url = | journal = Indian Journal of Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 69\u201387 }} (quote from p.70)</ref> She compared sign vocabularies at the different schools and described the signs in words in an appendix.\n\nA rare case of a public event conducted in sign language was reported by a mission in [[Palayamkottai]] in 1906: \"Our services for the Deaf are chiefly in the sign language, in which all can join alike, whether learning [[Tamil language|Tamil]], as those do who belong to the [[Madras Presidency]], or English, which is taught to those coming from other parts.\"<ref>Swainson, Florence (1906). \"Report of the Deaf and Dumb and Industrial School in connection with the Church of England Zenana Mission, Palamcottah, South India, for 1905\".

Zeshan (2014) discusses three aspects of ISL: its lexicon, syntax and spatial grammar. Some distinct features of ISL that differ from other sign languages include:\n\n1) Number Signs: The numbers from zero to nine are formed in ISL by holding up a hand with the appropriate handshape for each number. From one to five the corresponding number of extended fingers forms the numeral sign, whereas for zero and the numbers from six to nine special handshapes are used that derive from written numbers. Ten may either be expressed by two 5-hands or by \u20181+0\u2019. (Zeshan, 2000)\n\n2) Family Relationship: The signs for family relationship are preceded by the sign for \u2018male/man\u2019 and \u2018female/woman\u2019.\n\nE.g.: \n    i) BROTHER: MAN + SIBLING \n    \n    ii) SISTER: WOMAN + SIBLING\n\n3) Sign families: Several signs belong to same family if they share one or more parameters including handshapes, place of articulation and movement.\n\nE.g.: \n    i)PASS and FAIL \u2013 The handshape for the sign is same but they move in opposite direction.\n    \n    ii)MONEY, PAY and RICH \u2013 They have same handshape but different place of articulation and movement pattern.\n   \n    iii)THINK, KNOW and UNDERSTAND \u2013 The place of articulation is head which is same for all signs.\n\n4) The ISL consists of various non-manual gestures including mouth pattern, mouth gesture, facial expression, body posture, head position and eye gaze (Zeshan, 2001)\n\n5)  There is no temporal inflection in ISL. The past, present and future is depicted by using signs for before, then, and after.\n\n6) The question words like WHAT, WHERE, WHICH, HOW etc. are placed at the end of interrogative sentences.\n\n  i) English: Where is the bank?\n     ISL    : BANK WHERE\n    \n ii) English: Who is sick?\n     ISL    : SICK WHO\n\n7) The use of space is a crucial feature of ISL.\n\n{{quote|Sentences are always [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] final, and all of the signs from the open lexical classes can function as predicates. Ellipsis is extensive, and one-word sentences are common. There is a strong preference for sentences with only one lexical argument. Constituent order does not play any role in the marking of grammatical relations. These are coded exclusively by spatial mechanisms (e.g., directional signs) or inferred from the context. Temporal expressions usually come first in the sentence, and if there is a functional particle, it always follows the predicate (e.g., YESTERDAY FATHER DIE COMPLETIVE \u2013 \"(My) father died yesterday\").<ref>Zeshan, U.

The Deaf communities of India are still struggling for ISL to gain the status of sign language as a minority language. Though sign language is used by many deaf people in India, it is not used officially in schools for teaching purposes.In 2005, India the National Curricular Framework (NCF) gave some degree of legitimacy to sign language education, by hinting that sign languages may qualify as an optional third language choice for hearing students.  [[NCERT]] in March 2006 launched a class III text includes a chapter on sign language, emphasising the fact that it is a language like any other and is \"yet another mode of communication.\" The aim was to create healthy attitudes towards the [[differently abled]].\n \nMany efforts have been made by the Deaf communities, NGO's, researchers and other organisations working for deaf people, including All India Federation of Deaf (AIFD), National association of the Deaf (NAD) in the direction of encouraging ISL.Until 2001, no formal classes for teaching ISL were conducted in India. During this period, Ali Yavar Jung National Institute of Hearing Handicapped (AYJNIHH), Mumbai, established ISL cell. It started a course \"Diploma in Sign Language Interpreter Course\".  The curriculum designed for the course aims to develop professional communicative competence in Sign language and ability to interpret professionally. It also focused on the basic understanding of Deaf community and Deaf culture. Later, the course was offered in the regional centres in Hyderabad, Bhuvaneshwar, Kolkata and Delhi.\nBesides AYJNIHH, organisations like Mook Badhir Sangathan in Indore and several other organisations are offering ISL classes. Many NGO's all over the India use ISL to teach English and various academic and vocational courses. These include ISHARA, Mumbai; Deaf Way Foundation, Delhi; Noida Deaf Society; Leadership Education Empowerment of Deaf (LEED), Pune; Speaking Hands Institute for the Deaf, Punjab, etc. (Randhawa, 2014) . The associations like Association of Sign Language Interpreters (ASLI) and Indian Sign Language Interpreters Association (ISLIA) were established in 2006 and 2008 respectively for the professional development of Interpreters in India.\nThe two schools have been established in India which is following bilingual approach to teach deaf students. One is Bajaj Institute of Learning (BIL) in Dehradun and the other is Mook Badhir Sangathan in Indore. \nApart from the establishment of organisations working for Deaf people there has been a spurt in research on sign language in India. Recent additions are the research studies by research scholars of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and University of Delhi including Wallang, 2007 ; Sinha,2003,2008/2013 ; Hidam,2010 ; Kulsheshtra, 2013 . There is also work on problems and awareness of ISL and typology of ISL verbs (Morgan 2009,2010) . Apart from these there have been continued works by scholars on linguistic aspects of ISL as well as on varieties of ISL (Bhattacharya and Hidam 2010, Aboh, Pfau, and Zeshan 2005, Zeshan and Panda 2011, Panda 2011, Panda 2012).\nThe earnest step taken by the Government of India to promote sign language was establishment of the ISLRTC. However, currently the autonomy of the Research centre is a contentious issue, yet to be resolved.\n\n==Varieties==\nThere are many [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of sign language in the region, including many pockets of [[home sign]] and local sign languages, such as [[Ghandruk Sign Language]], [[Jhankot Sign Language]], and [[Jumla Sign Language]] in Nepal, and [[Alipur Sign Language]] in India, which appear to be [[language isolates]]. There are also various [[Sri Lankan sign languages]] which may not even be related to each other. However, the urban varieties of India, Pakistan, Nepal ([[Nepalese Sign Language]]), and Bangladesh are clearly related (although, for [[Nepalese Sign Language]] at least, it is not clear whether the relation is genetic, or perhaps rather one of borrowing compounded by extensive incorporation of a shared South Asian gestural base). There is disagreement whether these related varieties should be considered separate languages.\n\n* Woodward (1993) found cognacy rates of 62\u201371%; he concluded that the various varieties are separate languages belonging to the same language family.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last= Woodward\n| first= J\n| year = 1993\n| title = The relationship of sign language varieties in India, Pakistan and Nepal\n| journal= Sign Language Studies\n| volume= 1078\n| issue= 78\n| pages= 15\u201322| doi= 10.1353/sls.1993.0010\n}}</ref>\n\n* Zeshan (2000)<ref name=Zeshan/> proposes that Indian and Pakistani SL are varieties of a single language.\n* The [[ISO 639-3]] standard categorises these varieties as three separate sign languages in India and Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal. ''Ethnologue'' (2016), which follows the ISO standard, acknowledges the relatedness of these varieties as well as the controversy over whether they are one language or many.<ref>{{citation \n|chapter= Indian Sign Language\n|title= Ethnologue\n|edition= 19\n|date= 2016\n|accessdate= 23 October 2016\n|publisher= SIL International\n|chapter-url= http://www.ethnologue.com/language/ins\n}}</ref> They identify the following dialects within India: Bangalore-Chennai-Hyderabad Sign Language, Mumbai-Delhi Sign Language and  Kolkata Sign Language.\n\n* Johnson and Johnson (2016)<ref name=\"JohnsonJohnson2016\">{{cite journal\n|last1=  Johnson\n|first1= Russell J.\n|last2=  Johnson\n|first2= Jane E.\n|year=   2016\n|title=  Distinction between West Bengal Sign Language, and Indian Sign Language Based on Statistical Assessment\n|journal= Sign Language Studies\n|volume= 16\n|issue= 4\n|pages= 473\u2013499\n|url= http://gupress.gallaudet.edu/SLS/SLS16-4.html#bengalsl\n|doi= 10.1353/sls.2016.0016\n}}</ref> argue that the varieties used in Kolkata and Bangladesh are distinct from that used in Delhi, and probably also from each other.\n\nWhile the sign system in ISL appears to be largely indigenous, elements in ISL are derived from [[British Sign Language]]. For example, most ISL signers nowadays use [[fingerspelling]] based on [[British Sign Language]] [[fingerspelling]], with only isolated groups using an indigenous [[devanagari]]-based [[fingerspelling]] system (for example, Deaf students and graduates of the school for the deaf in [[Vadodara]]/Baroda, [[Gujarat]]). In addition, more recently contact with foreign Deaf has resulted in rather extensive borrowing from International Signs and (either directly or via International Signs) from [[American Sign Language]].

The first study of the sign language of these children, which is almost certainly related to modern IPSL, was in 1928 by British teacher H. C. Banerjee. She visited three residential schools for deaf children, at [[Dacca]], [[Barisal]] and Calcutta, observing that \"in all these schools the teachers have discouraged the growth of the sign language, which in spite of this official disapproval, has grown and flourished.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Banerjee | first1 = H.C. | year = 1928 | title = The sign language of deaf-mutes | url = | journal = Indian Journal of Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 69\u201387 }} (quote from p.70)</ref> She compared sign vocabularies at the different schools and described the signs in words in an appendix.\n\nA rare case of a public event conducted in sign language was reported by a mission in [[Palayamkottai]] in 1906: \"Our services for the Deaf are chiefly in the sign language, in which all can join alike, whether learning [[Tamil language|Tamil]], as those do who belong to the [[Madras Presidency]], or English, which is taught to those coming from other parts.\"<ref>Swainson, Florence (1906). \"Report of the Deaf and Dumb and Industrial School in connection with the Church of England Zenana Mission, Palamcottah, South India, for 1905\".

Zeshan (2014) discusses three aspects of ISL: its lexicon, syntax and spatial grammar. Some distinct features of ISL that differ from other sign languages include:\n\n1) Number Signs: The numbers from zero to nine are formed in ISL by holding up a hand with the appropriate handshape for each number. From one to five the corresponding number of extended fingers forms the numeral sign, whereas for zero and the numbers from six to nine special handshapes are used that derive from written numbers. Ten may either be expressed by two 5-hands or by \u20181+0\u2019. (Zeshan, 2000)\n\n2) Family Relationship: The signs for family relationship are preceded by the sign for \u2018male/man\u2019 and \u2018female/woman\u2019.\n\nE.g.: \n    i) BROTHER: MAN + SIBLING \n    \n    ii) SISTER: WOMAN + SIBLING\n\n3) Sign families: Several signs belong to same family if they share one or more parameters including handshapes, place of articulation and movement.\n\nE.g.: \n    i)PASS and FAIL \u2013 The handshape for the sign is same but they move in opposite direction.\n    \n    ii)MONEY, PAY and RICH \u2013 They have same handshape but different place of articulation and movement pattern.\n   \n    iii)THINK, KNOW and UNDERSTAND \u2013 The place of articulation is head which is same for all signs.\n\n4) The ISL consists of various non-manual gestures including mouth pattern, mouth gesture, facial expression, body posture, head position and eye gaze (Zeshan, 2001)\n\n5)  There is no temporal inflection in ISL. The past, present and future is depicted by using signs for before, then, and after.\n\n6) The question words like WHAT, WHERE, WHICH, HOW etc. are placed at the end of interrogative sentences.\n\n  i) English: Where is the bank?\n     ISL    : BANK WHERE\n    \n ii) English: Who is sick?\n     ISL    : SICK WHO\n\n7) The use of space is a crucial feature of ISL.\n\n{{quote|Sentences are always [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] final, and all of the signs from the open lexical classes can function as predicates. Ellipsis is extensive, and one-word sentences are common. There is a strong preference for sentences with only one lexical argument. Constituent order does not play any role in the marking of grammatical relations. These are coded exclusively by spatial mechanisms (e.g., directional signs) or inferred from the context. Temporal expressions usually come first in the sentence, and if there is a functional particle, it always follows the predicate (e.g., YESTERDAY FATHER DIE COMPLETIVE \u2013 \"(My) father died yesterday\").<ref>Zeshan, U.

The assimilation process continued soon after the turn of the 20th century with [[World War I]], consolidated schools, and the advent of mandatory public education until the age of 16, with added pressures from increased mobility, the influence of English-language media, communications, and urbanization. Also, many German-Americans hid their ethnicity with the spread of anti-German sentiment and propaganda.\n\nOriginally, the economy of the region was almost entirely rural and agricultural, based on the immigrants' dream of bettering their lot through the ownership of their own farms. The small tradesmen indispensable to a rural economy, such as blacksmiths, wheelwrights, millers, and storekeepers, constituted the bulk of the non-farm economy. In the 19th century, a small educated class, comprising the Lutheran and Reformed ministers, began to emerge. The Pennsylvania seminaries educated them in High German so that they could preach to their flocks in a scholarly way.\n\nThe advent of the industrial revolution brought technologies based on coal, iron, canals, and railroads, but the Dutch, unversed in English, and lacking connections to the English-speaking establishment, were unable to engage in entrepreneurship on a large scale. Consequently, the large-scale enterprises which came to characterize the industrialized eastern half of the region, such as the [[Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company]] (marketer of the coal branded \"Old Company's Lehigh\"), the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]], and the [[Bethlehem Iron Company]] (later known as Bethlehem Steel) were founded by English speaking residents from the Philadelphia and New York areas. The English-speakers (referred to by the Dutch as simply \"the English\") dominated the managerial and engineering positions of these companies, and the Dutch supplied the blue collar and supervisory workforce.\n\nAs technology advanced during the late 19th century, higher technology companies such as Mack Truck and New Jersey Zinc moved to the region as well. As the local industries expanded, immigrants from Middle Europe (primarily Slovakia, Poland, and Hungary) were recruited for the low-skilled positions, and the more established Dutch retained the skilled blue collar and supervisory positions. The Dutch influence on the shop floor was so great that some Slavic immigrants became bilingual in their native language and in Pennsylvania Dutch while they had not yet mastered English.\n\n==Today==\n[[File:Flickr - Nicholas T - Barn Style (2).jpg|thumb|Barn with [[Hex sign]]s in Pennsylvania Dutch Country in Berks County]]\nIn the 20th century, however, universal public education in English and relatively easy access to higher education erased many of the elements that made the Pennsylvania Dutch Country a distinctive region of the United States.  The information age and globalization greatly reduced the dependence of the region on industrial jobs.  The Eastern part of the region (Northampton, Lehigh, and Berks Counties) is now dominated by information-intensive white collar employment.\n\nThe western counties of the region experienced industrialization as well, with Hershey Foods being the most notable example, but it was less intensive, and agriculture retained a larger share of the economy.   In the middle of the 20th century, both Amish and non-Amish entrepreneurs began to promote the area as a tourist destination. Though there are still plenty of Amish attempting to follow their traditional way of life, tourism and population growth have significantly changed the appearance and cultural flavor of the area. The region is within 50 miles of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], and [[Harrisburg|Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], and has not escaped the effects of being located on the western edge of the East Coast conurbation which stretches from [[Washington, D.C.]] to [[New York City]].\n\nThe [[Amish|Old Order Amish]] and [[Old Order Mennonites]], who have resisted these urbanization efforts most successfully, have retained aspects of their 18th century way of life, including the Deitsch dialect; however, these groups have changed significantly in the last two hundred years. Nevertheless, for the Old Order groups, change has come slower, and gradually they have become more and more distinctively different as the surrounding rural and urban population of Pennsylvania has changed.\n\n==See also==\n*[[West Nickel Mines School shooting]]\n*[[Witness (1985 film)|''Witness'' (1985 film)]]\n\n===Notable locations===\n*[[Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania]]\n*[[Blue Ball, Pennsylvania]]\n*[[Clinic for Special Children]]\n*[[Fertility, Pennsylvania|Fertility]]\n*[[Intercourse, Pennsylvania]]\n*[[Paradise, Pennsylvania]]\n*[[Ronks, Pennsylvania]]\n*[[Virginville, Pennsylvania|Virginville]]\n\n===Nearby attractions===\n*[[Crystal Cave (Pennsylvania)|Crystal Cave]] in Berks County\n*[[Dutch Wonderland]], an amusement park\n*[[Gettysburg National Military Park]] (nearby)\n*[[Hersheypark]]\n*[[Indian Echo Caverns]], [[Hummelstown, Pennsylvania|Hummelstown]]\n*[[Koziar's Christmas Village]]\n*[[Limestone Inn Bed and Breakfast]] listed in the National Register of Historic Places\n*[[Middletown and Hummelstown Railroad]]\n*[[Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania]]\n*[[Roadside America]] in [[Shartlesville, Pennsylvania|Shartlesville]]\n*[[Strasburg Rail Road]], a steam locomotive-driven heritage railway\n*[[Susquehannock State Park]]\n*[[Union Canal (Pennsylvania)|Union Canal Tunnel]], [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.padutchcountry.com/ Pennsylvania Dutch Convention & Visitors Bureau]\n*[http://www.hiwwe-wie-driwwe.de/ Hiwwe wie Driwwe - The Pennsylvania German Newspaper]\n\n{{Pennsylvania}}\n\n[[Category:Regions of Pennsylvania|Dutch Country]]\n[[Category:Pennsylvania culture|Dutch Country]]\n[[Category:Pennsylvania German culture]]\n[[Category:German-American history]]\n[[Category:German communities in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect-distinguish6|Dutchland|Deutschland||Dutchland (disambiguation)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2008}}\n{{infobox settlement\n|name=Pennsylvania Dutch Country\n|native_name=Deitscherei\n|settlement_type=Region of [[Pennsylvania]]\n|subdivision_type         = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_name         = {{flagu|United States|size=23px}}\n|subdivision_type1        = [[U.S. state|State]]\n|subdivision_name1        = {{flag|Pennsylvania|size=23px}}\n}}\n'''Pennsylvania Dutch Country''' ([[Pennsylvania German language|Deitsch]]: ''Deitscherei'') is an area of [[Southeastern Pennsylvania|Southeastern]] and [[South Central Pennsylvania|South Central]] [[Pennsylvania]] that by the [[American Revolution]] had a high percentage of [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] inhabitants.

The Pennsylvania seminaries educated them in High German so that they could preach to their flocks in a scholarly way.\n\nThe advent of the industrial revolution brought technologies based on coal, iron, canals, and railroads, but the Dutch, unversed in English, and lacking connections to the English-speaking establishment, were unable to engage in entrepreneurship on a large scale. Consequently, the large-scale enterprises which came to characterize the industrialized eastern half of the region, such as the [[Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company]] (marketer of the coal branded \"Old Company's Lehigh\"), the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]], and the [[Bethlehem Iron Company]] (later known as Bethlehem Steel) were founded by English speaking residents from the Philadelphia and New York areas. The English-speakers (referred to by the Dutch as simply \"the English\") dominated the managerial and engineering positions of these companies, and the Dutch supplied the blue collar and supervisory workforce.\n\nAs technology advanced during the late 19th century, higher technology companies such as Mack Truck and New Jersey Zinc moved to the region as well. As the local industries expanded, immigrants from Middle Europe (primarily Slovakia, Poland, and Hungary) were recruited for the low-skilled positions, and the more established Dutch retained the skilled blue collar and supervisory positions. The Dutch influence on the shop floor was so great that some Slavic immigrants became bilingual in their native language and in Pennsylvania Dutch while they had not yet mastered English.\n\n==Today==\n[[File:Flickr - Nicholas T - Barn Style (2).jpg|thumb|Barn with [[Hex sign]]s in Pennsylvania Dutch Country in Berks County]]\nIn the 20th century, however, universal public education in English and relatively easy access to higher education erased many of the elements that made the Pennsylvania Dutch Country a distinctive region of the United States.  The information age and globalization greatly reduced the dependence of the region on industrial jobs.  The Eastern part of the region (Northampton, Lehigh, and Berks Counties) is now dominated by information-intensive white collar employment.\n\nThe western counties of the region experienced industrialization as well, with Hershey Foods being the most notable example, but it was less intensive, and agriculture retained a larger share of the economy.   In the middle of the 20th century, both Amish and non-Amish entrepreneurs began to promote the area as a tourist destination. Though there are still plenty of Amish attempting to follow their traditional way of life, tourism and population growth have significantly changed the appearance and cultural flavor of the area. The region is within 50 miles of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], and [[Harrisburg|Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], and has not escaped the effects of being located on the western edge of the East Coast conurbation which stretches from [[Washington, D.C.]] to [[New York City]].\n\nThe [[Amish|Old Order Amish]] and [[Old Order Mennonites]], who have resisted these urbanization efforts most successfully, have retained aspects of their 18th century way of life, including the Deitsch dialect; however, these groups have changed significantly in the last two hundred years. Nevertheless, for the Old Order groups, change has come slower, and gradually they have become more and more distinctively different as the surrounding rural and urban population of Pennsylvania has changed.\n\n==See also==\n*[[West Nickel Mines School shooting]]\n*[[Witness (1985 film)|''Witness'' (1985 film)]]\n\n===Notable locations===\n*[[Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania]]\n*[[Blue Ball, Pennsylvania]]\n*[[Clinic for Special Children]]\n*[[Fertility, Pennsylvania|Fertility]]\n*[[Intercourse, Pennsylvania]]\n*[[Paradise, Pennsylvania]]\n*[[Ronks, Pennsylvania]]\n*[[Virginville, Pennsylvania|Virginville]]\n\n===Nearby attractions===\n*[[Crystal Cave (Pennsylvania)|Crystal Cave]] in Berks County\n*[[Dutch Wonderland]], an amusement park\n*[[Gettysburg National Military Park]] (nearby)\n*[[Hersheypark]]\n*[[Indian Echo Caverns]], [[Hummelstown, Pennsylvania|Hummelstown]]\n*[[Koziar's Christmas Village]]\n*[[Limestone Inn Bed and Breakfast]] listed in the National Register of Historic Places\n*[[Middletown and Hummelstown Railroad]]\n*[[Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania]]\n*[[Roadside America]] in [[Shartlesville, Pennsylvania|Shartlesville]]\n*[[Strasburg Rail Road]], a steam locomotive-driven heritage railway\n*[[Susquehannock State Park]]\n*[[Union Canal (Pennsylvania)|Union Canal Tunnel]], [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.padutchcountry.com/ Pennsylvania Dutch Convention & Visitors Bureau]\n*[http://www.hiwwe-wie-driwwe.de/ Hiwwe wie Driwwe - The Pennsylvania German Newspaper]\n\n{{Pennsylvania}}\n[[Category:Regions of Pennsylvania|Dutch Country]]\n[[Category:Pennsylvania culture|Dutch Country]]\n[[Category:Pennsylvania German culture]]\n[[Category:German-American history]]\n[[Category:German communities in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo/generalfixes, replaced: strengthend \u2192 strengthened", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Dutch_Country"}

The word ''Dutch'' refers to the [[German people|German]] settlers, known [[endonym]]ically as ''Deitsch'' (in the principal [[dialect]] they spoke, [[Palatine German language|Palatine German]]) or ''Deutsch'' (in standard [[German language|German]]); it does not refer to [[Dutch people|people from the Netherlands]]. Most Pennsylvania Dutch emigrated in the 17th and 18th centuries to the Americas from within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which included areas that were later to become Germany and Switzerland and Austria. Over time, the various dialects spoken by these immigrants fused into a unique dialect of German known as  [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]] or Pennsylvania Dutch.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Dutch maintained numerous religious affiliations, with the greatest number being [[United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany|Lutheran]] or [[Evangelical and Reformed Church|German Reformed]], but also with many [[Anabaptist]]s, including [[Mennonites]], [[Amish]], and [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Brethren]]. The Anabaptist religions promoted a simple life-style, and their adherents were known as [[Plain people]] or Plain Dutch. This was in contrast to the [[Fancy Dutch]], who tended to assimilate more easily into the American mainstream. Other religions were also represented by the late 1700s, in smaller numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://journals.psu.edu/phj/article/download/25670/25439|title=Pennsylvania's Crazy Quilt of German Religious Groups|author=Donald F.

The [[Nine Years' War|War of the Palatinate]] (as it was called in Germany), also called the [[Nine Years' War|War of the League of Augsburg]], began in 1688 as [[Louis XIV]] laid claim to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]. French forces devastated all major cities of the region, including [[Cologne]]. By 1697 the war came to a close with the [[Treaty of Ryswick]], now Rijswijk in the Netherlands, and the Palatinate remained free of French control. However, by 1702, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began, lasting until 1713.

The word ''Dutch'' refers to the [[German people|German]] settlers, known [[endonym]]ically as ''Deitsch'' (in the principal [[dialect]] they spoke, [[Palatine German language|Palatine German]]) or ''Deutsch'' (in standard [[German language|German]]); it does not refer to [[Dutch people|people from the Netherlands]]. Most Pennsylvania Dutch emigrated in the 17th and 18th centuries to the Americas from within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which included areas that were later to become Germany and Switzerland and Austria. Over time, the various dialects spoken by these immigrants fused into a unique dialect of German known as  [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]] or Pennsylvania Dutch.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Dutch maintained numerous religious affiliations, with the greatest number being [[United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany|Lutheran]] or [[Evangelical and Reformed Church|German Reformed]], but also with many [[Anabaptist]]s, including [[Mennonites]], [[Amish]], and [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Brethren]]. The Anabaptist religions promoted a simple life-style, and their adherents were known as [[Plain people]] or Plain Dutch. This was in contrast to the [[Fancy Dutch]], who tended to assimilate more easily into the American mainstream. Other religions were also represented by the late 1700s, in smaller numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://journals.psu.edu/phj/article/download/25670/25439|title=Pennsylvania's Crazy Quilt of German Religious Groups|author=Donald F.

During the [[Nine Years' War|War of the Grand Alliance]] (1689\u201397), French troops pillaged the Palatinate, forcing many Germans to flee.  The [[Nine Years' War|War of the Palatinate]] (as it was called in Germany), also called the [[Nine Years' War|War of the League of Augsburg]], began in 1688 as [[Louis XIV]] laid claim to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]. French forces devastated all major cities of the region, including [[Cologne]]. By 1697 the war came to a close with the [[Treaty of Ryswick]], now Rijswijk in the Netherlands, and the Palatinate remained free of French control. However, by 1702, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began, lasting until 1713.

He played the majority of his club football outside Australia, most notably with [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]] in Germany for ten years. He played 18 times for Australia, winning the [[OFC Nations Cup]] of the year 2000.\n\nAgostino attended Findon High School in his hometown of [[Adelaide]]. In 2011, he returned to Munich, where his wife Monika was born, with a view to settle there permanently. There he has since partnered with his former 1860 teammate [[Roman T\u00fdce]] and opened a soccer school called MunichSoccerCamp.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dieblaue24.com/2011/08/25/maurer-wird-nur-ein-groser-1860-trainer-wenn-er-aufsteigt/ | title = <nowiki>\u201cMaurer wird nur ein gro\u00dfer 1860-Trainer, wenn er aufsteigt\u201d</nowiki> | language = German | publisher = dieblaue24.de | date = 25 August 2011 | accessdate = 10 January 2013 | first = Oliver | last = Griss}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.munichsoccercamp.de/ | title = msc | language = German | publisher = munichsoccercamp.de | accessdate = 9 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\nBorn in [[Adelaide]], Australia, Agostino started his club career at [[Salisbury United]]. He on to the national scene in 1991 in his first season at senior level with [[West Adelaide SC]] in the [[National Soccer League|NSL]]. It was at this time that \"Aga\" was picked in the Australian World Youth Championships squad \u2013 a squad which contained the likes of [[Paul Okon]] and [[Mark Bosnich]] during one of Australia's 'Golden Generations' \u2013 which made the semi-finals of that competition.\n\n===Overseas===\nAgostino left for Europe in 1992 and headed for Switzerland, where he signed with [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]]. Agostino stayed in [[Bern]] for two seasons which was invaluable in enabling him to adapt to European life and football. It was in Switzerland that he learnt to speak German which would later help his move to Germany in 1997. He then had a short stint with Yverdon before making the move to England. Agostino signed with [[Bristol City]] in 1995 and it was in his second season with Bristol City that he began to score more regularly, bagging 16 goals in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] (the third tier of English club football).\n\nAfter two productive seasons in [[Bristol]], Agostino's growing reputation caught the eye of German [[Bundesliga]] side 1860 Munich. He was signed by the club in 1997 at the age of 22. Agostino stayed with the [[Munich]] club for a full decade, enduring spells both in and out of the side. Agostino played at the highest level while in Munich, representing 1860 in both the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. He enjoyed his best form for 1860 in the 2000\u201301 season, scoring 12 goals for the light blues, while Agostino regularly featured in the first team from 1999 to 2002. He fell down the pecking order at 1860 after this and typically played only a handful of games each season until it was revealed that he would be leaving the club on amicable terms at the end of the [[2006\u201307 2. Bundesliga]] season.\n\n===Adelaide United===\nIt was announced in February 2007 that [[A-League]] team [[Adelaide United FC|Adelaide United]] had agreed on a two-year contract with Agostino which saw the striker return to his home city for the first time in 15 years. It was announced on 30 December 2008 that Agostino would retire at the end of the 2008\u201309 season.\n\n==International career==\nAgostino debuted in 1996 in a match against Chile for the \"[[Australia national association football team|Socceroos]],\" the Australian national team. In 2005, he played versus South Africa for the 18th and last time for his country. In his 18 full international matches he scored seven goals. In 1999, he also played twice against the Brazilian \"B\" team, scoring two goals. In 1996, he was part of the Australian squad for the Olympics in Atlanta, but he was not used in Australia's three matches there.\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n===Club===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League<sup>1</sup>\n!colspan=\"2\"|Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|International<sup>2</sup>\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!rowspan=\"2\"|{{Tooltip|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n!Division||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals\n|-\n|[[West Adelaide SC|West Adelaide]]\n|[[1991\u201392 National Soccer League|1991\u201392]]\n|[[National Soccer League]]\n|17||6||?||?||0||0||17||6\n|<ref name=\"nft\">{{NFT|417}}</ref>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]]\n|[[1992\u201393 Nationalliga A|1992\u201393]]\n|[[Nationalliga A]]\n|12||2||?||?||?||?||12||2\n|<ref name=\"wf\">{{cite web |title=Paul Agostino \u00bb Club matches |url=https://www.worldfootball.net/player_summary/paul-agostino/2/ |website=worldfootball.net |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[1993\u201394 Nationalliga A|1993\u201394]]\n|Nationalliga A\n|14||1||?||?||?||?||14||1\n|<ref name=\"wf\"/>\n|-\n|[[1994\u201395 Nationalliga A|1994\u201395]]\n|Nationalliga A\n|3||0||?||?||0||0||3||0\n|<ref name=\"wf\"/>\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!29!!3!!!!!!!!!!29!!3\n!\u2013\n|-\n|[[Yverdon-Sport FC|Yverdon Sport]]\n|[[1994\u201395 Nationalliga A|1994\u201395]]\n|Nationalliga A\n|9||3||?||?||0||0||9||3\n|<ref name=\"wf\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]\n|[[1995\u201396 Football League|1995\u201396]]\n|[[Football League Second Division]]\n|40||10||||||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||40||10\n|<ref name=\"nft\"/>\n|-\n|[[1996\u201397 Football League|1996\u201397]]\n|Football League Second Division\n|45||9||7||6||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||52||15\n|<ref>{{Soccerbase season|40|1996}}</ref>\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!85!!19!!7!!6!!0!!0!!92!!25\n!\u2013\n|-\n|rowspan=\"11\"|[[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]]\n|[[1997\u201398 Bundesliga|1997\u201398]]\n|[[Bundesliga]]\n|16||4||1||0||1||0||18||4\n|<ref name=\"kicker\">{{cite web |title=Paul Agostino |url=https://www.kicker.de/paul-agostino-1616/spieler |website=kicker |accessdate=9 April 2020 |language=German}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[1998\u201399 Bundesliga|1998\u201399]]\n|Bundesliga\n|13||2||0||0||0||0||13||2\n|<ref name=\"kicker\"/>\n|-\n|[[1999\u20132000 Bundesliga|1999\u201300]]\n|Bundesliga\n|22||8||0||0||0||0||22||8\n|<ref name=\"kicker\"/>\n|-\n|[[2000\u201301 Bundesliga|2000\u201301]]\n|Bundesliga\n|27||12||0||0||7||2||34||14\n|<ref name=\"kicker\"/>\n|-\n|[[2001\u201302 Bundesliga|2001\u201302]]\n|Bundesliga\n|29||8||1||0||2||1||32||9\n|<ref name=\"kicker\"/>\n|-\n|[[2002\u201303 Bundesliga|2002\u201303]]\n|Bundesliga\n|32||11||0||0||2||0||34||11\n|<ref name=\"kicker\"/>\n|-\n|[[2003\u201304 Bundesliga|2003\u201304]]\n|Bundesliga\n|28||9||2||0||0||0||30||9\n|<ref name=\"kicker\"/>\n|-\n|[[2004\u201305 2.

He played the majority of his club football outside Australia, most notably with [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]] in Germany for ten years. He played 18 times for Australia, winning the [[OFC Nations Cup]] of the year 2000.\n\nAgostino attended Findon High School in his hometown of [[Adelaide]]. In 2011, he returned to Munich, where his wife Monika was born, with a view to settle there permanently. There he has since partnered with his former 1860 teammate [[Roman T\u00fdce]] and opened a soccer school called MunichSoccerCamp.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dieblaue24.com/2011/08/25/maurer-wird-nur-ein-groser-1860-trainer-wenn-er-aufsteigt/ | title = <nowiki>\u201cMaurer wird nur ein gro\u00dfer 1860-Trainer, wenn er aufsteigt\u201d</nowiki> | language = German | publisher = dieblaue24.de | date = 25 August 2011 | accessdate = 10 January 2013 | first = Oliver | last = Griss}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.munichsoccercamp.de/ | title = msc | language = German | publisher = munichsoccercamp.de | accessdate = 9 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\nBorn in [[Adelaide]], Australia, Agostino started his club career at [[Salisbury United]]. He on to the national scene in 1991 in his first season at senior level with [[West Adelaide SC]] in the [[National Soccer League|NSL]]. It was at this time that \"Aga\" was picked in the Australian World Youth Championships squad \u2013 a squad which contained the likes of [[Paul Okon]] and [[Mark Bosnich]] during one of Australia's 'Golden Generations' \u2013 which made the semi-finals of that competition.\n\n===Overseas===\nAgostino left for Europe in 1992 and headed for Switzerland, where he signed with [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]]. Agostino stayed in [[Bern]] for two seasons which was invaluable in enabling him to adapt to European life and football. It was in Switzerland that he learnt to speak German which would later help his move to Germany in 1997. He then had a short stint with Yverdon before making the move to England. Agostino signed with [[Bristol City]] in 1995 and it was in his second season with Bristol City that he began to score more regularly, bagging 16 goals in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] (the third tier of English club football).\n\nAfter two productive seasons in [[Bristol]], Agostino's growing reputation caught the eye of German [[Bundesliga]] side 1860 Munich. He was signed by the club in 1997 at the age of 22. Agostino stayed with the [[Munich]] club for a full decade, enduring spells both in and out of the side. Agostino played at the highest level while in Munich, representing 1860 in both the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. He enjoyed his best form for 1860 in the 2000\u201301 season, scoring 12 goals for the light blues, while Agostino regularly featured in the first team from 1999 to 2002. He fell down the pecking order at 1860 after this and typically played only a handful of games each season until it was revealed that he would be leaving the club on amicable terms at the end of the [[2006\u201307 2. Bundesliga]] season.\n\n===Adelaide United===\nIt was announced in February 2007 that [[A-League]] team [[Adelaide United FC|Adelaide United]] had agreed on a two-year contract with Agostino which saw the striker return to his home city for the first time in 15 years. It was announced on 30 December 2008 that Agostino would retire at the end of the 2008\u201309 season.\n\n==International career==\nAgostino debuted in 1996 in a match against Chile for the \"[[Australia national association football team|Socceroos]],\" the Australian national team. In 2005, he played versus South Africa for the 18th and last time for his country. In his 18 full international matches he scored seven goals. In 1999, he also played twice against the Brazilian \"B\" team, scoring two goals. In 1996, he was part of the Australian squad for the Olympics in Atlanta, but he was not used in Australia's three matches there.\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n===Club===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League<sup>1</sup>\n!colspan=\"2\"|Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|International<sup>2</sup>\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!rowspan=\"2\"|{{Tooltip|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n!Division||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals\n|-\n|[[West Adelaide SC|West Adelaide]]\n|[[1991\u201392 National Soccer League|1991\u201392]]\n|[[National Soccer League]]\n|17||6||?||?||0||0||17||6\n|<ref name=\"nft\">{{NFT|417}}</ref>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]]\n|[[1992\u201393 Nationalliga A|1992\u201393]]\n|[[Nationalliga A]]\n|12||2||?||?||?||?||12||2\n|<ref name=\"wf\">{{cite web |title=Paul Agostino \u00bb Club matches |url=https://www.worldfootball.net/player_summary/paul-agostino/2/ |website=worldfootball.net |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[1993\u201394 Nationalliga A|1993\u201394]]\n|Nationalliga A\n|14||1||?||?||?||?||14||1\n|<ref name=\"wf\"/>\n|-\n|[[1994\u201395 Nationalliga A|1994\u201395]]\n|Nationalliga A\n|3||0||?||?||0||0||3||0\n|<ref name=\"wf\"/>\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!29!!3!!!!!!!!!!29!!3\n!\u2013\n|-\n|[[Yverdon-Sport FC|Yverdon Sport]]\n|[[1994\u201395 Nationalliga A|1994\u201395]]\n|Nationalliga A\n|9||3||?||?||0||0||9||3\n|<ref name=\"wf\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]\n|[[1995\u201396 Football League|1995\u201396]]\n|[[Football League Second Division]]\n|40||10||||||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||40||10\n|<ref name=\"nft\"/>\n|-\n|[[1996\u201397 Football League|1996\u201397]]\n|Football League Second Division\n|45||9||7||6||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||52||15\n|<ref>{{Soccerbase season|40|1996}}</ref>\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!85!!19!!7!!6!!0!!0!!92!!25\n!\u2013\n|-\n|rowspan=\"11\"|[[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]]\n|[[1997\u201398 Bundesliga|1997\u201398]]\n|[[Bundesliga]]\n|16||4||1||0||1||0||18||4\n|<ref name=\"kicker\">{{cite web |title=Paul Agostino |url=https://www.kicker.de/paul-agostino-1616/spieler |website=kicker |accessdate=9 April 2020 |language=German}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[1998\u201399 Bundesliga|1998\u201399]]\n|Bundesliga\n|13||2||0||0||0||0||13||2\n|<ref name=\"kicker\"/>\n|-\n|[[1999\u20132000 Bundesliga|1999\u201300]]\n|Bundesliga\n|22||8||0||0||0||0||22||8\n|<ref name=\"kicker\"/>\n|-\n|[[2000\u201301 Bundesliga|2000\u201301]]\n|Bundesliga\n|27||12||0||0||7||2||34||14\n|<ref name=\"kicker\"/>\n|-\n|[[2001\u201302 Bundesliga|2001\u201302]]\n|Bundesliga\n|29||8||1||0||2||1||32||9\n|<ref name=\"kicker\"/>\n|-\n|[[2002\u201303 Bundesliga|2002\u201303]]\n|Bundesliga\n|32||11||0||0||2||0||34||11\n|<ref name=\"kicker\"/>\n|-\n|[[2003\u201304 Bundesliga|2003\u201304]]\n|Bundesliga\n|28||9||2||0||0||0||30||9\n|<ref name=\"kicker\"/>\n|-\n|[[2004\u201305 2.

The name comes from the Greek \"tragos\" (male goat). \nThe name might also derive from ilirian word \"Tregur\" (Three Stones). Similarly, the name of the  neighbouring island of Bua comes from the Greek \"voua\" (herd of cattle). The sudden prosperity of [[Salona]] deprived Trogir of its importance. During the migration of [[Croats]] the citizens of the destroyed Salona escaped to Trogir. Initially the Roman Tragurium was one of the [[Dalmatian City-States]]. From the 9th century on, Trogir paid tribute to [[Kings of Croatia|Croatian rulers]] and to the Byzantine empire. The [[diocese of Trogir]] was established in the 11th century (abolished in 1828; it is now part of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Split-Makarska]] and has temporarily been a Latin [[titular bishopric]]) and in 1107 it was chartered by the king of Hungary, Croatia and Dalmatia [[Coloman]], gaining thus its autonomy as a town.\n\nIn the year 1000 the [[Republic of Venice]] received submission from the Tragurium inhabitants and the city started since then to have commerce with the Italian peninsula enjoying cultural and economic improvements.\n\nIn 1123 Trogir was conquered and almost completely demolished by the [[Saracens]]. However, Trogir recovered in a short period to experience powerful economic prosperity in the 12th and the 13th centuries, with some autonomy under Venetian leadership. In 1242 King [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]] found refuge there as he fled the [[Mongols]]. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, members of the [[House of \u0160ubi\u0107|\u0160ubi\u0107 family]] were most frequently elected dukes by the citizens of Trogir; Mladen III (1348), according to the inscription on the sepulchral slab in the [[Cathedral of Trogir]] called \"the shield of the Croats\", was one of the most prominent \u0160ubi\u0107s. In [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]], the city was known as Tragur.\n\nAfter the [[War of Chioggia]] between Genoa and Venice, on 14 March 1381 [[Chioggia]] concluded an alliance with [[Zadar]] and Trogir against Venice, and finally Chioggia became better protected by Venice in 1412, because [[\u0160ibenik]] then became the seat of the main [[customs]] office and the seat of the salt consumers office with a [[monopoly]] on the salt trade in Chioggia and on the whole [[Adriatic Sea]].\n\nIn 1420 the period of a long-term [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule began and lasted nearly four centuries, when Trau (as the city was called by the Venetians) was one of the best cities in the Balkans with a rich economy and plenty of [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] works of art and architecture. In about 1650, a manuscript of the ancient Roman author Petronius' ''Satyricon'' was discovered in Trogir containing the 'Cena Trimalchionis' ('Dinner of Trimalchio') the longest surviving portion of the ''Satyricon'', a major discovery for Roman literature.<ref>Texts and Transmission \"Petronius\"</ref>\n\nOn the fall of Venice in 1797, Trogir became a part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], which ruled over the city until 1918, with the exception of Napoleon Bonaparte's [[France|French]] rule from 1806 to 1814 (when the city was part of the Napoleonic [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] and [[Illyrian Provinces]] ).\n \nAfter [[World War I]], Trogir, together with most part of [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]], became a part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and subsequently, the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. During this period Italian speakers, who until 1918 were the present in the city left for Italy. 1939 it become a part of [[Banovina of Croatia]]. During [[World War II]], Trogir was annexed by [[Italy]] and was part of the Italian [[Governorate of Dalmatia]] from 1941- 1943. After short partisan rule it became part of [[Independent State of Croatia]] under German military supervision from 1943 - 44. Subsequently, Tito's [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] liberated it in for second time 1944. After that it belonged to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|second Yugoslavia]], and since 1991 to [[Croatia]].\n\n==Main sights==\n{{Infobox UNESCO World Heritage Site\n| WHS         = Historic City of Trogir\n| Image       = View over Trogir - Croatia.jpg\n| image_size  = 300px\n| Criteria    = Cultural: ii, iv\n| ID          = 810\n| Year        = 1997\n| Area        = 6.4 ha\n| Buffer_zone = 4.8 ha\n}}\nTrogir has 2300 years of continuous urban tradition. Its culture was created under the influence of the ancient [[Greeks]], and then the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]]. Trogir has a high concentration of palaces, churches, and towers, as well as a fortress on a small island, and in 1997 was inscribed in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]]. \"The orthogonal street plan of this island settlement dates back to the [[Hellenistic]] period and it was embellished by successive rulers with many fine public and domestic buildings and fortifications. Its beautiful [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] churches are complemented by the outstanding [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] buildings from the Venetian period\", says the UNESCO report.\n\nTrogir is the best-preserved Romanesque-[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] complex not only in the Adriatic, but in all of [[Central Europe]]. Trogir's [[medieval]] core, surrounded by walls, comprises a preserved castle and tower and a series of dwellings and palaces from the Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque periods. Trogir's grandest building is the church of [[St. Lawrence]], whose main west portal is a masterpiece by [[Radovan (master)|Radovan]], and the most significant work of the Romanesque-Gothic style in Croatia.\n\nThe most important sites include:\n* Historical city core, with about 10 churches and numerous buildings from the 13th century\n* The city gate (17th century) and city walls  (15th century)\n* The [[Kamerlengo Castle|Fortress Kamerlengo]] (15th century)\n* The Duke's Palace (13th century)\n* [[Cathedral of St. Lawrence, Trogir|The Cathedral]] (13th century) with the Portal of [[Radovan (master)|Master Radovan]], the unique work of this Dalmatian artist\n* The big and small palaces Cipiko from the 15th century\n* The city loggia from 15th century\n\nThe St. Peter Church was part of the women's [[Benedictine]] [[monastery]] which was, according to the legend, founded by the wife of king [[Bela IV of Hungary]]. The west front of the church is embellished by a [[Baroque]] portal decorated with a [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] of St. Peter, the work of Niccolo di Giovanni Fiorentino. The interior was restored in a Baroque style in the second half of the 17th century. The wooden ceiling dating from that period is divided into oval, semioval and hexagon fields, framed by richly decorated borders. It was then that the two side-altars were added, dedicated to Mother Mary and St. Ignatius of Loyola. The high altar from the same period was made of wood, but only the statues of St. Peter and St. Paul have survived to the present day. Set into the pavement of the church one finds tombs of Trogir noble families Andreis and Cipiko.\n\nThe St. Sebastian's Church was built in 1476 as a votive church or an offering given by the citizens of Trogir in thanks for deliverance from the [[plague (disease)|plague]]. The front of this [[Renaissance]] building, which was executed by Niccolo di Giovanni Fiorentino, is decorated with the sculptures of St. Sebastian and Christ the Saviour. It displays the coats of arms of Bishop Giacomo Torlon and that of the duke Malipiero. Above the front rises the two-story [[tower]] of the town clock. A part of the eastern [[wall]] contains the remains of a centrally planned church with six apses dedicated to St. Mary. Against the west walls rests a [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] bearing names of the fallen defenders in the [[Croatian War for Independence]].\n\nThe Town Loggia of Trogir was first recorded in documents of the 13th century. It served as a furnished public gathering space, and on certain dates and hours it was used by the communal legal service, as a place were contracts were signed, official announcements made, laws proclaimed, and where law proceedings took place. In 1471, the workshop of Niccolo di Giovanni Fiorentino executed a relief of Justice on the eastern wall, depicting the Venetian lion with S. Lawrence and B. John of Trogir, both guardians of the city. It was, in fact, a monument dedicated to the Republic of Venice. The central field with the lion was removed in 1932. On the south wall, the relief of a horseman depicting [[Petar Berislavi\u0107]], viceroy of Croatia (1513\u20131520), was done by [[Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107]]. The Loggia was renovated in 1892.\n\nThe Garagnin-Fanfogna Palace is constituted of two blocks of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] buildings, incorporated into the ensemble in the second half of the 18th century, after the plans of Ignacije Macanovi\u0107. The two-story building with the stone stairway situated on the south side originally had an economy purpose. Today its ground floor houses the town ''lapidarium'' within which the city walls of the Hellenistic Tragurion are presented. On the first floor there is Cata Duj\u0161in-Ribar Gallery. The main entrance to the Palace with a lobby and a staircase was situated on the east side, in the main street, and decorated with a Late Baroque elements characteristic of the Macanovi\u0107 workshop. In the interior there is the original 18th century drawing room embellished with stucco decorations. The [[library]] owned by Ivan L. Garagnin (1722\u20131783), a numismatist and collector of archaeological monuments, is decorated with wall paintings portraying philosophers and writers. The ensemble houses collections of paintings and graphics from the 17th and 18th centuries and the Town Museum.\n\nThe Museum of sacred art is hosted in the Late Baroque building on the Trogir main [[square]], dating from the 18th century. There is a rich collection of early Dalmatian and Venetian sacred paintings (14th\u201315th century) with masterpieces of Gentile Bellini, Paolo Veneziano, Quirizio da Murano and others. Works of local masters, paintings of Bla\u017e Jurjev Trogiranin [Blase, son of George from Trogir] or the 13th century [[polyptych]] of the cathedral's high altar are exhibited in the Pinacotheca.\n\nThe ''Santa Maria de Platea'' belongs to the early 9th century hexafoil patern churches. It is the central type building, consisting of a high dome surrounded by six apses, in the manner of Carolingian chapels. In the 17th century visitation four altars were described: the high was dedicated to the Assumption of Mary; the Renaissance one, built in 1463 was dedicated to St. Jerome; the remaining two were dedicated to St. Mary of Loreto and St. Lucy respectively. The church was demolished in the mid 19th century, its only image is preserved on the 18th century [[French people|French]] illustrator Ch. L. Clerisseau's drawing. The apses had three niches divided by pilaster strips on the outside surface wheres niches and [[window]]s gave rhythm to the tambour of the dome. To the west there was a portico used as a medieval courtroom, street was closed by the city clock tower in the 15th century.\n\n==Economy==\n[[Tourism]] is the most important economic factor in the Trogir region, covering 50% of the municipal budget with more than 20,000 beds in hotels and private apartments. It is one of the fastest growing ports for sail-tourism in Croatia, and boasts two yacht marinas. There is also a strong [[fishing]] and [[agriculture]] tradition among the population in surrounding areas.\n\nThe most important industry is [[shipbuilding]], with shipyard \"Trogir\" established at the beginning of the 20th century.  The [[shipyard]] has a capacity of two ships of 55,000 tons. Between 1990 and 2004, 93 ships were built in the shipyard.\n\nTrogir has also been used as a location for several television productions; it notably featured in two 2010 episodes of the British TV series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. Due to its Venetian architecture, it served as a double for 16th-century [[Venice]] in ''[[The Vampires of Venice]]'', and as a double for 19th-century [[Provence]] in ''[[Vincent and the Doctor]]''. It also doubled for 19th century Venice in the 2015 BBC miniseries ''[[Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell (miniseries)|Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://filmingincroatia.hr/en/production_incentive/supported_productions/jonathan_strange_mr_norrell |title=Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell |website=Filming in Croatia |accessdate=19 October 2016}}</ref> and was used for scenes set in the city of [[Qarth]] in the [[HBO]] series ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boatinternational.com/destinations/game-of-thrones-filming-locations-to-visit-by-boat--31703 |title= Top 6 Game of Thrones filming locations to visit by boat |website=boatinternational.com |accessdate=19 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\nTrogir lies {{convert|6|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} from [[Split Airport]], and a regular bus connects Trogir with the airport and [[Split (city)|Split]].

The name comes from the Greek \"tragos\" (male goat). \nThe name might also derive from ilirian word \"Tregur\" (Three Stones). Similarly, the name of the  neighbouring island of Bua comes from the Greek \"voua\" (herd of cattle). The sudden prosperity of [[Salona]] deprived Trogir of its importance. During the migration of [[Croats]] the citizens of the destroyed Salona escaped to Trogir. Initially the Roman Tragurium was one of the [[Dalmatian City-States]]. From the 9th century on, Trogir paid tribute to [[Kings of Croatia|Croatian rulers]] and to the Byzantine empire. The [[diocese of Trogir]] was established in the 11th century (abolished in 1828; it is now part of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Split-Makarska]] and has temporarily been a Latin [[titular bishopric]]) and in 1107 it was chartered by the king of Hungary, Croatia and Dalmatia [[Coloman]], gaining thus its autonomy as a town.\n\nIn the year 1000 the [[Republic of Venice]] received submission from the Tragurium inhabitants and the city started since then to have commerce with the Italian peninsula enjoying cultural and economic improvements.\n\nIn 1123 Trogir was conquered and almost completely demolished by the [[Saracens]]. However, Trogir recovered in a short period to experience powerful economic prosperity in the 12th and the 13th centuries, with some autonomy under Venetian leadership. In 1242 King [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]] found refuge there as he fled the [[Mongols]]. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, members of the [[House of \u0160ubi\u0107|\u0160ubi\u0107 family]] were most frequently elected dukes by the citizens of Trogir; Mladen III (1348), according to the inscription on the sepulchral slab in the [[Cathedral of Trogir]] called \"the shield of the Croats\", was one of the most prominent \u0160ubi\u0107s. In [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]], the city was known as Tragur.\n\nAfter the [[War of Chioggia]] between Genoa and Venice, on 14 March 1381 [[Chioggia]] concluded an alliance with [[Zadar]] and Trogir against Venice, and finally Chioggia became better protected by Venice in 1412, because [[\u0160ibenik]] then became the seat of the main [[customs]] office and the seat of the salt consumers office with a [[monopoly]] on the salt trade in Chioggia and on the whole [[Adriatic Sea]].\n\nIn 1420 the period of a long-term [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule began and lasted nearly four centuries, when Trau (as the city was called by the Venetians) was one of the best cities in the Balkans with a rich economy and plenty of [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] works of art and architecture. In about 1650, a manuscript of the ancient Roman author Petronius' ''Satyricon'' was discovered in Trogir containing the 'Cena Trimalchionis' ('Dinner of Trimalchio') the longest surviving portion of the ''Satyricon'', a major discovery for Roman literature.<ref>Texts and Transmission \"Petronius\"</ref>\n\nOn the fall of Venice in 1797, Trogir became a part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], which ruled over the city until 1918, with the exception of Napoleon Bonaparte's [[France|French]] rule from 1806 to 1814 (when the city was part of the Napoleonic [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] and [[Illyrian Provinces]] ).\n \nAfter [[World War I]], Trogir, together with most part of [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]], became a part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and subsequently, the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. During this period Italian speakers, who until 1918 were the present in the city left for Italy. 1939 it become a part of [[Banovina of Croatia]]. During [[World War II]], Trogir was annexed by [[Italy]] and was part of the Italian [[Governorate of Dalmatia]] from 1941- 1943. After short partisan rule it became part of [[Independent State of Croatia]] under German military supervision from 1943 - 44. Subsequently, Tito's [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] liberated it in for second time 1944. After that it belonged to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|second Yugoslavia]], and since 1991 to [[Croatia]].\n\n==Main sights==\n{{Infobox UNESCO World Heritage Site\n| WHS         = Historic City of Trogir\n| Image       = View over Trogir - Croatia.jpg\n| image_size  = 300px\n| Criteria    = Cultural: ii, iv\n| ID          = 810\n| Year        = 1997\n| Area        = 6.4 ha\n| Buffer_zone = 4.8 ha\n}}\nTrogir has 2300 years of continuous urban tradition. Its culture was created under the influence of the ancient [[Greeks]], and then the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]]. Trogir has a high concentration of palaces, churches, and towers, as well as a fortress on a small island, and in 1997 was inscribed in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]]. \"The orthogonal street plan of this island settlement dates back to the [[Hellenistic]] period and it was embellished by successive rulers with many fine public and domestic buildings and fortifications. Its beautiful [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] churches are complemented by the outstanding [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] buildings from the Venetian period\", says the UNESCO report.\n\nTrogir is the best-preserved Romanesque-[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] complex not only in the Adriatic, but in all of [[Central Europe]]. Trogir's [[medieval]] core, surrounded by walls, comprises a preserved castle and tower and a series of dwellings and palaces from the Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque periods. Trogir's grandest building is the church of [[St. Lawrence]], whose main west portal is a masterpiece by [[Radovan (master)|Radovan]], and the most significant work of the Romanesque-Gothic style in Croatia.\n\nThe most important sites include:\n* Historical city core, with about 10 churches and numerous buildings from the 13th century\n* The city gate (17th century) and city walls  (15th century)\n* The [[Kamerlengo Castle|Fortress Kamerlengo]] (15th century)\n* The Duke's Palace (13th century)\n* [[Cathedral of St. Lawrence, Trogir|The Cathedral]] (13th century) with the Portal of [[Radovan (master)|Master Radovan]], the unique work of this Dalmatian artist\n* The big and small palaces Cipiko from the 15th century\n* The city loggia from 15th century\n\nThe St. Peter Church was part of the women's [[Benedictine]] [[monastery]] which was, according to the legend, founded by the wife of king [[Bela IV of Hungary]]. The west front of the church is embellished by a [[Baroque]] portal decorated with a [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] of St. Peter, the work of Niccolo di Giovanni Fiorentino. The interior was restored in a Baroque style in the second half of the 17th century. The wooden ceiling dating from that period is divided into oval, semioval and hexagon fields, framed by richly decorated borders. It was then that the two side-altars were added, dedicated to Mother Mary and St. Ignatius of Loyola. The high altar from the same period was made of wood, but only the statues of St. Peter and St. Paul have survived to the present day. Set into the pavement of the church one finds tombs of Trogir noble families Andreis and Cipiko.\n\nThe St. Sebastian's Church was built in 1476 as a votive church or an offering given by the citizens of Trogir in thanks for deliverance from the [[plague (disease)|plague]]. The front of this [[Renaissance]] building, which was executed by Niccolo di Giovanni Fiorentino, is decorated with the sculptures of St. Sebastian and Christ the Saviour. It displays the coats of arms of Bishop Giacomo Torlon and that of the duke Malipiero. Above the front rises the two-story [[tower]] of the town clock. A part of the eastern [[wall]] contains the remains of a centrally planned church with six apses dedicated to St. Mary. Against the west walls rests a [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] bearing names of the fallen defenders in the [[Croatian War for Independence]].\n\nThe Town Loggia of Trogir was first recorded in documents of the 13th century. It served as a furnished public gathering space, and on certain dates and hours it was used by the communal legal service, as a place were contracts were signed, official announcements made, laws proclaimed, and where law proceedings took place. In 1471, the workshop of Niccolo di Giovanni Fiorentino executed a relief of Justice on the eastern wall, depicting the Venetian lion with S. Lawrence and B. John of Trogir, both guardians of the city. It was, in fact, a monument dedicated to the Republic of Venice. The central field with the lion was removed in 1932. On the south wall, the relief of a horseman depicting [[Petar Berislavi\u0107]], viceroy of Croatia (1513\u20131520), was done by [[Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107]]. The Loggia was renovated in 1892.\n\nThe Garagnin-Fanfogna Palace is constituted of two blocks of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] buildings, incorporated into the ensemble in the second half of the 18th century, after the plans of Ignacije Macanovi\u0107. The two-story building with the stone stairway situated on the south side originally had an economy purpose. Today its ground floor houses the town ''lapidarium'' within which the city walls of the Hellenistic Tragurion are presented. On the first floor there is Cata Duj\u0161in-Ribar Gallery. The main entrance to the Palace with a lobby and a staircase was situated on the east side, in the main street, and decorated with a Late Baroque elements characteristic of the Macanovi\u0107 workshop. In the interior there is the original 18th century drawing room embellished with stucco decorations. The [[library]] owned by Ivan L. Garagnin (1722\u20131783), a numismatist and collector of archaeological monuments, is decorated with wall paintings portraying philosophers and writers. The ensemble houses collections of paintings and graphics from the 17th and 18th centuries and the Town Museum.\n\nThe Museum of sacred art is hosted in the Late Baroque building on the Trogir main [[square]], dating from the 18th century. There is a rich collection of early Dalmatian and Venetian sacred paintings (14th\u201315th century) with masterpieces of Gentile Bellini, Paolo Veneziano, Quirizio da Murano and others. Works of local masters, paintings of Bla\u017e Jurjev Trogiranin [Blase, son of George from Trogir] or the 13th century [[polyptych]] of the cathedral's high altar are exhibited in the Pinacotheca.\n\nThe ''Santa Maria de Platea'' belongs to the early 9th century hexafoil patern churches. It is the central type building, consisting of a high dome surrounded by six apses, in the manner of Carolingian chapels. In the 17th century visitation four altars were described: the high was dedicated to the Assumption of Mary; the Renaissance one, built in 1463 was dedicated to St. Jerome; the remaining two were dedicated to St. Mary of Loreto and St. Lucy respectively. The church was demolished in the mid 19th century, it's only image is preserved on the 18th century [[French people|French]] illustrator Ch. L. Clerisseau's drawing. The apses had three niches divided by pilaster strips on the outside surface wheres niches and [[window]]s gave rhythm to the tambour of the dome. To the west there was a portico used as a medieval courtroom, street was closed by the city clock tower in the 15th century.\n\n==Economy==\n[[Tourism]] is the most important economic factor in the Trogir region, covering 50% of the municipal budget with more than 20,000 beds in hotels and private apartments. It is one of the fastest growing ports for sail-tourism in Croatia, and boasts two yacht marinas. There is also a strong [[fishing]] and [[agriculture]] tradition among the population in surrounding areas.\n\nThe most important industry is [[shipbuilding]], with shipyard \"Trogir\" established at the beginning of the 20th century.  The [[shipyard]] has a capacity of two ships of 55,000 tons. Between 1990 and 2004, 93 ships were built in the shipyard.\n\nTrogir has also been used as a location for several television productions; it notably featured in two 2010 episodes of the British TV series ''[[Doctor Who]]''.

The etymology of the name came from ''Meru-Api''; from the ancient classical language of India Sanskrit and  [[Javanese language|Javanese]] combined words; ''[[Mount Meru (mythology)|Meru]]'' means \"mountain\", refers to mountain of Gods in Hinduism, and ''api'' means \"fire\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Geological history===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Uitbarsting van de Merapi in 1930 TMnr 10003995.jpg|thumb|Merapi in 1930]]\nMerapi is the youngest in a group of volcanoes in southern [[Java]]. It is situated at a [[subduction]] zone, where the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] is subducting under the [[Sunda Plate]]. It is one of at least 129 active volcanoes in Indonesia, part of the volcano is located in the Southeastern part of the Pacific Ring of Fire\u2013a section of fault lines stretching from the Western Hemisphere through Japan and South East Asia.<ref name=\"StraitsTimes\" /> Stratigraphic analysis reveals that eruptions in the Merapi area began about 400,000 years ago, and from then until about 10,000 years ago, eruptions were typically effusive, and the out flowing [[lava]] emitted was [[basalt]]ic. Since then, eruptions have become more explosive, with viscous [[andesite|andesitic]] lavas often generating [[lava dome]]s. Dome collapse has often generated [[pyroclastic flow]]s, and larger explosions, which have resulted in [[eruption column]]s, have also generated pyroclastic flows through column collapse.\n\nTypically, small eruptions occur every two to three years, and larger ones every 10\u201315 years or so. Notable eruptions, often causing many deaths, have occurred in 1006, 1786, 1822, 1872, and 1930. Thirteen villages were destroyed in the latter one, and 1,400 people were killed by pyroclastic flows.\n\nThe very large eruption in 1006 is claimed to have covered all of central Java with [[Volcanic ash|ash]]. The volcanic devastation is claimed to have led to the collapse of the [[Hindu]] [[Kingdom of Mataram]]; however, the  evidence from that era is insufficient for this to be substantiated.\n\n===2006 eruption===\nIn April 2006, increased [[seismicity]] at more regular intervals and a detected bulge in the volcano's cone indicated that fresh eruptions were imminent. Authorities put the volcano's neighboring villages on high alert and local residents prepared for a likely evacuation. On 19 April smoke from the crater reached a height of {{convert|400|m|ft}}, compared to {{convert|75|m|ft}} the previous day. On 23 April, after nine surface tremors and some 156 multifaced quakes signalled movements of magma, some 600 elderly and infant residents of the slopes were evacuated.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mg.co.za/articlepage.aspx?area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__international_news/&articleid=269888 | title = Mail & Guardian online | publisher = mg.co.za | date = 23 April 2006 | accessdate = 27 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy early May, active lava flows had begun.

The Geological Agency provided several recommendations including that there would be no community activities in the disaster prone areas and proclaimed an ongoing exclusion zone of {{convert|2.5|km}} radius.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://bnpb.go.id/irw/berita.asp?id=218 | title =Status Merapi turun ke level3| date = 12 March 2010 | work =| publisher =Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana | accessdate = 12 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n===2018 eruption===\n\nA [[phreatic eruption]] began on the morning of 11 May 2018, prompting the evacuation of areas within a {{convert|5|km|adj=mid}} radius of the volcano.

[[Seismology|Seismic]] monitoring began in 1924, with some of the volcano monitoring stations lasting until the present. The Babadan (northwest location), Selo (in the saddle between [[Mount Merbabu|Merbabu]] and Merapi), and [[Plawangan]] monitoring stations have been updated with equipment over the decades since establishment. During the 1950s and early 1960s some of the stations were starved of equipment and funds, but after the 1970s considerable improvement occurred with the supply of new equipment. Some of the pre-1930 observation posts were destroyed by the 1930 eruption, and newer posts were re-located. Similarly after the 1994 eruption, the Plawangan post and equipment were moved into [[Kaliurang]] as a response to the threat of danger to the volcanological personnel at the higher point. This volcano is monitored by the [[Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project]].\n\nThe eruption of 1930 was found to have been preceded by a large earthquake swarm. The network of 8 [[seismograph]]s currently around the volcano allow volcanologists to accurately pinpoint the [[hypocentre]]s of tremors and quakes.\n\nA zone in which no quakes originate is found about 1.5&nbsp;km below the summit, and is thought to be the location of the [[magma chamber|magma reservoir]] which feeds the eruptions.\n\nOther measurements taken on the volcano include [[magnetism|magnetic]] measurements and tilt measurements. Small changes in the local magnetic field have been found to coincide with eruptions, and tilt measurements reveal the inflation of the volcano caused when the magma chambers beneath it is filling up.\n\n[[Lahar]]s (a type of [[mudflow]] of pyroclastic material and water) are an important hazard on the mountain, and are caused by [[rain]] remobilizing pyroclastic flow deposits. Lahars can be detected seismically, as they cause a high-[[frequency]] seismic signal. Observations have found that about 50&nbsp;mm of rain per hour is the threshold above which lahars are often generated.\n\n==Sabo Dam==\nThere are about 90 units (30 percent) from the total 258 units of sand barriers (sabo) were damaged.

The constant smoke from its summit is said to come from two sacred armourers living under the mountain.]]\nMerapi is very important to [[Javanese people|Javanese]], especially those living around its crater. As such, there are many myths and beliefs attached to Merapi.\n\n===Creation===\nAlthough most nearby villages have their own myths about the creation of Mount Merapi, they have numerous commonalities.\nIt is believed that when the gods had just created the Earth, [[Java]] was unbalanced because of the placement of Mount Jamurdipo on the west end of the island. In order to assure balance, the gods (generally represented by [[Batara Guru]]) ordered the mountain to be moved to the centre of Java. However, two armourers, Empu Rama and Empu Permadi, were already forging a sacred [[keris]] at the site where Mount Jamurdipo was to be moved. The gods warned them that they would be moving a mountain there, and that they should leave; Empu Rama and Empu Permadi ignored that warning. In anger, the gods buried Empu Rama and Empu Permadi under Mount Jamurdipo; their spirits later became the rulers of all mystical beings in the area. In memory of them, Mount Jamurdipo was later renamed Mount Merapi, which means \"fire of Rama and Permadi.\"<ref name=\"Triyoga\">{{cite book |title= Merapi dan Orang Jawa: Persepsi dan Kepercayaannya| last=Triyoga |first=Lucas Sasongko |year=2010 |publisher=Gramedia Widiasarana Indonesia |location=Jakarta |language=Indonesian |isbn= |pages=50\u201352}}</ref>\n\n===Spirit ''Kraton'' of Merapi===\nThe Javanese believe that the Earth is not only populated by human beings, but also by spirits (''makhluk halus''). Villages near Merapi believe that one of the palaces (in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] ''[[Kraton (Indonesia)|kraton]]'') used by the rulers of the spirit kingdom lies inside Merapi, ruled by Empu Rama and Empu Permadi. This palace is said to be a spiritual counterpart to the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], complete with roads, soldiers, princes, vehicles, and domesticated animals.\nBesides the rulers, the palace is said to also be populated by the spirits of [[ancestor]]s who died as righteous people. The spirits of these ancestors are said to live in the palace as royal servants (''abdi dalem''), occasionally visiting their descendants in dreams to give [[Prophecy|prophecies]] or warnings. \"<ref name=\"Triyoga1\">{{cite book |title= Merapi dan Orang Jawa: Persepsi dan Kepercayaannya| last=Triyoga |first=Lucas Sasongko |year=2010 |publisher=Gramedia Widiasarana Indonesia |location=Jakarta |language=Indonesian |isbn= |pages=56\u201360}}</ref>\n\n===Spirits of Merapi===\nTo keep the volcano quiet and to appease the spirits of the mountain, the Javanese regularly bring offerings on the anniversary of the sultan of [[Yogyakarta]]'s coronation.<ref>{{cite book | publisher = Ministry of Culture and Tourism | title = Mount Tourism&nbsp;\u2013 Mount Merapi | year = 2008}}</ref> For [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], Merapi holds a significant cosmological symbolism, because it forms a sacred north-south axis line between Merapi peak and Southern Ocean ([[Indian Ocean]]).

The etymology of the name came from ''Meru-Api''; from the ancient classical language of India Sanskrit and  [[Javanese language|Javanese]] combined words; ''[[Mount Meru (mythology)|Meru]]'' means \"mountain\", refers to mountain of Gods in Hinduism, and ''api'' means \"fire\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Geological history===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Uitbarsting van de Merapi in 1930 TMnr 10003995.jpg|thumb|Merapi in 1930]]\nMerapi is the youngest in a group of volcanoes in southern [[Java]]. It is situated at a [[subduction]] zone, where the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] is subducting under the [[Sunda Plate]]. It is one of at least 129 active volcanoes in Indonesia, part of the volcano is located in the Southeastern part of the Pacific Ring of Fire\u2013a section of fault lines stretching from the Western Hemisphere through Japan and South East Asia.<ref name=\"StraitsTimes\" /> Stratigraphic analysis reveals that eruptions in the Merapi area began about 400,000 years ago, and from then until about 10,000 years ago, eruptions were typically effusive, and the out flowing [[lava]] emitted was [[basalt]]ic. Since then, eruptions have become more explosive, with viscous [[andesite|andesitic]] lavas often generating [[lava dome]]s. Dome collapse has often generated [[pyroclastic flow]]s, and larger explosions, which have resulted in [[eruption column]]s, have also generated pyroclastic flows through column collapse.\n\nTypically, small eruptions occur every two to three years, and larger ones every 10\u201315 years or so. Notable eruptions, often causing many deaths, have occurred in 1006, 1786, 1822, 1872, and 1930. Thirteen villages were destroyed in the latter one, and 1,400 people were killed by pyroclastic flows.\n\nThe very large eruption in 1006 is claimed to have covered all of central Java with [[Volcanic ash|ash]]. The volcanic devastation is claimed to have led to the collapse of the [[Hindu]] [[Kingdom of Mataram]]; however, the  evidence from that era is insufficient for this to be substantiated.\n\n===2006 eruption===\nIn April 2006, increased [[seismicity]] at more regular intervals and a detected bulge in the volcano's cone indicated that fresh eruptions were imminent. Authorities put the volcano's neighboring villages on high alert and local residents prepared for a likely evacuation.

[[Seismology|Seismic]] monitoring began in 1924, with some of the volcano monitoring stations lasting until the present. The Babadan (northwest location), Selo (in the saddle between [[Mount Merbabu|Merbabu]] and Merapi), and [[Plawangan]] monitoring stations have been updated with equipment over the decades since establishment. During the 1950s and early 1960s some of the stations were starved of equipment and funds, but after the 1970s considerable improvement occurred with the supply of new equipment. Some of the pre-1930 observation posts were destroyed by the 1930 eruption, and newer posts were re-located. Similarly after the 1994 eruption, the Plawangan post and equipment were moved into [[Kaliurang]] as a response to the threat of danger to the volcanological personnel at the higher point. This volcano is monitored by the [[Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project]].\n\nThe eruption of 1930 was found to have been preceded by a large earthquake swarm. The network of 8 [[seismograph]]s currently around the volcano allow volcanologists to accurately pinpoint the [[hypocentre]]s of tremors and quakes.\n\nA zone in which no quakes originate is found about 1.5&nbsp;km below the summit, and is thought to be the location of the [[magma chamber|magma reservoir]] which feeds the eruptions.\n\nOther measurements taken on the volcano include [[magnetism|magnetic]] measurements and tilt measurements. Small changes in the local magnetic field have been found to coincide with eruptions, and tilt measurements reveal the inflation of the volcano caused when the magma chambers beneath it is filling up.\n\n[[Lahar]]s (a type of [[mudflow]] of pyroclastic material and water) are an important hazard on the mountain, and are caused by [[rain]] remobilizing pyroclastic flow deposits. Lahars can be detected seismically, as they cause a high-[[frequency]] seismic signal. Observations have found that about 50&nbsp;mm of rain per hour is the threshold above which lahars are often generated.\n\n==Sabo Dam==\nThere are about 90 units (30 percent) from the total 258 units of sand barriers (sabo) were damaged.

The constant smoke from its summit is said to come from two sacred armourers living under the mountain.]]\nMerapi is very important to [[Javanese people|Javanese]], especially those living around its crater. As such, there are many myths and beliefs attached to Merapi.\n\n===Creation===\nAlthough most nearby villages have their own myths about the creation of Mount Merapi, they have numerous commonalities.\nIt is believed that when the gods had just created the Earth, [[Java]] was unbalanced because of the placement of Mount Jamurdipo on the west end of the island. In order to assure balance, the gods (generally represented by [[Batara Guru]]) ordered the mountain to be moved to the centre of Java. However, two armourers, Empu Rama and Empu Permadi, were already forging a sacred [[keris]] at the site where Mount Jamurdipo was to be moved. The gods warned them that they would be moving a mountain there, and that they should leave; Empu Rama and Empu Permadi ignored that warning. In anger, the gods buried Empu Rama and Empu Permadi under Mount Jamurdipo; their spirits later became the rulers of all mystical beings in the area. In memory of them, Mount Jamurdipo was later renamed Mount Merapi, which means \"fire of Rama and Permadi.\"<ref name=\"Triyoga\">{{cite book |title= Merapi dan Orang Jawa: Persepsi dan Kepercayaannya| last=Triyoga |first=Lucas Sasongko |year=2010 |publisher=Gramedia Widiasarana Indonesia |location=Jakarta |language=Indonesian |isbn= |pages=50\u201352}}</ref>\n\n===Spirit ''Kraton'' of Merapi===\nThe Javanese believe that the Earth is not only populated by human beings, but also by spirits (''makhluk halus''). Villages near Merapi believe that one of the palaces (in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] ''[[Kraton (Indonesia)|kraton]]'') used by the rulers of the spirit kingdom lies inside Merapi, ruled by Empu Rama and Empu Permadi. This palace is said to be a spiritual counterpart to the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], complete with roads, soldiers, princes, vehicles, and domesticated animals.\nBesides the rulers, the palace is said to also be populated by the spirits of [[ancestor]]s who died as righteous people. The spirits of these ancestors are said to live in the palace as royal servants (''abdi dalem''), occasionally visiting their descendants in dreams to give [[Prophecy|prophecies]] or warnings. \"<ref name=\"Triyoga1\">{{cite book |title= Merapi dan Orang Jawa: Persepsi dan Kepercayaannya| last=Triyoga |first=Lucas Sasongko |year=2010 |publisher=Gramedia Widiasarana Indonesia |location=Jakarta |language=Indonesian |isbn= |pages=56\u201360}}</ref>\n\n===Spirits of Merapi===\nTo keep the volcano quiet and to appease the spirits of the mountain, the Javanese regularly bring offerings on the anniversary of the sultan of [[Yogyakarta]]'s coronation.<ref>{{cite book | publisher = Ministry of Culture and Tourism | title = Mount Tourism&nbsp;\u2013 Mount Merapi | year = 2008}}</ref> For [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], Merapi holds a significant cosmological symbolism, because it forms a sacred north-south axis line between Merapi peak and Southern Ocean ([[Indian Ocean]]).

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.
