The story follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] as he attempts to restore the world after his nemesis [[Doctor Eggman]] shatters it with a powerful laser to unleash Dark Gaia, an ancient evil, while dealing with having become a \"Werehog\", a [[werewolf]]-esque transformation, which he gains after coming into contact with the energy of Dark Gaia. Gameplay features two distinct styles, with each being played either during daytime or nighttime. Daytime stages incorporate Sonic's traditional platforming and trademark speed, with a combination of behind-the-back third-person viewpoints and 2D side-scroller platforming; gameplay seamlessly transitions between these two views.<ref name=\"segauk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sega.co.uk/games/?g=230|title=Sega: Games: Sonic Unleashed|author=Sega UK|accessdate=June 25, 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102104738/http://www.sega.co.uk/games/?g=230|archivedate=November 2, 2014}}</ref> Night-time levels see Sonic transform into the Werehog; gameplay slows down to accommodate greater platform play, and involves combat against waves of enemies using the Werehog's brute strength.\n\nThe game's development began in 2006, after the creation of its [[game engine]], the Hedgehog Engine. It was initially conceived as a sequel to ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'', but developer [[Sonic Team]] began to introduce enough new innovations that separated it from previous games, and it was renamed ''Unleashed''. The Werehog gameplay was conceived to help introduce newer gamers unfamiliar with the ''Sonic'' franchise to the series. The game's existence was first brought to light when Sega trademarked the ''Unleashed'' name in March 2008, and shortly after, images and a gameplay video were [[internet leak|leaked]]. Three versions of the game were developed: one by Sonic Team for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]], one by Sonic Team and [[Dimps]] for the [[Wii]] and [[PlayStation 2]], and one by [[Gameloft]] for [[mobile phones]]. ''Sonic Unleashed'' was released in the west in November 2008, and in Japan the following month.\n\nPublic anticipation for ''Sonic Unleashed'' was high, as [[video game journalists]] saw it as a possible return to Sonic's platforming roots. While it was commercially successful\u2014selling 2.45 million units\u2014critical reception was mixed. Reviewers praised certain elements, such as the sense of speed in daylight stages and the graphics and audio that make up the environments, but criticized others, such as the Werehog game mechanic, as well as several gameplay and design concepts. Many felt ''Unleashed'' was not the game to reinvigorate the series.<ref name=\"review_1up\"/><ref name=\"review_eurog\">{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/sonic-unleashed-review | title = Sonic Unleashed Review | first = Dan | last = Whitehead | publisher = Eurogamer | accessdate = January 25, 2010 | date = November 27, 2008 | pages = 1\u20132 | quote = Sonic Unleashed is an obviously poor effort from a series that is still hopelessly lost in the modern gaming landscape. | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100120123754/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/sonic-unleashed-review | archivedate = January 20, 2010 }}</ref><ref name=\"review_vg\"/><ref name=\"review_telegraph\"/> ''Sonic Unleashed'' was delisted from retailers in 2010, following Sega's decision to remove all ''Sonic'' games with below-average [[Metacritic]] scores from sale.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/41217/Sub-standard-Sonics-de-listed|title=Sub-standard Sonics de-listed|publisher=[[MCV (magazine)|MCV]]|first=Christopher|last=Dring|date=October 7, 2010|accessdate=December 18, 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511064038/http://www.mcvuk.com/news/41217/Sub-standard-Sonics-de-listed|archivedate=May 11, 2011}}</ref> Despite this, the game was released on the [[PlayStation Network]] in April 2014 and on [[PlayStation Now]] in March 2017, and was also given Xbox One backwards compatibility on November 29, 2018.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sonic Unleashed 3D.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Third-person gameplay in daytime levels (Apotos, [[Xbox 360]]/[[PlayStation 3|PS3]] version)]]\n''Sonic Unleashed'' is a platform game in which the player controls the titular Sonic the Hedgehog in two modes: fast-paced levels that take place during daytime, showcasing and using Sonic's trademark speed as seen in previous games in the series, and slower, night-time levels, during which Sonic transforms into the Werehog, and gameplay switches to an action-based, brawler style of play, in which Sonic battles Gaia enemies (those created by the main enemy in the game, Dark Gaia).<ref name=\"review_tvg\">{{cite web | url = http://www.totalvideogames.com/Sonic-Unleashed/review-13490.html | title = Sonic Unleashed Review | publisher = TotalVideoGames.com | first = Chris | last = Leyton | accessdate = December 2, 2008 | date = December 1, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081203071942/http://www.totalvideogames.com/Sonic-Unleashed/review-13490.html | archivedate = December 3, 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"review_destructoid\">{{cite web | url = http://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-review-sonic-unleashed-112928.phtml | title = Destructoid review: Sonic Unleashed | first = Jim | last = Sterling | accessdate = December 2, 2008 | date = November 30, 2008 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202013739/http://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-review-sonic-unleashed-112928.phtml | archivedate = December 2, 2008 }}</ref> Each level takes place on a particular continent, each of which is based on a real-world location.<ref name=\"gamestm\"/> In sections of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game, the player may choose to advance the time of day in order to play as either Sonic or the Werehog; in the Wii and PlayStation 2 versions, time is advanced automatically.<ref name=\"review_eurog_wii\">{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=321416 | title = Sonic Unleashed Review - Wii | publisher = Eurogamer | first = Dan | last = Whitehead | date = November 29, 2008 | accessdate = December 1, 2008 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081201014915/http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=321416 | archivedate = December 1, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nDaytime levels focus on Sonic's speed, and to this extent, sees the player control Sonic through fast-moving stages containing both 2D and 3D styles of gameplay.<ref name=\"review_ign\" /> 2D sections are reminiscent of the [[Sega Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]]-era Sonic games, where the player controls Sonic in a [[side-scrolling]] fashion,<ref name=\"review_ign_aus\" /> while 3D sections see the camera placed behind Sonic, so the player may move in all directions.

traditional ''Sonic'' gameplay was a good beginning, it also had to consider how to introduce newer gamers unfamiliar with the ''Sonic'' franchise to the series, and so the concept of the Werehog was born, in addition to exploring its own mythology and ideas for the story.<ref name=\"blog_ign_11-03\" /> Director Yoshihisa Hashimoto felt from the outset that there would be both praise and criticism, but hoped that long-term ''Sonic'' fans would understand and empathise with the ideas and direction the team had taken.<ref name=\"blog_ign_11-03\" />\n\nIn terms of technology, Hashimoto remarked that the visual style was born out of desire to see a [[global illumination]] solution used for the game's lighting \u2014 that is, light reflecting from one object in the scene onto others.<ref name=\"blog_ign_11-03\"/> To this extent, development on the renderer for this process began, and the final solution allowed the developers to use [[distributed rendering]] over hundreds of computers to calculate lighting for each ten- to twenty-kilometer action stage in around two or three days.<ref name=\"blog_ign_11-03\" /> Characters, enemies and objects are then lit at run-time with Sonic Team's \"Light Field\" technology to blend them in with the surrounding pre-calculated lighting.<ref name=\"blog_ign_11-03\" /> Because the game was being developed for two levels of hardware capability depending on the target platform, two development \"silos\" were set up to work on two separate builds of the game: one for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version utilizing the

The story follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] as he attempts to restore the world after his nemesis [[Doctor Eggman]] shatters it with a powerful laser to unleash Dark Gaia, an ancient evil, while dealing with having become a \"Werehog\", a [[werewolf]]-esque transformation, which he gains after coming into contact with the energy of Dark Gaia. Gameplay features two distinct styles, with each being played either during daytime or nighttime. Daytime stages incorporate Sonic's traditional platforming and trademark speed, with a combination of behind-the-back third-person viewpoints and 2D side-scroller platforming; gameplay seamlessly transitions between these two views.<ref name=\"segauk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sega.co.uk/games/?g=230|title=Sega: Games: Sonic Unleashed|author=Sega UK|accessdate=June 25, 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102104738/http://www.sega.co.uk/games/?g=230|archivedate=November 2, 2014}}</ref> Night-time levels see Sonic transform into the Werehog; gameplay slows down to accommodate greater platform play, and involves combat against waves of enemies using the Werehog's brute strength.\n\nThe game's development began in 2006, after the creation of its [[game engine]], the Hedgehog Engine. It was initially conceived as a sequel to ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'', but developer [[Sonic Team]] began to introduce enough new innovations that separated it from previous games, and it was renamed ''Unleashed''. The Werehog gameplay was conceived to help introduce newer gamers unfamiliar with the ''Sonic'' franchise to the series. The game's existence was first brought to light when Sega trademarked the ''Unleashed'' name in March 2008, and shortly after, images and a gameplay video were [[internet leak|leaked]]. Three versions of the game were developed: one by Sonic Team for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]], one by Sonic Team and [[Dimps]] for the [[Wii]] and [[PlayStation 2]], and one by [[Gameloft]] for [[mobile phones]]. ''Sonic Unleashed'' was released in the west in November 2008, and in Japan the following month.\n\nPublic anticipation for ''Sonic Unleashed'' was high, as [[video game journalists]] saw it as a possible return to Sonic's platforming roots. While it was commercially successful\u2014selling 2.45 million units\u2014critical reception was mixed. Reviewers praised certain elements, such as the sense of speed in daylight stages and the graphics and audio that make up the environments, but criticized others, such as the Werehog game mechanic, as well as several gameplay and design concepts. Many felt ''Unleashed'' was not the game to reinvigorate the series.<ref name=\"review_1up\"/><ref name=\"review_eurog\">{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/sonic-unleashed-review | title = Sonic Unleashed Review | first = Dan | last = Whitehead | publisher = Eurogamer | accessdate = January 25, 2010 | date = November 27, 2008 | pages = 1\u20132 | quote = Sonic Unleashed is an obviously poor effort from a series that is still hopelessly lost in the modern gaming landscape. | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100120123754/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/sonic-unleashed-review | archivedate = January 20, 2010 }}</ref><ref name=\"review_vg\"/><ref name=\"review_telegraph\"/> ''Sonic Unleashed'' was delisted from retailers in 2010, following Sega's decision to remove all ''Sonic'' games with below-average [[Metacritic]] scores from sale.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/41217/Sub-standard-Sonics-de-listed|title=Sub-standard Sonics de-listed|publisher=[[MCV (magazine)|MCV]]|first=Christopher|last=Dring|date=October 7, 2010|accessdate=December 18, 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511064038/http://www.mcvuk.com/news/41217/Sub-standard-Sonics-de-listed|archivedate=May 11, 2011}}</ref> Despite this, the game was released on the [[PlayStation Network]] in April 2014 and on [[PlayStation Now]] in March 2017, and was also given Xbox One backwards compatibility on November 29, 2018.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sonic Unleashed 3D.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Third-person gameplay in daytime levels (Apotos, [[Xbox 360]]/[[PlayStation 3|PS3]] version)]]\n''Sonic Unleashed'' is a platform game in which the player controls the titular Sonic the Hedgehog in two modes: fast-paced levels that take place during daytime, showcasing and using Sonic's trademark speed as seen in previous games in the series, and slower, night-time levels, during which Sonic transforms into the Werehog, and gameplay switches to an action-based, brawler style of play, in which Sonic battles Gaia enemies (those created by the main enemy in the game, Dark Gaia).<ref name=\"review_tvg\">{{cite web | url = http://www.totalvideogames.com/Sonic-Unleashed/review-13490.html | title = Sonic Unleashed Review | publisher = TotalVideoGames.com | first = Chris | last = Leyton | accessdate = December 2, 2008 | date = December 1, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081203071942/http://www.totalvideogames.com/Sonic-Unleashed/review-13490.html | archivedate = December 3, 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"review_destructoid\">{{cite web | url = http://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-review-sonic-unleashed-112928.phtml | title = Destructoid review: Sonic Unleashed | first = Jim | last = Sterling | accessdate = December 2, 2008 | date = November 30, 2008 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202013739/http://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-review-sonic-unleashed-112928.phtml | archivedate = December 2, 2008 }}</ref> Each level takes place on a particular continent, each of which is based on a real-world location.<ref name=\"gamestm\"/> In sections of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game, the player may choose to advance the time of day in order to play as either Sonic or the Werehog; in the Wii and PlayStation 2 versions, time is advanced automatically.<ref name=\"review_eurog_wii\">{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=321416 | title = Sonic Unleashed Review - Wii | publisher = Eurogamer | first = Dan | last = Whitehead | date = November 29, 2008 | accessdate = December 1, 2008 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081201014915/http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=321416 | archivedate = December 1, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nDaytime levels focus on Sonic's speed, and to this extent, sees the player control Sonic through fast-moving stages containing both 2D and 3D styles of gameplay.<ref name=\"review_ign\" /> 2D sections are reminiscent of the [[Sega Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]]-era Sonic games, where the player controls Sonic in a [[side-scrolling]] fashion,<ref name=\"review_ign_aus\" /> while 3D sections see the camera placed behind Sonic, so the player may move in all directions.

traditional ''Sonic'' gameplay was a good beginning, it also had to consider how to introduce newer gamers unfamiliar with the ''Sonic'' franchise to the series, and so the concept of the Werehog was born, in addition to exploring its own mythology and ideas for the story.<ref name=\"blog_ign_11-03\" /> Director Yoshihisa Hashimoto felt from the outset that there would be both praise and criticism, but hoped that long-term ''Sonic'' fans would understand and empathise with the ideas and direction the team had taken.<ref name=\"blog_ign_11-03\" />\n\nIn terms of technology, Hashimoto remarked that the visual style was born out of desire to see a [[global illumination]] solution used for the game's lighting \u2014 that is, light reflecting from one object in the scene onto others.<ref name=\"blog_ign_11-03\"/> To this extent, development on the renderer for this process began, and the final solution allowed the developers to use [[distributed rendering]] over hundreds of computers to calculate lighting for each ten- to twenty-kilometer action stage in around two or three days.<ref name=\"blog_ign_11-03\" /> Characters, enemies and objects are then lit at run-time with Sonic Team's \"Light Field\" technology to blend them in with the surrounding pre-calculated lighting.<ref name=\"blog_ign_11-03\" /> Because the game was being developed for two levels of hardware capability depending on the target platform, two development \"silos\" were set up to work on two separate builds of the game: one for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version utilizing the

Members of its single [[species]] '''''Compsognathus longipes''''' could grow to around the size of a [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]. They lived about 150&nbsp;[[mya (unit)|million years ago]], during the [[Tithonian]] [[Stage (stratigraphy)|age]] of the late [[Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|period]], in what is now [[Europe]]. Paleontologists have found two well-preserved [[fossil]]s, one in Germany in the 1850s and the second in France more than a century later. Today, ''C. longipes'' is the only recognized species, although the larger specimen discovered in France in the 1970s was once thought to belong to a separate species and named ''C. corallestris''.\n\nMany presentations still describe ''Compsognathus'' as \"chicken-sized\" dinosaurs because of the size of the German specimen, which is now believed to be a juvenile. ''Compsognathus longipes'' is one of the few dinosaur species whose diet is known with certainty: the remains of small, agile lizards are preserved in the bellies of both specimens. Teeth discovered in Portugal may be further fossil remains of the genus.\n\nAlthough not recognized as such at the time of its discovery, ''Compsognathus'' is the first theropod dinosaur known from a reasonably complete fossil skeleton. Until the 1990s, it was the smallest-known non-[[Avialae|avialan]] dinosaur, with the preceding centuries incorrectly labelling them as the closest relative of ''[[Archaeopteryx]]''.\n\n''Compsognathus'' was the first dinosaur genus to be portrayed with feathers, by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in 1876.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Compysizes1.png|thumb|left|Size comparison of the French (orange) and German (green) specimens, with a human]]\nFor decades, ''Compsognathus'' were famed as the smallest dinosaurs known; the first specimen collected was around {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in length.

Members of its single [[species]] '''''Compsognathus longipes''''' could grow to around the size of a [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]. They lived about 150&nbsp;[[mya (unit)|million years ago]], during the [[Tithonian]] [[Stage (stratigraphy)|age]] of the late [[Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|period]], in what is now [[Europe]]. Paleontologists have found two well-preserved [[fossil]]s, one in Germany in the 1850s and the second in France more than a century later. Today, ''C. longipes'' is the only recognized species, although the larger specimen discovered in France in the 1970s was once thought to belong to a separate species and named ''C. corallestris''.\n\nMany presentations still describe ''Compsognathus'' as \"chicken-sized\" dinosaurs because of the size of the German specimen, which is now believed to be a juvenile. ''Compsognathus longipes'' is one of the few dinosaur species whose diet is known with certainty: the remains of small, agile lizards are preserved in the bellies of both specimens. Teeth discovered in Portugal may be further fossil remains of the genus.\n\nAlthough not recognized as such at the time of its discovery, ''Compsognathus'' is the first theropod dinosaur known from a reasonably complete fossil skeleton. Until the 1990s, it was the smallest-known non-[[Avialae|avialan]] dinosaur, with the preceding centuries incorrectly labelling them as the closest relative of ''[[Archaeopteryx]]''.\n\n''Compsognathus'' was the first dinosaur genus to be portrayed with feathers, by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in 1876.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Compysizes1.png|thumb|left|Size comparison of the French (orange) and German (green) specimens, with a human]]\nFor decades, ''Compsognathus'' were famed as the smallest dinosaurs known; the first specimen collected was around {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in length.

The same sediments in which ''Compsognathus'' have been preserved also contain fossils of a number of marine animals such as fish, crustaceans, echinoderms and marine mollusks, confirming the coastal habitat of this theropod. No other dinosaur has been found in association with ''Compsognathus'', indicating that these little dinosaurs might in fact have been the top land predator in these islands.<ref name=weishampel04>Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., Oslmolska, H.
