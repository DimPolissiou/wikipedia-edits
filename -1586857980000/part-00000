Tensions grew in Wilmington and other areas because of a shortage of supplies; Confederate currency had no value and the South was impoverished at the end of the long war.\n\nIn 1868, North Carolina ratified the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], resulting in the recognition of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], and in the state legislature and governorship falling under Republican rule.

Many white Democrats had been embittered since the Confederacy's defeat. Insurgent veterans joined the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK), which orchestrated considerable violence at elections in order to suppress the black vote.\n\nDemocrats regained control of the state legislature in 1870. After the KKK was suppressed by the federal government through the [[Force Act of 1870]], new [[paramilitary]] groups arose in the South. By 1874, chapters of [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], a [[paramilitary]] arm of the Democratic Party, had formed in North Carolina.\n\nDemocrats developed a plan to reverse \"home rule,\" meaning local officials would no longer be elected, but appointed by the state.  They began circumventing legislation by taking over the state's judiciary, and adopted 30 amendments to the state constitution including lowering the number of judges on the state supreme court, putting the lower courts and local governments under the control of the state legislature, rescinding the votes of certain types of criminals, mandating segregated public schools, outlawing interracial relationships and granting the General Assembly the power to modify or nullify any local government.<ref name=NCPedia/> By adopting these things, the Democrats became identified as would-be bastions for white Americans.<ref name=NCPedia/>  However, their control was largely limited to the western part of the state, within counties where, demographically, there were few blacks.<ref name=NCPedia/>\n\nAs the Democrats chipped away at Republican rule, things came to a head with the 1876 gubernatorial campaign of [[Zebulon Baird Vance|Zebulon B. Vance]], a former Confederate soldier and governor.  Vance called the Republican party \"begotten by a scalawag out of a mulatto and born in an outhouse.\"  Through Vance, the Democrats saw their biggest opening to begin implementing their agenda in the eastern part of the state.<ref name=NNC>{{cite book|last=Avedis Logan|first=Frenise A.|title=The Negro in North Carolina, 1876-1894|url=https://www.ncpedia.org/government/convention-1875|pages=8\u201310|year=1964|publisher=University of North Carolina Press}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in that region, poor white cotton farmers, fed up with the capitalism of big banks and railroad companies \u2013 high freight rates and [[Laissez-faire|laissez-faire economics]] \u2013 aligned themselves with the labor movement.

In other words, the Negro in Wilmington has progressed in very slight degree from the time when he was a slave. His condition can be summed up in a line.

They are thirty percent of the population. After thirty years of opportunity, they have three percent of the property. True, they may claim that this is all net gain as they started with no property. But they did not start with nothing. They started with enormous advantages over whites. They were accustomed to labor. The whites were not. They had been for generations the producers of the State and the whites the consumers. They were accustomed to hardship and privation and patient industry. They had the muscle.

They also began trying to dismantle the Democratic stronghold in the less-populated western part of the state, that allowed the Democrats more political power through gerrymandering.<ref name=Betrayed2/>  And, they encouraged blacks to vote, which was an estimated 120,000 Republican sympathizers.<ref name=Betrayed2/>\n\nBy 1898, Wilmington's key political power was in the hands of \"The Big Four\", who were representative of the Fusion party \u2013 the mayor, Dr. Silas P.

Many newspapers published pictures and stories implying that African-American men were sexually attacking white women in the city.<ref name=\"McLaurin\"/> This belief was championed throughout the country following a speech by [[Rebecca Latimer Felton]], a prominent [[Women's suffrage|women's suffragist]], and wife of Georgia populist [[William H. Felton]], at the Georgia Agricultural Society, about the problems farm wives faced.<ref name=Ring/> She stressed that, of all the threats farm wives face, there was none greater than \"the black rapist\", due to the failure of white men to protect them. She advocated that white men should resort to vigilante justice as a way for them to restore that protection:\n\n{{quote|When there is not enough religion in the pulpit to organize a crusade against sin; nor justice in the court house to promptly punish crime; nor manhood enough in the nation to put a sheltering arm about innocence and virtue \u2013 if it needs lynching to protect woman's dearest possession from the ravening human beasts \u2013 then I say lynch, a thousand times a week if necessary.<ref name=Ring/>|Mrs. W. H. Felton, August 11, 1897}}\n\nIn response to Felton's speech, and the danger it imposed upon black men, 32-year-old Alexander Manly wrote an editorial, refuting it and addressing white women having consensual sex with black men:\n\n{{quote|A Mrs. Felton from Georgia, makes a speech before the Agricultural Society, at Tybee, Ga., in which she advocates lynching as an extreme measure. This woman makes a strong plea for womanhood and if the alleged crimes of rape were half so frequent as is oftimes reported, her plea would be worthy of consideration.\n\nMrs. Felton, like many other so-called Christians, loses sight of the basic principle of the religion of Christ in her plea for one class of people as against another ...\n\nMrs. Felton begins well for she admits that education will better protect the girls on the farm from the assaulter. This we admit and it should not be confined to the white any more than to the colored girls. The papers are filled often with reports of rapes of white women and the subsequent lynchings of the alleged rapists. The editors pour forth volumes of aspersions against all Negroes because of the few who may be guilty. If the papers and speakers of the other race would condemn the commission of the crime because it is crime and not try to make it appear that the Negroes were the only criminals, they would find their strongest allies in the intelligent Negroes themselves; and together the whites and blacks would root the evil out of both races.\n\nWe suggest that the whites guard their women more closely, as Mrs. Felton says, thus giving no opportunity for the human fiend, be he white or black. You leave your goods out of doors and then complain because they are taken away. Poor white men are careless in the matter of protecting their women, especially on the farms. They are careless of their conduct toward them and our experience teaches us that the women of that race are not any more particular in the matter of clandestine meetings with colored men than are the white men with colored women. Meetings of this kind go on for some time until the woman's infatuation, or the man's boldness, bring attention to them, and the man is lynched for rape. Every Negro lynched is called a \"big burly, black brute\", when in fact many ... were sufficiently attractive for white girls of culture and refinement to fall in love with them as is very well known to all.\n\nMrs. Felton must begin at the fountain head if she wishes to purify the stream.  Teach your men purity. Let virtue be something more than an excuse for them to intimidate and torture a helpless people. Tell your men that it is no worse for a black man to be intimate with a white woman than for the white man to be intimate with a colored woman.\n\nYou set yourselves down as a lot of carping hypocrites in fact you cry aloud for the virtue of your women while you seek to destroy the morality of ours. Don't ever think that your women will remain pure while you are debauching ours.

The city might have been preparing for a siege instead of an election ... All shades of political beliefs were represented: but in the presence of what they believed to be an overwhelming crisis, they brushed aside the great principles that divide parties and individuals, and stood together as one man. When I emphasize the fact, that every block in every ward was thus organized, and that the precautionary meetings were attended by ministers, lawyers, doctors, merchants, railroad officials, cotton exporters, and, indeed, by the reputable, taxpaying, substantial men of the city, the extent and significance of this armed movement can, perhaps, be realized. It was not the wild and freakish organization of irresponsible men, but the deliberate action of determined citizens ... Military preparations, so extensive as to suggest assault from some foreign foe, must have had unusual inspiration and definite purpose.\n\nThe fiat had gone forth; and it was expected that the Negroes, when they learned that the right of suffrage was to be denied them, would resist. From their churches and from their lodges had come reports of incendiary speeches, of impassioned appeals to the blacks to use the bullet that had no respect for color, and the kerosene and torch that would play havoc with the white man's cotton in bale and ware house. It was this fear of the Negro uprising in defence of his electorate \u2014 of a forcible and revengeful retaliation \u2014 that offered an ostensible ground for the general display of arms; but if the truth be told, the reason thus offered was little more than a fortunate excuse. The whites had determined to regain their supremacy; and the wholesale armament was intended to convey to the blacks an earnest of this decision. There would have been rapid-fire guns and Winchester rifles if every church had held a silent pulpit, and every lodge-room where the Negroes met had been empty. White supremacy, therefore, was the magnet that attracted, the tie that bound, the one overwhelming force that dominated everything.<ref name=RaceWarInNC/>}}\n\nThe Democrats hired two detectives to investigate the rumors, including one black detective.

J.

Firing began, and it seemed like a mighty battle in war time. The shrieks and screams of children, of mothers, of wives were heard, such as caused the blood of the most inhuman person to creep. Thousands of women, children and men rushed to the swamps and there lay upon the earth in the cold to freeze and starve. The woods were filled with colored people. The streets were dotted with their dead bodies. A white gentleman said that he saw ten bodies lying in the undertakers office at one time. Some of their bodies were left lying in the streets until up in the next day following the riot. Some were found by the stench and miasma that came forth from their decaying bodies under their houses. Every colored man who passed through the streets had either to be guarded by one of the crowd or have a paper (pass) giving him the right to pass. All colored men at the cotton press and oil mills were ordered not to leave their labor but stop there, while their wives and children were shrieking and crying in the midst of the flying balls and in sight of the cannons and Gatling gun. All the white people had gone out of that part of the City, this army of men marched through the streets, sword buckled to their sides, giving the command to fire. Men stood at their labor wringing their hands and weeping, but they dare not move to the protection of their homes. And then when they passed through the streets had to hold up their hands and be searched. The little white boys of the city searched them and took from them every means of defence, and if they resisted, they were shot down ... The city was under military rule; no Negro was allowed to come  into the city without being examined or without passing through with his boss, for whom he labored. Colored women were examined and their hats taken off and search was made even under their clothing. They went from house to house looking for Negroes that they considered offensive; took arms they had hidden and killed them for the least expression of manhood. They gathered around colored homes, firing like great sportsmen firing at rabbits in an open field and when one would jump his man, from sixty to one hundred shots would be turned loose upon him. His escape was impossible. One fellow was walking along a railroad and they shot him down without any provocation. It is said by an eye witness that men lay upon the street dead and dying, while members of their race walked by helpless and unable to do them any good or their families. Negro stores were closed and the owners thereof driven out of the city and even shipped away at the point of the gun. Some of the churches were searched for ammunition, and cannons turned toward the door in the attitude of blowing up the church if the pastor or officers did not open them that they might go through.<ref name=Herald>{{cite news|author=J.

He painted the white mob not as murderous lawbreakers, but as peaceful, law-abiding citizens who simply wanted to restore law and order. He also portrayed any violence committed by whites as either being accidental or executed in self-defense, effectively laying blame on both sides:<ref name=NewYorker/><ref name=NO/>\n\n{{quote|Demand was made for the negroes to reply to our ultimatum to them [to destroy the black newspaper and leave town forever, or have it destroyed/be removed by force], and their reply was delayed or sent astray (whether purposely or not, I do not know), and that caused all the trouble. The people came to me. Although two other men were in command, they demanded that I should lead them. I took my Winchester rifle, assumed my position at the head of the procession, and marched to the \"Record\" office. We designed merely to destroy the press. I took a couple of men to the door, when our demand to open was not answered, and burst it in. Not I personally, for I have not the strength, but those with me did it.\n\nWe wrecked the [newspaper] house. I believe that the fire which occurred was purely accidental; it certainly was unintentional on our part ... ''\n\nI then marched the column back through the streets down to the armory, lined them up, and stood on the stoop and made a speech to them. I said: \"Now you have performed the duty which you called on me to lead you to perform. now let us go quietly to our homes, and about our business, and obey the law, unless we are forced, in self-defense, to do other wise.\" I came home ... In about an hour, or less time, the trouble commenced over in the other end of town, by the negroes starting to come over here. I was not there at the time ...\n\nThen they got seven of the negro leaders, brought them downtown, and put them in jail. I had been elected mayor by that time. It was certainly the strangest performance in American history, though we literally followed the law, as the Fusionists made it themselves. There has not been a single illegal act committed in the change of government. Simply, the old board went out, and the new board came in \u2014 strictly according to law. In regard to those men who had been brought to the jail a crowd said that they intended to destroy them; that they were the leaders, and that they were going to take the men out of the jail ... I stayed up the whole night myself, and the forces stayed up all night, and we saved those wretched creatures' lives.\n\nI waited until next morning at nine o'clock and then I made the troops form a hollow square in front of the jail. We placed the scoundrels in the midst of the square and marched them to the railroad station. I bought and gave them tickets to Richmond, and told them to go and to never show up again. That bunch were all negroes ...\n\nThe negroes here have always professed to have faith in me. When I made the speech in the Opera House they were astounded. One of the leaders said: \"My God! when so conservative a man as Colonel Waddell talks about filling the river with dead niggers, I want to get out of town!\"  Since this trouble many negroes have come to me and said they are glad I have taken charge ...\n\nAs to the government we have established, it is a perfectly legal one. The law, passed by the Republican Legislature itself, has been complied with. There was no intimidation used in the establishment of the present city government. The old government had become satisfied of their inefficiency and utterly helpless imbecility, and believed if they did not resign they would be run out of town ...\n\nI believe the negroes are as much rejoiced as the white people that order has been evolved out of chaos.<ref name=Atlantic/><ref>Alfred M.

Tensions grew in Wilmington and other areas because of a shortage of supplies; Confederate currency had no value and the South was impoverished at the end of the long war.\n\nIn 1868, North Carolina ratified the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], resulting in the recognition of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], and in the state legislature and governorship falling under Republican rule.

Many white Democrats had been embittered since the Confederacy's defeat. Insurgent veterans joined the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK), which orchestrated considerable violence at elections in order to suppress the black vote.\n\nDemocrats regained control of the state legislature in 1870. After the KKK was suppressed by the federal government through the [[Force Act of 1870]], new [[paramilitary]] groups arose in the South. By 1874, chapters of [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], a [[paramilitary]] arm of the Democratic Party, had formed in North Carolina.\n\nDemocrats developed a plan to reverse \"home rule,\" meaning local officials would no longer be elected, but appointed by the state.

August 24, 1898.]]\nFor some time, Josephus Daniels had used Wilmington as a symbol of \"Negro domination\" because its government was biracial, ignoring the fact that it was dominated by a two-thirds white majority.  Many newspapers published pictures and stories implying that African-American men were sexually attacking white women in the city.<ref name=\"McLaurin\"/> This belief was championed throughout the country following a speech by [[Rebecca Latimer Felton]], a prominent [[Women's suffrage|women's suffragist]], and wife of Georgia populist [[William H. Felton]], at the Georgia Agricultural Society, about the problems farm wives faced.<ref name=Ring/> She stressed that, of all the threats farm wives face, there was none greater than \"the black rapist\", due to the failure of white men to protect them. She advocated that white men should resort to vigilante justice as a way for them to restore that protection:\n\n{{quote|When there is not enough religion in the pulpit to organize a crusade against sin; nor justice in the court house to promptly punish crime; nor manhood enough in the nation to put a sheltering arm about innocence and virtue \u2013 if it needs lynching to protect woman's dearest possession from the ravening human beasts \u2013 then I say lynch, a thousand times a week if necessary.<ref name=Ring/>|Mrs. W. H. Felton, August 11, 1897}}\n\nIn response to Felton's speech, and the danger it imposed upon black men, 32-year-old Alexander Manly wrote an editorial, refuting it and addressing white women having consensual sex with black men:\n\n{{quote|A Mrs. Felton from Georgia, makes a speech before the Agricultural Society, at Tybee, Ga., in which she advocates lynching as an extreme measure. This woman makes a strong plea for womanhood and if the alleged crimes of rape were half so frequent as is oftimes reported, her plea would be worthy of consideration.\n\nMrs. Felton, like many other so-called Christians, loses sight of the basic principle of the religion of Christ in her plea for one class of people as against another ...\n\nMrs. Felton begins well for she admits that education will better protect the girls on the farm from the assaulter. This we admit and it should not be confined to the white any more than to the colored girls. The papers are filled often with reports of rapes of white women and the subsequent lynchings of the alleged rapists. The editors pour forth volumes of aspersions against all Negroes because of the few who may be guilty. If the papers and speakers of the other race would condemn the commission of the crime because it is crime and not try to make it appear that the Negroes were the only criminals, they would find their strongest allies in the intelligent Negroes themselves; and together the whites and blacks would root the evil out of both races.\n\nWe suggest that the whites guard their women more closely, as Mrs. Felton says, thus giving no opportunity for the human fiend, be he white or black. You leave your goods out of doors and then complain because they are taken away. Poor white men are careless in the matter of protecting their women, especially on the farms. They are careless of their conduct toward them and our experience teaches us that the women of that race are not any more particular in the matter of clandestine meetings with colored men than are the white men with colored women. Meetings of this kind go on for some time until the woman's infatuation, or the man's boldness, bring attention to them, and the man is lynched for rape. Every Negro lynched is called a \"big burly, black brute\", when in fact many ... were sufficiently attractive for white girls of culture and refinement to fall in love with them as is very well known to all.\n\nMrs. Felton must begin at the fountain head if she wishes to purify the stream.  Teach your men purity. Let virtue be something more than an excuse for them to intimidate and torture a helpless people. Tell your men that it is no worse for a black man to be intimate with a white woman than for the white man to be intimate with a colored woman.\n\nYou set yourselves down as a lot of carping hypocrites in fact you cry aloud for the virtue of your women while you seek to destroy the morality of ours. Don't ever think that your women will remain pure while you are debauching ours.

He and supporters moved his entire press from the corner of Water Street and Princess Street to a frame building on Seventh Street between Ann and Nun.  He had planned to move to Love and Charity Hall (aka Ruth Hall), on South Seventh Street, but it declined to take him as a tenant because his presence would have greatly increased the building's insurance rate.

West, went to Wilmington to cover the White Supremacy Campaign. He wrote:\n\n{{quote|In Wilmington, I found a very remarkable condition of affairs. The city might have been preparing for a siege instead of an election ... All shades of political beliefs were represented: but in the presence of what they believed to be an overwhelming crisis, they brushed aside the great principles that divide parties and individuals, and stood together as one man. When I emphasize the fact, that every block in every ward was thus organized, and that the precautionary meetings were attended by ministers, lawyers, doctors, merchants, railroad officials, cotton exporters, and, indeed, by the reputable, taxpaying, substantial men of the city, the extent and significance of this armed movement can, perhaps, be realized. It was not the wild and freakish organization of irresponsible men, but the deliberate action of determined citizens ... Military preparations, so extensive as to suggest assault from some foreign foe, must have had unusual inspiration and definite purpose.\n\nThe fiat had gone forth; and it was expected that the Negroes, when they learned that the right of suffrage was to be denied them, would resist. From their churches and from their lodges had come reports of incendiary speeches, of impassioned appeals to the blacks to use the bullet that had no respect for color, and the kerosene and torch that would play havoc with the white man's cotton in bale and ware house. It was this fear of the Negro uprising in defence of his electorate \u2014 of a forcible and revengeful retaliation \u2014 that offered an ostensible ground for the general display of arms; but if the truth be told, the reason thus offered was little more than a fortunate excuse. The whites had determined to regain their supremacy; and the wholesale armament was intended to convey to the blacks an earnest of this decision. There would have been rapid-fire guns and Winchester rifles if every church had held a silent pulpit, and every lodge-room where the Negroes met had been empty. White supremacy, therefore, was the magnet that attracted, the tie that bound, the one overwhelming force that dominated everything.<ref name=RaceWarInNC/>}}\n\nThe Democrats hired two detectives to investigate the rumors, including one black detective.

Thousands of women, children and men rushed to the swamps and there lay upon the earth in the cold to freeze and starve. The woods were filled with colored people. The streets were dotted with their dead bodies. A white gentleman said that he saw ten bodies lying in the undertakers office at one time. Some of their bodies were left lying in the streets until up in the next day following the riot. Some were found by the stench and miasma that came forth from their decaying bodies under their houses. Every colored man who passed through the streets had either to be guarded by one of the crowd or have a paper (pass) giving him the right to pass. All colored men at the cotton press and oil mills were ordered not to leave their labor but stop there, while their wives and children were shrieking and crying in the midst of the flying balls and in sight of the cannons and Gatling gun. All the white people had gone out of that part of the City, this army of men marched through the streets, sword buckled to their sides, giving the command to fire. Men stood at their labor wringing their hands and weeping, but they dare not move to the protection of their homes. And then when they passed through the streets had to hold up their hands and be searched. The little white boys of the city searched them and took from them every means of defence, and if they resisted, they were shot down ... The city was under military rule; no Negro was allowed to come  into the city without being examined or without passing through with his boss, for whom he labored. Colored women were examined and their hats taken off and search was made even under their clothing. They went from house to house looking for Negroes that they considered offensive; took arms they had hidden and killed them for the least expression of manhood. They gathered around colored homes, firing like great sportsmen firing at rabbits in an open field and when one would jump his man, from sixty to one hundred shots would be turned loose upon him. His escape was impossible. One fellow was walking along a railroad and they shot him down without any provocation. It is said by an eye witness that men lay upon the street dead and dying, while members of their race walked by helpless and unable to do them any good or their families. Negro stores were closed and the owners thereof driven out of the city and even shipped away at the point of the gun.

Rountree went on to chair a special joint committee overseeing the disenfranchisement amendment, a committee that existed to circumvent the U.S. Constitution which, in fact, granted blacks the right to vote.<ref name=Betrayed2/>\n\nThe legislature passed a law requiring new voters to pay a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]], and passed a state constitutional amendment requiring prospective voters to demonstrate, to local elected officials, that they could read and write any section of the Constitution \u2013 practices that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|discriminated against]] poor whites, and more than 50,000 black men.<ref name=Disenfranchise>{{cite news|title=NORTH CAROLINA BOURBON PLANS.; USING THE POLL TAX QUESTION AND PROHIBITION TO FURTHER DEMOCRATIC SCHEMES.|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1881/02/22/98912374.pdf|date=February 22, 1881|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>  However, to make sure that as few poor whites as possible would be hurt by the law, and prevented from voting Democrat, Rountree invoked a \"[[Grandfather clause]]\". The clause guaranteed the right to register and vote, bypassing the literacy requirement, if the voter, or a voter's lineal ancestor, was eligible to vote in his state of residence prior to January 1, 1867.  This excluded practically any black man from voting.<ref name=Grandfather>{{cite web|author=James L.

The [[US Supreme Court]] (at the time) upheld such measures.\n\n===Election of 1900===\nTwo years after the coup, the Democrats again ran on \"negro domination\" with disenfranchisement of blacks on the ballot.

He painted the white mob not as murderous lawbreakers, but as peaceful, law-abiding citizens who simply wanted to restore law and order. He also portrayed any violence committed by whites as either being accidental or executed in self-defense, effectively laying blame on both sides:<ref name=NewYorker/><ref name=NO/>\n\n{{quote|Demand was made for the negroes to reply to our ultimatum to them [to destroy the black newspaper and leave town forever, or have it destroyed/be removed by force], and their reply was delayed or sent astray (whether purposely or not, I do not know), and that caused all the trouble. The people came to me. Although two other men were in command, they demanded that I should lead them. I took my Winchester rifle, assumed my position at the head of the procession, and marched to the \"Record\" office. We designed merely to destroy the press. I took a couple of men to the door, when our demand to open was not answered, and burst it in. Not I personally, for I have not the strength, but those with me did it.\n\nWe wrecked the [newspaper] house. I believe that the fire which occurred was purely accidental; it certainly was unintentional on our part ... ''\n\nI then marched the column back through the streets down to the armory, lined them up, and stood on the stoop and made a speech to them. I said: \"Now you have performed the duty which you called on me to lead you to perform. now let us go quietly to our homes, and about our business, and obey the law, unless we are forced, in self-defense, to do other wise.\" I came home ... In about an hour, or less time, the trouble commenced over in the other end of town, by the negroes starting to come over here. I was not there at the time ...\n\nThen they got seven of the negro leaders, brought them downtown, and put them in jail. I had been elected mayor by that time. It was certainly the strangest performance in American history, though we literally followed the law, as the Fusionists made it themselves. There has not been a single illegal act committed in the change of government. Simply, the old board went out, and the new board came in \u2014 strictly according to law. In regard to those men who had been brought to the jail a crowd said that they intended to destroy them; that they were the leaders, and that they were going to take the men out of the jail ... I stayed up the whole night myself, and the forces stayed up all night, and we saved those wretched creatures' lives.\n\nI waited until next morning at nine o'clock and then I made the troops form a hollow square in front of the jail. We placed the scoundrels in the midst of the square and marched them to the railroad station. I bought and gave them tickets to Richmond, and told them to go and to never show up again. That bunch were all negroes ...\n\nThe negroes here have always professed to have faith in me. When I made the speech in the Opera House they were astounded. One of the leaders said: \"My God! when so conservative a man as Colonel Waddell talks about filling the river with dead niggers, I want to get out of town!\"  Since this trouble many negroes have come to me and said they are glad I have taken charge ...\n\nAs to the government we have established, it is a perfectly legal one. The law, passed by the Republican Legislature itself, has been complied with. There was no intimidation used in the establishment of the present city government. The old government had become satisfied of their inefficiency and utterly helpless imbecility, and believed if they did not resign they would be run out of town ...\n\nI believe the negroes are as much rejoiced as the white people that order has been evolved out of chaos.<ref name=Atlantic/><ref>Alfred M.

His scheme even included a Greek-style open-air theatre, though executed in minimal form.\n\nBuildings in the campus area designed by Alvar Aalto:\n\n* Teachers Training School 1951-54\n* Staff housing 1951 (now offices of the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 University Museum, Building G)\n* Student's Hall of Residence 1952-54 (Building Philologica, P)\n* Lozzi and Lyhty staff and student refectories (P)\n* Main Building 1954-56, Building C\n* Swimming Pool 1954-58, 1964, several alterations (called Aalto-Alvari)\n* Physical Education Building 1971\n* Library 1957 (now the Aalto Reading Room)\n\nIn 1969-70 an architectural competition was arranged for the design of new university campus sites at Mattilanniemi and Ylist\u00f6nrinne. The competition was won by architect [[Arto Sipinen]], who had previously worked in Aalto's office. Sipinen also designed new buildings for the main campus, including a new main library (1974).\n\n==Other institutes==\n\nOther institutes within the university include:\n* Kokkola University Consortium Chydenius\n* Institute for Educational Research\n* Language Centre\n* Open University\n* [[Open Science Centre: Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 University Library|University Library]] University Museum\n\n==Student Union==\n\nThe Student Union of the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 (JYY) is the students\u2019 very own organization. The basic task of the Student Union is to represent its members and protect their interests and rights at the University as well as in the surrounding society. All degree and exchange students enrolled in the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 become members of the Student Union.\n\n==Accommodation==\n\n===Kortepohja Student Village===\n\n[[Kortepohja]] Student Village is owned by the Student Union of the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4. Kortepohja, located about 2.5 kilometres from the Main Campus and city centre, housing approximately 1900 students.\n\n===Central Finland Student Housing Foundation, KOAS===\n\nKOAS offers ca. 3900 apartments all around the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 town area. The apartment buildings are conveniently located in the suburbs of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4.\n\n==Notable people and alumni==\n\n* [[Alvar Aalto]]\n* [[Faina Jyrkil\u00e4]]\n* [[Seminaarinm\u00e4en mieslaulajat]]\n* [[Sofi Oksanen]]\n* [[Jutta Urpilainen]]\n* [[Majaliwa Kassim Majaliwa]], prime minister of [[Tanzania]], November 2015 \u2013 present\n* [[Lotta Hintsa]] - [[Miss Finland|Miss Finland 2013]].\n\n==Former rectors==\n\n*[[Kaarle Oksala]] 1934\u20131940\n*[[Erik Ahlman]] 1940\u20131948\n*[[Aarni Penttil\u00e4]] 1948\u20131962\n*[[Martti Takala]] 1963\u20131967\n*[[Ilppo Simo Louhivaara]] 1967\u20131977\n*[[Kalevi Heinil\u00e4]] 1977\u20131982\n*[[Martti Takala]] 1982\u20131988\n*[[Antti Tanskanen]] 1988\u20131992\n*[[Aino Sallinen]] 1992\u20132012\n*[[Matti Manninen (physicist)|Matti Manninen]] 2012\u20132017\n* Dr. Professor [[Keijo H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen]] from 1 August 2017\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of summer schools of nature sciences]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat-inline|University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4}}\n*[https://www.jyu.fi/en/ University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4] - Official site\n*[http://architectuul.com/architecture/jyvaskyla-university Architecture of Jyvaskyla University] by [[Alvar Aalto]] on [http://architectuul.com Architectuul]\n\n{{Finnish universities}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jyvaskyla, University of}}\n[[Category:Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4|University of Jyvaskyla]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Finland]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1863]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Central Finland]]\n", "name_user": "Tarjavk", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOther institutes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Jyv%C3%A4skyl%C3%A4"}

For example, \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" shows it to be false. Formally, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are only logical constructions distinct from those that are truly possible.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nIt was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice. In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. holds that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created within the logical structure constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  Popper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"all men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Yet another example of an unfalsifiable statement is \"all angels have large wings\". It is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n\n===Basic statements===\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 14-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes. For example, the concept of swans define a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as we discussed [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| before]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require that we use a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples). \n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v.

Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v.

Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

However, when these predictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses which made it compatible with the facts. By this means, Popper asserted, a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudo-scientific dogma.\"}}\n\nSome economists, such as those of the [[Austrian School]], believe that [[macroeconomics]] is [[Empiricism|empirically]] unfalsifiable and that thus the only appropriate means to understand economic events is by [[deductive reasoning|logically]] studying [[Subjective theory of value|the intentions]] of [[methodological individualism|individual economic decision-makers]], [[Praxeology#Austrian School approach|based on]] certain fundamental [[Action axiom|truths]].{{sfn|Heath|2015}}{{sfn|Mises|1998|p=11}} Prominent figures within the Austrian School of economics, [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were associates of Karl Popper, with whom they co-founded the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n\n===Evolution===\n{{Main|Objections to evolution#Unfalsifiability|l1=Objections to evolution: Unfalsifiability}}\nNumerous examples of potential (indirect) ways to falsify common descent have been proposed by its proponents.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]].

For example, \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" shows it to be false. Formally, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are only logical constructions distinct from those that are truly possible.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nIt was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice. In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. holds that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created within the logical structure constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  Popper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"all men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Yet another example of an unfalsifiable statement is \"all angels have large wings\". It is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n\n===Basic statements===\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 14-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes. For example, the concept of swans define a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as we discussed [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| before]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require that we use a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples). \n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v. Arkansas|1982|loc=at the end of section IV. (C)}}}}\n\n==== ''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals'' case ====\nIn the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Consequently, it concludes that recent opinions substituting mere falsifiability for actual empirical testing are misconstruing and misapplying Daubert.\"}}\n\n===Economics===\n[[Karl Popper]] argued that [[Marxism]] shifted from scientific to unscientific.{{efn-ua | {{harvnb|Thornton|2016}}: \"For Marxism, Popper believed, had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a theory which was genuinely predictive. However, when these predictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses which made it compatible with the facts. By this means, Popper asserted, a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudo-scientific dogma.\"}}\n\nSome economists, such as those of the [[Austrian School]], believe that [[macroeconomics]] is [[Empiricism|empirically]] unfalsifiable and that thus the only appropriate means to understand economic events is by [[deductive reasoning|logically]] studying [[Subjective theory of value|the intentions]] of [[methodological individualism|individual economic decision-makers]], [[Praxeology#Austrian School approach|based on]] certain fundamental [[Action axiom|truths]].{{sfn|Heath|2015}}{{sfn|Mises|1998|p=11}} Prominent figures within the Austrian School of economics, [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were associates of Karl Popper, with whom they co-founded the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n\n===Evolution===\n{{Main|Objections to evolution#Unfalsifiability|l1=Objections to evolution: Unfalsifiability}}\nNumerous examples of potential (indirect) ways to falsify common descent have been proposed by its proponents.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]].

He then earned a law degree at [[New York University School of Law]], where he was a member of the law review.\n\nThe name of Cosell's grandfather was changed by immigration authorities when he entered the United States; Howard Cosell said he changed his name from \"Cohen\" to \"Cosell\" while a law student as a way to honor his father and grandfather by reverting to a version of his family's original [[Polish language|Polish]] name.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bloom |first=John |date=2010 |title=There You Have it: The Life, Legacy, and Legend of Howard Cosell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRirlKfG3J0C&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q=howard%20cosell%20changed%20name%20polish |location=Amherst, MA |publisher=University of Massachusetts Press |page=67 |isbn=978-1-55849-837-2}}</ref>\n\n===Military service===\nCosell was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in the state of New York in 1941, but when the United States entered [[World War II]] at the end of that year he was commissioned in the [[United States Army]] as an officer with its [[United States Army Transportation Corps|Transportation Corps]]. In 1944 he married Mary Edith Abrams in a judge's chambers in [[Brooklyn]]. At the war's conclusion in 1945, he was discharged from the United States Army with the rank of [[Major (United States)|major]].\n\n===Early legal career===\nAfter the war, Cosell began practicing law in [[Manhattan]], primarily union law. Some of his clients were actors, and some were athletes, including [[Willie Mays]]. Cosell's own hero in athletics was [[Jackie Robinson]], who served as a personal and professional inspiration to him in his career.\n\n==Career==\n===Introduction to broadcasting===\nCosell represented the [[Little League]] of New York, when in 1953, Hal Neal (president ABC Radio), then an [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]] manager, asked him to host a show on New York flagship [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] featuring Little League participants. The show marked the beginning of a relationship with WABC and ABC Radio that would last his entire broadcasting career.\n\nCosell hosted the Little League show for three years without pay, and then decided to leave the law to become a full-time broadcaster. He approached [[Robert Pauley]], President of ABC Radio, with a proposal for a weekly show. Pauley told him the network could not afford to develop untried talent, but he would be put on the air if he would get a sponsor. To Pauley's surprise, Cosell came back with a relative's shirt company as a sponsor, and \"Speaking of Sports\" was born.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/business/media/14pauley.html Robert Pauley, Former Head of ABC Radio, Dies at 85], ''The New York Times'', May 14, 2009.</ref>\n\nCosell took his \"tell it like it is\" approach when he teamed with the ex\u2013[[Brooklyn Dodgers]] pitcher \"Big ''Numba'' Thirteen\" [[Ralph Branca]] on WABC's pre- and post-game [[Radio programming|radio shows]] of the [[New York Mets]] in their nascent years beginning in 1962. He pulled no punches in taking members of the hapless [[expansion team]] to task.\n\nOtherwise on radio, Cosell did his show, ''Speaking of Sports'', as well as sports reports and updates for affiliated [[radio station]]s around the country; he continued his radio duties even after he became prominent on television. Cosell then became a sports anchor at [[WABC-TV]] in New York, where he served in that role from 1961 to 1974. He expanded his commentary beyond sports to a radio show entitled ''Speaking of Everything''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1987/09/02/cosell-gets-back-in-the-picture/61f7b279-6f64-442c-8e73-3af9caccf4e2/|title=COSELL GETS BACK IN THE PICTURE|first=Norman|last=Chad|date=September 2, 1987|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\n===Rise to prominence, supports black athletes===\nCosell rose to prominence in the early-1960s, covering boxer [[Muhammad Ali]], beginning from the time he fought under his [[Name at birth|birth name]], Cassius Clay. The two seemed to have an affinity despite their different personalities, and complemented each other in broadcasts. Cosell was one of the first sportscasters to refer to the boxer as Muhammad Ali after he changed his name, and supported him when he refused to be inducted into the military. Cosell was also an outspoken supporter of Olympic sprinters [[John Carlos]] and [[Tommie Smith]], after they raised their fists in a [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|\"black power\" salute during their 1968 medal ceremony]] in [[Mexico City]]. In a time when many sports broadcasters avoided touching social, racial, or other controversial issues, and kept a certain level of collegiality towards the sports figures they commented on, Cosell did not, and indeed built a reputation around his [[catchphrase]], \"I'm just telling it like it is.\"\n\nCosell's style of reporting transformed [[sports broadcasting]] in the United States. Whereas previous sportscasters had mostly been known for [[color commentary]] and lively [[play-by-play]], Cosell had an intellectual approach. His use of analysis and context brought television sports reporting closer to \"hard\" news reporting. However, his distinctive [[staccato]] voice, [[New York City English|accent]], [[syntax]], and [[cadence (music)|cadence]] were a form of color commentary all their own.\n\nCosell earned his greatest interest from the public when he backed Ali after the boxer's championship title was stripped from him for refusing military service during the [[Vietnam War]]. Cosell found vindication several years later when he was able to inform Ali that the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] had unanimously ruled in favor of Ali in ''[[Clay v. United States]]''.\n\nCosell called most of Ali's fights immediately before and after the boxer returned from his three-year exile in October 1970. Those fights were broadcast on taped delay usually a week after they were transmitted on closed circuit. However, Cosell did not call two of Ali's biggest fights, the [[Rumble in the Jungle]] in October 1974 and the first [[Fight of the Century|Ali\u2013Joe Frazier bout]] in March 1971. Promoter [[Jerry Perenchio]] selected actor [[Burt Lancaster]], who had never provided color commentary for a fight, to work the bout with longtime announcer [[Don Dunphy]] and former light-heavyweight champion [[Archie Moore]]. Cosell attended that fight as a spectator only. He would do a [[voice-over]] of that bout, when it was shown on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] a few days before the second [[Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier II|Ali-Frazier bout]] in January 1974.\n\nPerhaps his most famous call took place in the [[George Foreman#The Sunshine Showdown vs. Joe Frazier|fight]] between [[Joe Frazier]] and [[George Foreman]] for the World Heavyweight Championship in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] in 1973. When Foreman knocked Frazier to the mat the first of six times, roughly two minutes into the first round, Cosell yelled out:\n\n{{quote|Down Goes Frazier! Down Goes Frazier! Down Goes Frazier!}}\n\nHis call of Frazier's first trip to the mat became one of the most quoted phrases in American sports broadcasting history. Foreman beat Frazier by a [[Technical knockout|TKO]] in the second round to win the [[World heavyweight boxing championship|World Heavyweight Championship]].\n\nCosell provided blow-by-blow commentary for ABC of some of boxing's biggest matches during the 1970s and the early-1980s, including [[Ken Norton]]'s upset win over Ali in 1973 and Ali's defeat of [[Leon Spinks]] in 1978 recapturing the heavyweight title for the third time. His signature [[toupee]] was unceremoniously knocked off in front of live ABC cameras when a scuffle broke out after a broadcast match between [[Scott LeDoux]] and Johnny Boudreaux. Cosell quickly retrieved his hairpiece and replaced it. During interviews in studio with Ali, the champion would tease and threaten to remove the hairpiece with Cosell playing along but never allowing it to be touched. On one of these occasions, Ali quipped, \"Cosell, you're a phony, and that thing on your head comes from the tail of a pony.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5294873|title=Ali and Cosell, Irresistible Enigmas|website=NPR.org}}</ref>\n\nWith typical headline generating drama, Cosell abruptly ended his broadcast association with the sport of boxing while providing coverage for ABC for the heavyweight championship bout between [[Larry Holmes]] and [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]] on November 26, 1982. Halfway through the bout and with Cobb absorbing a beating, Cosell stopped providing anything more than rudimentary comments about round number and the participants punctuated with occasional declarations of disgust during the 15 rounds. He declared shortly after the fight to a national television audience that he had broadcast his last professional boxing match.\n\nCosell also was an ABC commentator for the television broadcast of the second of the two famous 1973 \"[[Battle of the Sexes (tennis)|Battles of the Sexes]]\" tennis matches, this one between [[Bobby Riggs]] and [[Billie Jean King]].\n\n===Feuds===\nDuring Cosell's tenure as a sportscaster, he frequently clashed with longtime ''[[New York Daily News]]'' sports columnist [[Dick Young (sportswriter)|Dick Young]], who rarely missed an opportunity to denigrate the broadcaster in print as an \"ass\", a \"shill\", or most often, \"Howie the Fraud\". Young would sometimes stand near Cosell and shout profanities so that the audio he was taping for his radio show would be unusable. Writing about Cosell, sportswriter [[Jimmy Cannon]] sniped, \"This is a guy who changed his name, put on a toupee and tried to convince the world that he tells it like it is.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20105742,00.html |title=The Mouth That Roared|author=William Plummer|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}</ref> He further added, \"If Howard Cosell were a sport, he'd be [[roller derby]].\"<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1006539/index.htm Nack, William. \"Telling It Like It Is\", ''Sports Illustrated'', May 1, 1995].</ref>\n\nCosell, according to longtime [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[racecaster]] [[Chris Economaki]], \"had an enormous and monumental ego, and may have been the most pompous man I've ever met.\" Cosell ripped Economaki for a miscue in an interview with [[Cale Yarborough]] for ABC \"(and he) never let me forget that\". At an ABC [[Christmas]] party Economaki's wife asked to be introduced to Cosell and Chris said, \"{{'}}Howard, for some inexplicable reason my wife wants to meet you...' and it (ticked) him off to no end. He really took it personally.\"<ref>Economaki, Chris (with Dave Argabright) (2006) ''LET 'EM ALL GO! The Story of Auto Racing by the Man Who Was There'' (Fisher, IN: Books By Dave Argabright), p. 191. {{ISBN|0-9719639-3-2}}.</ref>\n\n===''Monday Night Football''===\nIn [[1970 NFL season|1970]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[executive producer]] for sports [[Roone Arledge]] hired Cosell to be a [[color commentator|commentator]] for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' (MNF), the first time in 15 years that [[American football]] was broadcast weekly in [[prime time]]. Cosell was accompanied most of the time by ex-football players [[Frank Gifford]] and [[Don Meredith|\"Dandy\" Don Meredith]].\n\nCosell was openly contemptuous of ex-athletes appointed to prominent sportscasting roles solely on account of their playing fame. He regularly clashed on-air with Meredith, whose laid-back style was in sharp contrast to Cosell's more critical approach to the games.\n\nThe Cosell-Meredith-Gifford dynamic helped make ''Monday Night Football'' a success; it frequently was the number one rated program in the [[Nielsen ratings]]. Cosell's inimitable style distinguished ''Monday Night Football'' from previous sports programming, and ushered in an era of more colorful broadcasters and [[24/7 service|24/7]] TV sports coverage.\n\nIt was during his ''MNF'' run that Cosell coined a phrase that came to be so identified with football that other announcers and spectators\u2014notably [[Chris Berman]]\u2014began to repeat it. An ordinary kickoff return began with Cosell giving commentary about a player's difficult life. It became extraordinary when he suddenly observed, \"He could go all the way!\" As evidenced by the thousands of websites that cite Cosell's quote, many sports commentators consider this to be one of the most famous sports quips of all time.\n\nAlso during his ''MNF'' run, after a 4 September 1978 NFL game, Cosell popularized the term \"[[nachos]]\".<ref>{{cite web | last = Munsey | last2 = Suppes | title = Arlington Stadium | work = Ballparks| url = http://www.ballparks.com/baseball/american/arling.htm | accessdate = 2008-12-30}}</ref>\n\n===Olympics===\nAlong with ''Monday Night Football'', Cosell worked the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] for [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]]. He played a key role on ABC's coverage of the [[Palestinian political violence|Palestinian terror]] group [[Black September (group)|Black September]]'s [[mass murder]] of [[Israel]]i athletes in [[Munich massacre|Munich]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]; providing reports directly from the [[Olympic Park|Olympic Village]] (his image can be seen and voice heard in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Munich (film)|film]] about the terror attack).\n\nIn the [[Boxing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Summer Games in Montreal]], and the [[Boxing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 games in Los Angeles]], Cosell was the main voice for boxing. [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] won the gold medal in his light welterweight class at Montreal, beginning his meteoric rise to a world professional title a few years later, and Cosell became close to Leonard, during this period, announcing many of his fights.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"I Never Played The Game\", by Howard Cosell, 1985</ref>\n\n===\"The Bronx is burning\"===\nCosell was widely attributed with saying the famous phrase \"the Bronx is burning\". Cosell is credited with saying the quote during Game 2 of the [[1977 World Series]], which took place in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] on October 12, 1977. For a couple of years, fires had routinely erupted in the South [[The Bronx|Bronx]], mostly due to owners of low-value properties burning their own real estate for [[insurance]] money. During the bottom of the first inning, an ABC aerial camera panned a few blocks from Yankee Stadium to a building on fire. The scene became a defining image of New York City in the 1970s. Cosell supposedly stated, \"There it is, ladies and gentlemen, The Bronx is burning.\"<ref name=nypost>{{cite news| url=https://nypost.com/2010/05/16/why-the-bronx-burned/ | work=New York Post | first=Joe | last=Flood | title=Why the Bronx Burned | date=May 16, 2010}}</ref> This was later picked up by presidential candidate [[Ronald Reagan]], who then made a special trip to the Bronx, to illustrate the failures of politicians to address the issues in that part of New York City.\n\nIn 2005, author Jonathan Mahler published ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx Is Burning]]'', a book about New York in 1977, and credited Cosell with the title quote during the aerial coverage of the fire. [[ESPN]] produced a 2007 [[Miniseries|mini-series]] based on the book ''[[The Bronx Is Burning]]''. Cosell's comment seemed to have captured the widespread view that New York City was in a state of decline.\n\nThe truth was discovered after Major League Baseball published a complete DVD set of all of the games of the 1977 World Series. Coverage of the fire began with [[Keith Jackson]]'s comments regarding the enormity of the blaze, while Cosell added that [[Jimmy Carter|President Jimmy Carter]] had visited that area just days before. At the top of the second inning, the fire was once again shown from a helicopter-mounted camera, and Cosell commented that the [[New York City Fire Department|New York Fire Department]] had a hard job to do in the Bronx as there were always numerous fires. In the bottom of the second, Cosell informed the audience that it was an abandoned building that was burning and no lives were in danger. There was no further comment on the fire, and Cosell appears to have never said \"The Bronx is Burning\" (at least not on camera) during Game 2.<ref name=nypost/>\n\nMahler's confusion could have arisen from a 1974 documentary entitled ''The Bronx Is Burning'': it is likely Mahler confused the documentary with his recollection of Cosell's comments when writing his book.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bestblog.mlblogs.com/archives/2007/08/did_howard_cose_1.html |title=Did Howard Cosell Really Say, \"The Bronx Is Burning\"?|accessdate=2009-12-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213023329/http://bestblog.mlblogs.com/archives/2007/08/did_howard_cose_1.html |archivedate=December 13, 2010  }}</ref>\n\n===Reports the death of John Lennon===\n{{main|Murder of John Lennon}}\nOn the night of December 8, 1980, during a ''Monday Night Football'' game between the [[1980 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] and the [[1980 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], Cosell shocked the television audience by interrupting his regular commentary duties to deliver a news bulletin on the murder of [[John Lennon]] in the midst of a live broadcast. Word had been passed to Cosell and Frank Gifford by [[Roone Arledge]], who was president of ABC's news and sports divisions at the time, near the end of the game.\n\nCosell was initially apprehensive about announcing Lennon's death. Off the air, Cosell conferred with Gifford and others saying \"Fellas, I just don't know, I'd like your opinion. I can't see this game situation allowing for that news flash, can you?\" Gifford replied, \"Absolutely. I can see it.\" Gifford later told Cosell, \"Don't hang on it. It's a tragic moment and this is going to shake up the whole world.\"\n\nOn air, Gifford prefaced the announcement saying, \"And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, you have got to say what we know in the booth.\" Cosell then replied:<ref>{{cite web|title=John Lennon shot 12-8-80 Howard Cosell tells the world twice John Lennon was dead.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n73GFvAyIjs|work=YouTube|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Yes, we have to say it.

Lennon once appeared on ''Monday Night Football'', during the December 9, 1974 telecast of a 23\u201317 [[1974 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] win over the [[1974 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]], and was interviewed for a short breakaway segment by Cosell.\n\nABC had obtained this scoop as a result of the coincidence of an ABC employee, Alan Weiss, being at the same emergency room that Lennon was brought to that night.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/behind-cosells-announcement-of-lennons-death|title=Behind Cosell's Announcement of Lennon's Death|author=Toni Monkovic |department=The Fifth Down: ''The New York Times'' N.F.L.

He made news and covered topics that were not part of general sports coverage - including the first story about drugs in professional sports (the story of former [[Minnesota Vikings|Minnesota Viking]] [[Carl Eller]]'s [[cocaine]] use), an in-depth look at how NFL owners negotiated tax breaks and incentives for building new stadiums, and together with [[Arthur Ashe]], an investigation into apartheid and sports. Though [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] were low, Cosell and his staff earned three [[Emmy Award]]s for excellence in reporting, and broke new ground in sports journalism.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cosell, Howard - 1993 Hall of Fame Inductee|url=http://www.americansportscastersonline.com/cosell.html|website=American Sportscasters Online|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}</ref>  At the time, ''ABC SportsBeat'' was the first and only regularly scheduled network program devoted solely to sports journalism.\n\nTo produce this pioneering program, Cosell recruited a number of employees from outside the ranks of those that produced games, who he felt might be too invested in the success of the athletes and leagues to look at the hard news. He brought in Michael Marley, then a sportswriter for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Lawrie Mifflin, a writer for ''[[The New York Times]]'', and a 20-year old researcher who quickly rose to an associate producer, Alexis Denny. As a sophomore at [[Yale University]], Ms. Denny had been a student in a seminar that Cosell taught on the \"Business of Big-Time Sports in America\", and was selected by the Director of ''Monday Night Football'' to join their production crew. She took her junior year off to join Cosell's staff at [[American Broadcasting Company#Facilities and studios|ABC Headquarters]] in New York City, and produced many segments, including in 1983 a half-hour special report previewing the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympic Games]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ribowsky|first1=Mark|title=Howard Cosell: The Man, The Myth and the Transformation of American Sports|url=https://archive.org/details/howardcosellmanm00ribo|url-access=registration|date=Nov 14, 2011|publisher=W.W.Horton}}</ref> Despite the games being one of ABC's biggest investments, with a record-breaking 225 million dollar rights fee at the time,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Murray R.|title=American Sports: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tfTXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA947&lpg=PA947#v=onepage|accessdate=August 6, 2015|isbn=9780313397530}}</ref> the 30 minute documentary-style program produced by Denny showed many sides of the questions about the viability of the games themselves\u2014from concerns about traffic, pollution and terrorism, to a look at how the sponsorship deals were structured.\n\nIn his 1985 autobiography, Cosell reflected on his highly diverse work, and concluded that the ''SportsBeat'' series had been his favorite.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Non-sports-related appearances==\nCosell's colorful personality and distinctive voice were featured to fine comedic effect in several sports-themed episodes of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV series ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]''.  His feuds with [[New York City]] [[sportswriter]] [[Oscar Madison]] ([[Jack Klugman]]) mirrored the real life feuds he had with some of New York's leading sportswriters.  He also appeared in the [[Woody Allen]] films ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'', ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' and ''[[Broadway Danny Rose]]''. Such was his celebrity that while he never appeared on the show, Cosell's name was frequently used as an all-purpose answer on the popular 1970s [[game show]] ''[[Match Game]]''. Cosell also had a cameo in the 1988 movie ''[[Johnny Be Good]]'' featuring [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Anthony Michael Hall]] and [[Uma Thurman]]. His particular speech pattern was also imitated by one of the characters in the film ''[[Better Off Dead (film)|Better Off Dead]]''.\n\nCosell's national fame was further boosted in fall 1975 when ''[[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell]]'' aired on Saturday evenings on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. This was an hour-long [[variety show]], broadcast live from the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] in [[New York City]] and hosted by Cosell, which is not to be confused with the NBC series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (which coincidentally also premiered in 1975 under its original title of ''NBC's Saturday Night'', to avoid confusion with Cosell's show). Despite bringing a young comedian, [[Billy Crystal]], to national prominence and for showcasing the American TV debut of the [[Bay City Rollers]] (who later had a hit song by the name of \"[[Saturday Night (Bay City Rollers song)|Saturday Night]]\"), Cosell's show was canceled after three months. Cosell later hosted the 1984-1985 [[season finale]] of ''Saturday Night Live''.\n\nCosell was the announcer of [[Frank Sinatra]]'s 1974 ABC television special ''[[Sinatra \u2013 The Main Event (TV program)|Sinatra \u2013 The Main Event]]''.<ref name=\"Terrace2013\">{{cite book|author=Vincent Terrace|title=Television Specials: 5,336 Entertainment Programs, 1936-2012, 2d ed.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Of0QAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA157|date=June 19, 2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-1240-9|page=157}}</ref>\n\nCosell appeared alongside Muhammad Ali, Frank Sinatra, Richie Havens, and others on a 1976 spoken word novelty record, ''[[The Adventures of Ali and His Gang vs. Mr. Tooth Decay]]''.<ref name=RSJun16>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/remembering-muhammad-alis-trippy-anti-cavity-kids-record-20160606|title=Remembering Muhammad Ali's Trippy, Anti-Cavity Kids' Record|author=Jason Heller|date=June 6, 2016|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=July 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1976, Cosell hosted a series of specials known as ''[[Battle of the Network Stars]]''. The two-hour specials pitted stars from each of the three broadcast networks against each other in various physical and mental competitions. Cosell hosted all but one of the nineteen specials, including the final one airing in 1988.\n\n==Criticism of boxing==\nCosell denounced professional [[boxing]] during the broadcast of a November 26, 1982 WBC heavyweight championship bout between titleholder [[Larry Holmes]] and a clearly outmatched [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]] at the [[Astrodome]]. The fight was held two weeks after the fatal fight between [[Ray Mancini]] and [[Duk Koo Kim]], when Kim died shortly after the fight. Cosell famously asked the [[rhetorical question]], \"I wonder if that referee [Steve Crosson] understands that he is constructing an advertisement for the abolition of the very sport that he's a part of?\"<ref name=HolmesCobb>{{cite web|title=Larry Holmes vs Tex Cobb - 4/4|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xswSNKUj6qk#t=403|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref>  Cosell, horrified over the brutality of the one-sided fight, said that if the referee did not stop the fight he would never broadcast a professional fight again.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMajor boxing reforms were later implemented, the most important of which allows referees to stop clearly one-sided fights early in order to protect the health of the fighters. In amateur boxing, one-sided fights would be automatically stopped if one fighter had a score considerably higher than his opponent. Hitherto, only the ring physician had the authority to halt a bout. Another change was the reduction of championship bouts from fifteen rounds to twelve rounds by the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]]. (The fatal blows to Kim were in Rounds thirteen and fourteen.) The [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] quickly followed suit, and the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] did so in 1988. Cosell did not cut off ties with the [[United States Amateur Boxing Federation]]. His 1984 broadcasts of the Olympic Trials, box-offs, and the [[Boxing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Summer Olympics boxing tournament]], all of which were at the amateur level with much shorter fights, were his last professional calls of the sport.\n\n==''I Never Played the Game'', and reaction==\nAfter Cosell's memoir ''I Never Played the Game'', which, among other things, chronicled his disenchantment with fellow ABC commentators, was published in September 1985, Cosell was taken off scheduled announcing duties for that year's [[1985 World Series|World Series]] and was dismissed by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC television]] shortly thereafter. Cosell's book was seen by many as a bitter \"hate rant\" against those who had offended him. ''[[TV Guide]]'' published excerpts of his memoirs and reported that they had never had as many viewers' responses and they were overwhelmingly negative towards Cosell. The magazine reported some of the \"printable\" ones saying things such as \"[[Will Rogers]] never met Howard Cosell\".\n\nIn ''I Never Played the Game'', Cosell popularized the word \"jockocracy\" (originally coined by author [[Robert Lipsyte]]), describing how athletes were given announcing jobs that they had not earned. Coincidentally, he was replaced for the 1985 World Series broadcast by [[Tim McCarver]], himself a former baseball player, to join [[Al Michaels]] and [[Jim Palmer]]. (The title of the book is a [[double entendre]], meaning that Cosell never actually played the game of football or any other professional sport he broadcast as well as implying that he never played the \"game\" of corporate politics.) Cosell is notably absent from the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/football/nfl/08/02/cosell/index.html |work=Sports Illustrated |first=Marky |last=Billson |title=As strange as it sounds, Howard Cosell has never won Rozelle award |date=August 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>[https://www.sportsbroadcastjournal.com/missing-howard-cosell-has-still-not-won-pro-football-hofs-rozelle-award-for-broadcast-excellence/ Missing: Howard Cosell has still not won Pro Football Hall of Fame's Rozelle Award]</ref>\n\nIn his later years, Cosell briefly hosted his own television [[talk show]], ''Speaking of Everything'', authored his last book (''What's Wrong With Sports''), and continued to appear on radio and television, becoming more outspoken about his criticisms of sports in general.\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1993, Cosell was inducted into the [[International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=22291|title=Howard Cosell|work=wwnorton.com}}</ref> A year later, in 1994, he was inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame]]. He was also the 1995 recipient of the [[Arthur Ashe Courage Award]]. After his wife of 46 years, Mary Edith Abrams Cosell (known as \"Emmy\") died from a massive heart attack in 1990, Cosell largely withdrew from the public eye and his health began failing. A longtime smoker, he was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] in 1991, and had surgery to remove a cancerous [[tumor]] in his chest. He also had several minor [[stroke]]s, and was diagnosed with [[Cardiovascular disease|heart]] and [[Nephropathy|kidney disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]].\n\n==Death==\nCosell died at [[Hospital for Joint Diseases]] in Manhattan on April 23, 1995 of a cardiac embolism at the age of 77.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |title=Howard Cosell, Outspoken Sportscaster On Television and Radio, Is Dead at 77 |url=http://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/packages/html/sports/year_in_sports/04.25.html|author=[[Robert McG.

He graduated with a [[bachelor's degree]] in English from [[New York University]], where he was a member of [[Pi Lambda Phi]] fraternity and [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. He then earned a law degree at [[New York University School of Law]], where he was a member of the law review.\n\nThe name of Cosell's grandfather was changed by immigration authorities when he entered the United States; Howard Cosell said he changed his name from \"Cohen\" to \"Cosell\" while a law student as a way to honor his father and grandfather by reverting to a version of his family's original [[Polish language|Polish]] name.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bloom |first=John |date=2010 |title=There You Have it: The Life, Legacy, and Legend of Howard Cosell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRirlKfG3J0C&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q=howard%20cosell%20changed%20name%20polish |location=Amherst, MA |publisher=University of Massachusetts Press |page=67 |isbn=978-1-55849-837-2}}</ref>\n\n===Military service===\nCosell was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in the state of New York in 1941, but when the United States entered [[World War II]] at the end of that year he was commissioned in the [[United States Army]] as an officer with its [[United States Army Transportation Corps|Transportation Corps]]. In 1944 he married Mary Edith Abrams in a judge's chambers in [[Brooklyn]]. At the war's conclusion in 1945, he was discharged from the United States Army with the rank of [[Major (United States)|major]].\n\n===Early legal career===\nAfter the war, Cosell began practicing law in [[Manhattan]], primarily union law. Some of his clients were actors, and some were athletes, including [[Willie Mays]]. Cosell's own hero in athletics was [[Jackie Robinson]], who served as a personal and professional inspiration to him in his career.\n\n==Career==\n===Introduction to broadcasting===\nCosell represented the [[Little League]] of New York, when in 1953, Hal Neal (president ABC Radio), then an [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]] manager, asked him to host a show on New York flagship [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] featuring Little League participants. The show marked the beginning of a relationship with WABC and ABC Radio that would last his entire broadcasting career.\n\nCosell hosted the Little League show for three years without pay, and then decided to leave the law to become a full-time broadcaster. He approached [[Robert Pauley]], President of ABC Radio, with a proposal for a weekly show. Pauley told him the network could not afford to develop untried talent, but he would be put on the air if he would get a sponsor. To Pauley's surprise, Cosell came back with a relative's shirt company as a sponsor, and \"Speaking of Sports\" was born.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/business/media/14pauley.html Robert Pauley, Former Head of ABC Radio, Dies at 85], ''The New York Times'', May 14, 2009.</ref>\n\nCosell took his \"tell it like it is\" approach when he teamed with the ex\u2013[[Brooklyn Dodgers]] pitcher \"Big ''Numba'' Thirteen\" [[Ralph Branca]] on WABC's pre- and post-game [[Radio programming|radio shows]] of the [[New York Mets]] in their nascent years beginning in 1962. He pulled no punches in taking members of the hapless [[expansion team]] to task.\n\nOtherwise on radio, Cosell did his show, ''Speaking of Sports'', as well as sports reports and updates for affiliated [[radio station]]s around the country; he continued his radio duties even after he became prominent on television. Cosell then became a sports anchor at [[WABC-TV]] in New York, where he served in that role from 1961 to 1974. He expanded his commentary beyond sports to a radio show entitled ''Speaking of Everything''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1987/09/02/cosell-gets-back-in-the-picture/61f7b279-6f64-442c-8e73-3af9caccf4e2/|title=COSELL GETS BACK IN THE PICTURE|first=Norman|last=Chad|date=September 2, 1987|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\n===Rise to prominence, supports black athletes===\nCosell rose to prominence in the early-1960s, covering boxer [[Muhammad Ali]], beginning from the time he fought under his [[Name at birth|birth name]], Cassius Clay. The two seemed to have an affinity despite their different personalities, and complemented each other in broadcasts. Cosell was one of the first sportscasters to refer to the boxer as Muhammad Ali after he changed his name, and supported him when he refused to be inducted into the military. Cosell was also an outspoken supporter of Olympic sprinters [[John Carlos]] and [[Tommie Smith]], after they raised their fists in a [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|\"black power\" salute during their 1968 medal ceremony]] in [[Mexico City]]. In a time when many sports broadcasters avoided touching social, racial, or other controversial issues, and kept a certain level of collegiality towards the sports figures they commented on, Cosell did not, and indeed built a reputation around his [[catchphrase]], \"I'm just telling it like it is.\"\n\nCosell's style of reporting transformed [[sports broadcasting]] in the United States. Whereas previous sportscasters had mostly been known for [[color commentary]] and lively [[play-by-play]], Cosell had an intellectual approach. His use of analysis and context brought television sports reporting closer to \"hard\" news reporting. However, his distinctive [[staccato]] voice, [[New York City English|accent]], [[syntax]], and [[cadence (music)|cadence]] were a form of color commentary all their own.\n\nCosell earned his greatest interest from the public when he backed Ali after the boxer's championship title was stripped from him for refusing military service during the [[Vietnam War]]. Cosell found vindication several years later when he was able to inform Ali that the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] had unanimously ruled in favor of Ali in ''[[Clay v. United States]]''.\n\nCosell called most of Ali's fights immediately before and after the boxer returned from his three-year exile in October 1970. Those fights were broadcast on taped delay usually a week after they were transmitted on closed circuit. However, Cosell did not call two of Ali's biggest fights, the [[Rumble in the Jungle]] in October 1974 and the first [[Fight of the Century|Ali\u2013Joe Frazier bout]] in March 1971. Promoter [[Jerry Perenchio]] selected actor [[Burt Lancaster]], who had never provided color commentary for a fight, to work the bout with longtime announcer [[Don Dunphy]] and former light-heavyweight champion [[Archie Moore]]. Cosell attended that fight as a spectator only. He would do a [[voice-over]] of that bout, when it was shown on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] a few days before the second [[Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier II|Ali-Frazier bout]] in January 1974.\n\nPerhaps his most famous call took place in the [[George Foreman#The Sunshine Showdown vs. Joe Frazier|fight]] between [[Joe Frazier]] and [[George Foreman]] for the World Heavyweight Championship in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] in 1973. When Foreman knocked Frazier to the mat the first of six times, roughly two minutes into the first round, Cosell yelled out:\n\n{{quote|Down Goes Frazier! Down Goes Frazier! Down Goes Frazier!}}\n\nHis call of Frazier's first trip to the mat became one of the most quoted phrases in American sports broadcasting history. Foreman beat Frazier by a [[Technical knockout|TKO]] in the second round to win the [[World heavyweight boxing championship|World Heavyweight Championship]].\n\nCosell provided blow-by-blow commentary for ABC of some of boxing's biggest matches during the 1970s and the early-1980s, including [[Ken Norton]]'s upset win over Ali in 1973 and Ali's defeat of [[Leon Spinks]] in 1978 recapturing the heavyweight title for the third time. His signature [[toupee]] was unceremoniously knocked off in front of live ABC cameras when a scuffle broke out after a broadcast match between [[Scott LeDoux]] and Johnny Boudreaux. Cosell quickly retrieved his hairpiece and replaced it. During interviews in studio with Ali, the champion would tease and threaten to remove the hairpiece with Cosell playing along but never allowing it to be touched. On one of these occasions, Ali quipped, \"Cosell, you're a phony, and that thing on your head comes from the tail of a pony.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5294873|title=Ali and Cosell, Irresistible Enigmas|website=NPR.org}}</ref>\n\nWith typical headline generating drama, Cosell abruptly ended his broadcast association with the sport of boxing while providing coverage for ABC for the heavyweight championship bout between [[Larry Holmes]] and [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]] on November 26, 1982. Halfway through the bout and with Cobb absorbing a beating, Cosell stopped providing anything more than rudimentary comments about round number and the participants punctuated with occasional declarations of disgust during the 15 rounds. He declared shortly after the fight to a national television audience that he had broadcast his last professional boxing match.\n\nCosell also was an ABC commentator for the television broadcast of the second of the two famous 1973 \"[[Battle of the Sexes (tennis)|Battles of the Sexes]]\" tennis matches, this one between [[Bobby Riggs]] and [[Billie Jean King]].\n\n===Feuds===\nDuring Cosell's tenure as a sportscaster, he frequently clashed with longtime ''[[New York Daily News]]'' sports columnist [[Dick Young (sportswriter)|Dick Young]], who rarely missed an opportunity to denigrate the broadcaster in print as an \"ass\", a \"shill\", or most often, \"Howie the Fraud\". Young would sometimes stand near Cosell and shout profanities so that the audio he was taping for his radio show would be unusable. Writing about Cosell, sportswriter [[Jimmy Cannon]] sniped, \"This is a guy who changed his name, put on a toupee and tried to convince the world that he tells it like it is.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20105742,00.html |title=The Mouth That Roared|author=William Plummer|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}</ref> He further added, \"If Howard Cosell were a sport, he'd be [[roller derby]].\"<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1006539/index.htm Nack, William. \"Telling It Like It Is\", ''Sports Illustrated'', May 1, 1995].</ref>\n\nCosell, according to longtime [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[racecaster]] [[Chris Economaki]], \"had an enormous and monumental ego, and may have been the most pompous man I've ever met.\" Cosell ripped Economaki for a miscue in an interview with [[Cale Yarborough]] for ABC \"(and he) never let me forget that\". At an ABC [[Christmas]] party Economaki's wife asked to be introduced to Cosell and Chris said, \"{{'}}Howard, for some inexplicable reason my wife wants to meet you...' and it (ticked) him off to no end. He really took it personally.\"<ref>Economaki, Chris (with Dave Argabright) (2006) ''LET 'EM ALL GO! The Story of Auto Racing by the Man Who Was There'' (Fisher, IN: Books By Dave Argabright), p. 191. {{ISBN|0-9719639-3-2}}.</ref>\n\n===''Monday Night Football''===\nIn [[1970 NFL season|1970]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[executive producer]] for sports [[Roone Arledge]] hired Cosell to be a [[color commentator|commentator]] for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' (MNF), the first time in 15 years that [[American football]] was broadcast weekly in [[prime time]]. Cosell was accompanied most of the time by ex-football players [[Frank Gifford]] and [[Don Meredith|\"Dandy\" Don Meredith]].\n\nCosell was openly contemptuous of ex-athletes appointed to prominent sportscasting roles solely on account of their playing fame. He regularly clashed on-air with Meredith, whose laid-back style was in sharp contrast to Cosell's more critical approach to the games.\n\nThe Cosell-Meredith-Gifford dynamic helped make ''Monday Night Football'' a success; it frequently was the number one rated program in the [[Nielsen ratings]]. Cosell's inimitable style distinguished ''Monday Night Football'' from previous sports programming, and ushered in an era of more colorful broadcasters and [[24/7 service|24/7]] TV sports coverage.\n\nIt was during his ''MNF'' run that Cosell coined a phrase that came to be so identified with football that other announcers and spectators\u2014notably [[Chris Berman]]\u2014began to repeat it. An ordinary kickoff return began with Cosell giving commentary about a player's difficult life. It became extraordinary when he suddenly observed, \"He could go all the way!\" As evidenced by the thousands of websites that cite Cosell's quote, many sports commentators consider this to be one of the most famous sports quips of all time.\n\nAlso during his ''MNF'' run, after a 4 September 1978 NFL game, Cosell popularized the term \"[[nachos]]\".<ref>{{cite web | last = Munsey | last2 = Suppes | title = Arlington Stadium | work = Ballparks| url = http://www.ballparks.com/baseball/american/arling.htm | accessdate = 2008-12-30}}</ref>\n\n===Olympics===\nAlong with ''Monday Night Football'', Cosell worked the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] for [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]]. He played a key role on ABC's coverage of the [[Palestinian political violence|Palestinian terror]] group [[Black September (group)|Black September]]'s [[mass murder]] of [[Israel]]i athletes in [[Munich massacre|Munich]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]; providing reports directly from the [[Olympic Park|Olympic Village]] (his image can be seen and voice heard in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Munich (film)|film]] about the terror attack).\n\nIn the [[Boxing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Summer Games in Montreal]], and the [[Boxing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 games in Los Angeles]], Cosell was the main voice for boxing. [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] won the gold medal in his light welterweight class at Montreal, beginning his meteoric rise to a world professional title a few years later, and Cosell became close to Leonard, during this period, announcing many of his fights.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"I Never Played The Game\", by Howard Cosell, 1985</ref>\n\n===\"The Bronx is burning\"===\nCosell was widely attributed with saying the famous phrase \"the Bronx is burning\". Cosell is credited with saying the quote during Game 2 of the [[1977 World Series]], which took place in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] on October 12, 1977. For a couple of years, fires had routinely erupted in the South [[The Bronx|Bronx]], mostly due to owners of low-value properties burning their own real estate for [[insurance]] money. During the bottom of the first inning, an ABC aerial camera panned a few blocks from Yankee Stadium to a building on fire. The scene became a defining image of New York City in the 1970s. Cosell supposedly stated, \"There it is, ladies and gentlemen, The Bronx is burning.\"<ref name=nypost>{{cite news| url=https://nypost.com/2010/05/16/why-the-bronx-burned/ | work=New York Post | first=Joe | last=Flood | title=Why the Bronx Burned | date=May 16, 2010}}</ref> This was later picked up by presidential candidate [[Ronald Reagan]], who then made a special trip to the Bronx, to illustrate the failures of politicians to address the issues in that part of New York City.\n\nIn 2005, author Jonathan Mahler published ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx Is Burning]]'', a book about New York in 1977, and credited Cosell with the title quote during the aerial coverage of the fire. [[ESPN]] produced a 2007 [[Miniseries|mini-series]] based on the book ''[[The Bronx Is Burning]]''. Cosell's comment seemed to have captured the widespread view that New York City was in a state of decline.\n\nThe truth was discovered after Major League Baseball published a complete DVD set of all of the games of the 1977 World Series. Coverage of the fire began with [[Keith Jackson]]'s comments regarding the enormity of the blaze, while Cosell added that [[Jimmy Carter|President Jimmy Carter]] had visited that area just days before. At the top of the second inning, the fire was once again shown from a helicopter-mounted camera, and Cosell commented that the [[New York City Fire Department|New York Fire Department]] had a hard job to do in the Bronx as there were always numerous fires. In the bottom of the second, Cosell informed the audience that it was an abandoned building that was burning and no lives were in danger. There was no further comment on the fire, and Cosell appears to have never said \"The Bronx is Burning\" (at least not on camera) during Game 2.<ref name=nypost/>\n\nMahler's confusion could have arisen from a 1974 documentary entitled ''The Bronx Is Burning'': it is likely Mahler confused the documentary with his recollection of Cosell's comments when writing his book.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bestblog.mlblogs.com/archives/2007/08/did_howard_cose_1.html |title=Did Howard Cosell Really Say, \"The Bronx Is Burning\"?|accessdate=2009-12-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213023329/http://bestblog.mlblogs.com/archives/2007/08/did_howard_cose_1.html |archivedate=December 13, 2010  }}</ref>\n\n===Reports the death of John Lennon===\n{{main|Murder of John Lennon}}\nOn the night of December 8, 1980, during a ''Monday Night Football'' game between the [[1980 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] and the [[1980 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], Cosell shocked the television audience by interrupting his regular commentary duties to deliver a news bulletin on the murder of [[John Lennon]] in the midst of a live broadcast. Word had been passed to Cosell and Frank Gifford by [[Roone Arledge]], who was president of ABC's news and sports divisions at the time, near the end of the game.\n\nCosell was initially apprehensive about announcing Lennon's death. Off the air, Cosell conferred with Gifford and others saying \"Fellas, I just don't know, I'd like your opinion. I can't see this game situation allowing for that news flash, can you?\" Gifford replied, \"Absolutely. I can see it.\" Gifford later told Cosell, \"Don't hang on it. It's a tragic moment and this is going to shake up the whole world.\"\n\nOn air, Gifford prefaced the announcement saying, \"And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, you have got to say what we know in the booth.\" Cosell then replied:<ref>{{cite web|title=John Lennon shot 12-8-80 Howard Cosell tells the world twice John Lennon was dead.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n73GFvAyIjs|work=YouTube|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Yes, we have to say it.

Lennon once appeared on ''Monday Night Football'', during the December 9, 1974 telecast of a 23\u201317 [[1974 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] win over the [[1974 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]], and was interviewed for a short breakaway segment by Cosell.\n\nABC had obtained this scoop as a result of the coincidence of an ABC employee, Alan Weiss, being at the same emergency room that Lennon was brought to that night.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/behind-cosells-announcement-of-lennons-death|title=Behind Cosell's Announcement of Lennon's Death|author=Toni Monkovic |department=The Fifth Down: ''The New York Times'' N.F.L.

Sean, age 5, was not watching television at the time as it was near midnight, and Ono was able to break the news to him.<ref>[[ESPN]] ''[[Outside the Lines]] First Report'', December 8, 2010</ref> NBC beat ABC to the punch, however, interrupting ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' just minutes before Cosell's announcement with a \"breaking news\" segment.<ref name=LennonAnnouncement>{{cite web|title=NBC TV bulletin - John Lennon is dead|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvcydIVLthM|work=YouTube|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Sports journalism and ''ABC SportsBeat'' magazine show===\nIn the fall of [[1981 in American television|1981]], Cosell debuted a serious investigative 30-minute magazine show, ''[[SportsBeat|ABC SportsBeat]]'' on ABC's weekend schedule.  He made news and covered topics that were not part of general sports coverage - including the first story about drugs in professional sports (the story of former [[Minnesota Vikings|Minnesota Viking]] [[Carl Eller]]'s [[cocaine]] use), an in-depth look at how NFL owners negotiated tax breaks and incentives for building new stadiums, and together with [[Arthur Ashe]], an investigation into apartheid and sports. Though [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] were low, Cosell and his staff earned three [[Emmy Award]]s for excellence in reporting, and broke new ground in sports journalism.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cosell, Howard - 1993 Hall of Fame Inductee|url=http://www.americansportscastersonline.com/cosell.html|website=American Sportscasters Online|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}</ref>  At the time, ''ABC SportsBeat'' was the first and only regularly scheduled network program devoted solely to sports journalism.\n\nTo produce this pioneering program, Cosell recruited a number of employees from outside the ranks of those that produced games, who he felt might be too invested in the success of the athletes and leagues to look at the hard news. He brought in Michael Marley, then a sportswriter for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Lawrie Mifflin, a writer for ''[[The New York Times]]'', and a 20-year old researcher who quickly rose to an associate producer, Alexis Denny. As a sophomore at [[Yale University]], Ms. Denny had been a student in a seminar that Cosell taught on the \"Business of Big-Time Sports in America\", and was selected by the Director of ''Monday Night Football'' to join their production crew. She took her junior year off to join Cosell's staff at [[American Broadcasting Company#Facilities and studios|ABC Headquarters]] in New York City, and produced many segments, including in 1983 a half-hour special report previewing the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympic Games]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ribowsky|first1=Mark|title=Howard Cosell: The Man, The Myth and the Transformation of American Sports|url=https://archive.org/details/howardcosellmanm00ribo|url-access=registration|date=Nov 14, 2011|publisher=W.W.Horton}}</ref> Despite the games being one of ABC's biggest investments, with a record-breaking 225 million dollar rights fee at the time,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Murray R.|title=American Sports: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tfTXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA947&lpg=PA947#v=onepage|accessdate=August 6, 2015|isbn=9780313397530}}</ref> the 30 minute documentary-style program produced by Denny showed many sides of the questions about the viability of the games themselves\u2014from concerns about traffic, pollution and terrorism, to a look at how the sponsorship deals were structured.\n\nIn his 1985 autobiography, Cosell reflected on his highly diverse work, and concluded that the ''SportsBeat'' series had been his favorite.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Non-sports-related appearances==\nCosell's colorful personality and distinctive voice were featured to fine comedic effect in several sports-themed episodes of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV series ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]''.  His feuds with [[New York City]] [[sportswriter]] [[Oscar Madison]] ([[Jack Klugman]]) mirrored the real life feuds he had with some of New York's leading sportswriters.  He also appeared in the [[Woody Allen]] films ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'', ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' and ''[[Broadway Danny Rose]]''. Such was his celebrity that while he never appeared on the show, Cosell's name was frequently used as an all-purpose answer on the popular 1970s [[game show]] ''[[Match Game]]''. Cosell also had a cameo in the 1988 movie ''[[Johnny Be Good]]'' featuring [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Anthony Michael Hall]] and [[Uma Thurman]]. His particular speech pattern was also imitated by one of the characters in the film ''[[Better Off Dead (film)|Better Off Dead]]''.\n\nCosell's national fame was further boosted in Fall 1975 when ''[[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell]]'' aired on Saturday evenings on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. This was an hour-long [[variety show]], broadcast live from the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] in [[New York City]] and hosted by Cosell, which is not to be confused with the NBC series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (which coincidentally also premiered in 1975 under its original title of ''NBC's Saturday Night'', to avoid confusion with Cosell's show). Despite bringing a young comedian, [[Billy Crystal]], to national prominence and for showcasing the American TV debut of the [[Bay City Rollers]] (who later had a hit song by the name of \"[[Saturday Night (Bay City Rollers song)|Saturday Night]]\"), Cosell's show was canceled after three months. Cosell later hosted the 1984-1985 [[season finale]] of ''Saturday Night Live''.\n\nCosell was the announcer of [[Frank Sinatra]]'s 1974 ABC television special ''[[Sinatra \u2013 The Main Event (TV program)|Sinatra \u2013 The Main Event]]''.<ref name=\"Terrace2013\">{{cite book|author=Vincent Terrace|title=Television Specials: 5,336 Entertainment Programs, 1936-2012, 2d ed.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Of0QAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA157|date=June 19, 2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-1240-9|page=157}}</ref>\n\nCosell appeared alongside Muhammad Ali, Frank Sinatra, Richie Havens, and others on a 1976 spoken word novelty record, ''[[The Adventures of Ali and His Gang vs. Mr. Tooth Decay]]''.<ref name=RSJun16>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/remembering-muhammad-alis-trippy-anti-cavity-kids-record-20160606|title=Remembering Muhammad Ali's Trippy, Anti-Cavity Kids' Record|author=Jason Heller|date=June 6, 2016|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=July 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1976, Cosell hosted a series of specials known as ''[[Battle of the Network Stars]]''. The two-hour specials pitted stars from each of the three broadcast networks against each other in various physical and mental competitions. Cosell hosted all but one of the nineteen specials, including the final one airing in 1988.\n\n==Criticism of boxing==\nCosell denounced professional [[boxing]] during the broadcast of a November 26, 1982 WBC heavyweight championship bout between titleholder [[Larry Holmes]] and a clearly outmatched [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]] at the [[Astrodome]]. The fight was held two weeks after the fatal fight between [[Ray Mancini]] and [[Duk Koo Kim]], when Kim died shortly after the fight. Cosell famously asked the [[rhetorical question]], \"I wonder if that referee [Steve Crosson] understands that he is constructing an advertisement for the abolition of the very sport that he's a part of?\"<ref name=HolmesCobb>{{cite web|title=Larry Holmes vs Tex Cobb - 4/4|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xswSNKUj6qk#t=403|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref>  Cosell, horrified over the brutality of the one-sided fight, said that if the referee did not stop the fight he would never broadcast a professional fight again.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMajor boxing reforms were later implemented, the most important of which allows referees to stop clearly one-sided fights early in order to protect the health of the fighters. In amateur boxing, one-sided fights would be automatically stopped if one fighter had a score considerably higher than his opponent. Hitherto, only the ring physician had the authority to halt a bout. Another change was the reduction of championship bouts from fifteen rounds to twelve rounds by the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]]. (The fatal blows to Kim were in Rounds thirteen and fourteen.) The [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] quickly followed suit, and the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] did so in 1988. Cosell did not cut off ties with the [[United States Amateur Boxing Federation]]. His 1984 broadcasts of the Olympic Trials, box-offs, and the [[Boxing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Summer Olympics boxing tournament]], all of which were at the amateur level with much shorter fights, were his last professional calls of the sport.\n\n==''I Never Played the Game'', and reaction==\nAfter Cosell's memoir ''I Never Played the Game'', which, among other things, chronicled his disenchantment with fellow ABC commentators, was published in September 1985, Cosell was taken off scheduled announcing duties for that year's [[1985 World Series|World Series]] and was dismissed by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC television]] shortly thereafter. Cosell's book was seen by many as a bitter \"hate rant\" against those who had offended him. ''[[TV Guide]]'' published excerpts of his memoirs and reported that they had never had as many viewers' responses and they were overwhelmingly negative towards Cosell. The magazine reported some of the \"printable\" ones saying things such as \"[[Will Rogers]] never met Howard Cosell\".\n\nIn ''I Never Played the Game'', Cosell popularized the word \"jockocracy\" (originally coined by author [[Robert Lipsyte]]), describing how athletes were given announcing jobs that they had not earned. Coincidentally, he was replaced for the 1985 World Series broadcast by [[Tim McCarver]], himself a former baseball player, to join [[Al Michaels]] and [[Jim Palmer]]. (The title of the book is a [[double entendre]], meaning that Cosell never actually played the game of football or any other professional sport he broadcast as well as implying that he never played the \"game\" of corporate politics.) Cosell is notably absent from the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/football/nfl/08/02/cosell/index.html |work=Sports Illustrated |first=Marky |last=Billson |title=As strange as it sounds, Howard Cosell has never won Rozelle award |date=August 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>[https://www.sportsbroadcastjournal.com/missing-howard-cosell-has-still-not-won-pro-football-hofs-rozelle-award-for-broadcast-excellence/ Missing: Howard Cosell has still not won Pro Football Hall of Fame's Rozelle Award]</ref>\n\nIn his later years, Cosell briefly hosted his own television [[talk show]], ''Speaking of Everything'', authored his last book (''What's Wrong With Sports''), and continued to appear on radio and television, becoming more outspoken about his criticisms of sports in general.\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1993, Cosell was inducted into the [[International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=22291|title=Howard Cosell|work=wwnorton.com}}</ref> A year later, in 1994, he was inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame]]. He was also the 1995 recipient of the [[Arthur Ashe Courage Award]]. After his wife of 46 years, Mary Edith Abrams Cosell (known as \"Emmy\") died from a massive heart attack in 1990, Cosell largely withdrew from the public eye and his health began failing. A longtime smoker, he was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] in 1991, and had surgery to remove a cancerous [[tumor]] in his chest. He also had several minor [[stroke]]s, and was diagnosed with [[Cardiovascular disease|heart]] and [[Nephropathy|kidney disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]].\n\n==Death==\nCosell died at [[Hospital for Joint Diseases]] in Manhattan on April 23, 1995 of a cardiac embolism at the age of 77.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |title=Howard Cosell, Outspoken Sportscaster On Television and Radio, Is Dead at 77 |url=http://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/packages/html/sports/year_in_sports/04.25.html|author=[[Robert McG.
