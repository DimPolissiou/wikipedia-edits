H\u00e9ctor & Tito released their [[Violencia Musical|first album]] in 1998. Together they became [[reggaeton]] stars releasing several successful albums and making appearances in several compilations, becoming one of the most sought-out duos in the genre. Both became the first reggaeton artists to sell out a massive concert in Puerto Rico, opening the path to other artists such as [[Tego Calder\u00f3n]], [[Daddy Yankee]], [[Don Omar]], and [[Wisin & Yandel]]. As a duet both captured the world's attention and made reggaeton a popular genre, winning awards such as the ''Billboard'' Latin Music Award for Latin rap album of the year for their album ''A La Reconquista''.<ref>Bambino CD Inaugurating Roc La Familia by Billboard Music.

The suburb has long been home to Australia's most notable billionaires.\n\nIn 2018, Bellevue Hill was found to be the most expensive suburb in Australia, with the highest median house price of $5.4 million. In 2019, Bellevue Hill was also recognised as one of wealthiest suburbs in Australia, with one of the highest taxable income averages in the country.\n\n==History==\nIn the early 19th century, Irish-Australian immigrants referred to the area as Vinegar Hill, after the [[Battle of Vinegar Hill]], an engagement during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 uprising]] of the [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]] in south-east [[Ireland]]. [[Lachlan Macquarie|Governor Lachlan Macquarie]] took great exception to this and decided to name the suburb Bellevue Hill, the ''belle vue'' meaning ''beautiful view''.<ref>The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon, Angus and Robertson, 1990, page 25</ref>\n\nLater in that century, Bellevue Hill became the home of the Fairfax family, who lived at ''Trahlee'', in Ginahgulla Road, which was leased by James Fairfax from 1866 to 1878. They then moved to [[Ginahgulla]] (now known as Fairfax House and owned by [[The Scots College]]) in the same road. The Fairfax family were responsible for establishing the [[Fairfax Media]] empire, which became a major force in the Australian news media (see also [[John Fairfax]]).\n\n===Former tram service===\n{{main|Trams in Sydney}} {{Further|Public transport in Sydney}}\nThe line to Bellevue Hill opened in 1909. Services operated from Circular Quay via Elizabeth Street and Park Street. Trams heading south from Circular Quay down Elizabeth Street swung left into [[Park St, Sydney|Park Street]], via a right turn into Yurong Street, a left turn into Stanley Street, a right turn into Bourke Street, then a left turn into Burton Street.\n\nA feature was the tram only viaduct over Barcom Ave and Boundary Street in [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]] as the line headed into MacDonald Street. This viaduct is now a road bridge. The line then twisted down Glenmore, Gurner and Hargreave Streets in [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], then Moncur and Queen Streets in Woollahra. Here, a connection to [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]] allowed access to the Waverley Depot. The line then travelled down Edgecliff and Victoria Roads, then wound along Birriga Road in Bellevue Hill, finally running down Curlewis Street in Bondi to join the Bondi Beach via Bondi Junction line on Campbell Parade, to the North Bondi terminus. The line was double track throughout with numerous points to allow short working.\n\nThe line was cut back to Ocean Street, Woollahra in 1955; the remainder closed on 27 June 1959.\n\nThe line followed approximately the current route of bus [[300 series bus routes, Sydney|389]] between the city and Woollahra and route X84 between Woollahra and Bondi Beach.\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the [[Census in Australia#2011|2011 census]] of Population, there were 10,765 residents in Bellevue Hill. 56.3% of residents were born in Australia.

The historic [[Queen_Anne_Style_architecture#Australian Queen Anne style|Queen Anne]] home [[Caerleon, Bellevue Hill|Caerleon]] was sold for $22 million in January 2008.<ref>Sydney Morning Herald, 25 January 2008, page 3</ref> This price was surpassed by the $23 million paid for a mansion in Victoria Road in November 2009. The mansion had previously been used by the [[France|French]] consulate since 1955. One person who inspected it was actor [[Russell Crowe]], who subsequently did not take part in the bidding. The house was bought by [[Lachlan Murdoch]].<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/money/property/lachlan-murdoch-buys-bellevue-hill-property-le-manoir-for-23m/story-e6frfmd0-1225794860352 Lachlan Murdoch buys Bellevue Hill property Le Manoir for $23m ]</ref>\n\nActress [[Toni Collette]] sold her Bellevue Hill home in August 2009 for $6.4 million.

The suburb is located within the [[Division of Wentworth]] electorate, which is the wealthiest in Australia. The suburb has long been home to Australia's most notable billionaires. \n\nIn 2018, Bellevue Hill was found to be the most expensive suburb in Australia, with the highest median house price of $5.4 million. In 2019, Bellevue Hill was also found to be one of the wealthiest suburbs in Australia, with one of the highest taxable income averages in the country.\n\n==History==\nIn the early 19th century, Irish-Australian immigrants referred to the area as Vinegar Hill, after the [[Battle of Vinegar Hill]], an engagement during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 uprising]] of the [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]] in south-east [[Ireland]]. [[Lachlan Macquarie|Governor Lachlan Macquarie]] took great exception to this and decided to name the suburb Bellevue Hill, the ''belle vue'' meaning ''beautiful view''.<ref>The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon, Angus and Robertson, 1990, page 25</ref>\n\nLater in that century, Bellevue Hill became the home of the Fairfax family, who lived at ''Trahlee'', in Ginahgulla Road, which was leased by James Fairfax from 1866 to 1878. They then moved to [[Ginahgulla]] (now known as Fairfax House and owned by [[The Scots College]]) in the same road. The Fairfax family were responsible for establishing the [[Fairfax Media]] empire, which became a major force in the Australian news media (see also [[John Fairfax]]).\n\n===Former tram service===\n{{main|Trams in Sydney}} {{Further|Public transport in Sydney}}\nThe line to Bellevue Hill opened in 1909. Services operated from Circular Quay via Elizabeth Street and Park Street. Trams heading south from Circular Quay down Elizabeth Street swung left into [[Park St, Sydney|Park Street]], via a right turn into Yurong Street, a left turn into Stanley Street, a right turn into Bourke Street, then a left turn into Burton Street.\n\nA feature was the tram only viaduct over Barcom Ave and Boundary Street in [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]] as the line headed into MacDonald Street. This viaduct is now a road bridge. The line then twisted down Glenmore, Gurner and Hargreave Streets in [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], then Moncur and Queen Streets in Woollahra. Here, a connection to [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]] allowed access to the Waverley Depot. The line then travelled down Edgecliff and Victoria Roads, then wound along Birriga Road in Bellevue Hill, finally running down Curlewis Street in Bondi to join the Bondi Beach via Bondi Junction line on Campbell Parade, to the North Bondi terminus. The line was double track throughout with numerous points to allow short working.\n\nThe line was cut back to Ocean Street, Woollahra in 1955; the remainder closed on 27 June 1959.\n\nThe line followed approximately the current route of bus [[300 series bus routes, Sydney|389]] between the city and Woollahra and route X84 between Woollahra and Bondi Beach.\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the [[Census in Australia#2011|2011 census]] of Population, there were 10,765 residents in Bellevue Hill. 56.3% of residents were born in Australia.

The [[Rona, Bellevue Hill|''Rona'']] Estate, located on Ginahgulla Road, sold for close to $60 million in 2018, making it one of Australia's most expensive homes. The historic [[Queen_Anne_Style_architecture#Australian Queen Anne style|Queen Anne]] home [[Caerleon, Bellevue Hill|Caerleon]] was sold for $22 million in January 2008.<ref>Sydney Morning Herald, 25 January 2008, page 3</ref> This price was surpassed by the $23 million paid for a mansion in Victoria Road in November 2009. The mansion had previously been used by the [[France|French]] consulate since 1955. One person who inspected it was actor [[Russell Crowe]], who subsequently did not take part in the bidding. The house was bought by [[Lachlan Murdoch]].<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/money/property/lachlan-murdoch-buys-bellevue-hill-property-le-manoir-for-23m/story-e6frfmd0-1225794860352 Lachlan Murdoch buys Bellevue Hill property Le Manoir for $23m ]</ref>\n\nActress [[Toni Collette]] sold her Bellevue Hill home in August 2009 for $6.4 million.
