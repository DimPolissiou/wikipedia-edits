The skin lesions observed in the early stage last for weeks or months. The skin lesions are highly infectious, and the spirochetes in the lesions are transmitted by direct contact. The lesions regress as the immune response develops against ''T. pallidum''. The latent stage that results lasts a lifetime in many cases. In a minority of cases, the disease exits latency and enters a tertiary phase, in which destructive lesions of skin, bone, and cartilage ensue. Unlike yaws and bejels, syphilis in its tertiary stage often affects the heart, eyes, and nervous system as well.<ref name=Giacani2014/>\n\n===Syphilis===\n{{Main|Syphilis}}\n\n''T. p. pallidum'' is a motile spirochaete that is generally acquired by close [[sexually transmitted disease|sexual contact]], entering the host via breaches in squamous or columnar [[epithelium]]. The organism can also be transmitted to a fetus by [[placenta|transplacental]] passage during the later stages of pregnancy, giving rise to congenital syphilis. The helical structure of ''T. p. pallidum'' allows it to move in a corkscrew motion through mucous membranes or enter minuscule breaks in the skin.  In women the initial lesion is usually on the labia, the walls of the vagina, or the cervix; in men it is on the shaft or glans of the penis.<ref name = \"Radolf_1996\" /> It gains access to the host's blood and lymph systems through tissue and mucous membranes. In more severe cases, it may gain access to the host by infecting the skeletal bones and central nervous system of the body.<ref name=\"Radolf_1996\" />\n\nThe incubation period for a ''T. p. pallidum'' infection is usually around 21 days, but can range from 10 days to 90 days.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis-detailed.htm | title = STD Facts \u2013 Syphilis (Detailed) | publisher = Centers for Disease Control (CDC) | access-date = 2017-04-19 }}</ref>\n\n==Laboratory identification==\n[[Image:Treponema pallidum - very high mag - extreme crop.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Micrograph]] showing ''T. pallidum'' (black and thin) \u2013 [[Dieterle stain]]]]\n''T. pallidum'' was first microscopically identified in syphilitic chancres by [[Fritz Schaudinn]] and [[Erich Hoffmann]] at the [[Charit\u00e9]] in Berlin in 1905.<ref name=\"Schaudinn1905\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Schaudinn|first1=Fritz Richard|last2=Hoffmann|first2=Erich|authorlink2=Erich Hoffmann|year=1905|title=Vorl\u00e4ufiger Bericht \u00fcber das Vorkommen von Spirochaeten in syphilitischen Krankheitsprodukten und bei Papillomen|trans-title=Preliminary report on the occurrence of Spirochaetes in syphilitic chancres and papillomas|url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_TPkAAAAAYAAJ#page/n535/mode/2up|journal=[[Arbeiten aus dem Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamte]]|volume=22|pages=527\u2013534|authorlink1=Fritz Richard Schaudinn|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> This bacterium can be detected with special stains, such as the [[Dieterle stain]].

The skin lesions observed in the early stage last for weeks or months. The skin lesions are highly infectious, and the spirochetes in the lesions are transmitted by direct contact. The lesions regress as the immune response develops against ''T. pallidum''. The latent stage that results lasts a lifetime in many cases. In a minority of cases, the disease exits latency and enters a tertiary phase, in which destructive lesions of skin, bone, and cartilage ensue. Unlike yaws and bejels, syphilis in its tertiary stage often affects the heart, eyes, and nervous system as well.<ref name=Giacani2014/>\n\n===Syphilis===\n{{Main|Syphilis}}\n\n''T. p. pallidum'' is a motile spirochaete that is generally acquired by close [[sexually transmitted disease|sexual contact]], entering the host via breaches in squamous or columnar [[epithelium]]. The organism can also be transmitted to a fetus by [[placenta|transplacental]] passage during the later stages of pregnancy, giving rise to congenital syphilis. The helical structure of ''T. p. pallidum'' allows it to move in a corkscrew motion through mucous membranes or enter minuscule breaks in the skin.  In women the initial lesion is usually on the labia, the walls of the vagina, or the cervix; in men it is on the shaft or glans of the penis.<ref name = \"Radolf_1996\" /> It gains access to the host's blood and lymph systems through tissue and mucous membranes. In more severe cases, it may gain access to the host by infecting the skeletal bones and central nervous system of the body.<ref name=\"Radolf_1996\" />\n\nThe incubation period for a ''T. p. pallidum'' infection is usually around 21 days, but can range from 10 days to 90 days.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis-detailed.htm | title = STD Facts \u2013 Syphilis (Detailed) | publisher = Centers for Disease Control (CDC) | access-date = 2017-04-19 }}</ref>\n\n==Laboratory identification==\n[[Image:Treponema pallidum - very high mag - extreme crop.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Micrograph]] showing ''T. pallidum'' (black and thin) \u2013 [[Dieterle stain]]]]\n''T. pallidum'' was first microscopically identified in syphilitic chancres by [[Fritz Schaudinn]] and [[Erich Hoffmann]] at the [[Charit\u00e9]] in Berlin in 1905.<ref name=\"Schaudinn1905\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Schaudinn|first1=Fritz Richard|last2=Hoffmann|first2=Erich|authorlink2=Erich Hoffmann|year=1905|title=Vorl\u00e4ufiger Bericht \u00fcber das Vorkommen von Spirochaeten in syphilitischen Krankheitsprodukten und bei Papillomen|trans-title=Preliminary report on the occurrence of Spirochaetes in syphilitic chancres and papillomas|url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_TPkAAAAAYAAJ#page/n535/mode/2up|journal=[[Arbeiten aus dem Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamte]]|volume=22|pages=527\u2013534|authorlink1=Fritz Richard Schaudinn|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> This bacterium can be detected with special stains, such as the [[Dieterle stain]].

It is [[chef-lieu]] of the [[Maine-et-Loire]] [[departments of France|department]] and was the capital of the province of [[Anjou]] until the [[French Revolution]]. The inhabitants of both the city and the province are called ''Angevins''. Not including the metropolitan area, Angers is the third most populous commune in northwestern France after [[Nantes]] and [[Rennes]] and the 17th in France.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/ppp/bases-de-donnees/recensement/populations-legales/france-departements.asp|title=Population municipale, donn\u00e9es l\u00e9gales de population en vigueur \u00e0 partir du 1er janvier 2011|work=INSEE}}</ref>\n\nFor centuries, Angers was an important stronghold in northwestern France. It was the cradle of the [[Plantagenet]] dynasty and became one of the intellectual centers of Europe during the reign of [[Ren\u00e9 of Anjou]]. Angers developed at the confluence of three rivers, the [[Mayenne (river)|Mayenne]], the [[Sarthe (river)|Sarthe]], and the [[Loir (river)|Loir]], all coming from the north and flowing south to the [[Loire (river)|Loire]]. Their confluence, just north of Angers, creates the [[Maine (river)|Maine]], a short but wide river that flows into the Loire several kilometres south. The Angers metropolitan area is a major economic centre in western France, particularly active in industry, horticulture, and tourism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mgm.fr/ARECLUS/page_auteurs/rozen_veuro.pdf|title=\u00c9tude comparative des villes europ\u00e9ennes}}</ref>\n\nAngers proper covers {{convert|42.70|sqkm|sp=us|sigfig=3}}<ref name=\"linternaute\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.linternaute.com/ville/ville/donnee/562/angers.shtml|title=City data on \"L'Internaute\"}}</ref> and has a population of 147,305 inhabitants, while around 394,700 live in its metropolitan area. The [[Communaut\u00e9 urbaine Angers Loire M\u00e9tropole|Angers Loire M\u00e9tropole]] is made up of 30 communes covering {{convert|540|km\u00b2|0|abbr=off|sp=us}} with 287,000 inhabitants.\n\nAngers enjoys a rich cultural life, made possible by its universities and museums. The old medieval center is still dominated by the massive [[ch\u00e2teau d'Angers|ch\u00e2teau]] of the [[Plantagen\u00eat]]s, home of the ''[[Apocalypse Tapestry]]'', the biggest medieval tapestry ensemble in the world. Angers is also both at the edge of the [[Val de Loire]], a [[World Heritage Site]], and the [[regional natural parks of France|Loire-Anjou-Touraine regional natural park]].\n\n==Toponymy==\n\n===Etymology===\n[[File:Angers Merian 1657.jpg|thumb|left|The town is called ''Andegavum Angers'' on this 1657 engraving]]\nThe city is first mentioned by [[Ptolemy]] around {{sc|ad}}&nbsp;150 in his ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]''.

The name is a compound of the Latin name [[Julius]] (probably in reference to [[Julius Caesar]]) and the [[Proto-Celtic|Celtic]] ''magos'', \"market\". Similar town dedications were common in [[Roman Gaul]], and toponyms often kept a Gallic element.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Les noms de lieux |editor= Presses universitaires de France |author=[[Charles Rostaing]]|year=1945 | place=Paris |isbn=2-13-038660-1 |page=59}}</ref> When the location needed to be distinguished from other Juliomagi, it was known as '''Juliomagus Andecavorum''' (\"Juliomagus of the [[Andecavi]]\"), in reference to the principal Gallic tribe in and around the city.<ref>Charles Rostaing, ''Op. cit.'', p. 47</ref>\n\nAround {{sc|ad}}&nbsp;400, the city came to be referred to as the '''civitas Andecavorum''' (\"[[civitas|tribal capital]] of the Andecavi\").

The walls were last reconstructed between 1230 and 1240, by order of [[Louis IX of France|King Louis IX]].<ref>''Historique du ch\u00e2teau d'Angers'', Inventaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du patrimoine culturel</ref> Today, portions of the wall are still visible in Rue Toussaint and on Boulevard Carnot, as are some towers, like the ''Tour Villebon'' and the ''Tour des Anglais''.\n\nBefore the first [[cadastre]] (1810), the city had not extended much beyond its medieval limits: on and around the castle promontory, with some dwellings on the other bank of the Maine in a neighbourhood called ''La Doutre''. That part of the city developed quickly during the industrial revolution and became a big river port. Industry was encouraged by firms like Bessonneau (textile factories) and [[Cointreau]] (distillery). After 1850, many suburbs appeared around the train stations and the slate quarries to the south in [[Tr\u00e9laz\u00e9]]. Despite the port in La Doutre, demographic growth and urban extension were more significant on the eastern bank of the Maine, where the former Juliomagus had been founded.\n\nThe medieval city center was redeveloped and expanded from 1791. The ''Place du Ralliement'', the main square, was then built in place of three churches destroyed during the [[French Revolution]] and, later, ring boulevards planted with trees replaced the city walls. The architectural style used is mainly [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|Haussmanian]], but there are also some [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]], [[Art Nouveau]] or [[Art Deco]] buildings.\n\nAfter 1945 and the [[Second World War]], several large [[council estate]]s made of tower blocks were built around the city center, the first of them being Belle-Beille in 1953. Industrial activity changed drastically: port activity declined while new factories, such as [[Technicolor SA]] in 1957, were built. During the 1970s, the collective approach to urban development gave way to more individual houses being built for the [[middle class]]. As the metropolitan area continued to grow, commuting became more common.  New shopping areas were constructed close to the villages which had been subsumed into the city. Because of the floodplains that surround the city north and south, Angers can only grow significantly on an east\u2013west axis.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Tour des anglais, Angers (1).jpg|The ''Tour des Anglais'', a remaining part of the medieval city walls\nFile:Ardoise d' Angers.jpg|Traditional slated roof\nFile:Angers Oisellerie.jpg |Half-timbered houses in rue de l'Oisellerie\nFile:Vue sur la Doutre, Angers.jpg|View of La Doutre; the industrial port has become a marina\nFile:Angers - Tramway - Place du Ralliement.jpg|The Place du Ralliement\nFile:Nouvelles Galeries (Angers).jpg|A department store on a 19th-century street\nFile:Facade-hlmroseraieangers.jpg|A council estate in La Roseraie\n</gallery>\n\n===Green areas===\n[[File:douves jardins Angers.JPG|thumb|Gardens in the [[ch\u00e2teau d'Angers|castle]] moat.]]\nBeing both at the edge of the [[Val de Loire]] World Heritage site and on the largest river confluence in France,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.angers.fr/projets-et-politiques/rives-nouvelles/rives-nouvelles/index.html |title=Rives Nouvelles |work=www.angers.fr |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622235042/http://www.angers.fr/projets-et-politiques/rives-nouvelles/rives-nouvelles/index.html |archivedate=22 June 2012 }}</ref> Angers has a high natural potential, notably highlighted by the Saint-Aubin island, situated north of the center and covering a tenth of the city total surface. Protected, the island is formed of swamps and natural meadows.\n\nThe oldest green areas date back from the [[Renaissance]], when the moats of the castle were transformed into pleasure and kitchen gardens. Similar gardens were built by the aristocracy around their [[h\u00f4tel particulier|h\u00f4tels particuliers]] and medicinal gardens were planted in hospices cloisters. The Jardin des plantes, the first [[botanical garden]], dates back from the beginning of the 18th century. During the 19th century, others were built, for example the Faculty of Pharmacy garden and the Roseraie. The first recreational parks, for their part, were built during the [[Second French Empire]]. The [[\u00e9tang Saint-Nicolas]], made by a sluice on a small river, the Brionneau, was protected as early as 1936.\n\nThe Jardin du Mail (''Mall Garden''), an esplanade situated outside the ring boulevards, was built between 1820 and 1880 on the former Champs de Mars (Fields of Mars, a place where the garrisons used to train and parade). Another esplanade, the Mail [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], was built in 1999 together with a garden inside the new Saint-Serge business district. During the 1960s the old gravel pits around the Maine were filled with water to form the Lac de Maine, which now hosts a marina. In 2010, a large amusement park, [[Terra Botanica]], was inaugurated close to Saint-Aubin island.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Ile Saint-Aubin-2.jpg|The Saint-Aubin island protected area\nFile:Angers 2008 PD 01.JPG|Planted quays around the river Maine\nFile:Fontaine du Mail - Angers - 20080803.JPG|Jardin du Mail\nFile:Angers lac de maine.jpg|Sunset on the Lac de Maine\nFile:Terra Botanica Angers.JPG|[[Terra Botanica]]\n</gallery>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Angers}}\n\n===Prehistory and Antiquity===\n[[File:Brozen Sword.jpg|upright=0.5|thumb|A model of a sword from the [[Bronze Age]] discovered in the 2000s in the Maine riverbed]]\nThe first sign of human presence in Angers dates back to around 400,000&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qTfGDA70tGUC&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=angers+400+000+bc&source=bl&ots=zF-Y_GImhq&sig=ACfU3U3sAVQz6cod878KCuxZy_BDNaMq9A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjf9K7srbnnAhWCB80KHf0LBAoQ6AEwFHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=angers%20400%20000%20bc&f=false|title=From an Irish Market Town|last=Rogers|first=Joe|publisher=Publishamerica Inc|year=2011|isbn=978-1456043087|location=|pages=128}}</ref> Vestiges from the [[Neolithic]] are more abundant and include numerous polished stone axes.

By the end of the [[Age of Iron|Iron Age]], Angers was a relatively densely populated [[oppidum|hillfort]]. While the settlement's Roman name&mdash;Juliomagus&mdash;may be older, it is only attested from the 3rd century. The Roman town consisted of many villas and baths and had an amphitheater as well as a [[Mithraeum]], a temple dedicated to [[Mithra]].\n\nSuccessive Germanic invasions in {{sc|ad}}&nbsp;275 and 276 forced the inhabitants to move to the highest point of their city and to build a wall around a small area of around {{convert|9|ha|sp=us}}.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Loire Maine Angers2 tango7174.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Angers|castle]], seat of the [[Plantagen\u00eat]] dynasty]]\nAngers received its first [[Bishop of Angers|bishop]] in 372 during the election of [[Martin of Tours]].

In September 851, [[Charles the Bald]] and [[Erispoe]], a Breton chief, met in the town to sign the [[Battle of Jengland|Treaty of Angers]], which secured Breton independence and fixed the borders of [[Brittany]]. However, the situation remained dangerous for Angers, and Charles the Bald created in 853 a wide buffer zone around Brittany comprising parts of [[Anjou]], [[Touraine]], [[Maine (province)|Maine]] and [[S\u00e9es]], which was ruled by [[Robert the Strong]], a great-grandfather of [[Hugh Capet]].\n\nIn 870, the [[Viking]] chief [[Hastein]] seized Angers where he settled until a successful siege temporarily displaced him. He again took control of the town in 873,<ref>Michel Dillange.

Around 929, he took the title of count (earl) of Angers and founded the first Anjou dynasty, the [[House of Ingelger]] (''French: Ingelgeriens''). Angers subsequently formed the capital of the [[French province|province]] of [[Anjou]].{{sfnp|EB|1878}}\n\nDuring the 12th century, after internal divisions in [[Brittany]], the county of Nantes was annexed by [[Anjou]]. [[Henry II of England|Henry II Plantagen\u00eat]] kept it for more than 30 years. The grandson of [[Henry I of England]], he also succeeded to the English crown and ruled the vast [[Angevin Empire]], which stretched from the [[Pyrenees]] to [[Ireland]].<ref>''Le duch\u00e9 de Bretagne et la politique Plantagen\u00eat aux XII et XIII siecles'', Judith Everard.  \u00bb, ''in'' Marin Aurell and No\u00ebl-Yves Tonnerre \u00e9diteurs.

The Empire disappeared in 1204\u20131205 when the King of France, [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], seized [[Normandy]] and [[Anjou]]. Henceforth there were no more counts of [[County of Anjou|Anjou]], as the French king had made Anjou a dukedom.\n\nNow a part of the [[Kingdom of France]], Angers became the \"Key to the Kingdom\" ({{lang|fr|Cl\u00e9 du Royaume}}) facing still independent [[Brittany]]. In 1228, during [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]]'s minority, [[Blanche of Castile]] decided to fortify the city and to rebuild the castle. Later, during the 1350s and 1360s, the schools of Law, Medicine and Theology, renowned in [[Europe]], were organized into a university. In 1373, [[Louis I, Duke of Anjou|Louis I of Naples and Anjou]] ordered the six tapestries illustrating the [[Apocalypse]] of St John known today as the ''[[Apocalypse Tapestry]]''.\n\n===Renaissance===\n[[File:King Rene and Jeanne de Lavalle. Louvre.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ren\u00e9 of Anjou|Ren\u00e9 of Naples and Anjou]], nicknamed ''Good King Ren\u00e9'', and his second wife, [[Jeanne de Laval]]]]\nKing [[Ren\u00e9 of Anjou]] contributed to the economic revival in a city that had been diminished by the [[Black Death]] (1347\u20131350) and the [[Hundred Years War]] (1337\u20131453). A man of great culture and generosity, Ren\u00e9 transformed Angers into a cultural and political center and held court there. He transformed the castle moat into a [[menagerie]] and built several gardens. He also founded in Angers a new [[Ordre du Croissant]] which was supposed to compete with the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], created several years earlier.\n\nIn 1474, [[Louis XI of France]], in his attempt to conquer Anjou, came to Angers with his army, asking for the keys of the city.<ref>Histoire de Ren\u00e9 d'Anjou, Louis Fran\u00e7ois Villeneuve-Bargemont tome II (1446\u20131476) Editions J. J. Blaise, Paris : 1825</ref> Ren\u00e9, then 65 years old, did not want to lead a war against his nephew and surrendered his domains without a fight. Thus, Anjou ceased to be an [[appanage]] and fell into the Royal domain. After his death, Ren\u00e9 was buried in 1480 in [[Angers Cathedral|Saint-Maurice cathedral]].\n\n[[File:Angers - Logis Barrault (2).jpg|thumb|The ''Logis Barrault'', where the [[Edict of Nantes]] was prepared]]\nIn 1551, Angers became the seat of a [[bailiwick]] and the [[pr\u00e9sidial]] of a jurisdiction, a position the city kept until 1790. At the same time, with the growth of [[Protestantism]] in France, a Catholic was placed at the head of the city and its castle while the [[bourgeoisie]] formed a Catholic militia to protect Angers from the [[Huguenots]]. The bishop, [[Gabriel Bouvery]], organized on his side an \"Angevin League\".\n\nWhen the news of the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] reached Angers, another massacre took place in the city. The bodies of slain Protestants were thrown into the [[Mayenne (river)|Mayenne]]. It was the [[aldermen]] who stopped the slaughter.<ref>Pierre Miquel, ''Op. cit.'', p. 286</ref>\n\nIn 1598, the [[Edict of Nantes]] was prepared by [[Henri IV of France|Henri IV]] in Angers. From 6 March until 2 April, Angers was the ''de facto'' capital of France and the King tried all means to satisfy the Catholics of the city, for example by laying the cornerstone of the new Capucine convent.\n\n===Classical period===\nIn 1619, [[Louis XIII of France]] gave the governance of [[Anjou]] to his mother, [[Marie de' Medici]]. The Queen Mother settled in Angers, at the Logis Barrault, with her chaplain, [[Cardinal Richelieu]].\n\nAt the premature death of Louis XIII in 1643, his son [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] was only an infant. France was troubled at this time by several famines and epidemics, and by political instability. In 1649, the people of Angers revolted against rising taxes, the start of the [[Fronde]] in [[Anjou]]. The [[Fronde]] was a nationwide military conflict opposing some aristocrats wanting more autonomy and the Royal forces loyal to [[Anne of Austria]] as Queen Mother and Regent, and her prime minister, [[Cardinal Mazarin]]. Royalist repression in Angers was narrowly averted by Bishop [[Henri Arnauld]], who interceded with the Queen Mother. Arnauld, who would remain Bishop of Angers until 1692, was to leave a deep mark on the religious life of the city during the second half of the 17th century.\n\nIn 1652, [[Henri Chabot]], Duke of [[Duchy of Rohan|Rohan]] and governor of [[Anjou]], decided to back [[Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9|Louis of Cond\u00e9]], leader of the [[Fronde]]. Angers again became rebellious and [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] sent his army to seize it. The Duke of Rohan immediately surrendered and thus again prevented the sack of the city.\n\n===French Revolution===\n[[File:Cahier Angers.jpg|thumb|left|200px|One of the [[cahiers de dol\u00e9ances]] written in Angers in 1789]]\nThe first months of the [[French Revolution]] were relatively quiet in Angers. In 1789, the city lost its ancient administrative positions, replaced in 1790 by the [[department of France|department]] of ''Mayenne-et-Loire'', soon renamed \"[[Maine-et-Loire]]\". [[Anjou]], as a political entity, disappeared, although the new department included most of its territory.\n\nThe [[War in the Vend\u00e9e|War of Vend\u00e9e]], a Royalist rebellion and [[counterrevolution]] led in [[Vend\u00e9e]], a department located at the southwest of [[Maine-et-Loire]], reached the [[Loire (river)|Loire]] in March 1793. The Royalist army soon crossed the river and progressed as far as [[Granville, Manche|Granville]], in [[Normandy]], in November. Pushed back, the Vend\u00e9ens went back south and, to cross the Loire again, had to attack Angers.\n\nThe city was defended by 4,000 Republican soldiers, whereas the Royalists were at least 20,000, but weakened by successive fights and deceases. The [[Siege of Angers]] occurred on 3 and 4 December 1793. The Royalists' bad tactics, as well as the strength of Angers city wall and castle, caused their loss. They consequently went back north for a while, around [[Le Mans]], before crossing the [[Loire (river)|Loire]] at [[Ancenis]] on 16 December.\n\nIn 1794, fierce repression was conducted in the whole region against the Royalists. In Angers, 290 prisoners were shot and 1020 died of illness in jail.<ref>Jacques Hussenet (dir.), ''\u00ab D\u00e9truisez la Vend\u00e9e ! \u00bb'', p. 452\u2013453.</ref> The city also welcomed many refugees, mostly Republicans living in Royalist rural areas. Between 19 and 31 May 1793, between 650 and 1000 Republican families sought asylum in Angers.<ref>Guy-Marie Lenne, ''Les R\u00e9fugi\u00e9s de la guerre de Vend\u00e9e'', p. 20\u201325</ref>\n\n===Since 1800===\n[[File:Pont de Segr\u00e9 (1).jpg|thumb|The ''Pont de Segr\u00e9'', a truss railroad bridge built on the Maine during the second half of the 19th century]]\nDuring the 19th century, the city was deeply influenced by the urban transformations in [[Paris]]. The city traditionally had a somewhat sombre appearance from the quantity of local [[slate]] used in construction but many quarters were gradually destroyed, redeveloped, or rebuilt on the Parisian model.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} The city wall, which formed a square around the old city core, was demolished around 1850 and replaced by wide boulevards. New districts of the city were also opened up on the opposite bank of the river.{{sfnp|EB|1878}}\n\nIn 1849, the Angers-[[Saumur]] railway was built; it was extended to [[Nantes]] two years later. When completed, the line connected [[Paris]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]].\n\nIn 1850, a [[catastrophic failure]] of the [[Angers Bridge|Basse-Cha\u00eene]] suspension bridge caused the deaths of over 200 soldiers. The disaster inhibited the construction of [[suspension bridge]]s in France for two decades. The accident was mainly caused by soldiers' lilting march which created [[resonance]] in the bridge structure.<ref>[http://www.art-et-histoire.com/index4o.php?segreap.php?Angers Base de connaissance Art et Histoire]</ref>\n\nIn 1875, a \"free faculty\" was created. It was soon assimilated to the medieval Angevin University ({{lang|la|Universitas Andegavensis}}), which had been dissolved during the [[French Revolution]]. The new faculty was canonically erected as the Catholic University of Angers ({{lang|fr|[[Catholic University of the West|Universit\u00e9 catholique d'Angers]]}}) by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1879. However, in 1890, a law prohibited private institutions of higher education from calling themselves \"universities\". The institution was then renamed the \"Free Faculty of Angers\" ({{lang|fr|Facult\u00e9 libre d'Angers}}), although it kept its original name on an informal basis. At the beginning of the 20th century, two higher education establishments, specializing in agriculture and commercial sciences, were opened.\n\n[[File:Fontaine du Mail zoomed - Angers - 20080803.JPG|thumb|left|The fountain in ''Jardin du Mail'', built for the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Exposition Universelle]] in [[Paris]]]]\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, several [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]] buildings were constructed, such as the ''Nouvelles Galeries'', the ''Hotel des Postes'', ''Hotel Continental'', the ''Alcazar'' and the ''Maison bleue''.\n\nIn September 1939, when [[Poland]] was invaded by Germany, the [[Polish government-in-exile]] settled in Angers. It left the city on 12 June 1940, after the invasion of France by the [[Wehrmacht]]. Angers fell to the [[Nazi]]s during the same month. The Germans made it the seat of a regional Kommandantur. In 1941, a first [[Resistance during World War II|Resistance]] movement, called ''Honneur et Patrie'', was created in Angers. 60 Resistants were shot at the Belle-Beille range in 1942 and a German bunker factory employed 6000 people in 1943.<ref>[http://lesplantagenets.fr/index.php Lesplantagenets.fr]</ref> In July 1942, 853 Jews were arrested and sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]].<ref name=\"culture.cg49.fr\">{{cite web|url=http://culture.cg49.fr/le-patrimoine/histoire/dhier-a-aujourdhui/|title=L'Anjou dans la seconde guerre mondiale|editor=Conseil general de Maine-et-Loire}}</ref>\n\nOn the night of 28 May 1944, the first Allied bombing occurred over the Saint-Laud quarter. 243 people died and many others were wounded.

To seize Angers, they decided to enter the city by its eastern side to surprise the Nazis. On 9 August, they crossed the Maine and started the fight. Helped by the local [[French Forces of the Interior]], they progressively moved forward to the city center. The fight was nevertheless difficult and Angers was liberated the day after, at around 5 p.m.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.angers.fr/decouvrir-angers/histoire-d-angers/chroniques-historiques/pour-s-informer/aout-1944-angers-est-liberee/index.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130213142103/http://www.angers.fr/decouvrir-angers/histoire-d-angers/chroniques-historiques/pour-s-informer/aout-1944-angers-est-liberee/index.html |url-status = dead|archive-date=2013-02-13 |title=Ao\u00fbt 1944.

In 1971, a decision was made to reestablish a public university, and the Universit\u00e9 catholique d'Angers was split between the [[Catholic University of the West|Universit\u00e9 catholique de l'Ouest]] (private) and the [[University of Angers|Universit\u00e9 d'Angers]] (public). Angers continues to have two different universities.\n\nUntil the 1980s, Angers experienced several massive urban development plans, such as the construction of the Lac de Maine, and several vast council estates and shopping malls, as well as the construction of a highway which crossed the city through its center, a project that forced the destruction of many old buildings and destroyed the original quays on the Maine. Later, other urban plans were drawn up, with a new emphasis on nature and heritage protection, as well as on social mixing. During the 1990s, the redevelopment of the Saint-Serge quarter, located just north of the historical center, produced a new business center, gardens and university buildings.\n[[File:View of Angers on the Maine river from the castle.jpg|thumb|center|550px|View of Angers and the Maine river]]\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:Angers - Palais de justice (1).jpg|thumb|The court of appeal in the ''Jardin du Mail'']]\nAngers received its communal charter from [[Louis XI of France]] in February 1475, but free elections for the [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] and [[aldermen]] were not guaranteed before 1484, following a decision by [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]]. Since then, 75 successive mayors have governed Angers.\n\nAngers was until the [[Second World War]] mainly governed by [[centrism|centrist]] and republican mayors. From 1977 until 2014, all the successive mayors were been members of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], whereas the [[Maine-et-Loire]] department has always been governed by moderate [[right-wing]] parties. The current mayor is [[Christophe B\u00e9chu]].\n\nAngers is divided into eight [[canton (France)|cantons]]; most of them include parts of Angers plus some surrounding communes. These cantons are not administrative entities and only serve to elect the members of the department council. The [[INSEE]], the French institute for statistics, divides the commune of Angers into twelve sectors. Depending on their social and economic issues, some of them can have priority for financial assistance and urban regeneration. In Angers, five are considered as priority sectors, three as sensitive urban areas, and one as an urban free zone.\n\nBeing the [[chef-lieu]] of [[Maine-et-Loire]], Angers is the seat of a [[pr\u00e9fectures in France|prefecture]]. It is also the seat of a  [[Court of Appeal (France)|Court of Appeal]] and of several regional or local institutes, concerning for example, customs, education or science.

In the mid-19th century, the principal manufactures were goods for [[sailing ship]]s ([[sailcloth]] and [[rope]]), [[linen]] and [[hosiery|hose]], [[sugar]], [[leather]], [[wax]], and [[oil]], as well as agricultural products (mainly [[wheat]], [[wine]], and [[fruit]]).{{sfnp|EB|1878}} By the time of the [[First World War]], [[Cointreau]] had developed the distillation of [[liqueur]]s from the area's fruit to an industrial level. The work for sailing ships was still carried on but [[steamship]]s had greatly reduced demand. Instead, local companies produced [[Electrical cable|cable]]s, [[wire]]s, and [[thread (yarn)|thread]] and increased production of [[footwear]], [[umbrella]]s, and [[parasol]]s. The area's vineyards focused on [[sparkling wine]] and fruit was increasingly [[preserved fruit|preserved]] for sale elsewhere. The area had also developed a small-scale [[textile industry]] and begun producing machines, as well as commercial-scale production of [[hemp]] and [[flower]]s.{{sfnp|EB|1911}}\n\nPresent-day Angers provides 45.7% of the [[Maine-et-Loire]] job positions. It is the 22nd-largest national job provider and the 3rd-largest one in northwestern France after [[Nantes]] and [[Rennes]].

A second line is scheduled for 2018\u20132022. Besides the tram, Irigo also organizes the bus network in Angers consisting of 13 urban lines and 12 suburban lines.\n\nThe bus station, situated outside the [[Gare d'Angers-Saint-Laud|Angers Saint-Laud]] train station, is a hub for the departmental bus network (''Anjoubus'') and is also served by international bus companies.\n\nAngers is on both the [[Nantes]]-[[Paris]] and [[Nantes]]-[[Lyon]] railways. The city has several train stations, all originally built in the 19th century. Some are still in use; others are closed or reserved for freight.  The main station, [[Gare d'Angers-Saint-Laud|Angers Saint-Laud]], is on a [[TGV]] line and has direct [[TGV]] services to [[Paris]] (1 hour 30 minutes), [[Lyon]] (3 hours 45 minutes), [[Strasbourg]] (4 hours 35 minutes), and [[Lille]] (3 hours 25 minutes), as well as [[Avignon]], [[Marseilles]] and [[Montpellier]]. Regional trains go to [[Cholet]], [[Saumur]], [[Tours]], [[Blois]], [[Nevers]] and [[Bourges]].\n\nThe nearest airport is [[Angers - Loire Airport]], which replaced in 1998 an older airport near the Saint-Aubin island. The airport is located in the commune of [[Marc\u00e9]], {{convert|20|km|0|sp=us|abbr=off}} from Angers and close to the A11 and the A85.

Its site has been occupied since antiquity; the castle itself was built between 1230 and 1240 by [[Louis IX of France]]. The massive walls are about one kilometer long and punctuated by 17 towers; they were built with horizontal slices of [[tuff]] and [[schist]], giving it strength and an original striped look. During the 15th century, a chapel and the Ch\u00e2telet were added in the courtyard.\n\nThe ''{{Interlanguage link|Maison d'Adam|fr}}'' (\"Adam's House\"), located behind the cathedral, is an excellent example of the half-timbered houses which were built during the [[Middle Ages]]. Many similar houses, although smaller, are also visible along the streets around the castle. The city also displays several [[Renaissance]] and [[classical architecture|classical]] [[h\u00f4tel particulier|h\u00f4tels particuliers]], the most renowned being the ''Logis Pinc\u00e9'' from the 16th century. The ''Maison bleue'' (\"Blue House\"), built in 1927, is an [[Art Deco]] masterpiece. The former seat of the French Aviation Company ({{lang|fr|Compagnie fran\u00e7aise d'Aviation}}) was built in 1938 and abandoned during the [[Second World War]]. Totally refurbished in 2004, it is now a testimony to 1930s architecture.\n\nThe [[Angers Cathedral|Saint-Maurice cathedral]] is a major landmark in the cityscape, with its two spires culminating at {{convert|75|m|sp=us}}. The construction of the current building started during the 12th century on the remains of an older sanctuary. The original structure, [[romanesque architecture|romanesque]], received gothic columns and vaults in the middle of the 12th century, giving birth to the Angevin [[gothic architecture|gothic]], a style that quickly spread in Western France and the Angevin possessions in [[Italy]]. Sculptures and architectural details were added to the fa\u00e7ade during the 16th century. The twin spires were built in 1518 and 1523. The neighbouring ''Palais du Tau'', the former episcopal palace, dates from the 12th century.\n\nThe skyline is also marked by the ''Tour Saint-Aubin''. Completed in 1170, it was the bell-tower of an abbey closed during the [[French Revolution]] and destroyed in 1810. Elaborately sculptured 11th and 12th century arcades also survive in the courtyard of the Prefecture.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://catholique-angers.cef.fr/site/im_user/118couverture_20041_petit.jpg |title=Eglise Saint Aubin |access-date=2 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050111095823/http://catholique-angers.cef.fr/site/im_user/118couverture_20041_petit.jpg |archive-date=11 January 2005 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}</ref> Another abbey, the ''Abbaye Toussaint'', founded during the 13th century, was also partially pulled down and only the church and parts of the cloister are still visible.

It displays Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities as well as Chinese and Japanese artifacts.\n\nLocated in the ''Abbaye Toussaint'', the ''Galerie David d'Angers'' gathers sculptures, reliefs, and medallions by [[David d'Angers]], a 19th-century sculptor born in the city. The gallery also owns the preparatory works for the [[Panth\u00e9on, Paris|Panth\u00e9on of Paris]] pediment.\n\nAngers also enjoys a ''Maison de l'Architecture'', which organizes various exhibitions and workshops, as well as several temporary exhibition galleries distributed in the city center.

The ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Quai'', inaugurated in 2007, has two auditoriums; one contains 980 seats and several balconies, and the other, more flexible, can welcome 400 seated or 960 standing spectators. The Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Quai are the venues of three institutions, ''[[Angers-Nantes Op\u00e9ra]]'', an opera company also based in [[Nantes]], the Contemporary Dance National Center (CNDC), inaugurated by [[Alwin Nikolais]] in 1978, and the ''Nouveau th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Angers'' (NTA).\n\nThe [[Orchestre National des Pays de la Loire]], shared with [[Nantes]], usually performs at the Congress Center, built in 1983, with a capacity of 1,240 seats. Other concert halls include the ''Chabada'', the ''Amphit\u00e9a'' and the former Ursuline chapel. Local theater companies perform at ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Chanzy'', ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Champ de Bataille'', ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Com\u00e9die'' or at the ''Centre Jean Vilar''. Each September, the city organizes a street performance festival, called the ''Accroche-C\u0153urs''.\n\nThe ''Chabada'', a popular concert hall, is the cradle of the Angevin contemporary scene and several groups and performers were discovered there, [[Les Thugs]], a [[punk rock|punk]] band formed in 1983, being the first ones. The local scene also includes the [[alternative rock]] group [[La Ruda]], the [[power pop]] band [[Pony Pony Run Run]], the [[world music]] band [[Lo'Jo]] and [[Titi Robin]], a performer influenced by [[Gypsy style|Gypsy]] and [[Arabic music]].\n\nThe Premiers Plans festival, dedicated to European first films and meant to help new directors meet their audience, is conducted every year and lasts one week. The films are screened in three small cinemas, while two big [[generalist channel|generalist multiplexes]] also exist in Angers.\n\n===Media===\nAngers had a local TV channel ''Angers 7'' which went bankrupt in 2010 and was replaced 3 years later by ''Angers T\u00e9l\u00e9''. The national French channel [[France 3]], however, still presents local news in its programs. Several national radio stations, such as [[Virgin Radio (France)|Virgin Radio]], [[NRJ Radio|NRJ]] and [[Ch\u00e9rie FM]] maintain local antennas in Angers. The city is also the home of two local stations, ''Radio Campus'' and ''Radio G!''. [[Ouest-France]] and [[Le Courrier de l'Ouest]] are the two local newspapers, the last one having its headquarters in Angers. The city and [[Communaut\u00e9 urbaine Angers Loire M\u00e9tropole|Angers Loire M\u00e9tropole]] also edit their news bulletins.\n\n==Sport==\n[[File:Tribune et supporters JB.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Bouin Stadium, Angers|Jean-Bouin Stadium]]]]\nAngers has many sport teams playing at top levels. [[Angers SCO]] is Angers's [[football team]]. The club was created in 1919 and returned to [[Ligue 1]] (French top league) in 2015 after 21 years. Les [[Ducs d'Angers]] is Angers's [[ice hockey]] team. The club plays in the [[Magnus League]] (first division). Anjou BC is Angers's [[Basketball|basketball team]], playing in second division. Vaillante Angers is Angers's table tennis team playing in top division Pro A since the 2000\u20132001 season. Angers also acts as home to the Angers Aviron Nautique, a [[rowing club]] which actively competes in regattas across France.\n\n[[Jean-Bouin Stadium, Angers|Jean-Bouin Stadium]] is the main sports venue which can hold 18,000 people. The city also has a variety of sports halls, tennis courts, swimming pools, shooting and archery stands, a velodrome, a rowing center, an ice rink and a fencing hall.

It is [[chef-lieu]] of the [[Maine-et-Loire]] [[departments of France|department]] and was the capital of the province of [[Anjou]] until the [[French Revolution]]. The inhabitants of both the city and the province are called ''Angevins''.

It was the cradle of the [[Plantagenet]] dynasty and became one of the intellectual centers of Europe during the reign of [[Ren\u00e9 of Anjou]]. Angers developed at the confluence of three rivers, the [[Mayenne (river)|Mayenne]], the [[Sarthe (river)|Sarthe]], and the [[Loir (river)|Loir]], all coming from the north and flowing south to the [[Loire (river)|Loire]]. Their confluence, just north of Angers, creates the [[Maine (river)|Maine]], a short but wide river that flows into the Loire several kilometres south. The Angers metropolitan area is a major economic centre in western France, particularly active in industry, horticulture, and tourism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mgm.fr/ARECLUS/page_auteurs/rozen_veuro.pdf|title=\u00c9tude comparative des villes europ\u00e9ennes}}</ref>\n\nAngers proper covers {{convert|42.70|sqkm|sp=us|sigfig=3}}<ref name=\"linternaute\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.linternaute.com/ville/ville/donnee/562/angers.shtml|title=City data on \"L'Internaute\"}}</ref> and has a population of 147,305 inhabitants, while around 394,700 live in its metropolitan area.

The old medieval center is still dominated by the massive [[ch\u00e2teau d'Angers|ch\u00e2teau]] of the [[Plantagen\u00eat]]s, home of the ''[[Apocalypse Tapestry]]'', the biggest medieval tapestry ensemble in the world.

This was the site of the ancient city and still houses the town's [[ch\u00e2teau d'Angers|castle]], [[Angers Cathedral|cathedral]], and medieval quarters.\n\nAt the north and south, where the river [[Maine (river)|Maine]] arrives in and leaves Angers, the landscape is formed by islands, ponds and floodplains which are a haven for birds and a typical flora of the [[Val de Loire]]. The [[\u00e9tang Saint-Nicolas]] and [[Lac de Maine]], both artificial, are among the biggest green areas of the city.\n\n===Metropolitan area===\nThe commune of Angers is bordered by ten other [[commune (France)|communes]] which form various suburbs. These are, clockwise, [[Avrill\u00e9, Maine-et-Loire|Avrill\u00e9]], [[Cantenay-\u00c9pinard]], [[\u00c9couflant]], [[Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy-d'Anjou]], [[Tr\u00e9laz\u00e9]], [[Les Ponts-de-C\u00e9]], [[Sainte-Gemmes-sur-Loire]], [[Bouchemaine]] and [[Beaucouz\u00e9]]. 22 other communes situated farther form with them the [[Communaut\u00e9 urbaine Angers Loire M\u00e9tropole]]. All these peripheral communes are situated within {{convert|17|km|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} from Angers proper. Together, they have around 272,400 inhabitants.\n\n===Climate===\nAngers has an [[oceanic climate]], with moderate rain year-round.

The walls were last reconstructed between 1230 and 1240, by order of [[Louis IX of France|King Louis IX]].<ref>''Historique du ch\u00e2teau d'Angers'', Inventaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du patrimoine culturel</ref> Today, portions of the wall are still visible in Rue Toussaint and on Boulevard Carnot, as are some towers, like the ''Tour Villebon'' and the ''Tour des Anglais''.\n\nBefore the first [[cadastre]] (1810), the city had not extended much beyond its medieval limits: on and around the castle promontory, with some dwellings on the other bank of the Maine in a neighbourhood called ''La Doutre''. That part of the city developed quickly during the industrial revolution and became a big river port. Industry was encouraged by firms like Bessonneau (textile factories) and [[Cointreau]] (distillery). After 1850, many suburbs appeared around the train stations and the slate quarries to the south in [[Tr\u00e9laz\u00e9]]. Despite the port in La Doutre, demographic growth and urban extension were more significant on the eastern bank of the Maine, where the former Juliomagus had been founded.\n\nThe medieval city center was redeveloped and expanded from 1791. The ''Place du Ralliement'', the main square, was then built in place of three churches destroyed during the [[French Revolution]] and, later, ring boulevards planted with trees replaced the city walls. The architectural style used is mainly [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|Haussmanian]], but there are also some [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]], [[Art Nouveau]] or [[Art Deco]] buildings.\n\nAfter 1945 and the [[Second World War]], several large [[council estate]]s made of tower blocks were built around the city center, the first of them being Belle-Beille in 1953. Industrial activity changed drastically: port activity declined while new factories, such as [[Technicolor SA]] in 1957, were built. During the 1970s, the collective approach to urban development gave way to more individual houses being built for the [[middle class]]. As the metropolitan area continued to grow, commuting became more common.  New shopping areas were constructed close to the villages which had been subsumed into the city. Because of the floodplains that surround the city north and south, Angers can only grow significantly on an east-west axis.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Tour des anglais, Angers (1).jpg|The ''Tour des Anglais'', a remaining part of the medieval city walls\nFile:Ardoise d' Angers.jpg|Traditional slated roof\nFile:Angers Oisellerie.jpg |Half-timbered houses in rue de l'Oisellerie\nFile:Vue sur la Doutre, Angers.jpg|View of La Doutre; the industrial port has become a marina\nFile:Angers - Tramway - Place du Ralliement.jpg|The Place du Ralliement\nFile:Nouvelles Galeries (Angers).jpg|A department store on a 19th-century street\nFile:Facade-hlmroseraieangers.jpg|A council estate in La Roseraie\n</gallery>\n\n===Green areas===\n[[File:douves jardins Angers.JPG|thumb|Gardens in the [[ch\u00e2teau d'Angers|castle]] moat.]]\nBeing both at the edge of the [[Val de Loire]] World Heritage site and on the largest river confluence in France,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.angers.fr/projets-et-politiques/rives-nouvelles/rives-nouvelles/index.html |title=Rives Nouvelles |work=www.angers.fr |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622235042/http://www.angers.fr/projets-et-politiques/rives-nouvelles/rives-nouvelles/index.html |archivedate=22 June 2012 }}</ref> Angers has a high natural potential, notably highlighted by the Saint-Aubin island, situated north of the center and covering a tenth of the city total surface. Protected, the island is formed of swamps and natural meadows.\n\nThe oldest green areas date back from the [[Renaissance]], when the moats of the castle were transformed into pleasure and kitchen gardens. Similar gardens were built by the aristocracy around their [[h\u00f4tel particulier|h\u00f4tels particuliers]] and medicinal gardens were planted in hospices cloisters. The Jardin des plantes, the first [[botanical garden]], dates back from the beginning of the 18th century. During the 19th century, others were built, for example the Faculty of Pharmacy garden and the Roseraie. The first recreational parks, for their part, were built during the [[Second French Empire]]. The [[\u00e9tang Saint-Nicolas]], made by a sluice on a small river, the Brionneau, was protected as early as 1936.\n\nThe Jardin du Mail (''Mall Garden''), an esplanade situated outside the ring boulevards, was built between 1820 and 1880 on the former Champs de Mars (Fields of Mars, a place where the garrisons used to train and parade). Another esplanade, the Mail [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], was built in 1999 together with a garden inside the new Saint-Serge business district. During the 1960s the old gravel pits around the Maine were filled with water to form the Lac de Maine, which now hosts a marina. In 2010, a large amusement park, [[Terra Botanica]], was inaugurated close to Saint-Aubin island.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Ile Saint-Aubin-2.jpg|The Saint-Aubin island protected area\nFile:Angers 2008 PD 01.JPG|Planted quays around the river Maine\nFile:Fontaine du Mail - Angers - 20080803.JPG|Jardin du Mail\nFile:Angers lac de maine.jpg|Sunset on the Lac de Maine\nFile:Terra Botanica Angers.JPG|[[Terra Botanica]]\n</gallery>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Angers}}\n\n===Prehistory and Antiquity===\n[[File:Brozen Sword.jpg|upright=0.5|thumb|A model of a sword from the [[Bronze Age]] discovered in the 2000s in the Maine riverbed]]\nThe first sign of human presence in Angers dates back to around 400,000&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qTfGDA70tGUC&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=angers+400+000+bc&source=bl&ots=zF-Y_GImhq&sig=ACfU3U3sAVQz6cod878KCuxZy_BDNaMq9A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjf9K7srbnnAhWCB80KHf0LBAoQ6AEwFHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=angers%20400%20000%20bc&f=false|title=From an Irish Market Town|last=Rogers|first=Joe|publisher=Publishamerica Inc|year=2011|isbn=978-1456043087|location=|pages=128}}</ref> Vestiges from the [[Neolithic]] are more abundant and include numerous polished stone axes.

In September 851, [[Charles the Bald]] and [[Erispoe]], a Breton chief, met in the town to sign the [[Battle of Jengland|Treaty of Angers]], which secured Breton independence and fixed the borders of [[Brittany]]. However, the situation remained dangerous for Angers, and Charles the Bald created in 853 a wide buffer zone around Brittany comprising parts of [[Anjou]], [[Touraine]], [[Maine (province)|Maine]] and [[S\u00e9es]], which was ruled by [[Robert the Strong]], a great-grandfather of [[Hugh Capet]].\n\nIn 870, the [[Viking]] chief [[Hastein]] seized Angers where he settled until a successful siege temporarily displaced him.

Around 929, he took the title of count (earl) of Angers and founded the first Anjou dynasty, the [[House of Ingelger]] (''French: Ingelgeriens''). Angers subsequently formed the capital of the [[French province|province]] of [[Anjou]].{{sfnp|EB|1878}}\n\nDuring the 12th century, after internal divisions in [[Brittany]], the county of Nantes was annexed by [[Anjou]].

The Empire disappeared in 1204\u20131205 when the King of France, [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], seized [[Normandy]] and [[Anjou]]. Henceforth there were no more counts of [[County of Anjou|Anjou]], as the French king had made Anjou a dukedom.\n\nNow a part of the [[Kingdom of France]], Angers became the \"Key to the Kingdom\" ({{lang|fr|Cl\u00e9 du Royaume}}) facing still independent [[Brittany]]. In 1228, during [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]]'s minority, [[Blanche of Castile]] decided to fortify the city and to rebuild the castle. Later, during the 1350s and 1360s, the schools of Law, Medicine and Theology, renowned in [[Europe]], were organized into a university. In 1373, [[Louis I, Duke of Anjou|Louis I of Naples and Anjou]] ordered the six tapestries illustrating the [[Apocalypse]] of St John known today as the ''[[Apocalypse Tapestry]]''.\n\n===Renaissance===\n[[File:King Rene and Jeanne de Lavalle.

A man of great culture and generosity, Ren\u00e9 transformed Angers into a cultural and political center and held court there. He transformed the castle moat into a [[menagerie]] and built several gardens. He also founded in Angers a new [[Ordre du Croissant]] which was supposed to compete with the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], created several years earlier.\n\nIn 1474, [[Louis XI of France]], in his attempt to conquer Anjou, came to Angers with his army, asking for the keys of the city.<ref>Histoire de Ren\u00e9 d'Anjou, Louis Fran\u00e7ois Villeneuve-Bargemont tome II (1446\u20131476) Editions J. J. Blaise, Paris : 1825</ref> Ren\u00e9, then 65 years old, did not want to lead a war against his nephew and surrendered his domains without a fight. Thus, Anjou ceased to be an [[appanage]] and fell into the Royal domain. After his death, Ren\u00e9 was buried in 1480 in [[Angers Cathedral|Saint-Maurice cathedral]].\n\n[[File:Angers - Logis Barrault (2).jpg|thumb|The ''Logis Barrault'', where the [[Edict of Nantes]] was prepared]]\nIn 1551, Angers became the seat of a [[bailiwick]] and the [[pr\u00e9sidial]] of a jurisdiction, a position the city kept until 1790. At the same time, with the growth of [[Protestantism]] in France, a Catholic was placed at the head of the city and its castle while the [[bourgeoisie]] formed a Catholic militia to protect Angers from the [[Huguenots]]. The bishop, [[Gabriel Bouvery]], organized on his side an \"Angevin League\".\n\nWhen the news of the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] reached Angers, another massacre took place in the city. The bodies of slain Protestants were thrown into the [[Mayenne (river)|Mayenne]]. It was the [[aldermen]] who stopped the slaughter.<ref>Pierre Miquel, ''Op. cit.'', p. 286</ref>\n\nIn 1598, the [[Edict of Nantes]] was prepared by [[Henri IV of France|Henri IV]] in Angers. From 6 March until 2 April, Angers was the ''de facto'' capital of France and the King tried all means to satisfy the Catholics of the city, for example by laying the cornerstone of the new Capucine convent.\n\n===Classical period===\nIn 1619, [[Louis XIII of France]] gave the governance of [[Anjou]] to his mother, [[Marie de' Medici]]. The Queen Mother settled in Angers, at the Logis Barrault, with her chaplain, [[Cardinal Richelieu]].\n\nAt the premature death of Louis XIII in 1643, his son [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] was only an infant. France was troubled at this time by several famines and epidemics, and by political instability. In 1649, the people of Angers revolted against rising taxes, the start of the [[Fronde]] in [[Anjou]]. The [[Fronde]] was a nationwide military conflict opposing some aristocrats wanting more autonomy and the Royal forces loyal to [[Anne of Austria]] as Queen Mother and Regent, and her prime minister, [[Cardinal Mazarin]]. Royalist repression in Angers was narrowly averted by Bishop [[Henri Arnauld]], who interceded with the Queen Mother. Arnauld, who would remain Bishop of Angers until 1692, was to leave a deep mark on the religious life of the city during the second half of the 17th century.\n\nIn 1652, [[Henri Chabot]], Duke of [[Duchy of Rohan|Rohan]] and governor of [[Anjou]], decided to back [[Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9|Louis of Cond\u00e9]], leader of the [[Fronde]]. Angers again became rebellious and [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] sent his army to seize it. The Duke of Rohan immediately surrendered and thus again prevented the sack of the city.\n\n===French Revolution===\n[[File:Cahier Angers.jpg|thumb|left|200px|One of the [[cahiers de dol\u00e9ances]] written in Angers in 1789]]\nThe first months of the [[French Revolution]] were relatively quiet in Angers. In 1789, the city lost its ancient administrative positions, replaced in 1790 by the [[department of France|department]] of ''Mayenne-et-Loire'', soon renamed \"[[Maine-et-Loire]]\". [[Anjou]], as a political entity, disappeared, although the new department included most of its territory.\n\nThe [[War in the Vend\u00e9e|War of Vend\u00e9e]], a Royalist rebellion and [[counterrevolution]] led in [[Vend\u00e9e]], a department located at the southwest of [[Maine-et-Loire]], reached the [[Loire (river)|Loire]] in March 1793. The Royalist army soon crossed the river and progressed as far as [[Granville, Manche|Granville]], in [[Normandy]], in November. Pushed back, the Vend\u00e9ens went back south and, to cross the Loire again, had to attack Angers.\n\nThe city was defended by 4,000 Republican soldiers, whereas the Royalists were at least 20,000, but weakened by successive fights and deceases. The [[Siege of Angers]] occurred on 3 and 4 December 1793. The Royalists' bad tactics, as well as the strength of Angers city wall and castle, caused their loss. They consequently went back north for a while, around [[Le Mans]], before crossing the [[Loire (river)|Loire]] at [[Ancenis]] on 16 December.\n\nIn 1794, fierce repression was conducted in the whole region against the Royalists. In Angers, 290 prisoners were shot and 1020 died of illness in jail.<ref>Jacques Hussenet (dir.), ''\u00ab D\u00e9truisez la Vend\u00e9e ! \u00bb'', p. 452\u2013453.</ref> The city also welcomed many refugees, mostly Republicans living in Royalist rural areas.

The city traditionally had a somewhat sombre appearance from the quantity of local [[slate]] used in construction but many quarters were gradually destroyed, redeveloped, or rebuilt on the Parisian model.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} The city wall, which formed a square around the old city core, was demolished around 1850 and replaced by wide boulevards. New districts of the city were also opened up on the opposite bank of the river.{{sfnp|EB|1878}}\n\nIn 1849, the Angers-[[Saumur]] railway was built; it was extended to [[Nantes]] two years later. When completed, the line connected [[Paris]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]].\n\nIn 1850, a [[catastrophic failure]] of the [[Angers Bridge|Basse-Cha\u00eene]] suspension bridge caused the deaths of over 200 soldiers. The disaster inhibited the construction of [[suspension bridge]]s in France for two decades. The accident was mainly caused by soldiers' lilting march which created [[resonance]] in the bridge structure.<ref>[http://www.art-et-histoire.com/index4o.php?segreap.php?Angers Base de connaissance Art et Histoire]</ref>\n\nIn 1875, a \"free faculty\" was created. It was soon assimilated to the medieval Angevin University ({{lang|la|Universitas Andegavensis}}), which had been dissolved during the [[French Revolution]]. The new faculty was canonically erected as the Catholic University of Angers ({{lang|fr|[[Catholic University of the West|Universit\u00e9 catholique d'Angers]]}}) by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1879. However, in 1890, a law prohibited private institutions of higher education from calling themselves \"universities\". The institution was then renamed the \"Free Faculty of Angers\" ({{lang|fr|Facult\u00e9 libre d'Angers}}), although it kept its original name on an informal basis. At the beginning of the 20th century, two higher education establishments, specializing in agriculture and commercial sciences, were opened.\n\n[[File:Fontaine du Mail zoomed - Angers - 20080803.JPG|thumb|left|The fountain in ''Jardin du Mail'', built for the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Exposition Universelle]] in [[Paris]]]]\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, several [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]] buildings were constructed, such as the ''Nouvelles Galeries'', the ''Hotel des Postes'', ''Hotel Continental'', the ''Alcazar'' and the ''Maison bleue''.\n\nIn September 1939, when [[Poland]] was invaded by Germany, the [[Polish government-in-exile]] settled in Angers. It left the city on 12 June 1940, after the invasion of France by the [[Wehrmacht]]. Angers fell to the [[Nazi]]s during the same month. The Germans made it the seat of a regional Kommandantur. In 1941, a first [[Resistance during World War II|Resistance]] movement, called ''Honneur et Patrie'', was created in Angers. 60 Resistants were shot at the Belle-Beille range in 1942 and a German bunker factory employed 6000 people in 1943.<ref>[http://lesplantagenets.fr/index.php Lesplantagenets.fr]</ref> In July 1942, 853 Jews were arrested and sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]].<ref name=\"culture.cg49.fr\">{{cite web|url=http://culture.cg49.fr/le-patrimoine/histoire/dhier-a-aujourdhui/|title=L'Anjou dans la seconde guerre mondiale|editor=Conseil general de Maine-et-Loire}}</ref>\n\nOn the night of 28 May 1944, the first Allied bombing occurred over the Saint-Laud quarter. 243 people died and many others were wounded. Successive attacks on 29 and 30 May destroyed the train station and its surroundings<ref name=\"culture.cg49.fr\"/> which were reconstructed in the 1950s.\n\nAfter liberating [[Avranches]] and [[Rennes]], [[General Patton]] and his 5th infantry division arrived in [[Anjou]] on 5 August. To seize Angers, they decided to enter the city by its eastern side to surprise the Nazis. On 9 August, they crossed the Maine and started the fight. Helped by the local [[French Forces of the Interior]], they progressively moved forward to the city center. The fight was nevertheless difficult and Angers was liberated the day after, at around 5 p.m.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.angers.fr/decouvrir-angers/histoire-d-angers/chroniques-historiques/pour-s-informer/aout-1944-angers-est-liberee/index.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130213142103/http://www.angers.fr/decouvrir-angers/histoire-d-angers/chroniques-historiques/pour-s-informer/aout-1944-angers-est-liberee/index.html |url-status = dead|archive-date=2013-02-13 |title=Ao\u00fbt 1944.

In 1971, a decision was made to reestablish a public university, and the Universit\u00e9 catholique d'Angers was split between the [[Catholic University of the West|Universit\u00e9 catholique de l'Ouest]] (private) and the [[University of Angers|Universit\u00e9 d'Angers]] (public). Angers continues to have two different universities.\n\nUntil the 1980s, Angers experienced several massive urban development plans, such as the construction of the Lac de Maine, and several vast council estates and shopping malls, as well as the construction of a highway which crossed the city through its center, a project that forced the destruction of many old buildings and destroyed the original quays on the Maine. Later, other urban plans were drawn up, with a new emphasis on nature and heritage protection, as well as on social mixing. During the 1990s, the redevelopment of the Saint-Serge quarter, located just north of the historical center, produced a new business center, gardens and university buildings.\n[[File:View of Angers on the Maine river from the castle.jpg|thumb|center|550px|View of Angers and the Maine river]]\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:Angers - Palais de justice (1).jpg|thumb|The court of appeal in the ''Jardin du Mail'']]\nAngers received its communal charter from [[Louis XI of France]] in February 1475, but free elections for the [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] and [[aldermen]] were not guaranteed before 1484, following a decision by [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]]. Since then, 75 successive mayors have governed Angers.\n\nAngers was until the [[Second World War]] mainly governed by [[centrism|centrist]] and republican mayors. From 1977 until 2014, all the successive mayors were been members of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], whereas the [[Maine-et-Loire]] department has always been governed by moderate [[right-wing]] parties. The current mayor is [[Christophe B\u00e9chu]].\n\nAngers is divided into eight [[canton (France)|cantons]]; most of them include parts of Angers plus some surrounding communes. These cantons are not administrative entities and only serve to elect the members of the department council. The [[INSEE]], the French institute for statistics, divides the commune of Angers into twelve sectors. Depending on their social and economic issues, some of them can have priority for financial assistance and urban regeneration. In Angers, five are considered as priority sectors, three as sensitive urban areas, and one as an urban free zone.\n\nBeing the [[chef-lieu]] of [[Maine-et-Loire]], Angers is the seat of a [[pr\u00e9fectures in France|prefecture]]. It is also the seat of a  [[Court of Appeal (France)|Court of Appeal]] and of several regional or local institutes, concerning for example, customs, education or science. Angers also has several other courts of justice as well as a [[prison]].\n\n==Demographics==\nIn 2009, Angers had 147,305 inhabitants, 0.3% less than ten years before.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/bases-de-donnees/esl/comparateur.asp?codgeo=COM-49007|title=Commune d'Angers (49007)|editor=INSEE}}</ref> It is the 18th most populated [[commune (France)|commune]] in France, having reached its maximum population in 2006, with 152,337 inhabitants.

The work for sailing ships was still carried on but [[steamship]]s had greatly reduced demand. Instead, local companies produced [[Electrical cable|cable]]s, [[wire]]s, and [[thread (yarn)|thread]] and increased production of [[footwear]], [[umbrella]]s, and [[parasol]]s. The area's vineyards focused on [[sparkling wine]] and fruit was increasingly [[preserved fruit|preserved]] for sale elsewhere.

During the 15th century, a chapel and the Ch\u00e2telet were added in the courtyard.\n\nThe ''{{Interlanguage link|Maison d'Adam|fr}}'' (\"Adam's House\"), located behind the cathedral, is an excellent example of the half-timbered houses which were built during the [[Middle Ages]]. Many similar houses, although smaller, are also visible along the streets around the castle. The city also displays several [[Renaissance]] and [[classical architecture|classical]] [[h\u00f4tel particulier|h\u00f4tels particuliers]], the most renowned being the ''Logis Pinc\u00e9'' from the 16th century. The ''Maison bleue'' (\"Blue House\"), built in 1927, is an [[Art Deco]] masterpiece. The former seat of the French Aviation Company ({{lang|fr|Compagnie fran\u00e7aise d'Aviation}}) was built in 1938 and abandoned during the [[Second World War]]. Totally refurbished in 2004, it is now a testimony to 1930s architecture.\n\nThe [[Angers Cathedral|Saint-Maurice cathedral]] is a major landmark in the cityscape, with its two spires culminating at {{convert|75|m|sp=us}}. The construction of the current building started during the 12th century on the remains of an older sanctuary. The original structure, [[romanesque architecture|romanesque]], received gothic columns and vaults in the middle of the 12th century, giving birth to the Angevin [[gothic architecture|gothic]], a style that quickly spread in Western France and the Angevin possessions in [[Italy]]. Sculptures and architectural details were added to the fa\u00e7ade during the 16th century. The twin spires were built in 1518 and 1523. The neighbouring ''Palais du Tau'', the former episcopal palace, dates from the 12th century.\n\nThe skyline is also marked by the ''Tour Saint-Aubin''. Completed in 1170, it was the bell-tower of an abbey closed during the [[French Revolution]] and destroyed in 1810. Elaborately sculptured 11th and 12th century arcades also survive in the courtyard of the Prefecture.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://catholique-angers.cef.fr/site/im_user/118couverture_20041_petit.jpg |title=Eglise Saint Aubin |access-date=2 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050111095823/http://catholique-angers.cef.fr/site/im_user/118couverture_20041_petit.jpg |archive-date=11 January 2005 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}</ref> Another abbey, the ''Abbaye Toussaint'', founded during the 13th century, was also partially pulled down and only the church and parts of the cloister are still visible. On the southern limits of the commune, close to the Maine, stands the ''Couvent de la Baumette'', founded during the 15th century by [[Ren\u00e9 of Anjou]].\n\nLa Doutre, an old quarter located on the western bank of the Maine and facing the castle, contains two major medieval sites, the former ''Abbaye du Ronceray'', built during the 11th and 12th century, and the ''H\u00f4pital Saint-Jean'', founded by [[Henry II of England]] and used as the city hospital until 1870.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Chateau angers porte interieur gauche.jpg|The distinctive striped towers of the castle\nFile:Chateau angers tour double.jpg|The castle\nFile:Ch\u00e2teau angers jardin ch\u00e2telet.jpg|The Ch\u00e2telet in the castle\nFile:Maison de Simon Poisson - Angers - 20100801.jpg|House Poisson\nFile:Maison du Croissant, facade - Angers - 20110119.jpg|Fa\u00e7ade of House of Croissant\nFile:P1020272 Angers Logis Pinc\u00e9 reductwk.JPG|Logis Pinc\u00e9\nFile:La Maison Bleue - Angers - 20110119.jpg|The \"Blue House\"\nFile:Angers 2008 PD 04.JPG|The cathedral\nFile:Angers - Nef cath\u00e9drale Saint-Maurice.jpg|Inside the cathedral\nFile:Palais \u00e9piscopal du Tau - Angers - 20101126.jpg|Palace of Tau\nFile:P1020199 Angers Tour Saint-Aubin reductwk.JPG|Tower of Saint-Aubin\nFile:\u00c9glise abbatiale de l'abbaye du Ronceray.jpg|Abbey of Ronceray\nFile:Abbaye st Nicolas d'Angers.jpg|Abbey of Saint Nicholas (Mother-House of [[Good Shepherd Sisters]])\nFile:The bridges over Maine (view from the Angers Castle).JPG|The bridges over Maine (view from the Angers Castle)\n</gallery>\n\n===Museums===\n[[File:Tapisserie de l'apocalypse.jpg|thumb|The [[Apocalypse Tapestry]]]]\nThe [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts d'Angers]], located in the [[Renaissance]] ''Logis Barrault'', displays a collection of paintings and sculptures dating from the 14th century to today. It is particularly renowned for its 18th-century paintings, including works by [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]], [[Van Loo]], [[Antoine Watteau]], [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]], and [[Jean Sim\u00e9on Chardin]]. The museum also contains a graphic design studio, a gallery devoted to the history of Angers and a temporary exhibition gallery. The institution has an annexe at the ch\u00e2teau in [[Villev\u00eaque]], a village located several kilometers north of the city.\n\nInside the [[ch\u00e2teau d'Angers|castle]], a special gallery displays the [[Apocalypse Tapestry]], ordered by [[Louis I of Naples]] at the end of the 14th century. It is more than {{convert|140|m|sp=us}} long, the largest medieval tapestry in the world. Inspired by [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|manuscript miniatures]], the successive scenes, designed by [[Jean Bondol]], illustrate the [[Book of Revelation|Apocalypse of St John]].\n\nLocated inside the old ''H\u00f4pital Saint-Jean'', the ''Mus\u00e9e Jean-Lur\u00e7at et de la tapisserie contemporaine'' displays tapestries dating from the 19th and 20th centuries. The museum is dedicated to [[Jean Lur\u00e7at]], an artist noted for his role in the revival of contemporary tapestry, and notably exhibits his \"''Chant du Monde''\", a modern echo to the ''[[Apocalypse Tapestry]]'' made after the bombing of [[Hiroshima]].\n\nThe [[Mus\u00e9um d'histoire naturelle d'Angers]] has been located in the 1521 H\u00f4tel Demarie-Valentin since 1885. It exhibits a large collection of mounted animals and fossils, divided in three departments, one for [[zoology]], one for [[botany]] and the last one for [[paleontology]] and [[geology]].\n\nThe ''Logis Pinc\u00e9'', constructed during the [[Renaissance]], is the home of the museum of the same name. It displays Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities as well as Chinese and Japanese artifacts.\n\nLocated in the ''Abbaye Toussaint'', the ''Galerie David d'Angers'' gathers sculptures, reliefs, and medallions by [[David d'Angers]], a 19th-century sculptor born in the city. The gallery also owns the preparatory works for the [[Panth\u00e9on, Paris|Panth\u00e9on of Paris]] pediment.\n\nAngers also enjoys a ''Maison de l'Architecture'', which organizes various exhibitions and workshops, as well as several temporary exhibition galleries distributed in the city center. Outside the commune limits are also an aviation museum and a museum of communications.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:P1020234 Angers Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts rwk.JPG|The Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts\nFile:Genies.jpg|''Les G\u00e9nies des Arts'' by [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]], at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts\nFile:Hanno.mahout clean.jpg|Italian drawing, 17th century, at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts\nFile:Hopital-St-Jean-Angers (3).JPG|Mus\u00e9e Jean-Lur\u00e7at\nFile:Galerie David d'Angers (1).jpg|Galerie David d'Angers\nFile:David d'Angers - Profil de Charles-Artus de Bonchamps.jpg|Galerie David d'Angers\n</gallery>\n\n===Entertainment and performing arts===\n[[File:Angers grand theatre.jpg|thumb|The ''Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre'']]\nThe ''Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre'', dominating the Place du Ralliement, was first built in 1791, but destroyed by a fire in 1853. The existing building was completed in 1871 and its auditorium contains six stalls and four balconies, totaling 730 seats. The ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Quai'', inaugurated in 2007, has two auditoriums; one contains 980 seats and several balconies, and the other, more flexible, can welcome 400 seated or 960 standing spectators. The Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Quai are the venues of three institutions, ''[[Angers-Nantes Op\u00e9ra]]'', an opera company also based in [[Nantes]], the Contemporary Dance National Center (CNDC), inaugurated by [[Alwin Nikolais]] in 1978, and the ''Nouveau th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Angers'' (NTA).\n\nThe [[Orchestre National des Pays de la Loire]], shared with [[Nantes]], usually performs at the Congress Center, built in 1983, with a capacity of 1,240 seats. Other concert halls include the ''Chabada'', the ''Amphit\u00e9a'' and the former Ursuline chapel. Local theater companies perform at ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Chanzy'', ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Champ de Bataille'', ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Com\u00e9die'' or at the ''Centre Jean Vilar''. Each September, the city organizes a street performance festival, called the ''Accroche-C\u0153urs''.\n\nThe ''Chabada'', a popular concert hall, is the cradle of the Angevin contemporary scene and several groups and performers were discovered there, [[Les Thugs]], a [[punk rock|punk]] band formed in 1983, being the first ones. The local scene also includes the [[alternative rock]] group [[La Ruda]], the [[power pop]] band [[Pony Pony Run Run]], the [[world music]] band [[Lo'Jo]] and [[Titi Robin]], a performer influenced by [[Gypsy style|Gypsy]] and [[Arabic music]].\n\nThe Premiers Plans festival, dedicated to European first films and meant to help new directors meet their audience, is conducted every year and lasts one week. The films are screened in three small cinemas, while two big [[generalist channel|generalist multiplexes]] also exist in Angers.\n\n===Media===\nAngers had a local TV channel ''Angers 7'' which went bankrupt in 2010 and was replaced 3 years later by ''Angers T\u00e9l\u00e9''. The national French channel [[France 3]], however, still presents local news in its programs. Several national radio stations, such as [[Virgin Radio (France)|Virgin Radio]], [[NRJ Radio|NRJ]] and [[Ch\u00e9rie FM]] maintain local antennas in Angers. The city is also the home of two local stations, ''Radio Campus'' and ''Radio G!''. [[Ouest-France]] and [[Le Courrier de l'Ouest]] are the two local newspapers, the last one having its headquarters in Angers. The city and [[Communaut\u00e9 urbaine Angers Loire M\u00e9tropole|Angers Loire M\u00e9tropole]] also edit their news bulletins.\n\n==Sport==\n[[File:Tribune et supporters JB.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Bouin Stadium, Angers|Jean-Bouin Stadium]]]]\nAngers has many sport teams playing at top levels. [[Angers SCO]] is Angers's [[football team]]. The club was created in 1919 and returned to [[Ligue 1]] (French top league) in 2015 after 21 years. Les [[Ducs d'Angers]] is Angers's [[ice hockey]] team. The club plays in the [[Magnus League]] (first division). Anjou BC is Angers's [[Basketball|basketball team]], playing in second division. Vaillante Angers is Angers's table tennis team playing in top division Pro A since the 2000-2001 season. Angers also acts as home to the Angers Aviron Nautique, a [[rowing club]] which actively competes in regattas across France.\n\n[[Jean-Bouin Stadium, Angers|Jean-Bouin Stadium]] is the main sports venue which can hold 18,000 people. The city also has a variety of sports halls, tennis courts, swimming pools, shooting and archery stands, a velodrome, a rowing center, an ice rink and a fencing hall. The [[Lac de Maine Stadium]] hosted the athletics championships in France in July 2009.\n\n==People from Angers==\n{{Hidden\n|header=List of people born in Angers\n|style=\"clear:both; margin-bottom; width:99%; border-style:solid; border-color:#AAAAAA; background-color:#FFFFFF;\n|content=\n\n* [[Zacharie Astruc]] (1835\u20131907), artist\n* [[Jean Bodin]] (1529\u20131596), philosopher and jurist, author of ''[[Six Livres de la R\u00e9publique]]''\n* Francis Le Jau (1665\u20131717), [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[missionary]] to [[Caribbean|West Indies]] and [[South Carolina]], worked for the humane treatment of slaves.<ref name=\"Marquis 1607-1896\">{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607\u20131896 | publisher=Marquis Who's Who | location=Chicago | year = 1963}}</ref>\n* [[Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul]] (1786\u20131889), chemist\n* [[Yves de la Casini\u00e8re]] (1897\u20131971), composer\n* [[Joseph Proust|Joseph Louis Proust]] (1754\u20131826), chemist responsible for \"[[Law of definite proportions|Proust's law]]\"\n* [[Pierre Jean David|Pierre-Jean David d'Angers]] (1788\u20131856), sculptor\n* [[Germanicus Mirault]] (1796\u20131879), surgeon\n* [[Prosper M\u00e9ni\u00e8re]] (1799\u20131862), physician\n* Adolphe and \u00c9douard-Jean Cointreau, creators of the \"[[Cointreau]]\" orange-flavoured liquor\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Grille]] (1792\u20131853), librarian\n* [[Fernande Grudet]] (1923\u20132015), brothel-keeper\n* [[Ren\u00e9 Bazin]] (1853\u20131932), writer and educator\n* [[Fernand Charron]] (1866\u20131921), one of the first cars constructors ([[Octave Mirbeau]] dedicated to Charron ''La 628-E8'', 1907)\n* [[Jean Durtal]] (1905\u20131999), female poet and novelist\n* [[Herv\u00e9 Bazin]] (1911\u20131996), writer\n* [[Henri Dutilleux]] (1916\u20132013), composer\n* [[Joseph Wresinski]] (born 1917), humanitarian activist\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Bazin]] (1918\u20131958), critic of the [[French New Wave]]\n* [[Jacques Bompaire]] (1924\u20132009), Hellenist\n* [[Jacques Loussier]] (born 1934), composer and [[Jazz piano|jazz pianist]]\n* [[Valerie Trierweiler]] (born 1965), political journalist and domestic partner of [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]], the 24th President of the French Republic.\n* [[Eriq Ebouaney]] (born 1967), actor\n* [[Vincent Boussard]] (born 1969), opera and theatre director\n* [[Caroline Giron-Panel]] (born 1979), historian and musicologist\n* [[Nicolas Mahut]] (born 1982), tennis player\n* [[Juliana Mialoundama]] (born 1993), basketball player\n}}\n\n==Twin towns - sister cities==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in France}}\n\nAngers is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Les villes jumelles|url=http://www.angers.fr/l-action-municipale/relations-internationales/les-villes-jumelles/index.html|website=angers.fr|publisher=Angers|language=fr|accessdate=2019-11-12}}</ref>\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*{{flagicon|NED}} [[Haarlem]], [[North Holland]], Netherlands (1964)\n*{{flagicon|MLI}} [[Bamako]], Mali (1974)\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Pisa]], [[Province of Pisa|Pisa]], [[Tuscany]], Italy (1982)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} [[Metropolitan Borough of Wigan|Wigan]], [[Greater Manchester]], England, [[United Kingdom]] (1988)\n*{{flagicon|SWE}} [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje]], Sweden (1998)\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Osnabr\u00fcck]], Germany\n*{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Yantai]], China (2006)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]], US (2011)\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[Toru\u0144]], Poland\n}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|France}}\n* [[Maine-et-Loire]]\n* [[Anjou]]\n* [[Pays de la Loire]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.insee.fr/fr/bases-de-donnees/esl/comparateur.asp?codgeo=COM-49007 INSEE statistics].\n* {{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Angers |volume=2  |ref={{harvid|EB|1878}} |page=29 }}\n* {{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Angers |volume=2 |ref={{harvid|EB|1911}} |pages=8\u20139}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{See also|Timeline of Angers#Bibliography|l1=Bibliography of the history of Angers}}\n*{{cite book|author=C\u00e9lestin Port|authorlink=C\u00e9lestin Port|title=Dictionnaire historique, g\u00e9ographique et biographique de Maine-et-Loire et de l'ancienne province d'Anjou|publisher=H.

He is happily married to his wife, Lucille, but nonetheless has a mistress on the side who doesn't know he is married. During an argument, Lucille collapses and he rushes her to the hospital, where she is diagnosed with [[cancer]]. As his wife is tended to, Negan tells his mistress the truth, and she immediately leaves him. When the [[zombie apocalypse]] starts, the hospital workers tell Negan they are being forced to abandon the hospital and he should leave with them, but he refuses to leave Lucille's side. Lucille dies when the power goes out, short-circuiting her life-support machine; moments later, she reanimates as a [[zombie]]. He flees the hospital and finds a boy being trapped by zombies, and helps to dispatch them with a fire extinguisher. In return, Negan asks the boy to kill Lucille for him.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/walking-dead-will-negans-backstory-be-explored-941857 |title='Walking Dead': Will Negan's Backstory Be Explored? |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=October 29, 2016 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=October 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==== A Larger World ====\nAt some point after the outbreak, Negan is found by a group led by a man named [[Dwight (The Walking Dead)|Dwight]]. He slowly takes control over this group from Dwight, renaming them the Saviors and ruling them with an iron fist. Negan, along with his team (which includes at least 50 or more other men), makes a deal with the Hilltop Colony: the Saviors would use the weaponry the other group was lacking to cull all zombies wandering near the Hilltop's premises; in return, the Saviors would obtain half of Hilltop's supplies, such as livestock and crops. Negan punishes even the smallest infraction (real or perceived) with brutal violence; for example, he orders the (attempted) death of the Hilltop's leader, [[Gregory (The Walking Dead)|Gregory]], because he feels Gregory is not sufficiently loyal.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #95</ref>\n\n==== Something To Fear ====\nLater, Negan, along with 50 other Saviors, snuck up on [[Rick Grimes|Rick]]'s group and subdued Rick by surprise. They lined up all of the survivors from the van (Rick, [[Carl Grimes|Carl]], [[Glenn Rhee|Glenn]], [[Maggie Greene|Maggie ]], [[Michonne]], and Heath), telling them that Negan wanted revenge for the Saviors who were killed. Without Rick's consent, Negan imposed a binding deal: everything that belonged to the Alexandria Safe-Zone now belonged to the Saviors. Negan also introduced his weapon of choice; Lucille, a baseball bat covered in barbed wire. After a long talk about the new world order and whom he should beat to death using Lucille, he finally chose his victim at random: Glenn.  Negan told the mourning and crying group that the Saviors would be back in one week to collect half of everything that Alexandria Safe-Zone owned, or there would be more killings. Rick vowed to avenge Glenn's murder and kill Negan. Negan laughed at this, beat Rick with his bare hands, and then turned around, leaving the survivors with Glenn's mangled corpse.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #100</ref>\n\n==== What Comes After ====\nNegan and the Saviors later arrived at the Alexandria Safe-Zone for their first offering. Negan and the Saviors begin killing the roamers in the surrounding area and scavenge each of the houses for supplies. Negan and his men depart from the Safe-Zone with supplies, but, unbeknownst to them, Carl is hiding in the truck with an assault rifle. Once the Saviors get back to their base, Negan is amazed to see that Dwight is still alive. A Savior finds Carl, and Carl uses the rifle to kill six Saviors. They surround Carl, and he demands to speak with Negan. When Negan arrives, Carl fires at them until he loses control of his gun. Dwight is about to kill Carl when Negan stops Dwight and says, \"Is that any way to treat our new guest?\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #104</ref>\n\nInstead of taking immediate action against young Carl, Negan shows interest in getting to know the poor child. He goes as far as to lead him through the Saviors' facilities, revealing that he is the leader of a cult-like domain of selfless followers who bow to his every word and command. Many followers in his ranks are living on a point system in order to sustain their lives, though many give in to his graces in exchange for a better lifestyle, most notably the women in his \"[[harem]]\" whom he considers his \"wives\".\n\nNegan reveals that he'd like to get to know Carl a little better, but he gets distracted by Carl's bandaged face. He orders Carl to remove the bandages. Carl allows him to see it only after being threatened; he removes the bandages to reveal the disturbing results of having been shot. Negan, in a state of disbelief and awe, jokingly mocks the deformity and goes as far as to ask Carl if he can touch the part of his skull showing through Carl's exposed eye-socket, which causes Carl to break finally and cry. This appears to have an odd effect on Negan, who takes back the gesture and apologizes, seeing that he has finally found a weakness in the child he finds so dangerous.\n\nIn a ritualistic fashion, complete with call-and-response chanting, with the followers answering to Negan's words, Negan demonstrates that whoever falls onto his bad graces is dealt with by having their face seared by a hot iron. Tied to the end of a pole, the tool is held over a fire before being handed to Negan, who presses it against the victim's face as punishment for their betrayal. In this case, it is the face of Amber's former lover Mark, who is left deformed in the same manner as Dwight, with a portion of his face permanently scarred and an eyeball exposed. After the ritual, Negan dismisses his congregation before turning to Carl, who hands back \"Lucille\", and Negan leads him away, contemplating what to do with him.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #105</ref>\n\nNegan runs into Rick while the latter was on his way to find Carl. Negan tells Rick how eager he is to show him \"what he has done to his son\".<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #106</ref> Rick, in a fit of rage, then attacks Negan before Negan reveals that Carl is fine, and Negan clarifies that he is eager to show Rick \"that he has done nothing to his son.\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #107</ref>\n\n==== March to War ====\nSeveral days later, Negan arrives at the Alexandria Safe-Zone a few days ahead of schedule; he's informed that the community is \"practically\" out of supplies, and Rick went out looking for more. Negan decides that he will stay in Alexandria until Rick returns from the supply run. Negan is later approached by Spencer Monroe who tells Negan that Rick is not a suitable leader for the community and asks that once Negan assassinates Rick, he be given control over the Safe-Zone. He responds by telling Spencer that Rick may hate him, but, he has guts, unlike Spencer, who acted like a coward. Negan then slashes Spencer's stomach, killing him almost instantly.\n\nRick later returns with supplies. Negan initially demands all of it but then decides to take nothing, as repayment for having killed Spencer. Rick insists that they take their share, and Negan has no objections. As the Saviors are driving back to the foundry, Negan notices Rick and a few others are following them. An instant later, the driver is shot and killed. Confused and angry, Negan takes Lucille and sees Rick pointing a gun at his head. Suddenly, a gunshot is heard, and Rick's gun is destroyed as well as those of the others who came out with him. Negan remarks on how stupid Rick and the others are to use bullets on the roamers instead of saving them for \"the much more dangerous thinkers\" (i.e., the living). Negan reveals that before every pickup, he has a back-up team armed with guns surround the Safe-Zone and guard the area while he and the other Saviors go in and salvage for supplies. With a crazed smile on his face, Negan leans into Rick and says that he and the Safe-Zone residents are \"fucking fucked.\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #112</ref>\n\nNegan smiles and says that in a stand-off situation, snipers tend to give away their position after several shots. He clarifies that Rick's \"[[Andrea (The Walking Dead)|sniper bitch]] is as good as dead,\" causing Rick to try and strike him. As Negan holds him off, Carl shoots off a portion of Lucille, causing the Saviors to open fire at the Safe-Zone walls. Negan orders them to stop, and is shocked and angry about the damage to Lucille. Negan issues an ultimatum: \"Give me the boy, or I'll bash in all four skulls of the people out here!\" Negan admits that he liked Carl at first and that he never had a kid of his own; if he did, he wanted him to be like Carl. Rick says that if Carl dies, their agreement is over, but, Negan states that it already ''is'' over. He orders his men to line up Rick, Heath, Nicholas, and Holly, then begins to decide which one to kill first. He notices a figure falling from the bell tower and smugly repeats that he knew Rick's sniper was good as dead, not realizing that it's not Andrea, but Connor.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #113</ref>\n\nNegan taunts Rick about Andrea's supposed demise, and Nicholas interrupts him, pleading for his life. Negan berates Nicholas for doing this and accuses him of being a coward. He asks Rick, Heath, or Holly to ask him to kill Nicholas and says if they do so, he will spare them. However, Heath tells him, no, and so Negan begins to pick which one of them he will kill.\n\nNegan is interrupted when [[Paul \"Jesus\" Monroe|Paul Monroe]] grabs a Savior by the foot and uses him as a shield from the Saviors' bullets. Negan tells his men to stand down, and when he does this, Paul leaps out of a trench and kicks the nearest Savior in the face. Paul orders Rick and the others into a trench and proceeds to fight his way towards Negan. When Paul reaches Negan, he manages to disarm him and hold him hostage. Paul stalls the Saviors until [[King Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] and his men arrive. Negan breaks free from Paul and runs to a truck, where he retreats back to the Sanctuary with his men. Negan is later seen back at the Sanctuary, where he gives the Saviors a speech about their being the dominant force in the world, and they need to remind people of that. Negan then states they are going to war.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #114</ref>\n\n==== All Out War ====\nSeveral days later, Rick's army arrives at the Saviors' base and demands that Negan come out. Rick offers him a chance to surrender and spare the women and children in his community. \" Negan refuses Rick's offer, and reveals that Gregory has defected to the Saviors, meaning that Hilltop is now under Negan\u2019s control.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #115</ref> He calls Dwight, ordering him to bring the men from the outposts back to help drive off Rick's army. Dwight agrees but due to the commotion, Negan doesn't notice the former's hesitation to act immediately. As more men rush outside, Negan orders them to start shooting the army before all their snipers are killed. He suddenly notices that all their snipers are taking cover and is initially confused as to why Rick's militia are shooting not the snipers, but the windows. He then notices the large herd of zombies that are rapidly approaching the Sanctuary walls. Suddenly, Holly drives through the fence, destroying a portion of it and letting the herd inside. Negan frantically orders his men back inside the foundry but notices that Holly is still alive. He sees a zombie about to kill her and dispatches it. As she looks up, Negan smiles and says that she wasn't \"going to get off THAT fucking easy.\" As the zombies converge on the courtyard area, the Saviors retreat inside the foundry to develop a new strategy.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #116</ref>\n\nNegan delivers an analogy to a group of Saviors about how you can destroy a man \"by fucking his vagina\", meaning that the best way to destroy a man's heart is by destroying the woman he loves; Negan clearly believes this to be Holly. She corrects him by saying he's got the wrong woman; Rick loves Andrea, and she was in love with Abraham, the man Dwight killed. Negan refuses to listen, insisting that she is the one who killed Connor \"and a terrible liar.\" He then orders her taken away and goes off to clear his head. Later, Negan is seen outside with more Saviors trying to clear the courtyard of all the zombies, swearing that if any of them die he will \"fuck them up.\" Eventually, too many roamers pour in the fence and Negan's group retreat inside once more. Negan realizes that if the herd keeps them stuck inside for more than one day, they will all be dead, and he orders squads outside every two hours to clean up the infestation by any means necessary. He goes to interrogate Holly, but catches David in the middle of trying to [[rape]] her. Negan demands that he get away from her and grabs him by the collar. He angrily reminds David one of the Savior's main rules: \"We don't rape\". As punishment for breaking this rule, Negan proceeds to stab David in the neck and apologizes to Holly, telling her that \"they [The Saviors] aren't monsters.\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #117</ref>\n\nNegan gets word of one of his outposts being overrun by Rick's army and sends more men to fortify the remaining ones. This, in turn, leads to Ezekiel's army being eradicated in a failed attack.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #118</ref> Negan also finds a way to eliminate all of the zombies that had flooded into the Sanctuary's courtyard, for he is later seen heading towards Alexandria. When he arrives at the Safe-Zone, he throws a grenade over the wall, demolishing one of the houses and getting Rick's attention. He threatens that 'there's more where that came from' and insists that he's here to parlay. To support his claim, he has a blindfolded Holly brought out of his truck and offers to release her back to Rick. Rick agrees to talk only when Holly is safely back inside, and Negan agrees. This is later shown to be a ploy: it is revealed that Negan had Holly killed and she later reanimated.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #119</ref> As the Alexandrians are distracted by this revelation, Negan orders his men to surround Alexandria and throws another grenade over the wall. Suddenly, gunfire erupts from behind several buildings. Surprised by this, Negan orders his men behind one of the trucks. He asks for one more grenade to use as cover and tells his men \"the last boat is leaving... you'd better fucking be on it.\" He manages to escape, and they can make a fast exit. When a Savior makes an offhand comment about retreating, Negan retorts that this wasn't a retreat. Pointing towards the smoke coming from Alexandria, he comments that this means they've \"just fucking won.\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #120</ref>\n\nAfter successfully bombarding Alexandria, Negan leads his men back to Sanctuary. He sees a herd of roamers attacking several people from Alexandria. He orders his men to kill the roamers and wonders aloud why they are out here beyond the wall. Nevertheless, he orders [[Eugene Porter]] and the others to be taken back with them. Later, Negan finds out that Eugene was making ammunition for Rick's army and goes to see him. Flanked by Dwight and Carson, Negan orders Eugene to begin producing ammo for the Saviors. When the latter refuses, Negan hands Carson Lucille, and tells Eugene what will happen if he refuses to cooperate; smiling, he says that he could disfigure Eugene's face or castrate him. Eugene still refuses to betray Rick, and Negan leaves Eugene \"with his thoughts and his dick... while he still has it.\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #121</ref> Early the following day, Negan reveals to the Saviors that he has come up with a  plan that will help them win the war. He has assembled a group of roamers inside the courtyard to demonstrate his idea, exclaiming \"they are the lynchpin of our plans going forward.\" Reminding them about the fever that comes from getting bit or from any other injury caused by a roamer, Negan approaches one with Lucille. After apologizing to Lucille, Negan begins to rub it all over the roamer, covering the bat with guts and the bacteria that causes the fever. Holding up 'the new and improved Lucille,' Negan says that even the slightest touch from Lucille will now essentially be a death sentence. He orders the Saviors to do the same to their weapons. Arriving at the Hilltop later that day, Negan and his men hide in the forest just outside the Hilltop. He then issues the order: \"We attack at sundown.\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #122</ref>\n\nSeveral hours later, Negan and his troops arrive at the Hilltop gates, demanding to see Rick. Kal is atop the wall and threatens them by saying they won't survive what's behind the walls. Negan tells him to bring Rick, but Kal says, \"you're talking to me.\" Insulted, Negan has one of his men shoot Kal off the wall. Once again, Negan demands Rick to show himself. After no response from him, Negan orders his men to move in. The Saviors pour into the Hilltop and begin to kill off the residents. As gunfire continues to erupt towards them, Negan and Dwight are separated from the other Saviors. Negan is unaware that Dwight is loading an arrow to kill him when he spots Rick away from the other survivors. He tells Dwight to shoot Rick. Dwight reluctantly does so, hitting Rick in the side. After this, Negan declares that \"without him, they're nothing. Game fucking over.\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #123</ref>\n\nAfter Rick is hit with the arrow, Negan and Dwight retreat to the rest of The Savior horde, hoping to devise a plan of attack against the remaining survivors at Hilltop. By now, the Saviors have re-grouped, and Negan orders them to get ready for their attack on the Hilltop mansion. When they begin their attack, they are immediately surrounded by Rick's forces, so Negan orders them to retreat and head back to The Savior camps on the hillside. Negan assumes that Rick is dead and that the war is essentially over, reasoning that Rick\u2019s forces have neither the manpower to counterattack nor the will to keep fighting without their leader. Megan says that he will be their Savior again, as long as they let him urinate on Rick's dead body.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #124</ref>\n\nNegan arrives at Hilltop's gates and offers to accept their surrender, asking to send out whoever is now in charge - and is stunned when Rick emerges to greet him. Negan asks Rick to surrender, to \"let things go back the way they were\", but Rick refuses. Rick goes on to say that they should pool their resources and people together, and in the current situation, the only ones who are \u201cwinning\u201d are the undead. Negan takes this all in, and Rick says that they can take their supplies, but they must give the survivors something in return; make supplies of their own to give or trade for others via a [[barter system]]. Negan realizes that he has only inflicted suffering upon the communities has \u201csaved\u201d, and apologizes. Rick then slashes Negan's throat with a knife.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #125</ref> Negan tackles Rick and begins beating him, Negan gets the better of him and breaks Rick's leg. Laughing, Negan passes out from blood loss. He wakes up inside one of the rooms in the Hilltop and sees Rick standing over him. Rick reveals that he's going to keep Negan alive so he can see the survivors\u2019 new civilization flourish without him. Rick also tells Negan that he will spend the rest of his life in jail.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #126</ref>\n\n==== A New Beginning ====\nTwo years after the war, Carl goes to the basement of an unknown house and talks to a figure in the shadows. He then says to Carl that he enjoys their talks and that it is good for him to keep track of the time and days passed. Carl says he is leaving, but before he leaves, the figure asks him if, after all this time, all the things they have shared and the talks they have had, Carl still wants to kill him. He turns around and faces the person behind bars, simply saying: \"Yes, Negan. You know I do.\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #127</ref> Negan asks how he was supposed to know that Carl wanted to kill him and tells him not to insult his intelligence. Negan says that he thought the two of them were friends to which Carl walks away, making Negan retreat into the corner of his cell.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #128</ref>\n\nNegan asks if Rick is taking Carl to the Hilltop, slightly shocking Rick. Negan says that he and Carl are friends and that Rick could not break that bond. Negan tells Rick that he is just getting things ready for him and that he will not be in his cell forever. Rick says that he knows Negan will die behind bars, to which Negan says that he won't and that deep down, Rick knows he should have killed Negan.\n\nMagna and her group later come down to see who was in the jail. When they walk down the stairs to where Negan is being held, Negan grabs the bars to his cell and asks if they are here to rescue him, saying that \"they're animals.\" This shocks Magna and her group.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #129</ref> Negan begs to be released and claims Rick is a monster who locked him up and tortured him for speaking out against him. However, Magna does not believe him, having seen actual victims of torture. Negan admits he was lying but had to give it a try. Magna and her companions leave the cell.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #130</ref>\n\n==== Life and Death ====\nSome time later, Negan is bathing and having his hair cut by Olivia outside his cell door. After finishing, Negan walks back to his cell at gunpoint from Andrea, who calls him a 'fucking monster,' much to Negan's amusement. Olivia then proceeds to lock the door, and they both leave Negan alone. However, it turns out Olivia didn't lock Negan's cell properly as the door swings open, which Negan notices.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #140</ref> However, Negan decides not to escape and remains in his cell with the door open until Rick comes downstairs, then taunts him about the numerous ways he could have destroyed Alexandria without anyone realizing, but claimed to stay as sign of good faith and an offering to amend their trust. As Rick locks up the cage and leaves, Negan taunts him again by stating the only reason he's alive is so Rick can prove to himself that he's still a good person, and that he wants everyone else to believe he is the only one who can fix the world.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #141</ref>\n\n==== No Turning Back ====\nAfter a tumultuous community meeting regarding Rick's proposed plan regarding the Whisperers, Rick goes to Negan's cell and asks for his help.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #148</ref> He fills him in on everything that has happened since they've come into conflict with this new group. Negan advises Rick to keep his group happy, even if that means lying to them, touting his expertise as leader of the Saviors, some of whom disliked him. Rick leaves, and Negan dons a grin.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #149</ref> When Negan hears the chants and cheers of Rick's name at a later town meeting, Negan smiles and says, \"atta boy.\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #150</ref>\n\n==== Call to Arms ====\nWhile in his cell, Negan is approached by Brandon Rose, a young Hilltop resident who bears a grudge against Rick, Carl, Sophia, and the Whisperers; Rick killed his father as an act of self-defense, Carl beat him up after he had attacked Sophia who beat him up, and [[Alpha (The Walking Dead)|Alpha]] beheaded his mother. He proposes to help Negan escape, and Negan says he will think about it. Later on, Rick and Michonne discover Negan's empty cell.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #152</ref> After his escape, Negan and Brandon enter Whisperer terrain. Here Brandon tells Negan that he wants Negan to pit Rick and the Whisperers against one another. In response, Negan stabs Brandon in the chest and enters the Whisperer zone alone.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #153</ref> Shortly afterward, Negan is ambushed by a group of Whisperers led by Beta and is taken, prisoner. They bring him to Alpha. Negan introduces himself and declares his love for Alpha.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #154</ref> Negan starts to live with the Whisperers, though without Beta's trust. During a night at camp, Negan sees two Whisperers trying to rape a woman. He stops them but is knocked down by Beta for interfering. Alpha explains that they allow for things like this to happen for women to prove their strength, causing Negan to become angry with her. Later that night, Negan and Alpha have a face to face conversation where Negan reveals how dead inside this world has made him and that he knows Alpha is just pretending to have no emotions, causing Alpha to breakdown. Alpha says that maybe Negan does belong with the Whisperers after all. Negan then slits Alpha's throat, followed by decapitating her, saying \"wait until Rick gets a look at you...\", revealing Negan had no feelings for Alpha all along.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #156</ref>\n\n==== The Whisperer War ====\nA week after disappearing, Negan turns up with Alpha's severed head and shows it to Rick and Andrea, who are very hesitant to believe and trust him. Negan reassures them that he only wants trust. He says Rick's way of thinking is inspiring and tries to convince them that his time in prison has rehabilitated him. He says he could've taken several chances and attacked Rick, but he didn't. He wants to fight with him, not against him. Rick finally agrees to let Negan out of the cell, but not in a community. He will live in an outpost, alone, with only enough food and weaponry to keep him surviving. He is not allowed these freedoms yet, though. He is going to be monitored for a long time and will fight on the front lines against the Whisperers. He will earn his freedom after the war, unless he slips up, in which case he will be immediately killed. They eventually win the war and he later admits he was wrong about his decisions and leaves to fend for himself there he is confronted by Maggie who wants revenge, but decides not to kill him after seeing him in a depressed state. (Issue 174)\n\nIn the Letter Hacks for Issue 182, Kirkman confirmed that Negan will not return to the series. When asked if Negan would receive another barbed-wire baseball bat, Kirkman answered, \"If we see Negan again - and we won't - I'd be really surprised if he had a bat with him. It feels like he put that behind him in his last appearance.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://comicbook.com/thewalkingdead/2018/08/01/the-walking-dead-negan-gone-leaving-comic-last-issue/ |title = Is Negan Really Leaving 'The Walking Dead' Forever?}}</ref>\n\n==== Rest in Peace ====\nIn the final issue, 20 years later, it is revealed that Negan is still alive. He avoids all contact with the other survivors, living on food parcels left by Carl and maintaining a state of mourning for his wife Lucille.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #193</ref>\n\n=== Television series ===\n====Backstory====\nIn season 8, Negan vaguely states that he helped young people improve upon their weaknesses and molded them into stronger individuals. Negan later met a woman named Lucille and the pair fell in love and married. Over time however, Negan gradually became unfaithful towards her as he constantly lied and even engaged in an affair. In the onset of the outbreak, Negan was present alongside Lucille who had succumbed to an unknown illness and eventually perished. When she became a walker, Negan was unable to bring himself to put his wife down; this act of weakness would continue to haunt him and thus Negan strived to become a much stronger person.\n\nSometime after the outbreak, Negan established himself as the tyrannical [[dictator]] of a community of survivors called the \"Saviors.\" He wields a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire that he calls \"Lucille\" (after his wife). Negan quickly gathered a large following and established outposts in various locations around the Washington, D.C. area. Within the structure of the Saviors, Negan has a right-hand man named [[Simon (The Walking Dead)|Simon]] as well as several lieutenants, including Wade, Bud, Gavin, [[Arat (The Walking Dead)|Arat]] and [[Dwight (The Walking Dead)|Dwight]]. At some point, Negan and the Saviors encountered the Hilltop Colony and extorted its leader Gregory into giving them half their supplies on a regular basis; failure to do so would result in the Saviors killing members of their community. To set an example, his goons used a baseball bat to beat a 16-year-old resident named Rory to death, after which Gregory submitted to Negan's demands. Negan and his men also made contact with the community known as the Kingdom and made a similar agreement with their leader [[King Ezekiel]]. At some point, Dwight fled the Saviors with his wife Sherry, sister-in-law Tina, and a truck full of supplies that they refer to as Patty. Negan subsequently sent out a large group, led by Wade, to retrieve them and the stolen supplies.\n\n==== Season 6 ====\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 6)}}\nThe Saviors become the main antagonists during the second half of season 6 and with their mysterious leader known as Negan being mentioned several times prior to his appearance in the season finale. His name is first heard in \"[[No Way Out (The Walking Dead)|No Way Out]]\" when a group of bikers, led by a man named Bud, accost [[Daryl Dixon]], [[Abraham Ford]] and [[Sasha Williams (The Walking Dead)|Sasha Williams]] and attempt to steal their weapons, but Daryl kills them with a rocket launcher.\n\n[[File:Negan_Rick.jpg|thumb|Rick and his group kneel before Negan]]\nIn the season finale, \"[[Last Day on Earth (The Walking Dead)|Last Day on Earth]]\", while driving the ailing [[Maggie Greene]] to the Hilltop, Rick and his group run into multiple roadblocks set by the Saviors, which eventually causes Rick's group to travel by foot. While walking through the woods, the group is ambushed by a large contingent of the Saviors led by Negan's right-hand man Simon, who take Rick and his group's weapons and make them get on their knees.\n\nDwight also brings out Daryl, [[Glenn Rhee]], [[Michonne]], and [[Rosita Espinosa]], and makes them get on their knees, too. Negan then comes out of their RV and tells Rick that he must give him all of his possessions, and that Rick and everyone else at Alexandria work for Negan now; he \"owns\" them. Because Rick's group killed a lot of Saviors, Negan tells Rick's group they have to be punished, and he is going to beat one of them to death with \"Lucille\". Negan can't decide whom to kill, so he decides to choose the victim in a game of \"[[Eeny, meeny, miny, moe]]\", which he recites while pointing Lucille at each member of the group, before landing on an unseen individual, saying, \"you are it.\" Negan warns the group not to say anything or to move, and he begins to beat the unseen individual to death, as everyone else in the group screams.\n\n==== Season 7 ====\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 7)}}\nNegan's chosen victim is Abraham, whom he bludgeons to death with \"Lucille\". Enraged, Daryl rushes Negan and punches him in the face, only to be stopped by three Saviors directly. As a reprisal for Daryl's attack, Negan beats Glenn to death in front of Maggie, his wife. Negan then presents Rick with an ultimatum: pledge total loyalty, or the rest of the group will die. When Rick remains defiant, Negan threatens to kill Rick's son [[Carl Grimes|Carl]] and the rest of the group unless Rick cuts the boy's arm off. After some hesitation, Rick raises the axe; Negan stops him, knowing that he has broken the elder Grimes's will. Negan then allows the surviving members of the group to depart with the warning that the Saviors will return in a week to collect their supplies. As insurance against further retaliation, Negan takes Daryl with him. Negan is shown to rule the Sanctuary (the main Savior stronghold) through fear and rewarding his personal army of enforcers (who identify themselves as \"Negan\" in a show of loyalty). He keeps Daryl locked in a cell and hopes to break his will and mold him into one of his Saviors, but Daryl refuses to submit. Negan and his men arrive at Alexandria earlier than expected. He forces Rick to give him a tour while Rick holds Lucille and makes pithy comments along the way. Both Rick and [[Gabriel Stokes (The Walking Dead)|Father Gabriel]] lied to Negan that Maggie didn't make it. He later talks Carl out of shooting a Savior, and decides to take all of Alexandria's guns. When two guns go missing from the inventory, Negan threatens to kill Olivia ([[Ann Mahoney]]) if they aren't found. This is later resolved when Rick finds them as well as a hunting rifle which wasn't in the armory. This impresses Negan who states that \"this is something to build a relationship on\" before telling him to find them something interesting for next time. Before leaving, Negan takes back Lucille and tells Rick that \"I just slid my dick down your throat and you thanked me for it\". Negan meets his men returning with supplies from the Hilltop. They are attacked by Carl, who kills two of the Saviors and demands Negan come forward. Negan is nonchalant about the imminent danger to him, but develops a respect for Carl. He later sits Carl down and states that he wants to get to know him better, so he should uncover his eye. When Carl begrudgingly does so, Negan pokes fun at the boy's missing eye, but when he sees Carl become visibly upset, he shows genuine remorse and apologizes. He grows to genuinely like Carl, and later brings him to watch as he burns Mark, a Savior who has displeased him, with a hot iron to teach everyone a lesson about \u201cfollowing the rules\u201d. He then decides to bring Carl back to Alexandria, where they wait for Rick. Negan is approached in Alexandria by Spencer Monroe, who attempts to bond with him over whiskey and a game of pool. The two seem to hit it off, until Spencer tells Negan about how dangerous Rick is and that he should be in charge for both of their sakes. Negan states that while Rick hates him, he respects that Rick was brave enough to threaten him and swallow his pride to protect others. Disappointed that Spencer \"has no guts\" for going to him while Rick is gone, Negan [[Disembowelment|eviscerates]] Spencer with a knife while jokingly stating that \"he did have guts after all.\" This provokes [[Rosita Espinosa]] to draw a gun and shoot at Negan, though she misses and instead hits Lucille. Enraged, Negan threatens to have Rosita's face mutilated unless she tells him where she got the bullet. When she refuses, Negan tells his lieutenant [[Arat (The Walking Dead)|Arat]] to kill someone, causing Olivia to be gunned down. Rick, having just arrived, sees this and demands to know what happened. Negan calmly replies that he has tried to be reasonable as he returned Carl unharmed and killed Spencer for Rick. When [[Eugene Porter|Eugene]] confesses to making the bullet, Negan takes him prisoner and tells Rick that he is \"way in the hole\" for this incident no matter how many supplies they gather, before departing. After this, Rick finally knows he has to stop Negan, and hereby attempts to convince other communities to put an end to Negan's reign of terror by forming an alliance to defeat their common enemy. Negan reappears in \"[[Hostiles and Calamities]]\" where he greets Eugene entering the Sanctuary. After determining that Eugene is indeed highly intelligent, Negan allows him to get comfortable within the Sanctuary and even sends him two of his wives to provide him with company. When Negan discovers that Sherry is gone, he suspects her of freeing Daryl and has Dwight beaten and thrown in a cell. When he is convinced that Dwight wasn't involved and is still loyal, he sends him after Sherry, only to learn that she supposedly was killed by walkers. When he finds evidence of Dr. Carson aiding in Daryl's escape (secretly planted by Dwight), Negan throws him in the fire-pit before apologizing to Dwight for doubting him, and offering condolences for his loss. Negan visits a captive [[Sasha Williams (The Walking Dead)|Sasha Williams]] (who came to the Sanctuary to kill him) and discovers one of his Saviors, David, attempting to rape her. Negan states that rape is against their rules and that he doesn't tolerate such behavior. David apologizes, but Negan rams a knife through his throat, stating he does not \"accept his apology\". He then apologizes to Sasha and gets her a new T-shirt to replace the one David ripped before complimenting her on her brazen attack. After confirming Rick didn't sanction it, Negan states that she would make a welcome addition to the Saviors, despite his actions against her. He then leaves her with a knife and a choice: kill herself or kill David once he reanimates to show him she's willing to work with him. He later returns to find, to his delight, that she has killed David. He takes the knife back and informs her that she's on the right path before stating he knows Rick is conspiring against him as he has a spy in his midst. He's confident Sasha will be able to help him put an end to Rick's plans. Negan leads a convoy of Saviors to Alexandria with Simon, Dwight, Eugene and Sasha in tow with plans to bring Rick back under his control. He reveals the Scavengers (a group of survivors Rick paid to help them) are actually working for him as they hold Rick at gunpoint. Negan brings a coffin forward and reveals Sasha is inside, stating they can have her back alive and he'll let most of them live if they meet his demands, which include all their weapons, Daryl returned to him and for Rick to pick someone to be killed by Lucille. He opens the coffin to find Sasha has reanimated as a walker. After fending her off, the situation devolves into a gunfight. Negan manages to capture Rick and Carl, and prepares to kill Carl. Unfortunately for Negan, the Saviors are ambushed by Ezekiel and forces from the Kingdom as well as Maggie leading a group from Hilltop. Caught off guard by Rick's reinforcements and rapidly losing men, Negan orders a retreat. Once back at the Sanctuary, he questions Eugene as to how Sasha died in the coffin (suspecting foul play on his part) before declaring to the assembled Saviors that they are going to war.\n\n==== Season 8 ====\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 8)}}\nNegan appears in the season premiere, \"[[Mercy (The Walking Dead)|Mercy]],\" when Rick leads an army of assembled survivors outside the Sanctuary. More amused than worried, Negan refuses to march his people out to fight Rick just to prove \"that my dick is bigger than yours\". Rick offers Negan's lieutenants and the Saviors inside the chance to surrender, but states that Negan still has to die. Negan attempts to divide them by bringing out Gregory to order the Hilltoppers to retreat, but this tactic fails. They open fire, decimating the Sanctuary walls, but Negan and his people take cover. They are then surprised by a massive herd of walkers led by Daryl before the gates are blown open and the herd funnels inside. Negan becomes trapped in a trailer with Gabriel. \"[[The Big Scary U]]\" opens in the Sanctuary prior to Rick's attack with Negan meeting with his chief lieutenants discussing strategy. When Simon suggests they wipe out one of the communities entirely, Negan becomes incensed, stating that people are critical to what they're building. He instead wants to capture and publicly execute Rick, Maggie and Ezekiel to cow their people into submission. The episode then returns to Negan and Gabriel in the trailer, discussing their views on survival. When Gabriel tries to get Negan to confess his sins before death, he is evasive until he finally admits his greatest regret was his treatment of his first wife prior to the outbreak, stating she died of cancer and he couldn't put her down. The two manage to escape by \"gutting up\" and Negan is able reassert control of the spiraling situation in the Sanctuary. Negan returns to Alexandria to counterattack when he's met by Carl (who, unbeknownst to Negan, is dying from a walker bite) who attempts to dissuade him from attacking and even offers to be killed to spare the rest. He asks Negan if this is what he wanted or who he wanted to be, and his words seem to strike a chord. Negan attacks Alexandria anyway, however, and confronts Rick. After a brutal hand-to-hand fight, he throws Rick through a window. Rick retreats into the sewers with Michonne and the rest of the Alexandrians.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/walking-dead-recap-season-8-midseason-finale-1202635498/ |title='Walking Dead' Recap: Tide of War Turns in Midseason Finale (SPOILERS) |last=Otterson |first=Joe |date=December 10, 2017 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=December 10, 2017}}</ref> Negan meets with Simon to handle the matter of the Scavengers. Simon assumes he wants them exterminated, but Negan instead wants him to give them the standard warning and kill only one, as they are a resource just like the other communities. Rick later contacts him via walkie-talkie, and informs him that Carl is dead and that his last wish was for them to make peace, something Rick sees as impossible. Negan is saddened by the news, stating Carl was the future before asking Rick to surrender, to no avail. Negan begins preparing the Saviors for an attack on Hilltop to end the war. Since their stores of ammunition are low from breaking the prior walker siege, Negan comes up with a plan to use the walker virus to their advantage by coating their weapons in walker flesh, including Lucille. Negan leads a convoy of Saviors to the Hilltop when his car is rammed by Rick who pursues him into an abandoned building. Negan attempts to fight back, but falls through the floor and loses Lucille. Unarmed and being hunted in the dark, Negan attempts to make a deal, offering to forgive Rick's transgressions and reduce the Savior's cut of supplies in exchange for peace. Rick refuses, stating Negan cares for nothing save Lucille, which he then proceeds to light on fire. Negan furiously attacks Rick before the two are surrounded by walkers and flames, forcing Negan to reclaim Lucille and flee \u2014 only to be captured by [[Jadis (The Walking Dead)|Jadis]]. Jadis tortures Negan until he reveals that he had nothing to do with the massacre of her people; he manages to half-coerce, half-talk her down after some struggle into freeing him while she was getting ready to receive a helicopter at the junkyard. He makes his way back to the Savior compound to find that Simon has been ruling in his stead, and is responsible for the bloodshed at Jadis' compound. He regains control by challenging Simon to a fight and killing him with his bare hands, and making Dwight the instrument of his revenge against Rick by forcing him to lure Rick's group into a trap with false information. Michonne contacts Negan via walkie-talkie and reads him a letter Carl wrote him before he died urging a peaceful solution to the conflict; though moved by the message, Negan refuses, and swears he will kill Rick and every last one of his group. Rick's group shows up to challenge the Saviors. Negan orders his men to open fire, but discovers that Eugene has tampered with their weapons, rendering them helpless. Rick's group kills several of Negan's men, while Rick and Negan have a final battle that ends with Rick cutting Negan's throat open. However, Rick decides to save his enemy's life as he believes it is what Carl would want. Later, Negan recovers in the infirmary in Alexandria, where Rick and Michonne inform him that he will be imprisoned and rot in a cell for the rest of his life, and serve as a reminder that people are capable of change and as evidence that they will bring civilization.\n\n==== Season 9 ====\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 9)}}\nRick goes down a basement to talk to a locked up Negan. He mentions that it's been 35 days since Gregory's execution. He talks about how everything has changed after the war and how the communities are working together on fixing a bridge, which will be the link to their future. \u201cWe\u2019re making a new beginning,\u201d Rick says smiling with hope. After Rick finishes narrating his story, Negan, sporting a much larger beard than normal, questions when he will be able to have a look at the thriving communities but Rick tells him never and tells him he will die in his cell. Rick claims they are thriving without him to build a future and Negan taunts him about Carl but an angry Rick shuts him up and forbids him from mentioning Carl. Negan responds with a grin: \"You're not saving this world, Rick. You just get it ready for me,\" warning him that the peace between the communities won't last too long and that he will not be locked up forever. Negan is visited by Michonne after he refuses to eat. He says he\u2019ll only eat if she stays to talk to him. She agrees to stay for an hour. Negan tells Michonne he's not meant to be in the cell just as she's not meant to be doing random chores and looking after kids. Michonne shoots back that she's helping rebuild civilization. Negan admits he's happy his wife never got to see him like this, revealing that they wish they had a kid like Carl, but his wife got cancer and the world changed. Michonne says she sees Carl everywhere, and when Negan asks about her own kid, she angrily says Andre didn\u2019t make it. Negan says it's better this way because his wife wasn\u2019t made for the apocalypse. \u201cWe were built for more,\u201d he says. Michonne reacts in anger and storms off. A while later, Michonne returns to Negan's cell and acknowledges that they\u2019re similar but distinguishes that her worldview is a lot more positive than his. She finally gets him to eat, and as she leaves he asks her to see Lucille. Michonne tells him they don\u2019t have the bat anymore and leaves smiling. After she leaves, Negan starts to violently bang his head against the wall. Maggie arrives in Alexandria and after convincing Michonne, she is let into Negan's cell. He chuckles at her as Maggie demands he get on his knees. From the shadows, Negan taunts Maggie about killing Glenn and begs her to kill him. She opens the cell and slams him against the wall as he begs for death. Sobbing, he admits he wants to die so he can be reunited with his wife Lucille. She tells him to get back to his cell because he is  already \u201cworse than dead\u201d.\n\nSix years later, Negan remains a prisoner in Alexandria but has adopted a much less antagonistic attitude and struck up a friendship with Judith Grimes, Rick's daughter. Negan helps Judith with math problems and tells her a story from his childhood where he tried to take in stray dogs only for it to go badly for him when she asks for advice with dealing with Magna's group. Judith tells Negan that \"it doesn't matter if you're good or bad on the inside, the numbers don't care\" causing Negan to smile as she walks away. Negan is visited by Gabriel on a weekly basis who tries to help Negan become a better person. Negan taunts that he can hear a lot of things from his window and that Rosita has said some interesting stuff, but not about Gabriel. When Gabriel returns, Negan continues to taunt him until Gabriel reveals that Rosita is at the Hilltop, hurt and Gabriel can't go to her because he has to look after Negan. Negan gives an apparently sincere apology for his behavior upon hearing this, but Gabriel storms out. Later, while playing with his [[tennis ball]], Negan realizes that his cell door is unlocked. With a smirk, Negan departs his cell and escapes. Negan makes his escape from Alexandria following a brief encounter with Judith who lets Negan take her compass. Negan wanders through the changed world, losing his food following an encounter with two walkers and inadvertently returning to the clearing where he murdered Glenn and Abraham. Negan gets a new leather jacket from an abandoned clothing store, but is nearly killed by a pack of feral dogs in the process. Negan finally makes his return to the Sanctuary, only to find it completely abandoned and all of the Saviors gone. Negan tries to adapt to life alone, but can't. After putting down some reanimated Saviors, Negan abandons the Sanctuary and his old life for good and returns to Alexandria on a motorcycle recovered from a hidden room. Confronted by Judith near Alexandria, Negan admits that she was right that there is nothing left for him outside and he is willing to return to his cell rather than be alone. Negan then allows Judith to take him back to Alexandria. Negan is visited by Michonne after Judith disappears. Negan's cell now contains a bookshelf with several books and a small seat where he can comfortably read next to the bookshelf. Michonne demands to know what Negan talks to Judith about and he admits to telling her stories about Carl and Rick and the war, stories which Judith has never heard from anyone else before. Negan points out that Judith would be able to tell if he was lying so he is always honest with her, even when she asked about Glenn and Abraham. Negan urges Michonne to listen to and be honest with her daughter and helps Michonne realize that Judith went to try and help her friends. Negan is moved out of his cell during a dangerous [[blizzard]] as he will freeze to death otherwise. Negan attempts his usual antics to annoy everyone else, but is ignored as everyone now knows his tricks. Negan is the first to realize that something is wrong, leading to Eugene discovering that the chimney is clogged. Though everyone contemplates leaving Negan behind to die, they take him with them as they travel to Aaron's house. However, Judith hears Daryl's dog barking and runs off into the storm. Negan immediately risks his own life to chase after Judith and save her, finding her by following the barking dog, though he suffers a leg wound from flying debris in the process. Negan saves Judith and at her request, the dog too and carries her to shelter for the remainder of the storm. The next day, a recovering Negan is visited in the infirmary by a grateful Michonne. Negan calls Judith a spitfire and tells Michonne that she has been through enough. The two exchange friendly banter back and forth, Michonne having lost her hostility towards Negan after his heroic act of saving her daughter. Negan suggests that in a conflict, no one is able to admit that they are the evil ones in the situation indicating reflection and possibly remorse for his past actions.\n\n==== Season 10 ====\n{{See also|The Walking Dead (season 10)}}\nFollowing the storm, Negan is allowed some leeway and works in Alexandria as a gardner and maintenance man under guard until Father Gabriel pairs him up with Aaron to protect Alexandria from repeated walker attacks. After being attacked by Walkers while on patrol, Aaron is temporarily blinded and struggles his way to a cabin where he finds Negan who helps him. The two then return to Alexandria. While defending Lydia from an attack, Negan accidentally kills Margo in self-defense and faces possible execution. He inexplicably escapes, chased by a former Savior named Brandon who is a fan of his. After attempting to get a mother and son to safety at Hilltop, an enraged Negan kills Brandon following his murder of the two.\n\nApparently reverting back to his old ways and armed with a new Lucille created by Brandon, Negan joins the Whisperers and becomes the lover of Alpha. Negan aids in the attack on Hilltop, having the Whisperers block the roads so that the Hilltoppers can't easily escape, though Negan tries to convince Alpha to spare everyone and offer them a choice to join her. Following the attack, Negan encounters Aaron in the woods and fails to convince Aaron that he means him no harm. Negan captures Lydia and brings Alpha to her location, though he fails to talk Alpha out of killing her daughter. Negan is revealed to have stashed Lydia elsewhere and slits Alpha's throat, killing her. Negan then delivers Alpha's severed zombified head to Carol who comments that it took him long enough, revealing that Negan and Carol were working together to take down Alpha.\n\n===Others===\nNegan appears as a playable character in the fighting video game ''[[Tekken 7]]'', added as the sixth and final part of the second season pass on February 28, 2019, with his appearance based on his television counterpart.

I didn't realize how much I missed having a truly awful antagonist like [[The Governor (The Walking Dead)|The Governor]] in this series until now. The villain's voice is very distinct, allowing Kirkman to toy with a very different approach to dialogue.

He is happily married to his wife, Lucille, but nonetheless has a mistress on the side who doesn't know he is married. During an argument, Lucille collapses and he rushes her to the hospital, where she is diagnosed with [[cancer]]. As his wife is tended to, Negan tells his mistress the truth, and she immediately leaves him. When the [[zombie apocalypse]] starts, the hospital workers tell Negan they are being forced to abandon the hospital and he should leave with them, but he refuses to leave Lucille's side. Lucille dies when the power goes out, short-circuiting her life-support machine; moments later, she reanimates as a [[zombie]]. He flees the hospital and finds a boy being trapped by zombies, and helps to dispatch them with a fire extinguisher. In return, Negan asks the boy to kill Lucille for him.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/walking-dead-will-negans-backstory-be-explored-941857 |title='Walking Dead': Will Negan's Backstory Be Explored? |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=October 29, 2016 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=October 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==== A Larger World ====\nAt some point after the outbreak, Negan is found by a group led by a man named [[Dwight (The Walking Dead)|Dwight]]. He slowly takes control over this group from Dwight, renaming them the Saviors and ruling them with an iron fist. Negan, along with his team (which includes at least 50 or more other men), makes a deal with the Hilltop Colony: the Saviors would use the weaponry the other group was lacking to cull all zombies wandering near the Hilltop's premises; in return, the Saviors would obtain half of Hilltop's supplies, such as livestock and crops. Negan punishes even the smallest infraction (real or perceived) with brutal violence; for example, he orders the (attempted) death of the Hilltop's leader, [[Gregory (The Walking Dead)|Gregory]], because he feels Gregory is not sufficiently loyal.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #95</ref>\n\n==== Something To Fear ====\nLater, Negan, along with 50 other Saviors, snuck up on [[Rick Grimes|Rick]]'s group and subdued Rick by surprise. They lined up all of the survivors from the van (Rick, [[Carl Grimes|Carl]], [[Glenn Rhee|Glenn]], [[Maggie Greene|Maggie ]], [[Michonne]], and Heath), telling them that Negan wanted revenge for the Saviors who were killed. Without Rick's consent, Negan imposed a binding deal: everything that belonged to the Alexandria Safe-Zone now belonged to the Saviors. Negan also introduced his weapon of choice; Lucille, a baseball bat covered in barbed wire. After a long talk about the new world order and whom he should beat to death using Lucille, he finally chose his victim at random: Glenn.  Negan told the mourning and crying group that the Saviors would be back in one week to collect half of everything that Alexandria Safe-Zone owned, or there would be more killings. Rick vowed to avenge Glenn's murder and kill Negan. Negan laughed at this, beat Rick with his bare hands, and then turned around, leaving the survivors with Glenn's mangled corpse.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #100</ref>\n\n==== What Comes After ====\nNegan and the Saviors later arrived at the Alexandria Safe-Zone for their first offering. Negan and the Saviors begin killing the roamers in the surrounding area and scavenge each of the houses for supplies. Negan and his men depart from the Safe-Zone with supplies, but, unbeknownst to them, Carl is hiding in the truck with an assault rifle. Once the Saviors get back to their base, Negan is amazed to see that Dwight is still alive. A Savior finds Carl, and Carl uses the rifle to kill six Saviors. They surround Carl, and he demands to speak with Negan. When Negan arrives, Carl fires at them until he loses control of his gun. Dwight is about to kill Carl when Negan stops Dwight and says, \"Is that any way to treat our new guest?\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #104</ref>\n\nInstead of taking immediate action against young Carl, Negan shows interest in getting to know the poor child. He goes as far as to lead him through the Saviors' facilities, revealing that he is the leader of a cult-like domain of selfless followers who bow to his every word and command. Many followers in his ranks are living on a point system in order to sustain their lives, though many give in to his graces in exchange for a better lifestyle, most notably the women in his \"[[harem]]\" whom he considers his \"wives\".\n\nNegan reveals that he'd like to get to know Carl a little better, but he gets distracted by Carl's bandaged face. He orders Carl to remove the bandages. Carl allows him to see it only after being threatened; he removes the bandages to reveal the disturbing results of having been shot. Negan, in a state of disbelief and awe, jokingly mocks the deformity and goes as far as to ask Carl if he can touch the part of his skull showing through Carl's exposed eye-socket, which causes Carl to break finally and cry. This appears to have an odd effect on Negan, who takes back the gesture and apologizes, seeing that he has finally found a weakness in the child he finds so dangerous.\n\nIn a ritualistic fashion, complete with call-and-response chanting, with the followers answering to Negan's words, Negan demonstrates that whoever falls onto his bad graces is dealt with by having their face seared by a hot iron. Tied to the end of a pole, the tool is held over a fire before being handed to Negan, who presses it against the victim's face as punishment for their betrayal. In this case, it is the face of Amber's former lover Mark, who is left deformed in the same manner as Dwight, with a portion of his face permanently scarred and an eyeball exposed. After the ritual, Negan dismisses his congregation before turning to Carl, who hands back \"Lucille\", and Negan leads him away, contemplating what to do with him.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #105</ref>\n\nNegan runs into Rick while the latter was on his way to find Carl. Negan tells Rick how eager he is to show him \"what he has done to his son\".<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #106</ref> Rick, in a fit of rage, then attacks Negan before Negan reveals that Carl is fine, and Negan clarifies that he is eager to show Rick \"that he has done nothing to his son.\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #107</ref>\n\n==== March to War ====\nSeveral days later, Negan arrives at the Alexandria Safe-Zone a few days ahead of schedule; he's informed that the community is \"practically\" out of supplies, and Rick went out looking for more. Negan decides that he will stay in Alexandria until Rick returns from the supply run. Negan is later approached by Spencer Monroe who tells Negan that Rick is not a suitable leader for the community and asks that once Negan assassinates Rick, he be given control over the Safe-Zone. He responds by telling Spencer that Rick may hate him, but, he has guts, unlike Spencer, who acted like a coward. Negan then slashes Spencer's stomach, killing him almost instantly.\n\nRick later returns with supplies. Negan initially demands all of it but then decides to take nothing, as repayment for having killed Spencer. Rick insists that they take their share, and Negan has no objections. As the Saviors are driving back to the foundry, Negan notices Rick and a few others are following them. An instant later, the driver is shot and killed. Confused and angry, Negan takes Lucille and sees Rick pointing a gun at his head. Suddenly, a gunshot is heard, and Rick's gun is destroyed as well as those of the others who came out with him. Negan remarks on how stupid Rick and the others are to use bullets on the roamers instead of saving them for \"the much more dangerous thinkers\" (i.e., the living). Negan reveals that before every pickup, he has a back-up team armed with guns surround the Safe-Zone and guard the area while he and the other Saviors go in and salvage for supplies. With a crazed smile on his face, Negan leans into Rick and says that he and the Safe-Zone residents are \"fucking fucked.\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #112</ref>\n\nNegan smiles and says that in a stand-off situation, snipers tend to give away their position after several shots. He clarifies that Rick's \"[[Andrea (The Walking Dead)|sniper bitch]] is as good as dead,\" causing Rick to try and strike him. As Negan holds him off, Carl shoots off a portion of Lucille, causing the Saviors to open fire at the Safe-Zone walls. Negan orders them to stop, and is shocked and angry about the damage to Lucille. Negan issues an ultimatum: \"Give me the boy, or I'll bash in all four skulls of the people out here!\" Negan admits that he liked Carl at first and that he never had a kid of his own; if he did, he wanted him to be like Carl. Rick says that if Carl dies, their agreement is over, but, Negan states that it already ''is'' over. He orders his men to line up Rick, Heath, Nicholas, and Holly, then begins to decide which one to kill first. He notices a figure falling from the bell tower and smugly repeats that he knew Rick's sniper was good as dead, not realizing that it's not Andrea, but Connor.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #113</ref>\n\nNegan taunts Rick about Andrea's supposed demise, and Nicholas interrupts him, pleading for his life. Negan berates Nicholas for doing this and accuses him of being a coward. He asks Rick, Heath, or Holly to ask him to kill Nicholas and says if they do so, he will spare them. However, Heath tells him, no, and so Negan begins to pick which one of them he will kill.\n\nNegan is interrupted when [[Paul \"Jesus\" Monroe|Paul Monroe]] grabs a Savior by the foot and uses him as a shield from the Saviors' bullets. Negan tells his men to stand down, and when he does this, Paul leaps out of a trench and kicks the nearest Savior in the face. Paul orders Rick and the others into a trench and proceeds to fight his way towards Negan. When Paul reaches Negan, he manages to disarm him and hold him hostage. Paul stalls the Saviors until [[King Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] and his men arrive. Negan breaks free from Paul and runs to a truck, where he retreats back to the Sanctuary with his men. Negan is later seen back at the Sanctuary, where he gives the Saviors a speech about their being the dominant force in the world, and they need to remind people of that. Negan then states they are going to war.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #114</ref>\n\n==== All Out War ====\nSeveral days later, Rick's army arrives at the Saviors' base and demands that Negan come out. Rick offers him a chance to surrender and spare the women and children in his community. \" Negan refuses Rick's offer, and reveals that Gregory has defected to the Saviors, meaning that Hilltop is now under Negan\u2019s control.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #115</ref> He calls Dwight, ordering him to bring the men from the outposts back to help drive off Rick's army. Dwight agrees but due to the commotion, Negan doesn't notice the former's hesitation to act immediately. As more men rush outside, Negan orders them to start shooting the army before all their snipers are killed. He suddenly notices that all their snipers are taking cover and is initially confused as to why Rick's militia are shooting not the snipers, but the windows. He then notices the large herd of zombies that are rapidly approaching the Sanctuary walls. Suddenly, Holly drives through the fence, destroying a portion of it and letting the herd inside. Negan frantically orders his men back inside the foundry but notices that Holly is still alive. He sees a zombie about to kill her and dispatches it. As she looks up, Negan smiles and says that she wasn't \"going to get off THAT fucking easy.\" As the zombies converge on the courtyard area, the Saviors retreat inside the foundry to develop a new strategy.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #116</ref>\n\nNegan delivers an analogy to a group of Saviors about how you can destroy a man \"by fucking his vagina\", meaning that the best way to destroy a man's heart is by destroying the woman he loves; Negan clearly believes this to be Holly. She corrects him by saying he's got the wrong woman; Rick loves Andrea, and she was in love with Abraham, the man Dwight killed. Negan refuses to listen, insisting that she is the one who killed Connor \"and a terrible liar.\" He then orders her taken away and goes off to clear his head. Later, Negan is seen outside with more Saviors trying to clear the courtyard of all the zombies, swearing that if any of them die he will \"fuck them up.\" Eventually, too many roamers pour in the fence and Negan's group retreat inside once more. Negan realizes that if the herd keeps them stuck inside for more than one day, they will all be dead, and he orders squads outside every two hours to clean up the infestation by any means necessary. He goes to interrogate Holly, but catches David in the middle of trying to [[rape]] her. Negan demands that he get away from her and grabs him by the collar. He angrily reminds David one of the Savior's main rules: \"We don't rape\". As punishment for breaking this rule, Negan proceeds to stab David in the neck and apologizes to Holly, telling her that \"they [The Saviors] aren't monsters.\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #117</ref>\n\nNegan gets word of one of his outposts being overrun by Rick's army and sends more men to fortify the remaining ones. This, in turn, leads to Ezekiel's army being eradicated in a failed attack.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #118</ref> Negan also finds a way to eliminate all of the zombies that had flooded into the Sanctuary's courtyard, for he is later seen heading towards Alexandria. When he arrives at the Safe-Zone, he throws a grenade over the wall, demolishing one of the houses and getting Rick's attention. He threatens that 'there's more where that came from' and insists that he's here to parlay. To support his claim, he has a blindfolded Holly brought out of his truck and offers to release her back to Rick. Rick agrees to talk only when Holly is safely back inside, and Negan agrees. This is later shown to be a ploy: it is revealed that Negan had Holly killed and she later reanimated.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #119</ref> As the Alexandrians are distracted by this revelation, Negan orders his men to surround Alexandria and throws another grenade over the wall. Suddenly, gunfire erupts from behind several buildings. Surprised by this, Negan orders his men behind one of the trucks. He asks for one more grenade to use as cover and tells his men \"the last boat is leaving... you'd better fucking be on it.\" He manages to escape, and they can make a fast exit. When a Savior makes an offhand comment about retreating, Negan retorts that this wasn't a retreat. Pointing towards the smoke coming from Alexandria, he comments that this means they've \"just fucking won.\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #120</ref>\n\nAfter successfully bombarding Alexandria, Negan leads his men back to Sanctuary. He sees a herd of roamers attacking several people from Alexandria. He orders his men to kill the roamers and wonders aloud why they are out here beyond the wall. Nevertheless, he orders [[Eugene Porter]] and the others to be taken back with them. Later, Negan finds out that Eugene was making ammunition for Rick's army and goes to see him. Flanked by Dwight and Carson, Negan orders Eugene to begin producing ammo for the Saviors. When the latter refuses, Negan hands Carson Lucille, and tells Eugene what will happen if he refuses to cooperate; smiling, he says that he could disfigure Eugene's face or castrate him. Eugene still refuses to betray Rick, and Negan leaves Eugene \"with his thoughts and his dick... while he still has it.\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #121</ref> Early the following day, Negan reveals to the Saviors that he has come up with a  plan that will help them win the war. He has assembled a group of roamers inside the courtyard to demonstrate his idea, exclaiming \"they are the lynchpin of our plans going forward.\" Reminding them about the fever that comes from getting bit or from any other injury caused by a roamer, Negan approaches one with Lucille. After apologizing to Lucille, Negan begins to rub it all over the roamer, covering the bat with guts and the bacteria that causes the fever. Holding up 'the new and improved Lucille,' Negan says that even the slightest touch from Lucille will now essentially be a death sentence. He orders the Saviors to do the same to their weapons. Arriving at the Hilltop later that day, Negan and his men hide in the forest just outside the Hilltop. He then issues the order: \"We attack at sundown.\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #122</ref>\n\nSeveral hours later, Negan and his troops arrive at the Hilltop gates, demanding to see Rick. Kal is atop the wall and threatens them by saying they won't survive what's behind the walls. Negan tells him to bring Rick, but Kal says, \"you're talking to me.\" Insulted, Negan has one of his men shoot Kal off the wall. Once again, Negan demands Rick to show himself. After no response from him, Negan orders his men to move in. The Saviors pour into the Hilltop and begin to kill off the residents. As gunfire continues to erupt towards them, Negan and Dwight are separated from the other Saviors. Negan is unaware that Dwight is loading an arrow to kill him when he spots Rick away from the other survivors. He tells Dwight to shoot Rick. Dwight reluctantly does so, hitting Rick in the side. After this, Negan declares that \"without him, they're nothing. Game fucking over.\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #123</ref>\n\nAfter Rick is hit with the arrow, Negan and Dwight retreat to the rest of The Savior horde, hoping to devise a plan of attack against the remaining survivors at Hilltop. By now, the Saviors have re-grouped, and Negan orders them to get ready for their attack on the Hilltop mansion. When they begin their attack, they are immediately surrounded by Rick's forces, so Negan orders them to retreat and head back to The Savior camps on the hillside. Negan assumes that Rick is dead and that the war is essentially over, reasoning that Rick\u2019s forces have neither the manpower to counterattack nor the will to keep fighting without their leader. Megan says that he will be their Savior again, as long as they let him urinate on Rick's dead body.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #124</ref>\n\nNegan arrives at Hilltop's gates and offers to accept their surrender, asking to send out whoever is now in charge - and is stunned when Rick emerges to greet him. Negan asks Rick to surrender, to \"let things go back the way they were\", but Rick refuses. Rick goes on to say that they should pool their resources and people together, and in the current situation, the only ones who are \u201cwinning\u201d are the undead. Negan takes this all in, and Rick says that they can take their supplies, but they must give the survivors something in return; make supplies of their own to give or trade for others via a [[barter system]]. Negan realizes that he has only inflicted suffering upon the communities has \u201csaved\u201d, and apologizes. Rick then slashes Negan's throat with a knife.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #125</ref> Negan tackles Rick and begins beating him, Negan gets the better of him and breaks Rick's leg. Laughing, Negan passes out from blood loss. He wakes up inside one of the rooms in the Hilltop and sees Rick standing over him. Rick reveals that he's going to keep Negan alive so he can see the survivors\u2019 new civilization flourish without him. Rick also tells Negan that he will spend the rest of his life in jail.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #126</ref>\n\n==== A New Beginning ====\nTwo years after the war, Carl goes to the basement of an unknown house and talks to a figure in the shadows. He then says to Carl that he enjoys their talks and that it is good for him to keep track of the time and days passed. Carl says he is leaving, but before he leaves, the figure asks him if, after all this time, all the things they have shared and the talks they have had, Carl still wants to kill him. He turns around and faces the person behind bars, simply saying: \"Yes, Negan. You know I do.\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #127</ref> Negan asks how he was supposed to know that Carl wanted to kill him and tells him not to insult his intelligence. Negan says that he thought the two of them were friends to which Carl walks away, making Negan retreat into the corner of his cell.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #128</ref>\n\nNegan asks if Rick is taking Carl to the Hilltop, slightly shocking Rick. Negan says that he and Carl are friends and that Rick could not break that bond. Negan tells Rick that he is just getting things ready for him and that he will not be in his cell forever. Rick says that he knows Negan will die behind bars, to which Negan says that he won't and that deep down, Rick knows he should have killed Negan.\n\nMagna and her group later come down to see who was in the jail. When they walk down the stairs to where Negan is being held, Negan grabs the bars to his cell and asks if they are here to rescue him, saying that \"they're animals.\" This shocks Magna and her group.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #129</ref> Negan begs to be released and claims Rick is a monster who locked him up and tortured him for speaking out against him. However, Magna does not believe him, having seen actual victims of torture. Negan admits he was lying but had to give it a try. Magna and her companions leave the cell.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #130</ref>\n\n==== Life and Death ====\nSome time later, Negan is bathing and having his hair cut by Olivia outside his cell door. After finishing, Negan walks back to his cell at gunpoint from Andrea, who calls him a 'fucking monster,' much to Negan's amusement. Olivia then proceeds to lock the door, and they both leave Negan alone. However, it turns out Olivia didn't lock Negan's cell properly as the door swings open, which Negan notices.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #140</ref> However, Negan decides not to escape and remains in his cell with the door open until Rick comes downstairs, then taunts him about the numerous ways he could have destroyed Alexandria without anyone realizing, but claimed to stay as sign of good faith and an offering to amend their trust. As Rick locks up the cage and leaves, Negan taunts him again by stating the only reason he's alive is so Rick can prove to himself that he's still a good person, and that he wants everyone else to believe he is the only one who can fix the world.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #141</ref>\n\n==== No Turning Back ====\nAfter a tumultuous community meeting regarding Rick's proposed plan regarding the Whisperers, Rick goes to Negan's cell and asks for his help.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #148</ref> He fills him in on everything that has happened since they've come into conflict with this new group. Negan advises Rick to keep his group happy, even if that means lying to them, touting his expertise as leader of the Saviors, some of whom disliked him. Rick leaves, and Negan dons a grin.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #149</ref> When Negan hears the chants and cheers of Rick's name at a later town meeting, Negan smiles and says, \"atta boy.\"<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #150</ref>\n\n==== Call to Arms ====\nWhile in his cell, Negan is approached by Brandon Rose, a young Hilltop resident who bears a grudge against Rick, Carl, Sophia, and the Whisperers; Rick killed his father as an act of self-defense, Carl beat him up after he had attacked Sophia who beat him up, and [[Alpha (The Walking Dead)|Alpha]] beheaded his mother. He proposes to help Negan escape, and Negan says he will think about it. Later on, Rick and Michonne discover Negan's empty cell.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #152</ref> After his escape, Negan and Brandon enter Whisperer terrain. Here Brandon tells Negan that he wants Negan to pit Rick and the Whisperers against one another. In response, Negan stabs Brandon in the chest and enters the Whisperer zone alone.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #153</ref> Shortly afterward, Negan is ambushed by a group of Whisperers led by Beta and is taken, prisoner. They bring him to Alpha. Negan introduces himself and declares his love for Alpha.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #154</ref> Negan starts to live with the Whisperers, though without Beta's trust. During a night at camp, Negan sees two Whisperers trying to rape a woman. He stops them but is knocked down by Beta for interfering. Alpha explains that they allow for things like this to happen for women to prove their strength, causing Negan to become angry with her. Later that night, Negan and Alpha have a face to face conversation where Negan reveals how dead inside this world has made him and that he knows Alpha is just pretending to have no emotions, causing Alpha to breakdown. Alpha says that maybe Negan does belong with the Whisperers after all. Negan then slits Alpha's throat, followed by decapitating her, saying \"wait until Rick gets a look at you...\", revealing Negan had no feelings for Alpha all along.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #156</ref>\n\n==== The Whisperer War ====\nA week after disappearing, Negan turns up with Alpha's severed head and shows it to Rick and Andrea, who are very hesitant to believe and trust him. Negan reassures them that he only wants trust. He says Rick's way of thinking is inspiring and tries to convince them that his time in prison has rehabilitated him. He says he could've taken several chances and attacked Rick, but he didn't. He wants to fight with him, not against him. Rick finally agrees to let Negan out of the cell, but not in a community. He will live in an outpost, alone, with only enough food and weaponry to keep him surviving. He is not allowed these freedoms yet, though. He is going to be monitored for a long time and will fight on the front lines against the Whisperers. He will earn his freedom after the war, unless he slips up, in which case he will be immediately killed. They eventually win the war and he later admits he was wrong about his decisions and leaves to fend for himself there he is confronted by Maggie who wants revenge, but decides not to kill him after seeing him in a depressed state. (Issue 174)\n\nIn the Letter Hacks for Issue 182, Kirkman confirmed that Negan will not return to the series. When asked if Negan would receive another barbed-wire baseball bat, Kirkman answered, \"If we see Negan again - and we won't - I'd be really surprised if he had a bat with him. It feels like he put that behind him in his last appearance.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://comicbook.com/thewalkingdead/2018/08/01/the-walking-dead-negan-gone-leaving-comic-last-issue/ |title = Is Negan Really Leaving 'The Walking Dead' Forever?}}</ref>\n\n==== Rest in Peace ====\nIn the final issue, 20 years later, it is revealed that Negan is still alive. He avoids all contact with the other survivors, living on food parcels left by Carl and maintaining a state of mourning for his wife Lucille.<ref>''The Walking Dead'' #193</ref>\n\n=== Television series ===\n====Backstory====\nIn season 8, Negan vaguely states that he helped young people improve upon their weaknesses and molded them into stronger individuals. Negan later met a woman named Lucille and the pair fell in love and married. Over time however, Negan gradually became unfaithful towards her as he constantly lied and even engaged in an affair. In the onset of the outbreak, Negan was present alongside Lucille who had succumbed to an unknown illness and eventually perished. When she became a walker, Negan was unable to bring himself to put his wife down; this act of weakness would continue to haunt him and thus Negan strived to become a much stronger person.\n\nSometime after the outbreak, Negan established himself as the tyrannical [[dictator]] of a community of survivors called the \"Saviors.\" He wields a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire that he calls \"Lucille\" (after his wife). Negan quickly gathered a large following and established outposts in various locations around the Washington, D.C. area. Within the structure of the Saviors, Negan has a right-hand man named [[Simon (The Walking Dead)|Simon]] as well as several lieutenants, including Wade, Bud, Gavin, [[Arat (The Walking Dead)|Arat]] and [[Dwight (The Walking Dead)|Dwight]]. At some point, Negan and the Saviors encountered the Hilltop Colony and extorted its leader Gregory into giving them half their supplies on a regular basis; failure to do so would result in the Saviors killing members of their community. To set an example, his goons used a baseball bat to beat a 16-year-old resident named Rory to death, after which Gregory submitted to Negan's demands. Negan and his men also made contact with the community known as the Kingdom and made a similar agreement with their leader [[King Ezekiel]]. At some point, Dwight fled the Saviors with his wife Sherry, sister-in-law Tina, and a truck full of supplies that they refer to as Patty. Negan subsequently sent out a large group, led by Wade, to retrieve them and the stolen supplies.\n\n==== Season 6 ====\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 6)}}\nThe Saviors become the main antagonists during the second half of season 6 and with their mysterious leader known as Negan being mentioned several times prior to his appearance in the season finale. His name is first heard in \"[[No Way Out (The Walking Dead)|No Way Out]]\" when a group of bikers, led by a man named Bud, accost [[Daryl Dixon]], [[Abraham Ford]] and [[Sasha Williams (The Walking Dead)|Sasha Williams]] and attempt to steal their weapons, but Daryl kills them with a rocket launcher.\n\n[[File:Negan_Rick.jpg|thumb|Rick and his group kneel before Negan]]\nIn the season finale, \"[[Last Day on Earth (The Walking Dead)|Last Day on Earth]]\", while driving the ailing [[Maggie Greene]] to the Hilltop, Rick and his group run into multiple roadblocks set by the Saviors, which eventually causes Rick's group to travel by foot. While walking through the woods, the group is ambushed by a large contingent of the Saviors led by Negan's right-hand man Simon, who take Rick and his group's weapons and make them get on their knees.\n\nDwight also brings out Daryl, [[Glenn Rhee]], [[Michonne]], and [[Rosita Espinosa]], and makes them get on their knees, too. Negan then comes out of their RV and tells Rick that he must give him all of his possessions, and that Rick and everyone else at Alexandria work for Negan now; he \"owns\" them. Because Rick's group killed a lot of Saviors, Negan tells Rick's group they have to be punished, and he is going to beat one of them to death with \"Lucille\". Negan can't decide whom to kill, so he decides to choose the victim in a game of \"[[Eeny, meeny, miny, moe]]\", which he recites while pointing Lucille at each member of the group, before landing on an unseen individual, saying, \"you are it.\" Negan warns the group not to say anything or to move, and he begins to beat the unseen individual to death, as everyone else in the group screams.\n\n==== Season 7 ====\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 7)}}\nNegan's chosen victim is Abraham, whom he bludgeons to death with \"Lucille\". Enraged, Daryl rushes Negan and punches him in the face, only to be stopped by three Saviors directly. As a reprisal for Daryl's attack, Negan beats Glenn to death in front of Maggie, his wife. Negan then presents Rick with an ultimatum: pledge total loyalty, or the rest of the group will die. When Rick remains defiant, Negan threatens to kill Rick's son [[Carl Grimes|Carl]] and the rest of the group unless Rick cuts the boy's arm off. After some hesitation, Rick raises the axe; Negan stops him, knowing that he has broken the elder Grimes's will. Negan then allows the surviving members of the group to depart with the warning that the Saviors will return in a week to collect their supplies. As insurance against further retaliation, Negan takes Daryl with him. Negan is shown to rule the Sanctuary (the main Savior stronghold) through fear and rewarding his personal army of enforcers (who identify themselves as \"Negan\" in a show of loyalty). He keeps Daryl locked in a cell and hopes to break his will and mold him into one of his Saviors, but Daryl refuses to submit. Negan and his men arrive at Alexandria earlier than expected. He forces Rick to give him a tour while Rick holds Lucille and makes pithy comments along the way. Both Rick and [[Gabriel Stokes (The Walking Dead)|Father Gabriel]] lied to Negan that Maggie didn't make it. He later talks Carl out of shooting a Savior, and decides to take all of Alexandria's guns. When two guns go missing from the inventory, Negan threatens to kill Olivia ([[Ann Mahoney]]) if they aren't found. This is later resolved when Rick finds them as well as a hunting rifle which wasn't in the armory. This impresses Negan who states that \"this is something to build a relationship on\" before telling him to find them something interesting for next time. Before leaving, Negan takes back Lucille and tells Rick that \"I just slid my dick down your throat and you thanked me for it\". Negan meets his men returning with supplies from the Hilltop. They are attacked by Carl, who kills two of the Saviors and demands Negan come forward. Negan is nonchalant about the imminent danger to him, but develops a respect for Carl. He later sits Carl down and states that he wants to get to know him better, so he should uncover his eye. When Carl begrudgingly does so, Negan pokes fun at the boy's missing eye, but when he sees Carl become visibly upset, he shows genuine remorse and apologizes. He grows to genuinely like Carl, and later brings him to watch as he burns Mark, a Savior who has displeased him, with a hot iron to teach everyone a lesson about \u201cfollowing the rules\u201d. He then decides to bring Carl back to Alexandria, where they wait for Rick. Negan is approached in Alexandria by Spencer Monroe, who attempts to bond with him over whiskey and a game of pool. The two seem to hit it off, until Spencer tells Negan about how dangerous Rick is and that he should be in charge for both of their sakes. Negan states that while Rick hates him, he respects that Rick was brave enough to threaten him and swallow his pride to protect others. Disappointed that Spencer \"has no guts\" for going to him while Rick is gone, Negan [[Disembowelment|eviscerates]] Spencer with a knife while jokingly stating that \"he did have guts after all.\" This provokes [[Rosita Espinosa]] to draw a gun and shoot at Negan, though she misses and instead hits Lucille. Enraged, Negan threatens to have Rosita's face mutilated unless she tells him where she got the bullet. When she refuses, Negan tells his lieutenant [[Arat (The Walking Dead)|Arat]] to kill someone, causing Olivia to be gunned down. Rick, having just arrived, sees this and demands to know what happened. Negan calmly replies that he has tried to be reasonable as he returned Carl unharmed and killed Spencer for Rick. When [[Eugene Porter|Eugene]] confesses to making the bullet, Negan takes him prisoner and tells Rick that he is \"way in the hole\" for this incident no matter how many supplies they gather, before departing. After this, Rick finally knows he has to stop Negan, and hereby attempts to convince other communities to put an end to Negan's reign of terror by forming an alliance to defeat their common enemy. Negan reappears in \"[[Hostiles and Calamities]]\" where he greets Eugene entering the Sanctuary. After determining that Eugene is indeed highly intelligent, Negan allows him to get comfortable within the Sanctuary and even sends him two of his wives to provide him with company. When Negan discovers that Sherry is gone, he suspects her of freeing Daryl and has Dwight beaten and thrown in a cell. When he is convinced that Dwight wasn't involved and is still loyal, he sends him after Sherry, only to learn that she supposedly was killed by walkers. When he finds evidence of Dr. Carson aiding in Daryl's escape (secretly planted by Dwight), Negan throws him in the fire-pit before apologizing to Dwight for doubting him, and offering condolences for his loss. Negan visits a captive [[Sasha Williams (The Walking Dead)|Sasha Williams]] (who came to the Sanctuary to kill him) and discovers one of his Saviors, David, attempting to rape her. Negan states that rape is against their rules and that he doesn't tolerate such behavior. David apologizes, but Negan rams a knife through his throat, stating he does not \"accept his apology\". He then apologizes to Sasha and gets her a new T-shirt to replace the one David ripped before complimenting her on her brazen attack. After confirming Rick didn't sanction it, Negan states that she would make a welcome addition to the Saviors, despite his actions against her. He then leaves her with a knife and a choice: kill herself or kill David once he reanimates to show him she's willing to work with him. He later returns to find, to his delight, that she has killed David. He takes the knife back and informs her that she's on the right path before stating he knows Rick is conspiring against him as he has a spy in his midst. He's confident Sasha will be able to help him put an end to Rick's plans. Negan leads a convoy of Saviors to Alexandria with Simon, Dwight, Eugene and Sasha in tow with plans to bring Rick back under his control. He reveals the Scavengers (a group of survivors Rick paid to help them) are actually working for him as they hold Rick at gunpoint. Negan brings a coffin forward and reveals Sasha is inside, stating they can have her back alive and he'll let most of them live if they meet his demands, which include all their weapons, Daryl returned to him and for Rick to pick someone to be killed by Lucille. He opens the coffin to find Sasha has reanimated as a walker. After fending her off, the situation devolves into a gunfight. Negan manages to capture Rick and Carl, and prepares to kill Carl. Unfortunately for Negan, the Saviors are ambushed by Ezekiel and forces from the Kingdom as well as Maggie leading a group from Hilltop. Caught off guard by Rick's reinforcements and rapidly losing men, Negan orders a retreat. Once back at the Sanctuary, he questions Eugene as to how Sasha died in the coffin (suspecting foul play on his part) before declaring to the assembled Saviors that they are going to war.\n\n==== Season 8 ====\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 8)}}\nNegan appears in the season premiere, \"[[Mercy (The Walking Dead)|Mercy]],\" when Rick leads an army of assembled survivors outside the Sanctuary. More amused than worried, Negan refuses to march his people out to fight Rick just to prove \"that my dick is bigger than yours\". Rick offers Negan's lieutenants and the Saviors inside the chance to surrender, but states that Negan still has to die. Negan attempts to divide them by bringing out Gregory to order the Hilltoppers to retreat, but this tactic fails. They open fire, decimating the Sanctuary walls, but Negan and his people take cover. They are then surprised by a massive herd of walkers led by Daryl before the gates are blown open and the herd funnels inside. Negan becomes trapped in a trailer with Gabriel. \"[[The Big Scary U]]\" opens in the Sanctuary prior to Rick's attack with Negan meeting with his chief lieutenants discussing strategy. When Simon suggests they wipe out one of the communities entirely, Negan becomes incensed, stating that people are critical to what they're building. He instead wants to capture and publicly execute Rick, Maggie and Ezekiel to cow their people into submission. The episode then returns to Negan and Gabriel in the trailer, discussing their views on survival. When Gabriel tries to get Negan to confess his sins before death, he is evasive until he finally admits his greatest regret was his treatment of his first wife prior to the outbreak, stating she died of cancer and he couldn't put her down. The two manage to escape by \"gutting up\" and Negan is able reassert control of the spiraling situation in the Sanctuary. Negan returns to Alexandria to counterattack when he's met by Carl (who, unbeknownst to Negan, is dying from a walker bite) who attempts to dissuade him from attacking and even offers to be killed to spare the rest. He asks Negan if this is what he wanted or who he wanted to be, and his words seem to strike a chord. Negan attacks Alexandria anyway, however, and confronts Rick. After a brutal hand-to-hand fight, he throws Rick through a window. Rick retreats into the sewers with Michonne and the rest of the Alexandrians.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/walking-dead-recap-season-8-midseason-finale-1202635498/ |title='Walking Dead' Recap: Tide of War Turns in Midseason Finale (SPOILERS) |last=Otterson |first=Joe |date=December 10, 2017 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=December 10, 2017}}</ref> Negan meets with Simon to handle the matter of the Scavengers. Simon assumes he wants them exterminated, but Negan instead wants him to give them the standard warning and kill only one, as they are a resource just like the other communities. Rick later contacts him via walkie-talkie, and informs him that Carl is dead and that his last wish was for them to make peace, something Rick sees as impossible. Negan is saddened by the news, stating Carl was the future before asking Rick to surrender, to no avail. Negan begins preparing the Saviors for an attack on Hilltop to end the war. Since their stores of ammunition are low from breaking the prior walker siege, Negan comes up with a plan to use the walker virus to their advantage by coating their weapons in walker flesh, including Lucille. Negan leads a convoy of Saviors to the Hilltop when his car is rammed by Rick who pursues him into an abandoned building. Negan attempts to fight back, but falls through the floor and loses Lucille. Unarmed and being hunted in the dark, Negan attempts to make a deal, offering to forgive Rick's transgressions and reduce the Savior's cut of supplies in exchange for peace. Rick refuses, stating Negan cares for nothing save Lucille, which he then proceeds to light on fire. Negan furiously attacks Rick before the two are surrounded by walkers and flames, forcing Negan to reclaim Lucille and flee \u2014 only to be captured by [[Jadis (The Walking Dead)|Jadis]]. Jadis tortures Negan until he reveals that he had nothing to do with the massacre of her people; he manages to half-coerce, half-talk her down after some struggle into freeing him while she was getting ready to receive a helicopter at the junkyard. He makes his way back to the Savior compound to find that Simon has been ruling in his stead, and is responsible for the bloodshed at Jadis' compound. He regains control by challenging Simon to a fight and killing him with his bare hands, and making Dwight the instrument of his revenge against Rick by forcing him to lure Rick's group into a trap with false information. Michonne contacts Negan via walkie-talkie and reads him a letter Carl wrote him before he died urging a peaceful solution to the conflict; though moved by the message, Negan refuses, and swears he will kill Rick and every last one of his group. Rick's group shows up to challenge the Saviors. Negan orders his men to open fire, but discovers that Eugene has tampered with their weapons, rendering them helpless. Rick's group kills several of Negan's men, while Rick and Negan have a final battle that ends with Rick cutting Negan's throat open. However, Rick decides to save his enemy's life as he believes it is what Carl would want. Later, Negan recovers in the infirmary in Alexandria, where Rick and Michonne inform him that he will be imprisoned and rot in a cell for the rest of his life, and serve as a reminder that people are capable of change and as evidence that they will bring civilization.\n\n==== Season 9 ====\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 9)}}\nRick goes down a basement to talk to a locked up Negan. He mentions that it's been 35 days since Gregory's execution. He talks about how everything has changed after the war and how the communities are working together on fixing a bridge, which will be the link to their future. \u201cWe\u2019re making a new beginning,\u201d Rick says smiling with hope. After Rick finishes narrating his story, Negan, sporting a much larger beard than normal, questions when he will be able to have a look at the thriving communities but Rick tells him never and tells him he will die in his cell. Rick claims they are thriving without him to build a future and Negan taunts him about Carl but an angry Rick shuts him up and forbids him from mentioning Carl. Negan responds with a grin: \"You're not saving this world, Rick. You just get it ready for me,\" warning him that the peace between the communities won't last too long and that he will not be locked up forever. Negan is visited by Michonne after he refuses to eat. He says he\u2019ll only eat if she stays to talk to him. She agrees to stay for an hour. Negan tells Michonne he's not meant to be in the cell just as she's not meant to be doing random chores and looking after kids. Michonne shoots back that she's helping rebuild civilization. Negan admits he's happy his wife never got to see him like this, revealing that they wish they had a kid like Carl, but his wife got cancer and the world changed. Michonne says she sees Carl everywhere, and when Negan asks about her own kid, she angrily says Andre didn\u2019t make it. Negan says it's better this way because his wife wasn\u2019t made for the apocalypse. \u201cWe were built for more,\u201d he says. Michonne reacts in anger and storms off. A while later, Michonne returns to Negan's cell and acknowledges that they\u2019re similar but distinguishes that her worldview is a lot more positive than his. She finally gets him to eat, and as she leaves he asks her to see Lucille. Michonne tells him they don\u2019t have the bat anymore and leaves smiling. After she leaves, Negan starts to violently bang his head against the wall. Maggie arrives in Alexandria and after convincing Michonne, she is let into Negan's cell. He chuckles at her as Maggie demands he get on his knees. From the shadows, Negan taunts Maggie about killing Glenn and begs her to kill him. She opens the cell and slams him against the wall as he begs for death. Sobbing, he admits he wants to die so he can be reunited with his wife Lucille. She tells him to get back to his cell because he is  already \u201cworse than dead\u201d.\n\nSix years later, Negan remains a prisoner in Alexandria but has adopted a much less antagonistic attitude and struck up a friendship with Judith Grimes, Rick's daughter. Negan helps Judith with math problems and tells her a story from his childhood where he tried to take in stray dogs only for it to go badly for him when she asks for advice with dealing with Magna's group. Judith tells Negan that \"it doesn't matter if you're good or bad on the inside, the numbers don't care\" causing Negan to smile as she walks away. Negan is visited by Gabriel on a weekly basis who tries to help Negan become a better person. Negan taunts that he can hear a lot of things from his window and that Rosita has said some interesting stuff, but not about Gabriel. When Gabriel returns, Negan continues to taunt him until Gabriel reveals that Rosita is at the Hilltop, hurt and Gabriel can't go to her because he has to look after Negan. Negan gives an apparently sincere apology for his behavior upon hearing this, but Gabriel storms out. Later, while playing with his [[tennis ball]], Negan realizes that his cell door is unlocked. With a smirk, Negan departs his cell and escapes. Negan makes his escape from Alexandria following a brief encounter with Judith who lets Negan take her compass. Negan wanders through the changed world, losing his food following an encounter with two walkers and inadvertently returning to the clearing where he murdered Glenn and Abraham. Negan gets a new leather jacket from an abandoned clothing store, but is nearly killed by a pack of feral dogs in the process. Negan finally makes his return to the Sanctuary, only to find it completely abandoned and all of the Saviors gone. Negan tries to adapt to life alone, but can't. After putting down some reanimated Saviors, Negan abandons the Sanctuary and his old life for good and returns to Alexandria on a motorcycle recovered from a hidden room. Confronted by Judith near Alexandria, Negan admits that she was right that there is nothing left for him outside and he is willing to return to his cell rather than be alone. Negan then allows Judith to take him back to Alexandria. Negan is visited by Michonne after Judith disappears. Negan's cell now contains a bookshelf with several books and a small seat where he can comfortably read next to the bookshelf. Michonne demands to know what Negan talks to Judith about and he admits to telling her stories about Carl and Rick and the war, stories which Judith has never heard from anyone else before. Negan points out that Judith would be able to tell if he was lying so he is always honest with her, even when she asked about Glenn and Abraham. Negan urges Michonne to listen to and be honest with her daughter and helps Michonne realize that Judith went to try and help her friends. Negan is moved out of his cell during a dangerous [[blizzard]] as he will freeze to death otherwise. Negan attempts his usual antics to annoy everyone else, but is ignored as everyone now knows his tricks. Negan is the first to realize that something is wrong, leading to Eugene discovering that the chimney is clogged. Though everyone contemplates leaving Negan behind to die, they take him with them as they travel to Aaron's house. However, Judith hears Daryl's dog barking and runs off into the storm. Negan immediately risks his own life to chase after Judith and save her, finding her by following the barking dog, though he suffers a leg wound from flying debris in the process. Negan saves Judith and at her request, the dog too and carries her to shelter for the remainder of the storm. The next day, a recovering Negan is visited in the infirmary by a grateful Michonne. Negan calls Judith a spitfire and tells Michonne that she has been through enough. The two exchange friendly banter back and forth, Michonne having lost her hostility towards Negan after his heroic act of saving her daughter. Negan suggests that in a conflict, no one is able to admit that they are the evil ones in the situation indicating reflection and possibly remorse for his past actions.\n\n==== Season 10 ====\n{{See also|The Walking Dead (season 10)}}\nFollowing the storm, Negan is allowed some leeway and works in Alexandria as a gardner and maintenance man under guard until Father Gabriel pairs him up with Aaron to protect Alexandria from repeated walker attacks. After being attacked by Walkers while on patrol, Aaron is temporarily blinded and struggles his way to a cabin where he finds Negan who helps him. The two then return to Alexandria. While defending Lydia from an attack, Negan accidentally kills Margo in self-defense and faces possible execution. He inexplicably escapes, chased by a former Savior named Brandon who is a fan of his. After attempting to get a mother and son to safety at Hilltop, an enraged Negan kills Brandon following his murder of the two.\n\nApparently reverting back to his old ways and armed with a new Lucille created by Brandon, Negan joins the Whisperers and becomes the lover of Alpha. Negan aids in the attack on Hilltop, having the Whisperers block the roads so that the Hilltoppers can't easily escape, though Negan tries to convince Alpha to spare everyone and offer them a choice to join her. Following the attack, Negan encounters Aaron in the woods and fails to convince Aaron that he means him no harm. Negan captures Lydia and brings Alpha to her location, though he fails to talk Alpha out of killing her daughter. Negan is revealed to have stashed Lydia elsewhere and slits Alpha's throat, killing her. Negan then delivers Alpha's severed zombified head to Carol who comments that it took him long enough, revealing that Negan and Carol were working together to take down Alpha.\n\n===Others===\nNegan appears as a playable character in the fighting video game ''[[Tekken 7]]'', added as the sixth and final part of the second season pass on February 28, 2019, with his appearance based on his television counterpart.

I didn't realize how much I missed having a truly awful antagonist like [[The Governor (The Walking Dead)|The Governor]] in this series until now. The villain's voice is very distinct, allowing Kirkman to toy with a very different approach to dialogue. For a series where the characters sometimes ramble on too much without making a clear point, this character is very much appreciated.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/07/13/the-walking-dead-100-review |title=The Walking Dead #100 Review |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=July 13, 2012 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=July 13, 2012}}</ref> On their review for Issue #103, IGN felt Negan was \"quickly giving the Governor a run for his money in the villainy department\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/18/the-walking-dead-103-review |title=The Walking Dead #103 Review |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=October 17, 2012 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=October 17, 2012}}</ref> When Negan's community was explored as well as his relationship with [[Carl Grimes]], it was said that \"There's a palpable tension as we wonder what fate Negan has in mind for his young enemy.

Waynesboro is located in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], near many important historical markers of the Civil War and [[Shenandoah National Park]]. A portion of [[Interstate 64]] falls within the city limits of Waynesboro, and the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]], [[Skyline Drive]], and the [[Appalachian Trail]] are less than {{convert|5|mi}} away. [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] trackage runs through the east side of the city. The South River, a tributary of the Shenandoah River, flows through the city.\n\nA large former [[DuPont]] plant (now [[INVISTA|Invista]] owned by [[Koch Industries]]) and the associated Benger Laboratory where [[spandex]] was invented (under the brand name Lycra), as well as a large [[textile mill]] called Wayn-Tex (now owned by Mohawk Industries), were significant employers for residents through much of the 20th century. A General Electric site on the northeast side, which made relays and later computer printers, was also a substantial employer. Waynesboro was home to the corporate headquarters of [[nTelos]] (a regional wireless and telecommunications company serving Virginia, [[West Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Ohio]]) before that company's merger with [[Shentel]]. Tourism, industrial production, and retail remain vital to the Waynesboro economy. The [[Waynesboro Generals|Generals]] of the [[Valley Baseball League]] play there.\n\nWaynesboro is a principal city of the [[Staunton-Waynesboro micropolitan area|Staunton-Waynesboro Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which includes all of Augusta County and the independent cities of Staunton and Waynesboro.\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Waynesboroin1891.jpg|thumb|Map of Waynesboro as it appeared in 1891]]\nLocated in the British [[Colony of Virginia]], even after the [[American Revolution]] and independence and statehood for the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]], the areas west of the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] and [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] were known as the frontier. Travel by wagon over the mountains was considered to be nearly impossible except where nature afforded some gap between them. Until after the Civil War, [[Jarmans Gap]], only some six miles northeast of Waynesboro, was the major crossing of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] in that area, making Waynesboro a convenient location for a stop for many who sought to travel west.\n\nIn the mid 18th century, the present day Waynesboro area was commonly referred to as Teasville (or Teesville). Shortly after U.S. Army General [[Anthony Wayne]]'s significant victory at [[Fallen Timbers|Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794 during the [[Northwest Indian War]], the area began to be called Waynesborough. Many settlers to the area at the time originated from [[Pennsylvania]]. General Wayne's well-known popularity with Pennsylvanians is suspected to have helped contribute to this naming.\n\nAs early as 1798, the current downtown area was plotted and sold. On January 8, 1801, the town Waynesborough was officially recognized by the state of Virginia, and was incorporated by 1834.\n\nSome of the remaining buildings from this period of its history include the [[Plumb House (Waynesboro, Virginia)|Plumb House]] (now a museum open for tours seasonally) and the Coiner-Quesenbury House, built in 1806, believed to be the first brick house built in the town, which is still standing on Main Street.\n\nPopulation growth to the town was slow at first. In 1810, the town had a population of 250, and by 1860 that number had grown to 457. The town maintained a steady stream of visitors primarily due to its position on Three Notch'd Road, which connected [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]] to the west with [[Charlottesville]] and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] to the east. This road crossed the Blue Ridge Mountains through [[Jarman's Gap]]. Additionally, a railroad tunnel was constructed through [[Rockfish Gap]] a short time before the Civil War began. This was to establish Rockfish Gap as the major crossing through the mountains between Waynesboro and Charlottesville.\n\nOn March 2, 1865, Waynesboro was the site of the last battle of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] for the Confederate Lt. General [[Jubal A. Early]]. The [[Battle of Waynesboro, Virginia|Battle of Waynesboro]] lasted twenty minutes, and was a final blow for the Confederate Army in the [[Shenandoah Valley]]. Sometime after, General Early relinquished the town and the valley to General [[Philip Sheridan]]. Many of the buildings from this period still show damages from the battle. During and after the war, casualties from the nearby Valley Campaign and other battles were buried in Ridgeview Cemetery where the Waynesboro Confederate Monument lists and commemorates their names and states.\n\nAfter the war, the Waynesboro area became the junction of two railroad lines. The [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (running east to west) and the [[Shenandoah Valley Railroad (N&W)|Shenandoah Valley Railroad]], which soon became the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] (running north to south). The lines met near Waynesboro, giving the town the nickname of the \"Iron Cross\".\n\nIn 1890, land to the east of Waynesboro, mostly on the east side of South River, was plotted and sold. Within that year, the [[Basic City, Virginia|Town of Basic City]] was incorporated. A rivalry soon developed between the two towns with each attempting to outdo the other in regards to their development. An important difference between the two was that, unlike Basic City, Waynesboro had implemented restrictive laws banning the sale of alcohol.\n\nWaynesboro and Basic City voted for and approved of consolidation into a single town to be called Waynesboro-Basic in 1923.\n\nSince 1924, Waynesboro has made numerous territorial acquisitions from areas of [[Augusta County]] through annexation and officially became an [[independent city (United States)|independent city]] in 1948. In 2005, Waynesboro established a new charter, repealing one in place since 1948.\n\n[[Swannanoa (mansion)|Swannanoa]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1969.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nWaynesboro is located at {{coord|38|4|11|N|78|53|40|W|type:city}} (38.069874, -78.894517).

Waynesboro is located in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], near many important historical markers of the Civil War and [[Shenandoah National Park]]. A portion of [[Interstate 64]] falls within the city limits of Waynesboro, and the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]], [[Skyline Drive]], and the [[Appalachian Trail]] are less than {{convert|5|mi}} away. [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] trackage runs through the east side of the city. The South River, a tributary of the Shenandoah River, flows through the city.\n\nA large former [[DuPont]] plant (now [[INVISTA|Invista]] owned by [[Koch Industries]]) and the associated Benger Laboratory where [[spandex]] was invented (under the brand name Lycra), as well as a large [[textile mill]] called Wayn-Tex (now owned by Mohawk Industries), were significant employers for residents through much of the 20th century. A General Electric site on the northeast side, which made relays and later computer printers, was also a substantial employer. Waynesboro was home to the corporate headquarters of [[nTelos]] (a regional wireless and telecommunications company serving Virginia, [[West Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Ohio]]) before that company's merger with [[Shentel]]. Tourism, industrial production, and retail remain vital to the Waynesboro economy. The [[Waynesboro Generals|Generals]] of the [[Valley Baseball League]] play there.\n\nWaynesboro is a principal city of the [[Staunton-Waynesboro micropolitan area|Staunton-Waynesboro Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which includes all of Augusta County and the independent cities of Staunton and Waynesboro.\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Waynesboroin1891.jpg|thumb|Map of Waynesboro as it appeared in 1891]]\nLocated in the British [[Colony of Virginia]], even after the [[American Revolution]] and independence and statehood for the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]], the areas west of the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] and [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] were known as the frontier. Travel by wagon over the mountains was considered to be nearly impossible except where nature afforded some gap between them. Until after the Civil War, [[Jarmans Gap]], only some six miles northeast of Waynesboro, was the major crossing of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] in that area, making Waynesboro a convenient location for a stop for many who sought to travel west.\n\nIn the mid 18th century, the present day Waynesboro area was commonly referred to as Teasville (or Teesville). Shortly after U.S. Army General [[Anthony Wayne]]'s significant victory at [[Fallen Timbers|Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794 during the [[Northwest Indian War]], the area began to be called Waynesborough. Many settlers to the area at the time originated from [[Pennsylvania]]. General Wayne's well-known popularity with Pennsylvanians is suspected to have helped contribute to this naming.\n\nAs early as 1798, the current downtown area was plotted and sold. On January 8, 1801, the town Waynesborough was officially recognized by the state of Virginia, and was incorporated by 1834.\n\nSome of the remaining buildings from this period of its history include the [[Plumb House (Waynesboro, Virginia)|Plumb House]] (now a museum open for tours seasonally) and the Coiner-Quesenbury House, built in 1806, believed to be the first brick house built in the town, which is still standing on Main Street.\n\nPopulation growth to the town was slow at first. In 1810, the town had a population of 250, and by 1860 that number had grown to 457. The town maintained a steady stream of visitors primarily due to its position on Three Notch'd Road, which connected [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]] to the west with [[Charlottesville]] and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] to the east. This road crossed the Blue Ridge Mountains through [[Jarman's Gap]]. Additionally, a railroad tunnel was constructed through [[Rockfish Gap]] a short time before the Civil War began. This was to establish Rockfish Gap as the major crossing through the mountains between Waynesboro and Charlottesville.\n\nOn March 2, 1865, Waynesboro was the site of the last battle of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] for the Confederate Lt. General [[Jubal A. Early]]. The [[Battle of Waynesboro, Virginia|Battle of Waynesboro]] lasted twenty minutes, and was a final blow for the Confederate Army in the [[Shenandoah Valley]]. Sometime after, General Early relinquished the town and the valley to General [[Philip Sheridan]]. Many of the buildings from this period still show damages from the battle. During and after the war, casualties from the nearby Valley Campaign and other battles were buried in Ridgeview Cemetery where the Waynesboro Confederate Monument lists and commemorates their names and states.\n\nAfter the war, the Waynesboro area became the junction of two railroad lines. The [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (running east to west) and the [[Shenandoah Valley Railroad (N&W)|Shenandoah Valley Railroad]], which soon became the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] (running north to south). The lines met near Waynesboro, giving the town the nickname of the \"Iron Cross\".\n\nIn 1890, land to the east of Waynesboro, mostly on the east side of South River, was plotted and sold. Within that year, the [[Basic City, Virginia|Town of Basic City]] was incorporated. A rivalry soon developed between the two towns with each attempting to outdo the other in regards to their development. An important difference between the two was that, unlike Basic City, Waynesboro had implemented restrictive laws banning the sale of alcohol.\n\nWaynesboro and Basic City voted for and approved of consolidation into a single town to be called Waynesboro-Basic in 1923.\n\nSince 1924, Waynesboro has made numerous territorial acquisitions from areas of [[Augusta County]] through annexation and officially became an [[independent city (United States)|independent city]] in 1948. In 2005, Waynesboro established a new charter, repealing one in place since 1948.\n\n[[Swannanoa (mansion)|Swannanoa]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1969.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nWaynesboro is located at {{coord|38|4|11|N|78|53|40|W|type:city}} (38.069874, -78.894517).
