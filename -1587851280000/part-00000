They scout the notion that their terrible \"black tiger\" is a mere melanic variation, like the black leopard of the Old World and the wild black rabbit. They regard it as wholly distinct, and affirm that it is larger and much more dangerous than the spotted jaguar; that they recognise it by its cry; that it belongs to the terra firma rather than to the water-side; finally, that black pairs with black, and that the cubs are invariably black. Nevertheless, naturalists have been obliged to make it specifically one with ''Felis onca'' [''Panthera onca''], the familiar spotted jaguar, since, when stripped of its hide, it is found to be anatomically as much like that beast as the black is like the spotted leopard.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hudson |first1=W.

He had a taste for landscape gardening, and between 1797 and 1810, spent large sums in laying the grounds. In the house, he displayed a collection of antiquities and pictures, partly formed by himself. He had a large series of drawings and prints bought during a tour on the continent in 1800 and 1801, at Moscow, Venice, and Paris; a large collection of drawings of castles and manor-houses by [[John Chessell Buckler]], and portfolios of his own drawings.

The uninterrupted settlement of Monterrey was founded by [[Diego de Montemayor]] in 1596. In the years after the [[Mexican War of Independence]], Monterrey became an important business center. With the establishment of ''[[Fundidora Park|Fundidora Monterrey]]'', the city has experienced great industrial growth.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of Monterrey|Timeline of Monterrey, Mexico|History of Nuevo Le\u00f3n}}\n\n===Prehispanic history===\nBefore the European foundation of the city, there was no established nation-state, and the population consisted of some indigenous [[Nomad|semi-nomadic]] groups. [[Carved stone]] and [[cave painting]] in surrounding mountains and caves have allowed historians to identify four major groups in present-day Monterrey: ''Azalapas'', ''Huachichiles'', ''[[Coahuiltecan people|Coahuiltecos]]'' and ''Borrados''.<ref name=\"elocal-hist\">{{cite web| url = http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/nuevoleon/hist.htm | title = Historia \u2013 Nuevo Le\u00f3n | publisher=e-local.gob.mx | accessdate=July 2, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110816015515/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/nuevoleon/hist.htm | archivedate = August 16, 2011| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Foundation===\n\nIn the 16th century, the valley in which Monterrey sits was known as the [[Extremadura Valley]], an area largely unexplored by the Spanish colonizers. The first expeditions and colonization attempts were led by conquistador [[Alberto del Canto]], who named the city '''Santa Lucia''', but they were unsuccessful because the Spanish were attacked by the natives and fled. The Spanish expeditionary [[Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva]] negotiated with [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II]] of Spain to establish a territory in northern [[New Spain]] that would be called [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], the \"[[New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]]\". In 1580 he arrived in the newly granted lands but it was not until 1582 that he established a settlement called '''San Luis Rey de Francia''' (named for [[Louis IX|Saint Louis IX of France]]) within present-day Monterrey. The New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n extended westward from the port of [[Tampico]] to the limits of [[Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain|Nueva Vizcaya]] (\"New Biscay\", now State of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]), and around 1,000&nbsp;kilometers northward. For eight years Nuevo Le\u00f3n was abandoned and uninhabited, until a third expedition of 13 families led by conquistador [[Diego de Montemayor]] founded ''Ciudad Metropolitana de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Monterrey'' (\"Metropolitan City of Our Lady of Monterrey\") on September 20, 1596, next to a water spring called ''Ojos de Agua de Santa Lucia'', where the Museum of Mexican History and [[Santa Luc\u00eda riverwalk]] are now. The new city's name was chosen to honor the wife of [[Gaspar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 5th Count of Monterrey]], ninth Viceroy of New Spain.\n\nMonterrey's Coat of Arms shows an Indian throwing an arrow to the sun in front of Cerro de la Silla mountain. This represents a native ceremony performed at sunrise.\n\n[[File:Mariano Escobedo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Mariano Escobedo|Gen. Mariano Escobedo]]]]\nDuring the years of Spanish rule, Monterrey remained a small city, and its population varied from a few hundred to only dozens. The city facilitated trade between [[San Antonio]] (now in Texas), [[Tampico]] and from [[Saltillo]] to the center of the country. Tampico's port brought many products from Europe, while Saltillo concentrated the Northern Territories' trade with the capital, [[Mexico City]]. San Antonio was the key trade point with the northern foreign colonies (British and French).\n\n===After Mexican Independence (19th century)===\nIn the 19th century, after the [[Mexican Independence War]], Monterrey rose as a key economic center for the newly formed nation, especially due to its balanced ties between Europe (with its connections to Tampico), the United States (with its connections to San Antonio), and the capital (through Saltillo). In 1824, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\" became the State of [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], and Monterrey was selected as its capital. But the political instability that followed the first 50 years of the new country allowed two American invasions and an internal secession war, during which the governor of the state annexed [[Coahuila]] and [[Tamaulipas]] states, designating Monterrey as the capital of the [[Republic of the Sierra Madre]] as it did before in 1840 for the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]].\n\nIn 1846, the earliest large-scale engagement of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] took place in the city, known as the [[Battle of Monterrey]]. Mexican forces were forced to surrender but only after successfully repelling U.S. forces' first few advances on the city. The battle inflicted high casualties on both sides, much of them resulting from hand-to-hand combat within the walls of the city center.\n\nMany of the generals in the [[French intervention in Mexico|Mexican War against France]] were natives of the city, including [[Mariano Escobedo]], [[Juan Zuazua]] (b. Lampazos de Naranjo, NL) and [[Jer\u00f3nimo Trevi\u00f1o]].\n\n===Contemporary history===\n[[File:A Bit Of Old Monterey - Pg-365.jpg|thumb|Page from book: Mexico, California and Arizona; being a new and revised edition of Old Mexico and her lost provinces.

It was during this period that [[Jos\u00e9 Eleuterio Gonz\u00e1lez]] founded the [[University Hospital]], now one of northeast Mexico's best public hospitals, affiliated with the School of Medicine of the [[Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Nuevo Le\u00f3n|Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\u00f3n (UANL)]].

A steel-producing company that accelerated the already fast industrialization of the city was founded in 1900 and became one of the world's biggest. In 1986, Monterrey hosted several games of the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nIn 1988, [[Hurricane Gilbert]] caused great damage to the city; the [[Santa Catarina River (Mexico)|Santa Catarina River]] overflowed, causing about 100 deaths and economic damage.\n\nThe city has hosted international events such as the 2002 [[United Nations|United Nations Conference on Financing for Development]] with the participation of more than 50 heads of state and government, as well as other ministers and senior delegates from over 150 countries. The conference resulted in the adoption of the [[Monterrey Consensus]], which has become a reference point for international development and cooperation. In 2004, the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] [[Monterrey Special Summit of the Americas|Special Summit of the Americas]] was attended by almost all the presidents of the Americas.\n\nIn 2007, Monterrey held the [[2007 Universal Forum of Cultures|Universal Forum of Cultures]], with four million visitors. In 2008, Monterrey held the FINA World Junior Championships.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nIn 2010, Monterrey was hit by another damaging storm, [[Hurricane Alex (2010)|Hurricane Alex]]. Alex was considered worse than [[Hurricane Gilbert]], with record-breaking rain bringing floods and causing severe economic damage. Damage estimates totaled US$1.885 billion and $16.9 billion MXN. Reconstruction and urban renewal ensued.

The political environment is one of civility and in the last decade political parties have been alternating office. The current [[Municipal president of Monterrey|mayor of Monterrey]] is Adrian De la Garza Santos.\n\nThe City Council of Monterrey (''Cabildo de Monterrey'') is an organ integrated by the mayor, the ''Regidores'' and the ''S\u00edndicos''. The mayor is the executor of the determinations of the City Council and the person directly in charge of public municipal administration. The ''Regidores'' represent the community and collectively define city policies.

But since 2008 it has experienced violence related to turf battles between warring drug cartels. The year 2011 was the most violent in history.

The uninterrupted settlement of Monterrey was founded by [[Diego de Montemayor]] in 1596. In the years after the [[Mexican War of Independence]], Monterrey became an important business center. With the establishment of ''[[Fundidora Park|Fundidora Monterrey]]'', the city has experienced great industrial growth.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of Monterrey|Timeline of Monterrey, Mexico|History of Nuevo Le\u00f3n}}\n\n===Prehispanic history===\nBefore the European foundation of the city, there was no established nation-state, and the population consisted of some indigenous [[Nomad|semi-nomadic]] groups. [[Carved stone]] and [[cave painting]] in surrounding mountains and caves have allowed historians to identify four major groups in present-day Monterrey: ''Azalapas'', ''Huachichiles'', ''[[Coahuiltecan people|Coahuiltecos]]'' and ''Borrados''.<ref name=\"elocal-hist\">{{cite web| url = http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/nuevoleon/hist.htm | title = Historia \u2013 Nuevo Le\u00f3n | publisher=e-local.gob.mx | accessdate=July 2, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110816015515/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/nuevoleon/hist.htm | archivedate = August 16, 2011| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Foundation===\n\nIn the 16th century, the valley in which Monterrey sits was known as the [[Extremadura Valley]], an area largely unexplored by the Spanish colonizers. The first expeditions and colonization attempts were led by conquistador [[Alberto del Canto]], who named the city '''Santa Lucia''', but they were unsuccessful because the Spanish were attacked by the natives and fled. The Spanish expeditionary [[Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva]] negotiated with [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II]] of Spain to establish a territory in northern [[New Spain]] that would be called [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], the \"[[New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]]\". In 1580 he arrived in the newly granted lands but it was not until 1582 that he established a settlement called '''San Luis Rey de Francia''' (named for [[Louis IX|Saint Louis IX of France]]) within present-day Monterrey. The New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n extended westward from the port of [[Tampico]] to the limits of [[Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain|Nueva Vizcaya]] (\"New Biscay\", now State of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]), and around 1,000&nbsp;kilometers northward. For eight years Nuevo Le\u00f3n was abandoned and uninhabited, until a third expedition of 13 families led by conquistador [[Diego de Montemayor]] founded ''Ciudad Metropolitana de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Monterrey'' (\"Metropolitan City of Our Lady of Monterrey\") on September 20, 1596, next to a water spring called ''Ojos de Agua de Santa Lucia'', where the Museum of Mexican History and [[Santa Luc\u00eda riverwalk]] are now. The new city's name was chosen to honor the wife of [[Gaspar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 5th Count of Monterrey]], ninth Viceroy of New Spain.\n\nMonterrey's Coat of Arms shows an Indian throwing an arrow to the sun in front of Cerro de la Silla mountain. This represents a native ceremony performed at sunrise.\n\n[[File:Mariano Escobedo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Mariano Escobedo|Gen. Mariano Escobedo]]]]\nDuring the years of Spanish rule, Monterrey remained a small city, and its population varied from a few hundred to only dozens. The city facilitated trade between [[San Antonio]] (now in Texas), [[Tampico]] and from [[Saltillo]] to the center of the country. Tampico's port brought many products from Europe, while Saltillo concentrated the Northern Territories' trade with the capital, [[Mexico City]]. San Antonio was the key trade point with the northern foreign colonies (British and French).\n\n===After Mexican Independence (19th century)===\nIn the 19th century, after the [[Mexican Independence War]], Monterrey rose as a key economic center for the newly formed nation, especially due to its balanced ties between Europe (with its connections to Tampico), the United States (with its connections to San Antonio), and the capital (through Saltillo). In 1824, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\" became the State of [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], and Monterrey was selected as its capital. But the political instability that followed the first 50 years of the new country allowed two American invasions and an internal secession war, during which the governor of the state annexed [[Coahuila]] and [[Tamaulipas]] states, designating Monterrey as the capital of the [[Republic of the Sierra Madre]] as it did before in 1840 for the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]].\n\nIn 1846, the earliest large-scale engagement of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] took place in the city, known as the [[Battle of Monterrey]]. Mexican forces were forced to surrender but only after successfully repelling U.S. forces' first few advances on the city. The battle inflicted high casualties on both sides, much of them resulting from hand-to-hand combat within the walls of the city center.\n\nMany of the generals in the [[French intervention in Mexico|Mexican War against France]] were natives of the city, including [[Mariano Escobedo]], [[Juan Zuazua]] (b. Lampazos de Naranjo, NL) and [[Jer\u00f3nimo Trevi\u00f1o]].\n\n===Contemporary history===\n[[File:A Bit Of Old Monterey - Pg-365.jpg|thumb|Page from book: Mexico, California and Arizona; being a new and revised edition of Old Mexico and her lost provinces.

It was during this period that [[Jos\u00e9 Eleuterio Gonz\u00e1lez]] founded the [[University Hospital]], now one of northeast Mexico's best public hospitals, affiliated with the School of Medicine of the [[Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Nuevo Le\u00f3n|Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\u00f3n (UANL)]].

A steel-producing company that accelerated the already fast industrialization of the city was founded in 1900 and became one of the world's biggest. In 1986, Monterrey hosted several games of the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nIn 1988, [[Hurricane Gilbert]] caused great damage to the city; the [[Santa Catarina River (Mexico)|Santa Catarina River]] overflowed, causing about 100 deaths and economic damage.\n\nThe city has hosted international events such as the 2002 [[United Nations|United Nations Conference on Financing for Development]] with the participation of more than 50 heads of state and government, as well as other ministers and senior delegates from over 150 countries. The conference resulted in the adoption of the [[Monterrey Consensus]], which has become a reference point for international development and cooperation. In 2004, the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] [[Monterrey Special Summit of the Americas|Special Summit of the Americas]] was attended by almost all the presidents of the Americas.\n\nIn 2007, Monterrey held the [[2007 Universal Forum of Cultures|Universal Forum of Cultures]], with four million visitors.

Alex was considered worse than [[Hurricane Gilbert]], with record-breaking rain bringing floods and causing severe economic damage. Damage estimates totaled US$1.885 billion and $16.9 billion MXN. Reconstruction and urban renewal ensued.

But since 2008 it has experienced violence related to turf battles between warring drug cartels. The year 2011 was the most violent in history. Drug dealers are a major concern, although military offensives and police captures of important drug-cartel chiefs have weakened cartels trying to settle in the city. The city is safe to travel by day and night, but common-sense precautions should be taken in certain districts at night.<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7956782.stm\n|title= Monterrey attack suspect arrested\n|publisher=news.bbc.co.uk\n|accessdate=July 1, 2009\n| date=March 21, 2009\n| first=Stephen\n| last=Gibbs\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090324133710/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7956782.stm |archivedate = March 24, 2009| url-status=live}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/World/Story/STIStory_353190.html\n|title=Drug cartel hitman arrested\n|work=Straits Times |location=Singapore\n|accessdate=July 1, 2009\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090327014722/http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/World/Story/STIStory_353190.html |archivedate = March 27, 2009| url-status=dead}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://community2.myfoxaustin.com/_UPDATE-18-Horrible-News-From-Monterrey-Mexico-and-Beyond-Marijuana-Legalization-Solution/BLOG/211413/82263.html\n|title=UPDATE 18: Horrible News From Monterrey, Mexico and Beyond...

The battle was fought against the background of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the collapse of government in Haiti in the aftermath of the [[Haitian Revolution]] eight years earlier. After the French had been expelled from Haiti in 1804, the newly independent nation was first ruled by [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], who was murdered in 1806 and replaced by two of his advisors, [[Henri Christophe]] and [[Alexandre P\u00e9tion]]. These rulers divided the country between them and in the confused political situation that followed a number of minor fiefdoms appeared, including one led by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Maximilien Borgella in the south-west of the island called [[Sud (department)|Sud]]. The small [[Haitian Navy]] defected to Borgella, who crewed the vessels with a collection of sailors from various countries, led by a notorious privateer named Gaspard.\n\nStationed off Haiti was the British frigate [[HMS Southampton (1757)|HMS ''Southampton'']] under Captain [[James Lucas Yeo|Sir James Lucas Yeo]], tasked with observing the political situation but with orders not to interfere in the intermittent conflict between Christophe and P\u00e9tion. Yeo's orders did not include Borgella's ships and Yeo reasoned that the Haitian flagship, the large frigate [[French frigate F\u00e9licit\u00e9 (1785)|''Heureuse R\u00e9union'']] (recently renamed from ''Am\u00e9thyste'' and often reported under its former name), presented a serious threat to international trade in the region.\n\nSailing to intercept the Haitian ship, Yeo discovered her in the Gulf of [[L\u00e9ogane]] and ordered Gaspard to surrender. The Haitian refused, and the frigates exchanged shots at 06:30. The superior seamanship and discipline on ''Southampton'' prevented Gaspard from boarding the British ship with his greater numbers and within half an hour ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' was dismasted and battered. At 07:45 the Haitian ship surrendered, Yeo depositing the crew ashore and bringing ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' to [[Port Royal]], [[Jamaica]]. At Jamaica, his actions were approved by his superiors and ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'', renamed ''Am\u00e9thyste'', was returned to Henri Christophe.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Caribbean Sea]] was initially an important theatre of naval conflict, as ships operating from the various French, British, Spanish and Dutch colonies preyed on enemy trade. During 1809 and 1810 however, the [[Royal Navy]] launched a series of co-ordinated [[amphibious operation]]s that eliminated the French and Dutch colonies and brought the conflict in the Caribbean to an end.<ref name=\"RG79\"/> With the threat of attacks on British trade in the region significantly reduced, the Royal Navy correspondingly reduced their presence in the Caribbean and the remaining British ships were distributed to observe trouble spots in the region, which in 1812 included the independent nation of [[Haiti]].<ref name=\"RG80\">Gardiner, p. 80</ref>\n\nHaiti had won its independence from France in 1804, the first Caribbean nation to do so. The Haitians had fought a lengthy and bloody war against the French known as the [[Haitian Revolution]], in which armies of former slaves led by [[Toussaint Louverture]] and then [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] succeeded in driving the French into their fortified ports and then systematically eliminating their enclaves.<ref name=\"DC191\">Chandler, p. 191</ref> With the start of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803, French reinforcements for the garrison on Haiti were delayed and intercepted by the British Royal Navy, who blockaded the island and took the surrenders of the last garrisons in 1804, removing them and their dependents to prevent a massacre.<ref name=\"WJ4:209\">James, Vol. 4, p. 209</ref> Dessalines rapidly established himself as monarch of Haiti, but his reign was cut short in 1806 when his closest advisors, [[Henri Christophe]] and [[Alexandre P\u00e9tion]] organised his assassination. Assuming control of Haiti, Christophe laid claim to the northern part of the country and P\u00e9tion the south, the two sides waging a constant low-level civil war during the next decade.<ref name=\"RW244\">Woodman, p. 244</ref> Many minor rulers sprang up during this period, especially in the south, where P\u00e9tion gave parcels of land for his followers to establish their own private fiefdoms. One such warlord was J\u00e9r\u00f4me Maximilien Borgella, who took over command of a small state in the region of [[L\u00e9ogane]] following the death of its ruler, [[Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]].<ref name=\"WJ6:76\"/>\n\nIn early 1809, the French sent a number of reinforcement convoys to their blockaded colonies in the hope of strengthening the garrisons before the British invasions began. Many ships, including four frigates, were lost in these missions and few reached their destinations successfully. Among these failed attempts was [[Troude's expedition to the Caribbean]], which arrived in April 1809 at the [[\u00celes des Saintes]]. Finding that [[Guadeloupe]] was the only surviving colony, [[Amable Troude]] intended to anchor at [[Basse-Terre]] and unload his supplies, but was blockaded in the \u00celes des Saintes by a British squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Alexander Cochrane|Sir Alexander Cochrane]].<ref name=\"RG79\">Gardiner, p. 79</ref> Attempting to break out on 14 April, Troude led his main squadron northwest towards [[Puerto Rico]] while two ''[[en fl\u00fbte]]'' frigates slipped out northeast to Basse-Terre, arriving safely. Troude's squadron was defeated on 17 April, but the frigates [[French frigate F\u00e9licit\u00e9 (1785)|''F\u00e9licit\u00e9'']] and [[HMS Furieuse (1809)|''Furieuse'']] remained at Basse-Terre until 14 June, when they attempted to break out and return to France, laden with trade goods. The British blockade squadron were soon in pursuit and on 18 June the frigate [[HMS Latona (1781)|HMS ''Latona'']] captured ''F\u00e9licit\u00e9'' without a fight.<ref name=\"WJ5:165\">James, Vol. 5, p. 165</ref> ''Furieuse'' was captured a month later in the North Atlantic. ''F\u00e9licit\u00e9'' was 24&nbsp;years old and was therefore considered too antiquated for commissioning in the Royal Navy; instead she was sold to Henri Christophe to form the nucleus of the new Haitian Navy under the name ''Am\u00e9thyste''.<ref name=\"WLC500\">Clowes, p. 500</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nAt some point in January 1812 the Haitian Navy defected, for reasons unknown, from Christophe to Borgella.<ref name=\"WJ6:76\"/> Borgella placed a noted French [[privateer]] named Gaspard in command of the squadron, which included the frigate ''Am\u00e9thyste''  (renamed ''Heureuse R\u00e9union''), a [[corvette]] and a [[brig]]. Gaspard then armed ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' with 44 [[cannon]], took on board a motley crew of over 600 men, a mixture of Haitian, French, American and other nationalities, and began cruising in the [[Gulf of Gon\u00e2ve]].<ref name=\"WLC501\">Clowes, p. 501</ref> The British observer off Haiti at this time was Captain [[James Lucas Yeo|Sir James Lucas Yeo]] in the frigate [[HMS Southampton (1757)|HMS ''Southampton'']], under strict orders to respect the flags of Christophe and P\u00e9tion, but not those of the minor warlords that had emerged along the coast. On 2 January word reached him at [[Port au Prince]] of Gaspard's movements and he immediately sailed to intercept him, concerned that if Gaspard was allowed to take his powerful squadron out of Haitian waters he might begin attacks on merchant ships regardless of nationality.<ref name=\"WJ6:76\">James, Vol. 6, p. 76</ref>\n\nAt 06:00 on 3 February, Yeo discovered Gaspard's ships at anchor to the south of the island of Guanaboa and demanded that Gaspard come aboard ''Southampton'' with his [[Ship commissioning|commissioning papers]], to establish under whose authority Gaspard commanded the warship.<ref name=\"WLC500\"/> The Haitian captain refused, but sent aboard his first lieutenant with a note purported to be from Borgella, signed \"Borgellat, general in chief of the south of Hayti\". As Borgella had no authority to commission warships, Yeo ordered the lieutenant to tell Gaspard that his ships must submit to ''Southampton'' and be taken to [[Port Royal]], [[Jamaica]], where their ownership could be established by the naval authorities. He would have five minutes to consider the proposal.<ref name=\"WJ6:77\">James, Vol. 6, p. 77</ref> A British officer accompanied the Haitian lieutenant back to ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' for Gaspard's answer, and was informed within three minutes that Gaspard had no intention of submitting to the British ship. He was also told that should Yeo be intent on fighting the Haitian ship then he should indicate it with a bow gun fired ahead of ''Heureuse R\u00e9union''. Returning to ''Southampton'' at 06:30, the lieutenant relayed the message and the bow gun was fired, followed a few seconds later by a full [[broadside]] from ''Southampton''.<ref name=\"WJ6:77\"/>\n\n''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' responded to the cannonade in kind. During the engagement, Gaspard repeatedly attempted to board ''Southampton'', where his vastly superior numbers could overwhelm the British crew. Yeo was aware of his enemy's intentions, and repeatedly manoeuvered out of the way, his more disciplined and agile vessel easily able to remain out of contact with the overloaded Haitian ship.<ref name=\"WJ6:77\"/> Within half an hour the highly efficient gunners on ''Southampton'' had knocked down the main and mizen masts on ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'', leaving her unable to manoeuvre and vulnerable to repeated pounding at close range. Despite the severe damage the Haitian ship suffered, her crew continued to fire cannon at irregular intervals for 45 minutes, each shot prompting a broadside from the British ship.<ref name=\"RW245\">Woodman, p. 245</ref> The two smaller Haitian vessels did not support the frigate, fleeing towards Maraguana near [[Petit Go\u00e2ve]] to shelter under the batteries there. By 07:45, after over an hour of heavy fire, Yeo hailed ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' to discover whether or not she had surrendered. Somebody aboard replied that they had, although Gaspard had been seriously wounded and was no longer in command, so the identity of the person who gave the surrender is not known.<ref name=\"WLC501\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAs ''Southampton'' stopped firing, the remaining masts of the Haitian ship fell overboard. Casualties on ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' were immense: of the 600\u2013700 crew, 105 were dead and 120 wounded, the latter including Gaspard, who subsequently died of his injuries. Yeo's loss was one man killed and ten wounded, from a crew of 212.<ref name=\"WJ6:78\">James, Vol. 6, p. 78</ref> Seeking to rid himself of so many prisoners, Yeo landed most of them at Maraguana before sailing to Port au Prince, where the rest were landed and temporary [[jury masts]] were fitted to ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' for the journey to Jamaica. The British retained 20 prisoners for trial at Port Royal.<ref name=\"WJ6:78\"/> ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' was repaired at Jamaica and subsequently restored to Christophe under the name ''Am\u00e9thyste'', returning to Haitian service. Yeo's action in attacking the Haitian ship, although not officially sanctioned by his commanding officer beforehand, was commended.<ref name=\"WLC501\"/>\n\nThe Caribbean rose in importance again later in 1812, with the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]] between Britain and the [[United States]]. American privateers threatened British trade routes and Royal Navy ships were sent out to defeat them, including ''Southampton'', which was wrecked in the [[Bahamas]] during an anti-privateer patrol in November 1812.<ref name=\"TG345\">Grocott, p. 345</ref> There were no further significant actions in the region during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the presence of Royal Navy patrols deterred any large scale French or American operations in the Caribbean.<ref name=\"RW245\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Chandler\n | first = David\n | authorlink = David G.

One such warlord was J\u00e9r\u00f4me Maximilien Borgella, who took over command of a small state in the region of [[L\u00e9ogane]] following the death of its ruler, [[Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]].<ref name=\"WJ6:76\"/>\n\nIn early 1809, the French sent a number of reinforcement convoys to their blockaded colonies in the hope of strengthening the garrisons before the British invasions began. Many ships, including four frigates, were lost in these missions and few reached their destinations successfully. Among these failed attempts was [[Troude's expedition to the Caribbean]], which arrived in April 1809 at the [[\u00celes des Saintes]]. Finding that [[Guadeloupe]] was the only surviving colony, [[Amable Troude]] intended to anchor at [[Basse-Terre]] and unload his supplies, but was blockaded in the \u00celes des Saintes by a British squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Alexander Cochrane|Sir Alexander Cochrane]].<ref name=\"RG79\">Gardiner, p. 79</ref> Attempting to break out on 14 April, Troude led his main squadron northwest towards [[Puerto Rico]] while two ''[[en fl\u00fbte]]'' frigates slipped out northeast to Basse-Terre, arriving safely. Troude's squadron was defeated on 17 April, but the frigates [[French frigate F\u00e9licit\u00e9 (1785)|''F\u00e9licit\u00e9'']] and [[HMS Furieuse (1809)|''Furieuse'']] remained at Basse-Terre until 14 June, when they attempted to break out and return to France, laden with trade goods. The British blockade squadron were soon in pursuit and on 18 June the frigate [[HMS Latona (1781)|HMS ''Latona'']] captured ''F\u00e9licit\u00e9'' without a fight.<ref name=\"WJ5:165\">James, Vol. 5, p. 165</ref> ''Furieuse'' was captured a month later in the North Atlantic. ''F\u00e9licit\u00e9'' was 24&nbsp;years old and was therefore considered too antiquated for commissioning in the Royal Navy; instead she was sold to Henri Christophe to form the nucleus of the new Haitian Navy under the name ''Am\u00e9thyste''.<ref name=\"WLC500\">Clowes, p. 500</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nAt some point in January 1812 the Haitian Navy defected, for reasons unknown, from Christophe to Borgella.<ref name=\"WJ6:76\"/> Borgella placed a noted French [[privateer]] named Gaspard in command of the squadron, which included the frigate ''Am\u00e9thyste''  (renamed ''Heureuse R\u00e9union''), a [[corvette]] and a [[brig]]. Gaspard then armed ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' with 44 [[cannon]], took on board a motley crew of over 600 men, a mixture of Haitian, French, American and other nationalities, and began cruising in the [[Gulf of Gon\u00e2ve]].<ref name=\"WLC501\">Clowes, p. 501</ref> The British observer off Haiti at this time was Captain [[James Lucas Yeo|Sir James Lucas Yeo]] in the frigate [[HMS Southampton (1757)|HMS ''Southampton'']], under strict orders to respect the flags of Christophe and P\u00e9tion, but not those of the minor warlords that had emerged along the coast. On 2 January word reached him at [[Port au Prince]] of Gaspard's movements and he immediately sailed to intercept him, concerned that if Gaspard was allowed to take his powerful squadron out of Haitian waters he might begin attacks on merchant ships regardless of nationality.<ref name=\"WJ6:76\">James, Vol. 6, p. 76</ref>\n\nAt 06:00 on 3 February, Yeo discovered Gaspard's ships at anchor to the south of the island of Guanaboa and demanded that Gaspard come aboard ''Southampton'' with his [[Ship commissioning|commissioning papers]], to establish under whose authority Gaspard commanded the warship.<ref name=\"WLC500\"/> The Haitian captain refused, but sent aboard his first lieutenant with a note purported to be from Borgella, signed \"Borgellat, general in chief of the south of Hayti\". As Borgella had no authority to commission warships, Yeo ordered the lieutenant to tell Gaspard that his ships must submit to ''Southampton'' and be taken to [[Port Royal]], [[Jamaica]], where their ownership could be established by the naval authorities. He would have five minutes to consider the proposal.<ref name=\"WJ6:77\">James, Vol. 6, p. 77</ref> A British officer accompanied the Haitian lieutenant back to ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' for Gaspard's answer, and was informed within three minutes that Gaspard had no intention of submitting to the British ship. He was also told that should Yeo be intent on fighting the Haitian ship then he should indicate it with a bow gun fired ahead of ''Heureuse R\u00e9union''. Returning to ''Southampton'' at 06:30, the lieutenant relayed the message and the bow gun was fired, followed a few seconds later by a full [[broadside]] from ''Southampton''.<ref name=\"WJ6:77\"/>\n\n''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' responded to the cannonade in kind. During the engagement, Gaspard repeatedly attempted to board ''Southampton'', where his vastly superior numbers could overwhelm the British crew. Yeo was aware of his enemy's intentions, and repeatedly manoeuvered out of the way, his more disciplined and agile vessel easily able to remain out of contact with the overloaded Haitian ship.<ref name=\"WJ6:77\"/> Within half an hour the highly efficient gunners on ''Southampton'' had knocked down the main and mizen masts on ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'', leaving her unable to manoeuvre and vulnerable to repeated pounding at close range. Despite the severe damage the Haitian ship suffered, her crew continued to fire cannon at irregular intervals for 45 minutes, each shot prompting a broadside from the British ship.<ref name=\"RW245\">Woodman, p. 245</ref> The two smaller Haitian vessels did not support the frigate, fleeing towards Maraguana near [[Petit Go\u00e2ve]] to shelter under the batteries there. By 07:45, after over an hour of heavy fire, Yeo hailed ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' to discover whether or not she had surrendered. Somebody aboard replied that they had, although Gaspard had been seriously wounded and was no longer in command, so the identity of the person who gave the surrender is not known.<ref name=\"WLC501\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAs ''Southampton'' stopped firing, the remaining masts of the Haitian ship fell overboard. Casualties on ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' were immense: of the 600\u2013700 crew, 105 were dead and 120 wounded, the latter including Gaspard, who subsequently died of his injuries. Yeo's loss was one man killed and ten wounded, from a crew of 212.<ref name=\"WJ6:78\">James, Vol. 6, p. 78</ref> Seeking to rid himself of so many prisoners, Yeo landed most of them at Maraguana before sailing to Port au Prince, where the rest were landed and temporary [[jury masts]] were fitted to ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' for the journey to Jamaica. The British retained 20 prisoners for trial at Port Royal.<ref name=\"WJ6:78\"/> ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' was repaired at Jamaica and subsequently restored to Christophe under the name ''Am\u00e9thyste'', returning to Haitian service. Yeo's action in attacking the Haitian ship, although not officially sanctioned by his commanding officer beforehand, was commended.<ref name=\"WLC501\"/>\n\nThe Caribbean rose in importance again later in 1812, with the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]] between Britain and the [[United States]]. American privateers threatened British trade routes and Royal Navy ships were sent out to defeat them, including ''Southampton'', which was wrecked in the [[Bahamas]] during an anti-privateer patrol in November 1812.<ref name=\"TG345\">Grocott, p. 345</ref> There were no further significant actions in the region during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the presence of Royal Navy patrols deterred any large scale French or American operations in the Caribbean.<ref name=\"RW245\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Chandler\n | first = David\n | authorlink = David G.
