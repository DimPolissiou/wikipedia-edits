Gray]], 1869</small>\n}}\n\nThe '''yellow-faced honeyeater''' (''Caligavis chrysops'') is a small to medium-sized bird in the [[honeyeater]] [[family (biology)|family]], Meliphagidae. It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was first [[species description|described]], and placed in the genus ''[[Typical warbler|Sylvia]]'', by ornithologist, [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]], in his 1801 work, ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae''.<ref name=latham01>{{cite book | last=Latham | first=John | author-link=John Latham (ornithologist) | year=1801 | title=Supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae | place=London | publisher=Leigh & Sotheby | language=Latin | page=liv | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33261428 }}</ref><ref name=Latham>{{cite journal | last = Schodde| first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Schodde |author2=Dickinson, Edward C. |author3=Steinheimer, Frank D. |author4=Bock, Walter J.  | title = The date of Latham's ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici'': 1801 or 1802? | journal = South Australian Ornithologist | volume = 35| issue = 8 | pages = 231\u2013235 | year = 2010| url=http://www.birdssa.asn.au/images/saopdfs/Volume35/2010V35P231.pdf }}</ref> French ornithologist, [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]], described it as ''Melithreptus gilvicapillus'' in 1817, and English zoologist, [[George Robert Gray]], as ''Ptilotis trivirgata'' in 1869.<ref name=\"AFD\">{{cite web|url=https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/f27e5973-dc69-40d0-af23-ae1c49d6e0b3|title=Subspecies ''Caligavis chrysops chrysops'' (Latham, 1801)|author=Australian Biological Resources Study|date=13 October 2014|work=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, Australian Government|accessdate=7 January 2017|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory}}</ref> The specific name ''chrysops'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''chrysos'' meaning 'gold' and ''prosopo'' meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.<ref name=fraser13>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Jeannie|last2=Fraser|first2=Ian|title=Australian Bird Names: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W1TCqHVWQp0C&pg=PT199#v=onepage&q=Yellow-faced%20honeyeater%20&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-643-10471-6|page=199}}</ref>\n\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera ''[[Meliphaga]]'' and then ''[[Lichenostomus]]'' until 2011.<ref name=\"AFD\"/> Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus, using dense [[taxon]] and [[nucleotide]] sampling, confirmed previous findings that ''Lichenostomus'' is not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]].<ref name =Gardener>{{cite journal| last = Gardner | first = J.L.  | last2 = Trueman |first2=J.W.H. |last3=Ebert|first3=D. |last4=Joseph |first4=L. |last5=Magrath|first5=R.D. | title = Phylogeny and evolution of the ''Meliphagoidea'', the largest radiation of Australian songbirds  | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 55 | issue =  3| pages = 1087\u20131102 | year = 2010 | issn = 1055-7903  | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005\n| pmid = 20152917}}</ref> Five species have previously been described as comprising the ''Caligavis'' subgroup, but studies, using the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the [[black-throated honeyeater]] (''C. subfrenatus'') and the [[obscure honeyeater]] (''C. obscurus'') of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus ''[[Caligavis]]''.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}} The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like ''chick-up, chick-up'', from which its common name of quitchup is derived.{{sfn|Officer|1965|p=50}} Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long ''preet'' with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be [[contact call]]s, are animated two-note calls variously described as ''terric, terric'', ''cr-rook, cr-rook'' or ''put-put, put-put''.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Yellow-faced Honeyeater callistemon.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Honeyeater balancing on a bottlebrush flower|The yellow-faced honeyeater can be seen feeding on garden shrubs.]]\n\n===Habitat===\nAcross its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater is found in a variety of habitats\u2014in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in [[Riparian zone|riparian]] woodlands. It most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum (''[[Corymbia maculata]]'') with [[ironbark]]s and [[stringybark]]s, such as narrow-leaved ironbark (''[[Eucalyptus crebra]]'') and silver-leaved ironbark ([[Eucalyptus melanophloia|''E. melanophloia'']]), with a light, shrubby [[understorey]], and less often in dry, open forests and [[woodland]]s dominated by ''[[Angophora]]'', ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Banksia]]'', ''[[Casuarina]]'' or ''[[Callitris]]'', or in high-altitude, tall, open forests of alpine ash (''[[Eucalyptus delegatensis]]'') and woodlands dominated by snow gum (''[[Eucalyptus pauciflora|E. pauciflora]]'') or white box (''[[Eucalyptus albens|E. albens]]''). It has been recorded in coastal [[heath]] when banksias are blooming, and among flowering [[mangrove]]s. It occupies areas infested with weeds, such as Scotch broom (''[[Cytisus scoparius]]'') and [[Blackberry|blackberries]], and in developed areas including orchards, parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers. It can be found in forests regenerating after [[Bushfires in Australia|fire]] or [[logging]], though it is more common in mature forests.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=725}} Where it is found in woodland, it is usually woodland near forest or with an [[understory]] of sclerophyll plants.<ref name=\"Ford and Paton 76\">{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Hugh A.|last2=Paton|first2=David C.|title=Resource partitioning and competition in honeyeaters of the genus ''Meliphaga''|journal=Australian Journal of Ecology|date=1976|volume=1|issue=4|pages=281\u2013287|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.1976.tb01118.x}}</ref>\n\n===Range===\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater ranges across a broad arc generally along the coastline from near [[Cooktown]] in [[Far North Queensland]], and between a line from [[Charters Towers]] south to [[Albury]] and the coast, and then west to the [[Fleurieu Peninsula]] and the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia.

It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was first [[species description|described]], and placed in the genus ''[[Typical warbler|Sylvia]]'', by ornithologist, [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]], in his 1801 work, ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae''.<ref name=latham01>{{cite book | last=Latham | first=John | author-link=John Latham (ornithologist) | year=1801 | title=Supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae | place=London | publisher=Leigh & Sotheby | language=Latin | page=liv | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33261428 }}</ref><ref name=Latham>{{cite journal | last = Schodde| first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Schodde |author2=Dickinson, Edward C. |author3=Steinheimer, Frank D. |author4=Bock, Walter J.  | title = The date of Latham's ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici'': 1801 or 1802? | journal = South Australian Ornithologist | volume = 35| issue = 8 | pages = 231\u2013235 | year = 2010| url=http://www.birdssa.asn.au/images/saopdfs/Volume35/2010V35P231.pdf }}</ref> French ornithologist, [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]], described it as ''Melithreptus gilvicapillus'' in 1817, and English zoologist, [[George Robert Gray]], as ''Ptilotis trivirgata'' in 1869.<ref name=\"AFD\">{{cite web|url=https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/f27e5973-dc69-40d0-af23-ae1c49d6e0b3|title=Subspecies ''Caligavis chrysops chrysops'' (Latham, 1801)|author=Australian Biological Resources Study|date=13 October 2014|work=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, Australian Government|accessdate=7 January 2017|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory}}</ref> The specific name ''chrysops'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''chrysos'' meaning 'gold' and ''prosopo'' meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.<ref name=fraser13>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Jeannie|last2=Fraser|first2=Ian|title=Australian Bird Names: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W1TCqHVWQp0C&pg=PT199#v=onepage&q=Yellow-faced%20honeyeater%20&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-643-10471-6|page=199}}</ref>\n\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera ''[[Meliphaga]]'' and then ''[[Lichenostomus]]'' until 2011.<ref name=\"AFD\"/> Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus, using dense [[taxon]] and [[nucleotide]] sampling, confirmed previous findings that ''Lichenostomus'' is not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]].<ref name =Gardener>{{cite journal| last = Gardner | first = J.L.  | last2 = Trueman |first2=J.W.H. |last3=Ebert|first3=D. |last4=Joseph |first4=L. |last5=Magrath|first5=R.D. | title = Phylogeny and evolution of the ''Meliphagoidea'', the largest radiation of Australian songbirds  | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 55 | issue =  3| pages = 1087\u20131102 | year = 2010 | issn = 1055-7903  | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005\n| pmid = 20152917}}</ref> Five species have previously been described as comprising the ''Caligavis'' subgroup, but studies, using the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the [[black-throated honeyeater]] (''C. subfrenatus'') and the [[obscure honeyeater]] (''C. obscurus'') of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus ''[[Caligavis]]''.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}} The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like ''chick-up, chick-up'', from which its common name of quitchup is derived.{{sfn|Officer|1965|p=50}} Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long ''preet'' with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be [[contact call]]s, are animated two-note calls variously described as ''terric, terric'', ''cr-rook, cr-rook'' or ''put-put, put-put''.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Yellow-faced Honeyeater callistemon.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Honeyeater balancing on a bottlebrush flower|The yellow-faced honeyeater can be seen feeding on garden shrubs.]]\n\n===Habitat===\nAcross its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater is found in a variety of habitats\u2014in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in [[Riparian zone|riparian]] woodlands. It most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum (''[[Corymbia maculata]]'') with [[ironbark]]s and [[stringybark]]s, such as narrow-leaved ironbark (''[[Eucalyptus crebra]]'') and silver-leaved ironbark ([[Eucalyptus melanophloia|''E. melanophloia'']]), with a light, shrubby [[understorey]], and less often in dry, open forests and [[woodland]]s dominated by ''[[Angophora]]'', ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Banksia]]'', ''[[Casuarina]]'' or ''[[Callitris]]'', or in high-altitude, tall, open forests of alpine ash (''[[Eucalyptus delegatensis]]'') and woodlands dominated by snow gum (''[[Eucalyptus pauciflora|E. pauciflora]]'') or white box (''[[Eucalyptus albens|E. albens]]''). It has been recorded in coastal [[heath]] when banksias are blooming, and among flowering [[mangrove]]s. It occupies areas infested with weeds, such as Scotch broom (''[[Cytisus scoparius]]'') and [[Blackberry|blackberries]], and in developed areas including orchards, parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers.

A glassmaker by trade (in that position he provided all windows for the [[Royal Palace (Amsterdam)|new city hall on the Dam]]), he also played an important role as stage-manager and director of the theatre.  He organized, on the mayors' orders, processions and splendid decorated [[Float (parade)|floats]], which sometimes drew disapproval, criticism, and derision.\n\n==Life==\nOn 20 February 1639, at the old City Hall of Amsterdam, he married Grietje Gerrets (1616 - 1651), already pregnant by him.  They had two children:  Jan (who only lived a few days) and Maria (who in 1664 laid the first stone for the new theatre).  Jan Vos was of good family and lived in the [[Kalverstraat]] at no. 202. He prided himself on knowing no other languages than Dutch.  With his ''Aran and Titus'' of 1641 his name, previously all but unknown, was made.  [[Casper van Baerle]] admired the work, despite, or because of, the fact that it featured a prince served as a pudding,  a baked [[moors|Moor]] and some apparitions.  (The subject is the same as in Shakespeare's [[Titus Andronicus]]).\n\nIn his ''Klucht van Oene'' (\"The Farce of Oene\", 1642), a number of dishonest practices by Amsterdam merchants and industrialists are criticized - bakers of bread short-selling their customers, tailors  filching pieces of cloth owned by their patrons, glassmakers cheating with glass quantities, dyers of silk tampering with their material. In addition, house-agents, pawnbrokers, cashiers, notaries public and secretaries, landlords, millers, doctors, barbers, pharmacists and booksellers enter the stage.\n\nJan Vos was a sought-after table companion of such leading families as those of [[De Graeff]], [[Bicker (family)|Bicker]], [[Joan Huydecoper van Maarsseveen (1599-1661)|Huydecoper]] and [[Jan Six]]. He wrote [[occasional poems]] for them <!--not occasionally poems-->, and this has led to his often being characterized as \"a family poet\".  In 1651 he was among the compilers of the ''Verscheyde Nederduytse gedichten'' (\"Sundry Poems in Dutch\") collection of poems, an attempt to bring together painters and poets of different schools and religions.  In 1657, he was an honoured guest at the marriage of Jan J. Hinlopen and Leonora Huydecoper.\n\nJan Vos was head of the [[Schouwburg of Van Campen|Theatre of Van Campen]] for nineteen years, together with [[Tobias van Domselaer]] and [[Johannes Serwouters]].  Vos was part of the [[Muiderkring]], a group of literary people meeting at a castle where the a member of the Bicker family had been appointed [[Landdrost|\"drost\"]] (keeper of the castle).  He directed plays by [[Joost van den Vondel|Vondel]].\n\nJan Vos had a good eye for the public taste, and was repeatedly entrusted by the city authorities with designing and overseeing pageants and spectacles.  In 1654, Vos organized ten performances celebrating the [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|Treaty of Westminster]].<!--For [[Christina of Sweden]]'s visit to the Netherlands in 1656, he organised eight shows or  \"paintings\" (scenes) for her to see.-->  In 1659, Amalia van Solms, the Regent's wife, and her daughter visited Amsterdam, seeing twenty performances especially designed for the occasions.  [[Nicolas Tulp]], however, vehemently opposed the appearance of pagan gods and goddesses during the visitors' festive arrival.

Vos''' (baptised 4 March 1612 in [[Amsterdam]]<ref>[https://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/archieven/archiefbank/indexen/doopregisters/zoek/index.nl.html Gemeente Amsterdam Stadsarchief]</ref> &ndash; buried 12 July 1667 in Amsterdam) was a Dutch playwright and poet.  A glassmaker by trade (in that position he provided all windows for the [[Royal Palace (Amsterdam)|new city hall on the Dam]]), he also played an important role as stage-manager and director of the theatre.  He organized, on the mayors' orders, processions and splendid decorated [[Float (parade)|floats]], which sometimes drew disapproval, criticism, and derision.\n\n==Life==\nOn 20 February 1639, at the old City Hall of Amsterdam, he married Grietje Gerrets (1616 - 1651), already pregnant by him.  They had two children:  Jan (who only lived a few days) and Maria (who in 1664 laid the first stone for the new theatre).  Jan Vos was of good family and lived in the [[Kalverstraat]] at no. 202. He prided himself on knowing no other languages than Dutch.  With his ''Aran and Titus'' of 1641 his name, previously all but unknown, was made.  [[Casper van Baerle]] admired the work, despite, or because of, the fact that it featured a prince served as a pudding,  a baked [[moors|Moor]] and some apparitions.  (The subject is the same as in Shakespeare's [[Titus Andronicus]]).\n\nIn his ''Klucht van Oene'' (\"The Farce of Oene\", 1642), a number of dishonest practices by Amsterdam merchants and industrialists are criticized - bakers of bread short-selling their customers, tailors  filching pieces of cloth owned by their patrons, glassmakers cheating with glass quantities, dyers of silk tampering with their material. In addition, house-agents, pawnbrokers, cashiers, notaries public and secretaries, landlords, millers, doctors, barbers, pharmacists and booksellers enter the stage.\n\nJan Vos was a sought-after table companion of such leading families as those of [[De Graeff]], [[Bicker (family)|Bicker]], [[Joan Huydecoper van Maarsseveen (1599-1661)|Huydecoper]] and [[Jan Six]]. He wrote [[occasional poems]] for them <!--not occasionally poems-->, and this has led to his often being characterized as \"a family poet\".  In 1651 he was among the compilers of the ''Verscheyde Nederduytse gedichten'' (\"Sundry Poems in Dutch\") collection of poems, an attempt to bring together painters and poets of different schools and religions.  In 1657, he was an honoured guest at the marriage of Jan J. Hinlopen and Leonora Huydecoper.\n\nJan Vos was head of the [[Schouwburg of Van Campen|Theatre of Van Campen]] for nineteen years, together with [[Tobias van Domselaer]] and [[Johannes Serwouters]].  Vos was part of the [[Muiderkring]], a group of literary people meeting at a castle where the a member of the Bicker family had been appointed [[Landdrost|\"drost\"]] (keeper of the castle).  He directed plays by [[Joost van den Vondel|Vondel]].\n\nJan Vos had a good eye for the public taste, and was repeatedly entrusted by the city authorities with designing and overseeing pageants and spectacles.  In 1654, Vos organized ten performances celebrating the [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|Treaty of Westminster]].<!--For [[Christina of Sweden]]'s visit to the Netherlands in 1656, he organised eight shows or  \"paintings\" (scenes) for her to see.-->  In 1659, Amalia van Solms, the Regent's wife, and her daughter visited Amsterdam, seeing twenty performances especially designed for the occasions.  [[Nicolas Tulp]], however, vehemently opposed the appearance of pagan gods and goddesses during the visitors' festive arrival.  At the visit of [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Maria Henrietta Stuart]], the widow of [[William II, Prince of Orange|William II]], it turned out that one of the floats represented the beheading of [[Charles I of England]], Mary's late father.

He is considered the most prominent Dutch poet and playwright of the 17th century.

The most visible was the annual performance, on New Year's Day from 1637 to 1968, of ''[[Gijsbrecht van Aemstel (play)|Gijsbrecht van Aemstel]]''.\n\nVondel remained productive until a very old age. Several of his most notable plays like ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Lucifer (play)|nl|3=Lucifer (toneelstuk)}}'' and ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Adam in Exile|nl|3=Adam in ballingschap}}'' were written after 1650, when he was already 65, and his final play ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Noah (play)|nl|3=Noah (toneelstuk)}}'', written at the age of eighty, is considered one of his finest.\n\n==Biography==\nVondel was born on 17 November 1587 on the Gro\u00dfe Witschgasse in [[Cologne]], [[Holy Roman Empire]]. His parents were [[Mennonite]]s of [[Antwerp]]ian descent. In 1595, probably because of their religious conviction, they fled to [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], and from there, they eventually moved to [[Amsterdam]] in the newly formed [[Dutch Republic]].\n\nAt the age of 23, Vondel married Mayken de Wolff. Together they had four children, of whom two died in infancy. After the death of his father in 1608, Vondel managed the family hosiery shop on the Warmoesstraat in Amsterdam. In the meantime, he began to learn Latin and became acquainted with famous poets such as [[Roemer Visscher]].\n\nAround the year 1641, he converted to [[Catholicism]]. This was a great shock to most of his fellow countrymen because the main faith and de facto state religion in the Republic was [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Protestantism]]. It is still unclear why he became a Catholic although his love for a Catholic woman may have played a role in this (Mayken de Wolff had died in 1635).\n\nDuring his life, he became one of the main advocates for [[religious tolerance]]. After the arrest, [[Trial of Oldenbarnevelt, Grotius and Hogerbeets|trial]] and the immediate beheading of the most important civilian leader of the States of the Netherlands, [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]] (1619), at the command of his enemy, Prince [[Maurits of Nassau]], and the [[Synod of Dort]] (1618\u20131619), the Calvinists became the decisive religious power in the Republic. Public practice of Catholicism, [[Anabaptism]] and [[Arminianism]] was from then on officially forbidden but worship in [[clandestine church|clandestine houses of prayer]] was tolerated. Vondel wrote many satires criticising the Calvinists and extolling Oldenbarnevelt. That, together with his new faith, made him an unpopular figure in Calvinist circles. He died a bitter man though he was honoured by many fellow poets, on 5 February 1679.\n\n[[George Borrow]] called him \"by far the greatest [man] that Holland ever produced.\"<ref>[[George Borrow]], ''[[Wild Wales]], p. 105.</ref>\n\n==Plays==\nHis plays included:\n*''The Passover or the Redemption of Israel from Egypt'' (1610),\n*''Jerusalem Destroyed''  (1620),\n*''Palamedes'' (1625),\n*''Hecuba'' (1626),\n*''Joseph'' (1635),\n*''[[Gijsbrecht van Aemstel (play)|Gijsbrecht van Aemstel]]'' (1637),\n*''The Maidens'' (1639),\n*''The Brothers'' (1640),\n*''Joseph in Dothan'' (1640),\n*''Joseph in Egypt'' (1640),\n*''Peter and Paul'' (1641),\n*''Mary Stuart or Tortured Majesty'' (1646),\n*''Lion Fallers'' (1647),\n*''Solomon'' (1648),\n*''Lucifer'' (1654),\n*''Salmoneus'' (1657),\n*''Jephthah'' (1659),\n*''David in Exile'' (1660),\n*''David Restored'' (1660),\n*''Samson or Holy Revenge'' (1660),\n*''The Sigh of Adonis'' (1661),\n*''The Batavian Brothers or Oppressed Freedom'' (1663),\n*''Phaeton'' (1663),\n*''Adam in Exile from Eden'' (1664),\n*''The Destruction of the Sinai Army'' (1667),\n*''Noah and the Fall of the First World'' (1667).\n\n=== ''Lucifer'' (1654) and Milton's ''Paradise Lost'' ===\n[[Image:Vondel.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Joost van den Vondel by [[Cornelis de Visscher]], 1657]]\nIt has been suggested<ref>Cf. [[George Edmundson]], ''[https://archive.org/details/miltonandvondelc00edmuuoft Milton and Vondel: a curiosity of literature]'', London: 1885.</ref> that [[John Milton]] drew inspiration from ''Lucifer'' (1654) and ''Adam in Ballingschap'' (1664) for his ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667). In some respects the two works have similarities: the focus on [[Lucifer]], the description of the battle in heaven between Lucifer's forces and Michael's, and the anti-climax as Adam and Eve leave Paradise.\n\nOne example of similarity is the following:\n\n\"Here may we reign secure, and in my choice To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell.\n\nBetter to reign in hell than serve in heaven.\"\n\n:Milton's ''Paradise Lost''\n\n\"Is \u2019t noodlot, dat ick vall\u2019, van eere en staet berooft,<BR>\nLaet vallen, als ick vall\u2019, met deze kroone op \u2019t hooft,<BR>\nDien scepter in de vuist, dien eersleip van vertrouden,<BR>\nEn zoo veel duizenden als onze zyde houden.<BR>\nDat valle streckt tot eer, en onverwelckbren lof:<BR>\nEn liever d\u2019 eerste Vorst in eenigh laeger hof,<BR>\nDan in \u2019t gezalight licht de tweede, of noch een minder<BR>\nZoo troost ick my de kans, en vrees nu leet noch hinder.\"\n\nTranslation:<BR>\n''Is it fate that I will fall, robbed of honour and dignity,''<BR>\n''Then let me fall, if I were to fall, with this crown upon my head''<BR>\n''This sceptre in my fist, this company of loyals,''<BR>\n''And as many as are loyal to our side.''<BR>\n''This fall would honour one, and give unwilting praise:''<BR>\n''And rather [would I be] foremost king in any lower court,''<BR>\n''Than rank second in most holy light, or even less''<BR>\n''Thus I justify my revolt, and will not fear pain nor hindrance.''\n\n:Vondel's ''Lucifer''\n\n==Commemoration==\n\nAmsterdam's biggest park, the [[Vondelpark]], bears his name.

He believes all the worlds problems stem from its leaders and their disagreements and thus plots to take over the world using a gravity defying device called \"The Beetle\" to shift the moon out of orbit causing natural disasters to strong arm world leaders into giving into his demands. The Beetle was stolen by Rogue British spy, Simon Lane who switches it into Kendall's bag. Shortly later Simon is kidnapped and the boys find out about the beetle. The boys team up with Simon's daughter Penny to save Simon from Moon, but the negotiation goes wrong. The boys agree to help hunt Moon down to clear Simon's name, but Moon has Katie abducted. That night the boys and Penny race to Moon's mansion and fight his guards as Moon initiates his plan. The boys thwart the plan but Moon immediately takes Katie hostage again demanding they give him The Beetle. Kendall reluctantly tosses the Beetle to him and Katie steps on his foot, causing the beetle to latch onto his jacket, causing Moon to float away into the air. It is unknown if it released him but given the circumstances, Moon may be deceased.\n\n===Penny Lane===\n'''Penelope \"Penny\" Lane''' ([[Emma Lahana]]) is Simon Lane's daughter who was a trained spy by her father.

The boys team up with Simon's daughter Penny to rescue him, but the deal goes wrong. Simon notes that the boys are now public enemy because they were caught with the Beetle in their possession, so Simon promises to have the boys' names cleared if they help him deal with Moon, but Simon ends up getting tranquilized by Logan's mistake.

It was produced in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the end of [[World War II]]. The drama aired on November 1, 2005. Like [[Grave of the Fireflies|the anime]], the live-action version of ''Grave of the Fireflies'' focuses on two siblings, Seita and Setusko, struggling to survive the final days of the war in [[Kobe, Japan]]. Unlike the animated version however, it tells the story from the point of view of their cousin (their aunt's daughter) and also deals with the issue of how the war-time environment could change a kind lady into a hard-hearted woman. The film stars [[Nanako Matsushima]] as the aunt and [[Mao Inoue]] as their cousin (who also portrays the cousin's granddaughter).\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is something of an epilogue, set in 2005, 60 years after the [[Second World War]] ended. It opens at a crematorium in [[Kobe, Japan]], where a family is paying their respects to Hisako Sawano (Seita and Setusko's aunt), who has just passed away at the age of 95. The funeral director comments how a person who lived through the [[Meiji period|Meiji]], [[Taish\u014d period|Taish\u014d]], [[Sh\u014dwa period|Sh\u014dwa]] and [[Heisei period|Heisei]] eras had finally gone to rest. After the funeral, Natsu (Seita's and Setsuko's cousin), Hisako's eldest of four children who is now a grandmother herself, sorts through her mother's belongings with her teenage granddaughter, Keiko. Keiko unexpectedly finds the metal fruit-drop tin and asks why it's important. Natsu begins to tell her about the family's struggle to survive during the [[World War II|Second World War]], and the emotional scars that it left.\n\nIn the anime film, Seita and Setusko's aunt is their father's sister while in this film, she is their mother's is [[first cousin]].\n\nJust prior to Seita's death in September 1945, someone let Hisako and Natsu know that he was still alive, though with no sign of his sister Setsuko and living near the central railway station in Kobe. Hisako and Natsu go to the station in hope of finding Seita, but cannot. However, Natsu finds a janitor and asks him if he saw \"a third-year middle-school student, Seita Yokokawa, from Kobe 1st Middle School\", wearing a school cap and with his little sister. This triggers his memory and he recalls that the previous night, he and another janitor had seen a dead boy matching Seita's description in a corner of the station. While carrying his corpse to be cremated, a metal fruit-drop tin had fallen from his clothes; thinking it rubbish, the janitor had tossed it into a field.\n\nHisako locates the tin; while Natsu looks on, she opens it and tips two small bits of white bone into her palm \u2013 Setsuko's. Hisako falls silent, while Natsu, who understands what had happened to her cousins, blames her mother for causing their deaths and walks away, crying. After she leaves, Hisako notices two small, glowing fireflies under the tin. While watching them fly away, Hisako tearfully whispers a soft thanks, knowing she has been forgiven.\n\nIt is the 18th year of Showa \u2013 1943. Seita's father, a Captain in the Imperial Navy, privately reveals to him that the war is going badly for Japan, telling him that he must now look after his mother and sister as he will soon be deployed, and that he is willing to die in the Emperor's service. Seita gives his father his assurance, and his father promises that Japan will win the war despite the current situation. Meanwhile, his uncle, Genzo Sawano, a carpenter, has been drafted into the army, and his aunt is trying to hold back her tears at his departure.\n\nAfter the departure of both husbands, Hisako and Kyoko bump into each other; they spend the day together and Hisako gives Setsuko a tin with candy fruits. Hisako and Kyoko agree to try to help each other out while both their husbands are away.\n\nAs time progresses, an ever-increasing number of people are forced to deal with bombing raid and worsening shortages of food. On the day of the [[Bombing of Kobe in World War II|Kobe city firebombings]], Seita is burying food in his yard. Kyoko leaves to go to the bomb shelter as Seita and Setsuko soon follow. Both Seita and Setsuko are caught in the middle of the bombing but escape unharmed and Setsuko loses one of her sandals. After the bombings, they go to a school where doctors are giving medical attention to those hurt. As they arrive at the school, Hisako meets both of them outside and says that Kyoko was injured. He goes to see her while Hisako watches Setsuko. Inside, Seita finds his mother wrapped in bandages, the doctor says one of the bombs got into the shelter and went off. She dies soon after.\n\nHisako takes Setsuko home with her while Seita stays for the evening. He is given an urn with his mother's ashes in it. He returns to Hisako's house where he says that he will now be responsible for taking care of Setsuko, even though Hisako thinks he should go to school and she will watch Setsuko. Seita writes his father and tells him about the death of his mother and that he and Setsuko and staying with their aunt. He gives Setsuko their mother's jade ring, which Setsuko treasures, and wears on a necklace.\n\nAs food rations are dropping, Hisako starts to worry about how she will feed her children, nephew and niece. She then sells her [[Kimonos]] for money and is chastised for taking in two other children and how they don't help in time of war. As she is walking home. She gets word that her husband was killed in action, in a [[gyokusai|jeweled death]]. As she and her children grieve over his death, Seita tells her that she should feel happy and that his death has meaning; Hisako does not take this lightly. At night, her son is suffering from [[asthma]]; Setsuko starts crying and refusing to go to sleep. Hisako then leaves to try to find a doctor.\n\nThe next day, as they are eating, Seita and Setsuko are only served soup with no rice; they continue to get served very little while her children get plenty. During another bombing, Seita and Setsuko take refuge in an abandoned bomb shelter, seeing the bombing from a distance, it reminds them of a fireworks show they saw some years ago.\n\nHisako gets on to Seita about leaving on his own during the bombing and how he should start to help by letting Hisako sell his mother's jade ring for rice; Seita is hesitant at first but gives her the ring. Setsuko is refusing to let Hisako to selling a mother's ring to sell the rice when she screaming and crying. Later, Hisako tells Seita just have for rice at dinner tonight, but Setsuko gets angry, yelling, and hitting Seita for giving Hisako to selling the mother's ring to buy a rice.\n\nHisako continues to feed Seita and Setsuko very little, even making them start to provide their own water. Natsu chastises her mother for how she is treating them but Hisako ignores her. Seita and Setsuko leave and go to live in the shelter. Hisako says nothing but lets them go.\n\nWhile at the shelter, Seita entertains Setsuko by having fireflies inside. The following morning when she buries them, she tells Seita that she knows their mother was killed; Seita assures Setsuko that Japan will win the war and their father will return to them.\n\nMeanwhile, Hisako's brother-in-law, Yoshie, gives her some money and leaves her home. Seita and Setsuko begin to starve and Seita resorts to stealing food; Natsu witnesses the theft and is shocked; when the farmer catches him and asks if she knows him, she makes no comment and Seita leaves in shock with Setsuko. Setsuko becomes ill and when she is taken to the hospital, the doctor does very little to help.\n\nDuring another bombing, Seita breaks into a shop and steals food but is caught and beaten up by the store owner and taken to the police. After the bombing, Hisako comes to get him and is warned that if he does it again, she will be held responsible. As they are walking, Seita tries to explain his actions but Hisako tells him that she cannot feed them properly, Seita then runs away in anger back to the shelter where he breaks down into tears and Setsuko comforts him.\n\nThe following morning, Setsuko is eating marbles, thinking they are fruit drops. Seita decides use the remaining money he has and buy her food. An announcement is made by the emperor about the [[surrender of Japan]]; while Natsu is shocked by this announcement, Hisako goes to cook. When Seita hears the news, he also hears that the imperial fleet was wiped out as well, knowing his father has died in the process. At the shop, the store owners throw him out but he begs them to sell him food.\n\nHe returns to the shelter to cook some food only to find out that Setusko has [[Undernutrition in children|died]]. Meanwhile, Natsu and Hisako go to find them; they find the shelter they have been living in and are shocked to see how they have been living. Seita takes Setsuko to the top of a hill and places her body in straw casket and cremates her, he then takes some of her bones and places them in the candy tin. After this he goes to the railway station in Kobe, and dies.\n\nFollowing this flashback, both Natsu and Hisako leave the station, Natsu goes to the bridge where they saw fireflies the first time. Natsu feels guilty for what they did to them, but Hisako slaps her only to say that the real war has begun. After the war, Hisako and her children moved to [[Tokyo]] to start a new life and a law was passed to protect orphans affected by war.\n\nIn the present day, Natsu and Keiko are on the same bridge she was on years ago. Natsu reflects on how the war changed everyone and realizes her mother must have felt the weight of survival whenever she looked at Setusko's fruit-drop tin. As Keiko watches on, Natsu takes out Setsuko's remains and throws them into the river. Two fireflies then fly away, symbolizing Seita and Setsuko.\n\nAfter the closing scene, while the movie's credits role, images of children affected by military violence and occupation are shown. These images are interspersed with images of Seita and Setsuko. The modern-day images seem to be of Palestinian children including one girl smiling as she displays a photo of [[Yasser Arafat]].\n\n==Reaction==\n{{quote box|quote=The drama is liberal in deviating from the original work.

It was produced in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the end of [[World War II]]. The drama aired on November 1, 2005. Like [[Grave of the Fireflies|the anime]], the live-action version of ''Grave of the Fireflies'' focuses on two siblings, Seita and Setusko, struggling to survive the final days of the war in [[Kobe, Japan]]. Unlike the animated version however, it tells the story from the point of view of their cousin (their aunt's daughter) and also deals with the issue of how the war-time environment could change a kind lady into a hard-hearted woman. The film stars [[Nanako Matsushima]] as the aunt and [[Mao Inoue]] as their cousin (who also portrays the cousin's granddaughter).\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is something of an epilogue, set in 2005, 60 years after the [[Second World War]] ended. It opens at a crematorium in [[Kobe, Japan]], where a family is paying their respects to Hisako Sawano (Seita and Setusko's aunt), who has just passed away at the age of 95. The funeral director comments how a person who lived through the [[Meiji period|Meiji]], [[Taish\u014d period|Taish\u014d]], [[Sh\u014dwa period|Sh\u014dwa]] and [[Heisei period|Heisei]] eras had finally gone to rest. After the funeral, Natsu (Seita's and Setsuko's cousin), Hisako's eldest of four children who is now a grandmother herself, sorts through her mother's belongings with her teenage granddaughter, Keiko. Keiko unexpectedly finds the metal fruit-drop tin and asks why it's important. Natsu begins to tell her about the family's struggle to survive during the [[World War II|Second World War]], and the emotional scars that it left.\n\nIn the anime film, Seita and Setusko's aunt is their father's sister while in this film, she is their mother's is the first cousin.\n\nJust prior to Seita's death in September 1945, someone let Hisako and Natsu know that he was still alive, though with no sign of his sister Setsuko and living near the central railway station in Kobe. Hisako and Natsu go to the station in hope of finding Seita, but cannot. However, Natsu finds a janitor and asks him if he saw \"a third-year middle-school student, Seita Yokokawa, from Kobe 1st Middle School\", wearing a school cap and with his little sister. This triggers his memory and he recalls that the previous night, he and another janitor had seen a dead boy matching Seita's description in a corner of the station. While carrying his corpse to be cremated, a metal fruit-drop tin had fallen from his clothes; thinking it rubbish, the janitor had tossed it into a field.\n\nHisako locates the tin; while Natsu looks on, she opens it and tips two small bits of white bone into her palm \u2013 Setsuko's. Hisako falls silent, while Natsu, who understands what had happened to her cousins, blames her mother for causing their deaths and walks away, crying. After she leaves, Hisako notices two small, glowing fireflies under the tin. While watching them fly away, Hisako tearfully whispers a soft thanks, knowing she has been forgiven.\n\nIt is the 18th year of Showa \u2013 1943. Seita's father, a Captain in the Imperial Navy, privately reveals to him that the war is going badly for Japan, telling him that he must now look after his mother and sister as he will soon be deployed, and that he is willing to die in the Emperor's service. Seita gives his father his assurance, and his father promises that Japan will win the war despite the current situation. Meanwhile, his uncle, Genzo Sawano, a carpenter, has been drafted into the army, and his aunt is trying to hold back her tears at his departure.\n\nAfter the departure of both husbands, Hisako and Kyoko bump into each other; they spend the day together and Hisako gives Setsuko a tin with candy fruits. Hisako and Kyoko agree to try to help each other out while both their husbands are away.\n\nAs time progresses, an ever-increasing number of people are forced to deal with bombing raid and worsening shortages of food. On the day of the [[Bombing of Kobe in World War II|Kobe city firebombings]], Seita is burying food in his yard. Kyoko leaves to go to the bomb shelter as Seita and Setsuko soon follow. Both Seita and Setsuko are caught in the middle of the bombing but escape unharmed and Setsuko loses one of her sandals. After the bombings, they go to a school where doctors are giving medical attention to those hurt. As they arrive at the school, Hisako meets both of them outside and says that Kyoko was injured. He goes to see her while Hisako watches Setsuko. Inside, Seita finds his mother wrapped in bandages, the doctor says one of the bombs got into the shelter and went off. She dies soon after.\n\nHisako takes Setsuko home with her while Seita stays for the evening. He is given an urn with his mother's ashes in it. He returns to Hisako's house where he says that he will now be responsible for taking care of Setsuko, even though Hisako thinks he should go to school and she will watch Setsuko. Seita writes his father and tells him about the death of his mother and that he and Setsuko and staying with their aunt. He gives Setsuko their mother's jade ring, which Setsuko treasures, and wears on a necklace.\n\nAs food rations are dropping, Hisako starts to worry about how she will feed her children, nephew and niece. She then sells her [[Kimonos]] for money and is chastised for taking in two other children and how they don't help in time of war. As she is walking home. She gets word that her husband was killed in action, in a [[gyokusai|jeweled death]]. As she and her children grieve over his death, Seita tells her that she should feel happy and that his death has meaning; Hisako does not take this lightly. At night, her son is suffering from [[asthma]]; Setsuko starts crying and refusing to go to sleep. Hisako then leaves to try to find a doctor.\n\nThe next day, as they are eating, Seita and Setsuko are only served soup with no rice; they continue to get served very little while her children get plenty. During another bombing, Seita and Setsuko take refuge in an abandoned bomb shelter, seeing the bombing from a distance, it reminds them of a fireworks show they saw some years ago.\n\nHisako gets on to Seita about leaving on his own during the bombing and how he should start to help by letting Hisako sell his mother's jade ring for rice; Seita is hesitant at first but gives her the ring. Setsuko is refusing to let Hisako to selling a mother's ring to sell the rice when she screaming and crying. Later, Hisako tells Seita just have for rice at dinner tonight, but Setsuko gets angry, yelling, and hitting Seita for giving Hisako to selling the mother's ring to buy a rice.\n\nHisako continues to feed Seita and Setsuko very little, even making them start to provide their own water. Natsu chastises her mother for how she is treating them but Hisako ignores her. Seita and Setsuko leave and go to live in the shelter. Hisako says nothing but lets them go.\n\nWhile at the shelter, Seita entertains Setsuko by having fireflies inside. The following morning when she buries them, she tells Seita that she knows their mother was killed; Seita assures Setsuko that Japan will win the war and their father will return to them.\n\nMeanwhile, Hisako's brother-in-law, Yoshie, gives her some money and leaves her home. Seita and Setsuko begin to starve and Seita resorts to stealing food; Natsu witnesses the theft and is shocked; when the farmer catches him and asks if she knows him, she makes no comment and Seita leaves in shock with Setsuko. Setsuko becomes ill and when she is taken to the hospital, the doctor does very little to help.\n\nDuring another bombing, Seita breaks into a shop and steals food but is caught and beaten up by the store owner and taken to the police. After the bombing, Hisako comes to get him and is warned that if he does it again, she will be held responsible. As they are walking, Seita tries to explain his actions but Hisako tells him that she cannot feed them properly, Seita then runs away in anger back to the shelter where he breaks down into tears and Setsuko comforts him.\n\nThe following morning, Setsuko is eating marbles, thinking they are fruit drops. Seita decides use the remaining money he has and buy her food. An announcement is made by the emperor about the [[surrender of Japan]]; while Natsu is shocked by this announcement, Hisako goes to cook. When Seita hears the news, he also hears that the imperial fleet was wiped out as well, knowing his father has died in the process. At the shop, the store owners throw him out but he begs them to sell him food.\n\nHe returns to the shelter to cook some food only to find out that Setusko has [[Undernutrition in children|died]]. Meanwhile, Natsu and Hisako go to find them; they find the shelter they have been living in and are shocked to see how they have been living. Seita takes Setsuko to the top of a hill and places her body in straw casket and cremates her, he then takes some of her bones and places them in the candy tin. After this he goes to the railway station in Kobe, and dies.\n\nFollowing this flashback, both Natsu and Hisako leave the station, Natsu goes to the bridge where they saw fireflies the first time. Natsu feels guilty for what they did to them, but Hisako slaps her only to say that the real war has begun. After the war, Hisako and her children moved to [[Tokyo]] to start a new life and a law was passed to protect orphans affected by war.\n\nIn the present day, Natsu and Keiko are on the same bridge she was on years ago. Natsu reflects on how the war changed everyone and realizes her mother must have felt the weight of survival whenever she looked at Setusko's fruit-drop tin. As Keiko watches on, Natsu takes out Setsuko's remains and throws them into the river. Two fireflies then fly away, symbolizing Seita and Setsuko.\n\nAfter the closing scene, while the movie's credits role, images of children affected by military violence and occupation are shown. These images are interspersed with images of Seita and Setsuko. The modern-day images seem to be of Palestinian children including one girl smiling as she displays a photo of [[Yasser Arafat]].\n\n==Reaction==\n{{quote box|quote=The drama is liberal in deviating from the original work.

He founded the [[Muiderkring]], a literary society located at his home, the ''[[Muiderslot]]'', the castle of Muiden, in which he got to live due to his appointment as sheriff of Muiden. Among the members were the poets and playwrights [[Constantijn Huygens]], [[Maria Tesselschade]], [[Bredero|G.A. Bredero]] and [[Joost van den Vondel]], as well as the Portuguese singer [[Francisca Duarte]]. Hooft, Bredero, and Vondel were also founders of the [[First Nederduytsche Academy]].\n\n==Work==\nHooft was a prolific writer of [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[poem]]s and [[Letter (message)|letters]], but  from 1618 onwards he concentrated on writing a history of the Netherlands (''Nederduytsche Histori\u00ebn''), inspired by Roman historian [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]]. His focus was primarily on the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the [[Netherlands]] and [[Spain]] and though he tried to be as [[impartiality|impartial]] as possible, he did succeed.\n\nAs a poet, he was influenced by his [[Renaissance]] contemporaries in France and Italy.\n\n===Plays===\n[[File:Gerard van Honthorst - Granida and Daifilo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|[[Granida]] (and Daifilo) by [[Gerard van Honthorst]] ]]\n* ''Geeraerdt van Velsen'' ( 1613)\n* ''Achilles en Polyxena'' (1614)\n* ''Theseus en Ariane'' (1614)\n* ''Granida'' (1615)\n* ''Warenar'' (1616)\n* ''Baeto, oft oorsprong der Holanderen'' (1626)\n\n===Poems===\n* ''Emblemata amatoria: afbeeldingen van minne'' (1611)\n\n===History===\n* ''Nederduytsche Histori\u00ebn'' (1642-1656)\n\n==Present-day legacy==\nIn present-day [[Amsterdam]] Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft gives his name to [[P.C. Hooftstraat]], the city's main destination for expensive designer clothes shopping. The south-western end of P. C. Hooftstraat runs into the city's main park, the Vondelpark, named for his friend [[Joost van den Vondel]] (see Life above). In many other Dutch cities, there are other streets named after Hooft, many of them also called P. C. Hooftstraat or Pieter C. Hooftstraat.\n\nIn 1947, 300 years after P.C. Hooft died, [[P. C. Hooft Award|a literary prize in his name]] was instituted by the Dutch government. An independent foundation annually awards the prize. Initially it was awarded for specific works, but in recent years it is awarded based on the entire collection of a writer.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Sculptuur PCHooft Binnenplaats Muiderslot maart2003.jpg|Sculpture of P.C.

His focus was primarily on the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the [[Netherlands]] and [[Spain]] and though he tried to be as [[impartiality|impartial]] as possible, he did succeed.\n\nAs a poet, he was influenced by his [[Renaissance]] contemporaries in France and Italy.\n\n===Plays===\n[[File:Gerard van Honthorst - Granida and Daifilo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|[[Granida]] (and Daifilo) by [[Gerard van Honthorst]] ]]\n* ''Geeraerdt van Velsen'' ( 1613)\n* ''Achilles en Polyxena'' (1614)\n* ''Theseus en Ariane'' (1614)\n* ''Granida'' (1615)\n* ''Warenar'' (1616)\n* ''Baeto, oft oorsprong der Holanderen'' (1626)\n\n===Poems===\n* ''Emblemata amatoria: afbeeldingen van minne'' (1611)\n\n===History===\n* ''Nederduytsche Histori\u00ebn'' (1642-1656)\n\n==Present-day legacy==\nIn present-day [[Amsterdam]] Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft gives his name to [[P.C. Hooftstraat]], the city's main destination for expensive designer clothes shopping. The south-western end of P. C. Hooftstraat runs into the city's main park, the Vondelpark, named for his friend [[Joost van den Vondel]] (see Life above). In many other Dutch cities, there are other streets named after Hooft, many of them also called P. C. Hooftstraat or Pieter C. Hooftstraat.\n\nIn 1947, 300 years after P.C. Hooft died, [[P. C. Hooft Award|a literary prize in his name]] was instituted by the Dutch government. An independent foundation annually awards the prize. Initially it was awarded for specific works, but in recent years it is awarded based on the entire collection of a writer.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Sculptuur PCHooft Binnenplaats Muiderslot maart2003.jpg|Sculpture of P.C.
