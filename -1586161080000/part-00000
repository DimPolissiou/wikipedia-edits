When abnormalities such as [[vascular malformation]], [[Arteriovenous malformation|capillary arteriovenous malformations]] (AVMs), [[arteriovenous fistula]]s (AVFs) and overgrowth of a limb occur together in combination and disturb the complex network of blood vessels of the vascular system, it is known as PWS.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/9787/parkes-weber-syndrome|title=Parkes Weber syndrome, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The capillary malformations and AVFs are known to be present from the birth.

Patients who do not have multiple capillary malformations most likely did not inherit PWS and do not have RASA1 mutations. In such cases, the cause of PWS is often unknown and is sporadic as most cases often are.\n\nPWS is often confused with [[Klippel\u2013Tr\u00e9naunay syndrome]] (KTS). These two diseases are similar, but they are distinct. PWS occurs because of vascular malformation that may or may not be because of genetic mutations, whereas Klippel-Tr\u00e9naunay syndrome is a condition in which blood vessels and or lymph vessels do not form properly.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/945760-overview|title=Genetics of Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome|last=Sunderkrishnan, MD|first=Ravi|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> PWS and KTS almost have the same symptoms, except PWS patients are seen with both AVMs and AVFs occurring with limb hypertrophy.\n\n== Symptoms ==\nMajor symptoms of PWS include:\n\n'''Birthmarks:''' Affected PWS patients suffer from large, flat, pink staining on the skin. This staining is a result of the capillary malformations that have the tendency to increase the blood flow near the surface of the skin causing the staining. Because of the staining color they are sometimes referred to as \"[[port-wine stain]]s\". \"Port-wine stain\" or discoloration of the skin due to vascular malformation is also referred as [[nevus flammeus]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions-and-treatments/conditions/p/parkes-weber-syndrome/symptoms-and-causes|title=Parkes Weber Syndrome {{!}} Symptoms and Causes, Boston Children's Hospital|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Hypertrophy:''' [[Hypertrophy]] refers to excessive growth of the bone and soft tissue. In PWS patients a limb is overgrown and hypertrophy is usually seen in the affected limb.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Arm veins - 20090522.jpg|left|thumb|Bulging Veins]]\n\n'''Multiple arteriovenous fistulas:''' PWS patients also suffer from multiple AVFs that occur in conjunction with capillary malformations. AVFs occur because of abnormal connections between arteries and veins.<ref name=\":0\" /> Normally, blood flows from arteries to capillaries then to veins. But for AFV patients, because of the abnormal artery and vein connections, blood flows directly from arteries into the veins completely bypassing the capillaries.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriovenous-fistula/symptoms-causes/syc-20369567|title=Arteriovenous fistula, Mayo Clinic|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  These irregular connections affect the [[Circulatory system|blood circulation]] and may lead to life-threatening complications such as abnormal bleeding and [[heart failure]]. AVFs can be identified by: large, purplish bulging veins, swelling in limbs, decreased in [[blood pressure]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and [[heart failure]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n'''Capillary arteriovenous malformations:''' Vascular system disorder is the cause of the capillary malformations. Here, the capillaries are enlarged and increase the blood flow towards the surface of the skin.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/capillary-malformation-arteriovenous-malformation-syndrome|title=capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome, NIH Genetics Home Reference|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Because of the capillary malformations, the skin has multiple small, round, pink or even red dots.<ref name=\":2\" /> For most of the affected individuals, these malformations occur on the face, arms and or legs. The spots may be visible right from birth itself or they may develop during childhood years.<ref name=\":2\" /> If capillary malformations occur by themselves, it is not a huge threat to life. But when these occur in conjunction with AVFs then it is a clear indicator of PWS and may be serious depending on the severity of the malformations.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) reports of additional symptoms in PWS patients.

Some cases are a direct result of the RASA1 gene mutations. And individuals with RASA1 can be identified because this genetic mutation always causes multiple capillary malformations.<ref name=\":6\" /> PWS displays an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.<ref name=\":4\" /> This means that one copy of the damaged or altered gene is sufficient to elicit PWS disorder. In most cases, PWS can occur in people that have no family history of the condition. In such cases the mutation is sporadic. And for patients with PWS with the absence of multiple capillary mutations, the causes are unknown.\n\nAccording to Boston's Children Hospital, no known food, medications or drugs can cause PWS during pregnancy. PWS is not transmitted from person to person. But it can run in families and can be inherited. PWS affects both males and females equally and as of now no racial predominance is found.<ref name=\"Akhtar\">{{cite journal|last1=Akhtar|first1=M.A.|last2=Campbell|first2=D.J.|year=2008|title=Successful obstetrical management of a woman with Parkes\u2013Weber syndrome|journal=European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology|volume=140|issue=2|pages=290\u20131|doi=10.1016/j.ejogrb.2008.03.001|pmid=18439741}}</ref>\n\n== Mechanism ==\nThe causes for PWS without capillary malformations are currently unknown.

This pathway is very important as it directs cell functions such as growth, proliferation and controls the cell movement.<ref name=\"Zhou\" /> The p120-RasGAP protein regulates the RAS/MAPK pathway by acting as a negative regulator of the signaling pathway.<ref name=\":7\" /> It turns off signals.\n\nMutations in the RASA1 gene disrupt the normal formation of p120-RasGAP protein and result in a nonfunctional protein.<ref name=\":7\" /> The protein no longer regulates the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. However, according to NIH Genetics Home Reference, it is still unclear how exactly the disruption of p120-RasGAP protein formation leads to vascular abnormalities and limb overgrowth. But it is a known fact that somehow p120-RasGAP protein is crucial for the normal development of the vascular system and its complex network of blood vessels such as arteries, veins and capillaries.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nBased on current knowledge, disruption of p120-RasGAP protein is the reason behind blood vessel malformations which in turn lead to all sorts of problems such as: overgrowth in limbs, excess blood flow near the surface of the skin which leads to port wine stains and even heart failure can occur. The severity of the symptoms is based on extent of the malformations.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nMaking a correct diagnosis for a genetic and rare disease is oftentimes very challenging. So the doctors and other healthcare professions rely on the person's medical history, the severity of the symptoms, physical examination and lab tests to make and confirm a diagnosis.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere is a possibility of interpreting the symptoms of PWS with other conditions such as AVMs and or AVFs. This is because AVMs and AVFs also involve the characteristic overgrowth in soft tissue, bone and brain.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Also PWS can be misdiagnosed with Klippel\u2013Trenaunay syndrome (KTS).<ref name=\":5\" /> However, KTS consists of the following: triad capillary malformation, venous malformation, and [[lymphatic malformation]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome with Extensive Lymphangiomas | pmc=4637471 | pmid=26587303 | doi=10.1155/2015/581394 | volume=2015 | year=2015 |vauthors=Mneimneh S, Tabaja A, Rajab M | journal=Case Rep Pediatr | page=581394}}</ref>\n\nUsually a specific set of symptoms such as capillary and arteriovenous malformations occur together and this is used to distinguish PWS from similar conditions. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are caused by RASA1 mutations as well. Therefore, if all the other tests (discussed below) fail to determine PWS, which is highly unlikely, [[genetic testing]] such as [[sequence analysis]] and gene-targeted deletion/duplication analysis can be performed to identify possible RASA1 gene mutations.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nPWS can be distinguished from other conditions because of its defining port-wine stains that are large, flat and pink. The port-wine stains and physical examination are enough to diagnose PWS.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions-and-treatments/conditions/p/parkes-weber-syndrome/testing-and-diagnosis|title=Parkes Weber Syndrome {{!}} Conditions + Treatments|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> But additional testing is necessary to determine the extent of the PWS syndrome. The following tests may be ordered by physicians to help determine the appropriate next steps: [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], [[ultrasound]], [[CT scan|CT/CAT]] scan, [[Angiography|angiogram]], and [[Echocardiography|echocardiogram]].<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nMRI: This is a high-resolution scan that is used to identify the extent of the hypertrophy or overgrowth of the tissues.

In most cases, PWS can occur in people that have no family history of the condition. In such cases the mutation is sporadic. And for patients with PWS with the absence of multiple capillary mutations, the causes are unknown.\n\nAccording to Boston's Children Hospital, no known food, medications or drugs can cause PWS during pregnancy. PWS is not transmitted from person to person. But it can run in families and can be inherited.

However, according to NIH Genetics Home Reference, it is still unclear how exactly the disruption of p120-RasGAP protein formation leads to vascular abnormalities and limb overgrowth. But it is a known fact that somehow p120-RasGAP protein is crucial for the normal development of the vascular system and its complex network of blood vessels such as arteries, veins and capillaries.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nBased on current knowledge, disruption of p120-RasGAP protein is the reason behind blood vessel malformations which in turn lead to all sorts of problems such as: overgrowth in limbs, excess blood flow near the surface of the skin which leads to port wine stains and even heart failure can occur. The severity of the symptoms is based on extent of the malformations.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nMaking a correct diagnosis for a genetic and rare disease is oftentimes very challenging. So the doctors and other healthcare professions rely on the person's medical history, the severity of the symptoms, physical examination and lab tests to make and confirm a diagnosis.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere is a possibility of interpreting the symptoms of PWS with other conditions such as AVMs and or AVFs. This is because AVMs and AVFs also involve the characteristic overgrowth in soft tissue, bone and brain.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Also PWS can be misdiagnosed with Klippel\u2013Trenaunay syndrome (KTS).<ref name=\":5\" /> However, KTS consists of the following: triad capillary malformation, venous malformation, and [[lymphatic malformation]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome with Extensive Lymphangiomas | pmc=4637471 | pmid=26587303 | doi=10.1155/2015/581394 | volume=2015 | year=2015 |vauthors=Mneimneh S, Tabaja A, Rajab M | journal=Case Rep Pediatr | page=581394}}</ref>\n\nUsually a specific set of symptoms such as capillary and arteriovenous malformations occur together and this is used to distinguish PWS from similar conditions. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are caused by RASA1 mutations as well. Therefore, if all the other tests (discussed below) fail to determine PWS, which is highly unlikely, [[genetic testing]] such as [[sequence analysis]] and gene-targeted deletion/duplication analysis can be performed to identify possible RASA1 gene mutations.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nPWS can be distinguished from other conditions because of its defining port-wine stains that are large, flat and pink.

A lot of medical attention is needed to correct the blood vessels.\n\n== Recent research ==\nAccording to NIH clinical trials.gov, research on the port-wine stain and its relation to [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] of RASA1 has commenced in November 2010 and expected to end in November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01364857?cond=%22Parkes+Weber+syndrome%22&draw=1&rank=10|title=French National Cohort of Children With Port Wine Stain (CONAPE)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The purpose of the study is to assess how the port-wine stains can lead to complex syndromes such as PWS. Currently there is little knowledge about the epidemiology of the stains and how they progress with the disease. The research is ongoing and the results are yet to be published.\n\nIn another review published in July 2017 (discussed in treatments and prognosis), Banzic et al. discussed clinical findings that embolization works really well in patients with PWS. Also, embolization along with surgical resection that targets arteriovenous malformations reliably leads to significant clinical improvements.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome]]\n* [[List of cutaneous conditions]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |first1=Pinar |last1=Bayrak-Toydemir |first2=David |last2=Stevenson |date=February 22, 2011 |chapter=RASA1-Related Disorders |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52764/ |editor1-first=Roberta A |editor1-last=Pagon |editor2-first=Margaret P |editor2-last=Adam |editor3-first=Thomas D |editor3-last=Bird |editor4-first=Cynthia R |editor4-last=Dolan |editor5-first=Chin-To |editor5-last=Fong |editor6-first=Karen |editor6-last=Stephens |title=GeneReviews\u2122}}\n*{{OMIM|608355|PARKES WEBER SYNDROME}}\n*{{OMIM|187260|TELANGIECTASIA, HEREDITARY BENIGN}}\n*{{OMIM|187300|TELANGIECTASIA, HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC, OF RENDU, OSLER, AND WEBER; HHT}}\n*{{OMIM|185300|STURGE-WEBER SYNDROME; SWS}}\n*{{OMIM|149000|KLIPPEL-TRENAUNAY-WEBER SYNDROME}}\n*{{OMIM|138000|GLOMUVENOUS MALFORMATIONS; GVM}}\n*{{OMIM|139150|RAS p21 PROTEIN ACTIVATOR 1; RASA1 }}\n*{{OMIM|608354|CAPILLARY MALFORMATION-ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATION}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     = 33714 \n|  ICD10          =  \n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|759.6}} \n|  ICDO           =  \n|  OMIM           = 608355 \n|  MedlinePlus    =  \n|  eMedicineSubj  =  \n|  eMedicineTopic =  \n|  MeshID         =  \n|  Orphanet       = 90307\n}}\n{{Deficiencies of intracellular signaling peptides and proteins}}\n\n[[Category:Vascular-related cutaneous conditions]]\n[[Category:Syndromes]]\n", "name_user": "T\u00farelio", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)Duplicate:File:2100 Arm with Bulging Veins.jpg\u2192File:Arm veins - 20090522.jpgExact or scaled-down duplicate:c::File:Arm veins - 20090522.jpg", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkes_Weber_syndrome"}

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, Single season and career leaders. The Rainbow Warriors represent the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Mountain West Conference]] (MW).\n\nAlthough Hawaii began competing in intercollegiate football in 1909, the school's official record book considers<ref name=\"MG\" /> the \"modern era\" to have begun in 1968. Records from before this year are often incomplete and inconsistent, and they are generally not included in these lists.\n\nThese lists are dominated by more recent players for several reasons:\n* Since 1968, college football seasons have increased from 10 games to 11 and then 12 games in length. Additionally, the NCAA allows Hawaii to play one more game each season than institutions located on the U.S. mainland,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D117.pdf |title=Bylaw 17.28.2: Alaska/Hawaii, Additional Football Contest |work=2016\u201317 NCAA Division I Manual |page=288 |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=December 24, 2016}}</ref> presumably as compensation for the costs required to travel to games on the mainland. In turn, this means that a typical Hawaii season now consists of 13 regular-season games, not counting possible conference championship games or bowl appearances.\n* The NCAA didn't allow freshmen to play varsity football until [[1972 college football season|1972]] (with the exception of the [[World War II]] years), allowing players to have four-year careers.\n* [[Bowl game]]s only began counting toward single-season and career statistics in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://a.espncdn.com/ncf/news/2002/0828/1423821.html|title = NCAA changes policy on football stats|date = 2002-08-28|accessdate = 2014-09-11|website = ESPN.com|publisher = AP|last = |first = }}</ref> The Rainbow Warriors have played in 10 bowl games since then.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mountainwest/hawaii/bowl_history.php|title = Hawaii Bowl History|accessdate = 2014-11-16|website = CFbDataWarehouse.com|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141126153324/http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mountainwest/hawaii/bowl_history.php|archivedate = 2014-11-26}}</ref>\n* The Rainbow Warriors also played in the [[2019 Mountain West Conference Football Championship Game|2019 MW Championship Game]], giving players in that season yet another game to accumulate statistics.\n\nThese lists are updated through the end of the [[2019 Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football team|2019 season]].

of the [[Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football]] program in various categories,<ref name=MG>{{Cite web|url=https://hawaiiathletics.com/documents/2019/7/22/2019_Hawaii_Football_Media_Guide.pdf |title=2019

(American football)|rushing]], [[Reception (American football)|receiving]], [[total offense]], defensive stats, and [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|kicking]]. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, Single season and career leaders. The Rainbow Warriors represent the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Mountain West Conference]] (MW).\n\nAlthough Hawaii began competing in intercollegiate football in 1909, the school's official record book considers<ref name=\"MG\" /> the \"modern era\" to have begun in 1968. Records from before this year are often incomplete and inconsistent, and they are generally not included in these lists.\n\nThese lists are dominated by more recent players for several reasons:\n* Since 1968, college football seasons have increased from 10 games to 11 and then 12 games in length. Additionally, the NCAA allows Hawaii to play one more game each season than institutions located on the U.S. mainland,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D117.pdf |title=Bylaw 17.28.2: Alaska/Hawaii, Additional Football Contest |work=2016\u201317 NCAA Division I Manual |page=288 |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=December 24, 2016}}</ref> presumably as compensation for the costs required to travel to games on the mainland. In turn, this means that a typical Hawaii season now consists of 13 regular-season games, not counting possible conference championship games or bowl appearances.\n* The NCAA didn't allow freshmen to play varsity football until [[1972 college football season|1972]] (with the exception of the [[World War II]] years), allowing players to have four-year careers.\n* [[Bowl game]]s only began counting toward single-season and career statistics in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://a.espncdn.com/ncf/news/2002/0828/1423821.html|title = NCAA changes policy on football stats|date = 2002-08-28|accessdate = 2014-09-11|website = ESPN.com|publisher = AP|last = |first = }}</ref> The Rainbow Warriors have played in 10 bowl games since then.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mountainwest/hawaii/bowl_history.php|title = Hawaii Bowl History|accessdate = 2014-11-16|website = CFbDataWarehouse.com|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141126153324/http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mountainwest/hawaii/bowl_history.php|archivedate = 2014-11-26}}</ref>\n* The Rainbow Warriors also played in the [[2019 Mountain West Conference Football Championship Game|2019 MW Championship Game]], giving players in that season yet another game to accumulate statistics.\n\nThese lists are updated through the end of the [[2019 Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football team|2019 season]]. The Hawaii 2019 Media Guide does not list a top 10 for every statistic, sometimes only listing a single leader.<ref name=\"MG\" />\n\n==Passing==\n\n===Passing

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:Port Gardner Bay, Everett, Washington, October 1891 (LAROCHE 278).jpeg|thumb|right|Looking south on the [[Seattle and Montana Railroad]] as it passes [[Port Gardner]] Bay in 1891]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.
