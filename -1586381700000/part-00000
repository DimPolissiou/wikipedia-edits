The various components of the ceiling are linked to this Christian doctrine.<ref name=\"Gardner 1\" /> Traditionally, the Old Testament was perceived as a prefiguring of the New Testament. Many incidents and characters of the Old Testament were commonly understood as having a direct symbolic link to some particular aspect of the life of Jesus or to an important element of Christian doctrine or to a sacrament such as Baptism or the Eucharist.

He was familiar with early Humanist-inspired sculptural works such as [[Donatello|Donatello's]] bronze ''[[David (Donatello)|David]]'' and had himself responded by carving the enormous nude marble ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', which was placed in the [[Piazza della Signoria]] near the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], the home of Florence's council.<ref>Gardner, p.466\u2013467</ref> The Humanist vision of humanity was one in which people responded to other people, to social responsibility, and to God in a direct way, not through intermediaries, such as the Church.<ref name=\"MA\">Aston 1979, pp.&nbsp;111\u2013112</ref> {{Citation needed span|text=This conflicted with the Church's emphasis.

There are two main proposals.\n\nThe majority theory is that the ceiling's main frescoes were applied and painted in phases, with the scaffolding each time dismantled and moved to another part of the room, beginning at the Chapel's west end.<ref name=\":7\" /> The first phase, including the central life of Noah, was completed in September 1509 and the scaffolding removed - only then were the scenes visible from the floor level.<ref name=\":7\" /> The next phase, in the middle of the Chapel, completed the ''Creation of Eve'' and the ''Fall and Expulsion from Paradise''. The ''Cumaean Sibyl'' and ''Ezekiel'' were also painted in this phase.<ref name=\":7\" /> Michelangelo painted the figures at a larger scale than in the previous section; this is attributed to the artist's ability to effectively judge the foreshortening and composition from ground level for the first time.<ref name=\":7\" /> The figures of the third phase, at the east end, were at still grander scale than the second; the ''Creation of Adam'' and the other ''Creation'' panels were finished at this stage, which took take place in 1511.<ref name=\":7\" /> The lunettes above the windows were painted last, using a small movable scaffold.<ref name=\":7\" /> In this scheme, proposed by [[Johannes Wilde]], the vault's first and second registers, above and below the fictive architectural cornice, were painted together in stages as the scaffolding moved eastwards, with a stylistic and chronological break westwards and eastwards of the ''Creation of Eve''.<ref name=\":6\" /> After the central vault the main scaffold was replaced by a smaller contraction that allowed the painting of the lunettes, window vaults, and pendentives.<ref name=\":7\" /> This view supplanted an older view that the central vault formed the first part of the work and was completed before work began on the other parts of Michelangelo's plan.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nAnother theory is that the scaffolding must have spanned the entire Chapel for years at a time.<ref name=\":6\" /> To remove the existing decoration of the ceiling, the entire area had to be accessible for workmen to chisel away the starry sky fresco before any new work was done.<ref name=\":6\" /> On 10 June 1508 the cardinals complained of the intolerable dust and noise generated by the work; by the 27 July 1508 the process was complete and the corner spandrels of the Chapel had been converted into the doubled-spandrel triangular pendentives of the finished design.<ref name=\":6\" /> Then the frame of the new designs had to be marked out on the surface when frescoeing began; this too demanded access to the whole ceiling.<ref name=\":6\" /> This thesis is supported by the discovery during the modern restoration of the exact numbers of the ''giornate'' employed in the frescoes; if the ceiling was painted in two stages, the first spanning two years and extending to the ''Creation of Eve'' and the second lasting just one year, then Michelangelo would have to have painted 270 ''giornate'' in the one-year second phase, compared with 300 painted in the first two years, which is scarcely possible.<ref name=\":6\" /> By contrast, if the ceiling's first register - with the nine scenes on rectangular fields, the medallions, and the ''ignudi'' - was painted in the first two years, and in the second phase Michelangelo painted only their border in the second register, with the ''Prophets'' and ''Sibyls'', then the ''giornate'' finished in each year are divided almost equally.<ref name=\":6\" /> [[Ulrich Pfisterer (art historian)|Ulrich Pfisterer]], advancing this theory, interprets Albertini's remark on \"the upper, arched part with very beautiful pictures and gold\" in February 1510 as referring only to upper part of the vault - the first register with its nine picture fields, its ''ignudi,'' and its medallions embellished with gold - and not to the vault as a whole, since the fictive architectural [[Attic style|attic]] with its prophets and prophetesses were yet to be started.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe scaffolding needed to protect the Chapel's existing wall frescoes and other decorations from falling debris and allow the religious services to continue below, but also to allow in air and some light from the windows below.<ref name=\":6\" /> The Chapel's cornice, running around the room below the lunettes at the springing of the window arches themselves, supported the structure's oblique beams, while the carrying beams were set into the wall above the cornice using [[Putlog hole|putlog holes]].<ref name=\":6\" /> This open structure supported [[Catwalk (theater)|catwalks]] and the movable working platform itself, whose likely stepped design followed the contour of the vault. Beneath was a false-ceiling that protected the Chapel.<ref name=\":6\" /> Though some sun light would have entered the work space between the ceiling and the scaffolding, artificial light would have been required for painting, candlelight possibly influencing the appearance of the vivid colours used.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nMichelangelo designed his own [[scaffold]], a flat wooden platform on brackets built out from holes in the wall near the top of the windows, rather than being built up from the floor. Mancinelli speculates that this was in order to cut the cost of timber.<ref name=\"Fabio\" /> According to Michelangelo's pupil and biographer Ascanio Condivi, the brackets and frame that supported the steps and flooring were all put in place at the beginning of the work and a lightweight screen, possibly cloth, was suspended beneath them to catch plaster drips, dust, and splashes of paint.<ref name=\"Condivi\">Condivi 1553.{{Page needed|date=March 2020}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=March 2020}} Only half the room was scaffolded at a time and the platform was moved as the painting was done in stages.<ref name=\"Fabio\">Mancinelli 1986, pp.&nbsp;220\u2013259</ref> The areas of the wall covered by the scaffolding still appear as unpainted areas across the bottom of the [[lunette]]s. {{Citation needed span|text=The holes were re-used to hold scaffolding in the latest restoration.|date=March 2020|reason=}}\n\nThe entire ceiling is a [[fresco]], which is an ancient method for painting [[mural]]s that relies upon a chemical reaction between damp lime plaster and water-based pigments to permanently fuse the work into the wall.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.artsy.net/gene/fresco |title=Fresco {{!}} Artsy |website=[[Artsy (website)|Artsy]] |accessdate=April 30, 2019}}</ref> Michelangelo had been an apprentice in the workshop of Domenico Ghirlandaio, one of the most competent and prolific of Florentine fresco painters, at the time that the latter was employed on a fresco cycle at [[Santa Maria Novella]] and whose work was represented on the walls of the Sistine Chapel.<ref>Goldscheider 1951.{{Page needed|date=March 2020}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=March 2020}} At the outset, the plaster, [[wiktionary:intonaco|''intonaco'']], began to grow [[mold|mould]] because it was too wet.

Humanity then sank further into sin and disgrace, and was punished by the [[Great Flood]]. Through a lineage of [[Genealogy of Jesus|ancestors]] \u2013 from [[Abraham]] to [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] \u2013 God sent the saviour of humanity, Jesus Christ. The coming of the Saviour was prophesied by [[Prophet]]s of Israel and [[Sibyl]]s of the Classical world. The various components of the ceiling are linked to this Christian doctrine.<ref name=\"Gardner 1\" /> Traditionally, the Old Testament was perceived as a prefiguring of the New Testament. Many incidents and characters of the Old Testament were commonly understood as having a direct symbolic link to some particular aspect of the life of Jesus or to an important element of Christian doctrine or to a sacrament such as Baptism or the Eucharist. [[Jonah]], for example, recognisable by his attribute of a great fish, was commonly seen to symbolize Jesus' death and resurrection.<ref name=\"OM\" />{{Page needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nMuch of the symbolism of the ceiling dates from the early church, but the ceiling also has elements that express the specifically Renaissance thinking that sought to reconcile Christian theology with the philosophy of [[Renaissance humanism]].<ref>O'Malley, p.112</ref> During the 15th century in Italy, and in [[Florence]] in particular, there was a strong interest in [[Classics|Classical literature]] and the philosophies of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] and other Classical writers. Michelangelo, as a young man, had spent time at the [[Platonic Academy (Florence)|Platonic Academy]] established by the [[Medici]] family in Florence. He was familiar with early Humanist-inspired sculptural works such as [[Donatello|Donatello's]] bronze ''[[David (Donatello)|David]]'' and had himself responded by carving the enormous nude marble ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', which was placed in the [[Piazza della Signoria]] near the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], the home of Florence's council.<ref>Gardner, p.466\u2013467</ref> The Humanist vision of humanity was one in which people responded to other people, to social responsibility, and to God in a direct way, not through intermediaries, such as the Church.<ref name=\"MA\">Aston 1979, pp.&nbsp;111\u2013112</ref> {{Citation needed span|text=This conflicted with the Church's emphasis.

There are two main proposals.\n\nThe majority theory is that the ceiling's main frescoes were applied and painted in phases, with the scaffolding each time dismantled and moved to another part of the room, beginning at the Chapel's west end.<ref name=\":7\" /> The first phase, including the central life of Noah, was completed in September 1509 and the scaffolding removed - only then were the scenes visible from the floor level.<ref name=\":7\" /> The next phase, in the middle of the Chapel, completed the ''Creation of Eve'' and the ''Fall and Expulsion from Paradise''. The ''Cumaean Sibyl'' and ''Ezekiel'' were also painted in this phase.<ref name=\":7\" /> Michelangelo painted the figures at a larger scale than in the previous section; this is attributed to the artist's ability to effectively judge the foreshortening and composition from ground level for the first time.<ref name=\":7\" /> The figures of the third phase, at the east end, were at still grander scale than the second; the ''Creation of Adam'' and the other ''Creation'' panels were finished at this stage, which took take place in 1511.<ref name=\":7\" /> The lunettes above the windows were painted last, using a small movable scaffold.<ref name=\":7\" /> In this scheme, proposed by [[Johannes Wilde]], the vault's first and second registers, above and below the fictive architectural cornice, were painted together in stages as the scaffolding moved eastwards, with a stylistic and chronological break westwards and eastwards of the ''Creation of Eve''.<ref name=\":6\" /> After the central vault the main scaffold was replaced by a smaller contraction that allowed the painting of the lunettes, window vaults, and pendentives.<ref name=\":7\" /> This view supplanted an older view that the central vault formed the first part of the work and was completed before work began on the other parts of Michelangelo's plan.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nAnother theory is that the scaffolding must have spanned the entire Chapel for years at a time.<ref name=\":6\" /> To remove the existing decoration of the ceiling, the entire area had to be accessible for workmen to chisel away the starry sky fresco before any new work was done.<ref name=\":6\" /> On 10 June 1508 the cardinals complained of the intolerable dust and noise generated by the work; by the 27 July 1508 the process was complete and the corner spandrels of the Chapel had been converted into the doubled-spandrel triangular pendentives of the finished design.<ref name=\":6\" /> Then the frame of the new designs had to be marked out on the surface when frescoeing began; this too demanded access to the whole ceiling.<ref name=\":6\" /> This thesis is supported by the discovery during the modern restoration of the exact numbers of the ''giornate'' employed in the frescoes; if the ceiling was painted in two stages, the first spanning two years and extending to the ''Creation of Eve'' and the second lasting just one year, then Michelangelo would have to have painted 270 ''giornate'' in the one-year second phase, compared with 300 painted in the first two years, which is scarcely possible.<ref name=\":6\" /> By contrast, if the ceiling's first register - with the nine scenes on rectangular fields, the medallions, and the ''ignudi'' - was painted in the first two years, and in the second phase Michelangelo painted only their border in the second register, with the ''Prophets'' and ''Sibyls'', then the ''giornate'' finished in each year are divided almost equally.<ref name=\":6\" /> [[Ulrich Pfisterer (art historian)|Ulrich Pfisterer]], advancing this theory, interprets Albertini's remark on \"the upper, arched part with very beautiful pictures and gold\" in February 1510 as referring only to upper part of the vault - the first register with its nine picture fields, its ''ignudi,'' and its medallions embellished with gold - and not to the vault as a whole, since the fictive architectural [[Attic style|attic]] with its prophets and prophetesses were yet to be started.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe scaffolding needed to protect the Chapel's existing wall frescoes and other decorations from falling debris and allow the religious services to continue below, but also to allow in air and some light from the windows below.<ref name=\":6\" /> The Chapel's cornice, running around the room below the lunettes at the springing of the window arches themselves, supported the structure's oblique beams, while the carrying beams were set into the wall above the cornice using [[Putlog hole|putlog holes]].<ref name=\":6\" /> This open structure supported [[Catwalk (theater)|catwalks]] and the movable working platform itself, whose likely stepped design followed the contour of the vault.

Mancinelli speculates that this was in order to cut the cost of timber.<ref name=\"Fabio\" /> According to Michelangelo's pupil and biographer Ascanio Condivi, the brackets and frame that supported the steps and flooring were all put in place at the beginning of the work and a lightweight screen, possibly cloth, was suspended beneath them to catch plaster drips, dust, and splashes of paint.<ref name=\"Condivi\">Condivi 1553.{{Page needed|date=March 2020}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=March 2020}} Only half the room was scaffolded at a time and the platform was moved as the painting was done in stages.<ref name=\"Fabio\">Mancinelli 1986, pp.&nbsp;220\u2013259</ref> The areas of the wall covered by the scaffolding still appear as unpainted areas across the bottom of the [[lunette]]s. {{Citation needed span|text=The holes were re-used to hold scaffolding in the latest restoration.|date=March 2020|reason=}}\n\nThe entire ceiling is a [[fresco]], which is an ancient method for painting [[mural]]s that relies upon a chemical reaction between damp lime plaster and water-based pigments to permanently fuse the work into the wall.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.artsy.net/gene/fresco |title=Fresco {{!}} Artsy |website=[[Artsy (website)|Artsy]] |accessdate=April 30, 2019}}</ref> Michelangelo had been an apprentice in the workshop of Domenico Ghirlandaio, one of the most competent and prolific of Florentine fresco painters, at the time that the latter was employed on a fresco cycle at [[Santa Maria Novella]] and whose work was represented on the walls of the Sistine Chapel.<ref>Goldscheider 1951.{{Page needed|date=March 2020}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=March 2020}} At the outset, the plaster, [[wiktionary:intonaco|''intonaco'']], began to grow [[mold|mould]] because it was too wet.
