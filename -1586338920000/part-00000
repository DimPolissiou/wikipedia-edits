His territory was severely limited due to his father's rule that he could only sell to people living on their side of the block.\n\nWhile at Morgan State University, Graves made a name for himself as an entrepreneur. Realizing that there was a big market for flowers during Homecoming Week, he went to two competing local florists and cut deals with both to sell flowers on campus. For a percentage of the profits, the florists provided the flowers while Graves covered the campus.\n\nHis time serving on the SBA's advisory board and his direct work with the agency would lead Grave to his belief in the need for advice to businesses in economic development and urban affairs, which convinced him to create an annual newsletter that would chronicle issues relevant to black business people, and raise awareness of the importance of black consumer power.  At the suggestion of then SBA Director [[Howard J. Samuels]], Graves would expand the concept of a newsletter into a full-fledged magazine.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3dXw6gR2GgkC&lpg=PA349&dq=Howard+samuels+robert+kennedy&pg=PA349#v=onepage&q=Howard+samuels+robert+kennedy&f=false|title=African American Lives|first1=Henry Louis Gates|last1=Jr|first2=Evelyn Brooks|last2=Higginbotham|date=April 29, 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780199882861}}</ref>\n\nGraves started Earl G.

[[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Parliament of India|Parliament]], with the [[upper house]] being the [[Rajya Sabha]].

The house meets in the Lok Sabha Chambers of the [[Parliament House (India)|Sansad Bhavan]], [[New Delhi]].\n\nThe maximum strength of the House allotted by the [[Constitution of India]] is 550. Currently, the house has 543 seats which is made up by the election of up to 543 elected members and at a maximum.

The [[Indian Councils Act 1861]] provided for a Legislative Council consisting of the members of the Executive Council and non-official members. The [[Indian Councils Act 1892]] established legislatures in each of the [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|provinces of British India]] and increased the powers of the Legislative Council.

The Constituent Assembly was divided into two for the separate nations, with each new Assembly having sovereign powers transferred to it for the respective dominion.\n\nThe Constitution of India was adopted on 26 November 1949 and came into effect on 26 January 1950, proclaiming India to be a sovereign, democratic republic. This contained the founding principles of the law of the land which would govern India in its new form, which now included all the princely states which had not ''[[Princely states of Pakistan|acceded to Pakistan]]''.\n\nAccording to ''Article 79 (Part V-The Union.)'' of the Constitution of India, the Parliament of India consists of the President of India and the two Houses of Parliament known as the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) and the House of the People (Lok Sabha).<ref>[http://india.gov.in/sites/upload_files/npi/files/coi_part_full.pdf Part V\u2014The Union.

Elections are by the people directly to the Lok Sabha and each state is divided into territorial constituencies under two provisions of the Constitution:\n# Each state \"is\" (See Note 1) allotted a number of seats in the Lok Sabha in such a manner that the ratio between that number and its population was as close to uniform as possible. This provision does not apply for states having a population of less than 6 million (60 [[lakh]]s). The number of seats per state has been frozen under the constitutional amendment of 1976.\n# Each state is divided into territorial constituencies in such a manner that the ratio between the population of each [[List of constituencies of the Lok Sabha|constituency]] and the number of seats allotted to it (in each case, one) remain the same throughout the state. This principle is upheld by the boundary reviews mentioned above.\n\nNotes:\n#The expression \"population\" while distributing seats among states refers to the population ascertained at the [[Census of India|census]] of 1971, per the Constitutional Amendment of 1976.<ref>https://www.india.gov.in/sites/upload_files/npi/files/coi_part_full.pdf article 81</ref>\n#The expression \"population\" while distributing constituencies within a state refers to the population ascertained at the [[Census of India|census]] of 2011.<ref>//www.india.gov.in/sites/upload_files/npi/files/coi_part_full.pdf article 81</ref>\n\n==Powers==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Loksabha Chamber Side View.png|thumb|'''Lok Sabha Chamber''']] -->\nThe Lok Sabha has certain powers that make it more powerful than the Rajya Sabha.\n\n* [[Motion of confidence|Motions of no confidence]] against the [[Government of India|government]] can be introduced and passed in the Lok Sabha. If passed by a majority vote, the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] and the [[Council of Ministers of India|Council of Ministers]] resign collectively. The Rajya Sabha has no power over such a motion, and hence has no real power over the executive. This is because the [[Constitution of India]] has only made the Union Council of ministers responsible to the Lok Sabha, not to the Rajya Sabha.\n*[[Money bill]]s can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, and upon being passed, are sent to the [[Rajya Sabha]], where it can be deliberated on for up to 14 days. If not rejected by the Rajya Sabha, or 14 days lapse from the introduction of the bill in the Rajya Sabha without any action by the House, or recommendations made by the [[Rajya Sabha]] are not accepted by the Lok Sabha, the bill is considered passed. The [[Economy of India|budget]] is presented in the Lok Sabha by the [[Minister of Finance (India)|Finance Minister]] in the name of the President of India.\n*In matters pertaining to non-financial (ordinary) bills, after the bill has been passed by the House where it was originally tabled (Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha), it is sent to the other house, where it may be kept for a maximum period of 6 months. If the other House rejects the bill or a period of 6 months elapses without any action by that House, or the House that originally tabled the bill does not accept the recommendations made by the members of the other house, it results in a deadlock. This is resolved by a joint session of both Houses, presided over by the speaker of the Lok Sabha and decided by a [[Plurality (voting)|simple majority]]. Though the Constitution has placed both houses on the same footing in this regard, in reality it is the Lok Sabha's opinions that mostly prevails\u2014due to its bigger numerical strength.\n*Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in initiating and passing any [[Constitution of India#Amendment|Bill for Constitutional Amendment]] (by a majority of the total membership of the House and at least two-thirds majority of the members present and voting).\n*Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in initiating and passing a motion for the [[President of India#Impeachment|impeachment of the President]] (by two-thirds of the membership of the House).\n*Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in impeachment process (initiating and passing a motion for the removal) of the judges of the Supreme Court and the state High Courts (by a majority of the membership of the House and at least two-thirds majority of the members present and voting), who then can be removed by the President of India.\n*Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in initiating and passing a resolution declaring war or national emergency (by two-thirds majority) or constitutional emergency (by simple majority) in a state.\n*If the Lok Sabha is dissolved before or after the declaration of a [[National Emergency in India|National Emergency]], the Rajya Sabha becomes the sole Parliament. It cannot be dissolved. This is a limitation on the Lok Sabha. But there is a possibility that president can exceed the term to not more than 1 year under the proclamation of emergency and the same would be lowered down to six-month if the said proclamation ceases to operate.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that the Lok Sabha is more powerful than the Rajya Sabha in almost all matters. Even in those matters in which the Constitution has placed both Houses on an equal footing, the Lok Sabha has more influence due to its greater numerical strength. This is typical of any Parliamentary democracy, with the lower House always being more powerful than the upper.\n\n==Procedure==\n\n===Procedure in the House===\nThe Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha and Directions issued by [[Speaker of the Lok Sabha|the Speaker]] from time to time there under regulate the procedure in Lok Sabha. The items of business, notice of which is received from the Ministers/ Private Members and admitted by the Speaker, are included in the daily List of Business which is printed and circulated to members in advance.\n\n=== Sessions and Time of Sittings===\nThree sessions of Lok Sabha take place in a year:\n*Budget session: February to May.\n*Monsoon session: July to September.\n*Winter session: November to mid-December.\n\nWhen in session, Lok Sabha holds its sittings usually from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. On some days the sittings are continuously held without observing lunch break and are also extended beyond 6 p.m. depending upon the business before the House. Lok Sabha does not ordinarily sit on Saturdays and Sundays and other closed holidays.\n\n===Question Hour===\nThe first hour of every sitting is called [[Question Hour]]. Asking questions in Parliament is the free and unfettered right of members, and during Question Hour they may ask questions of ministers on different aspects of administration and government policy in the national and international spheres. Every minister whose turn it is to answer to questions has to stand up and answer for his department's acts of omission or commission.\n\nQuestions are of three types\u2014Starred, Unstarred and Short Notice. A Starred Question is one to which a member desires an oral answer in the House and which is distinguished by an asterisk mark. An unstarred Question is one which is not called for oral answer in the house and on which no supplementary questions can consequently be asked. An answer to such a question is given in writing. Minimum period of notice for starred/unstarred question is 10 clear days. If the questions given notice of are admitted by the Speaker, they are listed and printed for answer on the dates allotted to the Ministries to which the subject matter of the question pertains.\n\nThe normal period of notice does not apply to short-notice questions which relate to matters of urgent public importance. However, a short-notice question may be answered only on short notice if so permitted by the Speaker and the Minister concerned is prepared to answer it at shorter notice. A short-notice question is taken up for answer immediately after the Question Hour, popularly known as Zero Hour.\n\n===Zero Hour===\nThe time immediately following the Question Hour has come to be known as \"Zero Hour\". It starts at around 12 noon (hence the name) and members can, with prior notice to the Speaker, raise issues of importance during this time. Typically, discussions on important Bills, the Budget, and other issues of national importance take place from 2 p.m. onwards.\n\n===Business after Question Hour===\nAfter the Question Hour, the House takes up miscellaneous items of work before proceeding to the main business of the day. These may consist of one or more of the following: Adjournment Motions, Questions involving breaches of Privileges, Papers to be laid on the Table, Communication of any messages from Rajya Sabha, Intimations regarding President's assent to Bills, Calling Attention Notices, Matters under Rule 377, Presentation of Reports of Parliamentary Committee, Presentation of Petitions, miscellaneous statements by Ministers, Motions regarding elections to Committees, Bills to be withdrawn or introduced.\n\n===Main Business===\nThe main business of the day may be consideration of a Bill or financial business or consideration of a resolution or a motion.\n\n====Legislative Business====\nLegislative proposals in the form of a Bill can be brought forward either by a Minister or by a private member. In the former case it is known as Government Bill and in the latter case it is known as a Private Members' Bill. Every Bill passes through three stages\u2014called three readings\u2014before it is passed. To become law it must be passed by both the Houses of Parliament, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and then assented to by the president.\n\n====Financial Business====\nThe presentation, discussion of, and voting on the annual General and Railways budgets\u2014followed by the passing of the Appropriations Bill and the Finance Bill\u2014is a long, drawn-out process that takes up a major part of the time of the House during its Budget Session every year.\n\n====Motions and Resolutions====\nAmong other kinds of business that come up before the House are resolutions and motions. Resolutions and motions may be brought forward by Government or by private members. Government may move a resolution or a motion for obtaining the sanction to a scheme or opinion of the House on an important matter of policy or on a grave situation. Similarly, a private member may move a resolution or motion in order to draw the attention of the House and of the Government to a particular problem. The last two and half hours of sitting on every Friday are generally allotted for transaction of private members' business. While private members' bills are taken up on one Friday, private members' resolutions are taken up on the succeeding Friday, and so on.\n\n=== Parliamentary Committees ===\nMost of the business of drafting a bill or amendments are initially discussed and debated in the parliamentary committees. Since the time for legislation is limited, work of all departments of the government and any special focus tasks is delegated to the committees, wherein the committees shall prepare the initial draft of the bill/amendment for the consideration by both the houses. They consist of members from both the houses.\n\nThere are primarily two kinds of parliamentary committees based on their nature:-\n* Parliament Standing Committees (PSC) \u2013 Permanent in nature, reconstituted time to time with every new election.\n** Department based\n** Others\n* Ad hoc Committees \u2013 Created for specific purpose and ceases to exist when that purpose is achieved.\n\n===Half-an-Hour Discussion===\nA Half-an-Hour Discussion can be raised on a matter of sufficient public importance which has been the subject of a recent question in Lok Sabha irrespective of the fact whether the question was answered orally or the answer was laid on the Table of the House and the answer which needs elucidation on a matter of fact. Normally not more than half an hour is allowed for such a discussion. Usually, half-an-hour discussion is listed on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays only. In one session, a member is allowed to raise not more than two half-hour discussions. During the discussion, the member, who has given notice, makes a short statement and not more than four members, who have intimated earlier and have secured one of the four places in the ballot, are permitted to ask a question each for further elucidating any matter of fact. Thereafter, the Minister concerned replies. There is no formal motion before the House nor voting.\n\n===Discussion on Matters of Urgent Public Importance===\nMembers may raise discussions on matters of urgent public importance with the permission of the Speaker. Such discussions may take place on two days in a week. No formal motion is moved in the House nor is there any voting on such a discussion.\n\n===Debate in the House===\nAfter the member who initiates discussion on an item of business has spoken, other members can speak on that item of business in such order as the Speaker may call upon them. Only one member can speak at a time and all speeches are directed to the Chair. A matter requiring the decision of the House is decided by means of a question put by the Speaker on a motion made by a member.\n\n====Division====\nA division is one of the forms in which the decision of the House is ascertained. Normally, when a motion is put to the House members for and against it indicate their opinion by saying \"Aye\" or \"No\" from their seats. The Chair goes by the voices and declares that the motion is either accepted or rejected by the House. If a member challenges the decision, the Chair orders that the lobbies be cleared. Then the division bell is rung and an entire network of bells installed in the various parts and rooms in Parliament House and Parliament House Annexe rings continuously for three and a half minutes. Members and Ministers rush to the Chamber from all sides. After the bell stops, all the doors to the Chamber are closed and nobody can enter or leave the Chamber till the division is over. Then the Chair puts the question for second time and declares whether in its opinion the \"Ayes\" or the \"Noes\", have it. If the opinion so declared is again challenged, the Chair asks the votes to be recorded by operating the Automatic Vote Recording Equipment.\n\n===Automatic Vote Recording System===\nWith the announcement of the Speaker for recording the votes, the [[Secretary-General]] of the Lok Sabha presses the button of a key board. Then a gong sounds, serving as a signal to members for casting their votes. To vote, each member present in the Chamber has to flip a switch and then operate one of the three push buttons fixed in their seat. The push switch must be kept pressed simultaneously until the gong sounds for the second time after 10 seconds. There are two indicator boards installed in the wall on either side of the Speaker's chair in the Chamber. Each vote cast by a member is flashed here. Immediately after the votes are cast, they are totalled mechanically and the details of the results are flashed on the Result Indicator Boards installed in the railings of the Speaker's and Diplomatic Galleries.\n\nDivisions are normally held with the aid of the Automatic Vote Recording Equipment. Where so directed by the Speaker in terms of relevant provision in the Rules of Procedure etc. in Lok Sabha, divisions may be held either by distribution of 'Aye'/'No' and 'Abstention' slips to members in the House or by the members recording their votes by going into the lobbies. There is an Indicator Board in the machine room showing the name of each member. The result of Division and vote cast by each member with the aid of Automatic Vote Recording Equipment appear also on this Board and immediately a photograph of the Indicator Board is taken. Later the Photograph is enlarged and the names of members who voted 'Ayes' and for 'Noes' are determined with the help of the photograph and incorporated in Lok Sabha Debates.\n\n===Publication of Debates===\nThree versions of Lok Sabha Debates are prepared: the Hindi version, the English version and the Original version. Only the Hindi and English versions are printed. The Original version, in cyclostyled form, is kept in the Parliament Library for record and reference. The Hindi version contains proceedings (all Questions asked and Answers given thereto and speeches made) in Hindi, and verbatim Hindi translation of proceedings in English or in regional languages. The English version contains proceedings in English and the English translation of the proceedings which take place in Hindi or in any regional language. The Original version, however, contains proceedings in Hindi or in English as they actually took place in the House and also the English/Hindi translation of speeches made in regional languages.\n\nIf conflicting legislation is enacted by the two Houses, a [[Joint session|joint sitting]] is held to resolve the differences. In such a session, the members of the Lok Sabha would generally prevail, since the Lok Sabha includes more than twice as many members as the [[Rajya Sabha]].\n\n== Officers of Lok Sabha==\n\n'''Speaker and Deputy Speaker'''\n\nAs per ''Article 93'' of Indian Constitution, the Lok Sabha has a [[Speaker of the Lok Sabha|Speaker]] and a [[Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha|Deputy Speaker]]. In the Lok Sabha, both presiding officers\u2014the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker- are elected from among its members by a simple majority of members present and voting in the House. No specific qualifications are prescribed for being elected Speaker; the Constitution only requires that Speaker should be a member of the House. But an understanding of the Constitution and the laws of the country and the rules of procedure and conventions of Parliament is considered a major asset for the holder of the office of the Speaker. Vacation and resignation of, and removal from, the offices of Speaker and Deputy Speaker are mentioned under Article 94 of the Constitution of India. As per ''Article 94'' of Indian Constitution, a [[Speaker of the Lok Sabha|Speaker]] or a [[Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha|Deputy Speaker]] should vacate his/her office, a) if he/she ceases to be a member of the House of the People, b) he/she resigns, or c) is removed from office by a resolution of the House passed by a majority.\n\nThe Speaker of Lok Sabha is both a member of the House and its Presiding Officer. The Speaker conducts the business in the House. He/she decides whether a bill is a money bill or not. He/she maintains discipline and decorum in the house and can punish a member for their unruly behaviour by suspending them. He/she permits the moving of various kinds of motions and resolutions like the [[motion of no confidence]], [[Adjournment debate|motion of adjournment]], [[motion of censure]] and calling attention notice as per the rules. The Speaker decides on the agenda to be taken up for discussion during the meeting. It is the Speaker of the Lok Sabha who presides over joint sittings called in the event of disagreement between the two Houses on a legislative measure. Following the 52nd Constitution amendment, the Speaker is vested with the power relating to the disqualification of a member of the Lok Sabha on grounds of defection. The Speaker makes obituary references in the House, formal references to important national and international events and the valedictory address at the conclusion of every Session of the Lok Sabha and also when the term of the House expires. Though a member of the House, the Speaker does not vote in the House except on those rare occasions when there is a tie at the end of a decision. Till date, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha has not been called upon to exercise this unique casting vote. While the office of Speaker is vacant due to absence/resignation/removal, the duties of the office are performed by the Deputy Speaker or, if the office of Deputy Speaker is also vacant, by such member of the House of the People as the President may appoint for the purpose. The Lok Sabha has also a separate non-elected Secretariat staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/Secretariat/JRC.aspx|title=Lok Sabha|publisher=Lok Sabha|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530124125/http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/Secretariat/JRC.aspx|archivedate=30 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nShri [[Ganesh Vasudev Mavalankar|G.

The said Article, which provides for a separate secretarial staff for each House of Parliament, reads as follows:- 98. Secretariat of Parliament \u2013 Each House of Parliament shall have a separate secretarial staff: Provided that nothing in this clause shall be construed as preventing the creation of posts common to both Houses of Parliament. (2) Parliament may by law regulate the recruitment and the conditions of service of persons appointed to the secretarial staff of either House of Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rss_recruitment/rssecretariat.asp|title=Secretariat- as in Constitution|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe Lok Sabha Secretariat functions under the overall guidance and control of the Speaker. The main activities of the Secretariat ''[[inter alia]]'' include the following :\n\n(i) providing secretarial assistance and support to the effective functioning of the House of the People (Lok Sabha) possible to Members of Lok Sabha; (ii) providing amenities as admissible to Members of Lok Sabha; (iii) servicing the various Parliamentary Committees; (v) preparing research and reference material and bringing out various publications; (vi) recruitment of manpower in the Lok Sabha Secretariat and attending to personnel matters; & (vii) preparing and publishing a record of the day-to-day proceedings of the Lok Sabha and bringing out such other publications, as may be required concerning the functioning of the Lok Sabha and its Committees, among other things.\n\nIn the discharge of his constitutional and statutory responsibilities, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha is assisted by the [[Secretary General of the Lok Sabha|Secretary-General]], who holds the rank equivalent to the Cabinet Secretary to the Government of India. The Secretary-General, in turn, is assisted by senior functionaries at the level of Secretary, Additional Secretary, Joint Secretary and other officers and staff of the Secretariat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Secretariat/Functioning.aspx|title=Set-up of the Secretariat|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref> Present Secretary-General of Lok Sabha is [[Snehlata Shrivastava]], [[Indian Administrative Service|IAS]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/snehlata-shrivastava-appointed-lok-sabha-secretary-general/articleshow/61838807.cms|title=New Secretary General of Lok Sabha|last=|first=|date=28 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=|newspaper=The Economic Times}}</ref>\n\n==Lok Sabha general elections==\nLok Sabha is constituted after the [[Elections in India|general election]] as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The [[Indian Councils Act 1861]] provided for a Legislative Council consisting of the members of the Executive Council and non-official members. The [[Indian Councils Act 1892]] established legislatures in each of the [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|provinces of British India]] and increased the powers of the Legislative Council.

The Constituent Assembly was divided into two for the separate nations, with each new Assembly having sovereign powers transferred to it for the respective dominion.\n\nThe Constitution of India was adopted on 26 November 1949 and came into effect on 26 January 1950, proclaiming India to be a sovereign, democratic republic. This contained the founding principles of the law of the land which would govern India in its new form, which now included all the princely states which had not ''[[Princely states of Pakistan|acceded to Pakistan]]''.\n\nAccording to ''Article 79 (Part V-The Union.)'' of the Constitution of India, the Parliament of India consists of the President of India and the two Houses of Parliament known as the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) and the House of the People (Lok Sabha).<ref>[http://india.gov.in/sites/upload_files/npi/files/coi_part_full.pdf Part V\u2014The Union.

Elections are by the people directly to the Lok Sabha and each state is divided into territorial constituencies under two provisions of the Constitution:\n# Each state \"is\" (See Note 1) allotted a number of seats in the Lok Sabha in such a manner that the ratio between that number and its population was as close to uniform as possible. This provision does not apply for states having a population of less than 6 million (60 [[lakh]]s). The number of seats per state has been frozen under the constitutional amendment of 1976.\n# Each state is divided into territorial constituencies in such a manner that the ratio between the population of each [[List of constituencies of the Lok Sabha|constituency]] and the number of seats allotted to it (in each case, one) remain the same throughout the state. This principle is upheld by the boundary reviews mentioned above.\n\nNotes:\n#The expression \"population\" while distributing seats among states refers to the population ascertained at the [[Census of India|census]] of 1971, per the Constitutional Amendment of 1976.<ref>https://www.india.gov.in/sites/upload_files/npi/files/coi_part_full.pdf article 81</ref>\n#The expression \"population\" while distributing constituencies within a state refers to the population ascertained at the [[Census of India|census]] of 2011.<ref>//www.india.gov.in/sites/upload_files/npi/files/coi_part_full.pdf article 81</ref>\n\n==Powers==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Loksabha Chamber Side View.png|thumb|'''Lok Sabha Chamber''']] -->\nThe Lok Sabha has certain powers that make it more powerful than the Rajya Sabha.\n\n* [[Motion of confidence|Motions of no confidence]] against the [[Government of India|government]] can be introduced and passed in the Lok Sabha. If passed by a majority vote, the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] and the [[Council of Ministers of India|Council of Ministers]] resign collectively. The Rajya Sabha has no power over such a motion, and hence has no real power over the executive. This is because the [[Constitution of India]] has only made the Union Council of ministers responsible to the Lok Sabha, not to the Rajya Sabha.\n*[[Money bill]]s can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, and upon being passed, are sent to the [[Rajya Sabha]], where it can be deliberated on for up to 14 days. If not rejected by the Rajya Sabha, or 14 days lapse from the introduction of the bill in the Rajya Sabha without any action by the House, or recommendations made by the [[Rajya Sabha]] are not accepted by the Lok Sabha, the bill is considered passed. The [[Economy of India|budget]] is presented in the Lok Sabha by the [[Minister of Finance (India)|Finance Minister]] in the name of the President of India.\n*In matters pertaining to non-financial (ordinary) bills, after the bill has been passed by the House where it was originally tabled (Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha), it is sent to the other house, where it may be kept for a maximum period of 6 months. If the other House rejects the bill or a period of 6 months elapses without any action by that House, or the House that originally tabled the bill does not accept the recommendations made by the members of the other house, it results in a deadlock. This is resolved by a joint session of both Houses, presided over by the speaker of the Lok Sabha and decided by a [[Plurality (voting)|simple majority]]. Though the Constitution has placed both houses on the same footing in this regard, in reality it is the Lok Sabha's opinions that mostly prevails\u2014due to its bigger numerical strength.\n*Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in initiating and passing any [[Constitution of India#Amendment|Bill for Constitutional Amendment]] (by a majority of the total membership of the House and at least two-thirds majority of the members present and voting).\n*Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in initiating and passing a motion for the [[President of India#Impeachment|impeachment of the President]] (by two-thirds of the membership of the House).\n*Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in impeachment process (initiating and passing a motion for the removal) of the judges of the Supreme Court and the state High Courts (by a majority of the membership of the House and at least two-thirds majority of the members present and voting), who then can be removed by the President of India.\n*Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in initiating and passing a resolution declaring war or national emergency (by two-thirds majority) or constitutional emergency (by simple majority) in a state.\n*If the Lok Sabha is dissolved before or after the declaration of a [[National Emergency in India|National Emergency]], the Rajya Sabha becomes the sole Parliament. It cannot be dissolved. This is a limitation on the Lok Sabha. But there is a possibility that president can exceed the term to not more than 1 year under the proclamation of emergency and the same would be lowered down to six-month if the said proclamation ceases to operate.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that the Lok Sabha is more powerful than the Rajya Sabha in almost all matters. Even in those matters in which the Constitution has placed both Houses on an equal footing, the Lok Sabha has more influence due to its greater numerical strength. This is typical of any Parliamentary democracy, with the lower House always being more powerful than the upper.\n\n==Procedure==\n\n===Procedure in the House===\nThe Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha and Directions issued by [[Speaker of the Lok Sabha|the Speaker]] from time to time there under regulate the procedure in Lok Sabha. The items of business, notice of which is received from the Ministers/ Private Members and admitted by the Speaker, are included in the daily List of Business which is printed and circulated to members in advance.\n\n=== Sessions and Time of Sittings===\nThree sessions of Lok Sabha take place in a year:\n*Budget session: February to May.\n*Monsoon session: July to September.\n*Winter session: November to mid-December.\n\nWhen in session, Lok Sabha holds its sittings usually from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. On some days the sittings are continuously held without observing lunch break and are also extended beyond 6 p.m. depending upon the business before the House. Lok Sabha does not ordinarily sit on Saturdays and Sundays and other closed holidays.\n\n===Question Hour===\nThe first hour of every sitting is called [[Question Hour]]. Asking questions in Parliament is the free and unfettered right of members, and during Question Hour they may ask questions of ministers on different aspects of administration and government policy in the national and international spheres. Every minister whose turn it is to answer to questions has to stand up and answer for his department's acts of omission or commission.\n\nQuestions are of three types\u2014Starred, Unstarred and Short Notice. A Starred Question is one to which a member desires an oral answer in the House and which is distinguished by an asterisk mark. An unstarred Question is one which is not called for oral answer in the house and on which no supplementary questions can consequently be asked. An answer to such a question is given in writing. Minimum period of notice for starred/unstarred question is 10 clear days. If the questions given notice of are admitted by the Speaker, they are listed and printed for answer on the dates allotted to the Ministries to which the subject matter of the question pertains.\n\nThe normal period of notice does not apply to short-notice questions which relate to matters of urgent public importance. However, a short-notice question may be answered only on short notice if so permitted by the Speaker and the Minister concerned is prepared to answer it at shorter notice. A short-notice question is taken up for answer immediately after the Question Hour, popularly known as Zero Hour.\n\n===Zero Hour===\nThe time immediately following the Question Hour has come to be known as \"Zero Hour\". It starts at around 12 noon (hence the name) and members can, with prior notice to the Speaker, raise issues of importance during this time. Typically, discussions on important Bills, the Budget, and other issues of national importance take place from 2 p.m. onwards.\n\n===Business after Question Hour===\nAfter the Question Hour, the House takes up miscellaneous items of work before proceeding to the main business of the day. These may consist of one or more of the following: Adjournment Motions, Questions involving breaches of Privileges, Papers to be laid on the Table, Communication of any messages from Rajya Sabha, Intimations regarding President's assent to Bills, Calling Attention Notices, Matters under Rule 377, Presentation of Reports of Parliamentary Committee, Presentation of Petitions, miscellaneous statements by Ministers, Motions regarding elections to Committees, Bills to be withdrawn or introduced.\n\n===Main Business===\nThe main business of the day may be consideration of a Bill or financial business or consideration of a resolution or a motion.\n\n====Legislative Business====\nLegislative proposals in the form of a Bill can be brought forward either by a Minister or by a private member. In the former case it is known as Government Bill and in the latter case it is known as a Private Members' Bill. Every Bill passes through three stages\u2014called three readings\u2014before it is passed. To become law it must be passed by both the Houses of Parliament, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and then assented to by the president.\n\n====Financial Business====\nThe presentation, discussion of, and voting on the annual General and Railways budgets\u2014followed by the passing of the Appropriations Bill and the Finance Bill\u2014is a long, drawn-out process that takes up a major part of the time of the House during its Budget Session every year.\n\n====Motions and Resolutions====\nAmong other kinds of business that come up before the House are resolutions and motions. Resolutions and motions may be brought forward by Government or by private members. Government may move a resolution or a motion for obtaining the sanction to a scheme or opinion of the House on an important matter of policy or on a grave situation. Similarly, a private member may move a resolution or motion in order to draw the attention of the House and of the Government to a particular problem. The last two and half hours of sitting on every Friday are generally allotted for transaction of private members' business. While private members' bills are taken up on one Friday, private members' resolutions are taken up on the succeeding Friday, and so on.\n\n=== Parliamentary Committees ===\nMost of the business of drafting a bill or amendments are initially discussed and debated in the parliamentary committees. Since the time for legislation is limited, work of all departments of the government and any special focus tasks is delegated to the committees, wherein the committees shall prepare the initial draft of the bill/amendment for the consideration by both the houses. They consist of members from both the houses.\n\nThere are primarily two kinds of parliamentary committees based on their nature:-\n* Parliament Standing Committees (PSC) \u2013 Permanent in nature, reconstituted time to time with every new election.\n** Department based\n** Others\n* Ad hoc Committees \u2013 Created for specific purpose and ceases to exist when that purpose is achieved.\n\n===Half-an-Hour Discussion===\nA Half-an-Hour Discussion can be raised on a matter of sufficient public importance which has been the subject of a recent question in Lok Sabha irrespective of the fact whether the question was answered orally or the answer was laid on the Table of the House and the answer which needs elucidation on a matter of fact. Normally not more than half an hour is allowed for such a discussion. Usually, half-an-hour discussion is listed on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays only. In one session, a member is allowed to raise not more than two half-hour discussions. During the discussion, the member, who has given notice, makes a short statement and not more than four members, who have intimated earlier and have secured one of the four places in the ballot, are permitted to ask a question each for further elucidating any matter of fact. Thereafter, the Minister concerned replies. There is no formal motion before the House nor voting.\n\n===Discussion on Matters of Urgent Public Importance===\nMembers may raise discussions on matters of urgent public importance with the permission of the Speaker. Such discussions may take place on two days in a week. No formal motion is moved in the House nor is there any voting on such a discussion.\n\n===Debate in the House===\nAfter the member who initiates discussion on an item of business has spoken, other members can speak on that item of business in such order as the Speaker may call upon them. Only one member can speak at a time and all speeches are directed to the Chair. A matter requiring the decision of the House is decided by means of a question put by the Speaker on a motion made by a member.\n\n====Division====\nA division is one of the forms in which the decision of the House is ascertained. Normally, when a motion is put to the House members for and against it indicate their opinion by saying \"Aye\" or \"No\" from their seats. The Chair goes by the voices and declares that the motion is either accepted or rejected by the House. If a member challenges the decision, the Chair orders that the lobbies be cleared. Then the division bell is rung and an entire network of bells installed in the various parts and rooms in Parliament House and Parliament House Annexe rings continuously for three and a half minutes. Members and Ministers rush to the Chamber from all sides. After the bell stops, all the doors to the Chamber are closed and nobody can enter or leave the Chamber till the division is over. Then the Chair puts the question for second time and declares whether in its opinion the \"Ayes\" or the \"Noes\", have it. If the opinion so declared is again challenged, the Chair asks the votes to be recorded by operating the Automatic Vote Recording Equipment.\n\n===Automatic Vote Recording System===\nWith the announcement of the Speaker for recording the votes, the [[Secretary-General]] of the Lok Sabha presses the button of a key board. Then a gong sounds, serving as a signal to members for casting their votes. To vote, each member present in the Chamber has to flip a switch and then operate one of the three push buttons fixed in their seat. The push switch must be kept pressed simultaneously until the gong sounds for the second time after 10 seconds. There are two indicator boards installed in the wall on either side of the Speaker's chair in the Chamber. Each vote cast by a member is flashed here. Immediately after the votes are cast, they are totalled mechanically and the details of the results are flashed on the Result Indicator Boards installed in the railings of the Speaker's and Diplomatic Galleries.\n\nDivisions are normally held with the aid of the Automatic Vote Recording Equipment. Where so directed by the Speaker in terms of relevant provision in the Rules of Procedure etc. in Lok Sabha, divisions may be held either by distribution of 'Aye'/'No' and 'Abstention' slips to members in the House or by the members recording their votes by going into the lobbies. There is an Indicator Board in the machine room showing the name of each member. The result of Division and vote cast by each member with the aid of Automatic Vote Recording Equipment appear also on this Board and immediately a photograph of the Indicator Board is taken. Later the Photograph is enlarged and the names of members who voted 'Ayes' and for 'Noes' are determined with the help of the photograph and incorporated in Lok Sabha Debates.\n\n===Publication of Debates===\nThree versions of Lok Sabha Debates are prepared: the Hindi version, the English version and the Original version. Only the Hindi and English versions are printed. The Original version, in cyclostyled form, is kept in the Parliament Library for record and reference. The Hindi version contains proceedings (all Questions asked and Answers given thereto and speeches made) in Hindi, and verbatim Hindi translation of proceedings in English or in regional languages. The English version contains proceedings in English and the English translation of the proceedings which take place in Hindi or in any regional language. The Original version, however, contains proceedings in Hindi or in English as they actually took place in the House and also the English/Hindi translation of speeches made in regional languages.\n\nIf conflicting legislation is enacted by the two Houses, a [[Joint session|joint sitting]] is held to resolve the differences. In such a session, the members of the Lok Sabha would generally prevail, since the Lok Sabha includes more than twice as many members as the [[Rajya Sabha]].\n\n== Officers of Lok Sabha==\n\n'''Speaker and Deputy Speaker'''\n\nAs per ''Article 93'' of Indian Constitution, the Lok Sabha has a [[Speaker of the Lok Sabha|Speaker]] and a [[Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha|Deputy Speaker]]. In the Lok Sabha, both presiding officers\u2014the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker- are elected from among its members by a simple majority of members present and voting in the House. No specific qualifications are prescribed for being elected Speaker; the Constitution only requires that Speaker should be a member of the House. But an understanding of the Constitution and the laws of the country and the rules of procedure and conventions of Parliament is considered a major asset for the holder of the office of the Speaker. Vacation and resignation of, and removal from, the offices of Speaker and Deputy Speaker are mentioned under Article 94 of the Constitution of India. As per ''Article 94'' of Indian Constitution, a [[Speaker of the Lok Sabha|Speaker]] or a [[Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha|Deputy Speaker]] should vacate his/her office, a) if he/she ceases to be a member of the House of the People, b) he/she resigns, or c) is removed from office by a resolution of the House passed by a majority.\n\nThe Speaker of Lok Sabha is both a member of the House and its Presiding Officer. The Speaker conducts the business in the House. He/she decides whether a bill is a money bill or not. He/she maintains discipline and decorum in the house and can punish a member for their unruly behaviour by suspending them. He/she permits the moving of various kinds of motions and resolutions like the [[motion of no confidence]], [[Adjournment debate|motion of adjournment]], [[motion of censure]] and calling attention notice as per the rules. The Speaker decides on the agenda to be taken up for discussion during the meeting. It is the Speaker of the Lok Sabha who presides over joint sittings called in the event of disagreement between the two Houses on a legislative measure. Following the 52nd Constitution amendment, the Speaker is vested with the power relating to the disqualification of a member of the Lok Sabha on grounds of defection. The Speaker makes obituary references in the House, formal references to important national and international events and the valedictory address at the conclusion of every Session of the Lok Sabha and also when the term of the House expires. Though a member of the House, the Speaker does not vote in the House except on those rare occasions when there is a tie at the end of a decision. Till date, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha has not been called upon to exercise this unique casting vote. While the office of Speaker is vacant due to absence/resignation/removal, the duties of the office are performed by the Deputy Speaker or, if the office of Deputy Speaker is also vacant, by such member of the House of the People as the President may appoint for the purpose. The Lok Sabha has also a separate non-elected Secretariat staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/Secretariat/JRC.aspx|title=Lok Sabha|publisher=Lok Sabha|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530124125/http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/Secretariat/JRC.aspx|archivedate=30 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nShri [[Ganesh Vasudev Mavalankar|G.

The syconium of ''Ficus'' species supply shelter and food for [[fig wasp]]s and the trees depend on the fig wasps for pollination.\n\n[[Frugivore]] birds disperse the seeds of banyans. The seeds are small, and because most banyans grow in [[woodland]]s, a seedling that germinates on the ground is unlikely to survive. However, many seeds fall on the branches and stems of other trees or on human edifices, and when they germinate they grow roots down toward the ground and consequently may envelop part of the host tree or edifice. For this reason banyans bear the colloquial name \"[[strangler fig]]\". A number of tropical banyan species that compete for sunlight, especially of the genus ''Ficus'', exhibit this strangling habit.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Zhou Zhekun |last2=Gilbert |first2=Michael G. |date=2003 |chapter=Moraceae |editor1=Zhengyi Wu |editor-last2=Raven |editor-first2=Peter H. |editor3=Deyuan Hong |title=Flora of China |chapter-url=http://hua.huh.harvard.edu/china/mss/volume05/Moraceae.pdf |volume=Volume 5 |pages=21\u201373 |isbn=978-1-930723-27-6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901100148/http://hua.huh.harvard.edu/china/mss/volume05/Moraceae.pdf |archive-date=1 September 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Serventy |first=Vincent |date=1984 |title=Australian Native Plants |location=Frenchs Forest, NSW |publisher=Reed |page= |isbn=978-0-7301-0020-1}}</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2017}}<ref>{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=1992 |title=Light in the Rainforest |url=http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/register/p00820ar.pdf |magazine=Tropical Topics |volume=1 |issue=5 |publisher=Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage |page=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529233702/http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/register/p00820ar.pdf |archive-date=29 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe leaves of the banyan tree are large, leathery, glossy, green, and elliptical. Like most figs, the leaf bud is covered by two large scales. As the leaf develops the scales abscise. Young leaves have an attractive reddish tinge.<ref name=\"The Lovely Plants\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thelovelyplants.com/the-banyan-tree/|title=The Banyan Tree|date=14 September 2010|website=The Lovely Plants}}</ref>\n\nOlder banyan trees are characterized by [[Aerial root|aerial prop roots]] that mature into thick, woody trunks, which can become indistinguishable from the primary trunk with age. Old trees can spread laterally by using these prop roots to grow over a wide area. In some species, the prop roots develop over a considerable area that resembles a grove of trees, with every trunk connected directly or indirectly to the primary trunk. The topology of this massive root system inspired the name of the [[Hierarchical#Degree of branching|hierarchical]] computer network operating system \"[[Banyan VINES]]\".\n\n[[File:Strangler fig inside.jpg|thumb|left|Looking upward inside a strangler fig where the host tree has rotted away, leaving a hollow, columnar fig tree]]\nIn a banyan that envelops its host tree, the mesh of roots growing around the latter eventually applies considerable pressure to and commonly kills it. Such an enveloped, dead tree eventually decomposes, so that the banyan becomes a \"columnar tree\" with a hollow, central core. In jungles, such hollows are very desirable shelters to many animals.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name was originally given to ''F. benghalensis'' and comes from India, where early travellers observed that the shade of the tree was frequented by ''Banyans'' (a corruption of Baniyas, a community of Indian traders).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yule |first1=Henry |last2=Burnell |first2=Arthur Coke |date=1903 |editor-last=Crooke |editor-first=William |title=Hobson-Jobson: A glossary of colloquial Anglo-Indian words and phrases, and of kindred terms, etymological, historical, geographical and discursive |url=https://archive.org/stream/hobsonjobsonagl02croogoog#page/n116/mode/1up |edition=New |location=London |publisher=J. Murray |page=65}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Gujarati language]], ''banya'' means \"grocer or merchant\", not \"tree\". The Portuguese picked up the word to refer specifically to Hindu merchants, and passed it along to the English as early as 1599 with the same meaning. By 1634, English writers began to tell of the banyan tree, a tree under which Hindu merchants conducted their business. The tree provided a shaded place for a village meeting or for merchants to sell their goods. Eventually, \"banyan\" became the name of the tree itself.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Classification==\nThe original banyan, ''F. benghalensis'', can grow into a giant tree covering several hectares. Over time, the name became generalized to all [[strangler fig]]s of the ''Urostigma'' subgenus.  The many banyan species include:\n* ''[[Ficus microcarpa]]'', which is native to [[Sri Lanka]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], [[Taiwan]], [[the Malay Archipelago]], [[New Guinea]], [[Australia]], [[Ryukyu Islands]] and [[New Caledonia]], is a significant invasive species elsewhere.\n* The Central American banyan (''Ficus pertusa'') is native to [[Central America]] and northern [[South America]], from southern [[Mexico]] south to [[Paraguay]].\n* The shortleaf fig (''[[Ficus citrifolia]]'') is native to southern [[Florida]], the [[Caribbean]] Islands, Central America, and South America south to Paraguay.  One theory is that the Portuguese name for ''F. citrofolia'', ''os barbados'', gave [[Barbados]] its name.\n* The Florida strangler fig (''[[Ficus aurea]]'') is also native to southern Florida and the Caribbean Islands, and distinguished from the above by its coarser leaf venation.\n* The Moreton Bay fig (''[[Ficus macrophylla]]'') and [[Port Jackson fig]] (''Ficus rubiginosa'') are other related species.\n\n==In horticulture==\n[[Image:Strangler fig kerala.jpg|right|thumb|Early stages of a strangler fig on a host tree in the [[Western Ghats]], India]]\nDue to the complex structure of the roots and extensive branching, the banyan is used as a subject specimen in [[penjing]] and [[bonsai]]. The oldest, living bonsai in [[Taiwan]] is a 240-year-old banyan tree housed in [[Tainan]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Small Is the Old Big |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2005/09/22/2003272719 |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=22 September 2005}}</ref>\n\n==In culture==\n\n===Religion and mythology===\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2019}}\n{{original research|section|date=September 2019}}}}\n[[Image:Sarkaradevi Temple Ficus Tree.jpg|thumb|right|Ficus tree in front of [[Sarkaradevi Temple]], [[Kerala]], [[India]]]]\nBanyan trees figure prominently in several Asian and Pacific religions and myths, including:\n* The banyan tree is the national tree of India. It is also called Indian or Bengal fig. This tree is considered sacred in India and can be seen near a temple or religious center. It is a big tree and gives shade to travelers in very hot summer months. An old custom offers worship to this tree.\n* In [[Hinduism]], the leaf of the banyan tree is said to be the resting place for the god [[Krishna]].\n:In the Bhagavat Gita, Krishna said, \"There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and its branches down, and the Vedic hymns are its leaves. One who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas.\" (Bg 15.1) Here the material world is described as a tree whose roots are upwards and branches are below. We have experience of a tree whose roots are upward: if one stands on the bank of a river or any reservoir of water, he can see that the trees reflected in the water are upside down. The branches go downward and the roots upward. Similarly, this material world is a reflection of the spiritual world. The material world is but a shadow of reality. In the shadow there is no reality or substantiality, but from the shadow we can understand that there is substance and reality.  \n:The banyan tree is also considered sacred and is called ''vat vriksha'' ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]] ''{{IAST|va\u1e6da v\u1e5bk\u1e63a}}'', \u0935\u091f \u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937) in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] known as: \u0c2e\u0c31\u0c4d\u0c31\u0c3f \u0c1a\u0c46\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c1f\u0c41; ''marri chettu'', in Kannada language known as: 'Alada mara' and in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] known as: '\u0b86\u0bb2 \u0bae\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bcd' ; ''ala maram''.  The god [[Shiva]] as [[Dakshinamurthy]] is nearly always depicted sitting in silence under the banyan with rishis at his feet. It is thought of as perfectly symbolizing eternal life due to its seemingly unending expansion.\n* In spoken [[Marathi language|Marathi]], the tree is known as ''vad'' (\u0935\u0921), derived from the original Sanskrit word ''{{IAST|va\u1e6da}}'' for the tree. Married Marathi women observe a fast called Vat Savitri Vrat for the well-being and long life of their husband. Tying a thread around the banyan or vat tree is an important part of the ritual.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n* In modern parlance in the Hindi language, it is known as ''\"bargad\"''( \u092c\u0930\u0917\u0926), ''\"vata vriksh\"''(\u0935\u091f \u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937), and ''\"barh\"''(\u092c\u0921\u093c).\n* In [[Buddhism]]'s [[Pali canon]], the banyan (Pali: ''nigrodha'')<ref>{{cite book |last=[[Pali Text Society]], London |date=1921\u201325 |editor-last1=Rhys Davids |editor-first1=T.

They are located near the [[Tin Hau Temple]] in [[Lam Tsuen]].\n* In many stories of [[Philippine mythology]], the banyan (locally known as ''balete'' or ''balite'') is said to be home to a variety of spirits (''[[diwata]]'' and ''[[engkanto]]'') and demon-like creatures (among the [[Visayan]]s, specifically, the ''dili ingon nato'', meaning \"those not like us\"). ''Maligno'' (evil spirits, from Spanish for 'malign') associated with it include the ''[[kapre]]'' (a giant), ''[[duwende]]'' (dwarves), and the ''[[tikbalang]]'' (a creature whose top half is a horse and whose bottom half is human).{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Children at a young age are taught never to point at a fully mature banyan tree for fear of offending the spirits that dwell within them, most especially when they are new to the place. Filipinos always uttered a respectful word or two to the spirits in the banyan tree when they are near one, walking near or around it to avoid any harm. Nearly every Filipino believes that provoking the spirits in a banyan tree can cause one great harm, illness, misfortune, untold suffering, and death.\n* In [[Guam]], the [[Chamorro people]] believe in tales of ''[[taotaomona]]'', [[duende (mythology)|''duende''s]], and other spirits.''

The syconium of ''Ficus'' species supply shelter and food for [[fig wasp]]s and the trees depend on the fig wasps for pollination.\n\n[[Frugivore]] birds disperse the seeds of banyans. The seeds are small, and because most banyans grow in [[woodland]]s, a seedling that germinates on the ground is unlikely to survive. However, many seeds fall on the branches and stems of other trees or on human edifices, and when they germinate they grow roots down toward the ground and consequently may envelop part of the host tree or edifice. For this reason banyans bear the colloquial name \"[[strangler fig]]\". A number of tropical banyan species that compete for sunlight, especially of the genus ''Ficus'', exhibit this strangling habit.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Zhou Zhekun |last2=Gilbert |first2=Michael G. |date=2003 |chapter=Moraceae |editor1=Zhengyi Wu |editor-last2=Raven |editor-first2=Peter H. |editor3=Deyuan Hong |title=Flora of China |chapter-url=http://hua.huh.harvard.edu/china/mss/volume05/Moraceae.pdf |volume=Volume 5 |pages=21\u201373 |isbn=978-1-930723-27-6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901100148/http://hua.huh.harvard.edu/china/mss/volume05/Moraceae.pdf |archive-date=1 September 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Serventy |first=Vincent |date=1984 |title=Australian Native Plants |location=Frenchs Forest, NSW |publisher=Reed |page= |isbn=978-0-7301-0020-1}}</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2017}}<ref>{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=1992 |title=Light in the Rainforest |url=http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/register/p00820ar.pdf |magazine=Tropical Topics |volume=1 |issue=5 |publisher=Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage |page=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529233702/http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/register/p00820ar.pdf |archive-date=29 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe leaves of the banyan tree are large, leathery, glossy, green, and elliptical. Like most figs, the leaf bud is covered by two large scales. As the leaf develops the scales abscise. Young leaves have an attractive reddish tinge.<ref name=\"The Lovely Plants\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thelovelyplants.com/the-banyan-tree/|title=The Banyan Tree|date=14 September 2010|website=The Lovely Plants}}</ref>\n\nOlder banyan trees are characterized by [[Aerial root|aerial prop roots]] that mature into thick, woody trunks, which can become indistinguishable from the primary trunk with age. Old trees can spread laterally by using these prop roots to grow over a wide area. In some species, the prop roots develop over a considerable area that resembles a grove of trees, with every trunk connected directly or indirectly to the primary trunk. The topology of this massive root system inspired the name of the [[Hierarchical#Degree of branching|hierarchical]] computer network operating system \"[[Banyan VINES]]\".\n\n[[File:Strangler fig inside.jpg|thumb|left|Looking upward inside a strangler fig where the host tree has rotted away, leaving a hollow, columnar fig tree]]\nIn a banyan that envelops its host tree, the mesh of roots growing around the latter eventually applies considerable pressure to and commonly kills it. Such an enveloped, dead tree eventually decomposes, so that the banyan becomes a \"columnar tree\" with a hollow, central core. In jungles, such hollows are very desirable shelters to many animals.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name was originally given to ''F. benghalensis'' and comes from India, where early travellers observed that the shade of the tree was frequented by ''Banyans'' (a corruption of Baniyas, a community of Indian traders).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yule |first1=Henry |last2=Burnell |first2=Arthur Coke |date=1903 |editor-last=Crooke |editor-first=William |title=Hobson-Jobson: A glossary of colloquial Anglo-Indian words and phrases, and of kindred terms, etymological, historical, geographical and discursive |url=https://archive.org/stream/hobsonjobsonagl02croogoog#page/n116/mode/1up |edition=New |location=London |publisher=J. Murray |page=65}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Gujarati language]], ''banya'' means \"grocer or merchant\", not \"tree\". The Portuguese picked up the word to refer specifically to Hindu merchants, and passed it along to the English as early as 1599 with the same meaning. By 1634, English writers began to tell of the banyan tree, a tree under which Hindu merchants conducted their business. The tree provided a shaded place for a village meeting or for merchants to sell their goods. Eventually, \"banyan\" became the name of the tree itself.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Classification==\nThe original banyan, ''F. benghalensis'', can grow into a giant tree covering several hectares. Over time, the name became generalized to all [[strangler fig]]s of the ''Urostigma'' subgenus.  The many banyan species include:\n* ''[[Ficus microcarpa]]'', which is native to [[Sri Lanka]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], [[Taiwan]], [[the Malay Archipelago]], [[New Guinea]], [[Australia]], [[Ryukyu Islands]] and [[New Caledonia]], is a significant invasive species elsewhere.\n* The Central American banyan (''Ficus pertusa'') is native to [[Central America]] and northern [[South America]], from southern [[Mexico]] south to [[Paraguay]].\n* The shortleaf fig (''[[Ficus citrifolia]]'') is native to southern [[Florida]], the [[Caribbean]] Islands, Central America, and South America south to Paraguay.  One theory is that the Portuguese name for ''F. citrofolia'', ''os barbados'', gave [[Barbados]] its name.\n* The Florida strangler fig (''[[Ficus aurea]]'') is also native to southern Florida and the Caribbean Islands, and distinguished from the above by its coarser leaf venation.\n* The Moreton Bay fig (''[[Ficus macrophylla]]'') and [[Port Jackson fig]] (''Ficus rubiginosa'') are other related species.\n\n==In horticulture==\n[[Image:Strangler fig kerala.jpg|right|thumb|Early stages of a strangler fig on a host tree in the [[Western Ghats]], India]]\nDue to the complex structure of the roots and extensive branching, the banyan is used as a subject specimen in [[penjing]] and [[bonsai]]. The oldest, living bonsai in [[Taiwan]] is a 240-year-old banyan tree housed in [[Tainan]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Small Is the Old Big |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2005/09/22/2003272719 |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=22 September 2005}}</ref>\n\n==In culture==\n\n===Religion and mythology===\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2019}}\n{{original research|section|date=September 2019}}}}\n[[Image:Sarkaradevi Temple Ficus Tree.jpg|thumb|right|Ficus tree in front of [[Sarkaradevi Temple]], [[Kerala]], [[India]]]]\nBanyan trees figure prominently in several Asian and Pacific religions and myths, including:\n* The banyan tree is the national tree of India. It is also called Indian or Bengal fig. This tree is considered sacred in India and can be seen near a temple or religious center. It is a big tree and gives shade to travelers in very hot summer months. An old custom offers worship to this tree.\n* In [[Hinduism]], the leaf of the banyan tree is said to be the resting place for the god [[Krishna]].\n:In the Bhagavat Gita, Krishna said, \"There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and its branches down, and the Vedic hymns are its leaves. One who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas.\" (Bg 15.1) Here the material world is described as a tree whose roots are upwards and branches are below. We have experience of a tree whose roots are upward: if one stands on the bank of a river or any reservoir of water, he can see that the trees reflected in the water are upside down. The branches go downward and the roots upward. Similarly, this material world is a reflection of the spiritual world. The material world is but a shadow of reality. In the shadow there is no reality or substantiality, but from the shadow we can understand that there is substance and reality.  \n:The banyan tree is also considered sacred and is called ''vat vriksha'' ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]] ''{{IAST|va\u1e6da v\u1e5bk\u1e63a}}'', \u0935\u091f \u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937) in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] known as: \u0c2e\u0c31\u0c4d\u0c31\u0c3f \u0c1a\u0c46\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c1f\u0c41; ''marri chettu'', in Kannada language known as: 'Alada mara' and in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] known as: '\u0b86\u0bb2 \u0bae\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bcd' ; ''ala maram''.  The god [[Shiva]] as [[Dakshinamurthy]] is nearly always depicted sitting in silence under the banyan with rishis at his feet. It is thought of as perfectly symbolizing eternal life due to its seemingly unending expansion.\n* In spoken [[Marathi language|Marathi]], the tree is known as ''vad'' (\u0935\u0921), derived from the original Sanskrit word ''{{IAST|va\u1e6da}}'' for the tree. Married Marathi women observe a fast called Vat Savitri Vrat for the well-being and long life of their husband. Tying a thread around the banyan or vat tree is an important part of the ritual.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n* In modern parlance in the Hindi language, it is known as ''\"bargad\"''( \u092c\u0930\u0917\u0926), ''\"vata vriksh\"''(\u0935\u091f \u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937), and ''\"barh\"''(\u092c\u0921\u093c).\n* In [[Buddhism]]'s [[Pali canon]], the banyan (Pali: ''nigrodha'')<ref>{{cite book |last=[[Pali Text Society]], London |date=1921\u201325 |editor-last1=Rhys Davids |editor-first1=T.

''Maligno'' (evil spirits, from Spanish for 'malign') associated with it include the ''[[kapre]]'' (a giant), ''[[duwende]]'' (dwarves), and the ''[[tikbalang]]'' (a creature whose top half is a horse and whose bottom half is human).{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Children at a young age are taught never to point at a fully mature banyan tree for fear of offending the spirits that dwell within them, most especially when they are new to the place. Filipinos always uttered a respectful word or two to the spirits in the banyan tree when they are near one, walking near or around it to avoid any harm. Nearly every Filipino believes that provoking the spirits in a banyan tree can cause one great harm, illness, misfortune, untold suffering, and death.\n* In [[Guam]], the [[Chamorro people]] believe in tales of ''[[taotaomona]]'', [[duende (mythology)|''duende''s]], and other spirits.''
