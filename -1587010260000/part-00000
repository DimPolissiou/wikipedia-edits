It is a [[third-person shooter]] with real-time [[PvP]] battles in [[Multiplayer]] Online Battle Arena ([[MOBA]]) mode. Pay to win.\nPlayers operate [[BattleTech]]-like robots on a live battlefield. They either have the option to play solo or team up with other players. It was first released on [[iOS]] in 2014 and was released to [[Android (operating system)|Android]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Priestman|first1=Chris|title=Walking War Robots brings its explosive online mecha battles to Android at last|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Walking+War+Robots/news.asp?c=67260|publisher=Pocket Gamer|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nUpon entering the battle, players will be randomly placed into one of the twelve maps available. each map has its own unique structure, length, and its own play style.\n\nMultiple game modes are available: Quick Match, Domination, Beacon Rush, Team Deathmatch, Free for All, and Skirmish, although Skirmish is only available from Thursdays to Sundays. There was also a mode called King of the Hill, but it is temporarily removed.(*There's now a new mode called Arena, which has FFA gameplay but using a special Skirmish hangar deck (limited-time robots used), and available the first time on December 2019.) War Robots runs on a matchmaking system with the size of 6 vs.6, and missing players are automatically added to the team with a special matchmaking system. Upon entering the battle, the opposing teams are spawned on opposite sides of the map. The player gets 15 seconds to choose a robot before the game, which is at most 10 minutes long, begins.\n\nCustom Matches is a mode that allows players to play with specific commanders ( friends or Clan members). This mode disables automatic matchmaking. Instead, players can play all by themselves, or with any number of players of their choice to a maximum of 6 on each side. No rewards are earned in custom games.\n\n===Titans===\nTitans are bigger and more powerful robots. Each hanger can have one Titan. They are available to all players upon reaching level 30. Every player gets a free Kid to start, and can earn or purchase platinum coins to purchase other titans, alpha and beta weapons, and upgrade the titan itself as well as its weapons. To use the titan, players need to fill up a titan bar to spawn a titan. Players is fill the bar up in various ways, such as dealing damage, destroy robots, capturing beacons, and healing. \n\n===League System===\nWar Robots has a league system implemented, and it is based on the player\u2019s trophy count (based on the player\u2019s performance in-game). If the player does a large amount of damage, captures beacons, and destroys other robots, their rating will increase; but, if the player does very little in game, their rating will decrease. It isn't necessary to win a battle for a player\u2019s rating to go up, being one of the top contributors to the losing team can earn rating points, just not gold. After a player has completed their training matches, they will start to accumulate trophies, beginning at 400, gaining hanger progress, robots, and weapons along the way.\n\nAs a player advances through each league, they will receive Gold as a reward for doing so (with the exception of the Legend League, where there is no reward for reaching the top 50). It must be noted that the League advancement rewards can be won only once, so if one drops out of a league and gets back in, he/she won't get rewarded again.\n\nLeague membership determines the contents of reward packages and periodic supply drops to pilots. Higher leagues receive more supplies and have more rewards available.  At the start of each season, or 1 month, the player will receive gold and silver after 5 \"qualifying battles\" to re-establish league placement.\n\n===Experience Level===\nAs pilots gain [[experience points]] (separate from Performance Rating), more equipment becomes available for purchase with in-game currencies such as gold, silver, and components. The clan system also becomes available in the top 10 of 100 experience levels.\n\n===Low Priority Queue===\nThe lower priority queue is a separate matchmaking tool designed for players who remain idle or leave while the battle is still in progress. There are several reasons why players may be placed in the lower priority queue. They may be placed in the lower priority queue because they constantly leave battles before and during the middle of the battles, players stay idle during the battle, and players experience too many connection problems or the game crashes too often.\n\n==Maps==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-datatable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n! style=\"width:175px;\"|Map\n! style=\"width:175px;\"|Land Type\n! style=\"width:175px;\"|Description & Features\n|-\n\n| Springfield || Farmland || A large map divided in two by a dried riverbed. One side is mostly open farmland and the other with buildings providing plenty of cover. It is a map with multiple possible spawn points. There is a dam on one side of the map and two bridges connecting the two halves of the map.\n|-\n| Yamantau || Winter || Large open-air, snowy map with many bridges, very little cover, and two large sniping platforms. The central beacon is located on an elevated platform with a good amount of cover. It is based on Mount Yamantau, a real location in the world. This map is great for long rangers but bad for knife fighters\n|-\n| Shenzhen || City || A city map with many buildings of various heights surrounding an open central plaza containing the central beacon. Long straight avenues provide lots of cover, while the large open central area provides none. It is based on a Chinese city.\n|-\n| Dead City || Small Canyons ||  A small symmetrical canyon like a map with the center beacon located in a crater. Its many buildings make it great for close range combat. It is based on a city that has been devastated by a nuclear bomb.\n|-\n| Canyon || Dust || A small, dusty map with little cover. The map gets its name from the ravine in the middle; the center beacon is on a bridge just above the ravine. Long and medium-range bots will excel on this map.\n|-\n| Powerplant || Buildings || A tightly packed map that heavily favors rocket weaponry and jumping robots. It has a unique kite-like beacon layout.\n|-\n| Moon || Space || A symmetrical map with narrow corridors favoring close combat.\n|-\n| Valley || Rocky || A symmetrical map that favors close range bots and beacon capturers. The central beacon is often hotly contested and targeted by knife fighters. The edges of the maps are good for mid-ranged robots though.\n|-\n| Dreadnought || Crashed spaceship || A slightly asymmetrical map centered around a large crashed spaceship. It was based on a crashed dreadnought from Star Wars. There are two main levels to the map - the main floor, and the roof of the ship. In addition to being asymmetrical, the map is also skewed, with the entire center of the map being at an angle. this provides for very interesting combat, and unique forms of cover. \n|-\n| Carrier || Large ship || A roughly symmetrical map with a new linear beacon arrangement.\n|-\n| Castle || Medieval castles || A map themed around medieval castles. Provide plent of cover. It is best for close range fighters due to the amount of cover available how ever some areas provide excellent grounds for snipers.\n|-\n| Rome || City || Mostly symmetrical and similar to Dreadnought and Springfield, it has areas of both large open spaces, or tight enclosed spaces. There is also a Colosseum in the center which is a popular spot for shotgun robots to hide.\n|-\n|}\n\n== Reception ==\n[[Engadget]] gave ''War Robots'' a mostly positive review, criticizing it for lacking the ability to [[Spawning (video gaming)|respawn]] (though you can now respawn with a different robot in your hanger) and for making it very difficult to purchase better robots without making [[microtransactions]], but overall stated that it was a \"fun online multiplayer zone capture game with energetic robot battles\".<ref name=Engadget>{{cite web|last1=Buchanan|first1=Jessica|title=Walking War Robots: War of the robots|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/10/09/walking-war-robots-war-of-the-robots/|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref> Android Police reviewed the work, writing \"''Walking War Robots'' isn't exactly original - it's borrowing quite a lot from the [[MechWarrior]] series, with a third-person perspective and mobile controls thrown on.

He also served as the 23rd [[List of Governors of Ohio|Governor of Ohio]], represented Ohio in the [[United States Senate]], and served as the 25th [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]]. Chase was therefore one of a few U.S. politicians who served in all three branches of the federal government. \n\nBorn in [[Cornish, New Hampshire]], Chase studied law under [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]] before establishing a legal practice in [[Cincinnati]]. He became an anti-slavery activist and frequently defended [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|fugitive slaves]] in court. Chase left the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] in 1841 to become the leader of Ohio's [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]]. In 1848, he helped establish the [[Free Soil Party]] and recruited former President [[Martin Van Buren]] to serve as the party's presidential nominee. Chase won election to the Senate the following year, and he opposed the [[Compromise of 1850]] and the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. In the aftermath of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, Chase helped establish the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], which opposed the extension of slavery into the [[territories of the United States|territories]]. After leaving the Senate, Chase served as the Governor of Ohio from 1856 to 1860.\n\nChase sought the Republican nomination for president in the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], but the party chose [[Abraham Lincoln]] at its [[1860 Republican National Convention|National Convention]]. After Lincoln won the election, he asked Chase to serve as Secretary of the Treasury. Chase served in that position from 1861 to 1864, working hard to ensure the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] was well-financed during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Chase resigned from the Cabinet in June 1864, but retained support among the [[Radical Republicans]]. Partly to appease the Radical Republicans, Lincoln nominated Chase to fill the Supreme Court vacancy that arose following [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Roger Taney]]'s death.\n\nChase served as Chief Justice from 1864 to his death in 1873.

He helped balance its idealism with his pragmatic approach and political thought. He was skillful in drafting platforms and addresses, and he prepared the national Liberty platform of 1843 and the Liberty address of 1845. Building the Liberty Party was slow going. By 1848 Chase was leader in the effort to combine the Liberty Party with the [[Barnburners and Hunkers|Barnburners]] or Van Buren Democrats of New York to form the [[Free Soil Party]].\n\n[[File:SPChase.jpg|thumb|left|Chase as [[U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]]]]\nChase drafted the Free-Soil platform,<ref>{{cite book|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party Before the Civil War|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|location=Oxford|edition=Second|page=83}}</ref> and it was chiefly through his influence that [[Martin Van Buren|Van Buren]] was their nominee for President in 1848. In 1849, Chase was elected to the U.S Senate from Ohio on the Free Soil ticket. Chase's goal, however, was not to establish a permanent new party organization, but to bring pressure to bear upon Northern Democrats to force them to oppose the extension of slavery.\n\nDuring his service in the Senate (1849\u20131855), Chase was an anti-slavery champion. He argued against the [[Compromise of&nbsp;1850]]<ref name=\"lincolnandfreedom\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mrlincolnandfreedom.org/inside.asp?ID=68&subjectID=4|accessdate=September 10, 2015|title=Salmon P.

He tried to unite the Free Soilers and the anti-slavery Democrats with the dwindling Whig Party, which led to establishment of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The \"[[Appeal of the Independent Democrats|Appeal of the Independent Democrats in Congress to the People of the United States]]\", written by Chase and Giddings, and published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on January 24, 1854, may be regarded as the earliest draft of the Republican party creed.\n\nIn 1855 he was elected governor of Ohio. Chase was the first Republican governor of Ohio, serving from 1856 to 1860, where he supported women's rights, public education, and prison reform.<ref name=ohiohis />\n\nChase sought the Republican nomination for president in 1860.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} With the exception of [[William&nbsp;H. Seward]], Chase was the most prominent Republican in the country and had done more against slavery than any other Republican. But he opposed a \"[[Protectionism|protective tariff]]\", favored by most other Republicans, and his record of collaboration with Democrats annoyed many Republicans who were former Whigs.\n\nAt the [[1860 Republican National Convention]], he got 49 votes on the first ballot,<ref name=\"Tarbell 1998\">{{cite book|last1=Tarbell|first1=Ida M.|title=The Life of Abraham Lincoln Volumes 1 & 2|date=1998|publisher=Digital Scanning Inc|isbn=978-1-58218-124-0 |page=148 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=DwSYCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA148|accessdate=2 October 2017|language=en}}</ref> but he had little support outside of Ohio. [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the nomination, and Chase supported him.\n\nChase was elected as a Republican to the U.S. Senate from Ohio in 1860. However, he resigned shortly after taking his seat in order to become [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] under Lincoln.<ref name=ohiohis /> He was also a participant in the February 1861 [[Peace Conference of 1861|Peace Conference]] in Washington, D.C., a meeting of leading American politicians held in an effort to resolve the burgeoning [[secession]] crisis and to preserve the Union on the eve of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\n== Secretary of the Treasury ==\n[[File:CHASE, Samuel P-Treasury (BEP engraved portrait).jpg|thumb|upright=.80|[[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] portrait of Chase as Secretary of the Treasury]]\n\nChase served as Secretary of the Treasury in President Lincoln's cabinet from 1861 to 1864, during the Civil War. In that period of crisis, there were two great changes in American financial policy, the establishment of a national banking system and the issue of [[paper currency]]. The former was Chase's own particular measure. He suggested the idea, worked out the important principles and many of the details, and induced the [[United States Congress|Congress]] to approve them. It not only secured an immediate market for government bonds, but also provided a permanent, uniform and stable national currency. Chase ensured that the Union could sell debt to pay for the war effort.

As the justice responsible for the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit|4th Circuit]], Chase also would have been one of two judges at the trial of [[Jefferson Davis]] (who was imprisoned at [[Fort Monroe]] in Virginia), because trial for major crimes such as [[treason]] required two judges. However, Davis' best defense would be that he forfeited U.S. citizenship upon secession, and therefore could not have committed treason. Convicting Davis could also interfere with Chase's presidential ambitions, described below. After passage of the [[14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|14th Amendment]] in 1868, Chase invited Davis' lawyer to meet with him privately, and explained his theory that Section 3 of the new Amendment prohibited imposing further punishment on former Confederates.

He also served as the 23rd [[List of Governors of Ohio|Governor of Ohio]], represented Ohio in the [[United States Senate]], and served as the 25th [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]]. Chase was therefore one of a few U.S. politicians who served in all three branches of the federal government. \n\nBorn in [[Cornish, New Hampshire]], Chase studied law under [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]] before establishing a legal practice in [[Cincinnati]]. He became an anti-slavery activist and frequently defended [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|fugitive slaves]] in court. Chase left the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] in 1841 to become the leader of Ohio's [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]]. In 1848, he helped establish the [[Free Soil Party]] and recruited former President [[Martin Van Buren]] to serve as the party's presidential nominee. Chase won election to the Senate the following year, and he opposed the [[Compromise of 1850]] and the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. In the aftermath of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, Chase helped establish the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], which opposed the extension of slavery into the [[territories of the United States|territories]]. After leaving the Senate, Chase served as the Governor of Ohio from 1856 to 1860.\n\nChase sought the Republican nomination for president in the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], but the party chose [[Abraham Lincoln]] at its [[1860 Republican National Convention|National Convention]]. After Lincoln won the election, he asked Chase to serve as Secretary of the Treasury. Chase served in that position from 1861 to 1864, working hard to ensure the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] was well-financed during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Chase resigned from the Cabinet in June 1864, but retained support among the [[Radical Republicans]]. Partly to appease the Radical Republicans, Lincoln nominated Chase to fill the Supreme Court vacancy that arose following [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Roger Taney]]'s death.\n\nChase served as Chief Justice from 1864 to his death in 1873. He presided over the Senate trial of President [[Andrew Johnson]] during the [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeachment proceedings]] of 1868. Despite his service on the court, Chase continued to pursue the presidency. He unsuccessfully sought the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential nomination in [[1868 United States presidential election|1868]] and the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican]] nomination in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]].\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n== Early years ==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Salmon P.

Van Zandt]]'' on the constitutionality of fugitive slave laws before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S.&nbsp;Supreme Court]] attracted particular attention. In this and similar cases, the court ruled against him, and the judgment against [[John Van Zandt]] was upheld. Chase contended that slavery was local, not national, and that it could exist only by virtue of positive state law. He argued that the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]] was not empowered by the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] to create slavery anywhere and that when an enslaved person leaves the jurisdiction of a state where slavery is legal, he ceases to be a slave; he continues to be a man and leaves behind the law that made him a slave.\n\nThough elected as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] to a one year term on the Cincinnati City Council in 1840,<ref>{{cite book |last=Niven |first=John |date=1995 |title=Salmon P.

He helped balance its idealism with his pragmatic approach and political thought. He was skillful in drafting platforms and addresses, and he prepared the national Liberty platform of 1843 and the Liberty address of 1845. Building the Liberty Party was slow going. By 1848 Chase was leader in the effort to combine the Liberty Party with the [[Barnburners and Hunkers|Barnburners]] or Van Buren Democrats of New York to form the [[Free Soil Party]].\n\n[[File:SPChase.jpg|thumb|left|Chase as [[U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]]]]\nChase drafted the Free-Soil platform,<ref>{{cite book|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party Before the Civil War|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|location=Oxford|edition=Second|page=83}}</ref> and it was chiefly through his influence that [[Martin Van Buren|Van Buren]] was their nominee for President in 1848. In 1849, Chase was elected to the U.S Senate from Ohio on the Free Soil ticket. Chase's goal, however, was not to establish a permanent new party organization, but to bring pressure to bear upon Northern Democrats to force them to oppose the extension of slavery.\n\nDuring his service in the Senate (1849\u20131855), Chase was an anti-slavery champion. He argued against the [[Compromise of&nbsp;1850]]<ref name=\"lincolnandfreedom\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mrlincolnandfreedom.org/inside.asp?ID=68&subjectID=4|accessdate=September 10, 2015|title=Salmon P.

He tried to unite the Free Soilers and the anti-slavery Democrats with the dwindling Whig Party, which led to establishment of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The \"[[Appeal of the Independent Democrats|Appeal of the Independent Democrats in Congress to the People of the United States]]\", written by Chase and Giddings, and published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on January 24, 1854, may be regarded as the earliest draft of the Republican party creed.\n\nIn 1855 he was elected governor of Ohio. Chase was the first Republican governor of Ohio, serving from 1856 to 1860, where he supported women's rights, public education, and prison reform.<ref name=ohiohis />\n\nChase sought the Republican nomination for president in 1860.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} With the exception of [[William&nbsp;H. Seward]], Chase was the most prominent Republican in the country and had done more against slavery than any other Republican. But he opposed a \"[[Protectionism|protective tariff]]\", favored by most other Republicans, and his record of collaboration with Democrats annoyed many Republicans who were former Whigs.\n\nAt the [[1860 Republican National Convention]], he got 49 votes on the first ballot,<ref name=\"Tarbell 1998\">{{cite book|last1=Tarbell|first1=Ida M.|title=The Life of Abraham Lincoln Volumes 1 & 2|date=1998|publisher=Digital Scanning Inc|isbn=978-1-58218-124-0 |page=148 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=DwSYCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA148|accessdate=2 October 2017|language=en}}</ref> but he had little support outside of Ohio. [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the nomination, and Chase supported him.\n\nChase was elected as a Republican to the U.S. Senate from Ohio in 1860. However, he resigned shortly after taking his seat in order to become [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] under Lincoln.<ref name=ohiohis /> He was also a participant in the February 1861 [[Peace Conference of 1861|Peace Conference]] in Washington, D.C., a meeting of leading American politicians held in an effort to resolve the burgeoning [[secession]] crisis and to preserve the Union on the eve of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\n== Secretary of the Treasury ==\n[[File:CHASE, Samuel P-Treasury (BEP engraved portrait).jpg|thumb|upright=.80|[[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] portrait of Chase as Secretary of the Treasury]]\n\nChase served as Secretary of the Treasury in President Lincoln's cabinet from 1861 to 1864, during the Civil War. In that period of crisis, there were two great changes in American financial policy, the establishment of a national banking system and the issue of [[paper currency]]. The former was Chase's own particular measure. He suggested the idea, worked out the important principles and many of the details, and induced the [[United States Congress|Congress]] to approve them. It not only secured an immediate market for government bonds, but also provided a permanent, uniform and stable national currency. Chase ensured that the Union could sell debt to pay for the war effort. He worked with [[Jay Cooke&nbsp;& Company]] to successfully manage the sale of $500 million in government war bonds (known as 5/20s) in 1862.<ref>{{cite book|last=Geisst|first=Charles R.|title=Wall Street|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|page=[https://archive.org/details/wallstreethistor00geis/page/54 54]|isbn=978-0-19-511512-3|url=https://archive.org/details/wallstreethistor00geis/page/54}}</ref>\n\n[[File:US-$1-LT-1862-Fr-16c.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.90|The first issue of $1 [[Greenback (1860s money)|notes]] in 1862 as legal tender, featuring Chase]]\n\nThe first U.S. federal currency, the greenback [[demand note]], was printed in 1861\u20131862 during Chase's tenure as Secretary of the Treasury.

As the justice responsible for the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit|4th Circuit]], Chase also would have been one of two judges at the trial of [[Jefferson Davis]] (who was imprisoned at [[Fort Monroe]] in Virginia), because trial for major crimes such as [[treason]] required two judges. However, Davis' best defense would be that he forfeited U.S. citizenship upon secession, and therefore could not have committed treason. Convicting Davis could also interfere with Chase's presidential ambitions, described below. After passage of the [[14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|14th Amendment]] in 1868, Chase invited Davis' lawyer to meet with him privately, and explained his theory that Section 3 of the new Amendment prohibited imposing further punishment on former Confederates. When Davis' lawyer repeated this argument in open court, Chase dismissed the case, over the objection of his colleague, U.S. District Judge [[John Curtiss Underwood]], and the government chose not to appeal the dismissal to U.S. Supreme Court.<ref>http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/10/chief-justice-salmon-chase-permanency-union-cynthia-nicoletti-chases-political-ambitions/</ref>\n\nChase gradually drifted back toward his old Democratic allegiance, and made an unsuccessful effort to secure the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 1868.

When emergency personnel arrived at his room at the George Washington Motor Lodge, they found that his girlfriend, Nancy Argentino, had been injured. She was transported to Allentown's Sacred Heart Medical Center, where she died shortly after of \"undetermined craniocerebral injuries.\" The coroner's report stated that Argentino, 23, died of traumatic brain injuries consistent with a moving head striking a stationary object.

Forensic pathologist Isidore Mihalakis, who performed the autopsy, wrote at the time that the case should be investigated as a homicide until proven otherwise.

The company was formed in 1899, from the merger of [[Minor C. Keith]]'s banana-trading concerns with [[Andrew W. Preston]]'s [[Boston Fruit Company]]. It flourished in the early and mid-20th century, and it came to control vast territories and transportation networks in Central America, the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and the [[Caribbean|West Indies]]. Though it competed with the [[Standard Fruit Company]] (later [[Dole Food Company]]) for dominance in the international banana trade, it maintained a virtual monopoly in certain regions, some of which came to be called [[banana republic]]s, such as Costa Rica, Honduras, and Guatemala.<ref name=\"Frederick Douglass Opie 2009\">{{cite book |last=Opie |first=Frederick Douglass |date=July 2009 |title=Black Labor Migration in Caribbean Guatemala, 1882\u20131923 |series=Florida Work in the Americas |location= |publisher=[[University of Florida Press]]}}</ref>\n\nUnited Fruit had a deep and long-lasting impact on the economic and political development of several Latin American countries. Critics often accused it of exploitative [[neocolonialism]], and described it as the archetypal example of the influence of a [[multinational corporation]] on the internal politics of the banana republics. After a period of financial decline, United Fruit was merged with [[Eli M. Black]]'s AMK in 1970, to become the '''United Brands Company'''. In 1984, [[Carl Lindner, Jr.]] transformed United Brands into the present-day [[Chiquita Brands International]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Corporate history==\n\n===Early history===\nIn 1871, U.S. railroad entrepreneur [[Henry Meiggs]] signed a contract with the government of [[Costa Rica]] to build a railroad connecting the capital city of [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]] to the port of [[Lim\u00f3n]] in the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]]. Meiggs was assisted in the project by his young nephew [[Minor C. Keith]], who took over Meiggs's business concerns in Costa Rica after his death in 1877. Keith began experimenting with the planting of bananas as a cheap source of food for his workers.<ref name=\"UFCo-HS-Keith\">{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedfruit.org/keith.htm |title=Minor Cooper Keith (1848\u20131929) |publisher=United Fruit Historical Society |year=2001 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030011947/http://www.unitedfruit.org/keith.htm |archivedate=2008-10-30 }}</ref>\n\nWhen the Costa Rican government defaulted on its payments in 1882, Keith had to borrow [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1.2 million from London banks and from private investors to continue the difficult engineering project.<ref name=\"UFCo-HS-Keith\"/> In exchange for this and for renegotiating Costa Rica's own debt, in 1884, the administration of President [[Pr\u00f3spero Fern\u00e1ndez Oreamuno]] agreed to give Keith {{convert|800000|acre|sqkm}} of tax-free land along the railroad, plus a 99-year lease on the operation of the train route. The railroad was completed in 1890, but the flow of passengers proved insufficient to finance Keith's debt. On the other hand, the sale of bananas grown in his lands and transported first by train to Lim\u00f3n, then by ship to the United States, proved very lucrative. Keith eventually came to dominate the banana trade in Central America and along the Caribbean coast of [[Colombia]].\n\n===United Fruit (1899\u20131970)===\n[[File:UFCjamaica.jpg|thumb|Banana company staff in Jamaica as part of United Fruit Company campaign to promote tourism]]\n\nIn 1899, Keith lost [[United States dollar|$]]1.5 million when Hoadley and Co., a New York City broker, went bankrupt.<ref name=\"UFCo-HS-Keith\"/> He then traveled to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], to participate in the merger of his banana trading company, [[Tropical Trading and Transport Company]], with the rival Boston Fruit Company. Boston Fruit had been established by [[Lorenzo Dow Baker]], a sailor who, in 1870, had bought his first bananas in [[Jamaica]], and by [[Andrew W. Preston]]. Preston's lawyer, [[Bradley Palmer]], had devised a scheme for the solution of the participants' cash flow problems and was in the process of implementing it. The merger formed the United Fruit Company, based in Boston, with Preston as president and Keith as vice-president. Palmer became a permanent member of the executive committee and for long periods of time the director. From a business point of view, Bradley Palmer was United Fruit. Preston brought to the partnership his plantations in the [[West Indies]], a fleet of steamships, and his market in the U.S. Northeast. Keith brought his plantations and railroads in Central America and his market in the U.S. South and Southeast. At its founding, United Fruit was capitalized at $11,230,000. The company at Palmer's direction proceeded to buy, or buy a share in, 14 competitors, assuring them of 80% of the banana import business in the United States, then their main source of income. The company catapulted into financial success. Bradley Palmer overnight became a much-sought-after expert in business law, as well as a wealthy man. He later became a consultant to presidents and an adviser to Congress.\n\n[[File:Street in Belize - British Honduras.jpg|thumb|An illustration from ''The Golden Caribbean'']]\nIn 1900, the United Fruit Company produced ''The Golden Caribbean: A Winter Visit to the Republics of Colombia, Costa Rica, Spanish Honduras, Belize and the Spanish Main - via Boston and New Orleans'' written and illustrated by Henry R. Blaney. The travel book featured landscapes and portraits of the inhabitants pertaining to the regions where the United Fruit Company possessed land.

By 1930 it had absorbed more than 20 rival firms, acquiring a capital of $215,000,000 and becoming the largest employer in Central America. In 1930, [[Sam Zemurray]] (nicknamed \"Sam the Banana Man\") sold his [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]] to United Fruit and retired from the fruit business. By then, the company held a major role in the national economies of several countries and eventually became a symbol of the exploitative export economy. This led to serious labor disputes by the Costa Rican peasants, involving more than 30 separate unions and 100,000 workers, in [[The Great Banana Strike of 1934]], one of the most significant actions of the era by [[trade unions in Costa Rica]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bUM8y5L1h8kC&pg=PA80&dq=costa+rica+history+united+fruit+company'#v=onepage&q=costa+rica+history+united+fruit+company'&f=false|title=The History of Costa Rica|first=Monica A.|last=Rankin|date=11 May 2018|publisher=ABC-CLIO|via=Google Books|isbn=9780313379444}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6GMY-KA4XAIC&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=great+banana+strike+1934#v=onepage&q=great+banana+strike+1934&f=false|title=The Costa Rica Reader: History, Culture, Politics|first1=Steven|last1=Palmer|first2=Iv\u00e1n|last2=Molina|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Duke University Press|via=Google Books|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511011420/https://books.google.com/books?id=6GMY-KA4XAIC&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=great+banana+strike+1934&source=bl&ots=_xsj4jOuiH&sig=-79xkzgESvaz34Dtu8hCS0j7WB8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiRsNbJ6b7VAhVn7oMKHR_VD9cQ6AEIODAC#v=onepage&q=great+banana+strike+1934&f=false|archivedate=11 May 2018|isbn=978-0822382812}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1930s the company owned 3.5 million acres of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala.

Black]] bought 733,000 shares of United Fruit in 1968, becoming the company's largest shareholder. In June 1970, Black merged United Fruit with his own public company, AMK (owner of meat packer [[Smithfield Foods|John Morrell]]), to create the '''United Brands Company'''. United Fruit had far less cash than Black had counted on, and Black's mismanagement led to United Brands becoming crippled with debt. The company's losses were exacerbated by [[Hurricane Fifi]] in 1974, which destroyed many banana plantations in [[Honduras]]. On February 3, 1975, Black committed suicide by jumping out of his office on the 44th floor of the [[Pan Am Building]] in New York City. Later that year, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] exposed a scheme by United Brands (dubbed [[Bananagate]]) to bribe Honduran President [[Oswaldo L\u00f3pez Arellano]] with $1.25 million, plus the promise of another $1.25 million upon the reduction of certain export taxes. Trading in United Brands stock was halted, and L\u00f3pez was ousted in a military coup.\n\n===Chiquita Brands International===\n{{Main|Chiquita Brands International}}\n\nAfter Black's suicide, [[Cincinnati]]-based [[American Financial Group]], one of billionaire [[Carl Lindner, Jr.]]'s companies, bought into United Brands. In August 1984, Lindner took control of the company and renamed it Chiquita Brands International. The headquarters was moved to Cincinnati in 1985. By 2019, the company's main offices left the United States and relocated to Switzerland.<ref>https://panjiva.com/Chiquita-Brands-International-S-A-R-L/48051016</ref><ref>http://www.fruitnet.com/eurofruit/article/178143/chiquita-officially-opens-new-europe-hq</ref><ref>https://www.chiquita.com/our-company/contact</ref>\n\nThroughout most of its history, United Fruit's main competitor was the [[Standard Fruit Company]], now the [[Dole Food Company]].\n\n==Reputation==\nThe United Fruit Company was frequently accused of bribing government officials in exchange for preferential treatment, exploiting its workers, paying little by way of taxes to the governments of the countries where it operated, and working ruthlessly to consolidate monopolies. Latin American journalists sometimes referred to the company as ''el pulpo'' (\"the octopus\"), and leftist parties in Central and South America encouraged the company's workers to strike. Criticism of the United Fruit Company became a staple of the discourse of the [[communist]] parties in several Latin American countries, where its activities were often interpreted as illustrating [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s theory of capitalist [[imperialism]]. Major left-wing writers in Latin America, such as [[Carlos Luis Fallas]] of Costa Rica, [[Ram\u00f3n Amaya Amador]] of Honduras, [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias]] and [[Augusto Monterroso]] of Guatemala, [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] of Colombia, [[Carmen Lyra]] of Costa Rica, and [[Pablo Neruda]] of Chile, denounced the company in their literature.\n\n{{Quote|''The Fruit Company, Inc. reserved for itself the most succulent, the central coast of my own land, the delicate waist of America. It rechristened its territories as the \u2019Banana Republics\u2019 and over the sleeping dead, over the restless heroes who brought about the greatness, the liberty and the flags, it established the comic opera...''|[[Pablo Neruda]]}}\n\nThe business practices of United Fruit were also frequently criticized by journalists, politicians, and artists in the United States. [[Steven van Zandt|Little Steven]] released a song in 1987 called ''Bitter Fruit'' with lyrics that referred to a hard life for a company \"far away,\" and whose accompanying video depicted orange groves worked by peasants overseen by wealthy managers. The lyrics and scenery are generic, but United Fruit (or its successor Chiquita) was reputedly the target.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qny7yFbZZS0 |title=Little Stephen&nbsp;\u2013 Bitter Fruit |publisher=YouTube |format=video |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019113640/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qny7yFbZZS0 |archivedate=October 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe integrity of [[John Foster Dulles]]' \"anti-Communist\" motives has been discredited, since Dulles and his law firm of [[Sullivan & Cromwell]] negotiated the land giveaways to the United Fruit Company in Guatemala and Honduras. John Foster Dulles' brother, [[Allen Dulles]], also did legal work for United Fruit and sat on its board of directors. Allen Dulles was the head of the CIA under Eisenhower.

It also dominated regional transportation networks through its International Railways of Central America and its Great White Fleet of steamships. In addition, UFCO branched out in 1913 by creating the Tropical Radio and Telegraph Company. UFCO's policies of acquiring tax breaks and other benefits from host governments led to it building [[enclave economy|enclave economies]] in the regions, in which a company's investment is largely self-contained for its employees and overseas investors and the benefits of the export earnings are not shared with the host country.<ref>{{cite book |last=Frasinetti |first=Antonio M |year=1978 |title=Enclave y sociedad en Honduras |location=Tegulcigalpa |publisher= |isbn= |language=Spanish |page=}}</ref>\n\nOne of the company's primary tactics for maintaining market dominance was to control the distribution of arable land. UFCO claimed that hurricanes, blight and other natural threats required them to hold extra land or reserve land. In practice, what this meant was that UFCO was able to prevent the government from distributing land to peasants who wanted a share of the banana trade. The fact that the UFCO relied so heavily on manipulating [[land use]] rights to maintain their [[market dominance]] had a number of long-term consequences for the region. For the company to maintain its unequal land holdings it often required government concessions. And this in turn meant that the company had to be politically involved in the region even though it was an American company. In fact, the heavy-handed involvement of the company in often-corrupt governments created the term \"[[banana republic]]\", which represents a servile dictatorship.<ref name=\"GREED\">{{cite news |title=Big-business greed killing the banana |author=The Independent |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=24 May 2008 |page=A19|author-link=The Independent }}</ref> The term \"Banana Republic\" was coined by American writer [[O.

The directors of United Fruit Company (UFCO) had lobbied to convince the [[Harry S.

Besides the disputed issue of Arbenz's allegiance to communism, UFCO was being threatened by the Arbenz government's agrarian reform legislation and new Labor Code.{{sfn|Schoultz|1998|p=337}} UFCO was the largest Guatemalan landowner and employer, and the Arbenz government's land reform program included the expropriation of 40% of UFCO land.{{sfn|Schoultz|1998|p=337}} U.S. officials had little proof to back their claims of a growing communist threat in Guatemala;{{sfn|Schoultz|1998|p=342}} however, the relationship between the Eisenhower administration and UFCO demonstrated the influence of corporate interest on U.S. foreign policy.{{sfn|Schoultz|1998|p=340}} [[United States Secretary of State]] [[John Foster Dulles]], an avowed opponent of communism, was also a member of the law firm, [[Sullivan and Cromwell]], which had represented United Fruit.{{sfn|Schoultz|1998|p=338}} His brother [[Allen Dulles]], director of the CIA, was a board member of United Fruit.

Estimates of the number of casualties vary from 47 to 3,000.{{clarify|date=September 2013}} The military justified this action by claiming that the strike was subversive and its organizers were Communist revolutionaries. Congressman [[Jorge Eli\u00e9cer Gait\u00e1n]] claimed that the army had acted under instructions from the United Fruit Company.

In New Orleans, Zemurray found himself strategizing with the newly exiled General Manuel Bonilla (nationalist ex-president of Honduras 1903-1907, 1912-1913) and fomented a coup d'etat against President D\u00e1vila. On Christmas Eve, December 1910, in clear opposition of the D\u00e1vila administration, [[Samuel Zemurray]], U.S. General [[Lee Christmas]], and Honduran General [[Manuel Bonilla]] boarded the yacht \"Hornet\", formerly known as the [[USS Hornet (1898)|USS ''Hornet'']] and recently purchased by Zemurry in New Orleans.

After successfully attacking the port of Trujillo, the ''Hornet'' unexpectedly encountered the U.S. gunboat [[USS Tacoma (CL-20)|''Tacoma'']], and was towed back to New Orleans. The nascent revolution continued apace, Zemurray's media contacts having spread the word in advance.<ref name = Flagler/> President D\u00e1vila was forced to step down, with [[Francisco Bertrand]] becoming interim president until General Bonilla handily won the November 1911 Honduran presidential elections.\n\nIn 1912, General Bonilla quickly granted the second railroad concession to the newly incorporated [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]] owned by Zemurray. The period of some of these exclusive railroad land concessions was up to 99 years. The first railroad concession leased the national railroad of Honduras to the Vaccaro Bros. and Co. (once [[Standard Fruit Company]] and currently [[Dole Food Company]]). Zemurray granted his concession to the Tela Railroad Company\u2014another division within his own company. Cuyamel Fruit Company's concession would also be awarded to the Tela Railroad Company. United Fruit Company (currently [[Chiquita Brands International]]) would partner with President Bonilla in the exchange of access and control of Honduran natural resources plus tax and financial incentives. In return, President Bonilla would receive cooperation, protection and a substantial amount of U.S. capital to build a progressive infrastructure in Honduras.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n===Banana multinational establishment and expansion===\nThe granting of land ownership in exchange for the railroad concession started the first official competitive market for bananas and giving birth to the [[banana republic]]. Cuyamel Fruit Company and the Vaccaro Bros. and Co. would become known as being multinational enterprises. Bringing western modernization and industrialization to the welcoming Honduran nation. All the while Honduran bureaucrats would continue to take away the indigenous communal lands to trade for capital investment contracts as well as neglect the fair rights of Honduran laborers. After the peak of the banana republic era, resistance eventually began to grown on the part of small-scale producers and production laborers, due to the exponential rate in growth of the [[wealth gap]] as well as the collusion between the profiting Honduran government officials and the U.S. fruit companies (United Fruit Co., Standard Fruit Co., Cuyamel Fruit Co.)  versus the Honduran working and poor classes.\n\nDue to the exclusivity of the land concessions and lack of official ownership documentation, Honduran producers and experienced laborers were left with two options to regain these lands\u2014''dominio util'' or ''dominio pleno. Dominio util''\u2014meaning the land was intended to be developed for the greater good of the public with a possibility of being the granted \"full private ownership\" versus ''dominio pleno'' was the immediate granting of ''full private ownership with the right to sell''.<ref name=\":13\" /> Based on the 1898 Honduran agrarian law, without being sanctioned the right their communal lands, Honduran villages and towns could only regain these lands if granted by the Honduran government or in some cases it was permitted by U.S. companies, such as United Fruit Co., to create long-term contracts with independent producers on devastatingly diseased infested districts.<ref name=\":24\">{{Cite book|title=The United Fruit Company in Latin America|last=May|first=Stacy|last2=Plaza|first2=Galo|publisher=National Planning Association|year=1958|isbn=|location=Austin, Texas|pages=84\u201394,153\u2013154, 183\u2013199}}</ref> Even once granted land concessions, many were so severely contaminated with either the Panaman, moko, or sigatoka, that it would have to reduce the acreage used and the amount produced or changed the crop being produced. Additionally, accusations were reported of the Tela Railroad Company placing intense requirements, demanding exclusivity in distribution, and unjustly denying crops produced by small-scale farmers because they were deemed \"inadequate\". Compromise was attempted between small-scale fruit producers and the multinationals enterprises, but were never reached and resulted in local resistance.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe U.S. fruit corporations were choosing rural agriculture lands in Northern Honduras, specifically using the new railroad system for their proximity to major port cities of [[Puerto Cortes]], [[Tela]], [[La Ceiba]], and [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo]] as the main access points of transport for shipments designated back to the United States and Europe. To get an understanding of the dramatic increase in amount of bananas being exported, firstly \"in the [[Atl\u00e1ntida Department|Atlantida]], the Vaccaro Brothers (Standard Fruit) oversaw the construction of 155 kilometers of railroad between 1910 and 1915...the expansion of the railroad led to a concomitant rise exports, from 2.7 million bunches in 1913 to 5.5 million in 1919.\"<ref name=\":13\" /> Standard Fruit, Cuyamel, and the United Fruit Co. combined surpassed past profit performances, \"In 1929 a record 29 million bunches left Honduran shores, a volume that exceeded the combined exports of [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Panama]].\"<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n===Social welfare programs for employees of United Fruit Company===\nU.S. food corporations, such as United Fruit established community services and facilitates for mass headquartered (production) divisions, settlements of banana plantations throughout their partnered host countries such in the Honduran cities of Puerto Cortes, [[El Progreso]], La Ceiba, [[San Pedro Sula]], Tela, and Trujillo.( Citation Needed) Because of the strong likelihood of these communities being in extremely isolated rural agricultural areas, both American and Honduran workers were offered on-site community services such as free, furnished housing (similar to barracks) for workers and their immediate family members, health care via hospitals/clinics/health units, education (2\u20136 years) for children/younger dependents/ other laborers, commissaries (grocery/retail), religious (United Fruit built on-site churches) and social activities, agricultural training at the [[Zamorano]] Pan-American Agricultural School, and cultural contributions such as the restoration of the Mayan city [[Zaculeu]] in Guatemala.<ref name=\":24\"/> Establishing these communal services and amenities would attempt to better the living conditions of laborers as well as create windows of opportunity for employment (i.e. teachers, doctors, nurses,etc.), and help lay down the foundation for the demand of national progress.\n\n====Agriculture research and training====\nSamuel Zemurray employed agronomists, botanists, and horticulturists to aid in research studies for United Fruit in their time of crisis, as early as 1915 when the [[Panama disease]] first inhabited crops. Funding specialized studies to treat Panama disease and supporting the publishing of such findings throughout the 1920s-1930s, Zemurray has consistently been an advocate for agricultural research and education. This was first observed when Zemurray funded the first research station of Lancetilla in Tela, Honduras in 1926 and led by Dr. [[Wilson Popenoe]].\n\nZemurray also founded the [[Zamorano]] Pan-American Agricultural School (Escuela Agricola Panamericana) in 1941 with Dr. Popenoe as the head [[agronomist]]. There were certain requirements before a student could be accepted into the fully paid for 3-year program including additional expenses (room and board, clothing, food, stc), a few being a male between the ages of 18-21, 6 years of elementary education, plus an additional 2 years of secondary.<ref name=\":24\"/> Zemurray, established a policy where, \"The School is not for the training or improvement of the company's own personnel, but represents an outright and disinterested contribution to the improvement of agriculture in Spanish America...This was one way in which the United Fruit Company undertook to discharge its obligation of social responsibility in those countries in which it operates-and even to help others.\"<ref name=\":24\"/> Zemurray was so intensely adamant in his policy, that students were not allowed to become employees at the United Fruit Company post graduation.\n\n===United fruit and labor challenges===\n\n====Invasive banana diseases====\nEpidemic diseases would cyclically strike the banana enterprise in the form of Panama disease, [[black sigatoka]], and Moko (''[[Ralstonia solanacearum]]''). Large investments of capital, resources, time, tactical practices, and extensive research would be necessary in search for a solution. The agriculture research facilities employed by United Fruit pioneered in the field of treatment with physical solutions such as controlling [[Panama disease]] via \"flood fallowing\" and chemical formulations such as the [[Bordeaux mixture]] spray.\n\nThese forms of treatment and control would be rigorously applied by laborers on a daily basis and for long periods of time so that they would be as effective as possible. Potentially toxic chemicals were constantly exposed to workers such as copper(II) sulfate in Bordeaux spray (which is still used intensively today in organic and \"bio\" agriculture), [[1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane]] in Nemagon the treatment for Moko, or the sigatoka control process that began a chemical spray followed by an acid wash of bananas post-harvesting. The fungicidal treatments would cause workers to inhale fungicidal dust and come into direct skin contact with the chemicals without means of decontamination until the end of their workday.<ref name=\":24\"/> These chemicals would be studied and proven to carry their own negative repercussions towards the laborers and land of these host nations.\n\nWhile the Panama disease was the first major challenging and aggressive epidemic, again United Fruit would be faced with an even more combative fungal disease, Black sigatoka, in 1935. Within a year, sigatoka plagued 80% of their Honduran crop and once again scientists would begin a search for a solution to this new epidemic.<ref name=\":24\"/> By the end of 1937 production resumed to its normal level for United Fruit after the application of Bordeaux spray, but not without creating devastating blows to the banana production. \"Between 1936-1937, the Tela Railroad Company banana output fell from 5.8 to 3.7 million bunches\" and this did not include independent farmers who also suffered from the same epidemics, \"export figures confirm the devastating effect of the pathogen on non-company growers: between 1937-1939 their exports plummeted from 1.7 million bunches to a mere 122,000 bunches\".<ref name=\":02\"/> Without any positive eradication of sigatoka from banana farms due to the tropical environment, the permanent fungicidal treatment was incorporated and promoted in every major banana enterprise, which would be reflective in the time, resources, labor, and allocation of expenses needed for rehabilitation.\n\n====Labor health risks====\nBoth United Fruit Company production laborers and their fellow railroad workers from the Tela Railroad Company were not only at constant risk from long periods of chemical exposure in the intense tropical environment, but there was a possibility of contracting malaria/ yellow fever from mosquito bites, or inhale the airborne bacteria of [[tuberculosis]] from infected victims.\n\nIn 1950, ''El Prision Verde'' (\"The Green Prison\"), written by [[Ramon Amaya Amador]], a leading member of the Honduran Communist Party, exposed the injustices of working and living conditions on banana plantations with the story of Martin Samayoa, a former Bordeaux spray applicator. This literary piece is the personal account of everyday life, as an applicator, and the experienced as well as witnessed injustices pre/post-exposure to the toxic chemicals within these fungicidal treatments and insecticides. The Bordeaux spray in particular is a blue-green color and many sources referring to its usage usually bring to light the apparent identification of those susceptible to copper toxicity based on their appearance after working. For example, ''Pericos'' (\"parakeets\") was the nickname given to spray workers in Puerto Rico because of the blue-green coloring left on their clothing after a full day of spraying.<ref name=\":02\"/> In 1969, there was only one documented case of vineyard workers being studied in Portugal as they worked with the Bordeaux spray whom all suffered similar health symptoms and biopsied to find blue-green residue within the victim's lungs.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\nLittle evidence was collected in the 1930s-1960s by either the American or Honduran officials to address these acute, chronic, and deadly effects and illnesses warranted from the chemical exposure such as tuberculosis, long-term respiratory problems, weight loss, infertility, cancer, and death. Many laborers were discouraged to voice the pain caused from physical injustices that occurred from the chemicals penetrating their skin or by inhalation from fungicide fumes in long labor-intensive hours spraying the applications.

That is until the legalization of labor unionization and organized resistance.\n\n===Resistance and reformation===\nLabor resistance, although was most progressive in the 1950s to the 1960s, there has been a consistent presence of abrasiveness towards multinational enterprises such as United Fruit. General Bonilla's choice to approve the concessions without demanding the establishment of fair labor rights and market price, nor enforce a comprise between small-scale fruit producers and the conglomerate of U.S. fruit enterprises would create the foundation in which strife would ensue from political, economic, and natural challenges.The first push for resistance began from the labor movement, leading into the Honduran government's turn towards nationalism, compliance with Honduran land and labor reformations (1954-1974)*, and the severance of U.S. multinational support in all host countries' governmental affairs (1974-1976)*.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite journal|last=Bucheli|first=Marcelo|date=July 2008|title=Business History|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libez.lib.georgiasouthern.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=12&sid=e5455883-6602-4f6d-a343-a6a825401f90@sessionmgr101|journal=Multinational Corporations, Totalitarian Regimes and Economic Nationalism: United Fruit Company in Central America, 1899-1975|volume=50|pages=433\u2013454|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> As United Fruit battles with Honduran oppositions, they also fight similar battles with the other host Central American nations, let alone their own [[Great Depression]] and the rising threat of communism.\n\n====Labor unionization====\nFrom 1900 to 1945, the power and economic hegemony allotted to the American multinational corporations by host countries was designed to bring nations such as Honduras out of foreign debt and economic turmoil all the while decreasing the expenses of production, increasing the levels of efficiency and profit, and thriving in a tariff-free economic system. However, the growing demand for bananas surpassed the supply because of challenges such as invasive fruit diseases (Panama, sigtaoka, and moko) plus human illnesses from extreme working conditions (chemical toxicity and communicable diseases).<ref name=\":24\"/>\n\nLaborers began to organize, protest, and expose the conditions in what they were suffering from at the location of their division. Small-scale fruit producers would also join the opposition to regain equality in the market economy and push for the redistribution of the taken communal lands sold to American multinational corporations. Referencing to the Honduran administrations from 1945-1954, business historian Marcelo Bucheli interpreted their acts of collusion and stated \"The dictators helped United Fruit's business by creating a system with little or no social reform, and in return United Fruit helped them remain in power\".<ref name=\":32\"/> As the rise of dictatorship flourished under [[Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino]]'s national administration (1933- 1949) and prevailed for 16 years until it was passed onto nationalist President [[Juan Manuel G\u00e1lvez]] (a former lawyer for the United Fruit Company).\n\nThe [[General Strike of 1954]] in Tela, Honduras was largest organized labor opposition against the United Fruit company. However, it did involve the laborers from United Fruit, Standard Fruit, along with industrial workers from San Pedro Sula. Honduran laborers were demanding fair pay, economic rights, checked national authority, and eradication of imperialist capitalism.<ref name=\":13\"/> The total number of protesters was estimated at greater than 40,000.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brett|first=Edward T.|date=2009|title=International Encyclopedia of Protest and Revolution|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405184649_yr2010_chunk_g9781405184649720|journal=Honduran General Strike of 1954|via=Blackwell Reference Online|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816082233/http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405184649_yr2010_chunk_g9781405184649720|archivedate=2011-08-16}}</ref> On the 69th day, an agreement was made between United Fruit and the mass of protesters leading to the end of the General Strike. Under the administration of Galvez (1949\u20131954) strides were taken to put into effect the negotiated improvements of workers rights. Honduran laborers gained the right for shorter work days, paid holidays, limited employee responsibility for injuries, the improvement of employment regulation over women and children, and the legalization of unionization. In the summer of 1954 the strike ended, yet the demand for economic nationalism and social reform was just beginning to gain even more momentum going into the 1960s\u20131970s.\n\n'''Nationalist movement'''\n\nBy legalizing unionization, the large mass of laborers were able to organize and act on the influences of nationalist movement, communist ideology, and becomes allies of the communist party As like in the neighboring nation of Cuba and the rise [[communism]] led by [[Fidel Castro]], the fight for nationalism spread to other Latin American nations and ultimately led to a regional revolution. Aid was given to these oppressed Latin American nations by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}. Americans struggled to maintain control and protect their capital investment while building tensions grew between America, the communist, and nationalist parties.\n\nThe [[1970s energy crisis]] was a period where [[petroleum]] production reached its peak, causing an inflation in price, leading to petroleum shortages, and a 10-year economic battle. Ultimately the United Fruit Company, among other multinational fruit enterprises, would attempt to recover capital lost due to the oil crisis through the Latin American nations. The United Fruit's plan for recovery would ensue by increasing taxation and reestablishing exclusivity contracts with small-scale farmers.\"The crisis forced local governments to realign themselves and follow protectionist policies\" (Bulmer-Thomas, 1987).<ref name=\":32\"/> The fight to not lose their control over Honduras and other sister host nations to communism failed, yet the nature of their relationship did change to where the national government had the higher authority and control.\n\n===End of the Honduran banana republic era===\nAt the end of the 1970s energy crisis, Honduras was under the administration of [[Oswaldo Lopez Arellano]] after he seized control from President [[Ramon Villeda Morales]]. Trying to redistribute the taken lands of Honduras, President Arellano attempted to aid the Honduran people in regaining their economic independence but was stopped by President [[Ram\u00f3n Ernesto Cruz Ucl\u00e9s]] in 1971. In 1974, the Organisation of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) was created and involved Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, and Colombia. Designed to strengthen the same nations that experienced extreme economic turmoil, the authority and control of foreign multinational companies, 1970s energy crisis, and the inflation of trade tariffs.<ref name=\":32\"/> Through nullification of the concession contracts originally granted to the U.S. multinational companies, Latin American countries were able to further their plan for progress but were met with hostility from the U.S. companies. Later in 1974, President Arellano approved a new agrarian reform granting thousands of acres of expropriated lands from the United Fruit Company back to Honduran people. The worsened relations between the U.S. and the newly affirmed powers of the Latin American countries would bring all parties into the 1974 [['Banana War]]'.\n\n==Aiding and abetting a terrorist organization==\n{{Further|United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia}}\n\nIn March 2007 Chiquita Brands pleaded guilty in a United States Federal court to aiding and abetting a terrorist organization, when it admitted to the payment of more than $1.7 million to the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia]] (AUC), a group that the United States has labeled a terrorist organization since 2001. Under a plea agreement, Chiquita Brands agreed to pay $25 million in restitution and damages to the families of victims of the AUC. The AUC had been paid to protect the company's interest in the region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0322/p99s01-duts.html |title=Colombia seeks eight in Chiquita terrorist scandal |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=2007-03-22 |accessdate=2016-01-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044354/http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0322/p99s01-duts.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to monetary payments, Chiquita has also been accused of smuggling weapons (3,000 [[AK-47]]'s) to the AUC and in assisting the AUC in smuggling drugs to Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://colombialawbiz.com/2010/07/23/chiquita-brands-part-iii-c-of-bananas-money-guns-and-drugs-what-did-chiquita-really-do/ |title=Chiquita Brands Part III-C: Of Bananas, Money, Guns, and Drugs: What Did Chiquita Really Do? |publisher=Colombia Law & Business Post |date=2007-07-23 |accessdate=2018-03-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316151938/https://colombialawbiz.com/2010/07/23/chiquita-brands-part-iii-c-of-bananas-money-guns-and-drugs-what-did-chiquita-really-do/ |archivedate=2018-03-16 }}</ref> Chiquita Brands admitted that they paid AUC operatives to silence union organizers and intimidate farmers into selling only to Chiquita. In the plea agreement, the Colombian government let Chiquita Brands keep the names of U.S Citizens who brokered this agreement with the AUC secret, in exchange for relief to 390 families.\n\nDespite calls from Colombian authorities and human rights organizations to extradite the U.S. Citizens responsible for war crimes and aiding a terrorist organization, the U.S. Department of Justice has refused to grant the request citing 'conflicts of law'. As with other high-profile cases involving wrongdoing by American companies abroad, the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Department of Justice are very careful to hand over any American citizen to be tried under another country's legal system, so for the time being Chiquita Brands International avoided a catastrophic scandal, and instead walked away with a humiliating defeat in court and eight of its employees fired.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/20/AR2007032001698.html |title=Colombia May Seek Chiquita Extraditions |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |accessdate=2016-01-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207042937/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/20/AR2007032001698.html |archivedate=2016-02-07 }}</ref>\n\n==The Great White Fleet==\n[[File:United Fruit Ad 1916.jpg|thumb|1916 advertisement for the United Fruit Company Steamship Service]]\n[[File:Map of United Fruit Company Steam Ship Routes.png|thumb|Routes of United Fruit Company steam ship service (1924)]]\n[[File:United Fruit \"Great White Fleet\" Menu 1935.jpg|thumb|Dinner menu, T.E.S.

was an American corporation that traded in tropical fruit (primarily bananas), grown on Latin American plantations, and sold in the United States and Europe. The company was formed in 1899, from the merger of [[Minor C. Keith]]'s banana-trading concerns with [[Andrew W. Preston]]'s [[Boston Fruit Company]]. It flourished in the early and mid-20th century, and it came to control vast territories and transportation networks in Central America, the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and the [[Caribbean|West Indies]]. Though it competed with the [[Standard Fruit Company]] (later [[Dole Food Company]]) for dominance in the international banana trade, it maintained a virtual monopoly in certain regions, some of which came to be called [[banana republic]]s, such as Costa Rica, Honduras, and Guatemala.<ref name=\"Frederick Douglass Opie 2009\">{{cite book |last=Opie |first=Frederick Douglass |date=July 2009 |title=Black Labor Migration in Caribbean Guatemala, 1882\u20131923 |series=Florida Work in the Americas |location= |publisher=[[University of Florida Press]]}}</ref>\n\nUnited Fruit had a deep and long-lasting impact on the economic and political development of several Latin American countries. Critics often accused it of exploitative [[neocolonialism]], and described it as the archetypal example of the influence of a [[multinational corporation]] on the internal politics of the banana republics. After a period of financial decline, United Fruit was merged with [[Eli M. Black]]'s AMK in 1970, to become the '''United Brands Company'''. In 1984, [[Carl Lindner, Jr.]] transformed United Brands into the present-day [[Chiquita Brands International]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Corporate history==\n\n===Early history===\nIn 1871, U.S. railroad entrepreneur [[Henry Meiggs]] signed a contract with the government of [[Costa Rica]] to build a railroad connecting the capital city of [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]] to the port of [[Lim\u00f3n]] in the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]]. Meiggs was assisted in the project by his young nephew [[Minor C. Keith]], who took over Meiggs's business concerns in Costa Rica after his death in 1877. Keith began experimenting with the planting of bananas as a cheap source of food for his workers.<ref name=\"UFCo-HS-Keith\">{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedfruit.org/keith.htm |title=Minor Cooper Keith (1848\u20131929) |publisher=United Fruit Historical Society |year=2001 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030011947/http://www.unitedfruit.org/keith.htm |archivedate=2008-10-30 }}</ref>\n\nWhen the Costa Rican government defaulted on its payments in 1882, Keith had to borrow [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1.2 million from London banks and from private investors to continue the difficult engineering project.<ref name=\"UFCo-HS-Keith\"/> In exchange for this and for renegotiating Costa Rica's own debt, in 1884, the administration of President [[Pr\u00f3spero Fern\u00e1ndez Oreamuno]] agreed to give Keith {{convert|800000|acre|sqkm}} of tax-free land along the railroad, plus a 99-year lease on the operation of the train route. The railroad was completed in 1890, but the flow of passengers proved insufficient to finance Keith's debt. On the other hand, the sale of bananas grown in his lands and transported first by train to Lim\u00f3n, then by ship to the United States, proved very lucrative. Keith eventually came to dominate the banana trade in Central America and along the Caribbean coast of [[Colombia]].\n\n===United Fruit (1899\u20131970)===\n[[File:UFCjamaica.jpg|thumb|Banana company staff in Jamaica as part of United Fruit Company campaign to promote tourism]]\n\nIn 1899, Keith lost [[United States dollar|$]]1.5 million when Hoadley and Co., a New York City broker, went bankrupt.<ref name=\"UFCo-HS-Keith\"/> He then traveled to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], to participate in the merger of his banana trading company, [[Tropical Trading and Transport Company]], with the rival Boston Fruit Company. Boston Fruit had been established by [[Lorenzo Dow Baker]], a sailor who, in 1870, had bought his first bananas in [[Jamaica]], and by [[Andrew W. Preston]]. Preston's lawyer, [[Bradley Palmer]], had devised a scheme for the solution of the participants' cash flow problems and was in the process of implementing it. The merger formed the United Fruit Company, based in Boston, with Preston as president and Keith as vice-president. Palmer became a permanent member of the executive committee and for long periods of time the director. From a business point of view, Bradley Palmer was United Fruit. Preston brought to the partnership his plantations in the [[West Indies]], a fleet of steamships, and his market in the U.S. Northeast. Keith brought his plantations and railroads in Central America and his market in the U.S. South and Southeast. At its founding, United Fruit was capitalized at $11,230,000. The company at Palmer's direction proceeded to buy, or buy a share in, 14 competitors, assuring them of 80% of the banana import business in the United States, then their main source of income. The company catapulted into financial success. Bradley Palmer overnight became a much-sought-after expert in business law, as well as a wealthy man. He later became a consultant to presidents and an adviser to Congress.\n\n[[File:Street in Belize - British Honduras.jpg|thumb|An illustration from ''The Golden Caribbean'']]\nIn 1900, the United Fruit Company produced ''The Golden Caribbean: A Winter Visit to the Republics of Colombia, Costa Rica, Spanish Honduras, Belize and the Spanish Main - via Boston and New Orleans'' written and illustrated by Henry R.

By 1930 it had absorbed more than 20 rival firms, acquiring a capital of $215,000,000 and becoming the largest employer in Central America. In 1930, [[Sam Zemurray]] (nicknamed \"Sam the Banana Man\") sold his [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]] to United Fruit and retired from the fruit business. By then, the company held a major role in the national economies of several countries and eventually became a symbol of the exploitative export economy. This led to serious labor disputes by the Costa Rican peasants, involving more than 30 separate unions and 100,000 workers, in [[The Great Banana Strike of 1934]], one of the most significant actions of the era by [[trade unions in Costa Rica]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bUM8y5L1h8kC&pg=PA80&dq=costa+rica+history+united+fruit+company'#v=onepage&q=costa+rica+history+united+fruit+company'&f=false|title=The History of Costa Rica|first=Monica A.|last=Rankin|date=11 May 2018|publisher=ABC-CLIO|via=Google Books|isbn=9780313379444}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6GMY-KA4XAIC&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=great+banana+strike+1934#v=onepage&q=great+banana+strike+1934&f=false|title=The Costa Rica Reader: History, Culture, Politics|first1=Steven|last1=Palmer|first2=Iv\u00e1n|last2=Molina|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Duke University Press|via=Google Books|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511011420/https://books.google.com/books?id=6GMY-KA4XAIC&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=great+banana+strike+1934&source=bl&ots=_xsj4jOuiH&sig=-79xkzgESvaz34Dtu8hCS0j7WB8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiRsNbJ6b7VAhVn7oMKHR_VD9cQ6AEIODAC#v=onepage&q=great+banana+strike+1934&f=false|archivedate=11 May 2018|isbn=978-0822382812}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1930s the company owned 3.5 million acres of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala.

Black]] bought 733,000 shares of United Fruit in 1968, becoming the company's largest shareholder. In June 1970, Black merged United Fruit with his own public company, AMK (owner of meat packer [[Smithfield Foods|John Morrell]]), to create the '''United Brands Company'''. United Fruit had far less cash than Black had counted on, and Black's mismanagement led to United Brands becoming crippled with debt. The company's losses were exacerbated by [[Hurricane Fifi]] in 1974, which destroyed many banana plantations in [[Honduras]]. On February 3, 1975, Black committed suicide by jumping out of his office on the 44th floor of the [[Pan Am Building]] in New York City. Later that year, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] exposed a scheme by United Brands (dubbed [[Bananagate]]) to bribe Honduran President [[Oswaldo L\u00f3pez Arellano]] with $1.25 million, plus the promise of another $1.25 million upon the reduction of certain export taxes. Trading in United Brands stock was halted, and L\u00f3pez was ousted in a military coup.\n\n===Chiquita Brands International===\n{{Main|Chiquita Brands International}}\n\nAfter Black's suicide, [[Cincinnati]]-based [[American Financial Group]], one of billionaire [[Carl Lindner, Jr.]]'s companies, bought into United Brands. In August 1984, Lindner took control of the company and renamed it Chiquita Brands International. The headquarters was moved to Cincinnati in 1985. By 2019, the company's main offices left the United States and relocated to Switzerland.<ref>https://panjiva.com/Chiquita-Brands-International-S-A-R-L/48051016</ref><ref>http://www.fruitnet.com/eurofruit/article/178143/chiquita-officially-opens-new-europe-hq</ref><ref>https://www.chiquita.com/our-company/contact</ref>\n\nThroughout most of its history, United Fruit's main competitor was the [[Standard Fruit Company]], now the [[Dole Food Company]].\n\n==Reputation==\nThe United Fruit Company was frequently accused of bribing government officials in exchange for preferential treatment, exploiting its workers, paying little by way of taxes to the governments of the countries where it operated, and working ruthlessly to consolidate monopolies. Latin American journalists sometimes referred to the company as ''el pulpo'' (\"the octopus\"), and leftist parties in Central and South America encouraged the company's workers to strike. Criticism of the United Fruit Company became a staple of the discourse of the [[communist]] parties in several Latin American countries, where its activities were often interpreted as illustrating [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s theory of capitalist [[imperialism]]. Major left-wing writers in Latin America, such as [[Carlos Luis Fallas]] of Costa Rica, [[Ram\u00f3n Amaya Amador]] of Honduras, [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias]] and [[Augusto Monterroso]] of Guatemala, [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] of Colombia, [[Carmen Lyra]] of Costa Rica, and [[Pablo Neruda]] of Chile, denounced the company in their literature.\n\n{{Quote|''The Fruit Company, Inc. reserved for itself the most succulent, the central coast of my own land, the delicate waist of America. It rechristened its territories as the \u2019Banana Republics\u2019 and over the sleeping dead, over the restless heroes who brought about the greatness, the liberty and the flags, it established the comic opera...''|[[Pablo Neruda]]}}\n\nThe business practices of United Fruit were also frequently criticized by journalists, politicians, and artists in the United States. [[Steven van Zandt|Little Steven]] released a song in 1987 called ''Bitter Fruit'' with lyrics that referred to a hard life for a company \"far away,\" and whose accompanying video depicted orange groves worked by peasants overseen by wealthy managers. The lyrics and scenery are generic, but United Fruit (or its successor Chiquita) was reputedly the target.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qny7yFbZZS0 |title=Little Stephen&nbsp;\u2013 Bitter Fruit |publisher=YouTube |format=video |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019113640/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qny7yFbZZS0 |archivedate=October 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe integrity of [[John Foster Dulles]]' \"anti-Communist\" motives has been discredited, since Dulles and his law firm of [[Sullivan & Cromwell]] negotiated the land giveaways to the United Fruit Company in Guatemala and Honduras.

It also dominated regional transportation networks through its International Railways of Central America and its Great White Fleet of steamships. In addition, UFCO branched out in 1913 by creating the Tropical Radio and Telegraph Company. UFCO's policies of acquiring tax breaks and other benefits from host governments led to it building [[enclave economy|enclave economies]] in the regions, in which a company's investment is largely self-contained for its employees and overseas investors and the benefits of the export earnings are not shared with the host country.<ref>{{cite book |last=Frasinetti |first=Antonio M |year=1978 |title=Enclave y sociedad en Honduras |location=Tegulcigalpa |publisher= |isbn= |language=Spanish |page=}}</ref>\n\nOne of the company's primary tactics for maintaining market dominance was to control the distribution of arable land. UFCO claimed that hurricanes, blight and other natural threats required them to hold extra land or reserve land. In practice, what this meant was that UFCO was able to prevent the government from distributing land to peasants who wanted a share of the banana trade. The fact that the UFCO relied so heavily on manipulating [[land use]] rights to maintain their [[market dominance]] had a number of long-term consequences for the region. For the company to maintain its unequal land holdings it often required government concessions. And this in turn meant that the company had to be politically involved in the region even though it was an American company. In fact, the heavy-handed involvement of the company in often-corrupt governments created the term \"[[banana republic]]\", which represents a servile dictatorship.<ref name=\"GREED\">{{cite news |title=Big-business greed killing the banana |author=The Independent |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=24 May 2008 |page=A19|author-link=The Independent }}</ref> The term \"Banana Republic\" was coined by American writer [[O.

In Central America, the Company built extensive railroads and ports and provided employment and transportation. UFCO also created numerous schools for the people who lived and worked on Company land. On the other hand, it allowed vast tracts of land under its ownership to remain uncultivated and, in Guatemala and elsewhere, it discouraged the government from building highways, which would lessen the profitable transportation monopoly of the railroads under its control.

The directors of United Fruit Company (UFCO) had lobbied to convince the [[Harry S.

Besides the disputed issue of Arbenz's allegiance to communism, UFCO was being threatened by the Arbenz government's agrarian reform legislation and new Labor Code.{{sfn|Schoultz|1998|p=337}} UFCO was the largest Guatemalan landowner and employer, and the Arbenz government's land reform program included the expropriation of 40% of UFCO land.{{sfn|Schoultz|1998|p=337}} U.S. officials had little proof to back their claims of a growing communist threat in Guatemala;{{sfn|Schoultz|1998|p=342}} however, the relationship between the Eisenhower administration and UFCO demonstrated the influence of corporate interest on U.S. foreign policy.{{sfn|Schoultz|1998|p=340}} [[United States Secretary of State]] [[John Foster Dulles]], an avowed opponent of communism, was also a member of the law firm, [[Sullivan and Cromwell]], which had represented United Fruit.{{sfn|Schoultz|1998|p=338}} His brother [[Allen Dulles]], director of the CIA, was a board member of United Fruit.

In New Orleans, Zemurray found himself strategizing with the newly exiled General Manuel Bonilla (nationalist ex-president of Honduras 1903-1907, 1912-1913) and fomented a coup d'etat against President D\u00e1vila. On Christmas Eve, December 1910, in clear opposition of the D\u00e1vila administration, [[Samuel Zemurray]], U.S. General [[Lee Christmas]], and Honduran General [[Manuel Bonilla]] boarded the yacht \"Hornet\", formerly known as the [[USS Hornet (1898)|USS ''Hornet'']] and recently purchased by Zemurry in New Orleans.

After successfully attacking the port of Trujillo, the ''Hornet'' unexpectedly encountered the U.S. gunboat [[USS Tacoma (CL-20)|''Tacoma'']], and was towed back to New Orleans.

The period of some of these exclusive railroad land concessions was up to 99 years. The first railroad concession leased the national railroad of Honduras to the Vaccaro Bros. and Co. (once [[Standard Fruit Company]] and currently [[Dole Food Company]]). Zemurray granted his concession to the Tela Railroad Company\u2014another division within his own company. Cuyamel Fruit Company's concession would also be awarded to the Tela Railroad Company. United Fruit Company (currently [[Chiquita Brands International]]) would partner with President Bonilla in the exchange of access and control of Honduran natural resources plus tax and financial incentives. In return, President Bonilla would receive cooperation, protection and a substantial amount of U.S. capital to build a progressive infrastructure in Honduras.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n===Banana multinational establishment and expansion===\nThe granting of land ownership in exchange for the railroad concession started the first official competitive market for bananas and giving birth to the [[banana republic]]. Cuyamel Fruit Company and the Vaccaro Bros. and Co. would become known as being multinational enterprises. Bringing western modernization and industrialization to the welcoming Honduran nation. All the while Honduran bureaucrats would continue to take away the indigenous communal lands to trade for capital investment contracts as well as neglect the fair rights of Honduran laborers. After the peak of the banana republic era, resistance eventually began to grown on the part of small-scale producers and production laborers, due to the exponential rate in growth of the [[wealth gap]] as well as the collusion between the profiting Honduran government officials and the U.S. fruit companies (United Fruit Co., Standard Fruit Co., Cuyamel Fruit Co.)  versus the Honduran working and poor classes.\n\nDue to the exclusivity of the land concessions and lack of official ownership documentation, Honduran producers and experienced laborers were left with two options to regain these lands\u2014''dominio util'' or ''dominio pleno. Dominio util''\u2014meaning the land was intended to be developed for the greater good of the public with a possibility of being the granted \"full private ownership\" versus ''dominio pleno'' was the immediate granting of ''full private ownership with the right to sell''.<ref name=\":13\" /> Based on the 1898 Honduran agrarian law, without being sanctioned the right their communal lands, Honduran villages and towns could only regain these lands if granted by the Honduran government or in some cases it was permitted by U.S. companies, such as United Fruit Co., to create long-term contracts with independent producers on devastatingly diseased infested districts.<ref name=\":24\">{{Cite book|title=The United Fruit Company in Latin America|last=May|first=Stacy|last2=Plaza|first2=Galo|publisher=National Planning Association|year=1958|isbn=|location=Austin, Texas|pages=84\u201394,153\u2013154, 183\u2013199}}</ref> Even once granted land concessions, many were so severely contaminated with either the Panaman, moko, or sigatoka, that it would have to reduce the acreage used and the amount produced or changed the crop being produced. Additionally, accusations were reported of the Tela Railroad Company placing intense requirements, demanding exclusivity in distribution, and unjustly denying crops produced by small-scale farmers because they were deemed \"inadequate\". Compromise was attempted between small-scale fruit producers and the multinationals enterprises, but were never reached and resulted in local resistance.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe U.S. fruit corporations were choosing rural agriculture lands in Northern Honduras, specifically using the new railroad system for their proximity to major port cities of [[Puerto Cortes]], [[Tela]], [[La Ceiba]], and [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo]] as the main access points of transport for shipments designated back to the United States and Europe. To get an understanding of the dramatic increase in amount of bananas being exported, firstly \"in the [[Atl\u00e1ntida Department|Atlantida]], the Vaccaro Brothers (Standard Fruit) oversaw the construction of 155 kilometers of railroad between 1910 and 1915...the expansion of the railroad led to a concomitant rise exports, from 2.7 million bunches in 1913 to 5.5 million in 1919.\"<ref name=\":13\" /> Standard Fruit, Cuyamel, and the United Fruit Co. combined surpassed past profit performances, \"In 1929 a record 29 million bunches left Honduran shores, a volume that exceeded the combined exports of [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Panama]].\"<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n===Social welfare programs for employees of United Fruit Company===\nU.S. food corporations, such as United Fruit established community services and facilitates for mass headquartered (production) divisions, settlements of banana plantations throughout their partnered host countries such in the Honduran cities of Puerto Cortes, [[El Progreso]], La Ceiba, [[San Pedro Sula]], Tela, and Trujillo.( Citation Needed) Because of the strong likelihood of these communities being in extremely isolated rural agricultural areas, both American and Honduran workers were offered on-site community services such as free, furnished housing (similar to barracks) for workers and their immediate family members, health care via hospitals/clinics/health units, education (2\u20136 years) for children/younger dependents/ other laborers, commissaries (grocery/retail), religious (United Fruit built on-site churches) and social activities, agricultural training at the [[Zamorano]] Pan-American Agricultural School, and cultural contributions such as the restoration of the Mayan city [[Zaculeu]] in Guatemala.<ref name=\":24\"/> Establishing these communal services and amenities would attempt to better the living conditions of laborers as well as create windows of opportunity for employment (i.e. teachers, doctors, nurses,etc.), and help lay down the foundation for the demand of national progress.\n\n====Agriculture research and training====\nSamuel Zemurray employed agronomists, botanists, and horticulturists to aid in research studies for United Fruit in their time of crisis, as early as 1915 when the [[Panama disease]] first inhabited crops. Funding specialized studies to treat Panama disease and supporting the publishing of such findings throughout the 1920s-1930s, Zemurray has consistently been an advocate for agricultural research and education. This was first observed when Zemurray funded the first research station of Lancetilla in Tela, Honduras in 1926 and led by Dr. [[Wilson Popenoe]].\n\nZemurray also founded the [[Zamorano]] Pan-American Agricultural School (Escuela Agricola Panamericana) in 1941 with Dr. Popenoe as the head [[agronomist]]. There were certain requirements before a student could be accepted into the fully paid for 3-year program including additional expenses (room and board, clothing, food, stc), a few being a male between the ages of 18-21, 6 years of elementary education, plus an additional 2 years of secondary.<ref name=\":24\"/> Zemurray, established a policy where, \"The School is not for the training or improvement of the company's own personnel, but represents an outright and disinterested contribution to the improvement of agriculture in Spanish America...This was one way in which the United Fruit Company undertook to discharge its obligation of social responsibility in those countries in which it operates-and even to help others.\"<ref name=\":24\"/> Zemurray was so intensely adamant in his policy, that students were not allowed to become employees at the United Fruit Company post graduation.\n\n===United fruit and labor challenges===\n\n====Invasive banana diseases====\nEpidemic diseases would cyclically strike the banana enterprise in the form of Panama disease, [[black sigatoka]], and Moko (''[[Ralstonia solanacearum]]''). Large investments of capital, resources, time, tactical practices, and extensive research would be necessary in search for a solution. The agriculture research facilities employed by United Fruit pioneered in the field of treatment with physical solutions such as controlling [[Panama disease]] via \"flood fallowing\" and chemical formulations such as the [[Bordeaux mixture]] spray.\n\nThese forms of treatment and control would be rigorously applied by laborers on a daily basis and for long periods of time so that they would be as effective as possible. Potentially toxic chemicals were constantly exposed to workers such as copper(II) sulfate in Bordeaux spray (which is still used intensively today in organic and \"bio\" agriculture), [[1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane]] in Nemagon the treatment for Moko, or the sigatoka control process that began a chemical spray followed by an acid wash of bananas post-harvesting. The fungicidal treatments would cause workers to inhale fungicidal dust and come into direct skin contact with the chemicals without means of decontamination until the end of their workday.<ref name=\":24\"/> These chemicals would be studied and proven to carry their own negative repercussions towards the laborers and land of these host nations.\n\nWhile the Panama disease was the first major challenging and aggressive epidemic, again United Fruit would be faced with an even more combative fungal disease, Black sigatoka, in 1935. Within a year, sigatoka plagued 80% of their Honduran crop and once again scientists would begin a search for a solution to this new epidemic.<ref name=\":24\"/> By the end of 1937 production resumed to its normal level for United Fruit after the application of Bordeaux spray, but not without creating devastating blows to the banana production. \"Between 1936-1937, the Tela Railroad Company banana output fell from 5.8 to 3.7 million bunches\" and this did not include independent farmers who also suffered from the same epidemics, \"export figures confirm the devastating effect of the pathogen on non-company growers: between 1937-1939 their exports plummeted from 1.7 million bunches to a mere 122,000 bunches\".<ref name=\":02\"/> Without any positive eradication of sigatoka from banana farms due to the tropical environment, the permanent fungicidal treatment was incorporated and promoted in every major banana enterprise, which would be reflective in the time, resources, labor, and allocation of expenses needed for rehabilitation.\n\n====Labor health risks====\nBoth United Fruit Company production laborers and their fellow railroad workers from the Tela Railroad Company were not only at constant risk from long periods of chemical exposure in the intense tropical environment, but there was a possibility of contracting malaria/ yellow fever from mosquito bites, or inhale the airborne bacteria of [[tuberculosis]] from infected victims.\n\nIn 1950, ''El Prision Verde'' (\"The Green Prison\"), written by [[Ramon Amaya Amador]], a leading member of the Honduran Communist Party, exposed the injustices of working and living conditions on banana plantations with the story of Martin Samayoa, a former Bordeaux spray applicator. This literary piece is the personal account of everyday life, as an applicator, and the experienced as well as witnessed injustices pre/post-exposure to the toxic chemicals within these fungicidal treatments and insecticides. The Bordeaux spray in particular is a blue-green color and many sources referring to its usage usually bring to light the apparent identification of those susceptible to copper toxicity based on their appearance after working. For example, ''Pericos'' (\"parakeets\") was the nickname given to spray workers in Puerto Rico because of the blue-green coloring left on their clothing after a full day of spraying.<ref name=\":02\"/> In 1969, there was only one documented case of vineyard workers being studied in Portugal as they worked with the Bordeaux spray whom all suffered similar health symptoms and biopsied to find blue-green residue within the victim's lungs.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\nLittle evidence was collected in the 1930s-1960s by either the American or Honduran officials to address these acute, chronic, and deadly effects and illnesses warranted from the chemical exposure such as tuberculosis, long-term respiratory problems, weight loss, infertility, cancer, and death. Many laborers were discouraged to voice the pain caused from physical injustices that occurred from the chemicals penetrating their skin or by inhalation from fungicide fumes in long labor-intensive hours spraying the applications.

That is until the legalization of labor unionization and organized resistance.\n\n===Resistance and reformation===\nLabor resistance, although was most progressive in the 1950s to the 1960s, there has been a consistent presence of abrasiveness towards multinational enterprises such as United Fruit. General Bonilla's choice to approve the concessions without demanding the establishment of fair labor rights and market price, nor enforce a comprise between small-scale fruit producers and the conglomerate of U.S. fruit enterprises would create the foundation in which strife would ensue from political, economic, and natural challenges.The first push for resistance began from the labor movement, leading into the Honduran government's turn towards nationalism, compliance with Honduran land and labor reformations (1954-1974)*, and the severance of U.S. multinational support in all host countries' governmental affairs (1974-1976)*.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite journal|last=Bucheli|first=Marcelo|date=July 2008|title=Business History|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libez.lib.georgiasouthern.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=12&sid=e5455883-6602-4f6d-a343-a6a825401f90@sessionmgr101|journal=Multinational Corporations, Totalitarian Regimes and Economic Nationalism: United Fruit Company in Central America, 1899-1975|volume=50|pages=433\u2013454|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> As United Fruit battles with Honduran oppositions, they also fight similar battles with the other host Central American nations, let alone their own [[Great Depression]] and the rising threat of communism.\n\n====Labor unionization====\nFrom 1900 to 1945, the power and economic hegemony allotted to the American multinational corporations by host countries was designed to bring nations such as Honduras out of foreign debt and economic turmoil all the while decreasing the expenses of production, increasing the levels of efficiency and profit, and thriving in a tariff-free economic system. However, the growing demand for bananas surpassed the supply because of challenges such as invasive fruit diseases (Panama, sigtaoka, and moko) plus human illnesses from extreme working conditions (chemical toxicity and communicable diseases).<ref name=\":24\"/>\n\nLaborers began to organize, protest, and expose the conditions in what they were suffering from at the location of their division. Small-scale fruit producers would also join the opposition to regain equality in the market economy and push for the redistribution of the taken communal lands sold to American multinational corporations. Referencing to the Honduran administrations from 1945-1954, yhe scholar Marcelo Bucheli interpreted their acts of collusion and stated \"The dictators helped United Fruit's business by creating a system with little or no social reform, and in return United Fruit helped them remain in power\".<ref name=\":32\"/> As the rise of dictatorship flourished under [[Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino]]'s national administration (1933- 1949) and prevailed for 16 years until it was passed onto nationalist President [[Juan Manuel G\u00e1lvez]] (a former lawyer for the United Fruit Company).\n\nThe [[General Strike of 1954]] in Tela, Honduras was largest organized labor opposition against the United Fruit company. However, it did involve the laborers from United Fruit, Standard Fruit, along with industrial workers from San Pedro Sula. Honduran laborers were demanding fair pay, economic rights, checked national authority, and eradication of imperialist capitalism.<ref name=\":13\"/> The total number of protesters was estimated at greater than 40,000.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brett|first=Edward T.|date=2009|title=International Encyclopedia of Protest and Revolution|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405184649_yr2010_chunk_g9781405184649720|journal=Honduran General Strike of 1954|via=Blackwell Reference Online|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816082233/http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405184649_yr2010_chunk_g9781405184649720|archivedate=2011-08-16}}</ref> On the 69th day, an agreement was made between United Fruit and the mass of protesters leading to the end of the General Strike. Under the administration of Galvez (1949\u20131954) strides were taken to put into effect the negotiated improvements of workers rights. Honduran laborers gained the right for shorter work days, paid holidays, limited employee responsibility for injuries, the improvement of employment regulation over women and children, and the legalization of unionization. In the summer of 1954 the strike ended, yet the demand for economic nationalism and social reform was just beginning to gain even more momentum going into the 1960s\u20131970s.\n\n'''Nationalist movement'''\n\nBy legalizing unionization, the large mass of laborers were able to organize and act on the influences of nationalist movement, communist ideology, and becomes allies of the communist party As like in the neighboring nation of Cuba and the rise [[communism]] led by [[Fidel Castro]], the fight for nationalism spread to other Latin American nations and ultimately led to a regional revolution. Aid was given to these oppressed Latin American nations by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}. Americans struggled to maintain control and protect their capital investment while building tensions grew between America, the communist, and nationalist parties.\n\nThe [[1970s energy crisis]] was a period where [[petroleum]] production reached its peak, causing an inflation in price, leading to petroleum shortages, and a 10-year economic battle. Ultimately the United Fruit Company, among other multinational fruit enterprises, would attempt to recover capital lost due to the oil crisis through the Latin American nations. The United Fruit's plan for recovery would ensue by increasing taxation and reestablishing exclusivity contracts with small-scale farmers.\"The crisis forced local governments to realign themselves and follow protectionist policies\" (Bulmer-Thomas, 1987).<ref name=\":32\"/> The fight to not lose their control over Honduras and other sister host nations to communism failed, yet the nature of their relationship did change to where the national government had the higher authority and control.\n\n===End of the Honduran banana republic era===\nAt the end of the 1970s energy crisis, Honduras was under the administration of [[Oswaldo Lopez Arellano]] after he seized control from President [[Ramon Villeda Morales]]. Trying to redistribute the taken lands of Honduras, President Arellano attempted to aid the Honduran people in regaining their economic independence but was stopped by President [[Ram\u00f3n Ernesto Cruz Ucl\u00e9s]] in 1971. In 1974, the Organisation of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) was created and involved Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, and Colombia. Designed to strengthen the same nations that experienced extreme economic turmoil, the authority and control of foreign multinational companies, 1970s energy crisis, and the inflation of trade tariffs.<ref name=\":32\"/> Through nullification of the concession contracts originally granted to the U.S. multinational companies, Latin American countries were able to further their plan for progress but were met with hostility from the U.S. companies. Later in 1974, President Arellano approved a new agrarian reform granting thousands of acres of expropriated lands from the United Fruit Company back to Honduran people. The worsened relations between the U.S. and the newly affirmed powers of the Latin American countries would bring all parties into the 1974 [['Banana War]]'.\n\n==Aiding and abetting a terrorist organization==\n{{Further|United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia}}\n\nIn March 2007 Chiquita Brands pleaded guilty in a United States Federal court to aiding and abetting a terrorist organization, when it admitted to the payment of more than $1.7 million to the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia]] (AUC), a group that the United States has labeled a terrorist organization since 2001. Under a plea agreement, Chiquita Brands agreed to pay $25 million in restitution and damages to the families of victims of the AUC. The AUC had been paid to protect the company's interest in the region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0322/p99s01-duts.html |title=Colombia seeks eight in Chiquita terrorist scandal |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=2007-03-22 |accessdate=2016-01-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044354/http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0322/p99s01-duts.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to monetary payments, Chiquita has also been accused of smuggling weapons (3,000 [[AK-47]]'s) to the AUC and in assisting the AUC in smuggling drugs to Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://colombialawbiz.com/2010/07/23/chiquita-brands-part-iii-c-of-bananas-money-guns-and-drugs-what-did-chiquita-really-do/ |title=Chiquita Brands Part III-C: Of Bananas, Money, Guns, and Drugs: What Did Chiquita Really Do? |publisher=Colombia Law & Business Post |date=2007-07-23 |accessdate=2018-03-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316151938/https://colombialawbiz.com/2010/07/23/chiquita-brands-part-iii-c-of-bananas-money-guns-and-drugs-what-did-chiquita-really-do/ |archivedate=2018-03-16 }}</ref> Chiquita Brands admitted that they paid AUC operatives to silence union organizers and intimidate farmers into selling only to Chiquita. In the plea agreement, the Colombian government let Chiquita Brands keep the names of U.S Citizens who brokered this agreement with the AUC secret, in exchange for relief to 390 families.\n\nDespite calls from Colombian authorities and human rights organizations to extradite the U.S. Citizens responsible for war crimes and aiding a terrorist organization, the U.S. Department of Justice has refused to grant the request citing 'conflicts of law'. As with other high-profile cases involving wrongdoing by American companies abroad, the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Department of Justice are very careful to hand over any American citizen to be tried under another country's legal system, so for the time being Chiquita Brands International avoided a catastrophic scandal, and instead walked away with a humiliating defeat in court and eight of its employees fired.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/20/AR2007032001698.html |title=Colombia May Seek Chiquita Extraditions |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |accessdate=2016-01-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207042937/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/20/AR2007032001698.html |archivedate=2016-02-07 }}</ref>\n\n==The Great White Fleet==\n[[File:United Fruit Ad 1916.jpg|thumb|1916 advertisement for the United Fruit Company Steamship Service]]\n[[File:Map of United Fruit Company Steam Ship Routes.png|thumb|Routes of United Fruit Company steam ship service (1924)]]\n[[File:United Fruit \"Great White Fleet\" Menu 1935.jpg|thumb|Dinner menu, T.E.S.

An early Huguenot settler, in 1707, described the unusual group behaviour of these animals:\n\n''\"There's one thing very odd among them; they always place sentinels, at some distance from the troop at the four corners of the camp, to which the sentinels turn their backs, and look with their eyes, as if they were on watch. This we have always observed of them; and this mystery seems the more difficult to be comprehended, for that these creatures are incapable to defend themselves...\"'' (Leguat, 1707)<ref>Leguat de la Foug\u00e8re, Fran\u00e7ois (1707-8).

(in French).</ref>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\nIt has subsequently been discovered that the browsing herds of giant tortoises filled an essential role in the ecosystem of Rodrigues and the regeneration of its forests. Among other roles, the giant tortoises ensured the dispersal and germination of tree seeds, as well as \"terraforming\" the island by maintaining forest clearings and pools.\n\nIn recognition of this fact, measures have been undertaken to introduce replacement species, in the form of similar giant tortoises from other parts of the world, to assist in the rebuilding of Rodrigues' devastated environment. The replacement species for the saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise was chosen to be the [[Aldabra giant tortoise]] (''Aldabrachelys gigantea'') of the Seychelles, which is roughly similar in size, though very different in body form.<ref>Cheke A, Hume J (2008). ''Lost Land of the Dodo: An Ecological History of Mauritius, R\u00e9union & Rodrigues''. London: T & AD Poyser.</ref>\n\n==Extinction==\n[[File:Cylindraspis vosmaeri.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of a moving herd of ''Cylindraspis vosmaeri'' on Rodrigues]] \nAt the time of the arrival of human settlers, dense giant tortoise herds of many thousands were reported on Rodrigues.  Typically for isolated island species, they were reported to have been friendly, curious, and unafraid of humans.\n\nHowever, in the ensuing years, massive harvesting and exporting for food and the introduction of invasive species rapidly exterminated the giant tortoises. Tentative conservation efforts began in the 18th century, with the French Governor Mah\u00e9 de Labourdonnais attempting to legislate against the \"tortoise plundering\" of Rodrigues. However, the wholesale slaughter continued. Hundreds of thousands were loaded into ships' holds for food, or to be transported to Mauritius where they were burnt for fat and oil. Due to their unusually thin shells, many died from crushing as they were densely stacked in the holds of ships.\n\nIn the final years, only smaller specimens were found, lingering in isolated mountainous refuges inland. A surviving giant tortoise was reported on the island in 1795, found at the bottom of a ravine. As late as 1802, there is a mention of survivors reportedly being killed in the large fires used to clear the island's vegetation for agriculture, but it is not clear which one of the two Rodrigues species these were, and which one survived the longest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/speciesinfo/rodriguestortoise.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180446/http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/speciesinfo/rodriguestortoise.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* World Conservation Monitoring Centre 1996.

An early Huguenot settler, in 1707, described the unusual group behaviour of these animals:\n\n''\"There's one thing very odd among them; they always place sentinels, at some distance from the troop at the four corners of the camp, to which the sentinels turn their backs, and look with their eyes, as if they were on watch. This we have always observed of them; and this mystery seems the more difficult to be comprehended, for that these creatures are incapable to defend themselves...\"'' (Leguat, 1707)<ref>Leguat de la Foug\u00e8re, Fran\u00e7ois (1707-8).

(in French).</ref>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\nIt has subsequently been discovered that the browsing herds of giant tortoises filled an essential role in the ecosystem of Rodrigues and the regeneration of its forests. Among other roles, the giant tortoises ensured the dispersal and germination of tree seeds, as well as \"terraforming\" the island by maintaining forest clearings and pools.\n\nIn recognition of this fact, measures have been undertaken to introduce replacement species, in the form of similar giant tortoises from other parts of the world, to assist in the rebuilding of Rodrigues' devastated environment. The replacement species for the saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise was chosen to be the [[Aldabra giant tortoise]] (''Aldabrachelys gigantea'') of the Seychelles, which is roughly similar in size, though very different in body form.<ref>Cheke A, Hume J (2008).

London: T & AD Poyser.</ref>\n\n==Extinction==\n[[File:Cylindraspis vosmaeri.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of a moving herd of ''Cylindraspis vosmaeri'' on Rodrigues]] \nAt the time of the arrival of human settlers, dense giant tortoise herds of many thousands were reported on Rodrigues.  Typically for isolated island species, they were reported to have been friendly, curious, and unafraid of humans.\n\nHowever, in the ensuing years, massive harvesting and exporting for food and the introduction of invasive species rapidly exterminated the giant tortoises. Tentative conservation efforts began in the 18th century, with the French Governor Mah\u00e9 de Labourdonnais attempting to legislate against the \"tortoise plundering\" of Rodrigues. However, the wholesale slaughter continued. Hundreds of thousands were loaded into ships' holds for food, or to be transported to Mauritius where they were burnt for fat and oil. Due to their unusually thin shells, many died from crushing as they were densely stacked in the holds of ships.\n\nIn the final years, only smaller specimens were found, lingering in isolated mountainous refuges inland. A surviving giant tortoise was reported on the island in 1795, found at the bottom of a ravine. As late as 1802, there is a mention of survivors reportedly being killed in the large fires used to clear the island's vegetation for agriculture, but it is not clear which one of the two Rodrigues species these were, and which one survived the longest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/speciesinfo/rodriguestortoise.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180446/http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/speciesinfo/rodriguestortoise.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* World Conservation Monitoring Centre 1996.

[[Raphael Holinshed|Holinshed]], deriving his information from the work of [[Hector Boece]], asserted that [[Banquo]], [[Thegn|Thane]] of [[Lochaber]], was the ancestor of the Stewarts.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/chroniclesofengl05holiuoft#page/264/mode/2up Holinshed, Volume 5, p. 265]</ref> Distorting the role of Banquo, who is presented by Holinshed as Macbeth's chief accomplice in regicide,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/chroniclesofengl05holiuoft#page/268/mode/2up Holished, Volume 5, p. 269]</ref> [[William Shakespeare]] presented him flatteringly in [[Macbeth]] as a martyred ancestor of [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland and I of England]]. These legends, accepted as history, became part of the foundation narrative of the Stewarts and forced later writers to trace the Stewart ancestry through [[Fleance]], Banquo's son. David Symson, the [[Historiographer Royal (Scotland)|Historiographer Royal of Scotland]], in a work dedicated to [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], followed the chroniclers in having Fleance marry a daughter of the Welsh ruler [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]],<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/anhistoricaland00symsgoog#page/n42/mode/2up Sym, p.16-7]</ref> and then introduced [[Walter fitz Alan|Walter]] as his son<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/anhistoricaland00symsgoog#page/n44/mode/2up Sym, p.18]</ref> and [[Alan fitz Walter, 2nd High Steward of Scotland]] as his grandson.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/anhistoricaland00symsgoog#page/n48/mode/2up Sym, p.22-3]</ref> However, this greatly distorted the chronology, forcing Symson to transpose Alan fitz Walter, actually born around 1140, to about 1073. This created a gap in the record, which was filled by multiplying the Alans and Walters in the Stewart line.\n\n[[David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes]], in his ''Annals of Scotland'', published in the 1770s, went some way to establish a convincing chronology for Walter fitz Alan, who, he asserted, belonged to the reign of [[David I of Scotland]] (1124\u201353) and his successor, [[Malcolm IV of Scotland|Malcolm IV]]. Moreover, he was the first of the Stewarts: there was none in the reign of [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm III]] (1058\u201393), as Symson had been forced to maintain.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/annalsscotlandf00dalrgoog#page/n66/mode/2up Dalrymple, p. 57]</ref> He went on to demolish the legendary background to the Stewarts, which he described as \"flattering and ignorant fictions\". He showed that there was a need to distinguish the various Alans who were connected with the Stewart line, something he was unembarrassed to be unable to do:\n\n{{quote|Some of my readers may demand, \"Who then was Alan the father of Walter, Stewart of Scotland in the reign of Malcolm IV?\" ... In the reign of David I, before the middle of the twelfth century, the family of the Stewarts was opulent and powerful. It may, therefore, have subsisted for many ages previous to that time; but when, and what was its commencement, we cannot determine.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/annalsscotlandf00dalrgoog#page/n62/mode/2up Dalrymple, p. 53-4]</ref>}}\n\n[[Andrew Stuart (1725\u20131801)|Andrew Stuart]], a notable Scottish MP, accepted Dalrymple's critical work on the legendary ancestors, although he included among these a [[crusades|crusader]] Alan who was subsequently to emerge as genuine.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/genealogicalhist00stua#page/n33/mode/2up Stuart, p. 1-2]</ref> He sought to establish a definite chronological framework, placing Walter fitz Alan's death in 1177.\n\nNot until the first decade of the 19th century did [[George Chalmers (antiquarian)|George Chalmers]] definitely prove that Walter fitz Alan, an acknowledged link in the Stewart ancestry, came from [[Shropshire]] and was actually the son of Alan fitz Flaad. This finally established Alan fitz Flaad's existence and importance, and confirmed the kinship between the Stewarts and the FitzAlan Earls of Arundel.<ref name=chalmers572-3>[https://archive.org/stream/caledoniaorhisto02chal#page/572/mode/2up Chalmers, Volume 2, p. 572-3]</ref> Even then, the legendary background took almost a century to fade. In 1858, [[Robert William Eyton]], the distinguished historian of Shropshire, while clarifying Alan fitz Flaad's connection with the county and details of his marriage, still tried to maintain a link with the legendary Banquo,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/antiquitiesshro03eytogoog#page/n231/mode/2up Eyton, Volume 7, p. 215-6]</ref> and even surmised that Flaad was actually Fleance.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/antiquitiesshro03eytogoog#page/n243/mode/2up Eyton, Volume 7, p. 227]</ref>\n\nAfter an anonymous work of 1874 drew attention to a strong connection between Alan fitz Flaad and [[Brittany]], and confirmed Flaad's relationship to Alan the [[Seneschal]],<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_TVMBAAAAQAAJ#page/n427/mode/2up The Norman People, p. 408]</ref> [[J. Horace Round]] definitively established and publicised Alan fitz Flaad's true Breton origins in 1901 in a collection of genealogical essays. Alan's father, Flaad (rendered in numerous ways, including Flaald and Flathald), was a son (or possibly a brother) of Alain, ''[[dapifer]]'' to the [[Ancient Diocese of Dol]],<ref name=round120>[https://archive.org/stream/studiesinpeerage02rounuoft#page/120/mode/2up Round (1901), p. 120]</ref> with its see at [[Dol-de-Bretagne]], who had taken part in the [[First Crusade]] in 1097.<ref name=round122>[https://archive.org/stream/studiesinpeerage02rounuoft#page/122/mode/2up Round (1901), p. 122]</ref> \"Alan Dapifer\" is found as a witness in 1086 to a charter relating to Mezuoit, a cell near Dol of the [[Abbey of Saint-Florent de Saumur]]. The area of Dol is near [[Mont-Saint-Michel]] and has figured in the history of the [[Duchy of Brittany]] since at least the rule of [[Nominoe]]. Round's genealogy was confirmed in 1904 by [[James Balfour Paul|Sir James Balfour Paul]], then [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]], who, in a definitive work, ''The Scots Peerage'', stated that \"the Stewarts or Stuarts are of Breton origin, descended from a family which held the office of Senescal or Steward of Dol.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun01paul#page/8/mode/2up Paul, p. 9]</ref> He then reinstated Alan fitz Flaad to his place in the ancestry of the Scottish royal family and gave a summary of what was known of his career.\n\n===Alan fitz Flaad: family tree===\n\nRound provided a family tree<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/studiesinpeerage02rounuoft#page/128/mode/2up Round (1901), p. 129]</ref> to embody his essential findings, which is adapted below.\n\n{{chart top|text-align=left|Family of Alan fitz Flaad}}\n{{tree chart/start}}\n{{tree chart| | | | | Al  |Al='''Alan''',<br/>''Dapifer Dolensis''<br/>(Seneschal or Steward of Dol)}}\n{{tree chart| |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.|}}\n{{tree chart| Al  | | Fl  | | Rh|Al='''Alan''',<br/>''Dapifer Dolensis'',<br />Took part in First Crusade, 1097.|Fl='''Flaald'''<br/>Occurs at [[Monmouth]], 1101/2|Rh='''Rhiwallon'''<br/>Monk of St Florent.}}\n{{tree chart| | | | | |!|}}\n{{tree chart| | | | | Al  |Al='''Alan Fitz Flaad''',<br/>Founder of [[Sporle Priory]]|boxstyle_Al= background-color: #ccddcc;|}}\n{{tree chart| |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.|}}\n{{tree chart| Jor | |Will | | Wal|Jor='''Jordan Fitz Alan''',<br/>''Dapifer'' in Brittany,<br />Benefactor of [[Sele Priory]].|Will='''[[William FitzAlan, Lord of Oswestry|William Fitz Alan]]''',<br/>Lord of [[Oswestry]]<br/>Founder/benefactor of [[Haughmond Abbey]],<br/>Died 1160|Wal='''[[Walter fitz Alan|Walter Fitz Alan]]'''<br/>''Dapifer Regis Scotiae'',<br/>Founder of [[Paisley Abbey]],<br/>Died 1177|}}\n{{tree chart| |!| | | |!| | | |!|}}\n{{tree chart| Al  | |Will | | Al2|Al='''Alan Fitz Jordan''',<br/>''Dapifer Dolensis''.|Will='''[[William Fitz Alan, 1st Lord of Oswestry and Clun|William Fitz Alan II]]''',<br/>Lord of Oswestry and [[Clun]]|Al2='''[[Alan fitz Walter, 2nd High Steward of Scotland|Alan the Steward]]'''<br/>''Senescallus Regis Scotiae''|}}\n{{tree chart/end}}\n{{chart bottom}}\n<section end=Family Origins />\n\n==Career==\n\n===Arrival in England===\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Henry1 seal.jpg\n| width1 = 195\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = HenryI.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Henry's royal seal, showing the King on horseback and seated on his throne.

Eyton, consistently following the theory of the Scottish origins of the Stewarts, thought this was because he was part of the entourage of the Queen, [[Matilda of Scotland]],<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/antiquitiesshro03eytogoog#page/n247/mode/2up Eyton, Volume 7, p. 230]</ref> but Round pointed out that Henry had been besieged in [[Mont St Michel]] during his struggle with his brothers,<ref name=round124>[https://archive.org/stream/studiesinpeerage02rounuoft#page/124/mode/2up Round (1901), p. 124]</ref> an event which probably occurred in 1091. He is known to have recruited Breton troops at that time and, after his surrender, left the scene via the adjoining regions of Brittany, where Dol is situated. This is a likely explanation for the Bretons in the military retinue he brought to England after the death of [[William Rufus]].\n\nAlan's career in England can be traced largely through his presence as a witness to charters granted by the king during his travels in the first decade or more of his reign. Some of his activities were traced by Eyton, and his researches overlap with William Farrer's calendar of Henry I's travels.  All of the business in which he took part was ecclesiastical, involving grants, sometimes disputed, to churches and monasteries.\n\n===Appearances at court===\n\n[[File:Henry1.jpg|thumb|Miniature from illuminated Chronicle of [[Matthew Paris]], showing Henry enthroned and symbolically holding a church.

Alan is listed among a group of Shropshire magnates, including [[Corbet family|Corbets]] and a Peverel, meeting perhaps during Henry I's [[Norman invasion of Wales#Relations with Henry I|1114 military expedition into Wales]].

Round traced the elder Ernulf's activities in Picardy and confirmed that he had a daughter, called Ava in this context, who was named as one of those consenting to a charter granting family holdings at Hesdin to the [[Saint-Georges, Pas-de-Calais|Priory of St George]], a Benedictine house subject to [[Anchin Abbey]]<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028043663#page/n541/mode/2up Round (1899), p. 481, no. 1326.]</ref> and located by [[Vieil-Hesdin]], the original site of the town of Hesdin. The priory's record of the grant makes clear that Ernulf was riding in the entourage of William Rufus and returning to England at the time.\n\nThe issue of Alan and Avelina was:\n\n* [[William FitzAlan, Lord of Oswestry|William fitz Alan]], eldest son (d. 1160), made [[High Sheriff]] of [[Shropshire]] by King [[Stephen of England]] in 1137.

This is based on reasoning set out by Eyton. He read in Dugdale's ''History of Warwickshire'' that Sybil of [[Wolston]] had confirmed a gift of land made by her mother, Adeliza, to Burton Abbey.<ref name=eyton7-221>[https://archive.org/stream/antiquitiesshro03eytogoog#page/n237/mode/2up Eyton, Volume 7, p. 221]</ref> He was convinced the land in question had belonged to Alan and that Adeliza was the same as Avelina, his wife. As Adeliza would not have been able to grant the land until it passed into her control on his death, and the Abbey was known to have had the land by 1114, it followed that Alan could not have lived beyond 1114. However, Round's researches established the reasoning was based on a false premise. Eyton had conflated three distinct but neighbouring Warwickshire manors, all belonging at one time to Rainald de Bailleul. One of the charters he collected, in which Sybil confirms a land grant to the Benedictine abbey at [[Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives]], showed clearly that Sybil was not the daughter of Avelina and Alan fitz Flaad, but of one Hubert Baldram, a vassal of Rainald.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028043663#page/n263/mode/2up Round (1899), p. 202, no. 579.]</ref> Round thus concluded:\n\n{{quote|Thus Adeliza, mother of Sybil, and wife of Hubert Baldran, was quite distinct from Avelina, wife of Alan Fitz Flaald, with whom Mr. Eyton rashly identified her. Alan may have lived, and probably did, beyond 1114...<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/studiesinpeerage02rounuoft#page/130/mode/2up Round (1901), p. 130-1]</ref>}}\n\nHowever the date stuck and appears in the 1973 Victoria County History account of Haughmond Abbey, it appears as a ''[[terminus ante quem]]'' for events in Alan's life.<ref name=vchabbey/> It is known that Avelina de Hesdin, as a widow, made a claim for her [[dower]], relating to Eaton manor, against [[Everard of Calne]], Bishop of Norwich. She obtained 100 shillings-worth of land in the manor for life, an award that Henry I confirmed in April/May 1121 at his court in [[Winchester]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/regestaregumangl02davi#page/162/mode/2up Johnson and Cronne, p. 163, no. 1284.]</ref> Alan's death must have pre-dated this award, but not necessarily by more than a few months.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Anonymous|first1=|author1-link= |title= The Norman People and Their Existing Descendants in the British Dominions and the United States of America  |year=1874|publisher=Henry S.

[[Raphael Holinshed|Holinshed]], deriving his information from the work of [[Hector Boece]], asserted that [[Banquo]], [[Thegn|Thane]] of [[Lochaber]], was the ancestor of the Stewarts.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/chroniclesofengl05holiuoft#page/264/mode/2up Holinshed, Volume 5, p. 265]</ref> Distorting the role of Banquo, who is presented by Holinshed as Macbeth's chief accomplice in regicide,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/chroniclesofengl05holiuoft#page/268/mode/2up Holished, Volume 5, p. 269]</ref> [[William Shakespeare]] presented him flatteringly in [[Macbeth]] as a martyred ancestor of [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland and I of England]]. These legends, accepted as history, became part of the foundation narrative of the Stewarts and forced later writers to trace the Stewart ancestry through [[Fleance]], Banquo's son. David Symson, the [[Historiographer Royal (Scotland)|Historiographer Royal of Scotland]], in a work dedicated to [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], followed the chroniclers in having Fleance marry a daughter of the Welsh ruler [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]],<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/anhistoricaland00symsgoog#page/n42/mode/2up Sym, p.16-7]</ref> and then introduced [[Walter fitz Alan|Walter]] as his son<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/anhistoricaland00symsgoog#page/n44/mode/2up Sym, p.18]</ref> and [[Alan fitz Walter, 2nd High Steward of Scotland]] as his grandson.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/anhistoricaland00symsgoog#page/n48/mode/2up Sym, p.22-3]</ref> However, this greatly distorted the chronology, forcing Symson to transpose Alan fitz Walter, actually born around 1140, to about 1073. This created a gap in the record, which was filled by multiplying the Alans and Walters in the Stewart line.\n\n[[David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes]], in his ''Annals of Scotland'', published in the 1770s, went some way to establish a convincing chronology for Walter fitz Alan, who, he asserted, belonged to the reign of [[David I of Scotland]] (1124\u201353) and his successor, [[Malcolm IV of Scotland|Malcolm IV]]. Moreover, he was the first of the Stewarts: there was none in the reign of [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm III]] (1058\u201393), as Symson had been forced to maintain.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/annalsscotlandf00dalrgoog#page/n66/mode/2up Dalrymple, p. 57]</ref> He went on to demolish the legendary background to the Stewarts, which he described as \"flattering and ignorant fictions\". He showed that there was a need to distinguish the various Alans who were connected with the Stewart line, something he was unembarrassed to be unable to do:\n\n{{quote|Some of my readers may demand, \"Who then was Alan the father of Walter, Stewart of Scotland in the reign of Malcolm IV?\" ...

Horace Round]] definitively established and publicised Alan fitz Flaad's true Breton origins in 1901 in a collection of genealogical essays. Alan's father, Flaad (rendered in numerous ways, including Flaald and Flathald), was a son (or possibly a brother) of Alain, ''[[dapifer]]'' to the [[Ancient Diocese of Dol]],<ref name=round120>[https://archive.org/stream/studiesinpeerage02rounuoft#page/120/mode/2up Round (1901), p. 120]</ref> with its see at [[Dol-de-Bretagne]], who had taken part in the [[First Crusade]] in 1097.<ref name=round122>[https://archive.org/stream/studiesinpeerage02rounuoft#page/122/mode/2up Round (1901), p. 122]</ref> \"Alan Dapifer\" is found as a witness in 1086 to a charter relating to Mezuoit, a cell near Dol of the [[Abbey of Saint-Florent de Saumur]]. The area of Dol is near [[Mont-Saint-Michel]] and has figured in the history of the [[Duchy of Brittany]] since at least the rule of [[Nominoe]]. Round's genealogy was confirmed in 1904 by [[James Balfour Paul|Sir James Balfour Paul]], then [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]], who, in a definitive work, ''The Scots Peerage'', stated that \"the Stewarts or Stuarts are of Breton origin, descended from a family which held the office of Senescal or Steward of Dol.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun01paul#page/8/mode/2up Paul, p. 9]</ref> He then reinstated Alan fitz Flaad to his place in the ancestry of the Scottish royal family and gave a summary of what was known of his career.\n\n===Alan fitz Flaad: family tree===\n\nRound provided a family tree<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/studiesinpeerage02rounuoft#page/128/mode/2up Round (1901), p. 129]</ref> to embody his essential findings, which is adapted below.\n\n{{chart top|text-align=left|Family of Alan fitz Flaad}}\n{{tree chart/start}}\n{{tree chart| | | | |Al|Al='''Alan''',<br/>''Dapifer Dolensis''<br/>(Seneschal or Steward of Dol)}}\n{{tree chart| |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|.|}}\n{{tree chart|Al| |Fl| |Rh|Al='''Alan''',<br/>''Dapifer Dolensis'',<br />Took part in First Crusade, 1097.|Fl='''Flaald'''<br/>Occurs at [[Monmouth]], 1101/2|Rh='''Rhiwallon'''<br/>Monk of St Florent.}}\n{{tree chart| | | | | |!|}}\n{{tree chart| | | | |Al|Al='''Alan Fitz Flaad''',<br/>Founder of [[Sporle Priory]]|boxstyle_Al= background-color: #ccddcc;|}}\n{{tree chart| |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|.|}}\n{{tree chart|Jor| |Will| |Wal|Jor='''Jordan Fitz Alan''',<br/>''Dapifer'' in Brittany,<br />Benefactor of [[Sele Priory]].|Will='''[[William FitzAlan, Lord of Oswestry|William Fitz Alan]]''',<br/>Lord of [[Oswestry]]<br/>Founder/benefactor of [[Haughmond Abbey]],<br/>Died 1160|Wal='''[[Walter fitz Alan|Walter Fitz Alan]]'''<br/>''Dapifer Regis Scotiae'',<br/>Founder of [[Paisley Abbey]],<br/>Died 1177|}}\n{{tree chart| |!| | | |!| | |!|}}\n{{tree chart|Al| |Will| |Al2|Al='''Alan Fitz Jordan''',<br/>''Dapifer Dolensis''.|Will='''[[William Fitz Alan, 1st Lord of Oswestry and Clun|William Fitz Alan II]]''',<br/>Lord of Oswestry and [[Clun]]|Al2='''[[Alan fitz Walter, 2nd High Steward of Scotland|Alan the Steward]]'''<br/>''Senescallus Regis Scotiae''|}}\n{{tree chart/end}}\n{{chart bottom}}\n<section end=Family Origins />\n\n==Career==\n\n===Arrival in England===\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Henry1 seal.jpg\n| width1 = 195\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = HenryI.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Henry's royal seal, showing the King on horseback and seated on his throne.

Eyton, consistently following the theory of the Scottish origins of the Stewarts, thought this was because he was part of the entourage of the Queen, [[Matilda of Scotland]],<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/antiquitiesshro03eytogoog#page/n247/mode/2up Eyton, Volume 7, p. 230]</ref> but Round pointed out that Henry had been besieged in [[Mont St Michel]] during his struggle with his brothers,<ref name=round124>[https://archive.org/stream/studiesinpeerage02rounuoft#page/124/mode/2up Round (1901), p. 124]</ref> an event which probably occurred in 1091. He is known to have recruited Breton troops at that time and, after his surrender, left the scene via the adjoining regions of Brittany, where Dol is situated. This is a likely explanation for the Bretons in the military retinue he brought to England after the death of [[William Rufus]].\n\nAlan's career in England can be traced largely through his presence as a witness to charters granted by the king during his travels in the first decade or more of his reign. Some of his activities were traced by Eyton, and his researches overlap with William Farrer's calendar of Henry I's travels.  All of the business in which he took part was ecclesiastical, involving grants, sometimes disputed, to churches and monasteries.\n\n===Appearances at court===\n\n[[File:Henry1.jpg|thumb|Miniature from illuminated Chronicle of [[Matthew Paris]], showing Henry enthroned and symbolically holding a church.

Alan is listed among a group of Shropshire magnates, including [[Corbet family|Corbets]] and a Peverel, meeting perhaps during Henry I's [[Norman invasion of Wales#Relations with Henry I|1114 military expedition into Wales]]. Johnson and Cronne tentatively place the meeting at [[Holdgate Castle]] in Shropshire. Eyton dates the event earlier, around the time of a royal expedition to Shropshire in 1109.<ref name=eyton7-220>[https://archive.org/stream/antiquitiesshro03eytogoog#page/n237/mode/2up Eyton, ''Antiquities of Shropshire'', Volume 7, p. 220]</ref> Whatever the date, it shows Alan as an important member of the Shropshire landowning class.\n\n===Territorial magnate===\n\nAlan's rapid ascent to wealth and power was a symptom of the troubled times. The abortive revolt of [[Robert de Belleme]] in 1102 had torn apart the Anglo-Norman system of governing the [[Welsh Marches]]. With other Breton friends, Alan had been given forfeited lands in [[Norfolk]] and [[Shropshire]], including some which had previously belonged to Robert de Belleme himself.<ref name=\"Ritchie (1954) p.280-1\">Ritchie (1954) p.280-1</ref> Robert had proved a threat to Henry in both the [[Welsh Marches]] and in Normandy, so the king was determined to insert reliable supporters to counterbalance or replace his network of supporters. Alan received more land as he proved his worth. A large portfolio of lands in Shropshire and around Peppering, near [[Arundel]] in Sussex, was taken from the holdings of Rainald de Bailleul,<ref name=vchabbey>A T Gaydon, R B Pugh (Editors), M J Angold, G C Baugh, [[Marjorie M Chibnall]], D C Cox, Revd D T W Price, Margaret Tomlinson, B S Trinder: [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=39927 Victoria County History: Shropshire, Volume 2, Chapter 9: the Abbey of Haughmond]</ref> ancestor of the [[House of Balliol]], which was also later to provide a king of Scotland. These were lands granted to Rainald by [[William the Conqueror]] in recognition of his role as [[High Sheriff of Shropshire|Sheriff of Shropshire]]. There is no evidence that Rainald or his successor, Hugh, were rebels, and it seems that their lands came to Alan as a consequence of his elevation to the shrievalty of the county.<ref name=eyton7-220/> He also gained a stake in the very large estates of [[Ernulf de Hesdin]] by marriage to his daughter, Avelina.<ref name=eyton7-202/>\n\n==Religious grants and foundations==\n\n[[File:Norwich Cathedral Nave 1, Norfolk, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|The very long [[nave]] of Norwich Cathedral, a Norman foundation under construction in Alan's day.

One of the grants to Norwich Cathedral that he witnessed in 1101 concerned [[advowson]] of the church at [[Langham, Norfolk]], which \"had been Alan's\", along with the tithes. It is possible this was a donation by himself.<ref name=eyton7-217/> At some point unknown he gave the [[manor]] of [[Eaton, Norfolk|Eaton]] near Norwich, to Norwich Cathedral, a gift the king  promised \"to confirm when Alan comes to my court.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/outlineitinerary00farruoft#page/54/mode/2up Farrer, p. 54, no. 243]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/regestaregumangl02davi#page/54/mode/2up Johnson and Cronne, p. 55, no. 762]</ref> It is unclear whether this implied the king doubted the existence or the authenticity of the monks' charter:<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/regestaregumangl02davi#page/n33/mode/2up Johnson and Cronne, p. xxviii]</ref> it certainly implies that Alan's attendance at court was to be expected.

He gave land at his manor of [[Stretton-on-Dunsmore]] in Warwickshire to [[Burton Abbey]].<ref name=eyton7-221/> He granted the tithes from his [[demesne]] at [[Burton on Trent]] to the monks of [[L\u00e9hon]] in Brittany, where there was a priory subject to the Abbey of Marmoutier: this is known from its confirmation some decades later by his grandson, Alan fitz Jordan.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028043663#page/n501/mode/2up Round (1899), p. 441, no. 1221.]</ref> Alan fitz Jordan also confirmed his grandfather's grant to Marmoutier of property at [[Cuguen]],<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/studiesinpeerage02rounuoft#page/126/mode/2up Round (1901), p. 127]</ref> in Brittany, and confirmed or restored Alan fitz Flaad's gift of a mill at Burton to [[Sele Priory]], a small Sussex monastery subordinate to St Florent de Saumur.<ref name=eyton7-219/>\n\n==Marriage and family==\n\nAlan fitz Flaad married [[Avelina de Hesdin]], daughter of [[Ernulf de Hesdin]], a [[tenant-in-chief]] in ten counties at the time of [[Domesday]],<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028043663#page/n51/mode/2up Round (1899), p. xlvii]</ref> who was killed on crusade at [[Antioch]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/studiesinpeerage02rounuoft#page/116/mode/2up Round (1901), p. 116]</ref><ref>Ritchie (1954) p. 98n</ref> The Burkes' ''Royal Families'' of 1848 was one of the sources that asserted Alan's wife was the \"dau(ghter) and heir of Warine, Sheriff of Shropshire, ''temp.''

He noted that \n* William fitz Alan, in grants of his Sussex estates to Haughmond Abbey, referred to his mother as Adelina\n* in the account by [[Orderic Vitalis]] of the siege of [[Shrewsbury]] in 1138, the defender \"Ernulf de Hesding\" is referred to as the ''avunculus'' or maternal uncle of William fitz Alan.<ref name=eyton7-202>[https://archive.org/stream/antiquitiesshro03eytogoog#page/n239/mode/2up Eyton, Volume 7, p. 222]</ref>\nBy deduction, this Ernulf, who shared his father's name and byname, was the brother of Avelina. Round traced the elder Ernulf's activities in Picardy and confirmed that he had a daughter, called Ava in this context, who was named as one of those consenting to a charter granting family holdings at Hesdin to the [[Saint-Georges, Pas-de-Calais|Priory of St George]], a Benedictine house subject to [[Anchin Abbey]]<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028043663#page/n541/mode/2up Round (1899), p. 481, no. 1326.]</ref> and located by [[Vieil-Hesdin]], the original site of the town of Hesdin. The priory's record of the grant makes clear that Ernulf was riding in the entourage of William Rufus and returning to England at the time.\n\nThe issue of Alan and Avelina was:\n\n* [[William FitzAlan, Lord of Oswestry|William fitz Alan]], eldest son (d. 1160), made [[High Sheriff]] of [[Shropshire]] by King [[Stephen of England]] in 1137.

This is based on reasoning set out by Eyton. He read in Dugdale's ''History of Warwickshire'' that Sybil of [[Wolston]] had confirmed a gift of land made by her mother, Adeliza, to Burton Abbey.<ref name=eyton7-221>[https://archive.org/stream/antiquitiesshro03eytogoog#page/n237/mode/2up Eyton, Volume 7, p. 221]</ref> He was convinced the land in question had belonged to Alan and that Adeliza was the same as Avelina, his wife. As Adeliza would not have been able to grant the land until it passed into her control on his death, and the Abbey was known to have had the land by 1114, it followed that Alan could not have lived beyond 1114. However, Round's researches established the reasoning was based on a false premise. Eyton had conflated three distinct but neighbouring Warwickshire manors, all belonging at one time to Rainald de Bailleul. One of the charters he collected, in which Sybil confirms a land grant to the Benedictine abbey at [[Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives]], showed clearly that Sybil was not the daughter of Avelina and Alan fitz Flaad, but of one Hubert Baldram, a vassal of Rainald.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028043663#page/n263/mode/2up Round (1899), p. 202, no. 579.]</ref> Round thus concluded:\n\n{{quote|Thus Adeliza, mother of Sybil, and wife of Hubert Baldran, was quite distinct from Avelina, wife of Alan Fitz Flaald, with whom Mr. Eyton rashly identified her.
