It is part of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, and the sequel to ''[[Sonic Advance 2]]''. The game stars the characters [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Tails (character)|Tails]], [[Amy Rose|Amy]], [[Knuckles the Echidna|Knuckles]], and [[Cream the Rabbit|Cream]] as they seek to keep [[Doctor Eggman]] and his robot assistant Gemerl from building empires on each of seven chunks Eggman has divided the Earth into.\n\nThe game is a fast-paced [[2D computer graphics|2D]] platformer that takes place across seven zones, each divided into three acts and a [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] fight. It allows one or two players to control any two of the five characters; each one has different abilities that allow players varying access to parts of levels. While the graphics are mainly 2D, the game features some 3D rotation effects. It sold quickly upon release and received positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay and aesthetics, though they were more divided on the team-up dynamic. The game was later released for the [[Wii U]]'s [[Virtual Console]] in Japan in May 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/titles/20010000017088|title=\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af \u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9 3 {{!}} Wii U {{!}} \u4efb\u5929\u5802|language=ja-JP|access-date=2016-08-16}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sonic Advance 3 Cream and Knuckles.png|thumb|left|Game screenshot showing [[Cream the Rabbit]] and [[Knuckles the Echidna]].

The player controls one of five characters simultaneously with a second one as a sidekick; alternately, a second player joins and one controls each character. The two characters run and jump through a series of seven levels, destroying robots along the way.<ref name=\"ign\"/> The player collects [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Common features|rings]] in levels and boss battles as a form of health: upon being hit by an enemy or harmful obstacle, the player's rings will scatter and can be recollected. Being hit while carrying no rings, being crushed by an obstacle, falling into a bottomless pit, drowning underwater, or running out of time causes death. When losing a life, the duo will return to the checkpoint or at the start of the act.

Nich Maragos from [[1UP.com]] celebrated that Sonic Team had \"finally [come] up with a way of introducing teamwork and variance between characters that doesn't overwhelm Sonic's bread-and-butter gameplay.\" Maragos singled this out as the main divider between ''Advance 3'' and ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'', a game that he found surprisingly linear in level design considering that it, unlike ''Advance 3'', was in [[3D computer graphics|3D]].<ref name=\"1up\"/> Maragos, [[GameSpot]]'s Frank Provo, [[IGN]]'s Craig Harris, and ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Lisa Mason appreciated the increase in replayability Sonic's friends brought.<ref name=\"ign\"/><ref name=\"1up\"/><ref name=\"gi\"/><ref name=\"gamespot\"/> However, Mason, as well as reviewer Stardingo from ''[[GamePro]]'', thought that they played too much like Sonic and did not add much to the experience.<ref name=\"gamepro\"/><ref name=\"gi\"/> Darryl Vassar of [[GameSpy]] took a different point of criticism: he acknowledged the presence of genuinely different character abilities, but perceived that their only purpose was to find Chao, whom he called \"pointless\".<ref name=\"gamespy\"/> Maragos noted that the \"mid-air trick\" system from ''Advance 2'' was optional in ''Advance 3'', but spoke positively about its usefulness in locating \"hidden areas\".<ref name=\"1up\"/> Harris argued that such varying team abilities contributed to occasional \"cheapness\" in the level design, because \"most of the characters have absolutely no defense when hopping off items like springboards\".<ref name=\"ign\"/>\n\nHowever, the gameplay was mostly well-received otherwise. Vassar acclaimed the level design: he both called the levels \"enormous and fast\" and praised the slower, smaller sections for \"keeping the levels distinct and adding short interludes to the constant running and loops.\"<ref name=\"gamespy\"/> Harris also praised the \"clever\" level design.<ref name=\"ign\"/> However, Mason found it \"simplistic\",<ref name=\"gi\"/> while Stardingo saw \"repetition\" in the typical formula.<ref name=\"gamepro\"/> Maragos criticized the bipolar difficulty of the bosses and some minor control issues.<ref name=\"1up\"/> Vassar, however, appreciated the return from ''Advance 2''{{'}}s running-based boss battles to more traditional ones.<ref name=\"gamespy\"/> Further praise from Harris, conversely, went to the multiplayer mode and\u2014along with Stardingo\u2014to the presence of a hub world, which Harris and Stardingo thought gave the game structure.<ref name=\"ign\"/><ref name=\"gamepro\"/>\n\nThe game's aesthetics were also well received. Provo stated that \"in terms of graphics and sound, ''Sonic Advance 3'' is on par with the best that companies like [[Nintendo]] and [[Konami]] have had to offer this year\". He specifically complimented the character animations, simulations of underwater waves, and in-depth background effects.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> Vassar praised ''Advance 3'' for continuing ''Advance 1'' and ''2''{{'}}s emulation of the \"colorful, angular, and stylized look\" of the original ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis]], as well as its \"twangy, upbeat tunes\".<ref name=\"gamespy\"/> Stardingo thought similarly overall but criticized the \"garish\" themes of the level Toy Kingdom.<ref name=\"gamepro\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Video games}}\n*[http://sonic.sega.jp/advance3/ Official website] {{in lang|ja}}\n{{Sonic the Hedgehog}}\n\n[[Category:2004 video games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy Advance games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Japan]]\n[[Category:Platform games]]\n[[Category:Sega video games]]\n[[Category:THQ games]]\n[[Category:Side-scrolling video games]]\n[[Category:Sonic Team games]]\n[[Category:Dimps games]]\n[[Category:Sonic the Hedgehog video games]]\n[[Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Video games produced by Yuji Naka]]\n[[Category:Virtual Console games]]\n", "text_old": "{{good article}}\n{{Infobox video game\n|title = Sonic Advance 3\n|image = Sonic Advance 3 Coverart.png\n| caption = \n|developer = {{ubl|[[Dimps]]|[[Sonic Team]]}}\n|publisher = {{vgrelease|JP|[[Sega]]|US|[[THQ]]|EU|[[Sega Europe]], [[THQ]]}}\n|series = ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]''\n|platforms = [[Game Boy Advance]]\n|released = {{Video game release|NA|June 7, 2004|EU|June 15, 2004|JP|June 17, 2004|AU|November 29, 2004}}\n|genre = [[Platform game|Platformer]]\n|modes = [[Single-player]], [[multiplayer]]\n|director= Akinori Nishiyama \n|producer = {{ubl|[[Yuji Naka]]|Kouichi Sakita}}\n|artist = [[Yuji Uekawa]]\n|composer = {{ubl|[[Hideaki Kobayashi (composer)|Hideaki Kobayashi]]<ref>{{cite tweet|user=hide__aki|author=Hideaki Kobayashi|title=Yeah!

It is part of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, and the sequel to ''[[Sonic Advance 2]]''. The game stars the characters [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Tails (character)|Tails]], [[Amy Rose|Amy]], [[Knuckles the Echidna|Knuckles]], and [[Cream the Rabbit|Cream]] as they seek to keep [[Doctor Eggman]] and his robot assistant Gemerl from building empires on each of seven chunks Eggman has divided the Earth into.\n\nThe game is a fast-paced [[2D computer graphics|2D]] platformer that takes place across seven zones, each divided into three acts and a [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] fight. It allows one or two players to control any two of the five characters; each one has different abilities that allow players varying access to parts of levels. While the graphics are mainly 2D, the game features some 3D rotation effects. It sold quickly upon release and received positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay and aesthetics, though they were more divided on the team-up dynamic. The game was later released for the [[Wii U]]'s [[Virtual Console]] in Japan in May 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/titles/20010000017088|title=\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af \u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9 3 {{!}} Wii U {{!}} \u4efb\u5929\u5802|language=ja-JP|access-date=2016-08-16}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sonic Advance 3 Cream and Knuckles.png|thumb|left|Game screenshot showing [[Cream the Rabbit]] and [[Knuckles the Echidna]].

Nich Maragos from [[1UP.com]] celebrated that Sonic Team had \"finally [come] up with a way of introducing teamwork and variance between characters that doesn't overwhelm Sonic's bread-and-butter gameplay.\" Maragos singled this out as the main divider between ''Advance 3'' and ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'', a game that he found surprisingly linear in level design considering that it, unlike ''Advance 3'', was in [[3D computer graphics|3D]].<ref name=\"1up\"/> Maragos, [[GameSpot]]'s Frank Provo, [[IGN]]'s Craig Harris, and ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Lisa Mason appreciated the increase in replayability Sonic's friends brought.<ref name=\"ign\"/><ref name=\"1up\"/><ref name=\"gi\"/><ref name=\"gamespot\"/> However, Mason, as well as reviewer Stardingo from ''[[GamePro]]'', thought that they played too much like Sonic and did not add much to the experience.<ref name=\"gamepro\"/><ref name=\"gi\"/> Darryl Vassar of [[GameSpy]] took a different point of criticism: he acknowledged the presence of genuinely different character abilities, but perceived that their only purpose was to find Chao, whom he called \"pointless\".<ref name=\"gamespy\"/> Maragos noted that the \"mid-air trick\" system from ''Advance 2'' was optional in ''Advance 3'', but spoke positively about its usefulness in locating \"hidden areas\".<ref name=\"1up\"/> Harris argued that such varying team abilities contributed to occasional \"cheapness\" in the level design, because \"most of the characters have absolutely no defense when hopping off items like springboards\".<ref name=\"ign\"/>\n\nHowever, the gameplay was mostly well-received otherwise. Vassar acclaimed the level design: he both called the levels \"enormous and fast\" and praised the slower, smaller sections for \"keeping the levels distinct and adding short interludes to the constant running and loops.\"<ref name=\"gamespy\"/> Harris also praised the \"clever\" level design.<ref name=\"ign\"/> However, Mason found it \"simplistic\",<ref name=\"gi\"/> while Stardingo saw \"repetition\" in the typical formula.<ref name=\"gamepro\"/> Maragos criticized the bipolar difficulty of the bosses and some minor control issues.<ref name=\"1up\"/> Vassar, however, appreciated the return from ''Advance 2''{{'}}s running-based boss battles to more traditional ones.<ref name=\"gamespy\"/> Further praise from Harris, conversely, went to the multiplayer mode and\u2014along with Stardingo\u2014to the presence of a hub world, which Harris and Stardingo thought gave the game structure.<ref name=\"ign\"/><ref name=\"gamepro\"/>\n\nThe game's aesthetics were also well received. Provo stated that \"in terms of graphics and sound, ''Sonic Advance 3'' is on par with the best that companies like [[Nintendo]] and [[Konami]] have had to offer this year\". He specifically complimented the character animations, simulations of underwater waves, and in-depth background effects.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> Vassar praised ''Advance 3'' for continuing ''Advance 1'' and ''2''{{'}}s emulation of the \"colorful, angular, and stylized look\" of the original ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis]], as well as its \"twangy, upbeat tunes\".<ref name=\"gamespy\"/> Stardingo thought similarly overall but criticized the \"garish\" themes of the level Toy Kingdom.<ref name=\"gamepro\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Video games}}\n*[http://sonic.sega.jp/advance3/ Official website] {{in lang|ja}}\n{{Sonic the Hedgehog}}\n\n[[Category:2004 video games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy Advance games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Japan]]\n[[Category:Platform games]]\n[[Category:Sega video games]]\n[[Category:THQ games]]\n[[Category:Side-scrolling video games]]\n[[Category:Sonic Team games]]\n[[Category:Dimps games]]\n[[Category:Sonic the Hedgehog video games]]\n[[Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Video games produced by Yuji Naka]]\n[[Category:Virtual Console games]]\n", "name_user": "TheJoebro64", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Advance_3"}
