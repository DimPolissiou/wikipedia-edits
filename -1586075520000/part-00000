{"title_page": "Waru Waru", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=March 2015}}\n\n'''Waru Waru''' is an [[Aymaran languages|Aymara]] term for the [[agriculture|agricultural]] technique developed by pre-Hispanic people in the Andes region of [[South America]] from Colombia to Bolivia; this regional agricultural technique is also referred to as [[Camellones]] in Spanish. Functionally similar agricultural techniques have been developed in other parts of the world, which all fall under the broad category of [[raised field]] agriculture. \n\nThis type of [[altiplano]] field agriculture consists of parallel canals alternated by raised planting beds, which would be strategically located on floodplains or near a water source so that the fields could be properly irrigated. These flooded fields were composed of soil that was rich in nutrients due to the presence of aquatic plants and other organic materials. Through the process of mounding up this soil to create planting beds, natural, recyclable fertilizer was made available in a region where nitrogen-rich soils were rare. <ref>Janusek, John W.; Kolata, Alan L. 2004. \"Top-down or bottom-up: rural settlement and raised field agriculture in the Lake Titicaca Basin, Bolivia.\" ''Journal of Anthropological Archaeology'', Vol. 23, pg.409</ref> By trapping solar radiation during the day, this raised field agricultural method also protected crops from freezing overnight. <ref>Janusek, John W.; Kolata, Alan L. 2004. \"Top-down or bottom-up: rural settlement and raised field agriculture in the Lake Titicaca Basin, Bolivia.\" ''Journal of Anthropological Archaeology'', Vol. 23, pg.409</ref> These raised planting beds were irrigated very efficiently by the adjacent canals which extended the growing season significantly, allowing for more food yield. Waru Waru were able to yield larger amounts of food than previous agricultural methods due to the overall efficiency of the system. \n\nThis technique is dated to around 300 B.C., and is most commonly associated with the [[Tiwanaku]] culture of the [[Lake Titicaca]] region in southern Bolivia, who used this method to grow crops like [[potatoes]] and [[quinoa]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Raised beds and waru waru cultivation |publisher=[[Organization of American States]], Department of Sustainable Development|url=http://www.oas.org/dsd/publications/Unit/oea59e/ch27.htm |accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref> This type of agriculture also created artificial ecosystems, which attracted other food sources such as fish and lake birds. Past cultures in the Lake Titicaca region likely utilized these additional resources as a subsistence method. <ref> Erickson, Clark L. 1988 \"Raised Field Agriculture in the Lake Titicaca Basin: Putting Ancient Agriculture Back to Work\". ''Expedition'', Vol. 30, pg. 9</ref>  It combines [[raised bed gardening|raised bed]]s with [[irrigation]] channels to prevent damage by [[soil erosion]] during floods. It ensures both collecting of water (either [[fluvial]] water, rainwater or [[phreatic]] water) and subsequent drainage. The drainage aspect of this method makes it particularly useful in many areas subjected to risks of brutal floods, such as tropical parts of Bolivia and Peru where it emerged. Raised field agricultural methods has been used in many other countries such as China, Mexico and Belize. Mexican [[Chinampas]] were similar to Waru Waru in that they created on or near a water source in order to properly irrigate crops. Raised fields are known in Belize from various sites, including [[Pulltrouser Swamp]].\n\n== Modern Uses ==\nIn the 1960's, archaeologists William Denevan, George Plafker, and Kenneth Lee found evidence of raised field agriculture that had been utilized in the Llanos de Moxos region of Bolivia's Amazon basin, a region that was previously thought to be unable to sustain large-scale agriculture because of the difficulty of doing so in a tropical environment. This discovery led to a joint experimental archaeology project in the region involving the Inter-American Foundation, the Parroquia of San Ignacio, the Bolivian Institute of Archaeology, and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology. The goal of this experiment was to attempt to bring back raised field agriculture in the region. This project began in 1990 at the Biological Station of the Department of the Beni in Bolivia, and because of its success was later implemented further with the collaboration of local indigenous communities. The indigenous community provided land for the project, and the Inter-American Foundation paid them wages to build and maintain the plots, which successfully produced manioc and maize. These plots did not require extensive upkeep following the initial season's planting because of the artificial ecosystem that they created. <ref> Erickson, Clark L. 1994 \"Festival of American Folklife: Culture and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean\" ''Smithsonian Institution'' https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~cerickso/applied3.html </ref>\n\nThis agricultural method was recently revived by [[Alan Kolata]] of the [[University of Chicago]] in 1984, in [[Tiwanaku]], [[Bolivia]] as well as [[Puno]], [[Peru]]. Research on Waru Waru and its effectiveness in the past has led to a resurgence of the technique amongst contemporary Aymara and Quecha speaking native peoples in Bolivia and Peru. By utilyzing this centuries-old technique, modern people in the region have been able to make use of the harsh altiplano landscape.<ref name=\"theguardian\">{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/aug/19/water-scarcity-drought-peru-kenya-india?CMP=twt_gu | title=The three wonders of the ancient world solving modern water problems In Peru, Kenya and India, NGOs are helping communities overcome water scarcity using wisdom from the past | publisher=The Guardian | date=19 August 2015 | accessdate=19 August 2015 |author1=Nivedita Khandekar |author2=Geoffrey Kamadi |author3=Dan Collyns }}</ref> This method is now being used in different areas of South America where farming is difficult, such as the altiplano and the Amazon basin. Because of this method, indigenous people are now able to farm the landscape much more efficiently, and without the use of modern equipment. This method also allows for large scale agriculture to be performed in the Amazon basin without having to rely on deforestation.\n\n=== Experiments ===\nResearch was done at two raised field sites by Diego Sanchez de Lozada et al. in the northern Altiplano of Bolivia near Lake Titicaca in an effort to better understand the effects of frost on potato crops. At an altitude of 3810 m, these potato crops were subject to temperature and moisture measurements. Temperatures of the soil on top of the 50 cm high raised mounds was about 1 degree Celsius higher than the temperature of the ground in nearby fields, showing that the raised field technique was able to partially mitigate frost effects on potato crops at night. Temperature and moisture analysis of the raised fields showed that the higher temperature present was due to above-ground processes, which caused cold air to fall to the canals and not on the planted rows. <ref> de Lozada, Diego Sanchez et al. 1998 \"Heat and moisture dynamics in raised field systems of the lake Titicaca region (Bolivia).\" ''Agricultural and Forest Meteorology'' Vol. 92, pg.251</ref> The frost mitigation effects of the raised field system kept crops from freezing overnight, which increased crop yield.\n\n== History ==\n=== Lake Titicaca Region ===\n16th Century Spanish accounts of the Lake Titicaca region mentioned the different types of agriculture utilized by the native peoples in detail, however there was never any mention of raised fields in their records. The lack of Spanish accounts strongly suggests that these Waru Waru were no longer in use by the time the [[conquistadors]] reached the Lake Titicaca region. \n\nThe raised fields of the region are numerous and range in size, however they are generally 4-10 m wide, 10 to 100 m long, and 1 m tall. These pre-Hispanic fields cover about 82,000 hectares of land in Bolivia and Peru, and sit above an altitude of around 3,800 m. [[Radiocarbon]] dates taken from habitation sites associated with raised field agriculture in the region indicate usage sometimes between 1000 B.C. to A.D. 400. [[Thermoluminescence dating]] was also used to date pottery shards in associated areas, the results of which agree with the radiocarbon dates. Field stratigraphy was used to provide relative dates of the usage of certain raised fields in the area. The habitation sites in association with these fields indicate large populations and long-term occupations, suggesting that raised field agriculture was able to sustain large amounts of people.  These dates provided from Andean sites suggest that this form of agriculture was a relatively early phenomenon in the area that slowly expanded throughout the region, and was utilized by various cultures during different time periods. <ref> Erickson, Clark L. 1988 \"Raised Field Agriculture in the Lake Titicaca Basin: Putting Ancient Agriculture Back to Work\".

Waru Waru were able to yield larger amounts of food than previous agricultural methods due to the overall efficiency of the system. \n\nThis technique is dated to around 300 B.C., and is most commonly associated with the [[Tiwanaku]] culture of the [[Lake Titicaca]] region in southern Bolivia, who used this method to grow crops like [[potatoes]] and [[quinoa]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Raised beds and waru waru cultivation |publisher=[[Organization of American States]], Department of Sustainable Development|url=http://www.oas.org/dsd/publications/Unit/oea59e/ch27.htm |accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref> This type of agriculture also created artificial ecosystems, which attracted other food sources such as fish and lake birds. Past cultures in the Lake Titicaca region likely utilized these additional resources as a subsistence method. <ref> Erickson, Clark L. 1988 \"Raised Field Agriculture in the Lake Titicaca Basin: Putting Ancient Agriculture Back to Work\". ''Expedition'', Vol. 30, pg. 9</ref>  It combines [[raised bed gardening|raised bed]]s with [[irrigation]] channels to prevent damage by [[soil erosion]] during floods. It ensures both collecting of water (either [[fluvial]] water, rainwater or [[phreatic]] water) and subsequent drainage. The drainage aspect of this method makes it particularly useful in many areas subjected to risks of brutal floods, such as tropical parts of Bolivia and Peru where it emerged. Raised field agricultural methods has been used in many other countries such as China, Mexico and Belize. Mexican [[Chinampas]] were similar to Waru Waru in that they created on or near a water source in order to properly irrigate crops. Raised fields are known in Belize from various sites, including [[Pulltrouser Swamp]].\n\n== Modern Uses ==\nIn the 1960's, archaeologists William Denevan, George Plafker, and Kenneth Lee found evidence of raised field agriculture that had been utilized in the Llanos de Moxos region of Bolivia's Amazon basin, a region that was previously thought to be unable to sustain large-scale agriculture because of the difficulty of doing so in a tropical environment. This discovery led to a joint experimental archaeology project in the region involving the Inter-American Foundation, the Parroquia of San Ignacio, the Bolivian Institute of Archaeology, and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology. The goal of this experiment was to attempt to bring back raised field agriculture in the region. This project began in 1990 at the Biological Station of the Department of the Beni in Bolivia, and because of its success was later implemented further with the collaboration of local indigenous communities. The indigenous community provided land for the project, and the Inter-American Foundation paid them wages to build and maintain the plots, which successfully produced manioc and maize. These plots did not require extensive upkeep following the initial season's planting because of the artificial ecosystem that they created. <ref> Erickson, Clark L. 1994 \"Festival of American Folklife: Culture and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean\" ''Smithsonian Institution'' https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~cerickso/applied3.html </ref>\n\nThis agricultural method was recently revived by [[Alan Kolata]] of the [[University of Chicago]] in 1984, in [[Tiwanaku]], [[Bolivia]] as well as [[Puno]], [[Peru]]. Research on Waru Waru and its effectiveness in the past has led to a resurgence of the technique amongst contemporary Aymara and Quecha speaking native peoples in Bolivia and Peru. By utilyzing this centuries-old technique, modern people in the region have been able to make use of the harsh altiplano landscape.<ref name=\"theguardian\">{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/aug/19/water-scarcity-drought-peru-kenya-india?CMP=twt_gu | title=The three wonders of the ancient world solving modern water problems In Peru, Kenya and India, NGOs are helping communities overcome water scarcity using wisdom from the past | publisher=The Guardian | date=19 August 2015 | accessdate=19 August 2015 |author1=Nivedita Khandekar |author2=Geoffrey Kamadi |author3=Dan Collyns }}</ref> This method is now being used in different areas of South America where farming is difficult, such as the altiplano and the Amazon basin. Because of this method, indigenous people are now able to farm the landscape much more efficiently, and without the use of modern equipment. This method also allows for large scale agriculture to be performed in the Amazon basin without having to rely on deforestation.\n\n=== Experiments ===\nResearch was done at two raised field sites by Diego Sanchez de Lozada et al. in the northern Altiplano of Bolivia near Lake Titicaca in an effort to better understand the effects of frost on potato crops. At an altitude of 3810 m, these potato crops were subject to temperature and moisture measurements. Temperatures of the soil on top of the 50 cm high raised mounds was about 1 degree Celsius higher than the temperature of the ground in nearby fields, showing that the raised field technique was able to partially mitigate frost effects on potato crops at night. Temperature and moisture analysis of the raised fields showed that the higher temperature present was due to above-ground processes, which caused cold air to fall to the canals and not on the planted rows. <ref> de Lozada, Diego Sanchez et al. 1998 \"Heat and moisture dynamics in raised field systems of the lake Titicaca region (Bolivia).\" ''Agricultural and Forest Meteorology'' Vol. 92, pg.251</ref> The frost mitigation effects of the raised field system kept crops from freezing overnight, which increased crop yield.\n\n== History ==\n=== Lake Titicaca Region ===\n16th Century Spanish accounts of the Lake Titicaca region mentioned the different types of agriculture utilized by the native peoples in detail, however there was never any mention of raised fields in their records. The lack of Spanish accounts strongly suggests that these Waru Waru were no longer in use by the time the [[conquistadors]] reached the Lake Titicaca region. \n\nThe raised fields of the region are numerous and range in size, however they are generally 4-10 m wide, 10 to 100 m long, and 1 m tall. These pre-Hispanic fields cover about 82,000 hectares of land in Bolivia and Peru, and sit above an altitude of around 3,800 m. [[Radiocarbon]] dates taken from habitation sites associated with raised field agriculture in the region indicate usage sometimes between 1000 B.C. to A.D. 400. [[Thermoluminescence dating]] was also used to date pottery shards in associated areas, the results of which agree with the radiocarbon dates. Field stratigraphy was used to provide relative dates of the usage of certain raised fields in the area. The habitation sites in association with these fields indicate large populations and long-term occupations, suggesting that raised field agriculture was able to sustain large amounts of people.  These dates provided from Andean sites suggest that this form of agriculture was a relatively early phenomenon in the area that slowly expanded throughout the region, and was utilized by various cultures during different time periods. <ref> Erickson, Clark L. 1988 \"Raised Field Agriculture in the Lake Titicaca Basin: Putting Ancient Agriculture Back to Work\".
