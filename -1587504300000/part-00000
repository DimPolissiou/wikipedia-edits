Clontarf has a range of commercial facilities in several locations, mainly centred on Vernon Avenue. It adjoins [[Fairview, Dublin|Fairview]], [[Marino, Dublin|Marino]], [[Killester]] and [[Raheny]], and is in the postal district [[Dublin 3]].  Clontarf is in the jurisdiction of [[Dublin City Council]]. \n\nClontarf is most famous for the [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014, in which [[Brian Boru]], High King of Ireland, defeated the [[Vikings]] of Dublin and their allies, the Irish of [[Leinster]]. This battle, which extended over a wide area, is seen as marking an end to the Irish-Viking Wars.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Cluain Tarbh'' means meadow of the bull. 'Cluain' being meadow and 'tarbh' meaning bull in Irish.\n\n==Geography==\nClontarf is on the northern side of Dublin city, northeast of the city centre, along the coast. It is bounded to the west and south by [[Fairview, Dublin|Fairview Park]] and the suburb of [[Marino, Dublin|Marino]], to the north by the suburbs of [[Killester]], [[Artane, Dublin|Artane]] and [[Coolock]] and to the northeast by [[Saint Anne's Park]] and the suburb of [[Raheny]]. The southern boundary of Clontarf lies on one side of the estuary of one of Dublin's three main rivers, the [[River Tolka]]. The Wad River, another of Dublin's secondary watercourses, joins the Tolka estuary right at the city end of Clontarf's coastline, while the [[Naniken River]] runs through St. Anne's Park and reaches the sea at the Raheny end of the district, its mouth marking the civil parish boundary between Clontarf and Raheny.  The district is fairly level, rising slightly inland.\n\n[[File:Night view, Clontarf.JPG|thumb|340px|The new lights on Clontarf seafront]]\n\n[[Bull Island]] - sometimes North Bull Island to distinguish it from the sandbank of the South Bull - also shared with Raheny, is connected to Clontarf at its northern end by a historic wooden bridge at [[Dollymount]]. While most of the island is city property, the (North) [[Bull Wall]] and breakwater, related road and path, and Bull (Wooden) Bridge belong to the Dublin Port Company and are closed for a day each year to assert this. At the end of the breakwater is a statue of ''Our Lady, Star of the Sea'' (''R\u00e9alt na Mara''), erected to watch over mariners and dockworkers.\n\n===Clontarf Island===\nThere used to be an island, called Clontarf Island, off the coast of Clontarf near the mouth of the Tolka, as shown on maps such as that of [[John Rocque]] in 1753,<ref>[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/aai-files/assets/ebooks/37%20The%20Neighbourhood%20of%20Dublin/37%20The%20Neighbourhood%20of%20Dublin.pdf The Neighbourhood of Dublin], Weston St. John Joyce, 1920</ref> with a single dwelling, and at some periods (notably in the 19th century), bathing facilities. The island was also used as a refuge from plague in 1650. Construction work on the [[Great South Wall]] and [[Bull Wall]] in [[Dublin Port]] changed the flow of water in [[Dublin Bay]], threatening its existence, though it was in fact eventually destroyed by a large storm in 1844.\n\n==Access==\nClontarf lies between the coastal and inland roads from Dublin to Howth, and its seafront is served by the 130, 104 and 32X bus routes, while the inland parts are covered by buses on the Howth Road, such as the 29A, 31 series and 32 series.  The area's historic railway station, on the Howth Road, closed many years ago, but a new railway station, [[Clontarf Road railway station]], the first stop north of the city centre on the [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit]] system, is located between Clontarf and Fairview.\n\n==History==\n[[File:'Battle of Clontarf', oil on canvas painting by Hugh Frazer, 1826.jpg|300px|thumb|oil painting of Battle of Clontarf by [[Hugh Frazer (artist)|Hugh Frazer]], 1826]]\nFollowing the defeat of the Vikings and the Leinstermen at the [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014, the High King of Ireland Brian Boru (Brian Boroimhe) is said to have been killed with a battle axe while he was found in prayer in his tent, by a Danish Viking named Brodu. So great was the fighting which ensured among competing kings afterwards that event that one analyst stated they, '...turned the country into a trembling sod.' Clontarf itself enjoyed relative peace for over 100 years until the arrival of the [[Normans]] in 1172. Shortly afterwards, Clontarf was granted to Adam de Pheypo, a follower of [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]]. He built the first Clontarf Castle.\n\nA settlement at Clontarf has been dated to at least the 12th century, and in the 19th century remains from earlier times were thought to have been found. Clontarf features on the 1598 map [http://www.wdl.org/en/item/104/zoom.html \"A Modern Depiction of Ireland, One of the British Isles\"] by [[Abraham Ortelius]] as \"Clantarfe\".\n\nThe manor and church of Clontarf were held by the [[Knights Templar|Templars]] and subsequently the [[Hospitallers]], and there was a Holy Well in the area, near what is now The Stiles Road, until recent times (another spring, named for Brian Boroimhe, of uncertain age, still exists, on Castle Avenue near the sea).\n\nA manor house and small associated village were located on the slight ridge overlooking the sea where the Clontarf Castle Hotel is now situated.  The manor house was rebuilt many times, with the current hotel dating largely to the early 19th century.  The [[tower house]] on the site is a 19th-century replica of the original Templar structure on the site.  The adjoining ruined church is the old [[Church of Ireland]] parish church, dates to the mid-17th century and includes what may be the earliest use of red brick in Ireland.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n[[File:clontarf Castle - geograph.org.uk - 395705.jpg|thumb|Clontarf Castle]]\n[[Clontarf Castle]] was burned in 1641 by the Governor of Dublin, [[Sir Charles Coote, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Coote]], apparently in revenge for the disloyalty of the then owner, George King. The castle, estate and district were given in 1649 by [[Oliver Cromwell]] to John Blackwell, who assigned his interest to [[John Vernon (of Clontarf)|John Vernon]], [[Quartermaster-General]] of Cromwell's army in Ireland, although this is described in Lewis's Topographical Dictionary of 1837 as \u201cconferred by the Crown on Admiral Vernon\u201d. The [[Vernon family]] subsequently occupied the Castle for nearly three hundred and fifty years. See [[Clontarf Castle]] (the section '''After Cromwell''') for further details.\n\nIn 1659, the population of Clontarf was 79.\n\nFishing, oyster-catching and farming remained the main occupations over the following centuries, with a major fish-curing industry at ''the Sheds'', near the foot of Vernon Avenue (the Public House at the site still bears the name), around 1&nbsp;km from the original village. In the 18th century, this developed into a secondary settlement, of fishermen and small farmers, living in basic cabins and with drying sheds for the fish.  It is prominently marked on navigation maps for Dublin Bay dating to the 18th century.  However, as with many such 'informal' settlements in Ireland, ''Clontarf Sheds'' became the site for a 19th-century Roman Catholic church - the [[Clontarf Church of Ireland|Church of Ireland]] St. John's Church, and the Roman Catholic St. Anthony's are closer to the original settlement - and then outgrew the original village.\n\nThe 1837 Lewis report remarked that \u201c The land in this Parish is reported to be in the very highest state of cultivation...\u201d\n\n=== The 19th century ===\nIn the early 19th century, Clontarf had become a popular ''holiday resort'' for the citizens of Dublin, who came out from the city to enjoy bathing in the sea or in the hot and cold seawater baths erected by Mr. Brierly. A horse omnibus service from the city was started and Clontarf became a fashionable place to live - Samuel Lewis lists twenty-seven major houses, apart from Clontarf Castle, in which resided wealthy and important gentry.<ref group=\"nb\">Among them were Thomas Gresham, founder of the [[Gresham Hotel]] and W.C. Colville, owner of  major property holdings in the centre of Dublin</ref> The Confirmation list for 1824 includes four titled ladies \u2013 Lady Charlemont, Lady Caroline Clements, Lady Maria Caulfield and Lady Emily Caulfield.\n\n[[File:Dublin 1901 NE B.png|thumb|300px|right|Clontarf and nearby districts, 1901]]\n\nClontarf had an important role in the career of the prominent Irish nationalist leader [[Daniel O'Connell]] who sought to hold on this location, symbolic because of its association with the [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014, a mass meeting calling for [[Repeal (Ireland)|repeal]] of the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]]. The meeting was banned by then-[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], Sir [[Robert Peel]], and despite appeals from his supporters, O'Connell refused to defy the authorities and he called off the meeting, as he was unwilling to risk bloodshed.\n\nA key arrival at Clontarf was Sir [[Benjamin Lee Guinness]], son of [[Arthur Guinness (1768\u20131855)|Arthur Guinness II]] and his partner in running the brewery, who purchased various lands in Clontarf and Raheny, combining them to form St. Anne's Estate (the remnants of which form [[Saint Anne's Park]]).\n\nBy the late 19th century Clontarf was becoming urbanised, initially as a holiday resort for wealthy Dubliners, but rapidly as a suburb of the city.  A tram line was laid along the coast, increasing activity in the area.\n\nFor a time, Clontarf was an '''Urban District''' incorporated in its own right but lost this formal status at the start of the 20th century. By the mid-20th century, it was fully absorbed into the city and would now be considered part of the inner suburbs.\n\n==Amenities==\n[[File:Clontarf Road, Clontarf, Dublin - geograph.org.uk - 347164.jpg|thumb|Easter Island statue on Clontarf promenade]]\n[[File:Clontarf Park Gates.tif|thumb|212x212px|St Annes Park in Clontarf]]\nClontarf's most notable amenity is its seafront, with a promenade running continuously from Alfie Byrne Road to the wooden bridge at Dollymount. The seafront remains a highly popular spot for runners, walkers, sailors and cyclists. Among the features of the promenade is an [[Easter Island]] [[Moai]] replica statue, a diplomatic gift from the ambassador of [[Chile]], which is located just across the road from The Sheds pub.  \n\nAlso on the promenade is Clontarf's privately owned open-air seawater swimming pool, once a popular recreational destination with hot and cold baths, closed in 1996, then becoming derelict. But in 2017 it was redeveloped with a restaurant and bar<ref>{{cite web|title=The Baths|url=http://www.thabaths.ie/|website=Clontarf Baths|publisher=Clontarf Baths|accessdate=10 May 2018|ref=OfficialSite}}</ref> open to the public within licensed hours. Originally scheduled to open in autumn 2017, it eventually did so in February 2018, but it was announced in January 2018 that public-access swimming would not initially be offered, only, under certain conditions, swimming for clubs, unless a six-figure public subsidy was made available.<ref>Dublin: The Irish Times, 24 January 2018</ref> The city council noted that this might breach planning conditions, as the substantial development on the publicly owned promenade was approved on an assumption of public swimming potential.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Olivia|title=Clontarf baths may breach planning rules|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/clontarf-baths-may-breach-planning-rules-1.3434191|website=The Irish Times|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=10 May 2018|ref=IT_Mar18|quote=In 2012, permission was granted for the current development, on condition the restaurant \u201cremains subsidiary to the main use of the site for swimming\u201d and \u201cshall be operated in conjunction with the swimming pool\u201d.}}</ref>\n\nThere is also a public slipway, across the road from the Clontarf Yacht and Boat Club clubhouse.\n\nClontarf also reaches into [[Saint Anne's Park]], which it shares with [[Raheny]]. As well as extensive walks and green areas, the park contains numerous sporting facilities, such as playing pitches and non-sport amenities. These include an Arts Centre in the Red Stables, featuring artists' stores and studios, a coffee shop and markets on some weekends, along with a large rose garden which is located alongside the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] pitches.\n\nClontarf also has access to the [[North Bull Island]] at the area known as [[Dollymount]]. The island contains the amenity of Dollymount Strand as well as two golf courses. The island is also famous for its wildlife, and the lagoon and mudflats between the island and the mainland is a favourite spot for birdwatching.\n\nClontarf is home to a wide range of businesses, many of which are members of the local Chamber of Commerce. There is a supermarket on Vernon Avenue, and there are, for example, a number of public houses, restaurants, convenience stores, bank branches, pharmacies and medical practitioners.\n\n==Schools==\nLocal primary schools are Belgrove National School (NS), Greenlanes NS (Church of Ireland) and Howth Road Mixed NS (Presbyterian).  All of these have \"junior\" and \"senior\" departments. \n\nAt second level, the area is served by Holy Faith School (for girls), [[Belvedere College|Belvedere College S.J.]] (for boys), [[St. Paul's College, Raheny]] (boys) as well as the mixed [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]].\n\nSpecial education facilities exist at the premises of the Central Remedial Clinic and the Irish Wheelchair Association.\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Methodist Church, Clontarf - geograph.org.uk - 695959.jpg|thumb|200px|Methodist Church, Clontarf]]\nClontarf today has three Roman Catholic parishes (for more see [[Parish of Clontarf (Roman Catholic)]]), a [[Church of Ireland Parish of Clontarf]], a [http://clontarfchurch.org/ Presbyterian congregation] and a [[Methodist Church in Ireland|Methodist]] parish.\n\nHistorically Clontarf has had a strong Protestant community for many years, with the Church of Ireland parish being one of the most populated Anglican parishes in the country up to the 1950s. In the 1911 census, 39% of the population of Clontarf were Protestant, 25% being [[Church of Ireland]], 8.5% Presbyterian and 5.5% Methodist. Relations between all the faith communities have always been good in Clontarf and mixed marriages were part of life even in 1911.\n\n==Sport and social organisations==\n[[File:Rugby match,.jpg|thumbnail|250px|[[rugby football|Rugby]] and [[cricket]] as well as [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) and [[Association Football|soccer]] are popular in the suburb, here we see a Clontarf rugby team compete in red and blue stripes (colours shared by various Clontarf sporting organisations), with Clontarf cricket club in the background]]Clontarf has many clubs whose members take part in sporting activities, including [[rugby football|rugby]], [[Association Football|soccer]], [[golf]], [[cricket]], [[sailing]] and [[Gaelic games]].\n\nClontarf has a strong rugby club, their senior XV reaching two all Ireland league finals under former coach Phil Werahiko. The [[Clontarf Cricket Club Ground]], based at the same premises as the rugby club, was the host for the final of the [[2005 ICC Trophy]] cricket tournament. It has hosted various cricket internationals, most recently against Australia in the summer of 2010, and is the home ground of the [[Ireland cricket team]] in the Republic of Ireland.  Ireland are due to play another ODI against England in August 2011 at the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketeurope4.net/CRICKETEUROPE/DATABASE/GROUNDS/IRELAND/clontarf.shtml |title=Ireland international cricket grounds: Castle Avenue |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520190449/http://www.cricketeurope4.net/CRICKETEUROPE/DATABASE/GROUNDS/IRELAND/clontarf.shtml |archivedate=2009-05-20 }} Retrieved on 17&nbsp; December 2008.</ref>\n\nThe Clontarf Cricket Club senior 1st XI have won the Leinster Senior Cup in 2007 and 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clontarfcricket.com |title=Clontarf Cricket Club}} Retrieved on 17&nbsp; December 2008.</ref>\n\nClontarf is home to a number of GAA clubs that compete in the Dublin county championship in Gaelic football, ladies football, hurling and camogie.

It moved to St. Pauls College, Sybil Hill Road, Raheny,  in 1975 when the old pavilion was burnt down.\n\nAlong the coastal promenade, there is a circular rain shelter, which forms a cap over a former lead mine, which ran out under the shallow waters of the bay, as recorded in Cosgrave's \"North Dublin\"; it was closed due to persistent flooding.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}\n*[[Bram Stoker]], author of ''[[Dracula]]'', was born at 15 [[Marino Crescent]] in 1847.\n*[[John Rawson, Viscount Clontarf]], a leading statesman in the reign of [[Henry VIII]] and last Prior of the [[Order of St. John of Jerusalem]]\n*Sir [[Patrick White (judge)|Patrick White]],  High Court judge and the principal landowner here in the 1540s and 1550s\n*Members of the Boland family, including Irish revolutionaries [[Harry Boland]] and [[Gerald Boland]], also lived at 15 Marino Crescent in the early 20th century.\n*[[Bank of Ireland]]'s former Chief Executive, [[Richie Boucher]]\n*Former Dublin Lord Mayor [[Gerry Breen]]\n*Aid worker [[Sharon Commins]], who was kidnapped in [[Sudan]] in July 2009, was born and lived in Clontarf.\n*Actress [[Maria Doyle]] was born in Clontarf on 25 September 1964.\n*[[Joe Duffy]], of RT\u00c9\n*Hollywood actors [[Barry Fitzgerald]] (real name William Shields) and his brother, [[Arthur Shields]], lived at no. 13 Vernon Avenue.\n*Fiddler [[Paddy Glackin]]\n<!-- Duplicated below: *[[Maureen Potter]] was a long-term resident -->\n*[[Mezzo-soprano]] [[Bernadette Greevy]]\n*[[Arthur Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun |Arthur Edward Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun]], of Guinness brewing fame, was born in St. Anne's House (the house lies in the Clontarf part of the estate, while the majority of the park is in Raheny), as was his elder brother [[Edward Cecil Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh]].\n*[[Cian Healy]], Irish Rugby International\n*Film director [[Neil Jordan]] (although he was born in [[Rosses Point]], Co.

Clontarf has a range of commercial facilities in several locations, mainly centred on Vernon Avenue. It adjoins [[Fairview, Dublin|Fairview]], [[Marino, Dublin|Marino]], [[Killester]] and [[Raheny]], and is in the postal district [[Dublin 3]].  Clontarf is in the jurisdiction of [[Dublin City Council]]. \n\nClontarf is most famous for the [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014, in which [[Brian Boru]], High King of Ireland, defeated the [[Vikings]] of Dublin and their allies, the Irish of [[Leinster]]. This battle, which extended over a wide area, is seen as marking an end to the Irish-Viking Wars.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Cluain Tarbh'' means meadow of the bull. 'Cluain' being meadow and 'tarbh' meaning bull in Irish.\n\n==Geography==\nClontarf is on the northern side of Dublin city, northeast of the city centre, along the coast. It is bounded to the west and south by [[Fairview, Dublin|Fairview Park]] and the suburb of [[Marino, Dublin|Marino]], to the north by the suburbs of [[Killester]], [[Artane, Dublin|Artane]] and [[Coolock]] and to the northeast by [[Saint Anne's Park]] and the suburb of [[Raheny]]. The southern boundary of Clontarf lies on one side of the estuary of one of Dublin's three main rivers, the [[River Tolka]]. The Wad River, another of Dublin's secondary watercourses, joins the Tolka estuary right at the city end of Clontarf's coastline, while the [[Naniken River]] runs through St. Anne's Park and reaches the sea at the Raheny end of the district, its mouth marking the civil parish boundary between Clontarf and Raheny.  The district is fairly level, rising slightly inland.\n\n[[File:Night view, Clontarf.JPG|thumb|340px|The new lights on Clontarf seafront]]\n\n[[Bull Island]] - sometimes North Bull Island to distinguish it from the sandbank of the South Bull - also shared with Raheny, is connected to Clontarf at its northern end by a historic wooden bridge at [[Dollymount]]. While most of the island is city property, the (North) [[Bull Wall]] and breakwater, related road and path, and Bull (Wooden) Bridge belong to the Dublin Port Company and are closed for a day each year to assert this. At the end of the breakwater is a statue of ''Our Lady, Star of the Sea'' (''R\u00e9alt na Mara''), erected to watch over mariners and dockworkers.\n\n===Clontarf Island===\nThere used to be an island, called Clontarf Island, off the coast of Clontarf near the mouth of the Tolka, as shown on maps such as that of [[John Rocque]] in 1753,<ref>[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/aai-files/assets/ebooks/37%20The%20Neighbourhood%20of%20Dublin/37%20The%20Neighbourhood%20of%20Dublin.pdf The Neighbourhood of Dublin], Weston St. John Joyce, 1920</ref> with a single dwelling, and at some periods (notably in the 19th century), bathing facilities. The island was also used as a refuge from plague in 1650. Construction work on the [[Great South Wall]] and [[Bull Wall]] in [[Dublin Port]] changed the flow of water in [[Dublin Bay]], threatening its existence, though it was in fact eventually destroyed by a large storm in 1844.\n\n==Access==\nClontarf lies between the coastal and inland roads from Dublin to Howth, and its seafront is served by the 130, 104 and 32X bus routes, while the inland parts are covered by buses on the Howth Road, such as the 29A, 31 series and 32 series.  The area's historic railway station, on the Howth Road, closed many years ago, but a new railway station, [[Clontarf Road railway station]], the first stop north of the city centre on the [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit]] system, is located between Clontarf and Fairview.\n\n==History==\n[[File:'Battle of Clontarf', oil on canvas painting by Hugh Frazer, 1826.jpg|300px|thumb|oil painting of Battle of Clontarf by [[Hugh Frazer (artist)|Hugh Frazer]], 1826]]\nFollowing the defeat of the Vikings and the Leinstermen at the [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014, the High King of Ireland Brian Boru (Brian Boroimhe) is said to have been killed with a battle axe while he was found in prayer in his tent, by a Danish Viking named Brodu. So great was the fighting which ensured among competing kings afterwards that event that one analyst stated they, '...turned the country into a trembling sod.' Clontarf itself enjoyed relative peace for over 100 years until the arrival of the [[Normans]] in 1172. Shortly afterwards, Clontarf was granted to Adam de Pheypo, a follower of [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]]. He built the first Clontarf Castle.\n\nA settlement at Clontarf has been dated to at least the 12th century, and in the 19th century remains from earlier times were thought to have been found. Clontarf features on the 1598 map [http://www.wdl.org/en/item/104/zoom.html \"A Modern Depiction of Ireland, One of the British Isles\"] by [[Abraham Ortelius]] as \"Clantarfe\".\n\nThe manor and church of Clontarf were held by the [[Knights Templar|Templars]] and subsequently the [[Hospitallers]], and there was a Holy Well in the area, near what is now The Stiles Road, until recent times (another spring, named for Brian Boroimhe, of uncertain age, still exists, on Castle Avenue near the sea).\n\nA manor house and small associated village were located on the slight ridge overlooking the sea where the Clontarf Castle Hotel is now situated.  The manor house was rebuilt many times, with the current hotel dating largely to the early 19th century.  The [[tower house]] on the site is a 19th-century replica of the original Templar structure on the site.  The adjoining ruined church is the old [[Church of Ireland]] parish church, dates to the mid-17th century and includes what may be the earliest use of red brick in Ireland.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n[[File:clontarf Castle - geograph.org.uk - 395705.jpg|thumb|Clontarf Castle]]\n[[Clontarf Castle]] was burned in 1641 by the Governor of Dublin, [[Sir Charles Coote, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Coote]], apparently in revenge for the disloyalty of the then owner, George King. The castle, estate and district were given in 1649 by [[Oliver Cromwell]] to John Blackwell, who assigned his interest to [[John Vernon (of Clontarf)|John Vernon]], [[Quartermaster-General]] of Cromwell's army in Ireland, although this is described in Lewis's Topographical Dictionary of 1837 as \u201cconferred by the Crown on Admiral Vernon\u201d. The [[Vernon family]] subsequently occupied the Castle for nearly three hundred and fifty years. See [[Clontarf Castle]] (the section '''After Cromwell''') for further details.\n\nIn 1659, the population of Clontarf was 79.\n\nFishing, oyster-catching and farming remained the main occupations over the following centuries, with a major fish-curing industry at ''the Sheds'', near the foot of Vernon Avenue (the Public House at the site still bears the name), around 1&nbsp;km from the original village. In the 18th century, this developed into a secondary settlement, of fishermen and small farmers, living in basic cabins and with drying sheds for the fish.  It is prominently marked on navigation maps for Dublin Bay dating to the 18th century.  However, as with many such 'informal' settlements in Ireland, ''Clontarf Sheds'' became the site for a 19th-century Roman Catholic church - the [[Clontarf Church of Ireland|Church of Ireland]] St. John's Church, and the Roman Catholic St. Anthony's are closer to the original settlement - and then outgrew the original village.\n\nThe 1837 Lewis report remarked that \u201c The land in this Parish is reported to be in the very highest state of cultivation...\u201d\n\n=== The 19th century ===\nIn the early 19th century, Clontarf had become a popular ''holiday resort'' for the citizens of Dublin, who came out from the city to enjoy bathing in the sea or in the hot and cold seawater baths erected by Mr. Brierly. A horse omnibus service from the city was started and Clontarf became a fashionable place to live - Samuel Lewis lists twenty-seven major houses, apart from Clontarf Castle, in which resided wealthy and important gentry.<ref group=\"nb\">Among them were Thomas Gresham, founder of the [[Gresham Hotel]] and W.C. Colville, owner of  major property holdings in the centre of Dublin</ref> The Confirmation list for 1824 includes four titled ladies \u2013 Lady Charlemont, Lady Caroline Clements, Lady Maria Caulfield and Lady Emily Caulfield.\n\n[[File:Dublin 1901 NE B.png|thumb|300px|right|Clontarf and nearby districts, 1901]]\n\nClontarf had an important role in the career of the prominent Irish nationalist leader [[Daniel O'Connell]] who sought to hold on this location, symbolic because of its association with the [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014, a mass meeting calling for [[Repeal (Ireland)|repeal]] of the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]]. The meeting was banned by then-[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], Sir [[Robert Peel]], and despite appeals from his supporters, O'Connell refused to defy the authorities and he called off the meeting, as he was unwilling to risk bloodshed.\n\nA key arrival at Clontarf was Sir [[Benjamin Lee Guinness]], son of [[Arthur Guinness (1768\u20131855)|Arthur Guinness II]] and his partner in running the brewery, who purchased various lands in Clontarf and Raheny, combining them to form St. Anne's Estate (the remnants of which form [[Saint Anne's Park]]).\n\nBy the late 19th century Clontarf was becoming urbanised, initially as a holiday resort for wealthy Dubliners, but rapidly as a suburb of the city.  A tram line was laid along the coast, increasing activity in the area.\n\nFor a time, Clontarf was an '''Urban District''' incorporated in its own right but lost this formal status at the start of the 20th century. By the mid-20th century, it was fully absorbed into the city and would now be considered part of the inner suburbs.\n\n==Amenities==\n[[File:Clontarf Road, Clontarf, Dublin - geograph.org.uk - 347164.jpg|thumb|Easter Island statue on Clontarf promenade]]\n[[File:Clontarf Park Gates.tif|thumb|212x212px|St Annes Park in Clontarf]]\nClontarf's most notable amenity is its seafront, with a promenade running continuously from Alfie Byrne Road to the wooden bridge at Dollymount. The seafront remains a highly popular spot for runners, walkers, sailors and cyclists. Among the features of the promenade is an [[Easter Island]] [[Moai]] replica statue, a diplomatic gift from the ambassador of [[Chile]], which is located just across the road from The Sheds pub.  \n\nAlso on the promenade is Clontarf's privately owned open-air seawater swimming pool, once a popular recreational destination with hot and cold baths, closed in 1996, then becoming derelict. But in 2017 it was redeveloped with a restaurant and bar<ref>{{cite web|title=The Baths|url=http://www.thabaths.ie/|website=Clontarf Baths|publisher=Clontarf Baths|accessdate=10 May 2018|ref=OfficialSite}}</ref> open to the public within licensed hours. Originally scheduled to open in autumn 2017, it eventually did so in February 2018, but it was announced in January 2018 that public-access swimming would not initially be offered, only, under certain conditions, swimming for clubs, unless a six-figure public subsidy was made available.<ref>Dublin: The Irish Times, 24 January 2018</ref> The city council noted that this might breach planning conditions, as the substantial development on the publicly owned promenade was approved on an assumption of public swimming potential.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Olivia|title=Clontarf baths may breach planning rules|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/clontarf-baths-may-breach-planning-rules-1.3434191|website=The Irish Times|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=10 May 2018|ref=IT_Mar18|quote=In 2012, permission was granted for the current development, on condition the restaurant \u201cremains subsidiary to the main use of the site for swimming\u201d and \u201cshall be operated in conjunction with the swimming pool\u201d.}}</ref>\n\nThere is also a public slipway, across the road from the Clontarf Yacht and Boat Club clubhouse.\n\nClontarf also reaches into [[Saint Anne's Park]], which it shares with [[Raheny]]. As well as extensive walks and green areas, the park contains numerous sporting facilities, such as playing pitches and non-sport amenities. These include an Arts Centre in the Red Stables, featuring artists' stores and studios, a coffee shop and markets on some weekends, along with a large rose garden which is located alongside the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] pitches.\n\nClontarf also has access to the [[North Bull Island]] at the area known as [[Dollymount]]. The island contains the amenity of Dollymount Strand as well as two golf courses. The island is also famous for its wildlife, and the lagoon and mudflats between the island and the mainland is a favourite spot for birdwatching.\n\nClontarf is home to a wide range of businesses, many of which are members of the local Chamber of Commerce. There is a supermarket on Vernon Avenue, and there are, for example, a number of public houses, restaurants, convenience stores, bank branches, pharmacies and medical practitioners.\n\n==Schools==\nLocal primary schools are Belgrove National School (NS), Greenlanes NS (Church of Ireland) and Howth Road Mixed NS (Presbyterian).  All of these have \"junior\" and \"senior\" departments. \n\nAt second level, the area is served by Holy Faith School (for girls), [[Belvedere College|Belvedere College S.J.]] (for boys), [[St. Paul's College, Raheny]] (boys) as well as the mixed [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]].\n\nSpecial education facilities exist at the premises of the Central Remedial Clinic and the Irish Wheelchair Association.\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Methodist Church, Clontarf - geograph.org.uk - 695959.jpg|thumb|200px|Methodist Church, Clontarf]]\nClontarf today has three Roman Catholic parishes (for more see [[Parish of Clontarf (Roman Catholic)]]), a [[Church of Ireland Parish of Clontarf]], a [http://clontarfchurch.org/ Presbyterian congregation] and a [[Methodist Church in Ireland|Methodist]] parish.\n\nHistorically Clontarf has had a strong Protestant community for many years, with the Church of Ireland parish being one of the most populated Anglican parishes in the country up to the 1950s. In the 1911 census, 39% of the population of Clontarf were Protestant, 25% being [[Church of Ireland]], 8.5% Presbyterian and 5.5% Methodist. Relations between all the faith communities have always been good in Clontarf and mixed marriages were part of life even in 1911.\n\n==Sport and social organisations==\n[[File:Rugby match,.jpg|thumbnail|250px|[[rugby football|Rugby]] and [[cricket]] as well as [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) and [[Association Football|soccer]] are popular in the suburb, here we see a Clontarf rugby team compete in red and blue stripes (colours shared by various Clontarf sporting organisations), with Clontarf cricket club in the background]]Clontarf has many clubs whose members take part in sporting activities, including [[rugby football|rugby]], [[Association Football|soccer]], [[golf]], [[cricket]], [[sailing]] and [[Gaelic games]].\n\nClontarf has a strong rugby club, their senior XV reaching two all Ireland league finals under former coach Phil Werahiko. The [[Clontarf Cricket Club Ground]], based at the same premises as the rugby club, was the host for the final of the [[2005 ICC Trophy]] cricket tournament. It has hosted various cricket internationals, most recently against Australia in the summer of 2010, and is the home ground of the [[Ireland cricket team]] in the Republic of Ireland.

Gilbert, who also appears on Movie Fights. Other writers include Dan Murrell (which ultimately left after the Honest Trailer for ''Cats''), Joe Starr, Danielle Radford, and Lon Harris.\n\n===''The Screen Junkies Show''===\nThe Screen Junkies Show covers a variety of topics in film and television. Some episodes include interviews with actors, \"supercuts\" (compilations), and information and updates on movies. The Screen Junkies Show is hosted by Hal Rudnick.\n\n===''Movie Fights''===\n{{See also|List of Movie Fights episodes}}\"Movie Fights\", typically hosted by Rudnick, features debates between three other people within or outside of Screen Junkies, such as other YouTube reviewers, on various movie-related questions. This segment lasts for about an hour and a half, with the first five rounds being a roundtable debate, and the last round being a \"Speed Round\". Each round would begin with a question, and each contestant would have to make an argument for why their answer is best. The speed round consists of five questions, and each contestant has fifteen seconds to make a claim for their answer and ten seconds to give their rebuttal against their opponent. When a contestant wins a round or speedrun question, they win a point and the person who finishes the game with the most points wins. In the match titled \"Ultimate Game of Thrones Spin-off Movie?\" posted on April 12, 2015, Murrell became the first ever Movie Fights Champion after winning the first ever title bout, a position held until July 13, 2017 when he lost a \"Showstopper\" competition to Spencer Gilbert immediately after retaining the Belt in a tournament fight. To become the next Movie Fights champion, a contestant is required either to defeat the current champion in a title bout match which occurs if the current champion wishes to \"put the belt on the line\", or win the special \"Last Man Standing\" fight where multiple contestants fight in a knock out format to win the \"Showstopper\", a box with 5 speedround questions, so that the contestant can challenge the current champion to a speedround match using the speedround questions found inside the \"Showstopper\".\n\nMovie Fights returned on December 14, 2017 with a new format and Hal Rudnick hosting. The new format had two fighters instead of three and three judges instead of one. On March 29, the three fighter format returned, but the three judges remain.\n\n===Screen Junkies Plus===\nDuring the 56th episode of Movie Fights, which aired on November 18, 2015, new premium shows were announced to be available through screenjunkies.com or an app for a monthly fee of $4.99 with a free 3-month trial and other package options. Upon its initial release, more than ten original shows were available through Screen Junkies Plus, including ''Interns of F.I.E.L.D.'', their first scripted series.\n\nIn addition, their YouTube shows, including the Screen Junkies Show and Honest Trailers, are available through the platform, with each episode of Movie Fights also streaming live each Thursday before its Saturday YouTube release. Several cast members, notably Alicia Malone and new producer Ken Napzok had previously worked for the Schmoes Know network, Napzok as a producer and Malone as a presenter, as the Schmoes and the Screen Junkies often work together, with numerous members of the Schmoes Know team appear on Movie Fights.\n\nOn the February 3, 2016 episode of Screen Junkies Universe, Hector Navarro was announced as the host of a new show Knocking Dead (start date Monday, February 8, 2016), which would have more of a balance of praise and criticism for the TV show \"Walking Dead\" than the show has been given thus far. The show focused on the second half of season 6.\nThis slot was later used in April through June for the show Watching Thrones, a commentary on \"Game of Thrones\" season 6, hosted by Ken Napzok, Michele Boyd, and Spencer Gilbert and a rotating guest host, with Trisha Hershberger later becoming a regular.\nStarting July 7 (Thursday), a similar style show was introduced critiquing the second season of USA's \"Mr. Robot\" (Debugging Mr. Robot).\n\nOn the April 25, 2016 episode of Mundy Night Raw, Dan Murrell announced that a hiatus after the episode, and that he would begin a show of his own in which he'd review films. Summer Movie Report with co-host Sasha Perl-Raver debuted on May 9. Following the conclusion of Summer Movie Report, it was announced Dan would host a new movie review show called Dan's Labyrinth, which premiered on November 7.\n\nOn the 86th episode of Movie Fights (YouTube airdate June 4, 2016), it was announced that winner Matt Raub would be hosting a new weekly show Gamer Fights, which premiered on Friday, June 17. The show is created in collaboration with Smosh Games, and once a month, an episode will be available through the Smosh Games website. The first six episodes were pre-recorded.

Gilbert, who also appears on Movie Fights. Other writers include Dan Murrell (which ultimately left after the Honest Trailer for ''Cats''), Joe Starr, Danielle Radford, and Lon Harris.\n\n===''The Screen Junkies Show''===\nThe Screen Junkies Show covers a variety of topics in film and television. Some episodes include interviews with actors, \"supercuts\" (compilations), and information and updates on movies. The Screen Junkies Show is hosted by Hal Rudnick.\n\n===''Movie Fights''===\n{{See also|List of Movie Fights episodes}}\"Movie Fights\", typically hosted by Rudnik, features debates between three other people within or outside of Screen Junkies, such as other YouTube reviewers, on various movie-related questions. This segment lasts for about an hour and a half, with the first five rounds being a roundtable debate, and the last round being a \"Speed Round\". Each round would begin with a question, and each contestant would have to make an argument for why their answer is best. The speed round consists of five questions, and each contestant has fifteen seconds to make a claim for their answer and ten seconds to give their rebuttal against their opponent. When a contestant wins a round or speedrun question, they win a point and the person who finishes the game with the most points wins. In the match titled \"Ultimate Game of Thrones Spin-off Movie?\" posted on April 12, 2015, Murrell became the first ever Movie Fights Champion after winning the first ever title bout, a position held until July 13, 2017 when he lost a \"Showstopper\" competition to Spencer Gilbert immediately after retaining the Belt in a tournament fight. To become the next Movie Fights champion, a contestant is required either to defeat the current champion in a title bout match which occurs if the current champion wishes to \"put the belt on the line\", or win the special \"Last Man Standing\" fight where multiple contestants fight in a knock out format to win the \"Showstopper\", a box with 5 speedround questions, so that the contestant can challenge the current champion to a speedround match using the speedround questions found inside the \"Showstopper\".\n\nMovie Fights returned on December 14, 2017 with a new format and Hal Rudnick hosting. The new format had two fighters instead of three and three judges instead of one. On March 29, the three fighter format returned, but the three judges remain.\n\n===Screen Junkies Plus===\nDuring the 56th episode of Movie Fights, which aired on November 18, 2015, new premium shows were announced to be available through screenjunkies.com or an app for a monthly fee of $4.99 with a free 3-month trial and other package options. Upon its initial release, more than ten original shows were available through Screen Junkies Plus, including ''Interns of F.I.E.L.D.'', their first scripted series.\n\nIn addition, their YouTube shows, including the Screen Junkies Show and Honest Trailers, are available through the platform, with each episode of Movie Fights also streaming live each Thursday before its Saturday YouTube release. Several cast members, notably Alicia Malone and new producer Ken Napzok had previously worked for the Schmoes Know network, Napzok as a producer and Malone as a presenter, as the Schmoes and the Screen Junkies often work together, with numerous members of the Schmoes Know team appear on Movie Fights.\n\nOn the February 3, 2016 episode of Screen Junkies Universe, Hector Navarro was announced as the host of a new show Knocking Dead (start date Monday, February 8, 2016), which would have more of a balance of praise and criticism for the TV show \"Walking Dead\" than the show has been given thus far. The show focused on the second half of season 6.\nThis slot was later used in April through June for the show Watching Thrones, a commentary on \"Game of Thrones\" season 6, hosted by Ken Napzok, Michele Boyd, and Spencer Gilbert and a rotating guest host, with Trisha Hershberger later becoming a regular.\nStarting July 7 (Thursday), a similar style show was introduced critiquing the second season of USA's \"Mr. Robot\" (Debugging Mr. Robot).\n\nOn the April 25, 2016 episode of Mundy Night Raw, Dan Murrell announced that a hiatus after the episode, and that he would begin a show of his own in which he'd review films. Summer Movie Report with co-host Sasha Perl-Raver debuted on May 9. Following the conclusion of Summer Movie Report, it was announced Dan would host a new movie review show called Dan's Labyrinth, which premiered on November 7.\n\nOn the 86th episode of Movie Fights (YouTube airdate June 4, 2016), it was announced that winner Matt Raub would be hosting a new weekly show Gamer Fights, which premiered on Friday, June 17. The show is created in collaboration with Smosh Games, and once a month, an episode will be available through the Smosh Games website. The first six episodes were pre-recorded. Additionally, Honest Game Trailers would be aired on Screen Junkies Plus along with Honest Game Trailers Commentaries.\n\nIn addition to their original series, Screen Junkies Plus also featured occasional special content, including Extended Editions of their Honest Trailers, a 2015 holiday special, and a Movie Fights two year anniversary retrospective special.\n\nOn July 5, 2017 during Screen Junkies Universe, it was announced that the service will be going free with shows airing on [[YouTube]] spread over their two channels. Content will still be uploaded to their [http://screenjunkies.com website] until August 5, 2017.\n\nProduction of all of the Screen Junkies Plus shows halted in late 2017, and in April, 2018, screenjunkies.com was removed.\n\n===''Millennial Falcon''===\nOn 19 September 2016 Screen Junkies announced that Roth Cornet would lead an open search for a new presenter.<ref name=\"auto\"/> YouTuber Jenny Nicholson was chosen to present Millennial Falcon, 'a deep dive into the Star Wars universe, all things Disney, breaking news, and all of the geeky minutia in between'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenjunkies.com/shows/millenial-falcon|title=Millenial Falcon|website=ScreenJunkies|accessdate=24 October 2017}}</ref> The first episode appeared on 8 April 2017 on Screen Junkies News.

With Overstock, Byrne contends that the company's longstanding appearance on the Regulation SHO Threshold Security list, an SEC-mandated list showing companies with a high number of \"fails to deliver\", along with high trading volumes that sometimes surpass total quantity of the company's stock, establish that it has been targeted by this practice.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS189862+27-Dec-2007+PRN20071227|first=Kirstie|last=Burden|title=Overstock Reappears on the Regulation SHO Threshold List|agency=Reuters|date=December 27, 2007|accessdate=March 22, 2008|work=[[PR Newswire]]}}</ref> Byrne's campaign has been controversial, including criticism in the financial press that Byrne is seeking to divert attention from Overstock's share price declines and failure to turn a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]].<ref name=\"Antilla\">{{cite news|first=Susan|last=Antilla|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&sid=aLDKLcXDf9PU&refer=columnist_antilla|title=Overstock Blames with Creepy Strategy|date=February 21, 2007|accessdate=March 22, 2008|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]}}</ref> New York Times columnist [[Joseph Nocera]] has said in 2006 that, \"Except for a few fellow-traveling Web sites, where Mr. Byrne is viewed as a heroic figure, most people who understand the issue or have looked into it think it's pretty bogus.\"<ref name=\"nocera\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/10/business/10nocera.html|title=New Crusade for Master of Overstock|date=June 10, 2006|accessdate=March 22, 2008|first=Joe|last=Nocera|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Others have suggested that the problem is real, but that the SEC acts to prevent it and that it does not happen on any scale such as Byrne suggests.
