{"title_page": "Historicity of King Arthur", "text_new": "[[File:KingArthurTombsite.jpg|thumb|The site of Arthur's purported grave in \"[[Avalon]]\" at [[Glastonbury Abbey]]]]\nThe '''historicity of King Arthur''' was debated among historians as recently as the 1970s. The academic consensus today is that is that while there is no solid evidence for the historical existence of the [[King Arthur]], as the history [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] told in his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' is false, there was almost certainly an actual Arthur who inspired the who inspired the mythological and folkloric figure of [[Arthurian Legend]].<ref>Mark, Joshua J. \"The Historical King Arthur.\" Ancient History Encyclopedia.

He develops into a legendary figure in the [[Matter of Britain]] from the 12th century, following Geoffrey of Monmouth's influential ''Historia Regum Britanniae''.\n\nRecent theories concerning a possible historical identity of Arthur include Art\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in, a son of the 6th-century [[D\u00e1l Riata]] king [[\u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in]]; [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]], who led a [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] resistance against the Saxons; [[Lucius Artorius Castus]], a 2nd-century Roman commander of [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] cavalry; the British king [[Riothamus]], who fought alongside the last [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] commanders against the [[Visigoths]] in an expedition to [[Gaul]] in the 5th century; or a composite of any of these people as well as other figures and myths.\n\n\n== Etymology of \"Arthur\" ==\n{{Main|Arthur}}\n\nThe origin of the name Arthur is unclear.

''*Arto-r\u012bg-ios'' is unattested, but the root ''*arto-r\u012bg'' is the source of the [[Old Irish]] personal name ''Artr\u00ed''.<ref name=zimmer09>{{Harvnb|Zimmer|2009}}</ref> Some scholars have noted that the legendary King Arthur's name only appears as ''Arthur'', ''Arthurus'', or ''Arturus'' in early Latin Arthurian texts, and never as ''Art\u014drius'' (although the Classical Latin ''Art\u014drius'' became ''Arturius'' in some Vulgar Latin dialects). However, it may not refer to the origin of the name ''Arthur'', as ''Art\u014drius'' would regularly become ''Art(h)ur'' when borrowed into [[Welsh language|Welsh]].<ref>{{citation |last=Koch |first=John T. |chapter=The Celtic Lands |editor-first=Norris J. |editor-last=Lacy |title = Medieval Arthurian Literature: A Guide to Recent Research |location = New York, NY |publisher = Garland |year= 1996 |page = 253 |isbn = 978-0-8153-2160-6 }}</ref>\n\nHistorian [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]] argued that the appearance of the name ''Arthur'' among Scottish and Welsh figures suggests the name became popular in early 6th-century Britain for a short time.

Gildas does mention a Briton victory against the [[Saxons]] at the \"Badonic mount\" (''mons Badonicus''), which occurred in the year of Gildas' birth and ushered in a generation of peace between the two warring peoples. This engagement is now referred to as the [[Battle of Badon]]. Gildas describes the battle as taking place \"in our times\" and being one of the \"latest, if not the greatest\" slaughter of the Saxons, and that a new generation born after Badon had come of age in Britain. Later Cambro-Latin sources give the Old Welsh form of the battle's location as Badon, such as in the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'', and this has been adopted by most modern scholars.<ref name=\"Green31\">{{cite book |last=Green |first=Thomas |year=2008 |title=Concepts of Arthur |page=31 |publisher=Tempus |location=Stroud, England }}</ref>{{sfn|Padel|1994}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Green|2007}}, chapters five and seven.</ref>\n\nGildas' Latin is somewhat opaque; he does not name Arthur or any other leader of the battle. He does discuss [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] as a great scourge of the Saxons immediately prior,<ref name=\"Green31\" /> but he seems to indicate that some time had passed between Ambrosius' victory and the Battle of Badon. The details of the battle, including its date and location, remain uncertain, with most scholars accepting a date around 500; numerous locations throughout Britain have been proposed over the years.\n\n===''Historia Brittonum''===\nArthur is also not mentioned in [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (''Ecclesiastical History of the English People''), which dates to c. 731, or any other surviving work until around 829, the date ascribed to the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', which is usually attributed to the Welsh ecclesiastic [[Nennius]], though this attribution has been disputed.<ref name=Fletcher_112>{{cite book |last= Fletcher|first= Richard |title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England |page=112 |year= 1989 |publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn |isbn = 0-85683-089-5 }}</ref> ''Historia Brittonum'' lists 12 battles fought by Arthur and gives him the title of ''dux bellorum'' (war commander or leader), saying that Arthur fought \"alongside the kings of the Britons\", rather than that Arthur was himself a king. Other accounts associating Arthur with the Battle of Mount Badon can be shown to be derived directly or indirectly from the ''Historia Brittonum''. The list is inserted between the death of [[Hengist]] and the reign of [[Ida of Bernicia]].\n\n===''Annales Cambriae''===\nThe earliest version of the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'' (''Welsh Annals'') was composed in the mid-10th century. It gives the date of Badon as 516 and lists Arthur's death as occurring in 537 at the [[Battle of Camlann]]. Like the ''Annals'', all other sources that name Arthur were written at least 400 years after the events which they describe.<ref name=\"Fletcher_17\" />\n\n===''Historia Regum Britanniae''===\nArthur was first styled as a [[king of the Britons]] in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s pseudo-historical chronicle ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain''), which dates to c. 1136.{{NoteTag|''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' draws upon Gildas' ''De Excidio Britanniae'', the ''Historia Brittonum'', and the ''Annales Cambriae'', among other sources.}} Geoffrey also refers to Ambrosius Aurelianus (whom he calls Aurelius Ambrosius) as a king of Britain and an older brother of [[Uther Pendragon]], father of Arthur, thus establishing a familial relationship between Aurelianus and Arthur.

The earliest of these would appear to be the Old Welsh poem ''[[Y Gododdin]]'', preserved in a 13th-century manuscript. It refers to a warrior who \"glutted black ravens [i.e., killed many men] on the rampart of the stronghold, although he was no Arthur.\"<ref name=Fletcher_17>{{cite book |last = Fletcher |first = Richard |title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England |pages=17\u201319 |year = 1989 |publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn |isbn = 0-85683-089-5 }}</ref>\n\nThe Welsh poem ''[[Geraint, son of Erbin]]'' describes a battle at a port-settlement and mentions Arthur in passing.<ref name=Bollard>{{cite journal |last= Bollard |first = John K. |author-link=  |year= 1994 |title= Arthur in the Early Welsh Tradition |journal=The Romance of Arthur: An Anthology of Medieval Texts in Translation |volume= |issue= |publisher=Routledge |pages= 11\u201323 }}</ref> The work is a praise-poem and elegy for King [[Geraint]], usually presumed to be a historical king of [[Dumnonia]], and is significant in showing that he was associated with Arthur at a relatively early date.<ref name=Bollard/> It also provides the earliest known reference to Arthur as \"emperor\".<ref name=Bollard/> ''Geraint, son of Erbin'' is found in the [[Black Book of Carmarthen]],<ref name=Jarman>{{cite book |last= Jarman|first= A.O.H. |title= Llyfr Du Caerfyrddin |year= 1982 |publisher= Gwasg Prifysgol Cymru |isbn=0-7083-0629-2 }}</ref> compiled around 1250, though the poem itself may date to the 10th or 11th century.<ref name=Bollard/> ''Y Gododdin'' was similarly copied around the same time.

Noting that the Welsh name ''Arthur'' plausibly derives from the Latin ''Artorius'', Malone suggested that certain details of Castus' biography, in particular his possible campaign in Brittany and the fact that he was obliged to retire from the military (perhaps because of an injury), may have inspired elements of Geoffrey of Monmouth's depiction of King Arthur.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Malone|1925}} Later scholars have challenged the idea, based on the fact that Artorius lived two to three centuries before the period typically associated with Arthur, and the fact that the parts of the inscriptions ostensibly similar to Arthur's story are open to interpretation.{{sfn|Halsall|2013|pp=147\u201348}}\n\nMalone's idea attracted little attention for decades, but it was revived in the 1970s as part of a theory known as the \"Sarmatian connection\".{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Higham|2018| pp= 13\u201376}} In a 1975 essay, Helmut Nickel suggested that Artorius was the original Arthur, and that a group of [[Sarmatian]] cavalry serving under him in Britain inspired the [[Knights of the Round Table]]. Nickel wrote that Castus' Sarmatian unit fought under a red dragon banner and that their descendants were still in Britain in the 5th century; he also identified similarities between the Arthurian legend and traditions associated with the Sarmatians and other peoples of the [[Caucasus]] region. He suggested that the Sarmatians' descendants kept Castus' legacy alive over the centuries and mixed it with their ancestral myths involving magical cauldrons and swords.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nIndependently of Nickel, [[C. Scott Littleton]] developed a more elaborate version of the Sarmatian connection. Littleton first wrote about the theory with Anne C. Thomas in 1978, and expanded on it in a 1994 book co-authored by Linda Malcor, ''From Scythia to Camelot''.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Littleton | first1 = C.

They find parallels for key features of the Arthurian legend, including the [[Excalibur#Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone|Sword in the Stone]], the [[Holy Grail]], and the return of Arthur's sword to a lake, in the traditions of the Caucasus, and connect Arthur and his knights to [[Batraz]] and his [[Narts]], the heroes of the legends of the [[North Caucasus]].{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}<ref name=green2>{{cite web |url= http://www.arthuriana.co.uk/historicity/arthur.htm |title= The Historicity and Historicisation of Arthur |last= Greene |first= Caitlin R. |year=2009 |orig-year=1998 |website = Arthuriana.co.uk |access-date= 2018-07-06 }}</ref>\n\nSome Arthurian scholars have given credence to the Sarmatian connection, but others have found it based on conjecture and weak evidence.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Few of the Caucasian traditions cited to support the theory can be traced specifically with the Sarmatians; many are known only from orally transmitted tales that are not datable before they were first recorded in the 19th century.{{sfn|Halsall|2013|pp=149-151}}{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Additionally, many of the strongest parallels to the Arthurian legend are not found in the earliest Brittonic materials, but only appear in the later Continental romances of the 12th century or later.<ref name=green2/> As such, the traditions would have had to survive in Britain for at least a thousand years between the arrival of the Sarmatians in the 2nd century and the Arthurian romances of the 12th century.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Nonetheless, the Sarmatian connection continues to have popular appeal; it is the basis of the 2004 film ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]''.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}\n\n===Riothamus===\n[[Riothamus]] (also spelled Riotimus) was a historical figure whom ancient sources list as \"a [[king of the Britons]]\". He lived in the late 5th century, and most of the stories about him were recorded in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[Jordanes]]' ''[[The Origin and Deeds of the Goths]]'', written in the mid-6th century, only about 80 years after his presumed death.\n\nAbout 460, the Roman diplomat and bishop [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] sent a letter to Riothamus asking his help to quell unrest among the Brettones, a colony of Brittonic-speaking people living in [[Armorica]]; this letter [[Riothamus#The letter|still survives]]. In the year 470, the Western Roman Emperor [[Anthemius]] began a campaign against [[Euric]], king of the [[Visigoths]] who were campaigning outside their territory in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]]. Anthemius requested help from Riothamus, and Jordanes writes that he crossed the ocean into Gaul with 12,000 soldiers. The location of Riothamus' army was betrayed to the Visigoths by [[Arvandus]], the jealous [[praetorian prefect of Gaul]], and Euric defeated him in the [[Battle of D\u00e9ols]] after Riothamus' army was driven from Avaricum ([[Bourges]]) where he had been welcomed by the [[Bituriges]] before the fight. Riothamus was last seen retreating northward to [[Burgundy]] when Euric besieged Arvernum ([[Clermont-Ferrand]]) just south of the [[Berry (province)|Bituriges territory]].\n\n[[Geoffrey Ashe]] points out that Arthur is said by Geoffrey of Monmouth to have crossed into Gaul twice, once to help a Roman emperor and once to subdue a civil war. Riothamus did both, assuming that he was a king in Britain as well as Armorica. Arthur is also said to have been betrayed by one of his advisers, and Riothamus was betrayed by one of his supposed allies. Finally, the Arthurian romances traditionally recount that King Arthur was carried off to [[Avalon]] (called ''insula Auallonis'' by Geoffrey of Monmouth, the first author to mention the legendary isle) before he died; Riothamus, after his defeat at D\u00e9ols, was last known to have fled to the kingdom of the Germanic [[Burgundians]], perhaps passing through a town called [[Avallon]] (though no ancient source on Riothamus mentions him being anywhere in the area of Avallon).\n\nIt is unknown whether Riothamus was a king in Britain or Armorica. Armorica was a Brittonic colony and Jordanes writes that Riothamus \"crossed the ocean\", so it is possible that both are correct. The name ''Riothamus'' is interpreted by Ashe and some other scholars as a title meaning \"High King\", though there is no evidence for such a title being used by ancient Britons or [[Gauls]], and the formation of the name (noun/adjective + superlative -tamo- suffix) follows a pattern found in numerous other Brittonic and Gaulish personal names.{{NoteTag|Examples include: Old Breton/Welsh ''Cunatam''/''Cunotami''/''Condam''/''Cyndaf'' (Brittonic ''*Cunotamos'' \"Great Dog\"), Old Welsh ''Caurdaf'' ([[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] ''*Kawarotamos'' \"Great Giant\"), Old Welsh/Breton ''Eudaf''/''Outham'' (Brittonic ''*Awitamos'' \"Great Will/Desire\"), ''Uuoratam''/''Gwrdaf'' (Brittonic ''*Wortamos'' \"Supreme\"), Old Breton ''Rumatam'' (Brittonic ''*Roimmotamos'' \"Great Band/Host\"), ''Gwyndaf'' (Brittonic ''*Windotamos'' \"Fairest/Whitest/Holiest One\"), Breton ''Uuentamau'' (Brittonic ''*Wenitamaua'' \"Friendliest\", and ''*Windotamaw\u0101'' \"Little Fairest/Whitest/Holiest (One)\").<ref>Lambert, Pierre-Yves; Pinault, Georges-Jean. ''Gaulois et celtique continental'', Librairie Droz, 2007, p. 464.</ref>}} Cognates of the name Riothamus survive in Old Welsh (''Riatav''/''Riadaf'') and [[Old Breton]] (''Riatam''); all are derived from [[Common Brittonic]] ''*Rigotamos'', meaning \"Most Kingly\" or \"Kingliest\".\n\n===Ambrosius Aurelianus===\n[[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] (also sometimes referred to as Aurelius Ambrosius) was a powerful [[Romano-British]] leader in Britain. He was renowned for his campaigns against the Saxons, and there is some speculation that he may have commanded the British forces at the Battle of Badon Hill. At any rate, the battle was a clear continuation of his efforts.\n\nScholars such as Leon Fleuriot identified Ambrosius Aurelianus with the aforementioned Riothamus figure from Jordanes, an idea which forms part of Fleuriot's hypothesis about the origins of the Arthurian legend.<ref>L\u00e9on Fleuriot, ''Les origines de la Bretagne: l'\u00e9migration'', Paris, Payot, 1980.</ref> Others, such as Geoffrey Ashe, disagree, since Ambrosius is not called \"king\" until the somewhat-legendary ''Historia Brittonum''.<ref>Geoffrey Ashe, ''The Discovery of King Arthur'', Guild Publishing, London, 1985.</ref>\n\n===Art\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in===\nArt\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in was the eldest son of [[\u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in]], an Irish king of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] in the late 6th century. Art\u00far never himself became king of D\u00e1l Riata; his brother [[Eochaid Buide]] ruled after their father's death. However, Art\u00far became a war leader when \u00c1ed\u00e1n gave up his role and retired to monastic life, though \u00c1ed\u00e1n was officially still king. Thus it was Art\u00far who led the [[Scoti]] of D\u00e1l Riata in a war against the [[Picts]], separate from the later war with [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]].\n\nUnder this hypothesis, Art\u00far was predominantly active in the region between [[Hadrian's Wall]] and the [[Antonine Wall]], the Kingdom of the [[Gododdin]]. He was ultimately killed in battle in 582 \u2013 thus, he lived far too late to have been the victor at the Battle of Badon, as mentioned by Gildas in the early 6th century.

He develops into a legendary figure in the [[Matter of Britain]] from the 12th century, following Geoffrey of Monmouth's influential ''Historia Regum Britanniae''.\n\nRecent theories concerning a possible historical identity of Arthur include Art\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in, a son of the 6th-century [[D\u00e1l Riata]] king [[\u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in]]; [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]], who led a [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] resistance against the Saxons; [[Lucius Artorius Castus]], a 2nd-century Roman commander of [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] cavalry; the British king [[Riothamus]], who fought alongside the last [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] commanders against the [[Visigoths]] in an expedition to [[Gaul]] in the 5th century; or a composite of any of these people as well as other figures and myths.\n\n\n== Etymology of \"Arthur\" ==\n{{Main|Arthur}}\n\nThe origin of the name Arthur is unclear.

Gildas does mention a Briton victory against the [[Saxons]] at the \"Badonic mount\" (''mons Badonicus''), which occurred in the year of Gildas' birth and ushered in a generation of peace between the two warring peoples. This engagement is now referred to as the [[Battle of Badon]]. Gildas describes the battle as taking place \"in our times\" and being one of the \"latest, if not the greatest\" slaughter of the Saxons, and that a new generation born after Badon had come of age in Britain. Later Cambro-Latin sources give the Old Welsh form of the battle's location as Badon, such as in the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'', and this has been adopted by most modern scholars.<ref name=\"Green31\">{{cite book |last=Green |first=Thomas |year=2008 |title=Concepts of Arthur |page=31 |publisher=Tempus |location=Stroud, England }}</ref>{{sfn|Padel|1994}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Green|2007}}, chapters five and seven.</ref>\n\nGildas' Latin is somewhat opaque; he does not name Arthur or any other leader of the battle. He does discuss [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] as a great scourge of the Saxons immediately prior,<ref name=\"Green31\" /> but he seems to indicate that some time had passed between Ambrosius' victory and the Battle of Badon. The details of the battle, including its date and location, remain uncertain, with most scholars accepting a date around 500; numerous locations throughout Britain have been proposed over the years.\n\n===''Historia Brittonum''===\nArthur is also not mentioned in [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (''Ecclesiastical History of the English People''), which dates to c. 731, or any other surviving work until around 829, the date ascribed to the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', which is usually attributed to the Welsh ecclesiastic [[Nennius]], though this attribution has been disputed.<ref name=Fletcher_112>{{cite book |last= Fletcher|first= Richard |title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England |page=112 |year= 1989 |publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn |isbn = 0-85683-089-5 }}</ref> ''Historia Brittonum'' lists 12 battles fought by Arthur and gives him the title of ''dux bellorum'' (war commander or leader), saying that Arthur fought \"alongside the kings of the Britons\", rather than that Arthur was himself a king. Other accounts associating Arthur with the Battle of Mount Badon can be shown to be derived directly or indirectly from the ''Historia Brittonum''. The list is inserted between the death of [[Hengist]] and the reign of [[Ida of Bernicia]].\n\n===''Annales Cambriae''===\nThe earliest version of the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'' (''Welsh Annals'') was composed in the mid-10th century. It gives the date of Badon as 516 and lists Arthur's death as occurring in 537 at the [[Battle of Camlann]]. Like the ''Annals'', all other sources that name Arthur were written at least 400 years after the events which they describe.<ref name=\"Fletcher_17\" />\n\n===''Historia Regum Britanniae''===\nArthur was first styled as a [[king of the Britons]] in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s pseudo-historical chronicle ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain''), which dates to c. 1136.{{NoteTag|''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' draws upon Gildas' ''De Excidio Britanniae'', the ''Historia Brittonum'', and the ''Annales Cambriae'', among other sources.}} Geoffrey also refers to Ambrosius Aurelianus (whom he calls Aurelius Ambrosius) as a king of Britain and an older brother of [[Uther Pendragon]], father of Arthur, thus establishing a familial relationship between Aurelianus and Arthur.

Noting that the Welsh name ''Arthur'' plausibly derives from the Latin ''Artorius'', Malone suggested that certain details of Castus' biography, in particular his possible campaign in Brittany and the fact that he was obliged to retire from the military (perhaps because of an injury), may have inspired elements of Geoffrey of Monmouth's depiction of King Arthur.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Malone|1925}} Later scholars have challenged the idea, based on the fact that Artorius lived two to three centuries before the period typically associated with Arthur, and the fact that the parts of the inscriptions ostensibly similar to Arthur's story are open to interpretation.{{sfn|Halsall|2013|pp=147\u201348}}\n\nMalone's idea attracted little attention for decades, but it was revived in the 1970s as part of a theory known as the \"Sarmatian connection\".{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Higham|2018| pp= 13\u201376}} In a 1975 essay, Helmut Nickel suggested that Artorius was the original Arthur, and that a group of [[Sarmatian]] cavalry serving under him in Britain inspired the [[Knights of the Round Table]]. Nickel wrote that Castus' Sarmatian unit fought under a red dragon banner and that their descendants were still in Britain in the 5th century; he also identified similarities between the Arthurian legend and traditions associated with the Sarmatians and other peoples of the [[Caucasus]] region. He suggested that the Sarmatians' descendants kept Castus' legacy alive over the centuries and mixed it with their ancestral myths involving magical cauldrons and swords.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nIndependently of Nickel, [[C. Scott Littleton]] developed a more elaborate version of the Sarmatian connection. Littleton first wrote about the theory with Anne C. Thomas in 1978, and expanded on it in a 1994 book co-authored by Linda Malcor, ''From Scythia to Camelot''.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Littleton | first1 = C.

They find parallels for key features of the Arthurian legend, including the [[Excalibur#Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone|Sword in the Stone]], the [[Holy Grail]], and the return of Arthur's sword to a lake, in the traditions of the Caucasus, and connect Arthur and his knights to [[Batraz]] and his [[Narts]], the heroes of the legends of the [[North Caucasus]].{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}<ref name=green2>{{cite web |url= http://www.arthuriana.co.uk/historicity/arthur.htm |title= The Historicity and Historicisation of Arthur |last= Greene |first= Caitlin R. |year=2009 |orig-year=1998 |website = Arthuriana.co.uk |access-date= 2018-07-06 }}</ref>\n\nSome Arthurian scholars have given credence to the Sarmatian connection, but others have found it based on conjecture and weak evidence.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Few of the Caucasian traditions cited to support the theory can be traced specifically with the Sarmatians; many are known only from orally transmitted tales that are not datable before they were first recorded in the 19th century.{{sfn|Halsall|2013|pp=149-151}}{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Additionally, many of the strongest parallels to the Arthurian legend are not found in the earliest Brittonic materials, but only appear in the later Continental romances of the 12th century or later.<ref name=green2/> As such, the traditions would have had to survive in Britain for at least a thousand years between the arrival of the Sarmatians in the 2nd century and the Arthurian romances of the 12th century.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Nonetheless, the Sarmatian connection continues to have popular appeal; it is the basis of the 2004 film ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]''.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}\n\n===Riothamus===\n[[Riothamus]] (also spelled Riotimus) was a historical figure whom ancient sources list as \"a [[king of the Britons]]\". He lived in the late 5th century, and most of the stories about him were recorded in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[Jordanes]]' ''[[The Origin and Deeds of the Goths]]'', written in the mid-6th century, only about 80 years after his presumed death.\n\nAbout 460, the Roman diplomat and bishop [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] sent a letter to Riothamus asking his help to quell unrest among the Brettones, a colony of Brittonic-speaking people living in [[Armorica]]; this letter [[Riothamus#The letter|still survives]]. In the year 470, the Western Roman Emperor [[Anthemius]] began a campaign against [[Euric]], king of the [[Visigoths]] who were campaigning outside their territory in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]]. Anthemius requested help from Riothamus, and Jordanes writes that he crossed the ocean into Gaul with 12,000 soldiers. The location of Riothamus' army was betrayed to the Visigoths by [[Arvandus]], the jealous [[praetorian prefect of Gaul]], and Euric defeated him in the [[Battle of D\u00e9ols]] after Riothamus' army was driven from Avaricum ([[Bourges]]) where he had been welcomed by the [[Bituriges]] before the fight. Riothamus was last seen retreating northward to [[Burgundy]] when Euric besieged Arvernum ([[Clermont-Ferrand]]) just south of the [[Berry (province)|Bituriges territory]].\n\n[[Geoffrey Ashe]] points out that Arthur is said by Geoffrey of Monmouth to have crossed into Gaul twice, once to help a Roman emperor and once to subdue a civil war. Riothamus did both, assuming that he was a king in Britain as well as Armorica. Arthur is also said to have been betrayed by one of his advisers, and Riothamus was betrayed by one of his supposed allies. Finally, the Arthurian romances traditionally recount that King Arthur was carried off to [[Avalon]] (called ''insula Auallonis'' by Geoffrey of Monmouth, the first author to mention the legendary isle) before he died; Riothamus, after his defeat at D\u00e9ols, was last known to have fled to the kingdom of the Germanic [[Burgundians]], perhaps passing through a town called [[Avallon]] (though no ancient source on Riothamus mentions him being anywhere in the area of Avallon).\n\nIt is unknown whether Riothamus was a king in Britain or Armorica. Armorica was a Brittonic colony and Jordanes writes that Riothamus \"crossed the ocean\", so it is possible that both are correct. The name ''Riothamus'' is interpreted by Ashe and some other scholars as a title meaning \"High King\", though there is no evidence for such a title being used by ancient Britons or [[Gauls]], and the formation of the name (noun/adjective + superlative -tamo- suffix) follows a pattern found in numerous other Brittonic and Gaulish personal names.{{NoteTag|Examples include: Old Breton/Welsh ''Cunatam''/''Cunotami''/''Condam''/''Cyndaf'' (Brittonic ''*Cunotamos'' \"Great Dog\"), Old Welsh ''Caurdaf'' ([[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] ''*Kawarotamos'' \"Great Giant\"), Old Welsh/Breton ''Eudaf''/''Outham'' (Brittonic ''*Awitamos'' \"Great Will/Desire\"), ''Uuoratam''/''Gwrdaf'' (Brittonic ''*Wortamos'' \"Supreme\"), Old Breton ''Rumatam'' (Brittonic ''*Roimmotamos'' \"Great Band/Host\"), ''Gwyndaf'' (Brittonic ''*Windotamos'' \"Fairest/Whitest/Holiest One\"), Breton ''Uuentamau'' (Brittonic ''*Wenitamaua'' \"Friendliest\", and ''*Windotamaw\u0101'' \"Little Fairest/Whitest/Holiest (One)\").<ref>Lambert, Pierre-Yves; Pinault, Georges-Jean. ''Gaulois et celtique continental'', Librairie Droz, 2007, p. 464.</ref>}} Cognates of the name Riothamus survive in Old Welsh (''Riatav''/''Riadaf'') and [[Old Breton]] (''Riatam''); all are derived from [[Common Brittonic]] ''*Rigotamos'', meaning \"Most Kingly\" or \"Kingliest\".\n\n===Ambrosius Aurelianus===\n[[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] (also sometimes referred to as Aurelius Ambrosius) was a powerful [[Romano-British]] leader in Britain. He was renowned for his campaigns against the Saxons, and there is some speculation that he may have commanded the British forces at the Battle of Badon Hill. At any rate, the battle was a clear continuation of his efforts.\n\nScholars such as Leon Fleuriot identified Ambrosius Aurelianus with the aforementioned Riothamus figure from Jordanes, an idea which forms part of Fleuriot's hypothesis about the origins of the Arthurian legend.<ref>L\u00e9on Fleuriot, ''Les origines de la Bretagne: l'\u00e9migration'', Paris, Payot, 1980.</ref> Others, such as Geoffrey Ashe, disagree, since Ambrosius is not called \"king\" until the somewhat-legendary ''Historia Brittonum''.<ref>Geoffrey Ashe, ''The Discovery of King Arthur'', Guild Publishing, London, 1985.</ref>\n\n===Art\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in===\nArt\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in was the eldest son of [[\u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in]], an Irish king of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] in the late 6th century. Art\u00far never himself became king of D\u00e1l Riata; his brother [[Eochaid Buide]] ruled after their father's death. However, Art\u00far became a war leader when \u00c1ed\u00e1n gave up his role and retired to monastic life, though \u00c1ed\u00e1n was officially still king. Thus it was Art\u00far who led the [[Scoti]] of D\u00e1l Riata in a war against the [[Picts]], separate from the later war with [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]].\n\nUnder this hypothesis, Art\u00far was predominantly active in the region between [[Hadrian's Wall]] and the [[Antonine Wall]], the Kingdom of the [[Gododdin]]. He was ultimately killed in battle in 582 \u2013 thus, he lived far too late to have been the victor at the Battle of Badon, as mentioned by Gildas in the early 6th century. This is the solution proposed by David F. Carroll (in his book ''Arturius: A Quest for Camelot'', 1996) and by [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]].<ref name=\"Wood\">{{cite book |last = Wood |first = Michael |title = In Search of Myths and Heroes |page = [https://archive.org/details/insearchofmythsh00mich/page/255 255] |year = 2007 |publisher = University of California Press |isbn = 978-0-520-25170-0 |url = https://archive.org/details/insearchofmythsh00mich/page/255 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[King Arthur's messianic return]]\n* [[Sites and places associated with Arthurian legend]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n:{{note|Alpha|\u03b1}} For example, Art\u00far mac Conaing,<ref>Senchus Fer Alban.

Moreover, removal of someone reliably sourced from the list within a year of the source's publishment requires a reliable source revealing that the person has died. Having any reliable source revealing the person died is sufficient for a person to be removed from the list; there is no requirement that the person has been removed from GRG's list of living supercentenarians under the assumption that they're on GRG's list.

The opening ceremony followed on October 18, 1930 at Liisankatu, [[Kruununhaka]]. Before the foundation, Finnish military history was first shown to the public in 1908 at Valtion historiallinen museo (The History Museum of the State) and later in 1918\u20131919 at the National Museum. The former exhibition's theme was The War of 1808\u20131809 and latter's Finnish Civil War.<ref>Huusko, Harri; Saari, Anssi; Haavisto, Lauri.\"Sotamuseo eilen, nyt, tulevaisuudessa\", Museo, 2/2011, pp. 14\u201317.</ref>\n\nIn January 1930, The Ministry of Defence ordered Military Museum to continue in [[Suomenlinna]] Sea Fortress, where the building Bastion Carpelan was reserved for the museum's use. Lieutenant Reijo Wilhelm Palmroth was elected as museum manager. The opening ceremony took place on June 11, 1933 and in the following years the museum was annually visited by around 9254 people. The exhibition consisted of different arms sections which included jaegers, engineers, arms and navy. There were also civil war collections to be seen.<ref>Enqvist, Ove; H\u00e4r\u00f6, Mikko (1998). \"Varuskunnasta maailmanperinn\u00f6ksi \u2013 Suomenlinnan itsen\u00e4isyysajan vaiheet\", p. 63.

The items and collections were removed from bastion Carpelan during the war and stored around Finland.  Even the museum's office had to be relocated from Helsinki because of the Soviet air bombings in 1944.<ref>Enqvist, Ove; H\u00e4r\u00f6, Mikko (1998). \"Varuskunnasta maailmanperinn\u00f6ksi \u2013 Suomenlinnan itsen\u00e4isyysajan vaiheet\", p. 63. Suomenlinna ry, Uudenkaupungin Sanomat Oy, 1998.</ref>\n\nDuring the Winter War and [[Continuation War]], the Military Museum organized a series of exhibitions at the Exhibition Hall. The first was Sotasaalisn\u00e4yttely (War Looting Exhibition) in February 1940 which was shortly followed by the Sotamuiston\u00e4yttely (War Memories Exhibition) I and II in 1941. Military Museum also organized touring exhibitions around Finland between 1941 and 1943 and even had exhibitions in Sweden in 1942\u201343. There were several purposes for these kinds of war exhibitions. It was, for example, a means to gather funds for war invalids and their families, to show how it was to fight on Finnish side at the front, and to lift up morale among citizens.<ref>Huusko, Harri; Saari, Anssi; Haavisto, Lauri. \"Sotamuseo eilen, nyt, tulevaisuudessa\", Museo, 2/2011, pp. 14\u201317.</ref>\n\n1944 was the year of the foundation of Sotamuistoyhdistys, later to be named Suomen sotahistoriallinen seura (The Association for Military History in Finland). The association is an independent unit but it is run in a close relationship with the Military Museum. Its goal is to cherish the memory of Finnish wars in various ways.\n\nAfter the war, Military Museum had to manage without exhibition halls for a short period of time. The situation changed when it received a hall at Maurinkatu, Kruununhaka.  Military Museum expanded more in the mid-1990s after setting up an exhibition also at Liisankatu. In March 2013, a new exhibition was opened there, but only three years later, in 2016, the exhibition at Kruununhaka was permanently closed. The Military Museum's only exhibitions are now located at the Manege building on Suomenlinna island.\n\nMilitary Museum's presence in Suomenlinna ceased shortly at the brink of Winter War in 1939. The collections in Bastion Carpelan were moved to the mainland and later Military Museum had to make way for the Armfelt Museum. However, there had been thoughts and debate about founding a Coastal Artillery Museum and Naval Museum in Suomenlinna in 1946\u20131948<ref>Enqvist, Ove; H\u00e4r\u00f6, Mikko (1998). \"Varuskunnasta maailmanperinn\u00f6ksi \u2013 Suomenlinnan itsen\u00e4isyysajan vaiheet\", p. 202.

The main focus was in the 19th century. The exhibition at Liisankatu 1 is now permanently closed.\n\n===Submarine ''Vesikko'', Manege and Artillery Manege===\nThe Military Museum has in the summer time two exhibitions open in Suomenlinna. [[Submarine Vesikko|''Vesikko'']] is a Finnish [[submarine]] built in 1933 that served in the [[World War II|second World War]] in the [[Gulf of Finland]]. ''Vesikko'' is the only remaining submarine of the Finnish Fleet during the World War II. Other four U-boats were scrapped in 1953. During the Winter War and the Continuation war 1939\u20131944 ''Vesikko'' was in active service, conducting patrol and safeguard missions in the Gulf of Finland and \u00c5land archipelago. ''Vesikko'' managed to destroy one enemy transport ship as it sank Soviet ''Vyborg'' July 3, 1941 near Suursaari. After the peace treaty with the Soviet Union, ''Vesikko\u2019s'' days in active service were over because The Peace Treaty of 1947 forbade Finland from owning and operating submarines. ''Vesikko'' was however saved for Finnish Navy's possible later educational purposes. But no use emerged for ''Vesikko'' and it was transferred to Katajanokka dockyard. The state planned to sell it in 1959 but thanks to the ex-submariners' strong lobbying, the submarine was once again saved and transported from Katajanokka to Suomenlinna in the early 1960s. After opening as a museum July 9, 1973 it has become the Military Museum's most popular exhibition.\n\n[[Military Museum's Manege|The Manege]] was opened to public June 1, 1989. The original exhibition consisted mainly of heavy weapons from Finnish wars against Soviet Union in 1939\u20131944. There have been arranged also special exhibitions, for example in 2003\u20132004 about Finnish submarines and in summer 2011 about the submarine ''Vesikko''. The Manege's collections include e.g. a German 88mm Flak 37 Anti-Aircraft gun and British Vickers-Armstrong 38 light tank. Both have been used by the Finnish Army during the wars. One specialty in the exhibition is a torpedo tube from a Finnish S2- torpedo boat, sunk in 1925. In summer 2012 a new exhibition called ''From Autonomy to Atalanta'' was opened. The exhibition showcases Finnish military history from the 19th century to the present day. This exhibition was closed in October 2017.\n\nFinnish Defence Forces \u2013 100 years at the war and peace -exhibition was opened in 2018. The exhibition portrays the wars Finland has fought during its independence: the Civil was 1918, the Winter War in 1939\u20131940, the Continuation War in 1941-1944 and the Lapland War in 1944\u20131945. The exhibition continues in the adjacent building, telling the story of Finnish Defence Forces in the post-war period up to the present day\n\n==Special military museums==\nAt the moment there are eight special military museums in Finland, which operate under the Military Museum's supervision. Due to limited resources and lack of exhibition halls, historical military collections have been divided to special arms museums. Especially the growing amount of collections in different army units has resulted in the founding of specialized military museums. They are often financed by foundations and have been founded since 1945. Special military museums include [[Parola Tank Museum|The Tank Museum]], The Anti-Aircraft Museum, The Finnish Aviation Museum, The Infantry Museum, The Museum of Military Medicine, [[Mobilia]], Forum Marinum and Museum Militaria, which comprises the [[Engineers Museum]], The National Signals Museum and [[The Artillery Museum of Finland]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Artillery Museum of Finland]]\n* [[Parola Tank Museum]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* https://sotamuseo.fi/en/frontpage\n\n[[Category:Military and war museums in Finland]]\n[[Category:Museums in Helsinki]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox building\n| name       = Military Museum of Finland\n| native_name= {{lang|fi|Sotamuseo}} {{in lang|fi}}<br />{{lang|sv|Krigsmuseet}} {{in lang|sv}}\n| former_names        =\n| image               = Maneesi2013.JPG\n| caption             =\n| location            = [[Helsinki]], [[Suomenlinna]]\n| address             =\n| coordinates         = \n| start_date          =\n| completion_date     = 1881\n| inauguration_date   = 1929\n| demolition_date     =\n| destruction_date    =\n| architect           = Greifon\n| landlord            =\n| owner               =\n| cost                =\n| floor_area          =\n| floor_count         =\n| awards              =\n| references          =\n| map_type            =\n| building_type       = Museum\n| architectural_style =\n| structural_system   =\n| client              =\n| current_tenants     =\n| height              =\n| other_dimensions    =\n| structural_engineer =\n| services_engineer   =\n| civil_engineer      =\n| other_designers     =\n| quantity_surveyor   =\n| main_contractor     =\n| diameter            =\n}}\n\nThe '''Military Museum of Finland''' ({{lang-fi|Sotamuseo}}) is the central museum of the [[Finnish Defence Forces]] and the national special museum of military history.

The main focus was in the 19th century. The exhibition at Liisankatu 1 is now permanently closed.\n\n===Submarine ''Vesikko'', Manege and Artillery Manege===\nThe Military Museum has in the summer time two exhibitions open in Suomenlinna. [[Submarine Vesikko|''Vesikko'']] is a Finnish [[submarine]] built in 1933 that served in the [[World War II|second World War]] in the [[Gulf of Finland]]. ''Vesikko'' is the only remaining submarine of the Finnish Fleet during the World War II. Other four U-boats were scrapped in 1953. During the Winter War and the Continuation war 1939\u20131944 ''Vesikko'' was in active service, conducting patrol and safeguard missions in the Gulf of Finland and \u00c5land archipelago. ''Vesikko'' managed to destroy one enemy transport ship as it sank Soviet ''Vyborg'' July 3, 1941 near Suursaari. After the peace treaty with the Soviet Union, ''Vesikko\u2019s'' days in active service were over because The Peace Treaty of 1947 forbade Finland from owning and operating submarines. ''Vesikko'' was however saved for Finnish Navy's possible later educational purposes. But no use emerged for ''Vesikko'' and it was transferred to Katajanokka dockyard. The state planned to sell it in 1959 but thanks to the ex-submariners' strong lobbying, the submarine was once again saved and transported from Katajanokka to Suomenlinna in the early 1960s. After opening as a museum July 9, 1973 it has become the Military Museum's most popular exhibition.\n\n[[Military Museum's Manege|The Manege]] was opened to public June 1, 1989. The original exhibition consisted mainly of heavy weapons from Finnish wars against Soviet Union in 1939\u20131944. There have been arranged also special exhibitions, for example in 2003\u20132004 about Finnish submarines and in summer 2011 about the submarine ''Vesikko''. The Manege's collections include e.g. a German 88mm Flak 37 Anti-Aircraft gun and British Vickers-Armstrong 38 light tank. Both have been used by the Finnish Army during the wars. One specialty in the exhibition is a torpedo tube from a Finnish S2- torpedo boat, sunk in 1925. In summer 2012 a new exhibition called ''From Autonomy to Atalanta'' was opened. The exhibition showcases Finnish military history from the 19th century to the present day. This exhibition was closed in October 2017. \n\nFinnish Defence Forces \u2013 100 years at the war and peace -exhibition was opened in 2018. The exhibition portrays the wars Finland has fought during its independence: the Civil was 1918, the Winter War in 1939-1940, the Continuation War in 1941-1944 and the Lapland War in 1944-1945. The exhibition continues in the adjacent building, telling the story of Finnish Defence Forces in the post-war period up to the present day\n\n==Special military museums==\nAt the moment there are eight special military museums in Finland, which operate under the Military Museum's supervision. Due to limited resources and lack of exhibition halls, historical military collections have been divided to special arms museums. Especially the growing amount of collections in different army units has resulted in the founding of specialized military museums. They are often financed by foundations and have been founded since 1945. Special military museums include [[Parola Tank Museum|The Tank Museum]], The Anti-Aircraft Museum, The Finnish Aviation Museum, The Infantry Museum, The Museum of Military Medicine, [[Mobilia]], Forum Marinum and Museum Militaria, which comprises the [[Engineers Museum]], The National Signals Museum and [[The Artillery Museum of Finland]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Artillery Museum of Finland]]\n* [[Parola Tank Museum]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\nhttps://sotamuseo.fi/en/frontpage\n\n[[Category:Military and war museums in Finland]]\n[[Category:Museums in Helsinki]]\n", "name_user": "Majavah", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: 1939-1940 \u2192 1939\u20131940 (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Museum_of_Finland"}
