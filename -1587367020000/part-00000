Furthermore, the genus contains a species (''P. physaloides'' \u2013 recorded in older literature under the synonyms ''Hyoscyamus physalodes'', ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'' and ''Scopolia physaloides'') formerly used as an [[entheogen]] in Siberia (re. which see translation of [[Johann Georg Gmelin|Gmelin's]] account of such use below).<ref>R\u00e4tsch, Christian, ''The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants: Ethnopharmacology and Its Applications'' pub.

Chittenden, Fred J., 2nd edition, by Synge, Patrick M. Volume III : Je-Pt. Pub. Oxford at the Clarendon Press 1965. Reprinted 1984. {{ISBN|0-19-869106-8}}</ref> The variant spelling ''Physochlaena'' \u2013 as employed by Professor [[Eva Sch\u00f6nbeck-Temesy]] in her section on the Solanaceae for ''Flora Iranica'' \u2013 appears first on page 737 of Volume 22 of the German-language journal ''Linnaea'' for the year 1849.\n\n==Publication of genus name==\nThe genus name ''Physochlaina'' was first published in 1838 by [[Scottish people|Scottish]] botanist [[George Don]] ( great-uncle of [[Monty Don]] ) on page 470 of volume IV of his four-volume work ''A General System of Gardening and Botany'', often referred to as ''Gen. Hist.'' (an abbreviation of the alternative title ''A General History of the Dichlamydeous Plants'') and written between 1832 and 1838.

' of 1838 : <blockquote>'The species of ''Physochlaina'' are extremely desirable plants; being early flowerers, and elegant when in blossom. They will grow in any soil, and are readily propagated by divisions of the root, or by seed. They are well adapted for decorating borders in early spring'.</blockquote>\n\nIn regard to the soil type favoured by wild populations, volume 22 of ''Linnaea'' (in surprisingly geological vein) provides the observation that ''Physochlaina orientalis'' is to be found growing on soils underlain by [[trachyte]]s ([[volcanic rock]]s of a type notably rich in the chemical element [[potassium]], a plant macronutrient essential for the production of flowers and fruit and, in a specifically Solanaceous context, the main ingredient of liquid feed for [[tomato]] plants).\n\n==Use in traditional Chinese medicine==\n[[File:Physochlaina infundibularis single flower.jpg|thumb|Single flower of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' Kuang \u2013 the 'hot ginseng' of [[Mount Hua]], [[Shaanxi]] province.]]\nAt least three species of ''Physochlaina'' are currently used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] : ''P. infundibularis'', ''P. physaloides'' and ''P. praealta''.\n\n=== ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' ===\n\u6f0f\u6597\u6ce1\u56ca\u8349 ''Lou-dou Pao-nang-ts'ao'' / ''lou dou pao nang cao'' (= 'Funnel-shaped ''Physochlaina'' '). The inhabitants of the neighbouring provinces of [[Shaanxi]] (rendered formerly 'Shensi') and [[Henan]] hold ''P. infundibularis'' in high esteem as a medicinal plant, regarding it as a kind of [[ginseng]] : most unusually for a toxic [[Solanaceae|Solanaceous]] plant (totally unrelated botanically to the [[Araliaceae|Araliaceous]] ginseng genus [[Panax]]) it is considered to be a 'general tonic' ( = [[adaptogen]]). The Chinese element \u53c2 ''shen'' (= ''ginseng'') forms a part of two of the common names for the plant, namely \u534e\u5c71\u53c2 ''Hua-shan-shen'' (= ''ginseng of [[Mount Hua]]'') and ''Je-shen'' (= ''hot ginseng'' \u2013 from its hot, sweet, slightly bitter and astringent taste).\n\nAs with Panax, it is the fleshy root of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' that forms the drug : the fresh, raw roots are first peeled and then boiled in a sugar solution containing small quantities of three other herbal drugs, before being dried, ready for storage and use. The three drugs added to the boiling solution are the root of ''[[Glycyrrhiza uralensis]]'', the [[rhizome]] of ''[[Ophiopogon japonicus]]'' and the fruits of ''[[Gardenia jasminoides]]''. This peeling, boiling and addition of 'cooling', [[yin and yang|'yin']] drugs is undertaken to mitigate the 'heat' / toxicity of the ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' roots.\n\nIn addition to its use as an adaptogen, ''P. infundibularis'' is used (in traditional Chinese medicine) in the treatment of [[asthma]], [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]], [[abdominal pain]], [[palpitations]] and [[insomnia]] and as a [[sedative]]. The drug is also used to treat [[diarrhea]] of the kind considered in traditional Chinese medicine to be 'diarrhea due to deficiency of vital energy with symptoms of cold'.<ref>Peigen, Xiao and Liyi, He ''Ethnopharmacologic investigation on tropane-containing drugs in Chinese Solanaceous plants'' in ''Journal of Ethnopharmacology'' Volume 8 No. 1 July (1983) pub.

When they had returned to their senses, they named these falls The Drunken Rapids and, because one suffers a [[headache]] after such a [[Binge drinking|debauch]], they named the falls that they encountered next Pokhmelnoy Porog [ Russian: \u041f\u043e\u0445\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u041f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433 : The [[Hangover|Hungover]] Rapids ].</Blockquote>\nHis curiosity aroused, Gmelin investigated, and discovered an attractive new species :\n<Blockquote>This account has given me the opportunity to reveal the identity of the beautiful plant involved, which was unknown to any botanist before me : '' Hyoscyamus foliis integerrimis calicibus inflatis subglobosis '' [Botanical Latin : 'The Henbane having simple, untoothed leaves and (fruiting ) calyces that are more or less round and inflated' [ i.e. like those of a [[Physalis]] ]] Linn. h. Ups. 44. 2.</Blockquote>\nHaving identified the ( Linnaean ) genus Hyoscyamus to which the intoxicating plant of The Drunken Rapids ( since moved by Don to the genus Physochlaina ) belonged, Gmelin went on to quiz his local guides and learned the following concerning its intentional consumption :\n<blockquote>If one steeps the leaves or even the finely-chopped roots of this plant in brewed beer \u2013 or, better yet, in beer that is still undergoing [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] \u2013 then it takes but a single glass of such beer to make a man exceedingly foolish : it is surely a strange draught that he quaffs, for he is robbed of all his senses, or at least finds his senses grossly disordered, [[Macropsia|mistaking tiny things for huge ones]] : a straw for the thickest of [[Beam (structure)|beams]], a drop of water for a mighty ocean and a mouse for an elephant. Wherever he goes he encounters [ what he imagines to be ] insurmountable obstacles. He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him, and, as it seems, all this fills him with despair, because his senses are withering away; thus, should one such drunkard go to step over a beam, he will take a great stride out of all proportion to the actual size of it, while another will see deep water in front of him [ where there is only shallow ] such that he dare not venture into it.</blockquote>\nIn conclusion, Gmelin then adds, concerning the plant itself : \n<blockquote>The local inhabitants often use these roots when they want to play a [[practical joke|prank]] upon each other. The Russian merchants often bring these roots back with them when they return to Russia, because they maintain them to be a sovereign remedy for bleeding [[haemorrhoids]] and also against the [[haematuria]] \u2013 a claim which I have been unable to verify.<ref>[[Johann Georg Gmelin]], ''Reise durch Sibirien'' von dem Jahre 1738 bis zum ende 1740, Bd. 3 & 4 , Vandenhoeck, G\u00f6ttingen, 1752.</ref></blockquote>\n\nGmelin's ''Reise durch Sibirien'' \u2013  with its evocative account of his findings concerning the plant now known to science as ''Physochlaina physaloides'' \u2013  received a translation into French which was published as part of Volume 18 of [[Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost]]'s monumental ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des voyages'' \u2013 a compendium of eighteenth century exploration by land and sea, continued beyond the original fifteen volumes, by other authors following the death of Pr\u00e9vost in 1763.

Gmelin and Krasheninnikov's accounts of the effects of intoxication by the plant and mushroom in question both derive from their participation in the extraordinary [[Great Northern Expedition]] (known also as the Second [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] Expedition). As described above, they were travelling together in Central Siberia in the summer of 1738 on the occasion of Gmelin's discovery of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' and learning from the Evenk of the curious effects produced by the beer which they prepared from it. Gmelin was, at the time, one of three professors heading the Academic Group of the expedition, and his particular area of expertise within that group concerned the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms, his brief being to document the fauna, flora and mineral wealth of Siberia encountered in their travels. After many adventures, including the encounter with ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on the Angara river near [[Yeniseysk]], Professors Gmelin and [[Gerhard Friedrich M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller]], student Krasheninnikov and many other expedition members gathered at [[Vitus Bering]]'s base at [[Yakutsk]].

Psychopathol 1992; 25: 71-78.</ref> (see also [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome|dysmetropsia]]).\nIt is not clear, in this context, whether the similarity between the two accounts is due simply to the fungal and the plant drug eliciting similar symptoms or whether there has been a borrowing of phraseology from one author to another (in which direction it is hard to say). The inference would likely be that any borrowing were from the Physochlaina account to the Amanita account, were it not for the fact that accounts of macropsia caused by tropane-containing Solanaceae are rare, while those of macropsia caused by ''Amanita muscaria'' are common (or perhaps merely oft-repeated, from a few early sources).\nTo this question one may further adduce the account of ''Amanita muscaria''-induced macropsia in another early source, namely that of [[Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff]], which seems as close in tone to Gmelin's account as does that of Krasheninnikov:\n<blockquote>The nerves are highly stimulated, and in this state the slightest effort of will produces very powerful effects. Consequently, if one wishes to step over a small stick or straw, he steps and jumps as though the obstacles were tree trunks. If a man is ordinarily talkative...he involuntarily blurts out secrets, fully conscious of his actions and aware of his secret but unable to hold his nerves in check. The muscles are controlled by an uncoordinated activity of the nerves themselves, uninfluenced by and unconnected with the higher willpower of the brain, and thus it has occasionally happened that persons in this stage of intoxication found themselves driven irresistibly into ditches, streams, ponds and the like, seeing the impending danger before their eyes but unable to avoid certain death except by the assistance of friends who rushed to their aid.<ref>von Langsdorff, Georg Heinrich ''Einige Bemerkungen, die Eigenschaften des Kamtschadalischen Fliegenschwammes betreffend'' (''Some Remarks Concerning the Properties of the Fly Agaric of Kamchatka'') ''Wetterauischen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr die gesammte Naturkunde.

One recalls also the reference to the danger (or fear) of falling into deep water. Furthermore it is possible that the phrase 'he speaks continually without knowing what he is saying' which has crept into the Pr\u00e9vost ' ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale...'' ' version of Gmelin's account may have influenced von Langsdorff's description of the compulsive blabbering of the Amanita-intoxicated individual.\n\nThe northern Tungusic peoples, such as the Evens of eastern Siberia and the Evenks of central Siberia (encountered by Gmelin), have occasionally been reported to have used ''Amanita muscaria'' as an intoxicant, although with nothing like the frequency of certain other ethnolinguistic groups, such as, for instance, the [[Itelmens]] and [[Koryaks]] encountered by Krasheninnikov.<ref name=\"nyberg1\">{{cite journal|author=Nyberg, H.|year=1992|title=Religious use of hallucinogenic fungi: A comparison between Siberian and Mesoamerican Cultures|journal=Karstenia |volume=32|issue=71\u201380|pages=71\u201380|url=http://www.funga.fi/Karstenia/Karstenia%2032-2%201992-4.pdf|doi=10.29203/ka.1992.294}}</ref>\nThe use of ''Amanita muscaria'' by the Tungus (Evenki) as an additional ingredient to their ''Physochlaina'' beer would furnish yet a third explanation for the similarities in the reported effects of the Tungus drink and the Fly Agaric, but Gmelin makes no mention of such a fungal ingredient and, given that the use of ''Physochlaina'' as an intoxicant appears to have ceased among the Tungus of the Angara river region, no more information on the subject is likely to be forthcoming.\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and the narcotic \"coffee\" of Dauria==\n[[File:Pallas PS by Tardier grey.jpg|thumb|left|18th century [[Prussia]]n botanist, zoologist and [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Peter Simon Pallas]], the first to document [[Transbaikalia|Daurian]] Tungus use of the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' to brew a narcotic \"coffee\".]]\n[[File:John-Tallis-1851-Tibet-Mongolia-and-Manchuria-NE.jpg|thumb|John Tallis's 1851 map of [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]], Mongolia and Manchuria, showing (top left, south of the (then) regional capital [[Nerchinsk]]) ''Tchindat'' (= ''Chindanturuk'') on the river [[Onon River|Onon]], near its confluence with the [[Borzya River|Borzya]] where Pallas encountered ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on Crane Rock (Tungus: ''Kiro\u00e9'').]]\n[[File:Ecoregion PA0804.png|thumb|Daurian forest steppe ecoregion (shaded purple), east of [[Lake Baikal]], west of [[Hulun Lake|Lake Hulun]] and straddling the border between Russia and Mongolia.]]\n[[File:Operational Navigation Chart E-8, 6th edition.jpg|thumb|U.S. navigation chart covering Dauria (Transbaikalia), showing ''Chindanturuk'' under the name ''Chindant pervyy'' i.e. \"First (=oldest) Chindant\", north of salt lakes Barun-Torey and Zu(u)n-Torey on the border with Mongolia (bottom centre).]]\n[[File:\u0421\u043e\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0417\u0443\u043d-\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0439.jpg|thumb|Daurian landscape: the salt lake Zuun-Torey (Pallas's \"Zagan Nuur\"), [[Borzinsky District]], lying just to the south of the [[Borzya River]] (Mongolian: ''Boorj''), a tributary of the Onon.]]\n[[File:Linguistic map of the Tungusic languages (en).png|thumb|Distribution of speakers of Tungusic languages, 2011.

Gauthier de la Peyronie 1793.</ref>\nAfter accepting a professorship at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|St Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] offered him by Empress [[Catherine the Great]], Pallas led an expedition lasting from 1768 to 1774, which took him from the central provinces of Russia far to the east - all the way to the lands beyond [[Lake Baikal]]. It was here in [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]] (a.k.a. \"Dahuria\") - where the eastern extremity of Mongolia meets southern Siberia and western [[Manchuria]] - that he encountered, not only the [[Daur people]] for whom the region is named, but also certain Tungusic tribes who prepared a curious intoxicating drink. The following passage is translated from de la Peyronie\u2019s French edition of 1793.\n<blockquote>1772. 31 May. The road to ''Chindanturuk'' never leaves the river ([[Onon River|Onon]]) with its charming bed. The banks presented a delightful prospect of Spring flowers...At a distance of twenty-seven [[verst]]s from the stream ''Udagata\u00ef'', one finds rising from the shallows of the river a great steep and craggy rock which the Tungus call ''Kiro\u00e9'' (\"[[Crane (bird)|crane]]\" in their language), lying near to the [ junction of the Onon with the river] [[Borzya River|Borsa]]...I observed growing among the [[Urtica|nettles]] which surround the base of this rock the [[Physalis]]-like henbane (''Hyoscyamus physaloides''). The Tungus make use of its narcotic seed; they roast it like [[coffee]] and drink the decoction with their dinner.<ref name= \"Pallas Voyages\"/></blockquote>\nA second account (later in publication date than the ''Reisen...'' but earlier than the ''Voyages...'') of the relevant part of Pallas's expedition by an anonymous anthologist of eighteenth century travel writing provides some further details absent from the French translation and derived possibly from Pallas's original German text.\n<blockquote>The lowlands lead onward to the outpost of Udagatai, and, farther yet to Chindanturuk, where one sees growing in abundance, beneath the nettles which grow beside the rocks, ''Hyosciamus physalodes'' [sic], a rare plant, the intoxicating seed (which ripens toward the end of July) of which the Tungus roast thoroughly in a frying pan, as one roasts coffee, and boil to make a beverage which they drink with their dinner.<ref>[Author anonymous] ''Histoire des Decouvertes faites par divers savans voyageurs dans plusieurs contr\u00e9es de la Russie & de la Perse, relativement \u00e0 l'Histoire civile & naturelle \u00e0 l'\u00c9conomie rurale, au commerce &c''. pub. Aberne, chez Fran\u00e7ois Seizer et Comp., 1787.</ref></blockquote>\nThe question naturally arises as to which Tungusic people (or peoples) it was that Pallas encountered in Dauria. The Daurs themselves are speakers of the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic language]] [[Dagur language|Daur]] (a.k.a. Dagur), but there are three Daurian ethnic groupings of Tungus affiliation, namely the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]], [[Solon people|Solon]] and [[Hamnigan]] (spelled also \"Khamnigan\"). These three have all been considered subgroups of the [[Evenks]], but the Solon and, more especially the Khamnigan have interacted closely with the Mongolic Daur, [[Buryats|Buryat]] and [[Khalkha Mongols|Khalkha]] peoples to the extent that they are ethnically quite distinct from the Evenki of the Yenissei, encountered by Gmelin.<ref>Winston, Robert, ed. (2004). Human: The Definitive Visual Guide. New York: Dorling Kindersley. p. 428. {{ISBN|0-7566-0520-2}}.</ref>\nScholar of eastern Asiatic languages Professor [[Juha Janhunen]] of the [[University of Helsinki]] is of the opinion that the Khamnigan (with whom he has personally undertaken fieldwork) are of Mongolic rather than Tungusic ethnic affiliation and that, of the remaining two groups (Oroqen and Solon), the Oroqen are the closest to the Evenki proper (which group includes the Evenki of the Yenisei basin).<ref>Janhunen, Juha (1996), ''Manchuria: an ethnic history'', Volume 222 of Suomalais-ugrilaisen Seuran toimituksia, Suomalais-ugrilainen Seura, Finno-Ugrian Society</ref> If this is indeed the case, then it may have been the Oroqen who were preparing a narcotic drink from roasted Physochlaina seed, assuming that Physochlaina use was a peculiarly North Tungusic culture trait - as manifested also in the brewing of Physochlaina beer by the Evenki of the Yenisei.\n\nThere remain questions concerning the Tungus \"coffee\" itself: to guess at its effects one would need to know the average tropane alkaloid content of seeds and also to what extent - if any - the roasting or dry-frying of this seed would diminish such content.\n\nA comparison of Gmelin's vivid description of the effects of the Yeniseian Physochlaina beer and such meagre information as is given in Pallas's account of the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of Dauria is instructive: the former paints a picture of an intoxication so strong as to be terrifying rather than pleasurable and accompanied by the profoundly disorientating symptom of macropsia, while the latter suggests almost a Tungus version of a coffee morning or dinner party where a mild [[stimulant]] like coffee or a mild intoxicant like wine is consumed to promote [[Drinking culture|conviviality]]: judging from the testimony of Gmelin, one doubts whether a consumer of Physochlaina beer could muster the coordination to eat at all, let alone converse coherently during a meal.

This said, there is nothing in the Gmelin account that smacks of the religious (although it is not known if he ever witnessed Physochlaina intoxication at first hand) and there do not appear to be any surviving accounts of the use of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' in shamanic practices - if, indeed, any such ever existed.\n\n[[Carl Hartwich]] mentions thus the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of the Tungus on page 327 of his monumental ''Die Menschlichen Genussmittel'':\n<blockquote> Hyoscyamus sp. Die ger\u00f6steten samen werden in Sibirien bei den Tungusen benutzt. Die d\u00fcrften stark narkotisch sein. (Welter S. 427)) (Translation: Hyoscyamus sp. The roasted seeds are used by the Tungus in Siberia. They are likely to be very narcotic (Welter S. 427)).<ref name= \"Hartwich Menschlichen\"/></blockquote>\nAs is the case with his note on Tungus Physochlaina beer, Hartwich quotes as a reference, not a primary source in German from the work of an 18th-century explorer, but a secondary French source - in this case a work devoted to coffee and its substitutes by one Henri Welter.,<ref>Welter, Henri, ''Essaie sur l'histoire du Caf\u00e9'', pub. Paris 1868.</ref> page 427 of which bears the note:\n<blockquote>Les [[Kalmuks|Kalmouks]] et les Tongouses de la Sib\u00e9rie se pr\u00e9pare des boissons semblables au caf\u00e9, les premiers avec les graines de ''l'Erable de Tartarie'' (''Acer tartaricum'', L.) et les seconds avec celles d'une esp\u00e8ce de ''jusquiame''.\n(Translation: The Kalmuks and Tungus of Siberia prepare for themselves drinks similar to coffee, the former with the seeds of the Tartar Maple (''Acer tartaricum'' L.) and the latter with those of a species of ''henbane''). </blockquote>\nIt will be seen from the above that the comment concerning the narcotic potential of \"Hyoscyamus\" seed (meaning, in this context, the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'')\nis absent from the Welter source and has been added by the more ethnobotanically-literate Hartwich. Welter's essay on the history of coffee unfortunately lacks a bibliography, but the source of his information is almost certainly Pallas, who makes plain that the plant intended is specifically that now known not as ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'', but as ''Physochlaina physaloides''. Welter and Hartwich mention, respectively, in this context \"a species of ''henbane''\" and \"Hyoscyamus sp.\"\n\n==Chemistry==\n''Physochlaina'' species have yielded a variety of [[tropane alkaloids]], including not only the [[hyoscyamine]] and [[hyoscine|scopolamine]] present also in better-known Solanaceous genera such as [[Atropa]], [[Hyoscyamus]] and [[Scopolia]], but also the new ([[eponymous]]) base physochlaine, first isolated from the aerial parts of the Central Asian species ''Physochlaina alaica'' Korotkova ex Kovalevsk.<ref>Mirzamatov R., Luftullin K., Mallikov V. and Yunusov, S.

The Caucasian Kingdom of Iberia also encompassed parts of [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], southern [[Russia]] and eastern Turkey.\n\n[[Flora Iranica]] is in agreement on this range of occurrence for ''P. orientalis'', adding also to the list of territories not only north-western Iran but also 'Syr Darja' \u2013 the latter being referable to lands traversed by the river [[Syr Darya]] and, more especially the historic [[Syr-Darya Oblast]] and hence modern [[Uzbekistan]]. Uzbekistan lies outside the area encompassed by Flora Iranica, but parts of neighbouring [[Turkmenistan]] do not. Either way, Flora Iranica is unequivocal in describing the range of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' as extending eastward into [[Central Asia]].\n\n===Physochlaina alaica - an endangered medicinal plant of Central Asia===\nIn this context, it may be noted that Phillips and Rix include in their work on garden perennials a photograph of a second, (not universally accepted) ''Physochlaina'' species of unequivocally Central Asian provenance, namely ''P. alaica'' Korotk. ex Kovalevsk, recorded as growing in the [[Pamir-Alay]], a Central Asian mountain range taking in parts not only of Uzbekistan, but also of [[Tajikistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]. ''Physochlaina alaica'' differs from ''P. orientalis'' in having flowers of a beige or yellowish-buff colour and corolla 'throats' veined within in a contrasting dark brown. As is to be expected of a plant native to the [[Pamirs]], this species is extremely hardy, if grown in dry (i.e. well-drained) conditions.<ref name= \"Perennials 1991\"/> Its common name in the [[Uzbek language]] is ''Oloy xiyoli'',\nof which the first word ''Oloy'' signifies (like the Latin specific name ''alaica'') \"of the Alay mountains\" while the second element ''xiyoli'' appears to bear some relation to the Arabic loan-word ''xiyol'' [pronounced \"khiyol\"] translatable possibly in this context as \"short-lived\" - in reference to the plant's short growing season and quick flowering as a desert ephemeral, fuelled by food reserves stored in its fleshy roots.<ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\">Mamatqulova (Yuldasheva), Gulzira, (2016), ''Ekologik Omillarni O'zbekiston Hududida Tarqalgan Noyob O'simliklarga Ta'siri va Ularni Muhofaza Qilish'' (Translation: \"The Impact of Ecological Factors upon some Unique Plants found within the Territory of [[Uzbekistan]] and Measures Needed for their Protection\"), paper submitted for the degree of BSc, Dept. of Biology and Ecology in the Faculty of Natural Sciences, [[Andijan State University]], Republic of Uzbekistan.

According to her account, the plant is endemic to the Alay and [[Turkestan Range|Turkestan mountains]] of the [[Fergana Region]] (see also [[Fergana Valley]]). In this context she also mentions the Alay Ridge and the basins of the Shohimardon and [[Sokh River|Sokh]] rivers. [Note: there is no page \"Shohimardon River\" on either English or Uzbek Wikipedias, but see page [[Shohimardon]] (village)]. In neighbouring Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, she again mentions the Turkestan range, within which she singles out the villages of [[Vorukh]] and [[Khojabakkir]]. Habitat: the plant is to be found at altitudes between 1,800 and 2,000m, usually in the shade of rocks, bushes or [[Juniper|juniper trees]], but also in open ground. Mamatqulova estimates that there are only some 8,000 plants of this species remaining in the wild. She attributes the increasing rarity of the plant and shrinkage of its range to its over-collection (along with other local species of medicinal plant, such as [[Ungernia|Ungernia victoris]]) for medicinal purposes by the indigenous peoples of the area. The plant is included in the [[IUCN Red List|Red Book]] for the area, despite which no special safeguards have yet been put in place to halt its worrying decline. ''Physochlaina alaica'' has been in cultivation in the [[Botanical Garden of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan]], [[Tashkent]] since 1973.<ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\"/>\n\n===A Glimpse of the Ethnobotany of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' in the extreme NW of Iran===\nIn contrast to the case of its Siberian relative ''Physochlaina physaloides'', ethnobotanical data concerning the [[Western Asia]]n ''P. orientalis'' is somewhat sparse. A recent report from [[Urmia County]] and [[Silvaneh District]] in the Iranian province of [[West Azerbaijan Province|West Azerbaijan]] is thus of particular interest. In 2014 the [[Iranian Students News Agency]] published an online report from the manager of the medicinal plants group of [[Urmia University]] concerning the 'detection' of medicinal properties in two plant species of the West Azerbaijani flora - one of which was ''Physochlaina orientalis''. The locality given for the plants in question is 'Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoy' but is not clear from the context whether plant material from the locality  was collected and analysed for active constituents and/or information was gathered concerning the plants from a local informant with knowledge of the plants' properties. The I.S.N.A. article quotes from an interview with (Dr. ?) Abbas Siami, head of the Zarineh Khoi Institute of Higher Education in which he states the following:\n<blockquote>Thanks to the efforts of researchers at Zarineh Khoi University, the plant ''Physochlaina orientalis'' [was found at] Khoi Heights. It was discovered 'in therapeutic use' [?] at the Heights of Dalampur, Urmia. The Urmia University Department of Medicinal Plants, in describing the therapeutic properties of the plant said: \"This plant is a sedative, nerve stimulant, analgesic, poison and hallucinogen\".</blockquote>\n\nTransliterations of place names in the various languages of Iran from the original [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic script]] forms into Latin script can often yield a confusing number of variant spellings - as is apparent in the variant forms ''Khoi'' and ''Khoy'' and the still more divergent ''Dalampur'', ''Dalampir'' and \n(with a variant medial consonant as well as vowel) ''Dalanpar'' ''Dalanper'' etc.\n''Khoy'' / ''Khoi'' University likely refers to the Khoy campus of Urmia University, while the Heights of ''Dalampur'' (etc.) appears to designate an area of natural beauty and Iranian domestic  tourism encompassing a peak (37\u00b09\u2032N 44\u00b047\u2032E) which forms the [[tripoint]] of Iran, [[Iraq]] and Turkey, lying some 50km from the city of [[Urmia]].<ref>\u06a9\u0634\u0641 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0635 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0648\u064a\u064a \u062f\u0648 \u06af\u064a\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u067e\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u064a (Translation: ''Detection of Medicinal Properties of Two Plants at Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoi'') - article in  I.S.N.A. web archive dated Monday September 21, 2014 1.50pm.

V) BHL285489.jpg|thumb|''Physochlaina physaloides'' (listed in text as 'Hyoscyamus physalodes') : plate 5 in ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' (= 'Pictures of Rare Plants') pub. [[Leiden University|Leyden University]] 1775 by [[Nicolaas Meerburgh]] - who also engraved the coloured plates.]]\nAn early botanical illustration - possibly the first such to be made - of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' is that engraved by [[Nicolaas Meerburgh]] (then ''hortulanus'' (director) of the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden]]) for his work of 1775 ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' (= 'Pictures of Rare Plants').\nThe drawing rendered in the engraving is a depiction of a living specimen created when the plant was in flower in the Spring - a realistic portrayal of an outlying portion of an established clump of the plant, uprooted when in full growth for the purposes of illustration, rather than during the more appropriate period (for propagation by division) of the plant's Summer dormancy.\nClearly visible are the tuberous rootstock, with attached roots, and three attached dead stems (two still bearing withered scale leaves) from the previous season's aerial growth. [See image below].\nVan Meerburgh is at great pains to establish in the short preface to his work the richness in rare species and impeccable Linnaean credentials of the Leiden botanic garden and the need he felt to exist to provide accurate botanical illustrations to supplement dry, botanical descriptions.\n\n<blockquote>... experience had taught me daily how difficult it is to distinguish a great many plants, not hitherto well-known, one from another - even those described accurately by Linnaeus and other eminent botanists - and such descriptions may now profitably be compared with actual images of the plants: a better opportunity so to do than I have today could hardly arise, since the Botanic Garden of this University (which need bow to none other in Europe) boasts a great many beautiful species of plant, which one would be hard-pressed to find in many a garden, thanks to the great Linnaeus...and which have - so far as I am aware - been properly depicted nowhere else.<ref>van Meerburgh, Nicolaas, ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' pub. University of Leiden 1775.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn the second page following his introduction, van Meerburgh states thus that the plant depicted in plate 5 of his work is 'Hyoscyamus physalodes' (i.e. the plant now known correctly as ''Physochlaina physaloides'')  :\n\n<blockquote>HYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) TAB. V.\nHYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) foliis ovatis integerrimis,\ncalycibus inflatis subglobosis Linn. Sp. pl. p. 258</blockquote>\n\n- text incorporating the description in [[Species Plantarum]] and deriving from volume one of Linnaeus's earlier work [[Hortus Upsaliensis]] of 1748,in which a binomial was assigned the plant discovered by Gmelin [see section above].\nAll the above noted, because of the time of year at which the Leiden specimen was drawn, no ripe fruiting calyces were available for depiction. Furthermore the flowers of the specimen display exserted pistils and stamens and the leaves have pointed tips and sinuate margins - all of which suggest an identity compatible more with the Caucasian ''Physochlaina orientalis'' rather than the Siberian ''P. physaloides''. The question could be resolved by recourse to actual plant material held (or grown) by the herbarium and/or garden of Lieden's Hortus Botanicus at the present time.\n\n[Note: the butterfly species depicted in the plate is a Parnassius - possibly ''[[Parnassius mnemosyne]]'', the Clouded Apollo].\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and ''P. orientalis''==\n[[File:Curtis's botanical magazine (No. 852) (8469918743).jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Physochlaina physaloides'' in Curtis's botanical magazine, 1805, (No. 852) (8469918743).

' entry on his new genus :\n\n<blockquote>This is very like ''P. physaloides''; but differs in the higher stature, and more robust habit; in the herb being pale green, and more downy; the calyx being longer; and in the tube of the corolla widening gradually to the top; in the genitals being usually exserted; and in the calyx being less inflated, and hardly twice as long as the capsule.</blockquote >\n\nHeight, robustness and also, to an extent, stem and foliage colour being omitted from the discussion as functions of genetic strain, habitat and nutrition, one is left with relative pubescence, flower shape, exsertion of style and stamens and length and degree of inflation of the fruiting calyx as means of differentiating Don's original two species. To this list may be added the texture of the respective fruiting calyces - as referenced in the common names in Russian of the two species [see above].\n\nIf Physochlaina orientalis were to be demoted to a subspecies of P. physaloides, one would be left with a single, rather variable species, found over an immense range stretching thousands of kilometers from Eastern Turkey through Iran, Central Asia, China and Mongolia all the way to southeastern Siberia.\n\nGiven the Central Asiatic provenance of the not-universally-accepted species ''Physochlaina alaica'' and ''P. semenowii'' and the assertion in ''Flora Iranica'' that P. orientalis may be found in Central Asia, it may be that more than one Physochlaina species will be subsumed in the concept of a variable and very wide-ranging P. physaloides.\n\nSuch variability and wide distribution bear comparison with those of a much better-known Solanaceous plant : ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'', which a consultation of the literature will reveal to have acquired a relatively large number of specific and subspecific names now largely reduced to synonymy with ''A. belladonna'' as local varieties of a single very variable species found from the U.K. in the West to northern Iran in the East.<ref>http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Atropa</ref>\n\n==Gallery I==\nShoot development and anthesis in Physochlaina orientalis \n<gallery>\nFile:IMG 4391 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : shoot from tuberous rootstock at first emergence from soil,showing strong, purple pigmentation of new growth.\nFile:IMG 4403 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after four days displaying silvery pubescence and purple venation of young foliage.\nFile:IMG 4428 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after nine days, bearing developing flower buds displaying imbricate corolla aestivation.\nFile:IMG 4450 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (ten days) emergent corollae displaying incipient purple pigmentation.\nFile:IMG 4464 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (eleven days) emergent corollae fully pigmented.\nFile:IMG 4465 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (twelve days) corollae unfurl to reveal contrasting purple styles and white stigmas.\nFile:IMG 4566 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (thirteen days) Majority of corollae now fully mature and infundibuliform.\n</gallery>\n\n==Gallery II==\nFruiting calyces\n<gallery>\nFile:Physochlaina orientalis, interior fruiting calyx, mature operculum.jpg|Close-up of mature fruiting calyces of ''Physochlaina orientalis'', one angled to show operculum within, shortly before dehiscence of pyxidial seed capsule.

Hist.'' (an abbreviation of the alternative title ''A General History of the Dichlamydeous Plants'') and written between 1832 and 1838. He included in his new genus the two species hitherto known as ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'' L. and ''Hyoscyamus orientalis'' M.

He further coins the name ''Purple-flowered Henbane'' for the Siberian species ''P. physaloides'', but this adds to the confusion, as, not only is the species in question no longer classified as a Henbane ( i.e. ''Hyoscyamus'' ) , but there are also a number of ( true ) ''Hyoscyamus'' spp. which bear purple flowers \u2013 e.g. [[Hyoscyamus muticus]].\n\nThere is, however, a common name (age unknown) for ''Physochlaina'' in [[Russian (language)|Russian]], namely \u041f\u0443\u0437\u044b\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 (''Puzeernitsa'') \u2013 '[[Pig bladder|bladder]] / [[Bubble (physics)|bubble]] plant', qualified \u041f\u0443\u0437\u044b\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0424\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f (''Puzeernitsa Phizalisovaya'') \u2013 ''Physalis-like Bladder plant'' in the case of ''P. physaloides ''.<ref>YouTube.com Physochlaina videos produced by \u0412\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433 \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 (Vokrug Sveta) TV and \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u0443\u0442\u0443\u0513\u0430 (Dmitriy Sutula).</ref> The [[Swedish language|Swedish]] common name for the genus \u2013 ''V\u00e5rbolm\u00f6rt'' \u2013 translates as '[[Spring (season)|Spring]](-flowering) [[Henbane]]',<ref>Glosbe online Swedish dictionary.</ref> while the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] common name ''Kievarinyrtti'' means '[[Inn]] Herb'<ref>Google translate: Finnish to English.</ref> and the Estonian common name is ''Ida-vullrohu'', meaning 'Eastern Henbane'.<ref>Facebook page for Tartu \u00dcllikooli botaanikaaed (= [[University of Tartu Botanical Gardens]] )</ref>\n\nIn [[Turkey (country)|Turkey]], where the species ''Physochlaina orientalis'' is native to the region abutting the easternmost stretch of Turkey's [[Black Sea]] coast, the common name given to the plant is ''Ta\u015f Banotu'', meaning ''Stone Henbane'' i.e. \"the henbane that grows on/out of, stone\" in reference to the plant's ability to thrive in rock crevices [see section below on ''P. orientalis'' with accompanying image of wild specimen growing in crevices in volcanic rock].<ref>https://www.bizimbitkiler.org.tr/v2/sonuc.php?i=Vm0xMFlWbFdWWGhVYmtwUFZsWndUMVl3Vm1GV01XeHpWMjVrV2xadGVIcFhhMUpQVkcxS1NHVkdhRmhXUlRWMldWVmFXbVF4WkhOalJtUlhaV3hhVFZkV1ZtRlhiVlowVW10c1ZXSklRazlaYkZWM1RWWmFWbGRyV2xCV2EwcFRWVVpSZDFCUlBUMD0= Retrieved at 1.30am on 12/2/20</ref><ref>http://www.bizimcicekler.org.tr/gallery.php?taxonID=12831 Retrieved at 2.10am on 12/2/20</ref> The late Professor [[Turhan Baytop]] lists the Turkish common name ''Yalanc\u0131 Banotu'' (= \"False Henbane\") for the plant in his 1963 work on the medicinal and poisonous plants of Turkey.

' of 1838 : <blockquote>'The species of ''Physochlaina'' are extremely desirable plants; being early flowerers, and elegant when in blossom. They will grow in any soil, and are readily propagated by divisions of the root, or by seed. They are well adapted for decorating borders in early spring'.</blockquote>\n\nIn regard to the soil type favoured by wild populations, volume 22 of ''Linnaea'' (in surprisingly geological vein) provides the observation that ''Physochlaina orientalis'' is to be found growing on soils underlain by [[trachyte]]s ([[volcanic rock]]s of a type notably rich in the chemical element [[potassium]], a plant macronutrient essential for the production of flowers and fruit and, in a specifically Solanaceous context, the main ingredient of liquid feed for [[tomato]] plants).\n\n==Use in traditional Chinese medicine==\n[[File:Physochlaina infundibularis single flower.jpg|thumb|Single flower of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' Kuang \u2013 the 'hot ginseng' of [[Mount Hua]], [[Shaanxi]] province.]]\nAt least three species of ''Physochlaina'' are currently used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] : ''P. infundibularis'', ''P. physaloides'' and ''P. praealta''.\n\n=== ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' ===\n\u6f0f\u6597\u6ce1\u56ca\u8349 ''Lou-dou Pao-nang-ts'ao'' / ''lou dou pao nang cao'' (= 'Funnel-shaped ''Physochlaina'' '). The inhabitants of the neighbouring provinces of [[Shaanxi]] (rendered formerly 'Shensi') and [[Henan]] hold ''P. infundibularis'' in high esteem as a medicinal plant, regarding it as a kind of [[ginseng]] : most unusually for a toxic [[Solanaceae|Solanaceous]] plant (totally unrelated botanically to the [[Araliaceae|Araliaceous]] ginseng genus [[Panax]]) it is considered to be a 'general tonic' ( = [[adaptogen]]). The Chinese element \u53c2 ''shen'' (= ''ginseng'') forms a part of two of the common names for the plant, namely \u534e\u5c71\u53c2 ''Hua-shan-shen'' (= ''ginseng of [[Mount Hua]]'') and ''Je-shen'' (= ''hot ginseng'' \u2013 from its hot, sweet, slightly bitter and astringent taste).\n\nAs with Panax, it is the fleshy root of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' that forms the drug : the fresh, raw roots are first peeled and then boiled in a sugar solution containing small quantities of three other herbal drugs, before being dried, ready for storage and use. The three drugs added to the boiling solution are the root of ''[[Glycyrrhiza uralensis]]'', the [[rhizome]] of ''[[Ophiopogon japonicus]]'' and the fruits of ''[[Gardenia jasminoides]]''. This peeling, boiling and addition of 'cooling', [[yin and yang|'yin']] drugs is undertaken to mitigate the 'heat' / toxicity of the ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' roots.\n\nIn addition to its use as an adaptogen, ''P. infundibularis'' is used (in traditional Chinese medicine) in the treatment of [[asthma]], [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]], [[abdominal pain]], [[palpitations]] and [[insomnia]] and as a [[sedative]]. The drug is also used to treat [[diarrhea]] of the kind considered in traditional Chinese medicine to be 'diarrhea due to deficiency of vital energy with symptoms of cold'.<ref>Peigen, Xiao and Liyi, He ''Ethnopharmacologic investigation on tropane-containing drugs in Chinese Solanaceous plants'' in ''Journal of Ethnopharmacology'' Volume 8 No. 1 July (1983) pub.

Furthermore, at the foot of the West Peak of Mount Hua (known as Lianhua Feng (\u84ee\u82b1\u5cf0) or Furong Feng (\u8299\u84c9\u5cf0), both meaning [[Lotus Flower]] Summit) stood, from as early as the second century BCE, a [[Taoist temple]] which was the site of [[Shamanism|shamanic]] practices undertaken by [[Tongji (spirit medium)|spirit mediums]] (see also [[Wu (shaman)]]) to contact an (unnamed) God of the [[Diyu|Underworld]] and his minions, believed to dwell in the heart of the mountain.(See also [[Chinese folk religion]]).<ref>Goossaert, Vincent. \"Huashan.\" in Fabrizio Pregadio, ed., The Encyclopedia of Taoism (London: Routledge, 2008), 481\u2013482.</ref> Tropane-containing, Solanaceous plants (such as ''[[Datura]]'' and ''[[Hyoscyamus]]'' spp.) have a long history of use as entheogens in shamanic practices<ref>Harner, Michael J., ''Hallucinogens and Shamanism'', pub.

When they had returned to their senses, they named these falls The Drunken Rapids and, because one suffers a [[headache]] after such a [[Binge drinking|debauch]], they named the falls that they encountered next Pokhmelnoy Porog [ Russian: \u041f\u043e\u0445\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u041f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433 : The [[Hangover|Hungover]] Rapids ].</Blockquote>\nHis curiosity aroused, Gmelin investigated, and discovered an attractive new species :\n<Blockquote>This account has given me the opportunity to reveal the identity of the beautiful plant involved, which was unknown to any botanist before me : '' Hyoscyamus foliis integerrimis calicibus inflatis subglobosis '' [Botanical Latin : 'The Henbane having simple, untoothed leaves and (fruiting ) calyces that are more or less round and inflated' [ i.e. like those of a [[Physalis]] ]] Linn. h. Ups. 44. 2.</Blockquote>\nHaving identified the ( Linnaean ) genus Hyoscyamus to which the intoxicating plant of The Drunken Rapids ( since moved by Don to the genus Physochlaina ) belonged, Gmelin went on to quiz his local guides and learned the following concerning its intentional consumption :\n<blockquote>If one steeps the leaves or even the finely-chopped roots of this plant in brewed beer \u2013 or, better yet, in beer that is still undergoing [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] \u2013 then it takes but a single glass of such beer to make a man exceedingly foolish : it is surely a strange draught that he quaffs, for he is robbed of all his senses, or at least finds his senses grossly disordered, [[Macropsia|mistaking tiny things for huge ones]] : a straw for the thickest of [[Beam (structure)|beams]], a drop of water for a mighty ocean and a mouse for an elephant. Wherever he goes he encounters [ what he imagines to be ] insurmountable obstacles. He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him, and, as it seems, all this fills him with despair, because his senses are withering away; thus, should one such drunkard go to step over a beam, he will take a great stride out of all proportion to the actual size of it, while another will see deep water in front of him [ where there is only shallow ] such that he dare not venture into it.</blockquote>\nIn conclusion, Gmelin then adds, concerning the plant itself : \n<blockquote>The local inhabitants often use these roots when they want to play a [[practical joke|prank]] upon each other. The Russian merchants often bring these roots back with them when they return to Russia, because they maintain them to be a sovereign remedy for bleeding [[haemorrhoids]] and also against the [[haematuria]] \u2013 a claim which I have been unable to verify.<ref>[[Johann Georg Gmelin]], ''Reise durch Sibirien'' von dem Jahre 1738 bis zum ende 1740, Bd. 3 & 4 , Vandenhoeck, G\u00f6ttingen, 1752.</ref></blockquote>\n\nGmelin's ''Reise durch Sibirien'' \u2013  with its evocative account of his findings concerning the plant now known to science as ''Physochlaina physaloides'' \u2013  received a translation into French which was published as part of Volume 18 of [[Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost]]'s monumental ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des voyages'' \u2013 a compendium of eighteenth century exploration by land and sea, continued beyond the original fifteen volumes, by other authors following the death of Pr\u00e9vost in 1763.

Gmelin and Krasheninnikov's accounts of the effects of intoxication by the plant and mushroom in question both derive from their participation in the extraordinary [[Great Northern Expedition]] (known also as the Second [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] Expedition). As described above, they were travelling together in Central Siberia in the summer of 1738 on the occasion of Gmelin's discovery of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' and learning from the Evenk of the curious effects produced by the beer which they prepared from it. Gmelin was, at the time, one of three professors heading the Academic Group of the expedition, and his particular area of expertise within that group concerned the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms, his brief being to document the fauna, flora and mineral wealth of Siberia encountered in their travels. After many adventures, including the encounter with ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on the Angara river near [[Yeniseysk]], Professors Gmelin and [[Gerhard Friedrich M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller]], student Krasheninnikov and many other expedition members gathered at [[Vitus Bering]]'s base at [[Yakutsk]]. It was from here that Gmelin sent Krasheninnikov ahead to [[Okhotsk]] and Kamchatka to reconnoitre, make preliminary observations and prepare accommodation, and it was thus that he came to be the member of the expedition with the most extensive knowledge of the Kamchatka peninsula,<ref>Hintzsche / Nickol, Die Gro\u00dfe Nordische Expedition</ref> publishing his observations in 1755 in the work ''\u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438'' (''Description of the Land of Kamchatka'') \u2013 from Chapter 14 of which the following passage is translated: \n<blockquote>...persons thus intoxicated [by ''Amanita muscaria''] have hallucinations, as if in a fever; they are subject to various visions, terrifying or felicitous, depending on differences in temperament, owing to which some jump, some dance, others cry and suffer great terrors, while some might deem a small crack to be as wide as a door, and a tub of water as deep as the sea.<ref>Krasheninnikov, Stepan \u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438 (''Opisanie Zemli Kamchatki'' - Description of the Land of Kamchatka), pub.

Harvest/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich - from an edition of 1949 edited under the auspices of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTo the above may readily be compared Gmelin's ''mistaking a drop of water for a mighty ocean'' and ''He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him''.\nThe phenomenon, described in similar terms by Gmelin and Krasheninnikov in their respective accounts, is that of [[macropsia]] - whereby small objects are perceived as being enormous - a symptom of (among other conditions, both natural and self-inflicted) the use of psychoactive drugs<ref>Unnithan SB, Cutting JC. The cocaine experience: Refuting the concept of a model psychosis? Psychopathol 1992; 25: 71-78.</ref> (see also [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome|dysmetropsia]]).\nIt is not clear, in this context, whether the similarity between the two accounts is due simply to the fungal and the plant drug eliciting similar symptoms or whether there has been a borrowing of phraseology from one author to another (in which direction it is hard to say). The inference would likely be that any borrowing were from the Physochlaina account to the Amanita account, were it not for the fact that accounts of macropsia caused by tropane-containing Solanaceae are rare, while those of macropsia caused by ''Amanita muscaria'' are common (or perhaps merely oft-repeated, from a few early sources).\nTo this question one may further adduce the account of ''Amanita muscaria''-induced macropsia in another early source, namely that of [[Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff]], which seems as close in tone to Gmelin's account as does that of Krasheninnikov:\n<blockquote>The nerves are highly stimulated, and in this state the slightest effort of will produces very powerful effects. Consequently, if one wishes to step over a small stick or straw, he steps and jumps as though the obstacles were tree trunks. If a man is ordinarily talkative...he involuntarily blurts out secrets, fully conscious of his actions and aware of his secret but unable to hold his nerves in check. The muscles are controlled by an uncoordinated activity of the nerves themselves, uninfluenced by and unconnected with the higher willpower of the brain, and thus it has occasionally happened that persons in this stage of intoxication found themselves driven irresistibly into ditches, streams, ponds and the like, seeing the impending danger before their eyes but unable to avoid certain death except by the assistance of friends who rushed to their aid.<ref>von Langsdorff, Georg Heinrich ''Einige Bemerkungen, die Eigenschaften des Kamtschadalischen Fliegenschwammes betreffend'' (''Some Remarks Concerning the Properties of the Fly Agaric of Kamchatka'') ''Wetterauischen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr die gesammte Naturkunde.

One recalls also the reference to the danger (or fear) of falling into deep water. Furthermore it is possible that the phrase 'he speaks continually without knowing what he is saying' which has crept into the Pr\u00e9vost ' ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale...'' ' version of Gmelin's account may have influenced von Langsdorff's description of the compulsive blabbering of the Amanita-intoxicated individual.\n\nThe northern Tungusic peoples, such as the Evens of eastern Siberia and the Evenks of central Siberia (encountered by Gmelin), have occasionally been reported to have used ''Amanita muscaria'' as an intoxicant, although with nothing like the frequency of certain other ethnolinguistic groups, such as, for instance, the [[Itelmens]] and [[Koryaks]] encountered by Krasheninnikov.<ref name=\"nyberg1\">{{cite journal|author=Nyberg, H.|year=1992|title=Religious use of hallucinogenic fungi: A comparison between Siberian and Mesoamerican Cultures|journal=Karstenia |volume=32|issue=71\u201380|pages=71\u201380|url=http://www.funga.fi/Karstenia/Karstenia%2032-2%201992-4.pdf|doi=10.29203/ka.1992.294}}</ref>\nThe use of ''Amanita muscaria'' by the Tungus (Evenki) as an additional ingredient to their ''Physochlaina'' beer would furnish yet a third explanation for the similarities in the reported effects of the Tungus drink and the Fly Agaric, but Gmelin makes no mention of such a fungal ingredient and, given that the use of ''Physochlaina'' as an intoxicant appears to have ceased among the Tungus of the Angara river region, no more information on the subject is likely to be forthcoming.\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and the narcotic \"coffee\" of Dauria==\n[[File:Pallas PS by Tardier grey.jpg|thumb|left|18th century [[Prussia]]n botanist, zoologist and [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Peter Simon Pallas]], the first to document [[Transbaikalia|Daurian]] Tungus use of the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' to brew a narcotic \"coffee\".]]\n[[File:John-Tallis-1851-Tibet-Mongolia-and-Manchuria-NE.jpg|thumb|John Tallis's 1851 map of [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]], Mongolia and Manchuria, showing (top left, south of the (then) regional capital [[Nerchinsk]]) ''Tchindat'' (= ''Chindanturuk'') on the river [[Onon River|Onon]], near its confluence with the [[Borzya River|Borzya]] where Pallas encountered ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on Crane Rock (Tungus: ''Kiro\u00e9'').]]\n[[File:Ecoregion PA0804.png|thumb|Daurian forest steppe ecoregion (shaded purple), east of [[Lake Baikal]], west of [[Hulun Lake|Lake Hulun]] and straddling the border between Russia and Mongolia.]]\n[[File:Operational Navigation Chart E-8, 6th edition.jpg|thumb|U.S. navigation chart covering Dauria (Transbaikalia), showing ''Chindanturuk'' under the name ''Chindant pervyy'' i.e. \"First (=oldest) Chindant\", north of salt lakes Barun-Torey and Zu(u)n-Torey on the border with Mongolia (bottom centre).]]\n[[File:\u0421\u043e\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0417\u0443\u043d-\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0439.jpg|thumb|Daurian landscape: the salt lake Zuun-Torey (Pallas's \"Zagan Nuur\"), [[Borzinsky District]], lying just to the south of the [[Borzya River]] (Mongolian: ''Boorj''), a tributary of the Onon.]]\n[[File:Linguistic map of the Tungusic languages (en).png|thumb|Distribution of speakers of Tungusic languages, 2011.

Gauthier de la Peyronie 1793.</ref>\nAfter accepting a professorship at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|St Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] offered him by Empress [[Catherine the Great]], Pallas led an expedition lasting from 1768 to 1774, which took him from the central provinces of Russia far to the east - all the way to the lands beyond [[Lake Baikal]]. It was here in [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]] (a.k.a. \"Dahuria\") - where the eastern extremity of Mongolia meets southern Siberia and western [[Manchuria]] - that he encountered, not only the [[Daur people]] for whom the region is named, but also certain Tungusic tribes who prepared a curious intoxicating drink. The following passage is translated from de la Peyronie\u2019s French edition of 1793.\n<blockquote>1772. 31 May. The road to ''Chindanturuk'' never leaves the river ([[Onon River|Onon]]) with its charming bed. The banks presented a delightful prospect of Spring flowers...At a distance of twenty-seven [[verst]]s from the stream ''Udagata\u00ef'', one finds rising from the shallows of the river a great steep and craggy rock which the Tungus call ''Kiro\u00e9'' (\"[[Crane (bird)|crane]]\" in their language), lying near to the [ junction of the Onon with the river] [[Borzya River|Borsa]]...I observed growing among the [[Urtica|nettles]] which surround the base of this rock the [[Physalis]]-like henbane (''Hyoscyamus physaloides''). The Tungus make use of its narcotic seed; they roast it like [[coffee]] and drink the decoction with their dinner.<ref name= \"Pallas Voyages\"/></blockquote>\nA second account (later in publication date than the ''Reisen...'' but earlier than the ''Voyages...'') of the relevant part of Pallas's expedition by an anonymous anthologist of eighteenth century travel writing provides some further details absent from the French translation and derived possibly from Pallas's original German text.\n<blockquote>The lowlands lead onward to the outpost of Udagatai, and, farther yet to Chindanturuk, where one sees growing in abundance, beneath the nettles which grow beside the rocks, ''Hyosciamus physalodes'' [sic], a rare plant, the intoxicating seed (which ripens toward the end of July) of which the Tungus roast thoroughly in a frying pan, as one roasts coffee, and boil to make a beverage which they drink with their dinner.<ref>[Author anonymous] ''Histoire des Decouvertes faites par divers savans voyageurs dans plusieurs contr\u00e9es de la Russie & de la Perse, relativement \u00e0 l'Histoire civile & naturelle \u00e0 l'\u00c9conomie rurale, au commerce &c''. pub. Aberne, chez Fran\u00e7ois Seizer et Comp., 1787.</ref></blockquote>\nThe question naturally arises as to which Tungusic people (or peoples) it was that Pallas encountered in Dauria. The Daurs themselves are speakers of the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic language]] [[Dagur language|Daur]] (a.k.a. Dagur), but there are three Daurian ethnic groupings of Tungus affiliation, namely the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]], [[Solon people|Solon]] and [[Hamnigan]] (spelled also \"Khamnigan\"). These three have all been considered subgroups of the [[Evenks]], but the Solon and, more especially the Khamnigan have interacted closely with the Mongolic Daur, [[Buryats|Buryat]] and [[Khalkha Mongols|Khalkha]] peoples to the extent that they are ethnically quite distinct from the Evenki of the Yenissei, encountered by Gmelin.<ref>Winston, Robert, ed. (2004). Human: The Definitive Visual Guide. New York: Dorling Kindersley. p. 428. {{ISBN|0-7566-0520-2}}.</ref>\nScholar of eastern Asiatic languages Professor [[Juha Janhunen]] of the [[University of Helsinki]] is of the opinion that the Khamnigan (with whom he has personally undertaken fieldwork) are of Mongolic rather than Tungusic ethnic affiliation and that, of the remaining two groups (Oroqen and Solon), the Oroqen are the closest to the Evenki proper (which group includes the Evenki of the Yenisei basin).<ref>Janhunen, Juha (1996), ''Manchuria: an ethnic history'', Volume 222 of Suomalais-ugrilaisen Seuran toimituksia, Suomalais-ugrilainen Seura, Finno-Ugrian Society</ref> If this is indeed the case, then it may have been the Oroqen who were preparing a narcotic drink from roasted Physochlaina seed, assuming that Physochlaina use was a peculiarly North Tungusic culture trait - as manifested also in the brewing of Physochlaina beer by the Evenki of the Yenisei.\n\nThere remain questions concerning the Tungus \"coffee\" itself: to guess at its effects one would need to know the average tropane alkaloid content of seeds and also to what extent - if any - the roasting or dry-frying of this seed would diminish such content.\n\nA comparison of Gmelin's vivid description of the effects of the Yeniseian Physochlaina beer and such meagre information as is given in Pallas's account of the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of Dauria is instructive: the former paints a picture of an intoxication so strong as to be terrifying rather than pleasurable and accompanied by the profoundly disorientating symptom of macropsia, while the latter suggests almost a Tungus version of a coffee morning or dinner party where a mild [[stimulant]] like coffee or a mild intoxicant like wine is consumed to promote [[Drinking culture|conviviality]]: judging from the testimony of Gmelin, one doubts whether a consumer of Physochlaina beer could muster the coordination to eat at all, let alone converse coherently during a meal. Entheogens, as their name suggests, are generally used in a ritual or religious setting,<ref>Furst, Peter T. ''Hallucinogens and Culture'' pub.

This said, there is nothing in the Gmelin account that smacks of the religious (although it is not known if he ever witnessed Physochlaina intoxication at first hand) and there do not appear to be any surviving accounts of the use of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' in shamanic practices - if, indeed, any such ever existed.\n\n[[Carl Hartwich]] mentions thus the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of the Tungus on page 327 of his monumental ''Die Menschlichen Genussmittel'':\n<blockquote> Hyoscyamus sp. Die ger\u00f6steten samen werden in Sibirien bei den Tungusen benutzt. Die d\u00fcrften stark narkotisch sein. (Welter S. 427)) (Translation: Hyoscyamus sp. The roasted seeds are used by the Tungus in Siberia. They are likely to be very narcotic (Welter S. 427)).<ref name= \"Hartwich Menschlichen\"/></blockquote>\nAs is the case with his note on Tungus Physochlaina beer, Hartwich quotes as a reference, not a primary source in German from the work of an 18th-century explorer, but a secondary French source - in this case a work devoted to coffee and its substitutes by one Henri Welter.,<ref>Welter, Henri, ''Essaie sur l'histoire du Caf\u00e9'', pub. Paris 1868.</ref> page 427 of which bears the note:\n<blockquote>Les [[Kalmuks|Kalmouks]] et les Tongouses de la Sib\u00e9rie se pr\u00e9pare des boissons semblables au caf\u00e9, les premiers avec les graines de ''l'Erable de Tartarie'' (''Acer tartaricum'', L.) et les seconds avec celles d'une esp\u00e8ce de ''jusquiame''.\n(Translation: The Kalmuks and Tungus of Siberia prepare for themselves drinks similar to coffee, the former with the seeds of the Tartar Maple (''Acer tartaricum'' L.) and the latter with those of a species of ''henbane''). </blockquote>\nIt will be seen from the above that the comment concerning the narcotic potential of \"Hyoscyamus\" seed (meaning, in this context, the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'')\nis absent from the Welter source and has been added by the more ethnobotanically-literate Hartwich. Welter's essay on the history of coffee unfortunately lacks a bibliography, but the source of his information is almost certainly Pallas, who makes plain that the plant intended is specifically that now known not as ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'', but as ''Physochlaina physaloides''. Welter and Hartwich mention, respectively, in this context \"a species of ''henbane''\" and \"Hyoscyamus sp.\"\n\n==Chemistry==\n''Physochlaina'' species have yielded a variety of [[tropane alkaloids]], including not only the [[hyoscyamine]] and [[hyoscine|scopolamine]] present also in better-known Solanaceous genera such as [[Atropa]], [[Hyoscyamus]] and [[Scopolia]], but also the new ([[eponymous]]) base physochlaine, first isolated from the aerial parts of the Central Asian species ''Physochlaina alaica'' Korotkova ex Kovalevsk.<ref>Mirzamatov R., Luftullin K., Mallikov V. and Yunusov, S.

( Compare also a similar penchant for growing in rock crevices on the part of the Xinjiang species ''Physochlaina capitata'' \u2013 see above ).\n\nThe plant's country of origin is given in von Bieberstein's original description of ' ''Hyoscyamus orientalis'' ' (now ''Physochlaina orientalis'') as Caucasian [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]]  \u2013 a former kingdom, the heartland of which is the modern [[Georgia (Caucasus)|Georgian]] province of [[Kartli]]. The Caucasian Kingdom of Iberia also encompassed parts of [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], southern [[Russia]] and eastern Turkey.\n\n[[Flora Iranica]] is in agreement on this range of occurrence for ''P. orientalis'', adding also to the list of territories not only north-western Iran but also 'Syr Darja' \u2013 the latter being referable to lands traversed by the river [[Syr Darya]] and, more especially the historic [[Syr-Darya Oblast]] and hence modern [[Uzbekistan]]. Uzbekistan lies outside the area encompassed by Flora Iranica, but parts of neighbouring [[Turkmenistan]] do not. Either way, Flora Iranica is unequivocal in describing the range of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' as extending eastward into [[Central Asia]].\n\n===Physochlaina alaica - an endangered medicinal plant of Central Asia===\nIn this context, it may be noted that Phillips and Rix include in their work on garden perennials a photograph of a second, (not universally accepted) ''Physochlaina'' species of unequivocally Central Asian provenance, namely ''P. alaica'' Korotk. ex Kovalevsk, recorded as growing in the [[Pamir-Alay]], a Central Asian mountain range taking in parts not only of Uzbekistan, but also of [[Tajikistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]. ''Physochlaina alaica'' differs from ''P. orientalis'' in having flowers of a beige or yellowish-buff colour and corolla 'throats' veined within in a contrasting dark brown. As is to be expected of a plant native to the [[Pamirs]], this species is extremely hardy, if grown in dry (i.e. well-drained) conditions.<ref name= \"Perennials 1991\"/> Its common name in the [[Uzbek language]] is ''Oloy xiyoli'',\nof which the first word ''Oloy'' signifies (like the Latin specific name ''alaica'') \"of the Alay mountains\" while the second element ''xiyoli'' appears to bear some relation to the Arabic loan-word ''xiyol'' [pronounced \"khiyol\"] translatable possibly in this context as \"short-lived\" - in reference to the plant's short growing season and quick flowering as a desert ephemeral, fuelled by food reserves stored in its fleshy roots.<ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\">Mamatqulova (Yuldasheva), Gulzira, (2016), ''Ekologik Omillarni O'zbekiston Hududida Tarqalgan Noyob O'simliklarga Ta'siri va Ularni Muhofaza Qilish'' (Translation: \"The Impact of Ecological Factors upon some Unique Plants found within the Territory of [[Uzbekistan]] and Measures Needed for their Protection\"), paper submitted for the degree of BSc, Dept. of Biology and Ecology in the Faculty of Natural Sciences, [[Andijan State University]], Republic of Uzbekistan.

According to her account, the plant is endemic to the Alay and [[Turkestan Range|Turkestan mountains]] of the [[Fergana Region]] (see also [[Fergana Valley]]). In this context she also mentions the Alay Ridge and the basins of the Shohimardon and [[Sokh River|Sokh]] rivers. [Note: there is no page \"Shohimardon River\" on either English or Uzbek Wikipedias, but see page [[Shohimardon]] (village)]. In neighbouring Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, she again mentions the Turkestan range, within which she singles out the villages of [[Vorukh]] and [[Khojabakkir]]. Habitat: the plant is to be found at altitudes between 1,800 and 2,000m, usually in the shade of rocks, bushes or [[Juniper|juniper trees]], but also in open ground. Mamatqulova estimates that there are only some 8,000 plants of this species remaining in the wild. She attributes the increasing rarity of the plant and shrinkage of its range to its over-collection (along with other local species of medicinal plant, such as [[Ungernia|Ungernia victoris]]) for medicinal purposes by the indigenous peoples of the area. The plant is included in the [[IUCN Red List|Red Book]] for the area, despite which no special safeguards have yet been put in place to halt its worrying decline. ''Physochlaina alaica'' has been in cultivation in the [[Botanical Garden of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan]], [[Tashkent]] since 1973.<ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\"/>\n\n===A Glimpse of the Ethnobotany of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' in the extreme NW of Iran===\nIn contrast to the case of its Siberian relative ''Physochlaina physaloides'', ethnobotanical data concerning the [[Western Asia]]n ''P. orientalis'' is somewhat sparse. A recent report from [[Urmia County]] and [[Silvaneh District]] in the Iranian province of [[West Azerbaijan Province|West Azerbaijan]] is thus of particular interest. In 2014 the [[Iranian Students News Agency]] published an online report from the manager of the medicinal plants group of [[Urmia University]] concerning the 'detection' of medicinal properties in two plant species of the West Azerbaijani flora - one of which was ''Physochlaina orientalis''. The locality given for the plants in question is 'Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoy' but is not clear from the context whether plant material from the locality  was collected and analysed for active constituents and/or information was gathered concerning the plants from a local informant with knowledge of the plants' properties. The I.S.N.A. article quotes from an interview with (Dr. ?) Abbas Siami, head of the Zarineh Khoi Institute of Higher Education in which he states the following:\n<blockquote>Thanks to the efforts of researchers at Zarineh Khoi University, the plant ''Physochlaina orientalis'' [was found at] Khoi Heights. It was discovered 'in therapeutic use' [?] at the Heights of Dalampur, Urmia. The Urmia University Department of Medicinal Plants, in describing the therapeutic properties of the plant said: \"This plant is a sedative, nerve stimulant, analgesic, poison and hallucinogen\".</blockquote>\n\nTransliterations of place names in the various languages of Iran from the original [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic script]] forms into Latin script can often yield a confusing number of variant spellings - as is apparent in the variant forms ''Khoi'' and ''Khoy'' and the still more divergent ''Dalampur'', ''Dalampir'' and \n(with a variant medial consonant as well as vowel) ''Dalanpar'' ''Dalanper'' etc.\n''Khoy'' / ''Khoi'' University likely refers to the Khoy campus of Urmia University, while the Heights of ''Dalampur'' (etc.) appears to designate an area of natural beauty and Iranian domestic  tourism encompassing a peak (37\u00b09\u2032N 44\u00b047\u2032E) which forms the [[tripoint]] of Iran, [[Iraq]] and Turkey, lying some 50km from the city of [[Urmia]].<ref>\u06a9\u0634\u0641 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0635 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0648\u064a\u064a \u062f\u0648 \u06af\u064a\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u067e\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u064a (Translation: ''Detection of Medicinal Properties of Two Plants at Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoi'') - article in  I.S.N.A. web archive dated Monday September 21, 2014 1.50pm.

[[Leiden University|Leyden University]] 1775 by [[Nicolaas Meerburgh]] - who also engraved the coloured plates.]]\nAn early botanical illustration - possibly the first such to be made - of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' is that engraved by [[Nicolaas Meerburgh]] (then ''hortulanus'' (director) of the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden]]) for his work of 1775 ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' (= 'Pictures of Rare Plants').\nThe drawing rendered in the engraving is a depiction of a living specimen created when the plant was in flower in the Spring - a realistic portrayal of an outlying portion of an established clump of the plant, uprooted when in full growth for the purposes of illustration, rather than during the more appropriate period (for propagation by division) of the plant's Summer dormancy.\nClearly visible are the tuberous rootstock, with attached roots, and three attached dead stems (two still bearing withered scale leaves) from the previous season's aerial growth. [See image below].\nVan Meerburgh is at great pains to establish in the short preface to his work the richness in rare species and impeccable Linnaean credentials of the Leiden botanic garden and the need he felt to exist to provide accurate botanical illustrations to supplement dry, botanical descriptions.\n\n<blockquote>... experience had taught me daily how difficult it is to distinguish a great many plants, not hitherto well-known, one from another - even those described accurately by Linnaeus and other eminent botanists - and such descriptions may now profitably be compared with actual images of the plants: a better opportunity so to do than I have today could hardly arise, since the Botanic Garden of this University (which need bow to none other in Europe) boasts a great many beautiful species of plant, which one would be hard-pressed to find in many a garden, thanks to the great Linnaeus...and which have - so far as I am aware - been properly depicted nowhere else.<ref>van Meerburgh, Nicolaas, ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' pub. University of Leiden 1775.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn the second page following his introduction, van Meerburgh states thus that the plant depicted in plate 5 of his work is 'Hyoscyamus physalodes' (i.e. the plant now known correctly as ''Physochlaina physaloides'')  :\n\n<blockquote>HYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) TAB. V.\nHYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) foliis ovatis integerrimis,\ncalycibus inflatis subglobosis Linn.

Furthermore the flowers of the specimen display exserted pistils and stamens and the leaves have pointed tips and sinuate margins - all of which suggest an identity compatible more with the Caucasian ''Physochlaina orientalis'' rather than the Siberian ''P. physaloides''. The question could be resolved by recourse to actual plant material held (or grown) by the herbarium and/or garden of Lieden's Hortus Botanicus at the present time.\n\n[Note: the butterfly species depicted in the plate is a Parnassius - possibly ''[[Parnassius mnemosyne]]'', the Clouded Apollo].\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and ''P. orientalis''==\n[[File:Curtis's botanical magazine (No. 852) (8469918743).jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Physochlaina physaloides'' in Curtis's botanical magazine, 1805, (No. 852) (8469918743).

' entry on his new genus :\n\n<blockquote>This is very like ''P. physaloides''; but differs in the higher stature, and more robust habit; in the herb being pale green, and more downy; the calyx being longer; and in the tube of the corolla widening gradually to the top; in the genitals being usually exserted; and in the calyx being less inflated, and hardly twice as long as the capsule.</blockquote >\n\nHeight, robustness and also, to an extent, stem and foliage colour being omitted from the discussion as functions of genetic strain, habitat and nutrition, one is left with relative pubescence, flower shape, exsertion of style and stamens and length and degree of inflation of the fruiting calyx as means of differentiating Don's original two species. To this list may be added the texture of the respective fruiting calyces - as referenced in the common names in Russian of the two species [see above].\n\nIf Physochlaina orientalis were to be demoted to a subspecies of P. physaloides, one would be left with a single, rather variable species, found over an immense range stretching thousands of kilometers from Eastern Turkey through Iran, Central Asia, China and Mongolia all the way to southeastern Siberia.\n\nGiven the Central Asiatic provenance of the not-universally-accepted species ''Physochlaina alaica'' and ''P. semenowii'' and the assertion in ''Flora Iranica'' that P. orientalis may be found in Central Asia, it may be that more than one Physochlaina species will be subsumed in the concept of a variable and very wide-ranging P. physaloides.\n\nSuch variability and wide distribution bear comparison with those of a much better-known Solanaceous plant : ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'', which a consultation of the literature will reveal to have acquired a relatively large number of specific and subspecific names now largely reduced to synonymy with ''A. belladonna'' as local varieties of a single very variable species found from the U.K. in the West to northern Iran in the East.<ref>http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Atropa</ref>\n\n==Gallery I==\nShoot development and anthesis in Physochlaina orientalis \n<gallery>\nFile:IMG 4391 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : shoot from tuberous rootstock at first emergence from soil,showing strong, purple pigmentation of new growth.\nFile:IMG 4403 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after four days displaying silvery pubescence and purple venation of young foliage.\nFile:IMG 4428 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after nine days, bearing developing flower buds displaying imbricate corolla aestivation.\nFile:IMG 4450 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (ten days) emergent corollae displaying incipient purple pigmentation.\nFile:IMG 4464 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (eleven days) emergent corollae fully pigmented.\nFile:IMG 4465 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (twelve days) corollae unfurl to reveal contrasting purple styles and white stigmas.\nFile:IMG 4566 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (thirteen days) Majority of corollae now fully mature and infundibuliform.\n</gallery>\n\n==Gallery II==\nFruiting calyces\n<gallery>\nFile:Physochlaina orientalis, interior fruiting calyx, mature operculum.jpg|Close-up of mature fruiting calyces of ''Physochlaina orientalis'', one angled to show operculum within, shortly before dehiscence of pyxidial seed capsule.

Once upon a time he was a lawyer.\"\n\n[[File:1978667 617502671638121 2046061910 n.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\n== About==\n\nDr Mark Tredinnick won the Montreal International Poetry Prize in 2011 and the Cardiff International Poetry Prize in 2012. A distinctly Australian poet but also a poet of the world, Tredinnick has been described as 'one of our great poets of place\u2014not just of geographic place, but of the spiritual and moral landscapes as well\u2014a Whitmanesque Emily Dickinson of the southern hemisphere.' Tredinnick's 'artlessly beautiful poetry' has won for him in recent years, as well as the international prizes, a number of major Australian awards\u2014[[Blake Poetry Prize|The Blake]] and [[Newcastle Poetry Prize|Newcastle Prizes]], among them, and a Premier's Literature Prize (for Fire Diary). His poems 'work elegantly and intimately over a huge terrain.' Tredinnick's poetry is poetry of witness: small moments, epiphanies, weather, birds, children, the divine comedy of everyday life, the \u2018beautiful struggle, the ordinary trouble\u2019 we find ourselves in, the beauty and peril of the natural world.\n\n\"I am a fool for places,\" Tredinnick has written, \"and for the vulgar, semantic music of sentences. I have grown deeply attached to the physicality and mystery of landforms and language. To the country people inhabit\u2014and which sometimes inhabits them\u2014and to the words people use to speak their truths and falsehoods.\"\n\nTredinnick also says: \"We need words and country more than we seem to remember; our futures may depend, now more than ever, on how well we use and how healthy we keep them both. Because I believe this, and because I cannot help it, my work often wanders the syntax of places and it tries the ecology of sentences; I want to hear and I\u2019d like to say what the land seems to know\u2014about us, I mean, and about itself and time and how we might use well what little we have.\"\n\nTredinnick's poetry explores \u2018ancient themes\u2014especially the theme of our human relationship with landscape\u2019, [[Andrew Motion|Sir Andrew Motion]] has written. Tredinnick's concern to divine both language and landscape and the way they interact led to his doctoral work on nature writing, completed in 2003, at the [[University of Western Sydney]]. Although he hasn't pursued an academic career, Tredinnick could be understood, in and beyond his poetry, as an ecocritic. He has written and spoken widely and often on [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s theme: \u201cin wildness is the preservation of the world.\u201d His doctorate Writing the Wild: Place, Prose, and the Ecological Imagination became his second book, ''The Land\u2019s Wild Music'' (2004), and with Professor Kate Rigby, he cofounded the Australian chapter of the Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment. His poetry and nature writing have been the focus of doctoral work and scholarship, in particular in China, where ecocriticism is a strong emergent field of academic work.\n\nAlong with his volumes of poetry\u2014 ''Bluewren Cantos'' (2013), ''Fire Diary'' (2010), ''The Lyrebird'' (2011), and ''The Road South'' (spoken word CD, 2008)\u2014 ''Tredinnick's thirteen books include the landscape memoir,''  ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009), ''four books on the writing craft, including'', ''The Little Red Writing Book'' (2006), and ''Australian Love Poems,'' which he edited in 2013.\n\nA bilingual (Chinese/English) selection of his poems (''The Lyrebird'') is due out late in 2014, along with his third collection of poems, ''Body Copy.'' He is working on a memoir of a reading life, Reading Slowly at the End of Time (2015).\n\n[[File:Mark Tredinnick.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick no longer lives with his family along the Wingecarribee River, southwest of Sydney. He spends much of his time teaching and consulting in the city. Although his daily writing practice is poetry (\"poetry is most of what I write now; it is how I live\", he has said), Tredinnick continues to write essays, criticism, reviews, and other prose, from his desk in a cowshed outside Bowral. He spent a long writing apprenticeship in prose, and published several prose books and hundreds of essays, before his first poems were published in the early 2005. As well as poetry workshops, Tredinnick teaches literary journalism, creative writing, and creative nonfiction at the [[University of Sydney]], and he has three times been a judge of the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards|NSW Premier's Prize]] in the nonfiction category,  [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Douglas Stewart Prize for Non-Fiction|Douglas Stewart Prize]]. Tredinnick's work, The Blue Plateau, an extended lyric essay on the life of one place on earth, won the [[Queensland Premier's Literary Awards|Queensland Premier's Literary Award]] in 2010 and was shortlisted for the Prime Minister's Literary Award the same year. Novelist Tony Birch nominated it as the one book he would give to anyone coming to Australia; 'it captures,' he said, 'what belonging to this antipodean place means and has meant through time.\u2019\nDrawing on his writing guides\u2014''The Little Red Writing Book, The Little Green Grammar Book'' and (with Geoff Whyte) ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing''\u2014Tredinnick also works with organisations in the government, education and private sectors to help them write with economy and grace. \nTredinnick's poetry and essays are widely anthologised and published in journals, blogs and newspapers, in Australia and internationally. and it has appeared in journals including Australian Book Review, Australian Poetry, Contrappasso, [[Eureka Street (magazine)|Eureka Street]], Island, Isotope, Magma, Mascara, Meanjin, New Welsh Review, Orion, PAN, [[Poetry London]], The Scotsman, Southerly, Wet Ink, The Wonderbook of Poetry, and [[World Literature Today]]. \nFor nearly twenty years, Tredinnick has taught and lectured poetry, creative nonfiction, grammar, nature writing, and composition at universities (chiefly the University of Sydney). He has been a guest of many literary and poetry festivals around the world, including the Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, Perth, Oxford, and Ubud Festivals, and the Ottawa Poetry Festival (VerseFest). He has spent teaching residencies at the Universities of Alaska, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, the University of Aberystwyth and the [[University of Wales]], [[University of Wales, Trinity Saint David|Trinity Saint David]].\n\nIn the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] Tredinnick was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for \"service to literature, and to education\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/2005311|title=Dr Mark Tredinnick|last=|first=|date=|website=honours.pmc.gov.au|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\nTredinnick, the grandson of Methodist minister, Wesley Tredinnick, the second of four sons of Bruce and Heather Tredinnick, was born in Epping, in suburban Sydney.  He went to primary school at North Epping Public School and won a bursary to [[Barker College]], Hornsby, an Anglican private school, where he completed his schooling in 1979. He took a double degree (with Honours) in Arts and Law at the University of Sydney University, majoring in history, and taking courses in philosophy, in addition to law.  In the last year of his degree, Tredinnick worked part-time as a paralegal for Allen Allen & Hemsley, before accepting a clerkship with Mallesons Stephen Jaques, one of Sydney's leading law firms. Tredinnick worked as a solicitor with Mallesons for a year, before moving into book publishing, where he stayed for nearly a decade; he worked as an editor and publisher at Butterworths, Allen & Unwin and HarperCollins. Tredinnick says of those years: \u2018they were part of my education as a writer, of course; I was learning what a sentence was; I was practising grammar and learning about design; I was learning what it took, the years and years sometimes, to make a book and to make it good enough to share.\u2019   \nTredinnick left the corporate world and began to write and teach writing (and some courses in leadership and organizational studies in Politics at the [[University of Sydney]]).\nIt was from Katoomba and a small apartment in Lavender Bay that Tredinnick wrote and published his first poems and won his first prizes. Tredinnick also travelled North America and worked on his doctoral thesis, a study of nature writing and an attempt to retheorise the capacity of prose to represent landscapes and the more than merely human world\u2014to 'catch the lyric of country', as he puts it. Tredinnick took his doctorate in 2003 and his thesis was published in 2005\n\nTredinnick's first book, an edited collection of nature writing essays from Australian and North America, ''A Place on Earth'', came out in 2003 in Australia (2004 in the United States). After that came ''The Land's Wild Music'' in 2005; ''The Little Red Writing Book'' in 2006; ''The Little Green Grammar Book'' in 2008; ''Writing Well'' (an adaptation of ''The Little Red Writing Book'' for the international market) also in 2008); ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009 in Australia; 2010 in the United States); ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing'' (with Geoff Whyte) in 2010; ''Australia's Wild Weather'' in 2011.\n\nTredinnick's first collection of poems, ''The Road South'', appeared as a spoken-word CD in 2008. His first volume of poems was Fire Diary, published in late 2010. That was followed by ''The Lyrebird'', a chapbook, in 2011 and ''Bluewren Cantos'' in 2013.\n\n[[File:10171025 634856153236106 2660669453524416387 n.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick's emergence as a poet was marked by a string of major Australian prizes, in particular the Newcastle Poetry Prize in 2007 and the Blake Poetry Prize in 2009. His work became better known outside Australia when he won the inaugural Montreal International Poetry Prize in 2011 and the Cardiff Prize the next year. In Australia, he won the Newcastle Prize second time in 2011 and took out some significant literary prizes for his books: the Queensland Premier's Literary Prize 2010 for ''The Blue Plateau'' and the West Australian Premier's Prize 2011 for ''Fire Diary''.\n\nIn 2013 he edited Australian Love Poems for a start-up literary press, Inkerman & Blunt. [[Pitt Street Poetry]], who published his second volume of poems, ''Bluewren Cantos'' in December 2013, released a second edition of ''Fire Diary'' early the following year.\n\nTredinnick's works and days\u2014the difficult dance between the silence of the desk, the higher frequencies of family life, the demands of earning a living to \"finance the silence\", as he puts it, and feed the family\u2014are discussed in a long interview he gave to ''Perilous Adventures'' magazine in 2010, and are glossed in a number of his poems, in particular \"Insolvency\", \"Eclogues\", and \"The Economics of Spring\" (in ''Fire Diary'').\n\n==Style==\n\nTredinnick's poetry often employs a long, stepped-down line. Poetry is an \"architecture of utterance\", he has said, \"a sculpture of voice.\" And his poems, though informal in voice, present themselves as small geographies, places, language worlds both sonic and visual. Although his architectures resemble sometimes the sestets of Charles Wright, whose influence and kinship Tredinnick has acknowledged, unlike Wright, Tredinnick's syntax is often complex, his sentences long, \"breathtakingly fluent\" (as Sinead Morrissey has put it), deltaic. His poetry, though painstakingly made and precise, is expansive, pushing against the forms it employs. Commenting on the tension between minute details and grandiosity, Australian novelist Greg Day has called him a \"failed minimalist.\" Bluewren Cantos, Mark's latest book of poetry, is praised as \"A gentle mix of the sublime and the mundane, so that we are invited to let such dualisms be undone in us.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref> The critic Michelle Borzi finds that Tredinnick's \"habit of relying on atmospheric image-making and self-intrusive references to impel the lines is a defining attribute of the poetry throughout ''Fire Diary''.\"<ref>[http://southerlyjournal.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/73.1_LP-Michelle-Borzi.pdf]</ref>\n\nTredinnick described his essays once as \"half chat, half chant\", and his poetic voice lies, similarly, between conversation and song. Informality is a key to his lyric. \nHe has named poets John Keats and Gerard Manley Hopkins, Emily Dickinson, Mary Oliver, Jane Kenyon, and Seamus Heaney, Robert Gray, Dylan Thomas, and Charles Wright, as influences and teachers. He also cites Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and Debussy, and painters Van Gogh and Matisse. And the voices of lyric prose writers play in Tredinnick's poetry, as in his prose: Michael Ondaatje, Joan Didion, Barry Lopez, Peter Matthiessen, David Malouf, and Cormac McCarthy.\n\nTalking specifically of ''Bluewren Cantos'', poet and critic Jean Kent neatly summarises Tredinnick's poetics, including the way his work nearly always starts in place, but reaches out toward intimacy with a loved one, with the dead, with that which is most human in each of us.<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\n\"Like the singing of birds, it all feels artlessly beautiful, but only because of the exceptional art, which keeps the music of what\u2019s being said mesmerising. Behind the flowing lines and hypnotic melodies, there is as much control of the rhythm and counterpoint and harmony as there is in any of the compositions by Bach or Mozart or Debussy, composers who compete with all the real birds in Mark\u2019s Wingecarribee landscape.  Even before he began publishing poetry, Mark was renowned as a nature writer. His sensitivity to place and his ability to celebrate the Australian landscape are special joys in all his poems.\nOften, Mark\u2019s poems begin with nature \u2013 but invariably the solitary presence of the poet reaches out to another person \u2013 often a loved person \u2013 or, in an intimate connection, to the reader.\nThis is poetry like tightrope walking \u2013 a nonchalant, though thoughtful, ambling out into the world, which almost leads us into a transcendental state \u2013 only to be caught in a web of emotion and thought and connections to the daily reality of living. Tredinnick\u2019s poems are also full of playful paradoxes and wry humour.  His tone may be debonair, well-dressed and conscious of manners and historical allegiances, but for all the hypnotic oratory, his voice is both questing and self-deprecating, and the earth he walks over is emphatically today\u2019s.\"<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\nPoet Anne Elvey has said that Tredinnick \"Weaves the tropes of attentiveness to the other, mortality, and finitude, together with his wry humour, to tell a loving engagement with place, persons and otherkind.

A distinctly Australian poet but also a poet of the world, Tredinnick has been described as 'one of our great poets of place\u2014not just of geographic place, but of the spiritual and moral landscapes as well\u2014a Whitmanesque Emily Dickinson of the southern hemisphere.' Tredinnick's 'artlessly beautiful poetry' has won for him in recent years, as well as the international prizes, a number of major Australian awards\u2014[[Blake Poetry Prize|The Blake]] and [[Newcastle Poetry Prize|Newcastle Prizes]], among them, and a Premier's Literature Prize (for Fire Diary). His poems 'work elegantly and intimately over a huge terrain.' Tredinnick's poetry is poetry of witness: small moments, epiphanies, weather, birds, children, the divine comedy of everyday life, the \u2018beautiful struggle, the ordinary trouble\u2019 we find ourselves in, the beauty and peril of the natural world.\n\n\"I am a fool for places,\" Tredinnick has written, \"and for the vulgar, semantic music of sentences. I have grown deeply attached to the physicality and mystery of landforms and language. To the country people inhabit\u2014and which sometimes inhabits them\u2014and to the words people use to speak their truths and falsehoods.\"\n\nTredinnick also says: \"We need words and country more than we seem to remember; our futures may depend, now more than ever, on how well we use and how healthy we keep them both. Because I believe this, and because I cannot help it, my work often wanders the syntax of places and it tries the ecology of sentences; I want to hear and I\u2019d like to say what the land seems to know\u2014about us, I mean, and about itself and time and how we might use well what little we have.\"\n\nTredinnick's poetry explores \u2018ancient themes\u2014especially the theme of our human relationship with landscape\u2019, [[Andrew Motion|Sir Andrew Motion]] has written. Tredinnick's concern to divine both language and landscape and the way they interact led to his doctoral work on nature writing, completed in 2003, at the [[University of Western Sydney]]. Although he hasn't pursued an academic career, Tredinnick could be understood, in and beyond his poetry, as an ecocritic. He has written and spoken widely and often on [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s theme: \u201cin wildness is the preservation of the world.\u201d His doctorate Writing the Wild: Place, Prose, and the Ecological Imagination became his second book, ''The Land\u2019s Wild Music'' (2004), and with Professor Kate Rigby, he cofounded the Australian chapter of the Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment. His poetry and nature writing have been the focus of doctoral work and scholarship, in particular in China, where ecocriticism is a strong emergent field of academic work.\n\nAlong with his volumes of poetry\u2014 ''Bluewren Cantos'' (2013), ''Fire Diary'' (2010), ''The Lyrebird'' (2011), and ''The Road South'' (spoken word CD, 2008)\u2014 ''Tredinnick's thirteen books include the landscape memoir,''  ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009), ''four books on the writing craft, including'', ''The Little Red Writing Book'' (2006), and ''Australian Love Poems,'' which he edited in 2013.\n\nA bilingual (Chinese/English) selection of his poems (''The Lyrebird'') is due out late in 2014, along with his third collection of poems, ''Body Copy.'' He is working on a memoir of a reading life, Reading Slowly at the End of Time (2015).\n\n[[File:Mark Tredinnick.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick no longer lives with his family along the Wingecarribee River, southwest of Sydney. He spends much of his time teaching and consulting in the city. Although his daily writing practice is poetry (\"poetry is most of what I write now; it is how I live\", he has said), Tredinnick continues to write essays, criticism, reviews, and other prose, from his desk in a cowshed outside Bowral. He spent a long writing apprenticeship in prose, and published several prose books and hundreds of essays, before his first poems were published in the early 2005. As well as poetry workshops, Tredinnick teaches literary journalism, creative writing, and creative nonfiction at the [[University of Sydney]], and he has three times been a judge of the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards|NSW Premier's Prize]] in the nonfiction category,  [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Douglas Stewart Prize for Non-Fiction|Douglas Stewart Prize]]. Tredinnick's work, The Blue Plateau, an extended lyric essay on the life of one place on earth, won the [[Queensland Premier's Literary Awards|Queensland Premier's Literary Award]] in 2010 and was shortlisted for the Prime Minister's Literary Award the same year. Novelist Tony Birch nominated it as the one book he would give to anyone coming to Australia; 'it captures,' he said, 'what belonging to this antipodean place means and has meant through time.\u2019\nDrawing on his writing guides\u2014''The Little Red Writing Book, The Little Green Grammar Book'' and (with Geoff Whyte) ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing''\u2014Tredinnick also works with organisations in the government, education and private sectors to help them write with economy and grace. \nTredinnick's poetry and essays are widely anthologised and published in journals, blogs and newspapers, in Australia and internationally. and it has appeared in journals including Australian Book Review, Australian Poetry, Contrappasso, [[Eureka Street (magazine)|Eureka Street]], Island, Isotope, Magma, Mascara, Meanjin, New Welsh Review, Orion, PAN, [[Poetry London]], The Scotsman, Southerly, Wet Ink, The Wonderbook of Poetry, and [[World Literature Today]]. \nFor nearly twenty years, Tredinnick has taught and lectured poetry, creative nonfiction, grammar, nature writing, and composition at universities (chiefly the University of Sydney). He has been a guest of many literary and poetry festivals around the world, including the Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, Perth, Oxford, and Ubud Festivals, and the Ottawa Poetry Festival (VerseFest). He has spent teaching residencies at the Universities of Alaska, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, the University of Aberystwyth and the [[University of Wales]], [[University of Wales, Trinity Saint David|Trinity Saint David]].\n\nIn the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] Tredinnick was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for \"service to literature, and to education\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/2005311|title=Dr Mark Tredinnick|last=|first=|date=|website=honours.pmc.gov.au|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\nTredinnick, the grandson of Methodist minister, Wesley Tredinnick, the second of four sons of Bruce and Heather Tredinnick, was born in Epping, in suburban Sydney.  He went to primary school at North Epping Public School and won a bursary to [[Barker College]], Hornsby, an Anglican private school, where he completed his schooling in 1979. He took a double degree (with Honours) in Arts and Law at the University of Sydney University, majoring in history, and taking courses in philosophy, in addition to law.  In the last year of his degree, Tredinnick worked part-time as a paralegal for Allen Allen & Hemsley, before accepting a clerkship with Mallesons Stephen Jaques, one of Sydney's leading law firms. Tredinnick worked as a solicitor with Mallesons for a year, before moving into book publishing, where he stayed for nearly a decade; he worked as an editor and publisher at Butterworths, Allen & Unwin and HarperCollins. Tredinnick says of those years: \u2018they were part of my education as a writer, of course; I was learning what a sentence was; I was practising grammar and learning about design; I was learning what it took, the years and years sometimes, to make a book and to make it good enough to share.\u2019   \nTredinnick left the corporate world and began to write and teach writing (and some courses in leadership and organizational studies in Politics at the [[University of Sydney]]).\nIt was from Katoomba and a small apartment in Lavender Bay that Tredinnick wrote and published his first poems and won his first prizes. Tredinnick also travelled North America and worked on his doctoral thesis, a study of nature writing and an attempt to retheorise the capacity of prose to represent landscapes and the more than merely human world\u2014to 'catch the lyric of country', as he puts it. Tredinnick took his doctorate in 2003 and his thesis was published in 2005\n\nTredinnick's first book, an edited collection of nature writing essays from Australian and North America, ''A Place on Earth'', came out in 2003 in Australia (2004 in the United States). After that came ''The Land's Wild Music'' in 2005; ''The Little Red Writing Book'' in 2006; ''The Little Green Grammar Book'' in 2008; ''Writing Well'' (an adaptation of ''The Little Red Writing Book'' for the international market) also in 2008); ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009 in Australia; 2010 in the United States); ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing'' (with Geoff Whyte) in 2010; ''Australia's Wild Weather'' in 2011.\n\nTredinnick's first collection of poems, ''The Road South'', appeared as a spoken-word CD in 2008. His first volume of poems was Fire Diary, published in late 2010. That was followed by ''The Lyrebird'', a chapbook, in 2011 and ''Bluewren Cantos'' in 2013.\n\n[[File:10171025 634856153236106 2660669453524416387 n.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick's emergence as a poet was marked by a string of major Australian prizes, in particular the Newcastle Poetry Prize in 2007 and the Blake Poetry Prize in 2009. His work became better known outside Australia when he won the inaugural Montreal International Poetry Prize in 2011 and the Cardiff Prize the next year. In Australia, he won the Newcastle Prize second time in 2011 and took out some significant literary prizes for his books: the Queensland Premier's Literary Prize 2010 for ''The Blue Plateau'' and the West Australian Premier's Prize 2011 for ''Fire Diary''.\n\nIn 2013 he edited Australian Love Poems for a start-up literary press, Inkerman & Blunt. [[Pitt Street Poetry]], who published his second volume of poems, ''Bluewren Cantos'' in December 2013, released a second edition of ''Fire Diary'' early the following year.\n\nTredinnick's works and days\u2014the difficult dance between the silence of the desk, the higher frequencies of family life, the demands of earning a living to \"finance the silence\", as he puts it, and feed the family\u2014are discussed in a long interview he gave to ''Perilous Adventures'' magazine in 2010, and are glossed in a number of his poems, in particular \"Insolvency\", \"Eclogues\", and \"The Economics of Spring\" (in ''Fire Diary'').\n\n==Style==\n\nTredinnick's poetry often employs a long, stepped-down line. Poetry is an \"architecture of utterance\", he has said, \"a sculpture of voice.\" And his poems, though informal in voice, present themselves as small geographies, places, language worlds both sonic and visual. Although his architectures resemble sometimes the sestets of Charles Wright, whose influence and kinship Tredinnick has acknowledged, unlike Wright, Tredinnick's syntax is often complex, his sentences long, \"breathtakingly fluent\" (as Sinead Morrissey has put it), deltaic. His poetry, though painstakingly made and precise, is expansive, pushing against the forms it employs. Commenting on the tension between minute details and grandiosity, Australian novelist Greg Day has called him a \"failed minimalist.\" Bluewren Cantos, Mark's latest book of poetry, is praised as \"A gentle mix of the sublime and the mundane, so that we are invited to let such dualisms be undone in us.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref> The critic Michelle Borzi finds that Tredinnick's \"habit of relying on atmospheric image-making and self-intrusive references to impel the lines is a defining attribute of the poetry throughout ''Fire Diary''.\"<ref>[http://southerlyjournal.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/73.1_LP-Michelle-Borzi.pdf]</ref>\n\nTredinnick described his essays once as \"half chat, half chant\", and his poetic voice lies, similarly, between conversation and song. Informality is a key to his lyric. \nHe has named poets John Keats and Gerard Manley Hopkins, Emily Dickinson, Mary Oliver, Jane Kenyon, and Seamus Heaney, Robert Gray, Dylan Thomas, and Charles Wright, as influences and teachers. He also cites Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and Debussy, and painters Van Gogh and Matisse. And the voices of lyric prose writers play in Tredinnick's poetry, as in his prose: Michael Ondaatje, Joan Didion, Barry Lopez, Peter Matthiessen, David Malouf, and Cormac McCarthy.\n\nTalking specifically of ''Bluewren Cantos'', poet and critic Jean Kent neatly summarises Tredinnick's poetics, including the way his work nearly always starts in place, but reaches out toward intimacy with a loved one, with the dead, with that which is most human in each of us.<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\n\"Like the singing of birds, it all feels artlessly beautiful, but only because of the exceptional art, which keeps the music of what\u2019s being said mesmerising. Behind the flowing lines and hypnotic melodies, there is as much control of the rhythm and counterpoint and harmony as there is in any of the compositions by Bach or Mozart or Debussy, composers who compete with all the real birds in Mark\u2019s Wingecarribee landscape.  Even before he began publishing poetry, Mark was renowned as a nature writer. His sensitivity to place and his ability to celebrate the Australian landscape are special joys in all his poems.\nOften, Mark\u2019s poems begin with nature \u2013 but invariably the solitary presence of the poet reaches out to another person \u2013 often a loved person \u2013 or, in an intimate connection, to the reader.\nThis is poetry like tightrope walking \u2013 a nonchalant, though thoughtful, ambling out into the world, which almost leads us into a transcendental state \u2013 only to be caught in a web of emotion and thought and connections to the daily reality of living. Tredinnick\u2019s poems are also full of playful paradoxes and wry humour.  His tone may be debonair, well-dressed and conscious of manners and historical allegiances, but for all the hypnotic oratory, his voice is both questing and self-deprecating, and the earth he walks over is emphatically today\u2019s.\"<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\nPoet Anne Elvey has said that Tredinnick \"Weaves the tropes of attentiveness to the other, mortality, and finitude, together with his wry humour, to tell a loving engagement with place, persons and otherkind. This is poetry as blessing. It is a poetics of witness.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\n'''Books'''\n\nWestern Australian Premier's Book Award (winner, poetry), 2011: ''Fire Diary''\n\nQueensland Premier's Literary Awards (winner, nonfiction), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n                                                                                            \nPrime Minister's Literary Awards (shortlisted), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n\nACT Book of the Year (shortlisted), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n\nAlec Bolton (ACT Arts prize for unpublished manuscript) (highly commended), 2010: ''Fire Diary''\n\n\n'''Poetry'''\n\n'''1<sup>st</sup> Prize'''\n\nRon Petty Poetry Prize, winner 2017: \u201cPanic Very Softly, Love\u201d\n\nACU Prize for Literature, winner 2016: \u201cThe Horse\u201d\n\nCardiff International Poetry Prize, winner 2012: \u201cMargaret River Sestets\u201d\n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, winner 2011: \u201cWalking Underwater\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, winner 2011: \u201cThe Wombat Vedas\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, winner 2008: \u201cHave You Seen\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, winner 2007: \u201cEclogues\u201d\n\nGwen Harwood Poetry Prize, winner 2005: \u201cThe Child & Time\u201d\n\n\n'''2<sup>nd</sup> Prize'''\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, second 2018: \u201cThe River Running Shallow\u201d\n\nACU Prize for Literature, second 2013: \u201cLight Years\u201d\n\nJosephine Ulrick Poetry Prize, runner up 2009: \u201cRed Tulips\u201d\n\n\n'''3<sup>rd</sup> Prize''' \n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, third 2019: \u201cOctober Morning After Rain\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, third 2013: \u201cTwo or Three Days in late October with Claude Debussy\u201d \n\n'''Shortlisted''' \n\nABR (now Peter Porter) Poetry Prize, short listed 2019: \u201cRaven\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2019: \u201cThe Blue Pasture\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2019: \u201cThe News\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2019: \u201cGrace, and a Barking Owl\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2018: \u201cThe Reservoir\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2018: \u201cGrief Wears a Body\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2016: \u201cShred\u201d \n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2016: \u201cEnd of Lonely Day\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cWeeding\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cSpring Snow, Reno\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2013: \u201cFaith\u201d \n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2013: \u201cThe Reader\u201d\n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2011: \u201cThe Kingfisher\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2011: \u201cAt Home on a Sunday Trying to Find Nothing to Do\u201d\n\nABR (now Peter Porter) Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2005: \u201cUbirr Rock\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cThe Propinquity of Snow\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cThe Propinquity of Snow\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cNightfishing\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2009: \u201cBrisbane River Blues\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2008: \u201cWindflowers\u201d \n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2006: \u201cLake St Clair Cycle\u201d\n\n\n\n'''Longlisted'''\n\nUniversity of Canberra Vice-Chancellor\u2019s International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2014: \u201cWalking My Name Back Home\u201d \n\nUniversity of Canberra Vice-Chancellor\u2019s International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2014: \u201cThat Day\u201d \n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2011:\"You Over There;

The district is an independent public entity, and is governed by the district Board of Education, whose members are elected in non-partisan elections for staggered, three-year terms. The board selects a [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]], who is the district's chief administrative official. The district's offices are located in Todd Elementary School.\n\nThe district has three schools: Todd Elementary School, Briarcliff Middle School and [[Briarcliff High School]]. It has about 1,535 students, and spends an average of $24,858 per pupil and has a [[student\u2013teacher ratio]] of 11:1 (the national averages are $12,435 and 15.3:1 respectively). The district is a part of the Putnam-Northern Westchester [[Board of Cooperative Educational Services]]. The Briarcliff Manor UFSD won first place for the small district category of the 2008 Digital School Districts Survey and currently provided 1 to 1 devices to all students in grades 4 through 12.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1865, a one-room schoolhouse was built on land donated by John Whitson on the south side of Pleasantville Road, between the [[Pocantico River]] and the [[New York & Putnam Railroad]] (now [[NY Route 9A]]/[[New York State Route 100|100]]).<ref>{{cite map|author=Frederick.

The building failed to meet requirements set by New York's commissioner of education, and thus in 1910, it became the Briarcliff Community Center, a social organization established by the village.{{refn|group=nb|The organization ceased to exist in 1927; the building burned down in 1928, shortly after scheduled demolition to make way for the Briarcliff-Peekskill Parkway.<ref name=\"Changing Landscape\"/>{{rp|page=75}}}} Around the same time, in 1908, $50,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|50000|1908}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) was voted for Briarcliff Manor to buy a plot by Law Memorial Park, and the school moved again, to the [[Spanish Renaissance architecture|Spanish Renaissance-style]] Grade School building, which was built there the following year.<ref name=\"1977history\"/>{{rp|page=50}} Students would attend that school from [[kindergarten]] to [[ninth grade]] and have the option to then attend the nearby [[Ossining High School]]. In 1918, the Briarcliff school began educating students through high school; in 1928, a dedicated wing for high school students was built onto the Grade School building. The enlarged school accepted students from Croton, Hawthorne, North White Plains, Valhalla, and as far as [[Granite Springs, New York|Granite Springs]].<ref name=\"Changing Landscape\"/>{{rp|page=68}}\n\nIn 1953, Todd Elementary School opened to free space at the Law Park grade school for middle- and high-school students.<ref name=\"Changing Landscape\"/>{{rp|page=153}} The present high school opened in 1971 to ease the large enrollment at the Grade School building.<ref name=\"Changing Landscape\"/>{{rp|page=154}} The district under its current name was officially established in 1974.<ref name=\"1977history\"/>{{rp|page=58}}\n\nIn 1980, [[Pace University]] began leasing the middle school building, and the middle school was moved to a portion of the new high school building. The Grade School building was demolished in 1996, and a [[retirement home]] was built on its site the following year. In the early 2000s, the current Briarcliff Middle School was constructed adjoining to the high school.<ref name=\"Centennial\"/> The wing was completed in 2003 at a cost of $24 million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|24000000|2003}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) in the same red-brick-and-glass style as the high school wing.<ref name=\"NewWing\"/> In 2008, the school district won first place for the small district category of that year's Digital School Districts Survey.<ref name=\"DSDS\"/>\n\n===Supreme Court loan===\nIn the 1970s, the school district made an indefinite loan of four sculptures to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. The works, plaster [[frieze]] [[relief]]s designed and sculpted by [[Adolph Weinman]] in the 1930s, were models for Weinman's final marble panels that were installed in the Supreme Courtroom in 1935. The models are six inches tall and two feet wide, compared with the 7-foot-tall final products.<ref name=\"Weinman1\">{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Colleen|title=Briarcliff schools, U.S. Supreme Court have rare bond|newspaper=The Journal News|publisher=Gannett Company|url=http://www.lohud.com/story/news/education/2017/09/18/rare-bond-between-briarcliff-school-district-and-u-s-supreme-court-spans-decades/639153001/|date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWeinman's son, [[Robert Weinman]], donated the models to the school district in the late 1950s; Weinman was a resident of Briarcliff, and his children attended school in the district.<ref name=\"Weinman2\">{{cite news|last=Barron|first=Sam|title=Supreme Court Displays Sculptures Loaned From Briarcliff Schools|newspaper=Briarcliff Daily Voice|url=http://briarcliff.dailyvoice.com/schools/supreme-court-displays-sculptures-loaned-from-briarcliff-schools/721768/|date=December 25, 2017|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref> The Supreme Court curator had contacted Robert Weinman seeking any models; Weinman directed him to the school district. The models were being kept in the basement of the former middle school, and were moved to the lobby of the [[United States Supreme Court Building|Supreme Court Building]] in 1974, where they have been on display since.<ref name=\"Weinman1\"/>\n\nThe court's curator sought out the district to donate the pieces around 2010, as part of a larger effort for donation or sale of works on loan to the Supreme Court. The school board had the pieces insured and voted to keep the models in the district's ownership, with a renewable annual lease to the court; as the work's tie to Briarcliff is valued in the district.

The district is an independent public entity, and is governed by the district Board of Education, whose members are elected in non-partisan elections for staggered, three-year terms. The board selects a [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]], who is the district's chief administrative official. The district's offices are located in Todd Elementary School.\n\nThe district has three schools: Todd Elementary School, Briarcliff Middle School and [[Briarcliff High School]]. It has about 1,535 students, and spends an average of $24,858 per pupil and has a [[student\u2013teacher ratio]] of 11:1 (the national averages are $12,435 and 15.3:1 respectively). The district is a part of the Putnam-Northern Westchester [[Board of Cooperative Educational Services]]. The Briarcliff Manor UFSD won first place for the small district category of the 2008 Digital School Districts Survey and currently provided 1 to 1 devices to all students in grades 4 through 12.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1865, a one-room schoolhouse was built on land donated by John Whitson on the south side of Pleasantville Road, between the [[Pocantico River]] and the [[New York & Putnam Railroad]] (now [[NY Route 9A]]/[[New York State Route 100|100]]).<ref>{{cite map|author=Frederick.

The building failed to meet requirements set by New York's commissioner of education, and thus in 1910, it became the Briarcliff Community Center, a social organization established by the village.{{refn|group=nb|The organization ceased to exist in 1927; the building burned down in 1928, shortly after scheduled demolition to make way for the Briarcliff-Peekskill Parkway.<ref name=\"Changing Landscape\"/>{{rp|page=75}}}} Around the same time, in 1908, $50,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|50000|1908}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) was voted for Briarcliff Manor to buy a plot by Law Memorial Park, and the school moved again, to the [[Spanish Renaissance architecture|Spanish Renaissance-style]] Grade School building, which was built there the following year.<ref name=\"1977history\"/>{{rp|page=50}} Students would attend that school from [[kindergarten]] to [[ninth grade]] and have the option to then attend the nearby [[Ossining High School]]. In 1918, the Briarcliff school began educating students through high school; in 1928, a dedicated wing for high school students was built onto the Grade School building. The enlarged school accepted students from Croton, Hawthorne, North White Plains, Valhalla, and as far as [[Granite Springs, New York|Granite Springs]].<ref name=\"Changing Landscape\"/>{{rp|page=68}}\n\nIn 1953, Todd Elementary School opened to free space at the Law Park grade school for middle- and high-school students.<ref name=\"Changing Landscape\"/>{{rp|page=153}} The present high school opened in 1971 to ease the large enrollment at the Grade School building.<ref name=\"Changing Landscape\"/>{{rp|page=154}} The district under its current name was officially established in 1974.<ref name=\"1977history\"/>{{rp|page=58}}\n\nIn 1980, [[Pace University]] began leasing the middle school building, and the middle school was moved to a portion of the new high school building.

The works, plaster [[frieze]] [[relief]]s designed and sculpted by [[Adolph Weinman]] in the 1930s, were models for Weinman's final marble panels that were installed in the Supreme Courtroom in 1935.

The school board had the pieces insured and voted to keep the models in the district's ownership, with a renewable annual lease to the court; as the work's tie to Briarcliff is valued in the district.

The station is built in an east-west direction with the two ends of the station connecting directly to Changi Airport Terminals 2 and 3. It is the eastern terminus of the branch and is currently the easternmost MRT station in Singapore, until the planned opening of\u00a0[[Aviation Park MRT station|Aviation Park station]]\u00a0in 2029.\n\nDuring the construction of [[Changi Airport Terminal 3|Terminal 3]] in 1994, proposals were made to build a new rail link connecting to and around the airport. The current two-station branch line was finalised in 1996 and construction began in 1999. The station opened on 8 February 2002, with passenger demand lower than expected. Nevertheless, it continues to provide an alternative transport option to the airport. On 25 May 2019, it was announced that the station will be incorporated as part of the [[Thomson\u2013East Coast MRT line|Thomson\u2013East Coast line]] (TEL), connecting to [[Infrastructure_of_Singapore_Changi_Airport#Terminal_5|Terminal 5]] by 2040.<ref name=\"LTMP 2040\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/new-mrt-stations-tel-extension-and-possible-new-rail-line-lta-2040-blueprint|title=New MRT stations, line extensions and a possible new rail line: LTA's 2040 blueprint|website=TODAYonline|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref><ref name=\"LTA Masterplan 2040\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=de83f659-4b0d-4609-840e-3deb3ac9b4b9|title=Land Transport Master Plan 2040: Bringing Singapore Together {{!}} Press Room {{!}} Land Transport Authority|website=www.lta.gov.sg|access-date=2019-05-26}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Changi MRT.JPG|left|thumb|Changi Airport MRT station, featuring flight information box in addition to train route information]]\n[[File:CG1 changi airport faregates.jpg|left|thumb|Changi Airport is one of the few stations where faregates are on the same level as the platforms.]]\nBefore the MRT line, Changi Airport had been operating with no [[Airport rail link|rail link]] and with full reliance on [[Taxicabs of Singapore|taxi]] and [[Bus transport in Singapore|bus connections]] since the airport began operations in 1981. This was effective given the short {{convert|20|km|miles}} distance to the city via the [[East Coast Parkway]] and affordability of taxis and buses. Public buses instead linked commuters to nearby MRT stations at [[Bedok MRT station|Bedok]], [[Tampines MRT station|Tampines]] and [[Pasir Ris MRT station|Pasir Ris]]. Therefore, there were previously unsuccessful attempts to propose an extension to Changi Airport.<ref>{{Cite news|title=MRT Link to Airport: Not in next 10 years|date=17 May 1991|work=The Straits Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=No MRT Line to Changi yet|date=20 March 1992|work=The Straits Times}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of extending the Mass Rapid Transit system to Changi Airport was reconsidered when Terminal 3 was being built.<ref>{{Cite news|title=MRT extension to airport reconsidered.|date=2 August 1994|work=The Straits Times}}</ref> The earlier plans had long been made for a new line branching off from the existing East West line at Tanah Merah,<ref>{{Cite news|title=Next Stop: Changi Airport?|date=2 August 1994|work=The New Paper}}</ref> with some conceptual plans showing a tentative route alignment up to the airport along Airport Boulevard, continuing beyond the airport to Changi Point, before turning southwest back towards the city along the east coast of the island.

The final plan involved building only the first two stations, namely [[Expo MRT station|Expo]], and the Changi Airport station, the underground station built between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3. The alignment of the station at the airport has been switched perpendicularly to an east\u2013west direction, such that the station leads to two of the terminals directly from either end of the station.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19961212-1.2.51.7 |title=MRT Line will not go beyond passenger terminals |website=The Straits Times |access-date=17 October 2019 |date=12 December 1996}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Search?ST=1&AT=advanced&K=changi+airport+mrt&KA=changi+airport+mrt&DF=02%2F01%2F1990&DT=01%2F09%2F2010&Display=0&NPT=&L=English&CTA=Article|title=Changi Airport MRT line details|date=12 December 1996|work=The Business Times|access-date=}}</ref> As part of the President's Challenge 2001, a part of a charity walk goes through the tunnel between Expo and Changi Airport stations.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Seng Kim|first=Lim|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Search?ST=1&AT=advanced&K=Changi%20Airport%20Station&KA=Changi%20Airport%20Station&DF=01%2F04%2F2001&DT=01%2F08%2F2003&Display=0&NPT=&L=&CTA=Article#|title=Chairty walk to talk place underground|date=12 August 2001|work=The Straits Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Search?ST=1&AT=advanced&K=Changi%20Airport%20Station&KA=Changi%20Airport%20Station&DF=01%2F04%2F2001&DT=01%2F08%2F2003&Display=0&NPT=&L=&CTA=Article#|title=Perfectly legal, and for a good cause!|date=9 September 2001|work=The New Paper|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Tan|first=Terence|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Search?ST=1&AT=advanced&K=Changi%20Airport%20Station&KA=Changi%20Airport%20Station&DF=01%2F04%2F2001&DT=01%2F08%2F2003&Display=0&NPT=&L=&CTA=Article#|title=Tunnel walk a hit|date=9 September 2001|work=The Straits Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nThe Contract 504 for the construction of Changi Airport MRT station and its associated tunnels was awarded to Kumagai-Sembawang Joint Venture in October 1998.

The station is built in an east-west direction with the two ends of the station connecting directly to Changi Airport Terminals 2 and 3. It is the eastern terminus of the branch and is currently the easternmost MRT station in Singapore, until the planned opening of\u00a0[[Aviation Park MRT station|Aviation Park station]]\u00a0in 2029.\n\nDuring the construction of [[Changi Airport Terminal 3|Terminal 3]] in 1994, proposals were made to build a new rail link connecting to and around the airport. The current two-station branch line was finalised in 1996 and construction began in 1999. The station opened on 8 February 2002, with passenger demand lower than expected. Nevertheless, it continues to provide an alternative transport option to the airport. On 25 May 2019, it was announced that the station will be incorporated as part of the [[Thomson\u2013East Coast MRT line|Thomson\u2013East Coast line]] (TEL), connecting to [[Infrastructure_of_Singapore_Changi_Airport#Terminal_5|Terminal 5]] by 2040.<ref name=\"LTMP 2040\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/new-mrt-stations-tel-extension-and-possible-new-rail-line-lta-2040-blueprint|title=New MRT stations, line extensions and a possible new rail line: LTA's 2040 blueprint|website=TODAYonline|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref><ref name=\"LTA Masterplan 2040\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=de83f659-4b0d-4609-840e-3deb3ac9b4b9|title=Land Transport Master Plan 2040: Bringing Singapore Together {{!}} Press Room {{!}} Land Transport Authority|website=www.lta.gov.sg|access-date=2019-05-26}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Changi MRT.JPG|left|thumb|Changi Airport MRT station, featuring flight information box in addition to train route information]]\n[[File:CG1 changi airport faregates.jpg|left|thumb|Changi Airport is one of the few stations where faregates are on the same level as the platforms.]]\nBefore the MRT line, Changi Airport had been operating with no [[Airport rail link|rail link]] and with full reliance on [[Taxicabs of Singapore|taxi]] and [[Bus transport in Singapore|bus connections]] since the airport began operations in 1981. This was effective given the short {{convert|20|km|miles}} distance to the city via the [[East Coast Parkway]] and affordability of taxis and buses. Public buses instead linked commuters to nearby MRT stations at [[Bedok MRT station|Bedok]], [[Tampines MRT station|Tampines]] and [[Pasir Ris MRT station|Pasir Ris]].

It is traditionally the final event of a track meet. At top class events, the first 500&nbsp;metres is run in lanes. Start lines are thus staggered over a greater distance than in an individual [[400 metres|400&nbsp;metres]] race; the runners then typically move to the inside of the track. The slightly longer '''4 \u00d7 440 yards relay''' was a formerly run British and American event, until [[metrication]] was completed in the 1970s.\n\n[[Relay race]] runners typically carry a relay baton which they must transfer between teammates. Runners have a 20&nbsp;m box (usually marked with blue lines) in which to transfer the baton. The first transfer is made within the staggered lane lines; for the second and third transfers, runners typically line up across the track despite the fact that runners are usually running in line on the inside of the track. This prevents confusion and collisions during transfer. Unlike the [[4 \u00d7 100 metres relay|4&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;100&nbsp;m]] relay, runners in the 4&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;400 typically look back and grasp the baton from the incoming runner, due to the fatigue of the incoming runner, and the wider margins allowed by the longer distance of the race. Consequently, disqualification is rare.\n\nAs runners have a running start, split times cannot be compared to individual 400 m performances. Internationally, the U.S. men's team has dominated the event, but have been challenged by [[Jamaica]] in the 1950s and Britain in the 1990s.  The current men's Olympic champions are from the [[United States]].\n\nAccording to the IAAF rules, world records in relays can only be set if all team members have the same nationality.\n\n[[Mixed 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay|Mixed-gendered 4 \u00d7 400 metres relays]] were introduced at the [[2017 IAAF World Relays]], with the IAAF first recognizing a world record in that event at the [[2019 World Athletics Championships]].\n\n==Records==\n{{see also|Men's 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay world record progression|Women's 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay world record progression}}\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!colspan=5|Men's Outdoor World Record<ref>{{cite web|title=4x400 Metres Relay Records \u2013 outdoor|url=http://www.iaaf.org/statistics/records/inout=o/discType=5/disc=4X4/detail.html|publisher=[[International Association of Athletics Federations]]|accessdate=1 September 2011}}</ref> \n|-\n!Country !!Members !!Venue !!Date !!Time\n|-\n|{{flagicon|USA}} United States ||[[Andrew Valmon]], [[Quincy Watts]], [[Butch Reynolds]], [[Michael Johnson (sprinter)|Michael Johnson]] ||[[Stuttgart]], Germany ||22 August 1993 ||2:54.29\n|}\n''Note:'' The IAAF rescinded a time of 2:54.20 set at Uniondale on 22 July 1998 by the United States ([[Jerome Young]], [[Antonio Pettigrew]], [[Tyree Washington]], [[Michael Johnson (athlete)|Michael Johnson]]) on 12 August 2008 after Pettigrew admitted to using human growth hormone and EPO between 1997 and 2003.<ref>{{cite news|title=IAAF deletes Americans\u2019 4x400m world record from the books|url=http://thestar.com.my/sports/story.asp?file=/2008/8/13/olympics/22071007&sec=Olympics|accessdate=1 September 2011|newspaper=The Star Online|date=13 August 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019125624/http://thestar.com.my/sports/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F8%2F13%2Folympics%2F22071007&sec=Olympics|archivedate=19 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!colspan=5|Men's Indoor World Record\n|-\n!Country !!Members !!Venue !!Date !!Time\n|-\n|{{flagicon|POL}} Poland || [[Karol Zalewski]], [[Rafa\u0142 Omelko]], [[\u0141ukasz Krawczuk]], [[Jakub Krzewina]] ||[[Birmingham]], [[United Kingdom]] ||4 March 2018 ||3:01.77\n|}\n\n''Note:'' A time of 3:00.77 by the [[University of California|USC]] team ([[Zach Shinnick]], [[Rai Benjamin]], [[Ricky Morgan Jr.]], [[Michael Norman (sprinter)|Michael Norman]]) at the 2018 NCAA Division I Championship was rejected as a record as Benjamin was a citizen of Antigua & Barbuda, and the others are US citizens.

four runners who each complete 400&nbsp;metres or one lap. It is traditionally the final event of a track meet. At top class events, the first 500&nbsp;metres is run in lanes. Start lines are thus staggered over a greater distance than in an individual [[400 metres|400&nbsp;metres]] race; the runners then typically move to the inside of the track. The slightly longer '''4 \u00d7 440 yards relay''' was a formerly run British and American event, until [[metrication]] was completed in the 1970s.\n\n[[Relay race]] runners typically carry a relay baton which they must transfer between teammates. Runners have a 20&nbsp;m box (usually marked with blue lines) in which to transfer the baton. The first transfer is made within the staggered lane lines; for the second and third transfers, runners typically line up across the track despite the fact that runners are usually running in line on the inside of the track. This prevents confusion and collisions during transfer. Unlike the [[4 \u00d7 100 metres relay|4&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;100&nbsp;m]] relay, runners in the 4&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;400 typically look back and grasp the baton from the incoming runner, due to the fatigue of the incoming runner, and the wider margins allowed by the longer distance of the race. Consequently, disqualification is rare.\n\nAs runners have a running start, split times cannot be compared to individual 400 m performances. Internationally, the U.S. men's team has dominated the event, but have been challenged by [[Jamaica]] in the 1950s and Britain in the 1990s.  The current men's Olympic champions are from the [[United States]].\n\nAccording to the IAAF rules, world records in relays can only be set if all team members have the same nationality.\n\n[[Mixed 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay|Mixed-gendered 4 \u00d7 400 metres relays]] were introduced at the [[2017 IAAF World Relays]], with the IAAF first recognizing a world record in that event at the [[2019 World Athletics Championships]].\n\n==Records==\n{{see also|Men's 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay world record progression|Women's 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay world record progression}}\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!colspan=5|Men's Outdoor World Record<ref>{{cite web|title=4x400 Metres Relay Records \u2013 outdoor|url=http://www.iaaf.org/statistics/records/inout=o/discType=5/disc=4X4/detail.html|publisher=[[International Association of Athletics Federations]]|accessdate=1 September 2011}}</ref> \n|-\n!Country !!Members !!Venue !!Date !!Time\n|-\n|{{flagicon|USA}} United States ||[[Andrew Valmon]], [[Quincy Watts]], [[Butch Reynolds]], [[Michael Johnson (sprinter)|Michael Johnson]] ||[[Stuttgart]], Germany ||22 August 1993 ||2:54.29\n|}\n''Note:'' The IAAF rescinded a time of 2:54.20 set at Uniondale on 22 July 1998 by the United States ([[Jerome Young]], [[Antonio Pettigrew]], [[Tyree Washington]], [[Michael Johnson (athlete)|Michael Johnson]]) on 12 August 2008 after Pettigrew admitted to using human growth hormone and EPO between 1997 and 2003.<ref>{{cite news|title=IAAF deletes Americans\u2019 4x400m world record from the books|url=http://thestar.com.my/sports/story.asp?file=/2008/8/13/olympics/22071007&sec=Olympics|accessdate=1 September 2011|newspaper=The Star Online|date=13 August 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019125624/http://thestar.com.my/sports/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F8%2F13%2Folympics%2F22071007&sec=Olympics|archivedate=19 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!colspan=5|Men's Indoor World Record\n|-\n!Country !!Members !!Venue !!Date !!Time\n|-\n|{{flagicon|POL}} Poland || [[Karol Zalewski]], [[Rafa\u0142 Omelko]], [[\u0141ukasz Krawczuk]], [[Jakub Krzewina]] ||[[Birmingham]], [[United Kingdom]] ||4 March 2018 ||3:01.77\n|}\n\n''Note:'' A time of 3:00.77 by the [[University of California|USC]] team ([[Zach Shinnick]], [[Rai Benjamin]], [[Ricky Morgan Jr.]], [[Michael Norman (sprinter)|Michael Norman]]) at the 2018 NCAA Division I Championship was rejected as a record as Benjamin was a citizen of Antigua & Barbuda, and the others are US citizens.

It is based on the [[Gregory Maguire]] novel ''[[Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West]]'' (published in 1995), itself a retelling of the classic 1900 novel, ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' by [[L. Frank Baum]] and the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939).\n\nThe musical is told from the perspective of the [[Witchcraft|witches]] of the [[Land of Oz]]; its plot begins before and continues after [[Dorothy Gale]] arrives in Oz from [[Kansas]], and includes several references to the 1939 film and Baum's novel. ''Wicked'' tells the story of two unlikely friends, [[Elphaba]] (the [[Wicked Witch of the West]]) and Galinda (whose name later changes to [[Glinda the Good Witch]]), who struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints, rivalry over the same love-interest, reactions to the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard]]'s corrupt government, and, ultimately, Elphaba's private fall from grace.\n\nProduced by Universal Stage Productions in coalition with [[Marc E. Platt|Marc Platt]], Jon B. Platt and [[David Stone (producer)|David Stone]], with direction by [[Joe Mantello]] and choreography by [[Wayne Cilento]], the original production of ''Wicked'' premiered on Broadway at the [[Gershwin Theatre]] in October 2003, after completing pre-Broadway tryouts at San Francisco's [[Curran Theatre]] in May/June of that same year. Its original stars included [[Idina Menzel]] as Elphaba, [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Glinda, and [[Joel Grey]] as the Wizard.<ref name=\"ibdb\">{{cite web |url= http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=13485 |title=Wicked |accessdate= November 8, 2007 |work= [[Internet Broadway Database]]}}</ref> The original Broadway production won three [[Tony Award]]s and seven [[Drama Desk Award]]s, while its original cast album received a [[Grammy Award]].\n\n''Wicked'' celebrated its sixteenth anniversary on Broadway on October 30, 2019. On October 28, 2019, with its 6,681st performance, it surpassed ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|''Les Mis\u00e9rables'']]'' to become Broadway's [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|fifth-longest running show]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadway.com/buzz/197390/wicked-surpasses-les-miserables-as-fifth-longest-running-show-in-broadway-history/|title=Wicked Surpasses Les Mis\u00e9rables as Fifth-Longest-Running Show in Broadway History|last=Lefkowitz|first=Andy|date=October 28, 2019|website=Broadway Buzz|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A typical performance takes approximately two hours and 30 minutes, plus a 15-minute intermission.<ref name=About>{{cite web |title=Wicked: The Show |url= http://www.wickedthemusical.com/the-show |accessdate= February 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the Broadway production has spawned several other productions worldwide, including various North American productions, a long-running [[Laurence Olivier Award]]\u2013nominated [[West End theatre|West End]] production, and a series of international productions.

Platt|Marc Platt]] to realize Schwartz's own intended adaptation. Persuaded, Platt signed on as joint producer of the project with Universal and David Stone.<ref name=rightstowicked/>\n\nThe novel, described as a political, social, and ethical commentary on the nature of good and evil, takes place in the [[Land of Oz]], in the years leading to [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]]'s arrival. The story centers on [[Elphaba]], the misunderstood, smart, and fiery girl of emerald-green skin who grows up to become the notorious [[Wicked Witch of the West]] and Galinda, the beautiful, blonde, popular girl who grows up to become [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]] the [[Good Witch of the South]]. The story is divided into five different sections based on the plot location and presents events, characters, and situations from Baum's ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' (1900) and its [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 film adaptation]] in new ways. It is designed to set the reader thinking about what it really is to be \"Wicked\", and whether good intentions with bad results are the same as bad intentions with bad results. Schwartz considered how best to condense the novel's dense and complicated plot into a sensible script.<ref name=briefhistory/> To this end, he collaborated with [[Emmy Award]]\u2013winning writer [[Winnie Holzman]] to develop the outline of the plot over the course of a year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-holzman.htm |title=Winnie Holzman \u2013 Wicked's book writer |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=MusicalSchwartz}}</ref> while meeting with producer Marc Platt to refine the structural outline of the show, spinning an original stage piece rather than creating a strict adaptation of Maguire's work.<ref name=briefhistory/>\n\nWhile the draft followed Maguire's idea of retelling the story of the 1939 film from the perspective of its main villain, the storyline of the stage adaptation \"goes far afield\" from the novel. As Holzman observed in an interview with ''[[Playbill]]'', \"It was [Maguire's] brilliant idea to take this hated figure and tell things from her point of view, and to have the two witches be roommates in college, but the way in which their friendship develops&nbsp;\u2013 and really the whole plot&nbsp;\u2013 is different onstage.\"<ref name=\"playbill 2\">{{Cite news |first=Michael |last=Buckley |title=STAGE TO SCREENS: A Chat with Wicked Nominee and TV Veteran Winnie Holzman |date=June 6, 2004 |url=http://www.playbill.com/features/article/86583.html |work=Playbill |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121164650/http://www.playbill.com/features/article/86583.html |archivedate=November 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Schwartz justified the deviation, saying \"Primarily we were interested in the relationship between Galinda&nbsp;\u2013 who becomes Glinda&nbsp;\u2013 and Elphaba...the friendship of these two women and how their characters lead them to completely different destinies.\"<ref name=\"script\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-script.htm |title=Wicked \u2013 Script |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=MusicalSchwartz.com }}</ref> In addition to this change in focus, other major plot modifications include Fiyero's appearance as the scarecrow, Elphaba's survival at the end, Nessarose using a wheelchair instead of being born without arms, Boq having a continuing love interest for Glinda - and eventually becoming the [[Tin Woodman]] instead of Nick Chopper, the complete cutting of Elphaba's years in the Vinkus, the deletion of Liir's birth, Fiyero not having a wife and children, Doctor Dillamond not being murdered, and Madame Morrible going to prison instead of dying.<ref name=\" novel\">{{Cite book | author=Maguire, Gregory | title=Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West | publisher=[[ReganBooks]] | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-06-039144-7 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/wickedlifetim00magu }}</ref>\n[[File:San Francisco Curran Theatre 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Curran Theatre]] in San Francisco, where ''Wicked'' made its debut]]\nThe [[Libretto|book]], lyrics, and score for the musical were developed through a series of readings.<ref name=briefhistory/> For these developmental workshops, [[Kristin Chenoweth]], the [[Tony Award]]\u2013winning actress whom Schwartz had in mind while composing the music for the character,<ref name=\"grimmerie\">{{Cite book | author=David Cote | title=Wicked: The Grimmerie: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Hit Broadway Musical |publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4013-0820-9 }}</ref> joined the project as Glinda. [[Stephanie J. Block]] played Elphaba in all of the workshops (she was the original Elphaba in the first national tour, and joined the Broadway cast later on) before fellow performer [[Idina Menzel]] was cast in the role in late 2000. Earlier that same year, the creators recruited New York producer Stone, who began the transition of the workshop production into a full Broadway production. [[Joe Mantello]] was brought in as director and [[Wayne Cilento]] as choreographer while Tony Award-winning designer [[Eugene Lee (designer)|Eugene Lee]] created the set and visual style for the production based on both [[William Wallace Denslow|W. W. Denslow]]'s original illustrations for Baum's novels and Maguire's concept of the story being told through a giant clock.<ref name=grimmerie/> Costume designer [[Susan Hilferty]] created a \"twisted [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]]\" style through more than 200 costumes, while lighting designer [[Kenneth Posner]] used more than 800 individual lights to give each of the 54 distinct scenes and locations \"its own mood\".<ref name=grimmerie/> By April 2003, a full cast had been assembled and the show readied its debut.<ref name=grimmerie/>\n\nFollowing the out-of-town tryout in San Francisco, which received mixed critical reception, the creative team made extensive changes before its transfer to Broadway.<ref name=grimmerie/> Speaking about the changes, Holzman said:\n<blockquote>Stephen [Schwartz] wisely had insisted on having three months to rewrite in between the time we closed in San Francisco and when we were to go back into rehearsals in New York. That was crucial; that was the thing that made the biggest difference in the life of the show.

[[Glinda the Good Witch]] talks about Elphaba's past where her mother is seen having an affair with another man, after Elphaba's father, the [[governor]] of [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], goes out of town. As her mother has this affair, her lover gives her a green [[potion]], and she drinks it. She becomes pregnant and gives birth to a baby girl with [[green]] skin (\"No One Mourns the Wicked\"). An Ozian asks Galinda if she and Elphaba were friends. She reluctantly admits that they were, leading Glinda to tell them the story of how they became best friends. A [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] starts with a scene at the [[college]], Shiz University, when Elphaba arrives with her father and younger sister, [[Nessarose]] (\"Dear Old Shiz\"). Due to her green skin, Elphaba's father resents her and showers his affection on Nessarose, who is [[Physical disability|physically disabled]] and uses a wheelchair, due to a birth defect that contributed to their mother's death in childbirth. As their father says goodbye, he gives Nessarose a pair of [[Silver Shoes|silver slippers]]. The headshiztress and [[Witchcraft|witch]], [[Madam Morrible]], decides to take Nessarose under her protection because Nessarose is disabled and her father's favorite, leaving Elphaba and the beautiful and popular Galinda as roommates, to their chagrin. Elphaba attempts to take back her sister, and her anger makes Nessarose come back into her hands, [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]]. Madame Morrible recognizes that Elphaba has special powers, and decides to teach her [[Magic (fantasy)|sorcery]]. She tells Elphaba her powers might allow her to one day work with the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wonderful Wizard of Oz]], something Elphaba has dreamed of her whole life (\"[[The Wizard and I]]\"). Both Glinda and Elphaba dislike each other (\"What Is This Feeling?\") and they fight constantly, even in their classes, such as their history class with [[List of Wicked characters|Dr. Dillamond]], a [[goat]], who as the only animal professor at the university is beginning to suffer from [[discrimination]]. He tells Elphaba a conspiracy is afoot to stop animals from speaking, and she wants to let the Wizard know, for he would surely stop it (\"Something Bad\").\n\nLater, the [[Winkie Country|Winkie]] Prince [[List of Wicked characters|Fiyero Tiggular]] arrives at Shiz and introduces the other students to his philosophy of simply \"Dancing through life\". Fiyero decides to have an orientation party at the Ozdust Ballroom, that evening, and everyone agrees to go. Boq, a Munchkin who has developed a crush on Galinda, tries to ask her to dance with him at the party, but she convinces him to ask Nessarose out, instead, in order to shoo him away, leaving Galinda free to go with Fiyero. Nessarose, who has a crush on Boq, is delighted and tells her sister how Galinda made it happen and how happy it has made her. Galinda gives a black witch's hat to Elphaba to wear at the party, as a [[Practical joke|prank]]. At the party that evening, Boq tries to tell Nessarose the real reason he invited her but is too nice to hurt her feelings (\"Dancing Through Life\"). She continues to fall for him. Madame Morrible arrives to tell Galinda she can join her sorcery class, at Elphaba's obliging request, and gives her a wand. Elphaba arrives wearing the witch's hat, only to find the other students laughing and staring while she awkwardly dances alone. Galinda feels regretful and starts dancing with Elphaba. Soon, everyone joins them, and the two girls look at each other in a new light. Back in their room, they continue to bond, by sharing secrets. Galinda tells Elphaba that she plans to marry Fiyero and Elphaba tells Glinda about the bottle of green potion, which she sleeps with behind her pillow. The bottle belonged to her mother, who had died giving birth to Nessarose. Their mother had chewed [[Cotoneaster lacteus|milk flowers]] in order for Nessarose to not be born with green skin. Elphaba tells Glinda that she blames herself for her mother's death and her father's resentment. Galinda then decides to give Elphaba a makeover (\"[[Popular (Wicked song)|Popular]]\").\n\nThe next day in class, Dr. Dillamond tells the students that he has been excommunicated. Elphaba wants to help, but no one will stand up with her. Afterward, a replacement teacher arrives and introduces the students to the [[cage]], which will keep animals controlled, so they never learn to speak. The cage being shown contains a small [[lion]] cub. Elphaba's fury cannot be contained, and she accidentally casts a spell on her fellow students, causing them to gyrate involuntarily. She and Fiyero steal the lion cub in the cage and escape. They share a tender moment before he leaves, embarrassed, to free the lion cub. Elphaba reminds herself how pointless it is to wish for something to happen between them, for he loves Galinda, as it starts to [[rain]] (\"I'm Not That Girl\"). Madame Morrible comes to tell her that the Wizard has decided to meet her. Nessarose and Galinda come to see her off, and Fiyero meets her too. Fiyero gives Elphaba a bouquet of [[Poppy|poppy flowers]] but ignores Galinda. Galinda tries to win Fiyero's respect by changing her name to \u2018Glinda\u2019, in solidarity with Dr. Dillamond, who always mispronounced her name, but Fiyero is not impressed, saying goodbye to Elphaba, instead. Elphaba invites Glinda to the [[Emerald City]] with her (\"One Short Day\").\n\nThe girls meet the Wizard of Oz, who turns out to be not quite as intimidating as they thought (\"A Sentimental Man\"). He promises Elphaba that he will grant her request if she proves herself. Madame Morrible appears; she is the Wizard's new \u2018press secretary\u2019. She gives Elphaba an ancient book of spells, called the ''[[Grimoire|Grimmerie]]'', which only the magically gifted can read. Elphaba is asked to try a [[levitation]] spell on the Wizard's monkey servant, [[Chistery|Chistery]]. However, the spell does not go the way Elphaba plans. [[Winged monkeys|Chistery sprouts wings]], and she realizes that the Wizard is the one behind the suppression of the animals. Elphaba realizes the Wizard has no powers and he is merely a fraud. She runs away, and to prevent the truth from getting out, Madam Morrible spreads reports that Elphaba is a \u2018wicked [[Witchcraft|witch]]\u2019. Elphaba then swears revenge on the Wizard for removing speech from the animals. She performs a spell on a [[broom]] and flies away from the Emerald City (\"[[Defying Gravity (song)|Defying Gravity]]\").\n\n===Act II===\nSometime later, Elphaba's opposition to the Wizard's regime has earned her the title \u2019[[Wicked Witch of the West]]\u2019. Glinda has become the positive public front of the Wizard's regime, given the title \u2018[[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda the Good]]\u2019 and positioned by The Wizard as the nation's defender against Elphaba (\"No One Mourns the Wicked\" (reprise)). A press conference to celebrate Fiyero's appointment as captain of the guard (a position he accepted to find Elphaba) is hijacked by the crowd's panicked rumors about Elphaba, including a story that she can be melted by water. Fiyero is incredulous and not convinced by Glinda's insistence that Elphaba does not want to be found. He is further angered when Madame Morrible announces his engagement to Glinda and runs off. Glinda attempts to keep a cheerful front for the press, but clearly realizes her dream life has come at a great price (\"Thank Goodness\").\n\nElphaba pays a visit to Nessarose, now governor of Munchkinland following the death of their father. Nessarose has [[Tyrant|taken away the rights of the Munchkins]] in a desperate attempt to keep Boq at her side. Elphaba tries to convince her sister to side with her against the Wizard, but Nessarose is more concerned with her own problems. Elphaba tries to help by giving Nessarose the power to walk, by turning the silver slippers into \u2018[[ruby slippers]]\u2019. Convinced that Boq must love her now, Nessarose calls for him, but he only sees this as proof that she does not need him anymore, and the opportunity to take his last chance to tell Glinda that he loves her, as she is now engaged to Fiyero. This news breaks Elphaba\u2019s heart, however she isn\u2019t surprised. Hurt, Nessarose takes Elphaba's spellbook and tries to cast a spell to make Boq fall in love with her. Nessarose mispronounces the words to the spell, and accidentally shrinks Boq's heart, earning the title \u201c[[Wicked Witch of the East]]\u201d (\"The [[Wicked Witch of the East]]\"). Elphaba works another spell to save his life, if in a different condition than he was before. She then tells Nessarose that she has to return to the palace in order to set the monkeys free, however, Nessarose knows that she is only going back to find Fiyero. When Boq awakens, he is disgusted at his new state as a [[Tin Woodman|man made of tin]] and flees the [[mansion]].\n\nElphaba returns to the Wizard's palace to free the monkey servants and encounters the Wizard. He tries once again to convince her to work with him, telling her that he is not evil, but just an average man who came into his position by chance, and he offers to redeem Elphaba's reputation (\"Wonderful\"). She is almost won over, until she sees Dr. Dillamond, under a blanket, who has lost the power of speech. Angered by this, Elphaba accuses the Wizard, but he calls the guards to arrest Elphaba. In response, Fiyero and the guards enter, followed by Glinda. However, Fiyero helps Elphaba escape and leaves with her. Although heartbroken at Fiyero switching sides with Elphaba (\"I'm Not That Girl\" (reprise)), Glinda suggests to the Wizard and Madame Morrible that the way to apprehend Elphaba is to use her sister, Nessarose, as bait, by spreading a rumor that she's in danger, allowing the officials to capture Elphaba once and for all. Madame Morrible agrees and conjures a [[tornado]].\n\nElphaba and Fiyero are both taken by surprise by the strength of their feelings for each other, and promise to always be together (\"As Long As You're Mine\"). Their happiness is interrupted when Elphaba has a vision of Nessarose being in danger and sees a house flying through the air in a [[tornado]]. Before Elphaba leaves to investigate, Fiyero tells her about a castle, Kiamo Ko, that his family owns and in which she can stay.\n\nGlinda and Elphaba meet in [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], the site where Nessarose has been crushed by a house with a girl named [[Dorothy Gale]] and a dog named [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]] inside. Upon arriving, Elphaba finds out that Glinda has given Dorothy Nessarose's ruby slippers and sent her on her way on the [[yellow brick road]]. Fueled by the rivalry over Fiyero, the two have a heated argument and fight. The guards arrive to arrest Elphaba. Fiyero arrives and holds Glinda hostage until Elphaba is allowed to go free. Glinda pleads for the guards not to harm him, but they do not listen, as they escort Fiyero to a nearby cornfield where they can interrogate and torture him (by [[crucifixion]]). Elphaba tries to cast a spell to protect him but is crestfallen by the limitations of her power. She decides that from this point on, she will live up to her reputation (\"[[No Good Deed (song)|No Good Deed]]\").\n\nLater, back at Oz's capital, all of its citizens unite, declaring war on Elphaba, due to the now full-grown [[Cowardly Lion|lion]], that Elphaba and Fiyero rescued, and Boq's testimony against her. Meanwhile, Glinda has realized Madam Morrible, who can control the weather, is responsible for Nessarose's death. Glinda flees in horror to warn Elphaba, as the angry mob sets out to take Kiamo Ko (\"March of the Witch Hunters\").\n\nBack at the castle, Elphaba has captured Dorothy and Toto, refusing to release them until Dorothy gives Elphaba Nessarose's ruby slippers \u2013 the only things left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's [[castle]] to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy and Toto go. Elphaba refuses until she receives a letter saying that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the ''Grimmerie'' to Glinda. The two friends embrace for the last time, before saying goodbye (\"For Good\"). As the mob arrives, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches helplessly from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, who appears to melt away and disappear in a cloud of green smoke. Shaken, Glinda sees that all that remains of her friend is her hat and the bottle of the green potion that her mother drank.\n\nIn the Emerald City, Glinda confronts the Wizard with Elphaba's bottle, which he recognizes as identical to his own. He was Elphaba's biological father, her mother's lover, and the cause of her green skin. He breaks down in sorrow, and Madame Morrible surmises that Elphaba's powers were so strong because she was a child of two worlds. Glinda banishes the Wizard from Oz and sends Madame Morrible to [[prison]].\n\nMeanwhile, back at Kiamo Ko, Fiyero (now a [[Scarecrow (Oz)|scarecrow]]) comes to the spot where Elphaba melted. Making sure that no one is watching, he knocks on the floor and out from a trap door steps Elphaba, very much alive; she had pretended to melt to convince her enemies of her death and to be with Fiyero, who was transformed into a scarecrow by her spell. Before leaving, Elphaba regrets that she will never see Glinda again and tell her that they are alive. Simultaneously, the musical returns to its starting point. Glinda finishes the story and promises the people of Oz that she will properly earn her title as Glinda the Good. As the people celebrate and Glinda quietly mourns, Elphaba and Fiyero leave Oz (\"Finale\").\n\n==Notable English-language casts==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:11; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:9%;\" | Character\n! style=\"width:9%;\" | San Francisco tryout <br> <small>2003</small><ref name=sanfran>Gans, Andrew.

Some of these motifs indicate irony&nbsp;\u2013 for example, when Glinda presents Elphaba with a \"ghastly\" hat in \"Dancing through Life\", the score reprises a theme from \"What is this Feeling?\" a few scenes earlier,<ref name=musicalthemes/> in which Elphaba and Glinda had espoused their mutual loathing.\n\nTwo musical themes in ''Wicked'' run throughout the score. Although Schwartz rarely reuses motifs or melodies from earlier works,<ref name=\"musicalthemes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-musical-themes.htm |title=Wicked \u2013 Musical Themes |accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=MusicalSchwartz.com }}</ref> the first&nbsp;\u2013 Elphaba's theme&nbsp;\u2013 came from ''[[The Survival of St. Joan]]'', on which he worked as [[musical director]].<ref name=musicalthemes/> \"I always liked this tune a lot and I never could figure out what to do with it,\" he remarked in an interview in 2004.<ref name=musicalthemes/> The chord progression that he first penned in 1971 became a major theme of the show's orchestration. By changing the instruments that carry the motif in each instance, Schwartz enables the same melody to convey different moods. In the overture, the tune is carried by the orchestra's [[brass section]], with heavy percussion. The result is, in Schwartz' own words, \"like a giant shadow terrorizing you\".<ref name=musicalthemes/> When played by the piano with some electric bass in \"As Long As You're Mine\", however, the same chord progression becomes the basis for a romantic duet. And with new lyrics and an altered [[bridge (music)|bridge]], the theme forms the core of the song \"No One Mourns the Wicked\" and its reprises.<ref name=musicalthemes/>\n\nSchwartz uses the \"Unlimited\" theme as the second major motif running through the score. Although not included as a titled song, the theme appears as an [[section (music)|interlude]] in several of the musical numbers. In a tribute to [[Harold Arlen]], who wrote the score for the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 film adaptation]], the \"Unlimited\" melody incorporates the first seven [[note (music)|notes]] of the song \"[[Over the Rainbow]].\" Schwartz included it as an inside joke as, \"according to [[copyright law]], when you get to the eighth note, then people can come and say, 'Oh you stole our tune.' And of course obviously it's also disguised in that it's completely different rhythmically. And it's also harmonized completely differently.... It's over a different chord and so on, but still it's the first seven notes of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'\".<ref name=musicalthemes/> Schwartz further obscured the motif's origin by setting it in a [[minor key]] in most instances. This also creates contrast in the songs in which it forms a part, for example in \"Defying Gravity\", which is written primarily in the key of [[D-flat major]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/scorch.asp?ppn=SC0009049 |title=Defying Gravity |accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=Musicnotes.com }}</ref> In the song \"The Wicked Witch of the East\", however, when Elphaba finally uses her powers to let her sister walk, the \"Unlimited\" theme is played in a [[major key]].<ref name=musicalthemes/>\n\n===Recordings===\n{{See also|Wicked (musical album)}}\nA [[cast recording]] of the original Broadway production was released on December 16, 2003, by [[Universal Music]]. All of the songs featured on stage are present on the recording with the exception of \"The Wizard and I (Reprise)\" and \"The Wicked Witch of the East\".

It is based on the [[Gregory Maguire]] novel ''[[Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West]]'' (published in 1995), itself a retelling of the classic 1900 novel, ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' by [[L. Frank Baum]] and the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939).\n\nThe musical is told from the perspective of the [[Witchcraft|witches]] of the [[Land of Oz]]; its plot begins before and continues after [[Dorothy Gale]] arrives in Oz from [[Kansas]], and includes several references to the 1939 film and Baum's novel. ''Wicked'' tells the story of two unlikely friends, [[Elphaba]] (the [[Wicked Witch of the West]]) and Galinda (whose name later changes to [[Glinda the Good Witch]]), who struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints, rivalry over the same love-interest, reactions to the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard]]'s corrupt government, and, ultimately, Elphaba's private fall from grace.\n\nProduced by Universal Stage Productions in coalition with [[Marc E. Platt|Marc Platt]], Jon B. Platt and [[David Stone (producer)|David Stone]], with direction by [[Joe Mantello]] and choreography by [[Wayne Cilento]], the original production of ''Wicked'' premiered on Broadway at the [[Gershwin Theatre]] in October 2003, after completing pre-Broadway tryouts at San Francisco's [[Curran Theatre]] in May/June of that same year. Its original stars included [[Idina Menzel]] as Elphaba, [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Glinda, and [[Joel Grey]] as the Wizard.<ref name=\"ibdb\">{{cite web |url= http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=13485 |title=Wicked |accessdate= November 8, 2007 |work= [[Internet Broadway Database]]}}</ref> The original Broadway production won three [[Tony Award]]s and seven [[Drama Desk Award]]s, while its original cast album received a [[Grammy Award]].\n\n''Wicked'' celebrated its sixteenth anniversary on Broadway on October 30, 2019.

Platt|Marc Platt]] to realize Schwartz's own intended adaptation. Persuaded, Platt signed on as joint producer of the project with Universal and David Stone.<ref name=rightstowicked/>\n\nThe novel, described as a political, social, and ethical commentary on the nature of good and evil, takes place in the [[Land of Oz]], in the years leading to [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]]'s arrival. The story centers on [[Elphaba]], the misunderstood, smart, and fiery girl of emerald-green skin who grows up to become the notorious [[Wicked Witch of the West]] and Galinda, the beautiful, blonde, popular girl who grows up to become [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]] the [[Good Witch of the South]]. The story is divided into five different sections based on the plot location and presents events, characters, and situations from Baum's ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' (1900) and its [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 film adaptation]] in new ways. It is designed to set the reader thinking about what it really is to be \"Wicked\", and whether good intentions with bad results are the same as bad intentions with bad results. Schwartz considered how best to condense the novel's dense and complicated plot into a sensible script.<ref name=briefhistory/> To this end, he collaborated with [[Emmy Award]]\u2013winning writer [[Winnie Holzman]] to develop the outline of the plot over the course of a year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-holzman.htm |title=Winnie Holzman \u2013 Wicked's book writer |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=MusicalSchwartz}}</ref> while meeting with producer Marc Platt to refine the structural outline of the show, spinning an original stage piece rather than creating a strict adaptation of Maguire's work.<ref name=briefhistory/>\n\nWhile the draft followed Maguire's idea of retelling the story of the 1939 film from the perspective of its main villain, the storyline of the stage adaptation \"goes far afield\" from the novel. As Holzman observed in an interview with ''[[Playbill]]'', \"It was [Maguire's] brilliant idea to take this hated figure and tell things from her point of view, and to have the two witches be roommates in college, but the way in which their friendship develops&nbsp;\u2013 and really the whole plot&nbsp;\u2013 is different onstage.\"<ref name=\"playbill 2\">{{Cite news |first=Michael |last=Buckley |title=STAGE TO SCREENS: A Chat with Wicked Nominee and TV Veteran Winnie Holzman |date=June 6, 2004 |url=http://www.playbill.com/features/article/86583.html |work=Playbill |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121164650/http://www.playbill.com/features/article/86583.html |archivedate=November 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Schwartz justified the deviation, saying \"Primarily we were interested in the relationship between Galinda&nbsp;\u2013 who becomes Glinda&nbsp;\u2013 and Elphaba...the friendship of these two women and how their characters lead them to completely different destinies.\"<ref name=\"script\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-script.htm |title=Wicked \u2013 Script |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=MusicalSchwartz.com }}</ref> In addition to this change in focus, other major plot modifications include Fiyero's appearance as the scarecrow, Elphaba's survival at the end, Nessarose using a wheelchair instead of being born without arms, Boq having a continuing love interest for Glinda - and eventually becoming the [[Tin Woodman]] instead of Nick Chopper, the complete cutting of Elphaba's years in the Vinkus, the deletion of Liir's birth, Fiyero not having a wife and children, Doctor Dillamond not being murdered, and Madame Morrible going to prison instead of dying.<ref name=\" novel\">{{Cite book | author=Maguire, Gregory | title=Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West | publisher=[[ReganBooks]] | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-06-039144-7 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/wickedlifetim00magu }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Libretto|book]], lyrics, and score for the musical were developed through a series of readings.<ref name=briefhistory/> For these developmental workshops, [[Kristin Chenoweth]], the [[Tony Award]]\u2013winning actress whom Schwartz had in mind while composing the music for the character,<ref name=\"grimmerie\">{{Cite book | author=David Cote | title=Wicked: The Grimmerie: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Hit Broadway Musical |publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4013-0820-9 }}</ref> joined the project as Glinda.

[[Glinda the Good Witch]] talks about Elphaba's past where her mother is seen having an affair with another man, after Elphaba's father, the [[governor]] of [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], goes out of town. As her mother has this affair, her lover gives her a green [[potion]], and she drinks it. She becomes pregnant and gives birth to a baby girl with [[green]] skin (\"No One Mourns the Wicked\"). An Ozian asks Galinda if she and Elphaba were friends. She reluctantly admits that they were, leading Glinda to tell them the story of how they became best friends. A [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] starts with a scene at the [[college]], Shiz University, when Elphaba arrives with her father and younger sister, [[Nessarose]] (\"Dear Old Shiz\"). Due to her green skin, Elphaba's father resents her and showers his affection on Nessarose, who is [[Physical disability|physically disabled]] and uses a wheelchair, due to a birth defect that contributed to their mother's death in childbirth. As their father says goodbye, he gives Nessarose a pair of [[Silver Shoes|silver slippers]]. The headshiztress and [[Witchcraft|witch]], [[Madam Morrible]], decides to take Nessarose under her protection because Nessarose is disabled and her father's favorite, leaving Elphaba and the beautiful and popular Galinda as roommates, to their chagrin. Elphaba attempts to take back her sister, and her anger makes Nessarose come back into her hands, [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]]. Madame Morrible recognizes that Elphaba has special powers, and decides to teach her [[Magic (fantasy)|sorcery]]. She tells Elphaba her powers might allow her to one day work with the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wonderful Wizard of Oz]], something Elphaba has dreamed of her whole life (\"[[The Wizard and I]]\"). Both Glinda and Elphaba dislike each other (\"What Is This Feeling?\") and they fight constantly, even in their classes, such as their history class with [[List of Wicked characters|Dr. Dillamond]], a [[goat]], who as the only animal professor at the university is beginning to suffer from [[discrimination]]. He tells Elphaba a conspiracy is afoot to stop animals from speaking, and she wants to let the Wizard know, for he would surely stop it (\"Something Bad\").\n\nLater, the [[Winkie Country|Winkie]] Prince [[List of Wicked characters|Fiyero Tiggular]] arrives at Shiz and introduces the other students to his philosophy of simply \"Dancing through life\". Fiyero decides to have an orientation party at the Ozdust Ballroom, that evening, and everyone agrees to go. Boq, a Munchkin who has developed a crush on Galinda, tries to ask her to dance with him at the party, but she convinces him to ask Nessarose out, instead, in order to shoo him away, leaving Galinda free to go with Fiyero. Nessarose, who has a crush on Boq, is delighted and tells her sister how Galinda made it happen and how happy it has made her. Galinda gives a black witch's hat to Elphaba to wear at the party, as a [[Practical joke|prank]]. At the party that evening, Boq tries to tell Nessarose the real reason he invited her but is too nice to hurt her feelings (\"Dancing Through Life\"). She continues to fall for him. Madame Morrible arrives to tell Galinda she can join her sorcery class, at Elphaba's obliging request, and gives her a wand. Elphaba arrives wearing the witch's hat, only to find the other students laughing and staring while she awkwardly dances alone. Galinda feels regretful and starts dancing with Elphaba. Soon, everyone joins them, and the two girls look at each other in a new light. Back in their room, they continue to bond, by sharing secrets. Galinda tells Elphaba that she plans to marry Fiyero and Elphaba tells Glinda about the bottle of green potion, which she sleeps with behind her pillow. The bottle belonged to her mother, who had died giving birth to Nessarose. Their mother had chewed [[Cotoneaster lacteus|milk flowers]] in order for Nessarose to not be born with green skin. Elphaba tells Glinda that she blames herself for her mother's death and her father's resentment. Galinda then decides to give Elphaba a makeover (\"[[Popular (Wicked song)|Popular]]\").\n\nThe next day in class, Dr. Dillamond tells the students that he has been excommunicated. Elphaba wants to help, but no one will stand up with her. Afterward, a replacement teacher arrives and introduces the students to the [[cage]], which will keep animals controlled, so they never learn to speak. The cage being shown contains a small [[lion]] cub. Elphaba's fury cannot be contained, and she accidentally casts a spell on her fellow students, causing them to gyrate involuntarily. She and Fiyero steal the lion cub in the cage and escape. They share a tender moment before he leaves, embarrassed, to free the lion cub. Elphaba reminds herself how pointless it is to wish for something to happen between them, for he loves Galinda, as it starts to [[rain]] (\"I'm Not That Girl\"). Madame Morrible comes to tell her that the Wizard has decided to meet her. Nessarose and Galinda come to see her off, and Fiyero meets her too. Fiyero gives Elphaba a bouquet of [[Poppy|poppy flowers]] but ignores Galinda. Galinda tries to win Fiyero's respect by changing her name to \u2018Glinda\u2019, in solidarity with Dr. Dillamond, who always mispronounced her name, but Fiyero is not impressed, saying goodbye to Elphaba, instead. Elphaba invites Glinda to the [[Emerald City]] with her (\"One Short Day\").\n\nThe girls meet the Wizard of Oz, who turns out to be not quite as intimidating as they thought (\"A Sentimental Man\"). He promises Elphaba that he will grant her request if she proves herself. Madame Morrible appears; she is the Wizard's new \u2018press secretary\u2019. She gives Elphaba an ancient book of spells, called the ''[[Grimoire|Grimmerie]]'', which only the magically gifted can read. Elphaba is asked to try a [[levitation]] spell on the Wizard's monkey servant, [[Chistery|Chistery]]. However, the spell does not go the way Elphaba plans. [[Winged monkeys|Chistery sprouts wings]], and she realizes that the Wizard is the one behind the suppression of the animals. Elphaba realizes the Wizard has no powers and he is merely a fraud. She runs away, and to prevent the truth from getting out, Madam Morrible spreads reports that Elphaba is a \u2018wicked [[Witchcraft|witch]]\u2019. Elphaba then swears revenge on the Wizard for removing speech from the animals. She performs a spell on a [[broom]] and flies away from the Emerald City (\"[[Defying Gravity (song)|Defying Gravity]]\").\n\n===Act II===\nSometime later, Elphaba's opposition to the Wizard's regime has earned her the title \u2019[[Wicked Witch of the West]]\u2019. Glinda has become the positive public front of the Wizard's regime, given the title \u2018[[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda the Good]]\u2019 and positioned by The Wizard as the nation's defender against Elphaba (\"No One Mourns the Wicked\" (reprise)). A press conference to celebrate Fiyero's appointment as captain of the guard (a position he accepted to find Elphaba) is hijacked by the crowd's panicked rumors about Elphaba, including a story that she can be melted by water. Fiyero is incredulous and not convinced by Glinda's insistence that Elphaba does not want to be found. He is further angered when Madame Morrible announces his engagement to Glinda and runs off. Glinda attempts to keep a cheerful front for the press, but clearly realizes her dream life has come at a great price (\"Thank Goodness\").\n\nElphaba pays a visit to Nessarose, now governor of Munchkinland following the death of their father. Nessarose has [[Tyrant|taken away the rights of the Munchkins]] in a desperate attempt to keep Boq at her side. Elphaba tries to convince her sister to side with her against the Wizard, but Nessarose is more concerned with her own problems. Elphaba tries to help by giving Nessarose the power to walk, by turning the silver slippers into \u2018[[ruby slippers]]\u2019. Convinced that Boq must love her now, Nessarose calls for him, but he only sees this as proof that she does not need him anymore, and the opportunity to take his last chance to tell Glinda that he loves her, as she is now engaged to Fiyero. This news breaks Elphaba\u2019s heart, however she isn\u2019t surprised. Hurt, Nessarose takes Elphaba's spellbook and tries to cast a spell to make Boq fall in love with her. Nessarose mispronounces the words to the spell, and accidentally shrinks Boq's heart, earning the title \u201c[[Wicked Witch of the East]]\u201d (\"The [[Wicked Witch of the East]]\"). Elphaba works another spell to save his life, if in a different condition than he was before. She then tells Nessarose that she has to return to the palace in order to set the monkeys free, however, Nessarose knows that she is only going back to find Fiyero. When Boq awakens, he is disgusted at his new state as a [[Tin Woodman|man made of tin]] and flees the [[mansion]].\n\nElphaba returns to the Wizard's palace to free the monkey servants and encounters the Wizard. He tries once again to convince her to work with him, telling her that he is not evil, but just an average man who came into his position by chance, and he offers to redeem Elphaba's reputation (\"Wonderful\"). She is almost won over, until she sees Dr. Dillamond, under a blanket, who has lost the power of speech. Angered by this, Elphaba accuses the Wizard, but he calls the guards to arrest Elphaba. In response, Fiyero and the guards enter, followed by Glinda. However, Fiyero helps Elphaba escape and leaves with her. Although heartbroken at Fiyero switching sides with Elphaba (\"I'm Not That Girl\" (reprise)), Glinda suggests to the Wizard and Madame Morrible that the way to apprehend Elphaba is to use her sister, Nessarose, as bait, by spreading a rumor that she's in danger, allowing the officials to capture Elphaba once and for all. Madame Morrible agrees and conjures a [[tornado]].\n\nElphaba and Fiyero are both taken by surprise by the strength of their feelings for each other, and promise to always be together (\"As Long As You're Mine\"). Their happiness is interrupted when Elphaba has a vision of Nessarose being in danger and sees a house flying through the air in a [[tornado]]. Before Elphaba leaves to investigate, Fiyero tells her about a castle, Kiamo Ko, that his family owns and in which she can stay.\n\nGlinda and Elphaba meet in [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], the site where Nessarose has been crushed by a house with a girl named [[Dorothy Gale]] and a dog named [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]] inside. Upon arriving, Elphaba finds out that Glinda has given Dorothy Nessarose's ruby slippers and sent her on her way on the [[yellow brick road]]. Fueled by the rivalry over Fiyero, the two have a heated argument and fight. The guards arrive to arrest Elphaba. Fiyero arrives and holds Glinda hostage until Elphaba is allowed to go free. Glinda pleads for the guards not to harm him, but they do not listen, as they escort Fiyero to a nearby cornfield where they can interrogate and torture him (by [[crucifixion]]). Elphaba tries to cast a spell to protect him but is crestfallen by the limitations of her power. She decides that from this point on, she will live up to her reputation (\"[[No Good Deed (song)|No Good Deed]]\").\n\nLater, back at Oz's capital, all of its citizens unite, declaring war on Elphaba, due to the now full-grown [[Cowardly Lion|lion]], that Elphaba and Fiyero rescued, and Boq's testimony against her. Meanwhile, Glinda has realized Madam Morrible, who can control the weather, is responsible for Nessarose's death. Glinda flees in horror to warn Elphaba, as the angry mob sets out to take Kiamo Ko (\"March of the Witch Hunters\").\n\nBack at the castle, Elphaba has captured Dorothy and Toto, refusing to release them until Dorothy gives Elphaba Nessarose's ruby slippers \u2013 the only things left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's [[castle]] to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy and Toto go. Elphaba refuses until she receives a letter saying that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the ''Grimmerie'' to Glinda. The two friends embrace for the last time, before saying goodbye (\"For Good\"). As the mob arrives, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches helplessly from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, who appears to melt away and disappear in a cloud of green smoke. Shaken, Glinda sees that all that remains of her friend is her hat and the bottle of the green potion that her mother drank.\n\nIn the Emerald City, Glinda confronts the Wizard with Elphaba's bottle, which he recognizes as identical to his own. He was Elphaba's biological father, her mother's lover, and the cause of her green skin. He breaks down in sorrow, and Madame Morrible surmises that Elphaba's powers were so strong because she was a child of two worlds. Glinda banishes the Wizard from Oz and sends Madame Morrible to [[prison]].\n\nMeanwhile, back at Kiamo Ko, Fiyero (now a [[Scarecrow (Oz)|scarecrow]]) comes to the spot where Elphaba melted. Making sure that no one is watching, he knocks on the floor and out from a trap door steps Elphaba, very much alive; she had pretended to melt to convince her enemies of her death and to be with Fiyero, who was transformed into a scarecrow by her spell. Before leaving, Elphaba regrets that she will never see Glinda again and tell her that they are alive. Simultaneously, the musical returns to its starting point. Glinda finishes the story and promises the people of Oz that she will properly earn her title as Glinda the Good. As the people celebrate and Glinda quietly mourns, Elphaba and Fiyero leave Oz (\"Finale\").\n\n==Notable English-language casts==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:11; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:9%;\" | Character\n! style=\"width:9%;\" | San Francisco tryout <br> <small>2003</small><ref name=sanfran>Gans, Andrew.

Some of these motifs indicate irony&nbsp;\u2013 for example, when Glinda presents Elphaba with a \"ghastly\" hat in \"Dancing through Life\", the score reprises a theme from \"What is this Feeling?\" a few scenes earlier,<ref name=musicalthemes/> in which Elphaba and Glinda had espoused their mutual loathing.\n\nTwo musical themes in ''Wicked'' run throughout the score. Although Schwartz rarely reuses motifs or melodies from earlier works,<ref name=\"musicalthemes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-musical-themes.htm |title=Wicked \u2013 Musical Themes |accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=MusicalSchwartz.com }}</ref> the first&nbsp;\u2013 Elphaba's theme&nbsp;\u2013 came from ''[[The Survival of St. Joan]]'', on which he worked as [[musical director]].<ref name=musicalthemes/> \"I always liked this tune a lot and I never could figure out what to do with it,\" he remarked in an interview in 2004.<ref name=musicalthemes/> The chord progression that he first penned in 1971 became a major theme of the show's orchestration. By changing the instruments that carry the motif in each instance, Schwartz enables the same melody to convey different moods. In the overture, the tune is carried by the orchestra's [[brass section]], with heavy percussion. The result is, in Schwartz' own words, \"like a giant shadow terrorizing you\".<ref name=musicalthemes/> When played by the piano with some electric bass in \"As Long As You're Mine\", however, the same chord progression becomes the basis for a romantic duet. And with new lyrics and an altered [[bridge (music)|bridge]], the theme forms the core of the song \"No One Mourns the Wicked\" and its reprises.<ref name=musicalthemes/>\n\nSchwartz uses the \"Unlimited\" theme as the second major motif running through the score. Although not included as a titled song, the theme appears as an [[section (music)|interlude]] in several of the musical numbers. In a tribute to [[Harold Arlen]], who wrote the score for the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 film adaptation]], the \"Unlimited\" melody incorporates the first seven [[note (music)|notes]] of the song \"[[Over the Rainbow]].\" Schwartz included it as an inside joke as, \"according to [[copyright law]], when you get to the eighth note, then people can come and say, 'Oh you stole our tune.' And of course obviously it's also disguised in that it's completely different rhythmically. And it's also harmonized completely differently.... It's over a different chord and so on, but still it's the first seven notes of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'\".<ref name=musicalthemes/> Schwartz further obscured the motif's origin by setting it in a [[minor key]] in most instances. This also creates contrast in the songs in which it forms a part, for example in \"Defying Gravity\", which is written primarily in the key of [[D-flat major]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/scorch.asp?ppn=SC0009049 |title=Defying Gravity |accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=Musicnotes.com }}</ref> In the song \"The Wicked Witch of the East\", however, when Elphaba finally uses her powers to let her sister walk, the \"Unlimited\" theme is played in a [[major key]].<ref name=musicalthemes/>\n\n===Recordings===\n{{See also|Wicked (musical album)}}\nA [[cast recording]] of the original Broadway production was released on December 16, 2003, by [[Universal Music]].

A. Wallis Budge]], NuVision Publications, page 57, 2007, {{ISBN|1-59547-914-7}}</ref>\n\n==Ascended Master Teachings==\nIn the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], a group of religions based on [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the Heavenly Mother is called [[Omega]].\n\n==Christianity==\n\n===Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism===\n{{main|Queen of Heaven|Theotokos}}\nOrthodox Christians believe Mary received her resurrection early near after{{huh|date=July 2019}}<!-- is this supposed to be \"soon after\"?--> her death (see [[Dormition of the Mother of God]]), while Roman Catholics generally believe that [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] was assumed, body and soul without death or the need for resurrection, into [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]], referred to as the [[Assumption of Mary]]. This could make her a \"heavenly mother\" of sorts, as [[Nativity of Jesus|she gave birth to Jesus]], and was confirmed to bear the title ''[[Theotokos]]'' (\"giver of birth to God\") at the  [[Council of Ephesus]] in AD 431. However, she is more often referred to as \"Our Mother\", since Christians alike refer to themselves as \"Brothers and Sisters in Christ\". There is a parallel in calling Mary \"Our Mother\" as calling God \"Our Father\", though there is a [[Pater Noster]] but no ''Mater Nostra''. Mary is not considered the \"Heavenly Mother\", the same way that God the Father is referred to as the \"Heavenly Father\". In Roman Catholic belief Mary, although highly [[Veneration of Mary|venerated]] as the first among the Saints, is never viewed on an equal status with God (cf. the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] Catholic hyperdulia vs. latria distinction), rather she is viewed by some{{who|date=December 2015}} Catholics, but not as a matter of dogma, as [[Mediatrix]] and [[Co-Redemptrix]] with Christ.\n\n===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints===\nIn the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], particularly [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], many adherents believe in a Heavenly Mother as the wife of God the Father. The [[theology]] varies, however, according to denomination. The only clear declaration regarding a Heavenly Mother figure is that she exists. Some offshoot denominations disavow a belief in her, some do not make her a part of the official doctrine, and others openly acknowledge her.<ref name=restoreLDS>{{cite web |title=The Role of Women in the Church |publisher=[[Restoration Church of Jesus Christ]] |url=http://home.netcom.com/~utahdude/rcjc/rcjc_wom.html |accessdate=2006-07-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617125455/http://home.netcom.com/~utahdude/rcjc/rcjc_wom.html |archivedate=2008-06-17 }}</ref>\n\n===Collyridianism===\n[[Collyridianism]] was a heretical Christian sect. Collyridians worshipped the Virgin Mary as their Heavenly Mother and as a Goddess. The [[Catholic Church]] condemned the Collyridians of Marian Heresies, holding that Mary was to be venerated but not adored like God.<ref>http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/COLLYRID.TXT</ref>\nThe Collyridian service was similar to that of the [[Catholic Mass]], except that the [[sacramental bread]] was not considered Christ, or a sacrifice to God, but a sacrifice to the Virgin Mary. [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] wrote about the Collyridianism and their multiple heresies against the Catholic Church in his work entitled ''[[Panarion]]''.\n\n===Unification Church===\nIn the [[Unification Church]] some members occasionally address God as \"Heavenly Mother\" when emphasizing the divine attribute of femininity, but not indicating a distinct person. Unificationists consider God a unified being of masculine and feminine characteristics, but they nearly always address God (in [[prayer]]) using masculine references and refer to Him as \"Father\" or \"Heavenly Father.\"\n\n===World Mission Society Church of God===\nThe [[World Mission Society Church of God]] is a Korean group founded by [[Ahn Sahng-hong]] (\uc548\uc0c1\ud64d, \u5b89\u5546\u6d2a). The church believes that, [[Ahn Sahng-hong]] is the second coming of Christ because of   prophecies in the Bible that were fulfilled.  [[Jang Gil-ja|Zahng Gil Jah]] is the spiritual  wife of God making her the heavenly new Jerusalem Mother.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Ryan|title=Introduction to the World Mission Society Church of God (WMSCOG)|url=http://carm.org/introduction-to-the-world-mission-society-church-of-god|website=http://carm.org/|publisher=Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry|accessdate=1 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Hinduism==\nIn the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] context, the worship of the Mother deity can be traced back to early [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] culture, and perhaps even before. The [[Rigveda]] calls the divine female power [[Mahimata]] (R.V. 1.164.33), literally Great Mother and also called Mother Earth. In places, the Vedic literature alludes to her as Viraj, the universal mother, as [[Aditi]], the mother of gods, and as Ambhrini, the one born of the Primeval Ocean. [[Durga]], the wife of Shiva, is a warrior goddess who represents the empowering and protective nature of [[motherhood]]. An incarnation of Durga is [[Kali]], who came from her forehead during war (as a means of defeating Durga's enemy, [[Mahishasura]]).

This could make her a \"heavenly mother\" of sorts, as [[Nativity of Jesus|she gave birth to Jesus]], and was confirmed to bear the title ''[[Theotokos]]'' (\"giver of birth to God\") at the  [[Council of Ephesus]] in AD 431. However, she is more often referred to as \"Our Mother\", since Christians alike refer to themselves as \"Brothers and Sisters in Christ\". There is a parallel in calling Mary \"Our Mother\" as calling God \"Our Father\", though there is a [[Pater Noster]] but no ''Mater Nostra''. Mary is not considered the \"Heavenly Mother\", the same way that God the Father is referred to as the \"Heavenly Father\". In Roman Catholic belief Mary, although highly [[Veneration of Mary|venerated]] as the first among the Saints, is never viewed on an equal status with God (cf. the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] Catholic hyperdulia vs. latria distinction), rather she is viewed by some{{who|date=December 2015}} Catholics, but not as a matter of dogma, as [[Mediatrix]] and [[Co-Redemptrix]] with Christ.\n\n===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints===\n{{main|Heavenly Mother (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints)}}\n\nIn the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], particularly [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], many adherents believe in a Heavenly Mother as the wife of God the Father. The [[theology]] varies, however, according to denomination. The only clear declaration regarding a Heavenly Mother figure is that she exists. Some offshoot denominations disavow a belief in her, some do not make her a part of the official doctrine, and others openly acknowledge her.<ref name=restoreLDS>{{cite web |title=The Role of Women in the Church |publisher=[[Restoration Church of Jesus Christ]] |url=http://home.netcom.com/~utahdude/rcjc/rcjc_wom.html |accessdate=2006-07-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617125455/http://home.netcom.com/~utahdude/rcjc/rcjc_wom.html |archivedate=2008-06-17 }}</ref>\n\n===Collyridianism===\n[[Collyridianism]] was a heretical Christian sect. Collyridians worshipped the Virgin Mary as their Heavenly Mother and as a Goddess. The [[Catholic Church]] condemned the Collyridians of Marian Heresies, holding that Mary was to be venerated but not adored like God.<ref>http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/COLLYRID.TXT</ref>\nThe Collyridian service was similar to that of the [[Catholic Mass]], except that the [[sacramental bread]] was not considered Christ, or a sacrifice to God, but a sacrifice to the Virgin Mary. [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] wrote about the Collyridianism and their multiple heresies against the Catholic Church in his work entitled ''[[Panarion]]''.\n\n===Unification Church===\nIn the [[Unification Church]] some members occasionally address God as \"Heavenly Mother\" when emphasizing the divine attribute of femininity, but not indicating a distinct person. Unificationists consider God a unified being of masculine and feminine characteristics, but they nearly always address God (in [[prayer]]) using masculine references and refer to Him as \"Father\" or \"Heavenly Father.\"\n\n===World Mission Society Church of God===\nThe [[World Mission Society Church of God]] is a Korean group founded by [[Ahn Sahng-hong]] (\uc548\uc0c1\ud64d, \u5b89\u5546\u6d2a). The church believes that, [[Ahn Sahng-hong]] is the second coming of Christ because of   prophecies in the Bible that were fulfilled.  [[Jang Gil-ja|Zahng Gil Jah]] is the spiritual  wife of God making her the heavenly new Jerusalem Mother.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Ryan|title=Introduction to the World Mission Society Church of God (WMSCOG)|url=http://carm.org/introduction-to-the-world-mission-society-church-of-god|website=http://carm.org/|publisher=Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry|accessdate=1 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Hinduism==\nIn the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] context, the worship of the Mother deity can be traced back to early [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] culture, and perhaps even before. The [[Rigveda]] calls the divine female power [[Mahimata]] (R.V. 1.164.33), literally Great Mother and also called Mother Earth. In places, the Vedic literature alludes to her as Viraj, the universal mother, as [[Aditi]], the mother of gods, and as Ambhrini, the one born of the Primeval Ocean. [[Durga]], the wife of Shiva, is a warrior goddess who represents the empowering and protective nature of [[motherhood]]. An incarnation of Durga is [[Kali]], who came from her forehead during war (as a means of defeating Durga's enemy, [[Mahishasura]]). Durga and her incarnations are particularly worshipped in [[Bengal]].\n\nToday, [[Devi]] is seen in manifold forms, all representing the creative force in the world, as ''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]'' and ''[[prak\u1e5bti]]'', the force that galvanizes the divine ground of existence into self-projection as the [[cosmos]]. She is not merely the [[Earth]], though even this perspective is covered by [[Parvati]] (Durga's previous incarnation).
