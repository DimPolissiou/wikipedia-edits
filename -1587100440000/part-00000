Garrett lies, saying that he has connections, and offers to act as a substitute instructor; secretly, he hopes to use the group as a launching pad for his political comeback. Drazen is arrested by [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]], and Garrett's scheme is exposed, causing the group to abandon him in disgust. Riddled with guilt, Garrett rounds them up and goes to see Diana, who agrees to help find Drazen.

Griselda then comes up with the idea of entrapping the fake attorney by pretending to need a visa for her mother, but Hakim spoils the plan. The thief, believing that his secret's safe, admits to stealing, which Hakim records with a hidden camera and uses to blackmail him into returning his money.

Jun Ho and Mei Lin are informed that their father's assets have been seized, leaving them bankrupt. Brady offers to teach them how to obtain free food and drinks, but Mei Lin confesses that she in fact has money stashed away and intends to teach Jun Ho a lesson about frivolous spending. A conversation with Celeste causes Garrett to realize how his unwillingness to be open with her ruined their relationship, and he intervenes to fix Griselda's marriage in time for the interview.

Upset, the parents leave and Mallory winds up serving an uncooked dinner to Garrett and the group. Griselda throws her shoes at the two and chastises them for casting blame. Garrett and Mallory realize they have to apologize and track their parents to an [[Olive Garden]], where Garrett learns his parents simply didn't want to make him miserable by harshly disciplining him and Mallory accepts that she is the one working herself too hard.

Drazen is arrested by [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]], and Garrett's scheme is exposed, causing the group to abandon him in disgust.

Jun Ho and Mei Lin are informed that their father's assets have been seized, leaving them bankrupt. Brady offers to teach them how to obtain free food and drinks, but Mei Lin confesses that she in fact has money stashed away and intends to teach Jun Ho a lesson about frivolous spending.

First he performed with [[Foo Fighters]] (\"[[Rope (song)|Rope]]\" Deadmau5 Remix) and then played \"Raise Your Weapon\". On the same day after the awards he revealed two new mau5heads.\n\n== Release ==\n''4\u00d74=12'' was released internationally on December 6, 2010 by [[Virgin Records]], and released in the [[United States]] through [[Ultra Records]] and Deadmau5's record label [[Mau5trap]]; on December 7, 2010. On 23 February 2011, Ultra Records released the Japanese version of the album, which was renamed simply to ''Deadmau5''. The [[self-titled]] release was bundled with his earlier singles \"[[Ghosts 'n' Stuff]]\" and \"[[I Remember (Deadmau5 and Kaskade song)|I Remember]]\".\n\nOn iTunes, the international mixed CD version of the album has the track names \"A City In Florida\" as \"City In Florida\", \"Cthulhu Sleeps\" as \"Cthulhu Steps\" and \"Raise Your Weapon\" as \"Raise Your Weapons\". This has not been confirmed as intentional or unintentional.\n\n== Singles ==\n\"[[Some Chords]]\" was released as the first official single from the album on May 3, 2010 exclusively on [[Beatport]], later released on [[iTunes]], on November 7, 2010. \"[[Animal Rights (instrumental)|Animal Rights]]\", a collaboration with American DJ [[Wolfgang Gartner]], was the second single from the album, released exclusively on Beatport on September 6, 2010 and followed by release on other digital download stores on September 17, 2010. The third single was \"[[Sofi Needs a Ladder]]\", released on October 31, 2010. It features vocals from [[Sofia Toufa|SOFI]] and is the highest charting single in the UK, reaching number 68. On November 14, the fourth single \"Right This Second\" was released peaking at number 79 on US charts and 100 on UK charts. Later the same month, the fifth single \"Bad Selection\" was released charting at 137 on the UK charts. The sixth and final single was \"[[Raise Your Weapon]]\", a song featuring vocals from  Greta Svabo Bech and was co-produced by Cydney Sheffield & [[Skrillex]], released on May 23, 2011. It became his first song to chart on the US Billboard Hot 100 as well as reaching 117 on the UK charts.\n\n== Critical reception ==\n{{Album ratings\n|MC=66/100 <ref name=\"MC\">{{Metacritic album|4-x-4-12|accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref>\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |first=David|last=Jeffries|title=Deadmau5: 4x4=12 Review|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/4x412-mw0002066896|accessdate=9 December 2010}}</ref>\n| rev2 = AltSounds\n| rev2Score = 7.9/10<ref name=\"AltSounds\">{{cite web|first=Daniel|last=Morrow|title=Deadmau6, '4x4=12' (Mau5trap/Virgin)|url=http://hangout.altsounds.com/reviews/124310-deadmau5-4x4-12-album.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216060128/http://hangout.altsounds.com/reviews/124310-deadmau5-4x4-12-album.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 December 2010|accessdate=13 December 2010}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev3Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\">{{cite web |first=Will|last=Hermes|title=Deadmau6, '4x4=12' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/4x4-12-20101206|accessdate=6 November 2011|work=Rolling Stone1}}</ref>\n| rev4 = [[Slant Magazine]]\n| rev4Score = {{Rating|2.5|5}}<ref name=\"Slant\">{{cite web |first=Liedel|last=Kevin|title=Deadmau5: 4x4=12 \u2013 Music Review|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/deadmau5-4x312/2336|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|accessdate=4 December 2010}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n| rev5Score = {{Rating|5|10}}<ref name=\"SPIN\">{{cite web |first=Philip|last=Sherburne|title=Deadmau5, '4x4=12' (Ultra)|url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/deadmau5-4x312-ultra|work=[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]]|accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n| rev6 = thinkofmusic\n| rev6Score = {{Rating|7|10}}<ref name=\"thinkofmusic\">{{cite web |first=Nathan|last=Lloyd|title=Deadmau5: '4X4=12' review|url=http://www.thinkofmusic.com/album/DM4X4#thinkofmusic|website=[[thinkofmusic.com]]|accessdate=7 January 2011}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe album was generally well received among music critics. [[Metacritic]] assigned it an average score of 66 out of 100, based on 13 reviews.<ref name=\"MC\"/> Will Hermes of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' touted the album writing, \"4\u00d74=12 is audacious, mixing generic house grooves with electric fare.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Will Hermes |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/4x4-12-20101206 |title=4x4=12 by Deadmau5 &#124; Rolling Stone Music &#124; Music Reviews |work=Rolling Stone |date=7 December 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref> Many reviewers praised the album for its universal appeal to a diverse audience. Annie Zaleski of ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' wrote, \"The collection is mostly instrumental tracks, ranging in style from insistent progressive house to watery techno\u2026Without vocals to provide structure, 4\u00d74=12's variety stems from Deadmau5's sense of dynamics and pacing, as well as his diverse sonic influences\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Annie |last=Zaleski |url=http://www.altpress.com/reviews/entry/deadmau5_-_4x412/ |title=Alternative Press &#124; Reviews &#124; deadmau5 \u2013 4x4=12 |website=Altpress.com |date=7 December 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref> However, some critics were less enthusiastic. Allison Stewart of ''The Washington Post'' stated, \"\"4\u00d74\" is a breakthrough album that doesn't feel like a breakthrough album. Not accessible or crowd-pleasing enough to court non-electronic music fans, not adventurous enough to satisfy die-hards, it pleases, but it rarely dazzles.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Stewart |first=Allison |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/06/AR2010120606076.html |title=Click Track \u2013 Album review: Deadmau5, \"4x4=12\" |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=6 December 2010 |accessdate=6 December 2016}}</ref> Dave Simpson of ''The Guardian'' shared in Ms. Stewart's sentiments by noting, \"Undoubtedly, the Deadmau5 appeal hinges on the astonishing live show in which Zimmerman performs in a giant, illuminated mouse's head, but it wouldn't work without his tracks. His third production compilation again shows that he is a master at doing simple electro house music very well: humongous beats and basslines blend with straightforward chord progressions and, when interest may start to lag, sonic diversions.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Dave Simpson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/dec/02/deadmau5-4x4-review |title=Deadmau5: 4x4=12 \u2013 review &#124; Music |work=The Guardian |accessdate=6 August 2011 |location=London |date=2 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n''4\u00d74=12'' proved to become a breakthrough commercial success for Deadmau5 when it became his first studio album to chart on the ''Billboard'' Top 200. It eventually peaked within the top fifty of the ''Billboard'' Top 200 and has spent over 100 weeks on the chart. It also narrowly missed the top spot of the ''Billboard'' Electronic albums, reaching number two. Internationally, the album was received warmly as well. It managed to chart within the top forty of various European nations, replicating and in many cases eclipsing the chart success of his previous efforts. In the United Kingdom, however, the album achieved a lower peak compared to his previous albums which all entered the top twenty, missing the top forty altogether.\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track

First he performed with [[Foo Fighters]] (\"[[Rope (song)|Rope]]\" Deadmau5 Remix) and then played \"Raise Your Weapon\". On the same day after the awards he revealed two new mau5heads.\n\n== Release ==\n''4\u00d74=12'' was released internationally on December 6, 2010 by [[Virgin Records]], and released in the [[United States]] through [[Ultra Records]] and Deadmau5's record label [[Mau5trap]]; on December 7, 2010. On 23 February 2011, Ultra Records released the Japanese version of the album, which was renamed simply to ''Deadmau5''. The [[self-titled]] release was bundled with his earlier singles \"[[Ghosts 'n' Stuff]]\" and \"[[I Remember (Deadmau5 and Kaskade song)|I Remember]]\".\n\nOn iTunes, the international mixed CD version of the album has the track names \"A City In Florida\" as \"City In Florida\", \"Cthulhu Sleeps\" as \"Cthulhu Steps\" and \"Raise Your Weapon\" as \"Raise Your Weapons\". This has not been confirmed as intentional or unintentional.\n\n== Singles ==\n\"[[Some Chords]]\" was released as the first official single from the album on May 3, 2010 exclusively on [[Beatport]], later released on [[iTunes]], on November 7, 2010. \"[[Animal Rights (instrumental)|Animal Rights]]\", a collaboration with American DJ [[Wolfgang Gartner]], was the second single from the album, released exclusively on Beatport on September 6, 2010 and followed by release on other digital download stores on September 17, 2010. The third single was \"[[Sofi Needs a Ladder]]\", released on October 31, 2010. It features vocals from [[Sofia Toufa|SOFI]] and is the highest charting single in the UK, reaching number 68. On November 14, the fourth single \"Right This Second\" was released peaking at number 79 on US charts and 100 on UK charts. Later the same month, the fifth single \"Bad Selection\" was released charting at 137 on the UK charts. The sixth and final single was \"[[Raise Your Weapon]]\", a song featuring vocals from  Greta Svabo Bech and was co-produced by Cydney Sheffield & [[Skrillex]], released on May 23, 2011.

[[Metacritic]] assigned it an average score of 66 out of 100, based on 13 reviews.<ref name=\"MC\"/> Will Hermes of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' touted the album writing, \"4\u00d74=12 is audacious, mixing generic house grooves with electric fare.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Will Hermes |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/4x4-12-20101206 |title=4x4=12 by Deadmau5 &#124; Rolling Stone Music &#124; Music Reviews |work=Rolling Stone |date=7 December 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref> Many reviewers praised the album for its universal appeal to a diverse audience. Annie Zaleski of ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' wrote, \"The collection is mostly instrumental tracks, ranging in style from insistent progressive house to watery techno\u2026Without vocals to provide structure, 4\u00d74=12's variety stems from Deadmau5's sense of dynamics and pacing, as well as his diverse sonic influences\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Annie |last=Zaleski |url=http://www.altpress.com/reviews/entry/deadmau5_-_4x412/ |title=Alternative Press &#124; Reviews &#124; deadmau5 \u2013 4x4=12 |website=Altpress.com |date=7 December 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref> However, some critics were less enthusiastic. Allison Stewart of ''The Washington Post'' stated, \"\"4\u00d74\" is a breakthrough album that doesn't feel like a breakthrough album. Not accessible or crowd-pleasing enough to court non-electronic music fans, not adventurous enough to satisfy die-hards, it pleases, but it rarely dazzles.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Stewart |first=Allison |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/06/AR2010120606076.html |title=Click Track \u2013 Album review: Deadmau5, \"4x4=12\" |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=6 December 2010 |accessdate=6 December 2016}}</ref> Dave Simpson of ''The Guardian'' shared in Ms. Stewart's sentiments by noting, \"Undoubtedly, the Deadmau5 appeal hinges on the astonishing live show in which Zimmerman performs in a giant, illuminated mouse's head, but it wouldn't work without his tracks. His third production compilation again shows that he is a master at doing simple electro house music very well: humongous beats and basslines blend with straightforward chord progressions and, when interest may start to lag, sonic diversions.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Dave Simpson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/dec/02/deadmau5-4x4-review |title=Deadmau5: 4x4=12 \u2013 review &#124; Music |work=The Guardian |accessdate=6 August 2011 |location=London |date=2 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n''4\u00d74=12'' proved to become a breakthrough commercial success for Deadmau5 when it became his first studio album to chart on the ''Billboard'' Top 200. It eventually peaked within the top fifty of the ''Billboard'' Top 200 and has spent over 100 weeks on the chart. It also narrowly missed the top spot of the ''Billboard'' Electronic albums, reaching number two. Internationally, the album was received warmly as well. It managed to chart within the top forty of various European nations, replicating and in many cases eclipsing the chart success of his previous efforts. In the United Kingdom, however, the album achieved a lower peak compared to his previous albums which all entered the top twenty, missing the top forty altogether.\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track

The album is considered to be more experimental than deadmau5's previous albums (such as ''[[4\u00d74=12]]''), and he stated in an interview with [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]] that he had been considering producing music similar to his debut album ''[[Get Scraped]]'' again.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH_5Ug2iOLU|title=Why Deadmau5 Hates Dubstep|date=October 5, 2012|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=July 18, 2013}}</ref> It is the last studio album by deadmau5 to be released by Ultra Records, as well as his only album to be released by Parlophone.\n\n''Album Title Goes Here'' spawned five [[single (music)|singles]]: \"[[Maths (instrumental)|Maths]]\", \"[[The Veldt (song)|The Veldt]]\", \"[[Professional Griefers]]\", \"[[Channel 42 (instrumental)|Channel 42]]\" and \"[[Telemiscommunications]]\". The album received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronica Album|Best Dance/Electronica Album]] at the [[55th Grammy Awards]].\n\n== Background ==\nIn a [[Streaming media|livestream]] on [[Ustream]], deadmau5 said that the track \"Sleepless\" was supposed to contain the vocals he had recorded, but he claimed to have accidentally submitted the wrong file without the vocals. This led to the instrumental version of the song to appear on the final version of the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/25870796 |title=oh you. deadmau5. you're so random. |date=October 3, 2012 |publisher=[[Ustream]] |author=deadmau5 |accessdate=October 3, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006024511/http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/25870796 |archivedate=6 October 2012 }} About 12 minutes in.</ref>\n\n== Promotion ==\nA [[music video]] directed by Paul Boyd was released for \"Professional Griefers\", which featured both deadmau5 and Gerard Way, and was promoted by [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC).

The album is considered to be more experimental than deadmau5's previous albums (such as ''[[4\u00d74=12]]''), and he stated in an interview with [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]] that he had been considering producing music similar to his debut album ''[[Get Scraped]]'' again.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH_5Ug2iOLU|title=Why Deadmau5 Hates Dubstep|date=October 5, 2012|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=July 18, 2013}}</ref> It is the last studio album by deadmau5 to be released by Ultra Records, as well as his only album to be released by Parlophone.\n\n''Album Title Goes Here'' spawned five [[single (music)|singles]]: \"[[Maths (instrumental)|Maths]]\", \"[[The Veldt (song)|The Veldt]]\", \"[[Professional Griefers]]\", \"[[Channel 42 (instrumental)|Channel 42]]\" and \"[[Telemiscommunications]]\". The album received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronica Album|Best Dance/Electronica Album]] at the [[55th Grammy Awards]].\n\n== Background ==\nIn a [[Streaming media|livestream]] on [[Ustream]], deadmau5 said that the track \"Sleepless\" was supposed to contain the vocals he had recorded, but he claimed to have accidentally submitted the wrong file without the vocals.

Many of the songs on the album were originally uploaded to Deadmau5's [[SoundCloud]] account before they were removed from the site in early 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tregoning|first=Jack|title=Deadmau5 deletes his SoundCloud after 33 million plays|url=http://www.inthemix.com.au/news/57236/Deadmau5_deletes_his_SoundCloud_after_33_million_plays|work=inthemix|date=January 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe album received a positive reception from critics, who applauded its experimental nature, although some viewed this as its weak point. It peaked at number 9 on the Billboard 200, becoming his second top-ten album.\n\n==Background==\nOn January 7, 2014, Deadmau5 announced on [[Twitter]] that his seventh album was completed.

Prince Solms named the settlement in honor of his home of [[Solms-Braunfels]], [[Germany]].\n\nThe Adelsverein organized hundreds of people in Germany to settle in Texas. Immigrants from Germany began arriving at [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] in July 1844. Most then traveled by ship to [[Indianola, Texas|Indianola]] in December 1844, and began the overland journey to the Fisher-Miller land grant purchased by Prince Solms.<ref>King (1967) p.53</ref> At the urging of [[John Coffee Hays]], who realized the settlers would not have time to build homes and plant crops further inland before winter, and as the German settlers were traveling inland along the Guadalupe River, they stopped near the [[Comal Springs]]. Prince Solms bought two leagues of land from Rafael Garza and Maria Antonio Veramendi Garza for $1,111.00.<ref>King (1967) p.37</ref>\n\nThe land was located northeast of [[San Antonio]] on [[El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail|El Camino Real de los Tejas]] and had the strong freshwater Comal Springs, known as ''Las Fontanas'', when the Germans arrived.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comal Springs|url=http://www.edwardsaquifer.net/comal.html|publisher=Edwards Aquifer|accessdate=27 December 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Comal Springs\">{{cite web|last=Brune|first=Gunnar|title=Comal Springs|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/rpc02|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=27 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Brune|first=Gunnar|title=Springs of Texas: Volume I |year=2002|publisher=TAMU Press|isbn=978-1-58544-196-9|author2=Besse, Helen C |page=129}}</ref> It was about halfway between Indianola and the lower portions of the Fisher-Miller land grant. The first settlers forded the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] on [[Good Friday]], March 21, 1845, near the present-day Faust Street bridge.<ref>{{cite web| title=Faust Street Bridge| url=http://www.texasescapes.com/TexasHillCountryTowns/NewBraunfelsTexas/NewBraunfelsTx.htm#bridge| work=Texas Escapes| publisher=Texas Escapes \u2013 Blueprints For Travel, LLC| accessdate=27 December 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"New Braunfels, Texas\">{{cite web| last=Greene| first=Daniel P.| title=New Braunfels, Texas| url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hen02| work=Handbook of Texas Online| publisher=Texas State Historical Association| accessdate=27 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nAs the spring of 1845 progressed, the settlers built the \"Zinkenburg\", a fort named for Adelsverein civil engineer [[Nicolaus Zink]], divided the land, and began building homes and planting crops.<ref>{{cite web| last=Ragsdale| first=Crystal Sasse| title=Zinkenburg| url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/uez01|work=Handbook of Texas Online| publisher=Texas State Historical Association| accessdate=27 December 2010}}</ref> Prince Solms would also lay the cornerstone for the Sophienburg, a permanent fort and center for the immigrant association.<ref>{{cite web| last=Blackman| first=Clyde T.| title=Sophienburg Museum and Archives| url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/lbs02| work=Handbook of Texas Online| publisher=Texas State Historical Association| accessdate=27 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1844, Prince Solms was so disillusioned with the logistics of the colonization that he asked the Vereins to remove him as commissioner-general and appoint a successor.<ref>King (1967) pp.35\u201338</ref> When [[John O. Meusebach]] arrived, the finances were in disarray, due in part to Prince Solms' lack of business experience and his refusal to keep financial records. To a larger degree, the financial situation happened because the Adelsverein was an organization of noblemen with no practical backgrounds at running businesses. They were on the other side of the world and did not witness the situation with which both Prince Solms and Meusebach were dealing. [[Henry Francis Fisher]] had not supplied transport and supplies for which the Verein advanced money to him. Meusebach found Prince Solms in Galveston trying to return to Germany, detained by authorities for unpaid bills. Meusebach made good on the debts, so Prince Solms could depart.<ref>King (1967) pp.52\u201358</ref>\n\nMeusebach discovered that Prince Solms' choice of the inadequate Carlshafen (Indianola) as a port of entry, as well as the isolated route to New Braunfels, was deliberately chosen to keep the Germans from interacting with any Americans.  According to Nicolaus Zink,<ref>{{cite web| last=Ragsdale| first=Crystal Sasse| title=Nicolaus Zink| url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fzi01| work=Handbook of Texas Online| publisher=Texas State Historical Association| accessdate=3 January 2011}}</ref> Prince Solms had planned to establish a German feudal state by secretly bringing in immigrants and placing them in military fortresses. Meusebach, who had renounced his own title of nobility, took a different approach and invited Americans to settle in the Vereins territory.<ref>King (1967) pp.59\u201360</ref>\n\n[[Image:Old map-New Braunfels-1881.jpg|left|thumb|Old map (1881)]]\nPrince Solms, being an officer of the Imperial Army of [[Austria]], had kept a uniformed military unit at the ready in Indianola.  Meusebach converted the military unit to a more needed work detail.<ref>King (1967) p.63</ref> A finance and business structure for the colony was put in place by Meusebach.<ref>King (1967) p.64</ref> He also provided for adequate food and shelter for the colonists.<ref>King (1967) p.65</ref> On August 11, 1845, Hermann Friedrich Seele<ref>{{cite web| last=Breitenkamp| first=Edward C.| title=Hermann Friedrich Seele| url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fse06| work=Handbook of Texas Online| publisher=Texas State Historical Association| accessdate=27 December 2010}}</ref> became the first teacher for the German-English school in New Braunfels.<ref>King (1967) p.66</ref> Meusebach established friendly relations with a local tribe of [[Waco tribe|Waco Indians]]. Upon seeing his reddish-blonde hair, they called him ''Ma-be-quo-si-to-mu'', \"Chief with the burning hair of the head\".<ref>King (1967) p.67</ref>\n\nIn May 1846, Meusebach received a letter from Count Castell informing him 4,304 emigrants were on their way to Texas. With no funds and no new settlements, the mass of emigrants was stalled at Carlshafen. Meusebach's requests to the Verein for more money, and his warnings of pending bankruptcy for the Verein, brought no results. As a last resort, Meusebach instructed D.H. Klaener to publish the plight in the German news media. Embarrassed by the publicity, the Verein established a $60,000 letter of credit.<ref>King (1967) pp.75\u201383</ref> The amount was not adequate for sustaining the total number of German emigrants in Texas, but Castell also sent Philip Cappes as special commissioner to observe the situation. Cappes had also been instructed by Castell to observe Meusebach and to secretly report back every detail.<ref>Morgenthaler (2007) p.56</ref> By the time Cappes departed in March 1847, he recommended another $200,000 be advanced.<ref>King (1967) pp.96\u2013101</ref> [[File:Zeitung 1853.jpg|thumb|Front page of the ''Neu-Braunfelser Zeitung'' on September 16, 1853|alt=|left]]\n\nCappes invited Henry Francis Fisher to New Braunfels, in spite of Fisher not being entirely trustworthy to the Verein. As of February 11, 1845, Fisher had been involved in coercing newly arrived immigrants to sign documents stating their intent to depart from the Verein and align with Fisher's friend Dr. Friedrich Schubbert, also known as Friedrich Strubberg.\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>Cappes was not in town when Meusebach was breakfast host to Fisher on December 31, 1846. Posters had mysteriously appeared about town maligning Meusebach, saying \"Curses upon Meusebach the slave driver\", and inciting colonists to free themselves from his \"tyranny\". A group led by Rudolph Iwonski<ref>Johnson (2009) p.10</ref> pushed their way into Meusebach's home, and colonist C. Herber brandished a whip. Herber was an alleged counterfeiter to whom Count Castell had awarded asylum. Meusebach and Herber shared a dislike of one another.<ref>King (1967) p.98</ref>\n\nThe colonists' list of demands included Meusebach resigning as commissioner-general and turning the colonization over to Fisher.<ref>Morgenthaler (2007) p.61</ref> Meusebach kept his composure, but the group became so heated, they yelled, \"Hang him!\" When the estimated 120 men dispersed, Fisher was nowhere to be found. The same evening, a different group of individuals assembled and pledged to stand by Meusebach, the next day passing resolutions condemning the actions of the mob.<ref>King (1967) p.103</ref> Meusebach himself had considered leaving Texas as early as November 1845, when he wrote to Count Castell and announced his intention to resign and return to Germany. Meusebach did not feel the Adelsverein was organized enough to achieve its goals. After the mob visit in New Braunfels, he again submitted his resignation to accompany a financial report to Castell on January 23, 1847.<ref>King (1967) pp.110,125</ref>\n\nMeusebach had arranged with the Torrey Brothers for transporting the emigrants inland, but the United States hired the Torrey Brothers for use in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].<ref>King (1967) pp.85,87</ref>\n\nMeusebach stabilized the community's finances, and encouraged the settlers to establish additional neighboring communities.

It also had access to two railways for shipping cotton bales. Its most famous attribute was the dance hall, a family activity in those days. Due to the failure of the cotton crop from [[boll weevil]]s, and the failure of the banks after 1929, commercial activity slowed to a crawl. This village is now a Nationally Registered Historic District where one can dine in the ruins of the original gristmill or enjoy live music at [[Gruene Hall]].

Prince Solms named the settlement in honor of his home of [[Solms-Braunfels]], [[Germany]].\n\nThe Adelsverein organized hundreds of people in Germany to settle in Texas. Immigrants from Germany began arriving at [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] in July 1844. Most then traveled by ship to [[Indianola, Texas|Indianola]] in December 1844, and began the overland journey to the Fisher-Miller land grant purchased by Prince Solms.<ref>King (1967) p.53</ref> At the urging of [[John Coffee Hays]], who realized the settlers would not have time to build homes and plant crops further inland before winter, and as the German settlers were traveling inland along the Guadalupe River, they stopped near the [[Comal Springs]]. Prince Solms bought two leagues of land from Rafael Garza and Maria Antonio Veramendi Garza for $1,111.00.<ref>King (1967) p.37</ref>\n\nThe land was located northeast of [[San Antonio]] on [[El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail|El Camino Real de los Tejas]] and had the strong freshwater Comal Springs, known as ''Las Fontanas'', when the Germans arrived.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comal Springs|url=http://www.edwardsaquifer.net/comal.html|publisher=Edwards Aquifer|accessdate=27 December 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Comal Springs\">{{cite web|last=Brune|first=Gunnar|title=Comal Springs|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/rpc02|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=27 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Brune|first=Gunnar|title=Springs of Texas: Volume I |year=2002|publisher=TAMU Press|isbn=978-1-58544-196-9|author2=Besse, Helen C |page=129}}</ref> It was about halfway between Indianola and the lower portions of the Fisher-Miller land grant.

Meusebach]] arrived, the finances were in disarray, due in part to Prince Solms' lack of business experience and his refusal to keep financial records. To a larger degree, the financial situation happened because the Adelsverein was an organization of noblemen with no practical backgrounds at running businesses. They were on the other side of the world and did not witness the situation with which both Prince Solms and Meusebach were dealing. [[Henry Francis Fisher]] had not supplied transport and supplies for which the Verein advanced money to him. Meusebach found Prince Solms in Galveston trying to return to Germany, detained by authorities for unpaid bills. Meusebach made good on the debts, so Prince Solms could depart.<ref>King (1967) pp.52\u201358</ref>\n\nMeusebach discovered that Prince Solms' choice of the inadequate Carlshafen (Indianola) as a port of entry, as well as the isolated route to New Braunfels, was deliberately chosen to keep the Germans from interacting with any Americans.  According to Nicolaus Zink,<ref>{{cite web| last=Ragsdale| first=Crystal Sasse| title=Nicolaus Zink| url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fzi01| work=Handbook of Texas Online| publisher=Texas State Historical Association| accessdate=3 January 2011}}</ref> Prince Solms had planned to establish a German feudal state by secretly bringing in immigrants and placing them in military fortresses. Meusebach, who had renounced his own title of nobility, took a different approach and invited Americans to settle in the Vereins territory.<ref>King (1967) pp.59\u201360</ref>\n\n[[Image:Old map-New Braunfels-1881.jpg|left|thumb|Old map (1881)]]\nPrince Solms, being an officer of the Imperial Army of [[Austria]], had kept a uniformed military unit at the ready in Indianola.  Meusebach converted the military unit to a more needed work detail.<ref>King (1967) p.63</ref> A finance and business structure for the colony was put in place by Meusebach.<ref>King (1967) p.64</ref> He also provided for adequate food and shelter for the colonists.<ref>King (1967) p.65</ref> On August 11, 1845, Hermann Friedrich Seele<ref>{{cite web| last=Breitenkamp| first=Edward C.| title=Hermann Friedrich Seele| url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fse06| work=Handbook of Texas Online| publisher=Texas State Historical Association| accessdate=27 December 2010}}</ref> became the first teacher for the German-English school in New Braunfels.<ref>King (1967) p.66</ref> Meusebach established friendly relations with a local tribe of [[Waco tribe|Waco Indians]]. Upon seeing his reddish-blonde hair, they called him ''Ma-be-quo-si-to-mu'', \"Chief with the burning hair of the head\".<ref>King (1967) p.67</ref>\n\nIn May 1846, Meusebach received a letter from Count Castell informing him 4,304 emigrants were on their way to Texas. With no funds and no new settlements, the mass of emigrants was stalled at Carlshafen. Meusebach's requests to the Verein for more money, and his warnings of pending bankruptcy for the Verein, brought no results. As a last resort, Meusebach instructed D.H. Klaener to publish the plight in the German news media. Embarrassed by the publicity, the Verein established a $60,000 letter of credit.<ref>King (1967) pp.75\u201383</ref> The amount was not adequate for sustaining the total number of German emigrants in Texas, but Castell also sent Philip Cappes as special commissioner to observe the situation. Cappes had also been instructed by Castell to observe Meusebach and to secretly report back every detail.<ref>Morgenthaler (2007) p.56</ref> By the time Cappes departed in March 1847, he recommended another $200,000 be advanced.<ref>King (1967) pp.96\u2013101</ref> [[File:Zeitung 1853.jpg|thumb|Front page of the ''Neu-Braunfelser Zeitung'' on September 16, 1853|alt=|left]]\n\nCappes invited Henry Francis Fisher to New Braunfels, in spite of Fisher not being entirely trustworthy to the Verein. As of February 11, 1845, Fisher had been involved in coercing newly arrived immigrants to sign documents stating their intent to depart from the Verein and align with Fisher's friend Dr. Friedrich Schubbert, also known as Friedrich Strubberg.\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>Cappes was not in town when Meusebach was breakfast host to Fisher on December 31, 1846. Posters had mysteriously appeared about town maligning Meusebach, saying \"Curses upon Meusebach the slave driver\", and inciting colonists to free themselves from his \"tyranny\". A group led by Rudolph Iwonski<ref>Johnson (2009) p.10</ref> pushed their way into Meusebach's home, and colonist C. Herber brandished a whip. Herber was an alleged counterfeiter to whom Count Castell had awarded asylum. Meusebach and Herber shared a dislike of one another.<ref>King (1967) p.98</ref>\n\nThe colonists' list of demands included Meusebach resigning as commissioner-general and turning the colonization over to Fisher.<ref>Morgenthaler (2007) p.61</ref> Meusebach kept his composure, but the group became so heated, they yelled, \"Hang him!\" When the estimated 120 men dispersed, Fisher was nowhere to be found. The same evening, a different group of individuals assembled and pledged to stand by Meusebach, the next day passing resolutions condemning the actions of the mob.<ref>King (1967) p.103</ref> Meusebach himself had considered leaving Texas as early as November 1845, when he wrote to Count Castell and announced his intention to resign and return to Germany. Meusebach did not feel the Adelsverein was organized enough to achieve its goals. After the mob visit in New Braunfels, he again submitted his resignation to accompany a financial report to Castell on January 23, 1847.<ref>King (1967) pp.110,125</ref>\n\nMeusebach had arranged with the Torrey Brothers for transporting the emigrants inland, but the United States hired the Torrey Brothers for use in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].<ref>King (1967) pp.85,87</ref>\n\nMeusebach stabilized the community's finances, and encouraged the settlers to establish additional neighboring communities. The largest of these secondary settlements was [[Fredericksburg, Texas|Fredericksburg]], {{convert|80|mi}} to the northwest of New Braunfels.\n\nNew Braunfels thrived, and by 1850, it was the fourth-largest city in Texas,<ref name=\"New Braunfels, Texas\"/> with 1,723 people, following only Galveston, San Antonio, and Houston in population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.texasalmanac.com/sites/default/files/images/CityPopHist%20web.pdf |title=City history |publisher=www.texasalmanac.com |date= |accessdate=2019-12-19}}</ref> In 1852, the ''Zeitung'' newspaper was established, edited by [[German Texan]] botanist [[Ferdinand Lindheimer]].

It also had access to two railways for shipping cotton bales. Its most famous attribute was the dance hall, a family activity in those days. Due to the failure of the cotton crop from [[boll weevil]]s, and the failure of the banks after 1929, commercial activity slowed to a crawl. This village is now a Nationally Registered Historic District where one can dine in the ruins of the original gristmill or enjoy live music at [[Gruene Hall]].

E.P. Milliken estimated that on the eve of the cyclone there were 43,500 people living in 12,000 dwellings in the Darwin area. Though building standards at the time required that some attention be given to the possibility of cyclones, most buildings were not capable of withstanding the force of a cyclone's direct hit.\n\nOn the day of the cyclone, most residents of Darwin believed that the cyclone would not cause any damage to the city. [[Cyclone Selma]] had been predicted to hit Darwin earlier in the month, but it instead went north and dissipated without affecting Darwin in any way. As a result, Cyclone Tracy took most Darwin residents by surprise. Despite several warnings the people of Darwin did not evacuate or prepare for the cyclone. Many residents continued to prepare for Christmas, and many attended Christmas parties, despite the increasing winds and heavy rain. Journalist Bill Bunbury interviewed the residents of Darwin some time later <!-- will find out when --> and recorded the experiences of the survivors of the cyclone in his book ''Cyclone Tracy, picking up the pieces''.<ref name=\"Bunbury\">{{cite book |last=Bunbury |first=Bill |year=1994 |title=Cyclone Tracy, picking up the pieces | location=Fremantle, Western Australia |publisher= Fremantle Arts Centre Press |isbn=1-86368-112-4}}</ref> Resident Dawn Lawrie, a 1971 independent candidate for the electorate of [[Nightcliff, Northern Territory|Nightcliff]], told him:\n\n{{cquote|''We'd had a cyclone warning only 10 days before Tracy [that another cyclone] was coming, it was coming, and it never came.

At Darwin Airport, thirty-one aircraft were destroyed and another twenty-five badly damaged.<ref name=bigblow2 /> The initial estimate put the reported death toll at 65, but it was revised upwards in March 2005 to 71, when the [[Northern Territory]] Coroner proclaimed that those six who still remained listed as missing had \"perished at sea\".<ref name=\"Deathtoll\" /><ref name=EMAtctracy />\n\nSeveral factors delayed the dissemination of the news of the cyclone's impact. The destruction of transportation infrastructure and the distance between Darwin and the rest of the Australian population played a role, as did the fact the storm made landfall on [[Christmas Day]] and most media outlets had only a skeleton crew rostered on at best. Most Australians were not aware of the cyclone until late in the afternoon.  Dick Muddimer, a reporter for the local [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] station, [[105.7 ABC Darwin|8DR]], was able to travel through the wreckage to local television station [[NTD (television station)|NTD]] and had the ABC station in [[Mount Isa]], Queensland notify ABC headquarters in [[Sydney]] that Darwin had been hit by a cyclone.<ref name=ABCHistory>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161022013911/http://www.abc.net.au/darwin/about History of 105.7 ABC Darwin] from ABC Online</ref>\n\nIn order to provide the initial emergency response, a committee was created. The committee, composed of several high-level public servants and police, stated that, \"Darwin had, for the time being, ceased to exist as a city\". [[Gough Whitlam]], the Australian Prime Minister, was touring [[Syracuse, Sicily]] at the time and flew to Darwin upon hearing of the disaster. Additionally, the Australian government began a mass evacuation by road and air; all of the [[Australian Defence Force|Defence Force]] personnel throughout Australia, along with the entire [[Royal Australian Air Force]]'s fleet of transport planes, were recalled from holiday leave and deployed to evacuate civilians from Darwin, as well as to bring essential relief supplies to the area. Thirteen RAN ships were used to transport supplies to the area as part of [[Operation Navy Help Darwin]]; the largest humanitarian or disaster relief operation ever performed by the Navy.<ref name=\"Semaphore 14\">{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/media-room/publications/semaphore-december-2004 |title=Disaster Relief&nbsp;\u2014 Cyclone Tracy and Tasman Bridge |publisher=Sea Power Centre |work=Semaphore |accessdate=6 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531125906/http://www.navy.gov.au/media-room/publications/semaphore-december-2004 |archive-date=31 May 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Health and essential services crisis===\nAs soon as the worst of the storm had passed, Darwin faced several immediate health crises. On Christmas Day, the Darwin Hospital treated well over five hundred patients, with 112 of these being admitted into the hospital, and both of the facility's operating theatres being utilised. The first casualties did not arrive till 7 a.m. because of high winds and severe road conditions in and around the Darwin area. Operating continued throughout the night and into the early morning. Local teams worked without relief until the arrival of a surgical team from Canberra late that day. Those who were considered unable to return to work within two weeks were evacuated by air to safer locations.\n\nAll official communications out of Darwin were no longer operational. The antennas at the OTC Coastal Radio Service station (callsign VID) were destroyed during the storm. Station manager Bob Hooper, who was an [[amateur radio operator]], helped to establish communications using his own equipment. By 10 a.m. Gary Gibson, another amateur operator, was able to establish a station at the Darwin Community College, and within a short period of time a network of stations was established across the country. This network, coordinated by Melbourne D24 police, provided message services to the cities of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra, [[Townsville]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]], [[Alice Springs]], Gove, Mt Isa, Cairns, Rockhampton, MacKay, Lismore, and Cooma.<ref>Electronics Australia magazine March 1975</ref> By 10:40&nbsp;a.m. VID operators had established VID2 on board the MV ''Nyanda'' in Darwin Harbour, and then for five days official communications traffic in and out of Darwin was handled via [[continuous wave]] radio ([[Morse code]]).  The only local radio station that wasn't completely disabled was the ABC's [[8DR]]. For the next two days, it was Darwin's only link to the outside world, and was on the air for all but 34 hours in the coming weeks.<ref name=ABCHistory/>\n\nThose who remained in Darwin faced the threat of several diseases due to much of the city being without water, electricity or basic sanitation. An initial response was to vaccinate residents for typhoid and cholera. Approximately 30,000 people were homeless, and were forced to seek shelter in several makeshift housing and emergency centres that lacked proper hygienic conditions. Volunteers came in from across the country to assist with the emergency relief efforts. Trench [[latrine]]s were dug; water supplies delivered by tankers, and mass immunisation programs begun. The army was given the task of searching houses for bodies of people and animals, as well as locating other health risks; for example, cleaning out rotting contents from fridges and freezers across the city. This was completed within a week. Houses which had been 'searched and cleared' had S&C painted on an external wall. The city itself was sprayed with [[malathion]] to control mosquitoes and other similar pests.\n\nAttempts to reconnect the essential services to the city began on Christmas Day. Local officers from the Commonwealth Department of Housing and Construction began clearing debris and working to restore power. They sealed off damaged water hydrants and activated pumps to reactivate the city's water and sewerage systems.\n\n===Evacuation and the public response=== food is good for you when you have diabetes and you don't have insulin :)   \nand I like foots that has long toe nails that can also dance :)\nMajor-General [[Alan Stretton]], Director-General of the Natural Disasters Organisation,<ref name=naaTCtracy /> and the Commonwealth Minister for the Northern Territory, [[Rex Patterson]], arrived at Darwin Airport late on Christmas Day and took charge of the relief efforts. After an assessment of the situation and meetings with the Department of the Northern Territory and the relevant minister, it was concluded that Darwin's population needed to be reduced to a \"safe level\" of 10,500 people. This decision was made on the advice of Dr. Charles Gurd, the Director of Health in the Northern Territory. Around 10,000 people left Darwin and the surrounding area within the first two days, but the rate of departures then began to slow down. The government then gave support to his position, offering full reimbursement of personal costs, as long as the evacuation took place.\n\nThe population was evacuated by air and ground; because of communications difficulties with Darwin airport, landing was limited to one plane every ninety minutes. At major airports, teams of federal and territory department officials as well as [[Salvation Army]] and [[Red Cross]] workers met refugees, with the Red Cross taking responsibility for keeping track of the names and temporary addresses of the refugees. Evacuations were prioritised according to need; women, children, and the elderly and sick were evacuated first. There were reports of men dressing up as women to escape with the early evacuations. Between 26 and 31 December, a total of 35,362 people were evacuated from Darwin.<ref name=EMAtctracy /><ref name=bigblow2>{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Kevin|title=Big Blow up North|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/history/pdf/bigblowupnorth.pdf|publisher=University Planning Authority|accessdate=4 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228171040/http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/history/pdf/bigblowupnorth.pdf|archive-date=28 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Of those, 25,628 were evacuated by air, the remainder by road.<ref name=EMAtctracy /><ref name=bigblow2 /> By 31 December, only 10,638 people (mostly men who were required to help clean up the city) remained in Darwin. Stretton also regulated access to the city by means of a permit system. Permits were only issued to those who were involved in either the relief or reconstruction efforts, and were used to prevent the early return of those who had been evacuated.\n\nUpon receiving news of the damage, several community groups across Australia began fundraising and relief efforts to assist the survivors. Major reception centres were set up in cities such as [[Katherine]], [[Tennant Creek]] and Alice Springs. Several of the small towns along the Stuart Highway made efforts to assist people who were fleeing by road, supplying them with food, fuel, rest and mechanical aid. At [[Adelaide River]], the small local population provided hot meals to the refugees who stopped there. Approximately twenty-four hours after the storm hit Darwin, the population of Alice Springs had raised over $105,000 to assist the victims of Tracy.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Australian Geographic]] |title=Cyclone Tracy hits Darwin |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/on-this-day/2014/12/on-this-day-in-history-cyclone-tracy |accessdate=5 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317182152/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/on-this-day/2014/12/on-this-day-in-history-cyclone-tracy |archive-date=17 March 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> In Melbourne at the [[Boxing Day Test]] [[cricket]] match between [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[England cricket team|England]], members of both teams moved around the boundaries carrying buckets which the crowd threw cash into for the relief funds. Darwin families were also given priority on public housing waiting lists. On 31 December 1974, Stretton recommended that full civilian control should resume in Darwin, and handed over control of the city to its elected officials.\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Reconstruction and effects on Darwin===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2016}}\nIn February 1975, Whitlam announced the creation of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, which was given the task of rebuilding the city \"within five years\", focusing primarily on building houses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110636986|first=Bruce|last=Juddery|author-link=Bruce Juddery|title=Reconstruction Commission: Doubt and disillusion grows in Darwin|page=2|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=9 May 1975|access-date=29 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002162631/http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110636986|archive-date=2 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The Commission was headed by Tony Powell.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Alan|title=The bushfire recovery|work=Macquarie Media Network|publisher=2GB|date=17 February 2009|url=http://2gb.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5636&Itemid=134|accessdate=5 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712142846/http://2gb.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5636&Itemid=134|archive-date=12 July 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> The damage to the city was so severe that some advocated moving the entire city. However, the government insisted that it be rebuilt in the same location. By May 1975, Darwin's population had recovered somewhat, with 30,000 residing in the city. Temporary housing, caravans, hotels and an [[ocean liner]], [[MV Bloemfontein Castle|MV ''Patris'']], were used to house people, as reconstruction of permanent housing had not yet begun by September that year. [[Ella Stack]] became Mayor of Darwin in May 1975 and was heavily involved in its reconstruction.\n\nHowever, by the following April, and after receiving criticism for the slow speed of reconstruction, the Commission had built 3,000 new homes in the nearly destroyed northern suburbs, and completed repairs to those that had survived the storm. Several new [[building codes]] were drawn up, trying to achieve the competing goals of the speedy recovery of the area and ensuring that there would be no repeat of the damage that Darwin took in 1974. By 1978, much of the city had recovered and was able to house almost the same number of people as it had before the cyclone hit. However, by the 1980s, as many as sixty percent of Darwin's 1974 population had left, never to return. In the years that followed, Darwin was almost entirely rebuilt and now shows almost no resemblance to the pre-Tracy Darwin of December 1974.\n\nAlthough a [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] had been set up earlier in the year, the Northern Territory had only minimal self-government, with a federal minister being responsible for the Territory from Canberra. However, the cyclone and subsequent responses highlighted several problems with the way the regional government was set up.  This led [[Malcolm Fraser]], Whitlam's successor as Prime Minister, to give self-government to the Territory in 1978.\n\nMany of the government records associated with Cyclone Tracy became publicly available on 1 January 2005 under the [[30-year rule]].\n\n{{anchor|Cyclone Tracy in popular culture}}\n\n===In popular culture===\nCyclone Tracy inspired the song \"Santa Never Made It into Darwin\", composed by Bill Cate and performed by [[Bill and Boyd]] in 1975 to raise money for the relief and reconstruction efforts.<ref>{{cite news|title=Santa never made it, but song to help Darwin|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MLUQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NpIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5568,5099|accessdate=7 July 2011|newspaper=The Age|date=1 January 1975|page=3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024212624/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MLUQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NpIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5568,5099|archive-date=24 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.westnet.com.au/anugraha/music/files/santa.txt |title=''Santa Never Made it into Darwin'' |author=Bill Cate |accessdate=24 March 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706113436/http://members.westnet.com.au/anugraha/music/files/santa.txt |archivedate=6 July 2011 }}</ref> In 1983 [[Hoodoo Gurus]] released \"[[Tojo (song)|Tojo]]\", a song comparing the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] bombing of Darwin under the command of [[Hideki Tojo]] during [[World War II]] to the damage done by Cyclone Tracy.

E.P. Milliken estimated that on the eve of the cyclone there were 43,500 people living in 12,000 dwellings in the Darwin area. Though building standards at the time required that some attention be given to the possibility of cyclones, most buildings were not capable of withstanding the force of a cyclone's direct hit.\n\nOn the day of the cyclone, most residents of Darwin believed that the cyclone would not cause any damage to the city. [[Cyclone Selma]] had been predicted to hit Darwin earlier in the month, but it instead went north and dissipated without affecting Darwin in any way. As a result, Cyclone Tracy took most Darwin residents by surprise. Despite several warnings the people of Darwin did not evacuate or prepare for the cyclone. Many residents continued to prepare for Christmas, and many attended Christmas parties, despite the increasing winds and heavy rain. Journalist Bill Bunbury interviewed the residents of Darwin some time later <!-- will find out when --> and recorded the experiences of the survivors of the cyclone in his book ''Cyclone Tracy, picking up the pieces''.<ref name=\"Bunbury\">{{cite book |last=Bunbury |first=Bill |year=1994 |title=Cyclone Tracy, picking up the pieces | location=Fremantle, Western Australia |publisher= Fremantle Arts Centre Press |isbn=1-86368-112-4}}</ref> Resident Dawn Lawrie, a 1971 independent candidate for the electorate of [[Nightcliff, Northern Territory|Nightcliff]], told him:\n\n{{cquote|''We'd had a cyclone warning only 10 days before Tracy [that another cyclone] was coming, it was coming, and it never came.

At Darwin Airport, thirty-one aircraft were destroyed and another twenty-five badly damaged.<ref name=bigblow2 /> The initial estimate put the reported death toll at 65, but it was revised upwards in March 2005 to 71, when the [[Northern Territory]] Coroner proclaimed that those six who still remained listed as missing had \"perished at sea\".<ref name=\"Deathtoll\" /><ref name=EMAtctracy />\n\nSeveral factors delayed the dissemination of the news of the cyclone's impact. The destruction of transportation infrastructure and the distance between Darwin and the rest of the Australian population played a role, as did the fact the storm made landfall on [[Christmas Day]] and most media outlets had only a skeleton crew rostered on at best. Most Australians were not aware of the cyclone until late in the afternoon.  Dick Muddimer, a reporter for the local [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] station, [[105.7 ABC Darwin|8DR]], was able to travel through the wreckage to local television station [[NTD (television station)|NTD]] and had the ABC station in [[Mount Isa]], Queensland notify ABC headquarters in [[Sydney]] that Darwin had been hit by a cyclone.<ref name=ABCHistory>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161022013911/http://www.abc.net.au/darwin/about History of 105.7 ABC Darwin] from ABC Online</ref>\n\nIn order to provide the initial emergency response, a committee was created. The committee, composed of several high-level public servants and police, stated that, \"Darwin had, for the time being, ceased to exist as a city\". [[Gough Whitlam]], the Australian Prime Minister, was touring [[Syracuse, Sicily]] at the time and flew to Darwin upon hearing of the disaster. Additionally, the Australian government began a mass evacuation by road and air; all of the [[Australian Defence Force|Defence Force]] personnel throughout Australia, along with the entire [[Royal Australian Air Force]]'s fleet of transport planes, were recalled from holiday leave and deployed to evacuate civilians from Darwin, as well as to bring essential relief supplies to the area. Thirteen RAN ships were used to transport supplies to the area as part of [[Operation Navy Help Darwin]]; the largest humanitarian or disaster relief operation ever performed by the Navy.<ref name=\"Semaphore 14\">{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/media-room/publications/semaphore-december-2004 |title=Disaster Relief&nbsp;\u2014 Cyclone Tracy and Tasman Bridge |publisher=Sea Power Centre |work=Semaphore |accessdate=6 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531125906/http://www.navy.gov.au/media-room/publications/semaphore-december-2004 |archive-date=31 May 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Health and essential services crisis===\nAs soon as the worst of the storm had passed, Darwin faced several immediate health crises. On Christmas Day, the Darwin Hospital treated well over five hundred patients, with 112 of these being admitted into the hospital, and both of the facility's operating theatres being utilised. The first casualties did not arrive till 7 a.m. because of high winds and severe road conditions in and around the Darwin area. Operating continued throughout the night and into the early morning. Local teams worked without relief until the arrival of a surgical team from Canberra late that day. Those who were considered unable to return to work within two weeks were evacuated by air to safer locations.\n\nAll official communications out of Darwin were no longer operational. The antennas at the OTC Coastal Radio Service station (callsign VID) were destroyed during the storm. Station manager Bob Hooper, who was an [[amateur radio operator]], helped to establish communications using his own equipment. By 10 a.m. Gary Gibson, another amateur operator, was able to establish a station at the Darwin Community College, and within a short period of time a network of stations was established across the country. This network, coordinated by Melbourne D24 police, provided message services to the cities of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra, [[Townsville]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]], [[Alice Springs]], Gove, Mt Isa, Cairns, Rockhampton, MacKay, Lismore, and Cooma.<ref>Electronics Australia magazine March 1975</ref> By 10:40&nbsp;a.m. VID operators had established VID2 on board the MV ''Nyanda'' in Darwin Harbour, and then for five days official communications traffic in and out of Darwin was handled via [[continuous wave]] radio ([[Morse code]]).  The only local radio station that wasn't completely disabled was the ABC's [[8DR]]. For the next two days, it was Darwin's only link to the outside world, and was on the air for all but 34 hours in the coming weeks.<ref name=ABCHistory/>\n\nThose who remained in Darwin faced the threat of several diseases due to much of the city being without water, electricity or basic sanitation. An initial response was to vaccinate residents for typhoid and cholera. Approximately 30,000 people were homeless, and were forced to seek shelter in several makeshift housing and emergency centres that lacked proper hygienic conditions. Volunteers came in from across the country to assist with the emergency relief efforts. Trench [[latrine]]s were dug; water supplies delivered by tankers, and mass immunisation programs begun. The army was given the task of searching houses for bodies of people and animals, as well as locating other health risks; for example, cleaning out rotting contents from fridges and freezers across the city. This was completed within a week. Houses which had been 'searched and cleared' had S&C painted on an external wall. The city itself was sprayed with [[malathion]] to control mosquitoes and other similar pests.\n\nAttempts to reconnect the essential services to the city began on Christmas Day. Local officers from the Commonwealth Department of Housing and Construction began clearing debris and working to restore power. They sealed off damaged water hydrants and activated pumps to reactivate the city's water and sewerage systems.\n\n===Evacuation and the public response===\nMajor-General [[Alan Stretton]], Director-General of the Natural Disasters Organisation,<ref name=naaTCtracy /> and the Commonwealth Minister for the Northern Territory, [[Rex Patterson]], arrived at Darwin Airport late on Christmas Day and took charge of the relief efforts. After an assessment of the situation and meetings with the Department of the Northern Territory and the relevant minister, it was concluded that Darwin's population needed to be reduced to a \"safe level\" of 10,500 people. This decision was made on the advice of Dr. Charles Gurd, the Director of Health in the Northern Territory. Around 10,000 people left Darwin and the surrounding area within the first two days, but the rate of departures then began to slow down. The government then gave support to his position, offering full reimbursement of personal costs, as long as the evacuation took place.\n\nThe population was evacuated by air and ground; because of communications difficulties with Darwin airport, landing was limited to one plane every ninety minutes. At major airports, teams of federal and territory department officials as well as [[Salvation Army]] and [[Red Cross]] workers met refugees, with the Red Cross taking responsibility for keeping track of the names and temporary addresses of the refugees. Evacuations were prioritised according to need; women, children, and the elderly and sick were evacuated first. There were reports of men dressing up as women to escape with the early evacuations. Between 26 and 31 December, a total of 35,362 people were evacuated from Darwin.<ref name=EMAtctracy /><ref name=bigblow2>{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Kevin|title=Big Blow up North|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/history/pdf/bigblowupnorth.pdf|publisher=University Planning Authority|accessdate=4 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228171040/http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/history/pdf/bigblowupnorth.pdf|archive-date=28 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Of those, 25,628 were evacuated by air, the remainder by road.<ref name=EMAtctracy /><ref name=bigblow2 /> By 31 December, only 10,638 people (mostly men who were required to help clean up the city) remained in Darwin. Stretton also regulated access to the city by means of a permit system. Permits were only issued to those who were involved in either the relief or reconstruction efforts, and were used to prevent the early return of those who had been evacuated.\n\nUpon receiving news of the damage, several community groups across Australia began fundraising and relief efforts to assist the survivors. Major reception centres were set up in cities such as [[Katherine]], [[Tennant Creek]] and Alice Springs. Several of the small towns along the Stuart Highway made efforts to assist people who were fleeing by road, supplying them with food, fuel, rest and mechanical aid. At [[Adelaide River]], the small local population provided hot meals to the refugees who stopped there. Approximately twenty-four hours after the storm hit Darwin, the population of Alice Springs had raised over $105,000 to assist the victims of Tracy.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Australian Geographic]] |title=Cyclone Tracy hits Darwin |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/on-this-day/2014/12/on-this-day-in-history-cyclone-tracy |accessdate=5 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317182152/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/on-this-day/2014/12/on-this-day-in-history-cyclone-tracy |archive-date=17 March 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> In Melbourne at the [[Boxing Day Test]] [[cricket]] match between [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[England cricket team|England]], members of both teams moved around the boundaries carrying buckets which the crowd threw cash into for the relief funds. Darwin families were also given priority on public housing waiting lists. On 31 December 1974, Stretton recommended that full civilian control should resume in Darwin, and handed over control of the city to its elected officials.\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Reconstruction and effects on Darwin===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2016}}\nIn February 1975, Whitlam announced the creation of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, which was given the task of rebuilding the city \"within five years\", focusing primarily on building houses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110636986|first=Bruce|last=Juddery|author-link=Bruce Juddery|title=Reconstruction Commission: Doubt and disillusion grows in Darwin|page=2|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=9 May 1975|access-date=29 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002162631/http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110636986|archive-date=2 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The Commission was headed by Tony Powell.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Alan|title=The bushfire recovery|work=Macquarie Media Network|publisher=2GB|date=17 February 2009|url=http://2gb.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5636&Itemid=134|accessdate=5 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712142846/http://2gb.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5636&Itemid=134|archive-date=12 July 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> The damage to the city was so severe that some advocated moving the entire city. However, the government insisted that it be rebuilt in the same location. By May 1975, Darwin's population had recovered somewhat, with 30,000 residing in the city. Temporary housing, caravans, hotels and an [[ocean liner]], [[MV Bloemfontein Castle|MV ''Patris'']], were used to house people, as reconstruction of permanent housing had not yet begun by September that year. [[Ella Stack]] became Mayor of Darwin in May 1975 and was heavily involved in its reconstruction.\n\nHowever, by the following April, and after receiving criticism for the slow speed of reconstruction, the Commission had built 3,000 new homes in the nearly destroyed northern suburbs, and completed repairs to those that had survived the storm. Several new [[building codes]] were drawn up, trying to achieve the competing goals of the speedy recovery of the area and ensuring that there would be no repeat of the damage that Darwin took in 1974. By 1978, much of the city had recovered and was able to house almost the same number of people as it had before the cyclone hit. However, by the 1980s, as many as sixty percent of Darwin's 1974 population had left, never to return. In the years that followed, Darwin was almost entirely rebuilt and now shows almost no resemblance to the pre-Tracy Darwin of December 1974.\n\nAlthough a [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] had been set up earlier in the year, the Northern Territory had only minimal self-government, with a federal minister being responsible for the Territory from Canberra. However, the cyclone and subsequent responses highlighted several problems with the way the regional government was set up.  This led [[Malcolm Fraser]], Whitlam's successor as Prime Minister, to give self-government to the Territory in 1978.\n\nMany of the government records associated with Cyclone Tracy became publicly available on 1 January 2005 under the [[30-year rule]].\n\n{{anchor|Cyclone Tracy in popular culture}}\n\n===In popular culture===\nCyclone Tracy inspired the song \"Santa Never Made It into Darwin\", composed by Bill Cate and performed by [[Bill and Boyd]] in 1975 to raise money for the relief and reconstruction efforts.<ref>{{cite news|title=Santa never made it, but song to help Darwin|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MLUQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NpIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5568,5099|accessdate=7 July 2011|newspaper=The Age|date=1 January 1975|page=3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024212624/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MLUQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NpIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5568,5099|archive-date=24 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.westnet.com.au/anugraha/music/files/santa.txt |title=''Santa Never Made it into Darwin'' |author=Bill Cate |accessdate=24 March 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706113436/http://members.westnet.com.au/anugraha/music/files/santa.txt |archivedate=6 July 2011 }}</ref> In 1983 [[Hoodoo Gurus]] released \"[[Tojo (song)|Tojo]]\", a song comparing the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] bombing of Darwin under the command of [[Hideki Tojo]] during [[World War II]] to the damage done by Cyclone Tracy.

The twelve member institutions are located in the [[South Atlantic states]] of [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]], and [[Florida]].  In addition, there are five affiliate members who participate in one sport each; where their home conference does not sponsor that sport.\n\nSince its inception in 1990-91, the Peach Belt has, across all sanctioned sports, produced 30 national champions and additional 27 national finalists. Starting with only two championships in 1991, in men's and women's basketball, the conference has expanded to 13 championship sports with the addition of women's golf in the fall of 2009.\n\n==History==\n\nThe conference traces its roots back to November 1988 when 11 schools first met in Greenville, S.C. to form a Division II conference. Following a second meeting on Dec. 3, 1989, five of those 11 schools, plus two others, formed the Peach Belt Athletic Conference and began play in the fall of 1990.\n\nThe seven charter members of the conference were [[Armstrong State University|Armstrong Atlantic State University]] (now Armstrong State University), [[Columbus State University]], [[Francis Marion University]], [[Georgia College & State University|Georgia College]] (now Georgia College & State University), [[Lander University]], [[University of South Carolina Aiken|USC Aiken]], and [[University of South Carolina Upstate|USC Upstate]]. The name Peach Belt Athletic Conference was adopted in January 1990 and modified to Peach Belt Conference in May 2000.\n\n[[Augusta State University]] joined the conference in 1991 and [[University of North Carolina at Pembroke|UNC Pembroke]] became the ninth member on July 1, 1992. They were followed by [[Kennesaw State University]] on July 1, 1994, [[Clayton State University]] on July 1, 1995 and the [[University of North Florida]] on July 1, 1997. Kennesaw State and North Florida departed for the Division I ranks in 2005, USC Upstate did the same in 2007, and the conference welcomed in [[North Georgia College & State University]] in 2005 and [[Georgia Southwestern State University]] in 2006. In 2009-10, the [[University of Montevallo]] and [[Flagler College]] were added, returning a league presence to Florida and broke new ground in Alabama. In 2012-13, the Peach Belt expanded to 14 members, the most the league has ever had, with the addition of [[Young Harris College]]. On January 8, 2013, the [[University System of Georgia]] finalized the mergers of two conference members into new institutions. Augusta State was merged into Georgia Regents University, which was renamed in 2015 as [[Augusta University]], and NGCSU was merged into the [[University of North Georgia]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Board of Regents finalizes consolidations, approves presidents|url=http://www.usg.edu/news/release/board_of_regents_finalizes_consolidations_appoints_presidents |publisher=University System of Georgia|accessdate=2013-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local-education/so-long-georgia-regents-hello-augusta-university/nnfgk/|title=So long, Georgia Regents. Hello, Augusta University|publisher=}}</ref> In both cases, the new institutions inherited the Peach Belt memberships of the older schools.\n\n[[File:Peach Belt Conference membership (as of 2014).png|thumb|Map of Southeastern United States with member institutions in the Division II Peach Belt Conference]]\nThe Peach Belt was less than a year old before capturing its first of many national championships. The Columbus State golf team took the honor by winning the 1992 national crown, the first of three golf championships the Cougars own. One year later, the Lander men's tennis team began their record-breaking run of eight straight national titles, the first PBC dynasty. Since then, USCA men's golf has won three straight national titles from 2004-06 while AASU women's tennis has captured four titles overall.\n\nThe 2010-11 season was one of the most memorable the league has ever had. Clayton State became the first PBC women's basketball team to capture a national championship. Montevallo watched their men's basketball team reach the Elite Eight, eventually competing in the National Championship Game. Unfortunately, their run came to an end with a loss to [[Western Washington University]]. The Columbus State men's tennis team reached the national semifinals while the Clayton State and Armstrong Atlantic State women's tennis teams also played in the national semifinals. The North Georgia softball team made an unprecedented third straight appearance in the NCAA Women's College World Series, while Columbus State's Meshack Koyiaki registered a runner-up finish at the Men's Cross Country National Championships. In all, 46 Peach Belt teams made appearances in the NCAA postseason, including seven men's tennis teams and six each in the sports of men's golf and women's tennis.\n\nDavid Brunk was named the second PBC commissioner in May 2007. Brunk replaced Marvin Vanover, who was the first PBC commissioner from 1991 to 2007. Brunk is charged with continuing the strong growth of the conference as its second era begins.\n\nDr. Kendall Blanchard, president of Georgia Southwestern State University, began the second of his two-year term as the league president in July 2011.\n\nIn April, 2020, Francis Marion University and the University of North Carolina at Pembroke announced that they are leaving the Peach Belt Conference effective 2021-22, and will both join [[Conference Carolinas]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Conference Carolinas Announces Addition of Francis Marion and UNC Pembroke|url=https://www.conferencecarolinas.com/newmembers |publisher=Conference Carolinas|accessdate=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\nThe conference currently holds championships in 13 sports, six for men and seven for women. They are men's and women's cross country, men's and women's soccer, volleyball, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's tennis, baseball, softball and men's and women's golf.<ref>{{cite

The twelve member institutions are located in the [[South Atlantic states]] of [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]], and [[Florida]].  In addition, there are five affiliate members who participate in one sport each; where their home conference does not sponsor that sport.\n\nSince its inception in 1990-91, the Peach Belt has, across all sanctioned sports, produced 30 national champions and additional 27 national finalists. Starting with only two championships in 1991, in men's and women's basketball, the conference has expanded to 13 championship sports with the addition of women's golf in the fall of 2009.\n\n==History==\n\nThe conference traces its roots back to November 1988 when 11 schools first met in Greenville, S.C. to form a Division II conference. Following a second meeting on Dec. 3, 1989, five of those 11 schools, plus two others, formed the Peach Belt Athletic Conference and began play in the fall of 1990.\n\nThe seven charter members of the conference were [[Armstrong State University|Armstrong Atlantic State University]] (now Armstrong State University), [[Columbus State University]], [[Francis Marion University]], [[Georgia College & State University|Georgia College]] (now Georgia College & State University), [[Lander University]], [[University of South Carolina Aiken|USC Aiken]], and [[University of South Carolina Upstate|USC Upstate]]. The name Peach Belt Athletic Conference was adopted in January 1990 and modified to Peach Belt Conference in May 2000.\n\n[[Augusta State University]] joined the conference in 1991 and [[University of North Carolina at Pembroke|UNC Pembroke]] became the ninth member on July 1, 1992. They were followed by [[Kennesaw State University]] on July 1, 1994, [[Clayton State University]] on July 1, 1995 and the [[University of North Florida]] on July 1, 1997. Kennesaw State and North Florida departed for the Division I ranks in 2005, USC Upstate did the same in 2007, and the conference welcomed in [[North Georgia College & State University]] in 2005 and [[Georgia Southwestern State University]] in 2006. In 2009-10, the [[University of Montevallo]] and [[Flagler College]] were added, returning a league presence to Florida and broke new ground in Alabama. In 2012-13, the Peach Belt expanded to 14 members, the most the league has ever had, with the addition of [[Young Harris College]]. On January 8, 2013, the [[University System of Georgia]] finalized the mergers of two conference members into new institutions. Augusta State was merged into Georgia Regents University, which was renamed in 2015 as [[Augusta University]], and NGCSU was merged into the [[University of North Georgia]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Board of Regents finalizes consolidations, approves presidents|url=http://www.usg.edu/news/release/board_of_regents_finalizes_consolidations_appoints_presidents |publisher=University System of Georgia|accessdate=2013-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local-education/so-long-georgia-regents-hello-augusta-university/nnfgk/|title=So long, Georgia Regents. Hello, Augusta University|publisher=}}</ref> In both cases, the new institutions inherited the Peach Belt memberships of the older schools.\n\n[[File:Peach Belt Conference membership (as of 2014).png|thumb|Map of Southeastern United States with member institutions in the Division II Peach Belt Conference]]\nThe Peach Belt was less than a year old before capturing its first of many national championships. The Columbus State golf team took the honor by winning the 1992 national crown, the first of three golf championships the Cougars own. One year later, the Lander men's tennis team began their record-breaking run of eight straight national titles, the first PBC dynasty. Since then, USCA men's golf has won three straight national titles from 2004-06 while AASU women's tennis has captured four titles overall.\n\nThe 2010-11 season was one of the most memorable the league has ever had. Clayton State became the first PBC women's basketball team to capture a national championship. Montevallo watched their men's basketball team reach the Elite Eight, eventually competing in the National Championship Game. Unfortunately, their run came to an end with a loss to [[Western Washington University]]. The Columbus State men's tennis team reached the national semifinals while the Clayton State and Armstrong Atlantic State women's tennis teams also played in the national semifinals. The North Georgia softball team made an unprecedented third straight appearance in the NCAA Women's College World Series, while Columbus State's Meshack Koyiaki registered a runner-up finish at the Men's Cross Country National Championships. In all, 46 Peach Belt teams made appearances in the NCAA postseason, including seven men's tennis teams and six each in the sports of men's golf and women's tennis.\n\nDavid Brunk was named the second PBC commissioner in May 2007. Brunk replaced Marvin Vanover, who was the first PBC commissioner from 1991 to 2007. Brunk is charged with continuing the strong growth of the conference as its second era begins.\n\nDr. Kendall Blanchard, president of Georgia Southwestern State University, began the second of his two-year term as the league president in July 2011.\n\nIn April, 2020, Francis Marion University and the University of North Carolina at Pembroke announced that they are leaving the Peach Belt Conference effective 2021-22, and will both join [[Conference Carolinas]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Conference Carolinas Announces Addition of Francis Marion and UNC Pembroke|url=https://www.conferencecarolinas.com/newmembers |publisher=Conference Carolinas|accessdate=2020-04-17}}\n\nThe conference currently holds championships in 13 sports, six for men and seven for women. They are men's and women's cross country, men's and women's soccer, volleyball, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's tennis, baseball, softball and men's and women's golf.<ref>{{cite
