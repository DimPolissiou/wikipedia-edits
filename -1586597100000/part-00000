{"title_page": "Square number", "text_new": "{{short description|Product of an integer with itself}}\n{{more footnotes|date=February 2012}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''square number''' or '''perfect square''' is an [[integer]] that is the [[square (algebra)|square]] of an integer;<ref>Some authors also call squares of [[rational numbers]] perfect squares.</ref> in other words, it is the [[multiplication|product]] of some integer with itself. For example, 9 is a square number, since it can be written as {{math|3\u2009\u00d7\u20093}}.\n\nThe usual notation for the square of a number {{mvar|n}} is not the product {{math|''n''\u2009\u00d7\u2009''n''}}, but the equivalent [[exponentiation]] {{math|''n''<sup>2</sup>}}, usually pronounced as \"{{mvar|n}} squared\". The name ''square'' number comes from the name of the shape. The unit of [[area]] is defined as the area of a [[unit square]] ({{math|1\u2009\u00d7\u20091}}). Hence, a square with side length {{mvar|n}} has area {{math|''n''<sup>2</sup>}}. In other words, if a square number is represented by n points, the points can be arranged in rows as a square each side of which has the same number of points as the square root of n; thus, square numbers are a type of figurate numbers (other examples being [[cube]] numbers and [[triangular numbers]]).\n\nSquare numbers are [[non-negative]]. Another way of saying that a (non-negative) integer is a square number is that its [[square root]] is again an integer.

Animated 3D visualization on a tetrahedron.]]\nThere are several [[recursion#Recursion in mathematics|recursive]] methods for computing square numbers. For example, the {{mvar|n}}th square number can be computed from the previous square by {{math|''n''{{sup|2}} {{=}} (''n'' \u2212 1){{sup|2}} + (''n'' \u2212 1) + n {{=}} (''n'' \u2212 1){{sup|2}} + (2''n'' \u2212 1)}}. Alternatively, the {{mvar|n}}th square number can be calculated from the previous two by doubling the {{math|(''n''\u2009\u2212\u20091)}}th square, subtracting the {{math|(''n''\u2009\u2212\u20092)}}th square number, and adding 2, because {{math|1=''n''<sup>2</sup> = 2(''n'' \u2212 1)<sup>2</sup> \u2212 (''n'' \u2212 2)<sup>2</sup> + 2}}. For example,\n:{{math|1= 2\u2009\u00d7\u20095<sup>2</sup> \u2212 4<sup>2</sup> + 2 = 2\u2009\u00d7\u200925 \u2212 16 + 2 = 50 \u2212 16 + 2 = 36 = 6<sup>2</sup>}}.\n\nOne number less than a square (''m'' - 1) is always the product of {{sqrt|''m''}} - 1 and {{sqrt|''m''}} + 1 (e.g. 8 \u00d7 6 equals 48, while 7{{sup|2}} equals 49).  Thus, 3 is the only prime number one less than a square.\n\nA square number is also the sum of two consecutive [[triangular number]]s. The sum of two consecutive square numbers is a [[centered square number]]. Every odd square is also a [[centered octagonal number]].\n\nAnother property of a square number is that (except 0) it has an odd number of positive divisors, while other natural numbers have an even number of positive divisors. An integer root is the only divisor that pairs up with itself to yield the square number, while other divisors come in pairs.\n\n[[Lagrange's four-square theorem]] states that any positive integer can be written as the sum of four or fewer perfect squares. Three squares are not sufficient for numbers of the form {{math|4<sup>''k''</sup>(8''m'' + 7)}}. A positive integer can be represented as a sum of two squares precisely if its [[prime factorization]] contains no odd powers of primes of the form {{math|4''k'' + 3}}. This is generalized by [[Waring's problem]].\n\nIn [[base 10]], a square number can end only with digits 0, 1,\u2009 4, \u20095, 6 or\u2009 9, as follows:\n\n* if the last digit of a number is 0, its square ends in 0 (in fact, the last two digits must be 00);\n* if the last digit of a number is 1 or 9, its square ends in 1;\n* if the last digit of a number is 2 or 8, its square ends in 4;\n* if the last digit of a number is 3 or 7, its square ends in 9;\n* if the last digit of a number is 4 or 6, its square ends in 6; and\n* if the last digit of a number is 5, its square ends in 5 (in fact, the last two digits must be 25).\n\nIn [[base 12]], a square number can end only with square digits (like in base 12, a [[prime number]] can end only with prime digits or 1), i.e. 0, 1, 4 or 9, as follows:\n\n* if a number is divisible both by 2 and by 3 (i.e. divisible by 6), its square ends in 0;\n* if a number is divisible neither by 2 nor by 3, its square ends in 1;\n* if a number is divisible by 2, but not by 3, its square ends in 4; and\n* if a number is not divisible by 2, but by 3, its square ends in 9.\n\nSimilar rules can be given for other bases, or for earlier digits (the tens instead of the units digit, for example).{{cn|date=March 2016}}  All such rules can be proved by checking a fixed number of cases and using [[modular arithmetic]].\n\nIn general, if a [[prime]]&nbsp;{{mvar|p}} divides a square number&nbsp;{{mvar|m}} then the square of {{mvar|p}} must also divide {{mvar|m}}; if {{mvar|p}} fails to divide {{math|{{sfrac|''m''|''p''}}}}, then {{mvar|m}} is definitely not square. Repeating the divisions of the previous sentence, one concludes that every prime must divide a given perfect square an even number of times (including possibly 0 times). Thus, the number {{mvar|m}} is a square number if and only if, in its [[canonical representation of a positive integer|canonical representation]], all exponents are even.\n\nSquarity testing can be used as alternative way in [[factorization]] of large numbers. Instead of testing for divisibility, test for squarity: for given {{mvar|m}} and some number&nbsp;{{mvar|k}}, if {{math|''k''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''m''}} is the square of an integer&nbsp;{{mvar|n}} then {{math|''k'' \u2212 ''n''}} divides {{mvar|m}}. (This is an application of the factorization of a [[difference of two squares]].) For example, {{math|100<sup>2</sup> \u2212 9991}} is the square of 3, so consequently {{math|100 \u2212 3}} divides 9991. This test is deterministic for odd divisors in the range from {{math|''k'' \u2212 ''n''}} to {{math|''k'' + ''n''}} where {{mvar|k}} covers some range of natural numbers {{math|''k'' \u2265 {{sqrt|''m''}}}}.\n\nA square number cannot be a [[perfect number]].\n\nThe sum  of the ''n'' first square numbers is\n: <math>\\sum_{n=0}^N n^2 = 0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + \\cdots + N^2 = \\frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6}.</math>\nThe first values of these sums, the [[square pyramidal number]]s, are: {{OEIS|id=A000330}}\n<blockquote>\n0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, 91, 140, 204, 285, 385, 506, 650, 819, 1015, 1240, 1496, 1785, 2109, 2470, 2870, 3311, 3795, 4324, 4900, 5525, 6201...\n</blockquote>\nThe sum of the first odd integers, beginning with one, is a perfect square: 1, 1 + 3, 1 + 3 + 5, 1 + 3 + 5 + 7, etc.\n\nThe sum of the ''n'' first [[cube (algebra)|cubes]] is the square of the sum of the ''n'' first positive integers; this is [[Nicomachus's theorem]].\n\nAll fourth powers, sixth powers, eighth powers and so on are perfect squares.\n\n==Odd and even square numbers== <!-- This section is linked from [[Irrational number]] -->\n\nSquares of even numbers are even (and in fact divisible by 4), since {{math|1=(2''n'')<sup>2</sup> = 4''n''<sup>2</sup>}}.\n\nSquares of odd numbers are odd, since {{math|1=(2''n'' + 1)<sup>2</sup> = 4(''n''<sup>2</sup> + ''n'') + 1}}.\n\nIt follows that square roots of even square numbers are even, and square roots of odd square numbers are odd.\n\nAs all even square numbers are divisible by 4, the even numbers of the form {{math|4''n'' + 2}} are not square numbers.\n\nAs all odd square numbers are of the form {{math|4''n'' + 1}}, the odd numbers of the form {{math|4''n'' + 3}} are not square numbers.\n\nSquares of odd numbers are of the form {{math|8''n'' + 1}}, since {{math|1=(2''n'' + 1)<sup>2</sup> = 4''n''(''n'' + 1) + 1}} and {{math|1=''n''(''n'' + 1)}} is an even number.\n\nEvery odd perfect square is a [[centered octagonal number]]. The difference between any two odd perfect squares is a multiple of 8. The difference between 1 and any higher odd perfect square always is eight times a triangular number, while the difference between 9 and any higher odd perfect square is eight times a triangular number minus eight. Since all triangular numbers have an odd factor, but no two values of {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup>}} differ by an amount containing an odd factor, the only perfect square of the form {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1}} is 1, and the only perfect square of the form {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup> + 1}} is 9.\n\n==Special cases==\n* If the number is of the form {{math|''m''5}} where {{math|''m''}} represents the preceding digits, its square is {{math|''n''25}} where {{math|1=''n'' = ''m''(''m'' + 1)}} and represents digits before 25. For example, the square of 65 can be calculated by {{math|1=''n'' = 6 \u00d7 (6 + 1) = 42}} which makes the square equal to 4225.\n* If the number is of the form {{math|''m''0}} where {{math|''m''}} represents the preceding digits, its square is {{math|''n''00}} where {{math|1=''n'' = ''m''<sup>2</sup>}}. For example, the square of 70 is 4900.\n* If the number has two digits and is of the form {{math|5''m''}} where {{math|''m''}} represents the units digit, its square is {{math|''aabb''}} where {{math|1=''aa'' = 25 + ''m''}} and {{math|1=''bb'' = ''m''<sup>2</sup>}}. Example: To calculate the square of 57, 25&nbsp;+&nbsp;7&nbsp;=&nbsp;32 and 7<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;49, which means 57<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3249.\n* If the number ends in 5, its square will end in 5; similarly for ending in 25, 625, 0625, 90625, ... 8212890625, etc. If the number ends in 6, its square will end in 6, similarly for ending in 76, 376, 9376, 09376, ... 1787109376. For example, the square of 55376 is 3066501376, both ending in ''376''. (The numbers 5, 6, 25, 76, etc. are called [[automorphic number]]s.

For example, 9 is a square number, since it can be written as {{math|3\u2009\u00d7\u20093}}.\n\nThe usual notation for the square of a number {{mvar|n}} is not the product {{math|''n''\u2009\u00d7\u2009''n''}}, but the equivalent [[exponentiation]] {{math|''n''<sup>2</sup>}}, usually pronounced as \"{{mvar|n}} squared\". The name ''square'' number comes from the name of the shape. The unit of [[area]] is defined as the area of a [[unit square]] ({{math|1\u2009\u00d7\u20091}}). Hence, a square with side length {{mvar|n}} has area {{math|''n''<sup>2</sup>}}. In other words, if a square number is represented by n points, the points can be arranged in rows as a square each side of which has the same number of points as the square root of n; thus, square numbers are a type of figurate numbers (other examples being [[cube]] numbers and [[triangular numbers]]).\n\nSquare numbers are [[non-negative]]. Another way of saying that a (non-negative) integer is a square number is that its [[square root]] is again an integer.

For example,\n:{{math|1= 2\u2009\u00d7\u20095<sup>2</sup> \u2212 4<sup>2</sup> + 2 = 2\u2009\u00d7\u200925 \u2212 16 + 2 = 50 \u2212 16 + 2 = 36 = 6<sup>2</sup>}}.\n\nOne number less than a square (''m'' - 1) is always the product of {{sqrt|''m''}} - 1 and {{sqrt|''m''}} + 1 (e.g. 8 \u00d7 6 equals 48, while 7{{sup|2}} equals 49).  Thus, 3 is the only prime number one less than a square.\n\nA square number is also the sum of two consecutive [[triangular number]]s. The sum of two consecutive square numbers is a [[centered square number]]. Every odd square is also a [[centered octagonal number]].\n\nAnother property of a square number is that (except 0) it has an odd number of positive divisors, while other natural numbers have an even number of positive divisors. An integer root is the only divisor that pairs up with itself to yield the square number, while other divisors come in pairs.\n\n[[Lagrange's four-square theorem]] states that any positive integer can be written as the sum of four or fewer perfect squares. Three squares are not sufficient for numbers of the form {{math|4<sup>''k''</sup>(8''m'' + 7)}}. A positive integer can be represented as a sum of two squares precisely if its [[prime factorization]] contains no odd powers of primes of the form {{math|4''k'' + 3}}. This is generalized by [[Waring's problem]].\n\nIn [[base 10]], a square number can end only with digits 0, 1,\u2009 4, \u20095, 6 or\u2009 9, as follows:\n\n* if the last digit of a number is 0, its square ends in 0 (in fact, the last two digits must be 00);\n* if the last digit of a number is 1 or 9, its square ends in 1;\n* if the last digit of a number is 2 or 8, its square ends in 4;\n* if the last digit of a number is 3 or 7, its square ends in 9;\n* if the last digit of a number is 4 or 6, its square ends in 6; and\n* if the last digit of a number is 5, its square ends in 5 (in fact, the last two digits must be 25).\n\nIn [[base 12]], a square number can end only with square digits (like in base 12, a [[prime number]] can end only with prime digits or 1), i.e. 0, 1, 4 or 9, as follows:\n\n* if a number is divisible both by 2 and by 3 (i.e. divisible by 6), its square ends in 0;\n* if a number is divisible neither by 2 nor by 3, its square ends in 1;\n* if a number is divisible by 2, but not by 3, its square ends in 4; and\n* if a number is not divisible by 2, but by 3, its square ends in 9.\n\nSimilar rules can be given for other bases, or for earlier digits (the tens instead of the units digit, for example).{{cn|date=March 2016}}  All such rules can be proved by checking a fixed number of cases and using [[modular arithmetic]].\n\nIn general, if a [[prime]]&nbsp;{{mvar|p}} divides a square number&nbsp;{{mvar|m}} then the square of {{mvar|p}} must also divide {{mvar|m}}; if {{mvar|p}} fails to divide {{math|{{sfrac|''m''|''p''}}}}, then {{mvar|m}} is definitely not square. Repeating the divisions of the previous sentence, one concludes that every prime must divide a given perfect square an even number of times (including possibly 0 times). Thus, the number {{mvar|m}} is a square number if and only if, in its [[canonical representation of a positive integer|canonical representation]], all exponents are even.\n\nSquarity testing can be used as alternative way in [[factorization]] of large numbers. Instead of testing for divisibility, test for squarity: for given {{mvar|m}} and some number&nbsp;{{mvar|k}}, if {{math|''k''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''m''}} is the square of an integer&nbsp;{{mvar|n}} then {{math|''k'' \u2212 ''n''}} divides {{mvar|m}}. (This is an application of the factorization of a [[difference of two squares]].) For example, {{math|100<sup>2</sup> \u2212 9991}} is the square of 3, so consequently {{math|100 \u2212 3}} divides 9991. This test is deterministic for odd divisors in the range from {{math|''k'' \u2212 ''n''}} to {{math|''k'' + ''n''}} where {{mvar|k}} covers some range of natural numbers {{math|''k'' \u2265 {{sqrt|''m''}}}}.\n\nA square number cannot be a [[perfect number]].\n\nThe sum  of the ''n'' first square numbers is\n: <math>\\sum_{n=0}^N n^2 = 0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + \\cdots + N^2 = \\frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6}.</math>\nThe first values of these sums, the [[square pyramidal number]]s, are: {{OEIS|id=A000330}}\n<blockquote>\n0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, 91, 140, 204, 285, 385, 506, 650, 819, 1015, 1240, 1496, 1785, 2109, 2470, 2870, 3311, 3795, 4324, 4900, 5525, 6201...\n</blockquote>\nThe sum of the first odd integers, beginning with one, is a perfect square: 1, 1 + 3, 1 + 3 + 5, 1 + 3 + 5 + 7, etc.\n\nThe sum of the ''n'' first [[cube (algebra)|cubes]] is the square of the sum of the ''n'' first positive integers; this is [[Nicomachus's theorem]].\n\nAll fourth powers, sixth powers, eighth powers and so on are perfect squares.\n\n==Odd and even square numbers== <!-- This section is linked from [[Irrational number]] -->\n\nSquares of even numbers are even (and in fact divisible by 4), since {{math|1=(2''n'')<sup>2</sup> = 4''n''<sup>2</sup>}}.\n\nSquares of odd numbers are odd, since {{math|1=(2''n'' + 1)<sup>2</sup> = 4(''n''<sup>2</sup> + ''n'') + 1}}.\n\nIt follows that square roots of even square numbers are even, and square roots of odd square numbers are odd.\n\nAs all even square numbers are divisible by 4, the even numbers of the form {{math|4''n'' + 2}} are not square numbers.\n\nAs all odd square numbers are of the form {{math|4''n'' + 1}}, the odd numbers of the form {{math|4''n'' + 3}} are not square numbers.\n\nSquares of odd numbers are of the form {{math|8''n'' + 1}}, since {{math|1=(2''n'' + 1)<sup>2</sup> = 4''n''(''n'' + 1) + 1}} and {{math|1=''n''(''n'' + 1)}} is an even number.\n\nEvery odd perfect square is a [[centered octagonal number]]. The difference between any two odd perfect squares is a multiple of 8. The difference between 1 and any higher odd perfect square always is eight times a triangular number, while the difference between 9 and any higher odd perfect square is eight times a triangular number minus eight. Since all triangular numbers have an odd factor, but no two values of {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup>}} differ by an amount containing an odd factor, the only perfect square of the form {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1}} is 1, and the only perfect square of the form {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup> + 1}} is 9.\n\n==Special cases==\n* If the number is of the form {{math|''m''5}} where {{math|''m''}} represents the preceding digits, its square is {{math|''n''25}} where {{math|1=''n'' = ''m''(''m'' + 1)}} and represents digits before 25. For example, the square of 65 can be calculated by {{math|1=''n'' = 6 \u00d7 (6 + 1) = 42}} which makes the square equal to 4225.\n* If the number is of the form {{math|''m''0}} where {{math|''m''}} represents the preceding digits, its square is {{math|''n''00}} where {{math|1=''n'' = ''m''<sup>2</sup>}}. For example, the square of 70 is 4900.\n* If the number has two digits and is of the form {{math|5''m''}} where {{math|''m''}} represents the units digit, its square is {{math|''aabb''}} where {{math|1=''aa'' = 25 + ''m''}} and {{math|1=''bb'' = ''m''<sup>2</sup>}}. Example: To calculate the square of 57, 25&nbsp;+&nbsp;7&nbsp;=&nbsp;32 and 7<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;49, which means 57<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3249.\n* If the number ends in 5, its square will end in 5; similarly for ending in 25, 625, 0625, 90625, ... 8212890625, etc. If the number ends in 6, its square will end in 6, similarly for ending in 76, 376, 9376, 09376, ... 1787109376. For example, the square of 55376 is 3066501376, both ending in ''376''. (The numbers 5, 6, 25, 76, etc. are called [[automorphic number]]s. They are sequence A003226 in the [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|OEIS]].<ref>{{Cite OEIS|1=A003226|2=Automorphic numbers: n^2 ends with n.}}</ref>)\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Brahmagupta\u2013Fibonacci identity}}\n* {{annotated link|Cubic number}}\n* {{annotated link|Euler's four-square identity}}\n* {{annotated link|Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares}}\n* [[Square (algebra)#Related identities|Some identities involving several squares]]\n* {{annotated link|Integer square root}}\n* {{annotated link|Methods of computing square roots}}\n* {{annotated link|Polygonal number}}\n* {{annotated link|Power of two}}\n* {{annotated link|Pythagorean triple}}\n* {{annotated link|Quadratic residue}}\n* {{annotated link|Quadratic function}}\n* {{annotated link|Square triangular number}}\n* {{annotated link|Wallis sieve}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[J.H.

Instead of being built upon natural terrain, dirt was imported into the stadiums where promoters tried to emulate the motocross tracks. In 1972 Mike Goodwin and Terry Tiernan, the president of the AMA, put on one of these stadium races in the Los Angeles Coliseum. The race was dubbed as the Super Bowl of Motocross. Eventually this form of racing evolved into its own sport and series with the name Supercross which was a shortening of the original \"Super Bowl of Motocross\". American motocross racing distinguished itself from European motocross by having two different season championships run each year for each class both sanctioned by the AMA. Currently{{When|date=March 2017}} the AMA runs their 17-round Supercross championship from the first weekend in January to the first weekend in May and then the 12-round outdoor Motocross championship from mid-May through late August. \n\nWhereas AMA Motocross is two 30-minute plus 2 lap motos per each round with the winner being the rider with the highest combined points total for the two motos, in Supercross there is only one points-paying race per round. Around 40 riders qualify for each Supercross round. Heat races and LCQs are used to bring the field down to 22 riders for a points-paying main event for each round. A main event is 20 minutes plus 1 lap for the 450 class and 15 minutes plus 1 lap for the 250 class. There is no 250 Supercross national champion like there is for motocross. The 250 class in Supercross is split into East and West divisional rounds with an All Star race combining the top riders of each division at the final round in Las Vegas.\n\n==AMA Motocross and Supercross champions==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

As motocross technology developed, 500&nbsp;cc [[two-stroke]] motocross bikes became too powerful for the average rider and, faced with diminishing numbers of competitors, the A.M.A. discontinued the 500&nbsp;cc class after the 1993 season. A women's national championship series was introduced in 1996.<ref name=\"Women's Motocross National Champions\">{{cite web |url=http://www.trpro.com/WMA/history.shtml |title=Women's Motocross National |publisher=Women's Motocross Association |accessdate=October 2, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nDue to the low relative power output of a four stroke engine, compared to the then-dominating two stroke design, the A.M.A. had increased the allowable displacement capacity for [[four-stroke]] engines. By 1994, the displacement limit of a four stroke power motocross bike was up to 550cc in the 250 class, to incentivize manufactures to further develop the design for use in motocross.  <ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_YDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA28&dq=american+motorcyclist+motocross+history&hl=en&ei=OM2nTKuGEsP38Ab5udCsDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Counting Strokes |publisher=Books.Google.com |date=June 1997 |work=American Motorcyclist |accessdate=October 2, 2010 }}</ref> \n\nIn 2006, the 250&nbsp;cc division was renamed the MX Class, with an engine formula allowing for 150\u2013250&nbsp;cc two-stroke or 250\u2013450&nbsp;cc four-stroke machines.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://admin.amaproracing.com/assets/MX_Rules_2009.pdf | format= PDF | title= Motocross Rule Book | publisher= AMA | accessdate= March 15, 2010}}</ref> The 125&nbsp;cc class was renamed the MX Lites Class, allowing 0\u2013125&nbsp;cc two-stroke or 150\u2013250&nbsp;cc four-stroke engines.

Instead of being built upon natural terrain, dirt was imported into the stadiums where promoters tried to emulate the motocross tracks. In 1972 Mike Goodwin and Terry Tiernan, the president of the AMA, put on one of these stadium races in the Los Angeles Coliseum. The race was dubbed as the Super Bowl of Motocross. Eventually this form of racing evolved into its own sport and series with the name Supercross which was a shortening of the original \"Super Bowl of Motocross\". American motocross racing distinguished itself from European motocross by having two different season championships run each year for each class both sanctioned by the AMA. Currently{{When|date=March 2017}} the AMA runs their 17-round Supercross championship from the first weekend in January to the first weekend in May and then the 12-round outdoor Motocross championship from mid-May through late August. \n\nWhereas AMA Motocross is two 30-minute plus 2 lap motos per each round with the winner being the rider with the highest combined points total for the two motos, in Supercross there is only one points-paying race per round. Around 40 riders qualify for each Supercross round. Heat races and LCQs are used to bring the field down to 22 riders for a points-paying main event for each round. A main event is 20 minutes plus 1 lap for the 450 class and 15 minutes plus 1 lap for the 250 class. There is no 250 Supercross national champion like there is for motocross. The 250 class in Supercross is split into East and West divisional rounds with an All Star race combining the top riders of each division at the final round in Las Vegas.\n\n==AMA Motocross and Supercross champions==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The scholar Andrew Major notes that the large-scale abduction and rape of girls seemed to have been a part of systematic '[[ethnic cleansing]]' in the [[Gurgaon]] region on the outskirts of [[Delhi]].{{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=61}} There was a nude procession of Muslim women near the Golden Temple in [[Amritsar]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ian Talbot|author2=Gurharpal Singh|title=The Partition of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-13aHAAACAAJ|date=23 July 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85661-4|page=68}}</ref>\n\nAlthough many influential men such as deputy commissioners and police officials tried to prevent abductions or rescue the victims many other men abused their positions of authority such as the Maharaja of [[Patiala State|Patiala]] who was holding a Muslim girl from a reputable family. Known perpetrators included police officials, landed magnates and Muslim League members as well as criminal elements. Armed Pathans in particular were considered the worst offenders, particularly in the Rawalpindi district. The Pathans abducted a large number of non-Muslim women from Kashmir and sold them in West Punjab and these sold women often ended up as 'slave girls' in factories. By early 1948, Pathans started abducting even Muslim women.{{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=62}}\n\nIn East Punjab, local police and the Indian military frequently engaged in the abduction and distribution of Muslim women besides the Sikh jathas and refugees from West Punjab. According to Anis Kidwai, the 'better stuff' would be distributed among the police and army while the remaining were distributed among the rest of the attackers.{{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=63}} In the villages around Delhi, police and army soldiers participated in the rape of Muslim women.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/lr/2004/06/06/stories/2004060600220300.htm|title=The Hindu : Do women have a country?|website=The Hindu|access-date=2017-05-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Estimates of abductions ===\nThe exact figures of abducted women are unknown and estimates vary. Leonard Mosley wrote that in total 100,000 girls were abducted on all sides. The Indian government estimated that there were 33,000 Hindu and Sikh women in Pakistan and the Pakistani government estimated that there were 50,000 Muslim women abducted in India.{{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=68-69}} Andrew Major estimates that 40-45,000 women in total were abducted during the Partition riots, with approximately twice as many Muslim women as Hindu and Sikh women having been abducted.{{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=69}} Masroor estimates that 60,000 Muslim women were abducted while Begum Tassaduq Hussain estimated that 90,000 Muslim women were abducted.{{sfn|Kiran, Violence against Muslim Women|2017|page=163}}\n\n== Recoveries ==\n\nIn September 1947 both the Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] and Pakistani Prime Minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] vowed not to recognise the forced marriages and both countries ratified this agreement in the Inter-Dominion Conference in December which established the recovery procedure.{{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=64-65}}\n\nThe job of compiling claims for abducted women by their relatives fell on the Central Recovery Offices in both countries. The task of locating abducted women was given to local police who would be assisted with the guidance of the abducted women's relatives. Social workers and District Liaison Officers who were appointed by the Liaison Agency of the opposite Punjab government also provided much assistance. Non-Muslim women recovered from Pakistan were housed in District transit camps, the Central camp being in Lahore. A similar camp was established for Muslim women in Jalandhar. The Indian and Pakistani Military Evacuation Organisations were established to guard and escort women to their respective countries.{{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=64-65}}\n\nRecoveries eventually slowed down with Nehru admitting in January 1948, \"Neither side has really tried hard enough to recover them\". Because Hindu and Sikh refugees in India mistakenly thought that the number of abducted non-Muslim women exceeded the number of abducted Muslim women they mounted a public campaign and demanded that Muslim women be held up from recoveries as hostages. Eventually the two countries agreed to not publicize the figures of women repatriated. India and Pakistan's rivalry also slowed the pace of recoveries.{{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=65}}\n\nPakistan claimed that the slow recoveries were because many Hindus refused to take back their women as they considered them 'defiled', an argument which Nehru accepted while accusing Pakistan of being uncooperative. Heavy rains and flooding also slowened the pace of recoveries in West Punjab and in January 1948 Pakistan prohibited Indian officials from entering those districts of Punjab which bordered Kashmir. {{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=66}}\n\nMany women also refused to be recovered, fearing being shamed and rejected by their families and communities while some women had adjusted to their new 'families' and hence refused to return. By 1954 both governments agreed that women should not be forcibly repatriated.{{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=67-68}}\n\n=== Number of recoveries ===\nBetween December 1947 and December 1949, 6000 females were recovered from Pakistan and 12,000 from India. Most recoveries were made, in order of succession, from East and West Punjab, Jammu, Kashmir and Patiala. Over the eight-year period 30,000 women had been repatriated by both governments. The number of Muslim women recovered was significantly higher; 20,728 against 9,032 non-Muslim women. Most recoveries were made in the period between 1947 and 1952. although some recoveries were made as late as 1956.<ref name=\"D'Costa2016\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TGmDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA24|title=Children and Violence: Politics of Conflict in South Asia|date=4 October 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-67399-7|pages=24\u2013|author=Bina D'Costa}}</ref>\n\nBetween 6 December 1947 and 31 March 1952, the number of non-Muslim women recovered from Pakistan was 8,326. 5,616 of them were from Punjab, 459 from NWFP, 10 from Balochistan, 56 from Sind and 592 from Bahawalpur.

The scholar Andrew Major notes that the large-scale abduction and rape of girls seemed to have been a part of systematic '[[ethnic cleansing]]' in the [[Gurgaon]] region on the outskirts of [[Delhi]].{{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=61}} There was a nude procession of Muslim women near the Golden Temple in [[Amritsar]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ian Talbot|author2=Gurharpal Singh|title=The Partition of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-13aHAAACAAJ|date=23 July 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85661-4|page=68}}</ref>\n\nAlthough many influential men such as deputy commissioners and police officials tried to prevent abductions or rescue the victims many other men abused their positions of authority such as the Maharaja of [[Patiala State|Patiala]] who was holding a Muslim girl from a reputable family. Known perpetrators included police officials, landed magnates and Muslim League members as well as criminal elements. Armed Pathans in particular were considered the worst offenders, particularly in the Rawalpindi district. The Pathans abducted a large number of non-Muslim women from Kashmir and sold them in West Punjab and these sold women often ended up as 'slave girls' in factories. By early 1948, Pathans started abducting even Muslim women.{{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=62}}\n\nIn East Punjab, local police and the Indian military frequently engaged in the abduction and distribution of Muslim women besides the Sikh jathas and refugees from West Punjab. According to Anis Kidwai, the 'better stuff' would be distributed among the police and army while the remaining were distributed among the rest of the attackers.{{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=63}} In the villages around Delhi, police and army soldiers participated in the rape of Muslim women.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/lr/2004/06/06/stories/2004060600220300.htm|title=The Hindu : Do women have a country?|website=The Hindu|access-date=2017-05-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Estimates of abductions ===\nThe exact figures of abducted women are unknown and estimates vary. Leonard Mosley wrote that in total 100,000 girls were abducted on all sides. The Indian government estimated that there were 33,000 Hindu and Sikh women in Pakistan and the Pakistani government estimated that there were 50,000 Muslim women abducted in India.{{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=68-69}} Andrew Major estimates that 40-45,000 women in total were abducted during the Partition riots, with approximately twice as many Muslim women as Hindu and Sikh women having been abducted.{{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=69}} Masroor estimates that 60,000 Muslim women were abducted while Begum Tassaduq Hussain estimated that 90,000 Muslim women were abducted.{{sfn|Kiran, Violence against Muslim Women|2017|page=163}}\n\n== Recoveries ==\n\nIn September 1947 both the Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] and Pakistani Prime Minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] vowed not to recognise the forced marriages and both countries ratified this agreement in the Inter-Dominion Conference in December which established the recovery procedure.{{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=64-65}}\n\nThe job of compiling claims for abducted women by their relatives fell on the Central Recovery Offices in both countries. The task of locating abducted women was given to local police who would be assisted with the guidance of the abducted women's relatives. Social workers and District Liaison Officers who were appointed by the Liaison Agency of the opposite Punjab government also provided much assistance. Non-Muslim women recovered from Pakistan were housed in District transit camps, the Central camp being in Lahore. A similar camp was established for Muslim women in Jalandhar. The Indian and Pakistani Military Evacuation Organisations were established to guard and escort women to their respective countries.{{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=64-65}}\n\nRecoveries eventually slowed down with Nehru admitting in January 1948, \"Neither side has really tried hard enough to recover them\". Because Hindu and Sikh refugees in India mistakenly thought that the number of abducted non-Muslim women exceeded the number of abducted Muslim women they mounted a public campaign and demanded that Muslim women be held up from recoveries as hostages. Eventually the two countries agreed to not publicize the figures of women repatriated. India and Pakistan's rivalry also slowed the pace of recoveries.{{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=65}}\n\nPakistan claimed that the slow recoveries were because many Hindus refused to take back their women as they considered them 'defiled', an argument which Nehru accepted while accusing Pakistan of being uncooperative. Heavy rains and flooding also slowened the pace of recoveries in West Punjab and in January 1948 Pakistan prohibited Indian officials from entering those districts of Punjab which bordered Kashmir. {{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=66}}\n\nMany women also refused to be recovered, fearing being shamed and rejected by their families and communities while some women had adjusted to their new 'families' and hence refused to return. By 1954 both governments agreed that women should not be forcibly repatriated.{{sfn|Major, Abduction of women during the partition of the Punjab|1995|pages=67-68}}\n\n=== Number of recoveries ===\nBetween December 1947 and December 1949, 6000 females were recovered from Pakistan and 12,000 from India. Most recoveries were made, in order of succession, from East and West Punjab, Jammu, Kashmir and Patiala. Over the eight-year period 30,000 women had been repatriated by both governments. The number of Muslim women recovered was significantly higher; 20,728 against 9,032 non-Muslim women. Most recoveries were made in the period between 1947 and 1952. although some recoveries were made as late as 1956.<ref name=\"D'Costa2016\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TGmDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA24|title=Children and Violence: Politics of Conflict in South Asia|date=4 October 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-67399-7|pages=24\u2013|author=Bina D'Costa}}</ref>\n\nBetween 6 December 1947 and 31 March 1952, the number of non-Muslim women recovered from Pakistan was 8,326. 5,616 of them were from Punjab, 459 from NWFP, 10 from Balochistan, 56 from Sind and 592 from Bahawalpur.
