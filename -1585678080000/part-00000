Literary historian [[J. A. Cuddon]] defined the horror story as \"a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks, or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing\".<ref>{{cite book |first=J.A. |last=Cuddon |chapter=Introduction |title=The Penguin Book of Horror Stories |location=Harmondsworth |publisher=Penguin |year=1984 |isbn=0-14-006799-X |page=[https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_y1e0/page/11 11] |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_y1e0/page/11 }}</ref> It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it might be also non-supernatural. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a [[metaphor]] for the larger [[fear]]s of a society.\n\n==History==\n===Horror in ancient Greece and Rome===\n[[File:Athenodorus - The Greek Stoic Philosopher Athenodorus Rents a Haunted House.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Athenodorus and the ghost, by [[Henry Justice Ford]], c.1900|Athenodorus]] \n\nThe horror genre has ancient origins with roots in folklore and religious traditions, focusing on death, the afterlife, evil, the demonic and the principle of the thing embodied in the person.<ref>{{cite book|first=Rosemary|last=Jackson |year=1981|title=Fantasy: The Literature of Subversion|publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]]|place=London|pages=53\u20135, 68\u20139}}</ref> These were manifested in stories of beings such as [[demon]]s, [[witches]], [[vampire]]s, [[Werewolf|werewolves]] and [[ghost]]s. European horror fiction became established through works of the [[Ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Romans]]. The well-known 19th-century novel about [[Frankenstein]] was greatly influenced by the story of [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]], where [[Asclepius]] revives him from death.<ref>Though the sub-title of ''Frankenstein'' references the titan Prometheus, none of the ancient myths about him is itself a horror tale.</ref> [[Euripides]] wrote plays based on the story, ''Hippolytos Kalyptomenos'' and ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]''.<ref>* Edward P.

One of [[Marie de France]]'s twelve [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]]s is a werewolf story titled \"[[Bisclavret]]\". \n[[File:Vlad Tepes coloured drawing.png|thumb|left|upright|alt=A Print of Vlad III|Vlad III]]\nThe Countess Yolande commissioned a [[werewolf]] story titled \"[[Guillaume de Palerme]]\". Anonymous writers penned two werewolf stories, \"Biclarel\" and \"[[Melion]]\".\n\nMuch horror fiction derives from the cruellest personages of the 15th century. [[Dracula]] can be traced to the Prince of [[Wallachia]] [[Vlad III]], whose alleged [[war crimes]] were published in [[German language|German]] pamphlets. A 1499 pamphlet was published by Markus Ayrer, which is most notable for its [[woodcut]] imagery.<ref>Raymond T. McNally and Radu R. Florescu (1972). \"In Search of Dracula.\" Houghton Milton.

It drew on the written and material heritage of the Late Middle Ages, finding its form with [[Horace Walpole]]'s seminal and controversial 1764 novel, ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]''. In fact, the first edition was published disguised as an actual medieval romance from Italy, discovered and republished by a fictitious translator.<ref name=\"Walpole\"/> Once revealed as modern, many found it [[anachronism|anachronistic]], [[reactionary]], or simply in poor taste but it proved immediately popular.<ref name=\"Walpole\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30313775 \"The Castle of Otranto: The creepy tale that launched gothic fiction\"].

Influential works and characters that continue resonating in fiction and film today saw their genesis in the [[Brothers Grimm]]'s \"[[H\u00e4nsel und Gretel]]\" (1812), [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), [[John William Polidori|John Polodori]]'s \"[[The Vampyre]]\" (1819), [[Charles Maturin]]'s ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'' (1820), [[Washington Irving]]'s \"[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]\" (1820), [[Jane C.

G. Wells]]' ''[[The Invisible Man]]'' (1897), and [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897). Each of these works created an enduring icon of horror seen in later re-imaginings on the page, stage and screen.<ref>{{cite book |author=Christopher Frayling |year=1996|title=''Nightmare: The Birth of Horror''|place=London|publisher=BBC Books}}</ref>\n\n===Horror in the 20th century===\nA proliferation of cheap periodicals around turn of the century led to a boom in horror writing. For example, [[Gaston Leroux]] serialized his ''[[Le Fant\u00f4me de l'Op\u00e9ra]]'' before it became a novel in 1910. One writer who specialized in horror fiction for mainstream pulps, such as ''[[Argosy (magazine)|All-Story Magazine]],'' was [[Tod Robbins]], whose fiction deals with themes of madness and cruelty.<ref>[[Brian Stableford]], \"Robbins, Tod\", in [[David Pringle]], ed., ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost & Gothic Writers'' (London: St. James Press, 1998) {{ISBN|1558622063}} (pp. 480\u20131).</ref><ref>[[Lee Server]].

Particularly, the venerated horror author [[H. P. Lovecraft|H.P. Lovecraft]], and his enduring [[Cthulhu Mythos]] transformed and popularized the genre of [[cosmic horror]], and [[M. R. James|M.R.

[[Yellow journalism]] and [[sensationalism]] of various murderers, such as [[Jack the Ripper]], and lesser so, [[Carl Panzram]], [[Fritz Haarman]], and [[Albert Fish]], all perpetuated this phenomenon. The trend continued in the postwar era, partly renewed after the murders committed by [[Ed Gein]]. In 1959, [[Robert Bloch]], inspired by the murders, wrote ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]''. The crimes committed in 1969 by the [[Manson family]] influenced the slasher theme in horror fiction of the 1970s. In 1981, [[Thomas Harris]] wrote ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'', introducing [[Dr. Hannibal Lecter]]. In 1988, the sequel to that novel, ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', was published.\n\nEarly cinema was inspired by many aspects of horror literature, and started a strong tradition of [[horror film]]s and subgenres that continues to this day. Up until the graphic depictions of violence and gore on the screen commonly associated with 1960s and 1970s [[slasher film]]s and [[splatter film]]s, [[comic books]] such as those published by [[EC Comics]] (most notably ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales From The Crypt]]'') in the 1950s satisfied readers' quests for horror imagery that the [[silver screen]] could not provide.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hutchings|first1=Peter|title=The A to Z of Horror Cinema|series=The A to Z Guide Series|volume=100|year=2008|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-8108-6887-8|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_5DPHOVG7YC|accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref> This imagery made these comics controversial, and as a consequence, they were frequently censored.<ref>[[Collins, Max Allan]] (28 February 2013).

[[Richard Matheson]]'s novel ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]'' (1954) influenced an entire genre of apocalyptic zombie fiction emblematized by the films of [[George A.

Horror elements continue to expand outside the genre. The [[alternate history]] of more traditional historical horror in [[Dan Simmons]]'s 2007 novel ''[[The Terror (novel)|The Terror]]'' sits on bookstore shelves next to genre [[Mashup (book)|mash up]]s such as ''[[Pride and Prejudice and Zombies]]'' (2009), and [[historical fantasy]] and [[horror comics]] such as ''[[Hellblazer]]'' (1993 onward) and [[Mike Mignola]]'s [[Hellboy]] (1993 onward). Horror also serves as one of the central genres in more complex modern works such as [[Mark Z. Danielewski]]'s ''[[House of Leaves]]'' (2000), a finalist for the [[National Book Award]]. There are many horror novels for teens, such as ''[[The Monstrumologist]]'' by [[Rick Yancey]] (2009). Additionally, many movies, particularly animated ones, use a horror aesthetic. These are what can be collectively referred to as \"children's horror\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Lester|first=Catherine|date=Fall 2016|title=The Children's Horror Film|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/628733|journal=The Velvet Light Trap |volume=78|issue=78|pages=22\u201337|doi=10.7560/VLT7803|via=}}</ref> Although it's unknown for sure why children enjoy these movies (as it seems counter-intuitive), it is theorized that it is the grotesque monsters that fascinate kids.<ref name=\":0\" /> Tangential to this, the internalized impact of horror television programs and films on children is rather under-researched, especially when compared to the research done on the similar subject of violence in TV and film's impact on the young mind.

One of H.P. Lovecraft's most famous quotes about the genre is that: \"The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldenproverbs.com/au_lovecraft.html|title=Golden Proverbs|accessdate = 15 December 2012}}</ref> the first sentence from his seminal essay, \"[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]\". Science fiction historian [[Darrell Schweitzer]] has stated \"In the simplest sense, a horror story is one that scares us\" and \"the true horror story requires a sense of evil, not in necessarily in a theological sense; but the menaces must be truly menacing, life-destroying, and antithetical to happiness.\"<ref>Schweitzer, Darrell, \"Why Horror Fiction?\" in ''Windows of the Imagination''.  Berkeley Heights, NJ : Wildside Press, 1999. {{ISBN|9781880448601}} (p. 64, 67).</ref> \n\nIn her essay \"Elements of Aversion\", Elizabeth Barrette articulates the need by some for horror tales in a modern world:\n{{quote|text=The old \"fight or flight\" reaction of our evolutionary heritage once played a major role in the life of every human. Our ancestors lived and died by it. Then someone invented the fascinating game of civilization, and things began to calm down. Development pushed wilderness back from settled lands. War, crime, and other forms of social violence came with civilization and humans started preying on each other, but by and large daily life calmed down. We began to feel restless, to feel something missing: the excitement of living on the edge, the tension between hunter and hunted. So we told each other stories through the long, dark nights. when the fires burned low, we did our best to scare the daylights out of each other. The rush of adrenaline feels good. Our hearts pound, our breath quickens, and we can imagine ourselves on the edge. Yet we also appreciate the insightful aspects of horror. Sometimes a story intends to shock and disgust, but the best horror intends to rattle our cages and shake us out of our complacency. It makes us think, forces us to confront ideas we might rather ignore, and challenges preconceptions of all kinds. Horror reminds us that the world is not always as safe as it seems, which exercises our mental muscles and reminds us to keep a little healthy caution close at hand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://horror.fictionfactor.com/articles/aversion.html |title=Elements of Aversion |accessdate=2 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228210354/http://horror.fictionfactor.com/articles/aversion.html |archive-date=28 February 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nIn a sense similar to the reason a person seeks out the controlled thrill of a [[roller coaster]], readers in the modern era seek out feelings of horror and terror to feel a sense of excitement. However, Barrette adds that horror fiction is one of the few mediums where readers seek out a form of art that forces themselves to confront ideas and images they \"might rather ignore to challenge preconceptions of all kinds.\"\n\nOne can see the confrontation of ideas that readers and characters would \"rather ignore\" throughout literature in famous moments such as [[Hamlet]]'s musings about the skull of [[Yorick]], its implications of the mortality of humanity, and the gruesome end that bodies inevitably come to. In horror fiction, the confrontation with the gruesome is often a [[metaphor]] for the problems facing the current generation of the author.\n\nThere are many theories as to why people enjoy being scared. For example, \"people who like horror films are more likely to score highly for openness to experience, a personality trait linked to intellect and imagination.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The benefits of being scared|issue=3216|pages=8|journal=New Scientist|volume=241|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(19)30224-6|date=9 February 2019|last1=Whyte|first1=Chelsea}}</ref>\n\nStephanie Demetrakopoulos illustrates a common interpretation of one of the benchmarks of the canon of horror literature.<ref name=\"Demetrakopoulos\">{{cite journal|title=Feminism, Sex Role Exchanges, and Other Subliminal Fantasies in Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\"\n|author=Stephanie Demetrakopoulos\n|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies\n|volume= 2|issue= 3|date=Autumn 1977|pages= 104\u2013113|publisher= University of Nebraska Press\n|jstor=3346355|doi=10.2307/3346355\n}}</ref> Tina Broussard in an [[Horror Stories - Ghost Stories]] of [[Dracula]] surmises Demetrakopoulos' thesis:\n\n{{quote|text=This scholarly journal article explores sexuality in ''Dracula'', including overtones of sexuality in the typical aggressive male and female sexuality which is either reflective of the chaste woman or the sexually aggressive female vampire.

In 1826, the gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe published an essay distinguishing two elements of horror fiction, \"terror\" and \"horror.\" Whereas terror is a feeling of dread that takes place before an event happens, horror is a feeling of revulsion or disgust after an event has happened.<ref>[[Ann Radcliffe|Mrs Radcliffe]], \"[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KMg2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA145#v=onepage&q&f=false On the Supernatural in Poetry]\", ''[[The New Monthly Magazine]]'' 7 (1826): 145\u201352.</ref> Radcliffe describes terror as that which \"expands the soul and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life,\" whereas horror is described as that which \"freezes and nearly annihilates them.\"\n\nModern scholarship on horror fiction draws upon a range of sources. In their historical studies of the gothic novel, both Devandra Varma<ref>Devandra Varma, ''The Gothic Flame'' (New York: Russell & Russell, 1966.</ref> and S.L. Varnado<ref>S.L. Varnado, \"The Idea of the Numinous in Gothic Literature,\" in The Gothic Imagination, ed. G.R. Thompson (Pullman: Washington State University Press, 1974).</ref> make reference to the theologian [[Rudolf Otto]], whose concept of the \"[[numinous]]\" was originally used to describe religious experience.\n\nA recent survey reports how often horror media is consumed:<blockquote>To assess frequency of horror consumption, we asked respondents the following question: \u201cIn the past year, about how often have you used horror media (e.g., horror literature, film, and video games) for entertainment?\u201d 11.3% said \u201cNever,\u201d 7.5% \u201cOnce,\u201d 28.9% \u201cSeveral times,\u201d 14.1% \u201cOnce a month,\u201d 20.8% \u201cSeveral times a month,\u201d 7.3% \u201cOnce a week,\u201d and 10.2% \u201cSeveral times a week.\u201d Evidently, then, most respondents (81.3%) claimed to use horror media several times a year or more often. Unsurprisingly, there is a strong correlation between liking and frequency of use (r=.79, p<.0001).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329200207|title=Horror, Personality, and Threat Simulation: A Survey on the Psychology of Scary Media {{!}} Request PDF|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n==Awards and associations==\nAchievements in horror fiction are recognized by numerous awards.

Horror is frequently supernatural, though it might be also non-supernatural. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a [[metaphor]] for the larger [[fear]]s of a society.\n\n==History==\n===Horror in ancient Greece and Rome===\n[[File:Athenodorus - The Greek Stoic Philosopher Athenodorus Rents a Haunted House.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Athenodorus and the ghost, by [[Henry Justice Ford]], c.1900|Athenodorus]] \n\nThe horror genre has ancient origins with roots in folklore and religious traditions, focusing on death, the afterlife, evil, the demonic and the principle of the thing embodied in the person.<ref>{{cite book|first=Rosemary|last=Jackson |year=1981|title=Fantasy: The Literature of Subversion|publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]]|place=London|pages=53\u20135, 68\u20139}}</ref> These were manifested in stories of beings such as [[demon]]s, [[witches]], [[vampire]]s, [[Werewolf|werewolves]] and [[ghost]]s. European horror fiction became established through works of the [[Ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Romans]]. The well-known 19th-century novel about [[Frankenstein]] was greatly influenced by the story of [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]], where [[Asclepius]] revives him from death.<ref>Though the sub-title of ''Frankenstein'' references the titan Prometheus, none of the ancient myths about him is itself a horror tale.</ref> [[Euripides]] wrote plays based on the story, ''Hippolytos Kalyptomenos'' and ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]''.<ref>* Edward P.

Collier & Son.</ref>\n\n===Horror after AD 1000===\n\n[[Werewolf]] stories were popular in medieval [[French literature]]. One of [[Marie de France]]'s twelve [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]]s is a werewolf story titled \"[[Bisclavret]]\". \n[[File:Vlad Tepes coloured drawing.png|thumb|left|upright|alt=A Print of Vlad III|Vlad III]]\nThe Countess Yolande commissioned a [[werewolf]] story titled \"[[Guillaume de Palerme]]\". Anonymous writers penned two werewolf stories, \"Biclarel\" and \"[[Melion]]\".\n\nMuch horror fiction derives from the cruellest personages of the 15th century. [[Dracula]] can be traced to the Prince of [[Wallachia]] [[Vlad III]], whose alleged [[war crimes]] were published in [[German language|German]] pamphlets. A 1499 pamphlet was published by Markus Ayrer, which is most notable for its [[woodcut]] imagery.<ref>Raymond T. McNally and Radu R. Florescu (1972). \"In Search of Dracula.\" Houghton Milton.

It drew on the written and material heritage of the Late Middle Ages, finding its form with [[Horace Walpole]]'s seminal and controversial 1764 novel, ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]''. In fact, the first edition was published disguised as an actual medieval romance from Italy, discovered and republished by a fictitious translator.<ref name=\"Walpole\"/> Once revealed as modern, many found it [[anachronism|anachronistic]], [[reactionary]], or simply in poor taste but it proved immediately popular.<ref name=\"Walpole\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30313775 \"The Castle of Otranto: The creepy tale that launched gothic fiction\"].

Influential works and characters that continue resonating in fiction and film today saw their genesis in the [[Brothers Grimm]]'s \"[[H\u00e4nsel und Gretel]]\" (1812), [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), [[John William Polidori|John Polodori]]'s \"[[The Vampyre]]\" (1819), [[Charles Maturin]]'s ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'' (1820), [[Washington Irving]]'s \"[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]\" (1820), [[Jane C.

G. Wells]]' ''[[The Invisible Man]]'' (1897), and [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897). Each of these works created an enduring icon of horror seen in later re-imaginings on the page, stage and screen.<ref>{{cite book |author=Christopher Frayling |year=1996|title=''Nightmare: The Birth of Horror''|place=London|publisher=BBC Books}}</ref>\n\n===Horror in the 20th century===\nA proliferation of cheap periodicals around turn of the century led to a boom in horror writing. For example, [[Gaston Leroux]] serialized his ''[[Le Fant\u00f4me de l'Op\u00e9ra]]'' before it became a novel in 1910. One writer who specialized in horror fiction for mainstream pulps, such as ''[[Argosy (magazine)|All-Story Magazine]],'' was [[Tod Robbins]], whose fiction deals with themes of madness and cruelty.<ref>[[Brian Stableford]], \"Robbins, Tod\", in [[David Pringle]], ed., ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost & Gothic Writers'' (London: St. James Press, 1998) {{ISBN|1558622063}} (pp. 480\u20131).</ref><ref>[[Lee Server]].

Particularly, the venerated horror author [[H. P. Lovecraft|H.P. Lovecraft]], and his enduring [[Cthulhu Mythos]] transformed and popularized the genre of [[cosmic horror]], and [[M. R. James|M.R.

[[Yellow journalism]] and [[sensationalism]] of various murderers, such as [[Jack the Ripper]], and lesser so, [[Carl Panzram]], [[Fritz Haarman]], and [[Albert Fish]], all perpetuated this phenomenon. The trend continued in the postwar era, partly renewed after the murders committed by [[Ed Gein]]. In 1959, [[Robert Bloch]], inspired by the murders, wrote ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]''. The crimes committed in 1969 by the [[Manson family]] influenced the slasher theme in horror fiction of the 1970s. In 1981, [[Thomas Harris]] wrote ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'', introducing [[Dr. Hannibal Lecter]]. In 1988, the sequel to that novel, ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', was published.\n\nEarly cinema was inspired by many aspects of horror literature, and started a strong tradition of [[horror film]]s and subgenres that continues to this day. Up until the graphic depictions of violence and gore on the screen commonly associated with 1960s and 1970s [[slasher film]]s and [[splatter film]]s, [[comic books]] such as those published by [[EC Comics]] (most notably ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales From The Crypt]]'') in the 1950s satisfied readers' quests for horror imagery that the [[silver screen]] could not provide.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hutchings|first1=Peter|title=The A to Z of Horror Cinema|series=The A to Z Guide Series|volume=100|year=2008|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-8108-6887-8|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_5DPHOVG7YC|accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref> This imagery made these comics controversial, and as a consequence, they were frequently censored.<ref>[[Collins, Max Allan]] (28 February 2013).

Horror elements continue to expand outside the genre. The [[alternate history]] of more traditional historical horror in [[Dan Simmons]]'s 2007 novel ''[[The Terror (novel)|The Terror]]'' sits on bookstore shelves next to genre [[Mashup (book)|mash up]]s such as ''[[Pride and Prejudice and Zombies]]'' (2009), and [[historical fantasy]] and [[horror comics]] such as ''[[Hellblazer]]'' (1993 onward) and [[Mike Mignola]]'s [[Hellboy]] (1993 onward). Horror also serves as one of the central genres in more complex modern works such as [[Mark Z. Danielewski]]'s ''[[House of Leaves]]'' (2000), a finalist for the [[National Book Award]]. There are many horror novels for teens, such as ''[[The Monstrumologist]]'' by [[Rick Yancey]] (2009). Additionally, many movies, particularly animated ones, use a horror aesthetic. These are what can be collectively referred to as \"children's horror\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Lester|first=Catherine|date=Fall 2016|title=The Children's Horror Film|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/628733|journal=The Velvet Light Trap |volume=78|issue=78|pages=22\u201337|doi=10.7560/VLT7803|via=}}</ref> Although it's unknown for sure why children enjoy these movies (as it seems counter-intuitive), it is theorized that it is the grotesque monsters that fascinate kids.<ref name=\":0\" /> Tangential to this, the internalized impact of horror television programs and films on children is rather under-researched, especially when compared to the research done on the similar subject of violence in TV and film's impact on the young mind.

One of H.P. Lovecraft's most famous quotes about the genre is that: \"The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldenproverbs.com/au_lovecraft.html|title=Golden Proverbs|accessdate = 15 December 2012}}</ref> the first sentence from his seminal essay, \"[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]\". Science fiction historian [[Darrell Schweitzer]] has stated \"In the simplest sense, a horror story is one that scares us\" and \"the true horror story requires a sense of evil, not in necessarily in a theological sense; but the menaces must be truly menacing, life-destroying, and antithetical to happiness.\"<ref>Schweitzer, Darrell, \"Why Horror Fiction?\" in ''Windows of the Imagination''.  Berkeley Heights, NJ : Wildside Press, 1999. {{ISBN|9781880448601}} (p. 64, 67).</ref> \n\nIn her essay \"Elements of Aversion\", Elizabeth Barrette articulates the need by some for horror tales in a modern world:\n{{quote|text=The old \"fight or flight\" reaction of our evolutionary heritage once played a major role in the life of every human. Our ancestors lived and died by it. Then someone invented the fascinating game of civilization, and things began to calm down. Development pushed wilderness back from settled lands. War, crime, and other forms of social violence came with civilization and humans started preying on each other, but by and large daily life calmed down. We began to feel restless, to feel something missing: the excitement of living on the edge, the tension between hunter and hunted. So we told each other stories through the long, dark nights. when the fires burned low, we did our best to scare the daylights out of each other. The rush of adrenaline feels good. Our hearts pound, our breath quickens, and we can imagine ourselves on the edge. Yet we also appreciate the insightful aspects of horror. Sometimes a story intends to shock and disgust, but the best horror intends to rattle our cages and shake us out of our complacency. It makes us think, forces us to confront ideas we might rather ignore, and challenges preconceptions of all kinds. Horror reminds us that the world is not always as safe as it seems, which exercises our mental muscles and reminds us to keep a little healthy caution close at hand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://horror.fictionfactor.com/articles/aversion.html |title=Elements of Aversion |accessdate=2 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228210354/http://horror.fictionfactor.com/articles/aversion.html |archive-date=28 February 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nIn a sense similar to the reason a person seeks out the controlled thrill of a [[roller coaster]], readers in the modern era seek out feelings of horror and terror to feel a sense of excitement. However, Barrette adds that horror fiction is one of the few mediums where readers seek out a form of art that forces themselves to confront ideas and images they \"might rather ignore to challenge preconceptions of all kinds.\"\n\nOne can see the confrontation of ideas that readers and characters would \"rather ignore\" throughout literature in famous moments such as [[Hamlet]]'s musings about the skull of [[Yorick]], its implications of the mortality of humanity, and the gruesome end that bodies inevitably come to. In horror fiction, the confrontation with the gruesome is often a [[metaphor]] for the problems facing the current generation of the author.\n\nThere are many theories as to why people enjoy being scared. For example, \"people who like horror films are more likely to score highly for openness to experience, a personality trait linked to intellect and imagination.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The benefits of being scared|issue=3216|pages=8|journal=New Scientist|volume=241|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(19)30224-6|date=9 February 2019|last1=Whyte|first1=Chelsea}}</ref>\n\nStephanie Demetrakopoulos illustrates a common interpretation of one of the benchmarks of the canon of horror literature.<ref name=\"Demetrakopoulos\">{{cite journal|title=Feminism, Sex Role Exchanges, and Other Subliminal Fantasies in Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\"\n|author=Stephanie Demetrakopoulos\n|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies\n|volume= 2|issue= 3|date=Autumn 1977|pages= 104\u2013113|publisher= University of Nebraska Press\n|jstor=3346355|doi=10.2307/3346355\n}}</ref> Tina Broussard in an [[Horror Stories - Ghost Stories]] of [[Dracula]] surmises Demetrakopoulos' thesis:\n\n{{quote|text=This scholarly journal article explores sexuality in ''Dracula'', including overtones of sexuality in the typical aggressive male and female sexuality which is either reflective of the chaste woman or the sexually aggressive female vampire. Demetrakopoulos suggests Dracula was an outlet for Victorian society, breaking through sexual norms with symbolic group orgies, male desire for sexually aggressive women, denial of motherhood, etc. She highlights ways in which the females defy gender boundaries by embodying masculine traits such as intelligence.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.horrorstorys.com |title=Horror Stories - ghost Stories }}{{dead link|date=March 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>}}\n\nIt is a now commonly accepted viewpoint that the horror elements of [[Dracula]]'s portrayal of [[vampire|vampirism]] are [[metaphor]]s for sexuality in a repressed [[Victorian era]].<ref name=\"Demetrakopoulos\" /> But this is merely one of many interpretations of the metaphor of Dracula. Judith Halberstam postulates many of these in her essay ''Technologies of Monstrosity: Bram Stoker's Dracula''. She writes:\n\n{{quote|text=[The] image of dusty and unused gold, coins from many nations and old unworn jewels, immediately connects Dracula to the old money of a corrupt class, to a kind of piracy of nations and to the worst excesses of the aristocracy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/30740375/913659240/name/halberstam%2Bdracula.pdf |title=Technologies of Monstrosity |accessdate=2 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512090142/http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/30740375/913659240/name/halberstam%2Bdracula.pdf |archive-date=12 May 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Punch Anti-Irish propaganda (1882) Irish Frankenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration from an 1882 issue of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'': An English editorial cartoonist conceives the Irish [[Fenian|Fenian movement]] as akin to Frankenstein's monster, in the wake of the [[Phoenix Park killings]]. <br> Menacing villains and monsters in horror literature can often be seen as metaphors for the fears [[incarnate]] of a society.]]\n\nHalberstram articulates a view of Dracula as manifesting the growing perception of the [[aristocracy]] as an evil and outdated notion to be defeated. The depiction of a multinational band of [[protagonists]] using the latest [[technologies]] (such as a [[telegraph]]) to quickly share, collate, and act upon new information is what leads to the destruction of the vampire. This is one of many interpretations of the metaphor of only one central figure of the canon of horror fiction, as over a dozen possible metaphors are referenced in the analysis, from the religious to the [[anti-semitic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lsu.edu/faculty/jpullia/dracula.htm |title=Lecture Notes for Dracula |accessdate=2 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025132906/http://www.lsu.edu/faculty/jpullia/dracula.htm |archivedate=25 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[No\u00ebl Carroll]]'s ''Philosophy of Horror'' postulates that a modern piece of horror fiction's \"[[monster]]\", [[villain]], or a more inclusive menace must exhibit the following two traits:\n* A menace that is threatening&nbsp;\u2014 either physically, psychologically, socially, morally, spiritually, or some combination of the aforementioned.\n* A menace that is impure&nbsp;\u2014 that violates the generally accepted schemes of cultural categorization. \"We consider impure that which is categorically contradictory\".<ref name=Datingghosts>{{cite web |url=https://www.hindihorrorstories.info/2019/01/best-hindi-horror-story-real-pakyong-ghost.html |publisher=Dating Ghosts |title=Horror Stories }}</ref>\n\n==Scholarship and criticism==\nIn addition to those essays and articles shown above, scholarship on horror fiction is almost as old as horror fiction itself. In 1826, the gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe published an essay distinguishing two elements of horror fiction, \"terror\" and \"horror.\" Whereas terror is a feeling of dread that takes place before an event happens, horror is a feeling of revulsion or disgust after an event has happened.<ref>[[Ann Radcliffe|Mrs Radcliffe]], \"[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KMg2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA145#v=onepage&q&f=false On the Supernatural in Poetry]\", ''[[The New Monthly Magazine]]'' 7 (1826): 145\u201352.</ref> Radcliffe describes terror as that which \"expands the soul and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life,\" whereas horror is described as that which \"freezes and nearly annihilates them.\"\n\nModern scholarship on horror fiction draws upon a range of sources. In their historical studies of the gothic novel, both Devandra Varma<ref>Devandra Varma, ''The Gothic Flame'' (New York: Russell & Russell, 1966.</ref> and S.L. Varnado<ref>S.L. Varnado, \"The Idea of the Numinous in Gothic Literature,\" in The Gothic Imagination, ed. G.R. Thompson (Pullman: Washington State University Press, 1974).</ref> make reference to the theologian [[Rudolf Otto]], whose concept of the \"[[numinous]]\" was originally used to describe religious experience.\n\nA recent survey reports how often horror media is consumed:<blockquote>To assess frequency of horror consumption, we asked respondents the following question: \u201cIn the past year, about how often have you used horror media (e.g., horror literature, film, and video games) for entertainment?\u201d 11.3% said \u201cNever,\u201d 7.5% \u201cOnce,\u201d 28.9% \u201cSeveral times,\u201d 14.1% \u201cOnce a month,\u201d 20.8% \u201cSeveral times a month,\u201d 7.3% \u201cOnce a week,\u201d and 10.2% \u201cSeveral times a week.\u201d Evidently, then, most respondents (81.3%) claimed to use horror media several times a year or more often. Unsurprisingly, there is a strong correlation between liking and frequency of use (r=.79, p<.0001).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329200207|title=Horror, Personality, and Threat Simulation: A Survey on the Psychology of Scary Media {{!}} Request PDF|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n==Awards and associations==\nAchievements in horror fiction are recognized by numerous awards.

She is a nine-time winner of the [[British Chess Championship|British Women's Chess Championship]] and the current continuous British women's champion since 2015.\n\n==Formative years==\nBorn in south London, her family name stems from her grandfather who was part Czech. Her first name is typically [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]], but was chosen only to complement the family name. Chess is a popular sport in the Houska family, and she owes much of her progress to the sibling rivalry that developed with elder brother Miroslav, himself an International Master of chess, though currently inactive. She now lives on the capital's north side and has a [[Academic degree|degree]] in Law.\n\nOne of England's most active professionals, she first represented her country at the [[World Youth Chess Championship|World Youth Championship]] for Girls (under 10) in [[Timi\u0219oara]] 1988, finishing fifth after a disastrous start and despite being years younger than most of her opponents. She competed in the same event at [[Aguadilla]] in 1989 and then, for a third time at [[Fond du Lac, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]] in 1990, where she won the bronze medal. There were many more successes over the next few years including another bronze medal at the [[European Junior Chess Championship|European Junior Championship]] for girls (under 20) at [[Erevan]] in 1998. As a consequence, she was awarded the [[Woman International Master]] (WIM) title the same year, after securing all three norms in just over a month. Her first WGM norm was achieved at the 1999 [[British Chess Championship|British Championship]] when she was still a teenager.\n\n==European success==\nThen, at [[Avil\u00e9s]] in 2000, her previous efforts were eclipsed by a return visit to the European Junior Championship\u2014capturing the gold winner's medal, ahead of [[Viktorija \u010cmilyt\u0117]]. It was a milestone victory, as it also provided a final qualification norm for the WGM title. The following year saw her take the Women's [[Commonwealth Chess Championship|Commonwealth Championship]], held in London in conjunction with the [[Mind Sports Olympiad]]. She defeated GM [[Dibyendu Barua]] in the process and gained a first IM norm.\n\n==Team events==\nDespite her time-consuming academic studies, the next few years were notable for Houska's unstinting contribution to the England Women's team at various major competitions around the world. She participated at each of the [[Chess Olympiad]]s between 1998 and 2008 and aside from her first appearance as a reserve, has played consistently on high boards, scoring in excess of 50% on each occasion. From 1999 onwards, she has also been an ever-present at the [[European Team Chess Championship]]s. The team's most notable performance in this event, occurred at [[Leon, Spain|Leon]] in 2001, where a third-place finish produced a team bronze medal.\n\nAn active league chess player, she has represented ''SK Hofheim'' in the German [[Chess Bundesliga|Bundesliga]], ''Deauville'' in France, and ''Wood Green'' in the [[4NCL]].\n\n==Further progress==\n[[File:Houska rd6 4thEUIO.JPG|right|thumb|250px|IM Houska at Liverpool's EU Championships, 2008]]\nFollowing yet more successful norm-seeking, she became the third British woman to be awarded the IM title in 2005. Voted [[English Chess Federation]] ''Player of the Year'' in 2006, she was the first female to receive the accolade since its inception in 1984. There were 'highest placed Woman' prizes at the [[Hastings International Chess Congress]] 2006/7 and at [[Gibraltar]] 2007. She also came close to winning the first [[MonRoi]] Women's Grand Prix, finally finishing second equal behind [[Pia Cramling]]. Her task was much more difficult at the fifth [[Howard Staunton Memorial Tournament]], held at [[Simpsons-in-the-Strand]], where she faced some of the world's top grandmasters and finished in last place.\n\nAt [[Liverpool]] in 2008, she became British and English Women's Champion for the first time, finishing a full point ahead of closest rival [[Susan Lalic]] and a half point ahead of grandmasters [[Glenn Flear]] and [[Stewart Haslinger]]. Her second Liverpool visit resulted in a third share of the women's best performance prize (jointly with [[Ketevan Arakhamia-Grant]] and [[Yelena Dembo]]) at the [[EU Individual Open Chess Championship]].\n\nHouska successfully defended her British Championship title at the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 events. By July 2010, her sustained good form had elevated her to an [[Elo rating]] of 2433, making her England's second ranked woman player (behind [[Harriet Hunt]]) and number fifty-one in the world among active female players. Further British Championship victories were achieved in 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\nAs a chess writer, she has reported on tournaments home and abroad for periodicals such as [[CHESS magazine]]. Houska completed her first [[chess opening]] book in 2007. Written for ''Everyman Chess'', it features a treatise on Houska's opening of choice with the Black pieces\u2014the [[Caro-Kann Defence]]. A second book, covering the [[Scandinavian Defence]], was published in 2009 and there followed a collaboration on 2010s ''Dangerous Weapons: The Caro-Kann'', with fellow English masters [[John Emms (chess player)|John Emms]] and [[Richard Palliser]].\n\n==Personal==\nHouska married Norwegian chess player Arne Hagesaether on 14 March 2009 at the Ice Chapel in [[Alta, Norway]].<ref>[http://www.englishchess.org.uk/national/2009/intl19_mar09.htm ECF Website item by IM Lawrence Cooper]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Notable games==\nAt the Dresden Olympiad of 2008, Houska won twice against high ranking opposition;\n*[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1521881 J.

She now lives on the capital's north side and has a [[Academic degree|degree]] in Law.\n\nOne of England's most active professionals, she first represented her country at the [[World Youth Chess Championship|World Youth Championship]] for Girls (under 10) in [[Timi\u015foara]] 1988, finishing fifth after a disastrous start and despite being years younger than most of her opponents. She competed in the same event at [[Aguadilla]] in 1989 and then, for a third time at [[Fond du Lac, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]] in 1990, where she won the bronze medal. There were many more successes over the next few years including another bronze medal at the [[European Junior Chess Championship|European Junior Championship]] for girls (under 20) at [[Erevan]] in 1998. As a consequence, she was awarded the [[Woman International Master]] (WIM) title the same year, after securing all three norms in just over a month. Her first WGM norm was achieved at the 1999 [[British Chess Championship|British Championship]] when she was still a teenager.\n\n==European success==\nThen, at [[Avil\u00e9s]] in 2000, her previous efforts were eclipsed by a return visit to the European Junior Championship\u2014capturing the gold winner's medal, ahead of [[Viktorija \u010cmilyt\u0117]]. It was a milestone victory, as it also provided a final qualification norm for the WGM title. The following year saw her take the Women's [[Commonwealth Chess Championship|Commonwealth Championship]], held in London in conjunction with the [[Mind Sports Olympiad]]. She defeated GM [[Dibyendu Barua]] in the process and gained a first IM norm.\n\n==Team events==\nDespite her time-consuming academic studies, the next few years were notable for Houska's unstinting contribution to the England Women's team at various major competitions around the world. She participated at each of the [[Chess Olympiad]]s between 1998 and 2008 and aside from her first appearance as a reserve, has played consistently on high boards, scoring in excess of 50% on each occasion. From 1999 onwards, she has also been an ever-present at the [[European Team Chess Championship]]s. The team's most notable performance in this event, occurred at [[Leon, Spain|Leon]] in 2001, where a third-place finish produced a team bronze medal.\n\nAn active league chess player, she has represented ''SK Hofheim'' in the German [[Chess Bundesliga|Bundesliga]], ''Deauville'' in France, and ''Wood Green'' in the [[4NCL]].\n\n==Further progress==\n[[File:Houska rd6 4thEUIO.JPG|right|thumb|250px|IM Houska at Liverpool's EU Championships, 2008]]\nFollowing yet more successful norm-seeking, she became the third British woman to be awarded the IM title in 2005. Voted [[English Chess Federation]] ''Player of the Year'' in 2006, she was the first female to receive the accolade since its inception in 1984. There were 'highest placed Woman' prizes at the [[Hastings International Chess Congress]] 2006/7 and at [[Gibraltar]] 2007. She also came close to winning the first [[MonRoi]] Women's Grand Prix, finally finishing second equal behind [[Pia Cramling]]. Her task was much more difficult at the fifth [[Howard Staunton Memorial Tournament]], held at [[Simpsons-in-the-Strand]], where she faced some of the world's top grandmasters and finished in last place.\n\nAt [[Liverpool]] in 2008, she became British and English Women's Champion for the first time, finishing a full point ahead of closest rival [[Susan Lalic]] and a half point ahead of grandmasters [[Glenn Flear]] and [[Stewart Haslinger]]. Her second Liverpool visit resulted in a third share of the women's best performance prize (jointly with [[Ketevan Arakhamia-Grant]] and [[Yelena Dembo]]) at the [[EU Individual Open Chess Championship]].\n\nHouska successfully defended her British Championship title at the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 events. By July 2010, her sustained good form had elevated her to an [[Elo rating]] of 2433, making her England's second ranked woman player (behind [[Harriet Hunt]]) and number fifty-one in the world among active female players. Further British Championship victories were achieved in 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\nAs a chess writer, she has reported on tournaments home and abroad for periodicals such as [[CHESS magazine]]. Houska completed her first [[chess opening]] book in 2007. Written for ''Everyman Chess'', it features a treatise on Houska's opening of choice with the Black pieces\u2014the [[Caro-Kann Defence]]. A second book, covering the [[Scandinavian Defence]], was published in 2009 and there followed a collaboration on 2010s ''Dangerous Weapons: The Caro-Kann'', with fellow English masters [[John Emms (chess player)|John Emms]] and [[Richard Palliser]].\n\n==Personal==\nHouska married Norwegian chess player Arne Hagesaether on 14 March 2009 at the Ice Chapel in [[Alta, Norway]].<ref>[http://www.englishchess.org.uk/national/2009/intl19_mar09.htm ECF Website item by IM Lawrence Cooper]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Notable games==\nAt the Dresden Olympiad of 2008, Houska won twice against high ranking opposition;\n*[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1521881 J.

{"title_page": "Japanese pop culture in the United States", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Original research|date=December 2010}}\n{{More footnotes|date=December 2010}}\n}}\n\nThe flow of [[Japanese animation]], [[manga]] and [[Video games in Japan|video games]] to the [[United States]] has increased American awareness of [[Japanese popular culture]]. [[Anime]] differs from American animation in the range of its audiences and themes. Anime is made for young teens and adults more often than are American cartoons, and often deals with more serious themes. Anime and manga incorporate a multitude of genres such as romance, action, horror, comedy, drama and cover a wide variety of topics like teen suicides, high school rivalries, and social commentary, and more subjects. Described as a gateway for many fans that takes them to a whole new culture; it is used as a way to learn about [[Japan]]. People who are avid devotees to anime in the United States affectionately refer to themselves as [[otaku]], although in Japan the term is similar to [[geek]], and is commonly frowned upon by society. Much like [[Punk subculture|punk]] and [[Goth subculture|goth]], anime has become a [[subculture]].\n\n==Anime in the United States==\nAnime culture in the United States began as a niche community that had a grassroots foundation built by groups of fans on the local level.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Mckevitt|first=Andrew C.|date=2010-11-01|title=\"You Are Not Alone!\": Anime and the Globalizing of America|journal=Diplomatic History|volume=34|issue=5|pages=893\u2013921|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7709.2010.00899.x|issn=0145-2096}}</ref> Some of the earliest televised anime to air in the United States were ''[[Astro Boy]]'', ''[[Speed Racer]]'', and ''[[Gigantor]]'', which gained popularity with many American audiences during the late 1960s.<ref name=\":02\" /> Anime shows that aired in the United States up until the 1980s were usually heavily altered and localized, such as ''[[Science Ninja Team Gatchaman]]'' becoming ''[[Battle of the Planets]]'' in the 1970s,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kelts |first1=Roland |title=Japanamerica: How Japanese Pop Culture Has Invaded the U.S. |date=2007 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |isbn=9781403984760 |pages=13\u201314 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f2rgCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA13}}</ref> and the [[mecha]] show ''[[Macross]]'' becoming ''[[Robotech]]'' in the 1980s.

Michael B. Jordan, from Black Panther & Creed fame, is starring in his own series and producing the series gen:LOCK.  The stereotype of being a nerd or geek if you watch anime has changed and it is mainstream now. This is good since people can let their geekiness out and not feel like they will be judged a certain way.

However, due to the nature of its roots, the fandom is better thought of as a hybrid of American and Japanese cultural notes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Denison|first=Rayna|date=2011|title=Transcultural creativity in anime: Hybrid identities in the production, distribution, texts and fandom of Japanese anime.|url=|journal=Creative Industries Journal|volume=3|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nInterview with modern-day anime fans reveal that some have no interest in its Japanese roots, merely that they enjoy the fashion or particular facets of the fandom. Scholars highlight the reason for this phenomenon as being the increasing hybrid factor of anime caused by integrating North America\u2019s popular culture characteristics.<ref name=\":1\" /> Because of the nature of imports, scholars found that the natural selectivity of anime importing by American companies cause the perception of anime to grow increasingly Western, as anime itself as a medium covers a broad range of genres.\n\nThe Japanese anime has infiltrated the biggest cartoon network that is in the United States, Cartoon Network.  This has had a huge impact on a new generation of viewers to by introduced to anime and the different styles.  If you look at the original Cartoon Network series, Adventures of Gumball and especially Teen Titans Go, you can see how they used the anime style with their animation and even their theme song is very Japanese inspired.  Adventures of Gumball has a lot of references to the different animes and will cause some viewers to check out those series and influence more people to check out Japanese anime.  It has become so popular; they have even created a special time slot for new series and re-occurring popular series on their Saturday night Toonami segment.  There is such a rich culture that is brought out in the anime, you can watch about Japan\u2019s early history about the samurai and the bloody wars that are associated with them.  Having these types of \u201chistorical\u201d anime gives people an insight on how Japan became how it is today, granted it does have some creator interpretation on the story which might not be historically accurate.  But these animes like Rurouni Kenshin gives the viewer a glimpse in the Meiji era and has plenty of action and romance as well.  This has influence other American shows like Samurai Jack and Afro Samurai: Resurrection that had the voice of Samuel L. Jackson. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Toonami|first=Wikipedia|date=2019|title=Toonami.|url= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toonami}}</ref>\n\n===Anime conventions===\n{{Main|Anime convention}}\n\nPrimarily the function of [[anime convention]]s in the United States is to give a place to fans of anime, manga and Japanese culture. There are a range of informational panels offered at these conventions from the basics of Japanese language and culture to cutting edge news about anime releases in Japan and the US. Anime conventions also provide performances and vendors of Japanese goods, manga, anime, figurines and Anime related merchandise.  Most American anime conventions are fan operated, the increase in popularity starting in the '90s, sprung forth a long-standing list of annual conventions, such as [[Anime Expo]], AnimeFest, [[Otakon]], and [[Anime Boston]], which continue to today with numbers of attendance reaching over 100,000.\n\n===Anime influence and sales===\n{{see also|Anime-influenced animation}}\n\nThrough the last two decades the introduction of anime into American mainstream culture has furthered its popularity. Such famous titles as ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', and most importantly ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' have influenced anime's appeal to young Americans.<ref>http://publications.epress.monash.edu/doi/pdf/10.2104/cc100012{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> \"Anime already makes up an estimated 60% of all broadcast animation across the world.\" \"ICv2 estimates the size of the North American anime market at $275-300 million\" (in retail dollars).\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/12068.html|title=Anime DVDs Down 20% |date=February 13, 2008|accessdate=December 10, 2010}}</ref> To compete with its Japanese competitors, many production companies in the US have [[Anime-influenced animation|adjusted their style to one inspired by anime]] to hold onto their viewers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} An important example that has sparked much controversy in the animation world would be ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} A popular show on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]], the characters have a distinct anime style, even the expressions and mannerism drawn evoke that of anime style.

This is why it is so popular in the United States since people can get to know the characters better and become invested in the series and at times dress up like them for conventions or just Cosplay (costume play).  The show incorporates real life in the series where the viewer can see the person attend High School, which is similar to the ones in real life.  They can learn a lot about the Japanese culture which enticed people to want to learn more about the culture and even possible visit Japan.  With the Anime boom and how much revenue is created from this, the United States has jumped on board to create their own shows with anime style animation.  You can see this in the Avatar: The Last Air-bender as well as its sequel, The Legend of Korra. <ref>{{cite web |url= https://jpninfo.com/31964|title=How Has Japanese Anime Influenced the World?|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Manga in the United States ==\n''See also: [[Tokyopop]]''\n\nAlong with the translating and purchasing of Japanese manga in the United States, this led to the development of artists and writers in the country to develop their own manga. These were called Original English Language manga (OEL manga for short). These comics were mostly a retelling of a piece of American entertainment, such as Disney films, or perhaps a sequel to a movie, TV series, or adaptation of a video game.\n\n===Manga influences and sales===\nCalvin Reid of ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' estimated that the \"Total U.S. manga sales in 2007 rose about 10%, to more than $220 million, and about 1,468 titles are estimated to have been released last year.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/4776-new-report-finds-c2-a0manga-sales-up-anime-dvd-down-in-07-c2-a0-.html|title=New Report Finds Manga Sales Up; Anime DVD Down in '07 |author= Reid, Calvin|date=December 7, 2007  |accessdate=December 10, 2010}}</ref>  With the popularity of manga on the rise graphic novel artists are beginning to adapt their style to that of manga.

The games produced by the companies are extremely well-known across the world, including famous [[arcade games]] such as ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Pac-Man]]'', and incredibly popular franchises such as ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Metal Gear]]'', ''[[Street Fighter]]'', ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil]]''. Numerous Japanese games have been ranked among the best games of all time, and have spawned sequels, remakes and adaptations.\n\n==American cosplayers==\n[[File:Roen Maiden Cosplay.jpg|thumb|Cosplay of ''[[Rozen Maiden]]'']]\n\nThe term \"[[cosplay]]\" corresponds to an abbreviation of the English words costume play, though the term was coined in Japan the practice is not solely Japanese. The use of the term cosplay applies to any costumed role play outside of theaters. Characters are often taken from popular Japanese fiction. Popular sources that fans draw from include anime, manga, video games, comic books, and graphic novels. American cosplayers practice this form of fandom at anime conventions. However, there are a growing number of web pages and photo sites dedicated to the art of cosplaying, such as [[DeviantArt]] and Cosplay.com.\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Miyavi in Sao Paulo, Brazil.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Miyavi]]\n[[J-pop|Japanese pop]] and [[Japanese rock|rock music]] acts are also increasing in popularity amongst US listeners.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Such artists include [[L'Arc-en-Ciel]], [[Miyavi]], [[T.M.Revolution]], [[Hikaru Utada]], [[Asian Kung-Fu Generation]], [[Dir En Grey]], [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], and [[Susumu Hirasawa]].

[[Japanese idol]]s, like [[Morning Musume]], [[AKB48]] and [[S/mileage]] are now becoming known in the US thanks to the internet. In 2009, [[Morning Musume]] performed at [[Anime Expo]] and in 2010 [[AKB48]] played there. Also in 2010, influential [[heavy metal music|metal]] band [[X Japan]] performed their first US tour, selling out most shows. In April 2011, [[Berryz Kobo]] played at an [[anime]] convention in Washington. Japanese manga art has also influenced American music artists and singers, such as [[Pharrell Williams]] whose music video [[It Girl (Pharrell Williams song)]] contains a wide array of anime style artwork.

[[Anime]] differs from American animation in the range of its audiences and themes. Anime is made for young teens and adults more often than are American cartoons, and often deals with more serious themes. Anime and manga incorporate a multitude of genres such as romance, action, horror, comedy, drama and cover a wide variety of topics like teen suicides, high school rivalries, and social commentary, and more subjects. Described as a gateway for many fans that takes them to a whole new culture; it is used as a way to learn about [[Japan]]. People who are avid devotees to anime in the United States affectionately refer to themselves as [[otaku]], although in Japan the term is similar to [[geek]], and is commonly frowned upon by society. Much like [[Punk subculture|punk]] and [[Goth subculture|goth]], anime has become a [[subculture]].\n\n==Anime in the United States==\nAnime culture in the United States began as a niche community that had a grassroots foundation built by groups of fans on the local level.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Mckevitt|first=Andrew C.|date=2010-11-01|title=\"You Are Not Alone!\": Anime and the Globalizing of America|journal=Diplomatic History|volume=34|issue=5|pages=893\u2013921|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7709.2010.00899.x|issn=0145-2096}}</ref> Some of the earliest televised anime to air in the United States were ''[[Astro Boy]]'', ''[[Speed Racer]]'', and ''[[Gigantor]]'', which gained popularity with many American audiences during the late 1960s.<ref name=\":02\" /> Anime shows that aired in the United States up until the 1980s were usually heavily altered and localized, such as ''[[Science Ninja Team Gatchaman]]'' becoming ''[[Battle of the Planets]]'' in the 1970s,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kelts |first1=Roland |title=Japanamerica: How Japanese Pop Culture Has Invaded the U.S. |date=2007 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |isbn=9781403984760 |pages=13\u201314 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f2rgCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA13}}</ref> and the [[mecha]] show ''[[Macross]]'' becoming ''[[Robotech]]'' in the 1980s.

Michael B. Jordan, from Black Panther & Creed fame, is starring in his own series and producing the series gen:LOCK.  The stereotype of being a nerd or geek if you watch anime has changed and it is mainstream now. This is good since people can let their geekiness out and not feel like they will be judged a certain way.

However, due to the nature of its roots, the fandom is better thought of as a hybrid of American and Japanese cultural notes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Denison|first=Rayna|date=2011|title=Transcultural creativity in anime: Hybrid identities in the production, distribution, texts and fandom of Japanese anime.|url=|journal=Creative Industries Journal|volume=3|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nInterview with modern-day anime fans reveal that some have no interest in its Japanese roots, merely that they enjoy the fashion or particular facets of the fandom. Scholars highlight the reason for this phenomenon as being the increasing hybrid factor of anime caused by integrating North America\u2019s popular culture characteristics.<ref name=\":1\" /> Because of the nature of imports, scholars found that the natural selectivity of anime importing by American companies cause the perception of anime to grow increasingly Western, as anime itself as a medium covers a broad range of genres.\n\nThe Japanese anime has infiltrated the biggest cartoon network that is in the United States, Cartoon Network.  This has had a huge impact on a new generation of viewers to by introduced to anime and the different styles.  If you look at the original Cartoon Network series, Adventures of Gumball and especially Teen Titans Go, you can see how they used the anime style with their animation and even their theme song is very Japanese inspired.  Adventures of Gumball has a lot of references to the different animes and will cause some viewers to check out those series and influence more people to check out Japanese anime.  It has become so popular; they have even created a special time slot for new series and re-occurring popular series on their Saturday night Toonami segment.  There is such a rich culture that is brought out in the anime, you can watch about Japan\u2019s early history about the samurai and the bloody wars that are associated with them.  Having these types of \u201chistorical\u201d anime gives people an insight on how Japan became how it is today, granted it does have some creator interpretation on the story which might not be historically accurate.  But these animes like Rurouni Kenshin gives the viewer a glimpse in the Meiji era and has plenty of action and romance as well.  This has influence other American shows like Samurai Jack and Afro Samurai: Resurrection that had the voice of Samuel L. Jackson. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Toonami|first=Wikipedia|date=2019|title=Toonami.|url= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toonami}}</ref>\n\n===Anime conventions===\n{{Main|Anime convention}}\n\nPrimarily the function of [[anime convention]]s in the United States is to give a place to fans of anime, manga and Japanese culture. There are a range of informational panels offered at these conventions from the basics of Japanese language and culture to cutting edge news about anime releases in Japan and the US. Anime conventions also provide performances and vendors of Japanese goods, manga, anime, figurines and Anime related merchandise.  Most American anime conventions are fan operated, the increase in popularity starting in the '90s, sprung forth a long-standing list of annual conventions, such as [[Anime Expo]], AnimeFest, [[Otakon]], and [[Anime Boston]], which continue to today with numbers of attendance reaching over 100,000.\n\n===Anime influence and sales===\n{{see also|Anime-influenced animation}}\n\nThrough the last two decades the introduction of anime into American mainstream culture has furthered its popularity. Such famous titles as ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', and most importantly ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' have influenced anime's appeal to young Americans.<ref>http://publications.epress.monash.edu/doi/pdf/10.2104/cc100012{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> \"Anime already makes up an estimated 60% of all broadcast animation across the world.\" \"ICv2 estimates the size of the North American anime market at $275-300 million\" (in retail dollars).\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/12068.html|title=Anime DVDs Down 20% |date=February 13, 2008|accessdate=December 10, 2010}}</ref> To compete with its Japanese competitors, many production companies in the US have [[Anime-influenced animation|adjusted their style to one inspired by anime]] to hold onto their viewers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} An important example that has sparked much controversy in the animation world would be ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} A popular show on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]], the characters have a distinct anime style, even the expressions and mannerism drawn evoke that of anime style.

This is why it is so popular in the United States since people can get to know the characters better and become invested in the series and at times dress up like them for conventions or just Cosplay (costume play).  The show incorporates real life in the series where the viewer can see the person attend High School, which is similar to the ones in real life.  They can learn a lot about the Japanese culture which enticed people to want to learn more about the culture and even possible visit Japan.  With the Anime boom and how much revenue is created from this, the United States has jumped on board to create their own shows with anime style animation.  You can see this in the Avatar: The Last Air-bender as well as its sequel, The Legend of Korra. <ref>{{cite web |url= https://jpninfo.com/31964|title=How Has Japanese Anime Influenced the World?|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Manga in the United States ==\n''See also: [[Tokyopop]]''\n\nAlong with the translating and purchasing of Japanese manga in the United States, this led to the development of artists and writers in the country to develop their own manga. These were called Original English Language manga (OEL manga for short). These comics were mostly a retelling of a piece of American entertainment, such as Disney films, or perhaps a sequel to a movie, TV series, or adaptation of a video game.\n\n===Manga influences and sales===\nCalvin Reid of ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' estimated that the \"Total U.S. manga sales in 2007 rose about 10%, to more than $220 million, and about 1,468 titles are estimated to have been released last year.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/4776-new-report-finds-c2-a0manga-sales-up-anime-dvd-down-in-07-c2-a0-.html|title=New Report Finds Manga Sales Up; Anime DVD Down in '07 |author= Reid, Calvin|date=December 7, 2007  |accessdate=December 10, 2010}}</ref>  With the popularity of manga on the rise graphic novel artists are beginning to adapt their style to that of manga.

He studied in the musical high school in his home town as well as in the Conservatories of [[Bucharest]] and of [[Cluj-Napoca]]. He began his conducting career in [[Boto\u0219ani]], where he was active from 1960-63.\n\nFrom 1965-92 he was Chief Conductor of the [[Oradea]] Philharmonic Orchestra, in which capacity he also acted as their Administrative Director from 1980-89. He succeeded in greatly raising the artistic level of the ensemble which soon developed into one of Romania's finest orchestras. Besides his numerous concerts, he released some 30 gramophone recordings. During his tenure, he paid special attention to two important composers who had lived in Oradea: [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf]] and also [[Michael Haydn]], whose symphonies he was the first to record commercially. For a short period between 1981\u201383, Ac\u00e9l was the director of the [[Istanbul]] State Opera and Ballet.\n\nFrom 1991-99 he was the Director and Chief Conductor of the [[Szeged Symphony Orchestra]], the second most important orchestra in [[Hungary]].
