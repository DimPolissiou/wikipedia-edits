November 2010</ref> was an artistic movement founded in [[Germany]] on May 2, 1898, with the intention of demonstrating art that was contradictory to typical standards set by the academy. The movement was considered a part of German [[Modernism]], and was in part thanks to the boom of growth in [[Berlin]] at the time, as well as addressing the need for alternative groups within the artistic community.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture, 1890=1918|last=Bilski|first=Emily D.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=51-53}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Rise and Reign of the Secession ===\nThe upheavals that led to the formation of the Berlin Secession began in 1891 on the occasion of the Great International Art Exhibition in Berlin. A dispute began after the commission of the Association of Berlin Artists rejected images done by [[Edvard Munch]]. In May 1898, under the leadership of [[Walter Leistikow]], [[Franz Skarbina]] and [[Max Liebermann]], various artists converged to form a \"free association for the organization of artistic exhibitions\". This group was governed by a President, [[Max Liebermann]]<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture, 1890=1918|last=Bilski|first=Emily D.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=49}}</ref>, and a Secretary, Walter Leistikow, along with an executive committee. At the time of its inception, there was a total of 65 members, including both men and women as full members. All those involved in the Secession followed a constitution that defined terms of involvement in the group, and nothing could be changed without a three-fourths majority from the committee.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Berlin Secession|last1=Paret|first1=Peter|date=1980|publisher=Library of Congress|page=59}}</ref> The Free Union of the XXIV was founded in [[Munich]] and exhibited under this name in [[Berlin]].\n\nThere were a variety of causes that led to the break in German art:\n\nIn November 1892, a scandal occurred when an Edvard Munch exhibition was closed by a majority of the members of the Association of Berlin Artists. They described Munch's as \"repugnant, ugly and mean\". Other artists in favor of Munch, however, were not yet organized enough to leave the established exhibition system of the Academy.\n\nLater, in 1898, the jury of the Great Berlin Art Exhibition rejected a landscape painting by the painter [[Walter Leistikow]]. Now the proof was finally provided that the \"modern art\" of the rising artists had no support from the Academy. This was the final act of momentum needed to organize the secession. The president at the time, Max Liebermann, gave some demands to the Secession at the Great Berlin Art Exhibition in 1899. He asked that the secession receive quality space, no less than 8 rooms worth, with an independent jury and committee. However, the demand was refused on the grounds of having excessive conditions for such a small group. After delegations, a compromise was met, still favoring independence from the rest of the exhibitions, but fewer rooms.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Berlin Secession|last1=Paret|first1=Peter|date=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=62}}</ref>\n\nLiebermann recruited the art dealers [[Bruno Cassirer|Bruno]] and [[Paul Cassirer]] and offered them to become executive secretaries of the Secession. They joined in 1899 and together had a seat on the board but without voting rights. They were responsible for the planning and execution of the building, which was built according to plans by [[Hans Grisebach]] at Kantstra\u00dfe 12 (corner Fasanenstra\u00dfe).\n\nThe split in German art was, incidentally, extremely well-accepted in the political sphere. There had been unrest in conservative groups towards the mixture of art in the annual salon. They believed immoral art should not be mingled in the same space as more traditional art, and they criticized the inclusion of foreign artists. However, they didn't outright demand their removal, only that they be given their own space to display work. This thinking lined up incredibly well with the wants of the Berlin Secession modernists, and made the split an easy transition for politics.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Berlin Secession|last1=Paret|first1=Peter|date=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=64}}</ref>\n\nOn May 19, 1899, an exhibition of 330 pictures and graphics and 50 sculptures was opened in Charlottenburger Kantstra\u00dfe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/berlin-secession.htm#targetText=The%20first%20exhibition%20of%20the,establishment%20maintained%20an%20uneasy%20coexistence.|title=Berlin Secession: Avant-Garde Artists Group|website=Visual Arts Cork|accessdate=10/12/2019}}</ref> Of the 187 exhibitors, 46 lived in Berlin and 57 in Munich. At this time, foreign contributions were still missing. The audience of 2000 invited guests were impressed and the exhibits were perceived as overcoming the prevailing mediocrity. The event was attended by those of high social standing as well- the audience not only contained the head of the salon, Max Koner, but the President of the Royal Academy, which helped it be perceived as a surprisingly respectable gathering.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Berlin Secession|last1=Paret|first1=Peter|date=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=79-80}}</ref>\n\nAt the second exhibition, the international claim was honored, of which 414 exhibits were over ten percent of foreign artists, including Pissarro, Renoir, Segantini and Whistler. This baffled nationalist circles, so that a conservative minority separated again until 1902 from the Secession. In addition to the summer exhibitions, there were also winter exhibitions reserved for graphics under the title \"Black and White Exhibitions\". At the 1902 exhibition, works by Kandinsky, Manet, Monet and Munch were shown for the first time. For the first time, the trend showed that Berlin Munich declined the rank of art metropolis Germany. When Germany wanted to participate with art in the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904, failed to reach an agreement of the Commission to Anton von Werner and the Emperor with the Berlin Secession.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Berlin Secession|last1=Paret|first1=Peter|date=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=\"German Impressionism and the Conflict Over Art at Saint Louis\"}}</ref>\n\nIn 1905, the relocation to the then-new larger building on [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]] 208, the place where today the theater on Kurf\u00fcrstendamm is located. Jury members this year were Heinrich Reifferscheid, [[Philipp Franck]], [[Leo von K\u00f6nig]], [[Lovis Corinth]] and [[Ernst Oppler]].<ref>[http://www.georgbroel.de/dokumente/reifferscheid.html Website.] Zugriff am 20.

Among the visitors were [[Max Slevogt]], [[Georg Kolbe]], [[Fritz Klimsch]] and Ernst Oppler, as well as representatives of the press.<ref>''Museums Journal'', Nr. 11, Ausgabe 25, S.&nbsp;38, 1997</ref> The ballet and the tennis courts were among the most popular motifs of the Berlin Secession.\n\n=== Artistic Style and Influence ===\nThe style of German art at the time was closely influenced by France, whether or not you were attempting to replicate the French style or distance yourself from it. During the late Imperial period, from around 1888 to around 1918, ideas of nationalism and a political interest in art became more popularized. Germans were interested in what it meant to be German, and what it meant to have a cultural identity through artistic style. People wanted Germany to have an individual artistic identity. France had influenced the artistic world in Germany for so long, but at this point, both artists and consumers had begun to reject what was called French Naturalism, and garnering more interest in German Idealism. A member of the Berlin Secession, Karl Scheffler, categorized the differences in the artistic styles, perception and conception. Perception dictated painting of the natural world and what was physical around you. This was seen as the French way of art. Germans were conceptual painters, who took ideas and gave them form, and preferred to gain inspiration from their own thoughts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Painterly Thought: Max Liebermann and the Idea in Art|last=Frank|first=Mitchell B.|publisher=Carleton University|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}</ref>\n[[File:Edvard Munch - The dance of life (1899-1900).jpg|alt=Edvard Munch Painting|thumb|267x267px|Painting by Edvard Munch, \"The Dance of Life\", 1899-1900. ]]\nThis way of thinking about German art can explain the differences in art styles of the Berlin secession. Expressionistic artists like Emil Nolde and Edvard Munch were exhibiting with artists who stayed closer to ideas of German Modernism and Impressionism, like Max Liebermann and Walter Leistikow. Although they had artistic differences, they were all painting from the ideas and the thoughts they had at the time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Emil Nolde: Artist of the Elements|last=King|first=Averil|publisher=Philip Wilson Publishers|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Conflicts and Splits ===\nThe Berlin Secession had developed from the [[countermovement]] to the recognized size of the art business. Many important artists were active or joined, in 1906 it was [[August Kraus]], in 1907 it was [[Max Beckmann]], [[Bernhard Pankok]], [[Hans Purrmann]], and [[Emil Rudolf Wei\u00df]], 1908 [[Ernst Barlach]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]] and [[Emil Orl\u00edk]], 1909 [[Lyonel Feininger]], 1910 Rudolf Grossmann and 1911 Hans Meid. Around 1909, the Berlin Secession consisted of 97 members. There was still criticism from conservative circles, who consider the Berlin [[impressionism]] as decadent and a threat to German art, such as the nationalist Werdandi-Bund. From an artistic point of view, the Secession was very tolerant, even towards opposing positions: none of the representatives of the Secession, who were close to German impressionism, viewed [[Paul Baum (artist)|Paul Baum]]'s approach to [[pointillism]] in the style of French [[Post-Impressionism]] as negative.\n\nThe success was accompanied by economic interests and the despotic behavior of the art dealer Paul Cassirer. Thus, it is narrated by [[Emil Nolde]] that Cassirer called the artists his slaves. In particular, artists who had no chance to exhibit at Cassirer, believe in the exhibition of the Secession to have disadvantages.\n\nAfter 27 mostly Expressionist artists had been rejected by the jury, it came in 1910 to withdraw, including Max Beckmann. On the initiative of [[Georg Tappert]], [[Heinrich Richter|Heinrich Richter-Berlin]] and others, including [[Otto Mueller]] and [[Max Pechstein]], through whom the Dresdner K\u00fcnstlergruppe Br\u00fccke was added, formed a new group, the Neue Secession. In May she opened her first exhibition \"Rejected of the Secession Berlin 1910\". Pechstein was elected president, Tappert chairman. After a fierce dispute by Emil Nolde against President Max Liebermann, Nolde was expelled from the Secession, and a little later Liebermann and his closest associates resigned from office. The successor of Liebermann 1911 Lovis Corinth. After he suffered a stroke, he could no longer perform the office.\n\nNumerous artists were dependent on the sales of the art dealers Bruno and [[Paul Cassirer]], sometimes even denied their livelihood through this way.<ref>''Der Fall Corinth und die Zeitzeugen'', Wellner, S.&nbsp;140</ref> Paul Cassirer ran and was elected the first chairman. He organized the summer exhibition of 1913. Although this was very successful, he had also 13 (mostly younger) members who cannot be exhibited. They then organized their own exhibition and did not follow the call to leave the Secession. To solve the problems, u met. a. [[Max Naumann|Max Neumann]], [[Ernst Oppler]], Adolph Herstein and Max Liebermann in his studio. They agreed on a desegregation Cassirers on June 6, 1913. Oppler held the scene in his work consultation in the studio. Art criticism interpreted the picture as planning the break with Cassirer. In fact, the depicted persons [[Hermann Struck]], Emil Pottner, Ernst Bischoff-Culm, Max Neumann and Herstein, along with Corinth, were the members who remained loyal to the Secession.<ref>[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/dkd1928/0112 ''Die Berliner Secession in neuem Hause''.] Bei: Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Heidelberg</ref> Although Lovis Corinth took over again, the break was unstoppable. Around 40 artists left the Secession, including Slevogt and Liebermann and even Paul Cassirer. In March 1914, some of the departed founded the existing until 1924 Free Secession with Max Liebermann as Honorary President. A little later, the \" Juryfreie Kunstausstellung \" opened, which allowed a picture market entirely without a jury, art dealers and groupings. Oppler did not resign from the Secession but renounced in the future to participate in the annual exhibitions of the now approaching [[Expressionism]] Berlin Secessionists.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-1986-0718-501,_Geb\u00e4ude_der_Berliner_Sezession.jpg|thumb|Building of the Berlin Secession in Tiergartenstra\u00dfe 21a]]\n\n=== A National Influence ===\nThe Berlin Secession was extremely successful after the incident at the Saint Louis International Exposition.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|title=Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture, 1890=1918|last=Bilski|first=Emily D.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=49}}</ref> The recognition they developed for themselves allowed their influence over German art to increase, bringing the term 'German Impressionism' into use. This was the style that was most closely associated with the Secession. It also allowed the middle class of Berlin to get a foothold into German art, as the liberal ideals of the movement opened doors for those of a lower class to learn new vocations within the art world. Even those who opposed the viewpoint of the Secession members benefited from their existence. Art created in opposition to the movement also had its own brand of popularity.\n\nHowever, that being said, the Berlin Secession capitalized well on the division between perspectives. The most popular artists at the time were almost all associated with art that didn't fit in the traditional mold of the Academy. The power in the Secession was the fact that it allowed multiple styles to exist in the same space- unlike the Academy, which demanded only one to be adhered to. Journals like Die Kunsthalle, that wrote in opposition to the Secession, went out of business.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Berlin Secession|last1=Paret|first1=Peter|date=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=156-164}}</ref>\n\nThe Emperor, up until this point, had either let the Secession work as it will, or mildly supported it. He viewed change as a good thing, and it had been politically beneficial for him to allow it to develop. Nonetheless, he constantly attempted to interfere with matters like the jury of the salon, which caused conflicts in the art community. While having little power in many aspects of the governing of an autocratic society, the Emperor did have some influence in the cultural sphere. This made him an important factor in the Secession's public and financial success. <br />\n=== Berlin Secession During National-Socialism ===\n[[File:Gedenktafel_Berliner_Secession.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque for the Berlin Secession on [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]] 208]]\nThe First World War created a negative impact on the Secession. The cultural policy} during {the period of National Socialism led to a lasting damage that made the once influential artists' association meaningless.\n\nAfter the \" seizure of power \" of the National Socialists in February 1933, a new board was elected, which included, among others, Max Pechstein, [[Eugene Spiro]], Magnus Zeller, Hans Purrmann, Bruno Krauskopf and [[Rudolf Belling]]. At the meeting of March 10, 1933, Pechstein spoke about the position of some members of the Secession, and emphasized that no policy should be carried into the Secession. A week later, however, the possible cooperation with the Nazi regime and the [[Kampfbund]] for German culture was discussed. Eugene Spiro resigned from his position on the Executive Board, and further withdrawals were made in April 1933. At an important meeting on April 25, 1933, Pechstein read a statement to the government in which the Berlin Secession undertook to help build the new Germany. Emil van Hauth, a member of the Secession since 1932, read a program he had designed that was in the spirit of the National Socialist Kampfbund. Accordingly, Jewish artists and those who were disparagingly called Bolshevik were no longer allowed to be members of German artists' associations. At the same time he called for a transformation of the Secession in the sense of the new state and its so-called German art. The bill was accepted by 27 votes to 2 with one abstention.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture, 1890-1918|last=Bilski|first=Emily D.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=51-52}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, the statutes were changed, and on May 2, Emil van Hauth, Artur Degener and Philipp Harth were elected to the new board. All three were members of the [[Kampfbund]] for German Culture. At a meeting in the Prussian Ministry of Culture, as it later turned out, van Hauth vilified the Secession as an assembly with a Marxist attitude and wanted to achieve dissolution. In the Secession van Hauth, on the other hand, reported that the Berlin Secession was no longer wanted by the government and that a dissolution by the Gestapo was possible. On June 16, 1933, the board was expanded, but no chairman elected. Emil van Hauth resigned from the community on September 28, 1933. On October 12, 1933, the liquidation of the association was discussed, which, however, many artists who were interested in the continued existence, rejected.\n\nAt a further appointment in the Ministry of Culture, the board member Adolf Str\u00fcbe managed to convince the responsible speaker that there had never been anti-state or political tendencies on the part of the artist community and that the association was loyal to the Hitler government. In April 1934, [[Ernst Barlach]], Lyonel Feininger and [[Erich Heckel]] were elected to the community. The logbook was conducted from 1915 to 19 April 1934. In a document, a page of the Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger of January 26, 1936, is reported by the annual meeting of the Berlin Secession, where Adolf Str\u00fcbe was re-elected chairman, as his deputy painter Franz Lenk was determined. The sculptor Ernesto de Fiori and Herbert Garbe also belonged to the board. Lenk and Fiori were artists of the new objectivity. Garbe, the first member of the November Group, joined the NSDAP in 1933. Presumably, the Berlin Secession continued even after 1936.\n\n=== Lasting Effects and Jewish Influence ===\n[[File:Max Liebermann 48.jpg|alt=Max Liebermann|thumb|Max Liebermann, age 48.]]\nThe Berlin Secession opened cultural, political, and class doors that paved the way for Germany to have, briefly, a spot in the artistic limelight before WWII. While being mostly associated Modernism, it created a space where later Expressionists could integrate themselves into, even after the dissolution of the Secession members. Many of the patrons and artists were of wealthy Jewish descent, and while they were specifically targeted during WWII, the ideas they shared during the Secession have survived long after. The Berlin Secession also had leaders within the Jewish community, like Max Liebermann, who was the initial president.<ref name=\":04\">{{Cite book|title=Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture, 1890=1918|last=Bilski|first=Emily D.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=49}}</ref> The secession was a space where people coming from different backgrounds could work together to influence a new culture.\n\n== Notable members ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Hans Baluschek]] (1870\u20131935)\n* [[Ernst Barlach]] (1870\u20131938)\n* [[Paul Baum (artist)|Paul Baum]] (1859\u20131932)\n* [[Max Beckmann]] (1884\u20131950)\n* [[Charlotte Berend-Corinth]] (1880\u20131967)\n* [[Josef Block]] (1863\u20131943)\n* [[Martin Brandenburg]] (1870\u20131919)\n* [[Erich B\u00fcttner (painter)|Erich B\u00fcttner]] (1889\u20131936)\n* [[Lovis Corinth]] (1858\u20131925)\n* {{ill|Anna Costenoble|de}} (1863\u20131930)\n* [[Charles Crodel]] (1894\u20131973)\n* {{ill|Heinrich Harry Deierling|de}} (1894\u20131989)\n* [[Ludwig Dettmann]] (1865\u20131944)\n* {{ill|Adolph Eckhardt|de}} (1868\u20131942)\n* {{ill|Otto Heinrich Engel|de}} (1866\u20131949)\n* [[Lyonel Feininger]] (1871\u20131956)\n* [[Philipp Franck]] (1860\u20131944)\n* [[Oskar Frenzel]] (1855\u20131915)\n* {{ill|Oswald Galle|de}} (1868\u20131935)\n* [[August Gaul]] (1869\u20131921)\n* [[Robert Genin]] (1884\u20131941)\n* [[Rudolf Gro\u00dfmann]] (1882\u20131941)\n* [[Hugo von Habermann]] (1849\u20131929)\n* [[Karl Hagemeister]] (1848\u20131933)\n* [[Theodor Hagen (artist)|Theodor Hagen]] (1842\u20131919)\n* {{ill|Philipp Harth|de}} (1885\u20131968)\n* {{ill|Emil van Hauth|de}} (1899\u20131974)\n* [[Erich Heckel]] (1883\u20131970)\n* {{ill|Franz Heckendorf|de}} (1888\u20131962)\n* [[Adolf Edward Herstein]] (1869\u20131932)\n* [[Curt Herrmann]] (1854\u20131929)\n* [[Dora Hitz]] (1856\u20131924)\n* [[Ferdinand Hodler]] (1853\u20131918)\n* {{ill|Richard Hohly|de}} (1902\u20131995)\n* [[Ulrich H\u00fcbner]] (1872\u20131932)\n* [[Willy Jaeckel]] (1888\u20131944)\n* {{ill|Franz M.

November 2010</ref> was an artistic movement founded in [[Germany]] on May 2, 1898, with the intention of demonstrating art that was contradictory to typical standards set by the academy. The movement was considered a part of German [[Modernism]], and was in part thanks to the boom of growth in [[Berlin]] at the time, as well as addressing the need for alternative groups within the artistic community.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture, 1890=1918|last=Bilski|first=Emily D.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=51-53}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Rise and Reign of the Secession ===\nThe upheavals that led to the formation of the Berlin Secession began in 1891 on the occasion of the Great International Art Exhibition in Berlin. A dispute began after the commission of the Association of Berlin Artists rejected images done by [[Edvard Munch]]. In May 1898, under the leadership of [[Walter Leistikow]], [[Franz Skarbina]] and [[Max Liebermann]], various artists converged to form a \"free association for the organization of artistic exhibitions\". This group was governed by a President, [[Max Liebermann]]<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture, 1890=1918|last=Bilski|first=Emily D.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=49}}</ref>, and a Secretary, Walter Leistikow, along with an executive committee. At the time of its inception, there was a total of 65 members, including both men and women as full members. All those involved in the Secession followed a constitution that defined terms of involvement in the group, and nothing could be changed without a three-fourths majority from the committee.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Berlin Secession|last1=Paret|first1=Peter|date=1980|publisher=Library of Congress|page=59}}</ref> The Free Union of the XXIV was founded in [[Munich]] and exhibited under this name in [[Berlin]].\n\nThere were a variety of causes that led to the break in German art:\n\nIn November 1892, a scandal occurred when an Edvard Munch exhibition was closed by a majority of the members of the Association of Berlin Artists. They described Munch's as \"repugnant, ugly and mean\". Other artists in favor of Munch, however, were not yet organized enough to leave the established exhibition system of the Academy.\n\nLater, in 1898, the jury of the Great Berlin Art Exhibition rejected a landscape painting by the painter [[Walter Leistikow]]. Now the proof was finally provided that the \"modern art\" of the rising artists had no support from the Academy. This was the final act of momentum needed to organize the secession. The president at the time, Max Liebermann, gave some demands to the Secession at the Great Berlin Art Exhibition in 1899. He asked that the secession receive quality space, no less than 8 rooms worth, with an independent jury and committee. However, the demand was refused on the grounds of having excessive conditions for such a small group. After delegations, a compromise was met, still favoring independence from the rest of the exhibitions, but fewer rooms.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Berlin Secession|last1=Paret|first1=Peter|date=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=62}}</ref>\n\nLiebermann recruited the art dealers [[Bruno Cassirer|Bruno]] and [[Paul Cassirer]] and offered them to become executive secretaries of the Secession. They joined in 1899 and together had a seat on the board but without voting rights. They were responsible for the planning and execution of the building, which was built according to plans by [[Hans Grisebach]] at Kantstra\u00dfe 12 (corner Fasanenstra\u00dfe).\n\nThe split in German art was, incidentally, extremely well-accepted in the political sphere. There had been unrest in conservative groups towards the mixture of art in the annual salon. They believed immoral art should not be mingled in the same space as more traditional art, and they criticized the inclusion of foreign artists. However, they didn't outright demand their removal, only that they be given their own space to display work. This thinking lined up incredibly well with the wants of the Berlin Secession modernists, and made the split an easy transition for politics.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Berlin Secession|last1=Paret|first1=Peter|date=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=64}}</ref>\n\nOn May 19, 1899, an exhibition of 330 pictures and graphics and 50 sculptures was opened in Charlottenburger Kantstra\u00dfe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/berlin-secession.htm#targetText=The%20first%20exhibition%20of%20the,establishment%20maintained%20an%20uneasy%20coexistence.|title=Berlin Secession: Avant-Garde Artists Group|website=Visual Arts Cork|accessdate=10/12/2019}}</ref> Of the 187 exhibitors, 46 lived in Berlin and 57 in Munich. At this time, foreign contributions were still missing. The audience of 2000 invited guests were impressed and the exhibits were perceived as overcoming the prevailing mediocrity. The event was attended by those of high social standing as well- the audience not only contained the head of the salon, Max Koner, but the President of the Royal Academy, which helped it be perceived as a surprisingly respectable gathering.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Berlin Secession|last1=Paret|first1=Peter|date=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=79-80}}</ref>\n\nAt the second exhibition, the international claim was honored, of which 414 exhibits were over ten percent of foreign artists, including Pissarro, Renoir, Segantini and Whistler. This baffled nationalist circles, so that a conservative minority separated again until 1902 from the Secession. In addition to the summer exhibitions, there were also winter exhibitions reserved for graphics under the title \"Black and White Exhibitions\". At the 1902 exhibition, works by Kandinsky, Manet, Monet and Munch were shown for the first time. For the first time, the trend showed that Berlin Munich declined the rank of art metropolis Germany. When Germany wanted to participate with art in the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904, failed to reach an agreement of the Commission to Anton von Werner and the Emperor with the Berlin Secession.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Berlin Secession|last1=Paret|first1=Peter|date=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=\"German Impressionism and the Conflict Over Art at Saint Louis\"}}</ref>\n\nIn 1905, the relocation to the then-new larger building on [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]] 208, the place where today the theater on Kurf\u00fcrstendamm is located.

Among the visitors were [[Max Slevogt]], [[Georg Kolbe]], [[Fritz Klimsch]] and Ernst Oppler, as well as representatives of the press.<ref>''Museums Journal'', Nr. 11, Ausgabe 25, S.&nbsp;38, 1997</ref> The ballet and the tennis courts were among the most popular motifs of the Berlin Secession.\n\n=== Artistic Style and Influence ===\nThe style of German art at the time was closely influenced by France, whether or not you were attempting to replicate the French style or distance yourself from it. During the late Imperial period, from around 1888 to around 1918, ideas of nationalism and a political interest in art became more popularized. Germans were interested in what it meant to be German, and what it meant to have a cultural identity through artistic style. People wanted Germany to have an individual artistic identity. France had influenced the artistic world in Germany for so long, but at this point, both artists and consumers had begun to reject what was called French Naturalism, and garnering more interest in German Idealism. A member of the Berlin Secession, Karl Scheffler, categorized the differences in the artistic styles, perception and conception. Perception dictated painting of the natural world and what was physical around you. This was seen as the French way of art. Germans were conceptual painters, who took ideas and gave them form, and preferred to gain inspiration from their own thoughts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Painterly Thought: Max Liebermann and the Idea in Art|last=Frank|first=Mitchell B.|publisher=Carleton University|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}</ref>\n[[File:Edvard Munch - The dance of life (1899-1900).jpg|alt=Edvard Munch Painting|thumb|267x267px|Painting by Edvard Munch, \"The Dance of Life\", 1899-1900. ]]\nThis way of thinking about German art can explain the differences in art styles of the Berlin secession. Expressionistic artists like Emil Nolde and Edvard Munch were exhibiting with artists who stayed closer to ideas of German Modernism and Impressionism, like Max Liebermann and Walter Leistikow. Although they had artistic differences, they were all painting from the ideas and the thoughts they had at the time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Emil Nolde: Artist of the Elements|last=King|first=Averil|publisher=Philip Wilson Publishers|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Conflicts and Splits ===\nThe Berlin Secession had developed from the [[countermovement]] to the recognized size of the art business. Many important artists were active or joined, in 1906 it was [[August Kraus]], in 1907 it was [[Max Beckmann]], [[Bernhard Pankok]], [[Hans Purrmann]], and [[Emil Rudolf Wei\u00df]], 1908 [[Ernst Barlach]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]] and [[Emil Orl\u00edk]], 1909 [[Lyonel Feininger]], 1910 Rudolf Grossmann and 1911 Hans Meid. Around 1909, the Berlin Secession consisted of 97 members. There was still criticism from conservative circles, who consider the Berlin [[impressionism]] as decadent and a threat to German art, such as the nationalist Werdandi-Bund. From an artistic point of view, the Secession was very tolerant, even towards opposing positions: none of the representatives of the Secession, who were close to German impressionism, viewed [[Paul Baum (artist)|Paul Baum]]'s approach to [[pointillism]] in the style of French [[Post-Impressionism]] as negative.\n\nThe success was accompanied by economic interests and the despotic behavior of the art dealer Paul Cassirer. Thus, it is narrated by [[Emil Nolde]] that Cassirer called the artists his slaves. In particular, artists who had no chance to exhibit at Cassirer, believe in the exhibition of the Secession to have disadvantages.\n\nAfter 27 mostly Expressionist artists had been rejected by the jury, it came in 1910 to withdraw, including Max Beckmann. On the initiative of [[Georg Tappert]], [[Heinrich Richter|Heinrich Richter-Berlin]] and others, including [[Otto Mueller]] and [[Max Pechstein]], through whom the Dresdner K\u00fcnstlergruppe Br\u00fccke was added, formed a new group, the Neue Secession. In May she opened her first exhibition \"Rejected of the Secession Berlin 1910\". Pechstein was elected president, Tappert chairman. After a fierce dispute by Emil Nolde against President Max Liebermann, Nolde was expelled from the Secession, and a little later Liebermann and his closest associates resigned from office. The successor of Liebermann 1911 Lovis Corinth. After he suffered a stroke, he could no longer perform the office.\n\nNumerous artists were dependent on the sales of the art dealers Bruno and [[Paul Cassirer]], sometimes even denied their livelihood through this way.<ref>''Der Fall Corinth und die Zeitzeugen'', Wellner, S.&nbsp;140</ref> Paul Cassirer ran and was elected the first chairman. He organized the summer exhibition of 1913. Although this was very successful, he had also 13 (mostly younger) members who cannot be exhibited. They then organized their own exhibition and did not follow the call to leave the Secession. To solve the problems, u met. a. [[Max Naumann|Max Neumann]], [[Ernst Oppler]], Adolph Herstein and Max Liebermann in his studio. They agreed on a desegregation Cassirers on June 6, 1913. Oppler held the scene in his work consultation in the studio. Art criticism interpreted the picture as planning the break with Cassirer. In fact, the depicted persons [[Hermann Struck]], Emil Pottner, Ernst Bischoff-Culm, Max Neumann and Herstein, along with Corinth, were the members who remained loyal to the Secession.<ref>[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/dkd1928/0112 ''Die Berliner Secession in neuem Hause''.] Bei: Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Heidelberg</ref> Although Lovis Corinth took over again, the break was unstoppable. Around 40 artists left the Secession, including Slevogt and Liebermann and even Paul Cassirer. In March 1914, some of the departed founded the existing until 1924 Free Secession with Max Liebermann as Honorary President. A little later, the \" Juryfreie Kunstausstellung \" opened, which allowed a picture market entirely without a jury, art dealers and groupings. Oppler did not resign from the Secession but renounced in the future to participate in the annual exhibitions of the now approaching [[Expressionism]] Berlin Secessionists.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-1986-0718-501,_Geb\u00e4ude_der_Berliner_Sezession.jpg|thumb|Building of the Berlin Secession in Tiergartenstra\u00dfe 21a]]\n\n=== A National Influence ===\nThe Berlin Secession was extremely successful after the incident at the Saint Louis International Exposition.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|title=Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture, 1890=1918|last=Bilski|first=Emily D.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=49}}</ref> The recognition they developed for themselves allowed their influence over German art to increase, bringing the term 'German Impressionism' into use. This was the style that was most closely associated with the Secession. It also allowed the middle class of Berlin to get a foothold into German art, as the liberal ideals of the movement opened doors for those of a lower class to learn new vocations within the art world. Even those who opposed the viewpoint of the Secession members benefited from their existence. Art created in opposition to the movement also had its own brand of popularity.\n\nHowever, that being said, the Berlin Secession capitalized well on the division between perspectives. The most popular artists at the time were almost all associated with art that didn't fit in the traditional mold of the Academy. The power in the Secession was the fact that it allowed multiple styles to exist in the same space- unlike the Academy, which demanded only one to be adhered to. Journals like Die Kunsthalle, that wrote in opposition to the Secession, went out of business.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Berlin Secession|last1=Paret|first1=Peter|date=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=156-164}}</ref>\n\nThe Emperor, up until this point, had either let the Secession work as it will, or mildly supported it. He viewed change as a good thing, and it had been politically beneficial for him to allow it to develop. Nonetheless, he constantly attempted to interfere with matters like the jury of the salon, which caused conflicts in the art community. While having little power in many aspects of the governing of an autocratic society, the Emperor did have some influence in the cultural sphere. This made him an important factor in the Secession's public and financial success. <br />\n=== Berlin Secession During National-Socialism ===\n[[File:Gedenktafel_Berliner_Secession.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque for the Berlin Secession on [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]] 208]]\nThe First World War created a negative impact on the Secession. The cultural policy} during {the period of National Socialism led to a lasting damage that made the once influential artists' association meaningless.\n\nAfter the \" seizure of power \" of the National Socialists in February 1933, a new board was elected, which included, among others, Max Pechstein, [[Eugene Spiro]], Magnus Zeller, Hans Purrmann, Bruno Krauskopf and [[Rudolf Belling]]. At the meeting of March 10, 1933, Pechstein spoke about the position of some members of the Secession, and emphasized that no policy should be carried into the Secession. A week later, however, the possible cooperation with the Nazi regime and the [[Kampfbund]] for German culture was discussed. Eugene Spiro resigned from his position on the Executive Board, and further withdrawals were made in April 1933. At an important meeting on April 25, 1933, Pechstein read a statement to the government in which the Berlin Secession undertook to help build the new Germany. Emil van Hauth, a member of the Secession since 1932, read a program he had designed that was in the spirit of the National Socialist Kampfbund. Accordingly, Jewish artists and those who were disparagingly called Bolshevik were no longer allowed to be members of German artists' associations. At the same time he called for a transformation of the Secession in the sense of the new state and its so-called German art. The bill was accepted by 27 votes to 2 with one abstention.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture, 1890-1918|last=Bilski|first=Emily D.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=51-52}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, the statutes were changed, and on May 2, Emil van Hauth, Artur Degener and Philipp Harth were elected to the new board. All three were members of the [[Kampfbund]] for German Culture. At a meeting in the Prussian Ministry of Culture, as it later turned out, van Hauth vilified the Secession as an assembly with a Marxist attitude and wanted to achieve dissolution. In the Secession van Hauth, on the other hand, reported that the Berlin Secession was no longer wanted by the government and that a dissolution by the Gestapo was possible. On June 16, 1933, the board was expanded, but no chairman elected. Emil van Hauth resigned from the community on September 28, 1933. On October 12, 1933, the liquidation of the association was discussed, which, however, many artists who were interested in the continued existence, rejected.\n\nAt a further appointment in the Ministry of Culture, the board member Adolf Str\u00fcbe managed to convince the responsible speaker that there had never been anti-state or political tendencies on the part of the artist community and that the association was loyal to the Hitler government. In April 1934, [[Ernst Barlach]], Lyonel Feininger and [[Erich Heckel]] were elected to the community. The logbook was conducted from 1915 to 19 April 1934. In a document, a page of the Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger of January 26, 1936, is reported by the annual meeting of the Berlin Secession, where Adolf Str\u00fcbe was re-elected chairman, as his deputy painter Franz Lenk was determined. The sculptor Ernesto de Fiori and Herbert Garbe also belonged to the board. Lenk and Fiori were artists of the new objectivity. Garbe, the first member of the November Group, joined the NSDAP in 1933. Presumably, the Berlin Secession continued even after 1936.\n\n=== Lasting Effects and Jewish Influence ===\n[[File:Max Liebermann 48.jpg|alt=Max Liebermann|thumb|Max Liebermann, age 48.]]\nThe Berlin Secession opened cultural, political, and class doors that paved the way for Germany to have, briefly, a spot in the artistic limelight before WWII. While being mostly associated Modernism, it created a space where later Expressionists could integrate themselves into, even after the dissolution of the Secession members. Many of the patrons and artists were of wealthy Jewish descent, and while they were specifically targeted during WWII, the ideas they shared during the Secession have survived long after. The Berlin Secession also had leaders within the Jewish community, like Max Liebermann, who was the initial president.<ref name=\":04\">{{Cite book|title=Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture, 1890=1918|last=Bilski|first=Emily D.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=49}}</ref> The secession was a space where people coming from different backgrounds could work together to influence a new culture.\n\n== Notable members ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Hans Baluschek]] (1870\u20131935)\n* [[Ernst Barlach]] (1870\u20131938)\n* [[Paul Baum (artist)|Paul Baum]] (1859\u20131932)\n* [[Max Beckmann]] (1884\u20131950)\n* [[Charlotte Berend-Corinth]] (1880\u20131967)\n* [[Josef Block]] (1863\u20131943)\n* [[Martin Brandenburg]] (1870\u20131919)\n* [[Erich B\u00fcttner (painter)|Erich B\u00fcttner]] (1889\u20131936)\n* [[Lovis Corinth]] (1858\u20131925)\n* {{ill|Anna Costenoble|de}} (1863\u20131930)\n* [[Charles Crodel]] (1894\u20131973)\n* {{ill|Heinrich Harry Deierling|de}} (1894\u20131989)\n* [[Ludwig Dettmann]] (1865\u20131944)\n* {{ill|Adolph Eckhardt|de}} (1868\u20131942)\n* {{ill|Otto Heinrich Engel|de}} (1866\u20131949)\n* [[Lyonel Feininger]] (1871\u20131956)\n* [[Philipp Franck]] (1860\u20131944)\n* [[Oskar Frenzel]] (1855\u20131915)\n* {{ill|Oswald Galle|de}} (1868\u20131935)\n* [[August Gaul]] (1869\u20131921)\n* [[Robert Genin]] (1884\u20131941)\n* [[Rudolf Gro\u00dfmann]] (1882\u20131941)\n* [[Hugo von Habermann]] (1849\u20131929)\n* [[Karl Hagemeister]] (1848\u20131933)\n* [[Theodor Hagen (artist)|Theodor Hagen]] (1842\u20131919)\n* {{ill|Philipp Harth|de}} (1885\u20131968)\n* {{ill|Emil van Hauth|de}} (1899\u20131974)\n* [[Erich Heckel]] (1883\u20131970)\n* {{ill|Franz Heckendorf|de}} (1888\u20131962)\n* [[Adolf Edward Herstein]] (1869\u20131932)\n* [[Curt Herrmann]] (1854\u20131929)\n* [[Dora Hitz]] (1856\u20131924)\n* [[Ferdinand Hodler]] (1853\u20131918)\n* {{ill|Richard Hohly|de}} (1902\u20131995)\n* [[Ulrich H\u00fcbner]] (1872\u20131932)\n* [[Willy Jaeckel]] (1888\u20131944)\n* {{ill|Franz M.

Gymnasts are judged on their artistry, execution of skills, and difficulty of skills, for which they gain points. They perform leaps, balances, pivots, and flexibility movements, along with tossing, catching, rolling and otherwise manipulating the apparatus.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:Yevgeniya Kanayeva.jpg|right|thumb|230px|2 time Olympic Champion [[Yevgeniya Kanayeva|Evgenia Kanaeva]] ([[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London]])]]\n\nRhythmic gymnastics grew out of the ideas of [[Jean-Georges Noverre]] (1727\u20131810), [[Fran\u00e7ois Delsarte]] (1811\u20131871), and [[:de:Rudolf Bode|Rudolf Bode]] (1881\u20131970), who all believed in movement expression, where one used dance to express oneself and exercise various body parts. [[Pehr Henrik Ling|Peter Henry Ling]] further developed this idea in his 19th-century [[Sweden|Swedish]] system of free exercise, which promoted \"aesthetic gymnastics\", in which students expressed their feelings and emotions through body movement. This idea was extended by [[Catharine Beecher]], who founded the Western Female Institute in [[Ohio]], United States, in 1837. In Beecher's gymnastics program, called dance without dancing\", the young women exercised to music, moving from simple [[calisthenics]] to more strenuous activities.\n\nDuring the 1880s, [[\u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze]] of Switzerland developed [[eurhythmics]], a form of physical training for musicians and dancers. [[George Demeny]] of France created exercises to music that were designed to promote grace of movement, muscular flexibility, and good posture. All of these styles were combined around 1900 into the Swedish school of rhythmic gymnastics, which would later add dance elements from [[Finland]]. Around this time, Ernst Idla of [[Estonia]] established a [[degree of difficulty]] for each movement. In 1929, Hinrich Medau founded The Medau School in Berlin to train gymnasts in \"modern gymnastics\", and to develop the use of the apparatus.\n\nCompetitive rhythmic gymnastics began in the 1940s in the [[Soviet Union]]. The FIG formally recognized this discipline in 1961, first as '''modern gymnastics''', then as '''rhythmic sportive gymnastics''', and finally as '''rhythmic gymnastics'''. The first World Championships for individual rhythmic gymnasts was held in 1963 in [[Budapest]]. Groups were introduced at the same level in 1967 in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark. Rhythmic gymnastics was added to the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]], with an individual all-around competition. However, many federations from the [[Eastern Europe]]an countries were forced to [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] by the Soviet Union. Canadian [[Lori Fung]] was the first rhythmic gymnast to earn an Olympic gold medal. The group competition was added to the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta. The Spanish team won the first gold medal of the new competition with a team formed by [[Estela Gim\u00e9nez]], [[Marta Bald\u00f3]], [[Nuria Cabanillas]], [[Lorena Gur\u00e9ndez]], [[Est\u00edbaliz Mart\u00ednez]] and [[Tania Lamarca]].\n\n==The gymnast==\n[[File:Medalistswaving-syd2000-600pxl.JPG|left|thumb|(L-R) [[Alina Kabaeva]] (bronze), [[Yulia Barsukova]] (gold) and [[Yulia Raskina]] (silver) at [[2000 Sydney Olympics]]]]\n\nOlympic rhythmic gymnastics is only for female participants. Japan has begun developing programs in which men can compete. Also in Spain, men are allowed to participate in the women's competition. The men's program has yet to be formally recognized by the FIG, however, and men cannot compete in the Olympics as a rhythmic gymnast. Gymnasts start at a young age and become age-eligible to compete in the Olympic Games and other major international competitions on January 1 of their 16th year (For example, a gymnast born on 12-31-2004 would be age eligible for the 2020 Olympics). Gymnasts in Russia and Europe typically start training at a very young age and those at their peak are typically in their late teens (15\u201319) or early twenties, but since 2004 it is common to see gymnasts achieving their peak after reaching their twenties.\n\nTop rhythmic gymnasts must have many qualities; balance, flexibility, coordination, and strength are some of the most important. They also must possess psychological attributes such as the ability to compete under intense pressure, in which one mistake can cost them the title, and the discipline and work ethic to practice the same skills over and over again.\n\nCurrently a gymnast can perform in the individual event or in the group event. They perform routines in 12 x 12 meter areas, accompanied by music (recorded or played by musician(s)). Since 1995, groups are consisted of 5 gymnasts, but originally six gymnasts composed a group, although around the 1980s this could be even eight. The duration of a group exercise should be two and a half minutes, one minute more than the individual one, which is one minute and a half.\n\n==Apparatus==\nThe FIG selects which apparatus will be used in competitions, only four out of the five possible apparatuses are sanctioned. Hoop and rope were the first apparatus used at World Championships, followed later by ball, ribbon and clubs. For 2011, [[Rope (rhythmic gymnastics)|rope]] was dropped for senior national individual and group competition. In 2011, it was to be dropped for junior national individual competition but returned again in 2015. Rope appeared in junior national group competition in 2011&ndash;2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,5187-192704-209927-142566-0-file,00.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123070651/http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,5187-192704-209927-142566-0-file,00.pdf|url-status=dead|title=FIG Rhythmic Gymnastics Apparatus Programme - Olympic Cycles 2009\u20132016|archivedate=November 23, 2009}}</ref>  In 2017, rope appeared in senior group competition. Freehand was an event for the four first World Championships before being dropped and only used in local competitions, usually for the youngest levels.\n\nSince 2011, senior individual gymnasts perform four different routines with hoop, ball, clubs and ribbon. Senior group performed two different routines, one with a single apparatus and one with mixed apparatus (for example, a routine with 5 hoop and a routine with 3 balls / 2 ropes). For junior individual gymnasts, the FIG selects four out of the five possible apparatuses. Junior groups performed two different routines with two different types of apparatus (for example, a routine with 5 hoops and a routine with 5 ribbons). As of 2017 rhythmic gymnastics equipment used in F.I.G. sanctioned events must come have the F.I.G. logo on the apparatus.\n\n[[File:M\u00f3nica Ferr\u00e1ndez 1990 Goteborg.PNG|right|thumb|100px|M\u00f3nica Ferr\u00e1ndez with a rope]]\n\n;[[Rope (rhythmic gymnastics)|Rope]]: It may be made of hemp or a synthetic material that retains the qualities of lightness and suppleness. Its length is in proportion to the size of the gymnast. When the middle of the rope is held down by the feet, both ends should reach the gymnasts' armpits. One or two knots at each end are for keeping hold of the rope while doing the routine. At the ends (to the exclusion of all other parts of the rope) an anti-slip material, either coloured or neutral may cover a maximum of {{convert|10.0|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The rope must be colored, either all or partially. It may be either of a uniform diameter or be progressively thicker in the center provided that this thickening is of the same material as the rope. The fundamental requirements of a rope routine include leaps and skipping. Other elements include swings, throws, circles, rotations and figures of eight. Since 2011, the [[International Federation of Gymnastics|FIG]] decided to nullify the use of rope in senior individual rhythmic gymnastics competitions. Before 2013, jumps and leaps were the Compulsory Body Movement Groups (dominant in the exercise). \n\nCustomization: Ropes can be color dyed. It is not common practice because the majority of the paints are water-based and can start coming off with sweat[[File:YussupovaHoop.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Aliya Yussupova with a hoop]]\n; [[Hoop (rhythmic gymnastics)|Hoop]]:A hoop may be made of plastic or wood, provided that it retains its shape during the routine. The hoop is chosen based on the gymnast's size and should not extend beyond the hip bone when placed standing up on the floor. The interior diameter is from 51 to 90&nbsp;cm and the hoop must weigh a minimum of 300g. Children and hope divisions, a minimum of 225 grams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://usagym.org/PDFs/Rhythmic/Junior%20Olympics/1617handbook.pdf|title=U.S.A.G.

Fundamental requirements of a hoop routine include rotation around the hand or body and rolling, as well as swings, circles, throws, and passes through and over the hoop.\n\nCustomization: Hoops are often customized using colored tapes to match the design of the leotards. As of 2017 F.I.G.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Gymnastics_Federation|title=International Gymnastics Federation|last=F.I.G.|first=|date=|website=Wikipedia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=November 2019}} sanctioned events must [[File:Margarita Mamun Universiade 2013.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Margarita Mamun with a ball]]\n\n; [[Ball (rhythmic gymnastics)|Ball]]:It is made of either rubber or synthetic material (pliable plastic) provided it possesses the same elasticity as rubber. Senior and junior gymnasts is 18 to 20&nbsp;cm in diameter and must have a minimum weight of 400g. The ball can be of any color. The ball should rest in the gymnast's hand and not rest against the wrist or be able to be grasped. Fundamental elements of a ball routine include throwing, bouncing or rolling. The gymnast must use both hands and work on the whole floor area whilst showing continuous flowing movement. The ball is to emphasize the gymnasts flowing lines and body difficulty. Before 2013, flexibility and waves were the Compulsory Body Movement Groups (dominant in the exercise).\n[[File:Arancha Marty 1989 Sarajevo.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Arancha Marty with clubs]]\n; [[Juggling club|Clubs]]: Senior and junior clubs must weight a minimum of 150 grams per club. Children's and hope age divisions minimum weight should be 75 grams per club. Multi-piece clubs are the most popular clubs. The club is built along an internal rod, providing a base on which a handle made of [[polyolefin]] plastic is wrapped, providing an airspace between it and the internal rod. This airspace provides flex and cushioning impact, making the club softer on the hands. Foam ends and knobs further cushion the club. Multi-piece clubs are made in both a thin European style or larger bodied American style and in various lengths, generally ranging from {{convert|19|to|21|in|mm|abbr=off}}. The handles and bodies are typically wrapped with decorative plastics and tapes. Clubs are thrown from alternate hands; each passes underneath the other clubs and is caught in the opposite hand to the one from which it was thrown. At its simplest, each club rotates once per throw, the handle moving down and away from the throwing hand at first. However, double and triple spins are frequently performed, allowing the club to be thrown higher for more advanced patterns and to allow tricks such as 360s (channes) to be performed underneath. Before 2013, balances were the Compulsory Body Movement Groups (dominant in the exercise).\n[[File:Viktoria Stadnik.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Viktoria Stadnik with a ribbon]]\n; [[Ribbon (rhythmic gymnastics)|Ribbon]]:It is made of satin or another similar material cloth of any color; it may be multi-colored and have designs on it. The ribbon itself must be at least {{convert|35|g|oz|abbr=on}}, 4\u20136&nbsp;cm (1.6\u20132.4\") in width and have a minimum length of 6m (20') for seniors and 5m (16.25') for juniors. The ribbon must be in one piece. The end that is attached to the stick is doubled for a maximum length of 1m (3'). This is stitched down both sides. At the top, a very thin reinforcement or rows of machine stitching for a maximum length of 5&nbsp;cm is authorized. This extremity may end in a strap, or have an eyelet (a small hole, edged with a buttonhole stitch or metal circle), to permit attaching the ribbon. The ribbon is fixed to the stick by means of a supple attachment such as thread, nylon cord, or a series of articulated rings. The attachment has a maximum length of 7&nbsp;cm (2.8\"), not counting the strap or metal ring at the end of the stick where it will be fastened. Compulsory elements for the ribbon include flicks, circles, snakes and spirals, and throws. It requires a high degree of co-ordination to form the spirals and circles as any knots which may accidentally form in the ribbon are penalized. During a ribbon routine, large, smooth and flowing movements are looked for. The ribbon may not stop moving or else points are taken off. Before 2013, pivots were the Compulsory Body Movement Groups (dominant in the exercise).\n\n==Scoring system==\nIn rhythmic gymnastics competitions exercises are evaluated by the following parameters which are reviewed every four years, the system defining the FIG Code of Points. After each Olympic games, the scoring process is modified.\n\n===Current Code of Points===\nIn the current Code of Points (2017-2020),<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/publicdir/rules/files/en_RG%20CoP%202017-2020%20updated%20with%20changes%20and%20errata%20Dec.%202017%20valid%2001.02.2018.pdf\n|title = RG CoP 2017-2020\n|date = 5 March 2018\n|publisher = International Federation of Gymnastics\n|accessdate = 14 August 2018\n}}</ref> the final score of a routine is the sum of the difficulty score and execution score. Penalties incurred will also be deducted from the final score. The difficulty score is open-ended with no maximum score, while the execution score has a starting value of 10 points. There are also penalties, which are realized by subtracting points from the final note for certain specified mistakes made by the gymnast.\n\n'''Difficulty''' consists of body difficulties (jumps, balances and rotations), dynamic elements with rotation (commonly known as risks) and dance step combinations (for individuals gymnasts and groups), and apparatus difficulties (only for individuals gymnasts) and exchange and collaborations (only for groups). The difficulty score is evaluated during the routine without a pre-made difficulty sheet, unlike with previous Codes. Each difficulty component has an assigned value, which accumulate throughout the routine, resulting in the final difficulty score.\n\n'''Execution''' is the degree to which the gymnast performs with aesthetic and technical perfection. The execution score is composed of artistic faults and technical faults. In the first, the unity and character of the composition, harmony with the music, body expression and the variety in the use of space and apparatus elements, among others are valued; on the other hand, the technical handling of the apparatus (like catching the ball with one hand and not two, not losing the apparatus, etc.) and technical aspects of body movements (like touching the head with the foot during a ring form, not falling, etc.) are valued. Errors regarding the perfect model of conduct accumulate and are assigned specific penalty values, which ultimately are subtracted from the starting value (an execution score of 10 represents a perfect execution equal to the model, without any error).\n\nFinally, '''Penalties''' are taken by the time, line, and coordinator judges. Possible penalties include:\n\n* The gymnast leaving the floor area\n* The apparatus leaving the floor area\n* The exercise being longer or shorter than the acceptable length of time (1'15\" to 1'30\" is the required length for individual, and 2'15\" to 2'30\" is the required length for group)\n* Failure to end the exercise at the exact moment the accompanying music ends\n* Music not conforming to the regulations\n* Dress of the gymnast not conforming to the regulations\n* Communication with the coach during the execution of the exercise\n* Verbal communication between group gymnasts during the exercise\n* Grabbing a new apparatus from the side of the floor\n\n===Evolution of the Code of Points===\nThe first Code of Point was published in 1970. Since then, rhythmics gymnastics has known 14 different codes (1970-1971, 1971-1972, 1973-1976, 1977-1980, 1981-1984, 1985-1988, 1989-1992, 1993-1996, 1997-2000, 2001-2004, 2005-2008, 2009\u20132012, 2013-2016, 2017-2020). Since 1984 and the first appearance at the [[Gymnastics at the 1984 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's rhythmic individual all-around|Olympics]], the Code of Point is renew after each Olympics.\n\nIn the decades of the 60s and 70s, the weight of the note fell most heavily on the artistic side, with little presence of difficulties. In the 80s new difficulty elements were introduced to give greater prominence to the flexibility and risk releases, and to encourage originality with emerging new devices. In 1985 the score was composed of: Composition (Technical + Artistry) was scored on 5 points and Execution was scored on 5 points. In 1997, the Code of Points was subjected to an important change, by separating the score the score between Artistry (on 5 for individual or 6 points group groups), Technical (on 5 points for individuals or 4 points for groups) and Execution (on 10 points), the Total score being given on 10 points for individuals and 20 points for groups.\n\nIn the late 90s, there was an appearance of gymnasts whose exercise flexibility was used as a main element ([[Yana Batyrshina|Yana Batyrchina]] or [[Alina Kabaeva]] for example), which was one of the motivations for a major change in the Code in 2001, which doubled the number of required elements of difficulty (12 maximum during the Olympics cycle 2001-2004 and 18 maximum during the Olympic cycle 2005-2008) and reduced the value of the artistic element, which was now mixed with apparatus difficulty (also known as mastery) and risks. The final mark then was obtained by adding notes Difficulty (or Technical before 2005), Artistry and Execution, each with a maximum value of 10 points, so the final score would be a maximum of 30 points. During the Olympic cycle 2005-2008, the final note would be a maximum of 20 points to join the average grade of Difficulty and Artistry.\n\nIn 2009 the code was subjected to a new important change. The final mark was obtained by adding notes Difficulty (12 difficulties with the body, masteries and risks), Artistry and Execution, each with a maximum value of 10 points, so the final score would be a maximum of 30 points. In 2013, the code introduced the Dance steps combination and an Execution score taking into account both technical and artistic execution. The score then was on 20 points with 10 points for Difficulty (9 difficulties with the body, masteries, 5 risks and dance steps combination) and 10 points for Execution (technical and artistic penalties). The 2017 code was very similar, with a difficulty strictly limited and differences among the best gymnasts heavily determined by the execution. Therefore in 2018, the Difficulty became open for the first time.\n\n==Major competitions==\nAs of 2019, according to the technical regulations defined by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique|International Gymnastics Federation]] (FIG), the only official competitions in which rhythmic gymnastics events are contested globally are: the [[World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]]; the stages of the [[Rhythmic Gymnastics World Cup|World Cup series]] (including the defunct [[FIG World Cup|World Cup Final]] and World Cup qualifiers); the [[Gymnastics at the World Games|World Games]]; and the [[Gymnastics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] (as well as the [[Gymnastics at the Youth Olympic Games|Youth Olympic Games]]).<ref name=reg>{{cite web |url=http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/publicdir/rules/files/en_Technical%20Regulations%202018%20update%20PK.pdf |publisher=[[International Gymnastics Federation]] |title=Technical Regulations 2018 |accessdate=2018-04-22}}</ref> Since 2019, [[Rhythmic Gymnastics Junior World  Championships|Junior World Championships]] are held every two years.\n\nThe nations which have earned at least one medal in official FIG competitions are:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gymnasticsresults.com/|title=Gymnastics Results|website=gymnasticsresults.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gymn-forum.net/results.html|title=Gymn Forum: Results|website=Gymn-forum.net}}</ref>\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=14em|style=-moz-column-count:4; -webkit-column-count:4; column-count:4|\n* {{AZE}}<ref name=rg1>{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-sports.org/gymnastics-world-cup-rhythmic-gymnastics-minsk-results-2013-epr45121.html|title=Gymnastics - World Cup Rhythmic Gymnastics - Minsk 2013 - Results|website=The-sports.org}}</ref>\n* {{BLR}}<ref name=rg1/> \n* {{BRA}}<ref name=rg2>{{Cite web|url=http://rsg.net/cgi-bin/show?events/1999/dtb_bochum_99_g.html|title=11.

The two countries were in rivalry with each other before the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\n=== Soviet Union ===\n[[File:Galima Shugurova 1973.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Galima Shugurova|Galina Shugurova]]]]\nBefore the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, Soviet rhythmic gymnasts were engaged in a fierce competition with [[Bulgaria]]. The first [[World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]] held in 1963 in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] was won by Soviet gymnast [[Ludmila Savinkova]] and in 1967 in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark the first Group Championships was also won by the [[USSR]].\n\nOther Soviet World AA Champions in individuals included [[Elena Karpuchina]], [[Galima Shugurova|Galina Shugurova]] and [[Irina Deriugina]].

Ukraine has won 1 gold and 3 bronze medals at the Olympic Games. If you include all Ukrainian gymnasts, then they have won 2 gold and 4 bronze medals. The mother and daughter tandem of Albina and [[Irina Deriugina]] played an important role in the success of RG in the country, raising stars like [[Olexandra Tymoshenko]] and [[Oxana Skaldina]].\n\nAfter the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]], Ukraine continued its success in rhythmic gymnastics with [[Kateryna Serebrianska]] winning the Olympic gold medal at the [[1996 Atlanta Olympics]].\n\nOther notable gymnasts include [[Anna Bessonova]] (two-time [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] bronze medalist), [[Ganna Rizatdinova]] (2016 Olympics bronze), [[Olena Vitrychenko]] (1996 Olympics bronze), [[Tamara Yerofeeva]], [[Natalia Godunko]], [[Alina Maksymenko]], [[Vlada Nikolchenko]], [[Victoria Stadnik]], [[Olena Dmytrash]], [[Viktoriia Mazur]], [[Valeriia Gudym]], [[Yevgeniya Gomon]], [[Oleksandra Gridasova]], [[Anastasiia Mulmina]], [[Anastasiya Voznyak]], [[Kateryna Lutsenko]] and [[Olena Diachenko]].\n\n=== Belarus ===\n[[Belarus]] has had success in both individual and group rhythmic gymnastics after the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]].

In 2019, they became [[2019 Rhythmic Gymnastics World Championships|World Champion with 5 balls]] for the first time. Japan had and still has notable gymnasts with Mitsuru Hiraguchi, [[Sakura Hayakawa]], [[Kaho Minagawa]], [[Sumire Kita]], Chisaki Oiwa. Other countries in [[East Asia]] recently began its following and interest in the sport having gymnasts in '''[[South Korea]]''' with [[Shin Soo-ji]], [[Son Yeon-jae]], and in '''China''' with [[Zhong Ling (gymnast)|Zhong Ling]], [[Sun Dan (rhythmic gymnast)|Sun Dan]], [[Zhao Yating]], [[Deng Senyue]], [[Liu Jiahui]] and [[Shang Rong (rhythmic gymnast)|Shang Rong]] doing well against the traditional rhythmic gymnastics powerhouse countries. '''[[North Korea]]''' has had censorable success in group rhythmics gymnastics in the 1970s to the early 1990s and individual rhythmic gymnastics with Sun Duk Jo and Myong Sim Choi.\n\nAlthough it has not gained as much following compared to its [[artistic gymnastics]] counterpart, it is also a rising sport in the '''[[United States]]''' with some notable rhythmic gymnasts including [[Mary Sanders]] (a dual USA/Canadian citizen who has competed for both countries), [[Julie Zetlin]] and [[Jasmine Kerber]]. Internationally successful current national team members include [[Nastasya Generalova]], [[Laura Zeng]], and [[Evita Griskenas]]. Other up-and-coming nations in the [[Western Hemisphere]] include '''Brazil, Mexico, Canada''', with some notable rhythmic gymnasts including [[Lori Fung]] (1984 Olympics gold) [[Mary Sanders]] (who also competed for the USA), [[Alexandra Orlando]], [[Cynthia Valdez]], [[Ang\u00e9lica Kvieczynski]], [[Patricia Bezzoubenko]], [[Nat\u00e1lia Gaudio]] and [[B\u00e1rbara Domingos]].\n\n==Men's rhythmic gymnastics==\n{{see also|:ja:\u7537\u5b50\u65b0\u4f53\u64cd}}\n\n'''Men's Rhythmic Gymnastics (Men's RG, MRG)''' is an artistic sport which is performed to music on a 13 x13m gymnastic [[spring floor]]. It is sometimes called synchronized tumbling, combining the dynamism of powerful acrobatics and perfection of synchronous moves. Athletes are judged on some of the same physical abilities and skills as their female counterparts, such as hand/body/eye co-ordination, but tumbling, strength, and power are the main focus, as well as apparatus handling, flexibility and movements called ''\"Toshu\"'' (\"freehand\"). There are an increasing number of gymnasts, competing alone and on a team; it is most popular in Japan, where high school and university teams compete fiercely. As of 2016, it is estimated there are about 2,000 participants in Japan alone. Some of the outstanding rhythmic gymnasts have made most of their physical abilities for their second careers and become performers in the field of entertainment such as the world-famous circus [[Cirque du Soleil]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/cirque-du-soleil-casting/japan-2016/10155383925758521|title=Japan 2016|website=Facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-12}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n=== History ===\nMen's rhythmic gymnastics in Japan was originally created by adopting elements from Swedish, Danish, and German gymnastics. It has been taught and performed for many years with the aim of improving physical strength and health as early as the 1940s. Originally, both boys and girls used to perform this type of gymnastics, which is called ''\"Dantai Toshu Taisou\"'', literally \"group freehand gymnastics\". In 1967, the name ''\"Shintaisou\"'' (\"new gymnastics\") was adopted as a translation of \"Modern Gymnastics,\" which used to be done in Northern and Central Europe. On the other hand, rhythmic gymnastics for women has also been called ''\"Shintaisou\"'' in Japan since it was first imported to the country. Currently, MRG and women's rhythmic gymnastics are both under the umbrella of Japan Gymnastics Association and major competitions are often held at the same venue. Men's RG consists of two types of events: group events of 6 people (freehand or no apparatus) and individual events using apparatus (stick, rings, rope and clubs). Both group and individual events are performed on a spring floor, allowing gymnasts to do various kinds of tumbling during their performance.\n\n=== Individuals ===\nFor individual performances, a gymnast manipulates one or two pieces of apparatus (double rings, stick, clubs, rope) to demonstrate their skill at apparatus handling, throws, and catches as well as the difficulty of the tumbling. The gymnast must work the entire floor area whilst showing continuous flowing movement. The permitted time for individual events is between 1 minute 25 seconds to 1 minute 33 seconds. During a competition, each individual gymnast performs four separate routines, one for each apparatus. Points are based a 20-point scale. The first 10-point scale measures composition (difficulty) based on technical value, variety, harmony between music and movements, and originality, while the execution of performance is a maximum of 10 points. The individual scores of all four routines for each gymnast are then added up to decide the all-around winner.\n\n=== Groups ===\nGroup performance includes non-acrobatic movements called ''\"Toshu\"'' (handstands, flexibility exercises, balance, etc.), and rotational movements (tumbling and lifts). Group performances are done without using any apparatus. The permitted time for group events is between 2 minutes 45 seconds to 3 minutes. Points are awarded based a 20-point scale that measures difficulty and execution of the routine. Composition/difficulty of performance is scored out of a maximum of 10 points, based on technical value (such as difficulty of tumbling elements and movement elements), variety (variety of movements, change of formations, etc.), harmony between music and movements, and originality, with deductions for lack of required elements or stepping out of bounds, and so on. Execution of performance is scored out of a maximum of 10 points, based on quality of execution, accuracy of performance and synchronization, with deductions taken for mistakes or lack of movements in unison, etc. Some of the group routine videos went viral on the Internet, including Ibara High School's two routines in 2013 and 2016 and [[Aomori University]]'s routine in 2009, which was dedicated to their deceased teammate. Many other MRG videos are also available on [[YouTube]].\n\n=== Internationalization ===\nOn November 27\u201329, 2003, Japan hosted the Men's RG World Championship. This first championship drew five countries from two continents: Japan, Canada, [[Korea]], [[Malaysia]], and the United States. The 2005 World Championship included Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Korea, Russia, and the United States. Men's RG is not currently recognized by the FIG.\n\nThere are, particularly in Europe, some male rhythmic gymnasts who train and perform in much the same way as their female counterparts. They are, however, not eligible to participate in any major competition. Examples include [[Rub\u00e9n Orihuela]] (Spain), Ismael Del Valle (Spain), Jose Sanchez Diaz (Spain), and Thomas Gandon (France).\n\nIn 2013, the Aomori University MRG Team collaborated with renowned Japanese fashion designer [[Issey Miyake]] and American choreographer [[Daniel Ezralow]] (Spiderman, Cirque du Soleil) to create a one-hour contemporary performance, \"Flying Bodies, Soaring Spirits,\" that featured all 27 Aomori men's rhythmic gymnasts outfitted in Miyake's signature costumes. Held July 18, 2013 at [[Yoyogi National Gymnasium|Yoyogi National Stadium]] in Tokyo, the show drew an audience of 2,600. \"Flying Bodies\" was also captured in a 78-minute documentary by director [[Hiroyuki Nakano]] that follows the coaches, gymnasts and creative team for the three months leading up to the performance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2013/08/17/general/image-flip-for-male-rhythmic-gymnasts/|title=Image-flip for male rhythmic gymnasts|last=Otake|first=Tomoko|date=2013-08-17|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2017-07-12|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}</ref>\n\nMen's rhythmic gymnasts of [[Aomori University]] showed their Performance at the [[2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Sports}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n* [[Aesthetic group gymnastics]]\n* [[Asian Gymnastics Championships]] \n* [[Commonwealth Rhythmic Gymnastics Championship]]\n* [[European Team Gymnastics Championships]]\n* [[FIG World Cup]]\n* [[Four Continents Gymnastics Championships]]\n* [[Gymnastics at the Asian Games]]\n* [[Gymnastics at the Central American and Caribbean Games]]\n* [[Gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games]]\n* [[Gymnastics at the European Games]]\n* [[Gymnastics at the Mediterranean Games]]\n* [[Gymnastics at the Pan American Games]]\n* [[Gymnastics at the South American Games]]\n* [[Gymnastics at the Universiade]]\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n* [[Gymnastics at the World Games]]\n* [[List of gymnasts#Rhythmic gymnasts|List of notable rhythmic gymnasts]]\n* [[List of medalists at the Rhythmic Gymnastics Grand Prix Final]]\n* [[List of medalists at the UEG European Cup Final]]\n* [[List of Olympic medalists in gymnastics (women)]]\n* [[Major achievements in gymnastics by nation]]\n* [[Miss Valentine]]\n* [[Pacific Rim Championships]]\n* [[Pan American Gymnastics Championships]] \n* [[Rhythm and dance]]\n* [[Rhythmic Gymnastics European Championships]]\n* [[Rhythmic Gymnastics Grand Prix]]\n* [[Rhythmic Gymnastics World Cup]] \n* [[World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.fig-gymnastics.com F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique] {{in lang|en|fr}}\n* [http://www.british-gymnastics.org/gymnasts/disciplines/rhythmic Rhythmic Gymnastics on the British Gymnastics website]\n* [http://gymnastics.about.com/od/rhythmicgymnastics/Rhythmic_Gymnastics.htm Rhythmic Gymnastics] at About.com\n* [http://rg-leotard.com/tips/rg-music Rhythmic Gymnastics Music]\n* [[:de:Rudolf Bode|Rudolf Bode]] at the German Wikipedia\n* [https://jenerg.com/apparatus-guide/ Rhythmic Gymnastics Equipment]\n\n{{Gymnastics}}\n{{Sports of the World Games program}}\n{{Summer Olympic sports}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Rhythmic gymnastics|*]]\n[[Category:Summer Olympic disciplines]]\n[[Category:Gymnastics]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Gymnastics discipline}}\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2012}}\n{{Infobox sport\n| name       = Best \n| image      = Rhytmic Gymnastics Group 10 Clubs final - 27th Summer Universiade 2013 - Kazan.webm\n| imagesize  = 220px\n| caption    = Rhythmic gymnastics Group 10 clubs final, 27th Summer Universiade 2013, Kazan\n| union      = [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique]]\n| first      = Sweden 18th century\n| firstlabel = First developed\n| country/region = Worldwide\n| registered =\n| clubs      =\n| contact    = No\n| team       = \n| mgender    = No\n| category   = Gymnastic sport\n| equipment  = \n| venue      =\n| obsolete   =\n| olympic    = Since [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]]\n| paralympic =\n| IWGA       = [[2001 World Games|2001]]{{snds}}[[2021 World Games|2021]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theworldgames.org/sports/Gymnastics-59|title=Gymnastics &#124;

Gymnasts are judged on their artistry, execution of skills, and difficulty of skills, for which they gain points. They perform leaps, balances, pivots, and flexibility movements, along with tossing, catching, rolling and otherwise manipulating the apparatus.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:Yevgeniya Kanayeva.jpg|right|thumb|230px|2 time Olympic Champion [[Yevgeniya Kanayeva|Evgenia Kanaeva]] ([[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London]])]]\n\nRhythmic gymnastics grew out of the ideas of [[Jean-Georges Noverre]] (1727\u20131810), [[Fran\u00e7ois Delsarte]] (1811\u20131871), and [[:de:Rudolf Bode|Rudolf Bode]] (1881\u20131970), who all believed in movement expression, where one used dance to express oneself and exercise various body parts. [[Pehr Henrik Ling|Peter Henry Ling]] further developed this idea in his 19th-century [[Sweden|Swedish]] system of free exercise, which promoted \"aesthetic gymnastics\", in which students expressed their feelings and emotions through body movement. This idea was extended by [[Catharine Beecher]], who founded the Western Female Institute in [[Ohio]], United States, in 1837. In Beecher's gymnastics program, called dance without dancing\", the young women exercised to music, moving from simple [[calisthenics]] to more strenuous activities.\n\nDuring the 1880s, [[\u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze]] of Switzerland developed [[eurhythmics]], a form of physical training for musicians and dancers. [[George Demeny]] of France created exercises to music that were designed to promote grace of movement, muscular flexibility, and good posture. All of these styles were combined around 1900 into the Swedish school of rhythmic gymnastics, which would later add dance elements from [[Finland]]. Around this time, Ernst Idla of [[Estonia]] established a [[degree of difficulty]] for each movement. In 1929, Hinrich Medau founded The Medau School in Berlin to train gymnasts in \"modern gymnastics\", and to develop the use of the apparatus.\n\nCompetitive rhythmic gymnastics began in the 1940s in the [[Soviet Union]]. The FIG formally recognized this discipline in 1961, first as '''modern gymnastics''', then as '''rhythmic sportive gymnastics''', and finally as '''rhythmic gymnastics'''. The first World Championships for individual rhythmic gymnasts was held in 1963 in [[Budapest]]. Groups were introduced at the same level in 1967 in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark. Rhythmic gymnastics was added to the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]], with an individual all-around competition. However, many federations from the [[Eastern Europe]]an countries were forced to [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] by the Soviet Union. Canadian [[Lori Fung]] was the first rhythmic gymnast to earn an Olympic gold medal. The group competition was added to the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta. The Spanish team won the first gold medal of the new competition with a team formed by [[Estela Gim\u00e9nez]], [[Marta Bald\u00f3]], [[Nuria Cabanillas]], [[Lorena Gur\u00e9ndez]], [[Est\u00edbaliz Mart\u00ednez]] and [[Tania Lamarca]].\n\n==The gymnast==\n[[File:Medalistswaving-syd2000-600pxl.JPG|left|thumb|(L-R) [[Alina Kabaeva]] (bronze), [[Yulia Barsukova]] (gold) and [[Yulia Raskina]] (silver) at [[2000 Sydney Olympics]]]]\n\nOlympic rhythmic gymnastics is only for female participants. Japan has begun developing programs in which men can compete. Also in Spain, men are allowed to participate in the women's competition. The men's program has yet to be formally recognized by the FIG, however, and men cannot compete in the Olympics as a rhythmic gymnast. Gymnasts start at a young age and become age-eligible to compete in the Olympic Games and other major international competitions on January 1 of their 16th year (For example, a gymnast born on 12-31-2004 would be age eligible for the 2020 Olympics). Gymnasts in Russia and Europe typically start training at a very young age and those at their peak are typically in their late teens (15\u201319) or early twenties, but since 2004 it is common to see gymnasts achieving their peak after reaching their twenties.\n\nTop rhythmic gymnasts must have many qualities; balance, flexibility, coordination, and strength are some of the most important. They also must possess psychological attributes such as the ability to compete under intense pressure, in which one mistake can cost them the title, and the discipline and work ethic to practice the same skills over and over again.\n\nCurrently a gymnast can perform in the individual event or in the group event. They perform routines in 12 x 12 meter areas, accompanied by music (recorded or played by musician(s)). Since 1995, groups are consisted of 5 gymnasts, but originally six gymnasts composed a group, although around the 1980s this could be even eight. The duration of a group exercise should be two and a half minutes, one minute more than the individual one, which is one minute and a half.\n\n==Apparatus==\nThe FIG selects which apparatus will be used in competitions, only four out of the five possible apparatuses are sanctioned. Hoop and rope were the first apparatus used at World Championships, followed later by ball, ribbon and clubs. For 2011, [[Rope (rhythmic gymnastics)|rope]] was dropped for senior national individual and group competition. In 2011, it was to be dropped for junior national individual competition but returned again in 2015. Rope appeared in junior national group competition in 2011&ndash;2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,5187-192704-209927-142566-0-file,00.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123070651/http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,5187-192704-209927-142566-0-file,00.pdf|url-status=dead|title=FIG Rhythmic Gymnastics Apparatus Programme - Olympic Cycles 2009\u20132016|archivedate=November 23, 2009}}</ref>  In 2017, rope appeared in senior group competition. Freehand was an event for the four first World Championships before being dropped and only used in local competitions, usually for the youngest levels.\n\nSince 2011, senior individual gymnasts perform four different routines with hoop, ball, clubs and ribbon. Senior group performed two different routines, one with a single apparatus and one with mixed apparatus (for example, a routine with 5 hoop and a routine with 3 balls / 2 ropes). For junior individual gymnasts, the FIG selects four out of the five possible apparatuses. Junior groups performed two different routines with two different types of apparatus (for example, a routine with 5 hoops and a routine with 5 ribbons). As of 2017 rhythmic gymnastics equipment used in F.I.G. sanctioned events must come have the F.I.G. logo on the apparatus.\n\n[[File:M\u00f3nica Ferr\u00e1ndez 1990 Goteborg.PNG|right|thumb|100px|M\u00f3nica Ferr\u00e1ndez with a rope]]\n\n;[[Rope (rhythmic gymnastics)|Rope]]: It may be made of hemp or a synthetic material that retains the qualities of lightness and suppleness. Its length is in proportion to the size of the gymnast. When the middle of the rope is held down by the feet, both ends should reach the gymnasts' armpits. One or two knots at each end are for keeping hold of the rope while doing the routine. At the ends (to the exclusion of all other parts of the rope) an anti-slip material, either coloured or neutral may cover a maximum of {{convert|10.0|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The rope must be colored, either all or partially. It may be either of a uniform diameter or be progressively thicker in the center provided that this thickening is of the same material as the rope. The fundamental requirements of a rope routine include leaps and skipping. Other elements include swings, throws, circles, rotations and figures of eight. Since 2011, the [[International Federation of Gymnastics|FIG]] decided to nullify the use of rope in senior individual rhythmic gymnastics competitions. Before 2013, jumps and leaps were the Compulsory Body Movement Groups (dominant in the exercise). \n\nCustomization: Ropes can be color dyed. It is not common practice because the majority of the paints are water-based and can start coming off with sweat[[File:YussupovaHoop.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Aliya Yussupova with a hoop]]\n; [[Hoop (rhythmic gymnastics)|Hoop]]:A hoop may be made of plastic or wood, provided that it retains its shape during the routine. The hoop is chosen based on the gymnast's size and should not extend beyond the hip bone when placed standing up on the floor. The interior diameter is from 51 to 90&nbsp;cm and the hoop must weigh a minimum of 300g. Children and hope divisions, a minimum of 225 grams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://usagym.org/PDFs/Rhythmic/Junior%20Olympics/1617handbook.pdf|title=U.S.A.G.

Fundamental requirements of a hoop routine include rotation around the hand or body and rolling, as well as swings, circles, throws, and passes through and over the hoop.\n\nCustomization: Hoops are often customized using colored tapes to match the design of the leotards. As of 2017 F.I.G.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Gymnastics_Federation|title=International Gymnastics Federation|last=F.I.G.|first=|date=|website=Wikipedia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=November 2019}} sanctioned events must [[File:Margarita Mamun Universiade 2013.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Margarita Mamun with a ball]]\n\n; [[Ball (rhythmic gymnastics)|Ball]]:It is made of either rubber or synthetic material (pliable plastic) provided it possesses the same elasticity as rubber. Senior and junior gymnasts is 18 to 20&nbsp;cm in diameter and must have a minimum weight of 400g. The ball can be of any color. The ball should rest in the gymnast's hand and not rest against the wrist or be able to be grasped. Fundamental elements of a ball routine include throwing, bouncing or rolling. The gymnast must use both hands and work on the whole floor area whilst showing continuous flowing movement. The ball is to emphasize the gymnasts flowing lines and body difficulty. Before 2013, flexibility and waves were the Compulsory Body Movement Groups (dominant in the exercise).\n[[File:Arancha Marty 1989 Sarajevo.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Arancha Marty with clubs]]\n; [[Juggling club|Clubs]]: Senior and junior clubs must weight a minimum of 150 grams per club. Children's and hope age divisions minimum weight should be 75 grams per club. Multi-piece clubs are the most popular clubs. The club is built along an internal rod, providing a base on which a handle made of [[polyolefin]] plastic is wrapped, providing an airspace between it and the internal rod. This airspace provides flex and cushioning impact, making the club softer on the hands. Foam ends and knobs further cushion the club. Multi-piece clubs are made in both a thin European style or larger bodied American style and in various lengths, generally ranging from {{convert|19|to|21|in|mm|abbr=off}}. The handles and bodies are typically wrapped with decorative plastics and tapes. Clubs are thrown from alternate hands; each passes underneath the other clubs and is caught in the opposite hand to the one from which it was thrown. At its simplest, each club rotates once per throw, the handle moving down and away from the throwing hand at first. However, double and triple spins are frequently performed, allowing the club to be thrown higher for more advanced patterns and to allow tricks such as 360s (channes) to be performed underneath. Before 2013, balances were the Compulsory Body Movement Groups (dominant in the exercise).\n[[File:Viktoria Stadnik.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Viktoria Stadnik with a ribbon]]\n; [[Ribbon (rhythmic gymnastics)|Ribbon]]:It is made of satin or another similar material cloth of any color; it may be multi-colored and have designs on it. The ribbon itself must be at least {{convert|35|g|oz|abbr=on}}, 4\u20136&nbsp;cm (1.6\u20132.4\") in width and have a minimum length of 6m (20') for seniors and 5m (16.25') for juniors. The ribbon must be in one piece. The end that is attached to the stick is doubled for a maximum length of 1m (3'). This is stitched down both sides. At the top, a very thin reinforcement or rows of machine stitching for a maximum length of 5&nbsp;cm is authorized. This extremity may end in a strap, or have an eyelet (a small hole, edged with a buttonhole stitch or metal circle), to permit attaching the ribbon. The ribbon is fixed to the stick by means of a supple attachment such as thread, nylon cord, or a series of articulated rings. The attachment has a maximum length of 7&nbsp;cm (2.8\"), not counting the strap or metal ring at the end of the stick where it will be fastened. Compulsory elements for the ribbon include flicks, circles, snakes and spirals, and throws. It requires a high degree of co-ordination to form the spirals and circles as any knots which may accidentally form in the ribbon are penalized. During a ribbon routine, large, smooth and flowing movements are looked for. The ribbon may not stop moving or else points are taken off. Before 2013, pivots were the Compulsory Body Movement Groups (dominant in the exercise).\n\n==Scoring system==\nIn rhythmic gymnastics competitions exercises are evaluated by the following parameters which are reviewed every four years, the system defining the FIG Code of Points. After each Olympic games, the scoring process is modified.\n\n===Current Code of Points===\nIn the current Code of Points (2017-2020),<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/publicdir/rules/files/en_RG%20CoP%202017-2020%20updated%20with%20changes%20and%20errata%20Dec.%202017%20valid%2001.02.2018.pdf\n|title = RG CoP 2017-2020\n|date = 5 March 2018\n|publisher = International Federation of Gymnastics\n|accessdate = 14 August 2018\n}}</ref> the final score of a routine is the sum of the difficulty score and execution score. Penalties incurred will also be deducted from the final score. The difficulty score is open-ended with no maximum score, while the execution score has a starting value of 10 points. There are also penalties, which are realized by subtracting points from the final note for certain specified mistakes made by the gymnast.\n\n'''Difficulty''' consists of body difficulties (jumps, balances and rotations), dynamic elements with rotation (commonly known as risks) and dance step combinations (for individuals gymnasts and groups), and apparatus difficulties (only for individuals gymnasts) and exchange and collaborations (only for groups). The difficulty score is evaluated during the routine without a pre-made difficulty sheet, unlike with previous Codes. Each difficulty component has an assigned value, which accumulate throughout the routine, resulting in the final difficulty score.\n\n'''Execution''' is the degree to which the gymnast performs with aesthetic and technical perfection. The execution score is composed of artistic faults and technical faults. In the first, the unity and character of the composition, harmony with the music, body expression and the variety in the use of space and apparatus elements, among others are valued; on the other hand, the technical handling of the apparatus (like catching the ball with one hand and not two, not losing the apparatus, etc.) and technical aspects of body movements (like touching the head with the foot during a ring form, not falling, etc.) are valued. Errors regarding the perfect model of conduct accumulate and are assigned specific penalty values, which ultimately are subtracted from the starting value (an execution score of 10 represents a perfect execution equal to the model, without any error).\n\nFinally, '''Penalties''' are taken by the time, line, and coordinator judges. Possible penalties include:\n\n* The gymnast leaving the floor area\n* The apparatus leaving the floor area\n* The exercise being longer or shorter than the acceptable length of time (1'15\" to 1'30\" is the required length for individual, and 2'15\" to 2'30\" is the required length for group)\n* Failure to end the exercise at the exact moment the accompanying music ends\n* Music not conforming to the regulations\n* Dress of the gymnast not conforming to the regulations\n* Communication with the coach during the execution of the exercise\n* Verbal communication between group gymnasts during the exercise\n* Grabbing a new apparatus from the side of the floor\n\n===Evolution of the Code of Points===\nThe first Code of Point was published in 1970. Since then, rhythmics gymnastics has known 14 different codes (1970-1971, 1971-1972, 1973-1976, 1977-1980, 1981-1984, 1985-1988, 1989-1992, 1993-1996, 1997-2000, 2001-2004, 2005-2008, 2009\u20132012, 2013-2016, 2017-2020). Since 1984 and the first appearance at the [[Gymnastics at the 1984 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's rhythmic individual all-around|Olympics]], the Code of Point is renew after each Olympics.\n\nIn the decades of the 60s and 70s, the weight of the note fell most heavily on the artistic side, with little presence of difficulties. In the 80s new difficulty elements were introduced to give greater prominence to the flexibility and risk releases, and to encourage originality with emerging new devices. In 1985 the score was composed of: Composition (Technical + Artistry) was scored on 5 points and Execution was scored on 5 points. In 1997, the Code of Points was subjected to an important change, by separating the score the score between Artistry (on 5 for individual or 6 points group groups), Technical (on 5 points for individuals or 4 points for groups) and Execution (on 10 points), the Total score being given on 10 points for individuals and 20 points for groups.\n\nIn the late 90s, there was an appearance of gymnasts whose exercise flexibility was used as a main element ([[Yana Batyrshina|Yana Batyrchina]] or [[Alina Kabaeva]] for example), which was one of the motivations for a major change in the Code in 2001, which doubled the number of required elements of difficulty (12 maximum during the Olympics cycle 2001-2004 and 18 maximum during the Olympic cycle 2005-2008) and reduced the value of the artistic element, which was now mixed with apparatus difficulty (also known as mastery) and risks. The final mark then was obtained by adding notes Difficulty (or Technical before 2005), Artistry and Execution, each with a maximum value of 10 points, so the final score would be a maximum of 30 points. During the Olympic cycle 2005-2008, the final note would be a maximum of 20 points to join the average grade of Difficulty and Artistry.\n\nIn 2009 the code was subjected to a new important change. The final mark was obtained by adding notes Difficulty (12 difficulties with the body, masteries and risks), Artistry and Execution, each with a maximum value of 10 points, so the final score would be a maximum of 30 points. In 2013, the code introduced the Dance steps combination and an Execution score taking into account both technical and artistic execution. The score then was on 20 points with 10 points for Difficulty (9 difficulties with the body, masteries, 5 risks and dance steps combination) and 10 points for Execution (technical and artistic penalties). The 2017 code was very similar, with a difficulty strictly limited and differences among the best gymnasts heavily determined by the execution. Therefore in 2018, the Difficulty became open for the first time.\n\n==Major competitions==\nAs of 2019, according to the technical regulations defined by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique|International Gymnastics Federation]] (FIG), the only official competitions in which rhythmic gymnastics events are contested globally are: the [[World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]]; the stages of the [[Rhythmic Gymnastics World Cup|World Cup series]] (including the defunct [[FIG World Cup|World Cup Final]] and World Cup qualifiers); the [[Gymnastics at the World Games|World Games]]; and the [[Gymnastics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] (as well as the [[Gymnastics at the Youth Olympic Games|Youth Olympic Games]]).<ref name=reg>{{cite web |url=http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/publicdir/rules/files/en_Technical%20Regulations%202018%20update%20PK.pdf |publisher=[[International Gymnastics Federation]] |title=Technical Regulations 2018 |accessdate=2018-04-22}}</ref> Since 2019, [[Rhythmic Gymnastics Junior World  Championships|Junior World Championships]] are held every two years.\n\nThe nations which have earned at least one medal in official FIG competitions are:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gymnasticsresults.com/|title=Gymnastics Results|website=gymnasticsresults.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gymn-forum.net/results.html|title=Gymn Forum: Results|website=Gymn-forum.net}}</ref>\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=14em|style=-moz-column-count:4; -webkit-column-count:4; column-count:4|\n* {{AZE}}<ref name=rg1>{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-sports.org/gymnastics-world-cup-rhythmic-gymnastics-minsk-results-2013-epr45121.html|title=Gymnastics - World Cup Rhythmic Gymnastics - Minsk 2013 - Results|website=The-sports.org}}</ref>\n* {{BLR}}<ref name=rg1/> \n* {{BRA}}<ref name=rg2>{{Cite web|url=http://rsg.net/cgi-bin/show?events/1999/dtb_bochum_99_g.html|title=11.

The two countries were in rivalry with each other before the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\n=== Soviet Union ===\n[[File:Galima Shugurova 1973.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Galima Shugurova|Galina Shugurova]]]]\nBefore the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, Soviet rhythmic gymnasts were engaged in a fierce competition with [[Bulgaria]]. The first [[World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]] held in 1963 in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] was won by Soviet gymnast [[Ludmila Savinkova]] and in 1967 in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark the first Group Championships was also won by the [[USSR]].\n\nOther Soviet World AA Champions in individuals included [[Elena Karpuchina]], [[Galima Shugurova|Galina Shugurova]] and [[Irina Deriugina]]. [[Marina Lobatch]] became the first Soviet to win the [[Olympic Games]] in the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Seoul Olympics]]. In 1991, [[Unified Team at the Olympics|The Unified Team]] was formed and saw a competition of the two Soviet/Ukrainian gymnasts, [[Olexandra Tymoshenko]] and [[Oxana Skaldina]] at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]].\n\nOther notable Soviet gymnasts include: [[Tatiana Kravtchenko]], [[Liubov Sereda]], [[Alfia Nazmutdinova]], [[Natalia Krachinnekova]], [[Irina Devina]], [[Elena Tomas]], [[Irina Gabashvili]], [[Inessa Lisovskaya]], [[Dalia Kutkait\u0117]], [[Venera Zaripova]], [[Galina Beloglazova]], [[Anna Kotchneva]] and [[Tatiana Druchinina]].\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\n[[File:BiankaPanova 1.JPG|thumb|170px|[[Bianka Panova]]]]\nSince the start of the inception of rhythmic gymnastics as a World Championship event, Bulgaria was in competition with the [[USSR]]; during the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, Bulgaria has won 10 individual World Titles with its star gymnasts [[Maria Gigova]] (3 time World AA Champion), [[Neshka Robeva]] and [[Kristina Guiourova]].\n\nThe 1980s marked the height of Bulgarian success known as the [[Golden Girls of Bulgaria]], with gymnasts [[Iliana Raeva]], [[Anelia Ralenkova]], [[Lilia Ignatova]], [[Diliana Gueorguieva]], [[Bianka Panova]], [[Adriana Dunavska]] and [[Elizabeth Koleva]] dominating the World Championships. [[Bianka Panova]] became the first rhythmic gymnast to make a clean sweep of all five individual events at a World Championship by attaining full marks. She also became the first rhythmic gymnast to get into the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] by her perfect performance of full 10 marks in all her routines (total of 8) at a World Championship, and received the trophy personally from the President of the [[International Olympic Committee]] at the time, [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]].\n\nThe early 1990s were marked by the full domination of [[Maria Petrova (rhythmic gymnast)|Maria Petrova]], 3 time World AA Champion and 3 time European AA Champion.\n\nThe early 2000s marked the decline of individual rhythmic gymnasts of Bulgaria, though with still a few notable gymnasts including [[Simona Peycheva]] and [[Sylvia Miteva]].

Ukraine has won 1 gold and 3 bronze medals at the Olympic Games. If you include all Ukrainian gymnasts, then they have won 2 gold and 4 bronze medals. The mother and daughter tandem of Albina and [[Irina Deriugina]] played an important role in the success of RG in the country, raising stars like [[Olexandra Tymoshenko]] and [[Oxana Skaldina]].\n\nAfter the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]], Ukraine continued its success in rhythmic gymnastics with [[Kateryna Serebrianska]] winning the Olympic gold medal at the [[1996 Atlanta Olympics]].\n\nOther notable gymnasts include [[Anna Bessonova]] (two-time [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] bronze medalist), [[Ganna Rizatdinova]] (2016 Olympics bronze), [[Olena Vitrychenko]] (1996 Olympics bronze), [[Tamara Yerofeeva]], [[Natalia Godunko]], [[Alina Maksymenko]], [[Vlada Nikolchenko]], [[Victoria Stadnik]], [[Olena Dmytrash]], [[Viktoriia Mazur]], [[Valeriia Gudym]], [[Yevgeniya Gomon]], [[Oleksandra Gridasova]], [[Anastasiia Mulmina]], [[Anastasiya Voznyak]], [[Kateryna Lutsenko]] and [[Olena Diachenko]].\n\n=== Belarus ===\n[[Belarus]] has had success in both individual and group rhythmic gymnastics after the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]].

Japan had and still has notable gymnasts with Mitsuru Hiraguchi, [[Sakura Hayakawa]], [[Kaho Minagawa]], [[Sumire Kita]], Chisaki Oiwa. Other countries in [[East Asia]] recently began its following and interest in the sport having gymnasts in '''[[South Korea]]''' with [[Shin Soo-ji]], [[Son Yeon-jae]], and in '''China''' with [[Zhong Ling (gymnast)|Zhong Ling]], [[Sun Dan (rhythmic gymnast)|Sun Dan]], [[Zhao Yating]], [[Deng Senyue]], [[Liu Jiahui]] and [[Shang Rong (rhythmic gymnast)|Shang Rong]] doing well against the traditional rhythmic gymnastics powerhouse countries. '''[[North Korea]]''' has had censorable success in group rhythmics gymnastics in the 1970s to the early 1990s and individual rhythmic gymnastics with Sun Duk Jo and Myong Sim Choi.\n\nAlthough it has not gained as much following compared to its [[artistic gymnastics]] counterpart, it is also a rising sport in the '''[[United States]]''' with some notable rhythmic gymnasts including [[Mary Sanders]] (a dual USA/Canadian citizen who has competed for both countries), [[Julie Zetlin]] and [[Jasmine Kerber]]. Internationally successful current national team members include [[Nastasya Generalova]], [[Laura Zeng]], and [[Evita Griskenas]]. Other up-and-coming nations in the [[Western Hemisphere]] include '''Brazil, Mexico, Canada''', with some notable rhythmic gymnasts including [[Lori Fung]] (1984 Olympics gold) [[Mary Sanders]] (who also competed for the USA), [[Alexandra Orlando]], [[Cynthia Valdez]], [[Ang\u00e9lica Kvieczynski]], [[Patricia Bezzoubenko]], [[Nat\u00e1lia Gaudio]] and [[B\u00e1rbara Domingos]].\n\n==Men's rhythmic gymnastics==\n{{see also|:ja:\u7537\u5b50\u65b0\u4f53\u64cd}}\n\n'''Men's Rhythmic Gymnastics (Men's RG, MRG)''' is an artistic sport which is performed to music on a 13 x13m gymnastic [[spring floor]]. It is sometimes called synchronized tumbling, combining the dynamism of powerful acrobatics and perfection of synchronous moves. Athletes are judged on some of the same physical abilities and skills as their female counterparts, such as hand/body/eye co-ordination, but tumbling, strength, and power are the main focus, as well as apparatus handling, flexibility and movements called ''\"Toshu\"'' (\"freehand\"). There are an increasing number of gymnasts, competing alone and on a team; it is most popular in Japan, where high school and university teams compete fiercely. As of 2016, it is estimated there are about 2,000 participants in Japan alone. Some of the outstanding rhythmic gymnasts have made most of their physical abilities for their second careers and become performers in the field of entertainment such as the world-famous circus [[Cirque du Soleil]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/cirque-du-soleil-casting/japan-2016/10155383925758521|title=Japan 2016|website=Facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-12}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n=== History ===\nMen's rhythmic gymnastics in Japan was originally created by adopting elements from Swedish, Danish, and German gymnastics. It has been taught and performed for many years with the aim of improving physical strength and health as early as the 1940s. Originally, both boys and girls used to perform this type of gymnastics, which is called ''\"Dantai Toshu Taisou\"'', literally \"group freehand gymnastics\". In 1967, the name ''\"Shintaisou\"'' (\"new gymnastics\") was adopted as a translation of \"Modern Gymnastics,\" which used to be done in Northern and Central Europe. On the other hand, rhythmic gymnastics for women has also been called ''\"Shintaisou\"'' in Japan since it was first imported to the country. Currently, MRG and women's rhythmic gymnastics are both under the umbrella of Japan Gymnastics Association and major competitions are often held at the same venue. Men's RG consists of two types of events: group events of 6 people (freehand or no apparatus) and individual events using apparatus (stick, rings, rope and clubs). Both group and individual events are performed on a spring floor, allowing gymnasts to do various kinds of tumbling during their performance.\n\n=== Individuals ===\nFor individual performances, a gymnast manipulates one or two pieces of apparatus (double rings, stick, clubs, rope) to demonstrate their skill at apparatus handling, throws, and catches as well as the difficulty of the tumbling. The gymnast must work the entire floor area whilst showing continuous flowing movement. The permitted time for individual events is between 1 minute 25 seconds to 1 minute 33 seconds. During a competition, each individual gymnast performs four separate routines, one for each apparatus. Points are based a 20-point scale. The first 10-point scale measures composition (difficulty) based on technical value, variety, harmony between music and movements, and originality, while the execution of performance is a maximum of 10 points. The individual scores of all four routines for each gymnast are then added up to decide the all-around winner.\n\n=== Groups ===\nGroup performance includes non-acrobatic movements called ''\"Toshu\"'' (handstands, flexibility exercises, balance, etc.), and rotational movements (tumbling and lifts). Group performances are done without using any apparatus. The permitted time for group events is between 2 minutes 45 seconds to 3 minutes. Points are awarded based a 20-point scale that measures difficulty and execution of the routine. Composition/difficulty of performance is scored out of a maximum of 10 points, based on technical value (such as difficulty of tumbling elements and movement elements), variety (variety of movements, change of formations, etc.), harmony between music and movements, and originality, with deductions for lack of required elements or stepping out of bounds, and so on. Execution of performance is scored out of a maximum of 10 points, based on quality of execution, accuracy of performance and synchronization, with deductions taken for mistakes or lack of movements in unison, etc. Some of the group routine videos went viral on the Internet, including Ibara High School's two routines in 2013 and 2016 and [[Aomori University]]'s routine in 2009, which was dedicated to their deceased teammate. Many other MRG videos are also available on [[YouTube]].\n\n=== Internationalization ===\nOn November 27\u201329, 2003, Japan hosted the Men's RG World Championship. This first championship drew five countries from two continents: Japan, Canada, [[Korea]], [[Malaysia]], and the United States. The 2005 World Championship included Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Korea, Russia, and the United States. Men's RG is not currently recognized by the FIG.\n\nThere are, particularly in Europe, some male rhythmic gymnasts who train and perform in much the same way as their female counterparts. They are, however, not eligible to participate in any major competition. Examples include [[Rub\u00e9n Orihuela]] (Spain), Ismael Del Valle (Spain), Jose Sanchez Diaz (Spain), and Thomas Gandon (France).\n\nIn 2013, the Aomori University MRG Team collaborated with renowned Japanese fashion designer [[Issey Miyake]] and American choreographer [[Daniel Ezralow]] (Spiderman, Cirque du Soleil) to create a one-hour contemporary performance, \"Flying Bodies, Soaring Spirits,\" that featured all 27 Aomori men's rhythmic gymnasts outfitted in Miyake's signature costumes. Held July 18, 2013 at [[Yoyogi National Gymnasium|Yoyogi National Stadium]] in Tokyo, the show drew an audience of 2,600. \"Flying Bodies\" was also captured in a 78-minute documentary by director [[Hiroyuki Nakano]] that follows the coaches, gymnasts and creative team for the three months leading up to the performance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2013/08/17/general/image-flip-for-male-rhythmic-gymnasts/|title=Image-flip for male rhythmic gymnasts|last=Otake|first=Tomoko|date=2013-08-17|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2017-07-12|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}</ref>\n\nMen's rhythmic gymnasts of [[Aomori University]] showed their Performance at the [[2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Sports}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n* [[Aesthetic group gymnastics]]\n* [[Asian Gymnastics Championships]] \n* [[Commonwealth Rhythmic Gymnastics Championship]]\n* [[European Team Gymnastics Championships]]\n* [[FIG World Cup]]\n* [[Four Continents Gymnastics Championships]]\n* [[Gymnastics at the Asian Games]]\n* [[Gymnastics at the Central American and Caribbean Games]]\n* [[Gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games]]\n* [[Gymnastics at the European Games]]\n* [[Gymnastics at the Mediterranean Games]]\n* [[Gymnastics at the Pan American Games]]\n* [[Gymnastics at the South American Games]]\n* [[Gymnastics at the Universiade]]\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n* [[Gymnastics at the World Games]]\n* [[List of gymnasts#Rhythmic gymnasts|List of notable rhythmic gymnasts]]\n* [[List of medalists at the Rhythmic Gymnastics Grand Prix Final]]\n* [[List of medalists at the UEG European Cup Final]]\n* [[List of Olympic medalists in gymnastics (women)]]\n* [[Major achievements in gymnastics by nation]]\n* [[Miss Valentine]]\n* [[Pacific Rim Championships]]\n* [[Pan American Gymnastics Championships]] \n* [[Rhythm and dance]]\n* [[Rhythmic Gymnastics European Championships]]\n* [[Rhythmic Gymnastics Grand Prix]]\n* [[Rhythmic Gymnastics World Cup]] \n* [[World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.fig-gymnastics.com F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique] {{in lang|en|fr}}\n* [http://www.british-gymnastics.org/gymnasts/disciplines/rhythmic Rhythmic Gymnastics on the British Gymnastics website]\n* [http://gymnastics.about.com/od/rhythmicgymnastics/Rhythmic_Gymnastics.htm Rhythmic Gymnastics] at About.com\n* [http://rg-leotard.com/tips/rg-music Rhythmic Gymnastics Music]\n* [[:de:Rudolf Bode|Rudolf Bode]] at the German Wikipedia\n* [https://jenerg.com/apparatus-guide/ Rhythmic Gymnastics Equipment]\n\n{{Gymnastics}}\n{{Sports of the World Games program}}\n{{Summer Olympic sports}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Rhythmic gymnastics|*]]\n[[Category:Summer Olympic disciplines]]\n[[Category:Gymnastics]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "Old Man Consequences", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythmic_gymnastics"}

In March it sailed for the [[Dardanelles]], Turkey, when it numbered 28 officers and 1,002 other ranks.<ref>Staunton, p.253</ref> Turkey had joined the [[Central Powers]]'s side in November 1914, the object of the landing on the Dardanelles peninsula was to open the [[Dardanelles Strait]] in the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] to enable [[Triple Entente|Allied]] relief convoys reach Russia. Aboard the {{SS|River Clyde}}, a converted collier with a capacity for over 2,000 men, they arrived on 25 April together with the 1st Battalion [[The Royal Dublin Fusiliers]] and some companies of the [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)|Royal Hampshires]].<ref>Staunton, p.255</ref>\n\nThe SS River Clyde ran gently ashore, its exit bows facing the beach, for what was to be the troubled British [[landing at Cape Helles]]. Small boats first carried companies of ''Dubliners'' to the beach, however four hidden Turkish machine gun posts opened fire and decimated them. Lighters to the shore were roped together and two companies of Munsters poured out on to the bow's gangway but were also hit by machine gun fire, with one survivor saying they were 'literally slaughtered like rats in a trap'.<ref>Steel and Hart, pp. 90\u201395</ref> Many of the Munsters jumped from the gangway in the face of the withering fire and some drowned under their heavy equipment. Those men who continued down the gangway were mown down until all the boats and lighters were filled with dead and wounded. The ship's commanding officer, Captain [[Edward Unwin]], on being informed that they were not succeeding, replied \"in British military tradition, offensives once begun are never called off\". Unwin was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for his actions that day.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue= 29264|date=13 August 1915|page=8132|supp=y}}</ref> At daybreak the next day, just three companies of Munsters, two companies of Hampshires and one company of Dubliners had made it to the shelter of some dunes. On 26 April they took fort [[Sedd-el-Bahr]] overlooking the bay, charging and taking the village behind and held off several Turkish counterattacks. It was in this attack that the heroic actions of [[William Cosgrove]] won the regiment's first [[Victoria Cross]]. The 28 April saw a renewed attack in the [[First Battle of Krithia|Battle for Krithia village]], but the survivors of the landing were withdrawn by 29 April due to heavy losses and amalgamated with the surviving Dublin Fusiliers, to form the \"Dubsters\" battalion of 8 officers and 770 men.<ref>Staunton, pp.258\u201360</ref>\n\n[[File:The Last General Absolution of the Munsters at Rue du Bois.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|''The Last General Absolution of the Munsters at Rue du Bois'' administered <br/>by their chaplain [[Francis Gleeson (priest)|Father Francis Gleeson]]]]\nThe Turks launched a renewed attack on the night of 1 May, with one Royal Munster Fusilier saying \"they crept up in the dark into our trenches bayoneting our men before we knew it had begun. Bayoneting on both sides was terrible. At dawn the Turks were mowed down, and heaps of bodies and streams of blood remaining everywhere.\"<ref>Staunton, p.260</ref> The battalion was reduced to 4 officers and 430 men, with the Turks attempting further attacks the following days only to be driven off once again, but the combined force of Munster and Dublin Fusiliers were down to 372 men by 11 April. Both the Munsters and Dubliners received new drafts on 29 May and became separate units again. By 4 June, the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers numbered 40 officers and 500 other ranks, but many the new recruits were young and inexperienced. The Munsters withheld a further Turkish attack on 17 June, killing over 300 Turks. The arrival of further new drafts replenished the battalion to 23 officers and other 588 ranks. The Munsters took part in the Division's assault on 28 June which secured five trench lines. This provoked a general attack by the Turkish side along the Cape Helles front on 5 July, but the Turks were repulsed after suffering heavy losses.<ref>Staunton, pp.260\u201364</ref>\n\nThe 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers participated in limited actions into the middle of July. A month's rest was promised on 15 July, but by 22 July the battalion were back in action, their strength around 500 of whom only 3 officers and 314 men remained from those who first landed on 25 April. The climax of the Gallipoli came with the Suvla attack on 21 August in the [[Battle of Scimitar Hill]], the Turks inflicted severe casualties. The unsuccessful attack cost the Munsters 3 officers and 79 men that day alone.<ref>Staunton, pp.265\u201368</ref> There was little further action other than holding front lines from September through to November, when the weather worsened. Late in November, gales swept over the peninsula, hundreds were drowned in the flooded trenches or from exposure and frostbite. Faced with defeat, the British decided to withdraw from the peninsula and the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers was evacuated as it arrived, on the ''River Clyde'', sailing on 2 January 1916 for [[Alexandria]]. From there it sailed with the rest of the 29th Division and arrived in France on 22 March. 3 years of warfare still remained for the battalion on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], but the battalion had already suffered 45% of its total losses for the entire war at Gallipoli, and numbered just 24 officers and 287 men when disembarking in France.<ref>Staunton, pp.269\u201371</ref>\n\n[[File:Chaplain Fr Gleeson's Mission, France 1915.JPG|right|thumb|Certifying attendance at [[Francis Gleeson (priest)|Father Gleeson's]] Mission, 1915.]]\nWhile their sister battalion had been fighting on the shores of Gallipoli, the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers had continued to serve on the Western Front and faced their first major action of 1915 in the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], during which they fought at the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]].  The day before the attack was to be launched on 9 May, the battalion received [[Absolution of the dead|Absolution]] from their chaplain, [[Francis Gleeson (priest)|Father Francis Gleeson]],an event which would become depicted in the famous \"Rue du Bois\" painting by [[Fortunino Matania]].<ref>MacDonagh, pp. 51\u201352</ref> The British bombardment began at 5 a.m. and the Munsters then pressed forward with extraordinary bravery, with German fire sweeping no-mans-land. Some of the Munsters audaciously charging ahead through the German lines, briefly waving a green flag on its breastwork, then moved beyond until cut off by the British artillery bombardment that followed, which killed many men sheltering in shell craters. By 11 a.m. the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers was withdrawn with only 3 officers and 200 men remaining, having lost 19 officers and 370 men killed, wounded or captured. The Munsters was one of only two British battalions to reach the German lines but they had suffered the regiment's highest loss of any one day of the war, with 11 officers and 140 men killed in action. It was an unsuccessful day for the British forces overall, with casualties exceeding 11,000, the devastating losses exposing the British forces weakness in artillery.<ref>Staunton, pp.30\u201332</ref>\n\nThe summer was relatively quiet for the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers after the battalion moved to the [[Loos-en-Gohelle|Loos]] sector in June, with casualties in July and August occurring from shelling. With other forces being withdrawn to reinforce the [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli Campaign]], no reinforcements or recruits arrived during the summer, keeping the battalion weak as the [[Battle of Loos|Loos offensive]] began on 25 September 1915. The Munsters were held in reserve at first but they were soon tasked with holding the line and suffered over 200 casualties, leaving the battalion with around 350 soldiers all ranks, which further reduced to 250 by the time the battle died down on 13 October. [[John Redmond]] M.P., the Irish leader, visited the battalion a month later on 15 November and promised to fill the depleted 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers with Irish recruits.<ref>Staunton, pp.33\u20134</ref> There followed three months of bitter winter weather in appalling trench conditions. New recruits began arriving over the winter, but in the relative inactivity, 65 men were hit by harassing random fire while 40 men went down with frostbite and trench fever in the [[Arctic]] weather before the winter had ended.<ref>Staunton, pp.35\u201336</ref>\n\n=====1916: The Battle of the Somme=====\n[[File:Royal Munster Fusiliers Battle of the Somme.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.2|left|An illustration depicting men of the Royal Munster Fusiliers returning victoriously from their [[Battle of Ginchy|capture of Ginchy]] during the [[Battle of the Somme]].]]\nThe 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers entered the front lines in France for the first time on 23 April 1916 at the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] sector, where they slowly built up strength to 26 officers and 476 men. On 29 May, the battalion was assigned to the [[48th Brigade (United Kingdom)|48th Brigade]] of the [[16th (Irish) Division]] at [[B\u00e9thune]] and they were reinforced by members from the disbanded 9th Royal Munster Fusiliers, bringing the Battalion up to full strength. The Munsters remained in the area of the [[Loos-en-Gohelle|Loos]] salient into August with only intermittent casualties.<ref>Staunton, p.272</ref> When the 16th Irish Division was ordered south of the Somme battlefield, the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers entered the line facing the strategic town of Ginchy on 5 September, having suffered over 200 casualties by gas-shelling on the way. The Munsters took part in the ensuing attack and triumphant [[Battle of Ginchy|capture of Ginchy]] by the 16th Division but at a high cost for the battalion which was reduced to 5 officers and 305 other ranks.<ref>Staunton, p.273</ref> A London newspaper headlined ''How the Irish took Ginchy&nbsp;\u2013 Splendid daring of the Irish troops''.<ref>''Daily Express'' London, p.1&5, 12 September 1916</ref>\n\nIn May, the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers received many of the personnel from the disbanded 9th Royal Munster Fusiliers, bringing it up to strength for the summer campaign. The battalions' first noteworthy operation was the carefully planned [[s:Night raid by the Royal Munster Fusiliers|Li\u00e9vin raid]] on 25 June. It was during this action that Lieutenant [[Arthur Batten-Pooll]] would win the regiment's second Victoria Cross, although losses were heavy for the battalion with 5 officers and 60 other ranks killed or wounded.<ref>Staunton, pp.35\u201336</ref> The 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers were transferred with its division down to the Somme sector in July for the opening of the [[Battle of the Somme]], entering the lines on 14 July and capturing its objectives two days later. The battalion repulsed the German counterattack on 18 July, with an officer and 26 men killed, 127 wounded and 50 gassed. The Munsters were in reserve until 20 August, when they entered the lines once again for steady fighting but ran into heavy off-target and ineffective British artillery bombardment, killing 4 officers and 29 other ranks. A continual toll of casualties made September a costly month for the battalion. After a month's break in October, the 2 Royal Munster Fusiliers returned to the Somme for maintenance duties, then went into the mud filled front-line trenches from 27 November onwards, with a steady stream of casualties from frostbite and raids continuing to the end of December. Throughout the Somme campaign the 2RMF retained its local and Irish character.<ref>Staunton, pp.36\u201340</ref>\n\nFollowing the end of their involvement in the Battle of the Somme, 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers was moved northwards to [[Ypres]] in Belgium and also absorbed the remnants of the 8th Royal Munster Fusiliers on 23 November to bring it up to a strength of 48 officers and 1,069 men by 1 December. The Munsters spent Christmas 1916 in the trenches, but as the New Year arrived, an official report relates \"as if by mutual consent both sides ceased fire a minute or two before the close of the old year. On the stroke of midnight the pipers tuned up and gave us  ''The Old Year out and the New Year in'', ''[[A Nation Once Again]]'' ,''[[God Save Ireland]]'', and a few more songs of the old country, N.C.O.s and men joining lustily in the choruses\".<ref>Staunton, p.275</ref>\n\n=====1917: The Battle of Messines and Passchendaele=====\n[[Image:Royal Munster Fusiliers old logo.png|thumb|right|Old Royal Munster Fusiliers insignia]]\n\n{{poemquote|The Kaiser knows each Munster, by the Shamrock on his cap,\nand the famous Bengal Tiger, ever ready for a scrap.\nWith all his big battalions, Prussian guards and grenadiers,\nhe feared to face the bayonets of the Munster Fusiliers.|Verse from a song published during the Great War<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the-royal-munster-fusiliers/ |author=Dooley, Tom |title=The Royal Munster Fusiliers |magazine=History Ireland |issue=1 (Spring 1998) |volume=  6|accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nFollowing a period of rest in January 1917, the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers were returned the front trenches again in February at [[Barleux]], with the thawing weather resulting in extremely muddy conditions in the trenches. In March, the first major event was the German withdrawal from the old Somme battlefield to the newly constructed [[Hindenburg Line]]. The battalion followed across the Somme, but was held up into May removing mines and booby-traps and repairing communications. The Munsters then moved to near [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]] in [[Flanders]] for an intended amphibious landing, with an impressive strength of 43 officers and 1,070 men, which was aborted following a surprise German attack on 10 July. The Munsters were then moved with their division to [[Dunkirk]] for another amphibious attempt near [[Zeebrugge]] to link with a land offensive through [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], but this was also cancelled when the land offensive did not gain enough footing.<ref>Staunton, pp.36\u201340</ref>\n\nFor the men of the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers, rotating routine trench duties continued up to the middle of March with light casualties (2 officers and 20 men killed). The battalion rehearsed special training during April and May for the assault on the strategic [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Messines Ridge]]. The Flanders offensive began at 3.10am on 7 June 1917 with the detonation of nineteen huge mines previously burrowed under the German lines. This was followed by the advance of the 16th Irish Division opposite the village of Wytschaete, to the right the [[36th (Ulster) Division]] opposite the village of Messines, the largest ever concentration of Irish soldiers on a battlefield.<ref>Staunton, p.278</ref> The 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers took all its objectives on schedule despite the loss of nearly all of its supporting tanks. The subsequent battle was a complete success militarily for the British, with the two Irish divisions showing great fortitude, advancing over two miles in a few days with minimal losses, which was exceptional by Western Front standards. The battalion was then relieved, and returned to the Ypres salient front section in August. Continuous rain turned the battlefront into a sea of mud causing a multitude of casualties and failure to take specific positions, reducing the battalion to 37 officers and 701 men.  The Munsters were moved with its Division back south into France where it built up to 1,089 all ranks.<ref>Staunton, pp.277\u201378</ref>\n\nThe 16th (Irish) Division, and with it the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers, took up positions north of the main attack during the first [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] which opened on 21 November with the use of over 450 British tanks. The Munsters advanced with such speed that only one enemy machine gun post was manned in time to open fire, which was taken with one loss. Considering the success of capturing a difficult objective without tank support and taking 170 prisoners, losses were light, and followed previously unsuccessful attempts by other units during the summer. The 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers final front tour of 1917 ended on 2 December when the Division was moved south to take over a French section.<ref>Staunton, pp.278\u201380</ref>\n\nBy 6 November 1917, the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers now numbered 20 officers and 630 other ranks when it arrived at \"Irish Farm\" in the Ypres salient. The ground was a quagmire full of water-logged shell-holes following four months of battle. It was to be the last British effort of the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele campaign]]. The Munsters were to be one of two battalions leading the 1st Division's attack at 6 a.m. on 10 November. Weighed down with equipment, they waded waist deep through mud and water, initially taking all objectives within 45 minutes. Seeing the progress by the [[Canadian Army|Canadian]]s on the right, the men of the Munsters pressed on. However, the [[South Wales Borders]] advance had left a gap the Germans made use of to cut off most of the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers who then had to fight their way back to the British lines. A roll call took three hours later saw only 7 officers and 240 other ranks present with 12 officers and 393 other ranks having become casualties. The battalion was moved out to [[Brieulles-sur-Meuse|Brieulles]] for reforming for the rest of the year.<ref>Staunton, pp.41\u201342</ref>\n\n=====1918: The German Spring Offensive and Final Victory=====\n[[File:Royal Munster Fusiliers on the Western Front.jpg|thumbnail|left|Two officers of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers man a machine gun on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].]]\nFrom January through to March, the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers was involved in various engagements in snow, frost and mud. By St. Patrick's Day 1918, it became clear that the Germans were gaining the initiative and their forecast \"Big Move\" was awaited.<ref>Staunton, pp.278\u201380</ref> By the end of January 1918 the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers numbered 44 officers and 823 other ranks, and was then transferred to the 48th Brigade of the [[16th (Irish) Division]] on 3 February near [[P\u00e9ronne, Somme|Peronne]] where it entered the lines a week later. The division was now under the command of General [[Hubert Gough]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/the-last-days-of-the-16th-irish-division-1.3450490|title=The last days of the 16th (Irish) Division|work=Irish Times|date=24 April 2018|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe British front was at its lengthiest when the German [[Spring Offensive]] opened with a devastating bombardment early on 21 March 1918, after which a fierce attack by fresh troops was launched. The 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers suffered badly from the shelling but held the Germans up all night, before they broke through and overwhelmed the Munsters who dashed to retreat, with some making it to a high ridge trench where they were driven out and retired to [[Epehy]] by dark, fog having allowed the Germans to infiltrate easily. The next day the battalion was withdrawn to [[Tincourt-Boucly|Tincourt]] where the depleted 16th (Irish) Division was concentrated, with the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers now numbering only 290 other ranks, from 629 the day before. On 22 March, the battalion crossed back over the [[Somme River|Somme]] at [[P\u00e9ronne, Somme|P\u00e9ronne]].<ref>Staunton, pp.43\u201345</ref> By 25 March, the battalion had lost 27 officers and 550 men, as the rest tried to reform, holding off several attacks and near encirclements. The Munsters formed a 400-man column and attempted a night retreat, half reaching friendly positions next morning at [[Beaumont-Hamel|Hamel]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rickard |first=Mrs Victor |authorlink=Jessie Louisa Rickard |publisher=The Sphere |url=http://www.greatwardifferent.com/Great_War/British_Front/Munsters_01.htm |title=The Munsters in the Retreat |date=16 November 1918 |accessdate=17 March 2016 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306022216/http://www.greatwardifferent.com/Great_War/British_Front/Munsters_01.htm |archivedate= 6 March 2012 }}</ref> The 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers was fortunate to be in reserve as the Germans opened the offensive with a gas-bombardment. By the next day, the battalion was heavily engaged, the enemy using a new zigzag attack strategy. The battalion retaliated but was forced to withdraw and were quickly down to 7 officers and 450 men. There was then a general withdrawal across the Somme at [[P\u00e9ronne, Somme|Peronne]], by which time the battalion was reduced to just 290 men.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/history/clare_men_women_great_war_24.pdf|title=Claremen in the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Munster Fusiliers \"The Dirty Shirts\"|publisher=Clare Library|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe German offensive had decimated the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers to a shadow of its previous strength. The [[16th (Irish) Division (United Kingdom)|16th (Irish) Division]] was reduced to cadre, having suffered the heaviest losses of any British division during the March retreat. The 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers was transferred to the [[57th (2nd West Lancashire) Division|57th (2nd W.Lancs) Division]] which had not seen action since its arrival in February 1917.<ref>Staunton, pp.282\u201385</ref> The 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers was largely destroyed by the German offensive, losing 36 officers and 796 other ranks since 21 March. The battalion moved northwards to amalgamate with the equally hard hit 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers at [[Inghem]] on 14 April, with the resulting unit numbering 28 officers and 896 other ranks. The 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers was then reduced to a training cadre of 11 officers, who left the 16th (Irish) Division to provide instruction for newly arrived [[American Expeditionary Force]].<ref>Staunton, pp.46\u201347</ref>\n\nIn May, the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers entered the lines again at [[Arrondissement of Mantes-la-Jolie|Gommecourt]], a quiet sector during the summer. On 27 August, the battalion again entered the line for an attack near [[Croisilles, Pas-de-Calais|Croisilles]], taking enemy support trenches on the [[Hindenburg Line]] in half an hour with minimal losses. This was followed by the assault of 2 September when [[Martin Doyle]] won the battalion's third Victoria Cross on the [[Drocourt, Pas-de-Calais|Drocourt]]\u2013[[Queant]] Line south of the river [[Scarpe (river)|Scarpe]], with the battalion suffering 350 casualties. The battalion was then relieved and received replacements and trained in preparation for the assault on the [[Cambrai]] to [[Battle of Mont St. Quentin|St. Quentin]] line. With a 3,000-yard advance on 27 September, [[Arrondissement of Arras|Graincourt]] was captured by the Munsters.  The Germans counter-attacked, recapturing many positions. The battalion remained under shellfire even behind the lines and was reduced to 7 officers and 261 men by 3 October.<ref>Staunton, pp.286\u201388</ref> The battalion supported the final attack of the [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Battle of Cambrai]] on 8 October, which was found to be evacuated the following day as the Germans were in disorganised retreat.  The 57th Division was then sent north to [[Armenti\u00e8res]], with the Munsters entering the line on 17 October, with no resistance. [[Lille]] was captured the following day and the battalion provided a guard of honour for the French President's visit to the city on 21 October. The 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers was billeted in Lille until the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice of 11 November 1918]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/order-of-battle-of-divisions/57th-2nd-west-lancashire-division/|title=57th (2nd West Lancashire) Division|publisher=The Long, Long Trail|accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers began reconstruction on 7 June 1918 when most of the 6th Royal Munster Fusiliers who had returned from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] were transferred to the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers. The battalion made its last transfer to the 150th Brigade of the [[British 50th (Northumbrian) Division|50th Division]] at [[Arras]] for the beginning of the [[Hundred Days Offensive]]. On 1 October, the battalion was transported to [[\u00c9pehy]], which had been the scene of its Spring Offensive experiences back in March, and it was again ordered into the lines on 4 October, to capture [[Le Catelet]]. The Munsters largely gaining their objective, however, they had to retire after encountering heavy counterattacks and failures elsewhere on the line, losing many 6st Royal Munster Fusiliers pre-war veterans who had survived Gallipoli. The 50th Division's advance was resumed on 10 October, and the battalion was reduced to 13 officers and 411 men by 16 October.<ref>Staunton, pp.48\u201350</ref> The [[Battle of \u00c9pehy]] began on 18 October to drive the Germans behind the river, with the Munsters going in next day in fog surprising the Germans and taking many prisoner as well the objectives. The Munsters overran their objectives and were caught in another Division's barrage, with heavy losses experienced. They were then withdrawn and reorganised for what to be their final operation of the war, successfully taking a large area around [[Noyelles-sous-Lens|Haute Noyelles]] on 4 November, the number of prisoners taken indicative of the low state of German morale. After a counter-bombardment on 7 November the battalion was withdrawn for the remaining days up until the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice]].<ref>Staunton, pp.50\u201352</ref>\n\n====New Army====\n{{Main|Royal Munster Fusiliers (New Army)}}\nWith the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914 the immediate need for a considerable expansion of the British Army resulted in the formation of the [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] under [[Horatio Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]. The war target was seventy divisions in all, the New Army to have thirty volunteer divisions separate and under Army Order 324, as additional from the Regular Army, with a planned period of service of at least three years. On 7 August a general [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]-wide call for 100,000 volunteers aged 19\u201330 was issued.  The battalions were to be distinguished by the word 'Service' after their number.<ref>Staunton, Martin:  ''The Royal Munster Fusiliers (1914\u20131919)'' Ch.

The Royal Munster Fusiliers were announced to be among those regiments set to form 3rd and 4th regular battalions in February 1900,<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The War \u2013 Infantry and Militia battalions|day_of_week=Monday |date=19 February 1900 |page_number=12 |issue=36069|}}</ref> but they do not appear to have done so.<ref name=regiments/> The 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers embarked for South Africa in 1899, and would serve there throughout the entire Second Boer War. Initially, the battalion took part in [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Robert's]] advance into the [[Orange Free State]]. Following this, the battalion was attached to the [[20th Brigade (United Kingdom)|20th Brigade]] and fought at the [[Battle of Belmont (1899)|Battle of Belmont]]. With the beginning of the war's guerrilla warfare phase, the battalion took part in numerous pacification campaigns against the [[Boers]] in [[Pretoria]] and [[Western Transvaal]].<ref>Creswicke pp 160.</ref> The 3rd ([[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]]) Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers, formerly the South Cork Light Infantry, was embodied in early December 1899, and 435 officers and men embarked the ''SS Sumatra'' for [[South Africa]] on 23 February 1900.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The War \u2013 Embarcation of Troops|day_of_week=Saturday |date=24 February 1900 |page_number=9 |issue=36074|}}</ref> The 2nd Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers, arrived in South Africa from India in December 1901 and served during the closing stages of the campaign, garrisoning [[blockhouse]]s in the northeast of the [[Orange River Colony]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.angloboerwar.com/unit-information/imperial-units/574-royal-munster-fusiliers|title=Royal Munster Fusiliers|publisher=Anglo-Boer War|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the end of the war in 1902 the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers were sent to India.

The Munster's had stemmed the Germans, who were five or six times their strength, for over a day, allowing their division to escape. The loss on an entire battalion so early in the war was a disaster for the regiment. When the scattered battalion reassembled on 29 August it was down to a mere 5 officers and 196 other ranks. The remnants of the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers were withdrawn to be recuperated before returning to battle, seeing action most notably at [[Langemarck]], Belgium on 22 October. By 5 November, recruits from home brought its strength up to over 800 men.<ref>Staunton, pp.24\u20135</ref> The battalion next saw action near [[Zillebeke]], Belgium on 12 November and helped to defend against the last great German effort in the [[First Battle of Ypres]].

In March it sailed for the [[Dardanelles]], Turkey, when it numbered 28 officers and 1,002 other ranks.<ref>Staunton, p.253</ref> Turkey had joined the [[Central Powers]]'s side in November 1914, the object of the landing on the Dardanelles peninsula was to open the [[Dardanelles Strait]] in the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] to enable [[Triple Entente|Allied]] relief convoys reach Russia. Aboard the {{SS|River Clyde}}, a converted collier with a capacity for over 2,000 men, they arrived on 25 April together with the 1st Battalion [[The Royal Dublin Fusiliers]] and some companies of the [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)|Royal Hampshires]].<ref>Staunton, p.255</ref>\n\nThe SS River Clyde ran gently ashore, its exit bows facing the beach, for what was to be the troubled British [[landing at Cape Helles]]. Small boats first carried companies of ''Dubliners'' to the beach, however four hidden Turkish machine gun posts opened fire and decimated them. Lighters to the shore were roped together and two companies of Munsters poured out on to the bow's gangway but were also hit by machine gun fire, with one survivor saying they were 'literally slaughtered like rats in a trap'.<ref>Steel and Hart, pp. 90\u201395</ref> Many of the Munsters jumped from the gangway in the face of the withering fire and some drowned under their heavy equipment. Those men who continued down the gangway were mown down until all the boats and lighters were filled with dead and wounded. The ship's commanding officer, Captain [[Edward Unwin]], on being informed that they were not succeeding, replied \"in British military tradition, offensives once begun are never called off\". Unwin was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for his actions that day.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue= 29264|date=13 August 1915|page=8132|supp=y}}</ref> At daybreak the next day, just three companies of Munsters, two companies of Hampshires and one company of Dubliners had made it to the shelter of some dunes. On 26 April they took fort [[Sedd-el-Bahr]] overlooking the bay, charging and taking the village behind and held off several Turkish counterattacks. It was in this attack that the heroic actions of [[William Cosgrove]] won the regiment's first [[Victoria Cross]]. The 28 April saw a renewed attack in the [[First Battle of Krithia|Battle for Krithia village]], but the survivors of the landing were withdrawn by 29 April due to heavy losses and amalgamated with the surviving Dublin Fusiliers, to form the \"Dubsters\" battalion of 8 officers and 770 men.<ref>Staunton, pp.258\u201360</ref>\n\n[[File:The Last General Absolution of the Munsters at Rue du Bois.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|''The Last General Absolution of the Munsters at Rue du Bois'' administered <br/>by their chaplain [[Francis Gleeson (priest)|Father Francis Gleeson]]]]\nThe Turks launched a renewed attack on the night of 1 May, with one Royal Munster Fusilier saying \"they crept up in the dark into our trenches bayoneting our men before we knew it had begun. Bayoneting on both sides was terrible. At dawn the Turks were mowed down, and heaps of bodies and streams of blood remaining everywhere.\"<ref>Staunton, p.260</ref> The battalion was reduced to 4 officers and 430 men, with the Turks attempting further attacks the following days only to be driven off once again, but the combined force of Munster and Dublin Fusiliers were down to 372 men by 11 April. Both the Munsters and Dubliners received new drafts on 29 May and became separate units again. By 4 June, the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers numbered 40 officers and 500 other ranks, but many the new recruits were young and inexperienced. The Munsters withheld a further Turkish attack on 17 June, killing over 300 Turks. The arrival of further new drafts replenished the battalion to 23 officers and other 588 ranks. The Munsters took part in the Division's assault on 28 June which secured five trench lines. This provoked a general attack by the Turkish side along the Cape Helles front on 5 July, but the Turks were repulsed after suffering heavy losses.<ref>Staunton, pp.260\u201364</ref>\n\nThe 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers participated in limited actions into the middle of July. A month's rest was promised on 15 July, but by 22 July the battalion were back in action, their strength around 500 of whom only 3 officers and 314 men remained from those who first landed on 25 April. The climax of the Gallipoli came with the Suvla attack on 21 August in the [[Battle of Scimitar Hill]], the Turks inflicted severe casualties. The unsuccessful attack cost the Munsters 3 officers and 79 men that day alone.<ref>Staunton, pp.265\u201368</ref> There was little further action other than holding front lines from September through to November, when the weather worsened. Late in November, gales swept over the peninsula, hundreds were drowned in the flooded trenches or from exposure and frostbite. Faced with defeat, the British decided to withdraw from the peninsula and the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers was evacuated as it arrived, on the ''River Clyde'', sailing on 2 January 1916 for [[Alexandria]]. From there it sailed with the rest of the 29th Division and arrived in France on 22 March. 3 years of warfare still remained for the battalion on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], but the battalion had already suffered 45% of its total losses for the entire war at Gallipoli, and numbered just 24 officers and 287 men when disembarking in France.<ref>Staunton, pp.269\u201371</ref>\n\n[[File:Chaplain Fr Gleeson's Mission, France 1915.JPG|right|thumb|Certifying attendance at [[Francis Gleeson (priest)|Father Gleeson's]] Mission, 1915.]]\nWhile their sister battalion had been fighting on the shores of Gallipoli, the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers had continued to serve on the Western Front and faced their first major action of 1915 in the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], during which they fought at the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]].  The day before the attack was to be launched on 9 May, the battalion received [[Absolution of the dead|Absolution]] from their chaplain, [[Francis Gleeson (priest)|Father Francis Gleeson]],an event which would become depicted in the famous \"Rue du Bois\" painting by [[Fortunino Matania]].<ref>MacDonagh, pp. 51\u201352</ref> The British bombardment began at 5 a.m. and the Munsters then pressed forward with extraordinary bravery, with German fire sweeping no-mans-land. Some of the Munsters audaciously charging ahead through the German lines, briefly waving a green flag on its breastwork, then moved beyond until cut off by the British artillery bombardment that followed, which killed many men sheltering in shell craters. By 11 a.m. the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers was withdrawn with only 3 officers and 200 men remaining, having lost 19 officers and 370 men killed, wounded or captured. The Munsters was one of only two British battalions to reach the German lines but they had suffered the regiment's highest loss of any one day of the war, with 11 officers and 140 men killed in action. It was an unsuccessful day for the British forces overall, with casualties exceeding 11,000, the devastating losses exposing the British forces weakness in artillery.<ref>Staunton, pp.30\u201332</ref>\n\nThe summer was relatively quiet for the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers after the battalion moved to the [[Loos-en-Gohelle|Loos]] sector in June, with casualties in July and August occurring from shelling. With other forces being withdrawn to reinforce the [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli Campaign]], no reinforcements or recruits arrived during the summer, keeping the battalion weak as the [[Battle of Loos|Loos offensive]] began on 25 September 1915. The Munsters were held in reserve at first but they were soon tasked with holding the line and suffered over 200 casualties, leaving the battalion with around 350 soldiers all ranks, which further reduced to 250 by the time the battle died down on 13 October. [[John Redmond]] M.P., the Irish leader, visited the battalion a month later on 15 November and promised to fill the depleted 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers with Irish recruits.<ref>Staunton, pp.33\u20134</ref> There followed three months of bitter winter weather in appalling trench conditions. New recruits began arriving over the winter, but in the relative inactivity, 65 men were hit by harassing random fire while 40 men went down with frostbite and trench fever in the [[Arctic]] weather before the winter had ended.<ref>Staunton, pp.35\u201336</ref>\n\n=====1916: The Battle of the Somme=====\n[[File:Royal Munster Fusiliers Battle of the Somme.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.2|left|An illustration depicting men of the Royal Munster Fusiliers returning victoriously from their [[Battle of Ginchy|capture of Ginchy]] during the [[Battle of the Somme]].]]\nThe 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers entered the front lines in France for the first time on 23 April 1916 at the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] sector, where they slowly built up strength to 26 officers and 476 men. On 29 May, the battalion was assigned to the [[48th Brigade (United Kingdom)|48th Brigade]] of the [[16th (Irish) Division]] at [[B\u00e9thune]] and they were reinforced by members from the disbanded 9th Royal Munster Fusiliers, bringing the Battalion up to full strength. The Munsters remained in the area of the [[Loos-en-Gohelle|Loos]] salient into August with only intermittent casualties.<ref>Staunton, p.272</ref> When the 16th Irish Division was ordered south of the Somme battlefield, the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers entered the line facing the strategic town of Ginchy on 5 September, having suffered over 200 casualties by gas-shelling on the way. The Munsters took part in the ensuing attack and triumphant [[Battle of Ginchy|capture of Ginchy]] by the 16th Division but at a high cost for the battalion which was reduced to 5 officers and 305 other ranks.<ref>Staunton, p.273</ref> A London newspaper headlined ''How the Irish took Ginchy&nbsp;\u2013 Splendid daring of the Irish troops''.<ref>''Daily Express'' London, p.1&5, 12 September 1916</ref>\n\nIn May, the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers received many of the personnel from the disbanded 9th Royal Munster Fusiliers, bringing it up to strength for the summer campaign. The battalions' first noteworthy operation was the carefully planned [[s:Night raid by the Royal Munster Fusiliers|Li\u00e9vin raid]] on 25 June. It was during this action that Lieutenant [[Arthur Batten-Pooll]] would win the regiment's second Victoria Cross, although losses were heavy for the battalion with 5 officers and 60 other ranks killed or wounded.<ref>Staunton, pp.35\u201336</ref> The 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers were transferred with its division down to the Somme sector in July for the opening of the [[Battle of the Somme]], entering the lines on 14 July and capturing its objectives two days later. The battalion repulsed the German counterattack on 18 July, with an officer and 26 men killed, 127 wounded and 50 gassed. The Munsters were in reserve until 20 August, when they entered the lines once again for steady fighting but ran into heavy off-target and ineffective British artillery bombardment, killing 4 officers and 29 other ranks. A continual toll of casualties made September a costly month for the battalion. After a month's break in October, the 2 Royal Munster Fusiliers returned to the Somme for maintenance duties, then went into the mud filled front-line trenches from 27 November onwards, with a steady stream of casualties from frostbite and raids continuing to the end of December. Throughout the Somme campaign the 2RMF retained its local and Irish character.<ref>Staunton, pp.36\u201340</ref>\n\nFollowing the end of their involvement in the Battle of the Somme, 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers was moved northwards to [[Ypres]] in Belgium and also absorbed the remnants of the 8th Royal Munster Fusiliers on 23 November to bring it up to a strength of 48 officers and 1,069 men by 1 December. The Munsters spent Christmas 1916 in the trenches, but as the New Year arrived, an official report relates \"as if by mutual consent both sides ceased fire a minute or two before the close of the old year. On the stroke of midnight the pipers tuned up and gave us  ''The Old Year out and the New Year in'', ''[[A Nation Once Again]]'' ,''[[God Save Ireland]]'', and a few more songs of the old country, N.C.O.s and men joining lustily in the choruses\".<ref>Staunton, p.275</ref>\n\n=====1917: The Battle of Messines and Passchendaele=====\n[[Image:Royal Munster Fusiliers old logo.png|thumb|right|Old Royal Munster Fusiliers insignia]]\n\n{{poemquote|The Kaiser knows each Munster, by the Shamrock on his cap,\nand the famous Bengal Tiger, ever ready for a scrap.\nWith all his big battalions, Prussian guards and grenadiers,\nhe feared to face the bayonets of the Munster Fusiliers.|Verse from a song published during the Great War<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the-royal-munster-fusiliers/ |author=Dooley, Tom |title=The Royal Munster Fusiliers |magazine=History Ireland |issue=1 (Spring 1998) |volume=  6|accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nFollowing a period of rest in January 1917, the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers were returned the front trenches again in February at [[Barleux]], with the thawing weather resulting in extremely muddy conditions in the trenches. In March, the first major event was the German withdrawal from the old Somme battlefield to the newly constructed [[Hindenburg Line]]. The battalion followed across the Somme, but was held up into May removing mines and booby-traps and repairing communications. The Munsters then moved to near [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]] in [[Flanders]] for an intended amphibious landing, with an impressive strength of 43 officers and 1,070 men, which was aborted following a surprise German attack on 10 July. The Munsters were then moved with their division to [[Dunkirk]] for another amphibious attempt near [[Zeebrugge]] to link with a land offensive through [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], but this was also cancelled when the land offensive did not gain enough footing.<ref>Staunton, pp.36\u201340</ref>\n\nFor the men of the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers, rotating routine trench duties continued up to the middle of March with light casualties (2 officers and 20 men killed). The battalion rehearsed special training during April and May for the assault on the strategic [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Messines Ridge]]. The Flanders offensive began at 3.10am on 7 June 1917 with the detonation of nineteen huge mines previously burrowed under the German lines. This was followed by the advance of the 16th Irish Division opposite the village of Wytschaete, to the right the [[36th (Ulster) Division]] opposite the village of Messines, the largest ever concentration of Irish soldiers on a battlefield.<ref>Staunton, p.278</ref> The 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers took all its objectives on schedule despite the loss of nearly all of its supporting tanks. The subsequent battle was a complete success militarily for the British, with the two Irish divisions showing great fortitude, advancing over two miles in a few days with minimal losses, which was exceptional by Western Front standards. The battalion was then relieved, and returned to the Ypres salient front section in August. Continuous rain turned the battlefront into a sea of mud causing a multitude of casualties and failure to take specific positions, reducing the battalion to 37 officers and 701 men.  The Munsters were moved with its Division back south into France where it built up to 1,089 all ranks.<ref>Staunton, pp.277\u201378</ref>\n\nThe 16th (Irish) Division, and with it the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers, took up positions north of the main attack during the first [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] which opened on 21 November with the use of over 450 British tanks. The Munsters advanced with such speed that only one enemy machine gun post was manned in time to open fire, which was taken with one loss. Considering the success of capturing a difficult objective without tank support and taking 170 prisoners, losses were light, and followed previously unsuccessful attempts by other units during the summer. The 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers final front tour of 1917 ended on 2 December when the Division was moved south to take over a French section.<ref>Staunton, pp.278\u201380</ref>\n\nBy 6 November 1917, the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers now numbered 20 officers and 630 other ranks when it arrived at \"Irish Farm\" in the Ypres salient. The ground was a quagmire full of water-logged shell-holes following four months of battle. It was to be the last British effort of the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele campaign]]. The Munsters were to be one of two battalions leading the 1st Division's attack at 6 a.m. on 10 November. Weighed down with equipment, they waded waist deep through mud and water, initially taking all objectives within 45 minutes. Seeing the progress by the [[Canadian Army|Canadian]]s on the right, the men of the Munsters pressed on. However, the [[South Wales Borders]] advance had left a gap the Germans made use of to cut off most of the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers who then had to fight their way back to the British lines. A roll call took three hours later saw only 7 officers and 240 other ranks present with 12 officers and 393 other ranks having become casualties. The battalion was moved out to [[Brieulles-sur-Meuse|Brieulles]] for reforming for the rest of the year.<ref>Staunton, pp.41\u201342</ref>\n\n=====1918: The German Spring Offensive and Final Victory=====\n[[File:Royal Munster Fusiliers on the Western Front.jpg|thumbnail|left|Two officers of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers man a machine gun on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].]]\nFrom January through to March, the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers was involved in various engagements in snow, frost and mud. By St. Patrick's Day 1918, it became clear that the Germans were gaining the initiative and their forecast \"Big Move\" was awaited.<ref>Staunton, pp.278\u201380</ref> By the end of January 1918 the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers numbered 44 officers and 823 other ranks, and was then transferred to the 48th Brigade of the [[16th (Irish) Division]] on 3 February near [[P\u00e9ronne, Somme|Peronne]] where it entered the lines a week later.

The 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers suffered badly from the shelling but held the Germans up all night, before they broke through and overwhelmed the Munsters who dashed to retreat, with some making it to a high ridge trench where they were driven out and retired to [[Epehy]] by dark, fog having allowed the Germans to infiltrate easily. The next day the battalion was withdrawn to [[Tincourt-Boucly|Tincourt]] where the depleted 16th (Irish) Division was concentrated, with the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers now numbering only 290 other ranks, from 629 the day before. On 22 March, the battalion crossed back over the [[Somme River|Somme]] at [[P\u00e9ronne, Somme|P\u00e9ronne]].<ref>Staunton, pp.43\u201345</ref> By 25 March, the battalion had lost 27 officers and 550 men, as the rest tried to reform, holding off several attacks and near encirclements. The Munsters formed a 400-man column and attempted a night retreat, half reaching friendly positions next morning at [[Beaumont-Hamel|Hamel]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rickard |first=Mrs Victor |authorlink=Jessie Louisa Rickard |publisher=The Sphere |url=http://www.greatwardifferent.com/Great_War/British_Front/Munsters_01.htm |title=The Munsters in the Retreat |date=16 November 1918 |accessdate=17 March 2016 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306022216/http://www.greatwardifferent.com/Great_War/British_Front/Munsters_01.htm |archivedate= 6 March 2012 }}</ref> The 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers was fortunate to be in reserve as the Germans opened the offensive with a gas-bombardment. By the next day, the battalion was heavily engaged, the enemy using a new zigzag attack strategy. The battalion retaliated but was forced to withdraw and were quickly down to 7 officers and 450 men. There was then a general withdrawal across the Somme at [[P\u00e9ronne, Somme|Peronne]], by which time the battalion was reduced to just 290 men.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/history/clare_men_women_great_war_24.pdf|title=Claremen in the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Munster Fusiliers \"The Dirty Shirts\"|publisher=Clare Library|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe German offensive had decimated the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers to a shadow of its previous strength. The [[16th (Irish) Division (United Kingdom)|16th (Irish) Division]] was reduced to cadre, having suffered the heaviest losses of any British division during the March retreat. The 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers was transferred to the [[57th (2nd West Lancashire) Division|57th (2nd W.Lancs) Division]] which had not seen action since its arrival in February 1917.<ref>Staunton, pp.282\u201385</ref> The 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers was largely destroyed by the German offensive, losing 36 officers and 796 other ranks since 21 March. The battalion moved northwards to amalgamate with the equally hard hit 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers at [[Inghem]] on 14 April, with the resulting unit numbering 28 officers and 896 other ranks. The 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers was then reduced to a training cadre of 11 officers, who left the 16th (Irish) Division to provide instruction for newly arrived [[American Expeditionary Force]].<ref>Staunton, pp.46\u201347</ref>\n\nIn May, the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers entered the lines again at [[Arrondissement of Mantes-la-Jolie|Gommecourt]], a quiet sector during the summer. On 27 August, the battalion again entered the line for an attack near [[Croisilles, Pas-de-Calais|Croisilles]], taking enemy support trenches on the [[Hindenburg Line]] in half an hour with minimal losses. This was followed by the assault of 2 September when [[Martin Doyle]] won the battalion's third Victoria Cross on the [[Drocourt, Pas-de-Calais|Drocourt]]\u2013[[Queant]] Line south of the river [[Scarpe (river)|Scarpe]], with the battalion suffering 350 casualties. The battalion was then relieved and received replacements and trained in preparation for the assault on the [[Cambrai]] to [[Battle of Mont St. Quentin|St. Quentin]] line. With a 3,000-yard advance on 27 September, [[Arrondissement of Arras|Graincourt]] was captured by the Munsters.  The Germans counter-attacked, recapturing many positions. The battalion remained under shellfire even behind the lines and was reduced to 7 officers and 261 men by 3 October.<ref>Staunton, pp.286\u201388</ref> The battalion supported the final attack of the [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Battle of Cambrai]] on 8 October, which was found to be evacuated the following day as the Germans were in disorganised retreat.  The 57th Division was then sent north to [[Armenti\u00e8res]], with the Munsters entering the line on 17 October, with no resistance. [[Lille]] was captured the following day and the battalion provided a guard of honour for the French President's visit to the city on 21 October. The 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers was billeted in Lille until the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice of 11 November 1918]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/order-of-battle-of-divisions/57th-2nd-west-lancashire-division/|title=57th (2nd West Lancashire) Division|publisher=The Long, Long Trail|accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers began reconstruction on 7 June 1918 when most of the 6th Royal Munster Fusiliers who had returned from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] were transferred to the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers. The battalion made its last transfer to the 150th Brigade of the [[British 50th (Northumbrian) Division|50th Division]] at [[Arras]] for the beginning of the [[Hundred Days Offensive]]. On 1 October, the battalion was transported to [[\u00c9pehy]], which had been the scene of its Spring Offensive experiences back in March, and it was again ordered into the lines on 4 October, to capture [[Le Catelet]]. The Munsters largely gaining their objective, however, they had to retire after encountering heavy counterattacks and failures elsewhere on the line, losing many 6st Royal Munster Fusiliers pre-war veterans who had survived Gallipoli. The 50th Division's advance was resumed on 10 October, and the battalion was reduced to 13 officers and 411 men by 16 October.<ref>Staunton, pp.48\u201350</ref> The [[Battle of \u00c9pehy]] began on 18 October to drive the Germans behind the river, with the Munsters going in next day in fog surprising the Germans and taking many prisoner as well the objectives. The Munsters overran their objectives and were caught in another Division's barrage, with heavy losses experienced. They were then withdrawn and reorganised for what to be their final operation of the war, successfully taking a large area around [[Noyelles-sous-Lens|Haute Noyelles]] on 4 November, the number of prisoners taken indicative of the low state of German morale. After a counter-bombardment on 7 November the battalion was withdrawn for the remaining days up until the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice]].<ref>Staunton, pp.50\u201352</ref>\n\n====New Army====\n{{Main|Royal Munster Fusiliers (New Army)}}\nWith the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914 the immediate need for a considerable expansion of the British Army resulted in the formation of the [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] under [[Horatio Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]. The war target was seventy divisions in all, the New Army to have thirty volunteer divisions separate and under Army Order 324, as additional from the Regular Army, with a planned period of service of at least three years. On 7 August a general [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]-wide call for 100,000 volunteers aged 19\u201330 was issued.  The battalions were to be distinguished by the word 'Service' after their number.<ref>Staunton, Martin:  ''The Royal Munster Fusiliers (1914\u20131919)'' Ch.

The 8th and 9th (Service) Battalions, Royal Munster Fusiliers followed as units of the [[16th (Irish) Division]]'s 47th and 48th Brigades, part of Kitchener's second new ''K2 Army Group''. The 16th Division was placed under the command of [[Major General]] [[William Hickie]].<ref>Staunton, p.221</ref> In the course of the war heavy losses suffered by the two Regular Royal Munster Fusilier Battalions caused the new service battalions to be disbanded and absorbed in turn by the regular battalions, the last on 2 June 1918 when the 8th (Service) Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers was amalgamated with the 1st Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/royal-munster-fusiliers/|title=Royal Munster Fusiliers|publisher=The Long, Long Trail|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Reserve Army====\n{{Main|Royal Munster Fusiliers (Reserves)}}\nAt the outbreak of war the Royal Munster Fusiliers three reserve battalions were all mobilised on 4 August 1914 and the regimental colours were sent to Tralee for safekeeping there until after the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice]].<ref>Staunton p.158</ref> Initially planned to be used for home defence, with the 3rd Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers being based in Cork while both the 4th and 5th Battalions, Royal Munster Fusiliers were based in [[County Kerry|Kerry]]. However, mounting casualties to the regiment's regular battalion meant that replacements were increasingly drawn from the reservists as the war went on.<ref>Staunton p.160</ref>\n\n===Disbandment===\n[[File:The British Army in the Interwar Period Q31523B.jpg|thumbnail|right|Ceremony of laying up of the colours of the Royal Munster Fusiliers at the Tower of London, 15 February 1923.]]\nLast reassembled in France in December before [[demobilisation]], the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers numbered 25 officers and 581 other ranks. After demobilisation by February, the last cadre of 14 officers and 54 other ranks left France in June 1919 and was reabsorbed into the reformed battalion on the [[Isle of Wight]] numbering 900 men, of these 500 with war service. Their last commander wrote \"Its losses amounted to 179 officers and 4,088 rank and file killed, wounded or missing. There were twenty-eight changes in the battalion's command during the war. The battalion retained its essentially Irish character to the end of the war, and was first to last composed of voluntarily enlisted soldiers. During the war 346 officers and over 8,000 O.R.s passed through its ranks\".<ref>Staunton, p.53; & note from Jervis, H. S.: pp.63\u201364</ref> The 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers remained a predominantly Irish battalion to the end of the war, composed of many Dublin Fusiliers from May 1918. At least 43 officers and 869 other ranks died in action with the battalion during the war. It was demobilised in December, reducing it to 13 officers and 89 others, before leaving France.<ref>Staunton, pp.288\u201390</ref>\n\nIn May 1919, after returning to England, the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers absorbed the 3rd Royal Munster Fusiliers at [[Plymouth]]. It left for [[Silesia]] in September 1921, returning the following April to be disbanded in July 1922, ending a history going back 250 years.<ref>Staunton, pp.288\u201390</ref> The 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers served in [[Egypt]] from November 1919 to May 1922, returning for demobilisation and disbandment in July 1922. Due to substantial defence cuts and the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922 (predecessor of the [[Republic of Ireland]]), it was agreed that the six former [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]] regiments would be disbanded,<ref name=murphy/><ref>Army Order 78/1922</ref> including the Royal Munster Fusiliers. On 12 June, five regimental [[Colour (flag)|Colours]] were laid up in a ceremony at St George's Hall, [[Windsor Castle]] in the presence of [[George V of the United Kingdom|HM King George V]].<ref>Harris, Major Henry E. D., p. 209</ref> (The [[South Irish Horse]] had sent a Regimental engraving because the regiment chose to have its standard remain in [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]]).

In its ranks, Royal Munster Fusiliers ex\u2013servicemen, veterans from World War I, served at the side of [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] ex-guerrillas who only a few months earlier had fought against the British Army in the [[Irish War of Independence]]. They brought considerable combat experience with them and by May 1923 comprised 50 per cent of its 53,000 soldiers and 20 per cent of its officers.<ref>Cottrell, p. 23</ref> The Irish National Army reached a strength of 60,000.<ref>Harris, Major Henry E.
