The \"Benefactor\" asked to see him the next morning, and made him a lieutenant of his Presidential Guard.<ref>Levy (2005), p. 37</ref> Their relationship lasted throughout their lives, went up and down, mostly close, but not without episodes of danger for Rubirosa, and defined his professional career when he became a diplomat of the Dominican Republic in 1936.\n\nIn this role, he was sent to embassies, first at Berlin (during the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympic Games]]) and soon to Paris, where he spent most of his time; he also served at the embassies at [[Vichy]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Rome]], [[Havana]] (witnessing the [[Cuban Revolution]]), and [[Brussels]]. He was a frequent visitor to New York, Washington, Florida, and California. \"Rubi\", who defined himself a ''Trujillista'', moved freely among the rich and famous, made the connections, and kept the secrets.  His 1938 divorce of Trujillo's daughter seemed, at least on the surface, to have little influence over his erstwhile father-in-law's affection for, or trust in, him. However, at times, when his escapades stirred up too much notoriety, Trujillo would dismiss him &ndash; as from his post in Paris in 1953 &ndash; or move him to another place. Trujillo recognized what an asset Rubirosa was for his regime, remarking: \"He is good at his job, because women like him and he is a wonderful liar.\"<ref>Levy (2005), p. 160</ref>\n\nAfter Trujillo's assassination on May 30, 1961, Rubirosa supported his son as successor and attempted to persuade [[John F. Kennedy]] to help his government. When [[Ramfis Trujillo]] and his family fled the Dominican Republic, Rubirosa's career came to an end. On January 2, 1962, the Council of State removed him from his unique appointment as \"Inspector of Embassies\".<ref>Levy (2005), p. 294f</ref> After he lost his [[diplomatic immunity]], he was questioned by the New York [[District Attorney]] concerning the disappearance of Trujillo opponents [[Sergio Bencosme]] in 1935 and [[Jesus Gal\u00edndez]] in 1956, but was never charged. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n==Personal life==\nRubirosa was linked romantically to [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Marilyn Monroe]],<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/dating/player_250/287_iconic-players-porfirio-rubirosa.html|title=Iconic Players: Porfirio Rubirosa|author=The Player|work=AskMen|accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> [[Ava Gardner]], [[Maria Montez]],  [[Rita Hayworth]], [[Dorothy Dandridge]], [[Lupe Velez]], [[Soraya Esfandiary]], [[Peggy Hopkins Joyce]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Veronica Lake]], [[Kim Novak]], [[Judy Garland]], and [[Eva Peron]].<ref name=\":1\" /> He dallied with his ex-wife [[Rafael Trujillo|Flor de Oro Trujillo Ledesma]] during his marriage to [[Doris Duke]].

The \"Benefactor\" asked to see him the next morning, and made him a lieutenant of his Presidential Guard.<ref>Levy (2005), p. 37</ref> Their relationship lasted throughout their lives, went up and down, mostly close, but not without episodes of danger for Rubirosa, and defined his professional career when he became a diplomat of the Dominican Republic in 1936.\n\nIn this role, he was sent to embassies, first at Berlin (during the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympic Games]]) and soon to Paris, where he spent most of his time; he also served at the embassies at [[Vichy]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Rome]], [[Havana]] (witnessing the [[Cuban Revolution]]), and [[Brussels]]. He was a frequent visitor to New York, Washington, Florida, and California. \"Rubi\", who defined himself a ''Trujillista'', moved freely among the rich and famous, made the connections, and kept the secrets.  His 1938 divorce of Trujillo's daughter seemed, at least on the surface, to have little influence over his erstwhile father-in-law's affection for, or trust in, him. However, at times, when his escapades stirred up too much notoriety, Trujillo would dismiss him &ndash; as from his post in Paris in 1953 &ndash; or move him to another place. Trujillo recognized what an asset Rubirosa was for his regime, remarking: \"He is good at his job, because women like him and he is a wonderful liar.\"<ref>Levy (2005), p. 160</ref>\n\nAfter Trujillo's assassination on May 30, 1961, Rubirosa supported his son as successor and attempted to persuade [[John F. Kennedy]] to help his government. When [[Ramfis Trujillo]] and his family fled the Dominican Republic, Rubirosa's career came to an end. On January 2, 1962, the Council of State removed him from his unique appointment as \"Inspector of Embassies\".<ref>Levy (2005), p. 294f</ref> After he lost his [[diplomatic immunity]], he was questioned by the New York [[District Attorney]] concerning the disappearance of Trujillo opponents [[Sergio Bencosme]] in 1935 and [[Jesus Gal\u00edndez]] in 1956, but was never charged. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n==Personal life==\nRubirosa was linked romantically to [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Marilyn Monroe]],<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/dating/player_250/287_iconic-players-porfirio-rubirosa.html|title=Iconic Players: Porfirio Rubirosa|author=The Player|work=AskMen|accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> [[Ava Gardner]], [[Maria Montez]],  [[Rita Hayworth]], [[Dorothy Dandridge]], [[Lupe Velez]], [[Soraya Esfandiary]], [[Peggy Hopkins Joyce]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Veronica Lake]], [[Kim Novak]], [[Judy Garland]], and [[Eva Peron]].<ref name=\":1\"/> He dallied with his ex-wife [[Rafael Trujillo|Flor de Oro Trujillo Ledesma]] during his marriage to [[Doris Duke]].
