The narrative follows Oedipa Maas, a young Californian woman, who begins to embrace a [[conspiracy theory]] as she possibly unearths a centuries-old conflict between two mail distribution companies; only one of these companies, [[Thurn-und-Taxis-Post|Thurn and Taxis]], actually existed (1806\u201367) and was the first private firm to distribute postal mail. Like most of Pynchon's output, ''Lot 49'' is often described as [[postmodernist literature]]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' included the novel in its \"TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Lev Grossman|url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/|title=TIME's Critics pick the 100 Best Novels 1923 to the Present|date=16 October 2005|accessdate=2008-12-15|publisher=time.com|author2=Richard Lacayo}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the mid-1960s, Oedipa Maas lives a fairly comfortable life in the (fictional) northern Californian village of Kinneret, despite her lackluster marriage with Mucho Maas, a rudderless [[radio jockey]], and her sessions with Dr. Hilarius, an unhinged German psychotherapist who tries to medicate his patients with [[LSD]]. One day, Oedipa learns of the death of an ex-lover, Pierce Inverarity, an incredibly wealthy real-estate mogul, who has left her as the executor of his massive estate. Inverarity appears to have owned or financed nearly all the goings-on in [[Narcissus of Jerusalem|San Narciso]], a (fictional) southern Californian city near [[Los Angeles]]. Oedipa goes to San Narciso to meet Inverarity's lawyer, a former [[child actor]] named Metzger, and they begin an affair, which fascinates a local teenaged rock band, The Paranoids, who begin following them [[voyeurism|voyeuristically]]. At a bar, Oedipa notices the graffitied symbol of a [[Mute (music)|muted]] [[post horn]] with the label \"W.A.S.T.E.\", and she chats with Mike Fallopian, a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] historian and critic of the postal system, who claims to use a secret postal service.\n[[Image:MutedPosthorn.png|right|thumb|The novel's ubiquitous muted [[post horn]] symbol]]\n\nIt surfaces that Inverarity had [[American Mafia|Mafia connections]], illicitly attempting to sell the bones of forgotten U.S. [[World War Two]] soldiers for use as charcoal to a cigarette company. One of The Paranoids mentions that this strongly reminds him of a [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] [[revenge play]] he recently saw called ''The Courier's Tragedy''. Intrigued by the coincidence, Oedipa and Metzger attend a performance of the play, which briefly mentions the name \"Tristero\". After the show, Oedipa approaches the play's director, Randolph Driblette, but he deflects her questions about the mention of the unusual name. After seeing a man scribbling the post horn symbol, Oedipa seeks out Mike Fallopian, who tells her he suspects a conspiracy. This is supported when watermarks of the muted horn symbol are discovered hidden on Inverarity's private stamp collection. The symbol appears to be a muted variant of the [[coat of arms]] of [[Thurn-und-Taxis-Post|Thurn and Taxis]]: an 18th-century European postal monopoly that suppressed all opposition, including Trystero (or Tristero), a competing postal service that was defeated but possibly driven underground. Based on the symbolism of the mute, Oedipa theorizes that Trystero continues to exist as a countercultural secret society with unknown goals.\n\nShe researches an older censored edition of ''The Courier's Tragedy'', which confirms that Dribelette indeed made a conscious choice to include the \"Tristero\" line. She seeks answers through a machine claimed to have psychic abilities, but the experience is awkward and unsuccessful. As she feverishly wanders the [[Bay Area]], the muted post horn symbol appears among an engineer's doodles, as part of children's sidewalk drawings, amidst [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ideograms in a shop window, and in many other places. Finally, a nameless man at a [[gay bar]] tells her that the muted horn symbol simply represents an anonymous [[support group]] for people with [[broken heart]]s: Inamorati Anonymous. She directly witnesses people referring to and using mailboxes disguised as regular waste bins marked with \"W.A.S.T.E.\" (later suggested to be an [[acronym]] for \"We Await Silent Tristero's Empire\"). Even so, Oedipa sinks into paranoia, wondering if Trystero actually exists or if she is merely overthinking a series of false clues with no definite connections. \n\nFearing for her sanity, Oedipa makes an impromptu visit to Dr. Hilarius, only to find him having lost his own mind, firing a gun randomly and raving madly about his days as a Nazi [[medical intern]] at [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]]. She helps the police subdue him, only to return home to find that her husband Mucho has lost his mind in his own way, having become addicted to LSD. Oedipa consults an English professor about ''The Courier's Tragedy'', learns that Randolph Driblette has mysteriously committed suicide, and is left pondering whether Trystero is simply a prolonged hallucination, an actual historical plot, or some elaborate practical joke that Inverarity arranged for her before his death. The book ends with Oedipa at an auction of Inverarity's possessions, waiting on the bidding of lot 49, which contains his stamp collection. Having learned that a particular bidder is interested in the stamps, she hopes to discover if this person is a representative of the Trystero secret society.\n\n==Characters==\n* Oedipa Maas \u2013 The protagonist. After her ex-boyfriend, the real estate mogul Pierce Inverarity, dies, she is appointed co-[[executor]] of his estate, and discovers and begins to unravel what may or may not be a world conspiracy.\n* Wendell \"Mucho\" Maas \u2013 Oedipa's husband, Mucho once worked in a used-car lot but recently became a disc jockey for KCUF radio in Kinneret, California.\n* Metzger \u2013 A lawyer who works for Warpe, Wistfull, Kubitschek and McMingus. He has been assigned to help Oedipa execute Pierce's estate. He and Oedipa have an affair.\n* Miles, Dean, Serge and Leonard \u2013  The four members of the band The Paranoids, a small-time rock band consisting of marijuana-smoking American teenagers who sing with British accents and have haircuts inspired by [[The Beatles]].\n* Dr. Hilarius \u2013  Oedipa's psychiatrist, who tries to prescribe LSD to Oedipa as well as other housewives. Toward the end of the book, he goes crazy and admits to being a former [[Nazi]] medical intern at [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], where he worked in a program on experimentally-induced insanity, which he supposed was a more \"humane\" way of dealing with Jewish prisoners than outright execution.\n* Stanley Koteks \u2013  An employee of [[Yoyodyne]] Corporation who knows something about the Trystero. Oedipa meets him when she wanders into his office while touring the plant.\n* John Nefastis \u2013  A scientist obsessed with perpetual motion. He has tried to invent a type of [[Maxwell's demon]] to create a [[perpetual motion machine]]. Oedipa visits him to see the machine after learning about him from Stanley Koteks; however, the visit is unproductive and she runs out the door after he propositions her.\n* Randolph \"Randy\" Driblette \u2013  Director of ''The Courier's Tragedy'' by Jacobean playwright Richard Wharfinger and a leading Wharfinger scholar; he deflects Oedipa's questions and dismisses her theories when she approaches him taking a shower after the show; later, he commits suicide by walking into the Pacific before Oedipa can follow up with him, but the initial meeting with him spurs her to go on a quest to find the meaning behind Trystero.\n* Mike Fallopian \u2013 Oedipa and Metzger meet Fallopian in The Scope, a bar frequented by Yoyodyne employees. He tells them about The Peter Pinguid Society, a right-wing, anti-government organization that he belongs to.\n* Genghis Cohen \u2013 The most eminent [[Philately|philatelist]] in the Los Angeles area, Cohen was hired to inventory and appraise the deceased's stamp collection. Oedipa and he discuss stamps and forgeries, and he discovers the horn symbol watermark on Inverarity's stamps.\n* Professor Emory Bortz \u2013 Formerly of [[UC Berkeley]], now teaching at San Narciso, Bortz wrote the editor's preface in a version of Wharfinger's works. Oedipa tracks him down to learn more about Trystero.\n\n==Critical reception==\nCritics have read the book as both an \"exemplary [[postmodernism|postmodern]] text\" and an outright [[parody]] of postmodernism.<ref name=\"castillo\">Castillo, Debra A. \"[[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]] and Pynchon: The Tenuous Symmetries of Art\", in ''New Essays'', ed.

Introduction to ''Slow Learner'' (Boston: Little, Brown: 1984). {{ISBN|0-316-72442-4}}.</ref>\n\n==Allusions in the book==\n[[Image:crying of lot 49.jpg|thumb|right|210px|''The Crying of Lot 49'' book cover, featuring the Thurn und Taxis post horn]]\nAs ever with Pynchon's writing, the labyrinthine plots offer myriad linked cultural references. Knowing these references allows for a much richer reading of the work. J. Kerry Grant wrote ''A Companion to the Crying of Lot 49'' in an attempt to catalogue these references but it is neither definitive nor complete.<ref name=\"grant\">Grant, J. Kerry.  ''A Companion to The Crying of Lot 49'' (Athens:  University of Georgia Press, 1994).  {{ISBN|0-8203-1635-0}}.</ref>\n\n===The Beatles===\n\n''The Crying of Lot 49'' was published shortly after [[Beatlemania]] and the \"[[British invasion]]\" that took place in the United States and other Western countries. Internal context clues indicate that the novel is set in the summer of 1964, the year in which ''[[A Hard Day's Night (movie)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' was released. Pynchon makes a wide variety of Beatles allusions. Most prominent are The Paranoids, a band composed of cheerful [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] smokers whose lead singer, Miles, is a high-school dropout described as having a \"Beatle haircut.\" The Paranoids all speak with American accents but sing in English ones; at one point, a guitar player is forced to relinquish control of a car to his girlfriend because he cannot see through his hair. It is not clear whether Pynchon was aware of the Beatles' own nickname for themselves, \"Los Para Noias\"; since the novel is replete with other references to paranoia, Pynchon may have chosen the band's name for other reasons.<ref name=\"harrison\">[[George Harrison|Harrison, George MBE]] ''et al.''  ''The Beatles Anthology'' (San Francisco: Chronicle Books, 2000).  {{ISBN|0-8118-2684-8}}.</ref>\n\nPynchon refers to a rock song, \"I Want to Kiss Your Feet\", an adulteration of \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\". The song's artist, Sick Dick and the Volkswagens, evokes the names of such historical rock groups as  [[the El Dorados]], [[the Edsels]], [[the Cadillacs]] and the Jaguars (as well as an early name the Beatles themselves used, \"Long John and the Silver Beetles\"). \"Sick Dick\" may also refer to Richard Wharfinger, author of \"that ill, ill  [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean revenge play]]\" known as ''The Courier's Tragedy''.<ref name=\"grant\"/> The song's title also keeps up a recurring sequence of allusions to [[Narcissus of Jerusalem|Saint Narcissus]], a 3rd-century bishop of [[Jerusalem]].\n\nLate in the novel, Oedipa's husband, Mucho Maas, a disc jockey at Kinneret [[List of fictional radio stations|radio station]] [[Fuck|KCUF]], describes his experience of discovering the Beatles. Mucho refers to their early song \"[[She Loves You]]\", as well as hinting at the areas the Beatles were later to explore.  Pynchon writes,\n\n<blockquote>Whenever I put the headset on now,\" he'd continued, \"I really do understand what I find there. When those kids sing about 'She loves you,' yeah well, you know, she does, she's any number of people, all over the world, back through time, different colors, sizes, ages, shapes, distances from death, but she loves. And the 'you' is everybody. And herself. Oedipa, the human voice, you know, it's a flipping miracle.\" His eyes brimming, reflecting the color of beer. \"Baby,\" she said, helpless, knowing of nothing she could do for this, and afraid for him. He put a little clear plastic bottle on the table between them. She stared at the pills in it, and then understood. \"That's [[LSD]]?\" she said.</blockquote>\n\n===Vladimir Nabokov===<!-- This section is linked from [[Thomas Pynchon]] -->\nPynchon, like [[Kurt Vonnegut]], was a student at [[Cornell University]], where he probably at least audited [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s Literature 312 class. (Nabokov had no recollection of him, but Nabokov's wife V\u00e9ra recalls grading Pynchon's examination papers, thanks only to his handwriting, \"half printing, half script\".)<ref name=\"appel\">Appel, Alfred Jr.  Interview, published in ''Wisconsin Studies in Contemporary Literature'' '''8,''' No. 2 (spring 1967).  Reprinted in ''Strong Opinions'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1973).</ref>  The year before Pynchon graduated, Nabokov's novel ''[[Lolita]]'' was published in the United States. ''Lolita'' introduced the word \"nymphet\" to describe a girl between the ages of nine and fourteen, sexually attractive to the pedophile main character, [[Humbert Humbert]] and it was also used in [[Lolita (1962 film)|the novel's adaptation to cinema in 1962]] by [[Stanley Kubrick]]. In the following years, mainstream usage altered the word's meaning to apply to older girls. Perhaps appropriately, Pynchon provides an early example of the modern \"nymphet\" usage entering the [[wikt:canon|literary canon]]. Serge, The Paranoids' teenage counter-tenor, loses his girlfriend to a middle-aged lawyer. At one point he expresses his  [[angst]] in song:\n\n:What chance has a lonely surfer boy\n:For the love of a surfer chick,\n:With all these Humbert Humbert cats\n:Coming on so big and sick?\n:For me, my baby was a woman,\n:For him she's just another nymphet.\n\n===Remedios Varo===\nNear the beginning of ''The Crying of Lot 49'', Oedipa recalls a trip to an art museum in Mexico with Inverarity, during which she encountered a painting, ''Bordando el Manto Terrestre'' by [[Remedios Varo]]. The painting shows eight women inside a tower, where they are presumably held captive. Six maidens are weaving a tapestry that flows out of the windows. The tapestry seems to constitute the world outside of the tower. Oedipa's reaction to the tapestry gives us some insight into her difficulty in determining what is real and what is a fiction created by Inverarity for her benefit:\n\n<blockquote>She had looked down at her feet and known, then, because of a painting, that what she stood on had only been woven together a couple thousand miles away in her own tower, was only by accident known as Mexico, and so Pierce had taken her away from nothing, there'd been no escape.</blockquote>\n\n===''The Courier's Tragedy''===\nPynchon devotes a significant part of the book to a play-within-a-book, a detailed description of a performance of an imaginary [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] [[revenge play]], involving intrigues between Thurn und Taxis and Trystero. Like \"The Mousetrap\", based on \"The Murder of Gonzago\" that [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] placed within ''[[Hamlet]],'' the events and atmosphere of ''The Courier's Tragedy'' (by the fictional Richard Wharfinger) mirror those transpiring around them. In many aspects it resembles a typical revenge play, such as ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' by [[Thomas Kyd]], ''[[Hamlet]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] and plays by [[John Webster]] and [[Cyril Tourneur]].\n\n==References in popular culture==\n* [[Radiohead]] alludes to the novel in the name of their online merchandise shop and mailing list, W.A.S.T.E.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://observer.com/2017/06/radiohead-o-k-computer-rolling-stone-pitchfork/|title=How Radiohead\u2019s \u2018O.K.

After her ex-boyfriend, the real estate mogul Pierce Inverarity, dies, she is appointed co-[[executor]] of his estate, and discovers and begins to unravel what may or may not be a world conspiracy.\n* Wendell \"Mucho\" Maas \u2013  Oedipa's husband, Mucho once worked in a used-car lot but recently became a disc jockey for KCUF radio in Kinneret, California.\n* Metzger \u2013 A lawyer who works for Warpe, Wistfull, Kubitschek and McMingus. He has been assigned to help Oedipa execute Pierce's estate. He and Oedipa have an affair.\n* Miles, Dean, Serge and Leonard \u2013  The four members of the band The Paranoids, a small-time rock band consisting of marijuana-smoking American teenagers who sing with British accents and have haircuts inspired by [[The Beatles]].\n* Dr. Hilarius \u2013  Oedipa's psychiatrist, who tries to prescribe LSD to Oedipa as well as other housewives. Toward the end of the book, he goes crazy and admits to being a former [[Nazi]] medical intern at [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], where he worked in a program on experimentally-induced insanity, which he supposed was a more \"humane\" way of dealing with Jewish prisoners than outright execution.\n* Stanley Koteks \u2013  An employee of [[Yoyodyne]] Corporation who knows something about the Trystero. Oedipa meets him when she wanders into his office while touring the plant.\n* John Nefastis \u2013  A scientist obsessed with perpetual motion. He has tried to invent a type of [[Maxwell's demon]] to create a [[perpetual motion machine]]. Oedipa visits him to see the machine after learning about him from Stanley Koteks; however, the visit is unproductive and she runs out the door after he propositions her.\n* Randolph \"Randy\" Driblette \u2013  Director of ''The Courier's Tragedy'' by Jacobean playwright Richard Wharfinger and a leading Wharfinger scholar; he deflects Oedipa's questions and dismisses her theories when she approaches him taking a shower after the show; later, he commits suicide by walking into the Pacific before Oedipa can follow up with him, but the initial meeting with him spurs her to go on a quest to find the meaning behind Trystero.\n* Mike Fallopian \u2013 Oedipa and Metzger meet Fallopian in The Scope, a bar frequented by Yoyodyne employees. He tells them about The Peter Pinguid Society, a right-wing, anti-government organization that he belongs to.\n* Genghis Cohen \u2013 The most eminent [[Philately|philatelist]] in the Los Angeles area, Cohen was hired to inventory and appraise the deceased's stamp collection. Oedipa and he discuss stamps and forgeries, and he discovers the horn symbol watermark on Inverarity's stamps.\n* Professor Emory Bortz \u2013 Formerly of [[UC Berkeley]], now teaching at San Narciso, Bortz wrote the editor's preface in a version of Wharfinger's works. Oedipa tracks him down to learn more about Trystero.\n\n==Critical reception==\nCritics have read the book as both an \"exemplary [[postmodernism|postmodern]] text\" and an outright [[parody]] of postmodernism.<ref name=\"castillo\">Castillo, Debra A. \"[[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]] and Pynchon: The Tenuous Symmetries of Art\", in ''New Essays'', ed.

Introduction to ''Slow Learner'' (Boston: Little, Brown: 1984). {{ISBN|0-316-72442-4}}.</ref>\n\n==Allusions in the book==\n[[Image:crying of lot 49.jpg|thumb|right|210px|''The Crying of Lot 49'' book cover, featuring the Thurn und Taxis post horn]]\nAs ever with Pynchon's writing, the labyrinthine plots offer myriad linked cultural references. Knowing these references allows for a much richer reading of the work. J. Kerry Grant wrote ''A Companion to the Crying of Lot 49'' in an attempt to catalogue these references but it is neither definitive nor complete.<ref name=\"grant\">Grant, J. Kerry.  ''A Companion to The Crying of Lot 49'' (Athens:  University of Georgia Press, 1994).  {{ISBN|0-8203-1635-0}}.</ref>\n\n===The Beatles===\n\n''The Crying of Lot 49'' was published shortly after [[Beatlemania]] and the \"[[British invasion]]\" that took place in the United States and other Western countries. Internal context clues indicate that the novel is set in the summer of 1964, the year in which ''[[A Hard Day's Night (movie)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' was released. Pynchon makes a wide variety of Beatles allusions. Most prominent are The Paranoids, a band composed of cheerful [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] smokers whose lead singer, Miles, is a high-school dropout described as having a \"Beatle haircut.\" The Paranoids all speak with American accents but sing in English ones; at one point, a guitar player is forced to relinquish control of a car to his girlfriend because he cannot see through his hair. It is not clear whether Pynchon was aware of the Beatles' own nickname for themselves, \"Los Para Noias\"; since the novel is replete with other references to paranoia, Pynchon may have chosen the band's name for other reasons.<ref name=\"harrison\">[[George Harrison|Harrison, George MBE]] ''et al.''  ''The Beatles Anthology'' (San Francisco: Chronicle Books, 2000).  {{ISBN|0-8118-2684-8}}.</ref>\n\nPynchon refers to a rock song, \"I Want to Kiss Your Feet\", an adulteration of \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\". The song's artist, Sick Dick and the Volkswagens, evokes the names of such historical rock groups as  [[the El Dorados]], [[the Edsels]], [[the Cadillacs]] and the Jaguars (as well as an early name the Beatles themselves used, \"Long John and the Silver Beetles\"). \"Sick Dick\" may also refer to Richard Wharfinger, author of \"that ill, ill  [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean revenge play]]\" known as ''The Courier's Tragedy''.<ref name=\"grant\"/> The song's title also keeps up a recurring sequence of allusions to [[Narcissus of Jerusalem|Saint Narcissus]], a 3rd-century bishop of [[Jerusalem]].\n\nLate in the novel, Oedipa's husband, Mucho Maas, a disc jockey at Kinneret [[List of fictional radio stations|radio station]] [[Fuck|KCUF]], describes his experience of discovering the Beatles. Mucho refers to their early song \"[[She Loves You]]\", as well as hinting at the areas the Beatles were later to explore.  Pynchon writes,\n\n<blockquote>Whenever I put the headset on now,\" he'd continued, \"I really do understand what I find there. When those kids sing about 'She loves you,' yeah well, you know, she does, she's any number of people, all over the world, back through time, different colors, sizes, ages, shapes, distances from death, but she loves. And the 'you' is everybody. And herself. Oedipa, the human voice, you know, it's a flipping miracle.\" His eyes brimming, reflecting the color of beer. \"Baby,\" she said, helpless, knowing of nothing she could do for this, and afraid for him. He put a little clear plastic bottle on the table between them. She stared at the pills in it, and then understood. \"That's [[LSD]]?\" she said.</blockquote>\n\n===Vladimir Nabokov===<!-- This section is linked from [[Thomas Pynchon]] -->\nPynchon, like [[Kurt Vonnegut]], was a student at [[Cornell University]], where he probably at least audited [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s Literature 312 class. (Nabokov had no recollection of him, but Nabokov's wife V\u00e9ra recalls grading Pynchon's examination papers, thanks only to his handwriting, \"half printing, half script\".)<ref name=\"appel\">Appel, Alfred Jr.  Interview, published in ''Wisconsin Studies in Contemporary Literature'' '''8,''' No. 2 (spring 1967).  Reprinted in ''Strong Opinions'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1973).</ref>  The year before Pynchon graduated, Nabokov's novel ''[[Lolita]]'' was published in the United States. ''Lolita'' introduced the word \"nymphet\" to describe a girl between the ages of nine and fourteen, sexually attractive to the pedophile main character, [[Humbert Humbert]] and it was also used in [[Lolita (1962 film)|the novel's adaptation to cinema in 1962]] by [[Stanley Kubrick]]. In the following years, mainstream usage altered the word's meaning to apply to older girls. Perhaps appropriately, Pynchon provides an early example of the modern \"nymphet\" usage entering the [[wikt:canon|literary canon]]. Serge, The Paranoids' teenage counter-tenor, loses his girlfriend to a middle-aged lawyer. At one point he expresses his  [[angst]] in song:\n\n:What chance has a lonely surfer boy\n:For the love of a surfer chick,\n:With all these Humbert Humbert cats\n:Coming on so big and sick?\n:For me, my baby was a woman,\n:For him she's just another nymphet.\n\n===Remedios Varo===\nNear the beginning of ''The Crying of Lot 49'', Oedipa recalls a trip to an art museum in Mexico with Inverarity, during which she encountered a painting, ''Bordando el Manto Terrestre'' by [[Remedios Varo]]. The painting shows eight women inside a tower, where they are presumably held captive. Six maidens are weaving a tapestry that flows out of the windows. The tapestry seems to constitute the world outside of the tower. Oedipa's reaction to the tapestry gives us some insight into her difficulty in determining what is real and what is a fiction created by Inverarity for her benefit:\n\n<blockquote>She had looked down at her feet and known, then, because of a painting, that what she stood on had only been woven together a couple thousand miles away in her own tower, was only by accident known as Mexico, and so Pierce had taken her away from nothing, there'd been no escape.</blockquote>\n\n===''The Courier's Tragedy''===\nPynchon devotes a significant part of the book to a play-within-a-book, a detailed description of a performance of an imaginary [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] [[revenge play]], involving intrigues between Thurn und Taxis and Trystero. Like \"The Mousetrap\", based on \"The Murder of Gonzago\" that [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] placed within ''[[Hamlet]],'' the events and atmosphere of ''The Courier's Tragedy'' (by the fictional Richard Wharfinger) mirror those transpiring around them. In many aspects it resembles a typical revenge play, such as ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' by [[Thomas Kyd]], ''[[Hamlet]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] and plays by [[John Webster]] and [[Cyril Tourneur]].\n\n==References in popular culture==\n* [[Radiohead]] alludes to the novel in the name of their online merchandise shop and mailing list, W.A.S.T.E.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://observer.com/2017/06/radiohead-o-k-computer-rolling-stone-pitchfork/|title=How Radiohead\u2019s \u2018O.K.

Having completed his [[high-school]] from Sialkot, he completed his matriculation from [[Murray College]], gaining a pre-science diploma from Murray College in 1950. In 1951, he attended [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]], majoring in [[applied physics]] and had received his [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] in [[Applied Physics]] from Punjab University in 1955.<ref>{{cite web|last=(PAS) |first=Pakistan Academy of Sciences |authorlink=Pakistan Academy of Sciences |title=Dr. N.M.

In 1957, he completed his [[Master of Science]] (MSc) with experimental specialisation in nuclear physics under nuclear physicist Professor [[Rafi Muhammad Chaudhry]], the Head of the Department of Physics at the [[Government College University, Lahore|Government College University]] at that time. It was under Chaudhry's supervision that Butt studied [[nuclear physics]] and supervised Butts' master's degree's thesis in experimental nuclear physics using the 1.2&nbsp;[[MeV]] [[Cockcroft\u2013Walton generator|Cockcrof-Walton Nuclear Accelerator]] installed at the College.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =(PSF)\n  | first =Pakistan Science Foundation\n  | authorlink =\n  | author2 =National Commission on Nano Science and Technology (NCNST).\n  | title =Dr. N.M.

He stayed there till 1960. In 1961, he won a [[Commonwealth Scholarship]] and the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission ]]Scholarship to pursue his [[doctoral studies]] in Europe. On his mentors' advice, Butt travelled to the United Kingdom where he attended the [[University of Birmingham]].\n\nDuring his studies, Butt learned the course on the [[Kinetic theory of solids]] from [[Professor|Prof]]. [[Rudolf Peierls]], a leading member and senior scientist who participated in the [[Manhattan Project]] and who was still working as the Head of the implosion device being developed under this project in the early 1940s. Thus, at [[Birmingham University]] during his studies for PhD, Butt had studied and taught nuclear physics under three world known nuclear professors whose names form part of the nuclear history of the world.{{Who|date=May 2011}} Later, Butt had a rich and full interaction with a large number of nuclear and material scientists of over 25 countries during his lectures and seminars at the laboratories of these countries of the East and the West.\n\nIn 1967, he received his [[Doctor of Science]] (D.Sc.) in nuclear physics under the supervision of Dr. [[Philip Burton Moon]]. He joined the \"''Department of Nuclear Physics''\", [[Birmingham University]], where he earned the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (D.Phil.). In 1968, he became a [[distinguished professor]] of nuclear physics at the University of Birmingham where he had continued his research in [[fission products]]. In 1970, Dr. [[Abdus Salam]] had met with Butt where Salam had advised him to carry out his research at ICTP in [[Trieste]], Italy. Butt followed Salam's advice and joined ICTP as a ''\"Senior Associate\"'' (SA). During his stay at ICTP, he began his studies and research in the field of [[Solid-state physics]] which led him to win the \"''[[International Centre for Theoretical Physics|Associate ICTP Award]] in Solid-State Physics''\". In 1979, Butt was also conferred with an \"''ICTP Award in Nuclear Physics''\" in the honour of Dr. Abdus Salam.\n\n==Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission==\n\nButt joined the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]](PAEC) in 1961 as a \"''Principle Scientific Officer''\" (PSO). While in Europe in 1974, Butt had learned that India had secretly [[Pokhran-I|tested its]] miniature nuclear device in the [[Thar Desert]]. He at first, had approached [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistani government]] representatives offering to help with their [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons research programme]], however, he did not receive any particular response from the government officials. In January 1975, Abdus Salam personally asked Butt to report to PAEC chairman [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] who was heading Pakistan's nuclear weapon program. He along with Dr. [[Riazuddin (physicist)|Riazuddin]] and Dr. [[Masud Ahmad]] came back to Pakistan where he attended a meeting with Abdus Salam in PAEC Headquarters. As the work on nuclear weapon design was initiated, Butt was given a transfer to the [[Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology]](PINSTECH) where, with the support of Abdus Salam, he was appointed as a [[director-general]] of the Nuclear Physics Division (NPD). Butt worked closely with Dr. Naeem Ahmad Khan in the development of the fissionable device throughout the 1970s.  He was the first technical director at the \"''[[Pakistan Research Reactor#The New Labs|New Labs]]''\" where he was the head of the team of scientists discovering the fissionable [[Isotopes of plutonium|isotopes]] of <sup>93</sup>Pu([[Plutonium]]). At New Labs, Butt began his research in the [[M\u00f6ssbauer effect]] and [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy|spectroscopy]] where, using the M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy and M\u00f6ssbauer effect applications, Butt's team had solved nuclear emission problems, and had discovered an effective technique to deal with [[Gamma ray]] [[Nuclear radiation|radiation]] in a nuclear device effecting [[Environmental isotopes|environmental isotope]]s around the nuclear test site.\n\nIn 1983, Butt was a part of teams of scientists that witnessed at first hand the [[Cold fission|cold test]] of a [[nuclear device]] near the [[Kirana Hills]]. In 1984, he was promoted and became an \"Associate Director (AD)\" of [[PINSTECH]], and was responsible for the research undertaken in the institute. In 1991, as Dr. [[Ishfaq Ahmad]] became a chairman of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, Butt was appointed and became director (or Deputy Director-General) of the PINSTECH institute, with the full support of Ishfaq Ahmad. In 1995, Butt was elected and became a President of Pakistan Nuclear Society (PNS). In 1996, Ishfaq Ahmad had promoted him as [[Director-general]] of the institute. The same year, when the Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence]](ISI) learnt that India was soon going to test its device, the Government of Pakistan ordered him to place and prepare the devices to be tested in the nuclear test sites. However, the decision was taken back as India had postponed its nuclear device tests.\n\nButt was part of a team of scientists that visited [[European Organization for Nuclear Research]] (CERN) along with -[[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]] Chairman [[Ishfaq Ahmad]] in 1997, where he had led the experiments by Pakistani physicists. It was by his efforts that in 1997 the Atomic Energy Agency reached an agreement with CERN to contribute to the construction of eight magnet supports for the [[Compact Muon Solenoid]](CMS) detector, worth one million [[Swiss francs]]. PAEC was a financer of the CMS detector as well as providing its scientists and engineers to lead the construction of the detector. From 1970-1990s, Butt had closely worked with Ishfaq Ahmad in the field of nuclear physics where they produced numerous physics articles. He also helped established the first science journal in PINSTECH. His research repeatedly published in \"''The Nucleus (Journal)''\" published by the PINSTECH.\n\nIn 1998, he was promoted as a \"Chief Scientist (CS)\" at PINSTECH. In May 1998, when India [[Pokhran-II|tested]] its fission devices in [[Pokhran]], the Pakistani government gave the scientists a green signal to test the nuclear weapon. On 28 May 1998, Butt was one of the scientists that witnessed at first hand the successful [[Chagai-I|Chagai-I tests]] of six nuclear devices in [[Ras Koh Hills]].\n\nAs a Chief Scientist (CS) at PAEC, Butt took retirement from the PAEC in late 1998. In 2000, the PAEC had made him \"''Scientist of Emeritus''\" (SE) in PINSTECH Institute to which he is still attached. The same year, he was elected President of Pakistan Physical Society. In October 2003, he was appointed as National Commission on Nano-Science and Technology (NCNST). In 2005 he was appointed Chairman of the Pakistan Science Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|last=IAS |first=Islamic Academy of Sciences |title=Profile:Dr. Noor Muhammad Butt |url=http://www.ias-worldwide.org/profiles/prof15.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120003131/http://www.ias-worldwide.org/profiles/prof15.htm |archivedate=20 November 2008 }}\n</ref>\nButt is an elected fellow of the [[Pakistan Academy of Sciences]] and Islamic Academy of Sciences to which he was last elected in 1993.

Having completed his [[high-school]] from Sialkot, he completed his matriculation from [[Murray College]], gaining a pre-science diploma from Murray College in 1950. In 1951, he attended [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]], majoring in [[applied physics]] and had received his [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] in [[Applied Physics]] from Punjab University in 1955.<ref>{{cite web|last=(PAS) |first=Pakistan Academy of Sciences |authorlink=Pakistan Academy of Sciences |title=Dr. N.M.

In 1957, he completed his [[Master of Science]] (MSc) with experimental specialisation in nuclear physics under nuclear physicist Professor [[Rafi Muhammad Chaudhry]], the Head of the Department of Physics at the [[Government College University, Lahore|Government College University]] at that time. It was under Chaudhry's supervision that Butt studied [[nuclear physics]] and supervised Butts' master's degree's thesis in experimental nuclear physics using the 1.2&nbsp;[[MeV]] [[Cockcroft\u2013Walton generator|Cockcrof-Walton Nuclear Accelerator]] installed at the College.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =(PSF)\n  | first =Pakistan Science Foundation\n  | authorlink =\n  | author2 =National Commission on Nano Science and Technology (NCNST).\n  | title =Dr. N.M.

He stayed there till 1960. In 1961, he won a [[Commonwealth Scholarship]] and the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission ]]Scholarship to pursue his [[doctoral studies]] in Europe. On his mentors' advice, Butt travelled to the United Kingdom where he attended the [[University of Birmingham]].\n\nDuring his studies, Butt learned the course on the [[Kinetic theory of solids]] from [[Professor|Prof]]. [[Rudolf Peierls]], a leading member and senior scientist who participated in the [[Manhattan Project]] and who was still working as the Head of the implosion device being developed under this project in the early 1940s. Thus, at [[Birmingham University]] during his studies for PhD, Butt had studied and taught nuclear physics under three world known nuclear professors whose names form part of the nuclear history of the world.{{Who|date=May 2011}} Later, Butt had a rich and full interaction with a large number of nuclear and material scientists of over 25 countries during his lectures and seminars at the laboratories of these countries of the East and the West.\n\nIn 1967, he received his [[Doctor of Science]] (D.Sc.) in nuclear physics under the supervision of Dr. [[Philip Burton Moon]]. He joined the \"''Department of Nuclear Physics''\", [[Birmingham University]], where he earned the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (D.Phil.). In 1968, he became a [[distinguished professor]] of nuclear physics at the University of Birmingham where he had continued his research in [[fission products]]. In 1970, Dr. [[Abdus Salam]] had met with Butt where Salam had advised him to carry out his research at ICTP in [[Trieste]], Italy. Butt followed Salam's advice and joined ICTP as a ''\"Senior Associate\"'' (SA). During his stay at ICTP, he began his studies and research in the field of [[Solid-state physics]] which led him to win the \"''[[International Centre for Theoretical Physics|Associate ICTP Award]] in Solid-State Physics''\". In 1979, Butt was also conferred with an \"''ICTP Award in Nuclear Physics''\" in the honour of Dr. Abdus Salam.\n\n==Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission==\n\nButt joined the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]](PAEC) in 1961 as a \"''Principle Scientific Officer''\" (PSO). While in Europe in 1974, Butt had learned that India had secretly [[Pokhran-I|tested its]] miniature nuclear device in the [[Thar Desert]]. He at first, had approached [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistani government]] representatives offering to help with their [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons research programme]], however, he did not receive any particular response from the government officials. In January 1975, Abdus Salam personally asked Butt to report to PAEC chairman [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] who was heading Pakistan's nuclear weapon program. He along with Dr. [[Riazuddin (physicist)|Riazuddin]] and Dr. [[Masud Ahmad]] came back to Pakistan where he attended a meeting with Abdus Salam in PAEC Headquarters. As the work on nuclear weapon design was initiated, Butt was given a transfer to the [[Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology]](PINSTECH) where, with the support of Abdus Salam, he was appointed as a [[director-general]] of the Nuclear Physics Division (NPD). Butt worked closely with Dr. Naeem Ahmad Khan in the development of the fissionable device throughout the 1970s.  He was the first technical director at the \"''[[Pakistan Research Reactor#The New Labs|New Labs]]''\" where he was the head of the team of scientists discovering the fissionable [[Isotopes of plutonium|isotopes]] of <sup>93</sup>Pu([[Plutonium]]). At New Labs, Butt began his research in the [[M\u00f6ssbauer effect]] and [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy|spectroscopy]] where, using the M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy and M\u00f6ssbauer effect applications, Butt's team had solved nuclear emission problems, and had discovered an effective technique to deal with [[Gamma ray]] [[Nuclear radiation|radiation]] in a nuclear device effecting [[Environmental isotopes|environmental isotope]]s around the nuclear test site.\n\nIn 1983, Butt was a part of teams of scientists that witnessed at first hand the [[Cold fission|cold test]] of a [[nuclear device]] near the [[Kirana Hills]]. In 1984, he was promoted and became an \"Associate Director (AD)\" of [[PINSTECH]], and was responsible for the research undertaken in the institute. In 1991, as Dr. [[Ishfaq Ahmad]] became a chairman of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, Butt was appointed and became director (or Deputy Director-General) of the PINSTECH institute, with the full support of Ishfaq Ahmad. In 1995, Butt was elected and became a President of Pakistan Nuclear Society (PNS). In 1996, Ishfaq Ahmad had promoted him as [[Director-general]] of the institute. The same year, when the Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence]](ISI) learnt that India was soon going to test its device, the Government of Pakistan ordered him to place and prepare the devices to be tested in the nuclear test sites. However, the decision was taken back as India had postponed its nuclear device tests.\n\nButt was part of a team of scientists that visited [[European Organization for Nuclear Research]] (CERN) along with -[[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]] Chairman [[Ishfaq Ahmad]] in 1997, where he had led the experiments by Pakistani physicists. It was by his efforts that in 1997 the Atomic Energy Agency reached an agreement with CERN to contribute to the construction of eight magnet supports for the [[Compact Muon Solenoid]](CMS) detector, worth one million [[Swiss francs]]. PAEC was a financer of the CMS detector as well as providing its scientists and engineers to lead the construction of the detector. From 1970-1990s, Butt had closely worked with Ishfaq Ahmad in the field of nuclear physics where they produced numerous physics articles. He also helped established the first science journal in PINSTECH. His research repeatedly published in \"''The Nucleus (Journal)''\" published by the PINSTECH.\n\nIn 1998, he was promoted as a \"Chief Scientist (CS)\" at PINSTECH. In May 1998, when India [[Pokhran-II|tested]] its fission devices in [[Pokhran]], the Pakistani government gave the scientists a green signal to test the nuclear weapon. On 28 May 1998, Butt was among one of the scientists that witnessed at first hand the successful [[Chagai-I|Chagai-I tests]] of six nuclear devices in [[Ras Koh Hills]].\n\nAs a Chief Scientist (CS) at PAEC, Butt took retirement from the PAEC in late 1998. In 2000, the PAEC had made him \"''Scientist of Emeritus''\" (SE) in PINSTECH Institute to which he is still attached. The same year, he was elected President of Pakistan Physical Society. In October 2003, he was appointed as National Commission on Nano-Science and Technology (NCNST). In 2005 he was appointed Chairman of the Pakistan Science Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|last=IAS |first=Islamic Academy of Sciences |title=Profile:Dr. Noor Muhammad Butt |url=http://www.ias-worldwide.org/profiles/prof15.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120003131/http://www.ias-worldwide.org/profiles/prof15.htm |archivedate=20 November 2008 }}\n</ref>\nButt is an elected fellow of the [[Pakistan Academy of Sciences]] and Islamic Academy of Sciences to which he was last elected in 1993.
