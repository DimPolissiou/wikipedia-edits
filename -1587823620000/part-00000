He lived on 12th Street and 4th Avenue and went to Manual Training High School in the [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]] section. His parents divorced while he was a child. To help keep him out of trouble, his father bought him a large [[Trans-Oceanic]] radio, and Smith became an avid fan of R&B music and the disc jockeys who played it, including [[\"Jocko\" Henderson]] of Philadelphia, New York's \"Dr. Jive\" ([[Tommy Smalls]]), the \"Moon Dog\" from Cleveland, [[Alan Freed]], and Nashville's \"[[John R.]]\" Richbourg, who later became his mentor. After selling [[encyclopedia]]s and [[Fuller Brush Company|Fuller brushes]] door-to-door, Smith attended the National Academy of Broadcasting in [[Washington, D.C.]] After he graduated in 1960, he began working as \"Daddy Jules\" at [[WTJZ|WYOU]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]]. When the station format changed to \"beautiful music\", Smith became known as \"Roger Gordon and Music in Good Taste\". In 1962, he moved to country music station KCIJ/1050 in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], as the station manager and morning disc jockey, \"Big Smith with the Records\". He married Lucy \"Lou\" Lamb in 1961, and they had two children.<ref>John A. Drobnicki, \"Wolfman Jack (Robert Weston Smith)\", in ''The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives'', Vol. 4 (Scribner's, 2001), p. 581.</ref>\n\nDisc jockey [[Alan Freed]] had played a role in the transformation of black [[rhythm and blues]] into [[rock and roll]] music, and originally called himself the \"Moon Dog\" after [[New York City]] [[Busking|street musician]] [[Moondog]]. Freed both adopted this name and used a recorded howl to give his early broadcasts a unique character. Smith's adaptation of the Moondog theme was to call himself Wolfman Jack and add his own sound effects. The character was based in part on the manner and style of [[blues]]man [[Howlin' Wolf]]. It was at KCIJ in Shreveport, Louisiana that he first began to develop his famous alter ego Wolfman Jack. According to author Philip A. Lieberman, Smith's \"Wolfman\" persona \"derived from Smith's love of horror films and his shenanigans as a 'wolfman' with his two young nephews. The 'Jack' was added as a part of the 'hipster' lingo of the 1950s, as in 'Take a page from my book, Jack,' or the more popular, 'Hit the road, Jack.'\"<ref>Philip A. Lieberman, ''Radio's Morning Show Personalities: Early Hour Broadcasters and Deejays from the 1920s to the 1990s'' (McFarland & Company, 1996), p. 58.</ref>\n\nIn 1963, Smith took his act to the border when the Inter-American Radio Advertising's Ramon Bosquez hired him and sent him to the studio and transmitter site of [[XERF-AM]] at [[Ciudad Acu\u00f1a]] in Mexico, a station whose high-powered [[border blaster]] signal could be picked up across much of the United States. In an interview with writer [[Tom Miller (travel writer)|Tom Miller]], Smith described the reach of the XERF signal: \"We had the most powerful signal in North America. Birds dropped dead when they flew too close to the tower. A car driving from New York to L.A. would never lose the station.\"<ref>[[Tom Miller (travel writer)|Tom Miller]]. ''On the Border: Portraits of America\u2019s Southwestern Frontier'', pp. 84\u201385.</ref> Most of the border stations broadcast at 250,000 watts, five times the U.S. limit, meaning that their signals were picked up all over North America, and at night as far away as Europe and the Soviet Union. It was at XERF that Smith developed his signature style (with phrases like \"Who's this on the Wolfman telephone?\") and widespread fame. The border stations made money by renting time to Pentecostal preachers and psychics, and by taking 50 percent of the profit from anything sold by mail order. The Wolfman did pitches for dog food, weight-loss pills, weight-gain pills, rose bushes, and baby chicks. There was even a pill called Florex, which was supposed to enhance one's sex drive. \"Some zing for your [[Water caltrop|ling nuts]],\" the Wolfman would say.<ref>Wes Smith, ''The Pied Pipers of Rock 'n' Roll'' (Longstreet Press, 1989), p. 272.</ref>\n\nThat sales pitch was typical of Wolfman Jack's growling, exuberant on-air style.  In the spirit of his character name, he would punctuate his banter with howls, while urging his listeners to \"get naked\" or \"lay your hands on the radio and squeeze my knobs\".  Part of the persona was his nocturnal anonymity; listeners from coast to coast had no idea how to recognize the face behind the voice that said things like \"Wolfman plays the best records in the business, and then he eats 'em!\"\n\n[[XEPRS-AM|XERB]] was the original call sign for the [[border blaster]] station in [[Rosarito Beach]], Mexico, which was branded as The Mighty 1090 in [[Hollywood]], [[California]]. The station boasted \"50,000 watts of Boss Soul Power\". That station continues to broadcast today with the call sign XEPRS-AM. XERB also had an office in the rear of a small [[strip mall]] on Third Avenue in [[Chula Vista]], [[California]]. It was not unlike the small broadcast studio depicted in the film ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (which was filmed at [[KVTO|KRE]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]). It was located only ten minutes from the [[Tijuana]]\u2013[[San Diego]] border crossing. It was rumored that the Wolfman actually broadcast from this location during the early-to-mid-1960s. Smith left Mexico after eight months and moved to [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], to run station KUXL. Even though Smith was managing a Minneapolis radio station, he was still broadcasting as Wolfman Jack on XERF via taped shows that he sent to the station.  Missing the excitement, however, he returned to border radio to run XERB, and opened an office on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in the [[Los Angeles]] area in January 1966. The Wolfman recorded his shows in Los Angeles and shipped his tapes across the border into Mexico, where they would then be beamed across the U.S.<ref>Gene Fowler and Bill Crawford, ''Border Radio'' (Limelight Editions, 1990).</ref> It was during his time broadcasting on XERB that Smith met Don Kelley, who became his personal manager and business partner for more than 20 years. It was Kelley who saw the potential for Wolfman Jack to become more than a radio personality. Kelley started to work on a strategy to transform Smith from a cult figure to a mainstream entertainer in film, recordings, and television. He promoted Smith to the major media and formed enduring relationships with key journalists.\n\nIn 1971, the Mexican government decided that its overwhelmingly Roman Catholic citizens should not be subjected to proselytizing and banned the Pentecostal preachers from the radio, taking away 80 percent of XERB's revenue. Smith then moved to station [[KBLA|KDAY]] 1580 in Los Angeles, which could only pay him a fraction of his former XERB income. However, Smith capitalized on his fame by editing his old XERB tapes and selling them to radio stations everywhere, becoming one of the first rock and roll [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programs (as the tapes began to age, they were eventually also marketed to [[oldies]] stations). He also appeared on [[Armed Forces Radio]] from 1970 to 1986. At his peak, Wolfman Jack was heard on more than 2,000 radio stations in 53 countries.<ref>John A. Drobnicki, \"Wolfman Jack (Robert Weston Smith)\". in ''The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives'', Vol. 4 (Scribner's, 2001), p. 582.</ref> He was heard as far off as the Wild Coast, [[Transkei]], on a station based there, Capital Radio 604.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wildcoastradio.com/?p=647 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716045022/http://wildcoastradio.com/?p=647|url-status=dead|title=Wolfman Jack in Africa, 1980. - BORDERBLASTING IN A BANTUSTAN|date=July 16, 2012|archivedate=July 16, 2012 |accessdate=September 11, 2017}}</ref>  In a deal promoted by Don Kelley, The Wolfman was paid handsomely to join [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] in New York in August 1973, the same month that ''American Graffiti'' premiered, and the station did a huge advertising campaign in local newspapers stating that the Wolfman would propel their ratings over those of their main competitor, [[WABC (AM)|WABC]], which had \"[[Cousin Brucie]]\" (Bruce Morrow). The ads proclaimed, \"Cousin Brucie's Days Are Numbered\", and thousands of small tombstone-shaped paperweights were distributed that said, \"Cousin Brucie is going to be buried by Wolfman Jack.\"<ref>Ben Fong-Torres, ''The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio'' (Miller Freeman Books, 1998), p. 142.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/30244852/Wolfman_Hits_the_Road_Jack |author=[[Paul Levinson]] |title=Wolfman Hits the Road, Jack |work=The Village Voice |date=July 4, 1976 |page=34}}</ref> After less than a year, WNBC hired Cousin Brucie, and Wolfman Jack went back to California to concentrate on his syndicated radio show, which was carried on KRLA-Pasadena (Los Angeles) from 1984-1987. He moved to Belvidere, North Carolina, in 1989, to be closer to his extended family.<ref>James F. Mills, \"Wolfman Turns into Country Gentleman: N.C. Mansion Home to Rock 'n' Roll DJ\", ''Charlotte Observer'' (February 27, 1994), p. 8B.</ref>  In the 80s, he did a brief stint at XEROK 80, another border blaster station that was leased by Dallas investors Robert Hanna, Grady Sanders, and John Ryman. Ryman then moved Smith to Scott Ginsburg-owned Y95 in Dallas, Texas.\n\nRecordings of Wolfman Jack's old shows were reintroduced to syndication a decade after his death and remain available to local stations, currently through Envision Networks as of 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.envisionnetworks.com/show/the-wolfman-jack-radio-show/|title=The Wolfman Jack Radio Show|work=Envision Networks|access-date=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Film, television, and music career==\nIn the early days, Wolfman Jack made sporadic public appearances, usually as a Master of Ceremonies for rock bands at Los Angeles clubs. At each appearance, he looked a little different because he had not decided what the Wolfman should look like. Early pictures show him with a goatee; however, sometimes he combed his straight hair forward and added dark makeup to look somewhat \"ethnic\". Other times he had a big [[afro]] wig and large sunglasses. The ambiguity of his race contributed to the controversy of his program. His audience finally got a good look at him when he appeared in the 1969 film ''A Session with the Committee'', a montage of skits by the comedy troupe [[The Committee (improv group)|The Committee]].\n\nWolfman Jack started his recording career in Minneapolis, Minnesota, while working at KUXL Radio in 1965 with George Garrett. Garrett helped record the album ''Boogie With The Wolfman'' by Wolfman Jack & the Wolfpack on the Bread Label. He was also responsible for engineering, producing, and assembling the band.<ref>Minnesota Rocked, Tom Tourville, 2nd Edition, 1983, LOCCC# 82-074566</ref> Wolfman Jack also released ''Wolfman Jack'' (1972) and ''Through the Ages'' (1973) on the [[Wooden Nickel Records|Wooden Nickel]] label.<ref>{{cite web| last = Callahan| first = Mike| last2 = Edwards| first2 = David| last3 = Eyries| first3 = Patrice| title = Wooden Nickel Album Discography| date = October 26, 2005| url = http://www.bsnpubs.com/rca/woodennickel.html| accessdate = October 3, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100113140243/http://bsnpubs.com/rca/woodennickel.html| archive-date = January 13, 2010| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, he appeared as himself in [[George Lucas]]'s second feature film ''[[American Graffiti]]''. Lucas gave him a fraction of a \"point\", the division of the profits from a film, and the extreme financial success of ''American Graffiti'' provided him with a regular income for life. He also appeared in the film's 1979 sequel ''[[More American Graffiti]]'', though only through voice-overs. In 1978, he appeared as Bob \"The Jackal\" Smith in a made-for-TV movie ''[[Deadman's Curve]]'' based on the musical careers of Jan Berry and Dean Torrence of [[Jan and Dean]]. Smith appeared in several television shows as Wolfman Jack, including ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]'', ''[[What's Happening!!]]'', ''[[Vega$]]'', ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'', ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[Married... with Children]]'', ''[[Emergency!]]'' S5Ep5, and ''[[Galactica 1980]]''. He was the regular announcer and occasional host for ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' on [[NBC]] from 1973 to 1981. He was also the host of his variety series ''[[The Wolfman Jack Show]]'', which was produced in Canada by CBC Television in 1976 and syndicated to stations in the US.\n\n[[Jim Morrison]]'s lyrics for \"The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat)\" were influenced by Wolfman Jack's broadcasting.  He is also mentioned in the [[Grateful Dead]] song \"Ramble On Rose\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artsites.ucsc.edu/GDead/agdl/ramble2.html |title=The Annotated \"Ramble On Rose\" |publisher=Artsites.ucsc.edu |date= |accessdate=August 18, 2014}}</ref> He furnished his voice in [[The Guess Who]]'s the top 40 hit single \"[[Clap for the Wolfman]]\". Wolfman Jack was regularly parodied on ''[[The Hilarious House of Frightenstein]]'' as \"The Wolfman,\" an actual werewolf disc jockey with a look inspired by the original ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' movies. A few years earlier, [[Todd Rundgren]] recorded the tribute \"Wolfman Jack\" on the album ''[[Something/Anything?]]''; the single version of the track includes a shouted talk-over intro by the Wolfman but on the album version Rundgren performs that part himself. Canadian band [[The Stampeders]] also released a cover of \"[[Hit the Road Jack]]\" in 1975 featuring Wolfman Jack. From 1975 to 1980, Wolfman Jack hosted Halloween Haunt at [[Knott's Berry Farm]], which transforms itself into [[Knott's Scary Farm]] each year for Halloween. It was the most successful special event of any theme park in the country, and often sold out.<ref>Merritt, Christopher, and Lynxwiler, J. Eric.

Because of the laws passed in the UK in 1967, it became necessary for the sales operation to be situated in the US. For a time, Don Kelley, Wolfman Jack's business partner and personal manager, acted as the West Coast agent for the planned new [[Radio Caroline]], but the deal eventually fell apart.\n\nAs a part of this process, Wolfman Jack was set to deliver the morning shows on the new station. To that end, Wolfman Jack recorded a number of programs that never aired, because the station didn't come on air according to schedule. (It eventually returned from a new ship in 1983 which remained at sea until 1990.) Today those tapes are traded among collectors of his work.\n\n==Death==\nOn July 1, 1995, Smith died from a heart attack at his house in [[Belvidere, North Carolina]], shortly after finishing a weekly broadcast.<ref name=\"MRM\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wolfmanjack.org/wolfhistory.htm |title=A short synapses about Wolfman Jack, his accomplishments, and his life |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727105619/http://www.wolfmanjack.org/wolfhistory.htm |archive-date=July 27, 2013 }}</ref> He is buried at a family cemetery in Belvidere.<ref>{{cite web |title=KIN PLAN PARK, MUSEUM IN HONOR OF WOLFMAN JACK|website=Deseret News |url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/450232/KIN-PLAN-PARK-MUSEUM-IN-HONOR-OF-WOLFMAN-JACK.html |date=November 12, 1995 |access-date=December 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Part of the persona was his nocturnal anonymity; listeners from coast to coast had no idea how to recognize the face behind the voice that said things like \"Wolfman plays the best records in the business, and then he eats 'em!\"\n\n[[XEPRS-AM|XERB]] was the original call sign for the [[border blaster]] station in [[Rosarito Beach]], Mexico, which was branded as The Mighty 1090 in [[Hollywood]], [[California]]. The station boasted \"50,000 watts of Boss Soul Power\". That station continues to broadcast today with the call sign XEPRS-AM. XERB also had an office in the rear of a small [[strip mall]] on Third Avenue in [[Chula Vista]], [[California]]. It was not unlike the small broadcast studio depicted in the film ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (which was filmed at [[KVTO|KRE]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]). It was located only ten minutes from the [[Tijuana]]\u2013[[San Diego]] border crossing. It was rumored that the Wolfman actually broadcast from this location during the early-to-mid-1960s. Smith left Mexico after eight months and moved to [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], to run station KUXL. Even though Smith was managing a Minneapolis radio station, he was still broadcasting as Wolfman Jack on XERF via taped shows that he sent to the station.  Missing the excitement, however, he returned to border radio to run XERB, and opened an office on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in the [[Los Angeles]] area in January 1966. The Wolfman recorded his shows in Los Angeles and shipped his tapes across the border into Mexico, where they would then be beamed across the U.S.<ref>Gene Fowler and Bill Crawford, ''Border Radio'' (Limelight Editions, 1990).</ref> It was during his time broadcasting on XERB that Smith met Don Kelley, who became his personal manager and business partner for more than 20 years. It was Kelley who saw the potential for Wolfman Jack to become more than a radio personality. Kelley started to work on a strategy to transform Smith from a cult figure to a mainstream entertainer in film, recordings, and television. He promoted Smith to the major media and formed enduring relationships with key journalists.\n\nIn 1971, the Mexican government decided that its overwhelmingly Roman Catholic citizens should not be subjected to proselytizing and banned the Pentecostal preachers from the radio, taking away 80 percent of XERB's revenue. Smith then moved to station [[KBLA|KDAY]] 1580 in Los Angeles, which could only pay him a fraction of his former XERB income. However, Smith capitalized on his fame by editing his old XERB tapes and selling them to radio stations everywhere, becoming one of the first rock and roll [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programs (as the tapes began to age, they were eventually also marketed to [[oldies]] stations). He also appeared on [[Armed Forces Radio]] from 1970 to 1986. At his peak, Wolfman Jack was heard on more than 2,000 radio stations in 53 countries.<ref>John A. Drobnicki, \"Wolfman Jack (Robert Weston Smith)\". in ''The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives'', Vol. 4 (Scribner's, 2001), p. 582.</ref> He was heard as far off as the Wild Coast, [[Transkei]], on a station based there, Capital Radio 604.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wildcoastradio.com/?p=647 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716045022/http://wildcoastradio.com/?p=647|url-status=dead|title=Wolfman Jack in Africa, 1980. - BORDERBLASTING IN A BANTUSTAN|date=July 16, 2012|archivedate=July 16, 2012 |accessdate=September 11, 2017}}</ref>  In a deal promoted by Don Kelley, The Wolfman was paid handsomely to join [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] in New York in August 1973, the same month that ''American Graffiti'' premiered, and the station did a huge advertising campaign in local newspapers stating that the Wolfman would propel their ratings over those of their main competitor, [[WABC (AM)|WABC]], which had \"[[Cousin Brucie]]\" (Bruce Morrow). The ads proclaimed, \"Cousin Brucie's Days Are Numbered\", and thousands of small tombstone-shaped paperweights were distributed that said, \"Cousin Brucie is going to be buried by Wolfman Jack.\"<ref>Ben Fong-Torres, ''The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio'' (Miller Freeman Books, 1998), p. 142.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/30244852/Wolfman_Hits_the_Road_Jack |author=[[Paul Levinson]] |title=Wolfman Hits the Road, Jack |work=The Village Voice |date=July 4, 1976 |page=34}}</ref> After less than a year, WNBC hired Cousin Brucie, and Wolfman Jack went back to California to concentrate on his syndicated radio show, which was carried on KRLA-Pasadena (Los Angeles) from 1984-1987. He moved to Belvidere, North Carolina, in 1989, to be closer to his extended family.<ref>James F. Mills, \"Wolfman Turns into Country Gentleman: N.C. Mansion Home to Rock 'n' Roll DJ\", ''Charlotte Observer'' (February 27, 1994), p. 8B.</ref>  In the 80s, he did a brief stint at XEROK 80, another border blaster station that was leased by Dallas investors Robert Hanna, Grady Sanders, and John Ryman. Ryman then moved Smith to Scott Ginsburg-owned Y95 in Dallas, Texas.\n\nRecordings of Wolfman Jack's old shows were reintroduced to syndication a decade after his death and remain available to local stations, currently through Envision Networks as of 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.envisionnetworks.com/show/the-wolfman-jack-radio-show/|title=The Wolfman Jack Radio Show|work=Envision Networks|access-date=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Film, television, and music career==\nIn the early days, Wolfman Jack made sporadic public appearances, usually as a Master of Ceremonies for rock bands at Los Angeles clubs. At each appearance, he looked a little different because he had not decided what the Wolfman should look like. Early pictures show him with a goatee; however, sometimes he combed his straight hair forward and added dark makeup to look somewhat \"ethnic\". Other times he had a big [[afro]] wig and large sunglasses. The ambiguity of his race contributed to the controversy of his program. His audience finally got a good look at him when he appeared in the 1969 film ''A Session with the Committee'', a montage of skits by the comedy troupe [[The Committee (improv group)|The Committee]].\n\nWolfman Jack started his recording career in Minneapolis, Minnesota, while working at KUXL Radio in 1965 with George Garrett. Garrett helped record the album ''Boogie With The Wolfman'' by Wolfman Jack & the Wolfpack on the Bread Label. He was also responsible for engineering, producing, and assembling the band.<ref>Minnesota Rocked, Tom Tourville, 2nd Edition, 1983, LOCCC# 82-074566</ref> Wolfman Jack also released ''Wolfman Jack'' (1972) and ''Through the Ages'' (1973) on the [[Wooden Nickel Records|Wooden Nickel]] label.<ref>{{cite web| last = Callahan| first = Mike| last2 = Edwards| first2 = David| last3 = Eyries| first3 = Patrice| title = Wooden Nickel Album Discography| date = October 26, 2005| url = http://www.bsnpubs.com/rca/woodennickel.html| accessdate = October 3, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100113140243/http://bsnpubs.com/rca/woodennickel.html| archive-date = January 13, 2010| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, he appeared as himself in [[George Lucas]]'s second feature film ''[[American Graffiti]]''. Lucas gave him a fraction of a \"point\", the division of the profits from a film, and the extreme financial success of ''American Graffiti'' provided him with a regular income for life. He also appeared in the film's 1979 sequel ''[[More American Graffiti]]'', though only through voice-overs. In 1978, he appeared as Bob \"The Jackal\" Smith in a made-for-TV movie ''[[Deadman's Curve]]'' based on the musical careers of Jan Berry and Dean Torrence of [[Jan and Dean]]. Smith appeared in several television shows as Wolfman Jack, including ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]'', ''[[What's Happening!!]]'', ''[[Vega$]]'', ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'', ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[Married... with Children]]'', ''[[Emergency!]]'' S5Ep5, and ''[[Galactica 1980]]''. He was the regular announcer and occasional host for ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' on [[NBC]] from 1973 to 1981. He was also the host of his variety series ''[[The Wolfman Jack Show]]'', which was produced in Canada by CBC Television in 1976 and syndicated to stations in the US.\n\n[[Jim Morrison]]'s lyrics for \"The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat)\" were influenced by Wolfman Jack's broadcasting.  He is also mentioned in the [[Grateful Dead]] song \"Ramble On Rose\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artsites.ucsc.edu/GDead/agdl/ramble2.html |title=The Annotated \"Ramble On Rose\" |publisher=Artsites.ucsc.edu |date= |accessdate=August 18, 2014}}</ref> He furnished his voice in [[The Guess Who]]'s the top 40 hit single \"[[Clap for the Wolfman]]\". Wolfman Jack was regularly parodied on ''[[The Hilarious House of Frightenstein]]'' as \"The Wolfman,\" an actual werewolf disc jockey with a look inspired by the original ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' movies. A few years earlier, [[Todd Rundgren]] recorded the tribute \"Wolfman Jack\" on the album ''[[Something/Anything?]]''; the single version of the track includes a shouted talk-over intro by the Wolfman but on the album version Rundgren performs that part himself. Canadian band [[The Stampeders]] also released a cover of \"[[Hit the Road Jack]]\" in 1975 featuring Wolfman Jack. From 1975 to 1980, Wolfman Jack hosted Halloween Haunt at [[Knott's Berry Farm]], which transforms itself into [[Knott's Scary Farm]] each year for Halloween. It was the most successful special event of any theme park in the country, and often sold out.<ref>Merritt, Christopher, and Lynxwiler, J. Eric.

Because of the laws passed in the UK in 1967, it became necessary for the sales operation to be situated in the US. For a time, Don Kelley, Wolfman Jack's business partner and personal manager, acted as the West Coast agent for the planned new [[Radio Caroline]], but the deal eventually fell apart.\n\nAs a part of this process, Wolfman Jack was set to deliver the morning shows on the new station. To that end, Wolfman Jack recorded a number of programs that never aired, because the station didn't come on air according to schedule. (It eventually returned from a new ship in 1983 which remained at sea until 1990.) Today those tapes are traded among collectors of his work.\n\n==Death==\nOn July 1, 1995, Smith died from a heart attack at his house in [[Belvidere, North Carolina]], shortly after finishing a weekly broadcast.<ref name=\"MRM\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wolfmanjack.org/wolfhistory.htm |title=A short synapses about Wolfman Jack, his accomplishments, and his life |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727105619/http://www.wolfmanjack.org/wolfhistory.htm |archive-date=July 27, 2013 }}</ref> He is buried at a family cemetery in Belvidere.<ref>{{cite web |title=KIN PLAN PARK, MUSEUM IN HONOR OF WOLFMAN JACK|website=Deseret News |url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/450232/KIN-PLAN-PARK-MUSEUM-IN-HONOR-OF-WOLFMAN-JACK.html |date=November 12, 1995 |access-date=December 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In jazz chords and theory, most [[triad (music)|triad]]s that appear in [[lead sheet]]s or [[fake book]]s can have [[Seventh (chord)|sevenths]] added to them, using the performer's discretion and ear. For example, if a tune is in the key of C, if there is a G chord, the chord-playing performer usually [[Chord voicing|voices]] this chord as G<sup>7</sup>. While the notes of a G<sup>7</sup> chord are G\u2013B\u2013D\u2013F, jazz often omits the [[Fifth (chord)|fifth]] of the chord\u2014and even the [[Root (chord)|root]] if playing in a group. However, not all jazz pianists leave out the root when they play voicings: [[Bud Powell]], one of the best-known of the bebop pianists, and [[Horace Silver]], whose quintet included many of jazz's biggest names from the 1950s to the 1970s, included the root note in their voicings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejazzpianosite.com/jazz-piano-lessons/jazz-chord-voicings/powell-voicings/|title=Bud Powell Chord Voicings - The Jazz Piano Site|work=The Jazz Piano Site|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/259793476/5-Ways-to-Play-Like-Horace-Silver|title=5 Ways to Play Like Horace Silver {{!}} Jazz {{!}} Piano|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}</ref>\n\n[[jazz improvisation|Improvising]] chord-playing musicians who omit the root and fifth are given the option to play other notes. For example, if a seventh chord, such as G<sup>7</sup>, appears in a lead sheet or fake book, many chord-playing performers add the [[ninth]] or [[thirteenth]] to the chord, even though the lead sheet does not specify these additional notes. Jazz players can add these additional, upper notes\u2013seventh, ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth\u2013because they can create an important part of the jazz sound. Lead sheets and fake books often do not detail how to voice the chord because a lead sheet or fake book is only intended to provide basic guide to the harmony. An experienced \"[[comping]]\" performer playing [[electric guitar]] or [[piano]] adds the extra notes as chosen according to the style and desired sound of that musician.\n\nIn voicing jazz chords, performers focus first on the seventh and the major or minor third of the chord, with the latter indicating the [[major and minor|chord quality]], along with added [[extended chord|chord extensions]] (e.g., ninths, elevenths, or thirteenths, even if not indicated in the lead sheet or fake book) to add tone \"colour\" to the chord. As such, a [[jazz guitar]]ist or [[jazz piano]] player might \"voice\" a printed G<sup>7</sup> chord with the notes B\u2013E\u2013F\u2013A, which would be the third, sixth (thirteenth), flat seventh, and ninth of the chord. Jazz chord-playing musicians may also add [[altered chord|altered chord tones]] (e.g., {{music|b}}9, {{music|#}}9, {{music|#}}11, {{music|b}}13) and [[Added tone chord|added tones]]. An example of an [[altered dominant]] chord in the key of C, built on a G would be to voice the chord as \"B\u2013C{{music|#}}\u2013E\u2013F\u2013A{{music|b}}\"; this would be G<sup>7({{music|b}}9{{music|#}}11)</sup>.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n===Intervals===\nEach chord is described as a series of [[Interval (music)|intervallic]] relationships to the root of the chord. This provides an accurate and easily understandable basis for working out these chords in each key.\n\nThe terms used to describe intervals are as follows:\n*'''r''' = [[root (chord)|root]] of the chord (while the root is widely used in [[classical music]], [[pop music]] and [[rock music]] chord voicings, in jazz, the root is often omitted by the chord-playing performer(s))\n*'''{{music|flat}}2''' = minor second = 1 [[semitone]] (half step) above the root\n*'''2''' = [[major second]] = 2 semitones above root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}2''' = [[augmented second]] = 3 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}3''' = [[minor third]] = 3 semitones above the root\n*'''3''' = [[major third]] = 4 semitones above the root\n*'''4''' = [[perfect fourth]] = 5 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}4''' = [[Augmented Fourth|augmented fourth]] ([[tritone]]) = 6 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}5''' = [[diminished fifth]] (tritone) = 6 semitones above the root\n*'''5''' = [[perfect fifth]] = 7 semitones above the root (while the fifth is widely used in [[classical music]], [[pop music]] and [[rock music]] chord voicings, in jazz, the fifth is often omitted by the chord-playing performer(s))\n*'''{{music|sharp}}5''' = [[augmented fifth]] = 8 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}6''' = [[minor sixth]] = 8 semitones above the root\n*'''6''' = [[major sixth]] = 9 semitones above the root\n*'''7''' = [[minor seventh]] = 10 semitones above the root\n*'''M7''' = [[major seventh]] = 11 semitones above the root\n\nAll [[Inversion (music)#Root position|root chords]] are described starting with the lowest note, and ascending in pitch. For instance, a chord described as\n\n:root, 3, 5.\n\ncontains the root, a major third above the root, and a perfect fifth above the root. It is a [[Major chord|major triad]]. If this chord were built on C (with C as the root), it would contain the notes\n\n:C, E, G.\n\n==== Compound intervals ====\n[[Interval (music)#Number|Compound intervals]] are intervals larger than an [[octave]]. They can also be described as an octave plus a simple interval. Note that this is not a complete list of compound intervals, only those that are commonly used in jazz chords.\n\n*'''{{music|flat}}9''' = compound minor second ([[minor ninth]]) = 1 semitone + an octave = 13 semitones above the root\n*'''9''' = compound major second ([[ninth]]) = 2 semitones + an octave = 14 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}9'''/'''{{music|flat}}10''' = compound [[augmented second]]/minor third (augmented ninth/minor tenth) = 3 semitones + an octave = 15 semitones above the root.\n*'''10''' = compound major third ([[tenth (music)|tenth]]) = 4 semitones + an octave = 16 semitones above the root\n*'''11''' = compound perfect fourth ([[eleventh]]) = 5 semitones + an octave = 17 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}11''' = compound augmented fourth  (augmented eleventh) = 6 semitones + an octave = 18 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}13''' = compound minor sixth (minor thirteenth) = 8 semitones + an octave = 20 semitones above the root\n*'''13''' = compound major sixth ([[thirteenth]]) = 9 semitones + an octave = 21 semitones above the root\n\n===Extensions===\n\nOptional extensions to the chords are written in parentheses, e.g. ({{music|sharp}}11). These notes are not necessary to define the function of the chord, but are included to add colour or fill out the sound according to the tastes of the performer. Extensions may be written into the chords when a specific colour or texture is warranted, or the chords in a lead sheet or fake book may simply state \"{{nowrap|C<sup>7</sup> \u2013 A<sup>7</sup> \u2013 D<sup>7</sup> \u2013 G<sup>7</sup>}}\". This does not mean that the chord-playing performer can only perform four-note [[dominant seventh]] chords. Chord-playing performers can use their ear, their sense of good taste acquired from listening to jazz, and their knowledge of the style of the tune being played (e.g., is it a [[bebop]] tune or a [[jazz fusion]] tune) to help guide her use of extension notes, altered extensions, and added tones. In a band, the [[bandleader]] might request that certain voicings be used (e.g., {{music|b}}9/{{music|#}}11) or request that certain other voicings be avoided (e.g., {{music|b}}13), due to the bandleader's taste.\n\n===Voicings===\n\nChords are described here in terms of intervals relative to the root of the chord, arranged from smaller intervals to larger. This is a standard method used when describing jazz chords as it shows them hierarchically: Lower intervals (third, [[fifth (chord)|fifth]] and seventh) are more important in defining the function of the chord than the upper intervals or extensions (9th, 11th, 13th), which add color. Although it is possible to play the chords as described here literally, it is possible to use different orderings of the same notes, known as a voicings, or even by omitting certain notes.{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g bes d fis a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=C<sup>13({{music|sharp}}11)</sup>|max-width=}}For instance, the dominant seventh {{music|sharp}}11 or [[Lydian mode|Lydian]] dominant, C<sup>7{{music|sharp}}11</sup>, comprises the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, (5), 7, (9), {{music|sharp}}11, (13).\n\nBasing this chord on the pitch, C, results in the pitches:\n:C <small>(often omitted)</small>, E, G, B{{music|flat}}, D, F{{music|sharp}}, A.\n\nThe same chord type may also be voiced:\n\n:C <small>(often omitted)</small>, E, B{{music|flat}}, F{{music|sharp}}, A, D, F{{music|sharp}}.\n\nThis voicing omits both the root and the perfect fifth (G) and raises the major ninth (D) by an octave. The augmented eleventh (F{{music|sharp}}) is also played twice in two different registers. This is known as \"[[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubling]]\".\n\n===Improvisation===\n\n[[File:Notes bell curve.png|thumb|An arrangement of musical intervals according to how satisfying they may sound.]]\n\nJazz improvisation is partly about selecting intervals within the chord or melody being played at a particular place in a song. While there are no right or wrong choices if notes are played in correct context, the graphic suggests how choices can be anything from boring through interesting to 'wrong' sounding, but of course these judgments are strongly a matter of taste and experience. Notes farther from the chord can often be inserted between other notes that are on the chord, such as E-Eb-Db-C over a C7 chord.\n\n==Chord types==\n===Basic chord types===\n\nThe above chords, despite their differences, share the same harmonic function and can be used interchangeably.\n\n==== Major chords ====\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g b>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Major seventh chord on C i.e. C<sup>\u03947</sup>|max-width=}}\nA [[major seventh chord]] contains the notes:\n\n:root, 3, 5, M7, (9).\nThe symbols '''<sup>M7</sup>''' and '''<sup>\u03947</sup>''' have the same meaning as '''maj<sup>7</sup>''' or just '''<sup>\u0394</sup>'''. Often melody notes or other pitches influence an improviser's choice of chord types. For example, if the melody note is the root of the chord, including a major seventh can cause dissonance.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Major sixth chord on C i.e. C<sup>6</sup>|max-width=}}\nA [[major sixth chord]] contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5, 6.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g a d>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Major 6/9 chord on C i.e. C<sup>6/9</sup>|max-width=}}\n\nA [[6/9 chord]] (C<sup>6/9</sup> or C<sup>6add9</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5, 6, 9.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g b d fis a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Lydian chord on C i.e. C<sup>\u0394{{music|sharp}}11</sup>|max-width=}}\n\nA [[Lydian chord]] (C<sup>\u0394{{music|sharp}}11</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5, M7, (9), {{music|sharp}}11 (13).\nThe Lydian chord has a strange quirk, where if you put the root both above and below the augmented eleventh it creates an unpleasant dissonance of a [[tritone]]. This is not usually a problem in a jazz context, as chord-playing musicians often omit the root.\n\nThe interval of the sixth is used, even though it is described after other compound intervals and perhaps should also be a compound interval (i.e., 13th). However, a convention in jazz dictates that when describing the major sixth, generally use the simple interval, i.e., 6 is often used instead of the compound interval, i.e., 13. This helps avoid confusion with the [[dominant thirteenth chord]].\n\n====Basic dominant chords====\n''Basic'' describes [[Dominant chord|dominant chords]] based on the major scale. In many instances, dominant chords written as a basic chord (e.g., C<sup>13</sup>) can substitute for a more complex chord, as long as it remains part of the same group (i.e., dominant chords) and does not clash with the melody note.\n\nDominant chords are considered to sound unstable in a [[classical music]] harmony context, and so in a classical piece, these chords often resolve down a perfect fifth or up a perfect fourth (e.g. '''C<sup>7</sup>''' tends to resolve onto chords based on '''F''', such as F major or F minor). However, in a jazz context, particularly in music from the 1940s [[bebop]] era and later decades, dominant chords were no longer treated as \"unstable\" chords. Some bebop tunes use a dominant chord as the [[tonic (music)|tonic chord]] and also use dominant chords for the chords that would typically be minor chords in a [[Classical music|Classical]] piece or a [[Swing music|swing]] arrangement. For example, while a Classical piece and a swing arrangement might use the following chord sequence in the key of C major: \"{{nowrap|C \u2013 Am \u2013 Dm \u2013 G<sup>7</sup>}}\", a bebop [[bandleader]] might reharmonize the same progression as \"{{nowrap|C<sup>7</sup> \u2013 A<sup>7</sup> \u2013 D<sup>7</sup> \u2013 G<sup>7</sup>}}\", making a sequence of dominant seventh chords, so long as the new dominant chord harmonies were compatible with the tune's melody. For more details, see [[chord progression]].\n\nMany of the chordal alterations used in jazz are derived from minor scale modes, as opposed to the major scale modes. (See [[musical mode]]). If the performer retains the 13th in the chord and/or avoids playing a {{music|flat}}13th, it can be substituted for a C<sup>13{{music|flat}}9</sup>. Likewise a C<sup>9</sup> can often be substituted for a Cmaj<sup>9{{music|sharp}}5</sup>, as long as the 9th is retained or the {{music|flat}}9th and {{music|sharp}}9th is avoided.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g bes>1\n   <c e g bes d>1\n   <c e g bes d f a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Dominant seventh, ninth, and thirteenth chords on C i.e. C<sup>7</sup>, C<sup>9</sup>, and C<sup>13</sup>|max-width=}}A [[dominant seventh chord]] contains the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5 <small>(often omitted)</small>, 7, (9), (13).\n\nA [[dominant ninth chord]] (C<sup>9</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5 <small>(often omitted)</small>, 7, 9, (13).\n\nA [[dominant thirteenth chord]] (C<sup>13</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5 <small>(often omitted)</small>, 7, (9), 13.\n\nThis symbol is often used if the 13th is found in the melody.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c f g>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Sus chord on C i.e. C<sup>sus4</sup>|max-width=}}\n\nA [[Suspended chord|sus, or suspended, chord]] (C<sup>7sus4</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root, 4, 5, 7, (9), (13).\n\n====Minor seventh chords====\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c es g bes>1\n   <c es g bes d>1\n   <c es g bes d f>1\n   <c es g bes d f a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Minor seventh, ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth chords on C i.e. Cm<sup>7</sup>, Cm<sup>9</sup>, Cm<sup>11</sup>, Cm<sup>13</sup>|max-width=}}A minor seventh chord (C\u2212<sup>7</sup>, Cmin<sup>7</sup>, Cmi<sup>7</sup>, or Cm<sup>7</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, (9), (11), (13).\n\nA minor ninth chord (C\u2212<sup>9</sup>, Cmin<sup>9</sup>, Cmi<sup>9</sup>, or Cm<sup>9</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, 9, (11), (13).\n\nA minor eleventh chord (C\u2212<sup>11</sup>, Cmin<sup>11</sup>, Cmi<sup>11</sup>, or Cm<sup>11</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, (9), 11, (13).\n\nA minor thirteenth chord (C\u2212<sup>13</sup>, Cmin<sup>13</sup>, Cmi<sup>13</sup>, or Cm<sup>13</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, (9), (11), 13.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Complex dominant chords===\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e gis bes>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Augmented seventh chord on C i.e. C<sup>7({{music|sharp}}5)</sup>|max-width=}}\nThese chords can be voiced in a great variety of ways, including building the chord on the 7 (minor seventh).

In jazz chords and theory, most [[triad (music)|triad]]s that appear in [[lead sheet]]s or [[fake book]]s can have [[Seventh (chord)|sevenths]] added to them, using the performer's discretion and ear. For example, if a tune is in the key of C, if there is a G chord, the chord-playing performer usually [[Chord voicing|voices]] this chord as G<sup>7</sup>. While the notes of a G<sup>7</sup> chord are G\u2013B\u2013D\u2013F, jazz often omits the [[Fifth (chord)|fifth]] of the chord\u2014and even the [[Root (chord)|root]] if playing in a group. However, not all jazz pianists leave out the root when they play voicings: [[Bud Powell]], one of the best-known of the bebop pianists, and [[Horace Silver]], whose quintet included many of jazz's biggest names from the 1950s to the 1970s, included the root note in their voicings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejazzpianosite.com/jazz-piano-lessons/jazz-chord-voicings/powell-voicings/|title=Bud Powell Chord Voicings - The Jazz Piano Site|work=The Jazz Piano Site|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/259793476/5-Ways-to-Play-Like-Horace-Silver|title=5 Ways to Play Like Horace Silver {{!}} Jazz {{!}} Piano|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}</ref>\n\n[[jazz improvisation|Improvising]] chord-playing musicians who omit the root and fifth are given the option to play other notes. For example, if a seventh chord, such as G<sup>7</sup>, appears in a lead sheet or fake book, many chord-playing performers add the [[ninth]] or [[thirteenth]] to the chord, even though the lead sheet does not specify these additional notes. Jazz players can add these additional, upper notes\u2013seventh, ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth\u2013because they can create an important part of the jazz sound. Lead sheets and fake books often do not detail how to voice the chord because a lead sheet or fake book is only intended to provide basic guide to the harmony. An experienced \"[[comping]]\" performer playing [[electric guitar]] or [[piano]] adds the extra notes as chosen according to the style and desired sound of that musician.\n\nIn voicing jazz chords, performers focus first on the seventh and the major or minor third of the chord, with the latter indicating the [[major and minor|chord quality]], along with added [[extended chord|chord extensions]] (e.g., ninths, elevenths, or thirteenths, even if not indicated in the lead sheet or fake book) to add tone \"colour\" to the chord. As such, a [[jazz guitar]]ist or [[jazz piano]] player might \"voice\" a printed G<sup>7</sup> chord with the notes B\u2013E\u2013F\u2013A, which would be the third, sixth (thirteenth), flat seventh, and ninth of the chord. Jazz chord-playing musicians may also add [[altered chord|altered chord tones]] (e.g., {{music|b}}9, {{music|#}}9, {{music|#}}11, {{music|b}}13) and [[Added tone chord|added tones]]. An example of an [[altered dominant]] chord in the key of C, built on a G would be to voice the chord as \"B\u2013C{{music|#}}\u2013E\u2013F\u2013A{{music|b}}\"; this would be G<sup>7({{music|b}}9{{music|#}}11)</sup>.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n===Intervals===\nEach chord is described as a series of [[Interval (music)|intervallic]] relationships to the root of the chord. This provides an accurate and easily understandable basis for working out these chords in each key.\n\nThe terms used to describe intervals are as follows:\n*'''r''' = [[root (chord)|root]] of the chord (while the root is widely used in [[classical music]], [[pop music]] and [[rock music]] chord voicings, in jazz, the root is often omitted by the chord-playing performer(s))\n*'''{{music|flat}}2''' = minor second = 1 [[semitone]] (half step) above the root\n*'''2''' = [[major second]] = 2 semitones above root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}2''' = [[augmented second]] = 3 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}3''' = [[minor third]] = 3 semitones above the root\n*'''3''' = [[major third]] = 4 semitones above the root\n*'''4''' = [[perfect fourth]] = 5 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}4''' = [[Augmented Fourth|augmented fourth]] ([[tritone]]) = 6 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}5''' = [[diminished fifth]] (tritone) = 6 semitones above the root\n*'''5''' = [[perfect fifth]] = 7 semitones above the root (while the fifth is widely used in [[classical music]], [[pop music]] and [[rock music]] chord voicings, in jazz, the fifth is often omitted by the chord-playing performer(s))\n*'''{{music|sharp}}5''' = [[augmented fifth]] = 8 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}6''' = [[minor sixth]] = 8 semitones above the root\n*'''6''' = [[major sixth]] = 9 semitones above the root\n*'''7''' = [[minor seventh]] = 10 semitones above the root\n*'''M7''' = [[major seventh]] = 11 semitones above the root\n\nAll [[Inversion (music)#Root position|root chords]] are described starting with the lowest note, and ascending in pitch. For instance, a chord described as\n\n:root, 3, 5.\n\ncontains the root, a major third above the root, and a perfect fifth above the root. It is a [[Major chord|major triad]]. If this chord were built on C (with C as the root), it would contain the notes\n\n:C, E, G.\n\n==== Compound intervals ====\n[[Interval (music)#Number|Compound intervals]] are intervals larger than an [[octave]]. They can also be described as an octave plus a simple interval. Note that this is not a complete list of compound intervals, only those that are commonly used in jazz chords.\n\n*'''{{music|flat}}9''' = compound minor second ([[minor ninth]]) = 1 semitone + an octave = 13 semitones above the root\n*'''9''' = compound major second ([[ninth]]) = 2 semitones + an octave = 14 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}9'''/'''{{music|flat}}10''' = compound [[augmented second]]/minor third (augmented ninth/minor tenth) = 3 semitones + an octave = 15 semitones above the root.\n*'''10''' = compound major third ([[tenth (music)|tenth]]) = 4 semitones + an octave = 16 semitones above the root\n*'''11''' = compound perfect fourth ([[eleventh]]) = 5 semitones + an octave = 17 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}11''' = compound augmented fourth  (augmented eleventh) = 6 semitones + an octave = 18 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}13''' = compound minor sixth (minor thirteenth) = 8 semitones + an octave = 20 semitones above the root\n*'''13''' = compound major sixth ([[thirteenth]]) = 9 semitones + an octave = 21 semitones above the root\n\n===Extensions===\n\nOptional extensions to the chords are written in parentheses, e.g. ({{music|sharp}}11). These notes are not necessary to define the function of the chord, but are included to add colour or fill out the sound according to the tastes of the performer. Extensions may be written into the chords when a specific colour or texture is warranted, or the chords in a lead sheet or fake book may simply state \"{{nowrap|C<sup>7</sup> \u2013 A<sup>7</sup> \u2013 D<sup>7</sup> \u2013 G<sup>7</sup>}}\". This does not mean that the chord-playing performer can only perform four-note [[dominant seventh]] chords. Chord-playing performers can use their ear, their sense of good taste acquired from listening to jazz, and their knowledge of the style of the tune being played (e.g., is it a [[bebop]] tune or a [[jazz fusion]] tune) to help guide her use of extension notes, altered extensions, and added tones. In a band, the [[bandleader]] might request that certain voicings be used (e.g., {{music|b}}9/{{music|#}}11) or request that certain other voicings be avoided (e.g., {{music|b}}13), due to the bandleader's taste.\n\n===Voicings===\n\nChords are described here in terms of intervals relative to the root of the chord, arranged from smaller intervals to larger. This is a standard method used when describing jazz chords as it shows them hierarchically: Lower intervals (third, [[fifth (chord)|fifth]] and seventh) are more important in defining the function of the chord than the upper intervals or extensions (9th, 11th, 13th), which add color. Although it is possible to play the chords as described here literally, it is possible to use different orderings of the same notes, known as a voicings, or even by omitting certain notes.{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g bes d fis a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=C<sup>13({{music|sharp}}11)</sup>|max-width=}}For instance, the dominant seventh {{music|sharp}}11 or [[Lydian mode|Lydian]] dominant, C<sup>7{{music|sharp}}11</sup>, comprises the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, (5), 7, (9), {{music|sharp}}11, (13).\n\nBasing this chord on the pitch, C, results in the pitches:\n:C <small>(often omitted)</small>, E, G, B{{music|flat}}, D, F{{music|sharp}}, A.\n\nThe same chord type may also be voiced:\n\n:C <small>(often omitted)</small>, E, B{{music|flat}}, F{{music|sharp}}, A, D, F{{music|sharp}}.\n\nThis voicing omits both the root and the perfect fifth (G) and raises the major ninth (D) by an octave. The augmented eleventh (F{{music|sharp}}) is also played twice in two different registers. This is known as \"[[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubling]]\".\n\n===Improvisation===\nJazz improvisation is partly about selecting intervals within the chord or melody being played at a particular place in a song. While there are no right or wrong choices if notes are played in correct context, the graphic suggests how choices can be anything from boring through interesting to 'wrong' sounding, but of course these judgments are strongly a matter of taste and experience. Notes farther from the chord can often be inserted between other notes that are on the chord, such as E-Eb-Db-C over a C7 chord.\n[[File:Notes bell curve.png|thumb|An arrangement of musical intervals according to how satisfying they may sound.]]\n\n==Chord types==\n===Basic chord types===\n\nThe above chords, despite their differences, share the same harmonic function and can be used interchangeably.\n\n==== Major chords ====\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g b>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Major seventh chord on C i.e. C<sup>\u03947</sup>|max-width=}}\nA [[major seventh chord]] contains the notes:\n\n:root, 3, 5, M7, (9).\nThe symbols '''<sup>M7</sup>''' and '''<sup>\u03947</sup>''' have the same meaning as '''maj<sup>7</sup>''' or just '''<sup>\u0394</sup>'''.

This is not usually a problem in a jazz context, as chord-playing musicians often omit the root.\n\nThe interval of the sixth is used, even though it is described after other compound intervals and perhaps should also be a compound interval (i.e., 13th). However, a convention in jazz dictates that when describing the major sixth, generally use the simple interval, i.e., 6 is often used instead of the compound interval, i.e., 13. This helps avoid confusion with the [[dominant thirteenth chord]].\n\n====Basic dominant chords====\n''Basic'' describes [[Dominant chord|dominant chords]] based on the major scale. In many instances, dominant chords written as a basic chord (e.g., C<sup>13</sup>) can substitute for a more complex chord, as long as it remains part of the same group (i.e., dominant chords) and does not clash with the melody note.\n\nDominant chords are considered to sound unstable in a [[classical music]] harmony context, and so in a classical piece, these chords often resolve down a perfect fifth or up a perfect fourth (e.g. '''C<sup>7</sup>''' tends to resolve onto chords based on '''F''', such as F major or F minor). However, in a jazz context, particularly in music from the 1940s [[bebop]] era and later decades, dominant chords were no longer treated as \"unstable\" chords. Some bebop tunes use a dominant chord as the [[tonic (music)|tonic chord]] and also use dominant chords for the chords that would typically be minor chords in a [[Classical music|Classical]] piece or a [[Swing music|swing]] arrangement. For example, while a Classical piece and a swing arrangement might use the following chord sequence in the key of C major: \"{{nowrap|C \u2013 Am \u2013 Dm \u2013 G<sup>7</sup>}}\", a bebop [[bandleader]] might reharmonize the same progression as \"{{nowrap|C<sup>7</sup> \u2013 A<sup>7</sup> \u2013 D<sup>7</sup> \u2013 G<sup>7</sup>}}\", making a sequence of dominant seventh chords, so long as the new dominant chord harmonies were compatible with the tune's melody. For more details, see [[chord progression]].\n\nMany of the chordal alterations used in jazz are derived from minor scale modes, as opposed to the major scale modes. (See [[musical mode]]). If the performer retains the 13th in the chord and/or avoids playing a {{music|flat}}13th, it can be substituted for a C<sup>13{{music|flat}}9</sup>. Likewise a C<sup>9</sup> can often be substituted for a Cmaj<sup>9{{music|sharp}}5</sup>, as long as the 9th is retained or the {{music|flat}}9th and {{music|sharp}}9th is avoided.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g bes>1\n   <c e g bes d>1\n   <c e g bes d f a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Dominant seventh, ninth, and thirteenth chords on C i.e. C<sup>7</sup>, C<sup>9</sup>, and C<sup>13</sup>|max-width=}}A [[dominant seventh chord]] contains the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5 <small>(often omitted)</small>, 7, (9), (13).\n\nA [[dominant ninth chord]] (C<sup>9</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5 <small>(often omitted)</small>, 7, 9, (13).\n\nA [[dominant thirteenth chord]] (C<sup>13</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5 <small>(often omitted)</small>, 7, (9), 13.\n\nThis symbol is often used if the 13th is found in the melody.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c f g>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Sus chord on C i.e. C<sup>sus4</sup>|max-width=}}\n\nA [[Suspended chord|sus, or suspended, chord]] (C<sup>7sus4</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root, 4, 5, 7, (9), (13).\n\n====Minor seventh chords====\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c es g bes>1\n   <c es g bes d>1\n   <c es g bes d f>1\n   <c es g bes d f a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Minor seventh, ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth chords on C i.e. Cm<sup>7</sup>, Cm<sup>9</sup>, Cm<sup>11</sup>, Cm<sup>13</sup>|max-width=}}A minor seventh chord (C\u2212<sup>7</sup>, Cmin<sup>7</sup>, Cmi<sup>7</sup>, or Cm<sup>7</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, (9), (11), (13).\n\nA minor ninth chord (C\u2212<sup>9</sup>, Cmin<sup>9</sup>, Cmi<sup>9</sup>, or Cm<sup>9</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, 9, (11), (13).\n\nA minor eleventh chord (C\u2212<sup>11</sup>, Cmin<sup>11</sup>, Cmi<sup>11</sup>, or Cm<sup>11</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, (9), 11, (13).\n\nA minor thirteenth chord (C\u2212<sup>13</sup>, Cmin<sup>13</sup>, Cmi<sup>13</sup>, or Cm<sup>13</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, (9), (11), 13.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Complex dominant chords===\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e gis bes>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Augmented seventh chord on C i.e. C<sup>7({{music|sharp}}5)</sup>|max-width=}}\nThese chords can be voiced in a great variety of ways, including building the chord on the 7 (minor seventh).  They usually, but not always, lead to a minor chord built on an interval a fourth up from the root.  It is also not unusual to express either the {{music|sharp}}9 or {{music|flat}}9 or the {{music|sharp}}5 in the melody.  For expediency, musicians may use the abbreviation \"alt\"\u2014as in C<sup>7alt</sup>\u2014to describe the family of dominant chords with [[alteration (music)|altered tones]] (including the {{music|flat}}5, {{music|sharp}}5, {{music|flat}}9, {{music|sharp}}9, or {{music|flat}}13). Coincidentally, all altered tones mentioned above are present in the [[melodic minor scale]] whose root is a half-step above the root of the [[altered chord|alt chord]] (i.e., E{{music|flat}} melodic minor for D<sup>7alt</sup>) In the previous dominant chords, it was noted that the perfect fifth is often omitted. When the fifth is augmented, the fifth is played by chord-playing musicians.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e gis bes dis>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Dominant {{music|sharp}}9/{{music|sharp}}5 chord on C i.e. C<sup>7({{music|sharp}}9{{music|sharp}}5)</sup>|max-width=}}\n\nA dominant {{music|sharp}}9/{{music|sharp}}5 chord (C<sup>7({{music|sharp}}5{{music|sharp}}9)</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, {{music|sharp}}5, 7, {{music|sharp}}9.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e gis bes des>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Dominant {{music|flat}}9/{{music|sharp}}5 chord on C i.e. C<sup>7({{music|flat}}9/{{music|sharp}}5)</sup>|max-width=}}\nA dominant {{music|flat}}9/{{music|sharp}}5 chord (C<sup>7({{music|sharp}}5{{music|flat}}9)</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, {{music|sharp}}5, 7, {{music|flat}}9.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Further reading ===\n\n*Nettles, Barrie & Graf, Richard (1997).

At the same time, as its original purpose grew obsolete because of the integrated program guides offered by digital television platforms, the network began to downplay and phase out its program listings service; as of June 2014, none of the network's carriage contracts require the display of the listings, and they were excluded entirely from its [[high-definition television|high-definition]] simulcast. In 2015, the network was rebranded as Pop. In 2019, CBS acquired Lionsgate's 50% stake in the network and merged with [[Viacom (2005\u20132019)|Viacom]].\n\nPop is available to 67.348 million households in America as of September 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://awfulannouncing.com/espn/nielsen-coverage-estimates-september-espn-nbcsn-nbatv-mlbn-nfln.html|title=Nielsen coverage estimates for September see gains at ESPN networks, NBCSN, and NBA TV, drops at MLBN and NFLN|website=awfulannouncing.com|access-date=July 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Pop (American TV channel)}}\n\nOn September 18, 2014, CBS and Lionsgate announced that '''TVGN''' (previously '''TV Guide Network''') would be relaunched as '''Pop''' in early 2015, with the rebranding later announced to occur on January 14 of that year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pop Network to Debut on Wednesday January 14, 2015|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/11/17/pop-network-to-debut-on-wednesday-january-14-2015/328642/|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=November 17, 2014|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}</ref> The newly branded channel would shift toward programming about pop culture fandom and would carry 400 hours of original programming following the rebrand, including a reality show starring [[New Kids on the Block]] and the [[Canada|Canadian]] sitcom ''[[Schitt's Creek]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=TVGN Rebrands as Pop, Shifts Focus on Fans|url=https://deadline.com/2014/09/tvgn-rebrand-pop-focus-on-fans-836044/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=September 18, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=TV Guide Network to Relaunch In Early 2015 As POP|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/cables-tvgn-to-relaunch-in-early-2015-as-pop-1201308419/|author=Brian Steinberg|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 18, 2014|accessdate=September 18, 2014}}</ref>, the first program from Pop TV to receive [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations, including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/schitts-creek-breaks-first-emmy-nominations-pop-tv-1224564|title=Pop TV President Celebrates 'Schitt's Creek' Emmy Breakthrough: \"Holy S***!\"|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=July 16, 2019}}</ref> Pop was made available on [[AT&T U-verse]] on March 1, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/cbs-att-carriage-deal-contract-expiration-1201532426/|title=CBS, AT&T Reach Carriage Deal After All-Night Negotiations|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=July 1, 2015|accessdate=November 19, 2015}}</ref> \n\nOn March 12, 2019, CBS acquired Lionsgate's 50% stake in Pop, making Pop a part of CBS Cable Networks.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Takes Control of Pop TV Cabler, Buys Out Lionsgate\u2019s 50% Stake|date=March 12, 2019|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/cbs-pop-schitts-creek-lionsgate-50-1203161651/|accessdate=March 12, 2019}}</ref> It then became part of [[ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks]] on December 4, 2019, when CBS [[2019 merger of CBS and Viacom|merged]] with [[Viacom (2005\u20132019)|Viacom]].

Reputedly the most extreme clipper ever built, ''Hurricane'' proved a very fast vessel, reportedly capable of speeds of up to {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h}} in ideal conditions, and establishing a number of all-time record,{{efn|That is, all-time records for merchant sailing ships or sail warships. Modern high-speed noncommercial watercraft such as yachts have been known to set new record times between some locations in recent years.}} or record-equalling, passages in the early years of her career. \n\n''Hurricane'' made a total of four [[New York City|New York]]-to-[[San Francisco]] voyages while under the American flag, the fastest of which was an outstanding 100-day passage in 1854. After arriving at San Francisco, the ship would usually continue on to China or [[Hong Kong]] before returning via San Francisco to New York. She also made several voyages between England and India during this period, including a record 1855 passage that stood for many years. \n\nDue partly to [[Panic of 1857|an economic depression]] in the United States, ''Hurricane'' was laid up for about a year at New York in 1857&ndash;58. In late 1858, she sailed via San Francisco for [[Singapore]], where in 1860 she was sold to British interests. Renamed ''Shaw-Allum'', little is known about her subsequent career. Her last entry in shipping registers was in 1876. \n\n== Construction and design ==\n\n''Hurricane'', an extreme clipper, was built in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1851 by [[Isaac C.

Reputedly the most extreme clipper ever built, ''Hurricane'' proved a very fast vessel, reportedly capable of speeds of up to {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h}} in ideal conditions, and establishing a number of all-time record,{{efn|That is, all-time records for merchant sailing ships or sail warships. Modern high-speed noncommercial watercraft such as yachts have been known to set new record times between some locations in recent years.}} or record-equalling, passages in the early years of her career. \n\n''Hurricane'' made a total of four [[New York City|New York]]-to-[[San Francisco]] voyages while under the American flag, the fastest of which was an outstanding 100-day passage in 1854. After arriving at San Francisco, the ship would usually continue on to China or [[Hong Kong]] before returning via San Francisco to New York. She also made several voyages between England and India during this period, including a record 1855 passage that stood for many years. \n\nDue partly to [[Panic of 1857|an economic depression]] in the United States, ''Hurricane'' was laid up for about a year at New York in 1857&ndash;58. In late 1858, she sailed via San Francisco for [[Singapore]], where in 1860 she was sold to British interests. Renamed ''Shaw-Allum'', little is known about her subsequent career. Her last entry in shipping registers was in 1876. \n\n== Construction and design ==\n\n''Hurricane'', an extreme clipper, was built in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1851 by [[Isaac C.
