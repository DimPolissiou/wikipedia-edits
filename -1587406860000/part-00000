L2TP does not provide confidentiality or strong authentication by itself. [[IPsec]] is often used to secure L2TP packets by providing confidentiality, authentication and integrity. The combination of these two protocols is generally known as L2TP/IPsec (discussed below).\n\nThe two endpoints of an L2TP tunnel are called the ''LAC'' (''L2TP Access Concentrator'') and the ''LNS'' (''L2TP Network Server''). The LNS waits for new tunnels. Once a tunnel is established, the network traffic between the peers is bidirectional. To be useful for networking, higher-level protocols are then run through the L2TP tunnel. To facilitate this, an L2TP ''session'' (or ''''call'''') is established within the tunnel for each higher-level protocol such as PPP. Either the LAC or LNS may initiate sessions.  The traffic for each session is isolated by L2TP, so it is possible to set up multiple virtual networks across a single tunnel. [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] should be considered when implementing L2TP.\n\nThe [[packet (information technology)|packets]] exchanged within an L2TP tunnel are categorized as either ''control packets'' or ''data packets''. L2TP provides reliability features for the control packets, but no reliability for data packets. Reliability, if desired, must be provided by the nested protocols running within each session of the L2TP tunnel.\n\nL2TP allows the creation of a virtual private dialup network (VPDN)<ref>[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk801/tk703/technologies_tech_note09186a0080094586.shtml Cisco Support: Understanding VPDN \u2013 Updated Jan 29, 2008]</ref> to connect a remote client to its corporate network by using a shared infrastructure, which could be the Internet or a service provider's network.\n\n==Tunneling models==\nAn L2TP tunnel can extend across an entire PPP session or only across one segment of a two-segment session. This can be represented by four different tunneling models, namely:\n*voluntary tunnel\n*compulsory tunnel \u2014 incoming call\n*compulsory tunnel \u2014 remote dial\n*L2TP [[Multi-hop routing|multihop]] connection<ref>[http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v7r1m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Frzaiy%2Frzaiymultihop.htm IBM Knowledge Center: L2TP multi-hop connection]</ref>\n\n==L2TP packet structure==\nAn L2TP packet consists of :\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2px\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! style=\"width:20em\" | Bits 0\u201315\n! style=\"width:20em\" | Bits 16\u201331\n|-\n| Flags and Version Info\n| Length (opt)\n|-\n| Tunnel ID\n| Session ID\n|-\n| Ns (opt)\n| Nr (opt)\n|-\n| Offset Size (opt)\n| Offset Pad (opt)......\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"| Payload data\n|}\n\nField meanings:\n; Flags and version: control flags indicating data/control packet and presence of length, sequence, and offset fields.\n; Length (optional): Total length of the message in bytes, present only when length flag is set.\n; Tunnel ID: Indicates the identifier for the control connection.\n; Session ID: Indicates the identifier for a session within a tunnel.\n; Ns (optional): sequence number for this data or control message, beginning at zero and incrementing by one (modulo 2<sup>16</sup>) for each message sent. Present only when sequence flag set.\n; Nr (optional): sequence number for expected message to be received. Nr is set to the Ns of the last in-order message received plus one (modulo 2<sup>16</sup>). In data messages, Nr is reserved and, if present (as indicated by the S bit), MUST be ignored upon receipt..\n;Offset Size (optional): Specifies where payload data is located past the L2TP header. If the offset field is present, the L2TP header ends after the last byte of the offset padding. This field exists if the offset flag is set.\n;Offset Pad (optional): Variable length, as specified by the offset size.  Contents of this field are undefined.\n;Payload data: Variable length (Max payload size = Max size of UDP packet \u2212 size of L2TP header)\n\n==L2TP packet exchange==\nAt the time of setup of L2TP connection, many control packets are exchanged between server and client to establish tunnel and session for each direction. One peer requests the other peer to assign a specific tunnel and session id through these control packets. Then using this tunnel and session id, data packets are exchanged with the compressed PPP frames as payload.\n\nThe list of L2TP Control messages exchanged between LAC and LNS, for handshaking before establishing a tunnel and session in voluntary tunneling method are\n\n[[Image:l2tp pkt exchg.PNG]]\n\n==L2TP/IPsec==\nBecause of the lack of confidentiality inherent in the L2TP protocol, it is often implemented along with [[IPsec]]. This is referred to as L2TP/IPsec, and is standardized in [[IETF]] RFC 3193. The process of setting up an L2TP/IPsec VPN is as follows:\n\n#Negotiation of IPsec [[security association]] (SA), typically through ''[[Internet key exchange]]'' (IKE). This is carried out over UDP port 500, and commonly uses either a shared password (so-called \"[[pre-shared key]]s\"), public keys, or [[X.509]] certificates on both ends, although other keying methods exist.\n#Establishment of [[IPsec#Encapsulating Security Payload|Encapsulating Security Payload]] (ESP) communication in transport mode. The IP protocol number for ESP is 50 (compare TCP's 6 and UDP's 17). At this point, a secure channel has been established, but no tunneling is taking place.\n#Negotiation and establishment of L2TP tunnel between the SA endpoints. The actual negotiation of parameters takes place over the SA's secure channel, within the IPsec encryption. L2TP uses UDP port 1701.\n\nWhen the process is complete, L2TP packets between the endpoints are encapsulated by IPsec. Since the L2TP packet itself is wrapped and hidden within the IPsec packet, the original source and destination IP address is encrypted within the packet. Also, it is not necessary to open UDP port 1701 on firewalls between the endpoints, since the inner packets are not acted upon until after IPsec data has been decrypted and stripped, which only takes place at the endpoints.\n\nA potential point of confusion in L2TP/IPsec is the use of the terms '''tunnel''' and '''secure channel'''. The term '''tunnel-mode''' refers to a channel which allows untouched packets of one network to be transported over another network. In the case of L2TP/PPP, it allows L2TP/PPP packets to be transported over IP. A '''secure channel''' refers to a connection within which the confidentiality of all data is guaranteed. In L2TP/IPsec, first IPsec provides a secure channel, then L2TP provides a tunnel.\n\n==Windows implementation==\nWindows has had native support (configurable in control panel) for L2TP since [[Windows 2000]]. [[Windows Vista]] added 2 alternative tools, an [[Microsoft Management Console|MMC snap-in]] called \"Windows Firewall with Advanced Security\" (WFwAS) and the \"[[netsh]] advfirewall\" command-line tool. One limitation with both of the WFwAS and netsh commands is that servers must be specified by IP address. [[Windows 10]] added the \"[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/vpnclient/add-vpnconnection?view=win10-ps Add-VpnConnection]\" and \"[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/vpnclient/set-vpnconnectionipsecconfiguration?view=win10-ps Set-VpnConnectionIPsecConfiguration]\" [[PowerShell]] commands. A registry key must be created on the client and server if the server is behind a NAT-T device. [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/926179/how-to-configure-an-l2tp-ipsec-server-behind-a-nat-t-device-in-windows]\n\n==L2TP in ISPs' networks==\nL2TP is often used by ISPs when internet service over for example [[ADSL]] or cable is being ''resold''. From the end user, packets travel over a wholesale network service provider's network to a server called a Broadband Remote Access Server ([[BRAS]]), a protocol converter and router combined. On legacy networks the path from end user customer premises' equipment to the BRAS may be over an [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] network. \nFrom there on, over an IP network, an L2TP tunnel runs from the BRAS (acting as LAC) to an LNS which is an edge router at the boundary of the ultimate destination ISP's IP network.

[[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] should be considered when implementing L2TP.\n\nThe [[packet (information technology)|packets]] exchanged within an L2TP tunnel are categorized as either ''control packets'' or ''data packets''. L2TP provides reliability features for the control packets, but no reliability for data packets. Reliability, if desired, must be provided by the nested protocols running within each session of the L2TP tunnel.\n\nL2TP allows the creation of a virtual private dialup network (VPDN)<ref>[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk801/tk703/technologies_tech_note09186a0080094586.shtml Cisco Support: Understanding VPDN \u2013 Updated Jan 29, 2008]</ref> to connect a remote client to its corporate network by using a shared infrastructure, which could be the Internet or a service provider's network.\n\n==Tunneling models==\nAn L2TP tunnel can extend across an entire PPP session or only across one segment of a two-segment session. This can be represented by four different tunneling models, namely:\n*voluntary tunnel\n*compulsory tunnel \u2014 incoming call\n*compulsory tunnel \u2014 remote dial\n*L2TP [[Multi-hop routing|multihop]] connection<ref>[http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v7r1m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Frzaiy%2Frzaiymultihop.htm IBM Knowledge Center: L2TP multi-hop connection]</ref>\n\n==L2TP packet structure==\nAn L2TP packet consists of :\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2px\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! style=\"width:20em\" | Bits 0\u201315\n! style=\"width:20em\" | Bits 16\u201331\n|-\n| Flags and Version Info\n| Length (opt)\n|-\n| Tunnel ID\n| Session ID\n|-\n| Ns (opt)\n| Nr (opt)\n|-\n| Offset Size (opt)\n| Offset Pad (opt)......\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"| Payload data\n|}\n\nField meanings:\n; Flags and version: control flags indicating data/control packet and presence of length, sequence, and offset fields.\n; Length (optional): Total length of the message in bytes, present only when length flag is set.\n; Tunnel ID: Indicates the identifier for the control connection.\n; Session ID: Indicates the identifier for a session within a tunnel.\n; Ns (optional): sequence number for this data or control message, beginning at zero and incrementing by one (modulo 2<sup>16</sup>) for each message sent. Present only when sequence flag set.\n; Nr (optional): sequence number for expected message to be received. Nr is set to the Ns of the last in-order message received plus one (modulo 2<sup>16</sup>). In data messages, Nr is reserved and, if present (as indicated by the S bit), MUST be ignored upon receipt..\n;Offset Size (optional): Specifies where payload data is located past the L2TP header. If the offset field is present, the L2TP header ends after the last byte of the offset padding. This field exists if the offset flag is set.\n;Offset Pad (optional): Variable length, as specified by the offset size.  Contents of this field are undefined.\n;Payload data: Variable length (Max payload size = Max size of UDP packet \u2212 size of L2TP header)\n\n==L2TP packet exchange==\nAt the time of setup of L2TP connection, many control packets are exchanged between server and client to establish tunnel and session for each direction. One peer requests the other peer to assign a specific tunnel and session id through these control packets. Then using this tunnel and session id, data packets are exchanged with the compressed PPP frames as payload.\n\nThe list of L2TP Control messages exchanged between LAC and LNS, for handshaking before establishing a tunnel and session in voluntary tunneling method are\n\n[[Image:l2tp pkt exchg.PNG]]\n\n==L2TP/IPsec==\nBecause of the lack of confidentiality inherent in the L2TP protocol, it is often implemented along with [[IPsec]]. This is referred to as L2TP/IPsec, and is standardized in [[IETF]] RFC 3193. The process of setting up an L2TP/IPsec VPN is as follows:\n\n#Negotiation of IPsec [[security association]] (SA), typically through ''[[Internet key exchange]]'' (IKE). This is carried out over UDP port 500, and commonly uses either a shared password (so-called \"[[pre-shared key]]s\"), public keys, or [[X.509]] certificates on both ends, although other keying methods exist.\n#Establishment of [[IPsec#Encapsulating Security Payload|Encapsulating Security Payload]] (ESP) communication in transport mode. The IP protocol number for ESP is 50 (compare TCP's 6 and UDP's 17). At this point, a secure channel has been established, but no tunneling is taking place.\n#Negotiation and establishment of L2TP tunnel between the SA endpoints. The actual negotiation of parameters takes place over the SA's secure channel, within the IPsec encryption. L2TP uses UDP port 1701.\n\nWhen the process is complete, L2TP packets between the endpoints are encapsulated by IPsec. Since the L2TP packet itself is wrapped and hidden within the IPsec packet, the original source and destination IP address is encrypted within the packet. Also, it is not necessary to open UDP port 1701 on firewalls between the endpoints, since the inner packets are not acted upon until after IPsec data has been decrypted and stripped, which only takes place at the endpoints.\n\nA potential point of confusion in L2TP/IPsec is the use of the terms '''tunnel''' and '''secure channel'''. The term '''tunnel-mode''' refers to a channel which allows untouched packets of one network to be transported over another network. In the case of L2TP/PPP, it allows L2TP/PPP packets to be transported over IP. A '''secure channel''' refers to a connection within which the confidentiality of all data is guaranteed. In L2TP/IPsec, first IPsec provides a secure channel, then L2TP provides a tunnel.\n\n==Windows implementation==\nWindows has had native support (configurable in control panel) for L2TP since [[Windows 2000]]. [[Windows Vista]] added 2 alternative tools, an [[Microsoft Management Console|MMC snap-in]] called \"Windows Firewall with Advanced Security\" (WFwAS) and the \"[[netsh]] advfirewall\" command-line tool. One limitation with both of the WFwAS and netsh commands is that servers must be specified by IP address. [[Windows 10]] added the \"[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/vpnclient/add-vpnconnection?view=win10-ps Add-VpnConnection]\" and \"[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/vpnclient/set-vpnconnectionipsecconfiguration?view=win10-ps Set-VpnConnectionIPsecConfiguration]\" [[PowerShell]] commands. A registry key must be created on the client and server if the server is behind a NAT-T device.

From the end user, packets travel over a wholesale network service provider's network to a server called a Broadband Remote Access Server ([[BRAS]]), a protocol converter and router combined. On legacy networks the path from end user customer premises' equipment to the BRAS may be over an [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] network. \nFrom there on, over an IP network, an L2TP tunnel runs from the BRAS (acting as LAC) to an LNS which is an edge router at the boundary of the ultimate destination ISP's IP network.
