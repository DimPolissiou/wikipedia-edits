He is best known for his work with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now [[WWE]]) as '''Razor Ramon''' and with World Championship Wrestling ([[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]]) under his real name.\n\nBeginning with his time in the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), Hall maintained a perennially high profile as a wrestler, as he became a [[List of WWE Intercontinental Champions|four time]] [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Champion]] (a record from 1995 to 1999), a [[List of WWE United States Champions|two-time]] [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Champion]], a [[List of WCW World Television Champions|one-time]] [[WCW World Television Championship|WCW World Television Champion]], and a nine-time [[World tag team championship|world tag team champion]] ([[List of WCW World Tag Team Champions|seven times in WCW]], [[List of TNA World Tag Team Champions|once in TNA]], and [[AWA World Tag Team Championship|once in the AWA]]). In addition, Hall is a two-time [[world champion]], having won the [[WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship]] and the [[USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship]]. He is also notable for being a founding member of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order (nWo)]]. On April 5, 2014, Hall was inducted individually into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] as Razor Ramon, and he will be inducted a second time (this time under his real name) in 2020 as a member of nWo, together with fellow former stablemates [[Hulk Hogan]], [[Kevin Nash]] and [[Sean Waltman]].\n\n== Early life ==\nHall was born in St. Mary's County, Maryland.

When they did get in the ring, it was with little success. The highlight of their stay in Crockett's [[Jim Crockett Promotions|Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling]] was a losing challenge to [[Arn Anderson|Arn]] and [[Ole Anderson]] for the NWA National Tag Team Championship. After leaving Crockett, the duo joined [[Bob Geigel]]'s [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|NWA Central States]] territory (based in Kansas City) in 1985.\n\nThey received a shot at NWA Central States Tag Team Champions [[Marty Jannetty]] and \"Bulldog\" Bob Brown, but lost the match.

He is best known for his work with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now [[WWE]]) as '''Razor Ramon''' and with World Championship Wrestling ([[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]]) under his real name.\n\nBeginning with his time in the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), Hall maintained a perennially high profile as a wrestler, as he became a [[List of WWE Intercontinental Champions|four time]] [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Champion]] (a record from 1995 to 1999), a [[List of WWE United States Champions|two-time]] [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Champion]], a [[List of WCW World Television Champions|one-time]] [[WCW World Television Championship|WCW World Television Champion]], and a nine-time [[World tag team championship|world tag team champion]] ([[List of WCW World Tag Team Champions|seven times in WCW]], [[List of TNA World Tag Team Champions|once in TNA]], and [[AWA World Tag Team Championship|once in the AWA]]). In addition, Hall is a two-time [[world champion]], having won the [[WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship]] and the [[USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship]]. He is also notable for being a founding member of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order (nWo)]]. On April 5, 2014, Hall was inducted individually into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] as Razor Ramon, and he will be inducted a second time (this time under his real name) in 2020 as a member of nWo, together with fellow former stablemates [[Hulk Hogan]], [[Kevin Nash]] and [[Sean Waltman]].\n\n== Early life ==\nHall was born in St. Mary's County, Maryland.

When it was time for the two to debut as a tag team, Rhodes sent them to work in [[Jim Crockett]]'s [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] based territory. They debuted as American Starship, Hall under the ring name Starship Coyote and Spivey under the ring name Starship Eagle.<ref name=\"OWOW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/scott-hall.html|title=Scott Hall Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=June 18, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"earlycareer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/hall.html#beginning|title=Scott Hall's Early Career|work=Accelerator's Wrestling Rollercoaster|accessdate=June 18, 2008}}</ref>\n\nAt first, American Starship were booked to wrestle infrequently; so much so that the two were given ground crew jobs for the Charlotte Orioles (which Jim Crockett owned at the time). When they did get in the ring, it was with little success. The highlight of their stay in Crockett's [[Jim Crockett Promotions|Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling]] was a losing challenge to [[Arn Anderson|Arn]] and [[Ole Anderson]] for the NWA National Tag Team Championship. After leaving Crockett, the duo joined [[Bob Geigel]]'s [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|NWA Central States]] territory (based in Kansas City) in 1985.\n\nThey received a shot at NWA Central States Tag Team Champions [[Marty Jannetty]] and \"Bulldog\" Bob Brown, but lost the match.

He returned to the Carolinas and Crockett, [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobbing]] in the freshly rebranded [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] as \"American Starship\" Eagle.

This character has appeared with the Green Hornet in film, television, book and comic book versions. Kato was the Hornet's assistant and has been played by a number of actors. On radio, Kato was initially played by [[Raymond Hayashi]], then [[Roland Parker (actor)|Roland Parker]] who had the role for most of the run, and in the later years Mickey Tolan and Paul Carnegie.<ref>[[Jim Harmon|Harmon, Jim]], ''Radio Mystery and Adventure and Its Appearances in Film, Television and Other Media'', [[McFarland & Company|McFarland & Company, Inc.]], 1992.</ref> [[Keye Luke]] took the role in the movie serials, and in the [[The Green Hornet (TV series)|television series]] he was portrayed by [[Bruce Lee]]. [[Jay Chou]]  played Kato in the 2011 [[The Green Hornet (2011 film)|Green Hornet film]].\n\n==Character history==\nKato was [[Britt Reid]]'s valet, who doubled as The Green Hornet's [[mask]]ed driver and partner to help him in his vigilante adventures, disguised as the activities of a racketeer and his chauffeur/[[bodyguard]]/enforcer. According to the storyline, years before the events depicted in the series, Britt Reid had saved Kato's life while traveling in the Far East. Depending on the version of the story, this prompted Kato to become Reid's assistant or friend.  In the anthology The Green Hornet Chronicles from [[Moonstone Books]], author [[Richard Dean Starr]]'s story \"Nothing Gold Can Stay: An Origin Story of Kato\" explores the character's background and how he ends up living in America, suggesting that Kato met Britt Reid on a later trip back to his homeland while in search of his mother.\n\n===Radio program and nationality===\n[[George W. Trendle]], the owner of radio station WXYZ in Michigan first created and produced \"The Green Hornet\" show in 1936, with the scripts being written by [[Fran Striker]]. The show became so popular it ran for nearly two decades and spun off at least two films. This was Trendle and Striker's second big radio hit; their first was \"The [[Lone Ranger]].\" \n\nIn the 1936 premiere of the radio program, Kato was presented as being Japanese. By 1939, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|invasion of China]] by the [[Empire of Japan]] made this bad for public relations, and from that year until 1945 \"Britt Reid's Japanese valet\" in the show's opening was then simply identified by the announcer as his \"faithful valet.\" {{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The first of [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s two movie serials, produced in 1939 but not released to theaters until early 1940, referred in passing to Kato being \"a [[Koreans|Korean]]\".  By 1941, Kato had begun to be referred to as [[Filipino people|Filipino]].<ref>radio episode \"Walkout for Profit\" ''The Green Hornet Collection'', Volume 2, Tape 1, Side B, Wireless, 1995 (original airdate: June 21, 1941, [[Blue Network]])).</ref>  A long-standing, but false, urban legend maintained that the switch from one to the other occurred immediately after the 1941 bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]]. In serials, Kato was played by Chinese-born [[Americans|American]] actor [[Keye Luke]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Float Like a Franchise, Sting Like a ...  |work= [[The New York Times]]|date=2011-01-07|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/movies/09hornet.html?_r=1&hpw|accessdate=2011-01-10|first=Franz|last=Lidz}}</ref> In the 2011 film, Kato (played by [[Jay Chou]]) tells Britt Reid that he was born in the Chinese city of [[Shanghai]]; Reid replies by saying that he \"love[s] Japan\".\n\n\n\n===Television series===\n{{Main|The Green Hornet (TV series)}}\nThe televised series of \"[[The Green Hornet]]\" was created and produced by William Dozier, the owner of Greenway Productions, for ABC. It ran from 1966 to 1967 and was then cancelled after that one season. Van Williams played the Green Hornet and [[Bruce Lee]] played [[Kato]]. Dozier was also the creator of the more popular \"[[Batman]]\" television series. Even though he had the Green Hornet and Kato appear on \"[[Batman]]\" three times, they never acquired a large audience.\n\n[[File:Kato (Bruce Lee).png|thumb|left|upright|Kato, as portrayed by [[Bruce Lee]] in the television series]]\nIt was due in part to [[Bruce Lee]]'s portrayal of this character, that the Green Hornet became more well known, and that the martial arts became more popular in the United States in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite news|title= Getting 'The Green Hornet' off the ground|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 23, 2010|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/23/entertainment/la-et-green-hornet-20100723/3|accessdate=September 13, 2010|first=Geoff|last=Boucher}}</ref> Indeed, Lee refused to follow the American director's expectation of fisticuff fights and insisted he be allowed to use his martial arts skills. <ref>\"Bruce Lee Steals the Show in 'The Green Hornet'\" American Heritage Center Blog https://ahcwyo.org/2020/03/16/bruce-lee-steals-the-show-in-the-green-hornet/</ref> They became so popular with the audience that Van Williams, who played the Green Hornet, asked to be taught some moves. In a crossover episode of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' from the same time and companies, Kato had a battle with [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] that ended in a draw (the same thing happened simultaneously with their senior partners). This was in part because Lee refused to participate in a fight that showed Asian-style martial arts being defeated; the original script had the Green Hornet and Kato being beaten by Batman and Robin. The popular impression Lee made at the time is demonstrated by one of the TV series tie-in coloring books produced by Watkins & Strathmore. It is titled ''Kato's Revenge Featuring the Green Hornet''.<ref>Bonnet, Jean Pierre, \"The Buzz Word\" (letter to the editor), ''The Green Hornet'', Vol. 2, # 18, February 1993, [[NOW Comics]].</ref> ''The Green Hornet'''s success in Hong Kong, where it was popularly known as ''The Kato Show'', led to Lee starring in the [[Bruce Lee filmography|feature film]]s that would make him a pop culture icon. This show launched [[Bruce Lee]]'s adult television and film career. \n\nIn the TV series Kato (portrayed by [[Bruce Lee]]) is not at all a mechanic but a professional servant, a highly skilled driver, and a master of the art of war. In all other versions of the story he is also a mechanic, with the creations of both the special automobile, the Black Beauty, and the Hornet's trademark sleeping gas and the gun that delivered it attributed to him. In the television series he also became an expert in martial arts, which was implied in the first film serial with his use of a tranquilizing [[Knifehand strike|\"chop\"]] to the back of a thug's neck.\n\n\n===Comic book adaptations===\nAll ''Green Hornet'' comic book adaptations have included Kato. These were produced by [[Helnit]] (later [[Holyoke Publishing|Holyoke]]), [[Harvey Comics|Harvey]], [[Dell Comics|Dell]] and, tied into the television version, [[Gold Key Comics|Gold Key]]. Beginning in [[1989 in comics|1989]] one, published by [[NOW Comics]], established a continuity between the different versions of the story. In this comic, the TV/Bruce Lee version of Kato was the son of the Kato from the radio stories, and had the given name Hayashi as an homage to the character's first radio actor.<ref>[[Will Murray (writer)|Murray, Will]], \"Where Hornets Swarm,\" ''[[Comics Scene (magazine)|Comics Scene]]'', No. 9, October 1989, [[Starlog|Starlog Communications International, Inc.]], p.42.</ref>\n\nThe comic also established a new Kato, a much younger half-sister of the television-based character, Mishi. This female Kato also insisted on being treated as the Hornet's full partner rather than a sidekick. However, the Green Hornet, Inc., soon withdrew approval and this character was replaced with the 1960s version after Vol. 1, #10.<ref>Piron, Diane, \"The Buzz Word\" (letter column), ''The Green Hornet'', Vol. 1, No. 13, November 1990.</ref> Her removal was explained by having the Kato family company, Nippon Today, needing her automotive designing services at its Zurich, Switzerland facility. Mishi would return in Volume 2, appearing sporadically in the new costumed identity of the Crimson Wasp, on a vendetta against the criminal, Johnny Dollar. She eventually revealed (in ''The Green Hornet'' Vol. 2, #s 12 & 13, August & September 1992) that he had been an embezzling executive at the Swiss plant, whose actions she unwittingly began to expose. Consequently, he had murdered her fianc\u00e9 and his daughter in an attack that also caused the unknowingly pregnant Mishi, the main target, to miscarry.\n\nIn the No. 34, July 1994 issue of that run, she appeared in her \"Hornet's partner\" guise one additional time, as the masked Paul Reid attended a gangland meeting; the rules stated that each \"boss\" was allowed two \"boys.\" During this period, Hayashi became romantically involved with District Attorney Diana Reid, daughter of the original Hornet, who even thought for a while that she had conceived his child. In the final issue, Diana discussed their wedding plans with Mishi. In the last two issues, yet another Kato, a nephew to both of these named Kono, was brought in to allow the aging Hayashi to retire from crime-fighting, but the publisher's ceasing of operations prevented much of him being seen. The Bruce Lee-based Kato was also featured in two of his own spin-off miniseries, written by [[Mike Baron]]. The first had him defending a Chinese temple, where he had studied [[kung fu]], from the Communist government, while in the second he took the job of bodyguarding a heroin-addicted rock star. A third solo adventure, also by Baron, was announced and promoted first as another miniseries, then as a graphic novel (now subtitled \"Dragons in Eden\"), but was left unpublished when NOW folded. The line featured one other version of the character.\n\nThe three-issue mini-series ''The Green Hornet: Dark Tomorrow'' (June&ndash;August 1993) was set approximately one hundred years in the future, and had an Asian-American Green Hornet, real name Clayton Reid, who had been corrupted by power and truly became the crime boss he was supposed to only pretend to be, fighting a Caucasian Kato. Beyond the reversal of ethnicities, the latter added the claim that he and the future Hornet were cousins, and the art's depiction of this Hornet's unnamed paternal grandparents resembles Paul Reid and Mishi Kato. Although the future Kato is not further identified here, a later \"Reid/Kato Family Trees\" feature (in ''The Green Hornet'', Vol. 2, # 26, October 1993) gave him the first name Luke.\n\nThis comic book incarnation gave a degree of official status to a long-standing error about the character, that in his ''masked'' identity he is known as Kato. The name was restricted to his private persona in the original radio series, the two movie serials, and most of the television version (there were two slips in this last medium, one on the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' appearance, the other in the last filmed episode of the ''Hornet'' series itself, \"Invasion from Outer Space, Part 2\"; this story is well out of sync with the rest of the run, and the writer, director, and even the line producer are people with no other credits on the program). But the NOW comic version made a big point of having the masked assistants called Kato, with the woman at one early point telling the equally new Hornet during their first adventure, \"While I'm in this funky get-up, call me Kato. It's part of the tradition.\"<ref>''The Green Hornet'', Vol. 1, No. 7, May 1990, [[NOW Comics]], p. 7.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Kevin Smith]]'s 2010 revamp of the continuity, Kato is depicted, in modern times, as the elderly but still physically fit valet of the late Britt Reid, killed by a yakuza mobster going by the ''Black Hornet '' sobriquet.

This character has also appeared with the Green Hornet in film, television, book and comic book versions. Kato was the Hornet's assistant and has been played by a number of actors. On radio, Kato was initially played by [[Raymond Hayashi]], then [[Roland Parker (actor)|Roland Parker]] who had the role for most of the run, and in the later years Mickey Tolan and Paul Carnegie.<ref>[[Jim Harmon|Harmon, Jim]], ''Radio Mystery and Adventure and Its Appearances in Film, Television and Other Media'', [[McFarland & Company|McFarland & Company, Inc.]], 1992.</ref> [[Keye Luke]] took the role in the movie serials, and in the [[The Green Hornet (TV series)|television series]] he was portrayed by [[Bruce Lee]]. [[Jay Chou]]  played Kato in the 2011 [[The Green Hornet (2011 film)|Green Hornet film]].\n\n==Character history==\nKato was [[Britt Reid]]'s valet, who doubled as The Green Hornet's [[mask]]ed driver and partner to help him in his vigilante adventures, disguised as the activities of a racketeer and his chauffeur/[[bodyguard]]/enforcer. According to the storyline, years before the events depicted in the series, Britt Reid had saved Kato's life while traveling in the Far East. Depending on the version of the story, this prompted Kato to become Reid's assistant or friend.  In the anthology The Green Hornet Chronicles from [[Moonstone Books]], author [[Richard Dean Starr]]'s story \"Nothing Gold Can Stay: An Origin Story of Kato\" explores the character's background and how he ends up living in America, suggesting that Kato met Britt Reid on a later trip back to his homeland while in search of his mother.\n\n===Radio program and nationality===\n[[George W. Trendle]], the owner of radio station WXYZ in Michigan first created and produced \"The Green Hornet\" show in 1936, with the scripts being written by [[Fran Striker]]. The show became so popular it ran for nearly two decades and spun off at least two films. This was Trendle and Striker's second big radio hit; their first was \"The [[Lone Ranger]].\" \n\nIn the 1936 premiere of the radio program, Kato was presented as being Japanese. By 1939, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|invasion of China]] by the [[Empire of Japan]] made this bad for public relations, and from that year until 1945 \"Britt Reid's Japanese valet\" in the show's opening was then simply identified by the announcer as his \"faithful valet.\" {{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The first of [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s two movie serials, produced in 1939 but not released to theaters until early 1940, referred in passing to Kato being \"a [[Koreans|Korean]]\".  By 1941, Kato had begun to be referred to as [[Filipino people|Filipino]].<ref>radio episode \"Walkout for Profit\" ''The Green Hornet Collection'', Volume 2, Tape 1, Side B, Wireless, 1995 (original airdate: June 21, 1941, [[Blue Network]])).</ref>  A long-standing, but false, urban legend maintained that the switch from one to the other occurred immediately after the 1941 bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]]. In serials, Kato was played by Chinese-born [[Americans|American]] actor [[Keye Luke]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Float Like a Franchise, Sting Like a ...  |work= [[The New York Times]]|date=2011-01-07|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/movies/09hornet.html?_r=1&hpw|accessdate=2011-01-10|first=Franz|last=Lidz}}</ref> In the 2011 film, Kato (played by [[Jay Chou]]) tells Britt Reid that he was born in the Chinese city of [[Shanghai]]; Reid replies by saying that he \"love[s] Japan\".\n\n\n\n===Television series===\n{{Main|The Green Hornet (TV series)}}\nThe televised series of \"[[The Green Hornet]]\" was created and produced by William Dozier, the owner of Greenway Productions, for ABC. It ran from 1966 to 1967 and was then cancelled after that one season. Van Williams played the Green Hornet and [[Bruce Lee]] played [[Kato]]. Dozier was also the creator of the more popular \"[[Batman]]\" television series. Even though he had the Green Hornet and Kato appear on \"[[Batman]]\" three times, they never acquired a large audience.\n\n[[File:Kato (Bruce Lee).png|thumb|left|upright|Kato, as portrayed by [[Bruce Lee]] in the television series]]\nIt was due in part to [[Bruce Lee]]'s portrayal of this character, that the Green Hornet became more well known, and that the martial arts became more popular in the United States in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite news|title= Getting 'The Green Hornet' off the ground|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 23, 2010|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/23/entertainment/la-et-green-hornet-20100723/3|accessdate=September 13, 2010|first=Geoff|last=Boucher}}</ref> Indeed, Lee refused to follow the American director's expectation of fisticuff fights and insisted he be allowed to use his martial arts skills. <ref>\"Bruce Lee Steals the Show in 'The Green Hornet'\" American Heritage Center Blog https://ahcwyo.org/2020/03/16/bruce-lee-steals-the-show-in-the-green-hornet/</ref> They became so popular with the audience that Van Williams, who played the Green Hornet, asked to be taught some moves. In a crossover episode of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' from the same time and companies, Kato had a battle with [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] that ended in a draw (the same thing happened simultaneously with their senior partners). This was in part because Lee refused to participate in a fight that showed Asian-style martial arts being defeated; the original script had the Green Hornet and Kato being beaten by Batman and Robin. The popular impression Lee made at the time is demonstrated by one of the TV series tie-in coloring books produced by Watkins & Strathmore. It is titled ''Kato's Revenge Featuring the Green Hornet''.<ref>Bonnet, Jean Pierre, \"The Buzz Word\" (letter to the editor), ''The Green Hornet'', Vol. 2, # 18, February 1993, [[NOW Comics]].</ref> ''The Green Hornet'''s success in Hong Kong, where it was popularly known as ''The Kato Show'', led to Lee starring in the [[Bruce Lee filmography|feature film]]s that would make him a pop culture icon. This show launched [[Bruce Lee]]'s adult television and film career. \n\nIn the TV series Kato (portrayed by [[Bruce Lee]]) is not at all a mechanic but a professional servant, a highly skilled driver, and a master of the art of war. In all other versions of the story he is also a mechanic, with the creations of both the special automobile, the Black Beauty, and the Hornet's trademark sleeping gas and the gun that delivered it attributed to him. In the television series he also became an expert in martial arts, which was implied in the first film serial with his use of a tranquilizing [[Knifehand strike|\"chop\"]] to the back of a thug's neck.\n\n\n===Comic book adaptations===\nAll ''Green Hornet'' comic book adaptations have included Kato. These were produced by [[Helnit]] (later [[Holyoke Publishing|Holyoke]]), [[Harvey Comics|Harvey]], [[Dell Comics|Dell]] and, tied into the television version, [[Gold Key Comics|Gold Key]]. Beginning in [[1989 in comics|1989]] one, published by [[NOW Comics]], established a continuity between the different versions of the story. In this comic, the TV/Bruce Lee version of Kato was the son of the Kato from the radio stories, and had the given name Hayashi as an homage to the character's first radio actor.<ref>[[Will Murray (writer)|Murray, Will]], \"Where Hornets Swarm,\" ''[[Comics Scene (magazine)|Comics Scene]]'', No. 9, October 1989, [[Starlog|Starlog Communications International, Inc.]], p.42.</ref>\n\nThe comic also established a new Kato, a much younger half-sister of the television-based character, Mishi. This female Kato also insisted on being treated as the Hornet's full partner rather than a sidekick. However, the Green Hornet, Inc., soon withdrew approval and this character was replaced with the 1960s version after Vol. 1, #10.<ref>Piron, Diane, \"The Buzz Word\" (letter column), ''The Green Hornet'', Vol. 1, No. 13, November 1990.</ref> Her removal was explained by having the Kato family company, Nippon Today, needing her automotive designing services at its Zurich, Switzerland facility. Mishi would return in Volume 2, appearing sporadically in the new costumed identity of the Crimson Wasp, on a vendetta against the criminal, Johnny Dollar. She eventually revealed (in ''The Green Hornet'' Vol. 2, #s 12 & 13, August & September 1992) that he had been an embezzling executive at the Swiss plant, whose actions she unwittingly began to expose. Consequently, he had murdered her fianc\u00e9 and his daughter in an attack that also caused the unknowingly pregnant Mishi, the main target, to miscarry.\n\nIn the No. 34, July 1994 issue of that run, she appeared in her \"Hornet's partner\" guise one additional time, as the masked Paul Reid attended a gangland meeting; the rules stated that each \"boss\" was allowed two \"boys.\" During this period, Hayashi became romantically involved with District Attorney Diana Reid, daughter of the original Hornet, who even thought for a while that she had conceived his child. In the final issue, Diana discussed their wedding plans with Mishi. In the last two issues, yet another Kato, a nephew to both of these named Kono, was brought in to allow the aging Hayashi to retire from crime-fighting, but the publisher's ceasing of operations prevented much of him being seen. The Bruce Lee-based Kato was also featured in two of his own spin-off miniseries, written by [[Mike Baron]]. The first had him defending a Chinese temple, where he had studied [[kung fu]], from the Communist government, while in the second he took the job of bodyguarding a heroin-addicted rock star. A third solo adventure, also by Baron, was announced and promoted first as another miniseries, then as a graphic novel (now subtitled \"Dragons in Eden\"), but was left unpublished when NOW folded. The line featured one other version of the character.\n\nThe three-issue mini-series ''The Green Hornet: Dark Tomorrow'' (June&ndash;August 1993) was set approximately one hundred years in the future, and had an Asian-American Green Hornet, real name Clayton Reid, who had been corrupted by power and truly became the crime boss he was supposed to only pretend to be, fighting a Caucasian Kato. Beyond the reversal of ethnicities, the latter added the claim that he and the future Hornet were cousins, and the art's depiction of this Hornet's unnamed paternal grandparents resembles Paul Reid and Mishi Kato. Although the future Kato is not further identified here, a later \"Reid/Kato Family Trees\" feature (in ''The Green Hornet'', Vol. 2, # 26, October 1993) gave him the first name Luke.\n\nThis comic book incarnation gave a degree of official status to a long-standing error about the character, that in his ''masked'' identity he is known as Kato. The name was restricted to his private persona in the original radio series, the two movie serials, and most of the television version (there were two slips in this last medium, one on the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' appearance, the other in the last filmed episode of the ''Hornet'' series itself, \"Invasion from Outer Space, Part 2\"; this story is well out of sync with the rest of the run, and the writer, director, and even the line producer are people with no other credits on the program). But the NOW comic version made a big point of having the masked assistants called Kato, with the woman at one early point telling the equally new Hornet during their first adventure, \"While I'm in this funky get-up, call me Kato. It's part of the tradition.\"<ref>''The Green Hornet'', Vol. 1, No. 7, May 1990, [[NOW Comics]], p. 7.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Kevin Smith]]'s 2010 revamp of the continuity, Kato is depicted, in modern times, as the elderly but still physically fit valet of the late Britt Reid, killed by a yakuza mobster going by the ''Black Hornet '' sobriquet. The elder Kato, in this version a Japanese forced to act Filipino to avoid the suspicions and the racist charges against his people during WWII, retires his identity along with Britt Reid, and both men decide to devote themselves to their families, respectively raising their offspring Britt Reid Jr. and Mulan Kato.\n\nAfter Britt Reid's death, Kato returns in America with Mulan, now the second Kato, to act out the ''Secret Testament'' of Britt Reid Sr., who wished, in the event of his death, Kato to destroy every Green Hornet paraphernalia still in his possession and whisk Britt Reid Jr. to Japan, for his safety. However both offspring refuse Reid's and Kato's will: Mulan Kato, now clad in a close variation of her father's original outfit, storms off to confront the Yakuza, and Britt Reid Jr. manages to steal one of the Green Hornet costumes to help her, despite having little training on his own.<ref>''Green Hornet'' No. 3 (2010)</ref>\n\nAs the new Kato, Mulan is a strong, physically fit, silent warrior woman, able to perform amazing feats with uncanny strength and precision.<ref>''Green Hornet'' No. 2 (2010)</ref>  Despite having been shown, in her late teens, as a peppy, lively, cheery ''social butterfly'',<ref>''Kato'' No. 1 (2010)</ref> the adult Mulan Kato is a darker, brooding character who never speaks (despite physically able to do so, Mulan prefers speaking as little as she can to prevent the much talkative Britt Reid Jr., and seemingly everyone else, from talking back<ref>''Kato'' No. 5 (2010)</ref>) and shows little, if no interest at all, for any form of socialization, a thing that seems to distress the second Green Hornet, every bit the suave socialite his father was.\n\nIn addition, the limited series ''Green Hornet: Parallel Lives'' by writer Jai Nitz, will serve as a prequel to the [[The Green Hornet (2011 film)|2011 Green Hornet film]], exploring the backstory for the film's version of Kato.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=26322 |title=Nitz Separates \"Green Hornet: Parallel Lives\" |date=May 20, 2010|first=Steve|last=Sunu|work=Comic Book Resources |accessdate=December 25, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, an eight-issue miniseries called ''Masks'' brought together famous heroes from the pulp era.

Kato's martial art skills in this version of the series are so exceptional that he claims that time literally slows down for him when he gets an adrenaline rush in a dangerous situation, as well as his traditional role as mechanic and driver. Although he and Britt have a temporary falling-out when they argue over their respective importance to the \"Green Hornet\" concept- Kato acting as the actual action man of the Hornet while Britt is the public face as Kato is too fast for any cameras to see him- they patch up their differences in time to destroy the gang of crime lord Chudnofsky.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.comics.org/search.lasso?type=title&query=Kato+of+the+Green+Hornet&sort=chrono&Submit=Search ''Kato of the Green Hornet''] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]\n* \"[http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/radio/kato.asp Turning Japanese].\" ''[[Snopes]]''.

It may also extend to neighbouring countries or regions that are populated by peoples over which Russia ruled (e.g. [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] in [[Iran]]), or peoples which are closely related to them due to linguistic, ethnic or religious ties. Historically, Russia has pursued all of these avenues; examples include the [[Panslavism]] movement to put all of the [[Balkans]] (where there exists Slavic and [[Eastern Orthodox]] majorities) under Russian hegemony; the [[Moscow, third Rome|Third Rome]] philosophy, which focused on re-claiming the former [[Byzantine Empire]] regions (in particular the warm winter port of [[Constantinople]], today [[Istanbul]]), and in addition establishing a hegemony over [[Greater Armenia (political concept)|Greater Armenia]] and the [[Holy Land]] ([[Lebanon]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] etc.). Simultaneously, there were ambitions to continue expansion into [[Persia]] and even [[India]] (see [[The Great Game]]). The Russian Empire also planned to force [[Qing Dynasty|Qing China]] to cede [[Xinjiang]], [[Manchuria]], [[Mongolia|Outer Mongolia]], and [[Korea]]. While the [[Russo-Japanese War]] ended most of these prospects, the Soviet Union would eventually create a sphere of influence in this area in the form of the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] and the [[Tuvan People's Republic]]. Finally, in [[Russian America]], Russia held claims extending from the [[Aleutian Islands]] to northern [[California]], but these plans were cancelled after Alaska [[Alaska Purchase|was sold to the United States]] in 1867.\n* The intermediate sense includes some or all of the independent countries and/or territories that made up the historical Russian borders. These may include [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], eastern [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], the [[Baltic states]], and [[Finland]] in Europe, [[Azerbaijan]], [[Armenia]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the [[Caucasus]], and [[Kazakhstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] in [[Central Asia]]. Some narrower definitions include only the pro-Russian breakaway states of [[Abkhazia]] (Georgia), [[South Ossetia]] (Georgia), and [[Transnistria]] (Moldova), as well as [[Kars Oblast]] in Turkey and [[Batum Oblast]] partly in Turkey also ([[Ardahan Province]]) and [[Adjara]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].\n* The narrow sense of Russian irredentism focuses only on regions that are populated by [[Russians|ethnic Russians]] that are outside the Russian Federation, such as: [[Narva]] in [[Estonia]]; lands around [[Daugavpils]] and [[Riga]] in [[Latvia]]; [[Sloboda Ukraine]], [[Novorossiya]], and [[Crimea]] from Ukraine (the latter of which has ''de facto'' joined the Federation<ref>{{cite journal|first=Vladimir |last=Socor |author-link=Vladimir Socor |url=http://www.jamestown.org/regions/centralasia/single/?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=42144&tx_ttnews[backPid]=53&cHash=377ed0c543440239db55d887478f2c53#.VyAwZ3rbucw |title=Putin's Crimea Speech: A Manifesto of Greater-Russia Irredentism |journal=Eurasia Daily Monitor |volume=11 |issue=56 |date=25 March 2014 |accessdate=27 April 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427052607/http://www.jamestown.org/programs/edm/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=42144&cHash=7d7b25bd2616f914691c6f7e3b00c3eb |archivedate=27 April 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Saideman|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/why-crimea-is-likely-the-limit-of-greater-russia/article17542819/|title=Why Crimea is likely the limit of Greater Russia|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=18 March 2014|accessdate=27 April 2016}}</ref>); [[Gagra district]] in Georgia (also claimed by [[Abkhazia]]); and lands between the Russian border and the rivers of [[Ural River|Ural]] and [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] in [[Kazakhstan]], as well as parts of [[Semirechye]].\n\n====Historical and fringe disputes====\nMany fringe and opposition groups in various countries maintain their own set of territorial claims, which are given below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"130\" | State\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"150\" | Claimed area\n!

It may also extend to neighbouring countries or regions that are populated by peoples over which Russia ruled (e.g. [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] in [[Iran]]), or peoples which are closely related to them due to linguistic, ethnic or religious ties. Historically, Russia has pursued all of these avenues; examples include the [[Panslavism]] movement to put all of the [[Balkans]] (where there exists Slavic and [[Eastern Orthodox]] majorities) under Russian hegemony; the [[Moscow, third Rome|Third Rome]] philosophy, which focused on re-claiming the former [[Byzantine Empire]] regions (in particular the warm winter port of [[Constantinople]], today [[Istanbul]]), and in addition establishing a hegemony over [[Greater Armenia (political concept)|Greater Armenia]] and the [[Holy Land]] ([[Lebanon]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] etc.). Simultaneously, there were ambitions to continue expansion into [[Persia]] and even [[India]] (see [[The Great Game]]). The Russian Empire also planned to force [[Qing Dynasty|Qing China]] to cede [[Xinjiang]], [[Manchuria]], [[Mongolia|Outer Mongolia]], and [[Korea]]. While the [[Russo-Japanese War]] ended most of these prospects, the Soviet Union would eventually create a sphere of influence in this area in the form of the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] and the [[Tuvan People's Republic]]. Finally, in [[Russian America]], Russia held claims extending from the [[Aleutian Islands]] to northern [[California]], but these plans were cancelled after Alaska [[Alaska Purchase|was sold to the United States]] in 1867.\n* The intermediate sense includes some or all of the independent countries and/or territories that made up the historical Russian borders. These may include [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], eastern [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], the [[Baltic states]], and [[Finland]] in Europe, [[Azerbaijan]], [[Armenia]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the [[Caucasus]], and [[Kazakhstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] in [[Central Asia]]. Some narrower definitions include only the pro-Russian breakaway states of [[Abkhazia]] (Georgia), [[South Ossetia]] (Georgia), and [[Transnistria]] (Moldova), as well as [[Kars Oblast]] in Turkey and [[Batum Oblast]] partly in Turkey also ([[Ardahan Province]]) and [[Adjara]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].\n* The narrow sense of Russian irredentism focuses only on regions that are populated by [[Russians|ethnic Russians]] that are outside the Russian Federation, such as: [[Narva]] in [[Estonia]]; lands around [[Daugavpils]] and [[Riga]] in [[Latvia]]; [[Sloboda Ukraine]], [[Novorossiya]], and [[Crimea]] from Ukraine (the latter of which has ''de facto'' joined the Federation<ref>{{cite journal|first=Vladimir |last=Socor |author-link=Vladimir Socor |url=http://www.jamestown.org/regions/centralasia/single/?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=42144&tx_ttnews[backPid]=53&cHash=377ed0c543440239db55d887478f2c53#.VyAwZ3rbucw |title=Putin's Crimea Speech: A Manifesto of Greater-Russia Irredentism |journal=Eurasia Daily Monitor |volume=11 |issue=56 |date=25 March 2014 |accessdate=27 April 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427052607/http://www.jamestown.org/programs/edm/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=42144&cHash=7d7b25bd2616f914691c6f7e3b00c3eb |archivedate=27 April 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Saideman|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/why-crimea-is-likely-the-limit-of-greater-russia/article17542819/|title=Why Crimea is likely the limit of Greater Russia|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=18 March 2014|accessdate=27 April 2016}}</ref>); [[Gagra district]] in Georgia (also claimed by [[Abkhazia]]); and lands between the Russian border and the rivers of [[Ural River|Ural]] and [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] in [[Kazakhstan]], as well as parts of [[Semirechye]].\n\n====Historical and fringe disputes====\nMany fringe and opposition groups in various countries maintain their own set of territorial claims, which are given below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"130\" | State\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"150\" | Claimed area\n!

The series aired on [[TVB Jade]] from 27 October to 21 November 1997.\n\n==Plot==\nAu Chi-lap ([[Gordon Lam]]) is an optimistic magazine journalist who lives a simple, yet happy life with his parents and stepsister ([[Miriam Yeung]]). His life changes when he becomes embroiled in a jewelry theft case. Chan Shui-cheng ([[Bowie Lam]]), a fellow townsman of the Au family, arrives in [[Hong Kong]] to live with the Aus. Shui-cheng, who worked as an assistant to a scientist in [[Hunan]], insists the jewelry theft is an invisible person who drank a potion created by the scientist. Shui-cheng investigates this with the help from San Hiu-lam ([[Mariane Chan]]), the Aus' new neighbor who is a well-meaning, ambitious but clumsy beat cop. Chi-lap also joins in as he does not believe Shui-cheng's bizarre claims and thinks the latter is trying to con Hiu-lam. \n\nNot long after, Chi-lap is framed by the chief editor of a rival magazine company, Victor Tsui ([[Kenneth Chan Kai-tai|Kenneth Chan]]) for fabricating false news, which causes his employer to face criminal charges. When Chi-lap finds out that Shui-cheng's claims about invisibility were true, he drinks a bottle of the potion kept by Shui-cheng achieves invisibility in order to gather evidence against Victor and save his magazine company. \n\nLater, Chi-lap also encounters and works with Victor's girlfriend, Wing Cheuk ([[Astrid Chan]]), whom he was a never a fan of. One time when they were on a job to interview a [[Triad (organized crime)|triad]] boss in [[Huidong County, Guangdong]], Chi-lap uses his invisibility to save Wing from an attack from the triads which left her temporary blind, so she did not find out about this secret.

{"title_page": "Coastal coal-carrying trade of New South Wales", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\nThe '''Coastal coal-carrying trade of New South Wales''' involved the shipping of coal\u2014mainly for local consumption but also for export or coal bunkering\u2014by sea to Sydney from the northern and southern coal fields of [[New South Wales]]. It took place in the 19th and 20th Centuries. It should not be confused with the export coal trade, which still exists today. There was also an interstate trade, carrying coal and coke to other Australian states that did not have local sources of black coal.\n\nCoal was found to the north and south of Sydney in the last years of the 18th-Century by colonial settlers. Coal seams run under Sydney but at great depth and mining these seams proved impractical. As Sydney grew in size as a city and as a major port, coal was needed for steamships, town gas production and other industrial uses.\n\nSmall ships\u2014colloquially called '[[sixty-miler]]s'\u2014carried coal to Sydney from coal ports that were established on the northern and southern coalfields of New South Wales. The coastal trade was well established by the time Sydney was first linked to the coalfields by railways. Significant customers for coal were situated on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour, the Parramatta River, and to a lesser extent Botany Bay. Steamships using Sydney loaded bunker coal there.\n\nDuring the heyday of the coastal trade, Sydney was dependent upon a constant supply of coal arriving by sea, particularly for the production of town gas and for bunkering operations. As the uses of coal declined, so did the coastal trade in the last three decades of the 20th-Century. It ended finally, around the turn of the 21st-Century, and is now largely forgotten. Few remnants of the once extensive coastal coal-carrying trade exist today.\n\n== Discovery of coal by colonists in New South Wales ==\nCoal was used as a fuel by the [[Awabakal]] people, the original inhabitants and traditional owners of what is now Lake Macquarie and Newcastle. Their word for coal was \"nikkin\". Evidence of coal use has been found in beach and dune [[middens]], on Lake Macquarie at [[Swansea Heads]] and Ham's Beach, and on the Central Coast at Mooney Beach.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.coalandcommunity.com/coal-and-the-aboriginal-people.php|title=The use of coal by Aboriginal people|website=www.coalandcommunity.com|access-date=1 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nA group of escaped convicts led by a married couple [[William Bryant (convict)|William]] and [[Mary Bryant]] were the first Europeans to find and use Australian coal, at the end of March 1791. They found \u2018fine burning coal\u2019 near a \u2018little creek\u2019 with [[Livistona australis|cabbage tree palms]] \u2018about 2 degrees\u2019 north of Sydney, 'after two days sailing'.

William Bryant also wrote an account that is now lost but [[William Bligh]]\u2014later a governor of New South Wales\u2014saw it, when he visited Kupang in 1792. Bligh made a summary of Bryant's account in his log and quoted him as saying, \"Walking along shore towards the entrance of the Creek we found several large pieces of Coal\u2014seeing so many pieces we thought it was not unlikely to find a Mine, and searching about a little, we found a place where we picked up with an Ax as good Coals as any in England\u2014took some to the fire and they burned exceedingly well\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1558725/1/Memorandoms-by-James-Martin.pdf|title=Memorandoms by James Martin - An astonishing escape from early New South Wales|last=Causer|first=Tim|publisher=UCL Press|year=2017|isbn=9781911576815|location=|pages=24, 25, 82, 83, 130, 131}}</ref>  It is likely that the location was near the entrance to [[Glenrock Lagoon#History|Glenrock Lagoon]], where coal is exposed in the sea cliff and which was later the site of the Burwood Colliery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geomaps.com.au/scripts/glenrockstate.php|title=Glenrock State Recreation Area - Mining heritage and Dudley Beach fossilised forest|website=www.geomaps.com.au|access-date=19 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nSurvivors of the wreck of the [[Sydney Cove (1796 ship)|''Sydney Cove'']] reported seeing coal south of Sydney, after completing their 700&nbsp;km trek along the coast in May 1797.

That proved true; an immense coal resource existed in New South Wales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://d28rz98at9flks.cloudfront.net/9178/Rec1953_111.pdf|title=The Coal Resources of New South Wales (Draft)|last=Burton|first=G.M.|date=1953|publisher=Department of National Development, Bureau of Mineral Resources Geology and Geophysics.}}</ref>  Coal is still being mined within the [[Sydney Basin]] more than two centuries later. Some individual mines had been worked for well over a century. Indeed, it is only the more recent increased rate of extraction\u2014for the export market\u2014that will see the exhaustion of commercially viable reserves around the middle of the 21st-Century.\n\n== Reasons for the trade ==\n=== Coal for Sydney ===\nCoal was needed in Sydney to feed the [[Gasworks|production of town gas]] (from 1841 to 1971), as bunker coal for steamships, and as fuel for industrial and hospital heating boilers. Brickworks were a significant user of coal as a fuel. In the C19th and very early C20th, there was also some demand for coal as a fuel for domestic heating. Some coal also was trans-shipped and exported from Sydney.\n\nCoal seams extend under Sydney but the huge depth of these seams has resulted in only [[Balmain Colliery|very limited mining activity in Sydney]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/109307/balmains-own-coal-mine.pdf|title=Balmain's own coal mine|last=NSW Dept of Primary Industry|first=Primefacts|date=February 2007}}</ref> The coal seams of the [[Sydney Basin]] outcrop to the north, south and west of Sydney. The Metropolitan Colliery, 45&nbsp;km south of Sydney at [[Helensburgh, New South Wales|Helensburgh]], is the closest commercially viable coal mine.\n\nGiven the short distances involved, it is not immediately obvious why coal would be carried to Sydney by sea. Not all coal consumed in Sydney arrived by ship; the railways also carried coal to Sydney. However, the main railway lines from Sydney to the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|north]] and [[South Coast Line|south]] were not completed until the late 1880s. By that time, some mines were already well established and connected to nearby ports by local rail lines, the shipping trade was well established, and many major customers already had facilities on the waterfront of the natural port of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and were without a rail siding. Some mines had been designed to ship coal by sea only, for example [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]] (up to 1910) and the [[Wallarah Colliery]] at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. Most of the local rail lines to the mines were privately owned and used rolling stock that was not to the standards expected of main line rail operations\u2014for example wagons without air brakes\u2014and operation over government-owned lines was restricted to specific lines and not allowed on others.\n\nCoal bunkering of steamships in Sydney Harbour was a natural fit for the coastal coal trade. Sixty-milers could moor alongside a steamship and directly transfer coal to the ship's bunkers.<ref name=\":14\" /> After 1920, coal could be off-loaded at the purpose-built bunkering facility, the Ball's Head Coal Loader.<ref name=\":9\" /> Coal bunkering also took place at a 'coal wharf' at Pyrmont.<ref name=\":31\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article246109565|title=SONOMA SAILS|date=11 April 1927|work=Daily Telegraph (Sydney, NSW : 1883 - 1930)|access-date=7 March 2019|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Government Railways]] were large users of coal. But once the railway from Sydney reached the western coal-fields in 1869 and later the other coal fields, they had no need for coal carried in ships.\n\nFour of the electrical power stations in Sydney\u2014[[Bunnerong Power Station|Bunnerong]] on Botany Bay, and [[White Bay Power Station|White Bay]], [[Pyrmont Power Station|Pyrmont]] and [[Ultimo Power Station|Ultimo]] on Sydney Harbour\u2014were supplied with coal by rail. All these power stations were situated close to the waterfront but that was to obtain cooling water not port access.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article146156281|title=THE WONDERS OF BUNNERONG|date=6 April 1932|work=Australian Worker (Sydney, NSW : 1913 - 1950)|access-date=7 August 2018|pages=18}}</ref> Two of the power stations\u2014Ultimo and White Bay\u2014initially were operated by the [[New South Wales Government Railways|railways]] and all the power stations in Sydney were built after the rail connections from the coalfields to Sydney were completed.

Its coal was landed from barges at the waterfront until 1965 <ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/balmain_power_station|title=Balmain Power Station {{!}} The Dictionary of Sydney|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|language=en|access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref> and so it seems likely that some or all of the coal for the [[Balmain Power Station]] came by sea.\n\n=== Coal and coke for the other states ===\nIn parallel to the coastal trade to Sydney, there was an interstate coastal trade in coal and coke from the same ports to other Australian states, particularly Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania where black coal was needed for steamship coal bunkering, rail transport and industrial purposes and coke was needed for smelting ores.\n\n== Ships  ==\n[[File:Sixty-miler.jpg|thumb|A \"sixty-miler\" enters Newcastle Harbour in 1923.|alt=|258x258px]]\n\n=== The \u2018sixty-milers\u2019 ===\n{{Main|Sixty-miler}}\n\nCoal was carried to Sydney in ships known as \u2018sixty-milers\u2019. The name refers to the approximate distance by sea\u2014in nautical miles\u2014from the Hunter River to Sydney.\n\nThe heyday of the 'sixty-milers' was from around 1880 to the 1960s. In 1919, a Royal Commission identified twenty-nine ships engaged in the coastal coal-carrying trade.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|title=Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Design, Construction, Management, Equipment, Manning, Leading, Navigation and Running of the Vessels Engaged in the Coastal Coal-carrying Trade in New South Wales and into the Cause or Causes of the Loss of the Colliers Undola, Myola and Tuggerah.|last=Royal Commission|publisher=NSW Government Printer|year=1920|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=1 & 2}}</ref>\n\n=== The Interstate ships ===\nThere was almost no overlap in the ships used in the two coastal coal trades.

Owners of the 'sixty-milers', during this period, most typically were coal-mines (such as Coalcliff Colliery and Wallarah Colliery), or coal-shippers or merchants (such as Scott, Fell and Company, G.S.Yuill & Co. ),<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

Faculty of Education.|isbn=0864180020|location=[Wollongong]|oclc=27593592}}</ref>  The southern coalfield collieries (Coalcliff Collieries, etc.) owned their own ships but most were chartered to the Southern Coal Owner's Agency, which operated the ships. Later companies that both owned coal mines and were also coal merchants (such as R.W.Miller and [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith Ltd]]) owned ships and ownership became more concentrated.\n\nIn the later years of the trade, one of the dominant owners was R.W. Miller<ref>{{Citation|last=Atchison|first=John|title=Miller, Robert William (1879\u20131958)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/miller-robert-william-7588|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref> and its successor companies. However, due to company takeovers and cross-ownership between R.W. Miller, Howard Smith Limited and Coal and Allied Industries, it is somewhat difficult to track ownership of vessels and loading assets of these firms. In 1989, [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith]] took full ownership of R.W.Miller. Another dominant owner in the later years of the trade was the Melbourne shipping company [[McIlwraith McEachern Limited|McIlwraith McEachern]], owners of the sixty-milers whose names included 'Bank'  (''Mortlake Bank'', etc.) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flotilla-australia.com/mcmc.htm|title=FLOTILLA AUSTRALIA|website=www.flotilla-australia.com|access-date=17 November 2018}}</ref> Ownership was sometimes difficult to follow; the ''Hexham Bank'' may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter to that company from its actual owners [[McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co|McIlwraith McEacharn]]. Ships of course were bought and sold and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners; sometimes the change in ownership also resulted in the ship's name changing, such as when the ''Corrimal'' became the ''Ayrfield''.\n\nIn contrast to the 'sixty-milers', the owners of the interstate coastal ships were usually more traditional ship-owners, some of whom specialised in carrying coal and coke.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Coal ports & operations ==\n\n=== Northern Coalfields \u2014 Hunter Valley & Lake Macquarie Region ===\nCoal from the northern coalfields was loaded at [[Hexham, New South Wales#Shipping|Hexham]] on the Hunter River, [[Carrington, New South Wales|Carrington]] (The Basin, The Dyke) near [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], on Lake Macquarie, and at the ocean jetty at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. In the early years of the trade, coal was loaded at Newcastle itself, on the southern bank of the Hunter River, at the river port of [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]], and at a wharf at Reid's Mistake at [[Swansea Heads, New South Wales|Swansea Heads]].\n\nThe coalfields to the north of Sydney had the advantage that the Hunter River and its estuary, while not ideal, could be used as a port. Mining commenced on the northern fields first. The first coal mines were initially operated by the government using convict labour. Sporadic mining operations started around what is now Newcastle and, in 1799, a cargo of coal was shipped to Bengal aboard the ''Hunter''. The first \u2018permanent\u2019 mine at Newcastle was opened in 1804.\n\nWhen Newcastle ceased to be a penal colony in 1821, the government continued to operate the mines. [[John Bigge|Commissioner Bigge]] had recommended that the mines be given over to private operation. In 1828, there was an agreement struck between the Secretary of State for colonies and the [[Australian Agricultural Company]] that made [[Australian Agricultural Company#Short-lived coal monopoly & providing land access: disputes with James Mitchell|coal mining a monopoly of that company]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

(Photographer: Ralph Snowball)]]The monopoly was broken when challenged in 1847 by the [[J & A Brown|Brown family]], who began mining coal at Maitland and using the river port of Morpeth and undercut the price of coal mined by the AAC. Coal was accessible in many places throughout the Hunter Valley and on both the eastern and western shores of Lake Macquarie. Once the monopoly was broken, many mines were soon in operation throughout the northern coalfields.\nAt the end of the C19th, the four most important companies on the northern field were the [[Australian Agricultural Company]], [[J & A Brown]], Newcastle Wallsend and Scottish Australian ([[Lambton, New South Wales#Colliery|Lambton Colliery]]). Of these, only the Scottish Australian was not a member of the Associated Northern Collieries. This was essentially a cartel that divided production as quotas for each of the participating colliery owners. There was a monetary mechanism under which collieries selling above their quota compensated those selling under their quota. To avoid companies just leaving coal in the ground, quotas were adjusted based on actual sales for the previous year. The arrangement was known as \"the Vend\" and operated for most of the years between 1872 and 1893, when it collapsed due to competition in the export market.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

The lugs at the top were used to lift the removable hopper out of the frame by crane.|alt=|260x260px]]\n\nMany collieries on the northern coalfield of NSW were named after collieries in the United Kingdom. Other names referenced the coal seam being mined and that confused the locality and identity of the mine further. With changes of ownership, mine names often changed and sometimes names associated with good-quality coal were moved to completely different collieries.\n\nMost mines of the northern coalfields were connected to the ports at Hexham and Carrington by an extensive network of railway lines; some were [[New South Wales Government Railways|government lines]] and others were privately owned. Coal was loaded into four-wheel wagons owned by the mining companies. The type of four-wheel wagon used consisted of a frame with wheels and a removable wooden hopper. Trains of wagons were hauled to the port, where the removable hoppers were lifted out of the frame by a crane and dumped by opening the bottom of the hopper. They were known as 'non-air' wagons because they did not have air-brakes.\n\nAt their peak, there were 13,000 of these \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons in service, belonging to around sixty operators. Larger modern bogie wagons were introduced in the 1960s and \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons were banned from Port Waratah in 1974 but continued to be used to bring coal to Hexham. There were still 3,000 in use in 1975 and 900 when the [[Richmond Vale railway line|Richmond Vale Railway]] closed in September 1987. 'Non-air' wagons came in different capacities between 7 and 12.5 tons.

Sailing ships using the old port of Newcastle tipped [[Ballast#History|stone ballast]] in the area and, with other reclamation work, the line of The Dyke was created by 1861. The Dyke had the effect of constraining the channel of the Hunter River, so that the natural flow and tidal movement of the river tended to scour sediments from the river floor and maintain a deep-water port. Land was reclaimed behind the original Dyke, which became the large rail-yard for the port. Coal was loaded at The Dyke from 1878.\n\nThe Basin is an artificial harbour, to the west of The Dyke, which opens into the junction of Throsby Creek and the Hunter River. It was created by dredging and completed in 1888. The Basin was also used to load coal.\n\nThe Carrington coal-loaders used twelve hydraulic cranes powered by water under pressure supplied from a [[Carrington Pump House|pumphouse]] nearby. There were also three steam cranes. In 1890, this government-operated facility was capable of loading a total of 12,000 tons per day.

Coal in the southern coalfields was generally more easily won than in the northern field. The coal outcropped in sea cliffs or part way up the [[Illawarra escarpment|Illawarra Escarpment]] and adit mining was feasible. [[Adit]]s were less costly to construct and operate than the shafts and sloping drifts of the northern coalfields. The southern coalfields could be worked profitably, if the problem of shipping could be solved. The absence of a suitable port held back development of the southern mines, until around 1849 when the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] mine opened.\n\nCoal from the southern coal fields, at various times, was loaded at [[Wollongong Harbour Precinct|Wollongong Harbour]] and [[Port Kembla (seaport)#History of the Port|Port Kembla]] and at the ocean jetty ports: [[Bellambi, New South Wales|Bellambi]]; [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]]; Hicks Point at [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]]; and [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Sandon Point, Bulli]].

At Wollongong Harbour only, some loading was done by crane using wagons with removable hoppers, similar in concept to the ones used in the northern coalfields. After 1915, four-wheel bottom dump wagons were used to bring coal to the new No.1 Jetty at Port Kembla, via an unloading rail loop and dump station.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=The History and Development of Port Kembla - Paper prepared for presentation to the Engineering Conference of the Institute of Engineers Australia (30 March 1938).|last=Spooner|first=E.S|publisher=NSW Department of Public Works|year=1938|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=7}}</ref> This bottom-dumping operation was similar in concept to the coal-handling practice of today.\n\nUnlike the northern fields, mines of the southern coalfield were usually named after a locality or geographical feature and their names rarely changed over their lifetime. The number of mines was also less and the mines tended to have longer lives.\n\nMost of the southern coalfield mines were members of the Southern Coal Owners' Agency, which had as one of its aims 'prevention of ruinous competition'. It was a cartel-like organisation, controlling production volume, prices, and transport costs, but only for the southern coalfields. It lasted from 1893 to 1950, being renewed every few years by agreement. Although the collieries that were members owned 'sixty-miler' ships, those ships were chartered by the Agency. The Agency managed the operations of the ships and paid the owner a monthly fee based on each ship's capacity. Although the operation of the ships may not have been profitable, the colleries seem to have seen controlling the shipping of their coal as important to ensure reliable delivery, and as a necessary cost. Collieries received an initial low payment upon delivery of their coal to a customer but also later received a share of the actual profits from all sales, in proportion to their market share.<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

On Belmore Basin, there were four coal staithes on the western side of the basin and two steam cranes on the eastern side. Loading at the 'Tee Wharf' was by a single steam crane. The 'Tee-Wharf' was somewhat exposed to weather from the north and north-east; the existing northern breakwater was not built until 1966-67.\n\nThe port was connected to the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] and [[Mount Pleasant, New South Wales|Mt Pleasant]] Collieries by rail lines operated by the respective collieries. Originally these were horse-drawn but later used steam locomotives.\n\nFrom 1875 to 1890, there was a cokeworks, which converted unsaleable fines to [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], some of which was loaded at the port for Sydney.\n\nBy 1927, there was only one coal staith in operation at Wollongong.

It took place in the 19th and 20th Centuries. It should not be confused with the export coal trade, which still exists today. There was also an interstate trade, carrying coal and coke to other Australian states that did not have local sources of black coal.\n\nCoal was found to the north and south of Sydney in the last years of the 18th-Century by colonial settlers. Coal seams run under Sydney but at great depth and mining these seams proved impractical. As Sydney grew in size as a city and as a major port, coal was needed for steamships, town gas production and other industrial uses.\n\nSmall ships\u2014colloquially called '[[sixty-miler]]s'\u2014carried coal to Sydney from coal ports that were established on the northern and southern coalfields of New South Wales. The coastal trade was well established by the time Sydney was first linked to the coalfields by railways. Significant customers for coal were situated on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour, the Parramatta River, and to a lesser extent Botany Bay. Steamships using Sydney loaded bunker coal there.\n\nDuring the heyday of the coastal trade, Sydney was dependent upon a constant supply of coal arriving by sea, particularly for the production of town gas and for bunkering operations. As the uses of coal declined, so did the coastal trade in the last three decades of the 20th-Century. It ended finally, around the turn of the 21st-Century, and is now largely forgotten. Few remnants of the once extensive coastal coal-carrying trade exist today.\n\n== Discovery of coal by colonists in New South Wales ==\nCoal was used as a fuel by the [[Awabakal]] people, the original inhabitants and traditional owners of what is now Lake Macquarie and Newcastle. Their word for coal was \"nikkin\". Evidence of coal use has been found in beach and dune [[middens]], on Lake Macquarie at [[Swansea Heads]] and Ham's Beach, and on the Central Coast at Mooney Beach.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.coalandcommunity.com/coal-and-the-aboriginal-people.php|title=The use of coal by Aboriginal people|website=www.coalandcommunity.com|access-date=1 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nA group of escaped convicts led by a married couple [[William Bryant (convict)|William]] and [[Mary Bryant]] were the first Europeans to find and use Australian coal, at the end of March 1791.

Some individual mines had been worked for well over a century. Indeed, it is only the more recent increased rate of extraction\u2014for the export market\u2014that will see the exhaustion of commercially viable reserves around the middle of the 21st-Century.\n\n== Reasons for the trade ==\n=== Coal for Sydney ===\nCoal was needed in Sydney to feed the [[Gasworks|production of town gas]] (from 1841 to 1971), as bunker coal for steamships, and as fuel for industrial and hospital heating boilers. Brickworks were a significant user of coal as a fuel. In the C19th and very early C20th, there was also some demand for coal as a fuel for domestic heating. Some coal also was trans-shipped and exported from Sydney.\n\nCoal seams extend under Sydney but the huge depth of these seams has resulted in only [[Balmain Colliery|very limited mining activity in Sydney]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/109307/balmains-own-coal-mine.pdf|title=Balmain's own coal mine|last=NSW Dept of Primary Industry|first=Primefacts|date=February 2007}}</ref> The coal seams of the [[Sydney Basin]] outcrop to the north, south and west of Sydney. The Metropolitan Colliery, 45&nbsp;km south of Sydney at [[Helensburgh, New South Wales|Helensburgh]], is the closest commercially viable coal mine.\n\nGiven the short distances involved, it is not immediately obvious why coal would be carried to Sydney by sea. Not all coal consumed in Sydney arrived by ship; the railways also carried coal to Sydney. However, the main railway lines from Sydney to the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|north]] and [[South Coast Line|south]] were not completed until the late 1880s. By that time, some mines were already well established and connected to nearby ports by local rail lines, the shipping trade was well established, and many major customers already had facilities on the waterfront of the natural port of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and were without a rail siding. Some mines had been designed to ship coal by sea only, for example [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]] (up to 1910) and the [[Wallarah Colliery]] at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. Most of the local rail lines to the mines were privately owned and used rolling stock that was not to the standards expected of main line rail operations\u2014for example wagons without air brakes\u2014and operation over government-owned lines was restricted to specific lines and not allowed on others.\n\nCoal bunkering of steamships in Sydney Harbour was a natural fit for the coastal coal trade. Sixty-milers could moor alongside a steamship and directly transfer coal to the ship's bunkers.<ref name=\":14\" /> After 1920, coal could be off-loaded at the purpose-built bunkering facility, the Ball's Head Coal Loader.<ref name=\":9\" /> Coal bunkering also took place at a 'coal wharf' at Pyrmont.<ref name=\":31\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article246109565|title=SONOMA SAILS|date=11 April 1927|work=Daily Telegraph (Sydney, NSW : 1883 - 1930)|access-date=7 March 2019|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Government Railways]] were large users of coal. But once the railway from Sydney reached the western coal-fields in 1869 and later the other coal fields, they had no need for coal carried in ships.\n\nFour of the electrical power stations in Sydney\u2014[[Bunnerong Power Station|Bunnerong]] on Botany Bay, and [[White Bay Power Station|White Bay]], [[Pyrmont Power Station|Pyrmont]] and [[Ultimo Power Station|Ultimo]] on Sydney Harbour\u2014were supplied with coal by rail.

Its coal was landed from barges at the waterfront until 1965 <ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/balmain_power_station|title=Balmain Power Station {{!}} The Dictionary of Sydney|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|language=en|access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref> and so it seems likely that some or all of the coal for the [[Balmain Power Station]] came by sea.\n\n=== Coal and coke for the other states ===\nIn parallel to the coastal trade to Sydney, there was an interstate coastal trade in coal and coke from the same ports to other Australian states, particularly Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania where black coal was needed for steamship coal bunkering, rail transport and industrial purposes and coke was needed for smelting ores.\n\n== Ships  ==\n[[File:Sixty-miler.jpg|thumb|A \"sixty-miler\" enters Newcastle Harbour in 1923.|alt=|258x258px]]\n\n=== The \u2018sixty-milers\u2019 ===\n{{Main|Sixty-miler}}\n\nCoal was carried to Sydney in ships known as \u2018sixty-milers\u2019. The name refers to the approximate distance by sea\u2014in nautical miles\u2014from the Hunter River to Sydney.\n\nThe heyday of the 'sixty-milers' was from around 1880 to the 1960s. In 1919, a Royal Commission identified twenty-nine ships engaged in the coastal coal-carrying trade.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|title=Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Design, Construction, Management, Equipment, Manning, Leading, Navigation and Running of the Vessels Engaged in the Coastal Coal-carrying Trade in New South Wales and into the Cause or Causes of the Loss of the Colliers Undola, Myola and Tuggerah.|last=Royal Commission|publisher=NSW Government Printer|year=1920|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=1 & 2}}</ref>\n\n=== The Interstate ships ===\nThere was almost no overlap in the ships used in the two coastal coal trades.

Owners of the 'sixty-milers', during this period, most typically were coal-mines (such as Coalcliff Colliery and Wallarah Colliery), or coal-shippers or merchants (such as Scott, Fell and Company, G.S.Yuill & Co. ),<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

Later companies that both owned coal mines and were also coal merchants (such as R.W.Miller and [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith Ltd]]) owned ships and ownership became more concentrated.\n\nIn the later years of the trade, one of the dominant owners was R.W. Miller<ref>{{Citation|last=Atchison|first=John|title=Miller, Robert William (1879\u20131958)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/miller-robert-william-7588|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref> and its successor companies. However, due to company takeovers and cross-ownership between R.W. Miller, Howard Smith Limited and Coal and Allied Industries, it is somewhat difficult to track ownership of vessels and loading assets of these firms. In 1989, [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith]] took full ownership of R.W.Miller. Another dominant owner in the later years of the trade was the Melbourne shipping company [[McIlwraith McEachern Limited|McIlwraith McEachern]], owners of the sixty-milers whose names included 'Bank'  (''Mortlake Bank'', etc.) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flotilla-australia.com/mcmc.htm|title=FLOTILLA AUSTRALIA|website=www.flotilla-australia.com|access-date=17 November 2018}}</ref> Ownership was sometimes difficult to follow; the ''Hexham Bank'' may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter to that company from its actual owners [[McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co|McIlwraith McEacharn]]. Ships of course were bought and sold and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners; sometimes the change in ownership also resulted in the ship's name changing, such as when the ''Corrimal'' became the ''Ayrfield''.\n\nIn contrast to the 'sixty-milers', the owners of the interstate coastal ships were usually more traditional ship-owners, some of whom specialised in carrying coal and coke.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Coal ports & operations ==\n\n=== Northern Coalfields \u2014 Hunter Valley & Lake Macquarie Region ===\nCoal from the northern coalfields was loaded at [[Hexham, New South Wales#Shipping|Hexham]] on the Hunter River, [[Carrington, New South Wales|Carrington]] (The Basin, The Dyke) near [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], on Lake Macquarie, and at the ocean jetty at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. In the early years of the trade, coal was loaded at Newcastle itself, on the southern bank of the Hunter River, at the river port of [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]], and at a wharf at Reid's Mistake at [[Swansea Heads, New South Wales|Swansea Heads]].\n\nThe coalfields to the north of Sydney had the advantage that the Hunter River and its estuary, while not ideal, could be used as a port. Mining commenced on the northern fields first. The first coal mines were initially operated by the government using convict labour. Sporadic mining operations started around what is now Newcastle and, in 1799, a cargo of coal was shipped to Bengal aboard the ''Hunter''. The first \u2018permanent\u2019 mine at Newcastle was opened in 1804.\n\nWhen Newcastle ceased to be a penal colony in 1821, the government continued to operate the mines. [[John Bigge|Commissioner Bigge]] had recommended that the mines be given over to private operation. In 1828, there was an agreement struck between the Secretary of State for colonies and the [[Australian Agricultural Company]] that made [[Australian Agricultural Company#Short-lived coal monopoly & providing land access: disputes with James Mitchell|coal mining a monopoly of that company]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

(Photographer: Ralph Snowball)]]The monopoly was broken when challenged in 1847 by the [[J & A Brown|Brown family]], who began mining coal at Maitland and using the river port of Morpeth and undercut the price of coal mined by the AAC. Coal was accessible in many places throughout the Hunter Valley and on both the eastern and western shores of Lake Macquarie. Once the monopoly was broken, many mines were soon in operation throughout the northern coalfields.\nAt the end of the C19th, the four most important companies on the northern field were the [[Australian Agricultural Company]], [[J & A Brown]], Newcastle Wallsend and Scottish Australian ([[Lambton, New South Wales#Colliery|Lambton Colliery]]). Of these, only the Scottish Australian was not a member of the Associated Northern Collieries. This was essentially a cartel that divided production as quotas for each of the participating colliery owners. There was a monetary mechanism under which collieries selling above their quota compensated those selling under their quota. To avoid companies just leaving coal in the ground, quotas were adjusted based on actual sales for the previous year. The arrangement was known as \"the Vend\" and operated for most of the years between 1872 and 1893, when it collapsed due to competition in the export market.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

Other names referenced the coal seam being mined and that confused the locality and identity of the mine further. With changes of ownership, mine names often changed and sometimes names associated with good-quality coal were moved to completely different collieries.\n\nMost mines of the northern coalfields were connected to the ports at Hexham and Carrington by an extensive network of railway lines; some were [[New South Wales Government Railways|government lines]] and others were privately owned. Coal was loaded into four-wheel wagons owned by the mining companies. The type of four-wheel wagon used consisted of a frame with wheels and a removable wooden hopper. Trains of wagons were hauled to the port, where the removable hoppers were lifted out of the frame by a crane and dumped by opening the bottom of the hopper. They were known as 'non-air' wagons because they did not have air-brakes.\n\nAt their peak, there were 13,000 of these \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons in service, belonging to around sixty operators. Larger modern bogie wagons were introduced in the 1960s and \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons were banned from Port Waratah in 1974 but continued to be used to bring coal to Hexham. There were still 3,000 in use in 1975 and 900 when the [[Richmond Vale railway line|Richmond Vale Railway]] closed in September 1987.

The Basin and the Dyke could handle larger ships and were also used for coal export and coal bunkering, as well as loading 'sixty-milers'. \n[[File:SLNSW 33842 Coal loading cranes Carrington.jpg|thumb|Coal loading cranes at Carrington. in December 1955.

Sailing ships using the old port of Newcastle tipped [[Ballast#History|stone ballast]] in the area and, with other reclamation work, the line of The Dyke was created by 1861. The Dyke had the effect of constraining the channel of the Hunter River, so that the natural flow and tidal movement of the river tended to scour sediments from the river floor and maintain a deep-water port. Land was reclaimed behind the original Dyke, which became the large rail-yard for the port. Coal was loaded at The Dyke from 1878.\n\nThe Basin is an artificial harbour, to the west of The Dyke, which opens into the junction of Throsby Creek and the Hunter River. It was created by dredging and completed in 1888. The Basin was also used to load coal.\n\nThe Carrington coal-loaders used twelve hydraulic cranes powered by water under pressure supplied from a [[Carrington Pump House|pumphouse]] nearby. There were also three steam cranes. In 1890, this government-operated facility was capable of loading a total of 12,000 tons per day. There were also some privately operated chutes capable of another 3,000 tons per day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Coal Mines of Newcastle, NSW - Their Rise and Progress|last=Kingswell|first=George H.|publisher=|year=1890|isbn=|location=https://downloads.newcastle.edu.au/library/cultural%20collections/pdf/The_coal_mines_of_Newcastle_NSW_their_rise_and_progress.pdf|pages=4}}</ref> Later some electrically operated cranes were added.

Coal in the southern coalfields was generally more easily won than in the northern field. The coal outcropped in sea cliffs or part way up the [[Illawarra escarpment|Illawarra Escarpment]] and adit mining was feasible. [[Adit]]s were less costly to construct and operate than the shafts and sloping drifts of the northern coalfields. The southern coalfields could be worked profitably, if the problem of shipping could be solved. The absence of a suitable port held back development of the southern mines, until around 1849 when the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] mine opened.\n\nCoal from the southern coal fields, at various times, was loaded at [[Wollongong Harbour Precinct|Wollongong Harbour]] and [[Port Kembla (seaport)#History of the Port|Port Kembla]] and at the ocean jetty ports: [[Bellambi, New South Wales|Bellambi]]; [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]]; Hicks Point at [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]]; and [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Sandon Point, Bulli]].

At Wollongong Harbour only, some loading was done by crane using wagons with removable hoppers, similar in concept to the ones used in the northern coalfields. After 1915, four-wheel bottom dump wagons were used to bring coal to the new No.1 Jetty at Port Kembla, via an unloading rail loop and dump station.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=The History and Development of Port Kembla - Paper prepared for presentation to the Engineering Conference of the Institute of Engineers Australia (30 March 1938).|last=Spooner|first=E.S|publisher=NSW Department of Public Works|year=1938|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=7}}</ref> This bottom-dumping operation was similar in concept to the coal-handling practice of today.\n\nUnlike the northern fields, mines of the southern coalfield were usually named after a locality or geographical feature and their names rarely changed over their lifetime. The number of mines was also less and the mines tended to have longer lives.\n\nMost of the southern coalfield mines were members of the Southern Coal Owners' Agency, which had as one of its aims 'prevention of ruinous competition'. It was a cartel-like organisation, controlling production volume, prices, and transport costs, but only for the southern coalfields. It lasted from 1893 to 1950, being renewed every few years by agreement. Although the collieries that were members owned 'sixty-miler' ships, those ships were chartered by the Agency. The Agency managed the operations of the ships and paid the owner a monthly fee based on each ship's capacity. Although the operation of the ships may not have been profitable, the colleries seem to have seen controlling the shipping of their coal as important to ensure reliable delivery, and as a necessary cost. Collieries received an initial low payment upon delivery of their coal to a customer but also later received a share of the actual profits from all sales, in proportion to their market share.<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

On Belmore Basin, there were four coal staithes on the western side of the basin and two steam cranes on the eastern side. Loading at the 'Tee Wharf' was by a single steam crane. The 'Tee-Wharf' was somewhat exposed to weather from the north and north-east; the existing northern breakwater was not built until 1966-67.\n\nThe port was connected to the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] and [[Mount Pleasant, New South Wales|Mt Pleasant]] Collieries by rail lines operated by the respective collieries.
