The gateway thus became the meeting place between the abbot, who commanded considerable powers within the town, and the people of the town. In 1839, after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution]], [[Hugh Faringdon]], the last abbot of Reading was hanged, drawn, and quartered outside the abbey gateway. Whilst the other buildings of the abbey were stripped for lead and stone, the abbot's lodging was turned into a [[royal palace]] on the orders of [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]], who was acting as [[lord protector]] as [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]] was still a child. The abbey gateway was also retained, as the entrance to the royal residence.<ref name=aqgate/><ref name=abbeygateway>{{cite web |last=Ford |first=David Nash |work=Royal Berkshire History |publisher=Nash Ford Publishing |url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/maps/reading_abbey/rdgab13.html |title=The Abbey Gateway |accessdate=2 May 2009 |archivedate=7 February 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207182216/http://www.berkshirehistory.com/maps/reading_abbey/rdgab13.html}}</ref>\n\nEdward's sister, [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], was a regular visitor to the royal palace, but during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] the old abbot\u2019s lodgings were damaged, and were not used as a royal palace again. Eventually the palace was demolished and new houses were built alongside the gateway. In the late 18th century one of them was home to the [[Reading Ladies\u2019 Boarding School]], attended amongst others by the novelist [[Jane Austen]]. The school used the room above the gateway as a classroom.<ref name=innergateway/><ref name=aqgate/><ref name=abbeygateway/><ref name=\"Reading p.23\">{{cite book| title=Reading, past and present |first=Stuart |last=Hylton |page=23 |isbn=0750949007 |publisher=Sutton Publishing Ltd |date=1 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe gateway was [[Victorian restoration|heavily restored]] by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]], after a partial collapse during a storm in 1861.

It reopened in 2018 after an extensively restoration, which was supported by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]]. The room above the gateway is now used by [[Reading Museum]] as part of its learning programme for local schools, whilst the arch below is available for use by pedestrian and cycle traffic.

The gateway thus became the meeting place between the abbot, who commanded considerable powers within the town, and the people of the town. In 1839, after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution]], [[Hugh Faringdon]], the last abbot of Reading was hanged, drawn, and quartered outside the abbey gateway. Whilst the other buildings of the abbey were stripped for lead and stone, the abbot's lodging was turned into a [[royal palace]] on the orders of [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]], who was acting as [[lord protector]] as [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]] was still a child. The abbey gateway was also retained, as the entrance to the royal residence.<ref name=aqgate/><ref name=abbeygateway>{{cite web |last=Ford |first=David Nash |work=Royal Berkshire History |publisher=Nash Ford Publishing |url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/maps/reading_abbey/rdgab13.html |title=The Abbey Gateway |accessdate=2 May 2009 |archivedate=7 February 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207182216/http://www.berkshirehistory.com/maps/reading_abbey/rdgab13.html}}</ref>\n\nEdward's sister, [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], was a regular visitor to the royal palace, but during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] the old abbot\u2019s lodgings were damaged, and were not used as a royal palace again. Eventually the palace was demolished and new houses were built alongside the gateway. In the late 18th century one of them was home to the [[Reading Ladies\u2019 Boarding School]], attended amongst others by the novelist [[Jane Austen]]. The school used the room above the gateway as a classroom.<ref name=innergateway/><ref name=aqgate/><ref name=abbeygateway/><ref name=\"Reading p.23\">{{cite book| title=Reading, past and present |first=Stuart |last=Hylton |page=23 |isbn=0750949007 |publisher=Sutton Publishing Ltd |date=1 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe gateway was [[Victorian restoration|heavily restored]] by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]], after a partial collapse during a storm in 1861.

He began his professional career with the single A Reno Padres in the California League. Whilst with Reno he showed promise going 6-6 and sporting a 3.87 earned run average. After only 15 games with the single A Reno Padres he was called up to the AA Beaumount Golden Gators. His brief stint there in 1983 yielded one game where he went 7.0 shutout innings only giving up 2 hits with 2 walks and 1 strikeout. Vosberg stayed in AA with the Golden Gators for the 1984 season improving to a 13\u201311 record with an earned run average of 3.43 and 100 strikeouts.\n\nHe was promoted to the AAA roster in 1986 to the Las Vegas Stars where he went 7\u20138 with an earned run average of 4.72. He also made his major league debut in 1986 on September 18 at the age of 24. He pitched in 5 games in 13 innings going 0\u20131 with an earned run average of 6.59. He returned to the AAA Las Vegas Stars for the 1987 season. In December 1988 he was traded to the Houston Astros for Dan Walters. Vosberg remained in the Astros' system until 1989 when he was traded to the Dodgers and assigned to AAA Albuquerque. He became a free agent in 1990 and signed with the San Francisco Giants. During the 1990 season, Edward returned to the major league level. He pitched in 18 games with 24 innings pitched and an inflated 5.55 earned run average.  He was granted free agency after the 1990 season and spent the next 4 years in the minors with the Angels, Mariners, Cubs, and Athletics organizations and even played in the Italian League in 1992.\n\nIn 1994 he returned to the majors once again with the Oakland Athletics. He pitched in 16 games with a record of 0-2 and an earned run average of 3.95. After the 1994 season Vosberg was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Supplemental Rule 5 draft. He was out righted to the minors shortly after and refused the Minor League assignment and became a free agent. He then signed a minor league contract with the Rangers organization. The Rangers purchased his contract and Vosberg once again returned to the big leagues. He pitched in 44 games out of the bullpen and put up his best numbers 5\u20135 and an earned run average of 3.00. He returned to the Texas Rangers in 1996 and had another respectable season out of the Ranger's bullpen going 1\u20131 with an ERA of 3.27 and finishing 21 games. 1997 was his final season as a Texas Ranger he was traded to the Florida Marlins for Rick Helling.

He missed the 1998 season due to injury and did not pitch at all. At the age of 37, Vosberg returned to the majors and played with the San Diego Padres. His time with the Padres was limited and his numbers were terrible. His record with the Padres was 0-0 with an earned run average of 9.72. He sustained a shoulder injury and was placed on the 15-day disabled list. A few months after rehab, he was released by the Padres on June 7, 1999. He was picked up by the Arizona Diamondbacks a few days later on June 18, 1999. His numbers improved with the move to Arizona, going 0\u20131 with am earned run average of 3.38 in four games.

It is such a great life, but it is a grind. It is difficult being away from your family. I needed these years to get the love of the game back and get on the field again.\" In his final seasons in the Mexican leagues he had a combined record of 7\u20138 with an earned run average of 4.14.\n\n==External links==\n{{Baseballstats|br=v/vosbeed01|brm=vosber001edw}}\n\n{{1980 Arizona Wildcats baseball}}\n{{1997 Florida Marlins}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vosberg, Ed}}\n[[Category:1961 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Albuquerque Dukes players]]\n[[Category:American expatriate baseball players in Canada]]\n[[Category:Arizona Diamondbacks players]]\n[[Category:Arizona Wildcats baseball players]]\n[[Category:Baseball players from Arizona]]\n[[Category:Beaumont Golden Gators players]]\n[[Category:Calgary Cannons players]]\n[[Category:Colorado Springs Sky Sox players]]\n[[Category:Competitors at the 1981 World Games]]\n[[Category:Edmonton Trappers players]]\n[[Category:Florida Marlins players]]\n[[Category:Iowa Cubs players]]\n[[Category:Las Vegas Stars (baseball) players]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball pitchers]]\n[[Category:Montreal Expos players]]\n[[Category:Oakland Athletics players]]\n[[Category:Oklahoma City 89ers players]]\n[[Category:Philadelphia Phillies players]]\n[[Category:Phoenix Firebirds players]]\n[[Category:Reno Padres players]]\n[[Category:San Diego Padres players]]\n[[Category:San Francisco Giants players]]\n[[Category:Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons players]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Tucson, Arizona]]\n[[Category:Tacoma Tigers players]]\n[[Category:Texas Rangers players]]\n[[Category:Tucson Sidewinders players]]\n[[Category:Tucson Toros players]]\n[[Category:World Games gold medalists]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American baseball player}}\n{{Infobox baseball biography\n| name       = Ed Vosberg\n| image      = \n| position   = [[Pitcher]]\n| birth_date  = {{birth date and age|1961|9|28}}\n| birth_place = [[Tucson, Arizona]]\n| death_date  = \n| bats       = Left\n| throws     = Left\n|debutleague = MLB\n| debutdate  = September 17\n| debutyear  = 1986\n| debutteam  = San Diego Padres\n|finalleague = MLB\n| finaldate  = April 10\n| finalyear  = 2002\n| finalteam  = Montreal Expos\n|statleague = MLB\n| stat1label = [[Win\u2013loss record (pitching)|Win\u2013loss record]]\n| stat1value = 10\u201315\n| stat2label = [[Earned run average]]\n| stat2value = 4.32\n| stat3label = [[Strikeout]]s\n| stat3value = 179\n| teams      =\n* [[San Diego Padres]] ({{mlby|1986}})\n* [[San Francisco Giants]] ({{mlby|1990}})\n* [[Oakland Athletics]] ({{mlby|1994}})\n* [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] ({{mlby|1995}}\u2013{{mlby|1997}})\n* [[Florida Marlins]] ({{mlby|1997}})\n* [[San Diego Padres]] ({{mlby|1999}})\n* [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] ({{mlby|1999}})\n* [[Philadelphia Phillies]] ({{mlby|2000}}\u2013{{mlby|2001}})\n* [[Montreal Expos]] ({{mlby|2002}})\n| awards     =\n* [[World Series]] champion ([[1997 World Series|1997]])\n|medaltemplates=\n{{MedalSport | Men's [[baseball]] }}\n{{MedalCountry | the {{USA}} }}\n{{MedalCompetition | [[World Games]] }}\n{{MedalGold | [[1981 World Games|1981 Santa Clara]] | [[Baseball at the 1981 World Games|Team competition]] }}\n{{MedalCompetition | [[Baseball World Cup]] }}\n{{MedalSilver | [[2001 Baseball World Cup|2001 Taipei]] | [[United States national baseball team|National team]] }}\n}}\n\n'''Edward John Vosberg''' (born September 28, 1961) is a former left-handed [[relief pitcher]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who had a 10-year career (1986, 1990, 1994\u20131997, 1999\u20132002).

A member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], he has been a [[London Assembly|Member of the London Assembly]] (AM) since the [[2008 London Assembly election|2008 election]]. He was leader of the Greater London Authority Conservatives group from 2015 to 2019. On 8 November 2019, he was selected by Orpington Conservatives as their candidate in the 2019 general election, as incumbent [[Jo Johnson]] chose not to seek reelection.\n\n== Early life and career ==\nBacon was born in Hong Kong, and studied at St. Mary's and St. Joseph's School in Sidcup, then at [[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]] where he was awarded a [[Bachelor of Arts]] honours degree in Politics and Government in 1996, followed by a [[Master of Arts]] degree in European Studies in 1997.

He was also Shadow Cabinet Spokesman for Environment Transport and Regeneration from 2003 to 2006 and after the 2006 elections, was appointed Cabinet Member for the Environment. He retained his Cabinet post after the Conservative election victory of 2010 and in 2012 his portfolio was widened to incorporate Public Realm in addition to Environment. He was elected Deputy Leader of the Council following the local elections of 2014, a position he left in 2015 after his appointment by Boris Johnson as Chairman of the London Fire & Emergency Planning Authority.\n\nBacon was a key player in the team that secured a landslide victory for the Conservatives over the incumbent Labour Party in the local elections of 2006, after which he was appointed Cabinet Member for the Environment. He was instrumental in steering through an enhanced recycling service in Bexley, which produced a 20% increase in the level of recycling in the borough in the first year and ensured that Bexley retained its position as the leading borough for recycling in London, breaking through the 50% barrier for the first time and avoiding an increase of \u00a32 million in costs for waste disposal. \n\nBacon is a former Deputy Chairman of Old Bexley & Sidcup Conservative Association (2000\u20132003) and was the Conservative candidate for the London Assembly constituency of Greenwich & Lewisham in 2004, where he lost to the incumbent Labour member, the former Leader of Greenwich Council, Len Duvall, although reducing the Labour majority by 22%.\n\nIn October 2017, Bacon was listed by [[Iain Dale]] at Number 97 in the '100 most influential on the Right', on the website [[ConservativeHome]]<ref>{{Cite news|last=Dale|first=Iain|url=https://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2017/10/iain-dales-100-most-influential-people-on-the-right-2017.html|title=Iain Dale's 100 most influential people on the Right 2017.

The present DNA analysis' resolution is not high enough to determine their relationships to different species of ''[[Anas]]'', but [[biogeography]] strongly suggests that their closest living relative is the widespread [[Pacific black duck]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n<!-- From the [[DNA sequence]]s it has been estimated that the ancestors of the moa-nalo reached the Hawaiian Islands about 3.6 million years ago (calibration used may recently have turned out to be erroneous - In that case, cite a source for the problem), by which time the genus ''Anas'' was already distributed worldwide. There they increased in size, but must have retained the ability to fly until they had spread to the newer islands. They seem to have lost the power of flight by the time the main island of Hawai{{okina}}i had emerged from the sea (400,000 years ago); there, their [[ecological niche|niche]] was filled by one or two species of now extinct giant ''[[Branta]]'' goose presumably related to the surviving [[Nene (bird)|n\u0113n\u0113]]. -->\n\n==Ecology==\n[[Image:Cyanea platyphylla.jpg|thumb|A sapling of ''Cyanea platyphylla'', showing the prickles that probably evolved as a defense against feeding by moa-nalo.]]\n[[Image:Chelychelychen quassus.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of ''Chelychelychen quassus'']]\nThe unusual shape and size of the moa-nalo can be attributed to their role in the [[ecology]] of prehistoric Hawai{{okina}}i. A study of [[coprolite]]s (fossil dung) of ''Thambetochen chauliodous'' found in Pu{{okina}}u Naio Cave on lowland Maui has shown they were [[Folivore|folivorous]], at least in [[Hawaiian tropical dry forests#Prehistoric dry forests|dry shrub]] or [[mesic forest]] [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]s eating particularly fronds from [[fern]]s (possibly ''[[Asplenium nidus]]'' or ''[[Dryopteris wallichiana]]''). This conclusion is backed up by the shapes of their beaks (James & Burney 1997). This indicates they were the principal [[Herbivory|browser]]s on the island.\nThe presence of prominent spines on the leaves and soft young stems of several [[Hawaiian lobelioids]] in the genus ''[[Hawaiian lobelioids#Cyanea|Cyanea]]''\u2014unusual in an island flora where such defenses are frequently lost, as in the ''[[Rubus hawaiensis|{{okina}}\u0101kala]]'' (Hawaiian [[Rubus|raspberry]])\u2014suggests that the ''Cyanea'' evolved these thorn-like prickles on new growth because they protect against browsing by the moa-nalo. The moa-nalo themselves filled the [[ecological niche|niche]] of herbivore usually filled by mammals such as [[goat]]s and [[deer]], or the [[giant tortoise]]s of [[Gal\u00e1pagos]] and other [[archipelago]]es. This has implications for the ecology of Hawaiian Islands today, as a major group of species have been lost.\n\nLike island [[taxa]] from [[Mauritius]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Polynesia]], the moa-nalo were unused to [[mammal]]s and were easily taken by hunters or the animals that were introduced and became [[feral]], such as [[domestic pig]]s.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Giant tortoise]]s, found on several archipelagos around the world\n* [[Island gigantism]]\n* [[Late Quaternary prehistoric birds]]\n* [[Moa]], enormous extinct flightless [[ratite]]s, formerly the largest herbivores in New Zealand\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n* '''James''', Helen F. & '''Burney''', David A.

All species were [[Flightless bird|flightless]] and large, with an average mass of {{convert|4|-|7.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Evolution==\n[[Image:Thambetochen xanion.jpg|thumb|left|Reconstruction of ''Thambetochen xanion'']]\n[[File:Thambetochen xanion (1).jpg|thumb|Rostrum and sternum of ''Thambetochen xanion'']]\nSome moa-nalo fossils have been found to contain traces of [[mitochondrial DNA]] which were compared to living duck species in order to establish their place in the duck family, [[Anatidae]].<ref name=Sorenson>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1098/rspb.1999.0907|pmc = 1690346|title = Relationships of the extinct moa-nalos, flightless Hawaiian waterfowl, based on ancient DNA|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

The present DNA analysis' resolution is not high enough to determine their relationships to different species of ''[[Anas]]'', but [[biogeography]] strongly suggests that their closest living relative is the widespread [[Pacific black duck]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n<!-- From the [[DNA sequence]]s it has been estimated that the ancestors of the moa-nalo reached the Hawaiian Islands about 3.6 million years ago (calibration used may recently have turned out to be erroneous - In that case, cite a source for the problem), by which time the genus ''Anas'' was already distributed worldwide. There they increased in size, but must have retained the ability to fly until they had spread to the newer islands. They seem to have lost the power of flight by the time the main island of Hawai{{okina}}i had emerged from the sea (400,000 years ago); there, their [[ecological niche|niche]] was filled by one or two species of now extinct giant ''[[Branta]]'' goose presumably related to the surviving [[Nene (bird)|n\u0113n\u0113]]. -->\n\n==Ecology==\n[[Image:Cyanea platyphylla.jpg|thumb|A sapling of ''Cyanea platyphylla'', showing the prickles that probably evolved as a defense against feeding by moa-nalo.]]\n[[Image:Chelychelychen quassus.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of ''Chelychelychen quassus'']]\nThe unusual shape and size of the moa-nalo can be attributed to their role in the [[ecology]] of prehistoric Hawai{{okina}}i. A study of [[coprolite]]s (fossil dung) of ''Thambetochen chauliodous'' found in Pu{{okina}}u Naio Cave on lowland Maui has shown they were [[Folivore|folivorous]], at least in [[Hawaiian tropical dry forests#Prehistoric dry forests|dry shrub]] or [[mesic forest]] [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]s eating particularly fronds from [[fern]]s (possibly ''[[Asplenium nidus]]'' or ''[[Dryopteris wallichiana]]''). This conclusion is backed up by the shapes of their beaks (James & Burney 1997). This indicates they were the principal [[Herbivory|browser]]s on the island.\nThe presence of prominent spines on the leaves and soft young stems of several [[Hawaiian lobelioids]] in the genus ''[[Hawaiian lobelioids#Cyanea|Cyanea]]''\u2014unusual in an island flora where such defenses are frequently lost, as in the ''[[Rubus hawaiensis|{{okina}}\u0101kala]]'' (Hawaiian [[Rubus|raspberry]])\u2014suggests that the ''Cyanea'' evolved these thorn-like prickles on new growth because they protect against browsing by the moa-nalo. The moa-nalo themselves filled the [[ecological niche|niche]] of herbivore usually filled by mammals such as [[goat]]s and [[deer]], or the [[giant tortoise]]s of [[Gal\u00e1pagos]] and other [[archipelago]]es. This has implications for the ecology of Hawaiian Islands today, as a major group of species have been lost.\n\nLike island [[taxa]] from [[Mauritius]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Polynesia]], the moa-nalo were unused to [[mammal]]s and were easily taken by hunters or the animals that were introduced and became [[feral]], such as [[domestic pig]]s.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Giant tortoise]]s, found on several archipelagos around the world\n* [[Island gigantism]]\n* [[Late Quaternary prehistoric birds]]\n* [[Moa]], enormous extinct flightless [[ratite]]s, formerly the largest herbivores in New Zealand\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n* '''James''', Helen F. & '''Burney''', David A.
