Lignin is found as a byproduct of polysaccharide extraction from plant material through the production of paper, ethanol, and more.<ref name=\"Thakur2014\" /> It is high in abundance with reports showing that 50 million tons are being created by chemical pulp industries each year.<ref name=\"Taniguchi_PET\" /> Lignin is useful due to its low weight material and the fact that it is more environmentally friendly than other alternatives. Lignin is neutral to CO<sub>2</sub> release during the biodegradation process.<ref name=\"Thakur2014\" /> Other biodegradable plastic processes such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) have been found to release CO2 and water as waste products produced by the degrading microorganisms.<ref name=\"Taniguchi_PET\" />\n\nLignin contains comparable chemical properties in comparison to current plastic chemicals, which includes reactive functional groups, the ability to form into films, high carbon percentage, and it shows versatility in relation to various chemical mixtures used with plastics. Lignin is also stable, and contains aromatic rings. It is both elastic and viscous yet flows smoothly in the liquid phase.  Most importantly lignin can improve on the current standards of plastics because it is antimicrobial in nature.<ref name=\"Thakur2014\" /> It is being produced at such great quantities and is readily available for use as an emerging environmentally friendly polymer.\n\n===Petroleum-based plastics===\nPetroleum-based plastics are derived from petrochemicals, which are obtained from fossil crude oil, coal or natural gas. The most widely used petroleum-based plastics such as [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET), [[polyethylene]] (PE), [[polypropylene]] (PP), and [[polystyrene]] (PS) are not biodegradable. However, the following petroleum-based plastics listed are. \n\n==== Polyglycolic acid (PGA) ====\n[[Polyglycolide|Polyglycolic acid]] is a thermoplastic polymer and an aliphatic polyester. PGA is often used in medical applications such as PGA sutures for its biodegradability. The ester linkage in the backbone of polyglycolic acid gives it hydrolytic instability. Thus polyglycolic acid can degrade into its nontoxic monomer, glycolic acid, through hydrolysis. This process can be expedited with esterases. In the body, glycolic acid can enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle, after which can be excreted as water and carbon dioxide.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=CSIRO Molecular Science, Bag 10, Clayton South MDC, Vic 3169, Australia|last2=Gunatillake|first2=Pa|date=2003-10-01|title=Biodegradable synthetic polymers for tissue engineering|journal=European Cells and Materials|volume=5|pages=1\u201316|doi=10.22203/eCM.v005a01|pmid=14562275}}</ref>\n\n==== Polybutylene succinate (PBS) ====\n[[Polybutylene succinate]] is a thermoplastic polymer resin that has properties comparable to [[propylene]].

Additionally, companies that label plastics with oxo-biodegradable additives as entirely biodegradable contribute to misinformation. Similarly, some brands may claim that their plastics are biodegradable when, in fact, they are non-biodegradable bioplastics.\n\n== Environmental impacts ==\n===Environmental benefits===\n'''Microbial degradation:''' The primary purpose of biodegradable plastics is to replace traditional plastics that persist in landfills and harm the environment. Therefore, the ability of microorganisms to break down these plastics is an incredible environmental advantage. Microbial degradation is accomplished by 3 steps: colonization of the plastic surface, hydrolysis, and mineralization. First, microorganisms populate the exposed plastics. Next, the bacteria secrete enzymes that bind to the carbon source or polymer substrates and then split the hydrocarbon bonds. The process results in the production of H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>. Despite the release of CO<sub>2</sub> into the environment, biodegradable plastics leave a smaller footprint than petroleum-based plastics that accumulate in landfills and cause heavy pollution, which is why they are explored as alternatives to traditional plastics.<ref name=\"Tokiwa 3722\u20133742\"/>\n\n'''Municipal solid waste:''' According to a 2010 report of the United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) the US had 31 million tons of plastic waste, representing 12.4% of all municipal solid waste. Of that, 2.55 million tons were recovered. This 8.2% recovery was much less than the 34.1% overall recovery percentage for municipal solid waste.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/pubs/msw_2010_rev_factsheet.pdf|title=Municipal Waste Factsheet|publisher=EPA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801063035/http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/pubs/msw_2010_rev_factsheet.pdf|archive-date=1 August 2013|url-status=dead|access-date=7 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nDepressed plastics recovery rates can be attributed to conventional plastics are often commingled with organic wastes (food scraps, wet paper, and liquids), leading to accumulation of waste in landfills and natural habitats.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Richard C.|last2=Moore|first2=Charles J.|last3=Saal|first3=Frederick S. vom|last4=Swan|first4=Shanna|date=14 June 2009|title=Plastics, the environment and human health: current consensus and future trends|journal=Phil.

Rather than worrying about recycling a relatively small quantity of commingled plastics, proponents argue that certified biodegradable plastics can be readily commingled with other organic wastes, thereby enabling composting of a much larger portion of nonrecoverable solid waste.\n\nCommercial composting for all mixed organics then becomes commercially viable and economically sustainable. More municipalities can divert significant quantities of waste from overburdened landfills since the entire waste stream is now biodegradable and therefore easier to process. This move away from the use of landfills may help alleviate the issue of [[plastic pollution]].\n\nThe use of biodegradable plastics, therefore, is seen as enabling the complete recovery of large quantities of municipal solid waste (via aerobic composting and feedstocks) that have heretofore been unrecoverable by other means except land filling or incineration.<ref>Hermes, Jennifer.

This design triggered innovation into what is being engineered as of the year 2019. The current biodegradable CPs is applicable for use in the biomedical field. The compositional architecture of current biodegradable CPs includes the conductivity properties of oligomer-based biodegradable polymers implemented into compositions of linear, starshaped, or hyperbranched formations. Another implementation to enhance the biodegradable architecture of the CPs is by use of monomers and conjugated links that are degradable.<ref name=\":8\" /> The biodegradable polymers used in biomedical applications typically consist of hydrolyzable esters and hydrazones. These molecules, upon external stimulation, go on to be cleaved and broken down. The cleaving activation process can be achieved through use of an acidic environment, increasing the temperature, or by use of enzymes.<ref name=\":8\" /> Three categories of biodegradable CP composites have been established in relation their chemistry makeup. The first category includes partially biodegradable CP blends of conductive and biodegradable polymeric materials. The second category includes conducting oligomers of biodegradable CPs. The third category is that of modified and degradable monimer units along with use of degradable conjugated links for use in biodegradable CPs polymers.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\">Gold Nanoparticle-Integrated Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine\nMoran Yadid, Ron Feiner, and Tal Dvir\nNano Letters 2019 19 (4), 2198-2206\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b00472\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biodegradation]]\n* [[Biodegradable bags]]\n* [[Biodegradable waste]]\n* [[Biodegradable additives]]\n* [[Bioplastic]]\n* [[BioSphere Plastic]]\n* [[Economics of plastics processing]]\n* [[Microplastics]]\n* [[Photodegradation]]\n* [[Plastic bag]]\n* [[Plastics 2020 Challenge]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* [https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/7468/-Biodegradable_Plastics_and_Marine_Litter_Misconceptions,_concerns_and_impacts_on_marine_environments-2015BiodegradablePlasticsAndMarineLitter.pdf.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y Biodegradable Plastics and Marine Litter]\n* [https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.7b04051 Biodegradability of Plastics: Challenges and Misconceptions]\n*{{Cite book|title=Green plastics : an introduction to the new science of biodegradable plastics|last=Stevens|first=Eugene|authorlink=Eugene Stevens|date=2002|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691049670|location=Princeton|oclc=47162140|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/greenplasticsint00stev}}\n{{Subject bar|portal1=Ecology|portal3=Technology}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Thakur2014\">{{cite journal | last1 = Thakur | first1 =Vijay Kumar | last2 = Thakur | first2 = Manju Kumari |last3 = Raghavan |first3 = Prasanth |last4 = Kessler |first4 = Michael R.  | authorlink = | title = Progress in Green Polymer Composites from Lignin for Multifunctional Applications: A Review | journal = ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | pages = 1072\u20132019 | publisher = [[ACS Publications]] | year = 2014 | issn = | doi = 10.1021/sc500087z | id = }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Taniguchi_PET\">{{cite journal | last1 = Taniguchi | first1 = Ikuo | last2 = Yoshida | first2 = Shosuke | last3 = Hiraga | first3 = Kazumi | last4 = Miyamoto | first4 = Kenji | last5 = Kimura | first5 = Yoshiharu | last6 = Oda | first6 = Kohei | authorlink = | title = Biodegradation of PET: Current Status and Application Aspects | journal = ACS Catalysis | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 4089\u20134105 | publisher = [[ACS Publications]] | year = 2019 | issn = | doi = 10.1021/acscatal.8b05171 | id = }}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n{{Packaging}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Biodegradable Plastic}}\n[[Category:Biodegradable plastics| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Plastics that can be decomposed by the action of living organisms}}\n{{About||information on plastics derived from renewable raw resources (biomass)|Bioplastic|information on plastics designed to biodegrade in human bodies|Biodegradable polymer}}[[File:BiodegradablePlasticUtensils2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Disposable [[cutlery]] made from biodegradable plastic]]\n\n'''Biodegradable plastics''' are [[plastic]]s that can be decomposed by the action of living organisms, usually microbes, into water, carbon dioxide, and biomass.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Ammala\n | first =Anne\n | title =An overview of degradable and biodegradable polyolefins\n | journal = Progress in Polymer Science\n | date =2011\n | pages =1015\u20131043\n| volume     = 36\n| issue      = 8\n | url =https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP102448&dsid=DS3\n | access-date =September 21, 2018\n | doi =10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2010.12.002\n }}</ref> Biodegradable plastics are commonly produced with renewable raw materials, micro-organisms, [[Petrochemical|petrochemicals]], or combinations of all three.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/how-long-does-it-take-for-plastics-to-biodegrade.htm |title=How long does it take for plastics to biodegrade? |publisher=How Stuff Works |author=William Harris |accessdate=2013-05-09|date=2010-12-15 }}</ref> \n\nWhile the words \"bioplastic\" and \"biodegradable plastic\" are similar, they are not synonymous.

Additionally, companies that label plastics with oxo-biodegradable additives as entirely biodegradable contribute to misinformation. Similarly, some brands may claim that their plastics are biodegradable when, in fact, they are non-biodegradable bioplastics.\n\n== Environmental impacts ==\n===Environmental benefits===\n'''Microbial degradation:''' The primary purpose of biodegradable plastics is to replace traditional plastics that persist in landfills and harm the environment. Therefore, the ability of microorganisms to break down these plastics is an incredible environmental advantage. Microbial degradation is accomplished by 3 steps: colonization of the plastic surface, hydrolysis, and mineralization. First, microorganisms populate the exposed plastics. Next, the bacteria secrete enzymes that bind to the carbon source or polymer substrates and then split the hydrocarbon bonds. The process results in the production of H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>. Despite the release of CO<sub>2</sub> into the environment, biodegradable plastics leave a smaller footprint than petroleum-based plastics that accumulate in landfills and cause heavy pollution, which is why they are explored as alternatives to traditional plastics.<ref name=\"Tokiwa 3722\u20133742\"/>\n\n'''Municipal solid waste:''' According to a 2010 report of the United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) the US had 31 million tons of plastic waste, representing 12.4% of all municipal solid waste. Of that, 2.55 million tons were recovered. This 8.2% recovery was much less than the 34.1% overall recovery percentage for municipal solid waste.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/pubs/msw_2010_rev_factsheet.pdf|title=Municipal Waste Factsheet|publisher=EPA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801063035/http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/pubs/msw_2010_rev_factsheet.pdf|archive-date=1 August 2013|url-status=dead|access-date=7 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nDepressed plastics recovery rates can be attributed to conventional plastics are often commingled with organic wastes (food scraps, wet paper, and liquids), leading to accumulation of waste in landfills and natural habitats.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Richard C.|last2=Moore|first2=Charles J.|last3=Saal|first3=Frederick S. vom|last4=Swan|first4=Shanna|date=14 June 2009|title=Plastics, the environment and human health: current consensus and future trends|journal=Phil.

Rather than worrying about recycling a relatively small quantity of commingled plastics, proponents argue that certified biodegradable plastics can be readily commingled with other organic wastes, thereby enabling composting of a much larger portion of nonrecoverable solid waste.\n\nCommercial composting for all mixed organics then becomes commercially viable and economically sustainable. More municipalities can divert significant quantities of waste from overburdened landfills since the entire waste stream is now biodegradable and therefore easier to process. This move away from the use of landfills may help alleviate the issue of [[plastic pollution]].\n\nThe use of biodegradable plastics, therefore, is seen as enabling the complete recovery of large quantities of municipal solid waste (via aerobic composting and feedstocks) that have heretofore been unrecoverable by other means except land filling or incineration.<ref>Hermes, Jennifer.

This design triggered innovation into what is being engineered as of the year 2019. The current biodegradable CPs is applicable for use in the biomedical field. The compositional architecture of current biodegradable CPs includes the conductivity properties of oligomer-based biodegradable polymers implemented into compositions of linear, starshaped, or hyperbranched formations. Another implementation to enhance the biodegradable architecture of the CPs is by use of monomers and conjugated links that are degradable.<ref name=\":8\" /> The biodegradable polymers used in biomedical applications typically consist of hydrolyzable esters and hydrazones. These molecules, upon external stimulation, go on to be cleaved and broken down. The cleaving activation process can be achieved through use of an acidic environment, increasing the temperature, or by use of enzymes.<ref name=\":8\" /> Three categories of biodegradable CP composites have been established in relation their chemistry makeup. The first category includes partially biodegradable CP blends of conductive and biodegradable polymeric materials. The second category includes conducting oligomers of biodegradable CPs. The third category is that of modified and degradable monimer units along with use of degradable conjugated links for use in biodegradable CPs polymers.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\">Gold Nanoparticle-Integrated Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine\nMoran Yadid, Ron Feiner, and Tal Dvir\nNano Letters 2019 19 (4), 2198-2206\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b00472\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biodegradation]]\n* [[Biodegradable bags]]\n* [[Biodegradable waste]]\n* [[Biodegradable additives]]\n* [[Bioplastic]]\n* [[BioSphere Plastic]]\n* [[Economics of plastics processing]]\n* [[Microplastics]]\n* [[Photodegradation]]\n* [[Plastic bag]]\n* [[Plastics 2020 Challenge]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* [https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/7468/-Biodegradable_Plastics_and_Marine_Litter_Misconceptions,_concerns_and_impacts_on_marine_environments-2015BiodegradablePlasticsAndMarineLitter.pdf.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y Biodegradable Plastics and Marine Litter]\n* [https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.7b04051 Biodegradability of Plastics: Challenges and Misconceptions]\n*{{Cite book|title=Green plastics : an introduction to the new science of biodegradable plastics|last=Stevens|first=Eugene|authorlink=Eugene Stevens|date=2002|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691049670|location=Princeton|oclc=47162140|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/greenplasticsint00stev}}\n{{Subject bar|portal1=Ecology|portal3=Technology}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Thakur2014\">{{cite journal | last1 = Thakur | first1 =Vijay Kumar | last2 = Thakur | first2 = Manju Kumari |last3 = Raghavan |first3 = Prasanth |last4 = Kessler |first4 = Michael R.  | authorlink = | title = Progress in Green Polymer Composites from Lignin for Multifunctional Applications: A Review | journal = ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | pages = 1072\u20132019 | publisher = [[ACS Publications]] | year = 2014 | issn = | doi = 10.1021/sc500087z | id = }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Taniguchi_PET\">{{cite journal | last1 = Taniguchi | first1 = Ikuo | last2 = Yoshida | first2 = Shosuke | last3 = Hiraga | first3 = Kazumi | last4 = Miyamoto | first4 = Kenji | last5 = Kimura | first5 = Yoshiharu | last6 = Oda | first6 = Kohei | authorlink = | title = Biodegradation of PET: Current Status and Application Aspects | journal = ACS Catalysis | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 4089\u20134105 | publisher = [[ACS Publications]] | year = 2019 | issn = | doi = 10.1021/acscatal.8b05171 | id = }}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n{{Packaging}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Biodegradable Plastic}}\n[[Category:Biodegradable plastics| ]]\n", "name_user": "CrapperFlapper", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:Fixed a spelling error", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradable_plastic"}

Quick Sync was introduced with the Gen 6 in Sandy Bridge microprocessors on 9 January 2011.\n\n=== Graphics Virtualization Technology ===\n{{Main article|Graphics Virtualization Technology}}\n\n[[Graphics Virtualization Technology]] was announced {{date|2014-01-01}} and is supported by Iris Pro GPUs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://01.org/blogs/skjain/2014/intel%C2%AE-graphics-virtualization-update |title=Intel\u00ae Graphics Virtualization Update|date=2014-05-05}}</ref>\n\n=== Multiple monitors ===\n{{See also|Multi-monitor|Digital Visual Interface#Clock and data relationship}}\n\n==== Ivy Bridge ====\nHD&nbsp;2500 and HD&nbsp;4000 GPUs in [[Ivy Bridge (microarchitecture)|Ivy Bridge]] CPUs are advertised as supporting three active monitors, but this only works if two of the monitors are configured identically, which covers many<ref name=Larabel/> but not all three-monitor configurations.  The reason for this is that the chipsets only include two [[phase-locked loop]]s (PLLs) for generating the [[pixel clock]]s timing the data being transferred to the displays.<ref name=\"vrzone\">{{cite web|url=http://vr-zone.com/articles/most-desktop-ivy-bridge-systems-won-t-support-three-displays/15407.html|title=Most desktop Ivy Bridge systems won't support three displays|author=LG Nilsson|date=2012-03-12|publisher=VRZone|quote=Despite the fact that Intel has been banging its drums about support for up to three displays on the upcoming 7-series motherboards in combination with a shiny new Ivy Bridge based CPU, this isn't likely to be the case. The simple reason behind this is that very few, if any motherboards will sport a pair of DisplayPort connectors.}}</ref>\n\nTherefore, three simultaneously active monitors can only be achieved when at least two of them share the same pixel clock, such as:\n\n* Using two or three [[DisplayPort]] connections, as they require only a single pixel clock for all connections.<ref name=\"display-tech\">{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/new-display-technologies-on-intel-embedded-platforms-paper.pdf|publisher=[[Intel]]|title=Migration to New Display Technologies on Intel Embedded Platforms|author=David Galus|date=February 2013|quote=The Intel\u00ae 7 Series Chipset based platform allows for the support of up to three concurrent displays with independent or replicated content. However, this comes with the requirement that either one of the displays is eDP running off the CPU or two DP interfaces are being used off the PCH. When configuring the 2 DP interfaces from the PCH, one may be an eDP if using Port D. This limitation exists because the 7 Series Intel PCH contains only two display PLLs (the CPU has one display PLL also) which will control the clocking for the respective displays. All display types other than DP have an external variable clock frequency associated with the display resolution that is being used. The DP interface has an embedded clocking scheme that is semi- variable, either at 162 or 270 MHz depending on the bandwidth required. Therefore, Intel only allows sharing of a display PLL with DP related interfaces.}}</ref> Passive adapters from DisplayPort to some other connector do not count as a DisplayPort connection, as they rely on the chipset being able to emit a non-DisplayPort signal through the DisplayPort connector. Active adapters that contain additional logic to convert the DisplayPort signal to some other format count as a DisplayPort connection.\n* Using two non-DisplayPort connections of the same connection type (for example, two HDMI connections) and the same clock frequency (like when connected to two identical monitors at the same resolution), so that a single unique pixel clock can be shared between both connections.<ref name=Larabel>{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTk3Mw|title=Details On Intel Ivy Bridge Triple Monitor Support|author=Michael Larabel|date=2011-10-06|website=[[Phoronix]]|quote=A limitation of this triple monitor support for Ivy Bridge is that two of the pipes need to share a PLL. Ivy Bridge has three planes, three pipes, three transcoders, and three FDI (Flexible Display Interface) interfaces for this triple monitor support, but there's only two pipe PLLs. This means that two of the three outputs need to have the same connection type and same timings. However, most people in a triple monitor environment will have at least two \u2014 if not all three \u2014 of the monitors be identical and configured the same, so this shouldn't be a terribly huge issue.|author-link=Michael Larabel}}</ref>\n\nAnother possible three-monitor solution uses the [[DisplayPort#eDP|Embedded DisplayPort]] on a mobile CPU (which does not use a chipset PLL at all) along with any two chipset outputs.<ref name=\"display-tech\"/>\n\n==== Haswell ====\n[[ASRock]] Z87- and H87-based motherboards support three displays simultaneously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Z87E-ITX/|title=Z87E-ITX|quote=This motherboard supports Triple Monitor.

The performance increases brought by Intel's HD Graphics made the products competitive with integrated graphics adapters made by its rivals, [[Nvidia]] and [[AMD|ATI/AMD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-Radeon-HD-7310.70634.0.html |title=AMD Radeon HD 7310 |website=Notebookcheck.net |date=2013-01-17 |accessdate=2014-04-20}}</ref> Intel HD Graphics, featuring minimal power consumption that is important in [[laptop]]s, was capable enough that PC manufacturers often stopped offering [[video card|discrete graphics]] options in both low-end and high-end laptop lines, where reduced dimensions and low power consumption are important.\n\n== Generations ==\n{{See also|List of Intel graphics processing units}}\n\nIntel HD and Iris Graphics are divided into generations, and within each generation are divided into 'tiers' of increasing performance, denominated by the 'GTx' label.\n\n===Generation five based===\n{{anchor|Gen5}}\n\n==== Westmere ====\nIn January 2010, [[Clarkdale (microprocessor)|Clarkdale]] and [[Arrandale (microprocessor)|Arrandale]] processors with '''Ironlake''' graphics were released, and branded as [[Celeron]], [[Pentium]], or [[Intel Core|Core]] with HD Graphics.

The name \"Quick Sync\" refers to the use case of quickly [[transcoding]] (\"syncing\") a video from, for example, a [[DVD]] or [[Blu-ray Disc]] to a format appropriate to, for example, a [[smartphone]]. Quick Sync was introduced with the Gen 6 in Sandy Bridge microprocessors on 9 January 2011.\n\n=== Graphics Virtualization Technology ===\n{{Main article|Graphics Virtualization Technology}}\n\n[[Graphics Virtualization Technology]] was announced {{date|2014-01-01}} and is supported by Iris Pro GPUs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://01.org/blogs/skjain/2014/intel%C2%AE-graphics-virtualization-update |title=Intel\u00ae Graphics Virtualization Update|date=2014-05-05}}</ref>\n\n=== Multiple monitors ===\n{{See also|Multi-monitor|Digital Visual Interface#Clock and data relationship}}\n\n==== Ivy Bridge ====\nHD&nbsp;2500 and HD&nbsp;4000 GPUs in [[Ivy Bridge (microarchitecture)|Ivy Bridge]] CPUs are advertised as supporting three active monitors, but this only works if two of the monitors are configured identically, which covers many<ref name=Larabel/> but not all three-monitor configurations.  The reason for this is that the chipsets only include two [[phase-locked loop]]s (PLLs) for generating the [[pixel clock]]s timing the data being transferred to the displays.<ref name=\"vrzone\">{{cite web|url=http://vr-zone.com/articles/most-desktop-ivy-bridge-systems-won-t-support-three-displays/15407.html|title=Most desktop Ivy Bridge systems won't support three displays|author=LG Nilsson|date=2012-03-12|publisher=VRZone|quote=Despite the fact that Intel has been banging its drums about support for up to three displays on the upcoming 7-series motherboards in combination with a shiny new Ivy Bridge based CPU, this isn't likely to be the case. The simple reason behind this is that very few, if any motherboards will sport a pair of DisplayPort connectors.}}</ref>\n\nTherefore, three simultaneously active monitors can only be achieved when at least two of them share the same pixel clock, such as:\n\n* Using two or three [[DisplayPort]] connections, as they require only a single pixel clock for all connections.<ref name=\"display-tech\">{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/new-display-technologies-on-intel-embedded-platforms-paper.pdf|publisher=[[Intel]]|title=Migration to New Display Technologies on Intel Embedded Platforms|author=David Galus|date=February 2013|quote=The Intel\u00ae 7 Series Chipset based platform allows for the support of up to three concurrent displays with independent or replicated content. However, this comes with the requirement that either one of the displays is eDP running off the CPU or two DP interfaces are being used off the PCH. When configuring the 2 DP interfaces from the PCH, one may be an eDP if using Port D. This limitation exists because the 7 Series Intel PCH contains only two display PLLs (the CPU has one display PLL also) which will control the clocking for the respective displays. All display types other than DP have an external variable clock frequency associated with the display resolution that is being used. The DP interface has an embedded clocking scheme that is semi- variable, either at 162 or 270 MHz depending on the bandwidth required. Therefore, Intel only allows sharing of a display PLL with DP related interfaces.}}</ref> Passive adapters from DisplayPort to some other connector do not count as a DisplayPort connection, as they rely on the chipset being able to emit a non-DisplayPort signal through the DisplayPort connector. Active adapters that contain additional logic to convert the DisplayPort signal to some other format count as a DisplayPort connection.\n* Using two non-DisplayPort connections of the same connection type (for example, two HDMI connections) and the same clock frequency (like when connected to two identical monitors at the same resolution), so that a single unique pixel clock can be shared between both connections.<ref name=Larabel>{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTk3Mw|title=Details On Intel Ivy Bridge Triple Monitor Support|author=Michael Larabel|date=2011-10-06|website=[[Phoronix]]|quote=A limitation of this triple monitor support for Ivy Bridge is that two of the pipes need to share a PLL. Ivy Bridge has three planes, three pipes, three transcoders, and three FDI (Flexible Display Interface) interfaces for this triple monitor support, but there's only two pipe PLLs. This means that two of the three outputs need to have the same connection type and same timings.

He is one of four individuals to have attained the rank of [[Fleet admiral (United States)|fleet admiral]] of the United States Navy, the others being [[Ernest King]], [[William D. Leahy|William Leahy]], and [[Chester W. Nimitz]].\n\nBorn in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], Halsey graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1904. He served in the [[Great White Fleet]] and, during [[World War I]], commanded the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Shaw|DD-68|6}}. He took command of the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}} in 1935 after completing a course in naval aviation, and was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in 1938. At the start of the [[Pacific War|War in the Pacific]] (1941\u20131945), Halsey commanded the task force centered on the carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} in a series of raids against [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]-held targets. \n\nHalsey was made commander, [[South Pacific Area]], and led the Allied forces over the course of the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Battle for Guadalcanal]] (1942\u201343) and the [[Solomon Islands campaign|fighting up the Solomon chain]] (1942\u201345).<ref name=\"Morison p. 183\">Morison, ''The Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p. 183.</ref>  In 1943 he was made commander of the [[United States Third Fleet|Third Fleet]], the post he held through the rest of the war.<ref name=\"Potter p. 112\">Potter, p.&nbsp;112.</ref> He took part in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Battle for Leyte Gulf]], the largest naval battle of the Second World War and, by some criteria, the [[largest naval battle in history]]. He was promoted to fleet admiral in December 1945 and retired from active service in March 1947.\n\n==Early years==\nHalsey was born in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], on October 30, 1882, the son of [[United States Navy]] Captain [[William F.

Halsey was on the bridge of the battleship {{USS|Missouri|BB-11|6}} on April 13, 1904, when a flareback from the port gun in her after turret ignited a powder charge and set off two others.

Halsey commanded a number of torpedo boats and [[destroyer]]s during the 1910s and 1920s. At that time, the destroyer and the torpedo boat, though extremely hazardous delivery methods, were the most effective way to bring the torpedo into combat against capital ships. Then-[[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Halsey's World War I service, including command of {{USS|Shaw|DD-68|6}} in 1918, earned him the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]].\n\n== Interwar years ==\nIn October 1922, he was the [[Naval Attach\u00e9|naval attach\u00e9]] at the American Embassy in [[Berlin]], Germany. One year later, he was given additional duty as naval attach\u00e9 at the American Embassies in [[Oslo|Christiania]], Norway; [[Copenhagen]], Denmark; and [[Stockholm]], Sweden. He then returned to sea duty, again in destroyers in European waters, in command of {{USS|Dale|DD-290|6}} and {{USS|Osborne|DD-295|6}}. Upon his return to the U.S. in 1927, he served one year as executive officer of the battleship {{USS|Wyoming|BB-32|6}}, and then for three years in command of {{USS|Reina Mercedes|IX-25|6}}, the station ship at the Naval Academy. Then-[[Captain (naval)|Captain]] Halsey continued his destroyer duty on his next two-year stint at sea, starting in 1930 as the Commander of Destroyer Division Three of the Scouting Force, before returning to study at the [[Naval War College]] in Newport, Rhode Island.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq36-5.htm |title = Fleet Admiral William Frederick Halsey Jr. |publisher=[[Naval Historical Center]] }}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the chief of the [[Bureau of Aeronautics]], Navy Admiral [[Ernest King]], offered Halsey command of the aircraft carrier {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}}, subject to completion of the course of an air observer. Halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full 12-week [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviator]] course rather than the simpler Naval Aviation Observer program. \"I thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to just sit back and be at the mercy of the pilot,\" said Halsey at the time. Halsey earned his Naval Aviator's Wings on May 15, 1935, at the age of 52, the oldest person to do so in the history of the U.S. Navy. While he had approval from his wife to train as an observer, she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training, and she told her daughter, \"What do you think that the old fool is doing now? He's learning to fly!\"<ref>Borneman, p. 157.</ref> He went on to command the USS ''Saratoga'', and later the [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]] at [[Pensacola, Florida]]. Halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy, commenting, \"The naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation, and good.\" Halsey was promoted to [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]] in 1938. During this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the Aircraft Battle Force.\n\n==World War II==\nTraditional naval doctrine envisioned naval combat fought between opposing battleship gun lines. This view was challenged when Army Air Corps General [[Billy Mitchell]] demonstrated the capability of aircraft to substantially damage and sink even the most heavily armored naval vessel. In the interwar debate that followed, some saw the carrier as defensive in nature, providing air cover to protect the battle group from shore-based aircraft. Carrier-based aircraft were lighter in design and had not been shown to be as lethal. The adage \"Capital ships cannot withstand land-based air power\" was well known.<ref>Morison, ''The Rising Sun in the Pacific'', p. 190.</ref> Aviation proponents, however, imagined bringing the fight to the enemy with the use of air power.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wildenberg |first=Thomas |url = http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/sheerluck_midway.htm |title=Midway: Sheer Luck or Better Doctrine? |journal=Naval College War Review |date=Winter 2005 |volume=58 |number=1 }} Wildenberg quotes Browning's thesis: \"Every carrier we have knows what it means to be 'bopped' with all planes on deck, because her hands were tied by uncertainty as to her next move...\"</ref> Halsey was a firm believer in the aircraft carrier as the primary naval offensive weapon system. When he testified at [[Husband E. Kimmel|Admiral Husband Kimmel's]] hearing after the Pearl Harbor debacle he summed up American carrier tactics being to \"get to the other fellow with everything you have as fast as you can and to dump it on him.\" Halsey testified he would never hesitate to use the carrier as an offensive weapon.\n\nIn April 1940, Halsey's ships, as part of Battle Fleet, moved to Hawaii and in June 1940, he was promoted to vice admiral (temporary rank), and was appointed commander Carrier Division 2 and commander Aircraft Battle Force.<ref name=wukovits2010 />\n\nWith tensions high and war imminent, U.S. Naval intelligence indicated [[Wake Island]] would be the target of a Japanese surprise attack. In response, on 28 November 1941 Admiral Kimmel ordered Halsey to take {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} to ferry aircraft to Wake Island to reinforce the Marines there. Kimmel had given Halsey \"a free hand\" to attack and destroy any Japanese military forces encountered.<ref name=wukovits2010 /> The planes flew off her deck on December 2. Highly anxious of being spotted and then jumped by the Japanese carrier force, Halsey gave orders to \"sink any shipping sighted, shoot down any plane encountered.\" Protested his operations officer, \"Goddammit, Admiral, you can't start a private war of your own! Who's going to take the responsibility?\" Said Halsey, \"I'll take it!

Above all else, he was an energetic and demanding leader who had the ability to invigorate the U.S. Navy's fighting spirit when most required.<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey''.</ref> In the early months of the war, as the nation was rocked by the fall of one western bastion after another, Halsey looked to take the fight to the enemy. Serving as commander, [[Carrier Strike Group Two#Historical background|Carrier Division 2]], aboard his flagship ''Enterprise'', Halsey led a series of hit-and-run raids against the Japanese, striking the [[Marshalls\u2013Gilberts raids|Gilbert and Marshall]] islands in February, Wake Island in March, and carrying out the [[Doolittle Raid]] in April 1942 against the Japanese capital [[Tokyo]] and other places on Japan's largest and most populous island [[Honshu]], the first air raid to strike the [[Japanese archipelago|Japanese Home Islands]], providing an important boost to American [[morale]]. Halsey's slogan, \"Hit hard, hit fast, hit often,\" soon became a byword for the Navy.\n\nHalsey returned to Pearl Harbor from his last raid on May 26, 1942, in poor health due to the extremely serious and stressful conditions at hand. He had spent nearly all of the previous six months on the bridge of the carrier ''Enterprise,'' directing the Navy's counterstrikes. [[Psoriasis]] covered a great deal of his body and caused unbearable itching, making it nearly impossible for him to sleep. Gaunt and having lost {{convert|20|lb|kg}}, he was medically ordered to the hospital in Hawaii.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Naval intelligence had strongly ascertained that the Japanese were planning an attack on the central Pacific island of Midway. Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]], [[CinCPAC|Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet]], determined to take the opportunity to engage them. Losing Midway would have been a very serious threat because the Japanese then could easily take Hawaii and threaten the west coast of the United States. The loss of his most aggressive and combat experienced carrier admiral, Halsey, on the eve of this crisis was a severe blow to Nimitz.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 85.</ref> Nimitz met with Halsey, who recommended his cruiser division commander, Rear Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance|Raymond Spruance]], to take command for the upcoming [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] operation.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 84.</ref> Nimitz considered the move, but it would mean stepping over Rear Admiral [[Frank Jack Fletcher|Frank Fletcher]] of Task Force 17, who was the senior of the two men. After interviewing Fletcher and reviewing his reports from the [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] engagement, Nimitz was convinced that Fletcher's performance was sound, and he was given the responsibility of command in the defense of Midway.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 86.</ref> Acting upon Halsey's recommendations, Nimitz then made Rear Admiral Spruance commander of Halsey's Task Force 16, comprising the carriers ''Enterprise'' and ''Hornet''. To aid Spruance, who had no experience as the commander of a carrier force, Halsey sent along his irascible chief of staff, Captain [[Miles Browning]]. The ensuing harrowing Battle of Midway was a crucial turning point in the war for the United States and a dramatic victory for the U.S. Navy.\n\nHalsey's skin condition was so serious, he was sent on the light cruiser {{USS|Detroit|CL-8|6}} to San Francisco where he was met by a leading allergist for specialized treatment.  The skin condition soon receded but Halsey was ordered to stand down for the next six weeks and relax. While detached stateside during his convalescence, he visited family and traveled to Washington D.C. In late August, he accepted a speaking engagement at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. Prior to the discussion of his raids against the Japanese positions in the Marshall Islands, Halsey informed the midshipmen before him, \"Missing the Battle of Midway has been the greatest disappointment of my career, but I am going back to the Pacific where I intend personally to have a crack at those yellow-bellied sons of bitches and their carriers,\" which was received with loud applause.<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey'', p.&nbsp;150.</ref>\n\nAt the completion of his convalescence in September 1942, Admiral Nimitz reassigned Halsey to Commander, Air Force, Pacific Fleet.\n\n===South Pacific Area Command===\n[[File:Admiral William F Halsey.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Halsey in the South Pacific.]]\n\nAfter being medically approved to return to duty, Halsey was named to command a carrier task force in the South Pacific Area. Since ''Enterprise'' was still laid up in Pearl Harbor undergoing repairs following the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]], and the other ships of Task Force 16 were still being readied, he began a familiarization trip to the south Pacific on October 15, 1942, arriving at area headquarters at [[Noum\u00e9a]] in [[New Caledonia#Second World War|New Caledonia]] on October 18. The [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal Campaign]] was at a critical juncture, with the 1st Marine Division, 11,000 men, under the combat command of Marine Major General [[Alexander Vandegrift|Alexander A. Vandegrift]] holding on by a thread around Henderson (Air) Field.  The Marines did receive additional support from the U.S. Army's 164th Regiment with a complement of 2,800 soldiers on October 13.  This addition only helped to fill some of the serious holes and was insufficient to sustain the battle of itself.\n\nDuring this critical juncture, naval support was tenuous due to Vice Admiral [[Robert L. Ghormley]]'s reticence, malaise and lackluster performance.<ref name=wukovits2010 />  Pacific Fleet commander Chester Nimitz had concluded that Vice Admiral Ghormley had become dispirited and exhausted.<ref>Morison, pp. 199\u2013207; Frank, pp. 368\u2013378; Dull, pp. 235\u2013237.</ref> Nimitz made his decision to change the [[South Pacific Area]] command while Halsey was en route. As Halsey's aircraft came to rest in Noum\u00e9a, a whaleboat came alongside carrying Ghormley's flag lieutenant. Meeting him before he could board the flagship, the lieutenant handed over a sealed envelope containing a message from Nimitz:\n\n{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | YOU WILL TAKE COMMAND OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC AREA AND SOUTH PACIFIC FORCES IMMEDIATELY<ref name=\"Morison p. 183\"/>}}\n\nThe order came as an awkward surprise to Halsey. Ghormley was a long time personal friend, and had been since their days as teammates on the football team back at Annapolis. Awkward or not, the two men carried out their directives. Halsey's command now included all ground, sea, and air forces in the South Pacific area. News of the change flashed and produced an immediate boost to morale with the beleaguered Marines, energizing his command. He was widely considered the U.S. Navy's most aggressive admiral, and with good reason. He set about assessing the situation to determine what actions were needed. Ghormley had been unsure of his command's ability to maintain the Marine toehold on Guadalcanal, and had been mindful of leaving them trapped there for a repeat of the [[Bataan Death March|Bataan Peninsula]] disaster. Halsey punctiliously made it clear he did not plan to withdraw the Marines. He not only intended to counter the Japanese efforts to dislodge them, he intended to secure the island. Above all else, he wanted to regain the initiative and take the fight to the Japanese. It was two days after Halsey had taken command in October 1942 that he gave an order that all naval officers in the South Pacific would dispense with wearing neckties with their tropical uniforms. As Richard Frank commented in his account of the Battle for Guadalcanal:\n{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | Halsey said he gave this order to conform to Army practice and for comfort. To his command it viscerally evoked the image of a brawler stripping for action and symbolized a casting off of effete elegance no more appropriate to the tropics than to war.<ref>{{cite book |title=Guadalcanal: The Definitive Account of the Landmark Battle |author=Richard Frank |year=1990 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-016561-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/guadalcanal00rich }}</ref>}}\n\nHalsey led the South Pacific command through what was for the U.S. Navy the most tenuous phase of the war. Halsey committed his limited naval forces through a series of naval battles around Guadalcanal, including the carrier engagements of the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] and the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]]. These engagements checked the Japanese advance and drained their naval forces of carrier aircraft and pilots. [[File:Nimitz and Halsey 1943.jpg|thumb|left|Admirals Nimitz and Halsey discuss South Pacific strategy in early 1943.]] In November Halsey's willingness to place at risk his command's two fast battleships in the confined waters around Guadalcanal for a night engagement paid off with the U.S. Navy winning the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], the decisive naval engagement of the Guadalcanal campaign that doomed the Japanese garrison and wrested control from the Japanese.\n\nJapanese naval aviation proved to be formidable during the Solomon campaign.<ref>Seal, Jon, and Michael Ahn. {{cite web |url = http://www.microsoft.com/games/combatfs2/articles_foss.asp |title = An Interview with Joseph Jacob 'Joe' Foss. |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060209105228/http://www.microsoft.com/games/combatfs2/articles_foss.asp |archive-date=February 9, 2006 |df=mdy-all |publisher = [[Microsoft Games Studios]] |date=March 2000 |access-date=August 3, 2011 }}</ref>  In April 1943, Halsey assigned Admiral [[Marc Mitscher]] to Commander Air, [[Solomon Islands]] (ComAirSols) where he directed a mixed bag of Army, Navy, Marine and New Zealand aircraft in the airwar over Guadalcanal and up the Solomon chain.  Said Halsey: \"I knew we'd probably catch hell from the Japs in the air.  That's why I sent Pete Mitscher up there.  Pete was a fighting fool and I knew it.\"<ref>Taylor, p. 145.</ref>\n\nTypical for the period was an exchange that occurred between Halsey and one of his staff officers in June 1943. South Pacific Command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive. As a part of the long view of winning the war taken by Nimitz, upon its arrival at Fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up, its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training. South Pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the Solomon chain. The staff officer who brought the dispatch to Halsey remarked \"If they do that to us we will have to go on the defensive.\" The admiral turned to the speaker and replied: \"As long as I have one plane and one pilot, I will stay on the offensive.\"<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey'', p.&nbsp;221.</ref>\n\nHalsey's forces spent the rest of the year [[Solomon Islands campaign|battling]] up the [[Solomon Islands]] chain to [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]].  At Bougainville the Japanese had two airfields in the southern tip of the island, and another at the northern most peninsula, with a fourth on Buki just across the northern passage.  Here, instead of landing near the Japanese airfields and taking them away against the bulk of the Japanese defenders, Halsey landed his invasion force of 14,000 Marines in [[Empress Augusta Bay]], about halfway up the west coast of Bougainville.  There he had the Seabees clear and build their own airfield.  Two days after the landing, a large cruiser force was sent down from Japan to Rabaul in preparation for a night engagement against Halsey's screening force and supply ships in Empress Augusta Bay.  The Japanese had been conserving their naval forces over the past year, but now committed a force of seven heavy cruisers, along with one light cruiser and four destroyers.  At [[Rabaul]] the force refueled in preparation for the coming night battle. Halsey had no surface forces anywhere near equivalent strength to oppose them.  The battleships {{USS|Washington|BB-56|2}}, {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|2}} and assorted cruisers had been transferred to the Central Pacific to support the upcoming invasion of Tarawa.  Other than the destroyer screen, the only force Halsey had available were the carrier airgroups on {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}} and {{USS|Princeton|CVL-23|2}}.  Rabaul was a heavily fortified port, with five airfields and extensive anti-aircraft batteries.  Other than the surprise raid at Pearl Harbor, no mission against such a target had ever been accomplished with carrier aircraft.  It was highly dangerous to the aircrews, and to the carriers as well.  With the landing in the balance, Halsey sent his two carriers to steam north through the night to get into range of Rabaul, then launch a daybreak raid on the base.  Aircraft from recently captured [[Vella Lavella]] were sent over to provide a combat air patrol over the carriers. All available aircraft from the two carriers were committed to the raid itself.  The [[Bombing of Rabaul (November 1943)|mission]] was a stunning success, so damaging the cruiser force at Rabaul as to make them no longer a threat.  Aircraft losses in the raid were light.  Halsey later described the threat to the landings as \"the most desperate emergency that confronted me in my entire term as ComSoPac.\"<ref>Potter, ''Admiral Arleigh Burke'', pp.&nbsp;98\u201399.</ref>\n\nFollowing the successful Bougainville operation, he then isolated and neutralized the Japanese naval stronghold at Rabaul by capturing surrounding positions in the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] in a series of amphibious landings known as [[Operation Cartwheel]]. This enabled the continuation of the drive north without the heavy fighting that would have been necessary to capture the base itself.  With the neutralization of Rabaul, major operations in the South Pacific Command came to a close.  With his determination and grit, Halsey had bolstered his command's resolve and seized the initiative from the Japanese until ships, aircraft and crews produced and trained in the States could arrive in 1943 and 1944 to tip the scales of the war in favor of the allies.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 416\u2013430.</ref>\n\n===Battles of the Central Pacific===\n[[File:VAdm John S.

McCain Sr.]] on board Halsey's flagship, {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|6}} in December 1944]]As the war progressed it moved out of the South Pacific and into the Central Pacific. Halsey's command shifted with it, and in May 1944 he was promoted to commanding officer of the newly formed [[U.S. Third Fleet|Third Fleet]]. He commanded actions from the [[Philippines]] to Japan. From September 1944 to January 1945, he led the campaigns to take the [[Palaus]], [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] and [[Luzon]], and on many raids on Japanese bases, including off the shores of Formosa, China, and Vietnam.\n\nBy this point in the conflict the U.S. Navy was doing things the Japanese high command had not thought possible. The [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] was able to bring to battle enough air power to overpower land based aircraft and dominate whatever area the fleet was operating in. Moreover, the Navy's ability to establish [[USS Cascade (AD-16)#Service Squadron 4 and Service Squadron 10|forward operating ports]] as they did at [[Majuro#History|Majuro]], [[Enewetak Atoll#History|Enewetak]] and [[Ulithi#History|Ulithi]], and their ability to convoy supplies out to the combat task forces, allowed the fleet to operate for extended periods of time far out to sea in the central and western Pacific. The Japanese Navy conserved itself in port and would sortie in force to engage the enemy. The U.S. Navy remained at sea and on station, dominating whatever region it entered. The size of the Pacific Ocean, which Japanese planners had thought would limit the U.S. Navy's ability to operate in the western Pacific, would not be adequate to protect Japan.\n\nCommand of the \"big blue fleet\" was alternated with [[Raymond Spruance]].{{NoteTag|The \"Big Blue Fleet\" was the name given to the main fleet of the US Navy in the Pacific.  The term stems from pre-war planning, called the color plans because each nation included was given a color code name. In these potential plans the British navy was red, the German navy black, and so forth. The Imperial Japanese Navy was termed the \"Orange Fleet\".  The U.S. fleet was the \"Blue Fleet\".  The \"Big Blue Fleet\" was the massive fleet that the U.S. Navy anticipated they would win the war with.  It was thought this fleet would largely come into being by late 1943, early 1944.<ref name=\"Potter p. 112\" />}}  Under Spruance the fleet designation was the [[U.S. Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleet]] and the Fast Carrier Task Force was designated \"Task Force 58\". Under Halsey the fleet was designated Third Fleet and the Fast Carrier Task Force was designated \"Task Force 38\".<ref name=\"Potter p. 112\" /> The split command structure was intended to confuse the Japanese and created a higher tempo of operations. While Spruance was at sea operating the fleet, Halsey and his staff, self-dubbed the \"Department of Dirty Tricks\", would be planning the next series of operations.<ref>Cutler, ''The Battle of Leyte Gulf'', p. 209.</ref> The two admirals were a contrast in styles. Halsey was aggressive and a risk taker. Spruance was calculating, professional and cautious. Most higher-ranking officers preferred to serve under Spruance; most common sailors were proud to serve under Halsey.<ref>{{cite book |title=America's Fighting Admirals:Winning the War at Sea in World War II |last=Tuohy |first=William |publisher=Zenith Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/americasfighting00tuoh/page/323 323] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7603-2985-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/americasfighting00tuoh/page/323 }}</ref>\n\n====Leyte Gulf====\n[[File:Halsey messing with crew.jpg|thumb|right|Halsey dines with crew of USS ''New Jersey'' (November 1944)]]\nIn October 1944, amphibious forces of the U.S. [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] carried out [[Douglas MacArthur|General Douglas MacArthur's]] major landings on the island of [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] in the Central Philippines. Halsey's Third Fleet was assigned to cover and support Seventh Fleet operations around Leyte. Halsey's plans assumed the Japanese fleet or a major portion of it would challenge the effort, creating an opportunity to engage it decisively. Halsey directed the Third Fleet \"will seek the enemy and attempt to bring about a decisive engagement if he undertakes operations beyond support of superior land based air forces.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/9fe423c2-9276-41c7-be29-04260b8a04c3/Replacing-Battleships-with-Aircraft-Carriers-in-th|last=Hone|first=Thomas|title=Replacing Battleships with Aircraft Carriers in the Pacific in World War II|work=Naval War College Review|date=Winter 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2017|p=71}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the invasion, the Japanese launched their final major naval effort, an operation known as 'Sho-Go', involving almost all their surviving fleet. It was aimed at destroying the invasion shipping in the [[Leyte Gulf]]. The Northern Force of Admiral Ozawa was built around the remaining Japanese aircraft carriers, now weakened by the heavy loss of trained pilots. The Northern Force was meant to lure the covering U.S. forces away from the Gulf while two surface battle-groups, the Center Force and the Southern Force, were to break through to the beachhead and attack the invasion shipping. These forces were built around the remaining strength of the Japanese Navy, and comprised a total of 7 battleships and 16 cruisers. The operation brought about the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Battle for Leyte Gulf]], the largest naval battle of the Second World War and, by some criteria, the [[largest naval battle in history]].\n\nThe Center Force commanded by Vice Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]] was located October 23 coming through the Palawan Passage by two American submarines, which [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#The submarine action in Palawan Passage .2823 October.29|attacked the force]], sinking two heavy cruisers and damaging a third. The following day Third Fleet's aircraft carriers launched strikes against Kurita's Center Force, [[Battle of the Sibuyan Sea|sinking]] the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}} and damaging the heavy cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|My\u014dk\u014d||2}}, causing the force to turn westward back towards its base. Kurita appeared to be retiring but he later reversed course and headed back into the [[San Bernardino Strait]]. At this point Ozawa's Northern Force was located by Third Fleet scout aircraft. Halsey made the momentous decision to take all available strength northwards to destroy the Japanese carrier forces, planning to strike them at dawn of October 25. He considered leaving a battle group behind to guard the strait, and made tentative plans to do so, but he felt he would also have to leave one of his three carrier groups to provide air cover, weakening his chance to crush the remaining Japanese carrier forces. The entire Third Fleet steamed northward. San Bernardino Strait was effectively left unguarded by any major surface fleet.\n\n====Battle off Samar====\nIn moving Third Fleet northwards, Halsey failed to advise Admiral [[Thomas C. Kinkaid|Thomas Kinkaid]] of Seventh Fleet of his decision. Seventh Fleet intercepts of organizational messages from Halsey to his own task group commanders seemed to indicate that Halsey had formed a task force and detached it to protect the San Bernardino Strait, but this was not the case. Kinkaid and his staff failed to confirm this with Halsey, and neither had confirmed this with Nimitz.\n\nDespite aerial reconnaissance reports on the night of October 24\u201325 of Kurita's Center Force in the San Bernardino Strait, Halsey continued to take Third Fleet northwards, away from Leyte Gulf.\n\n[[File:Halsey Mccain.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Halsey with Vice Admiral [[John S. McCain Sr.]]]]\n\nWhen Kurita's Center Force emerged from the San Bernardino Strait on the morning of October 25, there was nothing to oppose them except a small force of escort carriers and screening destroyers and [[destroyer escort]]s, Task Unit 77.4.3 \"Taffy 3\", which had been tasked and armed to attack troops on land and guard against submarines, not oppose the largest enemy surface fleet since the battle of Midway, led by the largest battleship in the world. Advancing down the coast of the island of Samar towards the troop transports and support ships of the Leyte Gulf landing, they took Seventh Fleet's escort carriers and their screening ships entirely by surprise.\n\nIn the desperate [[Battle off Samar]] which followed, Kurita's ships destroyed one of the escort carriers and three ships of the carriers' screen, and damaged a number of other ships as well. The remarkable resistance of the screening ships of Taffy 3 against Kurita's battle-group remains one of the most heroic feats in the history of the US Navy. Their efforts and those of the several hundred aircraft that the escort carriers could put up, many of whom, however could not be armed with the most effective ordinance to deal with heavy surface ships in time, took a heavy toll on Kurita's ships and convinced him that he was facing a stronger force than was the case. Mistaking the escort carriers for Halsey's fleet carriers, and fearing entrapment from the six battleships of the Third Fleet battleship group, he decided to withdraw back through the San Bernardino Strait and to the west without achieving his objective of disrupting the Leyte landing.\n\nWhen the Seventh Fleet's escort carriers found themselves under attack from the Center Force, Halsey began to receive a succession of desperate calls from Kinkaid asking for immediate assistance off Samar. For over two hours Halsey turned a deaf ear to these calls. Then, shortly after 10:00 hours,<ref name=\"Willmott\">{{cite book |last=Willmott|first=H. P. |title = The Battle of Leyte Gulf: The Last Fleet Action |publisher=Indiana University Press |pages=192\u2013197 |chapter=Six, The Great Day of Wrath |year=2005 |isbn = 9780253345288 }}</ref> a message was received from Admiral Nimitz: \"Where is repeat where is Task Force 34? The world wonders\". The tail end of this message, [[The world wonders]], was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders, but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to Halsey. The urgent inquiry had seemingly become a stinging rebuke. The fiery Halsey threw his hat on the deck of the bridge and began cursing.<ref name=\"Willmott\"/> Finally Halsey's Chief of Staff, Rear Admiral [[Robert Carney|Robert \"Mick\" Carney]], confronted him, telling Halsey \"Stop it! What the hell's the matter with you? Pull yourself together.\"<ref name=\"Books: The General and the Admiral\"/>\n\nHalsey cooled but continued to steam Third Fleet northward to close on Ozawa's Northern Force for a full hour after receiving the signal from Nimitz.<ref name=\"Willmott\"/> Then, Halsey ordered Task Force 34 south. As Task Force 34 proceeded south they were further delayed when the battle force had to slow to 12 knots so that the battleships could refuel their escorting destroyers. The refueling cost a two and a half hour further delay.<ref name=\"Willmott\"/> By the time Task Force 34 arrived at the scene it was too late to assist the Seventh Fleet's escort carrier groups. Kurita had already decided to retire and had left the area. A single straggling destroyer was caught by Halsey's advance cruisers and destroyers, but the rest of Kurita's force was able to escape.\n\nMeanwhile the major part Third Fleet continued to close on Ozawa's Northern Force, which included one fleet carrier (the last surviving Japanese carrier of the six that had attacked Pearl Harbor) and three light carriers. The [[Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o]] resulted in Halsey's Third Fleet sinking all four of Ozawa's carriers.\n\nThe same attributes that made Halsey an invaluable leader in the desperate early months of the war, his desire to bring the fight to the enemy, his willingness to take on a gamble, worked against him in the later stages of the war. Halsey received much criticism for his decisions during the battle, with naval historian [[Samuel Eliot Morison|Samuel Morison]] terming the Third Fleet run to the north \"Halsey's Blunder.\"<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey'', pp. 376\u2013380.</ref> However, the destruction of the Japanese carriers had been an important goal up to that point, and the Leyte landings were still successful despite Halsey falling for the Japanese Navy's decoy.\n\n=== Halsey's Typhoon ===\n{{Main|Typhoon Cobra (1944)}}\n\n[[File:USS Langley (CVL-27) during Typhoon Cobra, December 1944.jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|Langley|CVL-27|6}} struggles in Typhoon Cobra.]]\n\nAfter the Leyte Gulf engagement, December found the Third Fleet confronted with another powerful enemy in the form of [[Typhoon Cobra]], which was dubbed \"Halsey's Typhoon\" by many.\n\nWhile conducting operations off the Philippines, the fleet had to discontinue refueling due to a Pacific storm. Rather than move Third Fleet away, Halsey chose to remain on station for another day. In fairness, he received conflicting information from Pearl Harbor and his own staff. The Hawaiian weathermen predicted a northerly path for the storm, which would have cleared Task Force 38 by some {{convert|200|mi|km|spell=in}}. Eventually his own staff provided a prediction regarding the direction of the storm that was far closer to the mark with a westerly direction. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/william-bull-halsey-legendary-world-war-ii-admiral.htm |title=William Bull Halsey: Legendary World War II Admiral |author=Barrett Tillman |work=historynet.com |date=July 2007}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Halsey played the odds, declining to cancel planned operations and requiring the ships of Third Fleet to hold formation. On the evening of December 17 Third Fleet was unable to land its combat air patrol due to the pitching and rolling decks of the carriers. All the aircraft were ditched in the ocean and lost, but the pilots were all saved by accompanying destroyers. By 10:00&nbsp;a.m. the next morning the barometer on the flagship was noted to be dropping precipitously. With increasingly heavy seas the fleet still attempted to maintain stations. The threat was greatest to the fleet's destroyers, which did not have the fuel reserves of the larger ships and were running dangerously low. Finally, at 11:49&nbsp;a.m., Halsey issued the order for the ships of the fleet to take the most comfortable course available to them. Many of the smaller ships had already been forced to do so. \n\nBetween 11:00&nbsp;a.m. and 2:00&nbsp;p.m., the typhoon did its worst damage, tossing the ships in {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on|0}} waves. The barometer continued to drop and the wind roared at {{convert|83|kn|kph|lk=in|0}} with gusts well over {{convert|100|kn|kph|0}}. At 1:45&nbsp;p.m. Halsey issued a typhoon warning to Fleet Weather Central. By this time Third Fleet had lost three of its destroyers. By the time the storm had cleared the next day a great many ships in the fleet had been damaged, 146 aircraft were destroyed and 802 seamen had been lost. For the next three days Third Fleet conducted search and rescue operations, finally retiring to [[Ulithi]] on 22 December 1944.\n\nFollowing the typhoon a Navy court of inquiry was convened on board {{USS|Cascade|AD-16|6}} in the Naval base at Ulithi. Admiral Nimitz, CINCPAC, was in attendance at the court. Forty-three-year-old Captain Herbert K. Gates, of ''Cascade'', was the Judge Advocate.<ref>Drury.</ref> The inquiry found that though Halsey had committed an error of judgement in sailing the Third Fleet into the heart of the typhoon, it stopped short of unambiguously recommending sanction.<ref name=\"Melton, Sea Cobra\">Melton, ''Sea Cobra''.</ref> The events surrounding Typhoon Cobra were similar to those the Japanese navy had faced some nine years earlier in what they termed \"[[4th Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)#The Fourth Fleet incident|The Fourth Fleet Incident]].\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Kaigun: Strategy, Tactics and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy 1887\u20131941 |last1=Evans |first1=David |last2=Peattie |first2=Mark|publisher=Naval Institute Press |page=243 |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-87021-192-8}}</ref>\n\n===End of the war===\n[[File:Nimitz missouri.jpg|thumb|Fleet Admiral Nimitz signing the documents of surrender on board USS ''Missouri''. Behind him stand Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Rear Adm. Forrest Sherman, and Halsey (''middle'').]]\nDuring January 1945 the Third Fleet attacked Formosa and Luzon, and [[South China Sea raid|raided the South China Sea]] in support of the landing of US Army forces on Luzon. At the conclusion of this operation, Halsey passed command of the ships that made up Third Fleet to Admiral Spruance on January 26, whereupon its designation changed to [[United States Fifth Fleet#History|Fifth Fleet]]. Returning home Halsey was asked about General MacArthur, who was not the easiest man to work with, and vied with the Navy over the conduct and management of the war in the Pacific.<ref>Willmott, pp. 178\u2013181.</ref> Halsey had worked well with MacArthur and did not mind saying so. When a reporter asked Halsey if he thought MacArthur's fleet (7th Fleet) would get to Tokyo first, the admiral grinned and answered \"We're going there together.\"  Then seriously he added \"He's a very fine man. I have worked under him for over two years and have the greatest admiration and respect for him.\"<ref>''Utica Daily Press'', February 20, 1945.</ref>\n\nSpruance held command of Fifth Fleet until May, when command returned to Halsey. In early June 1945 the Third Fleet again sailed through the path of [[Typhoon Connie]]. On this occasion, six men were swept overboard and lost, along with 75 airplanes lost or destroyed, with another 70 badly damaged. Though some ships sustained significant damage, none were lost.  A Navy court of inquiry was again convened, this time recommending that Halsey be reassigned, but Admiral Nimitz declined to abide by this recommendation, citing Halsey's prior service record, despite that record including a previous instance of negligently sailing his fleet through a typhoon.<ref name=\"Melton, Sea Cobra\" />\n\nHalsey led Third Fleet through the final stages of the war, striking targets on the Japanese homeland itself. Third Fleet aircraft conducted attacks upon Tokyo, the [[Bombing of Kure (July 1945)|naval base at Kure]] and the northern Japanese island of [[Hokkaid\u014d]], and Third Fleet battleships engaged in the [[Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II|bombardment of a number of Japanese coastal cities]] in preparation for an invasion of Japan, which ultimately never had to be undertaken.\n\nAfter the cessation of hostilities, Halsey, still aggressively cautious of Japanese kamikaze attacks, ordered Third Fleet to maintain a protective air cover with the following communiqu\u00e9: {{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | Cessation of hostilities.<br />War is over. <br />If any Japanese airplanes appear, shoot them down in a friendly way.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Caviar and Commissars: the Experience of a US Naval Officer in Stalin's Russia |author=Kemp Tolley |page=245|publisher=Naval Institute Press |year=1983 |isbn=978-1-55750-407-4}}</ref>}}\nHe was present when [[Surrender of Japan|Japan formally surrendered]] on the deck of his [[flagship]], {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}, on September 2, 1945.\n\n==Postwar years==\n[[File:Halsey.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Halsey]]\nImmediately after the surrender of Japan, 54 ships of the Third Fleet returned to the United States, with Halsey's four-star flag flying from USS ''South Dakota'', for the annual Navy Day Celebrations in San Francisco on October 27, 1945. He hauled down his flag on 22 November 1945, and was assigned special duty in the office of the Secretary of the Navy. On December 11, 1945, he took the oath as [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]], becoming the fourth and still the most recent naval officer awarded that rank. Halsey made a goodwill flying trip, passing by [[Central America|Central]] and South America, covering nearly {{convert|28,000|mi}} and 11 nations. He retired from active service in March 1947, but as a Fleet Admiral, he was not taken off active duty status.\n\nHalsey was asked about the weapons used to win the war and he answered:\n{{Quote | style = font-size: 100%; | If I had to give credit to the instruments and machines that won us the war in the Pacific, I would rate them in this order: submarines first, radar second, planes third, bulldozers fourth.<ref>{{cite book |title = Admiral Halsey's Story |first=William |last=Halsey |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1947|page=69 |isbn = 978-1-4367-1143-2 }}</ref>}}\n\nHalsey joined the New Jersey Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]] in 1946. Upon retirement, he joined the board of two subsidiaries of the [[International Telephone and Telegraph Company]], including the [[American Cable and Radio Corporation]], and served until 1957. He maintained an office near the top of the ITT Building at 67 Broad Street, New York City in the late 1950s. He was involved in a number of efforts to preserve his former flagship {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} as a memorial in [[New York Harbor]]. They proved fruitless, as it was not possible to secure sufficient funding to preserve the ship.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Fleet Admiral William Frederick Halsey Jr. (19351365942).jpg|thumb|Halsey's grave at Arlington National Cemetery]]\n\nHalsey died on August 16, 1959, while on holiday on [[Fishers Island, New York]].<ref name=mjapobt>{{cite news |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=c9cjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wyUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7080%2C3200658 |work=Milwaukee Journal |agency=Associated Press |title=Admiral Halsey dies; beat Japanese fleet |date=August 17, 1959 |page=4, part 1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.kxmb.com/News/418118.asp |title = Following Advance for Use Sunday, Aug. 16 &#124; |website = KXNet.com North Dakota News }}</ref> After lying in state in the [[Washington National Cathedral]], he was interred on August 20, 1959, near his parents in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

Wouk was extremely critical of Halsey's handling of the battle at Leyte Gulf, but also said he was too great a builder of naval morale to be retired in disgrace.  (Chapter 92)  Halsey was portrayed in the 1983 television [[miniseries]] adaptation of ''The Winds of War'' by [[Richard X. Slattery]], and in the 1988 miniseries adaptation of ''War and Remembrance'' by [[Pat Hingle]].\n* Halsey has been portrayed in a number of other films and TV miniseries, played by [[Glenn Morshower]] ([[Pearl Harbor (film)|''Pearl Harbor'']], 2001), [[Kenneth Tobey]] (''[[MacArthur (film)|MacArthur]]'', 1977), [[Jack Diamond (actor)|Jack Diamond]] (''[[Battle Stations (1956 film)|Battle Stations]]'', 1956), [[John Maxwell (actor)|John Maxwell]], (''[[The Eternal Sea]]'', 1955) and [[Morris Ankrum]] (''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'', 1944).\n* An \"Admiral Halsey\" is mentioned in the [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] and [[Linda McCartney]] song \"[[Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey]]\". The chorus of \"hands across the water, heads across the sky\" was a reference to the American aid programs of World War II.

Soviet submarine commander Marko Ramius, while engaged in battle with the Soviet attack submarine ''Konovalov'', asks [[Jack Ryan (Tom Clancy character)|Jack Ryan]] what books he wrote for the CIA. Ryan mentions one about Admiral Halsey, entitled ''The Fighting Sailor'' (not to be confused with a real book of the same title); Ramius reveals his awareness of the book and expresses disdain for Ryan's assessment of Halsey, saying, \"Your conclusions were all wrong, Ryan. Halsey acted stupidly.\"\n* The fictional aircraft carrier USS ''William Halsey'' in [[Darren Sapp]]'s novel, ''[[Fire on the Flight Deck]]'', is named for Halsey.\n* On May 30, 2018, he was added as an unlockable unique commander for the United States Navy in the videogame [[World of Warships]].\n* A character in [[Seth MacFarlane]]'s ''[[The Orville]]'' is named Admiral Halsey, presumably after Admiral Halsey.\n* Halsey appears as a purchasable general in the Easytech mobile game ''[[World Conqueror 4]]''.\n\n\u2022   In ''Bridge over the River Kwai'', William Holden feigning madness replies, \u201cI'm getting worse, you know.

He served in the [[Great White Fleet]] and, during [[World War I]], commanded the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Shaw|DD-68|6}}. He took command of the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}} in 1935 after completing a course in naval aviation, and was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in 1938. At the start of the [[Pacific War|War in the Pacific]] (1941\u20131945), Halsey commanded the task force centered on the carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} in a series of raids against [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]-held targets. \n\nHalsey was made commander, [[South Pacific Area]], and led the Allied forces over the course of the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Battle for Guadalcanal]] (1942\u201343) and the [[Solomon Islands campaign|fighting up the Solomon chain]] (1942\u201345).<ref name=\"Morison p. 183\">Morison, ''The Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p. 183.</ref>  In 1943 he was made commander of the [[United States Third Fleet|Third Fleet]], the post he held through the rest of the war.<ref name=\"Potter p. 112\">Potter, p.&nbsp;112.</ref> He took part in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Battle for Leyte Gulf]], the largest naval battle of the Second World War and, by some criteria, the [[largest naval battle in history]].

Halsey was on the bridge of the battleship {{USS|Missouri|BB-11|6}} on April 13, 1904, when a flareback from the port gun in her after turret ignited a powder charge and set off two others. No explosion occurred, but the rapid burning of the powder burnt and suffocated to death 31 officers and enlisted sailors. This resulted in Halsey dreading the 13th of every month, especially when it fell on a Friday.<ref>Borneman, p.&nbsp;47.</ref>\n\nAfter his service on ''Missouri'', Halsey served aboard torpedo boats, beginning with {{USS|Du Pont|TB-7|6}} in 1909.

Halsey commanded a number of torpedo boats and [[destroyer]]s during the 1910s and 1920s. At that time, the destroyer and the torpedo boat, though extremely hazardous delivery methods, were the most effective way to bring the torpedo into combat against capital ships. Then-[[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Halsey's World War I service, including command of {{USS|Shaw|DD-68|6}} in 1918, earned him the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]].\n\n== Interwar years ==\nIn October 1922, he was the [[Naval Attach\u00e9|naval attach\u00e9]] at the American Embassy in [[Berlin]], Germany. One year later, he was given additional duty as naval attach\u00e9 at the American Embassies in [[Oslo|Christiania]], Norway; [[Copenhagen]], Denmark; and [[Stockholm]], Sweden. He then returned to sea duty, again in destroyers in European waters, in command of {{USS|Dale|DD-290|6}} and {{USS|Osborne|DD-295|6}}. Upon his return to the U.S. in 1927, he served one year as executive officer of the battleship {{USS|Wyoming|BB-32|6}}, and then for three years in command of {{USS|Reina Mercedes|IX-25|6}}, the station ship at the Naval Academy. Then-[[Captain (naval)|Captain]] Halsey continued his destroyer duty on his next two-year stint at sea, starting in 1930 as the Commander of Destroyer Division Three of the Scouting Force, before returning to study at the [[Naval War College]] in Newport, Rhode Island.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq36-5.htm |title = Fleet Admiral William Frederick Halsey Jr. |publisher=[[Naval Historical Center]] }}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the chief of the [[Bureau of Aeronautics]], Navy Admiral [[Ernest King]], offered Halsey command of the aircraft carrier {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}}, subject to completion of the course of an air observer. Halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full 12-week [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviator]] course rather than the simpler Naval Aviation Observer program. \"I thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to just sit back and be at the mercy of the pilot,\" said Halsey at the time. Halsey earned his Naval Aviator's Wings on May 15, 1935, at the age of 52, the oldest person to do so in the history of the U.S. Navy. While he had approval from his wife to train as an observer, she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training, and she told her daughter, \"What do you think that the old fool is doing now?

Halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy, commenting, \"The naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation, and good.\" Halsey was promoted to [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]] in 1938. During this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the Aircraft Battle Force.\n\n==World War II==\nTraditional naval doctrine envisioned naval combat fought between opposing battleship gun lines. This view was challenged when Army Air Corps General [[Billy Mitchell]] demonstrated the capability of aircraft to substantially damage and sink even the most heavily armored naval vessel. In the interwar debate that followed, some saw the carrier as defensive in nature, providing air cover to protect the battle group from shore-based aircraft. Carrier-based aircraft were lighter in design and had not been shown to be as lethal. The adage \"Capital ships cannot withstand land-based air power\" was well known.<ref>Morison, ''The Rising Sun in the Pacific'', p. 190.</ref> Aviation proponents, however, imagined bringing the fight to the enemy with the use of air power.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wildenberg |first=Thomas |url = http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/sheerluck_midway.htm |title=Midway: Sheer Luck or Better Doctrine? |journal=Naval College War Review |date=Winter 2005 |volume=58 |number=1 }} Wildenberg quotes Browning's thesis: \"Every carrier we have knows what it means to be 'bopped' with all planes on deck, because her hands were tied by uncertainty as to her next move...\"</ref> Halsey was a firm believer in the aircraft carrier as the primary naval offensive weapon system. When he testified at [[Husband E.

Above all else, he was an energetic and demanding leader who had the ability to invigorate the U.S. Navy's fighting spirit when most required.<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey''.</ref> In the early months of the war, as the nation was rocked by the fall of one western bastion after another, Halsey looked to take the fight to the enemy. Serving as commander, [[Carrier Strike Group Two#Historical background|Carrier Division 2]], aboard his flagship ''Enterprise'', Halsey led a series of hit-and-run raids against the Japanese, striking the [[Marshalls\u2013Gilberts raids|Gilbert and Marshall]] islands in February, Wake Island in March, and carrying out the [[Doolittle Raid]] in April 1942 against the Japanese capital [[Tokyo]] and other places on Japan's largest and most populous island [[Honshu]], the first air raid to strike the [[Japanese archipelago|Japanese Home Islands]], providing an important boost to American [[morale]]. Halsey's slogan, \"Hit hard, hit fast, hit often,\" soon became a byword for the Navy.\n\nHalsey returned to Pearl Harbor from his last raid on May 26, 1942, in poor health due to the extremely serious and stressful conditions at hand. He had spent nearly all of the previous six months on the bridge of the carrier ''Enterprise,'' directing the Navy's counterstrikes. [[Psoriasis]] covered a great deal of his body and caused unbearable itching, making it nearly impossible for him to sleep. Gaunt and having lost {{convert|20|lb|kg}}, he was medically ordered to the hospital in Hawaii.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Naval intelligence had strongly ascertained that the Japanese were planning an attack on the central Pacific island of Midway. Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]], [[CinCPAC|Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet]], determined to take the opportunity to engage them. Losing Midway would have been a very serious threat because the Japanese then could easily take Hawaii and threaten the west coast of the United States. The loss of his most aggressive and combat experienced carrier admiral, Halsey, on the eve of this crisis was a severe blow to Nimitz.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 85.</ref> Nimitz met with Halsey, who recommended his cruiser division commander, Rear Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance|Raymond Spruance]], to take command for the upcoming [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] operation.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 84.</ref> Nimitz considered the move, but it would mean stepping over Rear Admiral [[Frank Jack Fletcher|Frank Fletcher]] of Task Force 17, who was the senior of the two men. After interviewing Fletcher and reviewing his reports from the [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] engagement, Nimitz was convinced that Fletcher's performance was sound, and he was given the responsibility of command in the defense of Midway.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 86.</ref> Acting upon Halsey's recommendations, Nimitz then made Rear Admiral Spruance commander of Halsey's Task Force 16, comprising the carriers ''Enterprise'' and ''Hornet''. To aid Spruance, who had no experience as the commander of a carrier force, Halsey sent along his irascible chief of staff, Captain [[Miles Browning]]. The ensuing harrowing Battle of Midway was a crucial turning point in the war for the United States and a dramatic victory for the U.S. Navy.\n\nHalsey's skin condition was so serious, he was sent on the light cruiser {{USS|Detroit|CL-8|6}} to San Francisco where he was met by a leading allergist for specialized treatment.  The skin condition soon receded but Halsey was ordered to stand down for the next six weeks and relax. While detached stateside during his convalescence, he visited family and traveled to Washington D.C. In late August, he accepted a speaking engagement at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. Prior to the discussion of his raids against the Japanese positions in the Marshall Islands, Halsey informed the midshipmen before him, \"Missing the Battle of Midway has been the greatest disappointment of my career, but I am going back to the Pacific where I intend personally to have a crack at those yellow-bellied sons of bitches and their carriers,\" which was received with loud applause.<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey'', p.&nbsp;150.</ref>\n\nAt the completion of his convalescence in September 1942, Admiral Nimitz reassigned Halsey to Commander, Air Force, Pacific Fleet.\n\n===South Pacific Area Command===\n[[File:Admiral William F Halsey.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Halsey in the South Pacific.]]\n\nAfter being medically approved to return to duty, Halsey was named to command a carrier task force in the South Pacific Area. Since ''Enterprise'' was still laid up in Pearl Harbor undergoing repairs following the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]], and the other ships of Task Force 16 were still being readied, he began a familiarization trip to the south Pacific on October 15, 1942, arriving at area headquarters at [[Noum\u00e9a]] in [[New Caledonia#Second World War|New Caledonia]] on October 18. The [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal Campaign]] was at a critical juncture, with the 1st Marine Division, 11,000 men, under the combat command of Marine Major General [[Alexander Vandegrift|Alexander A. Vandegrift]] holding on by a thread around Henderson (Air) Field.  The Marines did receive additional support from the U.S. Army's 164th Regiment with a complement of 2,800 soldiers on October 13.  This addition only helped to fill some of the serious holes and was insufficient to sustain the battle of itself.\n\nDuring this critical juncture, naval support was tenuous due to Vice Admiral [[Robert L. Ghormley]]'s reticence, malaise and lackluster performance.<ref name=wukovits2010 />  Pacific Fleet commander Chester Nimitz had concluded that Vice Admiral Ghormley had become dispirited and exhausted.<ref>Morison, pp. 199\u2013207; Frank, pp. 368\u2013378; Dull, pp. 235\u2013237.</ref> Nimitz made his decision to change the [[South Pacific Area]] command while Halsey was en route. As Halsey's aircraft came to rest in Noum\u00e9a, a whaleboat came alongside carrying Ghormley's flag lieutenant. Meeting him before he could board the flagship, the lieutenant handed over a sealed envelope containing a message from Nimitz:\n\n{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | YOU WILL TAKE COMMAND OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC AREA AND SOUTH PACIFIC FORCES IMMEDIATELY<ref name=\"Morison p. 183\"/>}}\n\nThe order came as an awkward surprise to Halsey. Ghormley was a long time personal friend, and had been since their days as teammates on the football team back at Annapolis. Awkward or not, the two men carried out their directives. Halsey's command now included all ground, sea, and air forces in the South Pacific area. News of the change flashed and produced an immediate boost to morale with the beleaguered Marines, energizing his command. He was widely considered the U.S. Navy's most aggressive admiral, and with good reason. He set about assessing the situation to determine what actions were needed. Ghormley had been unsure of his command's ability to maintain the Marine toehold on Guadalcanal, and had been mindful of leaving them trapped there for a repeat of the [[Bataan Death March|Bataan Peninsula]] disaster. Halsey punctiliously made it clear he did not plan to withdraw the Marines. He not only intended to counter the Japanese efforts to dislodge them, he intended to secure the island. Above all else, he wanted to regain the initiative and take the fight to the Japanese. It was two days after Halsey had taken command in October 1942 that he gave an order that all naval officers in the South Pacific would dispense with wearing neckties with their tropical uniforms. As Richard Frank commented in his account of the Battle for Guadalcanal:\n{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | Halsey said he gave this order to conform to Army practice and for comfort. To his command it viscerally evoked the image of a brawler stripping for action and symbolized a casting off of effete elegance no more appropriate to the tropics than to war.<ref>{{cite book |title=Guadalcanal: The Definitive Account of the Landmark Battle |author=Richard Frank |year=1990 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-016561-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/guadalcanal00rich }}</ref>}}\n\nHalsey led the South Pacific command through what was for the U.S. Navy the most tenuous phase of the war. Halsey committed his limited naval forces through a series of naval battles around Guadalcanal, including the carrier engagements of the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] and the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]]. These engagements checked the Japanese advance and drained their naval forces of carrier aircraft and pilots. [[File:Nimitz and Halsey 1943.jpg|thumb|left|Admirals Nimitz and Halsey discuss South Pacific strategy in early 1943.]] In November Halsey's willingness to place at risk his command's two fast battleships in the confined waters around Guadalcanal for a night engagement paid off with the U.S. Navy winning the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], the decisive naval engagement of the Guadalcanal campaign that doomed the Japanese garrison and wrested control from the Japanese.\n\nJapanese naval aviation proved to be formidable during the Solomon campaign.<ref>Seal, Jon, and Michael Ahn. {{cite web |url = http://www.microsoft.com/games/combatfs2/articles_foss.asp |title = An Interview with Joseph Jacob 'Joe' Foss. |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060209105228/http://www.microsoft.com/games/combatfs2/articles_foss.asp |archive-date=February 9, 2006 |df=mdy-all |publisher = [[Microsoft Games Studios]] |date=March 2000 |access-date=August 3, 2011 }}</ref>  In April 1943, Halsey assigned Admiral [[Marc Mitscher]] to Commander Air, [[Solomon Islands]] (ComAirSols) where he directed a mixed bag of Army, Navy, Marine and New Zealand aircraft in the airwar over Guadalcanal and up the Solomon chain.  Said Halsey: \"I knew we'd probably catch hell from the Japs in the air.  That's why I sent Pete Mitscher up there.  Pete was a fighting fool and I knew it.\"<ref>Taylor, p. 145.</ref>\n\nTypical for the period was an exchange that occurred between Halsey and one of his staff officers in June 1943. South Pacific Command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive. As a part of the long view of winning the war taken by Nimitz, upon its arrival at Fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up, its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training. South Pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the Solomon chain. The staff officer who brought the dispatch to Halsey remarked \"If they do that to us we will have to go on the defensive.\" The admiral turned to the speaker and replied: \"As long as I have one plane and one pilot, I will stay on the offensive.\"<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey'', p.&nbsp;221.</ref>\n\nHalsey's forces spent the rest of the year [[Solomon Islands campaign|battling]] up the [[Solomon Islands]] chain to [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]].  At Bougainville the Japanese had two airfields in the southern tip of the island, and another at the northern most peninsula, with a fourth on Buki just across the northern passage.  Here, instead of landing near the Japanese airfields and taking them away against the bulk of the Japanese defenders, Halsey landed his invasion force of 14,000 Marines in [[Empress Augusta Bay]], about halfway up the west coast of Bougainville.  There he had the Seabees clear and build their own airfield.  Two days after the landing, a large cruiser force was sent down from Japan to Rabaul in preparation for a night engagement against Halsey's screening force and supply ships in Empress Augusta Bay.  The Japanese had been conserving their naval forces over the past year, but now committed a force of seven heavy cruisers, along with one light cruiser and four destroyers.  At [[Rabaul]] the force refueled in preparation for the coming night battle. Halsey had no surface forces anywhere near equivalent strength to oppose them.  The battleships {{USS|Washington|BB-56|2}}, {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|2}} and assorted cruisers had been transferred to the Central Pacific to support the upcoming invasion of Tarawa.  Other than the destroyer screen, the only force Halsey had available were the carrier airgroups on {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}} and {{USS|Princeton|CVL-23|2}}.  Rabaul was a heavily fortified port, with five airfields and extensive anti-aircraft batteries.  Other than the surprise raid at Pearl Harbor, no mission against such a target had ever been accomplished with carrier aircraft.  It was highly dangerous to the aircrews, and to the carriers as well.  With the landing in the balance, Halsey sent his two carriers to steam north through the night to get into range of Rabaul, then launch a daybreak raid on the base.  Aircraft from recently captured [[Vella Lavella]] were sent over to provide a combat air patrol over the carriers. All available aircraft from the two carriers were committed to the raid itself.  The [[Bombing of Rabaul (November 1943)|mission]] was a stunning success, so damaging the cruiser force at Rabaul as to make them no longer a threat.  Aircraft losses in the raid were light.  Halsey later described the threat to the landings as \"the most desperate emergency that confronted me in my entire term as ComSoPac.\"<ref>Potter, ''Admiral Arleigh Burke'', pp.&nbsp;98\u201399.</ref>\n\nFollowing the successful Bougainville operation, he then isolated and neutralized the Japanese naval stronghold at Rabaul by capturing surrounding positions in the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] in a series of amphibious landings known as [[Operation Cartwheel]]. This enabled the continuation of the drive north without the heavy fighting that would have been necessary to capture the base itself.  With the neutralization of Rabaul, major operations in the South Pacific Command came to a close.  With his determination and grit, Halsey had bolstered his command's resolve and seized the initiative from the Japanese until ships, aircraft and crews produced and trained in the States could arrive in 1943 and 1944 to tip the scales of the war in favor of the allies.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 416\u2013430.</ref>\n\n===Battles of the Central Pacific===\n[[File:VAdm John S.

McCain Sr.]] on board Halsey's flagship, {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|6}} in December 1944]]As the war progressed it moved out of the South Pacific and into the Central Pacific. Halsey's command shifted with it, and in May 1944 he was promoted to commanding officer of the newly formed [[U.S. Third Fleet|Third Fleet]]. He commanded actions from the [[Philippines]] to Japan. From September 1944 to January 1945, he led the campaigns to take the [[Palaus]], [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] and [[Luzon]], and on many raids on Japanese bases, including off the shores of Formosa, China, and Vietnam.\n\nBy this point in the conflict the U.S. Navy was doing things the Japanese high command had not thought possible. The [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] was able to bring to battle enough air power to overpower land based aircraft and dominate whatever area the fleet was operating in. Moreover, the Navy's ability to establish [[USS Cascade (AD-16)#Service Squadron 4 and Service Squadron 10|forward operating ports]] as they did at [[Majuro#History|Majuro]], [[Enewetak Atoll#History|Enewetak]] and [[Ulithi#History|Ulithi]], and their ability to convoy supplies out to the combat task forces, allowed the fleet to operate for extended periods of time far out to sea in the central and western Pacific. The Japanese Navy conserved itself in port and would sortie in force to engage the enemy. The U.S. Navy remained at sea and on station, dominating whatever region it entered. The size of the Pacific Ocean, which Japanese planners had thought would limit the U.S. Navy's ability to operate in the western Pacific, would not be adequate to protect Japan.\n\nCommand of the \"big blue fleet\" was alternated with [[Raymond Spruance]].{{NoteTag|The \"Big Blue Fleet\" was the name given to the main fleet of the US Navy in the Pacific.  The term stems from pre-war planning, called the color plans because each nation included was given a color code name. In these potential plans the British navy was red, the German navy black, and so forth. The Imperial Japanese Navy was termed the \"Orange Fleet\".  The U.S. fleet was the \"Blue Fleet\".  The \"Big Blue Fleet\" was the massive fleet that the U.S. Navy anticipated they would win the war with.  It was thought this fleet would largely come into being by late 1943, early 1944.<ref name=\"Potter p. 112\" />}}  Under Spruance the fleet designation was the [[U.S. Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleet]] and the Fast Carrier Task Force was designated \"Task Force 58\". Under Halsey the fleet was designated Third Fleet and the Fast Carrier Task Force was designated \"Task Force 38\".<ref name=\"Potter p. 112\" /> The split command structure was intended to confuse the Japanese and created a higher tempo of operations. While Spruance was at sea operating the fleet, Halsey and his staff, self-dubbed the \"Department of Dirty Tricks\", would be planning the next series of operations.<ref>Cutler, ''The Battle of Leyte Gulf'', p. 209.</ref> The two admirals were a contrast in styles. Halsey was aggressive and a risk taker. Spruance was calculating, professional and cautious. Most higher-ranking officers preferred to serve under Spruance; most common sailors were proud to serve under Halsey.<ref>{{cite book |title=America's Fighting Admirals:Winning the War at Sea in World War II |last=Tuohy |first=William |publisher=Zenith Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/americasfighting00tuoh/page/323 323] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7603-2985-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/americasfighting00tuoh/page/323 }}</ref>\n\n====Leyte Gulf====\n[[File:Halsey messing with crew.jpg|thumb|right|Halsey dines with crew of USS ''New Jersey'' (November 1944)]]\nIn October 1944, amphibious forces of the U.S. [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] carried out [[Douglas MacArthur|General Douglas MacArthur's]] major landings on the island of [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] in the Central Philippines. Halsey's Third Fleet was assigned to cover and support Seventh Fleet operations around Leyte. Halsey's plans assumed the Japanese fleet or a major portion of it would challenge the effort, creating an opportunity to engage it decisively. Halsey directed the Third Fleet \"will seek the enemy and attempt to bring about a decisive engagement if he undertakes operations beyond support of superior land based air forces.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/9fe423c2-9276-41c7-be29-04260b8a04c3/Replacing-Battleships-with-Aircraft-Carriers-in-th|last=Hone|first=Thomas|title=Replacing Battleships with Aircraft Carriers in the Pacific in World War II|work=Naval War College Review|date=Winter 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2017|p=71}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the invasion, the Japanese launched their final major naval effort, an operation known as 'Sho-Go', involving almost all their surviving fleet. It was aimed at destroying the invasion shipping in the [[Leyte Gulf]]. The Northern Force of Admiral Ozawa was built around the remaining Japanese aircraft carriers, now weakened by the heavy loss of trained pilots. The Northern Force was meant to lure the covering U.S. forces away from the Gulf while two surface battle-groups, the Center Force and the Southern Force, were to break through to the beachhead and attack the invasion shipping. These forces were built around the remaining strength of the Japanese Navy, and comprised a total of 7 battleships and 16 cruisers. The operation brought about the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Battle for Leyte Gulf]], the largest naval battle of the Second World War and, by some criteria, the [[largest naval battle in history]].\n\nThe Center Force commanded by Vice Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]] was located October 23 coming through the Palawan Passage by two American submarines, which [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#The submarine action in Palawan Passage .2823 October.29|attacked the force]], sinking two heavy cruisers and damaging a third. The following day Third Fleet's aircraft carriers launched strikes against Kurita's Center Force, [[Battle of the Sibuyan Sea|sinking]] the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}} and damaging the heavy cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|My\u014dk\u014d||2}}, causing the force to turn westward back towards its base. Kurita appeared to be retiring but he later reversed course and headed back into the [[San Bernardino Strait]]. At this point Ozawa's Northern Force was located by Third Fleet scout aircraft. Halsey made the momentous decision to take all available strength northwards to destroy the Japanese carrier forces, planning to strike them at dawn of October 25. He considered leaving a battle group behind to guard the strait, and made tentative plans to do so, but he felt he would also have to leave one of his three carrier groups to provide air cover, weakening his chance to crush the remaining Japanese carrier forces. The entire Third Fleet steamed northward. San Bernardino Strait was effectively left unguarded by any major surface fleet.\n\n====Battle off Samar====\nIn moving Third Fleet northwards, Halsey failed to advise Admiral [[Thomas C. Kinkaid|Thomas Kinkaid]] of Seventh Fleet of his decision. Seventh Fleet intercepts of organizational messages from Halsey to his own task group commanders seemed to indicate that Halsey had formed a task force and detached it to protect the San Bernardino Strait, but this was not the case. Kinkaid and his staff failed to confirm this with Halsey, and neither had confirmed this with Nimitz.\n\nDespite aerial reconnaissance reports on the night of October 24\u201325 of Kurita's Center Force in the San Bernardino Strait, Halsey continued to take Third Fleet northwards, away from Leyte Gulf.\n\n[[File:Halsey Mccain.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Halsey with Vice Admiral [[John S. McCain Sr.]]]]\n\nWhen Kurita's Center Force emerged from the San Bernardino Strait on the morning of October 25, there was nothing to oppose them except a small force of escort carriers and screening destroyers and [[destroyer escort]]s, Task Unit 77.4.3 \"Taffy 3\", which had been tasked and armed to attack troops on land and guard against submarines, not oppose the largest enemy surface fleet since the battle of Midway, led by the largest battleship in the world. Advancing down the coast of the island of Samar towards the troop transports and support ships of the Leyte Gulf landing, they took Seventh Fleet's escort carriers and their screening ships entirely by surprise.\n\nIn the desperate [[Battle off Samar]] which followed, Kurita's ships destroyed one of the escort carriers and three ships of the carriers' screen, and damaged a number of other ships as well. The remarkable resistance of the screening ships of Taffy 3 against Kurita's battle-group remains one of the most heroic feats in the history of the US Navy. Their efforts and those of the several hundred aircraft that the escort carriers could put up, many of whom, however could not be armed with the most effective ordinance to deal with heavy surface ships in time, took a heavy toll on Kurita's ships and convinced him that he was facing a stronger force than was the case. Mistaking the escort carriers for Halsey's fleet carriers, and fearing entrapment from the six battleships of the Third Fleet battleship group, he decided to withdraw back through the San Bernardino Strait and to the west without achieving his objective of disrupting the Leyte landing.\n\nWhen the Seventh Fleet's escort carriers found themselves under attack from the Center Force, Halsey began to receive a succession of desperate calls from Kinkaid asking for immediate assistance off Samar. For over two hours Halsey turned a deaf ear to these calls. Then, shortly after 10:00 hours,<ref name=\"Willmott\">{{cite book |last=Willmott|first=H.

The world wonders\". The tail end of this message, [[The world wonders]], was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders, but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to Halsey. The urgent inquiry had seemingly become a stinging rebuke. The fiery Halsey threw his hat on the deck of the bridge and began cursing.<ref name=\"Willmott\"/> Finally Halsey's Chief of Staff, Rear Admiral [[Robert Carney|Robert \"Mick\" Carney]], confronted him, telling Halsey \"Stop it! What the hell's the matter with you? Pull yourself together.\"<ref name=\"Books: The General and the Admiral\"/>\n\nHalsey cooled but continued to steam Third Fleet northward to close on Ozawa's Northern Force for a full hour after receiving the signal from Nimitz.<ref name=\"Willmott\"/> Then, Halsey ordered Task Force 34 south. As Task Force 34 proceeded south they were further delayed when the battle force had to slow to 12 knots so that the battleships could refuel their escorting destroyers. The refueling cost a two and a half hour further delay.<ref name=\"Willmott\"/> By the time Task Force 34 arrived at the scene it was too late to assist the Seventh Fleet's escort carrier groups. Kurita had already decided to retire and had left the area. A single straggling destroyer was caught by Halsey's advance cruisers and destroyers, but the rest of Kurita's force was able to escape.\n\nMeanwhile the major part Third Fleet continued to close on Ozawa's Northern Force, which included one fleet carrier (the last surviving Japanese carrier of the six that had attacked Pearl Harbor) and three light carriers. The [[Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o]] resulted in Halsey's Third Fleet sinking all four of Ozawa's carriers.\n\nThe same attributes that made Halsey an invaluable leader in the desperate early months of the war, his desire to bring the fight to the enemy, his willingness to take on a gamble, worked against him in the later stages of the war. Halsey received much criticism for his decisions during the battle, with naval historian [[Samuel Eliot Morison|Samuel Morison]] terming the Third Fleet run to the north \"Halsey's Blunder.\"<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey'', pp. 376\u2013380.</ref> However, the destruction of the Japanese carriers had been an important goal up to that point, and the Leyte landings were still successful despite Halsey falling for the Japanese Navy's decoy.\n\n=== Halsey's Typhoon ===\n{{Main|Typhoon Cobra (1944)}}\n\n[[File:USS Langley (CVL-27) during Typhoon Cobra, December 1944.jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|Langley|CVL-27|6}} struggles in Typhoon Cobra.]]\n\nAfter the Leyte Gulf engagement, December found the Third Fleet confronted with another powerful enemy in the form of [[Typhoon Cobra]], which was dubbed \"Halsey's Typhoon\" by many.\n\nWhile conducting operations off the Philippines, the fleet had to discontinue refueling due to a Pacific storm. Rather than move Third Fleet away, Halsey chose to remain on station for another day. In fairness, he received conflicting information from Pearl Harbor and his own staff. The Hawaiian weathermen predicted a northerly path for the storm, which would have cleared Task Force 38 by some {{convert|200|mi|km|spell=in}}. Eventually his own staff provided a prediction regarding the direction of the storm that was far closer to the mark with a westerly direction. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/william-bull-halsey-legendary-world-war-ii-admiral.htm |title=William Bull Halsey: Legendary World War II Admiral |author=Barrett Tillman |work=historynet.com |date=July 2007}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Halsey played the odds, declining to cancel planned operations and requiring the ships of Third Fleet to hold formation. On the evening of December 17 Third Fleet was unable to land its combat air patrol due to the pitching and rolling decks of the carriers. All the aircraft were ditched in the ocean and lost, but the pilots were all saved by accompanying destroyers. By 10:00&nbsp;a.m. the next morning the barometer on the flagship was noted to be dropping precipitously. With increasingly heavy seas the fleet still attempted to maintain stations. The threat was greatest to the fleet's destroyers, which did not have the fuel reserves of the larger ships and were running dangerously low. Finally, at 11:49&nbsp;a.m., Halsey issued the order for the ships of the fleet to take the most comfortable course available to them. Many of the smaller ships had already been forced to do so. \n\nBetween 11:00&nbsp;a.m. and 2:00&nbsp;p.m., the typhoon did its worst damage, tossing the ships in {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on|0}} waves. The barometer continued to drop and the wind roared at {{convert|83|kn|kph|lk=in|0}} with gusts well over {{convert|100|kn|kph|0}}. At 1:45&nbsp;p.m. Halsey issued a typhoon warning to Fleet Weather Central. By this time Third Fleet had lost three of its destroyers. By the time the storm had cleared the next day a great many ships in the fleet had been damaged, 146 aircraft were destroyed and 802 seamen had been lost. For the next three days Third Fleet conducted search and rescue operations, finally retiring to [[Ulithi]] on 22 December 1944.\n\nFollowing the typhoon a Navy court of inquiry was convened on board {{USS|Cascade|AD-16|6}} in the Naval base at Ulithi. Admiral Nimitz, CINCPAC, was in attendance at the court. Forty-three-year-old Captain Herbert K. Gates, of ''Cascade'', was the Judge Advocate.<ref>Drury.</ref> The inquiry found that though Halsey had committed an error of judgement in sailing the Third Fleet into the heart of the typhoon, it stopped short of unambiguously recommending sanction.<ref name=\"Melton, Sea Cobra\">Melton, ''Sea Cobra''.</ref> The events surrounding Typhoon Cobra were similar to those the Japanese navy had faced some nine years earlier in what they termed \"[[4th Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)#The Fourth Fleet incident|The Fourth Fleet Incident]].\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Kaigun: Strategy, Tactics and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy 1887\u20131941 |last1=Evans |first1=David |last2=Peattie |first2=Mark|publisher=Naval Institute Press |page=243 |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-87021-192-8}}</ref>\n\n===End of the war===\n[[File:Nimitz missouri.jpg|thumb|Fleet Admiral Nimitz signing the documents of surrender on board USS ''Missouri''. Behind him stand Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Rear Adm. Forrest Sherman, and Halsey (''middle'').]]\nDuring January 1945 the Third Fleet attacked Formosa and Luzon, and [[South China Sea raid|raided the South China Sea]] in support of the landing of US Army forces on Luzon. At the conclusion of this operation, Halsey passed command of the ships that made up Third Fleet to Admiral Spruance on January 26, whereupon its designation changed to [[United States Fifth Fleet#History|Fifth Fleet]]. Returning home Halsey was asked about General MacArthur, who was not the easiest man to work with, and vied with the Navy over the conduct and management of the war in the Pacific.<ref>Willmott, pp. 178\u2013181.</ref> Halsey had worked well with MacArthur and did not mind saying so. When a reporter asked Halsey if he thought MacArthur's fleet (7th Fleet) would get to Tokyo first, the admiral grinned and answered \"We're going there together.\"  Then seriously he added \"He's a very fine man. I have worked under him for over two years and have the greatest admiration and respect for him.\"<ref>''Utica Daily Press'', February 20, 1945.</ref>\n\nSpruance held command of Fifth Fleet until May, when command returned to Halsey. In early June 1945 the Third Fleet again sailed through the path of [[Typhoon Connie]]. On this occasion, six men were swept overboard and lost, along with 75 airplanes lost or destroyed, with another 70 badly damaged. Though some ships sustained significant damage, none were lost.  A Navy court of inquiry was again convened, this time recommending that Halsey be reassigned, but Admiral Nimitz declined to abide by this recommendation, citing Halsey's prior service record, despite that record including a previous instance of negligently sailing his fleet through a typhoon.<ref name=\"Melton, Sea Cobra\" />\n\nHalsey led Third Fleet through the final stages of the war, striking targets on the Japanese homeland itself. Third Fleet aircraft conducted attacks upon Tokyo, the [[Bombing of Kure (July 1945)|naval base at Kure]] and the northern Japanese island of [[Hokkaid\u014d]], and Third Fleet battleships engaged in the [[Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II|bombardment of a number of Japanese coastal cities]] in preparation for an invasion of Japan, which ultimately never had to be undertaken.\n\nAfter the cessation of hostilities, Halsey, still aggressively cautious of Japanese kamikaze attacks, ordered Third Fleet to maintain a protective air cover with the following communiqu\u00e9: {{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | Cessation of hostilities.<br />War is over. <br />If any Japanese airplanes appear, shoot them down in a friendly way.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Caviar and Commissars: the Experience of a US Naval Officer in Stalin's Russia |author=Kemp Tolley |page=245|publisher=Naval Institute Press |year=1983 |isbn=978-1-55750-407-4}}</ref>}}\nHe was present when [[Surrender of Japan|Japan formally surrendered]] on the deck of his [[flagship]], {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}, on September 2, 1945.\n\n==Postwar years==\n[[File:Halsey.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Halsey]]\nImmediately after the surrender of Japan, 54 ships of the Third Fleet returned to the United States, with Halsey's four-star flag flying from USS ''South Dakota'', for the annual Navy Day Celebrations in San Francisco on October 27, 1945. He hauled down his flag on 22 November 1945, and was assigned special duty in the office of the Secretary of the Navy. On December 11, 1945, he took the oath as [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]], becoming the fourth and still the most recent naval officer awarded that rank. Halsey made a goodwill flying trip, passing by [[Central America|Central]] and South America, covering nearly {{convert|28,000|mi}} and 11 nations. He retired from active service in March 1947, but as a Fleet Admiral, he was not taken off active duty status.\n\nHalsey was asked about the weapons used to win the war and he answered:\n{{Quote | style = font-size: 100%; | If I had to give credit to the instruments and machines that won us the war in the Pacific, I would rate them in this order: submarines first, radar second, planes third, bulldozers fourth.<ref>{{cite book |title = Admiral Halsey's Story |first=William |last=Halsey |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1947|page=69 |isbn = 978-1-4367-1143-2 }}</ref>}}\n\nHalsey joined the New Jersey Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]] in 1946. Upon retirement, he joined the board of two subsidiaries of the [[International Telephone and Telegraph Company]], including the [[American Cable and Radio Corporation]], and served until 1957. He maintained an office near the top of the ITT Building at 67 Broad Street, New York City in the late 1950s. He was involved in a number of efforts to preserve his former flagship {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} as a memorial in [[New York Harbor]].

Wouk was extremely critical of Halsey's handling of the battle at Leyte Gulf, but also said he was too great a builder of naval morale to be retired in disgrace.  (Chapter 92)  Halsey was portrayed in the 1983 television [[miniseries]] adaptation of ''The Winds of War'' by [[Richard X.

Soviet submarine commander Marko Ramius, while engaged in battle with the Soviet attack submarine ''Konovalov'', asks [[Jack Ryan (Tom Clancy character)|Jack Ryan]] what books he wrote for the CIA. Ryan mentions one about Admiral Halsey, entitled ''The Fighting Sailor'' (not to be confused with a real book of the same title); Ramius reveals his awareness of the book and expresses disdain for Ryan's assessment of Halsey, saying, \"Your conclusions were all wrong, Ryan.

Starting with their own take on the [[conventional wisdom]] that the [[evolution|evolutionary process]] stopped when modern humans appeared, the authors explain the [[genetics|genetic]] basis of their view that [[human evolution]] is accelerating, illustrating it with some examples.<ref name=\"Wolpoff\">Milford H.

Moreover, they argue that these adaptations have varied across different human [[populations]], depending on factors such as when the various groups developed agriculture, and the extent to which they mixed genetically with other population groups.<ref name=\"10K\"/>\n\nSuch changes, they argue, include not just well-known physical and biological adaptations such as [[Human skin color|skin colour]], disease resistance, and [[lactose intolerance|lactose tolerance]], but also [[personality]] and [[cognition|cognitive]] adaptations that are starting to emerge from genetic research. These may include tendencies towards (for example) reduced physical strength, enhanced long-term planning, or increased docility, all of which may have been counter-productive in [[hunter-gatherer]] societies, but become favoured adaptations in a world of agriculture and its resulting trade, governments and [[urbanization]]. These adaptations are even more important in the modern world, and have helped shape today's [[nation states]]. The authors speculate that the [[Scientific Revolution|scientific]] and [[Industrial Revolution]]s came about in part due to genetic changes in Europe over the past millennium, the absence of which had limited the progress of science in [[Ancient Greece]]. The authors suggest we would expect to see fewer adaptive changes among the [[Amerindians]] and [[sub-Saharan Africans]], who have farmed for the shortest times and were genetically isolated from older civilizations by geographical barriers. In groups that had remained foragers, such as the [[Australian Aborigines]], there would presumably be no such adaptations at all. This may explain why [[Indigenous Australians]] and many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] have characteristic health problems when exposed to modern Western diets. Similarly, Amerindians, Aboriginals, and [[Polynesians]], for example, had experienced very little infectious disease. They had not evolved immunities as did many [[Old World]] dwellers, and were decimated upon contact with the wider world.<ref name=\"10K\"/>\n\n==Summary==\n{{see|Recent human evolution}}\nThe book's main thesis is that human [[civilization|civilisation]] greatly accelerated increases in the rates of evolution. The authors begin their discussion by providing two quotes they feel portray the conventional wisdom on this topic. First, they quote [[Ernst Mayr]] as stating in 1963: \"Something must have happened to weaken the selective pressure drastically. We cannot escape the conclusion that man's evolution towards manness suddenly came to a halt.\" Second, they quote [[Stephen J. Gould]] as stating in 2000: \"There's been no biological change in humans in 40,000 or 50,000 years. Everything we call culture and civilization we've built with the same body and brain.\"\n\nThis had become the established viewpoint\u2014when modern humans appeared, evolution was essentially over. The received wisdom is based on the [[doctrine]] that human minds are the same, everywhere: [[Adolf Bastian|Bastian]]'s ''Psychic Unity of Mankind''.  Unfortunately, the authors find, this is no more than wishful thinking.  Were it true, human bodies would also be the same worldwide, which clearly they are not. [[Finns]] cannot be mistaken for [[Zulus]], nor Zulus for Finns.<ref name=10K>The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilizations Accelerated Human Evolution (2009). Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending. Basic Books, New York, NY, USA</ref> Not only are there strong reasons to believe that significant human evolution is theoretically possible, or even likely; it is completely obvious that it has taken place, since people are different from one another.\n\nThe first four of the book's seven chapters serve as a preamble to the final three. First, Cochran and Harpending present evidence for recent, accelerated human evolution after the invention of agriculture. In itself, this argument represents a [[paradigm shift]], albeit one that now has clear data to back it up.<ref name=\"Seed\"/>  The [[International HapMap Project]] and other studies have shown that [[Selection (biology)|selection]] is ongoing and has accelerated over time. This has been a key discovery in human biology, and Cochran and Harpending, building on their own work and that of others such as [[John D. Hawks|John Hawks]] of the University of Wisconsin-Madison,<ref>John Hawks, Eric T. Wang, Gregory M. Cochran, Henry C. Harpending, and Robert K. Moyzis.

Wolpoff|Wolpoff]] writes that Cochran and Harpending continue to refute conventional wisdom in their discussion of the [[Neanderthal]]s. For natural selection to have a chance, they argue, there need to be favourable mutations, or favourable combinations of existing [[allele]]s such as [[gene]]s for blue eyes or pale skin. Cochran and Harpending concentrate on the [[Neolithic Revolution|Neolithic farming revolution]] as the beginning of major population expansions that provided enough mutations to accelerate genetic change. Infectious diseases were another consequence of the [[Cradle of civilization|early urban populations]] and soon became a new source of selection pressures. The origins of many recently adapted genes have now been traced to this period, creating effects such as regional differences in skin colour and skeletal [[gracility]]. Adaptations may have sacrificed muscle strength for higher intelligence<ref name=\"10K\"/> and less aggressive human behaviours. By 5000 years ago, the authors estimate that adaptive alleles were coming into existence at a rate about 100 times faster than during the Pleistocene. This is the \u2018\u2018explosion\u2019\u2019 of the book\u2019s title.<ref name=\"Wolpoff\"/>\n\nResearch cited by Cochran and Harpending provides evidence of [[Genetic admixture|genetic mixing]] between modern humans and an [[Archaic humans|ancient Homo]] lineage such as the Neanderthals. It supports the idea that modern humans could have benefited by acquiring adaptive alleles evolved by our Neanderthal relatives - in this case, [[microcephalin]], an adaptive allele associated with brain development. Microcephalin (MCPH1) regulates brain size, and has evolved under strong positive selection in the human evolutionary lineage.<ref>Patrick D. Evans, Sandra L. Gilbert, Nitzan Mekel-Bobrov, Eric J. Vallender, Jeffrey R. Anderson, Leila M. Vaez-Azizi, Sarah A. Tishkoff, Richard R. Hudson and Bruce T. Lahn.

As anatomically modern humans emerged from Africa and spread across the globe, the \"indigenous\" Homo populations they encountered had already inhabited their respective regions for long periods of time and might have been better adapted to the local environments than the colonizers. It follows, it is argued, that modern humans, although probably superior in their own way, could have benefited from adaptive alleles gained by interbreeding with the populations they replaced, as was proposed to be the case for the brain-size-determining gene microcephalin.<ref>Evidence that the adaptive allele of the brain size gene microcephalin introgressed into Homo sapiens from an archaic Homo lineage (2005).

Over the period from 10,000 BC to AD 1, the world population increased about a hundredfold - estimates range from 40 to 170 times. An accelerated rate of evolution is a direct result of the larger human population. More people will have more [[mutation]]s, thereby increasing opportunity for evolutionary change under natural selection. The spread of rapidly expanding populations eventually outpaced the spread of favourable mutations under selection in those populations, so for the first time in human history favourable mutations could not fully disperse throughout the human species. In addition, of course, selection pressures changed once farming was adopted, favouring distinctive adaptations in different geographic areas.<ref name=\"10K\"/>\n\n===Gene flow===\nAbout halfway through the book, Cochran and Harpending pause to consider two different ways of looking at the information found in gene variants.<ref name=\"Seed\"/> Researchers commonly see them merely as [[Genetic marker|markers]] of human migration, ignoring their functions. The authors support such research, but argue for a more complete understanding of the geographic distributions of genes. Where the usual geographical analysis treats the distribution of genes as an effect of history, in the authors' view, the genes themselves are a major cause: Two variants in the same gene do not necessarily have the same effect, and their relative, selective benefits will control the spread of genes through populations in both space and time.\n\n===Expansions===\nFrom that platform the authors discuss ideas that range from the possible origins of the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] legend in Britain to the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. Others have attempted this, for example in Jared Diamond's [[Guns, Germs, and Steel]].<ref>[[Jared Diamond]] (1997), ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel: A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years]]'', London: Vintage, 2005 [1997], {{ISBN|0-09-930278-0}}</ref> But, according to Kelleher,<ref name=\"Seed\"/> Cochran and Harpending go one better than Diamond. He goes on to state that where Diamond was content with [[environmental determinism]], at times opposing the roles of human biology and population differences,  Cochran and Harpending embrace them both. Their discussion of gene flow becomes the core of an argument for biology as central to history, and the backdrop for the book's two major hypotheses.\n\nThe first seeks to resolve a longstanding debate in [[historical linguistics]] by making a case for the [[Kurgan hypothesis]] on the origins of the [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|Indo-European language group]]. The Kurgan theory holds that Indo-European speakers came from lands between the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] seas before spreading their language by conquest. The authors suggest that dairy farming and a complementary adaptation - the ability to digest lactose in adulthood - lie behind their conquests. With a walking food source, the milk-drinking warriors defeated their plant-growing neighbours. Drinking milk, from cows, horses, or camels, is a behavior shared by many of history's greatest conquering peoples, whether Kurgans, [[Scythians]], [[Arab people|Arabs]], or [[Mongols]]. Without continuing evolution, the ability to digest milk could never have arisen. In fact, it has done so several times, in different ways, in various places, and it has helped shape human history. Kelleher comments that the authors\u2019 argument makes it difficult to imagine the language in which their book would have been written, were it not for the ability to digest milk.<ref name=\"Seed\"/>\n\n===Ashkenazi Jews===\nThe second major argument, which takes up the final chapter, sets out to explain why [[Ashkenazi Jewish intelligence|Ashkenazi Jews]] have a [[mean]] [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] so much higher than that of the population in general, as well as a higher rate of some genetic disorders such as [[Tay-Sachs disease]]. This argument had been published previously in an earlier paper.<ref>[[Gregory Cochran|Cochran, G.]], J. Hardy, H. Harpending (2006). \"[[Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence]]\". ''[[Journal of Biosocial Science]]'' 38 (5), pp. 659\u2013693.  {{doi|10.1017/S0021932005027069}}</ref><ref name=\"Seed\"/> This hypothesis proposes that from A.D. 800 until around 1700, Askhenazi Jews were restricted to professions that required high intelligence, and that this produced a selective pressure in favor of intelligence. When faced with a sudden threat, evolution may favor any change that offers protection, and Cochran and Harpending propose that selection for genes promoting high intelligence thus had the side effect of also selecting for these genetic disorders. The hypothesis has drawn a mixed reaction from scientists, with some arguing the hypothesis is highly implausible, and others regarding it as worth considering.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/03/science/researchers-say-intelligence-and-diseases-may-be-linked-in.html \"Researchers Say Intelligence and Diseases May Be Linked in Ashkenazic Genes\"].

Wolpoff]] praised the book's central thesis as being insightful and worthy of further research, while also criticizing the book for its reification of [[racialism|biological race]], and its dubious or oversimplified view of history.<ref name=\"Wolpoff\"/>\n\nIn ''[[New Scientist]]'', Christopher Willis wrote that the \"evidence the authors present an overwhelming case that natural selection has recently acted strongly on us\". However, Willis criticizes the authors for not discussing what the \"recent and continuing evolution means for our species as a whole\". Willis concludes by saying that \"the book offers a limited and biased interpretation\nof some very exciting research\".<ref name=\"Wills2009\">{{cite journal|last1=Wills|first1=Christopher|title=Review: The 10,000 Year Explosion by Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending|journal=New Scientist|volume=201|issue=2695|year=2009|pages=46\u201347|issn=0262-4079|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(09)60457-7|bibcode=2009NewSc.201...46W}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Evolutionary Psychology (journal)|Evolutionary Psychology]]'', Gregory Gorelik and [[Todd K.

Starting with their own take on the [[conventional wisdom]] that the [[evolution|evolutionary process]] stopped when modern humans appeared, the authors explain the [[genetics|genetic]] basis of their view that [[human evolution]] is accelerating, illustrating it with some examples.<ref name=\"Wolpoff\">Milford H.

Moreover, they argue that these adaptations have varied across different human [[populations]], depending on factors such as when the various groups developed agriculture, and the extent to which they mixed genetically with other population groups.<ref name=\"10K\"/>\n\nSuch changes, they argue, include not just well-known physical and biological adaptations such as [[Human skin color|skin colour]], disease resistance, and [[lactose intolerance|lactose tolerance]], but also [[personality]] and [[cognition|cognitive]] adaptations that are starting to emerge from genetic research. These may include tendencies towards (for example) reduced physical strength, enhanced long-term planning, or increased docility, all of which may have been counter-productive in [[hunter-gatherer]] societies, but become favoured adaptations in a world of agriculture and its resulting trade, governments and [[urbanization]]. These adaptations are even more important in the modern world, and have helped shape today's [[nation states]]. The authors speculate that the [[Scientific Revolution|scientific]] and [[Industrial Revolution]]s came about in part due to genetic changes in Europe over the past millennium, the absence of which had limited the progress of science in [[Ancient Greece]]. The authors suggest we would expect to see fewer adaptive changes among the [[Amerindians]] and [[sub-Saharan Africans]], who have farmed for the shortest times and were genetically isolated from older civilizations by geographical barriers. In groups that had remained foragers, such as the [[Australian Aborigines]], there would presumably be no such adaptations at all. This may explain why [[Indigenous Australians]] and many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] have characteristic health problems when exposed to modern Western diets. Similarly, Amerindians, Aboriginals, and [[Polynesians]], for example, had experienced very little infectious disease. They had not evolved immunities as did many [[Old World]] dwellers, and were decimated upon contact with the wider world.<ref name=\"10K\"/>\n\n==Summary==\n{{see|Recent human evolution}}\nThe book's main thesis is that human [[civilization|civilisation]] greatly accelerated increases in the rates of evolution. The authors begin their discussion by providing two quotes they feel portray the conventional wisdom on this topic. First, they quote [[Ernst Mayr]] as stating in 1963: \"Something must have happened to weaken the selective pressure drastically. We cannot escape the conclusion that man's evolution towards manness suddenly came to a halt.\" Second, they quote [[Stephen J. Gould]] as stating in 2000: \"There's been no biological change in humans in 40,000 or 50,000 years. Everything we call culture and civilization we've built with the same body and brain.\"\n\nThis had become the established viewpoint\u2014when modern humans appeared, evolution was essentially over. The received wisdom is based on the [[doctrine]] that human minds are the same, everywhere: [[Adolf Bastian|Bastian]]'s ''Psychic Unity of Mankind''.  Unfortunately, the authors find, this is no more than wishful thinking.  Were it true, human bodies would also be the same worldwide, which clearly they are not. [[Finns]] cannot be mistaken for [[Zulus]], nor Zulus for Finns.<ref name=10K>The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilizations Accelerated Human Evolution (2009). Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending. Basic Books, New York, NY, USA</ref> Not only are there strong reasons to believe that significant human evolution is theoretically possible, or even likely; it is completely obvious that it has taken place, since people are different from one another.\n\nThe first four of the book\u2019s seven chapters serve as a preamble to the final three. First, Cochran and Harpending present evidence for recent, accelerated human evolution after the invention of agriculture. In itself, this argument represents a [[paradigm shift]], albeit one that now has clear data to back it up.<ref name=\"Seed\"/>  The [[International HapMap Project]] and other studies have shown that [[Selection (biology)|selection]] is ongoing and has accelerated over time. This has been a key discovery in human biology, and Cochran and Harpending, building on their own work and that of others such as [[John D. Hawks|John Hawks]] of the University of Wisconsin-Madison,<ref>John Hawks, Eric T. Wang, Gregory M. Cochran, Henry C. Harpending, and Robert K. Moyzis.

Wolpoff|Wolpoff]] writes that Cochran and Harpending continue to refute conventional wisdom in their discussion of the [[Neanderthal]]s. For natural selection to have a chance, they argue, there need to be favourable mutations, or favourable combinations of existing [[allele]]s such as [[gene]]s for blue eyes or pale skin. Cochran and Harpending concentrate on the [[Neolithic Revolution|Neolithic farming revolution]] as the beginning of major population expansions that provided enough mutations to accelerate genetic change. Infectious diseases were another consequence of the [[Cradle of civilization|early urban populations]] and soon became a new source of selection pressures. The origins of many recently adapted genes have now been traced to this period, creating effects such as regional differences in skin colour and skeletal [[gracility]]. Adaptations may have sacrificed muscle strength for higher intelligence<ref name=\"10K\"/> and less aggressive human behaviours. By 5000 years ago, the authors estimate that adaptive alleles were coming into existence at a rate about 100 times faster than during the Pleistocene. This is the \u2018\u2018explosion\u2019\u2019 of the book\u2019s title.<ref name=\"Wolpoff\"/>\n\nResearch cited by Cochran and Harpending provides evidence of [[Genetic admixture|genetic mixing]] between modern humans and an [[Archaic humans|ancient Homo]] lineage such as the Neanderthals. It supports the idea that modern humans could have benefited by acquiring adaptive alleles evolved by our Neanderthal relatives - in this case, [[microcephalin]], an adaptive allele associated with brain development. Microcephalin (MCPH1) regulates brain size, and has evolved under strong positive selection in the human evolutionary lineage.<ref>Patrick D. Evans, Sandra L. Gilbert, Nitzan Mekel-Bobrov, Eric J. Vallender, Jeffrey R. Anderson, Leila M. Vaez-Azizi, Sarah A. Tishkoff, Richard R. Hudson and Bruce T. Lahn.

As anatomically modern humans emerged from Africa and spread across the globe, the \"indigenous\" Homo populations they encountered had already inhabited their respective regions for long periods of time and might have been better adapted to the local environments than the colonizers. It follows, it is argued, that modern humans, although probably superior in their own way, could have benefited from adaptive alleles gained by interbreeding with the populations they replaced, as was proposed to be the case for the brain-size-determining gene microcephalin.<ref>Evidence that the adaptive allele of the brain size gene microcephalin introgressed into Homo sapiens from an archaic Homo lineage (2005).

Over the period from 10,000 BC to AD 1, the world population increased about a hundredfold - estimates range from 40 to 170 times. An accelerated rate of evolution is a direct result of the larger human population. More people will have more [[mutation]]s, thereby increasing opportunity for evolutionary change under natural selection. The spread of rapidly expanding populations eventually outpaced the spread of favourable mutations under selection in those populations, so for the first time in human history favourable mutations could not fully disperse throughout the human species. In addition, of course, selection pressures changed once farming was adopted, favouring distinctive adaptations in different geographic areas.<ref name=\"10K\"/>\n\n===Gene flow===\nAbout halfway through the book, Cochran and Harpending pause to consider two different ways of looking at the information found in gene variants.<ref name=\"Seed\"/> Researchers commonly see them merely as [[Genetic marker|markers]] of human migration, ignoring their functions. The authors support such research, but argue for a more complete understanding of the geographic distributions of genes. Where the usual geographical analysis treats the distribution of genes as an effect of history, in the authors' view, the genes themselves are a major cause: Two variants in the same gene do not necessarily have the same effect, and their relative, selective benefits will control the spread of genes through populations in both space and time.\n\n===Expansions===\nFrom that platform the authors discuss ideas that range from the possible origins of the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] legend in Britain to the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. Others have attempted this, for example in Jared Diamond\u2019s [[Guns, Germs, and Steel]].<ref>[[Jared Diamond]] (1997), ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel: A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years]]'', London: Vintage, 2005 [1997], {{ISBN|0-09-930278-0}}</ref> But, according to Kelleher,<ref name=\"Seed\"/> Cochran and Harpending go one better than Diamond. He goes on to state that where Diamond was content with [[environmental determinism]], at times opposing the roles of human biology and population differences,  Cochran and Harpending embrace them both. Their discussion of gene flow becomes the core of an argument for biology as central to history, and the backdrop for the book's two major hypotheses.\n\nThe first seeks to resolve a longstanding debate in [[historical linguistics]] by making a case for the [[Kurgan hypothesis]] on the origins of the [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|Indo-European language group]]. The Kurgan theory holds that Indo-European speakers came from lands between the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] seas before spreading their language by conquest. The authors suggest that dairy farming and a complementary adaptation - the ability to digest lactose in adulthood - lie behind their conquests. With a walking food source, the milk-drinking warriors defeated their plant-growing neighbours. Drinking milk, from cows, horses, or camels, is a behavior shared by many of history\u2019s greatest conquering peoples, whether Kurgans, [[Scythians]], [[Arab people|Arabs]], or [[Mongols]]. Without continuing evolution, the ability to digest milk could never have arisen. In fact, it has done so several times, in different ways, in various places, and it has helped shape human history. Kelleher comments that the authors\u2019 argument makes it difficult to imagine the language in which their book would have been written, were it not for the ability to digest milk.<ref name=\"Seed\"/>\n\n===Ashkenazi Jews===\nThe second major argument, which takes up the final chapter, sets out to explain why [[Ashkenazi Jewish intelligence|Ashkenazi Jews]] have a [[mean]] [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] so much higher than that of the population in general, as well as a higher rate of some genetic disorders such as [[Tay-Sachs disease]]. This argument had been published previously in an earlier paper.<ref>[[Gregory Cochran|Cochran, G.]], J. Hardy, H. Harpending (2006). \"[[Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence]]\". ''[[Journal of Biosocial Science]]'' 38 (5), pp. 659\u2013693.  {{doi|10.1017/S0021932005027069}}</ref><ref name=\"Seed\"/> This hypothesis proposes that from A.D. 800 until around 1700, Askhenazi Jews were restricted to professions that required high intelligence, and that this produced a selective pressure in favor of intelligence. When faced with a sudden threat, evolution may favor any change that offers protection, and Cochran and Harpending propose that selection for genes promoting high intelligence thus had the side effect of also selecting for these genetic disorders. The hypothesis has drawn a mixed reaction from scientists, with some arguing the hypothesis is highly implausible, and others regarding it as worth considering.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/03/science/researchers-say-intelligence-and-diseases-may-be-linked-in.html \"Researchers Say Intelligence and Diseases May Be Linked in Ashkenazic Genes\"].

In his book, ''The Dean Koontz Companion'', he recalled that he:\n\n<blockquote>\nrealized that most of these programs are not meant to help anyone, merely to control people and make them dependent. I was forced to reconsider everything I'd once believed. I developed a profound distrust of government regardless of the philosophy of the people in power. I remained a liberal on civil-rights issues, became a conservative on defense, and a semi-libertarian on all other matters.\"<ref name=Advocates/>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Career==\nIn his spare time, he wrote his first novel, ''[[Star Quest]]'', which was published in 1968. Koontz went on to write over a dozen [[science-fiction]] novels. Seeing the [[Catholic faith]] as a contrast to the chaos in his family, Koontz converted in college because it gave him answers for his life, admiring its \"intellectual rigor\" and saying it permits a view of life that sees mystery and wonder in all things.<ref name=Drake_2007>{{cite news|accessdate=2009-11-28 |last=Drake |first=Tim |title=Chatting With Koontz About Faith |work=[[National Catholic Register]] |url=http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/2013 |date=March 6, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117060951/http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/2013 |archivedate=January 17, 2010 }}</ref><ref>Rossi, Tony, [http://catholicexchange.com/2009/08/01/120925/ Best-selling Author Dean Koontz Explores Catholic Values in Novels] Catholic Exchange, August 1, 2009</ref> He says he sees Catholicism as English writer and Catholic convert [[G.K.

Koontz has stated that he began using pen names after several [[copy editing|editor]]s convinced him that authors who switched back and forth between different [[genre]]s invariably fell victim to \"negative crossover\" (alienating established fans and simultaneously failing to pick up any new ones). Known pseudonyms used by Koontz during his career include Deanna Dwyer, K. R. Dwyer, Aaron Wolfe, David Axton, Brian Coffey, John Hill, Leigh Nichols, Owen West, Richard Paige, and Anthony North. As Brian Coffey, he wrote the \"Mike Tucker\" trilogy [''Blood Risk'', ''Surrounded'', ''Wall of Masks''] in acknowledged tribute to the Parker novels of [[Richard Stark]] ([[Donald E. Westlake]]). Many of Koontz's pseudonymous novels are now available under his real name. Many others remain suppressed by Koontz, who bought back the rights to ensure they could not be republished; he has, on occasion, said that he might revise some for republication, but only three have appeared\u2009\u2014\u2009''Demon Seed'' and ''Invasion'' were both heavily rewritten before they were republished, and ''Prison of Ice'' had certain sections [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerised]].\n\nAfter writing full-time for more than 10 years, Koontz's acknowledged breakthrough novel was ''[[Whispers (Koontz novel)|Whispers]]'', published in 1980. The two books before that, ''[[The Key to Midnight]]'' and ''[[The Funhouse (novel)|The Funhouse]]'', also sold over a million copies, but were written under pen names. His first bestseller was ''[[Demon Seed (novel)|Demon Seed]]'', the sales of which picked up after the release of the [[Demon Seed|film of the same name]] in 1977, and sold over two million copies in one year.<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=demon seed from the author|url=http://www.deankoontz.com/demon-seed-from-the-author/|website=Deankoontz.com|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref> His first hardcover bestseller, which finally promised some financial stability and lifted him out of the midlist hit-and-miss range, was his book ''[[Strangers (Dean Koontz novel)|Strangers]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=strangers from the author|url=http://www.deankoontz.com/strangers-from-the-author/|website=Deankoontz.com|accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref>\nSince then, 12 hardcovers and 14 paperbacks written by Koontz have reached number one on [[The New York Times Bestseller List|''The New York Times'' Bestseller List]].<ref name=\"deankoontz.com\"/>\n\nBestselling science-fiction writer [[Brian Herbert]] has stated, \"I even went through a phase where I read everything that Dean Koontz wrote, and in the process I learned a lot about characterization and building suspense.\"<ref>{{cite web|publisher=www.frankherbert.net |title=Interview with Brian Herbert |url=http://www.frankherbert.net/news/BrianHerbertInterview.pdf/ |accessdate=2011-05-03 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, [[psychologist]] [[Katherine Ramsland]] published an extensive biography of Koontz based on interviews with his family and him.

[i]n reality, it was a dumping ground for violent children.. . and most of the funding ended up 'disappearing somewhere.'\"<ref name=Advocates/> This experience greatly shaped Koontz's political outlook. In his book, ''The Dean Koontz Companion'', he recalled that he:\n\n<blockquote>\nrealized that most of these programs are not meant to help anyone, merely to control people and make them dependent. I was forced to reconsider everything I'd once believed. I developed a profound distrust of government regardless of the philosophy of the people in power. I remained a liberal on civil-rights issues, became a conservative on defense, and a semi-libertarian on all other matters.\"<ref name=Advocates/>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Career==\nIn his spare time, he wrote his first novel, ''[[Star Quest]]'', which was published in 1968. Koontz went on to write over a dozen [[science-fiction]] novels. Seeing the [[Catholic faith]] as a contrast to the chaos in his family, Koontz converted in college because it gave him answers for his life, admiring its \"intellectual rigor\" and saying it permits a view of life that sees mystery and wonder in all things.<ref name=Drake_2007>{{cite news|accessdate=2009-11-28 |last=Drake |first=Tim |title=Chatting With Koontz About Faith |work=[[National Catholic Register]] |url=http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/2013 |date=March 6, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117060951/http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/2013 |archivedate=January 17, 2010 }}</ref><ref>Rossi, Tony, [http://catholicexchange.com/2009/08/01/120925/ Best-selling Author Dean Koontz Explores Catholic Values in Novels] Catholic Exchange, August 1, 2009</ref> He says he sees Catholicism as English writer and Catholic convert [[G.K.

Koontz has stated that he began using pen names after several [[copy editing|editor]]s convinced him that authors who switched back and forth between different [[genre]]s invariably fell victim to \"negative crossover\" (alienating established fans and simultaneously failing to pick up any new ones). Known pseudonyms used by Koontz during his career include Deanna Dwyer, K. R. Dwyer, Aaron Wolfe, David Axton, Brian Coffey, John Hill, Leigh Nichols, Owen West, Richard Paige, and Anthony North. As Brian Coffey, he wrote the \"Mike Tucker\" trilogy [''Blood Risk'', ''Surrounded'', ''Wall of Masks''] in acknowledged tribute to the Parker novels of [[Richard Stark]] ([[Donald E. Westlake]]). Many of Koontz's pseudonymous novels are now available under his real name. Many others remain suppressed by Koontz, who bought back the rights to ensure they could not be republished; he has, on occasion, said that he might revise some for republication, but only three have appeared\u2009\u2014\u2009''Demon Seed'' and ''Invasion'' were both heavily rewritten before they were republished, and ''Prison of Ice'' had certain sections [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerised]].\n\nAfter writing full-time for more than 10 years, Koontz's acknowledged breakthrough novel was ''[[Whispers (Koontz novel)|Whispers]]'', published in 1980. The two books before that, ''[[The Key to Midnight]]'' and ''[[The Funhouse (novel)|The Funhouse]]'', also sold over a million copies, but were written under pen names. His first bestseller was ''[[Demon Seed (novel)|Demon Seed]]'', the sales of which picked up after the release of the [[Demon Seed|film of the same name]] in 1977, and sold over two million copies in one year.<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=demon seed from the author|url=http://www.deankoontz.com/demon-seed-from-the-author/|website=Deankoontz.com|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref> His first hardcover bestseller, which finally promised some financial stability and lifted him out of the midlist hit-and-miss range, was his book ''[[Strangers (Dean Koontz novel)|Strangers]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=strangers from the author|url=http://www.deankoontz.com/strangers-from-the-author/|website=Deankoontz.com|accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref>\nSince then, 12 hardcovers and 14 paperbacks written by Koontz have reached number one on [[The New York Times Bestseller List|''The New York Times'' Bestseller List]].<ref name=\"deankoontz.com\"/>\n\nBestselling science-fiction writer [[Brian Herbert]] has stated, \"I even went through a phase where I read everything that Dean Koontz wrote, and in the process I learned a lot about characterization and building suspense.\"<ref>{{cite web|publisher=www.frankherbert.net |title=Interview with Brian Herbert |url=http://www.frankherbert.net/news/BrianHerbertInterview.pdf/ |accessdate=2011-05-03 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, [[psychologist]] [[Katherine Ramsland]] published an extensive biography of Koontz based on interviews with his family and him.

On the right is the cone shaped collector anode, which absorbs the electrons.  It could generate 200&nbsp;W of power at 40&nbsp;centimeters (750&nbsp;MHz) with 50% efficiency.]]\n\nThe klystron was the first significantly powerful source of radio waves in the [[microwave]] range; before its invention the only sources were the [[Barkhausen-Kurz tube]] and [[Magnetron|split anode magnetron]], which were limited to very low power. It was invented by the brothers [[Russell and Sigurd Varian]] at [[Stanford University]]. Their prototype was completed and demonstrated successfully on August 30, 1937.<ref>Varian, Dorothy. \"The Inventor and the Pilot\". Pacific Books, 1983 p. 187</ref>  Upon publication in 1939,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> news of the klystron immediately influenced the work of US and UK researchers working on [[radar]] equipment. The Varians went on to found [[Varian Associates]] to commercialize the technology (for example, to make small [[linear accelerators]] to generate photons for external beam [[radiation therapy]]). Their work was preceded by the description of velocity modulation by A. Arsenjewa-Heil and [[Oskar Heil]] (wife and husband) in 1935, though the Varians were probably unaware of the Heils' work.<ref name=\"Heil\">{{cite journal|author=George Caryotakis|date=November 18, 1997|title=Invited paper: The Klystron: A microwave source of surprising range and endurance|url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/getdoc/slac-pub-7731.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=American Physics Society: Division of Plasma Physics Conference, Pittsburgh, PA|publisher=Stanford, CA: Stanford SLAC|volume=|pages=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924102609/http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/getdoc/slac-pub-7731.pdf|archive-date=September 24, 2015|via=|access-date=September 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe work of physicist [[W.W. Hansen]] was instrumental in the development of the klystron and was cited by the Varian brothers in their 1939 paper.  His resonator analysis, which dealt with the problem of accelerating electrons toward a target, could be used just as well to decelerate electrons (i.e., transfer their kinetic energy to RF energy in a resonator).  During the [[World War II|second World War]], Hansen lectured at the MIT Radiation labs two days a week, commuting to Boston from [[Sperry Gyroscope Company]] on Long Island.  His resonator was called a \"rhumbatron\" by the Varian brothers.<ref name=tubeguys />  Hansen died of [[beryllium disease]] in 1949 as a result of exposure to [[beryllium oxide]] (BeO).\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the Axis powers relied mostly on (then low-powered and long wavelength) klystron technology for their radar system microwave generation, while the Allies used the far more powerful but frequency-drifting technology of the [[cavity magnetron]] for much shorter-wavelength one centimeter microwave generation. Klystron tube technologies for very high-power applications, such as [[synchrotron]]s and radar systems, have since been developed.\n\nRight after the war, [[American Telephone and Telegraph|AT&T]] used 4 watt klystrons in its brand new network of [[microwave relay]] links that covered the US continent.<ref>Gerald W Brock , \"The Second Information Revolution\", Harvard University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0674028791}}, pp. 122,123</ref>  The network provided long-distance telephone service and also carried television signals for the major TV networks. [[Western Union|Western Union Telegraph Company]] also built point-to-point microwave communication links using intermediate repeater stations at about 40 mile intervals at that time, using 2K25 reflex klystrons in both the transmitters and receivers.\n\n== Operation ==\nKlystrons amplify [[Radio frequency|RF signals]] by converting the [[kinetic energy]] in a [[Direct current|DC]] [[Cathode ray|electron beam]] into radio frequency power. In a vacuum, a beam of electrons is emitted by an electron gun or [[Hot cathode|thermionic cathode]] (a heated pellet of low [[work function]] material), and accelerated by high-voltage electrodes (typically in the tens of kilovolts). \n\nThis beam passes through an input [[cavity resonator]].  RF energy has been fed into the input cavity at, or near, its [[resonant frequency]], creating [[standing wave]]s, which produce an oscillating voltage, which acts on the electron beam. The electric field causes the electrons to \"bunch\": electrons that pass through when the electric field opposes their motion are slowed, while electrons which pass through when the electric field is in the same direction are accelerated,  causing the previously continuous electron beam to form bunches at the input frequency.  \n\nTo reinforce the bunching, a klystron may contain additional \"buncher\" cavities.  \n\nThe beam then passes through a \"drift\" tube, in which the faster electrons catch up to the slower ones, creating the \"bunches\", then through a \"catcher\" cavity.  \n\nIn the output \"catcher\" cavity, each bunch enters the cavity at the time in the cycle when the electric field opposes the electrons' motion, decelerating them.  Thus the kinetic energy of the electrons is converted to potential energy of the field, increasing the amplitude of the [[Oscillation|oscillations]]. The oscillations excited in the catcher cavity are coupled out through a [[coaxial cable]] or [[waveguide]].  \n\nThe spent electron beam, with reduced energy, is captured by a collector electrode.\n\nTo make an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]], the output cavity can be coupled to the input cavity(s) with a [[coaxial cable]] or [[waveguide]]. [[Positive feedback]] excites spontaneous oscillations at the resonant frequency of the cavities.\n\n==Two-cavity klystron==\n[[File:Klystron.enp.gif|right]]\n\nThe simplest klystron tube is the two-cavity klystron.  In this tube there are two microwave cavity resonators, the \"catcher\" and the \"buncher\".  When used as an amplifier, the weak microwave signal to be amplified is applied to the buncher cavity through a coaxial cable or waveguide, and the amplified signal is extracted from the catcher cavity.\n\nAt one end of the tube is the [[hot cathode]] which produces electrons when heated by a filament.  The electrons are attracted to and pass through an [[anode]] cylinder at a high positive potential; the cathode and anode act as an [[electron gun]] to produce a high velocity stream of electrons.  An external [[electromagnet]] winding creates a longitudinal [[magnetic field]] along the beam axis which prevents the beam from spreading.\n\nThe beam first passes through the \"buncher\" cavity resonator, through grids attached to each side.  The buncher grids have an oscillating AC potential across them, produced by standing wave oscillations within the cavity, excited by the input signal at the cavity's [[resonant frequency]] applied by a coaxial cable or waveguide.  The direction of the field between the grids changes twice per cycle of the input signal.  Electrons entering when the entrance grid is negative and the exit grid is positive encounter an electric field in the same direction as their motion, and are accelerated by the field.  Electrons entering a half-cycle later, when the polarity is opposite, encounter an electric field which opposes their motion, and are decelerated.\n\nBeyond the buncher grids is a space called the ''drift space''.  This space is long enough so that the accelerated electrons catch up with electrons that were accelerated at an earlier time, forming \"bunches\" longitudinally along the beam axis.  Its length is chosen to allow maximum bunching at the resonant frequency, and may be several feet long.\n\n[[File:Klystron oscillator 1944.jpg|thumb|Klystron oscillator from 1944. The electron gun is on the right, the collector on the left.  The two [[cavity resonator]]s are in center, linked by a short coaxial cable to provide positive feedback.]]\n\nThe electrons then pass through a second cavity, called the \"catcher\", through a similar pair of grids on each side of the cavity.  The function of the ''catcher grids'' is to absorb energy from the electron beam.  The bunches of electrons passing through excite standing waves in the cavity, which has the same resonant frequency as the buncher cavity.  Each bunch of electrons passes between the grids at a point in the cycle when the exit grid is negative with respect to the entrance grid, so the electric field in the cavity between the grids opposes the electrons motion.  The electrons thus do work on the electric field, and are decelerated, their [[kinetic energy]] is converted to electric [[potential energy]], increasing the amplitude of the oscillating electric field in the cavity.  Thus the oscillating field in the catcher cavity is an amplified copy of the signal applied to the buncher cavity.  The amplified signal is extracted from the catcher cavity through a coaxial cable or waveguide.\n\nAfter passing through the catcher and giving up its energy, the lower energy electron beam is absorbed by a \"collector\" electrode, a second anode which is kept at a small positive voltage.\n\n===Klystron oscillator===\nAn [[electronic oscillator]] can be made from a klystron tube, by providing a [[feedback]] path from output to input by connecting the \"catcher\" and \"buncher\" cavities with a [[coaxial cable]] or [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]].  When the device is turned on, [[electronic noise]] in the cavity is amplified by the tube and fed back from the output catcher to the buncher cavity to be amplified again.  Because of the high [[Q factor|Q]] of the cavities, the signal quickly becomes a sine wave at the [[resonant frequency]] of the cavities.\n\n==Multicavity klystron==\nIn all modern klystrons, the number of cavities exceeds two.  Additional \"buncher\" cavities added between the first \"buncher\" and the \"catcher\" may be used to increase the gain of the klystron or to increase the bandwidth.<ref>{{citation|title=Microwave Devices and Circuits|first=|last=|publisher=Dorling Kinderley|isbn=978-81-7758-353-3|p=380|date=September 1990}}</ref>\n\nThe residual kinetic energy in the electron beam when it hits the collector electrode represents wasted energy, which is dissipated as heat, which must be removed by a cooling system.  Some modern klystrons include depressed collectors, which recover energy from the beam before collecting the electrons, increasing efficiency.  Multistage depressed collectors enhance the energy recovery by \"sorting\" the electrons in energy bins.\n\n==Reflex klystron==\n[[File:ExKlystron.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Low-power Russian reflex klystron from 1963.

It was used as a [[local oscillator]] in some radar receivers and a [[modulator]] in microwave transmitters the 1950s and 1960s, but is now obsolete, replaced by semiconductor microwave devices.\n\nIn the reflex klystron the electron beam passes through a single resonant cavity. The electrons are fired into one end of the tube by an [[electron gun]]. After passing through the resonant cavity they are reflected by a negatively charged reflector electrode for another pass through the cavity, where they are then collected.  The electron beam is velocity modulated when it first passes through the cavity. The formation of electron bunches takes place in the drift space between the reflector and the cavity. The [[volt]]age on the reflector must be adjusted so that the bunching is at a maximum as the electron beam re-enters the resonant cavity, thus ensuring a maximum of energy is transferred from the electron beam to the [[Radio frequency|RF]] oscillations in the cavity. The reflector voltage may be varied slightly from the optimum value, which results in some loss of output power, but also in a variation in frequency. This effect is used to good advantage for automatic frequency control in receivers, and in [[frequency modulation]] for transmitters. The level of modulation applied for transmission is small enough that the power output essentially remains constant. At regions far from the optimum voltage, no oscillations are obtained at all.<ref>{{citation|title=Reflex klystron|first=|last=|publisher=Dorling Kinderley|isbn=978-81-7758-353-3|pp=391,392|date=September 1990}}</ref>\nThere are often several regions of reflector voltage where the reflex klystron will oscillate; these are referred to as modes. The electronic tuning range of the reflex klystron is usually referred to as the variation in frequency between half power points&mdash;the points in the oscillating mode where the power output is half the maximum output in the mode.\n\nModern [[semiconductor]] technology has effectively replaced the reflex klystron in most applications.\n\n== Tuning ==\n[[File:Aust.-Synchrotron,-Klystron-for-Storage-Ring,-14.06.2007.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Large klystrons as used in the [[storage ring]] of the [[Australian Synchrotron]] to maintain the energy of the [[electron]] beam]]\n\nSome klystrons have cavities that are tunable.  By adjusting the frequency of individual cavities, the technician can change the operating frequency, gain, output power, or bandwidth of the amplifier. No two klystrons are exactly identical (even when comparing like part/model number klystrons). Each unit has manufacturer-supplied calibration values for its specific performance characteristics. Without this information the klystron would not be properly tunable, and hence not perform well, if at all.\n\nTuning a klystron is delicate work which, if not done properly, can cause damage to equipment or injury to the technician due to the very high voltages that could be produced. The technician must be careful not to exceed the limits of the graduations, or damage to the klystron can result. Other precautions taken when tuning a klystron include using nonferrous tools. Some klystrons employ permanent [[magnet]]s.  If a technician uses [[ferrous]] tools (which are [[ferromagnetic]]) and comes too close to the intense magnetic fields that contain the electron beam, such a tool can be pulled into the unit by the intense magnetic force, smashing fingers, injuring the technician, or damaging the unit. Special lightweight nonmagnetic (or rather very weakly [[diamagnetic]]) tools made of [[beryllium]] alloy have been used for tuning U.S. Air Force klystrons.\n\nPrecautions are routinely taken when transporting klystron devices in aircraft, as the intense magnetic field can interfere with magnetic navigation equipment. Special overpacks are designed to help limit this field \"in the field,\" and thus allow such devices to be transported safely.\n\n==Optical klystron==\nThe technique of amplification used in the klystron is also being applied experimentally at optical frequencies in a type of [[laser]] called the [[free-electron laser]] (FEL); these devices are called ''optical klystrons''.<ref name=\"Bonifacio\">{{cite journal|last1=Bonifacio|first1=R.|last2=Corsini|first2=R.|last3=Pierini|first3=P.|date=15 March 1992|title=Theory of the high gain optical klystron|url=http://wwwsrf.mi.infn.it/publications/papers/1992/files/PRA_45_4091.pdf|journal=Physical Review A|volume=45|issue=6|pages=4091|bibcode=1992PhRvA..45.4091B|doi=10.1103/physreva.45.4091|pmid=9907460|issn=|accessdate=June 24, 2014|via=}}</ref>  Instead of microwave cavities, these use devices called [[undulator]]s.  The electron beam passes through an undulator, in which a laser light beam causes bunching of the electrons.  Then the beam passes through a second undulator, in which the electron bunches cause oscillation to create a second, more powerful light beam.<ref name=\"Bonifacio\" />\n\n==Floating drift tube klystron==\nThe floating drift tube klystron has a single cylindrical chamber containing an electrically isolated central tube. Electrically, this is similar to the two cavity oscillator klystron with considerable feedback between the two cavities. Electrons exiting the source cavity are velocity modulated by the electric field as they travel through the drift tube and emerge at the destination chamber in bunches, delivering power to the oscillation in the cavity. This type of oscillator klystron has an advantage over the two-cavity klystron on which it is based, in that it needs only one tuning element to effect changes in frequency. The drift tube is electrically insulated from the cavity walls, and DC bias is applied separately. The DC bias on the drift tube may be adjusted to alter the transit time through it, thus allowing some electronic tuning of the oscillating frequency. The amount of tuning in this manner is not large and is normally used for frequency modulation when transmitting.\n\n==Applications==\nKlystrons can produce far higher microwave power outputs than [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] microwave devices such as [[Gunn diode]]s.  In modern systems, they are used from UHF (hundreds of megahertz) up to hundreds of gigahertz (as in the Extended Interaction Klystrons in the [[CloudSat]] satellite). Klystrons can be found at work in [[radar]], satellite and wideband high-power communication (very common in [[television]] [[broadcasting]] and EHF [[satellite]] terminals), medicine ([[radiation oncology]]), and [[high-energy physics]] ([[particle accelerator]]s and experimental reactors). At [[SLAC]], for example, klystrons are routinely employed which have outputs in the range of 50&nbsp;MW (pulse) and 50&nbsp;kW (time-averaged) at 2856&nbsp;MHz. The [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo Planetary Radar]] uses two klystrons that provide a total power output of 1&nbsp;MW (continuous) at 2380&nbsp;MHz.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=D.

It was invented by the brothers [[Russell and Sigurd Varian]] at [[Stanford University]].

Hansen]] was instrumental in the development of the klystron and was cited by the Varian brothers in their 1939 paper.  His resonator analysis, which dealt with the problem of accelerating electrons toward a target, could be used just as well to decelerate electrons (i.e., transfer their kinetic energy to RF energy in a resonator).  During the [[World War II|second World War]], Hansen lectured at the MIT Radiation labs two days a week, commuting to Boston from [[Sperry Gyroscope Company]] on Long Island.  His resonator was called a \"rhumbatron\" by the Varian brothers.<ref name=tubeguys />  Hansen died of [[beryllium disease]] in 1949 as a result of exposure to [[beryllium oxide]] (BeO).\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the Axis powers relied mostly on (then low-powered and long wavelength) klystron technology for their radar system microwave generation, while the Allies used the far more powerful but frequency-drifting technology of the [[cavity magnetron]] for much shorter-wavelength one centimeter microwave generation. Klystron tube technologies for very high-power applications, such as [[synchrotron]]s and radar systems, have since been developed.\n\nRight after the war, [[American Telephone and Telegraph|AT&T]] used 4 watt klystrons in its brand new network of [[microwave relay]] links that covered the US continent.<ref>Gerald W Brock , \"The Second Information Revolution\", Harvard University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0674028791}}, pp. 122,123</ref>  The network provided long distance telephone service and also carried television signals for the major TV networks. [[Western Union|Western Union Telegraph Company]] also built point-to-point microwave communication links using intermediate repeater stations at about 40 mile intervals at that time, using 2K25 reflex klystrons in both the transmitters and receivers.\n\n== Operation ==\nKlystrons amplify [[Radio frequency|RF signals]] by converting the [[kinetic energy]] in a [[Direct current|DC]] [[Cathode ray|electron beam]] into radio frequency power. In a vacuum, a beam of electrons is emitted by a electron gun or [[Hot cathode|thermionic cathode]] (a heated pellet of low [[work function]] material), and accelerated by high-voltage electrodes (typically in the tens of kilovolts). \n\nThis beam passes through an input [[cavity resonator]].  RF energy has been fed into the input cavity at, or near, its [[resonant frequency]], creating [[standing wave]]s, which produce an oscillating voltage, which acts on the electron beam. The electric field causes the electrons to \"bunch\": electrons that pass through when the electric field opposes their motion are slowed, while electrons which pass through when the electric field is in the same direction are accelerated,  causing the previously continuous electron beam to form bunches at the input frequency.  \n\nTo reinforce the bunching, a klystron may contain additional \"buncher\" cavities.  \n\nThe beam then passes through a \"drift\" tube, in which the faster electrons catch up to the slower ones, creating the \"bunches\", then through a \"catcher\" cavity.  \n\nIn the output \"catcher\" cavity, each bunch enters the cavity at the time in the cycle when the electric field opposes the electrons' motion, decelerating them.  Thus the kinetic energy of the electrons is converted to potential energy of the field, increasing the amplitude of the [[Oscillation|oscillations]]. The oscillations excited in the catcher cavity are coupled out through a [[coaxial cable]] or [[waveguide]].  \n\nThe spent electron beam, with reduced energy, is captured by a collector electrode.\n\nTo make an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]], the output cavity can be coupled to the input cavity(s) with a [[coaxial cable]] or [[waveguide]]. [[Positive feedback]] excites spontaneous oscillations at the resonant frequency of the cavities.\n\n==Two-cavity klystron==\n[[File:Klystron.enp.gif|right]]\n\nThe simplest klystron tube is the two-cavity klystron.  In this tube there are two microwave cavity resonators, the \"catcher\" and the \"buncher\".  When used as an amplifier, the weak microwave signal to be amplified is applied to the buncher cavity through a coaxial cable or waveguide, and the amplified signal is extracted from the catcher cavity.\n\nAt one end of the tube is the [[hot cathode]] which produces electrons when heated by a filament.  The electrons are attracted to and pass through an [[anode]] cylinder at a high positive potential; the cathode and anode act as an [[electron gun]] to produce a high velocity stream of electrons.  An external [[electromagnet]] winding creates a longitudinal [[magnetic field]] along the beam axis which prevents the beam from spreading.\n\nThe beam first passes through the \"buncher\" cavity resonator, through grids attached to each side.  The buncher grids have an oscillating AC potential across them, produced by standing wave oscillations within the cavity, excited by the input signal at the cavity's [[resonant frequency]] applied by a coaxial cable or waveguide.  The direction of the field between the grids changes twice per cycle of the input signal.  Electrons entering when the entrance grid is negative and the exit grid is positive encounter an electric field in the same direction as their motion, and are accelerated by the field.  Electrons entering a half-cycle later, when the polarity is opposite, encounter an electric field which opposes their motion, and are decelerated.\n\nBeyond the buncher grids is a space called the ''drift space''.  This space is long enough so that the accelerated electrons catch up with electrons that were accelerated at an earlier time, forming \"bunches\" longitudinally along the beam axis.  Its length is chosen to allow maximum bunching at the resonant frequency, and may be several feet long.\n\n[[File:Klystron oscillator 1944.jpg|thumb|Klystron oscillator from 1944. The electron gun is on the right, the collector on the left.  The two [[cavity resonator]]s are in center, linked by a short coaxial cable to provide positive feedback.]]\n\nThe electrons then pass through a second cavity, called the \"catcher\", through a similar pair of grids on each side of the cavity.  The function of the ''catcher grids'' is to absorb energy from the electron beam.  The bunches of electrons passing through excite standing waves in the cavity, which has the same resonant frequency as the buncher cavity.  Each bunch of electrons passes between the grids at a point in the cycle when the exit grid is negative with respect to the entrance grid, so the electric field in the cavity between the grids opposes the electrons motion.  The electrons thus do work on the electric field, and are decelerated, their [[kinetic energy]] is converted to electric [[potential energy]], increasing the amplitude of the oscillating electric field in the cavity.  Thus the oscillating field in the catcher cavity is an amplified copy of the signal applied to the buncher cavity.  The amplified signal is extracted from the catcher cavity through a coaxial cable or waveguide.\n\nAfter passing through the catcher and giving up its energy, the lower energy electron beam is absorbed by a \"collector\" electrode, a second anode which is kept at a small positive voltage.\n\n===Klystron oscillator===\nAn [[electronic oscillator]] can be made from a klystron tube, by providing a [[feedback]] path from output to input by connecting the \"catcher\" and \"buncher\" cavities with a [[coaxial cable]] or [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]].  When the device is turned on, [[electronic noise]] in the cavity is amplified by the tube and fed back from the output catcher to the buncher cavity to be amplified again.  Because of the high [[Q factor|Q]] of the cavities, the signal quickly becomes a sine wave at the [[resonant frequency]] of the cavities.\n\n==Multicavity klystron==\nIn all modern klystrons, the number of cavities exceeds two.  Additional \"buncher\" cavities added between the first \"buncher\" and the \"catcher\" may be used to increase the gain of the klystron or to increase the bandwidth.<ref>{{citation|title=Microwave Devices and Circuits|first=|last=|publisher=Dorling Kinderley|isbn=978-81-7758-353-3|p=380|date=September 1990}}</ref>\n\nThe residual kinetic energy in the electron beam when it hits the collector electrode represents wasted energy, which is dissipated as heat, which must be removed by a cooling system.  Some modern klystrons include depressed collectors, which recover energy from the beam before collecting the electrons, increasing efficiency.  Multistage depressed collectors enhance the energy recovery by \"sorting\" the electrons in energy bins.\n\n==Reflex klystron==\n[[File:ExKlystron.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Low-power Russian reflex klystron from 1963.

It was used as a [[local oscillator]] in some radar receivers and a [[modulator]] in microwave transmitters the 1950s and 1960s, but is now obsolete, replaced by semiconductor microwave devices.\n\nIn the reflex klystron the electron beam passes through a single resonant cavity. The electrons are fired into one end of the tube by an [[electron gun]]. After passing through the resonant cavity they are reflected by a negatively charged reflector electrode for another pass through the cavity, where they are then collected.  The electron beam is velocity modulated when it first passes through the cavity. The formation of electron bunches takes place in the drift space between the reflector and the cavity. The [[volt]]age on the reflector must be adjusted so that the bunching is at a maximum as the electron beam re-enters the resonant cavity, thus ensuring a maximum of energy is transferred from the electron beam to the [[Radio frequency|RF]] oscillations in the cavity. The reflector voltage may be varied slightly from the optimum value, which results in some loss of output power, but also in a variation in frequency. This effect is used to good advantage for automatic frequency control in receivers, and in [[frequency modulation]] for transmitters. The level of modulation applied for transmission is small enough that the power output essentially remains constant. At regions far from the optimum voltage, no oscillations are obtained at all.<ref>{{citation|title=Reflex klystron|first=|last=|publisher=Dorling Kinderley|isbn=978-81-7758-353-3|pp=391,392|date=September 1990}}</ref>\nThere are often several regions of reflector voltage where the reflex klystron will oscillate; these are referred to as modes. The electronic tuning range of the reflex klystron is usually referred to as the variation in frequency between half power points&mdash;the points in the oscillating mode where the power output is half the maximum output in the mode.\n\nModern [[semiconductor]] technology has effectively replaced the reflex klystron in most applications.\n\n== Tuning ==\n[[File:Aust.-Synchrotron,-Klystron-for-Storage-Ring,-14.06.2007.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Large klystrons as used in the [[storage ring]] of the [[Australian Synchrotron]] to maintain the energy of the [[electron]] beam]]\n\nSome klystrons have cavities that are tunable.  By adjusting the frequency of individual cavities, the technician can change the operating frequency, gain, output power, or bandwidth of the amplifier. No two klystrons are exactly identical (even when comparing like part/model number klystrons). Each unit has manufacturer-supplied calibration values for its specific performance characteristics. Without this information the klystron would not be properly tunable, and hence not perform well, if at all.\n\nTuning a klystron is delicate work which, if not done properly, can cause damage to equipment or injury to the technician due to the very high voltages that could be produced. The technician must be careful not to exceed the limits of the graduations, or damage to the klystron can result. Other precautions taken when tuning a klystron include using nonferrous tools. Some klystrons employ permanent [[magnet]]s.  If a technician uses [[ferrous]] tools (which are [[ferromagnetic]]) and comes too close to the intense magnetic fields that contain the electron beam, such a tool can be pulled into the unit by the intense magnetic force, smashing fingers, injuring the technician, or damaging the unit. Special lightweight nonmagnetic (or rather very weakly [[diamagnetic]]) tools made of [[beryllium]] alloy have been used for tuning U.S. Air Force klystrons.\n\nPrecautions are routinely taken when transporting klystron devices in aircraft, as the intense magnetic field can interfere with magnetic navigation equipment. Special overpacks are designed to help limit this field \"in the field,\" and thus allow such devices to be transported safely.\n\n==Optical klystron==\nThe technique of amplification used in the klystron is also being applied experimentally at optical frequencies in a type of [[laser]] called the [[free-electron laser]] (FEL); these devices are called ''optical klystrons''.<ref name=\"Bonifacio\">{{cite journal|last1=Bonifacio|first1=R.|last2=Corsini|first2=R.|last3=Pierini|first3=P.|date=15 March 1992|title=Theory of the high gain optical klystron|url=http://wwwsrf.mi.infn.it/publications/papers/1992/files/PRA_45_4091.pdf|journal=Physical Review A|volume=45|issue=6|pages=4091|bibcode=1992PhRvA..45.4091B|doi=10.1103/physreva.45.4091|pmid=9907460|issn=|accessdate=June 24, 2014|via=}}</ref>  Instead of microwave cavities, these use devices called [[undulator]]s.  The electron beam passes through an undulator, in which a laser light beam causes bunching of the electrons.  Then the beam passes through a second undulator, in which the electron bunches cause oscillation to create a second, more powerful light beam.<ref name=\"Bonifacio\" />\n\n==Floating drift tube klystron==\nThe floating drift tube klystron has a single cylindrical chamber containing an electrically isolated central tube. Electrically, this is similar to the two cavity oscillator klystron with considerable feedback between the two cavities. Electrons exiting the source cavity are velocity modulated by the electric field as they travel through the drift tube and emerge at the destination chamber in bunches, delivering power to the oscillation in the cavity. This type of oscillator klystron has an advantage over the two-cavity klystron on which it is based, in that it needs only one tuning element to effect changes in frequency. The drift tube is electrically insulated from the cavity walls, and DC bias is applied separately. The DC bias on the drift tube may be adjusted to alter the transit time through it, thus allowing some electronic tuning of the oscillating frequency. The amount of tuning in this manner is not large and is normally used for frequency modulation when transmitting.\n\n==Applications==\nKlystrons can produce far higher microwave power outputs than [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] microwave devices such as [[Gunn diode]]s.  In modern systems, they are used from UHF (hundreds of megahertz) up to hundreds of gigahertz (as in the Extended Interaction Klystrons in the [[CloudSat]] satellite). Klystrons can be found at work in [[radar]], satellite and wideband high-power communication (very common in [[television]] [[broadcasting]] and EHF [[satellite]] terminals), medicine ([[radiation oncology]]), and [[high-energy physics]] ([[particle accelerator]]s and experimental reactors). At [[SLAC]], for example, klystrons are routinely employed which have outputs in the range of 50&nbsp;MW (pulse) and 50&nbsp;kW (time-averaged) at 2856&nbsp;MHz. The [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo Planetary Radar]] uses two klystrons that provide a total power output of 1&nbsp;MW (continuous) at 2380&nbsp;MHz.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=D.

He had already been summoned to Parliament as '''Lord Harclay''' (or Lord Harcla) in 1321. However, Lord Carlisle was executed for treason in 1322, with his titles forfeited.\n\nThe second creation came in 1622, when [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle|James Hay, 1st Viscount Doncaster]], was made '''Earl of Carlisle'''.<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Carlisle, Earls of}}</ref> He was a great favourite of [[James VI and I|James I]] and had already been created '''Lord Hay''' in the [[Peerage of Scotland]] in 1606, as well as '''Baron Hay''', of Sawley in the County of York, and '''Viscount Doncaster''' in 1618. The latter titles were in the Peerage of England. Lord Carlisle was the member of a junior branch of the Hay family, headed by the [[Earl of Erroll]]. He was succeeded by his second but only surviving son, the second Earl. In 1637, he also succeeded his maternal grandfather, Charles Goring, 2nd Earl of Norwich, as second Baron Denny (a title created by writ in 1604; see [[Earl of Norwich]]). However, Carlisle was childless and on his death in 1660, all the titles became extinct.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe third creation came in 1660, when [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle|Sir Charles Howard]] was made '''Baron Dacre of Gillesland''', in the County of Cumberland, '''Viscount Howard of Morpeth''', in the County of Northumberland, and '''Earl of Carlisle'''. A member of the prominent [[Howard family]], he was the great-grandson of [[Lord William Howard]], third son of [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk]]. Lord William Howard's wife was Elizabeth Dacre, youngest daughter of [[Thomas Dacre, 4th Baron Dacre]] (of Gillesland), a title which had fallen into [[abeyance]] on the death of the fifth Baron in 1569. Through this marriage, [[Naworth Castle]] and Henderskelfe Castle (which later became the site of [[Castle Howard]]) came into the Howard family. Lord Carlisle had earlier supported the Parliamentarian cause in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], and he is supposed to have been created ''Baron Gilsland'' and ''Viscount Howard of Morpeth'' by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in 1657 (it is certain that he was summoned to Cromwell's House of Lords the same year as \"Lord Viscount Howard\").<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nHe was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Edward Howard, 2nd Earl of Carlisle|the second Earl]]. He represented [[Morpeth (UK Parliament constituency)|Morpeth]], [[Cumberland (UK Parliament constituency)|Cumberland]] and [[Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)|Carlisle]] in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] and served as [[Lord Lieutenant of Cumberland]]. On his death, the titles passed to his son, [[Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle|the third Earl]].<ref name=EB1911/> He was a prominent statesman and served as [[First Lord of the Treasury]] from 1701 to 1702, and in 1715. His third but eldest surviving son, [[Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle|the fourth Earl]],<ref name=EB1911/> sat as Member of Parliament for Morpeth. He was succeeded by his eldest son from his second marriage, [[Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle|the fifth Earl]]. He was an influential politician and held office as [[First Lord of Trade]], as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], as [[Lord Steward of the Household]] and as [[Lord Privy Seal]].\n\nHis eldest son, [[George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle|the sixth Earl]], also gained political prominence. He served as [[First Commissioner of Woods and Forests]] and as [[Lord Privy Seal]], and was [[Minister without Portfolio]] between 1830 and 1834 in the famous [[Whig Government 1830-1834|Whig government]] of [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]]. He was succeeded by his eldest son, [[George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle|the seventh Earl]]. He was a noted politician and served as [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], as [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] and as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]]. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the eighth Earl. He was a clergyman and served as Rector of [[Londesborough]] in Yorkshire. He also died unmarried and was succeeded by his nephew, the ninth Earl. He was the son of the Hon. [[Charles Wentworth George Howard]], fifth son of the sixth Earl. He represented [[Cumberland East (UK Parliament constituency)|Cumberland East]] in Parliament as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and was also a well-regarded painter.\n\nHis eldest son, the tenth Earl, was [[Liberal Unionist]] Member of Parliament for [[Birmingham South (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham South]]. He was succeeded by his only son, the eleventh Earl. He married as his first wife Bridget Helen Monckton, 11th Lady Ruthven of Freeland (see [[Lord Ruthven of Freeland]] for earlier history of this title). On his death in 1963, the titles passed to his only son, the twelfth Earl. In 1982, he also succeeded his mother as twelfth Lord Ruthven of Freeland. {{As of|2020}}, the peerages are held by his eldest son, the thirteenth Earl, who succeeded in 1994. Lord Carlisle unsuccessfully contested [[Easington (UK Parliament constituency)|Easington]] in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]] and [[Leeds West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds West]] in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]].\n\nSeveral other members of this branch of the Howard family have gained distinction. The Hon. [[Charles Howard (British army officer)|Sir Charles Howard]], fourth son of the third Earl, was a general in the Army and also represented Carlisle in the House of Commons for many years. [[Charles Howard, Viscount Morpeth]], eldest son of the fourth Earl from his first marriage, briefly represented [[Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire]] before his early death from [[tuberculosis]]. The Hon. Frederick Howard, third son of the fifth Earl, was a major in the [[10th Hussars]] and fought at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815, where he was killed in action. His eldest son [[Frederick John Howard]] was Member of Parliament for [[Youghal (UK Parliament constituency)|Youghal]]. The Very Reverend the Hon. Henry Edward John Howard, fourth son of the fifth Earl, was Dean of Lichfield. His third son Edward Henry Howard was a [[vice-admiral]] in the Navy.\n\nAdmiral the Hon. [[Edward Howard, 1st Baron Lanerton|Edward Granville George Howard]], fourth son of the sixth Earl, was created [[Baron Lanerton]] in 1874. The aforementioned the Hon. [[Charles Wentworth George Howard]], fifth son of the sixth Earl, represented [[East Cumberland (UK Parliament constituency)|East Cumberland]] in Parliament for almost forty years. [[Harriet Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland|Lady Harriet Howard]], third daughter of the sixth Earl, was the wife of [[George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland]]. She was [[Mistress of the Robes]] to [[Queen Victoria]] and an active [[Whig Party (UK)|Whig]] in society circles. The Hon. [[Geoffrey William Algernon Howard]], fifth son of the ninth Earl, was a Liberal Member of Parliament. His second son was [[George Howard, Baron Howard of Henderskelfe]].\n\nThe [[heir apparent]] to the earldom, when one exists, is styled ''Viscount Morpeth''.\n\nThe principal family seat today is [[Naworth Castle]], while [[Castle Howard]] is now held by a [[cadet branch]] of the family.\n\n==Earls of Carlisle, First Creation (1322)==\n* [[Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle]] (died 1323) (forfeit 1323)\n\n==Earls of Carlisle, Second Creation (1622)==\n* [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle]] (c. 1590\u20131636)\n* [[James Hay, 2nd Earl of Carlisle]] (1612\u20131660) (extinct)\n\n==Earls of Carlisle, Third Creation (1661)==\n* [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle]] (1629\u20131685)\n* [[Edward Howard, 2nd Earl of Carlisle]] (1646\u20131692); eldest son of the 1st Earl\n* [[Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle]] (1669\u20131738); eldest son of the 2nd Earl\n* [[Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle]] (1694\u20131758); eldest son of the 3rd Earl\n** Hon.

He had already been summoned to Parliament as '''Lord Harclay''' (or Lord Harcla) in 1321. However, Lord Carlisle was executed for treason in 1322, with his titles forfeited.\n\nThe second creation came in 1622, when [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle|James Hay, 1st Viscount Doncaster]], was made '''Earl of Carlisle'''.<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Carlisle, Earls of}}</ref> He was a great favourite of [[James VI and I|James I]] and had already been created '''Lord Hay''' in the [[Peerage of Scotland]] in 1606, as well as '''Baron Hay''', of Sawley in the County of York, and '''Viscount Doncaster''' in 1618. The latter titles were in the Peerage of England. Lord Carlisle was the member of a junior branch of the Hay family, headed by the [[Earl of Erroll]]. He was succeeded by his second but only surviving son, the second Earl. In 1637, he also succeeded his maternal grandfather, Charles Goring, 2nd Earl of Norwich, as second Baron Denny (a title created by writ in 1604; see [[Earl of Norwich]]). However, Carlisle was childless and on his death in 1660, all the titles became extinct.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe third creation came in 1660, when [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle|Sir Charles Howard]] was made '''Baron Dacre of Gillesland''', in the County of Cumberland, '''Viscount Howard of Morpeth''', in the County of Northumberland, and '''Earl of Carlisle'''. A member of the prominent [[Howard family]], he was the great-grandson of [[Lord William Howard]], third son of [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk]]. Lord William Howard's wife was Elizabeth Dacre, youngest daughter of [[Thomas Dacre, 4th Baron Dacre]] (of Gillesland), a title which had fallen into [[abeyance]] on the death of the fifth Baron in 1569. Through this marriage, [[Naworth Castle]] and Henderskelfe Castle (which later became the site of [[Castle Howard]]) came into the Howard family. Lord Carlisle had earlier supported the Parliamentarian cause in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], and he is supposed to have been created ''Baron Gilsland'' and ''Viscount Howard of Morpeth'' by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in 1657 (it is certain that he was summoned to Cromwell's House of Lords the same year as \"Lord Viscount Howard\").<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nHe was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Edward Howard, 2nd Earl of Carlisle|the second Earl]]. He represented [[Morpeth (UK Parliament constituency)|Morpeth]], [[Cumberland (UK Parliament constituency)|Cumberland]] and [[Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)|Carlisle]] in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] and served as [[Lord Lieutenant of Cumberland]]. On his death, the titles passed to his son, [[Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle|the third Earl]].<ref name=EB1911/> He was a prominent statesman and served as [[First Lord of the Treasury]] from 1701 to 1702, and in 1715. His third but eldest surviving son, [[Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle|the fourth Earl]],<ref name=EB1911/> sat as Member of Parliament for Morpeth. He was succeeded by his eldest son from his second marriage, [[Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle|the fifth Earl]]. He was an influential politician and held office as [[First Lord of Trade]], as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], as [[Lord Steward of the Household]] and as [[Lord Privy Seal]].\n\nHis eldest son, [[George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle|the sixth Earl]], also gained political prominence. He served as [[First Commissioner of Woods and Forests]] and as [[Lord Privy Seal]], and was [[Minister without Portfolio]] between 1830 and 1834 in the famous [[Whig Government 1830-1834|Whig government]] of [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]]. He was succeeded by his eldest son, [[George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle|the seventh Earl]]. He was a noted politician and served as [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], as [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] and as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]]. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the eighth Earl. He was a clergyman and served as Rector of [[Londesborough]] in Yorkshire. He also died unmarried and was succeeded by his nephew, the ninth Earl. He was the son of the Hon. [[Charles Wentworth George Howard]], fifth son of the sixth Earl. He represented [[Cumberland East (UK Parliament constituency)|Cumberland East]] in Parliament as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and was also a well-regarded painter.\n\nHis eldest son, the tenth Earl, was [[Liberal Unionist]] Member of Parliament for [[Birmingham South (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham South]]. He was succeeded by his only son, the eleventh Earl. He married as his first wife Bridget Helen Monckton, 11th Lady Ruthven of Freeland (see [[Lord Ruthven of Freeland]] for earlier history of this title). On his death in 1963, the titles passed to his only son, the twelfth Earl. In 1982, he also succeeded his mother as twelfth Lord Ruthven of Freeland. {{As of|2020}}, the peerages are held by his eldest son, the thirteenth Earl, who succeeded in 1994. Lord Carlisle unsuccessfully contested [[Easington (UK Parliament constituency)|Easington]] in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]] and [[Leeds West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds West]] in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]].\n\nSeveral other members of this branch of the Howard family have gained distinction. The Hon. [[Charles Howard (British army officer)|Sir Charles Howard]], fourth son of the third Earl, was a general in the Army and also represented Carlisle in the House of Commons for many years. [[Charles Howard, Viscount Morpeth]], eldest son of the fourth Earl from his first marriage, briefly represented [[Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire]] before his early death from [[tuberculosis]]. The Hon. Frederick Howard, third son of the fifth Earl, was a major in the [[10th Hussars]] and fought at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815, where he was killed in action. His eldest son [[Frederick John Howard]] was Member of Parliament for [[Youghal (UK Parliament constituency)|Youghal]]. The Very Reverend the Hon. Henry Edward John Howard, fourth son of the fifth Earl, was Dean of Lichfield. His third son Edward Henry Howard was a [[vice-admiral]] in the Navy.\n\nAdmiral the Hon. [[Edward Howard, 1st Baron Lanerton|Edward Granville George Howard]], fourth son of the sixth Earl, was created [[Baron Lanerton]] in 1874. The aforementioned the Hon. [[Charles Wentworth George Howard]], fifth son of the sixth Earl, represented [[East Cumberland (UK Parliament constituency)|East Cumberland]] in Parliament for almost forty years. [[Harriet Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland|Lady Harriet Howard]], third daughter of the sixth Earl, was the wife of [[George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland]]. She was [[Mistress of the Robes]] to [[Queen Victoria]] and an active [[Whig Party (UK)|Whig]] in society circles. The Hon. [[Geoffrey William Algernon Howard]], fifth son of the ninth Earl, was a Liberal Member of Parliament. His second son was [[George Howard, Baron Howard of Henderskelfe]].\n\nThe [[heir apparent]] to the earldom, when one exists, is styled ''Viscount Morpeth''.\n\nThe principal family seat today is [[Naworth Castle]], while [[Castle Howard]] is now held by a [[cadet branch]] of the family.\n\n==Earls of Carlisle, First Creation (1322)==\n* [[Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle]] (died 1323) (forfeit 1323)\n\n==Earls of Carlisle, Second Creation (1622)==\n* [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle]] (c. 1590\u20131636)\n* [[James Hay, 2nd Earl of Carlisle]] (1612\u20131660) (extinct)\n\n==Earls of Carlisle, Third Creation (1661)==\n* [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle]] (1629\u20131685)\n* [[Edward Howard, 2nd Earl of Carlisle]] (1646\u20131692); eldest son of the 1st Earl\n* [[Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle]] (1669\u20131738); eldest son of the 2nd Earl\n* [[Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle]] (1694\u20131758); eldest son of the 3rd Earl\n** Hon.
