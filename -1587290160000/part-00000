Created by  [[John Masius]] and executive produced by [[Martha Williamson]], the series stars [[Roma Downey]], as an [[angel]] named Monica, and [[Della Reese]], as her supervisor Tess. Throughout the series, Monica is tasked with bringing guidance and messages from [[God]] to various people who are at a crossroads in their lives. From season three onward, they are frequently joined by Andrew ([[John Dye]]), the angel of death (who first appeared as a recurring character in season two). The series went into syndication in 1998, and has aired on [[Ion Television]] (formerly PAX-TV), [[Hallmark Channel]], [[CBS Drama]], [[Up (TV network)|Up]], [[Disney Channel (UK and Ireland)|Disney Channel UK]], [[MeTV]] and [[Start TV]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe episodes of the series generally revolved around the \"cases\" of Monica (played by Roma Downey), an angel recently promoted from the \"search and rescue\" division, who works under the guidance of Tess (played by Della Reese), a sarcastic boss who is sometimes hard on her young colleague, but is more of a surrogate mother than a mentor. Monica in one episode outlines that she started in the choir, then annunciations, followed by search and rescue and then case work. Most cases involve a single person or a group of people who are at a crossroads in their lives and facing a large problem or tough decision. Monica and Tess bring them messages of hope from God and give them guidance to help make decisions. During their first episode, the pair receive a red 1972 [[Cadillac Eldorado]] convertible as a gift; they use it for transportation throughout the rest of the series while in the human world, with Tess doing the driving. As the series progresses, Monica continues gaining experience as a case worker and, during some cases must learn lessons of her own.\n\nDuring the series pilot, an [[Death (personification)#In Abrahamic religions|angel of death]] named Adam is introduced. In the season two premiere, \"Interview with an Angel\", the Angel of Death is introduced as Henry. In the season two episode entitled, \"The One That Got Away\" Andrew (played by John Dye) is introduced as the Angel of Death. (Initially a recurring character, he becomes a main character in season three, making him the permanent Angel of Death for the remainder of the series.)\n\nDuring season seven, a new angel, Gloria (Valerie Bertinelli), is sent by God during one of Monica's assignments. She becomes a regular character for seasons eight and nine, as a trainee under Monica and Tess's guidance.\n\nIn the series finale, Monica is up for promotion to supervisor, pending the outcome of a difficult case in which she must defend Zach ([[Scott Bairstow]]), an innocent drifter accused of causing a boiler explosion at a school two years ago in the small town of Ascension, Colorado. The explosion killed most of the children, leaving the citizens devastated. During the case, Monica sees many familiar faces, including Joey Machulis (Paul Wittenburg), one of Monica's previous assignments who is a witness to the events, his brother Wayne ([[Randy Travis]]), who is now sheriff, Sophie ([[Marion Ross]]), a formerly homeless acquaintance, and Mike ([[Patrick Duffy]]), a lawyer Monica saved during her search and rescue days who is now the Mayor. An out of town developer claims Zach is the perpetrator and despite the lack of evidence, Zach is put on trial. Monica does all she can to help him, including asking Mike to represent him, but the prosecutor in the case, Jones, is really [[Satan]] in disguise, and Zach is eventually convicted.\n\nAfter the trial, Monica is able to help the citizens realize their mistake and to see that Zach's return to the town had helped them finally start living again. They begin going back to church, welcomed by the pastor they had once abandoned. Their change of heart, however, cannot free Zach, so Monica visits him in jail and reveals that she is an angel. She then promises him that she will become his guardian angel, forgoing all future assignments and the coveted promotion, to protect him from harm in prison. When she returns in the morning, however, the cell is empty. The citizens decide not to search for him, and it is revealed that Joey inadvertently caused the explosion after the devil tricked him into turning the boiler too high to warm some kittens he'd found.\n\nThe perplexed Monica returns to the desert to find Tess and Zach. There, she learns that Zach was actually Jesus,<ref>[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946-Present (pg.1414)]</ref> and that her defending him was a test, which she passed by being willing to sacrifice herself for him. Monica is promoted to supervisor. As she leaves, she says her goodbyes to Gloria, and to Andrew, who gives her a pocket watch to remember their friendship by. Before parting, Tess gives Monica the keys to the Cadillac, as she is leaving her job to sit at God's feet. Monica is last shown driving away as the camera pans out over the desert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marthawilliamson.com/touched-by-an-angel-original/?cat=touched-by-an-angel&vid=5518&doing_wp_cron=1545855569.3344330787658691406250|title=Episode 922: \"I Will Walk With You\" Part Two|author=Martha Williamson}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main===\n*[[Roma Downey]] as Monica, Tess's kind-hearted angel in her teenage years, who is sent town-to-town to encourage people.

Though getting the position was no longer a sure thing, she passed up a more lucrative position directing a [[court]] [[drama]] and went in for an interview with CBS in June 1994. During her interview, she states she emphasized that she was a Christian and could only do a show that depicted angels in a way she felt was true to her view of angels and that was respectful towards [[God]]. She also indicated that the pilot should be redone from the beginning, keeping only the characters Monica and Tess, reworked. The studio agreed with her remarks and hired her.<ref name=\"Martha\" /> Williamson herself wrote a new script for the [[pilot episode]], while also working on hiring the remaining staff for the series, which was due to premiere in September.

Created by  [[John Masius]] and executive produced by [[Martha Williamson]], the series stars [[Roma Downey]], as an [[angel]] named Monica, and [[Della Reese]], as her supervisor Tess. Throughout the series, Monica is tasked with bringing guidance and messages from [[God]] to various people who are at a crossroads in their lives. From season three onward, they are frequently joined by Andrew ([[John Dye]]), the angel of death (who first appeared as a recurring character in season two). The series went into syndication in 1998, and has aired on [[Ion Television]] (formerly PAX-TV), [[Hallmark Channel]], [[CBS Drama]], [[Up (TV network)|Up]], [[Disney Channel (UK and Ireland)|Disney Channel UK]], [[MeTV]] and [[Start TV]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe episodes of the series generally revolved around the \"cases\" of Monica (played by Roma Downey), an angel recently promoted from the \"search and rescue\" division, who works under the guidance of Tess (played by Della Reese), a sarcastic boss who is sometimes hard on her young colleague, but is more of a surrogate mother than a mentor. Monica in one episode outlines that she started in the choir, then annunciations, followed by search and rescue and then case work. Most cases involve a single person or a group of people who are at a crossroads in their lives and facing a large problem or tough decision. Monica and Tess bring them messages of hope from God and give them guidance to help make decisions. During their first episode, the pair receive a red 1972 [[Cadillac Eldorado]] convertible as a gift; they use it for transportation throughout the rest of the series while in the human world, with Tess doing the driving. As the series progresses, Monica continues gaining experience as a case worker and, during some cases must learn lessons of her own.\n\nDuring the series pilot, an [[Death (personification)#In Abrahamic religions|angel of death]] named Adam is introduced. In the season two premiere, \"Interview with an Angel\", the Angel of Death is introduced as Henry. In the season two episode entitled, \"The One That Got Away\" Andrew (played by John Dye) is introduced as the Angel of Death. (Initially a recurring character, he becomes a main character in season three, making him the permanent Angel of Death for the remainder of the series.)\n\nDuring season seven, a new angel, Gloria (Valerie Bertinelli), is sent by God during one of Monica's assignments. She becomes a regular character for seasons eight and nine, as a trainee under Monica and Tess's guidance.\n\nIn the series finale, Monica is up for promotion to supervisor, pending the outcome of a difficult case in which she must defend Zach ([[Scott Bairstow]]), an innocent drifter accused of causing a boiler explosion at a school two years ago in the small town of Ascension, Colorado. The explosion killed most of the children, leaving the citizens devastated. During the case, Monica sees many familiar faces, including Joey Machulis (Paul Wittenburg), one of Monica's previous assignments who is a witness to the events, his brother Wayne ([[Randy Travis]]), who is now sheriff, Sophie ([[Marion Ross]]), a formerly homeless acquaintance, and Mike ([[Patrick Duffy]]), a lawyer Monica saved during her search and rescue days who is now the Mayor. An out of town developer claims Zach is the perpetrator and despite the lack of evidence, Zach is put on trial. Monica does all she can to help him, including asking Mike to represent him, but the prosecutor in the case, Jones, is really [[Satan]] in disguise, and Zach is eventually convicted.\n\nAfter the trial, Monica is able to help the citizens realize their mistake and to see that Zach's return to the town had helped them finally start living again. They begin going back to church, welcomed by the pastor they had once abandoned. Their change of heart, however, cannot free Zach, so Monica visits him in jail and reveals that she is an angel. She then promises him that she will become his guardian angel, forgoing all future assignments and the coveted promotion, to protect him from harm in prison. When she returns in the morning, however, the cell is empty. The citizens decide not to search for him, and it is revealed that Joey inadvertently caused the explosion after the devil tricked him into turning the boiler too high to warm some kittens he'd found.\n\nThe perplexed Monica returns to the desert to find Tess and Zach. There, she learns that Zach was actually Jesus,<ref>[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946-Present (pg.1414)]</ref> and that her defending him was a test, which she passed by being willing to sacrifice herself for him. Monica is promoted to supervisor. As she leaves, she says her goodbyes to Gloria, and to Andrew, who gives her a pocket watch to remember their friendship by. Before parting, Tess gives Monica the keys to the Cadillac, as she is leaving her job to sit at God's feet. Monica is last shown driving away as the camera pans out over the desert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marthawilliamson.com/touched-by-an-angel-original/?cat=touched-by-an-angel&vid=5518&doing_wp_cron=1545855569.3344330787658691406250|title=Episode 922: \"I Will Walk With You\" Part Two|author=Martha Williamson}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main===\n*[[Roma Downey]] as Monica, Tess's kind-hearted angel in her teenage years, who is sent town-to-town to encourage people.
