He previously coached {{nrut|Australia}} between 2001 and 2005, taking the team to the [[2003 Rugby World Cup Final]]. He was an assistant coach for [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] when the Springboks won the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] and from 2012 to 2015 he coached {{nrut|Japan}}, leading them in the [[2015 Rugby World Cup]] and their upset win over South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/19/south-africa-japan-rugby-world-cup-2015-match-report|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 September 2015|author=Rob Kitson |title=Rugby World Cup's Greatest Shock |accessdate=19 December 2018}}</ref> In November 2015, Jones was appointed as head coach for England and led them to win the [[2016 Six Nations Championship]]. Three years later, he led them through the [[2019 Rugby World Cup]] where they defeated defending champions [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] in the semi-finals before losing the final to Jones' former side South Africa.\n\nJones played as a [[Hooker (rugby union)|hooker]] for Sydney club [[Randwick DRUFC|Randwick]] and [[NSW Waratahs|New South Wales]] and began coaching Randwick in 1994. He continued his career in [[Japan]] between 1995 and 1997 for [[Tokai University]], as an assistant to the Japanese national side and for [[Suntory Sungoliath]]. In 1998 he returned to Australia, taking charge of [[ACT Brumbies]] in [[Super Rugby]] and also coached the [[Queensland Reds]] in the 2007 Super Rugby season. In 2008, he had a brief spell at [[Saracens F.C.|Saracens]] in England's [[Premiership Rugby]], before returning to Japan and Suntory Sungoliath for a second spell which culminated in winning the [[2011\u201312 Top League]] championship.\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe was born in [[Burnie, Tasmania]],<ref name=ESPNprofile /> to a [[Japanese Americans|Japanese American]] mother and an Australian father.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.joe.co.uk/sport/eddie-jones-japan-rugby-239236 |title=England coach Eddie Jones on how he made Japan a force in world rugby |date=October 2019 |website=[[Joe (website)|Joe]] |access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref> He is married to Hiroko Jones, a Japanese woman whom he met while teaching at the [[International Grammar School]] in [[Sydney]].<ref name=\"Telegraph20160129\">{{Cite news|url=https://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/projects/Making-Eddie-Jones/index.html |title=The Making of Eddie Jones |last=Brown |first=Oliver |date=2016-01-29 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |access-date=2019-10-28}}</ref> They have a daughter, Chelsea Jones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/opinion/106716698/departures-are-sign-that-eddie-jones-has-driven-his-staff-too-hard|title=Departures are sign that Eddie Jones has driven his staff too hard|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref>\nhe also had sex most of his life\n\n==Playing career==\nJones's playing career began at [[Matraville Sports High School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celebrityspeakers.com.au/eddie-jones/|title=Eddie Jones}}</ref> He played as a [[Hooker (rugby union)|hooker]] for [[Randwick DRUFC|Randwick]] and [[NSW Waratahs|New South Wales]].<ref name=\"Telegraph20160129\" /> Jones played against the [[British and Irish Lions]] for New South Wales B in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/match-overview.php?section=lineups&fixid=61745 |title=NEW SOUTH WALES B 19 \u2013 39 BRITISH & IRISH LIONS }}</ref>  He also made three appearances for [[Leicester Tigers|Leicester]] during the 1991/92 season in England.

Then he went to [[Japan]] where he had brief stints coaching [[Tokai University]], [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]] (as assistant coach) and [[Suntory Sungoliath]].\n\n===ACT Brumbies===\nJones returned to Australia in 1998 to coach the [[ACT Brumbies]].  Jones had a disappointing first season only finishing 10th in the Super 12 his first season in charge; he has since said he was \"way out of his depth\" in his first season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenational.ae/sport/eddie-jones-eyes-england-and-japan-vacancies-1.632141 |title=Eddie Jones eyes England and Japan vacancies |date=2011-11-20 |first=Kevin |last=Affleck|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]}}</ref>\n\nHowever Jones went on to lead the Brumbies into the best period of their history.  In 2000, the Brumbies were runners up, losing the final to the Crusaders, but in 2001 he coached them to their first title, the first team from outside [[New Zealand]] to win the tournament. Notably, while with the Brumbies, it was Jones who was credited with discovering [[George Smith (rugby union)|George Smith]] while at a trial for a [[Rugby league]] team, the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]].\n\n===Australia===\nIn 2001, Jones coached [[Australia A national rugby union team|Australia A]] to a win over the touring British and Irish Lions.  This success led to his appointment as head coach of the [[Australian national rugby union team]], the Wallabies, after [[Rod Macqueen]] retired. Under Jones, Australia won the [[2001 Tri Nations Series|2001 Tri Nations]], and then entered their home [[2003 Rugby World Cup|World Cup in 2003]] as third favourites behind [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] and [[England national rugby union team|England]].  They managed to upset the All Blacks in the semi-final before losing to England in the final in extra time through a last-minute drop goal.\n\nAfter the World Cup, Jones was awarded a contract to lead [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] through to the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. He also had an offer to coach [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]] which he turned down.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/australia/2375649/Jones-signs-new-contract.html |title=Jones signs new contract |first=William |last=Gray |date=2004-03-27 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the Wallabies suffered a spate of injuries, losing seven games straight. At the end of their European tour they lost eight of the last nine matches, with the scrum in particular struggling. After a 22\u201324 loss to [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] at the [[Millennium Stadium]] on 2 December 2005, Jones' contract was terminated as the Wallabies head coach.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/international/4475588.stm|title=Jones sacked as Wallabies coach | publisher=BBC News | date=2 December 2005}}</ref> While the [[Australian Rugby Union]] had ordered a report into the Wallabies after the season, including a review of Jones' position as head coach, it has been speculated that the Wallabies' loss to Wales prompted his dismissal before the investigation had even begun.\n\n===Post Wallabies===\nJust over a month after Jones was relieved of his position as Wallabies head coach, he signed a three-year deal with the [[Queensland Reds]] to take over as head coach after the [[2006 Super 14 season]]. In February 2006 he joined [[Saracens F.C.|Saracens]] in a consultancy role until the end of the season to help them after they were struggling near the bottom of the league.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/english/4714260.stm|title=Jones relishing Sarries challenge | publisher=BBC News | date=14 February 2006}}</ref>\n\nJones endured a torrid season with the Reds in 2007, who finished bottom of the [[2007 Super 14 season|Super 14]] table, only managing two wins the entire season. Injury spells meant Jones at times had to do without up to eight regulars in his starting team, including the loss of influential Wallabies fullback [[Chris Latham (rugby player)|Chris Latham]] even before the season started. His last match was an away defeat to the [[Bulls (rugby union)|Bulls]] by a Super Rugby record margin of 89 points, which led to mounting calls in the media for him to be sacked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twf.com.au/showthread.php?t=7764|title=Pressure again mounting on Eddie Jones}}</ref> His stint at the Reds is by far the least successful of his coaching career and he resigned after just one season in charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-05-21/jones-parts-company-with-reds/2554452 |title=Jones parts company with Reds |date=2007-05-21 |website=[[ABC Online]]}}</ref> During his time at the Reds he was also fined $10,000 dollars for calling the performance of referee [[Matt Goddard]] \"disgraceful\" and \"lacking common sense\" after a close 6\u20133 loss to his former side the [[ACT Brumbies|Brumbies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/sport/rugby-eddie-jones-cops-a-hefty-fine-2007022305 |title=Rugby: Eddie Jones cops a hefty fine |date=2007-02-22 |work=[[Newshub]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324215818/http://www.newshub.co.nz/sport/rugby-eddie-jones-cops-a-hefty-fine-2007022305 |archive-date=2016-03-24 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===South Africa===\nLater in 2007, Jones turned down an approach from [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]] to be a technical advisor to the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] in France, and instead was appointed by Springbok coach [[Jake White]] to be the technical advisor for the [[South African national rugby union team|South African]] team at the tournament.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/6935229.stm|title=Coach Jones joins Springboks camp | publisher=BBC News | date=7 August 2007}}</ref> He was criticised by the [[Australian Rugby Union|ARU]] Chief Executive [[John O'Neill (sport administrator)|John O'Neill]] for taking up a job to try to help Australia's rivals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-07-26/oneill-slams-jones-for-helping-springboks/2514098 |title=O'Neill slams Jones for helping Springboks |date=2007-07-26 |website=[[ABC Online]]}}</ref>\n\nSouth Africa went on to win the World Cup and Jones was praised for his role in the success, with former coach [[Nick Mallett]] calling the move from White to appoint him a \"masterstroke\" and crediting Jones with improved backline play by South Africa at the tournament.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/southafrica/2322857/Eddie-Jones-gives-South-Africa-confidence.html |title=Eddie Jones gives South Africa confidence |first=Nick |last=Mallett |date=2007-10-07 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}</ref> Despite being an official part of the Springbok coaching team, Jones was not given a [[Springbok colours|Springbok blazer]] because he is not South African.

Japan lost to [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga]] in the opening round of the [[2013 IRB Pacific Nations Cup]], and were later defeated by [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]] in round 2.

In June of that year, Japan claimed a 26\u201323 victory over [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]], which was Japan's tenth consecutive win, a record for a Tier 2 team.

Following this victory, Japan rose to ninth in the World Rankings, their highest-ever position, and achieved Jones' aim of reaching the top 10 in the world.\n\nIn 2015, after securing the [[2015 Asian Rugby Championship]], Japan suffered three consecutive losses in the [[2015 World Rugby Pacific Nations Cup]]. After beating [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]] 20\u20136, they lost to the [[United States national rugby union team|United States]], Fiji and Tonga to finish fourth with just one win.

The final test confirmed the series whitewash, England winning the match 44\u201340. During the series, Jones had led England from fourth in the world to second. In the [[2016 end-of-year rugby union internationals|2016 Autumn Internationals]], he guided England through to their 14th consecutive win, 13 of these under his leadership, and they became just the second team after New Zealand to win every one of their games in a calendar year. Jones then led England to a 37\u201321 win against [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]], their first victory over ''the Springboks'' since 2006. England later saw off [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]] 58\u201315, before beating [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] 27\u201314 a week later, this despite an England player being sent off after five minutes. England finished the autumn tests with a 37\u201321 win over Australia.\n\nDuring the [[2017 Six Nations Championship]], Jones experienced his first defeat as England head coach when the team travelled to [[Dublin]] for their final game of the Championship, which they lost 9\u201313. Not only would a win have secured England's second consecutive Grand Slam but it would also have been a record 19th consecutive victory. Despite this disappointment, England were the overall winners of the Championship with wins over France (19\u201316), Wales (21\u201316), Italy (36\u201315), and Scotland (61\u201321). In June 2017, Jones took an inexperienced side for a [[2017 England rugby union tour of Argentina|two-test series in Argentina]]; the team included 18 uncapped players, eight of whom were less than 21 years old. Nevertheless, England won the series 2\u20130 with a 38\u201334 victory in the first test and a 35\u201325 victory in the second. England continued their form during the [[2017 end-of-year rugby union internationals|2017 Autumn Internationals]], winning all three of their tests: 21\u20138 against Argentina, 30\u20136 against Australia, and 48\u201314 against [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]].\n\nEngland finished the [[2018 Six Nations Championship]] in their lowest-ever position in the league table, and their worst since the [[1983 Five Nations Championship]], finishing in fifth place having only beaten Italy (46\u201315) and Wales (12\u20136). England's consecutive losses to Scotland, France and Ireland were their first triple defeat since 2014. Their loss to Scotland was the first since 2010, and their loss to Ireland was the first at home since 2010. A 45\u201363 loss against the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] followed in May of the same year, with former England international [[Chris Ashton]] scoring a hat-trick of tries against his ex-teammates. England's run of defeats continued into the [[2018 June rugby union tests|June test series]], when they lost the first two matches of their [[2018 England rugby union tour of South Africa|three-test series]] against South Africa. However, they avoided a 3\u20130 series defeat by winning the third test 25\u201310 to claim their first win in South Africa since 2000. When former ''All Blacks'' and [[United States national rugby union team|''Eagles'']] coach [[John Mitchell (rugby union)|John Mitchell]] joined the coaching team as defence coach, England achieved a return win (12\u201311) against South Africa in a tightly-contested match on 3&nbsp;November in the [[2018 end-of-year rugby union internationals|2018 Autumn Internationals]]. Another close-fought test against New Zealand a week later also finished with a single-point scoreline difference (15\u201316), but this time in favour of the opposition. England then won their remaining autumn tests against Japan (35\u201315) and Australia (37\u201318). The win against the ''Wallabies'' was England's sixth consecutive victory over the Australians, continuing their perfect record against Jones' former team during his tenure.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2018/11/24/england-vs-australia-live-score-latest-autumn-international/ |title=England pull away from Australia with second-half surge |date=2018-11-24 |first=Charlie |last=Morgan |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}</ref>\n\nEngland drew 38\u201338 with Scotland in the [[2019 Six Nations Championship]], meaning that Scotland retained the [[Calcutta Cup]]. England had led 31\u20130 just half an hour into the match but Scotland scored six unanswered tries to go 38\u201331 ahead with five minutes remaining, only for England to tie the score with a converted try in the last play of the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/47598676 |title=England and Scotland draw astonishing Test 38\u201338 in Six Nations |date=2019-03-16 |first=Mike ||last=Henson |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}</ref> Jones claimed that his team had a recurring \"mental block\" that needed fixing after a similar incident three weeks previously against Wales.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/16/eddie-jones-england-scotland-six-nations-mental-block |title=England taking their foot off the gas is a recurring theme, admits Eddie Jones |date=2019-03-16 |first=Michael |last=Aylwin |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> The 38\u201338 draw is currently the highest-scoring tied match in international rugby history.\n\nJones guided England to their first World Cup final since 2007 when they beat reigning world champions New Zealand 19\u20137 in the semi-finals of the [[2019 Rugby World Cup]].

Three years later, he led them through the [[2019 Rugby World Cup]] where they defeated defending champions [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] in the semi-finals before losing the final to Jones' former side South Africa.\n\nJones played as a [[Hooker (rugby union)|hooker]] for Sydney club [[Randwick DRUFC|Randwick]] and [[NSW Waratahs|New South Wales]] and began coaching Randwick in 1994. He continued his career in [[Japan]] between 1995 and 1997 for [[Tokai University]], as an assistant to the Japanese national side and for [[Suntory Sungoliath]]. In 1998 he returned to Australia, taking charge of [[ACT Brumbies]] in [[Super Rugby]] and also coached the [[Queensland Reds]] in the 2007 Super Rugby season. In 2008, he had a brief spell at [[Saracens F.C.|Saracens]] in England's [[Premiership Rugby]], before returning to Japan and Suntory Sungoliath for a second spell which culminated in winning the [[2011\u201312 Top League]] championship.\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe was born in [[Burnie, Tasmania]],<ref name=ESPNprofile /> to a [[Japanese Americans|Japanese American]] mother and an Australian father.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.joe.co.uk/sport/eddie-jones-japan-rugby-239236 |title=England coach Eddie Jones on how he made Japan a force in world rugby |date=October 2019 |website=[[Joe (website)|Joe]] |access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref> He is married to Hiroko Jones, a Japanese woman whom he met while teaching at the [[International Grammar School]] in [[Sydney]].<ref name=\"Telegraph20160129\">{{Cite news|url=https://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/projects/Making-Eddie-Jones/index.html |title=The Making of Eddie Jones |last=Brown |first=Oliver |date=2016-01-29 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |access-date=2019-10-28}}</ref> They have a daughter, Chelsea Jones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/opinion/106716698/departures-are-sign-that-eddie-jones-has-driven-his-staff-too-hard|title=Departures are sign that Eddie Jones has driven his staff too hard|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\nJones's playing career began at [[Matraville Sports High School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celebrityspeakers.com.au/eddie-jones/|title=Eddie Jones}}</ref> He played as a [[Hooker (rugby union)|hooker]] for [[Randwick DRUFC|Randwick]] and [[NSW Waratahs|New South Wales]].<ref name=\"Telegraph20160129\" /> Jones played against the [[British and Irish Lions]] for New South Wales B in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/match-overview.php?section=lineups&fixid=61745 |title=NEW SOUTH WALES B 19 \u2013 39 BRITISH & IRISH LIONS }}</ref>  He also made three appearances for [[Leicester Tigers|Leicester]] during the 1991/92 season in England.

Then he went to [[Japan]] where he had brief stints coaching [[Tokai University]], [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]] (as assistant coach) and [[Suntory Sungoliath]].\n\n===ACT Brumbies===\nJones returned to Australia in 1998 to coach the [[ACT Brumbies]].  Jones had a disappointing first season only finishing 10th in the Super 12 his first season in charge; he has since said he was \"way out of his depth\" in his first season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenational.ae/sport/eddie-jones-eyes-england-and-japan-vacancies-1.632141 |title=Eddie Jones eyes England and Japan vacancies |date=2011-11-20 |first=Kevin |last=Affleck|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]}}</ref>\n\nHowever Jones went on to lead the Brumbies into the best period of their history.  In 2000, the Brumbies were runners up, losing the final to the Crusaders, but in 2001 he coached them to their first title, the first team from outside [[New Zealand]] to win the tournament. Notably, while with the Brumbies, it was Jones who was credited with discovering [[George Smith (rugby union)|George Smith]] while at a trial for a [[Rugby league]] team, the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]].\n\n===Australia===\nIn 2001, Jones coached [[Australia A national rugby union team|Australia A]] to a win over the touring British and Irish Lions.  This success led to his appointment as head coach of the [[Australian national rugby union team]], the Wallabies, after [[Rod Macqueen]] retired. Under Jones, Australia won the [[2001 Tri Nations Series|2001 Tri Nations]], and then entered their home [[2003 Rugby World Cup|World Cup in 2003]] as third favourites behind [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] and [[England national rugby union team|England]].  They managed to upset the All Blacks in the semi-final before losing to England in the final in extra time through a last-minute drop goal.\n\nAfter the World Cup, Jones was awarded a contract to lead [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] through to the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. He also had an offer to coach [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]] which he turned down.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/australia/2375649/Jones-signs-new-contract.html |title=Jones signs new contract |first=William |last=Gray |date=2004-03-27 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the Wallabies suffered a spate of injuries, losing seven games straight. At the end of their European tour they lost eight of the last nine matches, with the scrum in particular struggling. After a 22\u201324 loss to [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] at the [[Millennium Stadium]] on 2 December 2005, Jones' contract was terminated as the Wallabies head coach.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/international/4475588.stm|title=Jones sacked as Wallabies coach | publisher=BBC News | date=2 December 2005}}</ref> While the [[Australian Rugby Union]] had ordered a report into the Wallabies after the season, including a review of Jones' position as head coach, it has been speculated that the Wallabies' loss to Wales prompted his dismissal before the investigation had even begun.\n\n===Post Wallabies===\nJust over a month after Jones was relieved of his position as Wallabies head coach, he signed a three-year deal with the [[Queensland Reds]] to take over as head coach after the [[2006 Super 14 season]]. In February 2006 he joined [[Saracens F.C.|Saracens]] in a consultancy role until the end of the season to help them after they were struggling near the bottom of the league.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/english/4714260.stm|title=Jones relishing Sarries challenge | publisher=BBC News | date=14 February 2006}}</ref>\n\nJones endured a torrid season with the Reds in 2007, who finished bottom of the [[2007 Super 14 season|Super 14]] table, only managing two wins the entire season. Injury spells meant Jones at times had to do without up to eight regulars in his starting team, including the loss of influential Wallabies fullback [[Chris Latham (rugby player)|Chris Latham]] even before the season started. His last match was an away defeat to the [[Bulls (rugby union)|Bulls]] by a Super Rugby record margin of 89 points, which led to mounting calls in the media for him to be sacked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twf.com.au/showthread.php?t=7764|title=Pressure again mounting on Eddie Jones}}</ref> His stint at the Reds is by far the least successful of his coaching career and he resigned after just one season in charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-05-21/jones-parts-company-with-reds/2554452 |title=Jones parts company with Reds |date=2007-05-21 |website=[[ABC Online]]}}</ref> During his time at the Reds he was also fined $10,000 dollars for calling the performance of referee [[Matt Goddard]] \"disgraceful\" and \"lacking common sense\" after a close 6\u20133 loss to his former side the [[ACT Brumbies|Brumbies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/sport/rugby-eddie-jones-cops-a-hefty-fine-2007022305 |title=Rugby: Eddie Jones cops a hefty fine |date=2007-02-22 |work=[[Newshub]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324215818/http://www.newshub.co.nz/sport/rugby-eddie-jones-cops-a-hefty-fine-2007022305 |archive-date=2016-03-24 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===South Africa===\nLater in 2007, Jones turned down an approach from [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]] to be a technical advisor to the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] in France, and instead was appointed by Springbok coach [[Jake White]] to be the technical advisor for the [[South African national rugby union team|South African]] team at the tournament.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/6935229.stm|title=Coach Jones joins Springboks camp | publisher=BBC News | date=7 August 2007}}</ref> He was criticised by the [[Australian Rugby Union|ARU]] Chief Executive [[John O'Neill (sport administrator)|John O'Neill]] for taking up a job to try to help Australia's rivals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-07-26/oneill-slams-jones-for-helping-springboks/2514098 |title=O'Neill slams Jones for helping Springboks |date=2007-07-26 |website=[[ABC Online]]}}</ref>\n\nSouth Africa went on to win the World Cup and Jones was praised for his role in the success, with former coach [[Nick Mallett]] calling the move from White to appoint him a \"masterstroke\" and crediting Jones with improved backline play by South Africa at the tournament.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/southafrica/2322857/Eddie-Jones-gives-South-Africa-confidence.html |title=Eddie Jones gives South Africa confidence |first=Nick |last=Mallett |date=2007-10-07 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}</ref> Despite being an official part of the Springbok coaching team, Jones was not given a [[Springbok colours|Springbok blazer]] because he is not South African.

Following this victory, Japan rose to ninth in the World Rankings, their highest-ever position, and achieved Jones' aim of reaching the top 10 in the world.\n\nIn 2015, after securing the [[2015 Asian Rugby Championship]], Japan suffered three consecutive losses in the [[2015 World Rugby Pacific Nations Cup]].

They opened with a 15\u20139 win over [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] before seeing out [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]] 40\u20139. In Jones' first home game on 27 February 2016, he led England to a 21\u201310 victory over [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], before they went on to beat [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] 25\u201321 two weeks later; at one point in the match they were leading the Welsh team 19\u20130, but then conceded three tries in the second half. England secured the Championship on 13 March with one game in hand when Scotland beat France, meaning that England went into the final round having already secured the title. A 31\u201321 victory over [[France national rugby union team|France]] in the final game of the Championship on 19 March saw England win their first Grand Slam since 2003.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2016/03/19/france-vs-england-six-nations-grand-slam-decider-live/ |title=France 21 England 31: Eddie Jones promises more is to come from England after Grand Slam success |first=Charlie |last=Eccleshare |date=2016-03-19 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |accessdate=2016-03-22}}</ref>\n\nThree months later, Jones took his English side on a tour of Australia for a [[2016 England rugby union tour of Australia|three-test series]] against [[Australia national rugby union team|''the Wallabies'']]; England won the series 3\u20130 in their first-ever three-test series victory. They scored their most points against Australia in the first test, winning 39\u201328, and claimed their third consecutive victory over ''the Wallabies'' on Australian soil when they won the second test 23\u20137, a record-winning streak for the game played in Australia's home territory. The final test confirmed the series whitewash, England winning the match 44\u201340. During the series, Jones had led England from fourth in the world to second. In the [[2016 end-of-year rugby union internationals|2016 Autumn Internationals]], he guided England through to their 14th consecutive win, 13 of these under his leadership, and they became just the second team after New Zealand to win every one of their games in a calendar year. Jones then led England to a 37\u201321 win against [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]], their first victory over ''the Springboks'' since 2006. England later saw off [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]] 58\u201315, before beating [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] 27\u201314 a week later, this despite an England player being sent off after five minutes. England finished the autumn tests with a 37\u201321 win over Australia.\n\nDuring the [[2017 Six Nations Championship]], Jones experienced his first defeat as England head coach when the team travelled to [[Dublin]] for their final game of the Championship, which they lost 9\u201313. Not only would a win have secured England's second consecutive Grand Slam but it would also have been a record 19th consecutive victory. Despite this disappointment, England were the overall winners of the Championship with wins over France (19\u201316), Wales (21\u201316), Italy (36\u201315), and Scotland (61\u201321). In June 2017, Jones took an inexperienced side for a [[2017 England rugby union tour of Argentina|two-test series in Argentina]]; the team included 18 uncapped players, eight of whom were less than 21 years old. Nevertheless, England won the series 2\u20130 with a 38\u201334 victory in the first test and a 35\u201325 victory in the second. England continued their form during the [[2017 end-of-year rugby union internationals|2017 Autumn Internationals]], winning all three of their tests: 21\u20138 against Argentina, 30\u20136 against Australia, and 48\u201314 against [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]].\n\nEngland finished the [[2018 Six Nations Championship]] in their lowest-ever position in the league table, and their worst since the [[1983 Five Nations Championship]], finishing in fifth place having only beaten Italy (46\u201315) and Wales (12\u20136). England's consecutive losses to Scotland, France and Ireland were their first triple defeat since 2014. Their loss to Scotland was the first since 2010, and their loss to Ireland was the first at home since 2010. A 45\u201363 loss against the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] followed in May of the same year, with former England international [[Chris Ashton]] scoring a hat-trick of tries against his ex-teammates. England's run of defeats continued into the [[2018 June rugby union tests|June test series]], when they lost the first two matches of their [[2018 England rugby union tour of South Africa|three-test series]] against South Africa. However, they avoided a 3\u20130 series defeat by winning the third test 25\u201310 to claim their first win in South Africa since 2000. When former ''All Blacks'' and [[United States national rugby union team|''Eagles'']] coach [[John Mitchell (rugby union)|John Mitchell]] joined the coaching team as defence coach, England achieved a return win (12\u201311) against South Africa in a tightly-contested match on 3&nbsp;November in the [[2018 end-of-year rugby union internationals|2018 Autumn Internationals]]. Another close-fought test against New Zealand a week later also finished with a single-point scoreline difference (15\u201316), but this time in favour of the opposition. England then won their remaining autumn tests against Japan (35\u201315) and Australia (37\u201318). The win against the ''Wallabies'' was England's sixth consecutive victory over the Australians, continuing their perfect record against Jones' former team during his tenure.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2018/11/24/england-vs-australia-live-score-latest-autumn-international/ |title=England pull away from Australia with second-half surge |date=2018-11-24 |first=Charlie |last=Morgan |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}</ref>\n\nEngland drew 38\u201338 with Scotland in the [[2019 Six Nations Championship]], meaning that Scotland retained the [[Calcutta Cup]].

pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004

In May 1810, Commander Lino de Clemente, a veteran officer of the [[Spanish Navy]] who joined the April 1810 coup against the colonial government, was appointed the first Minister of Defense of the republic and began the long building of the armed forces including the formation of the navy. In April 1811 the Nautical School, with Ensign Vicente Parrado as its first superindentent, was opened by order of the national government in [[La Guaira]] to train future naval officers, months before the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence, thus the Navy's origins start from this date, with its first vessels being those formerly used by the naval forces of the Captaincy General of Venezuela, and participated in its first actions in the campaigns in Guayana in 1811-12, the baptism of fire for the fledgling naval service. Colonel Antonio Mendoza from the Venezuelan Army was its first commanding general.\n\nFor a long time their vessels, even if obsolete, were maintained properly by its sailors. In 1937 the Navy acquired from Italy two [[gunboat]]s of the {{sclass-|Azio|minelayer|4}} and rechristened them ''General Soublette'' and ''General Urdaneta''; these ships where retained in service until 1951<ref name=\"navyworld\">{{cite web|url=http://navyworld.narod.ru/Dragamine.htm#Dardanelli|title=\u0422\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0449\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0418\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0438|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110171837/http://navyworld.narod.ru/Dragamine.htm#Dardanelli|archive-date=10 November 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (for other sources in 1948<ref name=\"museocantieristica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.archeologiaindustriale.it/sez_produzione_it.php?search_linked_media=dardanelli%7Cposamine%7C147%7Cregia%20marina%20italiana&content_type=nave&goto_id=411 |title=...:: Museo della Cantieristica ::... |accessdate=24 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224205632/http://www.archeologiaindustriale.it/sez_produzione_it.php?search_linked_media=dardanelli%7Cposamine%7C147%7Cregia%20marina%20italiana&content_type=nave&goto_id=411 |archivedate=24 December 2014 }}</ref> or 1950<ref name=\"proflot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.proflot.com/category/korabli-vov/vms-venesuely|title=\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0438, \u043b\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0438, \u044f\u0445\u0442\u044b\u2026|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213907/http://www.proflot.com/category/korabli-vov/vms-venesuely|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.battleships.ru/battlesh/ship/ship.php?id=23202 Battleships.ru] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203050730/http://www.battleships.ru/battlesh/ship/ship.php?id=23202 |date=December 3, 2013 }}</ref>) and scrapped later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warshipsww2.eu/shipsplus.php?language=E&period=&id=104900 |title=Italian Dardanelli, ARV General Soublette - Warships 1900-1950 |accessdate=24 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006191857/http://www.warshipsww2.eu/shipsplus.php?language=E&period=&id=104900 |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oceania.pbworks.com/w/page/14728663/IN%20Ostia-1926|title=oceania / IN Ostia-1926|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027000807/http://oceania.pbworks.com/w/page/14728663/IN%20Ostia-1926|archive-date=27 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Joint exercises===\n\nIn September, 2008, the [[Russian Navy|Russian Navy's]] nuclear-powered [[Russian battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy|missile cruiser ''Pyotr Velikiy'']], accompanied by three other ships of Russia's [[Northern Fleet]], sailed from its base in [[Severomorsk]] on a cruise to the [[Caribbean Sea]] for a joint exercise with the Venezuelan Navy.

In May 1810, Commander Lino de Clemente, a veteran officer of the [[Spanish Navy]] who joined the April 1810 coup against the colonial government, was appointed the first Minister of Defense of the republic and began the long building of the armed forces including the formation of the navy. In April 1811 the Nautical School, with Ensign Vicente Parrado as its first superindentent, was opened by order of the national government in [[La Guaira]] to train future naval officers, months before the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence, thus the Navy's origins start from this date, with its first vessels being those formerly used by the naval forces of the Captaincy General of Venezuela, and participated in its first actions in the campaigns in Guayana in 1811-12, the baptism of fire for the fledgling naval service. Colonel Antonio Mendoza from the Venezuelan Army was its first commanding general.\n\nFor a long time their vessels, even if obsolete, were maintained properly by its sailors. In 1937 the Navy acquired from Italy two [[gunboat]]s of the {{sclass-|Azio|minelayer|4}} and rechristened them ''General Soublette'' and ''General Urdaneta''; these ships where retained in service until 1951<ref name=\"navyworld\">{{cite web|url=http://navyworld.narod.ru/Dragamine.htm#Dardanelli|title=\u0422\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0449\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0418\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0438|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110171837/http://navyworld.narod.ru/Dragamine.htm#Dardanelli|archive-date=10 November 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (for other sources in 1948<ref name=\"museocantieristica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.archeologiaindustriale.it/sez_produzione_it.php?search_linked_media=dardanelli%7Cposamine%7C147%7Cregia%20marina%20italiana&content_type=nave&goto_id=411 |title=...:: Museo della Cantieristica ::... |accessdate=24 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224205632/http://www.archeologiaindustriale.it/sez_produzione_it.php?search_linked_media=dardanelli%7Cposamine%7C147%7Cregia%20marina%20italiana&content_type=nave&goto_id=411 |archivedate=24 December 2014 }}</ref> or 1950<ref name=\"proflot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.proflot.com/category/korabli-vov/vms-venesuely|title=\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0438, \u043b\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0438, \u044f\u0445\u0442\u044b\u2026|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213907/http://www.proflot.com/category/korabli-vov/vms-venesuely|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.battleships.ru/battlesh/ship/ship.php?id=23202 Battleships.ru] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203050730/http://www.battleships.ru/battlesh/ship/ship.php?id=23202 |date=December 3, 2013 }}</ref>) and scrapped later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warshipsww2.eu/shipsplus.php?language=E&period=&id=104900 |title=Italian Dardanelli, ARV General Soublette - Warships 1900-1950 |accessdate=24 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006191857/http://www.warshipsww2.eu/shipsplus.php?language=E&period=&id=104900 |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oceania.pbworks.com/w/page/14728663/IN%20Ostia-1926|title=oceania / IN Ostia-1926|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027000807/http://oceania.pbworks.com/w/page/14728663/IN%20Ostia-1926|archive-date=27 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Joint exercises===\n\nIn September, 2008, the [[Russian Navy|Russian Navy's]] nuclear-powered [[Russian battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy|missile cruiser ''Pyotr Velikiy'']], accompanied by three other ships of Russia's [[Northern Fleet]], sailed from its base in [[Severomorsk]] on a cruise to the [[Caribbean Sea]] for a joint exercise with the Venezuelan Navy.

The song went viral following his arrest in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], after a nationwide manhunt for murder.\n\nMcIntyre was captured by U.S. marshals on June 30, 2017, the same day \"The Race\" was released, in Elizabeth, New Jersey, after a total of three months on the run.

On March 19, 2018, his song \"Hard\", featuring [[Blocboy JB]], was released via [[hip hop]]-oriented record label [[Adam22|No Jumper]] Records. In July 2019, McIntyre was found guilty of murder for his involvement in the 2016 home invasion and robbery that left 21-year-old Ethan Walker dead, and was sentenced to 55 years in prison.

After relating the parable of the rich man who took away the one little ewe lamb of his poor neighbor ({{bibleverse|2 Samuel|12:1\u20136|KJV}}), and exciting the king's anger against the unrighteous act, the prophet applied the case directly to David's action with regard to Bathsheba. The king at once confessed his sin and expressed sincere repentance. Bathsheba's first child by David was struck with a severe illness and died, unnamed, a few days after birth, which the king accepted as his punishment. Nathan also noted that David's house would be punished for Uriah's murder.\n\nBathsheba later gave birth to David's son [[Solomon]]. In David's old age, Bathsheba, based on David's promise, secured the succession to the throne by Solomon, instead of David's elder surviving sons by his other wives, such as [[Chileab]] ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:1\u20136|HE}}), [[Adonijah]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|1:11\u201331|HE}}) and others ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:1\u20136|HE}}). David's punishment came to pass years later when one of David's much-loved sons, [[Absalom]], led an insurrection that plunged the kingdom into [[civil war]]. Moreover, to manifest his claim to be the new king, Absalom had sexual intercourse in public with ten of his father's concubines, which could be considered a direct, tenfold divine retribution for David's taking the woman of another man in secret ({{bibleverse|2 Samuel|16:20\u201323|KJV}}).\n\n==Judaism==\n=== Relationship to Ahithophel ===\nSeveral scholars see Bathsheba as the granddaughter of Ahitophel,<ref name=\"Koenig2011\">{{cite book|author=Sara M.

The assumption is then that these two Eliams are the same person.\n\nHowever in 1 Chronicles the names are very different: Bathsheba is called Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel in 1 Chronicles 3:5.

The [[Aggadah]] states that Ahithophel was misled by his knowledge of [[astrology]] into believing himself destined to become king of Israel. He therefore induced Absalom to commit an unpardonable crime ({{bibleverse|2 Sam.|16:21|KJV}}), which sooner or later would have brought with it, according to Jewish law, the penalty of death; the motive for this advice being to remove Absalom, and thus to make a way for himself to the throne. His astrological information had been, however, misunderstood by him; for in reality it only predicted that his granddaughter, Bathsheba, the daughter of his son Eliam, would become queen (Sanh. 101b, Yal\u1e32. Sam. \u00a7 150).<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/993-ahithophel \"Ahitophel\", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']</ref>\n\nThe [[Midrash]] portrays the influence of [[Satan]] bringing about the sinful relation of David and Bathsheba as follows: Bathsheba was bathing, perhaps behind a screen of wickerwork. Satan is depicted as coming in the disguise of a bird. David, shooting at the bird, strikes the screen, splitting it; thus Bathsheba is revealed in her beauty to David (Sanhedrin 107a).\n\n== Christianity ==\nIn {{bibleref2|Matthew|1:6}}, \"the wife of Uriah\" is mentioned as one of the [[ancestors of Jesus]].\n\nIn [[Typology (theology)|medieval typology]], Bathsheba is recognized as the antetype foreshadowing the role of [[Ecclesia and Synagoga|Ecclesia]], the church [[personification|personified]], as David was the antetype for Jesus.<ref>Kren, 49</ref> As a queen and mother, she was also associated with [[Mary, mother of Jesus|the Blessed Virgin Mary]] as [[Queen of Heaven]].

The passages in which Bath-sheba is mentioned are {{bibleverse|2 Samuel|11:2\u201312:24|NASB}}, and {{bibleverse|1 Kings|1:2|NASB}}\u2014both of which are parts of the oldest stratum of the books of Samuel and Kings, part of that [[court history of David]], written by someone who stood very near the events and who did not idealize David. The material contained in it is of higher historical value than that in the later strata of these books. Budde later connected it with the [[Jahwist]] document of the Hexateuch.<ref name=JE>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2659-bath-sheba Morris Jastrow, Jr., Morris et al. \"Bath-sheba\", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', 1906]</ref>\n\nThe only interpolations that concern the story of Bathsheba are some verses in the early part of the twelfth chapter, that heighten the moral tone of Nathan's rebuke of David. According to [[Karl Budde]] the interpolated portion is 12: 7, 8, and 10\u201312; according to [[Friedrich Schwally]] and H. P. Smith, the whole of 12: 1\u201315a is an interpolation, and 12:. 15b should be joined directly to 11: 27. This does not directly affect the narrative concerning Bathsheba herself. 1 Chronicles omits all reference to the way in which Bathsheba became David's wife, and gives only the names of her children in {{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|3:5|NASB}}\u2014Shimea, Shobab, [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], and Solomon.<ref name=JE/>\n\nThe father of Bathsheba was Eliam (\"Ammiel\" in {{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|3:5|NASB}}). As this was also the name of a son of Ahithophel, one of David's heroes ({{bibleverse|2 Samuel|23:34|NASB}}), perhaps Bathsheba was a granddaughter of Ahithophel and that the latter's desertion of David at the time of Absalom's rebellion was in revenge for David's conduct toward Bathsheba.<ref name=\"McKenzie2000\">{{cite book|author=Steven L.

Coogan, the faulting of David is made clear in the text from the very beginning: \"It was springtime, the time when kings go forth to war... but David remained in Jerusalem\" ({{bibleverse|2 Samuel|11:1|NASB}}); if David had been away at war, the incident would not have taken place.<ref>Coogan, Michael D., ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament'', New York: Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 210</ref>\n\nThe Bathsheba incident leads to a shift in the book's perspective; afterwards David \"is largely at the mercy of events rather than directing them\".<ref>Coogan, Michael D.

Though sometimes shown clothed at other points in her story, the most common depiction, in both medieval and later art, was ''Bathsheba at her Bath'', the formal name for the subject in art showing Bathsheba bathing, watched by King David. This could be shown with various degrees of nudity, depending on the pose and the placing of clothes or towels. One of the most common placements in the 15th century, perhaps surprisingly, was in miniatures illustrating a [[book of hours]], a personal prayer book, that overtook the [[psalter]] as the most popular devotional book for laypeople.  This was especially the case in France.<ref>Kren, 43-49</ref>\n\nIn art the subject is one of the most commonly shown in the [[Power of Women]] ''topos''. As an opportunity to feature a large female nude as the focus of a [[history painting]], the subject was popular from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. Sometimes Bathsheba's maids or the \"messengers\" sent by David are shown, and often a distant David watching from his roof. The messengers are sometimes confused with David himself, but most artists follow the Bible in keeping David at a distance in this episode.\n\nPaintings with articles include:\n\n*[[Bathsheba at Her Bath (Rembrandt)|''Bathsheba at Her Bath'' (Rembrandt)]], [[Louvre]], the most famous painting of the subject.\n*[[Bathsheba at her Bath (Veronese)|''Bathsheba at her Bath'' (Veronese)]], 1575, [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon]], [[France]].

After relating the parable of the rich man who took away the one little ewe lamb of his poor neighbor ({{bibleverse|2 Samuel|12:1\u20136|KJV}}), and exciting the king's anger against the unrighteous act, the prophet applied the case directly to David's action with regard to Bathsheba. The king at once confessed his sin and expressed sincere repentance. Bathsheba's first child by David was struck with a severe illness and died, unnamed, a few days after birth, which the king accepted as his punishment. Nathan also noted that David's house would be punished for Uriah's murder.\n\nBathsheba later gave birth to David's son [[Solomon]]. In David's old age, Bathsheba, based on David's promise, secured the succession to the throne by Solomon, instead of David's elder surviving sons by his other wives, such as [[Chileab]] ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:1\u20136|HE}}), [[Adonijah]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|1:11\u201331|HE}}) and others ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:1\u20136|HE}}). David's punishment came to pass years later when one of David's much-loved sons, [[Absalom]], led an insurrection that plunged the kingdom into [[civil war]]. Moreover, to manifest his claim to be the new king, Absalom had sexual intercourse in public with ten of his father's concubines, which could be considered a direct, tenfold divine retribution for David's taking the woman of another man in secret ({{bibleverse|2 Samuel|16:20\u201323|KJV}}).\n\n==Judaism==\n=== Relationship to Ahithophel ===\nSeveral scholars see Bathsheba as the granddaughter of Ahitophel,<ref name=\"Koenig2011\">{{cite book|author=Sara M.

The assumption is then that these two Eliams are the same person.\n\nHowever in 1 Chronicles the names are very different: Bathsheba is called Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel in 1 Chronicles 3:5.

The [[Aggadah]] states that Ahithophel was misled by his knowledge of [[astrology]] into believing himself destined to become king of Israel. He therefore induced Absalom to commit an unpardonable crime ({{bibleverse|2 Sam.|16:21|KJV}}), which sooner or later would have brought with it, according to Jewish law, the penalty of death; the motive for this advice being to remove Absalom, and thus to make a way for himself to the throne. His astrological information had been, however, misunderstood by him; for in reality it only predicted that his granddaughter, Bathsheba, the daughter of his son Eliam, would become queen (Sanh. 101b, Yal\u1e32. Sam. \u00a7 150).<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/993-ahithophel \"Ahitophel\", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']</ref>\n\nThe [[Midrash]] portrays the influence of [[Satan]] bringing about the sinful relation of David and Bathsheba as follows: Bathsheba was bathing, perhaps behind a screen of wickerwork. Satan is depicted as coming in the disguise of a bird. David, shooting at the bird, strikes the screen, splitting it; thus Bathsheba is revealed in her beauty to David (Sanhedrin 107a).\n\n== Christianity ==\nIn {{bibleref2|Matthew|1:6}}, \"the wife of Uriah\" is mentioned as one of the [[ancestors of Jesus]].\n\nIn [[Typology (theology)|medieval typology]], Bathsheba is recognized as the antetype foreshadowing the role of [[Ecclesia and Synagoga|Ecclesia]], the church [[personification|personified]], as David was the antetype for Jesus.<ref>Kren, 49</ref> As a queen and mother, she was also associated with [[Mary, mother of Jesus|the Blessed Virgin Mary]] as [[Queen of Heaven]].

While David was walking on the roof of his palace, he saw Bathsheba having a bath... so David placed her husband in the front lines of the battlefield, in order to get killed, so that he could marry Bathsheba.\" [[Ali Al-Ridha]] got upset and said: \"[[Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji'un]], you assign sluggishness in prayer to the prophet of God, and then accuse him of unchastity, and then charge him with the murder of an innocent man!\"\nHe asked \"so what is the story of Uriah?\" and Ali Al-Ridha said \"At that time, women whose husbands passed away or got killed in the war would never get married again (and this was the source of many evils). David was the first person to break this tradition. So after Uriah was incidentally killed in the war, David married his wife, but people could hardly accept this anomalous marriage (and subsequently legends were made about this marriage.)<ref>''[[Tafsir Nemooneh]]'', vol. 19, p. 257; [[Oyoun Akhbar Al-Ridha]], vol. 1, p. 154; Amali Saduq, p. 91.</ref>\n\n== Critical commentary ==\n[[File:Jan Massys - David and Bathsheba.JPG|left|thumb|''Bathsheba with David's messenger, as the king watches from his roof'', 1562 [[Jan Massys]]]]\n\nBathsheba's name appears in {{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|3:5|NASB}} spelled \"Bath-shua\", the form becomes merely a variant reading of \"Bath-sheba\". The passages in which Bath-sheba is mentioned are {{bibleverse|2 Samuel|11:2\u201312:24|NASB}}, and {{bibleverse|1 Kings|1:2|NASB}}\u2014both of which are parts of the oldest stratum of the books of Samuel and Kings, part of that [[court history of David]], written by someone who stood very near the events and who did not idealize David. The material contained in it is of higher historical value than that in the later strata of these books. Budde later connected it with the [[Jahwist]] document of the Hexateuch.<ref name=JE>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2659-bath-sheba Morris Jastrow, Jr., Morris et al. \"Bath-sheba\", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', 1906]</ref>\n\nThe only interpolations that concern the story of Bathsheba are some verses in the early part of the twelfth chapter, that heighten the moral tone of Nathan's rebuke of David. According to [[Karl Budde]] the interpolated portion is 12: 7, 8, and 10\u201312; according to [[Friedrich Schwally]] and H. P. Smith, the whole of 12: 1\u201315a is an interpolation, and 12:. 15b should be joined directly to 11: 27. This does not directly affect the narrative concerning Bathsheba herself. 1 Chronicles omits all reference to the way in which Bathsheba became David's wife, and gives only the names of her children in {{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|3:5|NASB}}\u2014Shimea, Shobab, [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], and Solomon.<ref name=JE/>\n\nThe father of Bathsheba was Eliam (\"Ammiel\" in {{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|3:5|NASB}}). As this was also the name of a son of Ahithophel, one of David's heroes ({{bibleverse|2 Samuel|23:34|NASB}}), perhaps Bathsheba was a granddaughter of Ahithophel and that the latter's desertion of David at the time of Absalom's rebellion was in revenge for David's conduct toward Bathsheba.<ref name=\"McKenzie2000\">{{cite book|author=Steven L.

Bailey]] interprets the passage from a different perspective: he says that David's Jerusalem was tightly packed and Bathsheba's house may have been as close as twenty feet away from David's rooftop; people in ancient times were exceptionally modest about their bodies, so he suggests that Bathsheba displayed herself deliberately, so that instead of being an innocent victim, it was actually she who seduced David in order to rid herself of Uriah, and move in with King David.<ref>Kenneth E.

And in {{bibleverse|2 Samuel|13|NASB}} the story of David's son [[Amnon]]'s rape of his sister [[Tamar (2 Samuel)|Tamar]], told so soon after the incident of Bathsheba, seems to draw a parallel between the sexual misconduct of father and son.<ref>Coogan, Michael D.

Though sometimes shown clothed at other points in her story, the most common depiction, in both medieval and later art, was ''Bathsheba at her Bath'', the formal name for the subject in art showing Bathsheba bathing, watched by King David. This could be shown with various degrees of nudity, depending on the pose and the placing of clothes or towels. One of the most common placements in the 15th century, perhaps surprisingly, was in miniatures illustrating a [[book of hours]], a personal prayer book, that overtook the [[psalter]] as the most popular devotional book for laypeople.  This was especially the case in France.<ref>Kren, 43-49</ref>\n\nIn art the subject is one of the most commonly shown in the [[Power of Women]] ''topos''. As an opportunity to feature a large female nude as the focus of a [[history painting]], the subject was popular from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. Sometimes Bathsheba's maids or the \"messengers\" sent by David are shown, and often a distant David watching from his roof. The messengers are sometimes confused with David himself, but most artists follow the Bible in keeping David at a distance in this episode.\n\nPaintings with articles include:\n\n*[[Bathsheba at Her Bath (Rembrandt)|''Bathsheba at Her Bath'' (Rembrandt)]], [[Louvre]], the most famous painting of the subject.\n*[[Bathsheba at her Bath (Veronese)|''Bathsheba at her Bath'' (Veronese)]], 1575, [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon]], [[France]].

Nevertheless, two major phylogeographic groupings were discovered in dholes of the Asian mainland, which likely diverged during a [[Glacial period|glaciation event]]. One population extends from South, Central and North India (south of the Ganges) into Burma, and the other extends from India north of the Ganges into northeastern India, Burma, Thailand and the Malaysian Peninsula. The origin of dholes in Sumatra and Java is, {{as of|2005|lc=y}}, unclear, as they show greater relatedness to dholes in India, Burma and China rather than with those in nearby Malaysia. In the absence of further data, the researchers involved in the study speculated that Javan and Sumatran dholes could have been introduced to the islands by humans.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Iyengar, A. |author2=Babu, V.

Friendly or submissive greetings are accompanied by horizontal lip retraction and the lowering of the tail, as well as licking. Playful dholes open their mouths with their lips retracted and their tails held in a vertical position whilst assuming a play bow. Aggressive or threatening dholes pucker their lips forward in a snarl and raise the hairs on their backs, as well as keep their tails horizontal or vertical.

Dens are typically located under dense scrub or on the banks of dry rivers or creeks. The entrance to a dhole den can be almost vertical, with a sharp turn three to four feet down. The tunnel opens into an antechamber, from which extends more than one passage. Some dens may have up to six entrances leading up to {{convert|100|ft}} of interconnecting tunnels. These \"cities\" may be developed over many generations of dholes, and are shared by the clan females when raising young together.<ref name=\"f43\">{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|pp=43\u201349}}</ref> Like [[African wild dog]]s and [[dingo]]es, dholes will avoid killing prey close to their dens.<ref name=\"f80\"/>\n\n===Reproduction and development===\n[[File:Cuon alpinus alpinus puppy.jpg|thumb|Dhole pup, [[Kolm\u00e5rden Wildlife Park]]]]\nIn India, the [[mating season]] occurs between mid-October and January, while captive dholes in the [[Moscow Zoo]] breed mostly in February.<ref name=\"cohen1978\"/> Unlike wolf packs, dhole clans may contain more than one breeding female.<ref name=\"f86\"/> More than one female dhole may den and rear their litters together in the same den.<ref name=\"nowak1983\"/> During [[mating]], the female assumes a crouched, cat-like position.

Competition between these species is mostly avoided through differences in prey selection, although there is still substantial dietary overlap. Along with leopards, dholes typically target animals in the 30\u2013175&nbsp;kg range (mean weights of 35.3&nbsp;kg for dhole and 23.4&nbsp;kg for leopard), while tigers selected for prey animals heavier than 176&nbsp;kg (but their mean prey weight was 65.5&nbsp;kg). Also, other characteristics of the prey, such as sex, arboreality and aggressiveness, may play a role in prey selection. For example, dholes preferentially select male chital, whereas leopards kill both sexes more evenly (and tigers prefer larger prey altogether), dholes and tigers kill langurs rarely compared to leopards due to the leopards' greater arboreality, while leopards kill wild boar infrequently due to the inability of this relatively light predator to tackle aggressive prey of comparable weight.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{cite journal |author1=Karanth, K.

The winter fur was prized by the Chinese, who bought dhole pelts in [[Ussuriysk]] during the late 1860s for a few silver [[ruble]]s. In the early 20th century, dhole pelts reached eight rubles in [[Manchuria]]. In [[Semirechye]], [[fur coat]]s made from dhole skin were considered the warmest, but were very costly.<ref name=\"heptner1998\"/>\n\n== Conservation ==\nIn India, the dhole is protected under Schedule 2 of the [[Wildlife Protection Act, 1972]]. The creation of reserves under [[Project Tiger]] provided some protection for dhole populations sympatric with [[Bengal tiger|tiger]]s.

They are described as living in packs numbering hundreds of individuals, and that even [[Shere Khan]] and [[Hathi]] make way for them when they descend into the jungle. The dholes are despised by the wolves because of their destructiveness, their habit of not living in dens and the hair between their toes. With Mowgli and [[Kaa]]'s help, the Seeonee wolf pack manages to wipe out the dholes by leading them through bee hives and torrential waters before finishing off the rest in battle.\n\nJapanese author Uchida Roan wrote \u72ac\u7269\u8a9e (''Inu monogatari''; A dog's tale) in 1901 as a [[Japanese nationalism|nationalistic]] critique of the declining popularity of indigenous dog breeds, which he asserted were descended from the dhole.<ref>Skabelund, A.

Today, their ranges are remote from each other; however, during the [[Pleistocene]] era the dhole could be found as far west as Europe.

Nevertheless, two major phylogeographic groupings were discovered in dholes of the Asian mainland, which likely diverged during a [[Glacial period|glaciation event]]. One population extends from South, Central and North India (south of the Ganges) into Burma, and the other extends from India north of the Ganges into northeastern India, Burma, Thailand and the Malaysian Peninsula. The origin of dholes in Sumatra and Java is, {{as of|2005|lc=y}}, unclear, as they show greater relatedness to dholes in India, Burma and China rather than with those in nearby Malaysia.

In this manner, they closely resemble African wild dogs in social structure.<ref name=\"f85\">{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=85}}</ref> They live in [[clan]]s rather than [[pack (canine)|pack]]s, as the latter term refers to a group of animals that always hunt together.

Dens are typically located under dense scrub or on the banks of dry rivers or creeks. The entrance to a dhole den can be almost vertical, with a sharp turn three to four feet down. The tunnel opens into an antechamber, from which extends more than one passage. Some dens may have up to six entrances leading up to {{convert|100|ft}} of interconnecting tunnels.

Once [[weaning]] begins, the adults of the clan will regurgitate food for the pups until they are old enough to join in hunting. They remain at the den site for 70\u201380 days.

Competition between these species is mostly avoided through differences in prey selection, although there is still substantial dietary overlap. Along with leopards, dholes typically target animals in the 30\u2013175&nbsp;kg range (mean weights of 35.3&nbsp;kg for dhole and 23.4&nbsp;kg for leopard), while tigers selected for prey animals heavier than 176&nbsp;kg (but their mean prey weight was 65.5&nbsp;kg). Also, other characteristics of the prey, such as sex, arboreality and aggressiveness, may play a role in prey selection. For example, dholes preferentially select male chital, whereas leopards kill both sexes more evenly (and tigers prefer larger prey altogether), dholes and tigers kill langurs rarely compared to leopards due to the leopards' greater arboreality, while leopards kill wild boar infrequently due to the inability of this relatively light predator to tackle aggressive prey of comparable weight.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{cite journal |author1=Karanth, K.

Certain people, such as the [[Kuruba|Kurumbas]] and some [[Mon Khmer]]-speaking tribes will appropriate dhole kills; some Indian villagers welcome the dhole because of this appropriation of dhole kills.<ref name=\"nowak1983\"/> Dholes were persecuted throughout India for bounties until they were given protection by the [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]]. Methods used for dhole hunting included poisoning, snaring, shooting and clubbing at den sites.

Persecution of dholes still occurs with varying degrees of intensity according to the region.<ref name=\"durbin2004\"/> Bounties paid for dholes used to be 25 [[rupee]]s, though this was reduced to 20 in 1926 after the number of presented dhole carcasses became too numerous to maintain the established reward.<ref name=\"f109\">{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=109}}</ref> In Indochina, dholes suffer heavily from nonselective hunting techniques such as snaring.<ref name=\"durbin2004\"/>\n\nThe [[fur trade]] does not pose a significant threat to dholes.<ref name=\"durbin2004\"/> The people of India do not eat dhole flesh and their fur is not considered overly valuable.<ref name=\"mivart1890\"/> Due to their rarity, dholes were never harvested for their skins in large numbers in the [[Soviet Union]] and were sometimes accepted as dog or wolf pelts (being labeled as \"half wolf\" for the latter). The winter fur was prized by the Chinese, who bought dhole pelts in [[Ussuriysk]] during the late 1860s for a few silver [[ruble]]s. In the early 20th century, dhole pelts reached eight rubles in [[Manchuria]]. In [[Semirechye]], [[fur coat]]s made from dhole skin were considered the warmest, but were very costly.<ref name=\"heptner1998\"/>\n\n== Conservation ==\nIn India, the dhole is protected under Schedule 2 of the [[Wildlife Protection Act, 1972]]. The creation of reserves under [[Project Tiger]] provided some protection for dhole populations sympatric with [[Bengal tiger|tiger]]s.

This fear and superstition was not, however, shared by neighbouring [[Tungusic peoples]].\n\nVon Schrenk speculated that this differing attitude towards dholes was due to the Tungusic people's more nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle.<ref name=\"schrenk1859\">{{in lang|de}} [[Leopold von Schrenck|Schrenk, L. v.]] (1859), [https://archive.org/stream/reisenundforschu0112schr#page/48/mode/2up ''Reisen und forschungen im Amur-lande in den jahren 1854\u20131856''], St. Petersburg : K.

The Montefalcone family's [[coat of arms]] had a pair of red dogs as supporters.<ref name=\"smith1839\"/>\n\nDholes appear in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Red Dog (Kipling short story)|Red Dog]]'', where they are portrayed as aggressive and bloodthirsty animals which descend from the [[Deccan Plateau]] into the [[Seoni, Madhya Pradesh|Seeonee Hills]] inhabited by [[Mowgli]] and his adopted wolf pack to cause carnage among the jungle's denizens. They are described as living in packs numbering hundreds of individuals, and that even [[Shere Khan]] and [[Hathi]] make way for them when they descend into the jungle. The dholes are despised by the wolves because of their destructiveness, their habit of not living in dens and the hair between their toes. With Mowgli and [[Kaa]]'s help, the Seeonee wolf pack manages to wipe out the dholes by leading them through bee hives and torrential waters before finishing off the rest in battle.\n\nJapanese author Uchida Roan wrote \u72ac\u7269\u8a9e (''Inu monogatari''; A dog's tale) in 1901 as a [[Japanese nationalism|nationalistic]] critique of the declining popularity of indigenous dog breeds, which he asserted were descended from the dhole.<ref>Skabelund, A.

They can be found hunting the player and other [[non-player character|NPCs]] across the map, but are easily killed, being one of the weakest enemies in the game. They once again appear in the video game ''[[Far Cry Primal]]'', where they play similar roles as their counterparts in the previous game, but can now also be tamed and used in combat by Takkar, the main protagonist of the game.\n\n===Tameability===\n[[Brian Houghton Hodgson]] kept captured dholes in captivity, and found, with the exception of one animal, they remained shy and vicious even after 10 months.<ref name=\"mivart1890\"/> According to [[Richard Lydekker]], adult dholes are nearly impossible to tame, though pups are docile and can even be allowed to play with domestic dog pups until they reach early adulthood.<ref name=\"lydekker1907\"/> A dhole may have been presented as a gift to [[Ibbi-Sin]] as tribute.<ref>McIntosh, J.
