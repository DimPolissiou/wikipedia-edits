Thus, regional transition was not as dramatic as in other European regions. Crucial changes that define the earliest emergence of [[Homo sapiens sapiens]] are presented at Bacho Kiro at 44,000 BC. The [[Bulgaria]]n key [[Palaeolithic]] caves named [[Bacho Kiro cave|Bacho Kiro]] and [[Temnata Dupka]] with early [[Upper Palaeolithic]] material correlate that the transition was gradual.}}\n\nThe [[Palaeolithic]] period, literally the \u201c[[Old Stone Age]]\u201d, is an ancient cultural level of human development characterized by the use of unpolished chipped stone tools. The transition from Middle to Upper Palaeolithic is directly related to the development of behavioural modernity by hominids around 40,000 years BP. To denote the great significance and degree of change, this dramatic shift from Middle to Upper Palaeolithic is sometimes called the [[Upper Palaeolithic Revolution]].\n\nIn the late [[Pleistocene]], various components of the transition\u2013material culture and environmental features (climate, flora, and fauna) indicate continual change, differing from contemporary points in other parts of Europe. The aforementioned aspects leave some doubt that the term [[Upper Palaeolithic Revolution]] is appropriate to the [[Balkans]].\n\nIn general, continual evolutionary changes are the first crucial characteristic of the transition to the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] in the region. The notion of the [[Upper Palaeolithic Revolution]] that has been developed for core European regions is not applicable to the region. What is the reason? This particularly significant moment and its origins are defined and enlightened by other characteristics of the transition to upper [[Old Stone Age]]. The environment, climate, flora and fauna corroborate the implications.\n\n[[File:Grattoir \u00e0 museau plat sur lame LARTET.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aurignacian double edged [[Scraper (archaeology)|scraper]] on [[Blade (archaeology)|blade]] - 3 views of the same object.]]\nDuring the last interglacial period and the most recent [[glaciation]] of the [[Pleistocene]] (from 131,000 till 12,000 BP), Europe was very different from the regional glaciation. The glaciations did not affect [[southeastern Europe]] to the extent that they did in the northern and central regions. The evidence of forest and steppe indicate the influence was not so drastic; some species of flora and fauna survived only in this part of Europe. The region today still abounds in species endemic only to this part of Europe.\n\nThe notion of gradual transition (or evolution) best defines southeastern Europe from about 50,000 BP. In this sense, the material culture and natural environment of the region of the late [[Pleistocene]] and the early [[Holocene]] were distinct from other parts of Europe. [[Douglass W. Bailey]] writes in ''Balkan Prehistory: Exclusion, Incorporation and Identity'': \u201cLess dramatic changes to climate, flora and fauna resulted in less dramatic adaptive, or reactive, developments in material culture.\u201d\n\nThus, in speaking about [[southeastern Europe]], many classic conceptions and systematizations of human development during the Palaeolithic (and then by implication the [[Mesolithic]]) should not be considered correct in all cases. In this regard, the absence of [[Upper Palaeolithic]] cave art in the region does not seem to be surprising. Civilisations develop new and distinctive characteristics as they respond to new challenges in their environment.\n\n===Upper Palaeolithic===\n;(50,000 \u2013 20,000 [[Before Present|BP]])\n{{Main|Pe\u0219tera cu Oase|Pe\u0219tera Muierilor}}\n\n[[File:Cro-Magnon-male-skull.png|thumb|Male [[Cro-Magnon]] skull]]\nIn 2002, some of the oldest modern human ([[Homo sapiens sapiens]]) remains in Europe were discovered in the \"Cave With Bones\" (''[[Pe\u0219tera cu Oase]]''), near [[Anina]], [[Romania]].<ref>Trinkaus, E., Milota, \u015e., Rodrigo, R., Gherase, M., Moldovan, O.

Bailey {{ISBN|0-415-21597-8}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|It is equally important to recognize that the Balkan upper [[Palaeolithic]] was a long period containing little significant internal change. The [[Mesolithic]] may not have existed in the Balkans for the same reasons that cave art and [[mobiliary art]] never appeared: the changes in climate and flora and fauna were gradual and not drastic. (\u2026) Furthermore, one of the reasons that we do not distinguish separate industries in the Balkans as [[Mesolithic]] is because the lithic industries of the early [[Holocene]] were very firmly of a gradually developing late [[Palaeolithic]] tradition}}\n\nThe [[Mesolithic]] is the transitional period between the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] [[hunter-gathering]] existence and the development of farming and pottery production during the Postglacial Neolithic. The duration of the classical [[Palaeolithic]], which lasted until about 10,000 years ago, is applicable to the Balkans. It ended with the [[Mesolithic]] (duration is two to four millennia) or, where an early Neolithisation was peculiar to, with the [[Epipalaeolithic]].\n\nIn regions with limited glacial impact (e.g. the Balkans), the term [[Epipalaeolithic]] is preferable. Regions that experienced less environmental impact  during the last ice age have a much less apparent and straightforward change, and occasionally are marked by an absence of sites from the [[Mesolithic]] era. See the above [[Douglass W. Bailey]] quote.\n\nThere is lithic evidence of the [[Iron Gates mesolithic]] culture, which is notable for its early urbanization, at [[Lepenski Vir]]. Iron Gates mesolithic sites are found in modern  [[Serbia]], south-west [[Romania]] and [[Montenegro]]. At [[Ostrovul Banului]], the [[Cuina Turcului]] rock shelter in the Danube gorges and in the nearby caves of Climente, there are finds that people of that time made relatively advanced bone and lithic tools (i.e. end-scrapers, blade lets, and flakes).\n\nThe single site with materials related to the Mesolithic era in Bulgaria is Pob\u00edti K\u00e1m\u01ceni. There has been no other lithic evidence of this period found in Bulgaria. There is a 4,000-year gap between the latest Upper Palaeolithic material (13,600 BP at T\u00e9mnata Dupka) and the earliest Neolithic evidence presented at G\u01cel\u01cebnik (the beginning of the 7th millennium BC).\n\nAt Odmut in Montenegro there is evidence of human activity in the Mesolithic period. The research on the period has been supplemented with Greek [[Mesolithic]] finds, well represented by sites such as [[Frachthi]] Cave. Other sites are [[Theopetra]] Cave and [[Sesklo]] in Thessaly that represent the Middle and [[Upper Palaeolithic]] as well as the early [[Neolithic]] period. Yet southern and coastal sites in [[Greece]], which contained materials from the [[Mesolithic]], are less known.\n\nActivities began to be concentrated around individual sites where people displayed personal and group identities using various decorations: wearing ornaments and painting their bodies with ochre and hematite. As regards personal identity [[D. Bailey]] writes, \u201cFlint-cutting tools as well as time and effort needed to produce such tools testify to the expressions of identity and more flexible combinations of materials, which began to be used in the late [[Upper Palaeolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]].\u201d\n\nThe aforementioned allows us to speculate whether or not there was a period which could be described as [[Mesolithic]] in southeastern Europe, rather than an extended [[Upper Palaeolithic]]. On the other hand, lack of research in a number of regions, and the fact that many of the sites were close to seashores (It is evident that the current sea level is 100 m higher, and a number of sites were covered by water.) means that the [[Mesolithic]] Balkans could be referred to as the [[Epipalaeolithic]] Balkans, which might describe better its gradual changes and poorly defined development.\n\nThe relative climatic stability in the Balkans, compared to northern and western Europe, enabled continuous settlement in the Balkans. The Balkans therefore may have effectively functioned as an ice-age refuge from which much of Europe, especially eastern Europe, was re-populated.\n\n==Neolithic==\n{{See also|Neolithic Europe|Neolithic Transylvania|Chalcolithic Europe}}\n\nThe Balkans were the site of major Neolithic cultures, including [[Butmir culture|Butmir]], [[Vin\u010da]], [[Varna culture|Varna]], [[Karanovo culture|Karanovo]], and [[Hamangia culture|Hamangia]].\n\n[[File:\u601d\u60f3\u8005\u5851\u50cf.JPG|alt=|thumb|''The Thinker of [[Baia, Tulcea|Hamangia]]'', Neolithic [[Hamangia culture]] (c. 5250-4550 BC)]]\n[[File:Grave offerings.jpg|thumb|Artefacts from the [[Varna necropolis]], [[Bulgaria]]]]\n[[File:Burial with gold treasure, 4600-4200 BC, AM Varna, Varm25.jpg|thumb|Elite burial at the [[Varna necropolis]], original find photo (detail)]]\n\nThe [[Vin\u010da culture]] was an early culture of the Balkans (between the [[6th millennium BC|6th]] and the 3rd millennium BC), stretching around the course of the [[Danube]] in [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], northern parts of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Montenegro]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], and the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], although traces of it can be found all around the [[Balkans]], parts of [[Central Europe]] and in [[Asia Minor]].\n\nThe [[Varna Necropolis]], [[Bulgaria]], is a burial site in the western industrial zone of [[Varna]] (approximately 4&nbsp;km from the city centre), internationally considered one of the key archaeological sites in world prehistory.

The [[Illyrian tribes]] were situated in the area corresponding to today's former Yugoslavia and Albania. The name ''Illyrii'' was originally used to refer to a people occupying an area centred on Lake Skadar, situated between Albania and Montenegro (see [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria]]). \nThe term ''Illyria'' was subsequently used by the Greeks and Romans as a generic name to refer to different peoples within a well defined but much greater area.<ref>The Illyrians.

Bailey {{ISBN|0-415-21597-8}}</ref>\n{{cquote|it is important to recognize that the Balkan [[Upper Palaeolithic]] was a long period containing little significant internal change. Thus, regional transition was not as dramatic as in other European regions. Crucial changes that define the earliest emergence of [[Homo sapiens sapiens]] are presented at Bacho Kiro at 44,000 BC. The [[Bulgaria]]n key [[Palaeolithic]] caves named [[Bacho Kiro cave|Bacho Kiro]] and [[Temnata Dupka]] with early [[Upper Palaeolithic]] material correlate that the transition was gradual.}}\n\nThe [[Palaeolithic]] period, literally the \u201c[[Old Stone Age]]\u201d, is an ancient cultural level of human development characterized by the use of unpolished chipped stone tools. The transition from Middle to Upper Palaeolithic is directly related to the development of behavioural modernity by hominids around 40,000 years BP. To denote the great significance and degree of change, this dramatic shift from Middle to Upper Palaeolithic is sometimes called the [[Upper Palaeolithic Revolution]].\n\nIn the late [[Pleistocene]], various components of the transition\u2013material culture and environmental features (climate, flora, and fauna) indicate continual change, differing from contemporary points in other parts of Europe. The aforementioned aspects leave some doubt that the term [[Upper Palaeolithic Revolution]] is appropriate to the [[Balkans]].\n\nIn general, continual evolutionary changes are the first crucial characteristic of the transition to the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] in the region. The notion of the [[Upper Palaeolithic Revolution]] that has been developed for core European regions is not applicable to the region. What is the reason? This particularly significant moment and its origins are defined and enlightened by other characteristics of the transition to upper [[Old Stone Age]]. The environment, climate, flora and fauna corroborate the implications.\n\n[[File:Grattoir \u00e0 museau plat sur lame LARTET.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aurignacian double edged [[Scraper (archaeology)|scraper]] on [[Blade (archaeology)|blade]] - 3 views of the same object.]]\nDuring the last interglacial period and the most recent [[glaciation]] of the [[Pleistocene]] (from 131,000 till 12,000 BP), Europe was very different from the regional glaciation. The glaciations did not affect [[southeastern Europe]] to the extent that they did in the northern and central regions. The evidence of forest and steppe indicate the influence was not so drastic; some species of flora and fauna survived only in this part of Europe. The region today still abounds in species endemic only to this part of Europe.\n\nThe notion of gradual transition (or evolution) best defines southeastern Europe from about 50,000 BP. In this sense, the material culture and natural environment of the region of the late [[Pleistocene]] and the early [[Holocene]] were distinct from other parts of Europe. [[Douglass W. Bailey]] writes in ''Balkan Prehistory: Exclusion, Incorporation and Identity'': \u201cLess dramatic changes to climate, flora and fauna resulted in less dramatic adaptive, or reactive, developments in material culture.\u201d\n\nThus, in speaking about [[southeastern Europe]], many classic conceptions and systematizations of human development during the Palaeolithic (and then by implication the [[Mesolithic]]) should not be considered correct in all cases. In this regard, the absence of [[Upper Palaeolithic]] cave art in the region does not seem to be surprising. Civilisations develop new and distinctive characteristics as they respond to new challenges in their environment.\n\n===Upper Palaeolithic===\n;(50,000 \u2013 20,000 [[Before Present|BP]])\n{{Main|Pe\u0219tera cu Oase|Pe\u0219tera Muierilor}}\n\n[[File:Cro-Magnon-male-skull.png|thumb|Male [[Cro-Magnon]] skull]]\nIn 2002, some of the oldest modern human ([[Homo sapiens sapiens]]) remains in Europe were discovered in the \"Cave With Bones\" (''[[Pe\u0219tera cu Oase]]''), near [[Anina]], [[Romania]].<ref>Trinkaus, E., Milota, \u015e., Rodrigo, R., Gherase, M., Moldovan, O.

Bailey {{ISBN|0-415-21597-8}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|It is equally important to recognize that the Balkan upper [[Palaeolithic]] was a long period containing little significant internal change. The [[Mesolithic]] may not have existed in the Balkans for the same reasons that cave art and [[mobiliary art]] never appeared: the changes in climate and flora and fauna were gradual and not drastic. (\u2026) Furthermore, one of the reasons that we do not distinguish separate industries in the Balkans as [[Mesolithic]] is because the lithic industries of the early [[Holocene]] were very firmly of a gradually developing late [[Palaeolithic]] tradition}}\n\nThe [[Mesolithic]] is the transitional period between the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] [[hunter-gathering]] existence and the development of farming and pottery production during the Postglacial Neolithic. The duration of the classical [[Palaeolithic]], which lasted until about 10,000 years ago, is applicable to the Balkans. It ended with the [[Mesolithic]] (duration is two to four millennia) or, where an early Neolithisation was peculiar to, with the [[Epipalaeolithic]].\n\nIn regions with limited glacial impact (e.g. the Balkans), the term [[Epipalaeolithic]] is preferable. Regions that experienced less environmental impact  during the last ice age have a much less apparent and straightforward change, and occasionally are marked by an absence of sites from the [[Mesolithic]] era. See the above [[Douglass W. Bailey]] quote.\n\nThere is lithic evidence of the [[Iron Gates mesolithic]] culture, which is notable for its early urbanization, at [[Lepenski Vir]]. Iron Gates mesolithic sites are found in modern  [[Serbia]], south-west [[Romania]] and [[Montenegro]]. At [[Ostrovul Banului]], the [[Cuina Turcului]] rock shelter in the Danube gorges and in the nearby caves of Climente, there are finds that people of that time made relatively advanced bone and lithic tools (i.e. end-scrapers, blade lets, and flakes).\n\nThe single site with materials related to the Mesolithic era in Bulgaria is Pob\u00edti K\u00e1m\u01ceni. There has been no other lithic evidence of this period found in Bulgaria. There is a 4,000-year gap between the latest Upper Palaeolithic material (13,600 BP at T\u00e9mnata Dupka) and the earliest Neolithic evidence presented at G\u01cel\u01cebnik (the beginning of the 7th millennium BC).\n\nAt Odmut in Montenegro there is evidence of human activity in the Mesolithic period. The research on the period has been supplemented with Greek [[Mesolithic]] finds, well represented by sites such as [[Frachthi]] Cave. Other sites are [[Theopetra]] Cave and [[Sesklo]] in Thessaly that represent the Middle and [[Upper Palaeolithic]] as well as the early [[Neolithic]] period. Yet southern and coastal sites in [[Greece]], which contained materials from the [[Mesolithic]], are less known.\n\nActivities began to be concentrated around individual sites where people displayed personal and group identities using various decorations: wearing ornaments and painting their bodies with ochre and hematite. As regards personal identity [[D. Bailey]] writes, \u201cFlint-cutting tools as well as time and effort needed to produce such tools testify to the expressions of identity and more flexible combinations of materials, which began to be used in the late [[Upper Palaeolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]].\u201d\n\nThe aforementioned allows us to speculate whether or not there was a period which could be described as [[Mesolithic]] in southeastern Europe, rather than an extended [[Upper Palaeolithic]]. On the other hand, lack of research in a number of regions, and the fact that many of the sites were close to seashores (It is evident that the current sea level is 100 m higher, and a number of sites were covered by water.) means that the [[Mesolithic]] Balkans could be referred to as the [[Epipalaeolithic]] Balkans, which might describe better its gradual changes and poorly defined development.\n\nThe relative climatic stability in the Balkans, compared to northern and western Europe, enabled continuous settlement in the Balkans. The Balkans therefore may have effectively functioned as an ice-age refuge from which much of Europe, especially eastern Europe, was re-populated.\n\n==Neolithic==\n{{See also|Neolithic Europe|Neolithic Transylvania|Chalcolithic Europe}}\n\nThe Balkans were the site of major Neolithic cultures, including [[Butmir culture|Butmir]], [[Vin\u010da]], [[Varna culture|Varna]], [[Karanovo culture|Karanovo]], and [[Hamangia culture|Hamangia]].\n\n[[File:\u601d\u60f3\u8005\u5851\u50cf.JPG|alt=|thumb|''The Thinker of [[Baia, Tulcea|Hamangia]]'', Neolithic [[Hamangia culture]] (c. 5250-4550 BC)]]\n[[File:Grave offerings.jpg|thumb|Artefacts from the [[Varna necropolis]], [[Bulgaria]]]]\n[[File:Burial with gold treasure, 4600-4200 BC, AM Varna, Varm25.jpg|thumb|Elite burial at the [[Varna necropolis]], original find photo (detail)]]\n\nThe [[Vin\u010da culture]] was an early culture of the Balkans (between the [[6th millennium BC|6th]] and the 3rd millennium BC), stretching around the course of the [[Danube]] in [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], northern parts of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Montenegro]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], and the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], although traces of it can be found all around the [[Balkans]], parts of [[Central Europe]] and in [[Asia Minor]].\n\nThe [[Varna Necropolis]], [[Bulgaria]], is a burial site in the western industrial zone of [[Varna]] (approximately 4&nbsp;km from the city centre), internationally considered one of the key archaeological sites in world prehistory.

The [[Illyrian tribes]] were situated in the area corresponding to today's former Yugoslavia and Albania. The name ''Illyrii'' was originally used to refer to a people occupying an area centred on Lake Skadar, situated between Albania and Montenegro (see [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria]]). \nThe term ''Illyria'' was subsequently used by the Greeks and Romans as a generic name to refer to different peoples within a well defined but much greater area.<ref>The Illyrians.

Du Pon led his teams during the [[Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]], the [[Sailing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and the [[Sailing at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]] in [[Busan|Pusan]].\n\nAfter sailing the [[Finn (dinghy)|Finn]] Du Pon was also one of the first [[Soling]] sailors of the Netherlands. He owned the Soling H 4.\n\n==Controversy==\nDuring the selection for the [[Dutch Olympic Sailing Team]] for the [[Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] a controversy emerged between twelve sailors and the [[Koninklijk Nederlands Watersport Verbond|selection committee]] chaired by [[Andre de Pon|Du Pon]]. This discussion focussed on the role of [[Frieda Vollebergt]] who did the communication for the sailing team. As mother of [[Erik Vollebregt]], [[Sjoerd Vollebregt]] and [[Peter Vollebregt]] - All three candidates for the 1976 Olympic sailing event - she was accused of having a [[bias]] towards her children in the communication. In the end [[Fred Imhoff]] and [[Heike Blok]] lost the [[lawsuit]] and were removed from the 1976 selection.\n\n==Political career==\nDu Pon was in the period 1990 - 1998 and from 2002 - 2006 [[alderman]] for the liberal party [[VVD]] in [[Medemblik]]. During those periods he held several times the position of [[deputy mayor]].\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite web \n|url        = https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/alt.dolfy.forever/LnqjzIsT6HE\n|title

in [[Amsterdam]] \u2013 24 May 2006, in [[Medemblik]]) was a [[sailor]] from the [[Netherlands]], who was three times chef d'\u00e9quipe for the Dutch Olympic Sailing team. Du Pon led his teams during the [[Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]], the [[Sailing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and the [[Sailing at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]] in [[Busan|Pusan]].\n\nAfter sailing the [[Finn (dinghy)|Finn]] Du Pon was also one of the first [[Soling]] sailors of the Netherlands. He owned the Soling H 4.\n\n==Controversy==\nDuring the selection for the [[Dutch Olympic Sailing Team]] for the [[Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] a controversy emerged between twelve sailors and the [[Koninklijk Nederlands Watersport Verbond|selection committee]] chaired by [[Andre de Pon|Du Pon]]. This discussion focussed on the role of [[Frieda Vollebergt]] who did the communication for the sailing team. As mother of [[Erik Vollebregt]], [[Sjoerd Vollebregt]] and [[Peter Vollebregt]] - All three candidates for the 1976 Olympic sailing event - she was accused of having a [[bias]] towards her children in the communication. In the end [[Fred Imhoff]] and [[Heike Blok]] lost the [[lawsuit]] and were removed from the 1976 selection.\n\n==Political career==\nDu Pon was in the period 1990 - 1998 and from 2002 - 2006 [[alderman]] for the liberal party [[VVD]] in [[Medemblik]]. During those periods he held several times the position of [[deputy mayor]].\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite web \n|url        = https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/alt.dolfy.forever/LnqjzIsT6HE\n|title

Later, it was included in the [[Dacian Kingdom]] formed by the King [[Burebista]] when the mining exploration began, as the area is rich in [[gold]] and [[silver]].\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n{{See also|Transylvania in the Middle Ages|Romania in the Middle Ages}}\nBaia Mare is first mentioned in written documents released by [[Charles I of Hungary]] in 1328 under the name of ''Rivulus Dominarum'' ({{lang-en|Ladies' River}}). In 1347 the town was identified in documents by [[Louis I of Hungary]] as an important [[medieval]] town with a prosperous [[mining industry]].  Its rules of organisation were characteristic of the \"free towns\" of that time.  In 1411 the town and its surrounding areas, including the mines, were transferred into the property of the [[Hunyadi family]] by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], King of Hungary (later also Holy Roman Emperor), who recognised [[John Hunyadi|Janos Hunyadi]]'s contribution to stop the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] invasion of Europe.\n\nThe town entered into a period of prosperity, during which the [[Stephen I of Hungary|St. Stephen]] [[Cathedral]] was built. Today the cathedral tower is one of the best-known of the town's historic landmarks (see [[Stephen's Tower (Baia Mare)|Stephen's Tower]]).  The first [[school]], named ''Schola Rivulina'', was opened in Baia Mare in 1547 by the [[Reformed Church]] following the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\n=== Modern period ===\n{{See also|Modern history of Transylvania|Modern history of Romania}}\n\n[[File:Centrul Vechi Baia Mare.jpg|thumb|The city centre]]\n\nIn 1703 [[Pintea Viteazul]] and his band managed to free the town for a short period of time from the [[Holy Roman Empire|German Imperial]] rule, under which it belonged the royal treasury. Since then Pintea is considered an important figure in the town's history, representing the idea of freedom. The Bude\u0219ti Church has Pintea's chain mail shirt and a helmet, reportedly worn by him in his battles.  The Museum of Baia Mare displays his weapons and their harness.\n\nIn 1748 the city's [[mining industry]] made a leap forward when the [[Austria]]n authorities created the headquarters of \"Superior Mining\".\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, [[Simon Holl\u00f3sy]], [[Istv\u00e1n R\u00e9ti]], [[J\u00e1nos Thorma]], [[B\u00e9la Iv\u00e1nyi-Gr\u00fcnwald]], and [[K\u00e1roly Ferenczy]] were among numerous young Hungarians who left the area to study the arts in [[Munich]], as Hungary lacked an academy of art in those times.<ref name=\"munich\">[http://www.mng.hu/kiallitasok/idoszaki/munchen_english ''Munich in Hungarian, Hungarian Artists in Munich 1850-1914''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630224433/http://www.mng.hu/kiallitasok/idoszaki/munchen_english |date=30 June 2010 }}, 2 October 2009 - Jan 2010, Hungarian National Gallery</ref> Simon Holl\u00f3sy, the young Hungarian painter, was teaching in his studio new western European techniques.\n\n[[File:BaiaMareFotoThalerTamas.jpg|thumb|Stephen's Tower in the city centre]]\n\nSome of those young painters decided to settle down together in Baia Mare, then called Nagyb\u00e1nya, to work on art.

It was re-occupied by Hungary between 1940-1944 under the [[Second Vienna Award]] between Hungary and Germany, during [[World War II]]. Near the end of that period, the city hosted the [[Baia Mare ghetto]]. After the war, the city was returned to Romania. Shortly after World War II in postwar development, the town of Baia Mare started to grow both in population and inhabited area. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a new [[town centre]] was developed with [[modern architecture]] buildings and structures.\n\nIn 2000, Baia Mare was the site of what has been considered [[2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill|Europe's worst ecological disaster]] since [[Chernobyl]], which took place at gold mining company Aurul, a joint-venture of the Australian company Esmeralda Exploration and the Romanian government.<ref name=\"allacademic.com\">[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/9/1/8/p109181_index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923163426/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/9/1/8/p109181_index.html |date=23 September 2009 }}</ref> The tailing dam at the gold processing plant broke and {{convert|100000|m3|0|abbr=off}} 70 tons of toxic [[cyanide]] and [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]-laced waste water escaped into the River [[Tisza]] and into Hungary, making its way into the Danube and affecting Romania, Hungary, Ukraine, Serbia, and Bulgaria.<ref name=\"allacademic.com\"/> More than 1,400 tons of fish, numerous eagles, storks and otters died.<ref name=\"allacademic.com\"/> Scientists fear the release may have led to the ultimate extinction of at least five fish species.<ref>\"Report of the International Task Force for Assessing the Baia Mare Accident\" available at http://www.reliefweb.int/library/documents/eubaiamare.pdf</ref> Despite the accident's happening in Romania, much of the adverse effects were suffered in Hungary.

The area is famous for its outstanding landscapes, and the mountains are easily accessible from the city, famous routes being: Igni\u0219 (1307 m), Mogo\u0219a (1246 m), Gut\u00e2i (1443 m), Creasta Coco\u0219ului (1450 m), Piatra Soimului (839 m), Plestioara (803 m), Dealul Bulat (683 m), Murgau (633 m), Dealul Crucii (500 m) etc.\n\nThe city is situated in the Baia Mare valley and is encircled on all sides by hills and mountains, which makes the climate in the city milder than the rest of the surrounding area. Proof of this is that the outskirts of Baia Mare are the only areas where you can find chestnut trees that usually need [[Mediterranean]] climate to grow. This is the northernmost reach of the [[chestnut tree]].\nHowever, abrupt temperature changes take place and, during the winters, the temperatures may occasionally drop below -20 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe summers are mild, cooler than in the rest of the country. The precipitations in this area are quite high, due to the mountains in the north and east which do not allow the air masses to pass beyond the region's limits, the average rainfall being almost 1000&nbsp;mm/year. The city of Baia Mare is the most populous of northern Romanian cities ([[Satu Mare]], [[Suceava]], and [[Boto\u0219ani]]), with a population of approximately 124,000. It also has a high level of culture and education, being home to theatres, schools, museums and art galleries.\n\nNot far from the city there are a few very important natural reservations, among them Creasta Coco\u0219ului, Cheile T\u0103t\u0103rului, Lacul Albastru etc. Because of its privileged location in the [[Eastern Carpathian]] mountains it is considered one of the most picturesque cities in [[Romania]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1912 |12877\n|1930 |13904\n|1948 |20959\n|1956 |35920\n|1966 |62658\n|1977 |100985\n|1992 |149205\n|2002 |137976\n|2011 |123738\n}}\n\nAs of [[Demographic history of Romania|2011 census]] data, Baia Mare has a population of 123,738, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census.<ref name=\"INSSER\"/>\nThe ethnic composition of the city is as follows:\n* [[Romanians|Romanian]]: (84.11%)\n* [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]]: (12.25%)\n* [[Roma in Romania|Roma]]: (2.76%)\n* [[Germans in Romania|Germans]]: (0.24%)\n* [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]: (0.16%)\n* [[Jew]]s: (0.02%)\n\nand 642 others, including [[Greeks]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Italians]], [[Lippovans]], [[Poles]] and [[Slovaks]].\n\n[[Baia Mare metropolitan area]] has a population of 215,932, an area of 1,395.38 square kilometres (538.76 sq mi), and includes the municipality of Baia Mare, five towns ([[Baia Sprie]], [[Cavnic]], [[Seini]], [[\u0218omcuta Mare]] and [[T\u0103u\u021bii-M\u0103gher\u0103u\u0219]]), and 13 communes ([[Cerne\u0219ti]], [[Cic\u00e2rl\u0103u]], [[Coa\u0219]], [[Colt\u0103u]], [[Copalnic-M\u0103n\u0103\u0219tur]], [[Dumbr\u0103vi\u021ba, Maramure\u0219|Dumbr\u0103vi\u021ba]], [[Gro\u0219i]], [[Mire\u0219u Mare]], [[Recea, Maramure\u0219|Recea]], [[Remetea Chioarului]], [[Satulung]], [[S\u0103c\u0103l\u0103\u0219eni]] and [[Valea Chioarului]]).<ref>[http://www.zmbm.ro/documente/act-constitutiv-zmbm-633.html \"Articles of Incorporation\"] at zmbm.ro</ref>\n\n===Historical population===\nIn 1912, out of the total population of 12,877 people, 9,992 were Hungarians (including Jews), 2,677 Romanians, and 175 Germans.\n\nIn 1920, of the 12,780 inhabitants, 5,005 were Romanians, 4,652 Hungarians, 1,792 Jews, 1,232 Germans and 99 of other ethnicities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kia.hu/konyvtar/erdely/erd2002/abetn02.pdf|title=ERD\u00c9LY ETNIKAI \u00c9S FELEKEZETI STATISZTIK\u00c1JA\n}}</ref> Many inhabitants declared themselves as Hungarian-speakers during previous censuses, despite not being ethnic Hungarians.\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], Baia Mare had a community of more than 1,000 [[Jews]].

[[S\u0103sar River]], in northwestern [[Romania]]; it is the capital of [[Maramure\u0219 County]]. The city is situated about {{convert|600|km|0|abbr=off}} from [[Bucharest]], {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}} from the border with [[Hungary]], and {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} from the border with [[Ukraine]].\n\nLocated south of Igni\u0219 and [[Gut\u00e2i Mountains]], Baia Mare had a population of 123,738 at the 2011 census, and a [[Baia Mare metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] home to 230,932 residents. The city administers four villages: Blidari (''K\u0151b\u00e1nya''), Firiza (''Fels\u0151fernezely''), Valea Borcutului (''Borpatak'') and Valea Neagr\u0103 (''Feketepatak''). Baia Mare has been named the Romanian Youth Capital from 2 May 2018 to 1 May 2019.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of Maramure\u0219|History of Transylvania}}\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n{{Main|Prehistory of Transylvania}}\nThe city's development on the middle course of [[S\u0103sar River]], in the middle of a [[plateau]] with a warm Mediterranean-like climate, has facilitated living conditions since the [[Palaeolithic]].\n\n=== Ancient times ===\n{{See also|Bronze Age in Romania|Dacians|Dacia}}\nDuring the [[Bronze Age]] the region was inhabited by [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribes. Later, it was included in the [[Dacian Kingdom]] formed by the King [[Burebista]] when the mining exploration began, as the area is rich in [[gold]] and [[silver]].\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n{{See also|Transylvania in the Middle Ages|Romania in the Middle Ages}}\nBaia Mare is first mentioned in written documents released by [[Charles I of Hungary]] in 1328 under the name of ''Rivulus Dominarum'' ({{lang-en|Ladies' River}}). In 1347 the town was identified in documents by [[Louis I of Hungary]] as an important [[medieval]] town with a prosperous [[mining industry]].  Its rules of organisation were characteristic of the \"free towns\" of that time.  In 1411 the town and its surrounding areas, including the mines, were transferred into the property of the [[Hunyadi family]] by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], King of Hungary (later also Holy Roman Emperor), who recognised [[John Hunyadi|Janos Hunyadi]]'s contribution to stop the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] invasion of Europe.\n\nThe town entered into a period of prosperity, during which the [[Stephen I of Hungary|St. Stephen]] [[Cathedral]] was built. Today the cathedral tower is one of the best-known of the town's historic landmarks (see [[Stephen's Tower (Baia Mare)|Stephen's Tower]]).  The first [[school]], named ''Schola Rivulina'', was opened in Baia Mare in 1547 by the [[Reformed Church]] following the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\n=== Modern period ===\n{{See also|Modern history of Transylvania|Modern history of Romania}}\n\n[[File:Centrul Vechi Baia Mare.jpg|thumb|The city centre]]\n\nIn 1703 [[Pintea Viteazul]] and his band managed to free the town for a short period of time from the [[Holy Roman Empire|German Imperial]] rule, under which it belonged the royal treasury. Since then Pintea is considered an important figure in the town's history, representing the idea of freedom. The Bude\u0219ti Church has Pintea's chain mail shirt and a helmet, reportedly worn by him in his battles.  The Museum of Baia Mare displays his weapons and their harness.\n\nIn 1748 the city's [[mining industry]] made a leap forward when the [[Austria]]n authorities created the headquarters of \"Superior Mining\".\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, [[Simon Holl\u00f3sy]], [[Istv\u00e1n R\u00e9ti]], [[J\u00e1nos Thorma]], [[B\u00e9la Iv\u00e1nyi-Gr\u00fcnwald]], and [[K\u00e1roly Ferenczy]] were among numerous young Hungarians who left the area to study the arts in [[Munich]], as Hungary lacked an academy of art in those times.<ref name=\"munich\">[http://www.mng.hu/kiallitasok/idoszaki/munchen_english ''Munich in Hungarian, Hungarian Artists in Munich 1850-1914''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630224433/http://www.mng.hu/kiallitasok/idoszaki/munchen_english |date=30 June 2010 }}, 2 October 2009 - Jan 2010, Hungarian National Gallery</ref> Simon Holl\u00f3sy, the young Hungarian painter, was teaching in his studio new western European techniques.\n\n[[File:BaiaMareFotoThalerTamas.jpg|thumb|Stephen's Tower in the city centre]]\n\nSome of those young painters decided to settle down together in Baia Mare, then called Nagyb\u00e1nya, to work on art.

It was re-occupied by Hungary between 1940-1944 under the [[Second Vienna Award]] between Hungary and Germany, during [[World War II]]. Near the end of that period, the city hosted the [[Baia Mare ghetto]]. After the war, the city was returned to Romania. Shortly after World War II in postwar development, the town of Baia Mare started to grow both in population and inhabited area. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a new [[town centre]] was developed with [[modern architecture]] buildings and structures.\n\nIn 2000, Baia Mare was the site of what has been considered [[2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill|Europe's worst ecological disaster]] since [[Chernobyl]], which took place at gold mining company Aurul, a joint-venture of the Australian company Esmeralda Exploration and the Romanian government.<ref name=\"allacademic.com\">[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/9/1/8/p109181_index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923163426/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/9/1/8/p109181_index.html |date=23 September 2009 }}</ref> The tailing dam at the gold processing plant broke and {{convert|100000|m3|0|abbr=off}} 70 tons of toxic [[cyanide]] and [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]-laced waste water escaped into the River [[Tisza]] and into Hungary, making its way into the Danube and affecting Romania, Hungary, Ukraine, Serbia, and Bulgaria.<ref name=\"allacademic.com\"/> More than 1,400 tons of fish, numerous eagles, storks and otters died.<ref name=\"allacademic.com\"/> Scientists fear the release may have led to the ultimate extinction of at least five fish species.<ref>\"Report of the International Task Force for Assessing the Baia Mare Accident\" available at http://www.reliefweb.int/library/documents/eubaiamare.pdf</ref> Despite the accident's happening in Romania, much of the adverse effects were suffered in Hungary.

The shield is topped by a [[mural crown]] with seven towers.\n\nThe miner refers to the main local economical activity. The church tower refers to the local cultural/ecclesiastical tradition. The crest shows the city's status as a [[Maramure\u0219 County|county]] seat.\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[File:Ethnographic Museum in Baia Mare.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Ethnographic Museum]]\n\nThe city is situated in the vicinity of the [[Gut\u00e2i Mountains|Gut\u00e2i]] and Igni\u0219 Mountains. Altitudes reach 1400 meters in some peaks. The area is famous for its outstanding landscapes, and the mountains are easily accessible from the city, famous routes being: Igni\u0219 (1307 m), Mogo\u0219a (1246 m), Gut\u00e2i (1443 m), Creasta Coco\u0219ului (1450 m), Piatra Soimului (839 m), Plestioara (803 m), Dealul Bulat (683 m), Murgau (633 m), Dealul Crucii (500 m) etc.\n\nThe city is situated in the Baia Mare valley and is encircled on all sides by hills and mountains, which makes the climate in the city milder than the rest of the surrounding area. Proof of this is that the outskirts of Baia Mare are the only areas where you can find chestnut trees that usually need [[Mediterranean]] climate to grow. This is the northernmost reach of the [[chestnut tree]].\nHowever, abrupt temperature changes take place and, during the winters, the temperatures may occasionally drop below -20 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe summers are mild, cooler than in the rest of the country. The precipitations in this area are quite high, due to the mountains in the north and east which do not allow the air masses to pass beyond the region's limits, the average rainfall being almost 1000&nbsp;mm/year. The city of Baia Mare is the most populous of northern Romanian cities ([[Satu Mare]], [[Suceava]], and [[Boto\u0219ani]]), with a population of approximately 124,000. It also has a high level of culture and education, being home to theatres, schools, museums and art galleries.\n\nNot far from the city there are a few very important natural reservations, among them Creasta Coco\u0219ului, Cheile T\u0103t\u0103rului, Lacul Albastru etc. Because of its privileged location in the [[Eastern Carpathian]] mountains it is considered one of the most picturesque cities in [[Romania]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1912 |12877\n|1930 |13904\n|1948 |20959\n|1956 |35920\n|1966 |62658\n|1977 |100985\n|1992 |149205\n|2002 |137976\n|2011 |123738\n}}\n\nAs of [[Demographic history of Romania|2011 census]] data, Baia Mare has a population of 123,738, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census.<ref name=\"INSSER\"/>\nThe ethnic composition of the city is as follows:\n* [[Romanians|Romanian]]: (84.11%)\n* [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]]: (12.25%)\n* [[Roma in Romania|Roma]]: (2.76%)\n* [[Germans in Romania|Germans]]: (0.24%)\n* [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]: (0.16%)\n* [[Jew]]s: (0.02%)\n\nand 642 others, including [[Greeks]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Italians]], [[Lippovans]], [[Poles]] and [[Slovaks]].\n\n[[Baia Mare metropolitan area]] has a population of 215,932, an area of 1,395.38 square kilometres (538.76 sq mi), and includes the municipality of Baia Mare, five towns ([[Baia Sprie]], [[Cavnic]], [[Seini]], [[\u0218omcuta Mare]] and [[T\u0103u\u021bii-M\u0103gher\u0103u\u0219]]), and 13 communes ([[Cerne\u0219ti]], [[Cic\u00e2rl\u0103u]], [[Coa\u0219]], [[Colt\u0103u]], [[Copalnic-M\u0103n\u0103\u0219tur]], [[Dumbr\u0103vi\u021ba, Maramure\u0219|Dumbr\u0103vi\u021ba]], [[Gro\u0219i]], [[Mire\u0219u Mare]], [[Recea, Maramure\u0219|Recea]], [[Remetea Chioarului]], [[Satulung]], [[S\u0103c\u0103l\u0103\u0219eni]] and [[Valea Chioarului]]).<ref>[http://www.zmbm.ro/documente/act-constitutiv-zmbm-633.html \"Articles of Incorporation\"] at zmbm.ro</ref>\n\n===Historical population===\nIn 1912, out of the total population of 12,877 people, 9,992 were Hungarians (including Jews), 2,677 Romanians, and 175 Germans.\n\nIn 1920, of the 12,780 inhabitants, 5,005 were Romanians, 4,652 Hungarians, 1,792 Jews, 1,232 Germans and 99 of other ethnicities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kia.hu/konyvtar/erdely/erd2002/abetn02.pdf|title=ERD\u00c9LY ETNIKAI \u00c9S FELEKEZETI STATISZTIK\u00c1JA\n}}</ref> Many inhabitants declared themselves as Hungarian-speakers during previous censuses, despite not being ethnic Hungarians.\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], Baia Mare had a community of more than 1,000 [[Jews]].

Clarke]].\n\nIt also serves as the location of \"Tycho City\" in ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''; a lunar metropolis by the 24th century.\n\nIn the film ''[[Can't Buy Me Love (film)|Can't Buy Me Love]]'', Cindy notices Tycho while looking through a telescope on her final \"contractual\" date with Ronny in the Airplane Graveyard.\n\nIn [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s book ''[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]]'', Tycho is the location of the lunar habitat \"Tycho Under\".\n\nIn [[Jack Williamson]]'s novel ''[[Terraforming Earth]]'', the crater is utilized for \"Tycho Base\", a self-sustaining, robot-controlled installation aimed at restoring life to the (dead) planet Earth after an asteroid sterilizes the biosphere.\n\nIn Heinlein's short story \"[[Blowups Happen]]\", a character hypothesizes that Tycho may have been the location of a sentient race's main atomic power plant, in a past time when the Moon was still habitable\u2014and that the plant exploded, causing the craters, the rays spreading from Tycho, and the death of all life on the Moon.\n\n[[Clifford Simak]] set a novelette ''[[The Trouble with Tycho]]'', at the lunar crater. He also postulated that the crater's rays were composed of volcanic glass ([[tektites]]) akin to a theory postulated by NASA researchers Dean Chapman and John O'Keefe in the 1970s.\n\nCrater Tycho figures prominently in the [[Matthew Looney]] and [[Maria Looney]] series of children's books set on the Moon, authored by [[Jerome Beatty]].\n\nIn [[Roger Macbride Allen]]'s ''Hunted Earth'' series of novels, the Naked Purples own a former penal colony in or around Tycho crater known as \"Tycho Purple Penal\" (see [[The Ring of Charon]]).\n\nIn [[The Expanse (novel series)]] and [[The Expanse (TV series)]] \"Tycho\" is the name of a company known for its large-scale building projects all around the solar system. The company has their own space station named \"Tycho Station\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"230px\" heights=\"220px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:Lunar2007 eclipse-LiamG.jpg|March 2007 [[lunar eclipse]].

Clarke]].\n\nIt also serves as the location of \"Tycho City\" in ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''; a lunar metropolis by the 24th century.\n\nIn the film ''[[Can't Buy Me Love (film)|Can't Buy Me Love]]'', Cindy notices Tycho while looking through a telescope on her final \"contractual\" date with Ronny in the Airplane Graveyard.\n\nIn [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s book ''[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]]'', Tycho is the location of the lunar habitat \"Tycho Under\".\n\nIn [[Jack Williamson]]'s novel ''[[Terraforming Earth]]'', the crater is utilized for \"Tycho Base\", a self-sustaining, robot-controlled installation aimed at restoring life to the (dead) planet Earth after an asteroid sterilizes the biosphere.\n\nIn Heinlein's short story \"[[Blowups Happen]]\", a character hypothesizes that Tycho may have been the location of a sentient race's main atomic power plant, in a past time when the Moon was still habitable\u2014and that the plant exploded, causing the craters, the rays spreading from Tycho, and the death of all life on the Moon.\n\n[[Clifford Simak]] set a novelette ''[[The Trouble with Tycho]]'', at the lunar crater. He also postulated that the crater's rays were composed of volcanic glass ([[tektites]]) akin to a theory postulated by NASA researchers Dean Chapman and John O'Keefe in the 1970s.\n\nCrater Tycho figures prominently in the [[Matthew Looney]] and [[Maria Looney]] series of children's books set on the Moon, authored by [[Jerome Beatty]].\n\nIn [[Roger Macbride Allen]]'s ''Hunted Earth'' series of novels, the Naked Purples own a former penal colony in or around Tycho crater known as \"Tycho Purple Penal\" (see [[The Ring of Charon]]).\n\nIn [[The Expanse (novel series)]] and [[The Expanse (TV series)]] \"Tycho\" is the name of a company known for its large-scale building projects all around the solar system. The company has their own space station named \"Tycho Station\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"230px\" heights=\"220px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:Lunar2007 eclipse-LiamG.jpg|March 2007 [[lunar eclipse]].
