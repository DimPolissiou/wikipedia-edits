In Constantinople, he had been a senator, and he continued to fulfil various public functions, such as being a judge, and was regularly consulted by rulers of Morea. Despite suspicions of heresy from the Church, he was held in high Imperial favour.<ref>Hanegraaff p.31</ref>\n\nIn Mistra he taught and wrote philosophy, astronomy, history and geography, and compiled digests of many classical writers. His pupils included [[Basilios Bessarion]] and [[George Scholarius]] (later to become [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] and Plethon's enemy). He was made chief magistrate by [[Theodore II Palaiologos, Lord of Morea|Theodore II]].<ref name=\"Merry\"/> He produced his major writings during his time in Italy and after his return.<ref>Hanegraaff p.32</ref>\n\n===Council of Florence===\nIn 1428 Pletho was consulted by [[John VIII Palaiologos|Emperor John VIII]] on the issue of unifying the Greek and Latin churches, and advised that both delegations should have equal voting power.<ref name=\"Merry\"/> Byzantine scholars had been in contact with their counterparts in Western [[Europe]] since the time of the [[Latin Empire]], and especially since the Byzantine Empire had begun to ask for Western European help against the [[Ottomans]] in the 14th century. Western Europe had some access to ancient [[Greek philosophy]] through the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Muslim]]s, but the Byzantines had many documents and interpretations that the Westerners had never seen before. Byzantine scholarship became more fully available to the West after 1438, when [[Byzantine emperor]] [[John VIII Palaeologus]] attended the Council of Ferrara, later known as the [[Council of Florence]], to discuss a union of the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern (Orthodox)]] and [[Catholic Church|Western (Catholic)]] churches. Despite not beign a theologian, Pletho was chosen to accompany John VIII on the basis of his renowned wisdom and morality. Other delegates included Pletho's former students Bessarion, [[Mark Eugenikos]] and [[Gennadius Scholarius|Scholarios]].<ref name=\"DeBolt\">DeBolt, Darien C. (1998) [http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Medi/MediDebo.htm ''George Gemistos Plethon on God: Heterodoxy in Defence of Orthodoxy'']. A paper delivered at the Twentieth World Congress of Philosophy, Boston, Mass. Retrieved 2008-11-20.</ref>\n\n\n===Pletho and the Renaissance===\nAt the invitation of some Florentine humanists he set up a temporary school to lecture on the difference between Plato and Aristotle. Few of Plato's writings were studied in the Latin West at that time,<ref>''Timaeus'' in the partial translation of [[Calcidius]] was available; [[Henricus Aristippus]]' 12th century translation of the ''Meno'' and ''Phaedo'' was available, but obscure; [[Leonardo Bruni]]'s translations of the ''Phaedo'', ''Apology'', ''Crito'' and ''Phaedrus'' appeared only shortly before Pletho's visit. (DeBolt)</ref> and he essentially reintroduced much of Plato to the Western world, shaking the domination which [[Aristotle]] had come to exercise over Western European thought in the high and later [[middle ages]].\n\nMarsilio Ficino's introduction to the translation of Plotinus,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=James|first=Hankins|title=Cosimo de' Medici and the 'Platonic Academy'|url=https://www.academia.edu/22668009|journal=Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes|language=en|volume=53|issn=0075-4390}}</ref> has traditionally been interpreted to the effect that [[Cosimo de' Medici]] attended Pletho's lectures and was inspired to found the ''[[Platonic Academy (Florence)|Accademia Platonica]]'' in Florence, where Italian students of Pletho continued to teach after the conclusion of the council.<ref name=\"DeBolt\"/> However, according to [[James Hankins]], Ficino was misunderstood. In fact, communication between Pletho and Cosimo de' Medici - for whose meeting there is no independent evidence - would have been severely constrained by the language barrier. Furthermore, Ficino's \"Platonic Academy\" was more of an \"informal gymnasium\" that did not have a particularly Platonic orientation.<ref>Hanegraaff p.41</ref> Nevertheless, Pletho came to be considered one of the most important influences on the Italian [[Renaissance]]. [[Marsilio Ficino]], the Florentine [[Humanism|humanist]] and the first director of the Accademia Platonica, paid Plethon the ultimate honour, calling him 'the second Plato', while Cardinal Bessarion speculated as to whether Plato's soul occupied his body. Plethon may also have been the source for Ficino's [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] system of [[natural magic]].<ref name=\"Merry\"/>\n\nWhile still in Florence, Pletho wrote a volume titled ''Wherein Aristotle disagrees with Plato'', commonly called ''De Differentiis'', to correct the misunderstandings he had encountered. He claimed he had written it \"without serious intent\" while incapacitated through illness, \"to comfort myself and to please those who are dedicated to Plato\".<ref>Hanegraaff p.32</ref> [[Gennadius Scholarius|George Scholarius]] responded with a ''Defence of Aristotle'', which elicited Plethon's subsequent ''Reply''. Expatriate Byzantine scholars and later Italian humanists continued the argument.<ref name=\"DeBolt\"/>\n\nPletho died in Mistra in 1452, or in 1454, according to J. Monfasani (the difference between the two dates being significant as to whether or not Plethon still lived to know of the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453). In 1466, some of his Italian disciples, headed by [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]], stole his remains from Mistra and interred them in the [[Tempio Malatestiano]] in [[Rimini]], \"so that the great Teacher may be among free men\".\n\n==Writings==\n[[Image:Plethon autograph.jpg|thumb|One of Plethon's manuscripts ([[Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana]], Venice)]]\n\n===Reform of the Peloponnese===\nBelieving that the Peloponnesians were direct descendants of the [[Hellenistic Greece|ancient Hellenes]], Plethon rejected Justinian's idea of a [[universal Empire]] in favour of recreating the [[Hellenistic civilization]], the zenith of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] influence.<ref>James Henderson Burns, ''The Cambridge history of medieval political thought c. 350\u2013c. 1450,'' [[Cambridge University Press]], 1988.</ref> In his 1415 and 1418 pamphlets he urged [[Manuel II Palaiologos|Manuel II]] and his son Theodore to turn the peninsula into a cultural island with a new constitution of strongly centralised monarchy advised by a small body of middle-class educated men. The army must be composed only of professional native Greek soldiers, who would be supported by the taxpayers, or \"[[Helots]]\" who would be exempt from military service. Land was to be publicly owned, and a third of all produce given to the state fund; incentives would be given for cultivating virgin land. Trade would be regulated and the use of coinage limited, barter instead being encouraged; locally available products would be supported over imports. Mutilation as a punishment would be abolished, and chain gangs introduced. Homosexuals and sexual deviants would be burnt at the stake. The social and political ideas in these pamphlets were largely derived from Plato's ''Republic''. Plethon touched little on religion, although he expressed disdain for monks, who \"render no service to the common good\". He vaguely prescribed three religious principles: belief in a supreme being; that this being has concern for mankind; and that it is uninfluenced by gifts or flattery. Manuel and Theodore did not act on any of these reforms.<ref name=\"CambridgePolitical\"/>\n\n===''De Differentiis''===\nIn ''De Differentiis'' Plethon compares Aristotle's and Plato's conceptions of God, arguing that Plato credits God with more exalted powers as \"creator of every kind of intelligible and separate substance, and hence of our entire universe\", while Aristotle has God as only the motive force of the universe; Plato's God is also the end and final cause of existence, while Aristotle's God is only the end of movement and change.<ref name=\"DeBolt\"/> Plethon derides Aristotle for discussing unimportant matters such as shellfish and embryos while failing to credit God with creating the universe,<ref name=\"DeBolt\"/> for believing the heavens are composed of a fifth element, and for his view that contemplation was the greatest pleasure; the latter aligned him with [[Epicurus]], Plethon argued, and he attributed this same pleasure-seeking to monks, whom he accused of laziness.<ref name=\"Merry\"/> Later, in response to [[Gennadius Scholarius|Gennadius]]' ''Defence of Aristotle'', Plethon argued in his ''Reply'' that Plato's God was more consistent with Christian doctrine than Aristotle's, and this, according to Darien DeBolt, was probably in part an attempt to escape suspicion of [[heterodoxy]].<ref name=\"DeBolt\"/>\n\n===''Nomoi''===\n{{quote|I myself heard him at Florence ... asserting that in a few more years the whole world would accept one and the same religion with one mind, one intelligence, one teaching. And when I asked him \u201cChrist\u2019s or Muhammad\u2019s?,\u201d he said, \u201cNeither; but it will not differ much from paganism.\u201d I was so shocked by these words that I hated him ever after and feared him like a poisonous viper, and I could no longer bear to see or hear him. I heard, too, from a number of Greeks who escaped here from the Peloponnese that he openly said before he died ... that not many years after his death Muhammad and Christ would collapse and the true truth would shine through every region of the globe.|[[George of Trebizond]], ''Comparatio Platonis et Aristotelis'', fol. v63<ref>Hanegraaff, p. 38.</ref>}}\n\nAfter his death, Plethon's ''N\u00f3m\u014dn syngraph\u1e17'' (\u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae) or ''N\u00f3moi'' (\u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9, \"Book of Laws\") was discovered. It came into the possession of Princess Theodora, wife of [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]], [[despot of Morea]]. Theodora sent the manuscript to Scholarius, now Gennadius II, Patriarch of Constantinople, asking for his advice on what to do with it; he returned it, advising her to destroy it. Morea was under invasion from Sultan [[Mehmet II]], and Theodora escaped with Demetrios to Constantinople where she gave the manuscript back to Gennadius, reluctant to destroy the only copy of such a distinguished scholar's work herself. Gennadius [[book burning|burnt]] it in 1460; however, in a letter to the Exarch Joseph (which still survives) he details the book, providing chapter headings and brief summaries of the contents.<ref name=\"DeBolt\"/> It seemed to represent a merging of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] mysticism, and discussed [[astrology]], [[Daemon (mythology)|daemons]] and the migration of the soul. He recommended religious rites and hymns to petition the classical gods, such as [[Zeus]], whom he saw as universal principles and planetary powers. Man, as relative of the gods, should strive towards good. Plethon believed the universe has no beginning or end in time, and being created perfect, nothing may be added to it. He rejected the concept of a brief reign of evil followed by perpetual happiness, and held that the human soul is reincarnated, directed by the gods into successive bodies to fulfill divine order. This same divine order, he believed, governed the organisation of bees, the foresight of ants and the dexterity of spiders, as well as the growth of plants, magnetic attraction, and the amalgamation of mercury and gold.<ref name=\"Merry\"/>\n\nPlethon drew up plans in his ''N\u00f3moi'' to radically change the structure and philosophy of the Byzantine Empire in line with his interpretation of Platonism. The new state religion was to be founded on a hierarchical pantheon of pagan gods, based largely upon the ideas of [[humanism]] prevalent at the time, incorporating themes such as rationalism and logic. As an ad-hoc measure he also supported the reconciliation of the two churches in order to secure Western Europe's support against the Ottomans.<ref>''Journal of Hellenic Studies'', Vol. 7, p. 356.</ref> He also proposed more practical, immediate measures, such as rebuilding the [[Hexamilion]], the ancient defensive wall across the [[Isthmus of Corinth]], which had been breached by the Ottomans in 1423.\n\nThe political and social elements of his theories covered the creation of communities, government (he promoted benevolent monarchy as the most stable form), land ownership (land should be shared, rather than individually owned), social organisation, families, and divisions of sex and class. He believed that labourers should keep a third of their produce, and that soldiers should be professional. He held that love should be private not because it is shameful, but because it is sacred.<ref name=\"Merry\"/>\n\n===''Summary''===\nPlethon's own summary of the ''N\u00f3moi'' also survived, amongst manuscripts held by his former student [[Bessarion]]. This summary, titled ''Summary of the Doctrines of Zoroaster and Plato'', affirms the existence of a pantheon of gods, with [[Zeus]] as supreme sovereign, containing within himself all being in an undivided state; his eldest child, motherless, is [[Poseidon]], who created the heavens and rules all below, ordaining order in the universe. Zeus' other children include an array of \"supercelestial\" gods, the Olympians and Tartareans, all motherless. Of these [[Hera]] is third in command after Poseidon, creatress and ruler of indestructible matter, and the mother by Zeus of the heavenly gods, demi-gods and spirits. The Olympians rule immortal life in the heavens, the Tartareans mortal life below, their leader Kronos ruling over mortality altogether. The eldest of the heavenly gods is Helios, master of the heavens here and source of all mortal life on earth. The gods are responsible for much good and no evil, and guide all life towards divine order. Plethon describes the creation of the universe as being perfect and outside of time, so that the universe remains eternal, without beginning or end. The soul of man, like the gods is immortal and essentially good, and is reincarnated in successive mortal bodies for eternity at the direction of the gods.<ref name=\"DeBolt\"/>\n\n===Other works===\n[[File:Tempio malatestiano, ri, fianco dx, tomba 03 di giorgio gemisto pletone.JPG|thumb|His tomb on a side of [[Tempio Malatestiano]], [[Rimini]].]]\n\nMany of Plethon's other works still exist in manuscript form in various European libraries. Most of Plethon's works can be found in [[Jacques Paul Migne|J. P. Migne]]'s ''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'' collection; for a complete list see [[Johann Albert Fabricius|Fabricius]], ''Bibliotheca Graeca'' (ed. [[Gottlieb Christoph Harless|Harles]]), xii.\n\n==In modern literature==\nEarly in his writing career, [[E. M. Forster]] attempted a historical novel about Plethon and [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]], but was not satisfied with the result and never published it \u2014 though he kept the manuscript and later showed it to [[Naomi Mitchison]].<ref>Mentioned in a 1925 letter to Mitchison, quoted in her autobiography ''You May Well Ask: A Memoir 1920\u20131940''{{cite book|last1=Mitchison|first1=Naomi|title=You May Well Ask: A Memoir 1920\u20131940|year=1986|origyear=1979|publisher=Fontana Paperbacks|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-654193-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nas5AAAACAAJ&dq|chapter=11: Morgan Comes to Tea}}</ref>\n\nEzra Pound included Plethon in his poem ''The Cantos''. References to Plethon and Sigismondo Malatesta can be found in canto 8. Plethon is also mentioned in canto 23 and 26. Pound was fascinated by the role that Plethon's conversation must have had on Cosimo de Medici and his decision to acquire Greek manuscripts of Plato and Neoplatonic philosophers. By having manuscripts brought from Greece and becoming the patron of \"the young boy, Ficino,\" Cosimo facilitated the preservation and transmission of Greek cultural patrimony into the modern world after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Plethon thus played a key but hidden role in the Italian Renaissance.\n\nPletho is a major character in the historical novel [[Porphyry and Ash]] set in the final year of the Byzantine Empire.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Byzantine scholars in the Renaissance]]\n* [[Christian heresy]]\n* [[Hellenistic religion]]\n* [[Polytheistic reconstructionism]]\n* [[Renaissance humanism]]\n* [[Renaissance magic]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Benakis, A.

In Constantinople, he had been a senator, and he continued to fulfil various public functions, such as being a judge, and was regularly consulted by rulers of Morea. Despite suspicions of heresy from the Church, he was held in high Imperial favour.<ref>Hanegraaff p.31</ref>\n\nIn Mistra he taught and wrote philosophy, astronomy, history and geography, and compiled digests of many classical writers. His pupils included [[Basilios Bessarion]] and [[George Scholarius]] (later to become [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] and Plethon's enemy).

Western Europe had some access to ancient [[Greek philosophy]] through the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Muslim]]s, but the Byzantines had many documents and interpretations that the Westerners had never seen before. Byzantine scholarship became more fully available to the West after 1438, when [[Byzantine emperor]] [[John VIII Palaeologus]] attended the Council of Ferrara, later known as the [[Council of Florence]], to discuss a union of the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern (Orthodox)]] and [[Catholic Church|Western (Catholic)]] churches. Despite not beign a theologian, Pletho was chosen to accompany John VIII on the basis of his renowned wisdom and morality. Other delegates included Pletho's former students Bessarion, [[Mark Eugenikos]] and [[Gennadius Scholarius|Scholarios]].<ref name=\"DeBolt\">DeBolt, Darien C. (1998) [http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Medi/MediDebo.htm ''George Gemistos Plethon on God: Heterodoxy in Defence of Orthodoxy'']. A paper delivered at the Twentieth World Congress of Philosophy, Boston, Mass. Retrieved 2008-11-20.</ref>\n\n\n==Pletho and the Renaissance==\nAt the invitation of some Florentine humanists he set up a temporary school to lecture on the difference between Plato and Aristotle. Few of Plato's writings were studied in the Latin West at that time,<ref>''Timaeus'' in the partial translation of [[Calcidius]] was available; [[Henricus Aristippus]]' 12th century translation of the ''Meno'' and ''Phaedo'' was available, but obscure; [[Leonardo Bruni]]'s translations of the ''Phaedo'', ''Apology'', ''Crito'' and ''Phaedrus'' appeared only shortly before Pletho's visit. (DeBolt)</ref> and he essentially reintroduced much of Plato to the Western world, shaking the domination which [[Aristotle]] had come to exercise over Western European thought in the high and later [[middle ages]].\n\nMarsilio Ficino's introduction to the translation of Plotinus,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=James|first=Hankins|title=Cosimo de' Medici and the 'Platonic Academy'|url=https://www.academia.edu/22668009|journal=Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes|language=en|volume=53|issn=0075-4390}}</ref> has traditionally been interpreted to the effect that [[Cosimo de' Medici]] attended Pletho's lectures and was inspired to found the ''[[Platonic Academy (Florence)|Accademia Platonica]]'' in Florence, where Italian students of Pletho continued to teach after the conclusion of the council.<ref name=\"DeBolt\"/> However, according to [[James Hankins]], Ficino was misunderstood. In fact, communication between Pletho and Cosimo de' Medici - for whose meeting there is no independent evidence - would have been severely constrained by the language barrier. Furthermore, Ficino's \"Platonic Academy\" was more of an \"informal gymnasium\" that did not have a particularly Platonic orientation.<ref>Hanegraaff p.41</ref> Nevertheless, Pletho came to be considered one of the most important influences on the Italian [[Renaissance]]. [[Marsilio Ficino]], the Florentine [[Humanism|humanist]] and the first director of the Accademia Platonica, paid Plethon the ultimate honour, calling him 'the second Plato', while Cardinal Bessarion speculated as to whether Plato's soul occupied his body. Plethon may also have been the source for Ficino's [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] system of [[natural magic]].<ref name=\"Merry\"/>\n\nWhile still in Florence, Pletho wrote a volume titled ''Wherein Aristotle disagrees with Plato'', commonly called ''De Differentiis'', to correct the misunderstandings he had encountered. He claimed he had written it \"without serious intent\" while incapacitated through illness, \"to comfort myself and to please those who are dedicated to Plato\".<ref>Hanegraaff p.32</ref> [[Gennadius Scholarius|George Scholarius]] responded with a ''Defence of Aristotle'', which elicited Plethon's subsequent ''Reply''. Expatriate Byzantine scholars and later Italian humanists continued the argument.<ref name=\"DeBolt\"/>\n\nPletho died in Mistra in 1452, or in 1454, according to J. Monfasani (the difference between the two dates being significant as to whether or not Plethon still lived to know of the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453). In 1466, some of his Italian disciples, headed by [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]], stole his remains from Mistra and interred them in the [[Tempio Malatestiano]] in [[Rimini]], \"so that the great Teacher may be among free men\".\n\n==Writings==\n[[Image:Plethon autograph.jpg|thumb|One of Plethon's manuscripts ([[Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana]], Venice)]]\n\n===Reform of the Peloponnese===\nBelieving that the Peloponnesians were direct descendants of the [[Hellenistic Greece|ancient Hellenes]], Plethon rejected Justinian's idea of a [[universal Empire]] in favour of recreating the [[Hellenistic civilization]], the zenith of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] influence.<ref>James Henderson Burns, ''The Cambridge history of medieval political thought c. 350\u2013c. 1450,'' [[Cambridge University Press]], 1988.</ref> In his 1415 and 1418 pamphlets he urged [[Manuel II Palaiologos|Manuel II]] and his son Theodore to turn the peninsula into a cultural island with a new constitution of strongly centralised monarchy advised by a small body of middle-class educated men. The army must be composed only of professional native Greek soldiers, who would be supported by the taxpayers, or \"[[Helots]]\" who would be exempt from military service. Land was to be publicly owned, and a third of all produce given to the state fund; incentives would be given for cultivating virgin land. Trade would be regulated and the use of coinage limited, barter instead being encouraged; locally available products would be supported over imports. Mutilation as a punishment would be abolished, and chain gangs introduced. Homosexuals and sexual deviants would be burnt at the stake. The social and political ideas in these pamphlets were largely derived from Plato's ''Republic''. Plethon touched little on religion, although he expressed disdain for monks, who \"render no service to the common good\". He vaguely prescribed three religious principles: belief in a supreme being; that this being has concern for mankind; and that it is uninfluenced by gifts or flattery. Manuel and Theodore did not act on any of these reforms.<ref name=\"CambridgePolitical\"/>\n\n===''De Differentiis''===\nIn ''De Differentiis'' Plethon compares Aristotle's and Plato's conceptions of God, arguing that Plato credits God with more exalted powers as \"creator of every kind of intelligible and separate substance, and hence of our entire universe\", while Aristotle has God as only the motive force of the universe; Plato's God is also the end and final cause of existence, while Aristotle's God is only the end of movement and change.<ref name=\"DeBolt\"/> Plethon derides Aristotle for discussing unimportant matters such as shellfish and embryos while failing to credit God with creating the universe,<ref name=\"DeBolt\"/> for believing the heavens are composed of a fifth element, and for his view that contemplation was the greatest pleasure; the latter aligned him with [[Epicurus]], Plethon argued, and he attributed this same pleasure-seeking to monks, whom he accused of laziness.<ref name=\"Merry\"/> Later, in response to [[Gennadius Scholarius|Gennadius]]' ''Defence of Aristotle'', Plethon argued in his ''Reply'' that Plato's God was more consistent with Christian doctrine than Aristotle's, and this, according to Darien DeBolt, was probably in part an attempt to escape suspicion of [[heterodoxy]].<ref name=\"DeBolt\"/>\n\n===''Nomoi''===\n{{quote|I myself heard him at Florence ... asserting that in a few more years the whole world would accept one and the same religion with one mind, one intelligence, one teaching. And when I asked him \u201cChrist\u2019s or Muhammad\u2019s?,\u201d he said, \u201cNeither; but it will not differ much from paganism.\u201d I was so shocked by these words that I hated him ever after and feared him like a poisonous viper, and I could no longer bear to see or hear him. I heard, too, from a number of Greeks who escaped here from the Peloponnese that he openly said before he died ... that not many years after his death Muhammad and Christ would collapse and the true truth would shine through every region of the globe.|[[George of Trebizond]], ''Comparatio Platonis et Aristotelis'', fol. v63<ref>Hanegraaff, p. 38.</ref>}}\n\nAfter his death, Plethon's ''N\u00f3m\u014dn syngraph\u1e17'' (\u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae) or ''N\u00f3moi'' (\u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9, \"Book of Laws\") was discovered. It came into the possession of Princess Theodora, wife of [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]], [[despot of Morea]]. Theodora sent the manuscript to Scholarius, now Gennadius II, Patriarch of Constantinople, asking for his advice on what to do with it; he returned it, advising her to destroy it. Morea was under invasion from Sultan [[Mehmet II]], and Theodora escaped with Demetrios to Constantinople where she gave the manuscript back to Gennadius, reluctant to destroy the only copy of such a distinguished scholar's work herself. Gennadius [[book burning|burnt]] it in 1460; however, in a letter to the Exarch Joseph (which still survives) he details the book, providing chapter headings and brief summaries of the contents.<ref name=\"DeBolt\"/> It seemed to represent a merging of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] mysticism, and discussed [[astrology]], [[Daemon (mythology)|daemons]] and the migration of the soul. He recommended religious rites and hymns to petition the classical gods, such as [[Zeus]], whom he saw as universal principles and planetary powers. Man, as relative of the gods, should strive towards good. Plethon believed the universe has no beginning or end in time, and being created perfect, nothing may be added to it. He rejected the concept of a brief reign of evil followed by perpetual happiness, and held that the human soul is reincarnated, directed by the gods into successive bodies to fulfill divine order. This same divine order, he believed, governed the organisation of bees, the foresight of ants and the dexterity of spiders, as well as the growth of plants, magnetic attraction, and the amalgamation of mercury and gold.<ref name=\"Merry\"/>\n\nPlethon drew up plans in his ''N\u00f3moi'' to radically change the structure and philosophy of the Byzantine Empire in line with his interpretation of Platonism. The new state religion was to be founded on a hierarchical pantheon of pagan gods, based largely upon the ideas of [[humanism]] prevalent at the time, incorporating themes such as rationalism and logic. As an ad-hoc measure he also supported the reconciliation of the two churches in order to secure Western Europe's support against the Ottomans.<ref>''Journal of Hellenic Studies'', Vol. 7, p. 356.</ref> He also proposed more practical, immediate measures, such as rebuilding the [[Hexamilion]], the ancient defensive wall across the [[Isthmus of Corinth]], which had been breached by the Ottomans in 1423.\n\nThe political and social elements of his theories covered the creation of communities, government (he promoted benevolent monarchy as the most stable form), land ownership (land should be shared, rather than individually owned), social organisation, families, and divisions of sex and class. He believed that labourers should keep a third of their produce, and that soldiers should be professional. He held that love should be private not because it is shameful, but because it is sacred.<ref name=\"Merry\"/>\n\n===''Summary''===\nPlethon's own summary of the ''N\u00f3moi'' also survived, amongst manuscripts held by his former student [[Bessarion]]. This summary, titled ''Summary of the Doctrines of Zoroaster and Plato'', affirms the existence of a pantheon of gods, with [[Zeus]] as supreme sovereign, containing within himself all being in an undivided state; his eldest child, motherless, is [[Poseidon]], who created the heavens and rules all below, ordaining order in the universe. Zeus' other children include an array of \"supercelestial\" gods, the Olympians and Tartareans, all motherless. Of these [[Hera]] is third in command after Poseidon, creatress and ruler of indestructible matter, and the mother by Zeus of the heavenly gods, demi-gods and spirits. The Olympians rule immortal life in the heavens, the Tartareans mortal life below, their leader Kronos ruling over mortality altogether. The eldest of the heavenly gods is Helios, master of the heavens here and source of all mortal life on earth. The gods are responsible for much good and no evil, and guide all life towards divine order. Plethon describes the creation of the universe as being perfect and outside of time, so that the universe remains eternal, without beginning or end. The soul of man, like the gods is immortal and essentially good, and is reincarnated in successive mortal bodies for eternity at the direction of the gods.<ref name=\"DeBolt\"/>\n\n===Other works===\n[[File:Tempio malatestiano, ri, fianco dx, tomba 03 di giorgio gemisto pletone.JPG|thumb|His tomb on a side of [[Tempio Malatestiano]], [[Rimini]].]]\n\nMany of Plethon's other works still exist in manuscript form in various European libraries. Most of Plethon's works can be found in [[Jacques Paul Migne|J. P. Migne]]'s ''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'' collection; for a complete list see [[Johann Albert Fabricius|Fabricius]], ''Bibliotheca Graeca'' (ed. [[Gottlieb Christoph Harless|Harles]]), xii.\n\n==In modern literature==\nEarly in his writing career, [[E. M. Forster]] attempted a historical novel about Plethon and [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]], but was not satisfied with the result and never published it \u2014 though he kept the manuscript and later showed it to [[Naomi Mitchison]].<ref>Mentioned in a 1925 letter to Mitchison, quoted in her autobiography ''You May Well Ask: A Memoir 1920\u20131940''{{cite book|last1=Mitchison|first1=Naomi|title=You May Well Ask: A Memoir 1920\u20131940|year=1986|origyear=1979|publisher=Fontana Paperbacks|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-654193-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nas5AAAACAAJ&dq|chapter=11: Morgan Comes to Tea}}</ref>\n\nEzra Pound included Plethon in his poem ''The Cantos''. References to Plethon and Sigismondo Malatesta can be found in canto 8. Plethon is also mentioned in canto 23 and 26. Pound was fascinated by the role that Plethon's conversation must have had on Cosimo de Medici and his decision to acquire Greek manuscripts of Plato and Neoplatonic philosophers. By having manuscripts brought from Greece and becoming the patron of \"the young boy, Ficino,\" Cosimo facilitated the preservation and transmission of Greek cultural patrimony into the modern world after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Plethon thus played a key but hidden role in the Italian Renaissance.\n\nPletho is a major character in the historical novel [[Porphyry and Ash]] set in the final year of the Byzantine Empire.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Byzantine scholars in the Renaissance]]\n* [[Christian heresy]]\n* [[Hellenistic religion]]\n* [[Polytheistic reconstructionism]]\n* [[Renaissance humanism]]\n* [[Renaissance magic]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Benakis, A.

Raymond was a bully. A muscular bully. He wouldn't let anybody from outside our neighborhood bother us. He would bother us. Raymond could be very mean.\"<ref name=laweekly.com/> A friend stated that Washington was a good [[American football|football]] player, but never participated as a member of school sports team due to his poor grades. Washington was repeatedly [[expulsion (academia)|expelled]] from schools resulting in frequent transfers, attending [[Locke High School]], [[John C. Fremont High School]], an [[alternative school]] attached to [[Washington Preparatory High School]], and [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]] in the [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles|Fairfax District]] near [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]].\n\n===Gang involvement===\nIn the late 1960s, there was an increase in [[Juvenile delinquency|youth crime]] in Los Angeles, particularly in and around South Central's [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] neighborhood. Crime was especially prevalent in the three [[public housing|housing projects]] located in Watts, known as \"the Bricks\": [[Imperial Courts]], [[Nickerson Gardens]], and [[Jordan Downs]], where violent street [[robbery|robberies]] were common among adolescent criminals. Older [[African Americans|African-American]] street [[gang]]s in South Central like the Slausons, the Businessmen, and the Gladiators, had been ended by activist groups such as the [[Black Panther Party]] and the [[US Organization]]. The absence of the old gangs saw numerous new youth gangs begin to form in their place, including the Sportsmans Park, New House Boys, Acey Duecy, and Chain Gang, on West Side.\n\nWashington, a native of the East Side in his early teens during the rise of the gangs, joined a local street gang called The Avenues, led by another teenager named Craig Munson. At age 15, Washington beat up Munson's younger brother in fist fight after discovering Munson had put a gun to his older brother, Reggie Washington. After the fight, Washington and one of his other older brothers, Ronald Joe, confronted Munson on the corner of E 81st Street and Avalon Boulevard. According to former gang members who knew Washington at the time, he was subsequently beaten up by Craig Munson in retaliation for his younger brother's beating, and Washington left The Avenues. In late 1969, Washington organized his own gang called the Baby Avenues, recruiting a group of other neighborhood youths in South Central. The Baby Avenues wanted to emulate a gang of older youths called The Avenue Boys, which had been active since 1964 on Central Avenue.\n\n\n====Unification of South Central gangs====\nIn 1971, Washington approached [[Stanley Williams|Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams]], a similar gang leader from South Central's West Side who used his reputation as a fist fighter to unite gangs under his control, at Washington Preparatory High School where both were attending. Washington had heard of Williams through a mutual friend, who had informed Washington of Williams' toughness and his willingness to fight members of larger, more established street gangs such as the L.A. Brims and the Chain Gang. According to Williams' account of the meeting, what struck him about Washington was that, besides being incredibly muscular, he and his cohort were dressed similar to Williams and his clique, wearing leather jackets with starched [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] jeans and suspenders. Washington proposed to Williams they form a [[confederation]] of the gangs under their influence in their respective areas along with another teenage gang leader called Mac Thomas in [[Compton, California|Compton]], to form a single large street gang. The proposal would see Williams' gangs adopt the Crip branding and would be allied with other Crip gangs outside of the West Side, but would retain ultimate leadership in the East Side. Williams accepted Washington's proposal, uniting the West Side gangs under his influence as the West Side Crips.\n\nThe Crips quickly established themselves as the largest street gang in Los Angeles, with increasing numbers and territory as their influence spread across low-income black neighborhoods. Washington, Williams and Thomas effectively held a [[monopoly]] on criminal activity in these areas, and became the dominant [[Boss (crime)|crime bosses]]. Street gangs that had resisted being absorbed into the Crips soon formed their own confederate alliance, the [[Bloods]], to protect their independence and their interests in the criminal market. The founding of the Bloods sparked an instant rivalry between the new large gangs that saw a surge in [[violent crime]] in Los Angeles, as neighboring Crip and Blood sets began using increasing violence to fight over territory and personal feuds. With the rise of [[News media in the United States|media]] coverage, which put these new violent gangs on the [[Newspaper|front page]], soon many disaffected black youths were running to join the Crips, many without ever being contacted by gang leaders. One story at the time stated:<ref name=lycos.com>{{cite web|title=Crips |publisher=Lycos.com |url=http://lycos.com/info/crips.html |accessdate=2008-01-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228085102/http://www.lycos.com/info/crips.html |archivedate=December 28, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|One of the gangs,  in the area is known as the Crips/ which started out at Washington High School as an [[extortion]] and [[terrorism|terror]] organization and spread to other schools where the gang members enrolled after being expelled from Washington, the police said.\n\nThe Police also said that this gang has been spreading \"like an octopus\" and now has members throughout South-Central Los Angeles, [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]], [[Gardena, California|Gardena]], Compton, [[Lynwood, California|Lynwood]], [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]], [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]], the Firestone [unincorporated] area and the [[San Fernando Valley]].\n\nGang members, to identify themselves, wear black gloves on their left hands and gold-colored earrings in their left ears, which are pierced, according to police. They sometimes carry [[Walking stick|canes]], which they use as [[weapon]]s.\n\nThere are two stories circulating on the derivation of the word Crips. One is that it stands for a cripple, because some of the founders were injured and had to carry canes for a time. The other is that the founders once wore [[Afro]]-style hairdos and their parents made them \"crip it.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}}}\n\nWithin a few years, much of the original Crip leadership were either imprisoned or dead. On February 23, 1973, Curtis \"Buddha\" Morrow, a close friend of Tookie Williams and a high-ranking Crip [[Mob enforcer|enforcer]], was shot to death in South Central following a petty argument. Mac Thomas was murdered under mysterious circumstances in the mid-1970s.\n\n==Robbery conviction==\nIn 1974, 21-year-old Washington was arrested for second-degree [[robbery]] and sentenced to five years' imprisonment at the [[Deuel Vocational Institution]] in [[Tracy, California|Tracy]], becoming the first Crip to be incarcerated there. Washington was unpopular among the prison population as he began to recruit young African-American inmates into the Crips, much to the disapproval of established black [[Prison gang|prison groups]] like the Black Muslims and the [[Black Guerrilla Family]]. According to a former inmate who was housed at Deuel with Washington, the Black Muslims and the Black Guerrilla Family were aware of the spread of the Crips in Los Angeles, and warned Washington that they would not tolerate the formation of Crips in the prison. Washington faced another problem while serving time at Deuel: as the Crips murdered rival gang members on the streets of Los Angeles, inmates at Deuel who were relatives of victims held Washington responsible for their deaths. Greg \"Batman\" Davis, a friend of Washington and an original Crips member, stated \"People in the prisons was losing their loved ones on the streets and because Raymond was the founder of the Crips, they blamed him for it. And since Raymond was the only Crip up there (at Deuel) at the time, they were trying to kill him.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn 1976, Washington paroled from prison and returned to Los Angeles. Reportedly, Washington was shocked to discover that the violent war between the Crips, Bloods, and [[Gangs in the United States|Hispanic gangs]] had escalated to the point that fighting using [[firearms]], as opposed to fist fighting, was now normal. Over the next few months, Washington became disillusioned with the Crips as the gang committed more violent and senseless crimes, with new recruits seeking to build their reputations.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Since Washington's imprisonment, the organization had totally broken down into loosely-affiliated [[Decentralization|decentralized]] sets that often fought each other, as the Crips' original leadership had disappeared. Tookie Williams, the last remaining original Crips leader, served as the ''[[de facto]]'' leader during Washington's imprisonment. Williams had been injured in a [[drive-by shooting]] in 1976, and developed a growing addiction to [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] that caused his authority to wane until he was arrested for four counts of [[homicide]] shortly before Washington was murdered. According to [[law enforcement]], former gang members and close friends, Washington had decided that the Crips needed to be brought back under one [[umbrella organization]] to stop infighting, and then to work towards a [[truce]] with the Bloods.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Upon realizing he no longer held influence in the gang, Washington started to distance himself from the Crips.\n\n==Death==\nAt around 10:00 p.m. on August 9, 1979, twenty-five-year-old Washington was murdered in a [[drive-by shooting]] on the corner of E 64th Street and S San Pedro Street in South Central Los Angeles, and was rushed to [[Morningside Hospital (California)|Morningside Hospital]] where he died while undergoing emergency surgery.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} No suspects have been arrested, and Washington's murder remains unsolved. It was reported that Washington was hanging out on the corner when a car pulled up and the unidentified occupants called him over to the car. Washington's associates, as well as the police, were aware he would never walk up to cars of people that he did not know, and most likely knew the occupants of the vehicle as he told an acquaintance that he knew them. Washington engaged in a brief conversation with them before the occupant in the passenger seat drew a [[sawed-off shotgun]] and shot him in the [[abdomen]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of unsolved murders]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Washington, Raymond}}\n[[Category:1953 births]]\n[[Category:1979 deaths]]\n[[Category:1979 murders in the United States]]\n[[Category:American criminals]]\n[[Category:Gang members]]\n[[Category:Crips]]\n[[Category:Criminals of Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:History of Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Murdered African-American people]]\n[[Category:People murdered by African-American organized crime]]\n[[Category:Racism in the United States]]\n[[Category:Unsolved murders in the United States]]\n[[Category:People murdered in California]]\n[[Category:Deaths by firearm in California]]\n[[Category:American murder victims]]\n[[Category:John C.

According to [[law enforcement]], former gang members and close friends, Washington had decided that the Crips needed to be brought back under one [[umbrella organization]] to stop infighting, and then to work towards a [[truce]] with the Bloods.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Upon realizing he no longer held influence in the gang, Washington started to distance himself from the Crips.\n\n==Death==\nAt around 10:00 p.m. on August 9, 1979, twenty-five-year-old Washington was murdered in a [[drive-by shooting]] on the corner of E 64th Street and S San Pedro Street in South Central Los Angeles, and was rushed to [[Morningside Hospital (California)|Morningside Hospital]] where he died while undergoing emergency surgery.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} No suspects have been arrested, and Washington's murder remains unsolved. It was reported that Washington was hanging out on the corner when a car pulled up and the unidentified occupants called him over to the car. Washington's associates, as well as the police, were aware he would never walk up to cars of people that he did not know, and most likely knew the occupants of the vehicle as he told an acquaintance that he knew them. Washington engaged in a brief conversation with them before the occupant in the passenger seat drew a [[sawed-off shotgun]] and shot him in the [[abdomen]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of unsolved murders]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Washington, Raymond}}\n[[Category:1953 births]]\n[[Category:1979 deaths]]\n[[Category:1979 murders in the United States]]\n[[Category:American criminals]]\n[[Category:Gang members]]\n[[Category:Crips]]\n[[Category:Criminals of Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:History of Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Murdered African-American people]]\n[[Category:People murdered by African-American organized crime]]\n[[Category:Racism in the United States]]\n[[Category:Unsolved murders in the United States]]\n[[Category:People murdered in California]]\n[[Category:Deaths by firearm in California]]\n[[Category:American murder victims]]\n[[Category:John C.

This has historically been remarkably popular on consoles, which until the 2000s did not have access to the Internet or any other network and is less common today with modern support for online console-to-console multiplayer support.<ref name=MineMineMine>{{Cite web \n   |url=https://thegamesedge.com/1629/split-screen-gaming-what-happened\n   |title=Split-Screen Gaming: What Happened? \n   |author=Simon Eriksson |date=October 19, 2018 \n   |website=The Games' Edge  \n   |access-date=November 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web \n|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/2015/09/09/split-screen-gaming-dead\n|title=Why Split-Screen Gaming is Dying (And Why We Should Mourn It) \n|date=September 9, 2015\n |website=Highsnobiety  |access-date=November 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSplit screen is useful for people who want to play with other players, but with only one console.\nIn recent years, split screen hasn't been used very often because the new frontier of video games is playing with other players [[Multiplayer online game|online]], without screen sharing.<ref name=MineMineMine/>\n\n== History of Split-Screen Gaming ==\nSplit screen gaming is said to have originated in the mid 1980's, there are no notable games that can be found to have it until 1991 when [[Lemmings (video game)|Lemming]] was released for [[Commodore International|Commodore]]'s [[Amiga]]. It was the first Amiga game to support two simultaneous players with a split screen on the same computer while players used separate mice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-split-screen-mouse-controlled-game-on-the-commodore-amiga?fb_comment_id=273445709445985_296162570507632|title=First split-screen, mouse-controlled game on the Commodore Amiga|website=Guinness World Records|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> However split screen gaming wasn't popularized until [[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]] in 1997, allowing players to take place in a four person deathmatch on the same screen. The game was said to begin a split screen craze.

The [[Family Compact]] is the first identifiable Canadian Establishment in Anglophone Canada. In Francophone Canada, the local leaders of the Catholic Church also played a major role.\n\nThe journalist [[Peter C. Newman]] defined the modern Canadian Establishment in his 1975 book ''[[The Canadian Establishment]]''. It catalogued the richest individuals and families living in Canada at the time. All of the specific people he identified were prominent business leaders, especially in the media and in public transit. Newman reports that several of these old families have maintained their importance into the twenty-first century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAccording to Anglo-American journalist Peter Brimelow, Newman's establishment was overshadowed by a new class. His book ''The Patriot Game'' \"makes a swinging attack on the political, bureaucratic, and academic establishment whose entire well-being rests on the promotion of Canadian nationalism. [He] identifies the federal Liberal party as the selfish and thoughtless inventor of this modern activity of creating a Canadian identity, he argues that it is now a pervasive disease throughout Canada's national political and cultural elite.\"<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/573245/summary|title=The Patriot Game: National Dreams & Political Realities by Peter Brimelow (review)|first=Gordon|last=Stewart|date=4 June 1988|publisher=|journal=The Canadian Historical Review|volume=69|issue=2|pages=273\u2013274|via=Project MUSE}}</ref>\n\n==Ireland==\nThe term \"[[Official Ireland]]\" is commonly used in the [[Republic of Ireland]] to denote the media, cultural and religious establishment.<ref> Elaine Byrne, \"OFFICIAL IRELAND\" [http://www.macgillsummerschool.com/official-ireland/ ''McGill Summer School 2019''.]</ref>\n\n== Hong Kong==\nThe term is also used in [[politics of Hong Kong]], where political parties, community groups, chambers of commerce, trade unions and individuals who are cooperative with and loyal to the [[Communist Party of China]] and the post-[[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|handover]] [[Hong Kong Government]] are labelled (most often self-labelled) \"[[Pro-Beijing camp (Hong Kong)|pro-Beijing]]\" or \"[[Pro-Beijing camp (Macau)|pro-establishment]]\".

Players collect many small power-ups to build their weapon's power; they can then unleash a large beam attack that drains said power level back to zero. Bosses can also collect these power-ups and use similar beam attacks. When a player's beam collides with a that of a boss, it culminates in a spectacular reaction, the more powerful attack pushing the weaker one aside.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ARC Metal Black.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot featuring Apartheid, the first boss of the game, showcasing an example of 'beam-dueling' in ''Metal Black''. The blue beam on the left is the player's beam.]]\nThe gameplay of Metal Black is unique in that there are no alternate weapons or bombs: the player's only weapon power-ups are the innumerable Newalone molecules scattered by Nemesis. Collecting Newalone increases the player's beam level, which serves as the player's only defense. The more Newalone the player picks up, the stronger their standard beam becomes.\n\nWhen reaching mid-level or maximum level on the ship's Beam Level gauge, the player can then unleash a large beam capable of destroying various enemies as well as causing a lightning effect that briefly shocks the screen and consequentially destroys enemies behind and around the Black Fly.<ref name=\"shmups\">{{cite web|url=http://shmups.classicgaming.gamespy.com/reviews/metalblack/index.html/|title=METAL BLACK|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016071508/http://shmups.classicgaming.gamespy.com/reviews/metalblack/index.html|archivedate=2007-10-16}}</ref>\n\nHowever, certain enemies also have beam gauges of their own, most notably the end-level bosses who in turn collect as much Newalone as they can to unleash their own beam weapon. When the player and the boss' beam weapons fire simultaneously, one beam overpowers the other depending on how high each gauge is, initiating a 'Beam Duel.' The player must mash the beam button rapidly in order to keep the opposing beam blast at bay, which accumulates into a large ball of destructive matter. The blast changes in color depending on which wielder's beam is stronger.<ref name=\"shmups\"/>\n\nThe game has six levels. After the first and fourth, a Bonus Stage occurs to indicate the player's advancement into space (the first bonus stage occurs when the player leaves Earth's atmosphere and the second occurs as they enter a [[worm hole]] as a shortcut to Jupiter). Each Bonus stage has the player encircle a group of crustacean-shaped enemies. The player has to lock on to the moving targets in order to launch cluster missiles at them for extra points. Each bonus stage is timed so as to challenge the player in seeking and destroying before the timer runs out.\n\n== Story ==\nThe year is 2042: A [[companion star]] of the planet [[Jupiter]] appears a few [[Astronomical unit]]s away from the planet and propels the asteroids along Jupiter's orbit towards the Earth, creating a wave of meteorites. As the Earthlings struggle to survive, extraterrestrial [[cybernetic]] invaders from beyond the distant star use the meteorites as cover to invade Earth with little resistance, intending to plunder Earth for inorganic materials needed to sustain their forms. Both the aliens and the star they came from are quickly named 'Nemesis.'\n\nWhat resistance the aliens face from Earth's combined international defense forces is quickly obliterated by the aliens' powerful beam weapons. Earth's scientists study the molecules that power the alien weaponry, which have started to litter the Earth, and the molecule is given the name 'Newalone.' With Newalone in their hands, scientists quickly begin Project Metal Black, focused on developing at least twenty-thousand human spacecraft capable of wielding the same beam-weaponry as the aliens. The spacecraft is known as the CF-345 Black Fly, named for its method of Newalone energy use.\n\nHowever, ten years after the invasion, Earth's remaining diplomats pass a treaty with the Nemesis forces outlining a peaceful surrender, which promises to keep all of Earth's remaining forces from attacking: This applies to Project Metal Black, preventing the Black Fly spacecraft's use. With the planet's population thinning and natural resources depleting, a rogue pilot commandeers one of the Black Fly craft in violation of the treaty, intending to strike back against Nemesis and save what remains of humanity.\n\nThe events within the game itself unfold over six stages as the Black Fly pilot travels to Jupiter, confronting powerful Nemesis ships along the way. In the final two stages, the pilot breaches Nemesis itself, earning a crucial chance to defeat the invading forces once and for all. From this point, there are two possible endings: If the player gets a Game Over on the final stage, the pilot's death incites a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] of the global government, and 20,000 Black Fly craft are dispatched to Nemesis's apparent origin point. Otherwise, the pilot confronts the leader of Nemesis in a rapidly-shifting dimension, the battle apparently culminating with the Earth being split in two; it is left unclear as to whether the Earth's destruction and the events of the game as a whole ever actually occurred.\n\n== Development and release ==\n''Metal Black'' was developed under the working title \"Project [[Gun Frontier (video game)|Gun Frontier]] 2\", and shares many of the staff behind ''[[Gun Frontier (video game)|Gun Frontier]]'', including its game designer Takatsuna Senba. However, its actual connection to ''Gun Frontier'' is faint at best.

Players collect many small power-ups to build their weapon's power; they can then unleash a large beam attack that drains said power level back to zero. Bosses can also collect these power-ups and use similar beam attacks. When a player's beam collides with a that of a boss, it culminates in a spectacular reaction, the more powerful attack pushing the weaker one aside.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ARC Metal Black.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot featuring Apartheid, the first boss of the game, showcasing an example of 'beam-dueling' in ''Metal Black''. The blue beam on the left is the player's beam.]]\nThe gameplay of Metal Black is unique in that there are no alternate weapons or bombs: the player's only weapon power-ups are the innumerable Newalone molecules scattered by Nemesis. Collecting Newalone increases the player's beam level, which serves as the player's only defense. The more Newalone the player picks up, the stronger their standard beam becomes.\n\nWhen reaching mid-level or maximum level on the ship's Beam Level gauge, the player can then unleash a large beam capable of destroying various enemies as well as causing a lightning effect that briefly shocks the screen and consequentially destroys enemies behind and around the Black Fly.<ref name=\"shmups\">{{cite web|url=http://shmups.classicgaming.gamespy.com/reviews/metalblack/index.html/|title=METAL BLACK|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016071508/http://shmups.classicgaming.gamespy.com/reviews/metalblack/index.html|archivedate=2007-10-16}}</ref>\n\nHowever, certain enemies also have beam gauges of their own, most notably the end-level bosses who in turn collect as much Newalone as they can to unleash their own beam weapon. When the player and the boss' beam weapons fire simultaneously, one beam overpowers the other depending on how high each gauge is, initiating a 'Beam Duel.' The player must mash the beam button rapidly in order to keep the opposing beam blast at bay, which accumulates into a large ball of destructive matter. The blast changes in color depending on which wielder's beam is stronger.<ref name=\"shmups\"/>\n\nThe game has six levels. After the first and fourth, a Bonus Stage occurs to indicate the player's advancement into space (the first bonus stage occurs when the player leaves Earth's atmosphere and the second occurs as they enter a [[worm hole]] as a shortcut to Jupiter). Each Bonus stage has the player encircle a group of crustacean-shaped enemies. The player has to lock on to the moving targets in order to launch cluster missiles at them for extra points. Each bonus stage is timed so as to challenge the player in seeking and destroying before the timer runs out.\n\n== Story ==\nThe year is 2042: A [[companion star]] of the planet [[Jupiter]] appears a few [[Astronomical unit]]s away from the planet and propels the asteroids along Jupiter's orbit towards the Earth, creating a wave of meteorites. As the Earthlings struggle to survive, extraterrestrial [[cybernetic]] invaders from beyond the distant star use the meteorites as cover to invade Earth with little resistance, intending to plunder Earth for inorganic materials needed to sustain their forms. Both the aliens and the star they came from are quickly named 'Nemesis.'\n\nWhat resistance the aliens face from Earth's combined international defense forces is quickly obliterated by the aliens' powerful beam weapons. Earth's scientists study the molecules that power the alien weaponry, which have started to litter the Earth, and the molecule is given the name 'Newalone.' With Newalone in their hands, scientists quickly begin Project Metal Black, focused on developing at least twenty-thousand human spacecraft capable of wielding the same beam-weaponry as the aliens. The spacecraft is known as the CF-345 Black Fly, named for its method of Newalone energy use.\n\nHowever, ten years after the invasion, Earth's remaining diplomats pass a treaty with the Nemesis forces outlining a peaceful surrender, which promises to keep all of Earth's remaining forces from attacking: This applies to Project Metal Black, preventing the Black Fly spacecraft's use. With the planet's population thinning and natural resources depleting, a rogue pilot commandeers one of the Black Fly craft in violation of the treaty, intending to strike back against Nemesis and save what remains of humanity.\n\nThe events within the game itself unfold over six stages as the Black Fly pilot travels to Jupiter, confronting powerful Nemesis ships along the way. In the final two stages, the pilot breaches Nemesis itself, earning a crucial chance to defeat the invading forces once and for all. From this point, there are two possible endings: If the player gets a Game Over on the final stage, the pilot's death incites a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] of the global government, and 20,000 Black Fly craft are dispatched to Nemesis's apparent origin point. Otherwise, the pilot confronts the leader of Nemesis in a rapidly-shifting dimension, the battle apparently culminating with the Earth being split in two; it is left unclear as to whether the Earth's destruction and the events of the game as a whole ever actually occurred.\n\n== Development and release ==\n''Metal Black'' was developed under the working title \"Project [[Gun Frontier (video game)|Gun Frontier]] 2\", and shares many of the staff behind ''[[Gun Frontier (video game)|Gun Frontier]]'', including its game designer Takatsuna Senba. However, its actual connection to ''Gun Frontier'' is faint at best. The game has ties to the other Taito shoot-em-up ''[[Darius (series)|Darius]]'' series, as it features a select few marine-themed enemies from it (e.g. [[Ocean sunfish|sunfish]]-shaped ships, Feeder's similarity to a giant [[rattail]], [[diatom]]like enemies in the fourth stage, the giant [[Opabinia]] that supports and powers Daio-to-Gishiin at the end of the third stage, and the aircraft carrier-bearing [[hermit crab]] in the middle of the first stage).\n\n''Metal Black'' was released in arcades in September 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?a=page_h_title&title_id=000000025311|title=\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af [\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9] / \u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u901a.com|website=www.famitsu.com|access-date=2018-08-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180803194430/https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?a=page_h_title&title_id=000000025311|archive-date=August 3, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It was initially ported in 1996 to the [[Sega Saturn]] by VING under the budget line \"Arcade Gears\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?a=page_h_title&title_id=14849|title=\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af [\u30bb\u30ac\u30b5\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3] / \u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u901a.com|website=www.famitsu.com|access-date=2018-08-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180804013839/https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?a=page_h_title&title_id=14849|archive-date=August 4, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2006, it was included in the compilation ''[[Taito Legends 2]]'' for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], and [[PlayStation 2]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} In 2012, a compilation album containing the soundtrack to the game as well as the soundtracks for ''[[Gun Frontier (video game)|Gun Frontier]]'' and ''[[Dino Rex]]'' was released.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.famitsu.com/news/201212/19026262.html|title=\"\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b9\u30a3\u30fc\u30d7\"\u306e12\u6708\u65b0\u8b5c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30c3\u30afCD\uff06\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u60c5\u5831|date=December 19, 2012|work=Famitsu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831133610/https://www.famitsu.com/news/201212/19026262.html|archive-date=August 31, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n|rev1      = ''[[AllGame]]''\n|rev1Score = (Arcade) {{Rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"AGACmb\">{{cite web|last=Knight|first=Kyle|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=10514&tab=review|title=Metal Black (Arcade) - Review|website=[[AllGame]]|accessdate=2019-04-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116022402/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=10514&tab=review|archivedate=2014-11-16|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev2      = ''[[Famitsu]]''\n|rev2Score = (Saturn) 20 / 40<ref name=\"WFTSATmb\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=14849|title=\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af [\u30bb\u30ac\u30b5\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3] / \u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u901a.com|magazine=[[Famitsu]]|issue=389|publisher=[[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]]|date=May 31, 1996|page=30|access-date=2019-04-10|lang=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526073834/http://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=14849|archive-date=May 26, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n|rev3      = ''Fun Generation''\n|rev3Score = (Saturn) 4 / 10<ref name=\"FGSATmb\">{{cite magazine|last1=Binzenh\u00f6fer|first1=Andreas|last2=Hellert|first2=Stefan|title=Spiele Tests - Metal Black (Saturn)|magazine=Fun Generation|issue=7|publisher=[[:de:CyPress|CyPress]]|date=August 1996|page=79|lang=de}}</ref>\n|rev4      = ''[[:fr:Joypad (magazine)|Joypad]]''\n|rev4Score = (Saturn) 1 / 5<ref name=\"JSATmb\">{{cite magazine|last=Pr\u00e9zeau|first=Olivier|title=Japon Test - Zapping - Saturn - Metal Black|magazine=[[:fr:Joypad (magazine)|Joypad]]|issue=55|publisher=[[:fr:Yellow Media|Yellow Media]]|date=August 1996|page=72|lang=fr}}</ref>\n|rev5      = ''neXt Level''\n|rev5Score = (Saturn) 65%<ref name=\"XLSATmb\">{{cite magazine|last=Hartwig|first=K.-D.|title=Test - Saturn - Metal Black|magazine=neXt Level|issue=4|publisher=X-plain Verlag GmbH|date=August 1996|page=64|lang=de}}</ref>\n|rev6      = ''[[:ja:\u30b2\u30fc\u30de\u30ac#SEGA SATURN MAGAZINE|Sega Saturn Magazine]] (JP)''\n|rev6Score = (Saturn) 7.33 / 10<ref name=\"SSMjpSATmb\">{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=Sega Saturn Soft Review - New Release Title Check! - \u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af|magazine=[[:ja:\u30b2\u30fc\u30de\u30ac#SEGA SATURN MAGAZINE|Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=23|publisher=[[SB Creative|SoftBank Creative]]|date=June 14, 1996|page=229|lang=ja}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''[[Famitsu]]'' gave the Sega Saturn version a score of 20 out of 40.<ref name=\"WFTSATmb\"/>\n\n=== Legacy ===\nA similar \"beam duel\" combat system was featured in Taito's ''[[G-Darius]]''.
