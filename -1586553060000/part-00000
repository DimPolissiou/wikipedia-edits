Its name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2}} ''Seirios'' \"glowing\" or \"scorching\". With a visual [[apparent magnitude]] of \u22121.46, Sirius is almost twice as bright as [[Canopus]], the next brightest star. Sirius is a [[binary star]]  consisting of a [[main sequence|main-sequence]] [[star]] of [[spectral type]] A0 or A1, termed Sirius A, and a faint [[white dwarf]] companion of spectral type DA2, termed Sirius B. The distance between the two varies between 8.2 and 31.5 [[astronomical unit]]s as they orbit every 50 years.<ref name=\"Schaaf2008\" />\n\nSirius appears bright because of its intrinsic [[luminosity]] and its proximity to the [[Solar System]]. At a distance of {{convert|2.64|pc|ly|lk=on}}, the Sirius system is one of Earth's [[List of nearest stars|nearest neighbours]]. Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System, so it will slightly increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years. After that time, its distance will begin to increase, and it will become fainter, but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth's night sky for the next 210,000 years.<ref>''Sky and Telescope'', April 1998 (p60), based on computations from [[Hipparcos]] data.</ref>\n\nSirius A is about twice as massive as the Sun ({{Solar mass|link=y}}) and has an [[Absolute magnitude|absolute visual magnitude]] of +1.42. It is 25 times more luminous than the Sun<ref name=\"Liebert2005\" /> but has a significantly lower luminosity than other bright stars such as Canopus or [[Rigel]]. The system is between 200 and {{Nowrap|300 million}} years old.<ref name=\"Liebert2005\" /> It was originally composed of two bright bluish stars. The more massive of these, Sirius B, consumed its resources and became a [[red giant]] before shedding its outer layers and collapsing into its current state as a white dwarf around {{Nowrap|120 million}} years ago.<ref name=\"Liebert2005\" />\n\nSirius is known colloquially as the \"'''Dog Star'''\", reflecting its prominence in its [[constellation]], [[Canis Major]] (the Greater Dog).<ref name=\"Allen1899\" /> The [[heliacal rising]] of Sirius marked the flooding of the [[Nile]] in [[Ancient Egypt]] and the \"[[dog days]]\" of summer for the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], while to the [[Polynesian people|Polynesians]], mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, the star marked winter and was an important reference for their navigation around the Pacific Ocean.\n\n[[File:Sirius.jpg|thumb|Sirius in space]]\n\n== Observational history ==\n{{hiero|Sirius<br/>''{{lang|egy|[[wikt:spdt|Spdt]]}}''|<hiero>X1:N14-M44</hiero>|align=left}}\n\nThe brightest star in the night sky, Sirius is recorded in some of the earliest astronomical records. Its displacement from the [[ecliptic]] causes its heliacal rising to be remarkably regular compared to other stars, with a period of almost exactly 365.25 days holding it constant relative to the [[solar year]]. This rising occurs at [[Cairo]] on 19{{nbsp}}July ([[Julian calendar|Julian]]), placing it just prior to the onset of the [[flooding of the Nile|annual flooding]] of the Nile during antiquity.<ref name=\"Wendorf2001\"/> Owing to the flood's own irregularity, the extreme precision of the star's return made it important to the ancient Egyptians,<ref name=\"Wendorf2001\" /> who worshipped it as the goddess [[Sopdet]] ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:spdt|Spdt]]}}, \"Triangle\";{{efn|Compare the meaning of the Egyptian name with Sirius's completion of the [[Winter Triangle]] [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]], joining the other two brightest stars of the northern winter sky, [[Betelgeuse]] and [[Procyon]].}} {{lang-grc-gre|{{linktext|\u03a3\u1ff6\u03b8\u03b9\u03c2}}}}, ''S\u014d\u0302this''), guarantor of the fertility of their land.{{efn|As Sirius is visible together with the constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], the Egyptians worshipped Orion as the god [[Sah (god)|Sah]], the husband of Sopdet, with whom she had a son, the sky god [[Sopdu]]. The goddess Sopdet was later [[syncretization|syncretized]] with the goddess [[Isis]], Sah was linked with [[Osiris]], and Sopdu was linked with [[Horus]]. The joining of Sopdet with Isis would allow [[Plutarch]] to state that \"The soul of Isis is called Dog by the Greeks\", meaning Sirius worshipped as Isis-Sopdet by Egyptians was named the Dog by the Greeks and Romans. The 70-day period of the absence of Sirius from the sky was understood as the passing of Sopdet-Isis and Sah-Osiris through the [[duat|Egyptian underworld]].<ref name=\"Holberg2007-4-5\" />}} The [[Egyptian civil calendar]] was apparently initiated to have its New Year \"[[Mesori]]\" coincide with the appearance of Sirius, although its lack of [[leap year]]s meant that this congruence only held for four years until its date began to wander backwards through the months. The Egyptians continued to note the times of Sirius's annual return, which may have led them to the discovery of the 1460-year [[Sothic cycle]] and influenced the development of the Julian and [[Alexandrian calendar]]s.\n\nThe ancient Greeks observed that the appearance of Sirius heralded the hot and dry summer and feared that it caused plants to wilt, men to weaken, and women to become aroused.<ref name=\"Holberg2007-19\" /> Due to its brightness, Sirius would have been seen to [[Scintillation (astronomy)|twinkle]] more in the unsettled weather conditions of early summer. To Greek observers, this signified emanations that caused its malignant influence. Anyone suffering its effects was said to be \"star-struck\" ({{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}}, ''astrob\u00f3l\u0113tos''). It was described as \"burning\" or \"flaming\" in literature.<ref name=\"Holberg2007-20\" /> The season following the star's reappearance came to be known as the \"dog days\".<ref name=\"Holberg2007-16-17\" /> The inhabitants of the island of [[Kea (island)|Ceos]] in the [[Aegean Sea]] would offer sacrifices to Sirius and [[Zeus]] to bring cooling breezes and would await the reappearance of the star in summer. If it rose clear, it would portend good fortune; if it was misty or faint then it foretold (or emanated) pestilence. Coins retrieved from the island from the 3rd century BC feature dogs or stars with emanating rays, highlighting Sirius's importance.<ref name=\"Holberg2007-20\" /> The Romans celebrated the heliacal setting of Sirius around April 25, sacrificing a dog, along with incense, wine, and a sheep, to the goddess [[Robigo]] so that the star's emanations would not cause [[Rust (fungus)|wheat rust]] on wheat crops that year.<ref name=\"Ovid\" />\n\n[[Ptolemy]] of Alexandria mapped the stars in Books&nbsp;VII and VIII of his ''[[Almagest]]'', in which he used Sirius as the location for the globe's central meridian. He depicted it as one of six red-coloured stars (see the [[#Colour controversy|Colour controversy]] section below). The other five are class M and K stars, such as [[Arcturus]] and [[Betelgeuse]].<ref name=\"Holberg2007-32\" />\n\nBright stars were important to the ancient Polynesians for navigation of the Pacific Ocean. They also served as latitude markers; the declination of Sirius matches the latitude of the archipelago of [[Fiji]] at 17\u00b0S and thus passes directly over the islands each night.<ref name=\"Holberg2007-25\" /> Sirius served as the body of a \"Great Bird\" constellation called ''Manu'', with Canopus as the southern wingtip and [[Procyon]] the northern wingtip, which divided the Polynesian night sky into two hemispheres.<ref name=\"Holberg2007-25-26\" /> Just as the appearance of Sirius in the morning sky marked summer in Greece, it marked the onset of winter for the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], whose name ''Takurua'' described both the star and the season. Its culmination at the [[winter solstice]] was marked by celebration in [[Hawaii]], where it was known as ''Ka'ulua'', \"Queen of Heaven\". Many other Polynesian names have been recorded, including ''Tau-ua'' in the [[Marquesas Islands]], ''Rehua'' in New Zealand, and ''Ta'urua-fau-papa'' \"Festivity of original high chiefs\" and ''Ta'urua-e-hiti-i-te-tara-te-feiai'' \"Festivity who rises with prayers and religious ceremonies\" in Tahiti.<ref name=henry1907>{{cite journal|last=Henry|first=Teuira |authorlink=Teuira Henry|date=1907|title=Tahitian Astronomy: Birth of Heavenly Bodies|journal=The Journal of the Polynesian Society |volume=16|issue=2|pages=101\u201304|jstor=20700813}}</ref> The [[Hawaiian people]] had many names for Sirius, including ''Aa'' (\"glowing\"),{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=198}} ''Hoku-kauopae'',{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=280}} ''Kau-ano-meha'' (also ''Kaulanomeha''), \"Standing-alone-and-sacred\",{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=280}}{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=218}} ''Hiki-kauelia'' or ''Hiki-kauilia'' (the navigational name), ''Hiki-kau-lono-meha'' (\"star of solitary Lono\", the astrological name),{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=207}} ''Kaulua'' (also ''Kaulua-ihai-mohai'', \"flower of the heavens\"),{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=219}} ''Hiki-kauelia'', ''Hoku-hoo-kele-waa'' (\"star which causes the canoe to sail\", a marine navigation name),{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=209}} and ''Kaulua-lena'' (\"yellow star\").{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=219}} The people of the [[Society Islands]] called Sirius variously ''Taurua-fau-papa'', ''Taurua-nui-te-amo-aha'', and ''Taurua-e-hiti-i-tara-te-feiai''.

Since 1894, some apparent orbital irregularities in the Sirius system have been observed, suggesting a third very small companion star, but this has never been confirmed. The best fit to the data indicates a six-year orbit around Sirius A and a mass of {{Solar mass|0.06}}. This star would be five to ten magnitudes fainter than the white dwarf Sirius&nbsp;B, which would make it difficult to observe.<ref name=\"Benest1995\" /> Observations published in 2008 were unable to detect either a third star or a planet. An apparent \"third star\" observed in the 1920s is now believed to be a background object.<ref name=\"BonnetBidaud2008\" />\n\nIn 1915, [[Walter Sydney Adams]], using a 60-inch (1.5&nbsp;m) reflector at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]], observed the [[stellar spectrum|spectrum]] of Sirius B and determined that it was a faint whitish star.<ref name=\"Adams1915\" /> This led astronomers to conclude that it was a white dwarf, the second to be discovered.<ref name=\"Holberg2005\" /> The diameter of Sirius A was first measured by [[Robert Hanbury Brown]] and [[Richard Q. Twiss]] in 1959 at [[Jodrell Bank]] using their stellar [[intensity interferometer]].<ref name=\"Hanbury1958\" /> In 2005, using the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], astronomers determined that Sirius B has nearly the diameter of the Earth, {{convert|12000|km|mi}}, with a mass 102% of the Sun's.<ref name=\"Barstow2005\" />\n\n=== Colour controversy ===\nAround the year 150 CE, the Greek astronomer of the Roman period, [[Claudius Ptolemy]], described Sirius as reddish, along with five other stars, [[Betelgeuse]], [[Antares]], [[Aldebaran]], [[Arcturus]] and [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]], all of which are of orange or red hue.<ref name=\"Holberg2007-157\" /> The discrepancy was first noted by amateur astronomer [[Thomas Barker (meteorologist)|Thomas Barker]], squire of [[Lyndon, Rutland|Lyndon Hall]] in [[Rutland]], who prepared a paper and spoke at a meeting of the [[Royal Society]] in London in 1760.<ref name=\"Ceragioli1995\" /> The existence of other stars changing in brightness gave credibility to the idea that some may change in colour too; [[Sir John Herschel]] noted this in 1839, possibly influenced by witnessing [[Eta Carinae]] two years earlier.<ref name=\"Holberg2007-158\" /> [[Thomas Jefferson Jackson See]] resurrected discussion on red Sirius with the publication of several papers in 1892, and a final summary in 1926.<ref name=\"Holberg2007-161\" /> He cited not only Ptolemy but also the poet [[Aratus]], the orator [[Cicero]], and general [[Germanicus]] as calling the star red, though acknowledging that none of the latter three authors were astronomers, the last two merely translating Aratus's poem ''Phaenomena''.<ref name=\"Holberg2007-162\" /> [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] had described Sirius as being of a deeper red than [[Mars]].<ref name=\"Whittet1999\" /> Not all ancient observers saw Sirius as red. The 1st-century poet [[Marcus Manilius]] described it as \"sea-blue\", as did the 4th century [[Avienus]].<ref name=\"Holberg2007-163\" /> It was the standard white star in ancient China, and multiple records from the 2nd century BCE up to the 7th century CE all describe Sirius as white.<ref name=\"Jiang1992\" /><ref name=\"Jiang1993\" />\n\nIn 1985, German astronomers Wolfhard Schlosser and Werner Bergmann published an account of an 8th-century [[Lombardy|Lombardic]] manuscript, which contains ''De cursu stellarum ratio'' by St. [[Gregory of Tours]]. The Latin text taught readers how to determine the times of nighttime prayers from positions of the stars, and Sirius is described within as ''rubeola''&nbsp;\u2013 \"reddish\". The authors proposed this was further evidence Sirius B had been a red giant at the time.<ref name=\"Schlosser1985\" /> Other scholars replied that it was likely St. Gregory had been referring to [[Arcturus]].<ref name=\"McCluskey1987\" /><ref name=\"VanGent1987\" />\n\nThe possibility that [[stellar evolution]] of either Sirius A or Sirius B could be responsible for this discrepancy has been rejected by astronomers on the grounds that the timescale of thousands of years is much too short and that there is no sign of the nebulosity in the system that would be expected had such a change taken place.<ref name=\"Whittet1999\" /> An interaction with a third star, to date undiscovered, has also been proposed as a possibility for a red appearance.<ref name=\"Kuchner2000\" /> Alternative explanations are either that the description as red is a poetic metaphor for ill fortune, or that the dramatic [[scintillation (astronomy)|scintillations]] of the star when rising left the viewer with the impression that it was red. To the naked eye, it often appears to be flashing with red, white, and blue hues when near the horizon.<ref name=\"Whittet1999\" />\n\n== Observation ==\n[[File:Hubble heic0206j.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[Sirius (star)|Sirius]] (''bottom'') and the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] (''right'').

From the [[Southern Hemisphere]] in early July, Sirius can be seen in both the evening where it sets after the [[Sun]] and in the morning where it rises before the Sun.<ref name=\"Stargazers2000\" />\n\nSirius, along with [[Procyon]] and [[Betelgeuse]], forms one of the three [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of the [[Winter Triangle]] to observers in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].<ref name=\"Darling\" />\n\nDue to [[precession]] (and slight [[proper motion]]), Sirius will move further south in the future. Starting around the year 9000, Sirius will no longer be visible from northern and central Europe, and in 14,000 its declination will be \u221267\u00b0 and thus it will be circumpolar throughout [[South Africa]] and in most parts of Australia.\n\nSirius can be observed in [[daylight]] with the naked eye under the right conditions. Ideally, the sky should be very clear, with the observer at a high altitude, the star passing overhead, and the Sun low on the horizon.<ref name=\"Henshaw1984\" /> These observing conditions are more easily met in the Southern Hemisphere, due to the southerly declination of Sirius.\n\nThe orbital motion of the Sirius binary system brings the two stars to a minimum angular separation of 3&nbsp;[[arcsecond]]s and a maximum of 11&nbsp;arcseconds. At the closest approach, it is an observational challenge to distinguish the white dwarf from its more luminous companion, requiring a telescope with at least 300&nbsp;mm (12&nbsp;in) aperture and excellent seeing conditions. A [[periastron]] occurred in 1994{{efn|Two full 50.09-year orbits following the periastron epoch of 1894.13 gives a date of 1994.31.}} and the pair have since been moving apart, making them easier to separate with a telescope.<ref name=\"Mullaney2008\" />\n\nAt a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6&nbsp;ly), the Sirius system contains two of the eight [[List of nearest stars|nearest stars]] to the Sun, and it is the fifth closest stellar system to the Sun.<ref name=\"Todd2006\" /> This proximity is the main reason for its brightness, as with other near stars such as [[Alpha Centauri]] and in contrast to distant, highly luminous supergiants such as Canopus, [[Rigel]] or Betelgeuse.<ref name=\"RASNZ\" /> It is still around 25 times more luminous than the Sun.<ref name=\"Liebert2005\" /> The closest large neighbouring star to Sirius is Procyon, 1.61 parsecs (5.24&nbsp;ly) away.<ref name=\"SolStation\" /> The ''[[Voyager 2]]'' spacecraft, launched in 1977 to study the four [[giant planet]]s in the Solar System, is expected to pass within {{convert|4.3|ly|pc}} of Sirius in approximately 296,000 years.<ref name=\"Angrum2005\" />\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Stellar system ==\n[[File:Orbit Sirius B arcsec.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The orbit of Sirius B around A as seen from Earth (slanted ellipse).

The [[stellar rotation|projected rotational velocity]] is a relatively low 16&nbsp;km/s,<ref name=\"Royer2002\" /> which does not produce any significant flattening of its disk.<ref name=\"Kervella2003\" /> This is at marked variance with the similar-sized [[Vega]], which rotates at a much faster 274&nbsp;km/s and bulges prominently around its equator.<ref name=\"Aufdenberg2006\" /> A weak [[magnetic field]] has been detected on the surface of Sirius A.<ref name=petit2011 />\n\nStellar models suggest that the star formed during the collapsing of a [[molecular cloud]] and that, after {{Nowrap|10 million}} years, its internal energy generation was derived entirely from nuclear reactions. The core became [[convection zone|convective]] and used the [[CNO cycle]] for energy generation.<ref name=\"Kervella2003\" /> It is predicted that Sirius A will have completely exhausted the store of hydrogen at its core within a billion (10<sup>9</sup>) years of its formation. At this point, it will pass through a [[red giant]] stage, then settle down to become a white dwarf.\n\nSirius A is classed as an [[Am star]] because the spectrum shows deep metallic [[absorption line]]s,<ref name=auriere2010 /> indicating an enhancement in elements heavier than helium, such as iron.<ref name=\"SolStation\" /><ref name=\"Kervella2003\" /> The spectral type has been reported as A0mA1 Va, which indicates that it would be classified as A1 from hydrogen and helium lines, but A0 from the metallic lines that cause it to be grouped with the Am stars.<ref name=nstars/> When compared to the Sun, the proportion of iron in the atmosphere of Sirius A relative to hydrogen is given by <math chem>\\textstyle\\left[\\frac{\\ce{Fe}}{\\ce{H}}\\right]=0.5</math>,<ref name=\"Qiu2001\" /> meaning iron is 316% as abundant as in the Sun's atmosphere. The high surface content of metallic elements is unlikely to be true of the entire star; rather the iron-peak and heavy metals are radiatively levitated towards the surface.<ref name=\"Kervella2003\" />\n\n=== Sirius B ===\n[[File:Sirius B-Earth comparison2.png|thumb|Comparison of Sirius B to Earth]]\n\nSirius B is one of the most massive [[white dwarf]]s known. With a mass of {{Solar mass|1.02}}, it is almost double the {{Solar mass|0.5\u20130.6}} average. This mass is packed into a volume roughly equal to the Earth's.<ref name=\"Barstow2005\" /> The current surface temperature is 25,200&nbsp;K.<ref name=\"Liebert2005\" /> Because there is no internal heat source, Sirius B will steadily cool as the remaining heat is radiated into space over more than two billion years.<ref name=\"Imamura1995\" />\n\nA white dwarf forms after a star has evolved from the main sequence and then passed through a [[red giant]] stage. This occurred when Sirius B was less than half its current age, around 120 million years ago. The original star had an estimated {{Solar mass|5}}<ref name=\"Liebert2005\" /> and was a [[B-type star]] (roughly B4\u20135)<ref name=\"Siess2000\" /><ref name=\"Palla2005\" /> when it was still on the main sequence. While it passed through the red giant stage, Sirius B may have enriched the [[metallicity]] of its companion.\n\nThis star is primarily composed of a carbon\u2013oxygen mixture that was generated by helium fusion in the progenitor star.<ref name=\"Liebert2005\" /> This is overlaid by an envelope of lighter elements, with the materials segregated by mass because of the high surface gravity.<ref name=\"Koester1990\" /> The outer atmosphere of Sirius B is now almost pure hydrogen\u2014the element with the lowest mass\u2014and no other elements are seen in its spectrum.<ref name=\"Holberg2004\" />\n\n=== Apparent third star ===\nSince 1894, irregularities have been observed in the orbits of Sirius A and B with an apparent periodicity of 6\u20136.4 years. A 1995 study concluded that such a companion likely exists, with a mass of roughly 0.05 solar masses- a small [[red dwarf]] or large [[brown dwarf]], with an apparent magnitude of >15, and less than 3 arcseconds from Sirius A.<ref name=\"Benest1995\" />\n\nMore recent (and accurate) astrometric observations by the Hubble Space Telescope ruled out the existence of such an object entirely. The 1995 study predicted an astrometric movement of roughly 90 [[Milliarcsecond|mas]] (0.09 arcseconds), but Hubble was unable to detect any location anomaly to an accuracy of 5 mas (0.005 arcsec). This ruled out any objects orbiting Sirius A with more than 0.033 solar masses orbiting in 0.5 years, and 0.014 in 2 years. The study was also able to rule out any companions to Sirius B with more than 0.024 solar masses orbiting in 0.5 years, and 0.0095 orbiting in 1.8 years.

It was once a member of an [[open cluster]], but has since become gravitationally unbound from the cluster.<ref name=\"Frommert2003\" /> Analyses in 2003 and 2005 found Sirius's membership in the group to be questionable: the Ursa Major Group has an estimated age of 500 \u00b1 100&nbsp;million years, whereas Sirius, with metallicity similar to the Sun's, has an age that is only half this, making it too young to belong to the group.<ref name=\"Liebert2005\" /><ref name=\"King2003\" /><ref name=\"Croswell2005\" /> Sirius may instead be a member of the proposed Sirius Supercluster, along with other scattered stars such as [[Beta Aurigae]], [[Alpha Coronae Borealis]], [[Beta Crateris]], [[Beta Eridani]] and [[Beta Serpentis]].<ref name=\"Eggen1992\" /> This would be one of three large clusters located within {{convert|500|ly|pc}} of the Sun.

In extreme cases, a foaming dog might have rabies, which could infect and kill humans they had bitten.<ref name=\"Holberg2007-20\" /> [[Homer]], in the ''[[Iliad]]'', describes the approach of [[Achilles]] toward [[Troy]] in these words:<ref name=\"Homer\" />\n{{quote|<poem>\nSirius rises late in the dark, liquid sky\nOn summer nights, star of stars,\nOrion's Dog they call it, brightest\nOf all, but an evil portent, bringing heat\nAnd fevers to suffering humanity.\n</poem>}}\n\nIn Iranian mythology, especially in [[Persian mythology]] and in [[Zoroastrianism]], the ancient religion of [[Persia]], Sirius appears as ''[[Tishtrya]]'' and is revered as the rain-maker divinity (Tishtar of [[New Persian]] poetry). Beside passages in the [[sacred texts]] of the [[Avesta]], the [[Avestan]] language ''Tishtrya'' followed by the version ''Tir'' in [[Middle Persian|Middle]] and New Persian is also depicted in the [[Persian literature|Persian]] epic [[Shahnameh]] of [[Ferdowsi]]. Due to the concept of the [[yazatas]], powers which are \"worthy of worship\", Tishtrya is a divinity of rain and fertility and an antagonist of [[apaosha]], the demon of drought. In this struggle, Tishtrya is depicted as a white horse.<ref>{{cite book\n|author=Doostkhah, Jalil\n|title=Avesta.

Many nations among the indigenous peoples of [[North America]] also associated Sirius with canines; the [[Seri people|Seri]] and [[Tohono O'odham people|Tohono O'odham]] of the southwest note the star as a dog that follows mountain sheep, while the [[Blackfoot]] called it \"Dog-face\". The [[Cherokee]] paired Sirius with [[Antares]] as a dog-star guardian of either end of the \"Path of Souls\". The [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] of Nebraska had several associations; the Wolf (Skidi) tribe knew it as the \"Wolf Star\", while other branches knew it as the \"Coyote Star\". Further north, the Alaskan [[Inuit]] of the [[Bering Strait]] called it \"Moon Dog\".<ref name=\"Holberg2007-23\" />\n\nSeveral cultures also associated the star with a bow and arrows. The ancient Chinese visualized a large bow and arrow across the southern sky, formed by the constellations of [[Puppis]] and Canis Major. In this, the arrow tip is pointed at the wolf Sirius. A similar association is depicted at the [[Dendera Temple complex|Temple of Hathor]] in [[Dendera]], where the goddess [[Satet]] has drawn her arrow at [[Hathor]] (Sirius). Known as \"Tir\", the star was portrayed as the arrow itself in later Persian culture.<ref name=\"Holberg2007-24\" />\n\nSirius is mentioned in ''[[Surah]]'', ''[[An-Najm]]'' (\"The Star\"), of the [[Qur'an]], where it is given the name {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0650\u0651\u0639\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0649}} (transliteration: ''a\u0161-\u0161i\u2018r\u0101'' or ''ash-shira''; the leader).<ref name=\"Staff2007\" />  The verse is: \"{{lang|ar|\u0648\u0623\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0651 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0650\u0651\u0639\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0649}}\", \"That He is the Lord of Sirius (the Mighty Star).\" (An-Najm:49)<ref name=\"Quran\" /> [[Ibn Kathir]] said in his commentary \"that it is the bright star, named Mirzam Al-Jawza' (Sirius), which a group of Arabs used to worship\".<ref name=\"tom1977\" /> The alternate name ''Aschere'', used by [[Johann Bayer]], is derived from this.<ref name=\"Allen1899\" />\n\nIn [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]], it is believed the ''Seven Stars of the [[Pleiades in folklore and literature|Pleiades]]'' transmit the [[spiritual energy]] of the [[Seven Rays#In Theosophy|Seven Rays]] from the ''Galactic Logos'' to the ''Seven Stars of the [[Ursa Major|Great Bear]]'', then to Sirius.

Sirius is a [[binary star]]  consisting of a [[main sequence|main-sequence]] [[star]] of [[spectral type]] A0 or A1, termed Sirius A, and a faint [[white dwarf]] companion of spectral type DA2, termed Sirius B. The distance between the two varies between 8.2 and 31.5 [[astronomical unit]]s as they orbit every 50 years.<ref name=\"Schaaf2008\" />\n\nSirius appears bright because of its intrinsic [[luminosity]] and its proximity to the [[Solar System]].

Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System, so it will slightly increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years. After that time, its distance will begin to increase, and it will become fainter, but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth's night sky for the next 210,000 years.<ref>''Sky and Telescope'', April 1998 (p60), based on computations from [[Hipparcos]] data.</ref>\n\nSirius A is about twice as massive as the Sun ({{Solar mass|link=y}}) and has an [[Absolute magnitude|absolute visual magnitude]] of +1.42.

The system is between 200 and {{Nowrap|300 million}} years old.<ref name=\"Liebert2005\" /> It was originally composed of two bright bluish stars. The more massive of these, Sirius B, consumed its resources and became a [[red giant]] before shedding its outer layers and collapsing into its current state as a white dwarf around {{Nowrap|120 million}} years ago.<ref name=\"Liebert2005\" />\n\nSirius is known colloquially as the \"'''Dog Star'''\", reflecting its prominence in its [[constellation]], [[Canis Major]] (the Greater Dog).<ref name=\"Allen1899\" /> The [[heliacal rising]] of Sirius marked the flooding of the [[Nile]] in [[Ancient Egypt]] and the \"[[dog days]]\" of summer for the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], while to the [[Polynesian people|Polynesians]], mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, the star marked winter and was an important reference for their navigation around the Pacific Ocean.\n\n[[File:Sirius.jpg|thumb|Sirius in space]]\n\n== Observational history ==\n{{hiero|Sirius<br/>''{{lang|egy|[[wikt:spdt|Spdt]]}}''|<hiero>X1:N14-M44</hiero>|align=left}}\n\nThe brightest star in the night sky, Sirius is recorded in some of the earliest astronomical records. Its displacement from the [[ecliptic]] causes its heliacal rising to be remarkably regular compared to other stars, with a period of almost exactly 365.25 days holding it constant relative to the [[solar year]]. This rising occurs at [[Cairo]] on 19{{nbsp}}July ([[Julian calendar|Julian]]), placing it just prior to the onset of the [[flooding of the Nile|annual flooding]] of the Nile during antiquity.<ref name=\"Wendorf2001\"/> Owing to the flood's own irregularity, the extreme precision of the star's return made it important to the ancient Egyptians,<ref name=\"Wendorf2001\" /> who worshipped it as the goddess [[Sopdet]] ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:spdt|Spdt]]}}, \"Triangle\";{{efn|Compare the meaning of the Egyptian name with Sirius's completion of the [[Winter Triangle]] [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]], joining the other two brightest stars of the northern winter sky, [[Betelgeuse]] and [[Procyon]].}} {{lang-grc-gre|{{linktext|\u03a3\u1ff6\u03b8\u03b9\u03c2}}}}, ''S\u014d\u0302this''), guarantor of the fertility of their land.{{efn|As Sirius is visible together with the constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], the Egyptians worshipped Orion as the god [[Sah (god)|Sah]], the husband of Sopdet, with whom she had a son, the sky god [[Sopdu]].

The joining of Sopdet with Isis would allow [[Plutarch]] to state that \"The soul of Isis is called Dog by the Greeks\", meaning Sirius worshipped as Isis-Sopdet by Egyptians was named the Dog by the Greeks and Romans. The 70-day period of the absence of Sirius from the sky was understood as the passing of Sopdet-Isis and Sah-Osiris through the [[duat|Egyptian underworld]].<ref name=\"Holberg2007-4-5\" />}} The [[Egyptian civil calendar]] was apparently initiated to have its New Year \"[[Mesori]]\" coincide with the appearance of Sirius, although its lack of [[leap year]]s meant that this congruence only held for four years until its date began to wander backwards through the months. The Egyptians continued to note the times of Sirius's annual return, which may have led them to the discovery of the 1460-year [[Sothic cycle]] and influenced the development of the Julian and [[Alexandrian calendar]]s.\n\nThe ancient Greeks observed that the appearance of Sirius heralded the hot and dry summer and feared that it caused plants to wilt, men to weaken, and women to become aroused.<ref name=\"Holberg2007-19\" /> Due to its brightness, Sirius would have been seen to [[Scintillation (astronomy)|twinkle]] more in the unsettled weather conditions of early summer. To Greek observers, this signified emanations that caused its malignant influence.

If it rose clear, it would portend good fortune; if it was misty or faint then it foretold (or emanated) pestilence. Coins retrieved from the island from the 3rd century BC feature dogs or stars with emanating rays, highlighting Sirius's importance.<ref name=\"Holberg2007-20\" /> The Romans celebrated the heliacal setting of Sirius around April 25, sacrificing a dog, along with incense, wine, and a sheep, to the goddess [[Robigo]] so that the star's emanations would not cause [[Rust (fungus)|wheat rust]] on wheat crops that year.<ref name=\"Ovid\" />\n\n[[Ptolemy]] of Alexandria mapped the stars in Books&nbsp;VII and VIII of his ''[[Almagest]]'', in which he used Sirius as the location for the globe's central meridian.

The other five are class M and K stars, such as [[Arcturus]] and [[Betelgeuse]].<ref name=\"Holberg2007-32\" />\n\nBright stars were important to the ancient Polynesians for navigation of the Pacific Ocean. They also served as latitude markers; the declination of Sirius matches the latitude of the archipelago of [[Fiji]] at 17\u00b0S and thus passes directly over the islands each night.<ref name=\"Holberg2007-25\" /> Sirius served as the body of a \"Great Bird\" constellation called ''Manu'', with Canopus as the southern wingtip and [[Procyon]] the northern wingtip, which divided the Polynesian night sky into two hemispheres.<ref name=\"Holberg2007-25-26\" /> Just as the appearance of Sirius in the morning sky marked summer in Greece, it marked the onset of winter for the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], whose name ''Takurua'' described both the star and the season.

Since 1894, some apparent orbital irregularities in the Sirius system have been observed, suggesting a third very small companion star, but this has never been confirmed.

The 1st-century poet [[Marcus Manilius]] described it as \"sea-blue\", as did the 4th century [[Avienus]].<ref name=\"Holberg2007-163\" /> It was the standard white star in ancient China, and multiple records from the 2nd century BCE up to the 7th century CE all describe Sirius as white.<ref name=\"Jiang1992\" /><ref name=\"Jiang1993\" />\n\nIn 1985, German astronomers Wolfhard Schlosser and Werner Bergmann published an account of an 8th-century [[Lombardy|Lombardic]] manuscript, which contains ''De cursu stellarum ratio'' by St. [[Gregory of Tours]]. The Latin text taught readers how to determine the times of nighttime prayers from positions of the stars, and Sirius is described within as ''rubeola''&nbsp;\u2013 \"reddish\". The authors proposed this was further evidence Sirius B had been a red giant at the time.<ref name=\"Schlosser1985\" /> Other scholars replied that it was likely St. Gregory had been referring to [[Arcturus]].<ref name=\"McCluskey1987\" /><ref name=\"VanGent1987\" />\n\nThe possibility that [[stellar evolution]] of either Sirius A or Sirius B could be responsible for this discrepancy has been rejected by astronomers on the grounds that the timescale of thousands of years is much too short and that there is no sign of the nebulosity in the system that would be expected had such a change taken place.<ref name=\"Whittet1999\" /> An interaction with a third star, to date undiscovered, has also been proposed as a possibility for a red appearance.<ref name=\"Kuchner2000\" /> Alternative explanations are either that the description as red is a poetic metaphor for ill fortune, or that the dramatic [[scintillation (astronomy)|scintillations]] of the star when rising left the viewer with the impression that it was red.

From the [[Southern Hemisphere]] in early July, Sirius can be seen in both the evening where it sets after the [[Sun]] and in the morning where it rises before the Sun.<ref name=\"Stargazers2000\" />\n\nSirius, along with [[Procyon]] and [[Betelgeuse]], forms one of the three [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of the [[Winter Triangle]] to observers in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].<ref name=\"Darling\" />\n\nDue to [[precession]] (and slight [[proper motion]]), Sirius will move further south in the future. Starting around the year 9000, Sirius will no longer be visible from northern and central Europe, and in 14,000 its declination will be \u221267\u00b0 and thus it will be circumpolar throughout [[South Africa]] and in most parts of Australia.\n\nSirius can be observed in [[daylight]] with the naked eye under the right conditions. Ideally, the sky should be very clear, with the observer at a high altitude, the star passing overhead, and the Sun low on the horizon.<ref name=\"Henshaw1984\" /> These observing conditions are more easily met in the Southern Hemisphere, due to the southerly declination of Sirius.\n\nThe orbital motion of the Sirius binary system brings the two stars to a minimum angular separation of 3&nbsp;[[arcsecond]]s and a maximum of 11&nbsp;arcseconds. At the closest approach, it is an observational challenge to distinguish the white dwarf from its more luminous companion, requiring a telescope with at least 300&nbsp;mm (12&nbsp;in) aperture and excellent seeing conditions. A [[periastron]] occurred in 1994{{efn|Two full 50.09-year orbits following the periastron epoch of 1894.13 gives a date of 1994.31.}} and the pair have since been moving apart, making them easier to separate with a telescope.<ref name=\"Mullaney2008\" />\n\nAt a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6&nbsp;ly), the Sirius system contains two of the eight [[List of nearest stars|nearest stars]] to the Sun, and it is the fifth closest stellar system to the Sun.<ref name=\"Todd2006\" /> This proximity is the main reason for its brightness, as with other near stars such as [[Alpha Centauri]] and in contrast to distant, highly luminous supergiants such as Canopus, [[Rigel]] or Betelgeuse.<ref name=\"RASNZ\" /> It is still around 25 times more luminous than the Sun.<ref name=\"Liebert2005\" /> The closest large neighbouring star to Sirius is Procyon, 1.61 parsecs (5.24&nbsp;ly) away.<ref name=\"SolStation\" /> The ''[[Voyager 2]]'' spacecraft, launched in 1977 to study the four [[giant planet]]s in the Solar System, is expected to pass within {{convert|4.3|ly|pc}} of Sirius in approximately 296,000 years.<ref name=\"Angrum2005\" />\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Stellar system ==\n[[File:Orbit Sirius B arcsec.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The orbit of Sirius B around A as seen from Earth (slanted ellipse).

At this point, it will pass through a [[red giant]] stage, then settle down to become a white dwarf.\n\nSirius A is classed as an [[Am star]] because the spectrum shows deep metallic [[absorption line]]s,<ref name=auriere2010 /> indicating an enhancement in elements heavier than helium, such as iron.<ref name=\"SolStation\" /><ref name=\"Kervella2003\" /> The spectral type has been reported as A0mA1 Va, which indicates that it would be classified as A1 from hydrogen and helium lines, but A0 from the metallic lines that cause it to be grouped with the Am stars.<ref name=nstars/> When compared to the Sun, the proportion of iron in the atmosphere of Sirius A relative to hydrogen is given by <math chem>\\textstyle\\left[\\frac{\\ce{Fe}}{\\ce{H}}\\right]=0.5</math>,<ref name=\"Qiu2001\" /> meaning iron is 316% as abundant as in the Sun's atmosphere. The high surface content of metallic elements is unlikely to be true of the entire star; rather the iron-peak and heavy metals are radiatively levitated towards the surface.<ref name=\"Kervella2003\" />\n\n=== Sirius B ===\n[[File:Sirius B-Earth comparison2.png|thumb|Comparison of Sirius B to Earth]]\n\nSirius B is one of the most massive [[white dwarf]]s known. With a mass of {{Solar mass|1.02}}, it is almost double the {{Solar mass|0.5\u20130.6}} average. This mass is packed into a volume roughly equal to the Earth's.<ref name=\"Barstow2005\" /> The current surface temperature is 25,200&nbsp;K.<ref name=\"Liebert2005\" /> Because there is no internal heat source, Sirius B will steadily cool as the remaining heat is radiated into space over more than two billion years.<ref name=\"Imamura1995\" />\n\nA white dwarf forms after a star has evolved from the main sequence and then passed through a [[red giant]] stage. This occurred when Sirius B was less than half its current age, around 120 million years ago. The original star had an estimated {{Solar mass|5}}<ref name=\"Liebert2005\" /> and was a [[B-type star]] (roughly B4\u20135)<ref name=\"Siess2000\" /><ref name=\"Palla2005\" /> when it was still on the main sequence. While it passed through the red giant stage, Sirius B may have enriched the [[metallicity]] of its companion.\n\nThis star is primarily composed of a carbon\u2013oxygen mixture that was generated by helium fusion in the progenitor star.<ref name=\"Liebert2005\" /> This is overlaid by an envelope of lighter elements, with the materials segregated by mass because of the high surface gravity.<ref name=\"Koester1990\" /> The outer atmosphere of Sirius B is now almost pure hydrogen\u2014the element with the lowest mass\u2014and no other elements are seen in its spectrum.<ref name=\"Holberg2004\" />\n\n=== Apparent third star ===\nSince 1894, irregularities have been observed in the orbits of Sirius A and B with an apparent periodicity of 6\u20136.4 years. A 1995 study concluded that such a companion likely exists, with a mass of roughly 0.05 solar masses- a small [[red dwarf]] or large [[brown dwarf]], with an apparent magnitude of >15, and less than 3 arcseconds from Sirius A.<ref name=\"Benest1995\" />\n\nMore recent (and accurate) astrometric observations by the Hubble Space Telescope ruled out the existence of such an object entirely. The 1995 study predicted an astrometric movement of roughly 90 [[Milliarcsecond|mas]] (0.09 arcseconds), but Hubble was unable to detect any location anomaly to an accuracy of 5 mas (0.005 arcsec). This ruled out any objects orbiting Sirius A with more than 0.033 solar masses orbiting in 0.5 years, and 0.014 in 2 years. The study was also able to rule out any companions to Sirius B with more than 0.024 solar masses orbiting in 0.5 years, and 0.0095 orbiting in 1.8 years. Effectively, there are almost certainly no additional bodies in the Sirius system larger than a small brown dwarf or large exoplanet.<ref name=\"siriusCruledout\">{{cite web|last1=Andrew|first1=LePage|title=New Hubble Observations of the Sirius System {{!}} Drew Ex Machina|url=https://www.drewexmachina.com/2017/04/06/new-hubble-observations-of-the-sirius-system/|website=www.drewexmachina.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== {{Anchor|Sirius supercluster}}Star cluster membership ===\nIn 1909, [[Ejnar Hertzsprung]] was the first to suggest that Sirius was a member of the [[Ursa Major Moving Group]], based on his observations of the system's movements across the sky. The Ursa Major Group is a set of 220 stars that share a common motion through space. It was once a member of an [[open cluster]], but has since become gravitationally unbound from the cluster.<ref name=\"Frommert2003\" /> Analyses in 2003 and 2005 found Sirius's membership in the group to be questionable: the Ursa Major Group has an estimated age of 500 \u00b1 100&nbsp;million years, whereas Sirius, with metallicity similar to the Sun's, has an age that is only half this, making it too young to belong to the group.<ref name=\"Liebert2005\" /><ref name=\"King2003\" /><ref name=\"Croswell2005\" /> Sirius may instead be a member of the proposed Sirius Supercluster, along with other scattered stars such as [[Beta Aurigae]], [[Alpha Coronae Borealis]], [[Beta Crateris]], [[Beta Eridani]] and [[Beta Serpentis]].<ref name=\"Eggen1992\" /> This would be one of three large clusters located within {{convert|500|ly|pc}} of the Sun.

It is often colloquially called the \"Dog Star\" as the brightest star of [[Canis Major]], the \"Great Dog\" constellation. Canis Major was classically depicted as [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]]'s dog. The Ancient Greeks thought that Sirius's emanations could affect dogs adversely, making them behave abnormally during the \"dog days\", the hottest days of the summer. The Romans knew these days as {{lang|la|dies caniculares}}, and the star Sirius was called Canicula, \"little dog\". The excessive panting of dogs in hot weather was thought to place them at risk of desiccation and disease. In extreme cases, a foaming dog might have rabies, which could infect and kill humans they had bitten.<ref name=\"Holberg2007-20\" /> [[Homer]], in the ''[[Iliad]]'', describes the approach of [[Achilles]] toward [[Troy]] in these words:<ref name=\"Homer\" />\n{{quote|<poem>\nSirius rises late in the dark, liquid sky\nOn summer nights, star of stars,\nOrion's Dog they call it, brightest\nOf all, but an evil portent, bringing heat\nAnd fevers to suffering humanity.\n</poem>}}\n\nIn Iranian mythology, especially in [[Persian mythology]] and in [[Zoroastrianism]], the ancient religion of [[Persia]], Sirius appears as ''[[Tishtrya]]'' and is revered as the rain-maker divinity (Tishtar of [[New Persian]] poetry). Beside passages in the [[sacred texts]] of the [[Avesta]], the [[Avestan]] language ''Tishtrya'' followed by the version ''Tir'' in [[Middle Persian|Middle]] and New Persian is also depicted in the [[Persian literature|Persian]] epic [[Shahnameh]] of [[Ferdowsi]]. Due to the concept of the [[yazatas]], powers which are \"worthy of worship\", Tishtrya is a divinity of rain and fertility and an antagonist of [[apaosha]], the demon of drought. In this struggle, Tishtrya is depicted as a white horse.<ref>{{cite book\n|author=Doostkhah, Jalil\n|title=Avesta.

Many nations among the indigenous peoples of [[North America]] also associated Sirius with canines; the [[Seri people|Seri]] and [[Tohono O'odham people|Tohono O'odham]] of the southwest note the star as a dog that follows mountain sheep, while the [[Blackfoot]] called it \"Dog-face\". The [[Cherokee]] paired Sirius with [[Antares]] as a dog-star guardian of either end of the \"Path of Souls\". The [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] of Nebraska had several associations; the Wolf (Skidi) tribe knew it as the \"Wolf Star\", while other branches knew it as the \"Coyote Star\". Further north, the Alaskan [[Inuit]] of the [[Bering Strait]] called it \"Moon Dog\".<ref name=\"Holberg2007-23\" />\n\nSeveral cultures also associated the star with a bow and arrows. The ancient Chinese visualized a large bow and arrow across the southern sky, formed by the constellations of [[Puppis]] and Canis Major. In this, the arrow tip is pointed at the wolf Sirius. A similar association is depicted at the [[Dendera Temple complex|Temple of Hathor]] in [[Dendera]], where the goddess [[Satet]] has drawn her arrow at [[Hathor]] (Sirius).

The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined castle by the river and a stretch of wall that linked South, East and original North Gates, the last known as Inner North Gate and now well within the city, still survived. From South to East Gates the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from South Gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to Outer North Gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above West Gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at Inner North Gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The Outer North Gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> The King's demand for its surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around South and North Gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of North Gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective cover filling the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite East Gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref> \n\nOn 26 August the Earl of Essex left London with an army of 15,000 men to relieve the City. Meanwhile, the Royalist army began tunnelling to place a mine under the East Gate, but a sudden spell of bad weather flooded the tunnel, leaving enough time for the Earl of Essex to arrive and reinforce the city. \n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]].

As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> The King's demand for its surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on the green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around South and North Gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of North Gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective cover filling the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite East Gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref> \n\nOn 26 August the Earl of Essex left London with an army of 15,000 men to relieve the City. Meanwhile, the Royalist army began tunnelling to place a mine under the East Gate, but a sudden spell of bad weather flooded the tunnel, leaving enough time for the Earl of Essex to arrive and reinforce the city. \n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.

This was the dream which he and his long-life friend [[Masoud Kimiai]] (Iranian film director, screenwriter, and producer) shared. Finally, in 1967, when Masoud Kimiai got a chance to direct his first film (''Come Stranger'', 196, Monfaredzadeh composed the score. However, it was their second collaboration ([[Qeysar (film)|''Qeysar'']], 1969) that made history. Months before ''Qeysar'' was released, he had left Iran to continue his studies in Germany where he had the opportunity to be acquainted with the [[Confederation of Iranian Students]] which helped him to reshape and deepen his social and political ideas. Hence, the [[Qeysar (film)|''Qeysar'']] outbreak made him give up his studies and come back to Iran to pursue his cinematic career. The quality of his work in ''Qeysar'', along with the success of the film at the box office and among the critics, put more attention on the music for films in Iran which until that day was not taken seriously by the Iranian film industry. The following year, he won the Best Film Score award for [[Qeysar (film)|''Qeysar'']] at the second \"Sepas Awards\" ceremony which would be repeated the next year for his third collaboration with [[Masoud Kimiai]] (''Reza Motori'', 1970). His film scores continued with ''Toughi'' ([[Ali Hatami]], 1970), ''Window'' (Jalal Moghaddam, 1970), ''[[Dash Akol]]'' (Masoud Kimiai, 1971), ''Topoli'' (Reza Mirlohi, 1972), ''Balouch'' (Masoud Kimiai, 1972), ''Soil'' (Masoud Kimiai, 1973), ''[[Tangna]]'' ([[Amir Naderi]], 1973), and ''The Deers'' ''(Gavaznha)'' (Masoud Kimiai, 1974).<ref>{{Cite book|title= Displaced allegories : post-revolutionary Iranian cinema|last= Negar.|first= Mottahedeh|date= 2008|publisher= Duke University Press|isbn= 9780822342755|location= Durham|oclc= 226361821}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url= https://archive.org/details/closeupiranianci0000daba|title= Close up : Iranian cinema, past, present, and future|last= 1951-|first= Dabashi, Hamid|date= 2001|publisher= Verso|isbn= 1859843328|location= London|oclc= 48432961|url-access= registration}}</ref>\n\n=== Pop music ===\nIn 1965 and after working on the [[National Iranian Radio and Television|National Iranian Radio]] and later the [[University of Tehran]] orchestra, he began his collaboration with the Tanin Recording Studio (the first private recording studio in Iran), and along with his comrades contributed to shape a new atmosphere in the [[Iranian pop music]]. In parallel to his cinematic activities and through his well-known songs such as \"Friday\" and \"Nightly 1\", he tried to represent Iranian people by picturing their pains and sorrows under the totalitarian Shah\u2019s regime. In 1973, he was sentenced to jail for his social and political ideas. However, after his release he would not remain silent and with his works (songs such as \"Gonjishkak-e Ashi Mashi\", \"Childish (Koudakaneh)\", \"Nightly 2\" or \"Friday for Friday\"), he accompanied and supported people in the upcoming revolution.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Iranian Music and Popular Entertainment: From Motrebi to Losanjelesi and Beyond|last= Breyley|first= G.

This was the dream which he and his long-life friend [[Masoud Kimiai]] (Iranian film director, screenwriter, and producer) shared. Finally, in 1967, when Masoud Kimiai got a chance to direct his first film (''Come Stranger'', 196, Monfaredzadeh composed the score. However, it was their second collaboration ([[Qeysar (film)|''Qeysar'']], 1969) that made history. Months before ''Qeysar'' was released, he had left Iran to continue his studies in Germany where he had the opportunity to be acquainted with the [[Confederation of Iranian Students]] which helped him to reshape and deepen his social and political ideas. Hence, the [[Qeysar (film)|''Qeysar'']] outbreak made him give up his studies and come back to Iran to pursue his cinematic career. The quality of his work in ''Qeysar'', along with the success of the film at the box office and among the critics, put more attention on the music for films in Iran which until that day was not taken seriously by the Iranian film industry. The following year, he won the Best Film Score award for [[Qeysar (film)|''Qeysar'']] at the second \"Sepas Awards\" ceremony which would be repeated the next year for his third collaboration with [[Masoud Kimiai]] (''Reza Motori'', 1970). His film scores continued with ''Toughi'' ([[Ali Hatami]], 1970), ''Window'' (Jalal Moghaddam, 1970), ''[[Dash Akol]]'' (Masoud Kimiai, 1971), ''Topoli'' (Reza Mirlohi, 1972), ''Balouch'' (Masoud Kimiai, 1972), ''Soil'' (Masoud Kimiai, 1973), ''[[Tangna]]'' ([[Amir Naderi]], 1973), and ''The Deers'' ''(Gavaznha)'' (Masoud Kimiai, 1974).<ref>{{Cite book|title= Displaced allegories : post-revolutionary Iranian cinema|last= Negar.|first= Mottahedeh|date= 2008|publisher= Duke University Press|isbn= 9780822342755|location= Durham|oclc= 226361821}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url= https://archive.org/details/closeupiranianci0000daba|title= Close up : Iranian cinema, past, present, and future|last= 1951-|first= Dabashi, Hamid|date= 2001|publisher= Verso|isbn= 1859843328|location= London|oclc= 48432961|url-access= registration}}</ref>\n\n=== Pop music ===\nIn 1965 and after working on the [[National Iranian Radio and Television|National Iranian Radio]] and later the [[University of Tehran]] orchestra, he began his collaboration with the Tanin Recording Studio (the first private recording studio in Iran), and along with his comrades contributed to shape a new atmosphere in the [[Iranian pop music]]. In parallel to his cinematic activities and through his well-known songs such as \"Friday\" and \"Nightly 1\", he tried to represent Iranian people by picturing their pains and sorrows under the totalitarian Shah\u2019s regime. In 1973, he was sentenced to jail for his social and political ideas. However, after his release he would not remain silent and with his works (songs such as \"Gonjishkak-e Ashi Mashi\", \"Childish (Koudakaneh)\", \"Nightly 2\" or \"Friday for Friday\"), he accompanied and supported people in the upcoming revolution.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Iranian Music and Popular Entertainment: From Motrebi to Losanjelesi and Beyond|last= Breyley|first= G.

The game centers around the manipulation of \"rules\"\u2014represented by tiles with words written on them\u2014in order to allow the [[player character]], usually the titular Baba, to reach a specified goal.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Baba is you gameplay.gif|thumb|left|The three blocks reading \"WALL IS STOP\" create a rule that prevents Baba (the white [[rabbit]], made the [[player character]] by the phrase \"BABA IS YOU\") from crossing wall tiles.

Outside of this enclosure is the phrase \"BABA IS YOU\", and inside the enclosure is the phrase \"WALL IS STOP\". Baba moves around, and attempts to walk past a wall, but fails. Then, Baba breaks the \"WALL IS STOP\" phrase, and is able to walk past it.]]\nThe player, usually, controls a character known as Baba, with exceptions in some levels. Each level contains various movable word tiles, corresponding to specific types of objects and obstacles on the field (such as Baba itself, the goal flag, walls and environmental hazards, and other creatures), linking [[Operator (computer programming)|operators]] such as \"is\" and \"and\", and verb tiles reflecting the properties of these objects (such as \"you\", which makes the object become controlled by the player, \"push\" to make them movable, \"stop\" to make them impassable, \"win\" to specify the goal, \"sink\" to make items drown in it, and so on). The objective of each level is for the player to reach the goal by manipulating these tiles to create or modify \"rules\" by which they behave. For example, the goal can be changed by moving \"is\" and \"win\" blocks to another object, and the player can travel through objects by removing the \"stop\" trait from them.<ref name=\":0\" /> Levels can force specific rules by placing their blocks in a corner, so they cannot be moved.<ref name=\":1\" /> The game contains over 200 levels.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Development and release ==\n[[File:Arvi Teikari GDC IGF 2018.png|thumb|Arvi Teikari accepting his [[Independent Games Festival]] Award in 2018|alt=Arvi Teikari speaking behind a podium. He is wearing a black shirt with many icons from the game, including a flag, a mushroom, the \"BABA\", \"IS\", and \"WIN\" operators, and Baba itself.]]\nThe theme of the 2017 [[Nordic Game Jam]] was \"Not There\", which prompted Teikari (a student at the [[University of Helsinki]] who had previously developed the [[Metroidvania]]-genre game ''[[Environmental Station Alpha]]'') to envision a game concept based on manipulating logic operators. He explained that levels were often created by brainstorming a \"cool\" or \"amusing\" solution, and then coming up with how the player would accomplish it. Teikari noted that \"the most satisfying moments in puzzle games are those which present the player with simple but hard-to-wrap-your-head-around situations, so that solving the puzzle is about figuring out that ''one'' neat trick/twist.\"<ref name=\":2\" />  As with his previous projects, the game was developed using [[Multimedia Fusion]] 2, and a [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] scripting plugin; Teikari credited his friend Lukas Meller for help with the Lua implementations.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/314548/Road_to_the_IGF_Hempuli_Oys_Baba_Is_You.php|title=Road to the IGF: Hempuli Oy's Baba Is You|last=Couture|first=Joel|date=|website=Gamasutra|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308163041/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/314548/Road_to_the_IGF_Hempuli_Oys_Baba_Is_You.php|archive-date=2018-03-08|url-status=live|access-date=2019-03-14|df=}}</ref>\n\nTeikari stated in 2017 that he planned to release the full game in 2018, and placed a development version of the title for download at [[itch.io]].

The game centers around the manipulation of \"rules\"\u2014represented by tiles with words written on them\u2014in order to allow the [[player character]], usually the titular Baba, to reach a specified goal.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Baba is you gameplay.gif|thumb|left|The three blocks reading \"WALL IS STOP\" create a rule that prevents Baba (the white [[rabbit]], made the [[player character]] by the phrase \"BABA IS YOU\") from crossing wall tiles. Once the rule blocks are separated, the rule is no longer enforced, and Baba can pass through walls.]]\nThe player, usually, controls a character known as Baba, with exceptions in some levels. Each level contains various movable word tiles, corresponding to specific types of objects and obstacles on the field (such as Baba itself, the goal flag, walls and environmental hazards, and other creatures), linking [[Operator (computer programming)|operators]] such as \"is\" and \"and\", and verb tiles reflecting the properties of these objects (such as \"you\", which makes the object become controlled by the player, \"push\" to make them movable, \"stop\" to make them impassable, \"win\" to specify the goal, \"sink\" to make items drown in it, and so on). The objective of each level is for the player to reach the goal by manipulating these tiles to create or modify \"rules\" by which they behave. For example, the goal can be changed by moving \"is\" and \"win\" blocks to another object, and the player can travel through objects by removing the \"stop\" trait from them.<ref name=\":0\" /> Levels can force specific rules by placing their blocks in a corner, so they cannot be moved.<ref name=\":1\" /> The game contains over 200 levels.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Development and release ==\n[[File:Arvi Teikari GDC IGF 2018.png|thumb|right|Arvi Teikari accepting his [[Independent Games Festival]] Award in 2018]]\nThe theme of the 2017 [[Nordic Game Jam]] was \"Not There\", which prompted Teikari (a student at the [[University of Helsinki]] who had previously developed the [[Metroidvania]]-genre game ''[[Environmental Station Alpha]]'') to envision a game concept based on manipulating logic operators. He explained that levels were often created by brainstorming a \"cool\" or \"amusing\" solution, and then coming up with how the player would accomplish it. Teikari noted that \"the most satisfying moments in puzzle games are those which present the player with simple but hard-to-wrap-your-head-around situations, so that solving the puzzle is about figuring out that ''one'' neat trick/twist.\"<ref name=\":2\" />  As with his previous projects, the game was developed using [[Multimedia Fusion]] 2, and a [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] scripting plugin; Teikari credited his friend Lukas Meller for help with the Lua implementations.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/314548/Road_to_the_IGF_Hempuli_Oys_Baba_Is_You.php|title=Road to the IGF: Hempuli Oy's Baba Is You|last=Couture|first=Joel|date=|website=Gamasutra|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308163041/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/314548/Road_to_the_IGF_Hempuli_Oys_Baba_Is_You.php|archive-date=2018-03-08|url-status=live|access-date=2019-03-14|df=}}</ref>\n\nTeikari stated in 2017 that he planned to release the full game in 2018, and placed a development version of the title for download at [[itch.io]]. After ''Baba Is You'' won at the Independent Games Festival in March 2018, a [[video game clone|clone]] of the game was released by a French publisher on the [[App Store]], using nearly the same graphics and calling itself the same name. Teikari worked with the French division of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] to remove the offending app.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/316145/IGF_Awardwinning_Baba_Is_You_cloned_before_it_was_even_released.php | title = IGF Award-winning Baba Is You cloned before it was even released | first = Alex | last = Wawro | date = 2018-04-04 | access-date = 2019-03-16 | work = [[Gamasutra]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190421000239/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/316145/IGF_Awardwinning_Baba_Is_You_cloned_before_it_was_even_released.php | archive-date = 2019-04-21 | url-status = live | df =  }}</ref>\n\nThe game, and a [[Nintendo Switch]] release, were focused upon in a [[Nintendo]] [[indie game]]s showcase presentation on 31 August 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/nintendo-nindies-showcase-summer-2018-1202918718/|title=Nintendo Holds Nindies Showcase Summer 2018|last=Fogel|first=Stefanie|last2=Fogel|first2=Stefanie|date=2018-08-28|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-03-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829112824/https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/nintendo-nindies-showcase-summer-2018-1202918718/|archive-date=2018-08-29|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> ''Baba Is You'' was released on 13 March 2019, via [[Steam (software)|Steam]] for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS, and on Nintendo Switch.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA cross-platform level editor, with online level sharing, is expected to be added to the game within 2020.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/baba-is-you-has-a-cross-platform-level-editor-coming/ | title = Baba is You has a cross-platform level editor coming | first = Jonathan | last = Bolding | date = November 17, 2019 | accessdate = November 17, 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = NS: 84/100<ref name=\"MC_NS\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/baba-is-you |title=Baba Is You for Switch Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2020-03-10}}</ref><br />PC: 87/100<ref name=\"MC_PC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/baba-is-you |title=Baba Is You for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2020-03-10}}</ref>\n|PCGUS=PC: 90/100<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/baba-is-you-review/|title=Baba is You review|last=Warr|first=Philippa|date=2019-03-15|website=PC Gamer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n|PG=NS: 4.5/5<ref name=\":1\" />\n|GSpot=PC & NS: 7/10<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baba-is-you-review-game-changer/1900-6417109/|title=Baba is You Review - Game-Changer|first=Calum|last=Marsh|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Baba Is You'' won first place at the 2017 [[Nordic Game Jam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/a-puzzle-game-where-you-rewrite-the-rules-of-each-level-1833232432|title=A Puzzle Game Where You Rewrite The Rules Of Each Level|last=MacLeod|first=Riley|date=2019-03-13|website=[[Kotaku]]|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref> It was nominated for the [[Seumas McNally Grand Prize]] and won awards for \"Best Student Game\" and \"Excellence In Design\" at the 2018 [[IGF Awards]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/night-in-the-woods-tops-igf-awards-student-game-baba-is-you-wins-big/|title=Night in the Woods tops IGF Awards, student game Baba Is You wins big|last=Donnelly|first=Joe|date=2018-03-22|website=PC Gamer|access-date=2019-03-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190303155813/https://www.pcgamer.com/night-in-the-woods-tops-igf-awards-student-game-baba-is-you-wins-big/|archive-date=2019-03-03|url-status=live}}</ref> It was also nominated for \"Best Indie Game\" at the [[2019 Golden Joystick Awards]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/09/days_gone_rides_off_with_three_nominations_in_this_years_golden_joystick_awards|title=Days Gone Rides Off with Three Nominations in This Year's Golden Joystick Awards|last=Tailby|first=Stephen|date=2019-09-20|website=Push Square|access-date=2019-09-21}}</ref> for \"Indie Game of the Year\" at the [[Fun & Serious Game Festival|Titanium Awards]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.funandseriousgamefestival.com/awards/|title=Titanium Awards 2019|website=[[Fun & Serious Game Festival]]|access-date=2019-11-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191121193654/https://en.funandseriousgamefestival.com/awards/|archive-date=2019-11-21|url-status=live}}</ref> and for \"Best Independent Game\" at [[The Game Awards 2019]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2019-nominees-full-list/1100-6471564/|title=The Game Awards 2019 Nominees Full List|last=Winslow|first=Jeremy|date=2019-11-19|website=[[GameSpot]]|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> and won the award for \"Outstanding Achievement in Game Design\" for the [[23rd Annual D.I.C.E.

Most, however, have been chosen for their literary qualities, making the anthology a source of continual pleasure and surprise. (...) The cumulative power of this monumental and absorbing anthology stems from the clarity and vibrancy of the voices it assembles.

(...) The success of the collection is that it clearly illustrates why all women of African descent are connected by showing how closely related are the obstacles, the chasms of cultural indifference, and the disheartening racial and sexual dilemmas they faced. In so doing, the collection captures the range of their singular and combined accomplishments.\n\n''Daughters of Africa''\u2032s accomplishment lies in its glorious portrayal of the richness and magnitude of the spiritual well from which we've all drawn inspiration and to where we've all gone for sustenance, and as such, it is a stunning literary masterpiece.\"<ref name=B&N /></blockquote>\n\nThe anthology was on the [[Royal African Society]]'s list of \"50 Books By African Women That Everyone Should Read\",<ref>[http://whatsonafrica.org/50-books-by-african-women-that-everyone-should-read/# \"50 Books by African Women That Everyone Should Read\"], What's On Africa, RAS, 30 June 2014.</ref> was named by ''Ms Afropolitan'' as one of \"7 non-fiction books African feminists should read\",<ref>[http://www.msafropolitan.com/2015/09/non-fiction-books-for-african-feminists.html \"7 non-fiction books African feminists should read\"], ''Ms Afropolitan'', 27 September 2015.</ref> features regularly on many required-reading lists,<ref>Sandra E.

Most, however, have been chosen for their literary qualities, making the anthology a source of continual pleasure and surprise. (...) The cumulative power of this monumental and absorbing anthology stems from the clarity and vibrancy of the voices it assembles.

(...) The success of the collection is that it clearly illustrates why all women of African descent are connected by showing how closely related are the obstacles, the chasms of cultural indifference, and the disheartening racial and sexual dilemmas they faced. In so doing, the collection captures the range of their singular and combined accomplishments.\n\n''Daughters of Africa''\u2032s accomplishment lies in its glorious portrayal of the richness and magnitude of the spiritual well from which we've all drawn inspiration and to where we've all gone for sustenance, and as such, it is a stunning literary masterpiece.\"<ref name=B&N /></blockquote>\n\nThe anthology was on the [[Royal African Society]]'s list of \"50 Books By African Women That Everyone Should Read\",<ref>[http://whatsonafrica.org/50-books-by-african-women-that-everyone-should-read/# \"50 Books by African Women That Everyone Should Read\"], What's On Africa, RAS, 30 June 2014.</ref> was named by ''Ms Afropolitan'' as one of \"7 non-fiction books African feminists should read\",<ref>[http://www.msafropolitan.com/2015/09/non-fiction-books-for-african-feminists.html \"7 non-fiction books African feminists should read\"], ''Ms Afropolitan'', 27 September 2015.</ref> features regularly on many required-reading lists,<ref>Sandra E.
