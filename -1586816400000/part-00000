In 1844, at age 15, he left home without permission to go to [[Illinois]]. Two years later he joined the 2nd Illinois Volunteer Regiment and headed to [[Republic of Texas|Texas]] to participate in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. In [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], Chamberlain joined the [[regular army]] and became part of the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st U.S. Dragoons]]. He fought at the [[Battle of Buena Vista]] in February 1847 as well as several other operations in Mexico. In 1849, he was declared a [[desertion|deserter]] and by 1854 he had returned home to Boston to raise a family. He married Mary Keith on July 4, 1855, and they had three children.<ref name=tsha/> \n\nBy his own account, Chamberlain was also involved in some less savory aspects of the Texas\u2013Mexico border disputes. Most notably, he rode for a time with the infamous Glanton gang under the command of [[John Glanton]], which was contracted by Mexican authorities to track and kill hostile [[Apache]]s following the war. The gang became notorious for taking [[scalping|scalps]] under highly questionable circumstances to claim the bounties, and its members were eventually declared outlaws by the Mexican government. Chamberlain's memoirs regarding this period are the only known primary source attesting to the existence of the [[Texian]] known as [[Judge Holden]], Glanton's second-in-command. While Chamberlain and some others escaped, Glanton and a number of his gang were massacred by [[Quechan|Yuma]] Indians near what is now [[Yuma, Arizona]], in April 1850.\n\n==Civil War==\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], after being chief of staff to Brigadier General [[William W. Averell]] and [[Lieutenant Colonel]] of the [[1st Massachusetts Volunteer Cavalry|1st Massachusetts Cavalry Regiment]], Chamberlain commanded Camp Parole at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], for a time and also commanded the [[5th Regiment Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Cavalry|5th Massachusetts Colored Cavalry]], an all African-American unit, with the rank of colonel. He was wounded on six different occasions during the war.<ref>Eicher, John H. and Eicher, David J., ''Civil War High Commands'', p. 169. Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8047-3641-3}}.</ref> On February 24, 1865, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] nominated Chamberlain for the award of the honorary grade of [[brevet (military)|brevet]] brigadier general, [[U.S. Volunteers]], to rank from February 24, 1865, and the [[U.S. Senate]] confirmed the award on March 3.<ref>Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 742</ref> Chamberlain was mustered out of the U.S. Volunteers on September 16, 1865.<ref>Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 169</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n\nAfter the war, Chamberlain was a warden of state prisons in [[Massachusetts]] and [[Connecticut]].<ref>Hunt, Roger D. and Brown, Jack R., ''Brevet Brigadier Generals in Blue'', p. 206.

A large collection is held at the [[San Jacinto Museum of History]].\n\nChamberlain also authored and illustrated a harrowing autobiographical account of his travels during the 1840s, especially his service in the Mexican\u2013American War and his adventures with the Glanton gang, entitled ''My Confession: The Recollections of a Rogue'', which he wrote between 1855 and 1861. Though many of its stories are exaggerated in the romantic literary style popular at the time, research has corroborated most of them as true. Noted for its authentic descriptions of the experiences of the typical American soldier during the Mexican\u2013American War, Chamberlain's account continues to serve as a valuable primary source text for historians studying the war and the era as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1094401.My_Confession|title=My Confession: Recollections of a Rogue by Samuel E.

In 1844, at age 15, he left home without permission to go to [[Illinois]]. Two years later he joined the 2nd Illinois Volunteer Regiment and headed to [[Republic of Texas|Texas]] to participate in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. In [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], Chamberlain joined the [[regular army]] and became part of the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st U.S. Dragoons]]. He fought at the [[Battle of Buena Vista]] in February 1847 as well as several other operations in Mexico. In 1849, he was declared a [[desertion|deserter]] and by 1854 he had returned home to Boston to raise a family. He married Mary Keith on July 4, 1855, and they had three children.<ref name=tsha/> \n\nBy his own account, Chamberlain was also involved in some less savory aspects of the Texas\u2013Mexico border disputes. Most notably, he rode for a time with the infamous Glanton gang under the command of [[John Glanton]], which was contracted by Mexican authorities to track and kill hostile [[Apache]]s following the war. The gang became notorious for taking [[scalping|scalps]] under highly questionable circumstances to claim the bounties, and its members were eventually declared outlaws by the Mexican government. Chamberlain's memoirs regarding this period are the only known primary source attesting to the existence of the [[Texian]] known as [[Judge Holden]], Glanton's second-in-command. While Chamberlain and some others escaped, Glanton and a number of his gang were massacred by [[Quechan|Yuma]] Indians near what is now [[Yuma, Arizona]], in April 1850.\n\n==Civil War==\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], after being chief of staff to Brigadier General [[William W. Averell]] and [[Lieutenant Colonel]] of the [[1st Massachusetts Volunteer Cavalry|1st Massachusetts Cavalry Regiment]], Chamberlain commanded Camp Parole at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], for a time and also commanded the [[5th Regiment Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Cavalry|5th Massachusetts Colored Cavalry]], an all African-American unit, with the rank of colonel. He was wounded on six different occasions during the war.<ref>Eicher, John H. and Eicher, David J., ''Civil War High Commands'', p. 169. Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8047-3641-3}}.</ref> On February 24, 1865, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] nominated Chamberlain for the award of the honorary grade of [[brevet (military)|brevet]] brigadier general, [[U.S. Volunteers]], to rank from February 24, 1865, and the [[U.S. Senate]] confirmed the award on March 3.<ref>Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 742</ref> Chamberlain was mustered out of the U.S. Volunteers on September 16, 1865.<ref>Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 169</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n\nAfter the war, Chamberlain was a warden of state prisons in [[Massachusetts]] and [[Connecticut]].<ref>Hunt, Roger D. and Brown, Jack R., ''Brevet Brigadier Generals in Blue'', p. 206. Gaithersburg, MD: Olde Soldier Books, Inc., 1990. {{ISBN|1-56013-002-4}}.</ref> Settling in Massachusetts with his family, Chamberlain became well-known for his charming paintings, which consist largely of [[landscape]]s and battle scenes depicting the Mexican\u2013American War. A large collection is held at the [[San Jacinto Museum of History]].\n\nChamberlain also authored and illustrated a harrowing autobiographical account of his travels during the 1840s, especially his service in the Mexican\u2013American War and his adventures with the Glanton gang, entitled ''My Confession: The Recollections of a Rogue'', which he wrote between 1855 and 1861. Though many of its stories are exaggerated in the romantic literary style popular at the time, research has corroborated most of them as true. Noted for its authentic descriptions of the experiences of the typical American soldier during the Mexican\u2013American War, Chamberlain's account continues to serve as a valuable primary source text for historians studying the war and the era as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1094401.My_Confession|title=My Confession: Recollections of a Rogue by Samuel E.

The word ''[[hoplite]]'', derived from ''hoplon'', is the term for the classical Greek [[warrior]] who carried such a shield. The field originates in the 19th century with [[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Burton]]; although the origin of the word is often attributed to Burton, there are earlier references to it.<ref name=\"hacc1\" />  Despite the work of Burton and a few others, it was not until the 1960s that hoplology took shape as an academic field of study under the leadership of [[Donn F. Draeger]].<ref name=\"hacc1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hoplology.com/articles_detail.asp?id=9|title=Hoplology and Combative Culture: Part 1|accessdate=2009-03-07|last=Wiley|first=Mark V.|publisher=The International Hoplology Society}}</ref>\n\nHoplology was at some time defined as the science of \"arms and weapons of offense and defence, human and bestial\" (Burton, 1884),<ref>Richard Francis Burton - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MGmbAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=History+of+swords&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMI6e-j2pL8xgIVAu8UCh2lYglG#v=onepage&q=History%20of%20swords&f=false The Book of the Sword: A History of Daggers, Sabers, and Scimitars from Ancient Times to the Modern Day - 7th page of ''Chapter 1 - Preamble: on the Origin of Weapons''] published by [[Skyhorse Publishing]], Inc. 20 November 2013, 336 pages, {{ISBN|1628738472}} [Retrieved 2015-07-27]</ref> and subsequently as \"the study of the basis, patterns, relationships, and significances of combative behavior at all levels of social complexity\" (Draeger, 1982).<ref name=\"hoplology.com\">International Hoplology Society - [http://www.hoplology.com/about.htm home-page] published by the International Hoplology Society, Inc. 1998-2007</ref>\n\nSid Campbell, a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] level, [[tenth dan]]-ranked in [[karate]], defines hoplology as \"the study of the evolution and development of human combatitive behaviour and performance ... the study of how people fight, why they fight, and how different cultures manifest those behaviours.\"<ref>Sid Campbell - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZHdRcezT3bwC&pg=PA184&dq=hoplology&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAzgeahUKEwitmv7B2YHHAhVC1hQKHUIMDg8#v=onepage&q=hoplology&f=false Warrior Arts and Weapons of Ancient Hawai'i] Blue Snake Books 2006, 266 pages, {{ISBN|1583941606}} [Retrieved 2015-07-30]</ref>\n\nMore recently, hoplology is defined as the investigation and analysis of all forms of armed combat. It is most productively seen as an embodied event where the physiological and neurological structures of those individuals taking part in a combative encounter shape and, in turn, are shaped by cultural norms of what is right, effective, and efficient and so changes overtime and across space. As in all human encounters, every combat event is accompanied by a form of material technology and has been learned through a process of apprenticeship.\n\n==Warriors, Scholars, Explorers and their Hoplologies  ==\nSeveral pioneering Anthropologists were also contributing to the field of Hoplology while Burton was active.\u00a0 A retired military officer who fought in the Crimean War, A.H.L. Pitt-Rivers developed a now outdated view of human evolution.\u00a0 Cultures, he concluded, evolved through time from technologically simpler societies to technologically complex societies. In other words, progress is an integral aspect of human history. Primitive Warfare 2. Oxford: The Journal of the Royal United Service Institution Vol. XII 1868 NO. LI. Working in the Trobriand Islands (just off Australia) around the time of WWI, the renowned Anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski also delved into the field of Hoplology. \"War and Weapons Among the Natives of the Trobriand Islands\". Man. Vol. 20 pg.10-12 (1920).\n\nHoplology has always had a theoretical and practical orientation. Seeking to introduce more effective forms of close quarter combat to British soldiers Burton wrote two instructional manuals \u201c A Complete System of Bayonet Fighting.\u201d London: William Clowes and Sons. 1853. And \u201cA New System of Sword exercise for Infantry.\u201d London: William Clowes and Sons.1876. while the memoir by the ex-Hussar F.J Norman\u2019s\u00a0 \u201cThe Fighting Man of Japan: the training and exercise of the samurai.\u201d London: Archibald Constable & CO.\n\nDuring the post WWII era the International Hoplology Society (\"IHS\") was established by Major Donn F. Draeger (USMC Ret.) to study the evolution and development of human combative behavior. Draeger had prior research and personal experience of classical fighting systems. Draeger's student and colleague, Hunter B. Armstrong, went on to carry on Draeger's project as director of IHS. He continues closely with military and law enforcement, and has been central to the most recent recreation of the [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program]] (MCMAP). Also, during this time working with Basil Richardson of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Roald Knutsen's wrote \"Japanese Spear: Polearms and Their Use in Old Japan\" (1963). Here he not only described the morphology of these weapons but explored how they were used by different schools or \u201cryu.\u201d<ref>Masters Magazine Spring 2019 pg 35</ref>. \n\nDuring the 1970's, The Republic of China began a number of\u00a0 academically based (and often government funded) investigations into several folk combat traditions.\u00a0 One drawback to many of these works is that they have yet to be translated in English, limiting the exposure of their findings.\u00a0 In other cases, they were inspired by ethno-nationalist or ideological considerations and no real effort has been made to engage with the growing international literature on Martial Arts Studies. \n\nMore recently Anthropologists and other scholars have begun increasingly to examine how local people actually fight with weapons. Ethnographies such as Michael Ryan's [https://www.amazon.com/Venezuelan-Stick-Fighting-Civilizing-Process/dp/1498533205 Venezuelan Stick Fighting: The Civilizing Process in Martial Arts (2016)]. Philip Forde\u2019s recently completed doctoral dissertation \u201cBlocking both Hand and Foot: An Examination of Bajan Sticklicking\u201d (2018) is another informative work.

Immersion Projects continue to lead multiple expeditions, sponsor symposiums and launched a new journal<ref>The Immersion Review, www.TheImmersionMedia.com/review</ref> focused on the study of combat.\n\n==Overview==\nHoplology encompasses the segment of human culture concerned with weapons, armor, combative accoutrements and fighting systems, in regard to their technical characteristics and the ways in which they interact with the economic, political, social and religious institutions of human societies, and  has three main research areas: technological, functional, and behavioral.\n\n* Technological hoplology studies the development of weapons, armor, and other combative tools in relation to the contexts in which they are created.\n*Functional hoplology delves into the structure, development, and organization of combative systems and their relationship to the application of fighting and weapons.\n* Behavioral hoplology encompasses the psychological and physiological factors that affect human\u2019s combative behavior and development of combative capabilities such as weapons or fighting systems.

It is most productively seen as an embodied event where the physiological and neurological structures of those individuals taking part in a combative encounter shape and, in turn, are shaped by cultural norms of what is right, effective, and efficient and so changes overtime and across space. As in all human encounters, every combat event is accompanied by a form of material technology and has been learned through a process of apprenticeship.\n\n==Warriors, Scholars, Explorers and their Hoplologies  ==\nSeveral pioneering Anthropologists were also contributing to the field of Hoplology while Burton was active.\u00a0 A retired military officer who fought in the Crimean War, A.H.L. Pitt-Rivers developed a now outdated view of human evolution.\u00a0 Cultures, he concluded, evolved through time from technologically simpler societies to technologically complex societies. In other words, progress is an integral aspect of human history. Primitive Warfare 2. Oxford: The Journal of the Royal United Service Institution Vol. XII 1868 NO. LI. Working in the Trobriand Islands (just off Australia) around the time of WWI, the renowned Anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski also delved into the field of Hoplology. \"War and Weapons Among the Natives of the Trobriand Islands\". Man. Vol. 20 pg.10-12 (1920).\n\nHoplology has always had a theoretical and practical orientation. Seeking to introduce more effective forms of close quarter combat to British soldiers Burton wrote two instructional manuals \u201c A Complete System of Bayonet Fighting.\u201d London: William Clowes and Sons. 1853. And \u201cA New System of Sword exercise for Infantry.\u201d London: William Clowes and Sons.1876. while the memoir by the ex-Hussar F.J Norman\u2019s\u00a0 \u201cThe Fighting Man of Japan: the training and exercise of the samurai.\u201d London: Archibald Constable & CO.\n\nDuring the post WWII era the International Hoplology Society (\"IHS\") was established by Major Donn F. Draeger (USMC Ret.) to study the evolution and development of human combative behavior. Draeger had prior research and personal experience of classical fighting systems. Draeger's student and colleague, Hunter B. Armstrong, went on to carry on Draeger's project as director of IHS. He continues closely with military and law enforcement, and has been central to the most recent recreation of the [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program]] (MCMAP). Also, during this time working with Basil Richardson of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Roald Knutsen's wrote \"Japanese Spear: Polearms and Their Use in Old Japan\" (1963). Here he not only described the morphology of these weapons but explored how they were used by different schools or \u201cryu.\u201d<ref>Masters Magazine Spring 2019 pg 35</ref>. \n\nDuring the 1970's, The Republic of China began a number of\u00a0 academically based (and often government funded) investigations into several folk combat traditions.\u00a0 One drawback to many of these works is that they have yet to be translated in English, limiting the exposure of their findings.\u00a0 In other cases, they were inspired by ethno-nationalist or ideological considerations and no real effort has been made to engage with the growing international literature on Martial Arts Studies. \n\nMore recently Anthropologists and other scholars have begun increasingly to examine how local people actually fight with weapons.

The dates and the places of her birth and death are unknown.\n\n== History ==\nThrough her mother, Kira Maria was a granddaughter of [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]] and [[Irene Komnene of Epirus]]. She was also the sister of tsar [[Ivan Asen III]], who seized the [[Bulgaria]]n throne in 1280 with Byzantine support.\n\nShe married the Bulgaro-[[Cumans|Cuman]] nobleman [[George I of Bulgaria|George Terter]] in a marriage arranged by her brother in order to strengthen his position. George divorced his first wife, [[Maria Terter|Maria]], and sent her and their son, [[Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria|Theodore Svetoslav]], as hostages to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. He was accordingly made a ''[[despot\u0113s]]'', the highest rank in the Byzantino-Bulgarian court hierarchy, and Kira Maria was granted the title of ''despoina''.\n\nIvan Asen III failed to assert himself throughout the country and he secretly fled [[Tarnovo]] in 1280 and escaped to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. George Terter seized the throne and Kira Maria was proclaimed the new ''[[tsarina]]''.\n\nHowever, she was very unpopular in [[Tarnovo]], because of her deposed brother. Her marriage also proved to be controversial as Maria Terter was still alive in [[Constantinople]]. According to the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] George's first marriage was still valid and Kira Maria was his uncanonical wife. [[Patriarch]] [[Joachim III of Bulgaria|Yoakim III of Bulgaria]] threatened to excommunicate the couple and insisted that he would not relent until George I Terter put away Kira Maria.

She was the daughter of [[tsar]] [[Mitso Asen of Bulgaria]] and his wife [[Maria Asenina of Bulgaria|Maria]]. The dates and the places of her birth and death are unknown.\n\n== History ==\nThrough her mother, Kira Maria was a granddaughter of [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]] and [[Irene Komnene of Epirus]]. She was also the sister of tsar [[Ivan Asen III]], who seized the [[Bulgaria]]n throne in 1280 with Byzantine support.\n\nShe married the Bulgaro-[[Cumans|Cuman]] nobleman [[George I of Bulgaria|George Terter]] in a marriage arranged by her brother in order to strengthen his position. George divorced his first wife, [[Maria Terter|Maria]], and sent her and their son, [[Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria|Theodore Svetoslav]], as hostages to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. He was accordingly made a ''[[despot\u0113s]]'', the highest rank in the Byzantino-Bulgarian court hierarchy, and Kira Maria was granted the title of ''despoina''.\n\nIvan Asen III failed to assert himself throughout the country and he secretly fled [[Tarnovo]] in 1280 and escaped to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. George Terter seized the throne and Kira Maria was proclaimed the new ''[[tsarina]]''.\n\nHowever, she was very unpopular in [[Tarnovo]], because of her deposed brother. Her marriage also proved to be controversial as Maria Terter was still alive in [[Constantinople]]. According to the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] George's first marriage was still valid and Kira Maria was his uncanonical wife. [[Patriarch]] [[Joachim III of Bulgaria|Yoakim III of Bulgaria]] threatened to excommunicate the couple and insisted that he would not relent until George I Terter put away Kira Maria. The tsar re-opened negotiations with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and sought the return of Maria, what he eventually accomplished in a treaty in which Maria and Kira Maria exchanged places as empress and hostage.\n\n== Children ==\nAccording to [[Georgius Pachymeres]] [[Ana Terter]], wife of [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian king]] [[Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin of Serbia|Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin]], was the daughter of Kira Maria and George Terter.<ref>Georgius Pachymeres.

The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols ([[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]]) is an activity of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. To maintain interoperability, the principal [[name space]]s of the Internet are administered by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN). ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. ICANN coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including [[domain name]]s, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. Globally unified name spaces are essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet.

As with any computer network, the Internet physically consists of [[router (computing)|router]]s, media (such as cabling and radio links), repeaters, modems etc. However, as an example of [[internetworking]], many of the network nodes are not necessarily internet equipment per se, the internet packets are carried by other full-fledged networking protocols with the Internet acting as a homogeneous networking standard, running across [[heterogeneous]] hardware, with the packets guided to their destinations by IP routers.\n\n=== Routing and service tiers ===\n[[File:Internet Connectivity Distribution & Core.svg|thumb|Packet routing across the Internet involves several tiers of Internet service providers.]]\n\n[[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) establish the worldwide connectivity between individual networks at various levels of scope. End-users who only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information, represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy. At the top of the routing hierarchy are the [[tier 1 network]]s, large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via very high speed [[fibre optic cable]]s and governed by [[peering]] agreements. [[Tier 2 network|Tier 2]] and lower level networks buy [[Internet transit]] from other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in peering. An ISP may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implement [[multihoming]] to achieve redundancy and load balancing. [[Internet exchange point]]s are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs. Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks. Research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such as [[GEANT]], [[GLORIAD]], [[Internet2]], and the UK's [[national research and education network]], [[JANET]]. Both the Internet IP routing structure and hypertext links of the World Wide Web are examples of [[scale-free network]]s.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last=A. L. Barab'asi\n |first=R.

This is a model architecture that divides methods into a [[Communication protocol#Layering|layered system of protocols]], originally documented in {{IETF RFC|1122}} and {{IETF RFC|1123}}.\n\n===Layers===\nThe software layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. At the top is the [[application layer]], space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications. For example, a web browser program uses the [[client-server]] application model and a specific protocol of interaction between servers and clients, while many file-sharing systems use a [[peer-to-peer]] paradigm.\n\nBelow this top layer, the [[transport layer]] connects applications on different hosts with a logical channel through the network with appropriate data exchange methods. It provides several services including ordered, reliable delivery (TCP), and an unreliable datagram service (UDP).\n\nUnderlying these layers are the networking technologies that interconnect networks at their borders and exchange traffic across them. The [[Internet layer]] implements the [[Internet Protocol]] which enables computers to identify and locate each other by [[IP address|Internet Protocol (IP) addresses]], and route their traffic via intermediate (transit) networks.<ref>RFC 791, ''Internet Protocol, DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification'', Information Sciences Institute, Sept. 1981</ref> The internet protocol layer code is independent of the type of network that it is physically running over.\n\nAt the bottom of the architecture is the [[link layer]], which provides logical connectivity between hosts. The link layer code is usually the only software part customized to the type of physical networking link protocol. Many link layers have been implemented and each operates over a type of network link, such as within a [[local area network]] (LAN) or [[wide area network]] (e.g. [[Wi-Fi]] or [[Ethernet]] or a [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up connection]], [[Asynchronous transfer mode|ATM]] etc.).\n\n[[File:UDP encapsulation.svg|thumb|As user data is processed through the protocol stack, each abstraction layer adds encapsulation information at the sending host. Data is transmitted ''over the wire'' at the link level between hosts and routers. Encapsulation is removed by the receiving host. Intermediate relays update link encapsulation at each hop, and inspect the IP layer for routing purposes.]]\n\n===Internet protocol===\n[[Image:IP stack connections.svg|thumb|Conceptual data flow in a simple network topology of two hosts (''A'' and ''B'') connected by a link between their respective routers. The application on each host executes read and write operations as if the processes were directly connected to each other by some kind of data pipe. After establishment of this pipe, most details of the communication are hidden from each process, as the underlying principles of communication are implemented in the lower protocol layers. In analogy, at the transport layer the communication appears as host-to-host, without knowledge of the application data structures and the connecting routers, while at the internetworking layer, individual network boundaries are traversed at each router.]]\nThe most prominent component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP). IP enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the Internet itself. Two versions of the Internet Protocol exist, IPV4 and IPV6.\n\n====IP Addresses====\n[[File:An example of theoretical DNS recursion.svg|right|thumb|A DNS resolver consults three name servers to resolve the domain name user-visible \"www.wikipedia.org\" to determine the IPV4 Address 207.142.131.234]]\nFor locating individual computers on the network, the Internet provides [[IP address]]es. IP addresses are used by the Internet infrastructure to direct internet packets to their destinations. They consist of fixed-length numbers, which are found within the packet. IP addresses are generally assigned to equipment either automatically via [[DHCP]], or are configured.\n\nHowever the network also supports other addressing systems. Users generally enter [[fully qualified domain name|domain name]]s (e.g. \"en.wikipedia.org\") instead of IP addresses because they are easier to remember, they are converted by the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) into IP addresses which are more efficient for routing purposes.\n\n====IPv4====\n[[IPv4|Internet Protocol version 4]] (IPv4) defines an IP address as a [[32-bit]] number.<ref name=rfc791>{{Cite IETF|rfc=791|title=Internet Protocol, DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification|editor=[[Jon Postel|J.

It was designed to address up to \u22484.3 billion (10<sup>9</sup>) hosts. However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to [[IPv4 address exhaustion]], which entered its final stage in 2011,<ref>{{cite web|last=Huston |first=Geoff |title=IPv4 Address Report, daily generated |url=http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html |accessdate=20 May 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401001902/http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html |archivedate=1 April 2009 |df= }}</ref> when the global IPv4 address allocation pool was exhausted.\n\n====IPv6====\nBecause of the growth of the Internet and the [[IPv4 address exhaustion|depletion of available IPv4 addresses]], a new version of IP [[IPv6]], was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic.

In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4 software. Thus, translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., [[peering agreement]]s, and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the exchange of data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.\n\n====Subnetwork====\n[[File:Subnetting Concept-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Creating a subnet by dividing the host identifier]]\nA ''[[subnetwork]]'' or ''subnet'' is a logical subdivision of an [[IP network]].<ref name=\"rfc950\">{{Cite IETF\n    | rfc         = 950\n    | publisher   = [[IETF]]\n    | author1     = Jeffrey Mogul\n    | author2     = Jon Postel\n    | authorlink2 = Jon Postel\n    | title       = Internet Standard Subnetting Procedure\n    | date        = August 1985\n  }} Updated by RFC 6918.</ref>{{rp|1,16}} The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called ''subnetting''.\n\nComputers that belong to a subnet are addressed with an identical [[most-significant bit]]-group in their [[IP address]]es. This results in the logical division of an IP address into two fields, the ''network number'' or ''routing prefix'' and the ''rest field'' or ''host identifier''. The ''rest field'' is an identifier for a specific [[Host (network)|host]] or network interface.\n\nThe ''routing prefix'' may be expressed in [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) notation written as the first address of a network, followed by a slash character (''/''), and ending with the bit-length of the prefix. For example, {{IPaddr|198.51.100.0|24}} is the prefix of the [[Internet Protocol version 4]] network starting at the given address, having 24 bits allocated for the network prefix, and the remaining 8 bits reserved for host addressing. Addresses in the range {{IPaddr|198.51.100.0}} to {{IPaddr|198.51.100.255}} belong to this network. The [[IPv6]] address specification {{IPaddr|2001:db8::|32}} is a large address block with 2<sup>96</sup> addresses, having a 32-bit routing prefix.\n\nFor IPv4, a network may also be characterized by its ''subnet mask'' or ''netmask'', which is the [[bitmask]] that when applied by a [[bitwise AND]] operation to any IP address in the network, yields the routing prefix. Subnet masks are also expressed in [[dot-decimal notation]] like an address. For example, {{IPaddr|255.255.255.0}} is the subnet mask for the prefix {{IPaddr|198.51.100.0|24}}.\n\nTraffic is exchanged between subnetworks through [[router (computing)|routers]] when the routing prefixes of the source address and the destination address differ. A router serves as a logical or physical boundary between the subnets.\n\nThe benefits of subnetting an existing network vary with each deployment scenario. In the address allocation architecture of the Internet using CIDR and in large organizations, it is necessary to allocate address space efficiently. Subnetting may also enhance routing efficiency, or have advantages in network management when subnetworks are administratively controlled by different entities in a larger organization.  Subnets may be arranged logically in a hierarchical architecture, partitioning an organization's network address space into a tree-like routing structure.\n\n===IETF===\nWhile the hardware components in the Internet infrastructure can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the standardization process of the software that characterizes the Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success. The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been assumed by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/ |title=IETF Home Page |publisher=Ietf.org |accessdate=20 June 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618032558/http://www.ietf.org/ |archivedate=18 June 2009 |df= }}</ref> The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture. Resulting contributions and standards are published as ''[[Request for Comments]]'' (RFC) documents on the IETF web site.

Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies.\n\n== Applications and services ==\nThe Internet carries many [[network service|applications and services]], most prominently the [[World Wide Web]], including [[social media]], [[electronic mail]], [[mobile app]]lications, [[multiplayer online game]]s, [[Internet telephony]], [[file sharing]], and [[streaming media]] services.\n\nMost [[Server (computing)|servers]] that provide these services are today hosted in [[data center]]s, and content is often accessed through high-performance [[content delivery network]]s.\n\n=== World Wide Web ===\n[[File:First Web Server.jpg|thumb|This [[NeXT Computer]] was used by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] at [[CERN]] and became the world's first [[Web server]].]]\n\nThe [[World Wide Web]] is a global collection of [[documents]], [[Computer graphics|images]], [[multimedia]], applications, and other resources, logically interrelated by [[hyperlink]]s and referenced with [[Uniform Resource Identifier]]s (URIs), which provide a global system of named references. URIs symbolically identify services, [[web servers]], databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide. [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web. [[Web service]]s also use HTTP for communication between software systems for information transfer, sharing and exchanging business data and logistic and is one of many languages or protocols that can be used for communication on the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/Web_vs_Internet.asp |title=The Difference Between the Internet and the World Wide Web |publisher=QuinStreet Inc. |work=Webopedia.com |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2014-05-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502001005/http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/Web_vs_Internet.asp |archivedate=2 May 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nWorld Wide Web browser software, such as [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Explorer]]/[[Microsoft Edge|Edge]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], and [[Google Chrome]], lets users navigate from one web page to another via the hyperlinks embedded in the documents.

[[Client-side scripting|Client-side software]] can include animations, [[web game|games]], [[office applications]] and scientific demonstrations. Through [[keyword (Internet search)|keyword]]-driven [[Internet research]] using [[Web search engine|search engines]] like [[Yahoo! Search|Yahoo!]], [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] and [[Google Search|Google]], users worldwide have easy, instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information. Compared to printed media, books, encyclopedias and traditional libraries, the World Wide Web has enabled the decentralization of information on a large scale.\n\nThe Web has enabled individuals and organizations to [[publish]] ideas and information to a potentially large [[audience]] online at greatly reduced expense and time delay. Publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves little initial [[cost]] and many cost-free services are available. However, publishing and maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition. Many individuals and some companies and groups use ''web logs'' or blogs, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries. Some commercial organizations encourage [[employees|staff]] to communicate advice in their areas of specialization in the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result.\n\n[[Online advertising|Advertising]] on popular web pages can be lucrative, and [[e-commerce]], which is the sale of products and services directly via the Web, continues to grow. Online advertising is a form of [[marketing]] and advertising which uses the Internet to deliver [[promotion (marketing)|promotional]] marketing messages to consumers.  It includes email marketing, [[search engine marketing]] (SEM), social media marketing, many types of [[display advertising]] (including [[web banner]] advertising), and [[mobile advertising]]. In 2011, Internet advertising revenues in the United States surpassed those of [[cable television]] and nearly exceeded those of [[broadcast television]].<ref name=\"IAB2012\">{{cite web |url = http://www.iab.net/media/file/IAB_Internet_Advertising_Revenue_Report_FY_2012_rev.pdf |title = IAB Internet advertising revenue report: 2012 full year results |date = April 2013 |publisher = PricewaterhouseCoopers, Internet Advertising Bureau |accessdate = 12 June 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141004001439/http://www.iab.net/media/file/IAB_Internet_Advertising_Revenue_Report_FY_2012_rev.pdf |archive-date = 4 October 2014 |url-status = live }}</ref>{{rp|19}} Many common online advertising practices are controversial and increasingly subject to regulation.\n\nWhen the Web developed in the 1990s, a typical web page was stored in completed form on a web server, formatted in [[HTML]], complete for transmission to a web browser in response to a request. Over time, the process of creating and serving web pages has become dynamic, creating a flexible design, layout, and content. Websites are often created using [[content management]] software with, initially, very little content. Contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of an organization or the public, fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose while casual visitors view and read this content in HTML form. There may or may not be editorial, approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it available to the target visitors.\n\n=== Communication ===\n[[Email]] is an important communications service available on the Internet. The concept of sending electronic text messages between parties in a way analogous to mailing letters or memos predates the creation of the Internet.<ref>Ron Brown, Fax invades the mail market, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&pg=PA218 New Scientist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509050238/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&pg=PA218 |date=2016-05-09 }}, Vol. 56, No. 817 (Oct., 26, 1972), pp. 218\u201321.</ref><ref>Herbert P.

Emails can be [[Carbon copy|cc-ed]] to multiple [[email address]]es.\n\n[[Internet telephony]] is another common communications service made possible by the creation of the Internet. [[VoIP]] stands for Voice-over-[[Internet Protocol]], referring to the protocol that underlies all Internet communication. The idea began in the early 1990s with [[walkie-talkie]]-like voice applications for personal computers. In recent years many VoIP systems have become as easy to use and as convenient as a normal telephone. The benefit is that, as the Internet carries the voice traffic, VoIP can be free or cost much less than a traditional telephone call, especially over long distances and especially for those with always-on Internet connections such as [[Cable modem|cable]] or [[ADSL]] and [[mobile data]].<ref name=EBSCOhost>{{cite journal|last=Booth|first=C|title=Chapter 2: IP Phones, Software VoIP, and Integrated and Mobile VoIP|journal=Library Technology Reports|year=2010|volume=46|issue=5|pages=11\u201319}}</ref> VoIP is maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service. Interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available. Simple, inexpensive VoIP network adapters are available that eliminate the need for a personal computer.\n\nVoice quality can still vary from call to call, but is often equal to and can even exceed that of traditional calls. Remaining problems for VoIP include [[emergency telephone number]] dialing and reliability. Currently,{{When|date=March 2020}} a few VoIP providers provide an emergency service, but it is not universally available. Older traditional phones with no \"extra features\" may be line-powered only and operate during a power failure; VoIP can never do so without a [[uninterruptible power supply|backup power source]] for the phone equipment and the Internet access devices. VoIP has also become increasingly popular for gaming applications, as a form of communication between players. Popular VoIP clients for gaming include [[Ventrilo]] and [[Teamspeak]]. Modern video game consoles also offer VoIP chat features.\n\n=== Data transfer ===\n[[File sharing]] is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet. A [[computer file]] can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) server for easy download by others. It can be put into a \"shared location\" or onto a [[file server]] for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of \"[[Web mirror|mirror]]\" servers or [[peer-to-peer]] networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user [[authentication]], the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by [[encryption]], and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed \u2013 usually fully encrypted \u2013 across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by [[digital signature]]s or by [[MD5]] or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.\n\n[[Streaming media]] is the real-time delivery of digital media for the immediate consumption or enjoyment by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet \"broadcasters\" who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access on-line media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical [[webcast]]s to on-demand popular multimedia services. [[Podcast]]ing is a variation on this theme, where \u2013 usually audio \u2013 material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a [[portable media player]] to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.\n\nDigital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth.  For example, standard image quality needs 1 Mbit/s link speed for SD 480p, HD 720p quality requires 2.5 Mbit/s, and the top-of-the-line HDX quality needs 4.5 Mbit/s for 1080p.<ref>{{cite web |last=Morrison |first=Geoff |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40241749 |title=What to know before buying a 'connected' TV \u2013 Technology & science \u2013 Tech and gadgets \u2013 Tech Holiday Guide |publisher=NBC News |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |df= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212091603/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40241749 |archive-date=12 February 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Webcam]]s are a low-cost extension of this phenomenon. While some webcams can give full-frame-rate video, the picture either is usually small or updates slowly. Internet users can watch animals around an African waterhole, ships in the [[Panama Canal]], traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises, live and in real time.

The Internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through [[mobile Internet device]]s. Mobile phones, [[datacard]]s, [[handheld game console]]s and [[cellular router]]s allow users to connect to the Internet [[wireless]]ly. Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, the services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available. Service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.\n\nEducational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from websites. Examples range from [[CBeebies]], through school and high-school revision guides and [[Virtual university|virtual universities]], to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of [[Google Scholar]]. For [[distance education]], help with [[homework]] and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time, or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, it has never been easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere. The Internet in general and the [[World Wide Web]] in particular are important enablers of both [[Education|formal]] and [[informal education]]. Further, the Internet allows universities, in particular, researchers from the social and behavioral sciences, to conduct research remotely via virtual laboratories, with profound changes in reach and generalizability of findings as well as in communication between scientists and in the publication of results.<ref>Reips, U.-D.

Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups more easily to form. An example of this is the [[free software movement]], which has produced, among other things, [[Linux]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], and [[OpenOffice.org]] (later forked into [[LibreOffice]]). Internet chat, whether using an [[IRC]] chat room, an [[instant messaging]] system, or a [[social networking]] website, allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day.  Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via email. These systems may allow files to be exchanged, drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team members.\n\n[[Content management]] systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents simultaneously without accidentally destroying each other's work. Business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other information. Such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including scientific research, software development, conference planning, political activism and creative writing. Social and political collaboration is also becoming more widespread as both Internet access and [[computer literacy]] spread.\n\nThe Internet allows computer users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with [[computer security]], i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, depending on the requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can [[audit]] the books of a company based in another country, on a [[server (computing)|server]] situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before the widespread use of the Internet, but the cost of private [[leased line]]s would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps on the other side of the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using [[cloud computing]], or open a [[Remote Desktop Protocol|remote desktop]] session into their office PC using a secure [[virtual private network]] (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among [[system administrator]]s as the Virtual Private Nightmare,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Virtual Private Nightmare: VPN |url=http://librenix.com/?inode=5013 |publisher=Librenix |accessdate=21 July 2010 |date=4 August 2004 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515152637/http://librenix.com/?inode=5013 |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df= }}</ref> because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.\n\n=== Social networking and entertainment ===\n{{See also|Social networking service#Social impact}}\nMany people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book vacations and to pursue their personal interests. People use [[online chat|chat]], messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had [[pen pal]]s. [[Social network service|Social networking]] websites such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Myspace]] have created new ways to socialize and interact. Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, to pursue common interests, and to connect with others. It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people. Sites like [[LinkedIn]] foster commercial and business connections. YouTube and [[Flickr]] specialize in users' videos and photographs. While social networking sites were initially for individuals only, today they are widely used by businesses and other organizations to promote their brands, to market to their customers and to encourage posts to \"[[Viral marketing|go viral]]\". \"Black hat\" social media techniques are also employed by some organizations, such as [[Spamming|spam]] accounts and [[astroturfing]].\n\nA risk for both individuals and organizations writing posts (especially public posts) on social networking websites, is that especially foolish or controversial posts occasionally lead to an unexpected and possibly large-scale backlash on social media from other Internet users. This is also a risk in relation to controversial ''offline'' behavior, if it is widely made known. The nature of this backlash can range widely from counter-arguments and public mockery, through insults and [[hate speech]], to, in extreme cases, rape and death [[Computer crime#Threats|threats]]. The [[online disinhibition effect]] describes the tendency of many individuals to behave more stridently or offensively online than they would in person. A significant number of [[feminist]] women have been the target of various forms of [[harassment]] in response to posts they have made on social media, and Twitter in particular has been criticised in the past for not doing enough to aid victims of online abuse.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23477130 |title=Twitter 'report abuse' button calls after rape threats |last=Moore |first=Keith |date=27 July 2013 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=7 December 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904014545/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23477130 |archivedate=4 September 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nFor organizations, such a backlash can cause overall [[public relations|brand damage]], especially if reported by the media. However, this is not always the case, as any brand damage in the eyes of people with an opposing opinion to that presented by the organization could sometimes be outweighed by strengthening the brand in the eyes of others. Furthermore, if an organization or individual gives in to demands that others perceive as wrong-headed, that can then provoke a counter-backlash.\n\nSome websites, such as [[Reddit]], have rules forbidding the posting of [[personal information]] of individuals (also known as [[doxxing]]), due to concerns about such postings leading to mobs of large numbers of Internet users directing harassment at the specific individuals thereby identified. In particular, the Reddit rule forbidding the posting of personal information is widely understood to imply that all identifying photos and names must be [[censored]] in Facebook [[screenshots]] posted to Reddit. However, the interpretation of this rule in relation to public Twitter posts is less clear, and in any case, like-minded people online have many other ways they can use to direct each other's attention to public social media posts they disagree with.\n\nChildren also face dangers online such as [[cyberbullying]] and [[Child grooming|approaches by sexual predators]], who sometimes pose as children themselves. Children may also encounter material which they may find upsetting, or material which their parents consider to be not age-appropriate. Due to naivety, they may also post personal information about themselves online, which could put them or their families at risk unless warned not to do so. Many parents choose to enable [[Content-control software|Internet filtering]], and/or supervise their children's online activities, in an attempt to protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet. The most popular social networking websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, commonly forbid users under the age of 13. However, these policies are typically trivial to circumvent by registering an account with a false birth date, and a significant number of children aged under 13 join such sites anyway. Social networking sites for younger children, which claim to provide better levels of protection for children, also exist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2010/10/11/social-networks-children/ |title=5 Fun and Safe Social Networks for Children |date=11 October 2010 |accessdate=7 December 2014 |website=[[Mashable]] |last=Kessler |first=Sarah |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220082237/http://mashable.com/2010/10/11/social-networks-children/ |archivedate=20 December 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe Internet has been a major outlet for leisure activity since its inception, with entertaining [[social experiment]]s such as [[MUD]]s and [[MOO]]s being conducted on university servers, and humor-related [[Usenet]] groups receiving much traffic.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Many [[Internet forums]] have sections devoted to games and funny videos.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The [[Internet pornography]] and [[online gambling]] industries have taken advantage of the World Wide Web.

The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols ([[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]]) is an activity of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. To maintain interoperability, the principal [[name space]]s of the Internet are administered by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN). ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. ICANN coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including [[domain name]]s, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters.

As with any computer network, the Internet physically consists of [[router (computing)|router]]s, media (such as cabling and radio links), repeaters, modems etc. However, as an example of [[internetworking]], many of the network nodes are not necessarily internet equipment per se, the internet packets are carried by other full-fledged networking protocols with the Internet acting as a homogeneous networking standard, running across [[heterogeneous]] hardware, with the packets guided to their destinations by IP routers.\n\n=== Routing and service tiers ===\n[[File:Internet Connectivity Distribution & Core.svg|thumb|Packet routing across the Internet involves several tiers of Internet service providers.]]\n\n[[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) establish the worldwide connectivity between individual networks at various levels of scope. End-users who only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information, represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy. At the top of the routing hierarchy are the [[tier 1 network]]s, large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via very high speed [[fibre optic cable]]s and governed by [[peering]] agreements. [[Tier 2 network|Tier 2]] and lower level networks buy [[Internet transit]] from other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in peering. An ISP may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implement [[multihoming]] to achieve redundancy and load balancing. [[Internet exchange point]]s are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs. Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks. Research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such as [[GEANT]], [[GLORIAD]], [[Internet2]], and the UK's [[national research and education network]], [[JANET]]. Both the Internet IP routing structure and hypertext links of the World Wide Web are examples of [[scale-free network]]s.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last=A. L. Barab'asi\n |first=R.

This is a model architecture that divides methods into a [[Communication protocol#Layering|layered system of protocols]], originally documented in {{IETF RFC|1122}} and {{IETF RFC|1123}}.\n\n===Layers===\nThe software layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. At the top is the [[application layer]], space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications. For example, a web browser program uses the [[client-server]] application model and a specific protocol of interaction between servers and clients, while many file-sharing systems use a [[peer-to-peer]] paradigm.\n\nBelow this top layer, the [[transport layer]] connects applications on different hosts with a logical channel through the network with appropriate data exchange methods. It provides several services including ordered, reliable delivery (TCP), and an unreliable datagram service (UDP).\n\nUnderlying these layers are the networking technologies that interconnect networks at their borders and exchange traffic across them. The [[Internet layer]] implements the [[Internet Protocol]] which enables computers to identify and locate each other by [[IP address|Internet Protocol (IP) addresses]], and route their traffic via intermediate (transit) networks.<ref>RFC 791, ''Internet Protocol, DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification'', Information Sciences Institute, Sept. 1981</ref> The internet protocol layer code is independent of the type of network that it is physically running over.\n\nAt the bottom of the architecture is the [[link layer]], which provides logical connectivity between hosts. The link layer code is usually the only software part customized to the type of physical networking link protocol. Many link layers have been implemented and each operates over a type of network link, such as within a [[local area network]] (LAN) or [[wide area network]] (e.g. [[Wi-Fi]] or [[Ethernet]] or a [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up connection]], [[Asynchronous transfer mode|ATM]] etc.).\n\n[[File:UDP encapsulation.svg|thumb|As user data is processed through the protocol stack, each abstraction layer adds encapsulation information at the sending host. Data is transmitted ''over the wire'' at the link level between hosts and routers. Encapsulation is removed by the receiving host. Intermediate relays update link encapsulation at each hop, and inspect the IP layer for routing purposes.]]\n\n===Internet protocol===\n[[Image:IP stack connections.svg|thumb|Conceptual data flow in a simple network topology of two hosts (''A'' and ''B'') connected by a link between their respective routers. The application on each host executes read and write operations as if the processes were directly connected to each other by some kind of data pipe. After establishment of this pipe, most details of the communication are hidden from each process, as the underlying principles of communication are implemented in the lower protocol layers. In analogy, at the transport layer the communication appears as host-to-host, without knowledge of the application data structures and the connecting routers, while at the internetworking layer, individual network boundaries are traversed at each router.]]\nThe most prominent component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP). IP enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the Internet itself. Two versions of the Internet Protocol exist, IPV4 and IPV6.\n\n====IP Addresses====\n[[File:An example of theoretical DNS recursion.svg|right|thumb|A DNS resolver consults three name servers to resolve the domain name user-visible \"www.wikipedia.org\" to determine the IPV4 Address 207.142.131.234]]\nFor locating individual computers on the network, the Internet provides [[IP address]]es. IP addresses are used by the Internet infrastructure to direct internet packets to their destinations. They consist of fixed-length numbers, which are found within the packet. IP addresses are generally assigned to equipment either automatically via [[DHCP]], or are configured.\n\nHowever the network also supports other addressing systems. Users generally enter [[fully qualified domain name|domain name]]s (e.g. \"en.wikipedia.org\") instead of IP addresses because they are easier to remember, they are converted by the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) into IP addresses which are more efficient for routing purposes.\n\n====IPv4====\n[[IPv4|Internet Protocol version 4]] (IPv4) defines an IP address as a [[32-bit]] number.<ref name=rfc791>{{Cite IETF|rfc=791|title=Internet Protocol, DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification|editor=[[Jon Postel|J.

In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4 software. Thus, translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., [[peering agreement]]s, and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the exchange of data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.\n\n====Subnetwork====\n[[File:Subnetting Concept-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Creating a subnet by dividing the host identifier]]\nA ''[[subnetwork]]'' or ''subnet'' is a logical subdivision of an [[IP network]].<ref name=\"rfc950\">{{Cite IETF\n    | rfc         = 950\n    | publisher   = [[IETF]]\n    | author1     = Jeffrey Mogul\n    | author2     = Jon Postel\n    | authorlink2 = Jon Postel\n    | title       = Internet Standard Subnetting Procedure\n    | date        = August 1985\n  }} Updated by RFC 6918.</ref>{{rp|1,16}} The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called ''subnetting''.\n\nComputers that belong to a subnet are addressed with an identical [[most-significant bit]]-group in their [[IP address]]es. This results in the logical division of an IP address into two fields, the ''network number'' or ''routing prefix'' and the ''rest field'' or ''host identifier''. The ''rest field'' is an identifier for a specific [[Host (network)|host]] or network interface.\n\nThe ''routing prefix'' may be expressed in [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) notation written as the first address of a network, followed by a slash character (''/''), and ending with the bit-length of the prefix. For example, {{IPaddr|198.51.100.0|24}} is the prefix of the [[Internet Protocol version 4]] network starting at the given address, having 24 bits allocated for the network prefix, and the remaining 8 bits reserved for host addressing. Addresses in the range {{IPaddr|198.51.100.0}} to {{IPaddr|198.51.100.255}} belong to this network. The [[IPv6]] address specification {{IPaddr|2001:db8::|32}} is a large address block with 2<sup>96</sup> addresses, having a 32-bit routing prefix.\n\nFor IPv4, a network may also be characterized by its ''subnet mask'' or ''netmask'', which is the [[bitmask]] that when applied by a [[bitwise AND]] operation to any IP address in the network, yields the routing prefix. Subnet masks are also expressed in [[dot-decimal notation]] like an address. For example, {{IPaddr|255.255.255.0}} is the subnet mask for the prefix {{IPaddr|198.51.100.0|24}}.\n\nTraffic is exchanged between subnetworks through [[router (computing)|routers]] when the routing prefixes of the source address and the destination address differ. A router serves as a logical or physical boundary between the subnets.\n\nThe benefits of subnetting an existing network vary with each deployment scenario. In the address allocation architecture of the Internet using CIDR and in large organizations, it is necessary to allocate address space efficiently. Subnetting may also enhance routing efficiency, or have advantages in network management when subnetworks are administratively controlled by different entities in a larger organization.  Subnets may be arranged logically in a hierarchical architecture, partitioning an organization's network address space into a tree-like routing structure.\n\n===IETF===\nWhile the hardware components in the Internet infrastructure can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the standardization process of the software that characterizes the Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success. The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been assumed by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/ |title=IETF Home Page |publisher=Ietf.org |accessdate=20 June 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618032558/http://www.ietf.org/ |archivedate=18 June 2009 |df= }}</ref> The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture.

Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies.\n\n== Applications and services ==\nThe Internet carries many [[network service|applications and services]], most prominently the [[World Wide Web]], including [[social media]], [[electronic mail]], [[mobile app]]lications, [[multiplayer online game]]s, [[Internet telephony]], [[file sharing]], and [[streaming media]] services.\n\nMost [[Server (computing)|servers]] that provide these services are today hosted in [[data center]]s, and content is often accessed through high-performance [[content delivery network]]s.\n\n=== World Wide Web ===\n[[File:First Web Server.jpg|thumb|This [[NeXT Computer]] was used by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] at [[CERN]] and became the world's first [[Web server]].]]\n\nThe [[World Wide Web]] is a global collection of [[documents]], [[Computer graphics|images]], [[multimedia]], applications, and other resources, logically interrelated by [[hyperlink]]s and referenced with [[Uniform Resource Identifier]]s (URIs), which provide a global system of named references. URIs symbolically identify services, [[web servers]], databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide. [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web. [[Web service]]s also use HTTP for communication between software systems for information transfer, sharing and exchanging business data and logistic and is one of many languages or protocols that can be used for communication on the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/Web_vs_Internet.asp |title=The Difference Between the Internet and the World Wide Web |publisher=QuinStreet Inc. |work=Webopedia.com |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2014-05-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502001005/http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/Web_vs_Internet.asp |archivedate=2 May 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nWorld Wide Web browser software, such as [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Explorer]]/[[Microsoft Edge|Edge]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], and [[Google Chrome]], lets users navigate from one web page to another via the hyperlinks embedded in the documents. These documents may also contain any combination of [[computer data]], including graphics, sounds, [[Plain text|text]], [[web video|video]], [[multimedia]] and interactive content that runs while the user is interacting with the page.

Through [[keyword (Internet search)|keyword]]-driven [[Internet research]] using [[Web search engine|search engines]] like [[Yahoo! Search|Yahoo!]], [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] and [[Google Search|Google]], users worldwide have easy, instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information. Compared to printed media, books, encyclopedias and traditional libraries, the World Wide Web has enabled the decentralization of information on a large scale.\n\nThe Web has enabled individuals and organizations to [[publish]] ideas and information to a potentially large [[audience]] online at greatly reduced expense and time delay. Publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves little initial [[cost]] and many cost-free services are available. However, publishing and maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition. Many individuals and some companies and groups use ''web logs'' or blogs, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries. Some commercial organizations encourage [[employees|staff]] to communicate advice in their areas of specialization in the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result.\n\n[[Online advertising|Advertising]] on popular web pages can be lucrative, and [[e-commerce]], which is the sale of products and services directly via the Web, continues to grow. Online advertising is a form of [[marketing]] and advertising which uses the Internet to deliver [[promotion (marketing)|promotional]] marketing messages to consumers.  It includes email marketing, [[search engine marketing]] (SEM), social media marketing, many types of [[display advertising]] (including [[web banner]] advertising), and [[mobile advertising]]. In 2011, Internet advertising revenues in the United States surpassed those of [[cable television]] and nearly exceeded those of [[broadcast television]].<ref name=\"IAB2012\">{{cite web |url = http://www.iab.net/media/file/IAB_Internet_Advertising_Revenue_Report_FY_2012_rev.pdf |title = IAB Internet advertising revenue report: 2012 full year results |date = April 2013 |publisher = PricewaterhouseCoopers, Internet Advertising Bureau |accessdate = 12 June 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141004001439/http://www.iab.net/media/file/IAB_Internet_Advertising_Revenue_Report_FY_2012_rev.pdf |archive-date = 4 October 2014 |url-status = live }}</ref>{{rp|19}} Many common online advertising practices are controversial and increasingly subject to regulation.\n\nWhen the Web developed in the 1990s, a typical web page was stored in completed form on a web server, formatted in [[HTML]], complete for transmission to a web browser in response to a request. Over time, the process of creating and serving web pages has become dynamic, creating a flexible design, layout, and content. Websites are often created using [[content management]] software with, initially, very little content. Contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of an organization or the public, fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose while casual visitors view and read this content in HTML form. There may or may not be editorial, approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it available to the target visitors.\n\n=== Communication ===\n[[Email]] is an important communications service available on the Internet. The concept of sending electronic text messages between parties in a way analogous to mailing letters or memos predates the creation of the Internet.<ref>Ron Brown, Fax invades the mail market, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&pg=PA218 New Scientist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509050238/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&pg=PA218 |date=2016-05-09 }}, Vol. 56, No. 817 (Oct., 26, 1972), pp. 218\u201321.</ref><ref>Herbert P. Luckett, What's News: Electronic-mail delivery gets started, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cKSqa8u3EIoC&pg=PA85 Popular Science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430021738/https://books.google.com/books?id=cKSqa8u3EIoC&pg=PA85 |date=2016-04-30 }}, Vol. 202, No. 3 (March 1973); page 85</ref> Pictures, documents, and other files are sent as [[email attachment]]s. Emails can be [[Carbon copy|cc-ed]] to multiple [[email address]]es.\n\n[[Internet telephony]] is another common communications service made possible by the creation of the Internet. [[VoIP]] stands for Voice-over-[[Internet Protocol]], referring to the protocol that underlies all Internet communication. The idea began in the early 1990s with [[walkie-talkie]]-like voice applications for personal computers. In recent years many VoIP systems have become as easy to use and as convenient as a normal telephone. The benefit is that, as the Internet carries the voice traffic, VoIP can be free or cost much less than a traditional telephone call, especially over long distances and especially for those with always-on Internet connections such as [[Cable modem|cable]] or [[ADSL]] and [[mobile data]].<ref name=EBSCOhost>{{cite journal|last=Booth|first=C|title=Chapter 2: IP Phones, Software VoIP, and Integrated and Mobile VoIP|journal=Library Technology Reports|year=2010|volume=46|issue=5|pages=11\u201319}}</ref> VoIP is maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service. Interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available. Simple, inexpensive VoIP network adapters are available that eliminate the need for a personal computer.\n\nVoice quality can still vary from call to call, but is often equal to and can even exceed that of traditional calls. Remaining problems for VoIP include [[emergency telephone number]] dialing and reliability. Currently,{{When|date=March 2020}} a few VoIP providers provide an emergency service, but it is not universally available. Older traditional phones with no \"extra features\" may be line-powered only and operate during a power failure; VoIP can never do so without a [[uninterruptible power supply|backup power source]] for the phone equipment and the Internet access devices. VoIP has also become increasingly popular for gaming applications, as a form of communication between players. Popular VoIP clients for gaming include [[Ventrilo]] and [[Teamspeak]]. Modern video game consoles also offer VoIP chat features.\n\n=== Data transfer ===\n[[File sharing]] is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet. A [[computer file]] can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) server for easy download by others. It can be put into a \"shared location\" or onto a [[file server]] for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of \"[[Web mirror|mirror]]\" servers or [[peer-to-peer]] networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user [[authentication]], the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by [[encryption]], and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed \u2013 usually fully encrypted \u2013 across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by [[digital signature]]s or by [[MD5]] or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.\n\n[[Streaming media]] is the real-time delivery of digital media for the immediate consumption or enjoyment by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet \"broadcasters\" who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access on-line media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical [[webcast]]s to on-demand popular multimedia services. [[Podcast]]ing is a variation on this theme, where \u2013 usually audio \u2013 material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a [[portable media player]] to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.\n\nDigital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth.  For example, standard image quality needs 1 Mbit/s link speed for SD 480p, HD 720p quality requires 2.5 Mbit/s, and the top-of-the-line HDX quality needs 4.5 Mbit/s for 1080p.<ref>{{cite web |last=Morrison |first=Geoff |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40241749 |title=What to know before buying a 'connected' TV \u2013 Technology & science \u2013 Tech and gadgets \u2013 Tech Holiday Guide |publisher=NBC News |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |df= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212091603/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40241749 |archive-date=12 February 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Webcam]]s are a low-cost extension of this phenomenon. While some webcams can give full-frame-rate video, the picture either is usually small or updates slowly. Internet users can watch animals around an African waterhole, ships in the [[Panama Canal]], traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises, live and in real time. Video [[chat rooms]] and [[video conferencing]] are also popular with many uses being found for personal webcams, with and without two-way sound. YouTube was founded on 15 February 2005 and is now the leading website for free streaming video with a vast number of users. It uses an HTML5 based web player by default to stream and show video files.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://youtube-eng.googleblog.com/2015/01/youtube-now-defaults-to-html5_27.html|title=YouTube now defaults to HTML5 <video>|work=YouTube Engineering and Developers Blog|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910204225/https://youtube-eng.googleblog.com/2015/01/youtube-now-defaults-to-html5_27.html|archive-date=10 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video and build their own personal profile.

The Internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through [[mobile Internet device]]s. Mobile phones, [[datacard]]s, [[handheld game console]]s and [[cellular router]]s allow users to connect to the Internet [[wireless]]ly. Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, the services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available. Service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.\n\nEducational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from websites. Examples range from [[CBeebies]], through school and high-school revision guides and [[Virtual university|virtual universities]], to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of [[Google Scholar]]. For [[distance education]], help with [[homework]] and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time, or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, it has never been easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere. The Internet in general and the [[World Wide Web]] in particular are important enablers of both [[Education|formal]] and [[informal education]]. Further, the Internet allows universities, in particular, researchers from the social and behavioral sciences, to conduct research remotely via virtual laboratories, with profound changes in reach and generalizability of findings as well as in communication between scientists and in the publication of results.<ref>Reips, U.-D.

Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups more easily to form. An example of this is the [[free software movement]], which has produced, among other things, [[Linux]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], and [[OpenOffice.org]] (later forked into [[LibreOffice]]). Internet chat, whether using an [[IRC]] chat room, an [[instant messaging]] system, or a [[social networking]] website, allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day.  Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via email. These systems may allow files to be exchanged, drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team members.\n\n[[Content management]] systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents simultaneously without accidentally destroying each other's work. Business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other information. Such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including scientific research, software development, conference planning, political activism and creative writing. Social and political collaboration is also becoming more widespread as both Internet access and [[computer literacy]] spread.\n\nThe Internet allows computer users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with [[computer security]], i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, depending on the requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can [[audit]] the books of a company based in another country, on a [[server (computing)|server]] situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before the widespread use of the Internet, but the cost of private [[leased line]]s would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps on the other side of the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using [[cloud computing]], or open a [[Remote Desktop Protocol|remote desktop]] session into their office PC using a secure [[virtual private network]] (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among [[system administrator]]s as the Virtual Private Nightmare,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Virtual Private Nightmare: VPN |url=http://librenix.com/?inode=5013 |publisher=Librenix |accessdate=21 July 2010 |date=4 August 2004 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515152637/http://librenix.com/?inode=5013 |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df= }}</ref> because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.\n\n=== Social networking and entertainment ===\n{{See also|Social networking service#Social impact}}\nMany people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book vacations and to pursue their personal interests. People use [[online chat|chat]], messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had [[pen pal]]s. [[Social network service|Social networking]] websites such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Myspace]] have created new ways to socialize and interact. Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, to pursue common interests, and to connect with others. It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people. Sites like [[LinkedIn]] foster commercial and business connections. YouTube and [[Flickr]] specialize in users' videos and photographs. While social networking sites were initially for individuals only, today they are widely used by businesses and other organizations to promote their brands, to market to their customers and to encourage posts to \"[[Viral marketing|go viral]]\". \"Black hat\" social media techniques are also employed by some organizations, such as [[Spamming|spam]] accounts and [[astroturfing]].\n\nA risk for both individuals and organizations writing posts (especially public posts) on social networking websites, is that especially foolish or controversial posts occasionally lead to an unexpected and possibly large-scale backlash on social media from other Internet users. This is also a risk in relation to controversial ''offline'' behavior, if it is widely made known. The nature of this backlash can range widely from counter-arguments and public mockery, through insults and [[hate speech]], to, in extreme cases, rape and death [[Computer crime#Threats|threats]]. The [[online disinhibition effect]] describes the tendency of many individuals to behave more stridently or offensively online than they would in person. A significant number of [[feminist]] women have been the target of various forms of [[harassment]] in response to posts they have made on social media, and Twitter in particular has been criticised in the past for not doing enough to aid victims of online abuse.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23477130 |title=Twitter 'report abuse' button calls after rape threats |last=Moore |first=Keith |date=27 July 2013 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=7 December 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904014545/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23477130 |archivedate=4 September 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nFor organizations, such a backlash can cause overall [[public relations|brand damage]], especially if reported by the media. However, this is not always the case, as any brand damage in the eyes of people with an opposing opinion to that presented by the organization could sometimes be outweighed by strengthening the brand in the eyes of others. Furthermore, if an organization or individual gives in to demands that others perceive as wrong-headed, that can then provoke a counter-backlash.\n\nSome websites, such as [[Reddit]], have rules forbidding the posting of [[personal information]] of individuals (also known as [[doxxing]]), due to concerns about such postings leading to mobs of large numbers of Internet users directing harassment at the specific individuals thereby identified. In particular, the Reddit rule forbidding the posting of personal information is widely understood to imply that all identifying photos and names must be [[censored]] in Facebook [[screenshots]] posted to Reddit. However, the interpretation of this rule in relation to public Twitter posts is less clear, and in any case, like-minded people online have many other ways they can use to direct each other's attention to public social media posts they disagree with.\n\nChildren also face dangers online such as [[cyberbullying]] and [[Child grooming|approaches by sexual predators]], who sometimes pose as children themselves. Children may also encounter material which they may find upsetting, or material which their parents consider to be not age-appropriate. Due to naivety, they may also post personal information about themselves online, which could put them or their families at risk unless warned not to do so. Many parents choose to enable [[Content-control software|Internet filtering]], and/or supervise their children's online activities, in an attempt to protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet. The most popular social networking websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, commonly forbid users under the age of 13. However, these policies are typically trivial to circumvent by registering an account with a false birth date, and a significant number of children aged under 13 join such sites anyway. Social networking sites for younger children, which claim to provide better levels of protection for children, also exist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2010/10/11/social-networks-children/ |title=5 Fun and Safe Social Networks for Children |date=11 October 2010 |accessdate=7 December 2014 |website=[[Mashable]] |last=Kessler |first=Sarah |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220082237/http://mashable.com/2010/10/11/social-networks-children/ |archivedate=20 December 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe Internet has been a major outlet for leisure activity since its inception, with entertaining [[social experiment]]s such as [[MUD]]s and [[MOO]]s being conducted on university servers, and humor-related [[Usenet]] groups receiving much traffic.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Many [[Internet forums]] have sections devoted to games and funny videos.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The [[Internet pornography]] and [[online gambling]] industries have taken advantage of the World Wide Web.

Websites, such as [[DonorsChoose]] and [[GlobalGiving]], allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice. A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy is the use of [[peer-to-peer lending]] for charitable purposes.

Kiva raises funds for local intermediary [[microfinance]] organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves.<ref>[http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php ''Kiva Is Not Quite What It Seems''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210045011/http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php |date=10 February 2010 }}, by David Roodman, Center for Global Development, 2 October 2009, as accessed  2 & 16 January 2010</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Strom |first=Stephanie |title=Confusion on Where Money Lent via Kiva Goes |work=The New York Times |page=6 |date=9 November 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129225155/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html |archivedate=29 January 2017 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Security ==\n{{Main|Internet security}}\nInternet resources, hardware, and software components are the target of criminal or malicious attempts to gain unauthorized control to cause interruptions, commit fraud, engage in blackmail or access private information.\n\n===Malware===\n[[Malware]] is malicious software used and distributed via the Internet.

Computers communicate over the Internet by breaking up messages (emails, images, videos, web pages, files, etc.) into small chunks called \"packets\", which are routed through a network of computers, until they reach their destination, where they are assembled back into a complete \"message\" again. [[Packet Capture Appliance]] intercepts these packets as they are traveling through the network, in order to examine their contents using other programs. A packet capture is an information ''gathering'' tool, but not an ''analysis'' tool. That is it gathers \"messages\" but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean. Other programs are needed to perform [[traffic analysis]] and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information.

The album was released on May 12, 2009, by [[Diplomat Records]], [[Asylum Records]], and [[Warner Bros. Records]].\n\n==Background==\n''My Job'', the rapper's first video in two years released to the internet in January 2009, shows a more mature approach to life in an economically struggling America. Though ''My Job'' was not intended to be a single, the response to the song was so positive that it was released as a single on March 10, 2009. \n\n[[XXL Magazine]] shortly after announced cover of their April issue, due out February 24, which will go more into detail about his status, the 2007 feud with [[50 Cent]] and the status of the once dominating crew [[The Diplomats]]. In this interview, Cam'ron stated that the original Diplomats [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jim Jones]], [[Juelz Santana]], and [[Freeky Zeeky]] were no longer together.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\n[[Miss Info]] also released an exclusive \"Where's Cam'ron?\" segment on her website, where the rapper continues to explain many unanswered questions and the future of the MC. Despite the fact that none of the singles charted, the album proved to be successful, charting at #3 on the Billboard 200 selling an estimated 45,000 copies its first week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missinfo.tv |title=MissInfo.tv |publisher=MissInfo.tv |date= |accessdate=2014-05-25}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 68/100<ref name=\"Metacritic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/crime-pays/camron |title=Reviews for Crime Pays by Cam'ron |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref>\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web|last=Jeffries |first=David |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/crime-pays-mw0000816238 |title=Crime Pays - Cam'ron |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}</ref>\n|rev2 = DJBooth\n|rev2Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"DJB\">{{cite web |url=http://www.djbooth.net/index/albums/review/camron-crime-pays-05120901/ |title=Cam\u2019ron - Crime Pays |last=Slavik |first=Nathan |website=DJBooth |publisher=The DJBooth, LLC. |date=May 12, 2009 |accessdate=May 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525233215/http://www.djbooth.net/index/albums/review/camron-crime-pays-05120901/ |archive-date=May 25, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n|rev3Score = B<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite magazine|last=Vozick-Levinson |first=Simon |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20276736,00.html |title=Crime Pays Review |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |date=May 6, 2009 |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]]''\n|rev4Score = {{Rating|4|5|full=Red N.png|empty=Blank N.PNG|rating=N}}<ref name=\"Now\">{{cite news|url=https://nowtoronto.com/music/album-reviews/camron-2009-05-20/ |title=Cam'ron - Crime Pays (Asylum/Diplomatic Man) |last=Rennie |first=Andrew |newspaper=[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]] |publisher=[[Now Communications|NOW Communications]] |date=May 20, 2009 |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref>\n|rev5 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n|rev5Score = 5.7/10<ref name=\"Pitchfork\">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13029-crime-pays/ |title=Cam'ron: Crime Pays |last=Cohen |first=Ian |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=May 15, 2009 |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}</ref>\n|rev6 = ''[[PopMatters]]''\n|rev6Score = {{Rating|4|10}}<ref name=\"PM\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/94364-camron-crime-pays/ |title=Cam'ron: Crime Pays |last=Sargent |first=Jordan |magazine=[[PopMatters]] |date=June 11, 2009 |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref>\n|rev7 = ''RapReviews''\n|rev7Score = 6.5/10<ref name=\"RR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2009_05_crimepays.html |title=Cam'Ron :: Crime Pays :: Asylum Records |last=Hernandez |first=Pedro |website=RapReviews |date=May 19, 2009 |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref>\n|rev8 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n|rev8Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"RS\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/28001581/review/28123956/crime_pays |title=Crime Pays : Cam'ron : Review |last=Rosen |first=Jody |authorlink=Jody Rosen |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]] |date=May 12, 2009 |accessdate=November 28, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517202631/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/28001581/review/28123956/crime_pays |archivedate=May 17, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|rev9 = [[Slant Magazine]]\n|rev9Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Slant\">{{cite magazine|last=Cataldo |first=Jesse |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/camron-crime-pays |title=Cam'ron Crime Pays |magazine=[[Slant Magazine]] |date=May 12, 2009 |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref>\n|rev10 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n|rev10Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Spin\">{{cite magazine|last=Ryan |first=Chris |url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/camron-crime-pays-asylum |title=Cam'ron 'Crime Pays' (Asylum) |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |publisher=[[Spin Media]] |date=April 16, 2009 |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}</ref>\n}}\n''Crime Pays'' received positive reviews but [[Music journalism|music critic]]s found criticism in its length, production and lyrical content.

They concluded by praising the track \"My Job\" for bringing Cam out of his comfort zone to deliver a serious subject matter.<ref name=\"EW\"/><ref name=\"RS\"/> Nathan Slavik of DJBooth found the album a bit lengthy with unnecessary skits and dull tracks but found Cam's lyrical content and choice in party tracks still on-point, saying that \"while ''Crime Pays'' is far from a perfect album, it is more than enough to serve as a notice to hip-hop: Cam\u2019ron\u2019s back, and he is not to be slept on.\"<ref name=\"DJB\"/>\n\nJesse Cataldo of [[Slant Magazine]] was also critical of the needless skits and anonymous brag tracks that border on misogyny but found the production on the same footing with Cam's idiosyncratic wordplay, saying that \"forgetting the excess filler, he\u2019s [also] put out a pretty solid album.\"<ref name=\"Slant\"/> Ian Cohen from ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' was mixed about the album, finding Cam's usually humorous lyrics and confident flow wasted with production that's more appropriate for a mixtape. He also pointed out that Cam's material was similar to [[Kool Keith]] based on the skits, concluding that \"In their minds, Cam's done nothing worth really mentioning since 2005, and ''Crime Pays'' often makes you wonder if they've got a point.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/> Jordan Sargent of ''[[PopMatters]]'' criticized the album for lacking the retro-soul beats of ''[[Purple Haze (album)|Purple Haze]]'' that had energy and instead contains lackluster synth production with lyrics that border on self-parody, saying that, \"On ''Crime Pays'' he swings too far in the opposite direction, coming back with an album that is unadventurous and uninteresting.\"<ref name=\"PM\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| extra_column    = Producer(s)\n| title1          = Crime Pays\n| note1           = Intro\n| extra1          = [[Skitzo]]\n| length1         = 2:32\n| title2          = Cook'n up\n| extra2          = [[I.N.F.O.

The album was released on May 12, 2009, by [[Diplomat Records]], [[Asylum Records]], and [[Warner Bros. Records]].\n\n==Background==\n''My Job'', the rapper's first video in two years released to the internet in January 2009, shows a more mature approach to life in an economically struggling America. Though ''My Job'' was not intended to be a single, the response to the song was so positive that it was released as a single on March 10, 2009. \n\n[[XXL Magazine]] shortly after announced cover of their April issue, due out February 24, which will go more into detail about his status, the 2007 feud with [[50 Cent]] and the status of the once dominating crew [[The Diplomats]]. In this interview, Cam'ron stated that the original Diplomats [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jim Jones]], [[Juelz Santana]], and [[Freeky Zeeky]] were no longer together.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\n[[Miss Info]] also released an exclusive \"Where's Cam'ron?\" segment on her website, where the rapper continues to explain many unanswered questions and the future of the MC. Despite the fact that none of the singles charted, the album proved to be successful, charting at #3 on the Billboard 200 selling an estimated 45,000 copies its first week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missinfo.tv |title=MissInfo.tv |publisher=MissInfo.tv |date= |accessdate=2014-05-25}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 68/100<ref name=\"Metacritic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/crime-pays/camron |title=Reviews for Crime Pays by Cam'ron |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref>\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web|last=Jeffries |first=David |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/crime-pays-mw0000816238 |title=Crime Pays - Cam'ron |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}</ref>\n|rev2 = DJBooth\n|rev2Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"DJB\">{{cite web |url=http://www.djbooth.net/index/albums/review/camron-crime-pays-05120901/ |title=Cam\u2019ron - Crime Pays |last=Slavik |first=Nathan |website=DJBooth |publisher=The DJBooth, LLC. |date=May 12, 2009 |accessdate=May 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525233215/http://www.djbooth.net/index/albums/review/camron-crime-pays-05120901/ |archive-date=May 25, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n|rev3Score = B<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite magazine|last=Vozick-Levinson |first=Simon |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20276736,00.html |title=Crime Pays Review |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |date=May 6, 2009 |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]]''\n|rev4Score = {{Rating|4|5|full=Red N.png|empty=Blank N.PNG|rating=N}}<ref name=\"Now\">{{cite news|url=https://nowtoronto.com/music/album-reviews/camron-2009-05-20/ |title=Cam'ron - Crime Pays (Asylum/Diplomatic Man) |last=Rennie |first=Andrew |newspaper=[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]] |publisher=[[Now Communications|NOW Communications]] |date=May 20, 2009 |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref>\n|rev5 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n|rev5Score = 5.7/10<ref name=\"Pitchfork\">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13029-crime-pays/ |title=Cam'ron: Crime Pays |last=Cohen |first=Ian |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=May 15, 2009 |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}</ref>\n|rev6 = ''[[PopMatters]]''\n|rev6Score = {{Rating|4|10}}<ref name=\"PM\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/94364-camron-crime-pays/ |title=Cam'ron: Crime Pays |last=Sargent |first=Jordan |magazine=[[PopMatters]] |date=June 11, 2009 |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref>\n|rev7 = ''RapReviews''\n|rev7Score = 6.5/10<ref name=\"RR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2009_05_crimepays.html |title=Cam'Ron :: Crime Pays :: Asylum Records |last=Hernandez |first=Pedro |website=RapReviews |date=May 19, 2009 |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref>\n|rev8 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n|rev8Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"RS\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/28001581/review/28123956/crime_pays |title=Crime Pays : Cam'ron : Review |last=Rosen |first=Jody |authorlink=Jody Rosen |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]] |date=May 12, 2009 |accessdate=November 28, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517202631/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/28001581/review/28123956/crime_pays |archivedate=May 17, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|rev9 = [[Slant Magazine]]\n|rev9Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Slant\">{{cite magazine|last=Cataldo |first=Jesse |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/camron-crime-pays |title=Cam'ron Crime Pays |magazine=[[Slant Magazine]] |date=May 12, 2009 |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref>\n|rev10 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n|rev10Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Spin\">{{cite magazine|last=Ryan |first=Chris |url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/camron-crime-pays-asylum |title=Cam'ron 'Crime Pays' (Asylum) |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |publisher=[[Spin Media]] |date=April 16, 2009 |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}</ref>\n}}\n''Crime Pays'' received positive reviews but [[Music journalism|music critic]]s found criticism in its length, production and lyrical content.

They concluded by praising the track \"My Job\" for bringing Cam out of his comfort zone to deliver a serious subject matter.<ref name=\"EW\"/><ref name=\"RS\"/> Nathan Slavik of DJBooth found the album a bit lengthy with unnecessary skits and dull tracks but found Cam's lyrical content and choice in party tracks still on-point, saying that \"while ''Crime Pays'' is far from a perfect album, it is more than enough to serve as a notice to hip-hop: Cam\u2019ron\u2019s back, and he is not to be slept on.\"<ref name=\"DJB\"/>\n\nJesse Cataldo of [[Slant Magazine]] was also critical of the needless skits and anonymous brag tracks that border on misogyny but found the production on the same footing with Cam's idiosyncratic wordplay, saying that \"forgetting the excess filler, he\u2019s [also] put out a pretty solid album.\"<ref name=\"Slant\"/> Ian Cohen from ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' was mixed about the album, finding Cam's usually humorous lyrics and confident flow wasted with production that's more appropriate for a mixtape.

The inner-city cemeteries, mostly the graveyards attached to individual churches, had long been unable to cope with the number of burials and were seen as a hazard to health and an undignified way to treat the dead. The initial design was by architect and entrepreneur [[Stephen Geary]].\n\nOn Monday 20 May 1839, Highgate (West) Cemetery was dedicated to [[James, son of Alphaeus|St. James]]<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://highgatecemetery.org/about/history|website=Highgate Cemetery|publisher=Highgate Cemetery|accessdate=21 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124082617/http://highgatecemetery.org/about/history|archive-date=24 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> by the Right Reverend [[Charles James Blomfield]], Lord [[Bishop of London]]. Fifteen acres were consecrated for the use of the [[Church of England]], and two acres set aside for [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]]. Rights of burial were sold for either limited period or in perpetuity. The first burial was Elizabeth Jackson of Little Windmill Street, [[Soho]], on 26 May.\n\nHighgate, like the others of the Magnificent Seven, soon became a fashionable place for burials and was much admired and visited. The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] attitude to death and its presentation led to the creation of a wealth of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] tombs and buildings. It occupies a spectacular south-facing hillside site slightly downhill from the top of the hill of Highgate itself, next to Waterlow Park. In 1854 the area to the east of the original area across Swains Lane was bought to form the eastern part of the cemetery. Both the cemeteries are still used today for burials, but these areas are closed to the public. Most of the open unforested area in the East Cemetery still has fairly few graves on it.\n\nThe cemetery's grounds are full of trees, shrubbery and wildflowers, most of which have been planted and grown without human influence. The grounds are a haven for birds and small animals such as foxes.\n\nBecause of the Karl Marx association a variety of [[Socialism|socialist]] leaders and thinkers are buried within the cemetery grounds.\n\nHighgate Cemetery was featured in the popular media from the 1960s to the late 1980s for its so-called [[occult]] past, particularly as being the alleged site of the \"[[Highgate Vampire]]\".\n\n==Friends of Highgate Cemetery==\nThe Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust was set up in 1975 and acquired the freehold of both East and West Cemeteries by 1981, since when they have had responsibility for the maintenance of the location. In 1984 they published ''Highgate Cemetery: Victorian Valhalla'' by [[John Gay (photographer)|John Gay]].<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.highgate-cemetery.org/ | title = A Brief History of Highgate Cemetery}}</ref>\n\n==East Cemetery==\n[[File:Grave of Karl Marx Highgate Cemetery in London 2016 (10).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Tomb of Karl Marx]],  East Cemetery]]\nMany famous or prominent people are buried in Highgate cemetery; the most famous burial is arguably that of [[Karl Marx]], whose tomb was the site of attempted bombings on 2 September 1965<ref>{{citation | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XnIsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2MsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6238%2C1047342 | publisher = Google | title = News}}</ref> and in 1970.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.camdennewjournal.co.uk/111705/cn111705_11.htm | title = Camden New Journal | place = UK | contribution = Tomb raiders\u2019 failed attack on Marx grave}}</ref> The tomb of [[Karl Marx]] is a Grade I [[listed building]] for reasons of historical importance.\n\n===East Cemetery interments===\n\n[[File:WFGgrave.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Grave of [[William Friese-Greene]] by [[Edwin Lutyens|Lutyens]], East Cemetery]]\n* [[Douglas Adams]], (ashes) author of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' and other novels\n* [[Farzad Bazoft]], journalist, executed by [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime\n* [[Jeremy Beadle]], television presenter \n* Adolf Beck, the [[Adolph Beck case]] was a celebrated case of mistaken identity \n* [[Hercules Bellville]], American film producer\n* [[Kate Booth]], English Salvationist and evangelist.

The initial design was by architect and entrepreneur [[Stephen Geary]].\n\nOn Monday 20 May 1839, Highgate (West) Cemetery was dedicated to [[James, son of Alphaeus|St. James]]<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://highgatecemetery.org/about/history|website=Highgate Cemetery|publisher=Highgate Cemetery|accessdate=21 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124082617/http://highgatecemetery.org/about/history|archive-date=24 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> by the Right Reverend [[Charles James Blomfield]], Lord [[Bishop of London]]. Fifteen acres were consecrated for the use of the [[Church of England]], and two acres set aside for [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]]. Rights of burial were sold for either limited period or in perpetuity. The first burial was Elizabeth Jackson of Little Windmill Street, [[Soho]], on 26 May.\n\nHighgate, like the others of the Magnificent Seven, soon became a fashionable place for burials and was much admired and visited. The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] attitude to death and its presentation led to the creation of a wealth of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] tombs and buildings. It occupies a spectacular south-facing hillside site slightly downhill from the top of the hill of Highgate itself, next to Waterlow Park. In 1854 the area to the east of the original area across Swains Lane was bought to form the eastern part of the cemetery. Both the cemeteries are still used today for burials, but these areas are closed to the public. Most of the open unforested area in the East Cemetery still has fairly few graves on it.\n\nThe cemetery's grounds are full of trees, shrubbery and wildflowers, most of which have been planted and grown without human influence. The grounds are a haven for birds and small animals such as foxes.\n\nBecause of the Karl Marx association a variety of [[Socialism|socialist]] leaders and thinkers are buried within the cemetery grounds.\n\nHighgate Cemetery was featured in the popular media from the 1960s to the late 1980s for its so-called [[occult]] past, particularly as being the alleged site of the \"[[Highgate Vampire]]\".\n\n==Friends of Highgate Cemetery==\nThe Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust was set up in 1975 and acquired the freehold of both East and West Cemeteries by 1981, since when they have had responsibility for the maintenance of the location. In 1984 they published ''Highgate Cemetery: Victorian Valhalla'' by [[John Gay (photographer)|John Gay]].<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.highgate-cemetery.org/ | title = A Brief History of Highgate Cemetery}}</ref>\n\n==East Cemetery==\n[[File:Grave of Karl Marx Highgate Cemetery in London 2016 (10).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Tomb of Karl Marx]],  East Cemetery]]\nMany famous or prominent people are buried in Highgate cemetery; the most famous burial is arguably that of [[Karl Marx]], whose tomb was the site of attempted bombings on 2 September 1965<ref>{{citation | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XnIsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2MsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6238%2C1047342 | publisher = Google | title = News}}</ref> and in 1970.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.camdennewjournal.co.uk/111705/cn111705_11.htm | title = Camden New Journal | place = UK | contribution = Tomb raiders\u2019 failed attack on Marx grave}}</ref> The tomb of [[Karl Marx]] is a Grade I [[listed building]] for reasons of historical importance.\n\n===East Cemetery interments===\n\n[[File:WFGgrave.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Grave of [[William Friese-Greene]] by [[Edwin Lutyens|Lutyens]], East Cemetery]]\n* [[Douglas Adams]], (ashes) author of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' and other novels\n* [[Farzad Bazoft]], journalist, executed by [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime\n* [[Jeremy Beadle]], television presenter \n* Adolf Beck, the [[Adolph Beck case]] was a celebrated case of mistaken identity \n* [[Hercules Bellville]], American film producer\n* [[Kate Booth]], English Salvationist and evangelist.

In the 2001 film ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]],'' a mother is convinced that her house is being haunted; at the end of the film, she learns that she and her children are really the ghosts. In the 1957 movie ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)]]'', the plot follows a murder lawsuit in which an experienced star lawyer successfully contends an acquittal by exposing the incriminating statements made by the accused's wife as false. In the twist it is revealed that the wife deceived the jury and the main character actually committed the murder.

This type of ending was a common twist ending utilised by ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', most effectively in the episode \"[[Time Enough at Last]]\" where [[Burgess Meredith]]'s character is robbed of all his hope by a simple but devastating accident with his glasses. A positive reversal of fortune would be Nicholas Van Orton's suicide attempt after mistakenly believing himself to have accidentally killed his brother, only to land safely in the midst of his own birthday party, in the film ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]''.\n\n===''Deus ex machina''===\n''[[Deus ex machina]]'' is a Latin term meaning \"god from the machine.\" It refers to an unexpected, artificial or improbable character, device or event introduced suddenly in a work of fiction to resolve a situation or untangle a plot.<ref name=\"Shipley1964\">{{cite book|author=Joseph Twadell Shipley|title=Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA156|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=1964|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=156|id=GGKEY:GL0NUL09LL7}}</ref> In [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek theater]], the \"deus ex machina\" ('\u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2') was the character of a Greek god literally brought onto the stage via a crane (\u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u1fc6\u03c2\u2014''mechanes''), after which a seemingly insoluble problem is brought to a satisfactory resolution by the god's will.

The red herring is a type of [[wikt:misdirection|misdirection]], a device intended to distract the [[protagonist]], and by extension the reader, away from the correct answer or from the site of pertinent clues or action. The Indian murder mystery film ''[[Gupt: The Hidden Truth]]'' cast many veteran actors who had usually played villainous roles in previous Indian films as red herrings in this film to deceive the audience into suspecting them. In the bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', the misdeeds of a key character named \"Bishop Aringarosa\" draw attention away from the true master villain (\"Aringarosa\" literally translates as \"pink herring\"). In the [[William Diehl]] novel ''[[Primal Fear (novel)|Primal Fear]]'' (also adapted into a [[Primal Fear (film)|film]]), a defendant named [[Aaron Stampler]] is accused of brutally murdering the Archbishop of Chicago. He is revealed to have a [[dissociative identity disorder]], and is not executed on plea of insanity. Near the end, Aaron's lawyer discovers that he feigned his insanity to avoid the death penalty. Agatha Christie's classic ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is another famous example and includes the term as well in a murder ploy where the intended victims are made to guess that one of them will be killed through an act of treachery. A red herring can also be used as a form of false [[foreshadowing]].\n\n=== False protagonist ===\nA [[false protagonist]] is a character presented at the start of the story as the main character, but then disposed of, usually killing them. An example is the film ''[[Executive Decision]]'', in which the [[Special forces|special-forces]] team leader, played by highly-billed action star [[Steven Seagal]], is killed shortly after their mission begins. Another instance is ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'''s Marion Crane (portrayed by [[Janet Leigh]]), who is brutally murdered early in the film. A contemporary example is the character of Charlie in ''[[Hereditary (film)|Hereditary]]'', who is killed before the end of the first hour.\n\n===Non-linear narrative===\nA [[non-linear narrative]] works by revealing plot and character in non-chronological order.<ref name=\"Steiff2011\">{{cite book|author=Josef Steiff|title=Sherlock Holmes and Philosophy: The Footprints of a Gigantic Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vq24xAyfoq0C&pg=PA96|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2011|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9731-5|page=96}}</ref> This technique requires the reader to attempt to piece together the timeline in order to fully understand the story. A twist ending can occur as the result of information that is held until the climax and which places characters or events in a different perspective. Some of the earliest known uses of non-linear story telling occur in ''[[The Odyssey]]'', a work that is largely told in flashback via the narrator [[Odysseus]]. ''[[The Aeneid]]'', another [[epic poem]], uses a similar approach; it begins with the main protagonist, [[Aeneas]], telling stories about the end of the [[Trojan War]] and the first half of his journey to [[Dido]], queen of [[Carthage]]. The nonlinear approach has been used in works such as the films ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'', ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'', the television shows [[Lost (TV series)|''Lost'']], ''[[How I Met Your Mother (TV series)|How I Met Your Mother]]'' (especially in many episodes in the later seasons), ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', ''[[Westworld (TV series)|Westworld]]'' and the book ''[[Catch-22]]''.<ref>Adrienne Redd, [http://prosetoad.blogspot.com/2006/01/nonlinear-films-and-anticausality-of.html Nonlinear films and the anticausality of Mulholland Dr.], '' Prose Toad Literary Blog''</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plotsinc.com/sitenew/column_art_02.html |title=Plots Inc.

In the bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', the misdeeds of a key character named \"Bishop Aringarosa\" draw attention away from the true master villain (\"Aringarosa\" literally translates as \"pink herring\"). In the [[William Diehl]] novel ''[[Primal Fear (novel)|Primal Fear]]'' (also adapted into a [[Primal Fear (film)|film]]), a defendant named [[Aaron Stampler]] is accused of brutally murdering the Archbishop of Chicago. He is revealed to have a [[dissociative identity disorder]], and is not executed on plea of insanity. Near the end, Aaron's lawyer discovers that he feigned his insanity to avoid the death penalty. Agatha Christie's classic ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is another famous example and includes the term as well in a murder ploy where the intended victims are made to guess that one of them will be killed through an act of treachery. A red herring can also be used as a form of false [[foreshadowing]].\n\n=== False protagonist ===\nA [[false protagonist]] is a character presented at the start of the story as the main character, but then disposed of, usually killing them. An example is the film ''[[Executive Decision]]'', in which the [[Special forces|special-forces]] team leader, played by highly-billed action star [[Steven Seagal]], is killed shortly after their mission begins. Another instance is ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'''s Marion Crane (portrayed by [[Janet Leigh]]), who is brutally murdered early in the film. A contemporary example is the character of Charlie in ''[[Hereditary (film)|Hereditary]]'', who is killed before the end of the first hour.\n\n===Non-linear narrative===\nA [[non-linear narrative]] works by revealing plot and character in non-chronological order.<ref name=\"Steiff2011\">{{cite book|author=Josef Steiff|title=Sherlock Holmes and Philosophy: The Footprints of a Gigantic Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vq24xAyfoq0C&pg=PA96|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2011|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9731-5|page=96}}</ref> This technique requires the reader to attempt to piece together the timeline in order to fully understand the story. A twist ending can occur as the result of information that is held until the climax and which places characters or events in a different perspective. Some of the earliest known uses of non-linear story telling occur in ''[[The Odyssey]]'', a work that is largely told in flashback via the narrator [[Odysseus]]. ''[[The Aeneid]]'', another [[epic poem]], uses a similar approach; it begins with the main protagonist, [[Aeneas]], telling stories about the end of the [[Trojan War]] and the first half of his journey to [[Dido]], queen of [[Carthage]]. The nonlinear approach has been used in works such as the films ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'', ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'', the television shows [[Lost (TV series)|''Lost'']], ''[[How I Met Your Mother (TV series)|How I Met Your Mother]]'' (especially in many episodes in the later seasons), ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', ''[[Westworld (TV series)|Westworld]]'' and the book ''[[Catch-22]]''.<ref>Adrienne Redd, [http://prosetoad.blogspot.com/2006/01/nonlinear-films-and-anticausality-of.html Nonlinear films and the anticausality of Mulholland Dr.], '' Prose Toad Literary Blog''</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plotsinc.com/sitenew/column_art_02.html |title=Plots Inc.

Peter Relic of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' found criticism in the album's production and soul samples and Cam's insults towards [[Jay-Z]] but still found it entertaining with its wordplay, saying that \"''Killa Season'' proves Cam'ron can still bring heady verbiage and heat, but it's doubtful Jay-Z is losing much sleep.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/> While also finding the production decent, Brian Sims of ''[[HipHopDX]]'' praised the album's skits and hooks and Cam's delivery for bringing light to creative imagery, saying that \"As an industry veteran, Cam deserves a lot of credit for not using his album to address petty squabbles or provide some pseudo-intellectual autobiography.\"<ref name=\"HHDX\"/> [[AllMusic]] editor David Jeffries said that the album was in need of a rewrite on some tracks but still found it enjoyable with memorable hooks and for showing a vulnerable side in Cam, concluding that \"''Killa Season'' would have benefited from trimming and better planning, but those things are extremely rare in the world of Dipset. Taking that into account, the album is exceptional and a good enough excuse for two more years of mouthing off and starting trouble.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/>\n\nSteve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews praised the album for continuing ''Purple Haze''{{'}}s formula with tight wordplay and loose soul sample production, despite containing tracks that were Dipset holdovers, concluding that, \"Nonetheless Cam fans should be happy with ''Killa Season'', an album which continues his recent trend of solid (if somewhat unspectacular) solo CD's.\"<ref name=\"RR\"/> Jayson Greene of ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' found some of Cam's lyrics humorous at times, but found the production and guest artists lacking in variety in terms of go-to names, concluding with \"Instead, ''Killa Season'' is a retreat, an album to satisfy the converted but one that will keep his mythical status confined to the 12-mile radius of his Manhattan home.\"<ref name=\"Stylus\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' writer Ryan Dombal felt the album was a disappointment compared to ''Purple Haze'', finding the production lacking in energy and in need of more humorous songs (\"I.B.S.\") then aggressive diss tracks (\"You Gotta Love It\"). Dombal also pointed out that the limited edition of the album contained a DVD that reveals Cam'ron's battle with Jay-Z was all for publicity, concluding that, \"If this underwhelming offering is any indication, such blind self-reference has considerably slowed down Cam'ron's once-unstoppable Dipset Movement.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n\n| title1 = Killa Cam (Intro)\n| note1 = featuring [[40 Cal.]]\n| extra1 = Pro-V \n| length1 = 5:01\n\n| title2 = He Tried to Play Me\n| note2 = featuring [[Hell Rell]]\n| extra2 = Charlmagne\n| length2 = 3:43\n\n| title3 = Leave You Alone\n| note3 =\n| extra3 = Blackout Movement\n| length3 = 3:24\n\n| title4 = Living a Lie\n| note4 = featuring Mo Money\n| extra4 = [[Ty Fyffe]]\n| length4 = 4:32\n\n| title5 = We Make Change\n| note5 = featuring [[Juelz Santana]]\n| extra5 = Jonathan Dugger a.k.a. \"Peersonile\" for Versatile Music Productions, LLC\n| length5 = 3:10\n\n| title6 = Voicemail (Interlude)\n| note6  = \n| extra6 =\n| length6 = 2:04\n\n| title7 = Wet Wipes\n| note7 = \n| extra7 = [[The Alchemist (producer)|The Alchemist]]\n| length7 = 3:35\n\n| title8 = Touch It or Not\n| note8 = featuring [[Lil Wayne]]\n| extra8 = BBanga\n| length8 = 3:41\n\n| title9 = War\n| note9 = featuring [[Hell Rell]]\n| extra9 = NOVA\t\n| length9 = 3:51\n\n| title10 = Triple Up\n| note10 = featuring 40 Cal.\n| extra10 = BBanga \n| length10 = 4:09\n\n| title11 = I.B.S\n| note11 = \n| extra11 = [[The Heatmakerz]]\n| length11 = 3:32\n\n| title12 = Get Ya Gun\n| note12 = \n| extra12 = Big Tyme\n| length12 = 3:58\n\n| title13 = White Girls\n| note13 = \n| extra13 = The Beat Firm\n| length13 = 3:48\n\n| title14 = Girls, Cash, Cars\n| note14 = \n| extra14 = Stay Gettin' Productions\n| length14 = 3:06\n\n| title15 = Do Ya Thing (Remix)\n| note15 = \n| extra15 = Chad Hamilton\n| length15 = 2:54\n\n| title16 = [[Get'em Daddy]] (Remix)\n| note16 = featuring [[Hell Rell]], [[J.

Peter Relic of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' found criticism in the album's production and soul samples and Cam's insults towards [[Jay-Z]] but still found it entertaining with its wordplay, saying that \"''Killa Season'' proves Cam'ron can still bring heady verbiage and heat, but it's doubtful Jay-Z is losing much sleep.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/> While also finding the production decent, Brian Sims of ''[[HipHopDX]]'' praised the album's skits and hooks and Cam's delivery for bringing light to creative imagery, saying that \"As an industry veteran, Cam deserves a lot of credit for not using his album to address petty squabbles or provide some pseudo-intellectual autobiography.\"<ref name=\"HHDX\"/> [[AllMusic]] editor David Jeffries said that the album was in need of a rewrite on some tracks but still found it enjoyable with memorable hooks and for showing a vulnerable side in Cam, concluding that \"''Killa Season'' would have benefited from trimming and better planning, but those things are extremely rare in the world of Dipset. Taking that into account, the album is exceptional and a good enough excuse for two more years of mouthing off and starting trouble.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/>\n\nSteve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews praised the album for continuing ''Purple Haze''{{'}}s formula with tight wordplay and loose soul sample production, despite containing tracks that were Dipset holdovers, concluding that, \"Nonetheless Cam fans should be happy with ''Killa Season'', an album which continues his recent trend of solid (if somewhat unspectacular) solo CD's.\"<ref name=\"RR\"/> Jayson Greene of ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' found some of Cam's lyrics humorous at times, but found the production and guest artists lacking in variety in terms of go-to names, concluding with \"Instead, ''Killa Season'' is a retreat, an album to satisfy the converted but one that will keep his mythical status confined to the 12-mile radius of his Manhattan home.\"<ref name=\"Stylus\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' writer Ryan Dombal felt the album was a disappointment compared to ''Purple Haze'', finding the production lacking in energy and in need of more humorous songs (\"I.B.S.\") then aggressive diss tracks (\"You Gotta Love It\"). Dombal also pointed out that the limited edition of the album contained a DVD that reveals Cam'ron's battle with Jay-Z was all for publicity, concluding that, \"If this underwhelming offering is any indication, such blind self-reference has considerably slowed down Cam'ron's once-unstoppable Dipset Movement.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n\n| title1 = Killa Cam (Intro)\n| note1 = featuring [[40 Cal.]]\n| extra1 = Pro-V \n| length1 = 5:01\n\n| title2 = He Tried to Play Me\n| note2 = featuring [[Hell Rell]]\n| extra2 = Charlmagne\n| length2 = 3:43\n\n| title3 = Leave You Alone\n| note3 =\n| extra3 = Blackout Movement\n| length3 = 3:24\n\n| title4 = Living a Lie\n| note4 = featuring Mo Money\n| extra4 = [[Ty Fyffe]]\n| length4 = 4:32\n\n| title5 = We Make Change\n| note5 = featuring [[Juelz Santana]]\n| extra5 = Jonathan Dugger a.k.a. \"Peersonile\" for Versatile Music Productions, LLC\n| length5 = 3:10\n\n| title6 = Voicemail (Interlude)\n| note6  = \n| extra6 =\n| length6 = 2:04\n\n| title7 = Wet Wipes\n| note7 = \n| extra7 = [[The Alchemist (producer)|The Alchemist]]\n| length7 = 3:35\n\n| title8 = Touch It or Not\n| note8 = featuring [[Lil Wayne]]\n| extra8 = BBanga\n| length8 = 3:41\n\n| title9 = War\n| note9 = featuring [[Hell Rell]]\n| extra9 = NOVA\t\n| length9 = 3:51\n\n| title10 = Triple Up\n| note10 = featuring 40 Cal.\n| extra10 = BBanga \n| length10 = 4:09\n\n| title11 = I.B.S\n| note11 = \n| extra11 = [[The Heatmakerz]]\n| length11 = 3:32\n\n| title12 = Get Ya Gun\n| note12 = \n| extra12 = Big Tyme\n| length12 = 3:58\n\n| title13 = White Girls\n| note13 = \n| extra13 = The Beat Firm\n| length13 = 3:48\n\n| title14 = Girls, Cash, Cars\n| note14 = \n| extra14 = Stay Gettin' Productions\n| length14 = 3:06\n\n| title15 = Do Ya Thing (Remix)\n| note15 = \n| extra15 = Chad Hamilton\n| length15 = 2:54\n\n| title16 = [[Get'em Daddy]] (Remix)\n| note16 = featuring [[Hell Rell]], [[J.
