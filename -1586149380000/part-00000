They are created and maintained by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) [[Local area network|LAN]]/[[Metropolitan area network|MAN]] Standards Committee ([[IEEE 802]]). The base version of the standard was released in 1997, and has had subsequent amendments. The standard and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the [[Wi-Fi]] brand. While each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote capabilities of their products. As a result, in the marketplace, each revision tends to become its own standard.\n\nThe protocols are typically used in conjunction with [[IEEE 802.2]], and are designed to interwork seamlessly with [[Ethernet]], and are very often used to carry [[Internet Protocol]] traffic.\n\nAlthough IEEE 802.11 specifications list channels that might be used, the [[radio frequency]] spectrum availability allowed varies significantly by regulatory domain.\n\n==General description==\nOH, The 802.11 family consists of a series of [[half-duplex]] over-the-air [[modulation]] techniques that use the same basic protocol. The 802.11 protocol family employs [[carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] whereby equipment listens to a channel for other users (including non 802.11 users) before transmitting each packet.\n\n802.11-1997 was the first wireless networking standard in the family, but 802.11b was the first widely accepted one, followed by 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac. Other standards in the family (c\u2013f, h, j) are service amendments that are used to extend the current scope of the existing standard, which may also include corrections to a previous specification.<ref name=\"IEEE-SA Standards Board Operations Manual\">{{cite web |title=IEEE-SA Standards Board Operations Manual |publisher=IEEE-SA |url=https://standards.ieee.org/develop/policies/opman/sect8.html |access-date=2015-09-13 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906183258/http://standards.ieee.org/develop/policies/opman/sect8.html |archive-date=2015-09-06 |df= }}</ref>\n\n802.11b and 802.11g use the 2.4&nbsp;[[hertz|GHz]] [[ISM band]], operating in the United States under [[Part 15 (FCC rules)|Part 15]] of the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] Rules and Regulations; 802.11n can also use that band. Because of this choice of frequency band, 802.11b/g/n equipment may occasionally suffer [[Electromagnetic interference at 2.4 GHz|interference in the 2.4 GHz band]] from [[microwave oven]]s, [[cordless telephone]]s, and [[Bluetooth]] devices etc. 802.11b and 802.11g control their interference and susceptibility to interference by using [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]] (DSSS) and [[orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM) signaling methods, respectively.\n\n802.11a uses the [[U-NII|5&nbsp;GHz U-NII band]], which, for much of the world, offers at least 23 non-overlapping 20&nbsp;MHz-wide channels rather than the 2.4&nbsp;GHz ISM frequency band offering only three non-overlapping 20&nbsp;MHz-wide channels, where other adjacent channels overlap\u2014see [[list of WLAN channels]]. Better or worse performance with higher or lower frequencies (channels) may be realized, depending on the environment. 802.11n can use either the 2.4&nbsp;GHz or 5&nbsp;GHz band; 802.11ac uses only the 5&nbsp;GHz band.\n\nThe segment of the [[radio frequency]] spectrum used by 802.11 varies between countries. In the US, 802.11a and 802.11g devices may be operated without a license, as allowed in Part 15 of the FCC Rules and Regulations. Frequencies used by channels one through six of 802.11b and 802.11g fall within the 2.4&nbsp;GHz [[amateur radio]] band. Licensed amateur radio operators may operate 802.11b/g devices under [[Part 97 (FCC rules)|Part 97]] of the FCC Rules and Regulations, allowing increased power output but not commercial content or encryption.<ref name=\"part97\">{{cite web |title=ARRLWeb: Part 97 - Amateur Radio Service |publisher=American Radio Relay League |url=http://www.arrl.org/FandES/field/regulations/news/part97/ |access-date=2010-09-27 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309001406/http://www.arrl.org/FandES/field/regulations/news/part97/ |archive-date=2010-03-09 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the Wi-Fi Alliance began using a consumer-friendly generation numbering scheme for the publicly used 802.11 protocols.

Some earlier WLAN technologies used lower frequencies, such as the [[United States|U.S.]] 900&nbsp;MHz ISM band.\n\nLegacy 802.11 with direct-sequence spread spectrum was rapidly supplanted and popularized by 802.11b.\n\n===802.11a (OFDM waveform)===\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11a-1999}}\n\n802.11a, published in 1999, uses the same data link layer protocol and frame format as the original standard, but an [[OFDM]] based air interface (physical layer). It operates in the 5&nbsp;GHz band with a maximum net data rate of 54&nbsp;Mbit/s, plus error correction code, which yields realistic net achievable throughput in the mid-20 Mbit/s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/wireless/2003/08/08/wireless_throughput.html |title=Wireless throughput |access-date=2011-09-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103014005/http://www.oreillynet.com/wireless/2003/08/08/wireless_throughput.html |archive-date=2011-11-03 |df= }}</ref> It has seen widespread worldwide implementation, particularly within the corporate workspace.\n\nSince the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band is heavily used to the point of being crowded, using the relatively unused 5&nbsp;GHz band gives 802.11a a significant advantage. However, this high [[Center frequency|carrier frequency]] also brings a disadvantage: the effective overall range of 802.11a is less than that of 802.11b/g. In theory, 802.11a signals are absorbed more readily by walls and other solid objects in their path due to their smaller wavelength, and, as a result, cannot penetrate as far as those of 802.11b. In practice, 802.11b typically has a higher range at low speeds (802.11b will reduce speed to 5.5&nbsp;Mbit/s or even 1&nbsp;Mbit/s at low signal strengths). 802.11a also suffers from interference,<ref name=\"ACIisharmfull\">{{Cite journal| last1 = Angelakis  | first1 = V.| last2 = Papadakis | first2 = S.| last3 = Siris | first3 = V.A.| last4 = Traganitis | first4 = A.| title = Adjacent channel interference in 802.11a is harmful: Testbed validation of a simple quantification model| journal = Communications Magazine| volume = 49| issue = 3| pages = 160\u2013166| publisher = IEEE| date = March 2011| issn = 0163-6804| doi = 10.1109/MCOM.2011.5723815}}</ref> but locally there may be fewer signals to interfere with, resulting in less interference and better throughput.\n\n===802.11b===\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11b-1999}}\n\nThe 802.11b standard has a maximum raw data rate of 11&nbsp;Mbit/s (Megabits per second), and uses the same media access method defined in the original standard. 802.11b products appeared on the market in early 2000, since 802.11b is a direct extension of the modulation technique defined in the original standard. The dramatic increase in throughput of 802.11b (compared to the original standard) along with simultaneous substantial price reductions led to the rapid acceptance of 802.11b as the definitive wireless LAN technology.\n\nDevices using 802.11b experience interference from other products operating in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band. Devices operating in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz range include microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, baby monitors, cordless telephones, and some amateur radio equipment. As unlicensed intentional radiators in this [[ISM band]], they must not interfere with and must tolerate interference from primary or secondary allocations (users) of this band, such as amateur radio.\n\n===802.11g===\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11g-2003}}\n\nIn June 2003, a third modulation standard was ratified: 802.11g. This works in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band (like 802.11b), but uses the same [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|OFDM]] based transmission scheme as 802.11a. It operates at a maximum physical layer bit rate of 54&nbsp;Mbit/s exclusive of forward error correction codes, or about 22&nbsp;Mbit/s average throughput.<ref name=\"wndw-pdf\">{{cite book|title=Wireless Networking in the Developing World: A practical guide to planning and building low-cost telecommunications infrastructure|publisher=Hacker Friendly LLC|edition=2nd|page=425|year=2007|url=http://wndw.net/pdf/wndw2-en/wndw2-ebook.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006075431/http://www.wndw.net/pdf/wndw2-en/wndw2-ebook.pdf|archive-date=2008-10-06|df=}} page 14</ref> 802.11g hardware is fully backward compatible with 802.11b hardware, and therefore is encumbered with legacy issues that reduce throughput by ~21% when compared to 802.11a.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe then-proposed 802.11g standard was rapidly adopted in the market starting in January 2003, well before ratification, due to the desire for higher data rates as well as reductions in manufacturing costs. By summer 2003, most dual-band 802.11a/b products became dual-band/tri-mode, supporting a and b/g in a single mobile [[adapter card]] or access point. Details of making b and g work well together occupied much of the lingering technical process; in an 802.11g network, however, activity of an 802.11b participant will reduce the data rate of the overall 802.11g network.\n\nLike 802.11b, 802.11g devices also suffer interference from other products operating in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band, for example wireless keyboards.\n\n===802.11-2007===\nIn 2003, task group TGma was authorized to \"roll up\" many of the amendments to the 1999 version of the 802.11 standard.

MU-MIMO allows the Access Point to form beams towards each Client, while transmitting information simultaneously. By doing so, the interference between Clients is reduced, and the overall throughput is increased, since multiple Clients can receive data at the same time. With 802.11ax, a similar multiplexing is introduced in the frequency domain, namely [[OFDMA]]. With this technique, multiple Clients are assigned with different Resource Units in the available spectrum. By doing so, an 80&nbsp;MHz channel can be split into multiple Resource Units, so that multiple Clients receive different type of data over the same spectrum, simultaneously. In order to have enough amount of subcarriers to support the requirements of [[OFDMA]], the number of subcarriers are increased by a factor of 4 (compared to 802.11ac standard). In other words, for 20, 40, 80 and 160&nbsp;MHz channels, there are 64, 128, 256 and 512 subcarriers in 802.11ac standard; while there are 256, 512, 1024 and 2048 subcarriers in 802.11ax standard. Since the available bandwidths have not changed and the number of subcarriers are increased with a factor of 4, the subcarrier spacing is reduced by a factor of 4 as well. This introduces 4 times longer OFDM symbols. E.g., for 802.11ac and 802.11ax, the duration of an OFDM symbol is 3.2 micro seconds and 12.8 micro seconds (both without [[guard interval]]s), respectively.\n\n===802.11ay===\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11ay}}\n{{Update|section|date=March 2015}} <!-- ay: need updating with more relevant info. -->\n\nIEEE 802.11ay is a standard that is being developed.

However, this does not apply to typical deployments in which data is being transferred between two endpoints, of which at least one is typically connected to a wired infrastructure and the other endpoint is connected to an infrastructure via a wireless link.\n\n[[File:ThroughputEnvelope11n.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Graphical representation of [[Wi-Fi]] application specific ([[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]) performance envelope 2.4&nbsp;GHz band, with 802.11n with 40MHz]]\n\nThis means that, typically, data frames pass an 802.11 (WLAN) medium, and are being converted to [[IEEE 802.3|802.3]] ([[Ethernet]]) or vice versa. Due to the difference in the frame (header) lengths of these two media, the application's packet size determines the speed of the data transfer. This means applications that use small packets (e.g., VoIP) create dataflows with high-overhead traffic (i.e., a low [[goodput]]). Other factors that contribute to the overall application data rate are the speed with which the application transmits the packets (i.e., the data rate) and, of course, the energy with which the wireless signal is received. The latter is determined by distance and by the configured output power of the communicating devices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Towards Energy-Awareness in Managing Wireless LAN Applications|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241631429|publisher=IEEE/IFIP NOMS 2012: IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium|access-date=2014-08-11|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813094612/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/241631429_Towards_energy-awareness_in_managing_wireless_LAN_applications?ev=prf_pub|archive-date=2014-08-13|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Application Level Energy and Performance Measurements in a Wireless LAN|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224264522|publisher=The 2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Green Computing and Communications|access-date=2014-08-11|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813113706/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/224264522_Application_Level_Energy_and_Performance_Measurements_in_a_Wireless_LAN?ev=prf_pub|archive-date=2014-08-13|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe same references apply to the attached graphs that show measurements of [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] throughput.

These are commonly referred to as the \"2.4&nbsp;GHz and 5&nbsp;GHz bands\" in most sales literature. Each spectrum is sub-divided into ''channels'' with a center frequency and bandwidth, analogous to the way radio and TV broadcast bands are sub-divided.\n\nThe 2.4&nbsp;GHz band is divided into 14 channels spaced 5&nbsp;MHz apart, beginning with channel&nbsp;1, which is centered on 2.412&nbsp;GHz. The latter channels have additiona\n\n[[File:2.4 GHz Wi-Fi channels (802.11b,g WLAN).svg|thumb|center|upright=3.25|Graphical representation of [[Wi-Fi]] channels in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band]]\n\nThe channel numbering of the {{nowrap|5.725\u20135.875 GHz}} spectrum is less intuitive due to the differences in regulations between countries. These are discussed in greater detail on the [[List of WLAN channels#5GHz|list of WLAN channels]].\n\nChannel spacing within the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band\nIn addition to specifying the channel center frequency, 802.11 also specifies (in Clause 17) a [[spectral mask]] defining the permitted power distribution across each channel. The mask requires the signal be [[Attenuation|attenuated]] a minimum of 20&nbsp;[[decibel|dB]] from its peak amplitude at \u00b111&nbsp;MHz from the centre frequency, the point at which a channel is effectively 22&nbsp;MHz wide.  One consequence is that stations can use only every fourth or fifth channel without overlap.\n\nAvailability of channels is regulated by country, constrained in part by how each country [[Frequency allocation|allocates radio spectrum]] to various services. At one extreme, Japan permits the use of all 14 channels for 802.11b, and {{nowrap|1\u201313}} for 802.11g/n-2.4.  Other countries such as Spain initially allowed only channels 10 and 11, and France allowed only 10, 11, 12, and 13; however, Europe now allow channels 1 through 13.<ref name=\"CNAF\">{{cite web|title=Cuadro nacional de Atribuci\u00f3n de Frecuencias CNAF|publisher=Secretar\u00eda de Estado de Telecomunicaciones |url=http://www.mityc.es/Telecomunicaciones/Secciones/Espectro/cnaf |accessdate=2008-03-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213092618/http://www.mityc.es/Telecomunicaciones/Secciones/Espectro/cnaf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-13}}</ref><ref name=\"ART\">{{cite web|title=Evolution du r\u00e9gime d'autorisation pour les RLAN|publisher=French Telecommunications Regulation Authority (ART)|url=http://www.arcep.fr/uploads/tx_gspublication/evol-rlan-250703.pdf|access-date=2008-10-26|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209172043/http://www.arcep.fr/uploads/tx_gspublication/evol-rlan-250703.pdf|archive-date=2006-12-09|df=}}</ref> North America and some Central and South American countries allow only {{nowrap|1 through 11.}}\n\n[[File:2.4 GHz Wi-Fi channels (802.11g WLAN).svg|thumb|center|upright=3.25|Spectral masks for 802.11g channels {{nowrap|1\u201314}} in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band]]\n\nSince the spectral mask defines only power output restrictions up to \u00b111&nbsp;MHz from the center frequency to be attenuated by \u221250&nbsp;dBr, it is often assumed that the energy of the channel extends no further than these limits. It is more correct to say that, given the separation between channels, the overlapping signal on any channel should be sufficiently attenuated to minimally interfere with a transmitter on any other channel. Due to the [[near-far problem]] a transmitter can impact (desense) a receiver on a \"non-overlapping\" channel, but only if it is close to the victim receiver (within a meter) or operating above allowed power levels. Conversely, a sufficiently distant transmitter on an overlapping channel can have little to no significant effect.\n\nConfusion often arises over the amount of channel separation required between transmitting devices. 802.11b was based on [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]] (DSSS) modulation and utilized a channel bandwidth of 22&nbsp;MHz, resulting in ''three'' \"non-overlapping\" channels (1, 6, and 11). 802.11g was based on OFDM modulation and utilized a channel bandwidth of 20&nbsp;MHz. This occasionally leads to the belief that ''four'' \"non-overlapping\" channels (1, 5, 9, and 13) exist under 802.11g, although this is not the case as per 17.4.6.3 Channel Numbering of operating channels of the IEEE Std 802.11 (2012), which states \"In a multiple cell network topology, overlapping and/or adjacent cells using different channels can operate simultaneously without interference if the distance between the center frequencies is at least 25&nbsp;MHz.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications|url=http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11-2012.pdf|access-date=2013-12-05|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626000833/http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11-2012.pdf|archive-date=2013-06-26|df=}}</ref>\nand section 18.3.9.3 and Figure 18-13.\n\nThis does not mean that the technical overlap of the channels recommends the non-use of overlapping channels.  The amount of inter-channel interference seen on a configuration using channels 1, 5, 9, and 13 (which is permitted in Europe, but not in North America) is barely different from a three-channel configuration, but with an entire extra channel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Choosing the clearest channels for WiFi... continued|url=http://www.wirelesswaffle.com/index.php?m=02&y=13&entry=entry130212-072406|access-date=2013-12-05|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211080940/http://www.wirelesswaffle.com/index.php?m=02&y=13&entry=entry130212-072406|archive-date=2013-12-11|df=}}</ref><ref name=\"adjacentchannels\">{{Cite conference |last1=Garcia Villegas |first1=E. |title=Effect of adjacent-channel interference in IEEE 802.11 WLANs |conference=CrownCom 2007 |publisher=ICST & IEEE |year=2007 |url=https://upcommons.upc.edu/e-prints/bitstream/2117/1234/1/CrownCom07_CReady.pdf |display-authors=etal |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720102658/https://upcommons.upc.edu/e-prints/bitstream/2117/1234/1/CrownCom07_CReady.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-20 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:NonOverlappingChannels2.4GHz802.11-en.svg|thumb|802.11 non-overlapping channels for 2.4GHz.

Current 802.11 standards specify frame types for use in transmission of data as well as management and control of wireless links.\n\nFrames are divided into very specific and standardized sections. Each frame consists of a ''MAC header'', ''payload'', and ''[[frame check sequence]]'' (FCS). Some frames may not have a payload.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Field\n| Frame <br/>control\n| Duration, <br/>{{abbr|id.|association id.}}\n| Address <br/>1\n| Address <br/>2\n| Address <br/>3\n| Sequence <br/>control\n| Address <br/>4\n| {{abbr|QoS|Quality of service}} <br/>control\n| {{abbr|HT|High throughput}} <br/>control\n| Frame <br/>body\n| Frame check <br/>sequence\n|-\n!

This frame control field is subdivided into the following sub-fields:\n* Protocol Version: Two bits representing the protocol version. Currently used protocol version is zero. Other values are reserved for future use.\n* Type: Two bits identifying the type of WLAN frame. Control, Data, and Management are various frame types defined in IEEE 802.11.\n* Subtype: Four bits providing additional discrimination between frames. Type and Subtype are used together to identify the exact frame.\n* ToDS and FromDS: Each is one bit in size. They indicate whether a data frame is headed for a distribution system. Control and management frames set these values to zero. All the data frames will have one of these bits set. However communication within an [[independent basic service set]] (IBSS) network always set these bits to zero.\n* More Fragments: The More Fragments bit is set when a packet is divided into multiple frames for transmission. Every frame except the last frame of a packet will have this bit set.\n* Retry: Sometimes frames require retransmission, and for this there is a Retry bit that is set to one when a frame is resent. This aids in the elimination of duplicate frames.\n* Power Management: This bit indicates the power management state of the sender after the completion of a frame exchange. Access points are required to manage the connection, and will never set the power-saver bit.\n* More Data: The More Data bit is used to buffer frames received in a distributed system. The access point uses this bit to facilitate stations in power-saver mode. It indicates that at least one frame is available, and addresses all stations connected.\n* Protected Frame: The Protected Frame bit is set to one if the frame body is encrypted by a protection mechanism such as [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP), [[Wi-Fi Protected Access#WPA|Wi-Fi Protected Access]] (WPA), or [[Wi-Fi Protected Access#WPA2|Wi-Fi Protected Access II]] (WPA2).\n* Order: This bit is set only when the \"strict ordering\" delivery method is employed. Frames and fragments are not always sent in order as it causes a transmission performance penalty.\n\nThe next two bytes are reserved for the Duration ID field that indicates how long the field's transmission will take so other devices know when the channel will be available again. This field can take one of three forms: Duration, Contention-Free Period (CFP), and Association ID (AID).\n\nAn 802.11 frame can have up to four address fields. Each field can carry a [[MAC address]]. Address 1 is the receiver, Address 2 is the transmitter, Address 3 is used for filtering purposes by the receiver.{{Dubious|date=December 2015}}  Address 4 is only present in data frames transmitted between access points in an [[Extended Service Set]] or between intermediate nodes in a [[mesh networking|mesh network]].\n\nThe remaining fields of the header are:\n* The Sequence Control field is a two-byte section used for identifying message order as well as eliminating duplicate frames. The first 4 bits are used for the fragmentation number, and the last 12 bits are the sequence number.\n* An optional two-byte Quality of Service control field, present in QoS Data frames; it was added with [[802.11e]].\n\nThe payload or frame body field is variable in size, from 0 to 2304 bytes plus any overhead from security encapsulation, and contains information from higher layers.\n\nThe Frame Check Sequence (FCS) is the last four bytes in the standard 802.11 frame. Often referred to as the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), it allows for integrity check of retrieved frames. As frames are about to be sent, the FCS is calculated and appended. When a station receives a frame, it can calculate the FCS of the frame and compare it to the one received. If they match, it is assumed that the frame was not distorted during transmission.<ref name=\"802.11 Technical Section\">{{cite web|url=http://wifi.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/wififrame.html|title=802.11 Technical Section|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124151617/http://wifi.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/wififrame.html|archive-date=2009-01-24}}</ref>\n\n===Management frames===\nManagement frames are [[IEEE 802.11w-2009|not always authenticated]], and allow for the maintenance, or discontinuance, of communication. Some common 802.11 subtypes include:\n* Authentication frame: 802.11 authentication begins with the [[wireless network interface card]] (WNIC) sending an authentication frame to the access point containing its identity. With an open system authentication, the WNIC sends only a single authentication frame, and the access point responds with an authentication frame of its own indicating acceptance or rejection. With shared key authentication, after the WNIC sends its initial authentication request it will receive an authentication frame from the access point containing challenge text. The WNIC sends an authentication frame containing the encrypted version of the challenge text to the access point. The access point ensures the text was encrypted with the correct key by decrypting it with its own key. The result of this process determines the WNIC's authentication status.\n* Association request frame: Sent from a station it enables the access point to allocate resources and synchronize. The frame carries information about the WNIC, including supported data rates and the [[SSID]] of the network the station wishes to associate with. If the request is accepted, the access point reserves memory and establishes an association ID for the WNIC.\n* Association response frame: Sent from an access point to a station containing the acceptance or rejection to an association request. If it is an acceptance, the frame will contain information such an association ID and supported data rates.\n* [[Beacon frame]]: Sent periodically from an access point to announce its presence and provide the [[SSID]], and other parameters for WNICs within range.\n* {{vanchor|Deauthentication frame}}: Sent from a station wishing to terminate connection from another station.\n* Disassociation frame: Sent from a station wishing to terminate connection. It's an elegant way to allow the access point to relinquish memory allocation and remove the WNIC from the association table.\n* Probe request frame: Sent from a station when it requires information from another station.\n* Probe response frame: Sent from an access point containing capability information, supported data rates, etc., after receiving a probe request frame.\n* Reassociation request frame: A WNIC sends a reassociation request when it drops from range of the currently associated access point and finds another access point with a stronger signal. The new access point coordinates the forwarding of any information that may still be contained in the buffer of the previous access point.\n* Reassociation response frame: Sent from an access point containing the acceptance or rejection to a WNIC reassociation request frame. The frame includes information required for association such as the association ID and supported data rates.\n* Action frame: extending management frame to control certain action.   Some of action categories are Block Ack, Radio Measurement, Fast BSS Transition, etc.  These frames are sent by a station when it needs to tell its peer for certain action to be taken. For example, a station can tell another station to set up a [[block acknowledgement]] by sending an ''ADDBA Request'' action frame. The other station would then respond with an ''ADDBA Response'' action frame.\n\nThe body of a management frame consists of frame-subtype-dependent fixed fields followed by a sequence of [[information element]]s (IEs).\n\nThe common structure of an IE is as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Field\n| Type\n| Length\n| Data\n|-\n! Length\n| 1\n| 1\n| 1\u2013252\n|}\n\n===Control frames===\nControl frames facilitate in the exchange of data frames between stations. Some common 802.11 control frames include:\n* Acknowledgement (ACK) frame: After receiving a data frame, the receiving station will send an ACK frame to the sending station if no errors are found. If the sending station doesn't receive an ACK frame within a predetermined period of time, the sending station will resend the frame.\n* Request to Send (RTS) frame: The [[IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS|RTS and CTS frames]] provide an optional collision reduction scheme for access points with hidden stations. A station sends a RTS frame as the first step in a two-way handshake required before sending data frames.\n* Clear to Send (CTS) frame: A station responds to an RTS frame with a CTS frame. It provides clearance for the requesting station to send a data frame. The CTS provides collision control management by including a time value for which all other stations are to hold off transmission while the requesting station transmits.\n\n===Data frames===\nData frames carry packets from web pages, files, etc. within the body.<ref name=\"Frame Types\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/1447501|title=Understanding 802.11 Frame Types|access-date=2008-12-14|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081125033409/http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/1447501|archive-date=2008-11-25|df=}}</ref> The body begins with an [[IEEE 802.2]] header, with the Destination [[Service Access Point]] (DSAP) specifying the protocol, followed by a [[Subnetwork Access Protocol]] (SNAP) header if the DSAP is hex AA, with the [[organizationally unique identifier]] (OUI) and protocol ID (PID) fields specifying the protocol.

To select the correct transmission speed or [[Modulation and Coding Scheme]], a rate control algorithm may test different speeds. The actual packet loss rate of an Access points vary widely for different link conditions. There are variations in the loss rate experienced on production Access points, between 10% and 80%, with 30% being a common average.<ref>{{cite journal|author1= D Murray |author2=T Koziniec |author3=M Dixon |author4=K.

Numerous time constants are defined in terms of TU (rather than the nearly equal millisecond).\n\nAlso the term \"Portal\" is used to describe an entity that is similar to an [[IEEE 802.1|802.1H]] bridge. A Portal provides access to the WLAN by non-802.11 LAN STAs.\n\n==Security==\nIn 2001, a group from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] presented a paper describing weaknesses in the [[802.11]] [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP) security mechanism defined in the original standard; they were followed by [[Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack|Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir]]'s paper titled \"Weaknesses in the Key Scheduling Algorithm of [[RC4]]\". Not long after, Adam Stubblefield and [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] publicly announced the first verification of the attack. In the attack, they were able to intercept transmissions and gain unauthorized access to wireless networks.\n\nThe IEEE set up a dedicated task group to create a replacement security solution, 802.11i (previously this work was handled as part of a broader 802.11e effort to enhance the [[Media Access Control|MAC]] layer). The [[Wi-Fi Alliance]] announced an interim specification called [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]] ([[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]]) based on a subset of the then current IEEE 802.11i draft. These started to appear in products in mid-2003. [[IEEE 802.11i]] (also known as [[WPA2]]) itself was ratified in June 2004, and uses the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] AES, instead of [[RC4]], which was used in WEP. The modern recommended encryption for the home/consumer space is WPA2 (AES Pre-Shared Key), and for the enterprise space is WPA2 along with a [[RADIUS]] authentication server (or another type of authentication server) and a strong authentication method such as [[EAP-TLS]].\n\nIn January 2005, the IEEE set up yet another [[IEEE 802.11w-2009|task group \"w\"]] to protect management and broadcast frames, which previously were sent unsecured. Its standard was published in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |title= Status of Project IEEE 802.11 Task Group w: Protected Management Frames |author= Jesse Walker, Chair |date= May 2009 |url= http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11/Reports/tgw_update.htm |access-date= August 23, 2011 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110927045925/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11/Reports/tgw_update.htm |archive-date= September 27, 2011 |df=  }}</ref>\n\nIn December 2011, a security flaw was revealed that affects some wireless routers with a specific implementation of the optional [[Wi-Fi Protected Setup]] (WPS) feature.

They are created and maintained by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) [[Local area network|LAN]]/[[Metropolitan area network|MAN]] Standards Committee ([[IEEE 802]]). The base version of the standard was released in 1997, and has had subsequent amendments. The standard and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the [[Wi-Fi]] brand. While each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote capabilities of their products. As a result, in the marketplace, each revision tends to become its own standard.\n\nThe protocols are typically used in conjunction with [[IEEE 802.2]], and are designed to interwork seamlessly with [[Ethernet]], and are very often used to carry [[Internet Protocol]] traffic.\n\nAlthough IEEE 802.11 specifications list channels that might be used, the [[radio frequency]] spectrum availability allowed varies significantly by regulatory domain.\n\n==General description==\nThe 802.11 family consists of a series of [[half-duplex]] over-the-air [[modulation]] techniques that use the same basic protocol. The 802.11 protocol family employs [[carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] whereby equipment listens to a channel for other users (including non 802.11 users) before transmitting each packet.\n\n802.11-1997 was the first wireless networking standard in the family, but 802.11b was the first widely accepted one, followed by 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac. Other standards in the family (c\u2013f, h, j) are service amendments that are used to extend the current scope of the existing standard, which may also include corrections to a previous specification.<ref name=\"IEEE-SA Standards Board Operations Manual\">{{cite web |title=IEEE-SA Standards Board Operations Manual |publisher=IEEE-SA |url=https://standards.ieee.org/develop/policies/opman/sect8.html |access-date=2015-09-13 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906183258/http://standards.ieee.org/develop/policies/opman/sect8.html |archive-date=2015-09-06 |df= }}</ref>\n\n802.11b and 802.11g use the 2.4&nbsp;[[hertz|GHz]] [[ISM band]], operating in the United States under [[Part 15 (FCC rules)|Part 15]] of the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] Rules and Regulations; 802.11n can also use that band. Because of this choice of frequency band, 802.11b/g/n equipment may occasionally suffer [[Electromagnetic interference at 2.4 GHz|interference in the 2.4 GHz band]] from [[microwave oven]]s, [[cordless telephone]]s, and [[Bluetooth]] devices etc. 802.11b and 802.11g control their interference and susceptibility to interference by using [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]] (DSSS) and [[orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM) signaling methods, respectively.\n\n802.11a uses the [[U-NII|5&nbsp;GHz U-NII band]], which, for much of the world, offers at least 23 non-overlapping 20&nbsp;MHz-wide channels rather than the 2.4&nbsp;GHz ISM frequency band offering only three non-overlapping 20&nbsp;MHz-wide channels, where other adjacent channels overlap\u2014see [[list of WLAN channels]]. Better or worse performance with higher or lower frequencies (channels) may be realized, depending on the environment. 802.11n can use either the 2.4&nbsp;GHz or 5&nbsp;GHz band; 802.11ac uses only the 5&nbsp;GHz band.\n\nThe segment of the [[radio frequency]] spectrum used by 802.11 varies between countries. In the US, 802.11a and 802.11g devices may be operated without a license, as allowed in Part 15 of the FCC Rules and Regulations. Frequencies used by channels one through six of 802.11b and 802.11g fall within the 2.4&nbsp;GHz [[amateur radio]] band.

It specified two [[net bit rate]]s of 1 or 2 [[Megabit per second|megabits per second]] (Mbit/s), plus [[forward error correction]] code. It specified three alternative [[physical layer]] technologies: diffuse [[infrared]] operating at 1&nbsp;Mbit/s; [[frequency-hopping]] spread spectrum operating at 1&nbsp;Mbit/s or 2&nbsp;Mbit/s; and [[direct-sequence]] spread spectrum operating at 1&nbsp;Mbit/s or 2&nbsp;Mbit/s. The latter two radio technologies used [[microwave]] transmission over the [[ISM band|Industrial Scientific Medical frequency band]] at 2.4&nbsp;GHz. Some earlier WLAN technologies used lower frequencies, such as the [[United States|U.S.]] 900&nbsp;MHz ISM band.\n\nLegacy 802.11 with direct-sequence spread spectrum was rapidly supplanted and popularized by 802.11b.\n\n===802.11a (OFDM waveform)===\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11a-1999}}\n\n802.11a, published in 1999, uses the same data link layer protocol and frame format as the original standard, but an [[OFDM]] based air interface (physical layer). It operates in the 5&nbsp;GHz band with a maximum net data rate of 54&nbsp;Mbit/s, plus error correction code, which yields realistic net achievable throughput in the mid-20 Mbit/s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/wireless/2003/08/08/wireless_throughput.html |title=Wireless throughput |access-date=2011-09-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103014005/http://www.oreillynet.com/wireless/2003/08/08/wireless_throughput.html |archive-date=2011-11-03 |df= }}</ref> It has seen widespread worldwide implementation, particularly within the corporate workspace.\n\nSince the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band is heavily used to the point of being crowded, using the relatively unused 5&nbsp;GHz band gives 802.11a a significant advantage. However, this high [[Center frequency|carrier frequency]] also brings a disadvantage: the effective overall range of 802.11a is less than that of 802.11b/g. In theory, 802.11a signals are absorbed more readily by walls and other solid objects in their path due to their smaller wavelength, and, as a result, cannot penetrate as far as those of 802.11b. In practice, 802.11b typically has a higher range at low speeds (802.11b will reduce speed to 5.5&nbsp;Mbit/s or even 1&nbsp;Mbit/s at low signal strengths). 802.11a also suffers from interference,<ref name=\"ACIisharmfull\">{{Cite journal| last1 = Angelakis  | first1 = V.| last2 = Papadakis | first2 = S.| last3 = Siris | first3 = V.A.| last4 = Traganitis | first4 = A.| title = Adjacent channel interference in 802.11a is harmful: Testbed validation of a simple quantification model| journal = Communications Magazine| volume = 49| issue = 3| pages = 160\u2013166| publisher = IEEE| date = March 2011| issn = 0163-6804| doi = 10.1109/MCOM.2011.5723815}}</ref> but locally there may be fewer signals to interfere with, resulting in less interference and better throughput.\n\n===802.11b===\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11b-1999}}\n\nThe 802.11b standard has a maximum raw data rate of 11&nbsp;Mbit/s (Megabits per second), and uses the same media access method defined in the original standard. 802.11b products appeared on the market in early 2000, since 802.11b is a direct extension of the modulation technique defined in the original standard. The dramatic increase in throughput of 802.11b (compared to the original standard) along with simultaneous substantial price reductions led to the rapid acceptance of 802.11b as the definitive wireless LAN technology.\n\nDevices using 802.11b experience interference from other products operating in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band. Devices operating in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz range include microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, baby monitors, cordless telephones, and some amateur radio equipment. As unlicensed intentional radiators in this [[ISM band]], they must not interfere with and must tolerate interference from primary or secondary allocations (users) of this band, such as amateur radio.\n\n===802.11g===\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11g-2003}}\n\nIn June 2003, a third modulation standard was ratified: 802.11g. This works in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band (like 802.11b), but uses the same [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|OFDM]] based transmission scheme as 802.11a.

By summer 2003, most dual-band 802.11a/b products became dual-band/tri-mode, supporting a and b/g in a single mobile [[adapter card]] or access point. Details of making b and g work well together occupied much of the lingering technical process; in an 802.11g network, however, activity of an 802.11b participant will reduce the data rate of the overall 802.11g network.\n\nLike 802.11b, 802.11g devices also suffer interference from other products operating in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band, for example wireless keyboards.\n\n===802.11-2007===\nIn 2003, task group TGma was authorized to \"roll up\" many of the amendments to the 1999 version of the 802.11 standard.

MU-MIMO allows the Access Point to form beams towards each Client, while transmitting information simultaneously. By doing so, the interference between Clients is reduced, and the overall throughput is increased, since multiple Clients can receive data at the same time. With 802.11ax, a similar multiplexing is introduced in the frequency domain, namely [[OFDMA]]. With this technique, multiple Clients are assigned with different Resource Units in the available spectrum. By doing so, an 80&nbsp;MHz channel can be split into multiple Resource Units, so that multiple Clients receive different type of data over the same spectrum, simultaneously. In order to have enough amount of subcarriers to support the requirements of [[OFDMA]], the number of subcarriers are increased by a factor of 4 (compared to 802.11ac standard). In other words, for 20, 40, 80 and 160&nbsp;MHz channels, there are 64, 128, 256 and 512 subcarriers in 802.11ac standard; while there are 256, 512, 1024 and 2048 subcarriers in 802.11ax standard. Since the available bandwidths have not changed and the number of subcarriers are increased with a factor of 4, the subcarrier spacing is reduced by a factor of 4 as well. This introduces 4 times longer OFDM symbols. E.g., for 802.11ac and 802.11ax, the duration of an OFDM symbol is 3.2 micro seconds and 12.8 micro seconds (both without [[guard interval]]s), respectively.\n\n===802.11ay===\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11ay}}\n{{Update|section|date=March 2015}} <!-- ay: need updating with more relevant info. -->\n\nIEEE 802.11ay is a standard that is being developed.

However, this does not apply to typical deployments in which data is being transferred between two endpoints, of which at least one is typically connected to a wired infrastructure and the other endpoint is connected to an infrastructure via a wireless link.\n\n[[File:ThroughputEnvelope11n.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Graphical representation of [[Wi-Fi]] application specific ([[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]) performance envelope 2.4&nbsp;GHz band, with 802.11n with 40MHz]]\n\nThis means that, typically, data frames pass an 802.11 (WLAN) medium, and are being converted to [[IEEE 802.3|802.3]] ([[Ethernet]]) or vice versa. Due to the difference in the frame (header) lengths of these two media, the application's packet size determines the speed of the data transfer. This means applications that use small packets (e.g., VoIP) create dataflows with high-overhead traffic (i.e., a low [[goodput]]). Other factors that contribute to the overall application data rate are the speed with which the application transmits the packets (i.e., the data rate) and, of course, the energy with which the wireless signal is received. The latter is determined by distance and by the configured output power of the communicating devices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Towards Energy-Awareness in Managing Wireless LAN Applications|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241631429|publisher=IEEE/IFIP NOMS 2012: IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium|access-date=2014-08-11|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813094612/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/241631429_Towards_energy-awareness_in_managing_wireless_LAN_applications?ev=prf_pub|archive-date=2014-08-13|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Application Level Energy and Performance Measurements in a Wireless LAN|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224264522|publisher=The 2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Green Computing and Communications|access-date=2014-08-11|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813113706/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/224264522_Application_Level_Energy_and_Performance_Measurements_in_a_Wireless_LAN?ev=prf_pub|archive-date=2014-08-13|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe same references apply to the attached graphs that show measurements of [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] throughput.

These are commonly referred to as the \"2.4&nbsp;GHz and 5&nbsp;GHz bands\" in most sales literature. Each spectrum is sub-divided into ''channels'' with a center frequency and bandwidth, analogous to the way radio and TV broadcast bands are sub-divided.\n\nThe 2.4&nbsp;GHz band is divided into 14 channels spaced 5&nbsp;MHz apart, beginning with channel&nbsp;1, which is centered on 2.412&nbsp;GHz. The latter channels have additional restrictions or are unavailable for use in some regulatory domains.\n\n[[File:2.4 GHz Wi-Fi channels (802.11b,g WLAN).svg|thumb|center|upright=3.25|Graphical representation of [[Wi-Fi]] channels in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band]]\n\nThe channel numbering of the {{nowrap|5.725\u20135.875 GHz}} spectrum is less intuitive due to the differences in regulations between countries. These are discussed in greater detail on the [[List of WLAN channels#5GHz|list of WLAN channels]].\n\n===Channel spacing within the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band===\nIn addition to specifying the channel center frequency, 802.11 also specifies (in Clause 17) a [[spectral mask]] defining the permitted power distribution across each channel. The mask requires the signal be [[Attenuation|attenuated]] a minimum of 20&nbsp;[[decibel|dB]] from its peak amplitude at \u00b111&nbsp;MHz from the centre frequency, the point at which a channel is effectively 22&nbsp;MHz wide.  One consequence is that stations can use only every fourth or fifth channel without overlap.\n\nAvailability of channels is regulated by country, constrained in part by how each country [[Frequency allocation|allocates radio spectrum]] to various services. At one extreme, Japan permits the use of all 14 channels for 802.11b, and {{nowrap|1\u201313}} for 802.11g/n-2.4.

It is more correct to say that, given the separation between channels, the overlapping signal on any channel should be sufficiently attenuated to minimally interfere with a transmitter on any other channel. Due to the [[near-far problem]] a transmitter can impact (desense) a receiver on a \"non-overlapping\" channel, but only if it is close to the victim receiver (within a meter) or operating above allowed power levels. Conversely, a sufficiently distant transmitter on an overlapping channel can have little to no significant effect.\n\nConfusion often arises over the amount of channel separation required between transmitting devices. 802.11b was based on [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]] (DSSS) modulation and utilized a channel bandwidth of 22&nbsp;MHz, resulting in ''three'' \"non-overlapping\" channels (1, 6, and 11). 802.11g was based on OFDM modulation and utilized a channel bandwidth of 20&nbsp;MHz. This occasionally leads to the belief that ''four'' \"non-overlapping\" channels (1, 5, 9, and 13) exist under 802.11g, although this is not the case as per 17.4.6.3 Channel Numbering of operating channels of the IEEE Std 802.11 (2012), which states \"In a multiple cell network topology, overlapping and/or adjacent cells using different channels can operate simultaneously without interference if the distance between the center frequencies is at least 25&nbsp;MHz.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications|url=http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11-2012.pdf|access-date=2013-12-05|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626000833/http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11-2012.pdf|archive-date=2013-06-26|df=}}</ref>\nand section 18.3.9.3 and Figure 18-13.\n\nThis does not mean that the technical overlap of the channels recommends the non-use of overlapping channels.  The amount of inter-channel interference seen on a configuration using channels 1, 5, 9, and 13 (which is permitted in Europe, but not in North America) is barely different from a three-channel configuration, but with an entire extra channel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Choosing the clearest channels for WiFi... continued|url=http://www.wirelesswaffle.com/index.php?m=02&y=13&entry=entry130212-072406|access-date=2013-12-05|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211080940/http://www.wirelesswaffle.com/index.php?m=02&y=13&entry=entry130212-072406|archive-date=2013-12-11|df=}}</ref><ref name=\"adjacentchannels\">{{Cite conference |last1=Garcia Villegas |first1=E. |title=Effect of adjacent-channel interference in IEEE 802.11 WLANs |conference=CrownCom 2007 |publisher=ICST & IEEE |year=2007 |url=https://upcommons.upc.edu/e-prints/bitstream/2117/1234/1/CrownCom07_CReady.pdf |display-authors=etal |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720102658/https://upcommons.upc.edu/e-prints/bitstream/2117/1234/1/CrownCom07_CReady.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-20 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:NonOverlappingChannels2.4GHz802.11-en.svg|thumb|802.11 non-overlapping channels for 2.4GHz.

Different countries define different levels of allowable transmitter power, time that a channel can be occupied, and different available channels.<ref>IEEE Standard 802.11-2007 page 531</ref> Domain codes are specified for the United States, [[Canada]], [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute|ETSI (Europe)]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Japan]], and [[China]].\n\nMost [[Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi certified]] devices default to ''regdomain'' 0, which means [[least common denominator]] settings, i.e., the device will not transmit at a power above the allowable power in any nation, nor will it use frequencies that are not permitted in any nation.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}<!-- is this even possible? No ''regdomain'' 0 behavior shows up in 802.11-2007 that I can find -->\n\nThe ''regdomain'' setting is often made difficult or impossible to change so that the end users do not conflict with local regulatory agencies such as the [[United States]]' [[Federal Communications Commission]].\n\n==Layer 2 \u2013 Datagrams==\nThe [[datagram]]s are called ''frames''. Current 802.11 standards specify frame types for use in transmission of data as well as management and control of wireless links.\n\nFrames are divided into very specific and standardized sections. Each frame consists of a ''MAC header'', ''payload'', and ''[[frame check sequence]]'' (FCS). Some frames may not have a payload.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Field\n| Frame <br/>control\n| Duration, <br/>{{abbr|id.|association id.}}\n| Address <br/>1\n| Address <br/>2\n| Address <br/>3\n| Sequence <br/>control\n| Address <br/>4\n| {{abbr|QoS|Quality of service}} <br/>control\n| {{abbr|HT|High throughput}} <br/>control\n| Frame <br/>body\n| Frame check <br/>sequence\n|-\n! Length\n| 2\n| 2\n| 6\n| 6\n| 6\n| 0, or 2\n| 6\n| 0, or 2\n| 0, or 4\n| {{n/a|''Variable''}}\n| 4\n|}\n\nThe first two bytes of the MAC header form a frame control field specifying the form and function of the frame. This frame control field is subdivided into the following sub-fields:\n* Protocol Version: Two bits representing the protocol version. Currently used protocol version is zero. Other values are reserved for future use.\n* Type: Two bits identifying the type of WLAN frame. Control, Data, and Management are various frame types defined in IEEE 802.11.\n* Subtype: Four bits providing additional discrimination between frames. Type and Subtype are used together to identify the exact frame.\n* ToDS and FromDS: Each is one bit in size. They indicate whether a data frame is headed for a distribution system. Control and management frames set these values to zero. All the data frames will have one of these bits set. However communication within an [[independent basic service set]] (IBSS) network always set these bits to zero.\n* More Fragments: The More Fragments bit is set when a packet is divided into multiple frames for transmission. Every frame except the last frame of a packet will have this bit set.\n* Retry: Sometimes frames require retransmission, and for this there is a Retry bit that is set to one when a frame is resent. This aids in the elimination of duplicate frames.\n* Power Management: This bit indicates the power management state of the sender after the completion of a frame exchange. Access points are required to manage the connection, and will never set the power-saver bit.\n* More Data: The More Data bit is used to buffer frames received in a distributed system. The access point uses this bit to facilitate stations in power-saver mode. It indicates that at least one frame is available, and addresses all stations connected.\n* Protected Frame: The Protected Frame bit is set to one if the frame body is encrypted by a protection mechanism such as [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP), [[Wi-Fi Protected Access#WPA|Wi-Fi Protected Access]] (WPA), or [[Wi-Fi Protected Access#WPA2|Wi-Fi Protected Access II]] (WPA2).\n* Order: This bit is set only when the \"strict ordering\" delivery method is employed. Frames and fragments are not always sent in order as it causes a transmission performance penalty.\n\nThe next two bytes are reserved for the Duration ID field that indicates how long the field's transmission will take so other devices know when the channel will be available again. This field can take one of three forms: Duration, Contention-Free Period (CFP), and Association ID (AID).\n\nAn 802.11 frame can have up to four address fields. Each field can carry a [[MAC address]]. Address 1 is the receiver, Address 2 is the transmitter, Address 3 is used for filtering purposes by the receiver.{{Dubious|date=December 2015}}  Address 4 is only present in data frames transmitted between access points in an [[Extended Service Set]] or between intermediate nodes in a [[mesh networking|mesh network]].\n\nThe remaining fields of the header are:\n* The Sequence Control field is a two-byte section used for identifying message order as well as eliminating duplicate frames. The first 4 bits are used for the fragmentation number, and the last 12 bits are the sequence number.\n* An optional two-byte Quality of Service control field, present in QoS Data frames; it was added with [[802.11e]].\n\nThe payload or frame body field is variable in size, from 0 to 2304 bytes plus any overhead from security encapsulation, and contains information from higher layers.\n\nThe Frame Check Sequence (FCS) is the last four bytes in the standard 802.11 frame. Often referred to as the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), it allows for integrity check of retrieved frames. As frames are about to be sent, the FCS is calculated and appended. When a station receives a frame, it can calculate the FCS of the frame and compare it to the one received. If they match, it is assumed that the frame was not distorted during transmission.<ref name=\"802.11 Technical Section\">{{cite web|url=http://wifi.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/wififrame.html|title=802.11 Technical Section|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124151617/http://wifi.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/wififrame.html|archive-date=2009-01-24}}</ref>\n\n===Management frames===\nManagement frames are [[IEEE 802.11w-2009|not always authenticated]], and allow for the maintenance, or discontinuance, of communication. Some common 802.11 subtypes include:\n* Authentication frame: 802.11 authentication begins with the [[wireless network interface card]] (WNIC) sending an authentication frame to the access point containing its identity. With an open system authentication, the WNIC sends only a single authentication frame, and the access point responds with an authentication frame of its own indicating acceptance or rejection. With shared key authentication, after the WNIC sends its initial authentication request it will receive an authentication frame from the access point containing challenge text. The WNIC sends an authentication frame containing the encrypted version of the challenge text to the access point. The access point ensures the text was encrypted with the correct key by decrypting it with its own key. The result of this process determines the WNIC's authentication status.\n* Association request frame: Sent from a station it enables the access point to allocate resources and synchronize. The frame carries information about the WNIC, including supported data rates and the [[SSID]] of the network the station wishes to associate with. If the request is accepted, the access point reserves memory and establishes an association ID for the WNIC.\n* Association response frame: Sent from an access point to a station containing the acceptance or rejection to an association request. If it is an acceptance, the frame will contain information such an association ID and supported data rates.\n* [[Beacon frame]]: Sent periodically from an access point to announce its presence and provide the [[SSID]], and other parameters for WNICs within range.\n* {{vanchor|Deauthentication frame}}: Sent from a station wishing to terminate connection from another station.\n* Disassociation frame: Sent from a station wishing to terminate connection. It's an elegant way to allow the access point to relinquish memory allocation and remove the WNIC from the association table.\n* Probe request frame: Sent from a station when it requires information from another station.\n* Probe response frame: Sent from an access point containing capability information, supported data rates, etc., after receiving a probe request frame.\n* Reassociation request frame: A WNIC sends a reassociation request when it drops from range of the currently associated access point and finds another access point with a stronger signal. The new access point coordinates the forwarding of any information that may still be contained in the buffer of the previous access point.\n* Reassociation response frame: Sent from an access point containing the acceptance or rejection to a WNIC reassociation request frame. The frame includes information required for association such as the association ID and supported data rates.\n* Action frame: extending management frame to control certain action.   Some of action categories are Block Ack, Radio Measurement, Fast BSS Transition, etc.  These frames are sent by a station when it needs to tell its peer for certain action to be taken. For example, a station can tell another station to set up a [[block acknowledgement]] by sending an ''ADDBA Request'' action frame. The other station would then respond with an ''ADDBA Response'' action frame.\n\nThe body of a management frame consists of frame-subtype-dependent fixed fields followed by a sequence of [[information element]]s (IEs).\n\nThe common structure of an IE is as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Field\n| Type\n| Length\n| Data\n|-\n! Length\n| 1\n| 1\n| 1\u2013252\n|}\n\n===Control frames===\nControl frames facilitate in the exchange of data frames between stations. Some common 802.11 control frames include:\n* Acknowledgement (ACK) frame: After receiving a data frame, the receiving station will send an ACK frame to the sending station if no errors are found. If the sending station doesn't receive an ACK frame within a predetermined period of time, the sending station will resend the frame.\n* Request to Send (RTS) frame: The [[IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS|RTS and CTS frames]] provide an optional collision reduction scheme for access points with hidden stations. A station sends a RTS frame as the first step in a two-way handshake required before sending data frames.\n* Clear to Send (CTS) frame: A station responds to an RTS frame with a CTS frame. It provides clearance for the requesting station to send a data frame. The CTS provides collision control management by including a time value for which all other stations are to hold off transmission while the requesting station transmits.\n\n===Data frames===\nData frames carry packets from web pages, files, etc. within the body.<ref name=\"Frame Types\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/1447501|title=Understanding 802.11 Frame Types|access-date=2008-12-14|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081125033409/http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/1447501|archive-date=2008-11-25|df=}}</ref> The body begins with an [[IEEE 802.2]] header, with the Destination [[Service Access Point]] (DSAP) specifying the protocol, followed by a [[Subnetwork Access Protocol]] (SNAP) header if the DSAP is hex AA, with the [[organizationally unique identifier]] (OUI) and protocol ID (PID) fields specifying the protocol.

To select the correct transmission speed or [[Modulation and Coding Scheme]], a rate control algorithm may test different speeds. The actual packet loss rate of an Access points vary widely for different link conditions. There are variations in the loss rate experienced on production Access points, between 10% and 80%, with 30% being a common average.<ref>{{cite journal|author1= D Murray |author2=T Koziniec |author3=M Dixon |author4=K.

Numerous time constants are defined in terms of TU (rather than the nearly equal millisecond).\n\nAlso the term \"Portal\" is used to describe an entity that is similar to an [[IEEE 802.1|802.1H]] bridge. A Portal provides access to the WLAN by non-802.11 LAN STAs.\n\n==Security==\nIn 2001, a group from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] presented a paper describing weaknesses in the [[802.11]] [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP) security mechanism defined in the original standard; they were followed by [[Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack|Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir]]'s paper titled \"Weaknesses in the Key Scheduling Algorithm of [[RC4]]\". Not long after, Adam Stubblefield and [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] publicly announced the first verification of the attack. In the attack, they were able to intercept transmissions and gain unauthorized access to wireless networks.\n\nThe IEEE set up a dedicated task group to create a replacement security solution, 802.11i (previously this work was handled as part of a broader 802.11e effort to enhance the [[Media Access Control|MAC]] layer). The [[Wi-Fi Alliance]] announced an interim specification called [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]] ([[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]]) based on a subset of the then current IEEE 802.11i draft. These started to appear in products in mid-2003. [[IEEE 802.11i]] (also known as [[WPA2]]) itself was ratified in June 2004, and uses the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] AES, instead of [[RC4]], which was used in WEP. The modern recommended encryption for the home/consumer space is WPA2 (AES Pre-Shared Key), and for the enterprise space is WPA2 along with a [[RADIUS]] authentication server (or another type of authentication server) and a strong authentication method such as [[EAP-TLS]].\n\nIn January 2005, the IEEE set up yet another [[IEEE 802.11w-2009|task group \"w\"]] to protect management and broadcast frames, which previously were sent unsecured. Its standard was published in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |title= Status of Project IEEE 802.11 Task Group w: Protected Management Frames |author= Jesse Walker, Chair |date= May 2009 |url= http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11/Reports/tgw_update.htm |access-date= August 23, 2011 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110927045925/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11/Reports/tgw_update.htm |archive-date= September 27, 2011 |df=  }}</ref>\n\nIn December 2011, a security flaw was revealed that affects some wireless routers with a specific implementation of the optional [[Wi-Fi Protected Setup]] (WPS) feature. While WPS is not a part of 802.11, the flaw allows an attacker within the range of the wireless router to recover the WPS PIN and, with it, the router's 802.11i password in a few hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sviehb.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/viehboeck_wps.pdf |website=.braindump \u2013 RE and stuff |title=Brute forcing Wi-Fi Protected Setup |date=2011-12-26 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118105726/http://sviehb.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/viehboeck_wps.pdf |archive-date=2012-01-18 |df= }}</ref><ref>[[United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team|US CERT]] [http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/723755 Vulnerability Note VU#723755] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103152902/http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/723755 |date=2012-01-03 }}</ref>\n\nIn late 2014, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] announced that its [[iOS]]&nbsp;8 mobile operating system would scramble MAC addresses<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/9/5792970/ios-8-strikes-an-unexpected-blow-against-location-tracking|title=iOS 8 strikes an unexpected blow against location tracking|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402001224/http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/9/5792970/ios-8-strikes-an-unexpected-blow-against-location-tracking|archive-date=2015-04-02|df=}}</ref> during the pre-association stage to thwart [[People counter|retail footfall tracking]] made possible by the regular transmission of uniquely identifiable probe requests.\n\nWi-Fi users may be subjected to a [[Wi-Fi deauthentication attack]] to eavesdrop, attack passwords or simply to force the use of another, usually more expensive access point.\n\n==Non-standard 802.11 extensions and equipment==\n{{Main|802.11 non-standard equipment}}\n\nMany companies implement wireless networking equipment with non-IEEE standard 802.11 extensions either by implementing proprietary or draft features.

The company was formed by Stoklasa in 2004 while living in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], but is based in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] as of 2011. It attracted significant attention in 2009 through Stoklasa's 70-minute video review of the 1999 film ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]''. The review was posted in seven parts on [[YouTube]], and was presented by his character \"Harry S. Plinkett\". While Stoklasa had published other video reviews of several [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' films]] before that, his ''The Phantom Menace'' and subsequent [[Star Wars#Prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequel]] reviews were praised for both content and presentation.\n\nNumerous other series have been produced by RedLetterMedia, including several review-based web series (''Half in the Bag'', ''Best of the Worst'', and ''re:View''), short comedies (''The Nerd Crew'') and [[web series]] (''The Grabowskis''). Low budget features produced by and starring Stoklasa and Red Letter Media affiliates have been largely horror and comedy, such as ''Feeding Frenzy'', ''The Recovered'', ''Oranges: Revenge of the Eggplant'' and ''[[Space Cop]]''. Alongside Stoklasa and Bauman, Red Letter Media also employs Rich Evans as a full-time actor and stagehand for their projects. Stoklasa, Bauman, Evans and friends Jack Packard, Josh Davis and Jessi Nakles appear as cast members for the vast majority of their releases.\n\n==Mr. Plinkett {{anchor|Mr. Plinkett}}==\nStoklasa created his first video review for ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' after watching the film again in 2008.

He demonstrates this by asking his friends to describe characters from the original trilogy and ''Phantom Menace'' without referring to the characters' physical appearances or occupations. Juxtaposed with the colorful personality descriptions they give for the characters [[Han Solo]] and [[C-3PO]], Stoklasa's friends are unable to come up with similarly definite descriptions for the ''Phantom Menace'' characters [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]].<ref name=\"dailybeast\"/><ref name=\"ifc\"/> Stoklasa believes that many of the decisions made by Jinn's character are highly questionable.<ref name=\"cinemablend\"/> He further suggests that the character is entirely unnecessary to the plot and overall story save to have a final climactic lightsaber battle.<ref name=\"popmatters\"/> He notes Lucas' attempt to add more concurrent plot elements in each of the successive ''Star Wars'' films, which he refers to as \"The Ending Multiplication Effect\".<ref name=\"ifc\"/> Stoklasa then illustrates the chaotic and confusing nature of ending the film by pulling together four concurrent plot threads, each with a radically different tone, unclear objectives, and an overall lack of proper character motivation.\n\n===Reception===\nStoklasa's reviews have been considered part of an emerging art form that hybridize [[mashup (video)|mashup]] with video essays, as they use a combination of footage from the movie in question and other related sources.\n\nLiterary and cultural critic Benjamin Kirbach argues that Plinkett enacts a kind of ''[[d\u00e9tournement]]'' by recontextualizing images that would otherwise serve as ''Star Wars'' marketing material (such as behind-the-scenes footage and interviews). Defined by [[Guy Debord]] as \"the reuse of preexisting artistic elements in a new ensemble\", ''d\u00e9tournement'' is a way of generating meaning out of cultural texts that is antithetical to their original intent.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 109|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref> Kirbach argues that Stoklasa uses this tactic to construct a subversive narrative that frames George Lucas as \"a lazy, out-of-touch, and thoroughly unchallenged filmmaker\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 108|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nKirbach also argues that Plinkett's popularity can be explained, in part, as a form of [[catharsis]]. Because he is portrayed as insane, the Plinkett shtick \"legitimates our nerd-rage by literalizing it\".<ref name=\"Kirbach 2014 112\">{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 112|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref> Plinkett enrolls George Lucas in an ongoing [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] drama as the castrating father figure, a father figure we are invited to rage against owing to his flagrant ineptitude. But aside from raw catharsis, Kirbach claims that Plinkett's insanity is also a critique of the film industry itself. By fictionalizing his critic, Stoklasa constructs a character who is unable to speak at a safe distance from the text he analyzes. \"Plinkett becomes the figure of a consumer culture that has been force-fed Hollywood schlock beyond its carrying capacity,\" Kirbach writes.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 111|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref> And further:\n\n{{quote|Stoklasa's major conceit\u2014that someone would have to be \"crazy\" to watch movies the way Plinkett does\u2014also implies a barely hidden inverse: that the film industry has induced a consumerist fantasy in people who ''don't'' watch movies this way. Plinkett's obscenity and jokiness are without a doubt designed to garner viewership, but they are also Stoklasa's apology for\u2014or defense against\u2014a culture that already construes his level of passion as pathological. This central irony leads us to question what is actually more insane: the consumer who rejects the expressions of a massive culture industry, or the massive culture industry itself. Plinkett satirizes the kind of consumer such a system generates: psychotic, sexist, homicidal.<ref name=\"Kirbach 2014 112\"/>}}\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', comedian [[Patton Oswalt]] noted that the Mr. Plinkett reviews are an example of \"amazing film scholarship\" on the ''Star Wars'' prequels that demonstrate how much of the ''Star Wars'' universe is squandered by them.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/patton-oswalt-silver-screen-fiend-interview | title = Patton Oswalt on Movie Addiction, Star Wars, and the One Film He'd Watch on Loop | first = Jennifer | last = Wood | date = January 27, 2015 | accessdate = January 27, 2015 | work = [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] }}</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called the reviews \"legendary\" and described them as being more popular than the actual films.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/star-wars-the-force-awakens/george-lucas-movies-hate-defence/ |title=Why it's time to stop hating George Lucas |work= The Daily Telegraph |first=Chris|last=Bell|date=December 16, 2015 |accessdate= December 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the reviews have also been criticized by ''Star Wars'' fans. Stoklasa stated that he feels \"''Star Wars'' to some people is like a religion so they respond to attacks on it as such.\"<ref name = \"gp-interview\"/> One fan wrote a 108-page-long point-by-point response to the ''Phantom Menace'' review, taking issue with many of Stoklasa's criticisms,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-fan-writes-108page-rebuttal-red-letter-medias-phantom-menace-review/ |title='Star Wars' Fan Writes 108-Page Rebuttal to Red Letter Media's 'Phantom Menace' Review |publisher=/Film |first=Germain |last=Lussier |date=January 13, 2011 |accessdate=February 4, 2011 }}</ref> which Stoklasa mocked in an announcement video for his ''Revenge of the Sith'' review.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTpWzg4aiEU |title= Episode 3 Review is now up ...|publisher=[[YouTube]] |author=Red Letter Media |accessdate=June 3, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDirector [[Jordan Vogt-Roberts]], whilst critiquing [[CinemaSins|CinemaSins']] ''Everything Wrong With ...'' video of his film, ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'', for bad film criticism masked under the guise of \"satire\", praised Red Letter Media for good film criticism and satire, stating that \"Red Letter Media's Phantom Menace review IS satire.

Among the low-budget features Stoklasa and Bauman have produced and directed on Red Letter Media are the action-comedy film ''[[Oranges: Revenge of the Eggplant]]'', made in 2005 and available on [[Netflix]]<ref name=\"heeb\" /> (currently only available for DVD rental, not for streaming); ''The Recovered'', a horror thriller starring [[Tina Krause]]; and ''Feeding Frenzy'', a 2010 [[genre]]-[[parody|spoof]] of puppet monster movies like ''[[Gremlins]]''. ''Feeding Frenzy'' featured Rich Evans as Mr. Plinkett; Evans originated the character in short films, and this feature was filmed before the popularity of the ''Phantom Menace'' review.<ref name = \"gp-interview\"/> Stoklasa's short films are usually dark comedies. Plinkett, played by Evans, appeared in several of them, starting with \"You're Invited\".\n\nStoklasa created and starred in five seasons of the web sitcom ''The Grabowskis'', opposite Dixie Jacobs, about an exaggeratedly trashy and unpleasant sitcom family. Installments of the series were only a few seconds long at first (comically giving more screen time to the lengthy intro than the episode itself), but grew to full episode length over time.\n\nOn October 26, 2015, the company announced via a short video that it had completed the feature-length film ''[[Space Cop]]'', which had been in production for at least seven years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://redlettermedia.com/shorts/space-cop-trailer/|title=Space Cop Trailer #1 - Red Letter Media|website=redlettermedia.com}}</ref> ''Space Cop'' stars Evans in the titular role alongside Stoklasa, who wrote and directed the film. It was made available on January 12, 2016, on Blu-ray for $25 through Red Letter Media's [[Bandcamp]] page. The first run sold out in a matter of hours.\n\n==''Half in the Bag''==\n''Half in the Bag'' is a regularly released series in which Stoklasa and Bauman review films in a more traditional format, albeit with a haphazard and [[Fourth wall|fourth wall breaking]] overarching plot. Stoklasa has described it as a cross between ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel and Ebert]]'' and a 1980s [[sitcom]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}, with himself and Bauman playing [[videocassette recorder|VCR]] repairmen who discuss movies whilst finding increasingly convoluted ways of avoiding their scheduled repair work on Mr. Plinkett's VCR.\n\nThe show often features Plinkett portrayed by Evans. Fans often call this iteration of the character \"Fake Plinkett\", but Stoklasa has noted that Evans was the first person to portray Plinkett, with Stoklasa's later portrayal based on Evans's performance. [[Tim Heidecker]], who hosts a satirical movie review show ''[[On Cinema]]'', makes a cameo in episode 37 as the owner of the VCR repair shop who bequeaths employment to Jay and Mike.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1C7UCMmF5g |title=Half in the Bag: Episode 37 - Special guest star Tim Heidecker |last=RedLetterMedia |date=2012-08-07 |access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref>\n\nStoklasa stated that this series would not replace the Plinkett reviews. The first episode premiered on March 12, 2011, with a review of ''[[Drive Angry]]'' and ''[[The Adjustment Bureau]]''.\n\n[[Graham Linehan]] praised Red Letter Media in an interview with [[United Kingdom|British]] comedian and writer [[Richard Herring]] on ''[[Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast]]''. He spoke particularly about the ''Half in the Bag'' review of ''[[Jack and Jill (2011 film)|Jack and Jill]]'', which he described as \"brilliant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzsR1e5NFl4&t=48m20s|title=Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast - with Graham Linehan #111|first=|last=Richard Herring|date=26 August 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==''Best of the Worst''==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2019}}\n{{overly detailed|date=August 2019}}\n}}\n\n''Best of the Worst'' is a regularly-released series in which members of Red Letter Media watch and review multiple films ranging from B-movies to instructional videos, sometimes sent in by fans.<ref name=MakeUseOf>{{cite web |url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/red-letter-media-cinema-themed-comedy-for-film-fans-stuff-to-watch/ |title=Red Letter Media: Cinema-Themed Comedy For Film Fans [Stuff to Watch] |publisher=[[MakeUseOf]] |author=Tim Brookes |date=December 10, 2013 |accessdate=January 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117003120/http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/red-letter-media-cinema-themed-comedy-for-film-fans-stuff-to-watch/ |archivedate=January 17, 2014 |df= }}</ref> After viewing and riffing on the films, a rotating panel of four sit to discuss what they just watched, typically expressing further contempt or ridicule for what they have just seen, though occasionally offering praise for films that show uncommon quality or effort. Panels typically consist of any combination of Mike Stoklasa, Jay Bauman, Rich Evans, Jessi Nakles, Jack Packard, Josh \"The Wizard\" Davis, or special guests. Panel participants then individually decide upon which film or video represents the \"Best of the Worst\". Viewing material that is deemed to be insulting, offensive, or especially poor is often destroyed in a creative fashion. Methods of destruction have included dissolving a VHS tape in [[acetone]], forcing a DVD through a [[paper shredder]], dragging a tape around the streets tied to the bumper of a car, and cooking a tape on a charcoal grill alongside cheeseburgers.\n\nCanadian visual effects artists Colin Cunningham and Jim Maxwell, who have worked on numerous television series' and feature films, frequently appear as recurring guests. Special guests on the show have included screenwriters [[Max Landis]] and [[Simon Barrett (filmmaker)|Simon Barrett]], comic book artist [[Freddie Williams II|Freddie Williams]], actors [[Macaulay Culkin]] and [[Patton Oswalt]], comedian Gillian Bellinger and indie film auteur Len Kabasinski.\n\nSome episodes feature the \"Wheel of the Worst\", in which a wheel is spun to select which films/videos will be watched.<ref name=\"MakeUseOf\"/> Wheel selections are often videos that are either extremely bizarre (such as \"Dog Sitter\", a movie made to appeal to dogs), low budget instructional films, educational films and those which have little modern relevance (such as Chinese-language instructional tapes about how to use [[AOL]]). Videos featured on Wheel of the Worst are most frequently found on VHS tapes. The ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]'' praised ''Best of the Worst'' for being Red Letter Media's most entertaining series.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140117/entlife/701179987/|title= Hibernating? Chill out with offbeat shows, DVDs |newspaper=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]] |author=Sean Stangland |date=January 17, 2014 |accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe show occasionally features other gimmicks to randomly select viewing material such as the \"Choose-And-Lose\" and the [[Plinko|Plinketto Board]]. Another subsection of Best of the Worst includes the \"Black Spine Edition\" where the group randomly selects VHS tapes which are missing informational or identification labels on the side of the cassette.\n\nSometimes the crew will review a specific film which they have previously viewed off camera and recommend to fans of poorly-conceived and poorly-executed [[B movie]]s. They refer to reviews of this nature as their \"Spotlight Series\". The first of these reviews featured the film ''Hollywood Cop'' by director [[Amir Shervan]] was released on YouTube on June 21, 2017. In this format, low budget indie movies ''Suburban Sasquatch'', ''Lycan Colony'' and ''The Last Vampire on Earth'' have also been featured.\n\nIn 2019, the crew introduced a 'Hall of Fame' for Best of the Worst, intended to represent the best things that have appeared on the show. There have only been three additions to the hall of fame thus far; actor [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] and low-budget films ''Surviving Edged Weapons'' and ''[[Creating Rem Lezar]]''.\n\n==''re:View''==\nOn May 24, 2016, the company released the first episode of a new series called ''re:View''. Compared to the company's other shows, the format is a much more stripped down and straight forward approach to film critique. Two members of Red Letter Media sit in front of a red curtain and offer thoughts and insight on a film that they both enjoy. Films chosen for this feature are often either [[Cult Film|cult classics]] such as ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'' and ''[[Martin (1978 film)|Martin]]'', or well renowned genre-defining films like ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' and ''[[Ghostbusters]]''. Clips of the film being discussed are interwoven, typically to lend emphasis to a specific point being made, or to showcase some of the most memorable moments from the film.\n\nFor a re:View of ''[[The Guest (2014 American film)|The Guest]]'', the screenwriter of the film, [[Simon Barrett (filmmaker)|Simon Barrett]], appeared as a guest and spoke about many behind the scenes aspects of the production. A similar insight into the background of a film the Red Letter Media crew enjoyed was shared in a two-part interview series with ''[[Samurai Cop]]'' lead [[Matt Hannon]], though this occurred prior to the creation of the re:View branding and format. Former child star [[Macaulay Culkin]] made a guest appearance in a 2018 episode reviewing ''[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]]'', and again in 2019, reviewing ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM7_oyCZqj0|title=Hackers - reView|first=|last=RedLetterMedia|date=5 November 2018|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musikexpress.de/macaulay-culkin-ueberraschender-auftritt-bei-youtube-kritikern-1144705/|title=Macaulay Culkin: \u00dcberraschender Auftritt bei YouTube-Kritikern|date=24 October 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==''The Nerd Crew: A Pop Culture Podcast''==\nThe first episode being uploaded to [[YouTube]] on 5 January 2017, ''The Nerd Crew'' parodies [[pop culture]] \"[[fanboyism]]\" and video series such as [[Screen Junkies]], [[Collider (website)|Collider]], and [[John Campea|''The John Campea Show'']], with Stoklasa, Bauman and Evans playing \"[[wikt:man child|manchild]]ren\" demonstrating excessive enthusiasm over ''[[Star Wars]]'', the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] and other content aimed primarily at a juvenile audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2017/05/the-frenzied-fraud-of-forced-fandom/|title=The Frenzied Fraud of Forced Fandom|date=1 May 2017|publisher=}}</ref> [[Product placement]], [[native advertising]] and general subservience to entertainment mega-corporations are all satirized.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musikexpress.de/diese-drei-filmnerds-zerstoeren-rogue-one-und-disney-mit-nur-einem-youtube-video-736791/|title=Diese drei Filmnerds zerst\u00f6ren \"Rogue One\" und Disney mit nur einem YouTube-Video|date=9 January 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinokadr.ru/blog/2017/12/16/5411.shtml|title=5 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438: \"\u0413\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438\u043d\u044b\", \"\u0425\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0447\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0446\u044b\", \"\u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b\" \u0438 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c \u0414\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0438 \u0427\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0438|website=kinokadr.ru}}</ref>\n\n== Commentary tracks ==\nSince 2012, Red Letter Media has produced commentary tracks for various films, releasing them on [[Bandcamp]].<ref name=\"RLMBandcamp\">{{Cite web|url=https://redlettermedia.bandcamp.com/audio|title=Red Letter Media commentary tracks|last=|first=|date=|website=Red Letter Media|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-25}}</ref> These began with three commentary tracks by Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett, but the company has since released tracks by Stoklasa, Bauman, and Evans as themselves.\n\n;Commentary tracks (listed in order of release)<ref name=\"RLMBandcamp\"/>\n{{div col}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett)\n*''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope]]'' (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett)\n*''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'' (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett)\n*''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]''\n*''[[Samurai Cop]]''\n*''[[Ghostbusters II]]''\n*''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]''\n*''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''\n*''[[The Terminator]]''\n*''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''\n*''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''\n*''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]''\n*''[[Return of the Jedi]]''\n*''[[Masters of the Universe (film)|Masters of the Universe]]''\n*''[[Gremlins]]''\n*''[[Rogue One]]''\n*''[[The Room (film)|The Room]]''\n*''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''\n*''[[RoboCop (film)|RoboCop]]''\n*''[[Jingle All the Way]]''\n*''[[Army of Darkness]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n==''Previously Recorded''==\nIn July 2014 Red Letter Media affiliates Rich Evans and Jack Packard began a YouTube Video game review channel under the name ''Previously Recorded'' or ''Pre-Rec''.

The company was formed by Stoklasa in 2004 while living in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], but is based in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] as of 2011. It attracted significant attention in 2009 through Stoklasa's 70-minute video review of the 1999 film ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]''. The review was posted in seven parts on [[YouTube]], and was presented by his character \"Harry S. Plinkett\". While Stoklasa had published other video reviews of several [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' films]] before that, his ''The Phantom Menace'' and subsequent [[Star Wars#Prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequel]] reviews were praised for both content and presentation.\n\nNumerous other series have been produced by RedLetterMedia, including several review-based web series (''Half in the Bag'', ''Best of the Worst'', and ''re:View''), short comedies (''The Nerd Crew'') and [[web series]] (''The Grabowskis''). Low budget features produced by and starring Stoklasa and Red Letter Media affiliates have been largely horror and comedy, such as ''Feeding Frenzy'', ''The Recovered'', ''Oranges: Revenge of the Eggplant'' and ''[[Space Cop]]''. Alongside Stoklasa and Bauman, Red Letter Media also employs Rich Evans as a full-time actor and stagehand for their projects. Stoklasa, Bauman, Evans and friends Jack Packard, Josh Davis and Jessi Nakles appear as cast members for the vast majority of their releases.\n\n==Mr. Plinkett {{anchor|Mr. Plinkett}}==\nStoklasa created his first video review for ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' after watching the film again in 2008. Stoklasa believed his own voice sounded \"too boring\" for the review and adopted the persona of Harry S. Plinkett, a character he had previously used in several short films (originally played by Rich Evans).<ref name=\"popmatters\">{{cite magazine | url = http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/122310-red-letter-medias-fresh-spin-on-the-crazed-youtube-reviewer/ | title = RedLetterMedia's Spin on the Crazed YouTube Reviewer | magazine = [[PopMatters]] | date = March 16, 2010 | accessdate = March 16, 2010 | first = L.B. | last = Jefferies }}</ref> The character first appeared in ''You're Invited!

He demonstrates this by asking his friends to describe characters from the original trilogy and ''Phantom Menace'' without referring to the characters' physical appearances or occupations. Juxtaposed with the colorful personality descriptions they give for the characters [[Han Solo]] and [[C-3PO]], Stoklasa's friends are unable to come up with similarly definite descriptions for the ''Phantom Menace'' characters [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]].<ref name=\"dailybeast\"/><ref name=\"ifc\"/> Stoklasa believes that many of the decisions made by Jinn's character are highly questionable.<ref name=\"cinemablend\"/> He further suggests that the character is entirely unnecessary to the plot and overall story save to have a final climactic lightsaber battle.<ref name=\"popmatters\"/> He notes Lucas' attempt to add more concurrent plot elements in each of the successive ''Star Wars'' films, which he refers to as \"The Ending Multiplication Effect\".<ref name=\"ifc\"/> Stoklasa then illustrates the chaotic and confusing nature of ending the film by pulling together four concurrent plot threads, each with a radically different tone, unclear objectives, and an overall lack of proper character motivation.\n\n===Reception===\nStoklasa's reviews have been considered part of an emerging art form that hybridize [[mashup (video)|mashup]] with video essays, as they use a combination of footage from the movie in question and other related sources.\n\nLiterary and cultural critic Benjamin Kirbach argues that Plinkett enacts a kind of ''[[d\u00e9tournement]]'' by recontextualizing images that would otherwise serve as ''Star Wars'' marketing material (such as behind-the-scenes footage and interviews). Defined by [[Guy Debord]] as \"the reuse of preexisting artistic elements in a new ensemble\", ''d\u00e9tournement'' is a way of generating meaning out of cultural texts that is antithetical to their original intent.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 109|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref> Kirbach argues that Stoklasa uses this tactic to construct a subversive narrative that frames George Lucas as \"a lazy, out-of-touch, and thoroughly unchallenged filmmaker\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 108|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nKirbach also argues that Plinkett's popularity can be explained, in part, as a form of [[catharsis]]. Because he is portrayed as insane, the Plinkett shtick \"legitimates our nerd-rage by literalizing it\".<ref name=\"Kirbach 2014 112\">{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 112|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref> Plinkett enrolls George Lucas in an ongoing [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] drama as the castrating father figure, a father figure we are invited to rage against owing to his flagrant ineptitude. But aside from raw catharsis, Kirbach claims that Plinkett's insanity is also a critique of the film industry itself. By fictionalizing his critic, Stoklasa constructs a character who is unable to speak at a safe distance from the text he analyzes. \"Plinkett becomes the figure of a consumer culture that has been force-fed Hollywood schlock beyond its carrying capacity,\" Kirbach writes.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 111|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref> And further:\n\n{{quote|Stoklasa's major conceit\u2014that someone would have to be \"crazy\" to watch movies the way Plinkett does\u2014also implies a barely hidden inverse: that the film industry has induced a consumerist fantasy in people who ''don't'' watch movies this way. Plinkett's obscenity and jokiness are without a doubt designed to garner viewership, but they are also Stoklasa's apology for\u2014or defense against\u2014a culture that already construes his level of passion as pathological. This central irony leads us to question what is actually more insane: the consumer who rejects the expressions of a massive culture industry, or the massive culture industry itself. Plinkett satirizes the kind of consumer such a system generates: psychotic, sexist, homicidal.<ref name=\"Kirbach 2014 112\"/>}}\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', comedian [[Patton Oswalt]] noted that the Mr. Plinkett reviews are an example of \"amazing film scholarship\" on the ''Star Wars'' prequels that demonstrate how much of the ''Star Wars'' universe is squandered by them.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/patton-oswalt-silver-screen-fiend-interview | title = Patton Oswalt on Movie Addiction, Star Wars, and the One Film He'd Watch on Loop | first = Jennifer | last = Wood | date = January 27, 2015 | accessdate = January 27, 2015 | work = [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] }}</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called the reviews \"legendary\" and described them as being more popular than the actual films.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/star-wars-the-force-awakens/george-lucas-movies-hate-defence/ |title=Why it's time to stop hating George Lucas |work= The Daily Telegraph |first=Chris|last=Bell|date=December 16, 2015 |accessdate= December 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the reviews have also been criticized by ''Star Wars'' fans.

Among the low-budget features Stoklasa and Bauman have produced and directed on Red Letter Media are the action-comedy film ''[[Oranges: Revenge of the Eggplant]]'', made in 2005 and available on [[Netflix]]<ref name=\"heeb\" /> (currently only available for DVD rental, not for streaming); ''The Recovered'', a horror thriller starring [[Tina Krause]]; and ''Feeding Frenzy'', a 2010 [[genre]]-[[parody|spoof]] of puppet monster movies like ''[[Gremlins]]''. ''Feeding Frenzy'' featured Rich Evans as Mr. Plinkett; Evans originated the character in short films, and this feature was filmed before the popularity of the ''Phantom Menace'' review.<ref name = \"gp-interview\"/> Stoklasa's short films are usually dark comedies. Plinkett, played by Evans, appeared in several of them, starting with \"You're Invited\".\n\nStoklasa created and starred in five seasons of the web sitcom ''The Grabowskis'', opposite Dixie Jacobs, about an exaggeratedly trashy and unpleasant sitcom family. Installments of the series were only a few seconds long at first (comically giving more screen time to the lengthy intro than the episode itself), but grew to full episode length over time.\n\nOn October 26, 2015, the company announced via a short video that it had completed the feature-length film ''[[Space Cop]]'', which had been in production for at least seven years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://redlettermedia.com/shorts/space-cop-trailer/|title=Space Cop Trailer #1 - Red Letter Media|website=redlettermedia.com}}</ref> ''Space Cop'' stars Evans in the titular role alongside Stoklasa, who wrote and directed the film. It was made available on January 12, 2016, on Blu-ray for $25 through Red Letter Media's [[Bandcamp]] page. The first run sold out in a matter of hours.\n\n==''Half in the Bag''==\n''Half in the Bag'' is a regularly released series in which Stoklasa and Bauman review films in a more traditional format, albeit with a haphazard and [[Fourth wall|fourth wall breaking]] overarching plot. Stoklasa has described it as a cross between ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel and Ebert]]'' and a 1980s [[sitcom]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}, with himself and Bauman playing [[videocassette recorder|VCR]] repairmen who discuss movies whilst finding increasingly convoluted ways of avoiding their scheduled repair work on Mr. Plinkett's VCR.\n\nThe show often features Plinkett portrayed by Evans. Fans often call this iteration of the character \"Fake Plinkett\", but Stoklasa has noted that Evans was the first person to portray Plinkett, with Stoklasa's later portrayal based on Evans's performance. [[Tim Heidecker]], who hosts a satirical movie review show ''[[On Cinema]]'', makes a cameo in episode 37 as the owner of the VCR repair shop who bequeaths employment to Jay and Mike.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1C7UCMmF5g |title=Half in the Bag: Episode 37 - Special guest star Tim Heidecker |last=RedLetterMedia |date=2012-08-07 |access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref>\n\nStoklasa stated that this series would not replace the Plinkett reviews. The first episode premiered on March 12, 2011, with a review of ''[[Drive Angry]]'' and ''[[The Adjustment Bureau]]''.\n\n[[Graham Linehan]] praised Red Letter Media in an interview with [[United Kingdom|British]] comedian and writer [[Richard Herring]] on ''[[Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast]]''. He spoke particularly about the ''Half in the Bag'' review of ''[[Jack and Jill (2011 film)|Jack and Jill]]'', which he described as \"brilliant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzsR1e5NFl4&t=48m20s|title=Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast - with Graham Linehan #111|first=|last=Richard Herring|date=26 August 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==''Best of the Worst''==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2019}}\n{{overly detailed|date=August 2019}}\n}}\n\n''Best of the Worst'' is a regularly-released series in which members of Red Letter Media watch and review multiple films ranging from B-movies to instructional videos, sometimes sent in by fans.<ref name=MakeUseOf>{{cite web |url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/red-letter-media-cinema-themed-comedy-for-film-fans-stuff-to-watch/ |title=Red Letter Media: Cinema-Themed Comedy For Film Fans [Stuff to Watch] |publisher=[[MakeUseOf]] |author=Tim Brookes |date=December 10, 2013 |accessdate=January 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117003120/http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/red-letter-media-cinema-themed-comedy-for-film-fans-stuff-to-watch/ |archivedate=January 17, 2014 |df= }}</ref> After viewing and riffing on the films, a rotating panel of four sit to discuss what they just watched, typically expressing further contempt or ridicule for what they have just seen, though occasionally offering praise for films that show uncommon quality or effort. Panels typically consist of any combination of Mike Stoklasa, Jay Bauman, Rich Evans, Jessi Nakles, Jack Packard, Josh \"The Wizard\" Davis, or special guests. Panel participants then individually decide upon which film or video represents the \"Best of the Worst\". Viewing material that is deemed to be insulting, offensive, or especially poor is often destroyed in a creative fashion. Methods of destruction have included dissolving a VHS tape in [[acetone]], forcing a DVD through a [[paper shredder]], dragging a tape around the streets tied to the bumper of a car, and cooking a tape on a charcoal grill alongside cheeseburgers.\n\nCanadian visual effects artists Colin Cunningham and Jim Maxwell, who have worked on numerous television series' and feature films, frequently appear as recurring guests. Special guests on the show have included screenwriters [[Max Landis]] and [[Simon Barrett (filmmaker)|Simon Barrett]], comic book artist [[Freddie Williams II|Freddie Williams]], actors [[Macaulay Culkin]] and [[Patton Oswalt]], comedian Gillian Bellinger and indie film auteur Len Kabasinski.\n\nSome episodes feature the \"Wheel of the Worst\", in which a wheel is spun to select which films/videos will be watched.<ref name=\"MakeUseOf\"/> Wheel selections are often videos that are either extremely bizarre (such as \"Dog Sitter\", a movie made to appeal to dogs), low budget instructional films, educational films and those which have little modern relevance (such as Chinese-language instructional tapes about how to use [[AOL]]). Videos featured on Wheel of the Worst are most frequently found on VHS tapes. The ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]'' praised ''Best of the Worst'' for being Red Letter Media's most entertaining series.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140117/entlife/701179987/|title= Hibernating? Chill out with offbeat shows, DVDs |newspaper=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]] |author=Sean Stangland |date=January 17, 2014 |accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe show occasionally features other gimmicks to randomly select viewing material such as the \"Choose-And-Lose\" and the [[Plinko|Plinketto Board]]. Another subsection of Best of the Worst includes the \"Black Spine Edition\" where the group randomly selects VHS tapes which are missing informational or identification labels on the side of the cassette.\n\nSometimes the crew will review a specific film which they have previously viewed off camera and recommend to fans of poorly-conceived and poorly-executed [[B movie]]s. They refer to reviews of this nature as their \"Spotlight Series\". The first of these reviews featured the film ''Hollywood Cop'' by director [[Amir Shervan]] was released on YouTube on June 21, 2017. In this format, low budget indie movies ''Suburban Sasquatch'', ''Lycan Colony'' and ''The Last Vampire on Earth'' have also been featured.\n\nIn 2019, the crew introduced a 'Hall of Fame' for Best of the Worst, intended to represent the best things that have appeared on the show. There have only been three additions to the hall of fame thus far; actor [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] and low-budget films ''Surviving Edged Weapons'' and ''[[Creating Rem Lezar]]''.\n\n==''re:View''==\nOn May 24, 2016, the company released the first episode of a new series called ''re:View''. Compared to the company's other shows, the format is a much more stripped down and straight forward approach to film critique. Two members of Red Letter Media sit in front of a red curtain and offer thoughts and insight on a film that they both enjoy. Films chosen for this feature are often either [[Cult Film|cult classics]] such as ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'' and ''[[Martin (1978 film)|Martin]]'', or well renowned genre-defining films like ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' and ''[[Ghostbusters]]''. Clips of the film being discussed are interwoven, typically to lend emphasis to a specific point being made, or to showcase some of the most memorable moments from the film.\n\nFor a re:View of ''[[The Guest (film)|The Guest]]'', the screenwriter of the film, [[Simon Barrett (filmmaker)|Simon Barrett]], appeared as a guest and spoke about many behind the scenes aspects of the production. A similar insight into the background of a film the Red Letter Media crew enjoyed was shared in a two-part interview series with ''[[Samurai Cop]]'' lead [[Matt Hannon]], though this occurred prior to the creation of the re:View branding and format. Former child star [[Macaulay Culkin]] made a guest appearance in a 2018 episode reviewing ''[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]]'', and again in 2019, reviewing ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM7_oyCZqj0|title=Hackers - reView|first=|last=RedLetterMedia|date=5 November 2018|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musikexpress.de/macaulay-culkin-ueberraschender-auftritt-bei-youtube-kritikern-1144705/|title=Macaulay Culkin: \u00dcberraschender Auftritt bei YouTube-Kritikern|date=24 October 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==''The Nerd Crew: A Pop Culture Podcast''==\nThe first episode being uploaded to [[YouTube]] on 5 January 2017, ''The Nerd Crew'' parodies [[pop culture]] \"[[fanboyism]]\" and video series such as [[Screen Junkies]], [[Collider (website)|Collider]], and [[John Campea|''The John Campea Show'']], with Stoklasa, Bauman and Evans playing \"[[wikt:man child|manchild]]ren\" demonstrating excessive enthusiasm over ''[[Star Wars]]'', the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] and other content aimed primarily at a juvenile audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2017/05/the-frenzied-fraud-of-forced-fandom/|title=The Frenzied Fraud of Forced Fandom|date=1 May 2017|publisher=}}</ref> [[Product placement]], [[native advertising]] and general subservience to entertainment mega-corporations are all satirized.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musikexpress.de/diese-drei-filmnerds-zerstoeren-rogue-one-und-disney-mit-nur-einem-youtube-video-736791/|title=Diese drei Filmnerds zerst\u00f6ren \"Rogue One\" und Disney mit nur einem YouTube-Video|date=9 January 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinokadr.ru/blog/2017/12/16/5411.shtml|title=5 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438: \"\u0413\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438\u043d\u044b\", \"\u0425\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0447\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0446\u044b\", \"\u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b\" \u0438 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c \u0414\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0438 \u0427\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0438|website=kinokadr.ru}}</ref>\n\n== Commentary tracks ==\nSince 2012, Red Letter Media has produced commentary tracks for various films, releasing them on [[Bandcamp]].<ref name=\"RLMBandcamp\">{{Cite web|url=https://redlettermedia.bandcamp.com/audio|title=Red Letter Media commentary tracks|last=|first=|date=|website=Red Letter Media|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-25}}</ref> These began with three commentary tracks by Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett, but the company has since released tracks by Stoklasa, Bauman, and Evans as themselves.\n\n;Commentary tracks (listed in order of release)<ref name=\"RLMBandcamp\"/>\n{{div col}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett)\n*''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope]]'' (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett)\n*''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'' (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett)\n*''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]''\n*''[[Samurai Cop]]''\n*''[[Ghostbusters II]]''\n*''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]''\n*''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''\n*''[[The Terminator]]''\n*''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''\n*''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''\n*''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]''\n*''[[Return of the Jedi]]''\n*''[[Masters of the Universe (film)|Masters of the Universe]]''\n*''[[Gremlins]]''\n*''[[Rogue One]]''\n*''[[The Room (film)|The Room]]''\n*''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''\n*''[[RoboCop (film)|RoboCop]]''\n*''[[Jingle All the Way]]''\n*''[[Army of Darkness]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n==''Previously Recorded''==\nIn July 2014 Red Letter Media affiliates Rich Evans and Jack Packard began a YouTube Video game review channel under the name ''Previously Recorded'' or ''Pre-Rec''.

When the compound went up in flames, McVeigh and Nichols were enraged and began to plot revenge on the federal government.<ref name=account/> In the fall of 1993, Nichols and McVeigh, who were living at the farm,<ref name=nytimes_second/> became business partners, selling weapons and military surplus at gun shows.<ref name=fox2/> For a while, they lived an itinerant life, following the gun shows from town to town.<ref name=llcur29/>\n\nNichols then went to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to try working in construction but failed.

Fortier had entered into a federal plea agreement for reduced charges in return for his agreement to testify. He was charged with failing to notify authorities in advance of the crime and sentenced to 12 years in prison.<ref name=fortier/> Fortier testified that Nichols and McVeigh had expressed anti-government feelings and conspired to blow up the Murrah federal building. He said he helped McVeigh survey the building before the attack. He also testified that Nichols had robbed an Arkansas gun dealer to finance the cost of the bombing. Fortier provided \"solid bricks of evidence\" for the cases against McVeigh and Nichols, according to the prosecutor.<ref name=fortier/>\n\nNichols' wife Marife testified as a defense witness, but her story may have helped the prosecution's case.<ref name=wapo_wife/> She said her husband had been living a double life prior to the bombing, using aliases, renting storage lockers and lying that he had broken off his relationship with McVeigh. She also testified that Nichols traveled to Oklahoma City three days before the bombing, supporting the prosecution's contention that Nichols helped McVeigh station a getaway car near the Murrah building. Marife also failed to give Nichols an alibi for April 18, 1995, the day the prosecution said Nichols helped McVeigh assemble the truck bomb.<ref name=wapo_wife/>\n\nNichols was represented by criminal defense attorney [[Michael Tigar]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Toobin|first1=Jeffery|title=THE MAN WITH TIMOTHY MCVEIGH|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1996/09/30/the-man-with-timothy-mcveigh|accessdate=September 4, 2015|publisher=The New Yorker|date=September 30, 1996}}</ref> The trial lasted nine weeks with the prosecution calling 100 witnesses tying Nichols to McVeigh and the bombing plot. The prosecution argued that Nichols helped McVeigh purchase and steal bomb ingredients, park the getaway car near the Murrah building and assemble the bomb. The defense attempted to cast doubt on the case against Nichols by calling witnesses who said they saw other men with McVeigh before the bombing and by claiming the government had manipulated the evidence against Nichols.<ref name=wapo_01-08-98/>\n\nThe jury deliberated for 41 hours over a period of six days, acquitting Nichols on December 24, 1997, of actually detonating the bomb, but convicting him of conspiring with McVeigh to use a weapon of mass destruction, a [[capital punishment|capital offense]].<ref name=\"Romano\">{{cite news|last1=Romano|first1=Lois|last2=Kenworthy|first2=Tom|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/oklahoma/stories/nichols1224.htm|title=Nichols Guilty of Conspiracy, Manslaughter|work=The Washington Post|date=December 24, 1997|accessdate=September 21, 2017|page=A01}}</ref> They acquitted Nichols on the charges of first degree (premeditated) murder, but convicted him on the lesser charge of involuntary (unintentional) manslaughter in the deaths of the federal law enforcement officers.<ref name=\"Romano\"/>\n\nIn assessing why Nichols was not convicted of first degree murder, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' noted: {{quote|text=\"There was no evidence that Nichols had rented the [[Ryder]] truck used to carry the bomb to Oklahoma City, and there was no one who could positively identify him as the purchaser of the two tons of ammonium nitrate, the major component in the bomb.

State representative Charles Key led a citizens group that circulated the petitions. It was hoped that evidence implicating other conspirators would be uncovered. A grand jury heard testimony for 18 months about allegations of other accomplices<ref name=author_arrested/> but returned only the indictments against Nichols in March 1999. Oklahoma County District Attorney Wes Lane denied the state prosecution was conducted solely for the purpose of having Nichols executed, saying it was important Nichols be convicted of killing all the victims. \"This case has always been about 161 men, women and children and an unborn baby having the same rights to their day in court as eight federal law enforcement officers,\" Lane said.<ref name=deadlocked/>\n\nNichols was brought from the prison in Colorado to Oklahoma in January 2000 to face the state trial on 160 capital counts of first-degree murder and one count each of fetal homicide, first-degree arson, and conspiracy.<ref name=msnbc1/> The prosecutor's goal was to get the death penalty.<ref name=msnbc1/><ref name=cnn1/>\n\nDuring the two-month trial, the prosecution presented a \"mountain of [[circumstantial evidence]]\", calling 151 witnesses.<ref name=msnbc1/> Their star witness was Fortier, who said Nichols was intimately involved in the conspiracy and had helped obtain bomb ingredients including fertilizer that was mixed with high octane fuel.<ref name=msnbc1/> Fortier also testified that McVeigh and Nichols stole cord and blasting caps from a rock quarry, and that Nichols robbed a gun collector to obtain money for the plot.<ref name=msnbc1/> Nichols' lawyers said he was the \"fall guy\" and that others had conspired with McVeigh. They wanted to introduce evidence that a group of [[white supremacists]] had been McVeigh's accomplices. However, the judge did not allow them to do so, saying that the defense had not shown that any of these people committed acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. In their concluding argument, the defense said, \"People who are still unknown assisted Timothy McVeigh.\"<ref name=msnbc1/> On May 26, 2004, the six-man, six-woman jury took five hours to reach guilty verdicts on all charges.<ref name=msnbc1/> When the verdict was read, Nichols showed no emotion, staring straight ahead.<ref name=msnbc1/>\n\nThe penalty phase of the trial started on June 1, 2004.

Nichols also apologized for the murders and offered to write to survivors to \"assist in their healing process\".<ref name=trutv2/> Judge Taylor called Nichols a terrorist and said \"No American citizen has ever brought this kind of devastation; you are in U.S. history the No. 1 mass murderer in all of U.S. history\" and sentenced Nichols to 161 consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole.<ref name=msnbc2/> Nichols was returned to the federal prison in Colorado.\n\nDarlene Welch, whose niece was killed in the explosion, said she \"didn't appreciate being preached to\" by Nichols and that she regretted that \"he won't stand before God sooner.\"<ref name=trutv2/>\n\n==Post-conviction==\n\n===Additional explosives===\nActing on a tip from reputed mobster Greg Scarpa, Jr. (son of mobster [[Greg Scarpa]], Sr.), a fellow inmate of Nichols,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.intelwire.com/2011/02/new-okbomb-documents-show-threats-to.html|title=New OKBOMB Documents Show Threats To Nichols' Family After FBI Reopened Investigation in 2005|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=tip/> the FBI searched the [[Basement#Crawl space|crawl space]] of Nichols's former home in Kansas, 10 years after the bombing.

Nichols' mother claimed that her son had [[Asperger syndrome]], was manipulated by McVeigh and didn't know what the bomb was for.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8456268/ns/us_news-security/t/nichols-reveals-role-bombing-mom-says/#.U51Kct_n_IU|title=Mom: Nichols reveals role in bombing - US news - Security - NBC News|work=msnbc.com}}</ref> In a May 2005 letter that he wrote to a relative of two of the victims, Nichols claimed that an Arkansas gun dealer also conspired in the 1995 bombing plot by donating some of the explosives that were used.<ref name=gundealer/> In a 2006 letter requesting that a judge give his son a light sentence for assault with a deadly weapon, battery of a police officer, and possession of a stolen vehicle, Nichols admitted his participation in the Oklahoma City bombing but said that McVeigh had forced and intimidated him into cooperating.<ref name=bombers_letter/>\n\nIn a 2007 [[affidavit]],<ref>The 2007 statement by Nichols was filed in a wrongful death suit by the brother of a man who died in 1995 while in federal custody. The suit alleged that [[Kenneth Trentadue]] was killed while being interrogated by FBI agents in connection with the Oklahoma City bombing, although his death had officially been ruled a suicide. Jesse Trentadue, the plaintiff, wanted to conduct a videotaped deposition of Nichols and one other prisoner to support his contentions that the FBI had killed his brother and was withholding documents related to his brother's death. He was ultimately unable to obtain a court order allowing this.</ref> Nichols claimed that in 1992 McVeigh claimed to have been recruited for undercover missions while serving in the military.<ref name=clay/> Nichols also said that in 1995 McVeigh told him that FBI official Larry Potts, who had supervised the [[Ruby Ridge]] and [[Waco Siege|Waco]] operations, had directed McVeigh to blow up a government building.<ref name=clay/> Nichols claimed that he and McVeigh had learned how to make the bomb from individuals they met while attending gun shows.<ref name=clay/> In the same affidavit, Nichols admitted that he and McVeigh stole eight cases of the gel type explosive [[Tovex]] from a [[Marion, Kansas]] quarry, some of which was later used in the Oklahoma City truck bomb.<ref name=clay/> He admitted that he had helped McVeigh mix the bomb ingredients in the truck the day before the attack, but he denied that he knew the exact target of the bomb.<ref name=clay/> Nichols wanted to testify in more detail in a videotaped deposition,<ref name=ksl/><ref name=intelwire/>  but a federal appeals court ruled against it in 2009.<ref

Due to a conflict over childcare,<ref name=bio/> he requested and was given a hardship discharge in May 1989 to return home to take care of his son, who was seven years old at the time.<ref name=nytimes_second/> As he departed, he told a fellow soldier that he would be starting his own military organization soon, and would have an unlimited supply of weapons.<ref name=Stickney101/>\n\nIn 1990, Nichols married a 17-year-old girl, Marife Torres, from the [[Philippines]] whom he met through a [[mail-order bride]] agency.<ref name=fox2/><ref name=bio/> When she arrived in Michigan several months later, she was pregnant with another man's child.<ref name=fox2/><ref name=nytimes_second/> The child died at age two when he suffocated in a plastic bag<ref name=dbio1/> while Nichols was babysitting him.

He sometimes traveled to the Philippines alone, while she remained in Kansas.\n\nNichols left a cryptic note and a package of documents with his ex-wife, Lana (Walsh) Padilla, prior to one of his many visits to the Philippines. Upon returning from the visit to learn that she had prematurely opened a letter instructing her what to do in the event of his death, he made a series of telephone calls to a Cebu City boarding house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/oklahoma/stories/nichols1120.htm|title=WashingtonPost.com: Oklahoma City Bombing Trial Report|website=www.washingtonpost.com|accessdate=May 27, 2018}}</ref> \nNichols and Torres divorced after his arrest. Marife returned to the Philippines with the children.<ref name=dp_wife/>\n\n==Anti-government views==\nNichols' anti-government views developed and grew over the years.<ref name=bio/> Nichols spent most of his adult life in the [[Lapeer County, Michigan|Lapeer]] and [[Sanilac County, Michigan|Sanilac County]] areas of Michigan where mistrust and resentment of the federal government was common, especially after bank repossessions of many farms in the 1980s.<ref>Stickney, p. 91.</ref> Neighbors said he attended meetings of anti-government groups, experimented with explosives and got more radical as time went on.<ref name=dbio1/> In February 1992, he attempted to [[Renunciation of United States citizenship|renounce his US citizenship]] by writing to the local county clerk in Michigan, stating that the political system was corrupt, and declaring himself a \"non resident alien\".<ref name=fox2/><ref name=nytimes_second/> Several months later, he appeared in court and tried to avoid responsibility for some of his credit card bills (he owed approximately $40,000 altogether), refusing to come before the bench, and shouting at the judge that the government had no jurisdiction over him.<ref name=nytimes_second/><ref name=llcur29/> On October 19, 1992, he signed another document renouncing his US citizenship.<ref name=dbio1/> In May 1993, Nichols appeared before a county judge regarding an $8,421 unpaid credit card debt.<ref name=dbio1/> He also renounced his [[driver\u2019s license]].<ref name=llcur29/>\n\nMcVeigh and Nichols grew closer after McVeigh's discharge from the Army.<ref name=fox2/> In December 1991, Nichols invited McVeigh to join him in Michigan and help him out selling military surplus at [[gun show]]s.<ref>Stickney, p. 129.</ref> For the next three years, McVeigh stayed with Nichols off and on.<ref>Stickney, p. 144.</ref> On April 19, 1993, Nichols was watching TV with McVeigh at the Nichols' farmhouse in Michigan when the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]], Army and FBI [[Waco siege|attacked the Branch Davidian compound]] in [[Waco, Texas]]. When the compound went up in flames, McVeigh and Nichols were enraged and began to plot revenge on the federal government.<ref name=account/> In the fall of 1993, Nichols and McVeigh, who were living at the farm,<ref name=nytimes_second/> became business partners, selling weapons and military surplus at gun shows.<ref name=fox2/> For a while, they lived an itinerant life, following the gun shows from town to town.<ref name=llcur29/>\n\nNichols then went to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to try working in construction but failed. Next, he went to central Kansas and was hired in March 1994 as a ranch hand in [[Marion, Kansas]].<ref name=dbio1/> In March 1994, he sent a letter to the clerk of [[Marion County, Kansas]], saying he was not subject to the laws of the U.S. government and asked his employer not to [[Withholding tax|withhold]] any federal taxes from his check.<ref name=llcur29/> His employer said Nichols was hard-working but had unusual political views.<ref name=nytimes_second/> In the fall of 1994, Nichols quit his job, telling his employer he was going into business with McVeigh.<ref name=nytimes_second/>\n\n==The bombing==\n{{Main|Oklahoma City bombing}}\n[[File:Oklahomacitybombing-DF-ST-96-00587.jpg|thumb|230px|The bombing site on April 21, 1995]]\nOn September 22, 1994, Terry Nichols and McVeigh rented a storage shed and began gathering supplies for the truck bomb.<ref name=llcur29/><ref name=account/> In late September or early October, Nichols and McVeigh stole [[dynamite]] and [[blasting caps]] from a nearby [[quarry]].<ref name=llcur29/><ref name=account/> Nichols began purchasing large quantities of [[ammonium nitrate]] fertilizer and storing it in three rental storage units.<ref name=account/> Nichols also robbed an [[Arkansas]] gun dealer who had befriended him and McVeigh at various gun shows.<ref name=account/>\n\nIn February 1995 Nichols bought a small house in [[Herington, Kansas]], with a cash down payment. In March 1995, he bought diesel fuel. On April 14, Nichols gave McVeigh some cash, according to McVeigh.<ref name=account/> On April 16, [[Easter|Easter Sunday]], Nichols and McVeigh drove to Oklahoma City to drop off the getaway car.<ref name=account/> On April 18, the day before the bombing, Nichols helped McVeigh prepare the truck bomb at a lake near Herington.<ref name=nytimes_second/> McVeigh remarked about Nichols's and Fortier's partial withdrawal from the plot, saying they \"were men who liked to talk tough, but in the end their bitches and kids ruled.\"<ref name=account/> Nichols was at home in Kansas with his family when the bomb went off.<ref name=fox2/>\n\nOn April 21, Nichols learned he was wanted for questioning, turned himself in,<ref name=fox2/> and consented to a search of his home.<ref name=nytimes_second/> The search turned up blasting caps, detonating cords, ground ammonium nitrate, barrels made of plastic similar to fragments found at the bombing site, 33 firearms, anti-government warfare literature,<ref name=nytimes_second/> a receipt for ammonium nitrate fertilizer with McVeigh's fingerprints on it,<ref name=llcur29/> a telephone credit card that McVeigh had used when he was shopping for bomb-making equipment, and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City.<ref name=account/> Nichols was held as a [[material witness]] to the bombing until he was charged on May 10.<ref name=nytimes_second/>\n\nInvestigators also combed the [[Decker, Michigan]], farm of James Nichols where Terry Nichols and McVeigh had stayed intermittently in the months preceding the bombing. James was held in custody on charges that he made small bombs on the farm but was released without charges on May 24, with the judge saying there was no evidence he was a danger to others.<ref>Stickney, p. 234.</ref>\n\n==Prosecutions==\n\n=== Federal case ===\n[[File:Florence ADMAX.jpg|thumb|[[Florence ADMAX USP]], the supermax security prison where Nichols resides.]]\nMcVeigh was tried before Nichols and sentenced to death.<ref name=bio/> Former army buddy Michael Fortier testified against both McVeigh and Nichols. Fortier had entered into a federal plea agreement for reduced charges in return for his agreement to testify. He was charged with failing to notify authorities in advance of the crime and sentenced to 12 years in prison.<ref name=fortier/> Fortier testified that Nichols and McVeigh had expressed anti-government feelings and conspired to blow up the Murrah federal building. He said he helped McVeigh survey the building before the attack. He also testified that Nichols had robbed an Arkansas gun dealer to finance the cost of the bombing. Fortier provided \"solid bricks of evidence\" for the cases against McVeigh and Nichols, according to the prosecutor.<ref name=fortier/>\n\nNichols' wife Marife testified as a defense witness, but her story may have helped the prosecution's case.<ref name=wapo_wife/> She said her husband had been living a double life prior to the bombing, using aliases, renting storage lockers and lying that he had broken off his relationship with McVeigh. She also testified that Nichols traveled to Oklahoma City three days before the bombing, supporting the prosecution's contention that Nichols helped McVeigh station a getaway car near the Murrah building. Marife also failed to give Nichols an alibi for April 18, 1995, the day the prosecution said Nichols helped McVeigh assemble the truck bomb.<ref name=wapo_wife/>\n\nNichols was represented by criminal defense attorney [[Michael Tigar]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Toobin|first1=Jeffery|title=THE MAN WITH TIMOTHY MCVEIGH|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1996/09/30/the-man-with-timothy-mcveigh|accessdate=September 4, 2015|publisher=The New Yorker|date=September 30, 1996}}</ref> The trial lasted nine weeks with the prosecution calling 100 witnesses tying Nichols to McVeigh and the bombing plot. The prosecution argued that Nichols helped McVeigh purchase and steal bomb ingredients, park the getaway car near the Murrah building and assemble the bomb. The defense attempted to cast doubt on the case against Nichols by calling witnesses who said they saw other men with McVeigh before the bombing and by claiming the government had manipulated the evidence against Nichols.<ref name=wapo_01-08-98/>\n\nThe jury deliberated for 41 hours over a period of six days, acquitting Nichols on December 24, 1997, of actually detonating the bomb, but convicting him of conspiring with McVeigh to use a weapon of mass destruction, a [[capital punishment|capital offense]].<ref name=\"Romano\">{{cite news|last1=Romano|first1=Lois|last2=Kenworthy|first2=Tom|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/oklahoma/stories/nichols1224.htm|title=Nichols Guilty of Conspiracy, Manslaughter|work=The Washington Post|date=December 24, 1997|accessdate=September 21, 2017|page=A01}}</ref> They acquitted Nichols on the charges of first degree (premeditated) murder, but convicted him on the lesser charge of involuntary (unintentional) manslaughter in the deaths of the federal law enforcement officers.<ref name=\"Romano\"/>\n\nIn assessing why Nichols was not convicted of first degree murder, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' noted: {{quote|text=\"There was no evidence that Nichols had rented the [[Ryder]] truck used to carry the bomb to Oklahoma City, and there was no one who could positively identify him as the purchaser of the two tons of ammonium nitrate, the major component in the bomb.

State representative Charles Key led a citizens group that circulated the petitions. It was hoped that evidence implicating other conspirators would be uncovered. A grand jury heard testimony for 18 months about allegations of other accomplices<ref name=author_arrested/> but returned only the indictments against Nichols in March 1999. Oklahoma County District Attorney Wes Lane denied the state prosecution was conducted solely for the purpose of having Nichols executed, saying it was important Nichols be convicted of killing all the victims. \"This case has always been about 161 men, women and children and an unborn baby having the same rights to their day in court as eight federal law enforcement officers,\" Lane said.<ref name=deadlocked/>\n\nNichols was brought from the prison in Colorado to Oklahoma in January 2000 to face the state trial on 160 capital counts of first-degree murder and one count each of fetal homicide, first-degree arson, and conspiracy.<ref name=msnbc1/> The prosecutor's goal was to get the death penalty.<ref name=msnbc1/><ref name=cnn1/>\n\nDuring the two-month trial, the prosecution presented a \"mountain of [[circumstantial evidence]]\", calling 151 witnesses.<ref name=msnbc1/> Their star witness was Fortier, who said Nichols was intimately involved in the conspiracy and had helped obtain bomb ingredients including fertilizer that was mixed with high octane fuel.<ref name=msnbc1/> Fortier also testified that McVeigh and Nichols stole cord and blasting caps from a rock quarry, and that Nichols robbed a gun collector to obtain money for the plot.<ref name=msnbc1/> Nichols' lawyers said he was the \"fall guy\" and that others had conspired with McVeigh. They wanted to introduce evidence that a group of [[white supremacists]] had been McVeigh's accomplices. However, the judge did not allow them to do so, saying that the defense had not shown that any of these people committed acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. In their concluding argument, the defense said, \"People who are still unknown assisted Timothy McVeigh.\"<ref name=msnbc1/> On May 26, 2004, the six-man, six-woman jury took five hours to reach guilty verdicts on all charges.<ref name=msnbc1/> When the verdict was read, Nichols showed no emotion, staring straight ahead.<ref name=msnbc1/>\n\nThe penalty phase of the trial started on June 1, 2004.

Nichols also apologized for the murders and offered to write to survivors to \"assist in their healing process\".<ref name=trutv2/> Judge Taylor called Nichols a terrorist and said \"No American citizen has ever brought this kind of devastation; you are in U.S. history the No. 1 mass murderer in all of U.S. history\" and sentenced Nichols to 161 consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole.<ref name=msnbc2/> Nichols was returned to the federal prison in Colorado.\n\nDarlene Welch, whose niece was killed in the explosion, said she \"didn't appreciate being preached to\" by Nichols and that she regretted that \"he won't stand before God sooner.\"<ref name=trutv2/>\n\n==Post-conviction==\n\n===Additional explosives===\nActing on a tip from reputed mobster Greg Scarpa, Jr. (son of mobster [[Greg Scarpa]], Sr.), a fellow inmate of Nichols,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.intelwire.com/2011/02/new-okbomb-documents-show-threats-to.html|title=New OKBOMB Documents Show Threats To Nichols' Family After FBI Reopened Investigation in 2005|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=tip/> the FBI searched the [[Basement#Crawl space|crawl space]] of Nichols's former home in Kansas, 10 years after the bombing.

Usually, students in first and second years live in traditional residences, where social life is very active, while students in second and third years tend to live in apartment-style residences where they have the possibility of cooking for themselves. Apartment-style residences consist typically of four bedroom apartments with 2 full bathrooms and a small kitchen. Students who live in traditional residence are registered in a mandatory meal plan at the central dining facility, Morrison Hall. Alternatively, students may enroll in a block plan that provides a specified number of meals. St. Francis Xavier has a contract with [[Sodexo]],  serving food and conference meals at facilities on campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.stfx.ca/admissions/tuition-fees/meal-plans |publisher=St. Francis Xavier University|title=Meal Plan Options and Rates |accessdate=March 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bishops Hall Exterior.jpg|thumb|left|Bishops Hall residence]]\n\nTraditional residences at St. Francis Xavier:\n*Burke, Plessis and Fraser Houses in Bishops' Hall (renovated in 2007)\n*MacPherson, MacDonald, and TNT (Thompson and Tompkins) Houses in Cameron Hall\n*Chillis (Chisholm and Gillis) and MacNeil Houses in MacKinnon Hall\n*Lane Hall\n*Mount Saint Bernard (renovated in 2015)\n*MacIsaac Hall (renovated in 2017)\n*O'Regan Hall (completed in 2013)\n*Riley Hall (completed in 2013)\n[[File:Residence Life.jpg|thumb|right|Snowball fight on University Avenue]]\n\nApartment-style housing at St. Francis Xavier:\n*Somers and Power Halls (completed in 1998-99)\n*Governors Hall (completed in 2006)\n\n==X-Ring==\n\nSt. Francis Xavier University ceremonially awards to students a distinctive X-Ring.

The school is located on [[Louisiana Highway 16]], adjacent to [[Denham Springs Freshman High School|Denham Springs Freshman High]]. The school's location makes it prone to flooding. This was the case when [[2016 Louisiana floods|flooding devastated the area in 2016]], and resulted in students having to travel to nearby [[Live Oak High School (Louisiana)|Live Oak High School]] for classes.\n\nDenham Springs High School is a public high school and has open enrollment.

Extracurricular activities are also offered in the form of performing arts, school publications, and clubs.\n\n==History==\n\nDenham Springs High School was founded in 1897 for the residents of Denham Springs. The school was built to serve the larger city of Denham Springs so that students would not have to travel as far to attend the Live Oak school that was built two years earlier in 1895. \n\nLivingston Parish Public Schools [[Desegregation in the United States|desegregated]] following the 1969 case Dunn v. Livingston Parish Board.<ref>United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit. ''Dunn v. Livingston Parish School Board''. 14 Aug. 1970. ''Open Jurist''.</ref> The effects of desegregation were largely felt by those at the once all-white Denham Springs High School. The West Livingston School, the only school in the Parish to serve African Americans, saw a large percentage of its students attend Denham Springs High School after desegregation. African American students were harassed by their white students while teachers looked on indifferently.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/education/article_f257e7bc-431b-11e8-bb09-7b9463271a7b.html|title=Denham Springs soldier and litigant in Livingston Parish school desegregation case dies|last=Lussier|first=Charles|website=The Advocate|language=en|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref> To make matters worse, West Livingston High School was the heart of the African American community in Denham Springs at the time, and after integration, the school system let the school fall into disrepair.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/communities/livingston_tangipahoa/article_0a354f6e-198c-11e8-840a-ab7726f450b5.html|title=Educators share experiences of segregation, integration of Livingston schools|last=Couvillion|first=Vic|website=The Advocate|language=en|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref>\n\nAs the City of Denham Springs continued to grow in the later half of the 20th century, officials at Denham Springs High School looked for ways to continue housing students.

The school is located on [[Louisiana Highway 16]], adjacent to [[Denham Springs Freshman High School|Denham Springs Freshman High]]. The school's location makes it prone to flooding.

The school was built to serve the larger city of Denham Springs so that students would not have to travel as far to attend the Live Oak school that was built two years earlier in 1895. \n\nLivingston Parish Public Schools [[Desegregation in the United States|desegregated]] following the 1969 case Dunn v. Livingston Parish Board.<ref>United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit. ''Dunn v. Livingston Parish School Board''. 14 Aug. 1970. ''Open Jurist''.</ref> The effects of desegregation were largely felt by those at the once all-white Denham Springs High School. The West Livingston School, the only school in the Parish to serve African Americans, saw a large percentage of its students attend Denham Springs High School after desegregation. African American students were harassed by their white students while teachers looked on indifferently.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/education/article_f257e7bc-431b-11e8-bb09-7b9463271a7b.html|title=Denham Springs soldier and litigant in Livingston Parish school desegregation case dies|last=Lussier|first=Charles|website=The Advocate|language=en|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref> To make matters worse, West Livingston High School was the heart of the African American community in Denham Springs at the time, and after integration, the school system let the school fall into disrepair.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/communities/livingston_tangipahoa/article_0a354f6e-198c-11e8-840a-ab7726f450b5.html|title=Educators share experiences of segregation, integration of Livingston schools|last=Couvillion|first=Vic|website=The Advocate|language=en|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref>\n\nAs the City of Denham Springs continued to grow in the later half of the 20th century, officials at Denham Springs High School looked for ways to continue housing students.
