Asansol is the district headquarters of [[Paschim Bardhaman district]]. According to a 2010 report released by the [[International Institute for Environment and Development]], a UK-based policy research non-governmental body, Asansol was ranked 11th among Indian cities and 42nd in the world in its list of 100 fastest-growing cities.<ref name=\"citymayors1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/urban_growth1.html |title=World's fastest growing urban areas (1) |publisher=City Mayors |date=7 December 2010 |accessdate=16 March 2011}}</ref> Asansol is classed as a [[Classification of Indian cities|Y-category city]] for calculation of HRA (House Rent Allowance) for public servants, making it a Tier-II city.<ref>https://mod.gov.in/dod/sites/default/files/hra.pdf</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\"Asan\", a species of tree which generally grows thirty meters tall, is found on the banks of the Damodar River; \"sol\" refers to land. The name \"Asansol\" is a combination of these two words. Asansol is a city on the banks of Damodar and its land is rich in minerals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flowersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Indian%20Laurel.html|title=Indian Laurel|accessdate=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nHistorically the city was anglicized as '''Assensole''' during the British era but the name was reverted after Independence.<ref>http://dspace.wbpublibnet.gov.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/10689/21975/16/November_Chapter%203_2362-2432p.pdf</ref><ref>http://dspace.gipe.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10973/47105/GIPE-070160.pdf</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe region is believed to have been a part of the kingdom of Vishnupur where the Malla dynasty ruled for approximately a thousand years till the emergence of the British. This theory is backed by the presence of Vishnupur style temple present at Chhotodighari village and Domohani village in Asansol. <ref>http://www.asansolmunicipalcorporation.org/amrut/amrut%20news.pdf</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAsansol is a cosmopolitan city located on the lower [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]], which occupies most of [[Jharkhand]], between the [[Damodar River|Damodar]] and [[Ajay River|Ajay]] rivers. Another river, the [[Barakar River|Barakar]], joins the Damodar near [[Dishergarh]]. Two small rivulets, Nunia and Garui flows past Asansol.\n\nWhile [[Dhanbad district]] in Jharkhand lies on the western side, [[Durgapur subdivision]] lies on the eastern side. To the south, across the Damodar river are the [[Purulia district|Purulia]] and [[Bankura district]]s. To the north are [[Dumka district|Dumka]] and [[Birbhum district]]s. Dhanbad district is a major coal mining area and has close links with Asansol; both lie in the Damodar valley.\n\nThe city is connected by the Grand Trunk Road and by rail with Durgapur, Burdwan, and Kolkata. It is an important coal-trading and railway centre, with large railway workshops and a railway colony.\n\n===Police stations===\nAsansol North police station has jurisdiction over [[Raniganj (community development block)|Raniganj]] CD Block and parts of [[Asansol Municipal Corporation]].

NH 19 has been broadened as part of the [[Golden Quadrilateral]] project and now allows three-lane traffic in both directions. A highway bypass avoids the areas of Ushagram, Murgasol, Asansol Bazar, Chelidanga, BNR, Gopalpur, Neamatpur, Kulti, and Barakar. Some of the other important roads of the city are namely Vivekananda Avenue, Burnpur Road, and S.B Gorai Road.\n\nThe [[South Bengal State Transport Corporation]] operates daily bus services to Kolkata and numerous other destinations, such as Malda, Siliguri, Midnapur, Bankura, Siuri, Purulia, Burdwan, Kalna, Howrah, Barackpore, Digha, [[Bolpur]], [[Kirnahar]] and Berhampore. The [[North Bengal State Transport Corporation]] also runs services to and from the city and towns in North Bengal like Malda, Raiganj and Balurghat. There are also many private buses, Taxis and Radio Taxis, which ply locally and on intercity and interstate routes.\n\n===Railway===\n[[File:Asansol Junction by Atra.jpg|thumb|Asansol Railway Station]]\n[[Asansol Junction railway station]] is the Division of [[Eastern Railway zone]] This is one of the oldest divisions on the Indian Railways and has always been in the forefront of operations, both freight and passenger. As far as Eastern Railway is concerned, Asansol Division is referred to as the heart of operations, being at the crossroads of the Grand Chord route via Gaya and the main line route via Patna. With a total of 629.38 route kilometers, the division has the unique distinction of having quadruple lines (two up and two down line) from Khana to Sitarampur.\n\nThe railway track from Kolkata to Delhi passes through the subdivision and bifurcates into the main line and the grand chord line at [[Sitarampur]] railway junction, a little to the west of Asansol railway junction. Another railway track links Asansol with Adra and then to [[Jamshedpur]] via Purulia and [[Kharagpur]] via Bankura. A branch line connects Andal with Sainthia on the [[Sahibganj Loop]].\n\nAlmost all the trains linking Kolkata with north India also connect with Asansol including Sealdah Rajdhani, Howrah Rajdhani, Howrah Duronto, Sealdah Humsafar Express, Yuva Express and Shalimar Duronto. As a result, Asansol enjoys good connectivity with cities like [[New Delhi]], [[Jammu]], [[Amritsar]], [[Ludhiana]], [[Allahabad]], [[Kanpur]], [[Lucknow]], [[Dehradun]], [[Jaipur]], [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]], [[Jodhpur]], [[Jaisalmer]], [[Gwalior]], [[Bhopal]], [[Indore]], [[Patna]], [[Ranchi]] and [[Dhanbad]] on the one hand and commands a fairly good traffic movement towards the western cities like [[Mumbai]], [[Ahmedabad]] and [[Surat]] and southern cities like [[Bhubaneshwar]], [[Visakhapatnam]], [[Vijaywada]], [[Chennai]], [[Bangalore]] and [[Trivandrum]]. It is also connected with [[Guwahati]] in the north-east region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.makemytrip.com/railways/asansol_jn-asn-railway-station.html/|title=Asansol Jn Train Railway Station|website=Make My Trip|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523124823/http://www.makemytrip.com/railways/asansol_jn-asn-railway-station.html/|archive-date=23 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Air===\nThe domestic airport that serves the city is [[Kazi Nazrul Islam Airport]]. The airport is located in Andal. It is roughly {{convert|25|km|mi}} from the Asansol City Bus Terminus.\n\nThere is also a private airport located at Burnpur Riverside Area. At present this Airport is operated by [[IISCO Steel Plant|IISCO]]. Recently [[Airport Authority of India]] gave nod to start commercial flights for six routes in West Bengal; [[Burnpur Airport]] being one of them is hopeful to receive its first commercial flight by the last quarter of 2019.<ref>http://cadup.gov.in/writereaddata/pdf/RCS_Round_1_and_2.pdf</ref>\n\nThe nearest international airport is [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport]] at [[Dum Dum]] in Kolkata.\n\n==Economy==\n\nThe economy of Asansol is primarily dependent on its steel and coal industries, railways, and its superb trade and commerce.\n\n===Steel===\n[[File:IISCO Panoramic View 1.jpg|thumb|right|IISCO panoramic view, Asansol]]\n[[File:Modernisation of ISP.JPG|thumb|right|Modernised ISP]]\nThe [[Steel Authority of India]] [[IISCO]] (Indian Iron and Steel Company Ltd) steel-making plant at [[Kulti]] was the first such facility in India. It became well known during the 1960s and 1970s, with its company shares being traded on the [[London Stock Exchange]]. However, a decade later the company became loss-making until it was revived in 2006 when it merged with the [[Steel Authority of India]]. Modernisation at [[IISCO Steel Plant]] has helped the city develop at a very rapid pace. The plant's capacity will be raised from 0.4 MT to 2.5 MT of saleable steel, using what will be the biggest [[blast furnace]] in the country.<ref>{{cite web| url =https://www.sail.co.in/sail-press-release/pm-dedicates-nation-sail%E2%80%99s-modernised-expanded-iisco-steel-plant-burnpur   |title = PM Dedicates to the Nation SAIL's Modernised & Expanded IISCO Steel Plant at Burnpur |work = Press Release | publisher= SAIL | accessdate = 4 March 2017}}</ref> As of 2015, the investment for modernization was the single largest investment in West Bengal till then.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.sail.co.in/sail-press-release/chairman-sail-reviews-performance-isp-burnpur | title = Chairman, SAIL reviews performance of ISP, Burnpur | work= Press Release 7 March 2015  | publisher =  SAIL |accessdate =  30 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Coal===\n[[Eastern Coalfields]], which has its headquarters in Sanctoria near Dishergarh, has a significant presence in the area due to the huge deposits of high-quality coal. However, most of the coalfields and surrounding residential colonies are located away from the main city.

NH 19 has been broadened as part of the [[Golden Quadrilateral]] project and now allows three-lane traffic in both directions. A highway bypass avoids the areas of Ushagram, Murgasol, Asansol Bazar, Chelidanga, BNR, Gopalpur, Neamatpur, Kulti, and Barakar. Some of the other important roads of the city are namely Vivekananda Avenue, Burnpur Road, and S.B Gorai Road.\n\nThe [[South Bengal State Transport Corporation]] operates daily bus services to Kolkata and numerous other destinations, such as Malda, Siliguri, Midnapur, Bankura, Siuri, Purulia, Burdwan, Kalna, Howrah, Barackpore, Digha, [[Bolpur]], [[Kirnahar]] and Berhampore. The [[North Bengal State Transport Corporation]] also runs services to and from the city and towns in North Bengal like Malda, Raiganj and Balurghat. There are also many private buses, Taxis and Radio Taxis, which ply locally and on intercity and interstate routes.\n\n===Railway===\n[[File:Asansol Junction by Atra.jpg|thumb|Asansol Railway Station]]\n[[Asansol Junction railway station]] is the Division of [[Eastern Railway zone]] This is one of the oldest divisions on the Indian Railways and has always been in the forefront of operations, both freight and passenger. As far as Eastern Railway is concerned, Asansol Division is referred to as the heart of operations, being at the crossroads of the Grand Chord route via Gaya and the main line route via Patna. With a total of 629.38 route kilometers, the division has the unique distinction of having quadruple lines (two up and two down line) from Khana to Sitarampur.\n\nThe railway track from Kolkata to Delhi passes through the subdivision and bifurcates into the main line and the grand chord line at [[Sitarampur]] railway junction, a little to the west of Asansol railway junction. Another railway track links Asansol with Adra and then to [[Jamshedpur]] via Purulia and [[Kharagpur]] via Bankura. A branch line connects Andal with Sainthia on the [[Sahibganj Loop]].\n\nAlmost all the trains linking Kolkata with north India also connect with Asansol including Sealdah Rajdhani, Howrah Rajdhani, Howrah Duronto, Sealdah Humsafar Express, Yuva Express and Shalimar Duronto. As a result, Asansol enjoys good connectivity with cities like [[New Delhi]], [[Jammu]], [[Amritsar]], [[Ludhiana]], [[Allahabad]], [[Kanpur]], [[Lucknow]], [[Dehradun]], [[Jaipur]], [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]], [[Jodhpur]], [[Jaisalmer]], [[Gwalior]], [[Bhopal]], [[Indore]], [[Patna]], [[Ranchi]] and [[Dhanbad]] on the one hand and commands a fairly good traffic movement towards the western cities like [[Mumbai]], [[Ahmedabad]] and [[Surat]] and southern cities like [[Bhubaneshwar]], [[Visakhapatnam]], [[Vijaywada]], [[Chennai]], [[Bangalore]] and [[Trivandrum]]. It is also connected with [[Guwahati]] in the north-east region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.makemytrip.com/railways/asansol_jn-asn-railway-station.html/|title=Asansol Jn Train Railway Station|website=Make My Trip|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523124823/http://www.makemytrip.com/railways/asansol_jn-asn-railway-station.html/|archive-date=23 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Air===\nThe domestic airport that serves the city is [[Kazi Nazrul Islam Airport]]. The airport is located in Andal. It is roughly {{convert|25|km|mi}} from the Asansol City Bus Terminus.\n\nThere is also a private airport located at Burnpur Riverside Area. At present this Airport is operated by [[IISCO Steel Plant|IISCO]]. Recently [[Airport Authority of India]] gave nod to start commercial flights for six routes in West Bengal; [[Burnpur Airport]] being one of them is hopeful to receive its first commercial flight by the last quarter of 2019.<ref>http://cadup.gov.in/writereaddata/pdf/RCS_Round_1_and_2.pdf</ref>\n\nThe nearest international airport is [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport]] at [[Dum Dum]] in Kolkata.\n\n==Economy==\n\nThe economy of Asansol is primarily dependent on its steel and coal industries, railways, and its superb trade and commerce.\n\n===Steel===\n[[File:IISCO Panoramic View 1.jpg|thumb|right|IISCO panoramic view, Asansol]]\n[[File:Modernisation of ISP.JPG|thumb|right|Modernised ISP]]\nThe [[Steel Authority of India]] [[IISCO]] (Indian Iron and Steel Company Ltd) steel-making plant at [[Kulti]] was the first such facility in India. It became well-known during the 1960s and 1970s, with its company shares being traded on the [[London Stock Exchange]]. However, a decade later the company became loss-making until it was revived in 2006 when it merged with the [[Steel Authority of India]]. Modernisation at [[IISCO Steel Plant]] has helped the city develop at a very rapid pace. The plant's capacity will be raised from 0.4 MT to 2.5 MT of saleable steel, using what will be the biggest [[blast furnace]] in the country.<ref>{{cite web| url =https://www.sail.co.in/sail-press-release/pm-dedicates-nation-sail%E2%80%99s-modernised-expanded-iisco-steel-plant-burnpur   |title = PM Dedicates to the Nation SAIL's Modernised & Expanded IISCO Steel Plant at Burnpur |work = Press Release | publisher= SAIL | accessdate = 4 March 2017}}</ref> As of 2015, the investment for modernization was the single largest investment in West Bengal till then.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.sail.co.in/sail-press-release/chairman-sail-reviews-performance-isp-burnpur | title = Chairman, SAIL reviews performance of ISP, Burnpur | work= Press Release 7 March 2015  | publisher =  SAIL |accessdate =  30 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Coal===\n[[Eastern Coalfields]], which has its headquarters in Sanctoria near Dishergarh, has a significant presence in the area due to the huge deposits of high-quality coal. However, most of the coalfields and surrounding residential colonies are located away from the main city. Nearby areas like Ranigunj, Chinakuri, and Jamuria are of particular importance as coal blocks. As of 2012, the total coal reserve in the ECL command area up to 600 metre depth was 49.17 billion tonnes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.easterncoal.gov.in/|title=Welcome to official website of Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL)|website=www.easterncoal.gov.in}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coalindia.in/en-us/company/history.aspx|title=History|accessdate=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Railways===\nRailways also is a big contributor to the economy of Asansol. Railways were the first employer in the city and they are credited with developing the city in the late 19th century. Asansol is one of four divisions of Eastern Railway Zone and among the major revenue generating divisions in [[Indian Railways]]. World's largest vertically integrated organisation [[Chittaranjan Locomotive Works]] under [[Indian Railways]] is also situated here.

The band currently consist of lead vocalist Dave Faber, lead guitarist Jordan Pritchett, bass guitarist Jeremy \"Krikit\" Liddle and drummer Seamus O'Neill.\n\n==Biography==\nFaber Drive is a four-piece Juno Award-nominated Canadian rock band from Mission, British Columbia. They have toured with bands such as Hedley, Stereos, Marianas Trench, Simple Plan and Metro Station. They have gained a huge amount of popularity in many parts of Canada. Already well known for a local fan base, Faber Drive released a limited edition three-song EP under the band name Faber. Due to legal issues, the band changed their name to Faber Drive.\n\nDiscovered by [[Chad Kroeger]] of [[Nickelback]] and signed to his [[604 Records]] label, Faber Drive released their debut album ''Seven Second Surgery'' on May 1, 2007, which was followed by the release of four singles. The band's biggest influencees are [[U2]], [[The Police]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Stryper]] and [[Winger (band)|Winger]]. The band also featured in the American drama television series ''[[Kyle XY]]''. Two of their songs, \"Killin' Me\" and \"Summer Fades to Fall\", had featured in the show. The band also made an appearance in episode 3.01, \"Psychic Friend\", which aired on January 19, 2009. The band's lead singer Dave Faber is married to Ricarda Faber and has four kids\u2014Faith, David Dayton, Patience and Isaiah.\n\n==Name==\nThe band got their name when Faber and Red were driving and Faber was playing guitar behind the wheel and drove through a red light. Red then said \"Faber drive!\", thus giving them the name Faber Drive. After winning the Fox Seeds competition, they changed their name to Faber Drive to avoid potential legal issues. One of the names they considered before electing Faber Drive was Seven Second Surgery, but they decided it made a better album title than band name.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation===\nFaber taught \"Red\" how to play drums for a while and asked him if he wanted to audition for his band. Hinsley was referred to Faber by his brother. At first, Dave thought he wasn't what he was looking for. A couple days later, Hinsley invited Faber for some beverages and they just connected. Dave found his lead guitarist. Red and Faber saw Krikit playing bass at an Easter service at the local church. Faber gave him his number, Krikit thought he was trying to make him come to church more often but he was going to stop coming because he had started drinking and didn't feel it was right. When he found out Faber and Red weren't from the church he was overwhelmed. He learned all the songs and played without hesitation three days before the band's first gig. Since then, they have opened for bands such as Nickelback, Hedley and Simple Plan.\n\n===Early years and rise to fame===\nAfter forming Faber, Dave would sign to Chad Kroeger of Nickelback's 604 Records label and hook up with [[Joey Moi]] for pre-production and Brian Howes to co-write with Faber. They then joined Fox's Battle of the Bands and would eventually win. After the band's triumph, they released a [[Faber (EP)|limited edition self-titled EP]]. They would later change their name to Faber Drive to avoid potential legal issues and would go on tour to promote their debut album titled ''[[Seven Second Surgery]]''. Some concerts were partially taped on camera by band members and posted on YouTube. They would release three singles and music videos from ''Seven Second Surgery''. In April 2008, Ray was married and decided to leave the band. Calvin \"Poncho\" Lechner would join Faber Drive's line up and replace Red. They would later release a fourth single titled \"[[Sleepless Nights (Faber Drive song)|Sleepless Nights]]\", concerning a child's point of view of his parents fighting. In the summer of 2008, David Hinsley quit the band. Zubin Thakkar from the band Prize Fighter would come in to replace Hinsley and play in concerts until Faber Drive's last show in October 2008.\n\n===''Seven Second Surgery''===\nFaber Drive's debut album ''[[Seven Second Surgery]]'' was released on May 1, 2007. Four singles were released from ''Seven Second Surgery'': \"[[Second Chance (Faber Drive song)|Second Chance]]\", \"[[Tongue Tied (Faber Drive song)|Tongue Tied]]\", \"[[When I'm with You (Faber Drive song)|When I'm with You]]\", and \"[[Sleepless Nights (Faber Drive song)|Sleepless Nights]]\" (featuring Brian Melo). While \"Second Chance\" and \"Tongue Tied\" had successful chart positions in the west of Canada, \"When I'm with You\" had its best chart positions in the east.\n\n===''Can't Keep a Secret''===\nThe band's second album ''[[Can't Keep a Secret]]'' was released on November 10, 2009. Lead single \"[[G-Get Up and Dance]]\" was produced by Faber, [[Dave Ogilvie|Dave \"Rave\" Ogilvie]] ([[Nine Inch Nails]]) and Colin \"Crocker\" Friesen. The single premiered on July 13, 2009 and became available on iTunes on July 21, 2009. Guitarist Jordan Pritchett, son of country singer [[Aaron Pritchett]], and drummer Andrew Stricko joined and replaced Hinsley and Lechner. \"G-Get Up and Dance\" went Gold after 5 weeks, reached number 6 on the [[Canadian Hot 100]].\n\n===''Lost in Paradise''===\nThe band released their third studio album ''Lost in Paradise'' on August 28, 2012. Since the album's release, Faber Drive has shot and released music videos for the songs \"Do It in Hollywood\", \"Candy Store\" and \"Life Is Waiting\". And before they released their new single \"Life Is Waiting\", [[Andrew Stricko]] left the band and Seamus O'Neill replaced him. The band headed across Canada on the successful Lost in Paradise tour in Fall/Winter 2012. They have since visited [[Singapore]] to perform two shows for Music Matters and performed at some music festivals during the summer of 2013. They have since released two more singles from their third studio album, \"Too Little Too Late\" (featuring [[Pierre Bouvier]] of [[Simple Plan]]) and \"Dead On The Dancefloor\" (featuring Proper Villains). But the Music Videos are still not made. Therefore, the Official Lyric Video of \"Dead On The Dancefloor\" is already made by [[Warner Music Philippines]]. Note: (The single \"Dead On The Dancefloor\" [featuring Proper Villains] is the promotional single in Philippines).\n\n===2014 to present===\nIn April 2014, Faber Drive announced that they would play at Spring Fest 2014 at Kal Tire Place in Vernon, British Columbia, featuring [[Kardinal Offishall]], [[Karl Wolf]], [[JRDN]] and [[These Kids Wear Crowns]]. On May 23, 2014, the show was cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances. Simple Plan toured with Faber Drive in June 2014 in Kirkland Lake, Canada, marking Faber Drive's last show of 2014. They later released two demos from their fourth album, \"The Best of Me\" and \"Gonna Make It\". On July 24, 2015, the band held an acoustic mini-show at Highstreet in Abbotsford, British Columbia.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn January 2016, Faber Drive posted on their official Facebook account that they would have new exciting things possibly happening that year. Then, they started to post some photos from their past concerts and music videos from their previous albums. Six months later, the band posted a photo that Dave is already back in the studio and they hinted that they would release new music shortly. On December 4, 2016, they held a reunion concert with their friends and special guests at the Hard Rock Casino in Vancouver. Following this, they released a Christmas song called \"We 3 Kings\". On March 13, 2017, they released new demos from their upcoming album \u2015 \"More Than Perfect\",\"Without\",\"Without a Fight\", \"One Million\" and \"Done My Best\". On August 5, 2018, they released a new single called \"Surrender\".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Members==\n\n===Current members===\n*Dave Faber \u2013 lead vocals, guitar <small>(2004\u2013present)</small>\n*Jeremy \"Krikit\" Liddle \u2013 bass, vocals <small>(2004\u2013present)</small>\n*Jordan \"JP\" Pritchett \u2013 lead guitar, vocals <small>(2008\u2013present)</small>\n*Seamus O'Neill \u2013 drums, vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n\n===Former members===\n*Ray 'red' Bull \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]], [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]] <small>(2004\u20132008)</small>\n*David Hinsley \u2013 [[lead guitar]], backing vocals <small>(2004\u20132008)</small>\n*Calvin Lechner \u2013 drums, backing vocals <small>(2008)</small>\n*[[Andrew Stricko]] \u2013 drums, backing vocals <small>(2009\u20132012)</small>\n\n===Touring members===\n* Zubin Thakkar \u2013 lead guitar and backing vocals <small>(2008)</small>\n* Simon Nagel \u2013 lead guitar and backing vocals <small>(2008)</small>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Faber Drive discography}}\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Date of release'''\n|'''Title'''\n|'''Label'''\n|-\n|May 1, 2007\n|''[[Seven Second Surgery]]''\n|rowspan=\"3\"| [[604 Records]]\n|-\n|November 10, 2009\n|''[[Can't Keep a Secret]]''\n|-\n|August 28, 2012\n|''[[Lost in Paradise (Faber Drive album)|Lost in Paradise]]''\n|}\n\n===EP===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Date of release'''\n|'''Title'''\n|'''Label'''\n|-\n|2005\n|''[[Faber (EP)|Faber]]''\n| [[604 Records]]\n|}\n\n==Awards==\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n| 2007 || \"[[Tongue Tied (Faber Drive song)|Tongue Tied]]\" || [[SOCAN]] No. 1 Song Award || {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2008 || rowspan=\"2\"|\"[[Second Chance (Faber Drive song)|Second Chance]]\" || Canadian Radio Music Awards for Best New Group (Hot A/C) of the Year || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Juno Awards|Juno]] for Best New Group of the Year || {{nom}}\n|-\n{{end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Faber Drive discography]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/faberdrivetv Faber Drive TV] on [[YouTube]]\n* [http://www.faberdrivefreaks.ning.com Official Faber Drive Street Team]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{Faber Drive}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Canadian pop punk groups]]\n[[Category:People from Mission, British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 2004]]\n[[Category:Musical quartets]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from British Columbia]]\n[[Category:2004 establishments in British Columbia]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Canadian pop punk band}}\n{{Redirect|Ray Bull|the British psychologist|Ray Bull (psychologist)}}\n{{unreferenced|date=March 2013}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name            = \n| background      = group_or_band\n| image           = [[File:Faberdrivenow.jpg|250 px]]\n| caption         = Faber Drive in 2011.
