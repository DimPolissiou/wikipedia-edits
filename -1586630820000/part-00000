The carving is known as \"th' Owd Man of [[Bonsall, Derbyshire|Bonsall]].\" The ore was washed out through a sieve, whose iron wire had been drawn in [[Hathersage]] since the [[Middle Ages]]. Smelting took place in [[Bole hill|boles]], hence the name Bolehill. The lead industry, the miner, the ore and the waste were known collectively as \"t'owd man\".\n\n[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] granted a charter for a miners' court in the town, the Bar Moot. Anyone had a right to dig for ore wherever he chose, except in churchyards, gardens or roadways. All that was needed for a claim was to place one's stowce (winch) on the site and extract enough ore to pay tribute to the \"barmaster\". The present Bar Moot building dates from 1814. Within is a brass dish for measuring the levy due to the Crown. Even into the 20th century, the penalty for stealing from a mine was to have a hand nailed to the stowce, giving a miscreant the choice of tearing himself loose or starving to death. The [[Barmote Court]] is still held at the Bar Moot hall in Chapel Lane and controls all matters of lead mining.\n\nBy the 18th century there were many thousand lead mines worked individually. Defoe gives a first-hand account of a lead miner's family and the miner himself at work.<ref>Daniel Defoe, (c. 1724) ''A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, divided into circuits or journies: Letter 8, Part 2: The Peak District,'' Reprinted: London: J.

One member, [[Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet]], fought on Parliament's side in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. A predecessor of his, Anthony Gell, founded the local grammar school, and a successor, Phillip Gell, opened the [[Via Gellia]] (perhaps an allusion to the Roman Via Appia), a road from the family lead mines round Wirksworth to a smelter in [[Cromford]]. More recently he has been remembered in the name of [[Anthony Gell School]].\n\nThe [[carboniferous limestone]] around Wirksworth has been extensively quarried over the town's history, resulting in several rock faces and cliffs surrounding the town.

Arkwright's mill was sublet in 1792, when Arkwright's son, [[Richard Arkwright Junior|Richard]], began to sell off family property and move into banking. It was named [[Haarlem Mill]] in 1815, when converted to weaving tape by Madely, Hackett and Riley, who had set up Haarlem Tape Works in Derby in 1806. In 1879 the Wheatcroft family, who were producing tape at Speedwell Mill, expanded into Haarlem. The two mills together employed 230 people; it was said that their weekly output equalled the circumference of the earth, and that Wirksworth was the main producer of [[red tape]] for [[Whitehall]]. These mills are close together at Miller's Green next to the Derby road. Haarlem Mill now houses an art collective; Speedwell Mill has been replaced by private houses and a carpentry workshop.\n\n==Geography==\nIn the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]] Wirksworth civil parish had 2,416 dwellings, 2,256 households and a population of 5,038.<ref name=2011census/>\n\nDistricts of Wirksworth include Yokecliffe, Gorsey Bank, Bolehill, Mountford and Miller's Green.

Arkwright's mill was sublet in 1792, when Arkwright's son, [[Richard Arkwright Junior|Richard]], began to sell off family property and move into banking. It was named [[Haarlem Mill]] in 1815, when converted to weaving tape by Madely, Hackett and Riley, who had set up Haarlem Tape Works in Derby in 1806. In 1879 the Wheatcroft family, who were producing tape at Speedwell Mill, expanded into Haarlem. The two mills together employed 230 people; it was said that their weekly output equalled the circumference of the earth, and that Wirksworth was the main producer of [[red tape]] for [[Whitehall]]. These mills are close together at Miller's Green next to the Derby road. Haarlem Mill now houses an art collective; Speedwell Mill has been replaced by private houses and a carpentry workshop.\n\n==Geography==\nIn the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]] Wirksworth civil parish had 2,416 dwellings, 2,256 households and a population of 5,038.<ref name=2011census/>\n\nDistricts of Wirksworth include Yokecliffe, Gorsey Bank, Bolehill, Mountford and Miller's Green. Bolehill, although technically a hamlet in its own right in Wirksworth's suburbs, is the oldest and most northerly part of the town, while Yokecliffe is a newer estate in the westerly area. Modern houses have been built in the Three Trees area and at the bottom of Steeple Grange (Spring Close).\n\n==Education==\nThere are five schools in Wirksworth:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wirksworth-federation-inf.ik.org/p_Home.ikml |title=Wirksworth Federation Infant Schools |publisher=Wirksworth-federation-inf.ik.org |date=30 April 2012 |access-date=10 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726172813/http://www.wirksworth-federation-inf.ik.org/p_Home.ikml |archive-date=26 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Church of England]] and county infants, and regularly combined but on two sites, Wirksworth Junior School, the [[Anthony Gell School]] and Callow Park College.

The current school is an 11\u201318 comprehensive on a larger site by the Hannage Brook with about 800 pupils. The school's four houses are named after Fearne, Arkwright ([[Sir Richard Arkwright]]), Wright ([[Joseph Wright of Derby]]) and Gell. Its catchment area is the town and surrounding villages: [[Middleton-by-Wirksworth|Middleton]], [[Carsington]], [[Brassington]], [[Kirk Ireton]], [[Turnditch]], [[Matlock Bath]], [[Cromford]] and [[Crich]].

He sometimes played keyboards, guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. During the early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on the popular UK quiz show ''[[Pop Quiz]]'', hosted by [[Mike Read]]. In 2014, he appeared in ''[[The Life of Rock with Brian Pern]]'' as himself.\n\n== Early life ==\nRoger Taylor was born on 26 July 1949 at West Norfolk & Lynn Hospital in [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]]. The new maternity ward was opened by Princess Elizabeth (the future queen, [[Elizabeth II]]), where she was introduced to 16 new mothers including Winifred Taylor, his mother. Taylor first lived at 87 High Street in King's Lynn, and later moved to Beulah Street in the town.

When he was seven years old, he and some friends formed his first band, the Bubblingover Boys, in which he played the [[ukulele]]. He briefly attended [[Truro Cathedral School]]; at the age of 13, he joined [[Truro School]] as a day boy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com/?g=57322673&cr=6|title=Roger|publisher=themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> At the age of 15, Taylor became a member of the Reaction, a semi-professional rock band formed mainly of boys from Truro School.

The band lasted for two years before Staffell departed to join [[Humpy Bong]], leaving the band with a catalogue of nine songs.\n\nSmile reunited for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor's band [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] were headliners and he brought May and Staffell on to play \"Earth\" and \"If I Were a Carpenter\".<ref>[http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208151834/http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11 |date=8 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s\u2013present: Queen ===\n{{Main|Queen (band)}}\n[[Image:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor performing with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in 1979.]]\n\nIn 1969, Taylor was working with [[Freddie Mercury]] at the Kensington Market (they were sharing a flat at around the same time). Mercury, then known as Freddie Bulsara, was an avid fan of Smile. The band split up in 1970. In the same year, Taylor turned down the chance to become drummer for [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], which led to [[Phil Collins]] joining instead.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8784298/Queen-40th-anniversary-10-things-you-never-knew.html | title= Queen 40th anniversary: 10 things you never knew | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=24 September 2011 | accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref> Bulsara convinced the remaining two members of Smile to continue and he eventually joined the band, which he renamed Queen. In 1971, they recruited bass guitarist [[John Deacon]], before going on to release their [[Queen (Queen album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1973. Taylor is the third most credited songwriter for the band, usually contributing one or two tracks per album.\n\n===1977\u2013present: Solo career===\nTaylor has had a productive solo career, releasing five albums. His first single was his 1977 \"I Wanna Testify\". He recorded it during Queen's sessions for the ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' album. The A-side, although a cover of the Parliaments song of the same name, was completely different from the original. The B-side was a self-penned song \"Turn on the TV\".\n\nTaylor's first solo album, ''[[Fun in Space]]'', was released in 1981. Taylor performed all vocals and played all instruments aside of about half of the keyboards, which were done by engineer [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]]. With Queen still touring heavily and recording at the time of release, Taylor was unable to promote the album to its fullest extent, so he appeared on some European TV shows to promote the single, \"Future Management\", including ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The only other single to come from the album was \"My Country\". The only US single released from the album was \"Let's Get Crazy\".\n\nTaylor's next venture, ''[[Strange Frontier]]'', came in June 1984. The three singles from the album were the title track, \"Beautiful Dreams\" (in Portugal only) and \"Man on Fire\", the latter becoming a live favourite for him in later years. No attempts to promote the singles were made since Queen toured to promote ''[[The Works (Queen album)|The Works]]'', and Taylor did not perform on any TV shows. ''Strange Frontier'' included guest appearances by bandmates Freddie Mercury, Brian May and John Deacon. Mercury sang backing vocals on \"Killing Time\", Deacon remixed the B-side \"I Cry For You\" and [[Rick Parfitt]] co-wrote and played on \"It's An Illusion\". David Richards, Queen's engineer and producer at the time, also co-wrote two of the tracks. The album includes covers of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Racing in the Street]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Masters of War]]\".\n\nIn 1986, Taylor co-produced ''[[Vigilante (Magnum album)|Vigilante]]'', the sixth studio album by rock band [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Patrick Lemieux | author2=Adam Unger |title=The Queen Chronology: The Recording & Release History of the Band|year=2013|page=54|publisher=Across the Board Books|isbn=978-0991984046}}</ref>\n\nAfter Queen finished their 1986 [[A Kind of Magic|Magic Tour]], Taylor started a new band, [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], which released three albums over their six years of existence. In 1993, the band split up, after performing one final gig at the [[Wickham Festival#History|Gosport Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/roger-taylor-21213223|title=Roger Taylor|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Taylor worked with [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]], drummer and pianist of [[X Japan]] and released the song \"Foreign Sand\" and a reworking of the Cross's \"Final Destination\". The album ''Happiness?'' was \"Dedicated to the tasmanian tiger \u2013 thylacinus cynocephalus, but most especially... for Freddie\". \"Nazis 1994\" from this album became Taylor's first hit single in England and was followed by two other top 40 UK hits, \"Happiness\" and \"Foreign Sand\".\n\nIn 1998, Taylor released his fourth solo album ''[[Electric Fire]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZIjT8PgJMEC&pg=PA499&lpg=PA499&dq=In+1998,+Taylor+released+his+fourth+solo+album+Electric+Fire.&source=bl&ots=XBU0kDQe4_&sig=BBO6TCasZB87g_GSrP6vLq5xblE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinuvqOrMvZAhVBmBQKHZAEB34Q6AEIajAI#v=onepage&q=In%201998,%20Taylor%20released%20his%20fourth%20solo%20album%20Electric%20Fire.&f=false|title=The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002|last=Gregory|first=Andy|date=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781857431612|language=en}}</ref> He supported it with a small tour in the spring of 1999, on which Brian May joined him at the gig in Wolverhampton. Taylor also performed one of the first Internet-gigs \u2013 for which he got a mention in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]].<ref>[http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930042840/http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, after nearly twelve years between solo albums, Taylor planned to release a new studio album titled ''[[The Unblinking Eye (Everything Is Broken)|The Unblinking Eye]]''. The first single, of the same name, was released on 23 November 2009 as a digital download, but due to popular demand it was released as a limited edition single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/news/1517/|title=QueenOnline \u2013 News |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> Originally leaked to the official Queen fan club's website for members only, it still managed to be on YouTube within hours of the early bird release. It was announced in late 2012 that fans would be able to vote on which songs appeared on the new album, with the album itself slated for release that year.\n\nThe album is called ''[[Fun on Earth]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetrock.com/news/rock-news/roger-taylor-to-release-solo-album/ |title=Roger Taylor To Release Solo Album &#124; Rock News &#124; News |publisher=Planet Rock |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> and was released on 11 November 2013.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6296827/queen-roger-taylor-solo-record-adam-lambert|title=Queen's Roger Taylor Talks Solo Work, Hopes Band Will Record With Adam Lambert|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\n=== The Cross ===\n{{Main|The Cross (band)}}\n\nThe Cross were a side project of Taylor's that existed from 1987 to 1993 and released three albums. While still the drummer for Queen, Taylor fronted the Cross as rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist. On its debut release, ''The Cross'' incorporated dance influences which they dropped on their remaining two albums. The band never enjoyed much commercial success, except in Germany.\n\n=== ''Shove It'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 1.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] in 1990]]\n\nAfter Queen's 1986 Magic Tour, the band members went their separate ways to do various solo work. Taylor decided to form a new band with whom he could tour. He had already written and recorded the album himself before finding a band to play the songs with. He eventually placed an ad for band members in a national newspaper, hinting he was a famous rock musician. The position of keyboard player was duly offered to [[Spike Edney]] after two successful Queen tours in which Edney had played. When the auditions were over, the line-up was completed by Peter Noone on bass, Clayton Moss on guitar and [[Josh Macrae]] on drums. Taylor himself would take the responsibility on lead vocals and rhythm guitar.\n\nThe first album, ''Shove It'', was released in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Cross-Shove-It/release/6351445|title=The Cross (3) - Shove It|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/shove-it-mw0000651910|title=Shove It - Cross {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> In Europe, '[[Heaven for Everyone]]\" (later a Queen song) contained Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and Taylor on backing vocals. However, on the single version and American album version the roles were switched. The European CD contained an extra track (compared to cassette and LP) in the 2nd Shelf Mix, the US version having \"Feel the Force\" as its extra track. The band promoted hard (especially in Germany), with many TV performances of singles including an appearance at the Montreux Golden Rose festival in 1988. The tour took in dates in the UK and Germany. Three singles were released from the album: \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"Heaven for Everyone\" and \"Shove It\". Another single, \"Manipulator\", was released in 1988, but it was not included on any album. It was also the only song from the time that had joint writing credits, Taylor sharing them with Edney and Steve Strange.\n\n=== ''Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 2.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with the Cross in 1990.]]\n\nAfter finishing Queen's 1989 album ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'', Taylor went into the studio with the rest of the Cross for the first time to record ''[[Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know (The Cross album)|Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know]]''. The band composed the opening track \"On Top of the World Ma\" with a riff bearing a resemblance to the [[Led Zeppelin]] track \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\". The rest of the album consisted mainly of individually written songs, except for \"Power To Love\" which was the result of the combined effort of Macrae, Noone and Moss. Clayton Moss sang lead vocals on his own track \"Better Things\", and Spike Edney played [[mandolin]] on \"Final Destination\", which was written by Taylor. \"Final Destination\" was released as a single, as were \"Liar\" and \"Power To Love\", the latter being the last single to be released in the UK by the band. \"Final Destination\" came with a live rendition of Taylor's song \"Man on Fire\" as a B-side, and \"Liar\" (Noone) had a brand new track, \"In Charge of My Heart\", which was also penned by Taylor. The 12\" single and CD of \"Liar\" also included extended remixes of both \"Liar\" and \"In Charge of My Heart\". The instrumental section at the beginning of \"In Charge of My Heart\" was used as the opening to concerts on the accompanying tour. \"Closer To You\" (Edney) had been planned to be released in America, but never was. The group having seemingly given up on the UK market, the accompanying tour only included dates in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Ibiza. Unusual for such tours, every song from the new album was played live.\n\n=== ''Blue Rock'' ===\nMade at a time when Taylor's efforts were concentrated on Queen and Mercury himself, ''[[Blue Rock (album)|Blue Rock]]'' gave the other members of the band a chance to take control of the upcoming album. It was in fact mostly written by Edney, who contributed three of his own tracks and contributed to four more. Once again the opening track was penned by the entire band, \"Bad Attitude\" was written (although not complete) by the Christmas fan club party of 1990. The album itself contained a lot of vocals not from Taylor, but mainly of Edney and Noone. Examples of this can be heard in \"Put It All Down To Love\" (Edney), \"Life Changes\" (Moss, Noone, Edney and Macrae) and \"Heartland\" (The B-side to Life Changes, penned by Noone). Blue Rock itself was only released in Germany (although promo copies were released in Italy and Japan), so copies are somewhat rare. \"New Dark Ages\" (Taylor) was released in Germany with another live version of \"Man on Fire\", whilst \"Life Changes\" was released with the B-side \"Heartland\". It was however immediately withdrawn due to Mercury's death. The tour was in support of [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]], so the concert lengths were short (45 mins.) and very few bootlegs have survived. The tour pace was rapid, covering 20 dates in one month.\n\n=== Break-up of the Cross ===\nThe band broke up in 1993 after performing a final show. Taylor continued working with Queen and produced solo albums. Drummer Macrae accompanied Taylor on his solo tours and also played percussion at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Both Taylor and keyboardist Edney participated in the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] tours, while Macrae worked behind the scenes as co-producer, sound engineer and Pro Tools engineer for them. In the late 1990s, Edney formed the SAS Band (\"Spike's All Stars\"), a group with an ever-changing line-up of popular '80s musicians.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nTaylor has appeared along with May for various other events and promotions, including Queen's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/queen |title=Queen: inducted in 2001 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> and the \"[[Party at the Palace]]\" in 2002, celebrating the golden jubilee of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenvault.com/patp.html |title=Party at the Palace |publisher=QueenVault.com |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> In 2004, Taylor, May, and Mike Dixon received the [[Helpmann Award]] for Best Music Direction for the musical [[We Will Rock You (musical)|''We Will Rock You'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helpmannawards.com.au/2004/past-nominees-and-winners/industry-awards|title=Past nominees and winners Helpmann Awards|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref>  At [[Live Earth]] in 2007, Taylor opened the concert with [[Taylor Hawkins]] of [[Foo Fighters]] and [[Chad Smith]] of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].\n\nTaylor and May, performing as Queen, also appeared three times on the American singing contest television show ''[[American Idol]]''. The first appearance was on 11 April 2006, during which that week's contestants were required to sing a Queen song. Songs performed included \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\", and \"[[Innuendo (song)|Innuendo]]\".

He said: \"I still think listening to Mitch Mitchell, especially the early stuff with Hendrix, is just fantastic. This fusion of jazz technique and wonderful riffs but with this rolling ferocious attack on the whole kit, it had lots of jazz influences I think. In fact for me he played the kit like a song, it was just wonderful. Total integration into the song. Not just marking time\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nTaylor has also expressed great admiration for [[John Bonham]] of [[Led Zeppelin]]. Speaking of Bonham, Taylor said, \"The greatest rock and roll drummer of all time was John Bonham, who did things that nobody had ever even thought possible before with the drum kit. And also the greatest sound out of his drums \u2013 they sounded enormous, and just one bass drum. So fast on it that he did more with one bass drum than most people could do with three, if they could manage them. And he had technique to burn and fantastic power and tremendous feel for rock and roll\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/> However, for just sheer technique, Taylor described the jazz and [[big band]] drummer [[Buddy Rich]] as \"the best I've ever seen\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nSpeaking to ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' in 1984, Taylor also described [[Keith Moon]], the drummer of [[the Who]], as \"absolutely brilliant...he had a total unique style; he didn't owe anyone anything.\"<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\"/>\n\n== Tributes ==\nIn 2013, a newly-discovered species of the genus ''[[Heteragrion]]'' (Odonata: Zygoptera) from Brazil was named ''Heteragrion rogertaylori'' after Taylor, in honour of his \"powerful sound, wonderful lyrics and raspy voice \"{{spaced ndash}}one of four ''Heteragrion'' flatwing [[Damselfly|damselflies]] named after the bandmates, paying tribute to the 40th anniversary of Queen's founding.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2013/f/z03685p080f.pdf|title = Diagnoses and discussion of the group 1 and 2 Brazilian species of Heteragrion, with descriptions of four new species (Odonata: Megapodagrionidae).

As a producer, he has produced albums by [[Virginia Wolf]], [[Jimmy Nail]], and [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].\n\nIn addition to his drum work, Taylor is well known for his [[falsetto]] vocal range. He sometimes played keyboards, guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. During the early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on the popular UK quiz show ''[[Pop Quiz]]'', hosted by [[Mike Read]]. In 2014, he appeared in ''[[The Life of Rock with Brian Pern]]'' as himself.\n\n== Early life ==\nRoger Taylor was born on 26 July 1949 at West Norfolk & Lynn Hospital in [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]]. The new maternity ward was opened by Princess Elizabeth (the future queen, [[Elizabeth II]]), where she was introduced to 16 new mothers including Winifred Taylor, his mother. Taylor first lived at 87 High Street in King's Lynn, and later moved to Beulah Street in the town. Taylor's first school was Rosebury Avenue school.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Trevor|first1=Heaton|title=Rock Star's Norfolk Childhood|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_03-20-1999_-_Eastern_Daily_Press_-_Rock_Star%27s_Norfolk_Childhood|website=Queen Archives|publisher=Eastern Daily Press}}</ref> Taylor moved to [[Truro]], [[Cornwall]], south west England, with his mother Winifred, father Michael and younger sister Clare. When he was seven years old, he and some friends formed his first band, the Bubblingover Boys, in which he played the [[ukulele]]. He briefly attended [[Truro Cathedral School]]; at the age of 13, he joined [[Truro School]] as a day boy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com/?g=57322673&cr=6|title=Roger|publisher=themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> At the age of 15, Taylor became a member of the Reaction, a semi-professional rock band formed mainly of boys from Truro School. Taylor had originally learned guitar, but became a drummer when he realised he had a more natural aptitude for it. Taylor taught himself to tune his drums, inspired by [[Keith Moon]] of [[the Who]] because of the \"great drums sounds\" on the early Who records.<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | title= Roger Taylor Interview | publisher= Queen Zone | accessdate= 10 August 2015 | url-status=dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150715215326/http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | archivedate= 15 July 2015 | df= dmy-all }}</ref> Another key influence on Taylor was drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]] of [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], who Taylor stated was his early role model.<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/interviews/roger-taylor-1/drum-master-class/ | title= Roger's Drum Master Class (Music Works - BBC World Service, November 28, 1993) | publisher=Queen Online | accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, Taylor went to London to study dentistry at the [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry|London Hospital Medical College]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/members/roger-taylor/|title=Roger Taylor |website=Queen official website|access-date=15 January 2017}}</ref> but he became bored with dentistry.

Smile included May on lead guitar, Staffell on lead vocals and bass, and later Taylor on drums. The band lasted for two years before Staffell departed to join [[Humpy Bong]], leaving the band with a catalogue of nine songs.\n\nSmile reunited for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor's band [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] were headliners and he brought May and Staffell on to play \"Earth\" and \"If I Were a Carpenter\".<ref>[http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208151834/http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11 |date=8 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s\u2013present: Queen ===\n{{Main|Queen (band)}}\n[[Image:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor performing with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in 1979.]]\n\nIn 1969, Taylor was working with [[Freddie Mercury]] at the Kensington Market (they were sharing a flat at around the same time). Mercury, then known as Freddie Bulsara, was an avid fan of Smile. The band split up in 1970. In the same year, Taylor turned down the chance to become drummer for [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], which led to [[Phil Collins]] joining instead.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8784298/Queen-40th-anniversary-10-things-you-never-knew.html | title= Queen 40th anniversary: 10 things you never knew | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=24 September 2011 | accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref> Bulsara convinced the remaining two members of Smile to continue and he eventually joined the band, which he renamed Queen. In 1971, they recruited bass guitarist [[John Deacon]], before going on to release their [[Queen (Queen album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1973. Taylor is the third most credited songwriter for the band, usually contributing one or two tracks per album.\n\n===1977\u2013present: Solo career===\nTaylor has had a productive solo career, releasing five albums. His first single was his 1977 \"I Wanna Testify\". He recorded it during Queen's sessions for the ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' album. The A-side, although a cover of the Parliaments song of the same name, was completely different from the original. The B-side was a self-penned song \"Turn on the TV\".\n\nTaylor's first solo album, ''[[Fun in Space]]'', was released in 1981. Taylor performed all vocals and played all instruments aside of about half of the keyboards, which were done by engineer [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]]. With Queen still touring heavily and recording at the time of release, Taylor was unable to promote the album to its fullest extent, so he appeared on some European TV shows to promote the single, \"Future Management\", including ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The only other single to come from the album was \"My Country\". The only US single released from the album was \"Let's Get Crazy\".\n\nTaylor's next venture, ''[[Strange Frontier]]'', came in June 1984. The three singles from the album were the title track, \"Beautiful Dreams\" (in Portugal only) and \"Man on Fire\", the latter becoming a live favourite for him in later years. No attempts to promote the singles were made since Queen toured to promote ''[[The Works (Queen album)|The Works]]'', and Taylor did not perform on any TV shows. ''Strange Frontier'' included guest appearances by bandmates Freddie Mercury, Brian May and John Deacon. Mercury sang backing vocals on \"Killing Time\", Deacon remixed the B-side \"I Cry For You\" and [[Rick Parfitt]] co-wrote and played on \"It's An Illusion\". David Richards, Queen's engineer and producer at the time, also co-wrote two of the tracks. The album includes covers of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Racing in the Street]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Masters of War]]\".\n\nIn 1986, Taylor co-produced ''[[Vigilante (Magnum album)|Vigilante]]'', the sixth studio album by rock band [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Patrick Lemieux | author2=Adam Unger |title=The Queen Chronology: The Recording & Release History of the Band|year=2013|page=54|publisher=Across the Board Books|isbn=978-0991984046}}</ref>\n\nAfter Queen finished their 1986 [[A Kind of Magic|Magic Tour]], Taylor started a new band, [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], which released three albums over their six years of existence. In 1993, the band split up, after performing one final gig at the [[Wickham Festival#History|Gosport Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/roger-taylor-21213223|title=Roger Taylor|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Taylor worked with [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]], drummer and pianist of [[X Japan]] and released the song \"Foreign Sand\" and a reworking of the Cross's \"Final Destination\". The album ''Happiness?'' was \"Dedicated to the tasmanian tiger \u2013 thylacinus cynocephalus, but most especially... for Freddie\". \"Nazis 1994\" from this album became Taylor's first hit single in England and was followed by two other top 40 UK hits, \"Happiness\" and \"Foreign Sand\".\n\nIn 1998, Taylor released his fourth solo album ''[[Electric Fire]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZIjT8PgJMEC&pg=PA499&lpg=PA499&dq=In+1998,+Taylor+released+his+fourth+solo+album+Electric+Fire.&source=bl&ots=XBU0kDQe4_&sig=BBO6TCasZB87g_GSrP6vLq5xblE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinuvqOrMvZAhVBmBQKHZAEB34Q6AEIajAI#v=onepage&q=In%201998,%20Taylor%20released%20his%20fourth%20solo%20album%20Electric%20Fire.&f=false|title=The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002|last=Gregory|first=Andy|date=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781857431612|language=en}}</ref> He supported it with a small tour in the spring of 1999, on which Brian May joined him at the gig in Wolverhampton. Taylor also performed one of the first Internet-gigs \u2013 for which he got a mention in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]].<ref>[http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930042840/http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, after nearly twelve years between solo albums, Taylor planned to release a new studio album titled ''[[The Unblinking Eye (Everything Is Broken)|The Unblinking Eye]]''. The first single, of the same name, was released on 23 November 2009 as a digital download, but due to popular demand it was released as a limited edition single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/news/1517/|title=QueenOnline \u2013 News |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> Originally leaked to the official Queen fan club's website for members only, it still managed to be on YouTube within hours of the early bird release. It was announced in late 2012 that fans would be able to vote on which songs appeared on the new album, with the album itself slated for release that year.\n\nThe album is called ''[[Fun on Earth]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetrock.com/news/rock-news/roger-taylor-to-release-solo-album/ |title=Roger Taylor To Release Solo Album &#124; Rock News &#124; News |publisher=Planet Rock |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> and was released on 11 November 2013.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6296827/queen-roger-taylor-solo-record-adam-lambert|title=Queen's Roger Taylor Talks Solo Work, Hopes Band Will Record With Adam Lambert|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\n=== The Cross ===\n{{Main|The Cross (band)}}\n\nThe Cross were a side project of Taylor's that existed from 1987 to 1993 and released three albums. While still the drummer for Queen, Taylor fronted the Cross as rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist. On its debut release, ''The Cross'' incorporated dance influences which they dropped on their remaining two albums. The band never enjoyed much commercial success, except in Germany.\n\n=== ''Shove It'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 1.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] in 1990]]\n\nAfter Queen's 1986 Magic Tour, the band members went their separate ways to do various solo work. Taylor decided to form a new band with whom he could tour. He had already written and recorded the album himself before finding a band to play the songs with. He eventually placed an ad for band members in a national newspaper, hinting he was a famous rock musician. The position of keyboard player was duly offered to [[Spike Edney]] after two successful Queen tours in which Edney had played. When the auditions were over, the line-up was completed by Peter Noone on bass, Clayton Moss on guitar and [[Josh Macrae]] on drums. Taylor himself would take the responsibility on lead vocals and rhythm guitar.\n\nThe first album, ''Shove It'', was released in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Cross-Shove-It/release/6351445|title=The Cross (3) - Shove It|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/shove-it-mw0000651910|title=Shove It - Cross {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> In Europe, '[[Heaven for Everyone]]\" (later a Queen song) contained Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and Taylor on backing vocals. However, on the single version and American album version the roles were switched. The European CD contained an extra track (compared to cassette and LP) in the 2nd Shelf Mix, the US version having \"Feel the Force\" as its extra track. The band promoted hard (especially in Germany), with many TV performances of singles including an appearance at the Montreux Golden Rose festival in 1988. The tour took in dates in the UK and Germany. Three singles were released from the album: \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"Heaven for Everyone\" and \"Shove It\". Another single, \"Manipulator\", was released in 1988, but it was not included on any album. It was also the only song from the time that had joint writing credits, Taylor sharing them with Edney and Steve Strange.\n\n=== ''Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 2.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with the Cross in 1990.]]\n\nAfter finishing Queen's 1989 album ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'', Taylor went into the studio with the rest of the Cross for the first time to record ''[[Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know (The Cross album)|Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know]]''. The band composed the opening track \"On Top of the World Ma\" with a riff bearing a resemblance to the [[Led Zeppelin]] track \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\". The rest of the album consisted mainly of individually written songs, except for \"Power To Love\" which was the result of the combined effort of Macrae, Noone and Moss. Clayton Moss sang lead vocals on his own track \"Better Things\", and Spike Edney played [[mandolin]] on \"Final Destination\", which was written by Taylor. \"Final Destination\" was released as a single, as were \"Liar\" and \"Power To Love\", the latter being the last single to be released in the UK by the band. \"Final Destination\" came with a live rendition of Taylor's song \"Man on Fire\" as a B-side, and \"Liar\" (Noone) had a brand new track, \"In Charge of My Heart\", which was also penned by Taylor. The 12\" single and CD of \"Liar\" also included extended remixes of both \"Liar\" and \"In Charge of My Heart\". The instrumental section at the beginning of \"In Charge of My Heart\" was used as the opening to concerts on the accompanying tour. \"Closer To You\" (Edney) had been planned to be released in America, but never was. The group having seemingly given up on the UK market, the accompanying tour only included dates in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Ibiza. Unusual for such tours, every song from the new album was played live.\n\n=== ''Blue Rock'' ===\nMade at a time when Taylor's efforts were concentrated on Queen and Mercury himself, ''[[Blue Rock (album)|Blue Rock]]'' gave the other members of the band a chance to take control of the upcoming album. It was in fact mostly written by Edney, who contributed three of his own tracks and contributed to four more. Once again the opening track was penned by the entire band, \"Bad Attitude\" was written (although not complete) by the Christmas fan club party of 1990. The album itself contained a lot of vocals not from Taylor, but mainly of Edney and Noone. Examples of this can be heard in \"Put It All Down To Love\" (Edney), \"Life Changes\" (Moss, Noone, Edney and Macrae) and \"Heartland\" (The B-side to Life Changes, penned by Noone). Blue Rock itself was only released in Germany (although promo copies were released in Italy and Japan), so copies are somewhat rare. \"New Dark Ages\" (Taylor) was released in Germany with another live version of \"Man on Fire\", whilst \"Life Changes\" was released with the B-side \"Heartland\". It was however immediately withdrawn due to Mercury's death. The tour was in support of [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]], so the concert lengths were short (45 mins.) and very few bootlegs have survived. The tour pace was rapid, covering 20 dates in one month.\n\n=== Break-up of the Cross ===\nThe band broke up in 1993 after performing a final show. Taylor continued working with Queen and produced solo albums. Drummer Macrae accompanied Taylor on his solo tours and also played percussion at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Both Taylor and keyboardist Edney participated in the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] tours, while Macrae worked behind the scenes as co-producer, sound engineer and Pro Tools engineer for them. In the late 1990s, Edney formed the SAS Band (\"Spike's All Stars\"), a group with an ever-changing line-up of popular '80s musicians.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nTaylor has appeared along with May for various other events and promotions, including Queen's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/queen |title=Queen: inducted in 2001 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> and the \"[[Party at the Palace]]\" in 2002, celebrating the golden jubilee of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenvault.com/patp.html |title=Party at the Palace |publisher=QueenVault.com |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> In 2004, Taylor, May, and Mike Dixon received the [[Helpmann Award]] for Best Music Direction for the musical [[We Will Rock You (musical)|''We Will Rock You'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helpmannawards.com.au/2004/past-nominees-and-winners/industry-awards|title=Past nominees and winners Helpmann Awards|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref>  At [[Live Earth]] in 2007, Taylor opened the concert with [[Taylor Hawkins]] of [[Foo Fighters]] and [[Chad Smith]] of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].\n\nTaylor and May, performing as Queen, also appeared three times on the American singing contest television show ''[[American Idol]]''. The first appearance was on 11 April 2006, during which that week's contestants were required to sing a Queen song. Songs performed included \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\", and \"[[Innuendo (song)|Innuendo]]\". The second time Queen appeared was on the show's [[American Idol (season 8)|season 8]] finale in May 2009, performing \"We Are the Champions\" with finalists [[Adam Lambert]] and [[Kris Allen]].

Like the platypus, they are equipped with [[Electroreception|electrosensors]], but while the platypus has 40,000 electroreceptors on its bill, the long-beaked echidna has only 2,000 electroreceptors, and the short-beaked echidna, which lives in a drier environment, has no more than 400 located at the tip of its snout.<ref name=MOL100707/> They have very short, strong [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s with large [[claw]]s, and are powerful diggers. Their claws on their hind limbs are elongated and curved backwards to help aid in digging. Echidnas have tiny [[mouth]]s and toothless [[jaw]]s. The echidna feeds by tearing open soft logs, [[anthill]]s and the like, and using its long, sticky [[tongue]], which protrudes from its snout, to collect prey. The ears are slits on the sides of their heads that are usually unseen, as they are blanketed by their spines. The [[pinna (anatomy)|external ear]] is created by a large cartilaginous funnel, deep in the muscle.<ref name=CSIRO06/> At 33&nbsp;\u00b0C, the echidna also possess the second lowest active body temperature of all mammals, behind the platypus.\n\n==Diet==\nThe [[short-beaked echidna]]'s diet consists largely of ants and termites, while the ''Zaglossus'' (long-beaked) species typically eat worms and insect larvae.<ref name=info/>\nThe tongues of [[long-beaked echidna]]s have sharp, tiny spines that help them capture their prey.<ref name=info/> They have no teeth, and break down their food by grinding it between the bottoms of their mouths and their tongues.<ref name = \"NSW\">{{cite web|last=Carritt|first=Rachel|title=Echidnas: Helping them in the wild|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/nature/Factsheet3Echidnas.pdf|publisher=NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service|accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> Echidnas' [[faeces]] are {{convert|7|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} long and are cylindrical in shape; they are usually broken and unrounded, and composed largely of dirt and ant-hill material.<ref name=\"NSW\"/>\n\n==Habitat==\n[[File:French Island Echidna.ogg|thumb|A short-beaked echidna building a defensive burrow in [[French Island National Park]] (43 seconds)]]\nEchidnas do not tolerate extreme temperatures; they use caves and rock crevices to shelter from harsh weather conditions.

When they feel endangered they attempt to bury themselves or if exposed they will curl into a ball similar to that of a [[hedgehog]], both methods using their spines to shield them. Strong front arms allow echidnas to continue to dig themselves in whilst holding fast against a predator attempting to remove them from the hole. Although they have a way to protect themselves, the echidnas still face many dangers. Some predators include [[Cats in Australia|feral cats]], [[Fox|foxes,]] domestic dogs and [[goanna]]s. Snakes pose a large threat to the echidna species because they slither into their burrows and prey on the young spineless puggles. Some precautions that can be taken include keeping the environment clean by picking up litter and causing less pollution, planting vegetation for echidnas to use as shelter, supervising pets, reporting hurt echidnas or just leaving them undisturbed. Merely grabbing them may cause stress, and picking them up improperly may even result in injury.<ref name=\"NSW\"/>\n\n==Evolution==\n[[File:Echidna skeleton.jpg|thumb|Short-beaked echidna skeleton]]\nThe first divergence between oviparous (egg-laying) and viviparous (offspring develop internally) mammals is believed to have occurred during the Triassic period.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rowe T, Rich TH, Vickers-Rich P, Springer M, Woodburne MO |title=The oldest platypus and its bearing on divergence timing of the platypus and echidna clades |journal=Proc.

Further evidence of possible water-foraging ancestors can be found in some of the echidna's phenotypic traits as well. These traits include [[hydrodynamic]] streamlining, dorsally projecting hind limbs acting as rudders, and locomotion founded on hypertrophied humeral long-axis rotation, which provides a very efficient swimming stroke.<ref name=Phillips/> Consequently, [[oviparous]] reproduction in monotremes may have given them an advantage over [[marsupials]], a view consistent with present ecological partitioning between the two groups.<ref name=Phillips/> This advantage could as well be in part responsible for the observed associated adaptive radiation of echidnas and expansion of the niche space, which together contradict the fairly common assumption of halted morphological and molecular evolution that continues to be associated with monotremes. Furthermore, studies of mitochondrial DNA in platypuses have also found that monotremes and marsupials are most likely sister taxa. It also implies that any shared derived morphological traits between marsupials and placental mammals either occurred independently from one another or were lost in the lineage to monotremes.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Janke A, Xu X, Arnason U |title=The complete mitochondrial genome of the wallaroo (''Macropus robustus'') and the phylogenetic relationship among Monotremata, Marsupialia, and Eutheria |journal=Proc.

Therefore, no one has ever seen an echidna ejaculate. There have been previous attempts, trying to force the echidna to ejaculate through the use of [[electroejaculation|electrically stimulated ejaculation]] in order to [[semen collection|obtain semen samples]] but has only resulted in the penis swelling.<ref name=nsc071026/>\n<section end=ejaculation />\nBreeding season begins in late June and extends through September. Males will form lines up to ten individuals long, the youngest echidna trailing last, that follow the female and attempt to mate. During a mating season an echidna may switch between lines. This is known as the \"train\" system.<ref name=\"NSW\"/>\n\n==Threats==\nEchidnas are very timid animals. When they feel endangered they attempt to bury themselves or if exposed they will curl into a ball similar to that of a [[hedgehog]], both methods using their spines to shield them. Strong front arms allow echidnas to continue to dig themselves in whilst holding fast against a predator attempting to remove them from the hole. Although they have a way to protect themselves, the echidnas still face many dangers. Some predators include [[Cats in Australia|feral cats]], [[Fox|foxes,]] domestic dogs and [[goanna]]s. Snakes pose a large threat to the echidna species because they slither into their burrows and prey on the young spineless puggles. Some precautions that can be taken include keeping the environment clean by picking up litter and causing less pollution, planting vegetation for echidnas to use as shelter, supervising pets, reporting hurt echidnas or just leaving them undisturbed. Merely grabbing them may cause stress, and picking them up improperly may even result in injury.<ref name=\"NSW\"/>\n\n==Evolution==\n[[File:Echidna skeleton.jpg|thumb|Short-beaked echidna skeleton]]\nThe first divergence between oviparous (egg-laying) and viviparous (offspring develop internally) mammals is believed to have occurred during the Triassic period.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rowe T, Rich TH, Vickers-Rich P, Springer M, Woodburne MO |title=The oldest platypus and its bearing on divergence timing of the platypus and echidna clades |journal=Proc.

Though most findings from genetics studies (especially those concerning nuclear genes) are in agreement with the paleontological findings, some results from other techniques and sources, like mitochondrial DNA, are in slight disagreement with findings from fossils.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Musser AM |title=Review of the monotreme fossil record and comparison of palaeontological and molecular data |journal=Comp.

Further evidence of possible water-foraging ancestors can be found in some of the echidna's phenotypic traits as well. These traits include [[hydrodynamic]] streamlining, dorsally projecting hind limbs acting as rudders, and locomotion founded on hypertrophied humeral long-axis rotation, which provides a very efficient swimming stroke.<ref name=Phillips/> Consequently, [[oviparous]] reproduction in monotremes may have given them an advantage over [[marsupials]], a view consistent with present ecological partitioning between the two groups.<ref name=Phillips/> This advantage could as well be in part responsible for the observed associated adaptive radiation of echidnas and expansion of the niche space, which together contradict the fairly common assumption of halted morphological and molecular evolution that continues to be associated with monotremes. Furthermore, studies of mitochondrial DNA in platypuses have also found that monotremes and marsupials are most likely sister taxa. It also implies that any shared derived morphological traits between marsupials and placental mammals either occurred independently from one another or were lost in the lineage to monotremes.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Janke A, Xu X, Arnason U |title=The complete mitochondrial genome of the wallaroo (''Macropus robustus'') and the phylogenetic relationship among Monotremata, Marsupialia, and Eutheria |journal=Proc.
