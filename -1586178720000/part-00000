{"title_page": "List of 21st-century Canadian tornadoes and tornado outbreaks", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\nThis is a list of notable [[tornado]]es, [[tornado outbreak]]s, and [[tornado outbreak sequence]]s that have occurred in [[Canada]] in the 21st century. (2001 through 2100). Due to increasing detection, particularly in the US and southern Canada, numbers of counted tornadoes have increased markedly in recent decades although number of actual tornadoes and counted significant tornadoes has not. In older events, the number of tornadoes officially counted is likely underestimated.\n\nOn average, there are around 80 confirmed and unconfirmed tornadoes that touch down in Canada each year, with most occurring in [[Southern Ontario]], the southern [[Canadian Prairies]] and southern [[Quebec]]. Canada ranks as the second country in the world with the most tornadoes per year, after the US. The most common types are F0 to F2 in damage intensity level and usually result in minor structural damage to barns, wood fences, [[roof shingle]]s, chimneys, uprooted or snapped tree limbs and downed power lines. Fewer than 5% of tornadoes in Canada are rated F3 or higher in intensity, where wind speeds are in excess of {{convert|225|km/h|abbr=on}}. Prior to April 1, 2013, Canada used a slightly modified [[Fujita scale]], and as of that date the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]], again slightly modified, was put into use to rate tornado intensity, based on the damage to buildings and vegetation.<ref name=\"ehfs\">{{Cite web |url=https://ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=41E875DA-1 |title=Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF-Scale) |access-date=2017-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407223004/http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=41E875DA-1 |archive-date=2017-04-07 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Ontario]], [[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]] all average 15 tornadoes per season, followed by Quebec with fewer than 10. [[New Brunswick]] and the [[British Columbia Interior]] are also recognized tornado zones. All other [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] have significantly less threat from tornadoes. The peak season in Canada is in the summer months when clashing air masses move north, as opposed to the spring season in the United States southern-central plains, although tornadoes in Canada have occurred in spring, fall and very rarely winter.\n\nThe reported increase in numbers of tornadoes in recent years may reflect more reporting by citizens and media involvement rather than an actual increase in tornado occurrence (although some natural increase has not been ruled out), in addition to better detection technology i.e. [[Pulse-Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[weather radar]] and [[satellite imagery]]. The upswing could also be attributed to other factors, such as improved aerial and ground damage assessment after the fact in sparsely populated areas (particularly the case in remote parts of the Canadian Prairies and [[Northern Ontario]], for example), better trained spotter capabilities and increased use of digital recording devices by citizens. Tornadoes in Canada are enough of a threat for a [[Emergency population warning|public warning system]] to be in place, overseen by the national weather agency, [[Environment and Climate Change Canada|Environment Canada]] (EC).\n\nFor a variety of reasons, such as Canada's lower population density and generally stronger housing construction due to the colder climate, Canadian tornadoes have historically caused far fewer fatalities than tornadoes in the United States. The deadliest tornado in Canadian history, the [[Regina Cyclone]] of June 30, 1912, does not even rank in the top 25 when compared to American tornado fatalities. Urban centres are not immune from the threat of severe tornadoes. Ten medium to large size Canadian cities have been hit by significant strength tornadoes (F3/EF3 or higher), which caused large-scale damage and fatalities: [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] (1912); [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] (1946 and 1974); [[Sarnia]] (1953); [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] (1970); [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]] (1979); [[London, Ontario|London]] (1984); [[Barrie]] (1985); [[Edmonton]] (1987); [[Goderich, Ontario|Goderich]] (2011); and [[National Capital Region (Canada)|Ottawa-Gatineau]] (2018).\n\nAll figures for damages are in [[Canadian dollar]]s.\n\n{{Dynamic list}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==2000s==\n\n===2001===\n*June 8 \u2013 an F0 tornado was confirmed near Upper Manitou Lake, about {{convert|45|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Dryden, Ontario]], causing extensive tree damage.<ref name=Ont2001>[http://www.ontarioweather.com/specials/database/TornadoQuery.asp The Ontario Weather Page \u2013 2001 Tornado Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020402082919/http://www.ontarioweather.com/specials/database/TornadoQuery.asp |date=2002-04-02 }}</ref>\n*June 19 \u2013 two tornadoes touched down in the [[Saguenay\u2013Lac-Saint-Jean]] region of [[Quebec]].

(2001 through 2100). Due to increasing detection, particularly in the US and southern Canada, numbers of counted tornadoes have increased markedly in recent decades although number of actual tornadoes and counted significant tornadoes has not. In older events, the number of tornadoes officially counted is likely underestimated.\n\nOn average, there are around 80 confirmed and unconfirmed tornadoes that touch down in Canada each year, with most occurring in [[Southern Ontario]], the southern [[Canadian Prairies]] and southern [[Quebec]]. Canada ranks as the second country in the world with the most tornadoes per year, after the US. The most common types are F0 to F2 in damage intensity level and usually result in minor structural damage to barns, wood fences, [[roof shingle]]s, chimneys, uprooted or snapped tree limbs and downed power lines. Fewer than 5% of tornadoes in Canada are rated F3 or higher in intensity, where wind speeds are in excess of {{convert|225|km/h|abbr=on}}. Prior to April 1, 2013, Canada used a slightly modified [[Fujita scale]], and as of that date the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]], again slightly modified, was put into use to rate tornado intensity, based on the damage to buildings and vegetation.<ref name=\"ehfs\">{{Cite web |url=https://ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=41E875DA-1 |title=Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF-Scale) |access-date=2017-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407223004/http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=41E875DA-1 |archive-date=2017-04-07 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Ontario]], [[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]] all average 15 tornadoes per season, followed by Quebec with fewer than 10. [[New Brunswick]] and the [[British Columbia Interior]] are also recognized tornado zones. All other [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] have significantly less threat from tornadoes. The peak season in Canada is in the summer months when clashing air masses move north, as opposed to the spring season in the United States southern-central plains, although tornadoes in Canada have occurred in spring, fall and very rarely winter.\n\nThe reported increase in numbers of tornadoes in recent years may reflect more reporting by citizens and media involvement rather than an actual increase in tornado occurrence (although some natural increase has not been ruled out), in addition to better detection technology i.e. [[Pulse-Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[weather radar]] and [[satellite imagery]]. The upswing could also be attributed to other factors, such as improved aerial and ground damage assessment after the fact in sparsely populated areas (particularly the case in remote parts of the Canadian Prairies and [[Northern Ontario]], for example), better trained spotter capabilities and increased use of digital recording devices by citizens. Tornadoes in Canada are enough of a threat for a [[Emergency population warning|public warning system]] to be in place, overseen by the national weather agency, [[Environment and Climate Change Canada|Environment Canada]] (EC).\n\nFor a variety of reasons, such as Canada's lower population density and generally stronger housing construction due to the colder climate, Canadian tornadoes have historically caused far fewer fatalities than tornadoes in the United States. The deadliest tornado in Canadian history, the [[Regina Cyclone]] of June 30, 1912, does not even rank in the top 25 when compared to American tornado fatalities. Urban centres are not immune from the threat of severe tornadoes. Ten medium to large size Canadian cities have been hit by significant strength tornadoes (F3/EF3 or higher), which caused large-scale damage and fatalities: [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] (1912); [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] (1946 and 1974); [[Sarnia]] (1953); [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] (1970); [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]] (1979); [[London, Ontario|London]] (1984); [[Barrie]] (1985); [[Edmonton]] (1987); [[Goderich, Ontario|Goderich]] (2011); and [[National Capital Region (Canada)|Ottawa-Gatineau]] (2018).\n\nAll figures for damages are in [[Canadian dollar]]s.\n\n{{Dynamic list}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==2000s==\n\n===2001===\n*June 8 \u2013 an F0 tornado was confirmed near Upper Manitou Lake, about {{convert|45|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Dryden, Ontario]], causing extensive tree damage.<ref name=Ont2001>[http://www.ontarioweather.com/specials/database/TornadoQuery.asp The Ontario Weather Page \u2013 2001 Tornado Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020402082919/http://www.ontarioweather.com/specials/database/TornadoQuery.asp |date=2002-04-02 }}</ref>\n*June 19 \u2013 two tornadoes touched down in the [[Saguenay\u2013Lac-Saint-Jean]] region of [[Quebec]].
