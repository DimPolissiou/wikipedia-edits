Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 88 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 88 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.

In the process called [[Han unification]], the common (shared) characters were identified and named '''CJK Unified Ideographs'''. As of Unicode 13.0, Unicode defines a total of 92,856 CJK Unified Ideographs.<ref name=\"PropList\">{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/PropList.txt|title=Unicode 13.0 UCD: PropList.txt|date=2019-11-27|accessdate=2020-03-15}}</ref>\n\nThe terms ''ideographs'' or ''ideograms'' may be misleading, since the Chinese script is not strictly a [[pictogram|pictographic]] or [[ideogram|ideographic]] system.\n\nHistorically, Vietnam used Chinese ideographs too, so sometimes the abbreviation \"CJKV\" is used. This system was replaced by the Latin-based [[Vietnamese alphabet]] in the 1920s.\n\n==CJK Unified Ideographs blocks==\n\n===CJK Unified Ideographs===\nThe basic block named ''[[CJK Unified Ideographs (Unicode block)|CJK Unified Ideographs]]'' (4E00\u20139FFF) contains 20,989 basic [[Chinese characters]] in the range U+4E00 through U+9FFC. The block not only includes characters used in the [[Written Chinese|Chinese writing system]] but also [[kanji]] used in the [[Japanese writing system]] and [[hanja]], whose use is diminishing in [[Korean mixed script|Korea]]. Many characters in this block are used in all three [[writing system]]s, while others are in only one or two of the three. Chinese characters are also used in Vietnam's [[Han-Nom|N\u00f4m]] script (now obsolete). The first 20,902 characters in the block are arranged according to the [[Kangxi Dictionary]] ordering of [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]]s. In this system the characters written with the fewest strokes are listed first. The remaining characters were added later, and so are not in radical order.\n\nThe block is the result of [[Han unification]],<ref>[https://unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/appA.pdf The Unicode Standard 4.0, Appendix A - Han Unification History]</ref> which was somewhat controversial in the Far East.<ref>Suzanne Topping, \"[http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/u-secret.html The secret life of Unicode]\"</ref> Since Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters were coded in the same location, the appearance of a selected glyph could depend on the particular font being used.

Such ideographs are indicated by a source prefix of \"UCI\" instead of \"UTC\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr45/|title=UAX #45: U-source Ideographs|publisher=Unicode Consortium|first=John H.|last=Jenkins|date=2020-02-13}}</ref>\n\nThe UTC sources consist of the following:\n\n* ''[[ABC Chinese-English Dictionary]]'' by [[John DeFrancis]]\n* The Adobe-CNS1 glyph collection\n* The Adobe-Japan1 glyph collection\n* A Complete Checklist of Species and Subspecies of Chinese Birds (\u4e2d\u56fd\u9e1f\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u68c0\u7d22)\n* The Great Nom Dictionary (\u0110\u1ea1i T\u1ef1 \u0110i\u1ec3n Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m)\n* Annotations to ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' (annotated by [[Duan Yucai]])\n* GB18030-2000\n* Required Character List Supplied by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Hong Kong)\n* New Commercial Dictionary (\u5546\u52a1\u65b0\u8bcd\u5178), Hong Kong\n* Defect reports filed against the Unicode Standard or other direct communication with the Unicode editorial committee\n* Unicode Technical Committee (UTC) documents\n* Modern Chinese Dictionary (\u73b0\u4ee3\u6c49\u8bed\u8bcd\u5178), by [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], Linguistics Research Institute, Dictionary Editorial Office\n* Working Group (WG2) documents\n* Wenlin (\u6587\u6797) http://www.wenlin.com/\n\n==Known issues==\n\n=== Disunification ===\n==== U+4039 ====\nThe character U+4039 (\u4039) was a unification of two different characters (one with ji\u0101 \u593e phonetic and one with sh\u01cen \u3692 phonetic) until Unicode 5.0. However, they were lexically different characters that should not have been unified; they have different pronunciations and different meanings.\n\nThe proposal of disunification of U+4039<ref>[[Andrew West (linguist)|Andrew West]] and John Jenkins, [http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3196.pdf proposal of disunification of U+4039]</ref> was accepted and the new character is encoded at U+9FC3 (\u9fc3) in Unicode 5.1.\n\n==== Other 3 glyphs in Extension B ====\nIn CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B, some characters are incorrectly unified with others. These characters include U+2017B (\ud840\udd7b), U+204AF (\ud841\udcaf) and U+24CB2 (\ud853\udcb2). The first two characters contained a wrong unification of Chinese Mainland and Vietnamese source of their glyph, while the last one unifies the Chinese Mainland and Taiwanese ones.<ref>Eiso Chan (\u9648\u6c38\u806a), Comments on four error glyphs on CJK Unified Ideographs Ext B & E.[https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17049-four-cjk-comments.pdf]</ref>\n\n===Unifiable variants and exact duplicates in Extension B===\nAlso in CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B, hundreds of glyph variants were encoded.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060515014033/http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~irg/irg/irg25/IRGN1155_Possible_Duplicates.pdf unifiable glyph variants]</ref> In addition to the deliberate encoding of close glyph variants, six exact duplicates (where the same character has inadvertently been encoded twice) and two semi-duplicates (where the CJK-B character represents a ''de facto'' disunification of two glyph forms unified in the corresponding BMP character) were encoded by mistake:<ref>{{Cite web | last=Cook | first=Richard | title=Defect Report on Duplicate Encoded CJK Forms | url=http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/wg2/docs/n2644.pdf | publisher=ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 | date=6 October 2003 | accessdate=2012-03-28 }}</ref>\n* U+34A8 \u34a8 = U+20457 \ud841\udc57 : U+20457 is the same as the China-source glyph for U+34A8, but it is significantly different from the Taiwan-source glyph for U+34A8\n* U+3DB7 \u3db7 = U+2420E \ud850\ude0e : same glyph shapes\n* U+8641 \u8641 = U+27144 \ud85c\udd44 : U+27144 is the same as the Korean-source glyph for U+8641, but it is significantly different from the Chinese Mainland-, Taiwan- and Japan-source glyphs for U+8641\n* U+204F2 \ud841\udcf2 = U+23515 \ud84d\udd15 : same glyph shapes, but ordered under different radicals\n* U+249BC \ud852\uddbc = U+249E9 \ud852\udde9 : same glyph shapes\n* U+24BD2 \ud852\udfd2 = U+2A415 \ud869\udc15 : same glyph shapes, but ordered under different radicals\n* U+26842 \ud85a\udc42 = U+26866 \ud85a\udc66 : same glyph shapes\n* U+FA23 \ufa23 = U+27EAF \ud85f\udeaf : same glyph shapes (U+FA23 \ufa23 is a unified CJK ideograph, despite its name \"CJK COMPATIBILITY IDEOGRAPH-FA23.\")\n\n==Other CJK Ideographs in Unicode, not Unified ==\nApart from the eight blocks of \"Unified Ideographs,\" Unicode has about a dozen more blocks with not-unified CJK-characters. These are mainly CJK radicals, strokes, punctuation, marks, symbols and compatibility characters. Although some characters have their (decomposable) counterparts in other blocks, the usages can be different.\n\nFour blocks of compatibility characters are included for compatibility with legacy text handling systems and older character sets:\n* [[CJK Compatibility]] (3300\u201333FF)\n* [[CJK Compatibility Forms]] (FE30\u2013FE4F)\n* [[CJK Compatibility Ideographs]] (F900\u2013FAFF)\n* [[CJK Compatibility Ideographs Supplement]] (2F800\u20132FA1F)\nThey include forms of characters for vertical text layout and rich text characters that Unicode recommends handling through other means. Therefore, their use is discouraged.\n\nUsually, compatibility characters are those that would not have been encoded except for compatibility and round-trip convertibility with other standards. However, the amount of CJK ideographs within any non-Unicode standard is too big to fit into Unicode's CJK Compatibility Ideographs blocks. Instead, code points are assigned when the affected characters are approved by the Unicode Consortium, but have yet to assign any code points within the CJK Unified Ideographs blocks.\n\n==Font support==\nThe blocks CJK Unified Ideographs and CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A, being parts of the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]], are supported by the majority of the [[List of CJK fonts|CJK fonts]]. However, Japanese and Korean fonts usually have less characters (about 13,000 and 8,000, respectively) than Chinese. Extensions B, C, D are supported by additional fonts MingLiU-ExtB, MingLiU_HKSCS-ExtB, PMingLiU-ExtB, SimSun-ExtB included in Microsoft Windows since Vista.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lunde|first=Ken|title=CJKV Information Processing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SA92uQqTB-AC&pg=PA633|year=2009|publisher=O'Reilly|isbn=978-0-596-51447-1|pages=633\u2013634}}</ref>\n\n==Unicode version history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ CJK unified Ideographs additions per Unicode version\n|-\n!

In the process called [[Han unification]], the common (shared) characters were identified and named '''CJK Unified Ideographs'''. As of Unicode 13.0, Unicode defines a total of 92,856 CJK Unified Ideographs.<ref name=\"PropList\">{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/PropList.txt|title=Unicode 13.0 UCD: PropList.txt|date=2019-11-27|accessdate=2020-03-15}}</ref>\n\nThe terms ''ideographs'' or ''ideograms'' may be misleading, since the Chinese script is not strictly a [[pictogram|pictographic]] or [[ideogram|ideographic]] system.\n\nHistorically, Vietnam used Chinese ideographs too, so sometimes the abbreviation \"CJKV\" is used. This system was replaced by the Latin-based [[Vietnamese alphabet]] in the 1920s.\n\n==CJK Unified Ideographs blocks==\n\n===CJK Unified Ideographs===\nThe basic block named ''[[CJK Unified Ideographs (Unicode block)|CJK Unified Ideographs]]'' (4E00\u20139FFF) contains 20,989 basic [[Chinese characters]] in the range U+4E00 through U+9FFC. The block not only includes characters used in the [[Written Chinese|Chinese writing system]] but also [[kanji]] used in the [[Japanese writing system]] and [[hanja]], whose use is diminishing in [[Korean mixed script|Korea]]. Many characters in this block are used in all three [[writing system]]s, while others are in only one or two of the three. Chinese characters are also used in Vietnam's [[Han-Nom|N\u00f4m]] script (now obsolete). The first 20,902 characters in the block are arranged according to the [[Kangxi Dictionary]] ordering of [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]]s. In this system the characters written with the fewest strokes are listed first. The remaining characters were added later, and so are not in radical order.\n\nThe block is the result of [[Han unification]],<ref>[https://unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/appA.pdf The Unicode Standard 4.0, Appendix A - Han Unification History]</ref> which was somewhat controversial in the Far East.<ref>Suzanne Topping, \"[http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/u-secret.html The secret life of Unicode]\"</ref> Since Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters were coded in the same location, the appearance of a selected glyph could depend on the particular font being used. However, the ''source separation rule'' states that characters encoded separately in an earlier character set would remain separate in the new Unicode encoding.<ref>\"[https://unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/ch11.pdf Chapter 11 - East Asian scripts]\", ''The Unicode standard, 4.0''.</ref>\n\nUsing [[Unicode control characters#Variation selectors|variation selectors]], it is possible to specify certain variant CJK ideograms within Unicode.

Such ideographs are indicated by a source prefix of \"UCI\" instead of \"UTC\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr45/|title=UAX #45: U-source Ideographs|publisher=Unicode Consortium|first=John H.|last=Jenkins|date=2020-02-13}}</ref>\n\nThe UTC sources consist of the following:\n\n* ''[[ABC Chinese-English Dictionary]]'' by [[John DeFrancis]]\n* The Adobe-CNS1 glyph collection\n* The Adobe-Japan1 glyph collection\n* A Complete Checklist of Species and Subspecies of Chinese Birds (\u4e2d\u56fd\u9e1f\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u68c0\u7d22)\n* The Great Nom Dictionary (\u0110\u1ea1i T\u1ef1 \u0110i\u1ec3n Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m)\n* Annotations to ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' (annotated by [[Duan Yucai]])\n* GB18030-2000\n* Required Character List Supplied by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Hong Kong)\n* New Commercial Dictionary (\u5546\u52a1\u65b0\u8bcd\u5178), Hong Kong\n* Defect reports filed against the Unicode Standard or other direct communication with the Unicode editorial committee\n* Unicode Technical Committee (UTC) documents\n* Modern Chinese Dictionary (\u73b0\u4ee3\u6c49\u8bed\u8bcd\u5178), by [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], Linguistics Research Institute, Dictionary Editorial Office\n* Working Group (WG2) documents\n* Wenlin (\u6587\u6797) http://www.wenlin.com/\n\n==Known issues==\n\n=== Disunification ===\n==== U+4039 ====\nThe character U+4039 (\u4039) was a unification of two different characters (one with ji\u0101 \u593e phonetic and one with sh\u01cen \u3692 phonetic) until Unicode 5.0. However, they were lexically different characters that should not have been unified; they have different pronunciations and different meanings.\n\nThe proposal of disunification of U+4039<ref>[[Andrew West (linguist)|Andrew West]] and John Jenkins, [http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3196.pdf proposal of disunification of U+4039]</ref> was accepted and the new character is encoded at U+9FC3 (\u9fc3) in Unicode 5.1.\n\n==== Other 3 glyphs in Extension B ====\nIn CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B, some characters are incorrectly unified with others. These characters include U+2017B (\ud840\udd7b), U+204AF (\ud841\udcaf) and U+24CB2 (\ud853\udcb2). The first two characters contained a wrong unification of Chinese Mainland and Vietnamese source of their glyph, while the last one unifies the Chinese Mainland and Taiwanese ones.<ref>Eiso Chan (\u9648\u6c38\u806a), Comments on four error glyphs on CJK Unified Ideographs Ext B & E.[https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17049-four-cjk-comments.pdf]</ref>\n\n===Unifiable variants and exact duplicates in Extension B===\nAlso in CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B, hundreds of glyph variants were encoded.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060515014033/http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~irg/irg/irg25/IRGN1155_Possible_Duplicates.pdf unifiable glyph variants]</ref> In addition to the deliberate encoding of close glyph variants, six exact duplicates (where the same character has inadvertently been encoded twice) and two semi-duplicates (where the CJK-B character represents a ''de facto'' disunification of two glyph forms unified in the corresponding BMP character) were encoded by mistake:<ref>{{Cite web | last=Cook | first=Richard | title=Defect Report on Duplicate Encoded CJK Forms | url=http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/wg2/docs/n2644.pdf | publisher=ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 | date=6 October 2003 | accessdate=2012-03-28 }}</ref>\n* U+34A8 \u34a8 = U+20457 \ud841\udc57 : U+20457 is the same as the China-source glyph for U+34A8, but it is significantly different from the Taiwan-source glyph for U+34A8\n* U+3DB7 \u3db7 = U+2420E \ud850\ude0e : same glyph shapes\n* U+8641 \u8641 = U+27144 \ud85c\udd44 : U+27144 is the same as the Korean-source glyph for U+8641, but it is significantly different from the Chinese Mainland-, Taiwan- and Japan-source glyphs for U+8641\n* U+204F2 \ud841\udcf2 = U+23515 \ud84d\udd15 : same glyph shapes, but ordered under different radicals\n* U+249BC \ud852\uddbc = U+249E9 \ud852\udde9 : same glyph shapes\n* U+24BD2 \ud852\udfd2 = U+2A415 \ud869\udc15 : same glyph shapes, but ordered under different radicals\n* U+26842 \ud85a\udc42 = U+26866 \ud85a\udc66 : same glyph shapes\n* U+FA23 \ufa23 = U+27EAF \ud85f\udeaf : same glyph shapes (U+FA23 \ufa23 is a unified CJK ideograph, despite its name \"CJK COMPATIBILITY IDEOGRAPH-FA23.\")\n\n==Other CJK Ideographs in Unicode, not Unified ==\nApart from the eight blocks of \"Unified Ideographs,\" Unicode has about a dozen more blocks with not-unified CJK-characters. These are mainly CJK radicals, strokes, punctuation, marks, symbols and compatibility characters. Although some characters have their (decomposable) counterparts in other blocks, the usages can be different.\n\nFour blocks of compatibility characters are included for compatibility with legacy text handling systems and older character sets:\n* [[CJK Compatibility]] (3300\u201333FF)\n* [[CJK Compatibility Forms]] (FE30\u2013FE4F)\n* [[CJK Compatibility Ideographs]] (F900\u2013FAFF)\n* [[CJK Compatibility Ideographs Supplement]] (2F800\u20132FA1F)\nThey include forms of characters for vertical text layout and rich text characters that Unicode recommends handling through other means. Therefore, their use is discouraged.\n\nUsually, compatibility characters are those that would not have been encoded except for compatibility and round-trip convertibility with other standards. However, the amount of CJK ideographs within any non-Unicode standard is too big to fit into Unicode's CJK Compatibility Ideographs blocks. Instead, code points are assigned when the affected characters are approved by the Unicode Consortium, but have yet to assign any code points within the CJK Unified Ideographs blocks.\n\n==Font support==\nThe blocks CJK Unified Ideographs and CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A, being parts of the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]], are supported by the majority of the [[List of CJK fonts|CJK fonts]]. However, Japanese and Korean fonts usually have less characters (about 13,000 and 8,000, respectively) than Chinese. Extensions B, C, D are supported by additional fonts MingLiU-ExtB, MingLiU_HKSCS-ExtB, PMingLiU-ExtB, SimSun-ExtB included in Microsoft Windows since Vista.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lunde|first=Ken|title=CJKV Information Processing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SA92uQqTB-AC&pg=PA633|year=2009|publisher=O'Reilly|isbn=978-0-596-51447-1|pages=633\u2013634}}</ref>\n\n==Unicode version history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ CJK unified Ideographs additions per Unicode version\n|-\n!

It succeeds the [[Loglan]] project.\n\nThe Logical Language Group (LLG) began developing Lojban in 1987. The LLG sought to realize [[Loglan]]'s purposes, and further improve the language by making it more usable and freely available (as indicated by its official full English title, \"Lojban: A Realization of Loglan\"). After a long initial period of debating and testing, the baseline was completed in 1997, and published as ''The Complete Lojban Language''. In an interview in 2010 with ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Arika Okrent]], the author of ''In the Land of Invented Languages'', stated: \"The constructed language with the most complete grammar is probably Lojban\u2014a language created to reflect the principles of logic.\"<ref>{{cite news |date=March 10, 2010 |url=http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/questions-answered-invented-languages/ |title=Questions Answered: Invented Languages |publisher=The New York Times Schott's Vocab blog}}</ref>\n\nLojban is proposed as a speakable language for communication between people of different language backgrounds, as a potential means of machine translation and to explore the intersection of human language and software.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Learning/en|title=Welcome!/en - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"{{lang|jbo|Lojban}}\" is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] formed from {{lang|jbo|loj}} and {{lang|jbo|ban}}, which are short forms of {{lang|jbo|logji}} (logic) and {{lang|jbo|bangu}} (language).\n\n== History ==\nLojban's predecessor, [[Loglan]], a language invented by [[James Cooke Brown]] in 1955 and later developed by The Loglan Institute, Loglan was originally conceived as a means to examine the influence of language on the speaker's thought (an assumption known as the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis]]).\n\nAs Brown started to claim his [[copyright]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arj.nvg.org/lojban/why-i-like.html|title=Why I like Lojban|work=nvg.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ainewsletter.com/newsletters/aix_0503.htm#loglan|title=AI Newsletter|work=ainewsletter.com|access-date=2012-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223111830/http://www.ainewsletter.com/newsletters/aix_0503.htm#loglan|archive-date=2011-12-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> on the language's components, bans were put on the community's activity to stop them changing aspects of the language. In order to circumvent such control, a group of people decided to initiate a separate project, departing from the lexical basis of Loglan and reinventing the whole vocabulary, which led to the current lexicon of Lojban. In effect they established in 1987 The Logical Language Group, based in [[Washington, D.C.]] They also won a trial over whether they could call their version of the language \"Loglan\".<ref>Johansen, Arnt Richard.

This might lead to freer expression and consideration of ideas, since stating an idea can be distinguished from supporting that idea.

Some of them have, apart from the preferred/standard sounds, permitted variants intended to cover dissimilitude in pronunciation by speakers of different linguistic backgrounds.\n\nStress normally falls on the penultimate syllable.\n\nThere are 16 [[diphthong]]s (and no [[triphthong]]s). A distinction between diphthongs and monophthongs can be written by inserting a comma in the Latin alphabet. Vowel hiatus is also prevented by inserting an apostrophe, which usually indicates {{IPA|[h]}}, though there are other valid realizations. For those who have trouble pronouncing certain [[consonant cluster]]s, there is the option of adding vowels between them ([[epenthesis]]), as long as they differ sufficiently from the phonological vowels and are pronounced as short as possible. The resulting additional syllables are not factored in the grammar, including for the purposes of stress determination.\n\nLojban is written almost entirely with lower-case letters; upper-case letters are used to mark stress in words that do not fit the normal rules of stress assignment, or when whitespace is omitted.\n\nThe letters in Lojban and their respective pronunciations are shown in the table below. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbols in parentheses indicate alternative pronunciations; preferred pronunciations have no parentheses.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Lojban consonant phonemes\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n!

Some of the reasons for such elasticity would be as follows:\n# Lojban is defined by the [[phoneme]]s rather than graphemes; as long as they are correctly rendered so as to maintain the Lojbanic audio-visual [[isomorphism]], a representational system can be said to be an appropriate orthography of the language;\n# Lojban is meant to be as culturally neutral as possible, so it is never crucial or fundamental to claim that some particular orthography of some particular languages (e.g. the Latin alphabet) should be the dominant mode.\n\nSome Lojbanists extend this principle to claim that even an original orthography of the language is to be sought.<ref>Kena.

Each of them has uniquely identifying properties, so that one can unambiguously recognize which word is of which part of speech in a string of the language. They may be further divided in sub-classes. There also exists a special fragmental form assigned to some predicate words and structure words, from which compound words ({{lang|jbo|lujvo}}) may be created.<ref>Cowan, John Woldemar.

[http://lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/morphol.html  ''What is Lojban?: 2.2''] (accessed August 2007)</ref>\n\n=== Syntax and semantics ===\nThe language's grammatical structures are \"defined by a set of rules that have been tested to be unambiguous using computers\", which is in effect called the \"machine grammar\".<ref>Nicholas, Nick. John Cowan. [http://lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/grammar.html ''What Is Lojban? II.3'']</ref> Hence the characteristics of the standard syntactic (not semantic) constructs in Lojban:\n* each word has exactly one grammatical interpretation;\n* the words relate grammatically to each other in exactly one way.\n\nSuch standards, however, are to be attained with certain carefulness:\n\n{{quotation\n|It is important to note that new Lojbanists will not be able to speak 'perfectly' when first learning Lojban. In fact, you may never speak perfectly in 'natural' Lojban conversation, even though you achieve fluency in the language. No English speaker always speaks textbook English in natural conversation; Lojban speakers will also make grammatical errors when talking quickly. Lojbanists will, however, be able to speak or write unambiguously if they are careful, which is difficult if not impossible with a natural language.<br /><br />Nick Nicholas and John Cowan. '[http://lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/grammar.html ''What Is Lojban? II.3'']}}\n\nThe computer-tested, unambiguous rules also include grammar for 'incomplete' sentences e.g. for narrative, quotational, or mathematical phrases.\n\nIts [[Linguistic typology|typology]] can be said to be basically [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] and [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]]. However, it can practically be anything:\n* {{lang|jbo|mi prami do}} (SVO) (I love you)\n* {{lang|jbo|mi do prami}} (SOV) (By me, you are loved)\n* {{lang|jbo|do se prami mi}} (OVS) (You are loved by me)\n* {{lang|jbo|do mi se prami}} (OSV) (You, I love)\n* {{lang|jbo|prami fa mi do}} (VSO) (Loved by me, you are)\n* {{lang|jbo|prami do fa mi}}, {{lang|jbo|se prami fa do mi}} (VOS) (Love you, I do)\n\nSuch flexibility has to do with the language's intended capability to translate as many expressions of natural languages as possible, based on a unique positional case system. The meaning of the sentence {{lang|jbo|mi prami do}} is determined by {{lang|jbo|prami}} realizing, with its own predefined \"place structure\", a specific semantic relation between {{lang|jbo|mi}} and {{lang|jbo|do}}; when the positional relation between {{lang|jbo|mi}} and {{lang|jbo|do}} changes, the meaning of the sentence changes too. As shown above, Lojban has particular devices to preserve such semantic structure of words while altering their order.\n\nAs befits a logical language, there is a large assortment of logical connectives. Such conjunction words take different forms depending on what they connect, another reason why the (standard) Lojbanic expressions are typically precise and clear.\n\nMultiple predicate words may be linked up together so as to narrow the semantic scope of the phrase. In {{lang|jbo|sutra dansu}} \"to quickly dance\", the modifying word {{lang|jbo|sutra}} narrows the sense of the modified word {{lang|jbo|dansu}} to form a more specific concept (in which case the modifier may resemble English adverbs or adjectives).\n<!--\n* '''English:''' ''Several small fires were burning in the house''.\n* '''Lojban:''' {{lang|jbo|so'i cmalu fagri puca'o jelca ne'i le zdani}}\n* '''[[Gloss (annotation)|Gloss]]:''' ''many small fire past-continuing burn inside the house'' (Translation after English)\n-->\nOne could go still further, adding a quite extreme example of its syntactic flexibility.\n\nLojban can easily \"imitate\" even one-word sentences from [[polysynthetic language]]s, for example:\n\n* '''[[Nuu-chah-nulth language]]''': ''inkiwihl'minik'isit''\n* '''[[Gloss (annotation)|Gloss]]''': ''inkiw (fire/burn) -ihl (in-the-house) -'minik (plural) -'is (diminutive) -'it (past-tense)''\n\nwhich can be expressed in Lojban the same way:\n\n* '''Lojban:''' {{lang|jbo|fagykemyzdanerso'icmapru}}\n* '''Gloss:''' ''fire-type-house-inside-many-small-past-event''\n\n===Lexicon===\nCompound words ({{lang|jbo|lujvo}}) and borrowed words ({{lang|jbo|fu'ivla}}) are continually increasing as the speakers find demands. The number of root words ({{lang|jbo|gismu}}) and structure words ({{lang|jbo|cmavo}}) are basically unchanging, but new inventions are to be accepted as experimental components. In fact, it has been noticed that particular inclination or disproportion exists in the available vocabulary. Cortesi<ref>Cortesi, David.

He is also a prominent figure on the mailing list, helping beginners with the language.\n* [[John W. Cowan]]<!-- (aka ''jcowan'')-->: the author of ''The Complete Lojban Language''.\n* Miles Forster (also known as {{lang|jbo|la selpa'i}}): a German Lojbanist who wrote the song ''ca pa djedi''<ref name=\"ca pa djedi\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZomVOBE5-0|title=Ca Pa Djedi (Original Song in Lojban by selpa'i)|work=YouTube}}</ref> and made several large translations into Lojban.\n* Robin Turner: a British philosopher and linguist living in Turkey, and coauthor of ''Lojban For Beginners''.\n* Nick Nicholas (also known as ''la nitcion''): an Australian linguist, and coauthor of ''Lojban For Beginners''.<!--* Matt Arnold (aka ''la epkat''): has been contributing to the [[translation project]] and software development.-->\n\n== Comparison with other logical languages ==\n\n=== Loglan ===\n{{Main article| Comparison between Lojban and Loglan}}\nThe principal difference between Lojban and Loglan is one of lexicon. The words for Lojban were made by the same principles as those for Loglan; that is, candidate forms were chosen according to how many sounds they had in common with their equivalent in some of the most commonly spoken languages on Earth, which was then multiplied by the number of speakers of the languages with which the words had letters in common. The difference with the Lojban remake of the root words was that the weighting was updated to reflect the actual numbers of speakers for the languages. This resulted in word forms that had fewer sounds taken from English, and more sounds taken from Chinese. For instance, the Loglan word ''norma'' is equivalent to the Lojban word {{lang|jbo|cnano}} (cf. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] \u5e38, [[pinyin]] ''ch\u00e1ng''), both meaning \"normal\".\n\nLoglan and Lojban still have essentially the same grammars, and most of what is said in the [[#Grammar|Grammar]] section above holds true for Loglan as well. Most simple, declarative sentences could be translated word by\nword between the two languages.\n\nIn the new phonology for Lojban, the consonant ''q'' and the vowel ''w'' were removed, and the consonant ''h'' was replaced by ''x''. The consonant ' ([[apostrophe]]) was added with the value of [h] in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], but its distribution is such that it can appear only [[intervocally]], and in discussions of the morphology and phonotactics, it is described not as a proper consonant, but a \"[[voiceless glide]]\". (This phoneme is realized as [\u03b8] by some speakers.)\n\n=== gua\\spi ===\n{{lang|mis|gua\\spi}} is a descendant of Loglan but is [[tonal language|tonal]], developed by Jim Carter. Instead of structure words there are in {{lang|mis|Gua\\spi}} six different tones. Predicates have only one syllable instead of two. Some of its characteristics, including tones, phonotactics, expressions for masses vs sets, non-existence of metalinguistic negation, etc., received criticism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/critique_of_gua%5Cspi|title=critique of gua\\spi|work=lojban.org}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Case grammar]]\n* [[FrameNet]]\n* [[Simplified Technical English]]\n* [[Ithkuil]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{InterWiki|code=jbo}}\n{{wikisource|The Complete Lojban Language}}\n{{sisterlinks|d=Q36350|n=no|v=no|voy=no|wikt=Lojban|mw=no|m=no|species=no|commons=Category:Lojban|q=no|s=no}}\n* {{Official website|https://www.lojban.org/}}\n* [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojban_Live_Chat Lojban chats]\n* [https://lojban.github.com/cll/ Reference grammar]\n* [https://la-lojban.github.io/sutysisku/en/ a searchable dictionary]\n** [https://la-lojban.github.io/sutysisku/ Also available in other languages]\n* [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Learning/en Learning materials]\n** [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/la_karda la karda: a distilled overview of the Lojban language]\n** [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojban_Wave_Lessons Wave Lessons, another popular textbook]\n** [http://www.memrise.com/courses/english/lojban/ Lojban courses for English speakers]\n** [http://www.lojban.org/publications/cll/cll_v1.1_2016-08-26.pdf Complete Lojban language]\n<!--*{{DMOZ|Science/Social_Sciences/Linguistics/Languages/Constructed/Logical/Lojban/}}-->\n{{Constructed languages}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Lojban| ]]\n[[Category:Constructed languages introduced in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:1987 introductions]]\n[[Category:Analytic languages]]\n[[Category:Engineered languages]]\n[[Category:Isolating languages]]\n[[Category:Constructed languages]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Constructed human language based on predicate logic}}\n{{Infobox language\n|name={{lang|jbo|Lojban}}\n|nativename={{lang|jbo|la .lojban.}}\n|pronunciation={{IPA-art|la\u0294\u02c8lo\u0292ban\u0294|}}\n|image=Lojban flag public domain.svg\n|imagesize=200px\n|creator=Logical Language Group\n|created=1987\n|setting=a logically engineered language for various usages\n|fam1=[[Constructed language]]s\n|fam2=[[engineered language]]s\n|fam3=[[engineered language#Logical languages|logical languages]]\n|script=[[Latin script|Latin]] and others\n|posteriori=[[Loglan]]\n|iso2=jbo\n|iso3=jbo\n|notice=IPA\n|glotto=lojb1234\n|glottorefname=Lojban\n}}\n\n'''Lojban''' (pronounced {{IPA-art|\u02c8lo\u0292ban||jbo-lojban.ogg}}) is a [[constructed language|constructed]], [[Syntactic ambiguity|syntactically unambiguous]] human language<!-- based on [[predicate logic]]--> created by the '''Logical Language Group.''' It succeeds the [[Loglan]] project.\n\nThe Logical Language Group (LLG) began developing Lojban in 1987. The LLG sought to realize [[Loglan]]'s purposes, and further improve the language by making it more usable and freely available (as indicated by its official full English title, \"Lojban: A Realization of Loglan\"). After a long initial period of debating and testing, the baseline was completed in 1997, and published as ''The Complete Lojban Language''. In an interview in 2010 with ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Arika Okrent]], the author of ''In the Land of Invented Languages'', stated: \"The constructed language with the most complete grammar is probably Lojban\u2014a language created to reflect the principles of logic.\"<ref>{{cite news |date=March 10, 2010 |url=http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/questions-answered-invented-languages/ |title=Questions Answered: Invented Languages |publisher=The New York Times Schott's Vocab blog}}</ref>\n\nLojban is proposed as a speakable language for communication between people of different language backgrounds, as a potential means of machine translation and to explore the intersection of human language and software.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Learning/en|title=Welcome!/en - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"{{lang|jbo|Lojban}}\" is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] formed from {{lang|jbo|loj}} and {{lang|jbo|ban}}, which are short forms of {{lang|jbo|logji}} (logic) and {{lang|jbo|bangu}} (language).\n\n== History ==\nLojban's predecessor, [[Loglan]], a language invented by [[James Cooke Brown]] in 1955 and later developed by The Loglan Institute, Loglan was originally conceived as a means to examine the influence of language on the speaker's thought (an assumption known as the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis]]).\n\nAs Brown started to claim his [[copyright]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arj.nvg.org/lojban/why-i-like.html|title=Why I like Lojban|work=nvg.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ainewsletter.com/newsletters/aix_0503.htm#loglan|title=AI Newsletter|work=ainewsletter.com|access-date=2012-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223111830/http://www.ainewsletter.com/newsletters/aix_0503.htm#loglan|archive-date=2011-12-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> on the language's components, bans were put on the community's activity to stop them changing aspects of the language. In order to circumvent such control, a group of people decided to initiate a separate project, departing from the lexical basis of Loglan and reinventing the whole vocabulary, which led to the current lexicon of Lojban. In effect they established in 1987 The Logical Language Group, based in [[Washington, D.C.]] They also won a trial over whether they could call their version of the language \"Loglan\".<ref>Johansen, Arnt Richard. [http://arj.nvg.org/lojban/why-i-like.html ''Why I like Lojban''] (accessed August 2007)</ref>\n<!--Lojban was developed to be a [[worldlang]].  -->\n\nThe phonetic form of Lojban {{lang|jbo|gismu}} (root words) was created algorithmically by searching for sound patterns in words with similar meanings in world languages and by multiplying those sound patterns by the number of speakers of those languages. The list of source languages used for the algorithm was limited to the six [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most widely spoken languages]] as of 1987\u2014[[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[English language|English]], [[Hindi]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Arabic]]. This resulted in root words being in their phonetic form a relatively equal mixture of English and Mandarin, with lesser influences from the other four.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lojban.github.io/cll/4/14/|title=The Shape Of Words To Come: Lojban Morphology - The Lojban Reference Grammar|website=lojban.github.io}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/me_lu_ju'i_lobypli_li'u_13_moi|title=me lu ju'i lobypli li'u 13 moi - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/me_lu_ju'i_lobypli_li'u_14_moi|title=me lu ju'i lobypli li'u 14 moi - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}</ref>\n\nLojban has also taken the set of evidential indicators from the constructed language [[L\u00e1adan]].<ref>Cowan, John. [https://lojban.github.io/cll/13/11/ The Complete Lojban Language 13.11]</ref>\n\nFollowing the publication of ''The Complete Lojban Language'', it was expected that \"the documented lexicon would be baselined, and the combination of lexicon and reference grammar would be frozen for a minimum of 5 years while language usage grew.\"<ref>[https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Official_Baseline_Statement_(2002/2003) ''Official Baseline Statement'']. lojban.org</ref> As scheduled, this period, which has officially been called the \"freeze\", expired in 2002. The speakers of Lojban are now free to construct new words and idioms, and decide where the language is heading.\n\n==Applications==\nWhile the initial aim of the Loglan project was to investigate [[linguistic relativity]], the active Lojban community recognizes additional applications for the language, including but not limited to:\n* Improved human\u2013human communication, due to the logical and unambiguous structure and greater means of expression (use as a speakable language)\n** Eliminating syntactic ambiguity in language\n* Use as an [[education|educational tool]]\n* Research in [[artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence and machine understanding]]\n** Improved human\u2013computer communication, [[ontology (information science)|storage ontologies]], and [[machine translation|computer translation of natural language text]]\n* Research in [[linguistics]]\n* Use as an academic language, such as in science or philosophy\n<!--* Official language of The United People of Earth (UPE)--><!--Note that these goals are not crucial to the Lojban community, most of whom simply want to enjoy communicating with each other in Lojban.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}-->\n\n===Lojban as a speakable language===\nLojban is practiced by its speakers in text<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lojban.org/resources/irclog/|title=Index of /resources/irclog|website=www.lojban.org}}</ref> and voice<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Recordings_of_live_Lojban_discussions|title=Recordings of live Lojban discussions - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}</ref> chats.\n\n==== Learning aids ====\nApart from the actual practice of the language, some members of the community and LLG have been endeavoring to create various aids for the learners. ''The Complete Lojban Language'' (''CLL'', also known as ''The Red Book'' because of its color, and ''The Codex Woldemar'', after its author), the definitive word on all aspects of Lojban, is one of them, finalized in 1997.

[...] Other areas of possible benefit are (surprisingly in a 'logical' language) emotional expression. Lojban has a fully developed set of metalinguistic and emotional attitude indicators that supplant much of the baggage of aspect and mood found in natural languages, but most clearly separate indicative statements from the emotional communication associated with those statements. This might lead to freer expression and consideration of ideas, since stating an idea can be distinguished from supporting that idea. The set of possible indicators is also large enough to provide specificity and clarity of emotions that is difficult in natural languages.}}\n\n[[John W.

Some of them have, apart from the preferred/standard sounds, permitted variants intended to cover dissimilitude in pronunciation by speakers of different linguistic backgrounds.\n\nStress normally falls on the penultimate syllable.\n\nThere are 16 [[diphthong]]s (and no [[triphthong]]s). A distinction between diphthongs and monophthongs can be written by inserting a comma in the Latin alphabet. Vowel hiatus is also prevented by inserting an apostrophe, which usually indicates {{IPA|[h]}}, though there are other valid realizations. For those who have trouble pronouncing certain [[consonant cluster]]s, there is the option of adding vowels between them ([[epenthesis]]), as long as they differ sufficiently from the phonological vowels and are pronounced as short as possible. The resulting additional syllables are not factored in the grammar, including for the purposes of stress determination.\n\nLojban is written almost entirely with lower-case letters; upper-case letters are used to mark stress in words that do not fit the normal rules of stress assignment, or when whitespace is omitted.\n\nThe letters in Lojban and their respective pronunciations are shown in the table below. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbols in parentheses indicate alternative pronunciations; preferred pronunciations have no parentheses.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Lojban consonant phonemes\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n!

Some of the reasons for such elasticity would be as follows:\n# Lojban is defined by the [[phoneme]]s rather than graphemes; as long as they are correctly rendered so as to maintain the Lojbanic audio-visual [[isomorphism]], a representational system can be said to be an appropriate orthography of the language;\n# Lojban is meant to be as culturally neutral as possible, so it is never crucial or fundamental to claim that some particular orthography of some particular languages (e.g. the Latin alphabet) should be the dominant mode.\n\nSome Lojbanists extend this principle to claim that even an original orthography of the language is to be sought.<ref>Kena.

Each of them has uniquely identifying properties, so that one can unambiguously recognize which word is of which part of speech in a string of the language. They may be further divided in sub-classes. There also exists a special fragmental form assigned to some predicate words and structure words, from which compound words ({{lang|jbo|lujvo}}) may be created.<ref>Cowan, John Woldemar. [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/the_Lojban_Reference_Grammar  ''The Complete Lojban Language: 4.1]'' (accessed August 2007)</ref><ref>Nicholas, Nick, and John Cowan. [http://lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/morphol.html  ''What is Lojban?: 2.2''] (accessed August 2007)</ref>\n\n=== Syntax and semantics ===\nThe language's grammatical structures are \"defined by a set of rules that have been tested to be unambiguous using computers\", which is in effect called the \"machine grammar\".<ref>Nicholas, Nick. John Cowan. [http://lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/grammar.html ''What Is Lojban? II.3'']</ref> Hence the characteristics of the standard syntactic (not semantic) constructs in Lojban:\n* each word has exactly one grammatical interpretation;\n* the words relate grammatically to each other in exactly one way.\n\nSuch standards, however, are to be attained with certain carefulness:\n\n{{quotation\n|It is important to note that new Lojbanists will not be able to speak 'perfectly' when first learning Lojban. In fact, you may never speak perfectly in 'natural' Lojban conversation, even though you achieve fluency in the language. No English speaker always speaks textbook English in natural conversation; Lojban speakers will also make grammatical errors when talking quickly. Lojbanists will, however, be able to speak or write unambiguously if they are careful, which is difficult if not impossible with a natural language.<br /><br />Nick Nicholas and John Cowan. '[http://lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/grammar.html ''What Is Lojban? II.3'']}}\n\nThe computer-tested, unambiguous rules also include grammar for 'incomplete' sentences e.g. for narrative, quotational, or mathematical phrases.\n\nIts [[Linguistic typology|typology]] can be said to be basically [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] and [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]]. However, it can practically be anything:\n* {{lang|jbo|mi prami do}} (SVO) (I love you)\n* {{lang|jbo|mi do prami}} (SOV) (By me, you are loved)\n* {{lang|jbo|do se prami mi}} (OVS) (You are loved by me)\n* {{lang|jbo|do mi se prami}} (OSV) (You, I love)\n* {{lang|jbo|prami fa mi do}} (VSO) (Loved by me, you are)\n* {{lang|jbo|prami do fa mi}}, {{lang|jbo|se prami fa do mi}} (VOS) (Love you, I do)\n\nSuch flexibility has to do with the language's intended capability to translate as many expressions of natural languages as possible, based on a unique positional case system. The meaning of the sentence {{lang|jbo|mi prami do}} is determined by {{lang|jbo|prami}} realizing, with its own predefined \"place structure\", a specific semantic relation between {{lang|jbo|mi}} and {{lang|jbo|do}}; when the positional relation between {{lang|jbo|mi}} and {{lang|jbo|do}} changes, the meaning of the sentence changes too. As shown above, Lojban has particular devices to preserve such semantic structure of words while altering their order.\n\nAs befits a logical language, there is a large assortment of logical connectives. Such conjunction words take different forms depending on what they connect, another reason why the (standard) Lojbanic expressions are typically precise and clear.\n\nMultiple predicate words may be linked up together so as to narrow the semantic scope of the phrase. In {{lang|jbo|sutra dansu}} \"to quickly dance\", the modifying word {{lang|jbo|sutra}} narrows the sense of the modified word {{lang|jbo|dansu}} to form a more specific concept (in which case the modifier may resemble English adverbs or adjectives).\n<!--\n* '''English:''' ''Several small fires were burning in the house''.\n* '''Lojban:''' {{lang|jbo|so'i cmalu fagri puca'o jelca ne'i le zdani}}\n* '''[[Gloss (annotation)|Gloss]]:''' ''many small fire past-continuing burn inside the house'' (Translation after English)\n-->\nOne could go still further, adding a quite extreme example of its syntactic flexibility.\n\nLojban can easily \"imitate\" even one-word sentences from [[polysynthetic language]]s, for example:\n\n* '''[[Nuu-chah-nulth language]]''': ''inkiwihl'minik'isit''\n* '''[[Gloss (annotation)|Gloss]]''': ''inkiw (fire/burn) -ihl (in-the-house) -'minik (plural) -'is (diminutive) -'it (past-tense)''\n\nwhich can be expressed in Lojban the same way:\n\n* '''Lojban:''' {{lang|jbo|fagykemyzdanerso'icmapru}}\n* '''Gloss:''' ''fire-type-house-inside-many-small-past-event''\n\n===Lexicon===\nCompound words ({{lang|jbo|lujvo}}) and borrowed words ({{lang|jbo|fu'ivla}}) are continually increasing as the speakers find demands. The number of root words ({{lang|jbo|gismu}}) and structure words ({{lang|jbo|cmavo}}) are basically unchanging, but new inventions are to be accepted as experimental components. In fact, it has been noticed that particular inclination or disproportion exists in the available vocabulary. Cortesi<ref>Cortesi, David.

He is also a prominent figure on the mailing list, helping beginners with the language.\n* [[John W. Cowan]]<!-- (aka ''jcowan'')-->: the author of ''The Complete Lojban Language''.\n* Miles Forster (also known as {{lang|jbo|la selpa'i}}): a German Lojbanist who wrote the song ''ca pa djedi''<ref name=\"ca pa djedi\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZomVOBE5-0|title=Ca Pa Djedi (Original Song in Lojban by selpa'i)|work=YouTube}}</ref> and made several large translations into Lojban.\n* Robin Turner: a British philosopher and linguist living in Turkey, and coauthor of ''Lojban For Beginners''.\n* Nick Nicholas (also known as ''la nitcion''): an Australian linguist, and coauthor of ''Lojban For Beginners''.<!--* Matt Arnold (aka ''la epkat''): has been contributing to the [[translation project]] and software development.-->\n\n== Comparison with other logical languages ==\n\n=== Loglan ===\n{{Main article| Comparison between Lojban and Loglan}}\nThe principal difference between Lojban and Loglan is one of lexicon. The words for Lojban were made by the same principles as those for Loglan; that is, candidate forms were chosen according to how many sounds they had in common with their equivalent in some of the most commonly spoken languages on Earth, which was then multiplied by the number of speakers of the languages with which the words had letters in common. The difference with the Lojban remake of the root words was that the weighting was updated to reflect the actual numbers of speakers for the languages. This resulted in word forms that had fewer sounds taken from English, and more sounds taken from Chinese. For instance, the Loglan word ''norma'' is equivalent to the Lojban word {{lang|jbo|cnano}} (cf. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] \u5e38, [[pinyin]] ''ch\u00e1ng''), both meaning \"normal\".\n\nLoglan and Lojban still have essentially the same grammars, and most of what is said in the [[#Grammar|Grammar]] section above holds true for Loglan as well. Most simple, declarative sentences could be translated word by\nword between the two languages.\n\nIn the new phonology for Lojban, the consonant ''q'' and the vowel ''w'' were removed, and the consonant ''h'' was replaced by ''x''. The consonant ' ([[apostrophe]]) was added with the value of [h] in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], but its distribution is such that it can appear only [[intervocally]], and in discussions of the morphology and phonotactics, it is described not as a proper consonant, but a \"[[voiceless glide]]\". (This phoneme is realized as [\u03b8] by some speakers.)\n\n=== gua\\spi ===\n{{lang|mis|gua\\spi}} is a descendant of Loglan but is [[tonal language|tonal]], developed by Jim Carter. Instead of structure words there are in {{lang|mis|Gua\\spi}} six different tones. Predicates have only one syllable instead of two. Some of its characteristics, including tones, phonotactics, expressions for masses vs sets, non-existence of metalinguistic negation, etc., received criticism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/critique_of_gua%5Cspi|title=critique of gua\\spi|work=lojban.org}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Case grammar]]\n* [[FrameNet]]\n* [[Simplified Technical English]]\n* [[Ithkuil]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{InterWiki|code=jbo}}\n{{wikisource|The Complete Lojban Language}}\n{{sisterlinks|d=Q36350|n=no|v=no|voy=no|wikt=Lojban|mw=no|m=no|species=no|commons=Category:Lojban|q=no|s=no}}\n* {{Official website|https://www.lojban.org/}}\n* [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojban_Live_Chat Lojban chats]\n* [https://lojban.github.com/cll/ Reference grammar]\n* [https://la-lojban.github.io/sutysisku/en/ a searchable dictionary]\n** [https://la-lojban.github.io/sutysisku/ Also available in other languages]\n* [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Learning/en Learning materials]\n** [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/la_karda la karda: a distilled overview of the Lojban language]\n** [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojban_Wave_Lessons Wave Lessons, another popular textbook]\n** [http://www.memrise.com/courses/english/lojban/ Lojban courses for English speakers]\n** [http://www.lojban.org/publications/cll/cll_v1.1_2016-08-26.pdf Complete Lojban language]\n<!--*{{DMOZ|Science/Social_Sciences/Linguistics/Languages/Constructed/Logical/Lojban/}}-->\n{{Constructed languages}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Lojban| ]]\n[[Category:Constructed languages introduced in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:1987 introductions]]\n[[Category:Analytic languages]]\n[[Category:Engineered languages]]\n[[Category:Isolating languages]]\n[[Category:Constructed languages]]\n", "name_user": "Neutral0814", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSome unique Lojbanic expressions:changed heading; \"Some\" \u2192 \"Examples of\", & prettify tables; header cells", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban"}
