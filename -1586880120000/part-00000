It was released on March 18, 2011, through [[RCA Records]]. It was the group's first album in over five years, following ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'' (2005).\n\n==Recording==\nAfter touring in support of ''First Impressions of Earth'', the Strokes went on an extended hiatus in 2007<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-strokes/28547 |title=The Strokes to take the year off |publisher=Nme.com |date=May 24, 2007 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref> and then regrouped two years later to begin writing new material for a fourth album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-strokes/42301 |title=The Strokes: 'We've started writing our fourth album' |publisher=Nme.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref> The album took more than two years to materialize, with the band recording live demos of 18 songs before heading into [[Avatar Studios]] in New York with producer [[Joe Chiccarelli]], but without Casablancas.<ref name=\"Fractious\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-return-of-the-strokes-inside-the-fractious-sessions-for-their-fourth-album-20110118 |title=The Return of the Strokes: Inside the Fractious Sessions for Their Fourth Album |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=January 18, 2011 |accessdate=March 20, 2011}}</ref> Not long after recording began, however, the band became frustrated with both Chiccarelli's reserved production style and Casablancas' absence. Only one song from these recording sessions, \"Life Is Simple in the Moonlight\", remained in its original form on the album's track listing. The rest of the songs were either scrapped or reworked by the band with engineer Gus Oberg at guitarist [[Albert Hammond, Jr.]]'s home studio in [[Port Jervis, New York|Port Jervis]], [[Upstate New York]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-strokes/49559 |title=The Strokes begin recording fourth album with U2, Beck producer |publisher=Nme.com |date=2010-02-03 |accessdate=2012-05-12}}</ref>\n\nWhile Casablancas\u2019 disengagement may have been by design, guitarist Nick Valensi found the whole experience deeply dissatisfying. \"I won\u2019t do the next album if we make it like this. No way. It was awful\u2013 just awful. Working in a fractured way, not having a singer there.

In an interview with [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]], Casablancas stated: \"When I'm there, people might wait for me to say something. I think it took me being a little mute to force the initiative\".\n\nThese stories and reports stating the album was written separately by the band from Casablancas however, were untrue. The vocals were indeed recorded separately by Casablancas, but they were written together, in session, with the rest of the band present. Casablancas later said, \"The funny thing about ''Angles'' is there was all that weird talk about recording it separately. We just had dinner in L.A. and we were all talking about it. And they forget that we sat in a room in a studio and were writing songs forever. That's where we did the whole record. All the parts, the songs, in a room, together. We recorded them with two mics, and that was the foundation, and then we were going to go track the official recording.

It was the group's first album in over five years, following ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'' (2005).\n\n==Recording==\nAfter touring in support of ''First Impressions of Earth'', the Strokes went on an extended hiatus in 2007<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-strokes/28547 |title=The Strokes to take the year off |publisher=Nme.com |date=May 24, 2007 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref> and then regrouped two years later to begin writing new material for a fourth album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-strokes/42301 |title=The Strokes: 'We've started writing our fourth album' |publisher=Nme.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref> The album took more than two years to materialize, with the band recording live demos of 18 songs before heading into [[Avatar Studios]] in New York with producer [[Joe Chiccarelli]], but without Casablancas.<ref name=\"Fractious\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-return-of-the-strokes-inside-the-fractious-sessions-for-their-fourth-album-20110118 |title=The Return of the Strokes: Inside the Fractious Sessions for Their Fourth Album |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=January 18, 2011 |accessdate=March 20, 2011}}</ref> Not long after recording began, however, the band became frustrated with both Chiccarelli's reserved production style and Casablancas' absence. Only one song from these recording sessions, \"Life Is Simple in the Moonlight\", remained in its original form on the album's track listing. The rest of the songs were either scrapped or reworked by the band with engineer Gus Oberg at guitarist [[Albert Hammond, Jr.]]'s home studio in [[Port Jervis, New York|Port Jervis]], [[Upstate New York]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-strokes/49559 |title=The Strokes begin recording fourth album with U2, Beck producer |publisher=Nme.com |date=2010-02-03 |accessdate=2012-05-12}}</ref>\n\nWhile Casablancas\u2019 disengagement may have been by design, guitarist Nick Valensi found the whole experience deeply dissatisfying. \"I won\u2019t do the next album if we make it like this. No way. It was awful\u2013 just awful. Working in a fractured way, not having a singer there. I\u2019d show up certain days and do guitar takes by myself, just me and the engineer.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7925-this-is-it-ten-years-of-the-strokes/| title=This Is It: Ten Years of the Strokes| last=Garrett| first=Jonathan| date=March 7, 2011| accessdate=March 20, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110308162923/http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7925-this-is-it-ten-years-of-the-strokes/| archivedate= March 8, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> He added that most of Casablancas' ideas and suggestions were written \"in really vague terms\" and then sent to the band by email, leaving the others without much to go on. In an interview with [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]], Casablancas stated: \"When I'm there, people might wait for me to say something. I think it took me being a little mute to force the initiative\".\n\nThese stories and reports stating the album was written separately by the band from Casablancas however, were untrue. The vocals were indeed recorded separately by Casablancas, but they were written together, in session, with the rest of the band present. Casablancas later said, \"The funny thing about ''Angles'' is there was all that weird talk about recording it separately. We just had dinner in L.A. and we were all talking about it. And they forget that we sat in a room in a studio and were writing songs forever. That's where we did the whole record. All the parts, the songs, in a room, together. We recorded them with two mics, and that was the foundation, and then we were going to go track the official recording. That's when they went and recorded stuff, and when the 'Julian wasn't there,' BS or whatever [started]. That was just because logistically, we'd never done a record like that\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Doyle|first1=Patrick|title=22 Things You Learn Hanging Out With Julian Casablancas|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/22-things-you-learn-hanging-out-with-julian-casablancas-20141028#ixzz3KQocjqWZ|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nHammond's drug abuse and resulting rehab \u2014 stemming from his breakup with model [[Agyness Deyn]] \u2014 was another hurdle the band faced during the album's production, as he missed early recording sessions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yuan |first=Jada |url=https://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/55504/ |title=Agyness Deyn and Albert Hammond Jr. Break Up, Remain Friends |publisher=Nymag.com |date=2009-03-20 |accessdate=2012-05-12}}</ref>\n\n==Musical style==\n[[File:Thestrokes2010.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The Strokes at Austin City Limits Festival in 2010]]\nSpeaking to [[Zane Lowe]], [[Nikolai Fraiture]] stated that he felt ''Angles'' would be \"a return to the basics\", suggesting the songs would be of similar style to their acclaimed 2001 debut record, ''[[Is This It]]''.

It was announced at the company's [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|Worldwide Developers Conference]] on June 13, 2016, and was released on September 13, 2016. It was succeeded by [[iOS 11]] on September 19, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Releases iOS 11 With Revamped Lock Screen, Fresh App Store, New Siri Voice, and Updated iPad Interface |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/19/apple-releases-ios-11/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=September 19, 2017 |accessdate=September 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\niOS 10 incorporates changes to [[3D Touch]] and the lock screen. There are new features to some apps: [[Messages (Apple)|Messages]] has additional [[emoji]]s and third-party apps can extend functionality in iMessage, [[Apple Maps|Maps]] has a redesigned interface and additional third-party functions, the Home app manages \"HomeKit\"-enabled accessories, [[Photos (Apple)|Photos]] has algorithmic search and categorization of media known as \"Memories\", and [[Siri]] is compatible with third-party app-specific requests, such as starting workouts apps, sending [[instant messaging|IM]]s, using [[Lyft]] or [[Uber]] or to use payment functions.\n\nReviews of iOS 10 were positive. Reviewers highlighted the significant updates to iMessage, Siri, Photos, 3D Touch, and the lock screen as welcome changes. The third-party extension support to iMessage meant it was \"becoming a platform\", although the user interface was criticized for being difficult to understand. Third-party integration in Siri was \"great\", although the voice assistant was criticized for not having become smarter than before. Reviewers were impressed with the image recognition technology in Photos, although noting it was still a \"work in progress\" with a higher error rate than the competition. 3D Touch \"finally feels useful\" and \"works in almost every part of the OS\". The lock screen was \"far more customizable than before\", and reviewers enjoyed that notification bubbles could be expanded to see more information without needing to unlock the phone.\n\nA month after release, iOS 10 was installed on 54% of iOS devices, a \"slightly slower migration\" than for the release of iOS 9, speculated as being caused by an early release issue that may have \"put some [users] off downloading the update\".

He wrote that iMessage is \"becoming a platform all its own\", and although he liked that extensions mean access to information from apps without needing to open the respective apps, he wrote that new iMessage interface is difficult to understand and that the use of \"third-party apps, stickers, crazy confetti effects, and emoji all over the place\" is a \"nightmare\", although finishing with \"Or maybe that's a wonderland, not a nightmare. Your call.\" Regarding third-party support in Siri, he called it \"great\", while noting the limited class of apps (\"calls, messaging, payments, photos, ride-sharing apps, some CarPlay systems, and workouts\"), and that sometimes a button press was required to complete the process. Beyond app integrations, he criticized Siri, writing \"Siri doesn't seem to have gotten a whole lot smarter than you remember\". Bohn enjoyed the new machine learning technology present in the Photos app, writing that he was \"impressed\" by Apple's image recognition technology, which he noted is done locally on the device, but did criticize the error rate, where he compares the technology to [[Google Photos]] as a step ahead. Bohn liked the new designs for the Music and Maps apps, saying both the redesigns were \"for the better\". Bohn particularly enjoyed the new lock screen, where he highlighted that notification bubbles can be 3D Touch-ed to access more information, all without needing to unlock the phone. Other small bits of new features he liked included \"deletable\" apps, upgraded \"widgets\" when 3D Touch-ing a home screen icon, and breaking news notifications in Apple News. Overall, Bohn referred to iOS 10 as \"Still a walled garden, but with more doors\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Dieter |last=Bohn |title=iOS 10 review: doors into the walled garden |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/22/13010546/apple-ios-10-review-imessage-music-siri-iphone-ipad |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=September 22, 2016 |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''[[Engadget]]''{{'}}s Devindra Hardawar wrote that iOS 10 is Apple \"basically polishing a pearl\". Hardawar noted that the major changes in the release focus on features rather than the visual interface. He wrote that the lock screen is now \"far more customizable than before\". He praised the new features added to 3D Touch, writing that it \"finally feels useful\", where he likes that \"3D Touch works in almost every part of the OS\". In regard to iMessage, he wrote that it has new features that are \"particularly useful\", including \"Invisible ink\" that obscures text in a conversation when others might be looking, but criticized the user interface, writing that it \"needs some work\". The \"Memories\" feature in the new Photos app \"usually turned out well\", but wrote that \"they're still clearly a work in progress\". Hardawar praised the new Apple Music app, but added that \"really, anything is better than the last iteration\". He also liked lyrics support. He wrote that Siri's third-party support was \"actually starting to get useful\", but did run into accuracy issues. He finished by writing that although iOS 10 does add features seen in Google's [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]] before, the mobile industry is \"shamelessly getting \"inspired\" by the competition\". His summary states that \"iOS 10 is a collection of useful changes to an already solid OS\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Devindra |last=Hardawar |title=iOS 10 review: Apple evolves |url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/16/ios-10-review/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=September 16, 2016 |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2016, a month after its initial release, 54% of iOS devices were running iOS 10,<ref>{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=According to Apple's official figures, iOS 10 adoption rate now at 54% |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/11/according-to-apples-official-figures-ios-10-adoption-rate-now-at-54/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 19, 2017}}</ref> a \"slightly slower migration\" than for the release of iOS 9 in the preceding year, a result speculated by ''[[MacRumors]]''{{'}}s Tim Hardwick as being caused by an early release issue that disabled some devices and may have \"put some [users] off downloading the update\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Tim |last=Hardwick |title=Apple Puts Official iOS 10 Adoption Rate Figure at 54% |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/11/apple-ios-10-adoption-rate-figure-at-54/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=October 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 19, 2017}}</ref> User adoption increased to 76% of active devices in January 2017,<ref>{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=iOS 10 Now Installed on 76% of Active iOS Devices |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/05/ios-10-installed-on-76-percent-of-ios-devices/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=January 5, 2017 |accessdate=February 19, 2017}}</ref> 79% in February 2017,<ref>{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=iOS 10 Now Installed on Nearly 80% of Active iOS Devices |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/02/22/ios-10-nearly-80-percent-adoption/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=February 22, 2017 |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}</ref> 86% in June 2017,<ref>{{cite web |first=Romain |last=Dillet |title=Apple introduces iOS 11 |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-introduces-ios-11/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 5, 2017 |accessdate=June 5, 2017}}</ref> 87% in July 2017,<ref>{{cite web |first=Julian |last=Chokkattu |title=About 87 percent of active Apple iPhone and iPad devices run iOS 10 |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/ios-distribution-news/ |website=[[Digital Trends]] |date=August 21, 2017 |accessdate=October 12, 2017}}</ref> and 89% in September 2017 before the release of [[iOS 11]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Sebastien |last=Page |title=iOS 10 adoption reaches 89% ahead of iOS 11 launch |url=http://www.idownloadblog.com/2017/09/10/ios-10-adoption-reaches-89-ahead-of-ios-11-launch/ |website=iDownloadBlog |date=September 10, 2017 |accessdate=October 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Problems ==\n\n=== Initial release bricking issue ===\nThe initial public release of iOS 10 on September 13, 2016 saw many [[iPhone]]s and [[iPad]]s temporarily disabled, or \"bricked\", by the over-the-air update, requiring bricked devices to be connected to a [[Macintosh|Mac]] or [[Microsoft Windows|PC]] with [[iTunes]] in order to retry the update or restore the device to factory settings.

It was succeeded by [[iOS 11]] on September 19, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Releases iOS 11 With Revamped Lock Screen, Fresh App Store, New Siri Voice, and Updated iPad Interface |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/19/apple-releases-ios-11/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=September 19, 2017 |accessdate=September 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\niOS 10 incorporates changes to [[3D Touch]] and the lock screen. There are new features to some apps: [[Messages (Apple)|Messages]] has additional [[emoji]]s and third-party apps can extend functionality in iMessage, [[Apple Maps|Maps]] has a redesigned interface and additional third-party functions, the Home app manages \"HomeKit\"-enabled accessories, [[Photos (Apple)|Photos]] has algorithmic search and categorization of media known as \"Memories\", and [[Siri]] is compatible with third-party app-specific requests, such as starting workouts apps, sending [[instant messaging|IM]]s, using [[Lyft]] or [[Uber]] or to use payment functions.\n\nReviews of iOS 10 were positive. Reviewers highlighted the significant updates to iMessage, Siri, Photos, 3D Touch, and the lock screen as welcome changes. The third-party extension support to iMessage meant it was \"becoming a platform\", although the user interface was criticized for being difficult to understand. Third-party integration in Siri was \"great\", although the voice assistant was criticized for not having become smarter than before. Reviewers were impressed with the image recognition technology in Photos, although noting it was still a \"work in progress\" with a higher error rate than the competition. 3D Touch \"finally feels useful\" and \"works in almost every part of the OS\". The lock screen was \"far more customizable than before\", and reviewers enjoyed that notification bubbles could be expanded to see more information without needing to unlock the phone.\n\nA month after release, iOS 10 was installed on 54% of iOS devices, a \"slightly slower migration\" than for the release of iOS 9, speculated as being caused by an early release issue that may have \"put some [users] off downloading the update\". User adoption of iOS 10 steadily increased in the following months, eventually totaling 89% of active devices in September 2017.\n\n== History ==\n{{further|iOS version history#iOS 10}}\n\n=== Introduction and initial release ===\niOS 10 was introduced at the [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] keynote address on June 13, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |first=Vlad |last=Savov |title=Apple announces iOS 10 with 10 major features and redesigns |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11921068/apple-ios-10-announced-new-iphone-features-wwdc-2016 |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 13, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref> The first beta release was made available to registered developers following the keynote.<ref>{{cite web |first=Zach |last=Epstein |title=iOS 10 beta 1 is now available for download! |url=http://bgr.com/2016/06/13/ios-10-beta-1-download-link-how-to/ |website=[[Boy Genius Report|BGR]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |date=June 13, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref> Apple released the first public beta release on July 7, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Slivka |title=Public Beta of iOS 10 Now Available for Download |url=http://www.macrumors.com/2016/07/07/ios-10-public-beta/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=July 7, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\niOS 10 was officially released on September 13, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Releases iOS 10 With Redesigned Lock Screen, New Messages Features, Third-Party Siri, and More |url=http://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/13/apple-releases-ios-10/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=September 13, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Updates ===\n\n==== 10.0.1 ====\niOS 10.0.1 was released on September 13, 2016, as the first update to iOS 10.

He wrote that iMessage is \"becoming a platform all its own\", and although he liked that extensions mean access to information from apps without needing to open the respective apps, he wrote that new iMessage interface is difficult to understand and that the use of \"third-party apps, stickers, crazy confetti effects, and emoji all over the place\" is a \"nightmare\", although finishing with \"Or maybe that's a wonderland, not a nightmare. Your call.\" Regarding third-party support in Siri, he called it \"great\", while noting the limited class of apps (\"calls, messaging, payments, photos, ride-sharing apps, some CarPlay systems, and workouts\"), and that sometimes a button press was required to complete the process. Beyond app integrations, he criticized Siri, writing \"Siri doesn't seem to have gotten a whole lot smarter than you remember\". Bohn enjoyed the new machine learning technology present in the Photos app, writing that he was \"impressed\" by Apple's image recognition technology, which he noted is done locally on the device, but did criticize the error rate, where he compares the technology to [[Google Photos]] as a step ahead. Bohn liked the new designs for the Music and Maps apps, saying both the redesigns were \"for the better\". Bohn particularly enjoyed the new lock screen, where he highlighted that notification bubbles can be 3D Touch-ed to access more information, all without needing to unlock the phone. Other small bits of new features he liked included \"deletable\" apps, upgraded \"widgets\" when 3D Touch-ing a home screen icon, and breaking news notifications in Apple News. Overall, Bohn referred to iOS 10 as \"Still a walled garden, but with more doors\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Dieter |last=Bohn |title=iOS 10 review: doors into the walled garden |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/22/13010546/apple-ios-10-review-imessage-music-siri-iphone-ipad |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=September 22, 2016 |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''[[Engadget]]''{{'}}s Devindra Hardawar wrote that iOS 10 is Apple \"basically polishing a pearl\". Hardawar noted that the major changes in the release focus on features rather than the visual interface. He wrote that the lock screen is now \"far more customizable than before\". He praised the new features added to 3D Touch, writing that it \"finally feels useful\", where he likes that \"3D Touch works in almost every part of the OS\". In regard to iMessage, he wrote that it has new features that are \"particularly useful\", including \"Invisible ink\" that obscures text in a conversation when others might be looking, but criticized the user interface, writing that it \"needs some work\". The \"Memories\" feature in the new Photos app \"usually turned out well\", but wrote that \"they're still clearly a work in progress\". Hardawar praised the new Apple Music app, but added that \"really, anything is better than the last iteration\". He also liked lyrics support. He wrote that Siri's third-party support was \"actually starting to get useful\", but did run into accuracy issues. He finished by writing that although iOS 10 does add features seen in Google's [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]] before, the mobile industry is \"shamelessly getting \"inspired\" by the competition\".
