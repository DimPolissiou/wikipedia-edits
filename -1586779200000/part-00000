That instrument was a 'standard' Western mandolin; however, he made modifications to suit his playing style over the course of his musical career.\n\nSrinivas started out on the acoustic mandolin, but neither the size nor plucking required of the acoustic mandolin was suited for long, sustained notes. He then switched to the electric mandolin, which was better suited for sustained notes and musical ornamentations.\n\nUnlike a typical mandolin's eight strings, tuned to GG-DD-AA-EE, Srinivas generally used only five strings tuned to CGCGC. Copies of this style of mandolin are available in India, and several other Indian mandolin players have used instruments just like it (including Suresh Kumar, Raghavendra, and his brother, U.Rajesh).<ref>http://www.emando.com/players/U_Srinivas.htm</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nSrinivas married U.

{"title_page": "Sexual slavery in Islam", "text_new": "'''Sexual slavery in Islam''' results from the permission in [[Islamic law]] for men to have sexual intercourse with the female slaves they own. Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}}\n\nEarly sources indicate that that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law recognises two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}\n*Slave-girls by descent: those who are born to slave parents.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam : Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith, and Jurisprudence |date=2016 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |page=57}}</ref> Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.<ref>{{cite book|author=Y.

Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kecia Ali|title=Imam Shafi'i: Scholar and Saint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNvUehSxcesC&pg=PT76|date=1 November 2011|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-004-1|pages=76\u2013}}</ref> If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p-18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.<ref>{{cite book|author1=William Gervase Clarence-Smith|author2=W. G. Clarence-Smith|title=Islam and the Abolition of Slavery|url=https://archive.org/details/islamabolitionof0000clar|url-access=registration|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-522151-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/islamabolitionof0000clar/page/n56 27]\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\nUmm walad (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of umm walad even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women.

So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property.

Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family.

However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an umm walad. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines. [[Circassians|Circassian]] and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p-531}} Elite men were required to leave their wives and concubines if they wished to marry an Ottoman princess.

Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

They became equal citizens of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.{{sfn|Lieven|2012|p=362}}\n\n==History of sexual enslavement==\n===Sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIn [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]] the concubines of the Muslim elite were usually non-Muslim women from the Christian areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]]. Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies.

[[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem. [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king. The rest would either be sold or kept for themselves.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali']]<nowiki/>s army captured Maratha women to fill Afghan harems.{{sfn|Singh|2006|p=68}} The Sikhs attacked Abdali and rescued 2, 2000 Maratha girls.{{sfn|Singh|2015|p=78}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by non-Muslim men===\nMuslim historical sources see the capture and concubinage of non-Muslim women as legitimate violence against women. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

The female captives are used sexually. Their Muslim captors state that Islamic law allows them. In [[Afghanistan]] the [[Taliban]] has committed atrocities against the Shia population. One of its atrocities has been to enslave Shia [[Hazaras|Hazara]] women and use them for concubinage.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=53}} In 1998 eyewitnesses in [[Mazar-i-Sharif|Mazar e Sharif]] reported the abduction of hundreds of Shia girls who were used by Taliban fighters as concubines.{{sfn|Nojumi|2016|p=168}} The Taliban either takes beautiful young women from other ethnic groups as concubines or forcibly marries them.{{sfn|Claus|2003|p=7}}\n\n==Modern Muslim attitudes==\nWhile classical [[Sharia|Islamic law]] permits sexual slavery, the vast majority of Muslims today oppose it. This contradiction is demonstrated by Ahmed Hassan, a twentieth century translator of Sahih Muslim, who prefaced the translated chapter on marriage by claiming that Islam only allows sex within marriage. This was despite the fact that the same chapter included many references to Muslim men having sex with slave-girls.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=107}} Most ordinary Muslims ignore the existence of slavery and concubinage in Islamic history and texts. Most also ignore the millennia old consensus permitting it and a few writers even claim that those Islamic jurists who allowed sexual relations outside marriage with female slaves were mistaken.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=108}}\n\nAsifa Quraishi-Landes also observes that most Muslims believe that sex is only permissible within marriage and they ignore the permission for keeping concubines in Islamic jurisprudence.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=182}} Furthermore, the majority of modern Muslims are not aware that Islamic jurists had made an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} and many modern Muslims would be offended by the idea that a [[husband]] owns his wife's private parts under Islamic law.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=182}}\n\nIn response to the enslavement of [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] women by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] the [[Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations]] and Fiqh Council of North America claimed that no scholar disputes the abolition of slavery was one of the aims of Islam. However, [[Kecia Ali]] finds this claim dishonest. While there was definitely  an \u201cemancipatory ethic\u201d (encouragement for freeing slaves) in Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was never actually abolished.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=6}} The translator of [[Ibn Kathir]]'s treatise on slaves, Umar ibn Sulayman Hafyan, felt obliged to explain why he published a slave treatise when [[slavery]] no longer exists. He states that just because slavery no longer exists does not mean that the laws about slavery have been abrogated. Moreover, slavery was only abolished half a century ago and could return in the future.  His comments were a reflection of the predicament modern Muslims find themselves in.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=304}}\n\n[[Muhammad Taqi Usmani|Mufti Taqi Usmani]] states that slavery and turning captives into concubines is still allowed by Islam. However, he states that due to the fact that most Muslim countries have signed international treaties which prohibit enslavement, the Muslim countries should not enslave prisoners of war as long as other nations also refrain from enslavement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Usmani |first1=Muftii Taqi |title=Slavery in Islam |url=https://www.deoband.org/2013/01/hadith/hadith-commentary/slavery-in-islam/ |website=Deoband.org}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rape in Islamic law]]\n* [[Polygamy in Islam]]\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4|pages=196\u2013225|DOI=10.1163/2405836X-00402004| ref = {{sfnRef|Pernilla|2019}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Asifa Quraishi-Landes|title=Feminism, Law, and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfkFDAAAQBAJ|date=15 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-13579-1|chapter=A Meditation on Mahr, Modernity, and Muslim Marriage Contract Law| ref = {{sfnRef|Quraishi-Landes|2016}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Kecia Ali|title=Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith and Jurisprudence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=my4XCwAAQBAJ|date=21 December 2015|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-853-5| ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2015}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Saad |first1=Salma |title=The legal and social status of women in the Hadith literature |date=1990 |page=242|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/508/1/uk_bl_ethos_443314.pdf| ref = {{sfnRef|Saad|1990}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Nesrine Badawi|title=Islamic Jurisprudence on the Regulation of Armed Conflict: Text and Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MC0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA17|date=1 October 2019|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-41062-6| ref = {{sfnRef|Badawi|2019}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Marriage and Slavery in Early Islam |publisher=Harvard University Press |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PeOeXlqzZ-cC&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2010| ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2010}}}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Seedat |first1=Fatima |title=Sexual economies of war and sexual technologies of the body: Militarised Muslim masculinity and the Islamist production of concubines for the caliphate |journal=Agenda |date=2016 |volume=30 |issue=3 |doi=10.1080/10130950.2016.1275558| ref = {{sfnRef|Seedat|2016}}}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Islamic Jurisprudence According To The Four Sunni Schools Al Fiqh 'ala Al Madhahib Al Arba'ah|last=Al-jaziri|first=abd Al-rahman|last2=Roberts|first2=Nancy|publisher=Fons Vitae|year=2009|isbn=978-1887752978| ref = {{sfnRef|Nancy|2009}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Rizwi Faizer|title=The Life of Muhammad: Al-Waqidi's Kitab Al-Maghazi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZknAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA462|date=5 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-92114-8| ref = {{sfnRef|Faizer|2013}}}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Concubinage and Consent |journal=International Journal of Media Studies |date=2017 |volume=49  |doi=10.1017/S0020743816001203| ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2017}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Willis |first1=John Ralph |title=Slaves and Slavery in Africa: Volume One: Islam and the Ideology of Enslavement |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317792130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V5y3AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT43&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false| ref = {{sfnRef|Willis|2014}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=McMahon |first1=Elisabeth |title=Slavery and Emancipation in Islamic East Africa: From Honor to Respectability |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107328518 |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-cwhAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA18&dq| ref = {{sfnRef|McMahon|2013}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Jonathan E.

Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}}\n\nEarly sources indicate that that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law recognises two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}\n*Slave-girls by descent: those who are born to slave parents.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam : Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith, and Jurisprudence |date=2016 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |page=57}}</ref> Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.<ref>{{cite book|author=Y.

Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kecia Ali|title=Imam Shafi'i: Scholar and Saint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNvUehSxcesC&pg=PT76|date=1 November 2011|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-004-1|pages=76\u2013}}</ref> If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p-18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.<ref>{{cite book|author1=William Gervase Clarence-Smith|author2=W.

However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of umm walad even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the data found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} Due to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}}\n\n===Women of Hawazin===\nThe Banu [[Thaqif]] and Banu [[Hawazin]] tribes decided to go to war against Muhammad under the leadership of Malik ibn Awf.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} Malik had the unfortunate idea of bringing the women, children and livestock with his army.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Saron |first1=Mose |title=Studies in Islamic History and Civilization: In Honour of Professor David Ayalon |date=1986 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789652640147 |page=266}}</ref> He believed that by bringing their women and children with the army, all his soldiers would fight more courageously to defend them.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} When Muhammad was informed that the Hawazin had brought their women, children and livestock with them, he smiled and said \"Inshaa Allah, all these will become the booty of war for the Muslims.\"{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=260-261}}\n\nThe Muslim army defeated the Hawazin and captured their women and children. The pagan soldiers fled.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=262}} The war booty which the Muslims obtained was 24,000 camels, more than 40,000 goats, 160,000 dirhams worth of silver and 6,000 women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=263}} Muhammad waited ten days for the Hawazin to repent and reclaim their families and properties. However, none of them came. Finally, Muhammad distributed the war booty among the Muslim soldiers.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=264}} The Muslim soldiers initially hesitated to have sex with the married female captives, until a verse was revealed giving them permission to have sex with them:<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631/\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0634\u0642\u064a|title=THE EXEGESIS OF THE GRAND HOLY QUR'AN 1-4 Ibn Katheer VOL 2: \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 &#91;\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a&#93; 1/4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCxuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Dar Al Kotob Al Ilmiyah \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629|pages=40\u201341|id=GGKEY:47J6TBSZ6R8}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"We captured some women from the area of Awtas who were already married, and we disliked having sexual relations with them because they already had husbands. So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an umm walad. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S. Chaudhry|title=Domestic Violence and the Islamic Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFT1AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA105|date=20 December 2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-166989-7|pages=105\u2013}}</ref> The slave owner was also encouraged to not use excessive violence. While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines. [[Circassians|Circassian]] and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex.

Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

They became equal citizens of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.{{sfn|Lieven|2012|p=362}}\n\n==History of sexual enslavement==\n===Sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIn [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]] the concubines of the Muslim elite were usually non-Muslim women from the Christian areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]]. Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies. In 1296 approximately 16,000 women committed jauhar to save themselves from [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khalj]]<nowiki/>i's army.{{sfn|Roy|2012|p=182}} Rajput women would commit it when they saw that defeat and enslavement was imminent for their people.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=143}} In 1533 in [[Chittorgarh]] nearly 13,000 women and children killed themselves instead of being taken captive by [[Bahadur Shah]]'s army.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=144}} For them sexual intercourse was the worst form of humiliation.

[[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem. [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king. The rest would either be sold or kept for themselves.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali']]<nowiki/>s army captured Maratha women to fill Afghan harems.{{sfn|Singh|2006|p=68}} The Sikhs attacked Abdali and rescued 2, 2000 Maratha girls.{{sfn|Singh|2015|p=78}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by non-Muslim men===\nMuslim historical sources see the capture and concubinage of non-Muslim women as legitimate violence against women. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

See WP:ENGVAR for more info.--> a pathetic English [[pop music|pop]] band formed in [[Manchester]] in 1991. Developed from an earlier group, the Rain, the band originally consisted of [[Liam Gallagher]] (lead vocals, tambourine), [[Paul Arthurs]] (guitar), [[Paul McGuigan (musician)|Paul McGuigan]] (bass guitar), and [[Tony McCarroll]] (drums). Upon returning to Manchester, Liam's older brother, [[Noel Gallagher]] (lead guitar, vocals) joined as a fifth member, which formed the band's core and settled line-up. During the course of their existence, they had various line-up changes, though the Gallagher brothers remained as the staple members until the group's dissolution.\n\nOasis signed to independent record label [[Creation Records]] in 1993 and released their record-setting debut album ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' (1994). The following year the band recorded ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' (1995) with drummer [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]], in the midst of a [[Britpop#\"The Battle of Britpop\"|chart rivalry]] with [[Britpop]] peers [[Blur (band)|Blur]]. ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'' became one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]], selling over 22 million copies worldwide, and the Gallagher brothers were featured regularly in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspapers]] for their sibling disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1996, Oasis performed two nights at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]] for an audience of 125,000 each night, which were at the time the largest outdoor concerts in UK history. 2.5 million people applied for tickets, which remains the highest demand for a show in British history. In 1997, Oasis released their third album, ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' (1997); although it was the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, and went on to sell 8 million copies, its popularity tapered off quickly.\n\nMcGuigan and Arthurs left Oasis in 1999 as the band released ''[[Standing on the Shoulder of Giants]]'' (2000). They were replaced by former [[Heavy Stereo]] guitarist/frontman [[Gem Archer]] and former [[Ride (band)|Ride]] guitarist/frontman [[Andy Bell (musician)|Andy Bell]]. Following a number of further departures, the rest of the band decided to continue under the name [[Beady Eye]] until their breakup in 2014.<ref name=\"End of Oasis\">{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/liam-gallagher-renames-oasis_1131186 |title=Oasis \u2013 Liam Gallagher renames Oasis |publisher=Contactmusic.com |date=5 February 2010 |accessdate=7 February 2011}}</ref> Noel formed a solo project, [[Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds]].

Unsatisfied with Hutton, Arthurs invited and auditioned acquaintance [[Liam Gallagher]] as a replacement. Liam suggested that the band name be changed to Oasis, inspired by an [[Inspiral Carpets]] tour poster in the Gallagher brothers' bedroom which listed the [[Oasis Leisure Centre]] in [[Swindon]] as a venue.<ref>Harris, John. ''Britpop!: Cool Britannia and the Spectacular Demise of English Rock''. Da Capo Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-306-81367-X}}, pg.&nbsp;124\u201325</ref>\n\nOasis played their first gig on 18 August 1991 at the [[Boardwalk (music club)|Boardwalk]] club in Manchester. Liam's brother [[Noel Gallagher]], a [[road crew|roadie]] for Inspiral Carpets, went with the band to watch his younger brother's band play. Whilst Noel and his friends did not think Oasis sounded particularly spectacular, he began to consider the possibility of using his brother's group as a possible outlet for a series of songs he had been writing for several years. Noel approached the group about joining with the proviso that he would become the band's sole songwriter and leader, and that they would commit to an earnest pursuit of commercial success. \"He had loads of stuff written,\" Arthurs recalled. \"When he walked in, we were a band making a racket with four tunes. All of a sudden, there were loads of ideas.\"<ref>Harris, pg.&nbsp;125\u201326</ref> Under Noel, Oasis crafted a musical approach that relied on simplicity: with Arthurs and McGuigan restricted to playing [[barre chord]]s and [[root (chord)|root bass notes]], McCarroll playing basic rhythms, and the band's amplifiers turned up to create distortion, Oasis created a sound \"so devoid of finesse and complexity that it came out sounding pretty much unstoppable.\"<ref>Harris, pg.&nbsp;127\u201328</ref>\n\n===1993\u20131995: Breakthrough with ''Definitely Maybe'' ===\nAfter over a year of live shows, rehearsals and a recording of a demo, the ''[[Live Demonstration]]'' tape, Oasis's big break came in May 1993 when they were spotted by Creation Records co-owner [[Alan McGee]]. Oasis were invited to play a gig at [[King Tut's Wah Wah Hut]] club in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, by Sister Lovers, who shared their rehearsal rooms. Oasis, along with a group of friends, hired a van and made the journey to Glasgow. When they arrived, they were refused entry as they were not on that night's set list; the band and McGee have given contradicting statements about how they managed to get into the club.<ref>VH1 Behind the Music, [[VH1]], 2000</ref> They were given the opening slot and impressed McGee, who was there to see [[18 Wheeler (band)|18 Wheeler]], one of his own bands. McGee offered them a recording contract; however, they did not sign until several months later.<ref>\"Oasis.\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press.</ref> Due to problems securing an American contract, Oasis signed a worldwide contract with [[Sony]], which in turn licensed Oasis to Creation in the UK.<ref>Harris, pg. 131</ref>\nFollowing a limited white label release of the demo of their song \"Columbia\", Oasis went on a UK tour to promote the release of their first single, \"[[Supersonic (Oasis song)|Supersonic]]\", playing venues such as the Tunbridge Wells Forum, a converted public toilet. Supersonic was released in April 1994, reaching number&nbsp;31 in the charts.<ref>Harris, pg. 149</ref> The release was followed by \"[[Shakermaker]]\", which became the subject of a plagiarism suit, with Oasis paying $500,000 in damages. Their third single, \"[[Live Forever (Oasis song)|Live Forever]]\", was their first to enter the top ten of the UK charts. After troubled recording and mixing sessions, Oasis's debut album, ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'', was released on 29 August 1994, entering the charts at number one within a week of its release, and at the time becoming the fastest selling debut album in the UK.<ref>Harris, pg. 178</ref>\n\nNearly a year of constant live performances and recordings, along with a [[hedonistic]] lifestyle, were taking their toll on the band. This behaviour culminated during a gig in Los Angeles in September 1994, leading to an inept performance by Liam during which he made offensive remarks about American audiences and hit Noel with a [[tambourine]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Grundy|first=Gareth|title=Born To Feud|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/30/oasis-split-liam-noel-gallagher|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref>  The incident upset Noel to such an extent he temporarily quit the band and flew to San Francisco (it was from this incident the song \"[[Talk Tonight]]\" was written). He was tracked down by Creation's Tim Abbot and they made a trip to Las Vegas. Once there, the elder Gallagher was persuaded to continue with the band. He reconciled with Liam and the tour resumed in [[Minneapolis]].<ref>Harris, pg. 189</ref> The group followed up with the fourth single from ''Definitely Maybe'', \"[[Cigarettes & Alcohol]]\", and the Christmas single \"[[Whatever (Oasis song)|Whatever]]\", issued in December 1994 which entered the British charts at number three.<ref>Harris, pg. 213</ref>\n\n===1995\u20131996: ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'', international success, and peak popularity===\nOasis had their first UK number one single in April 1995 with \"[[Some Might Say]]\". At the same time, drummer Tony McCarroll was ousted from the band. McCarroll said, on leaving Oasis, that he was \"unlawfully expelled from the partnership\" for what he called a \"personality clash\" with the brothers. The Gallaghers, on the other hand, doubted McCarroll's musical ability, with Noel saying: \"I like Tony as a geezer but he wouldn't have been able to drum the new songs\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supanet.com/entertainment/music_feature/news/52861/Almost_famous.html|title=Supanet entertainment music feature|publisher=Supanet.com|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/288881.stm|title=\u00a3550,000 for sacked Oasis drummer|work=BBC News|date=3 March 1999|accessdate=3 February 2008}}</ref> McCarroll was replaced by [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]], formerly of [[Starclub]] and younger brother of renowned studio percussionist [[Steve White (drummer)|Steve White]] and recommended to Noel by [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]].

Quarrels between the Gallagher brothers plagued the recording sessions. ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' was released in August 1997. Preceded by the UK number&nbsp;one single \"[[D'You Know What I Mean?]]\", the album was their most anticipated effort, and as such became the subject of considerable media attention.

However, long-time drummer Alan White, who at this time had played on nearly all of the band's material, left the band in early January 2004.

See WP:ENGVAR for more info.--> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Manchester]] in 1991. Developed from an earlier group, the Rain, the band originally consisted of [[Liam Gallagher]] (lead vocals, tambourine), [[Paul Arthurs]] (guitar), [[Paul McGuigan (musician)|Paul McGuigan]] (bass guitar), and [[Tony McCarroll]] (drums). Upon returning to Manchester, Liam's older brother, [[Noel Gallagher]] (lead guitar, vocals) joined as a fifth member, which formed the band's core and settled line-up. During the course of their existence, they had various line-up changes, though the Gallagher brothers remained as the staple members until the group's dissolution.\n\nOasis signed to independent record label [[Creation Records]] in 1993 and released their record-setting debut album ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' (1994). The following year the band recorded ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' (1995) with drummer [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]], in the midst of a [[Britpop#\"The Battle of Britpop\"|chart rivalry]] with [[Britpop]] peers [[Blur (band)|Blur]]. ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'' became one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]], selling over 22 million copies worldwide, and the Gallagher brothers were featured regularly in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspapers]] for their sibling disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1996, Oasis performed two nights at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]] for an audience of 125,000 each night, which were at the time the largest outdoor concerts in UK history. 2.5 million people applied for tickets, which remains the highest demand for a show in British history. In 1997, Oasis released their third album, ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' (1997); although it was the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, and went on to sell 8 million copies, its popularity tapered off quickly.\n\nMcGuigan and Arthurs left Oasis in 1999 as the band released ''[[Standing on the Shoulder of Giants]]'' (2000). They were replaced by former [[Heavy Stereo]] guitarist/frontman [[Gem Archer]] and former [[Ride (band)|Ride]] guitarist/frontman [[Andy Bell (musician)|Andy Bell]]. Following a number of further departures, the rest of the band decided to continue under the name [[Beady Eye]] until their breakup in 2014.<ref name=\"End of Oasis\">{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/liam-gallagher-renames-oasis_1131186 |title=Oasis \u2013 Liam Gallagher renames Oasis |publisher=Contactmusic.com |date=5 February 2010 |accessdate=7 February 2011}}</ref> Noel formed a solo project, [[Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds]].

Unsatisfied with Hutton, Arthurs invited and auditioned acquaintance [[Liam Gallagher]] as a replacement. Liam suggested that the band name be changed to Oasis, inspired by an [[Inspiral Carpets]] tour poster in the Gallagher brothers' bedroom which listed the [[Oasis Leisure Centre]] in [[Swindon]] as a venue.<ref>Harris, John. ''Britpop!: Cool Britannia and the Spectacular Demise of English Rock''. Da Capo Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-306-81367-X}}, pg.&nbsp;124\u201325</ref>\n\nOasis played their first gig on 18 August 1991 at the [[Boardwalk (music club)|Boardwalk]] club in Manchester. Liam's brother [[Noel Gallagher]], a [[road crew|roadie]] for Inspiral Carpets, went with the band to watch his younger brother's band play. Whilst Noel and his friends did not think Oasis sounded particularly spectacular, he began to consider the possibility of using his brother's group as a possible outlet for a series of songs he had been writing for several years. Noel approached the group about joining with the proviso that he would become the band's sole songwriter and leader, and that they would commit to an earnest pursuit of commercial success. \"He had loads of stuff written,\" Arthurs recalled. \"When he walked in, we were a band making a racket with four tunes. All of a sudden, there were loads of ideas.\"<ref>Harris, pg.&nbsp;125\u201326</ref> Under Noel, Oasis crafted a musical approach that relied on simplicity: with Arthurs and McGuigan restricted to playing [[barre chord]]s and [[root (chord)|root bass notes]], McCarroll playing basic rhythms, and the band's amplifiers turned up to create distortion, Oasis created a sound \"so devoid of finesse and complexity that it came out sounding pretty much unstoppable.\"<ref>Harris, pg.&nbsp;127\u201328</ref>\n\n===1993\u20131995: Breakthrough with ''Definitely Maybe'' ===\nAfter over a year of live shows, rehearsals and a recording of a demo, the ''[[Live Demonstration]]'' tape, Oasis's big break came in May 1993 when they were spotted by Creation Records co-owner [[Alan McGee]]. Oasis were invited to play a gig at [[King Tut's Wah Wah Hut]] club in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, by Sister Lovers, who shared their rehearsal rooms. Oasis, along with a group of friends, hired a van and made the journey to Glasgow. When they arrived, they were refused entry as they were not on that night's set list; the band and McGee have given contradicting statements about how they managed to get into the club.<ref>VH1 Behind the Music, [[VH1]], 2000</ref> They were given the opening slot and impressed McGee, who was there to see [[18 Wheeler (band)|18 Wheeler]], one of his own bands. McGee offered them a recording contract; however, they did not sign until several months later.<ref>\"Oasis.\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press.</ref> Due to problems securing an American contract, Oasis signed a worldwide contract with [[Sony]], which in turn licensed Oasis to Creation in the UK.<ref>Harris, pg. 131</ref>\nFollowing a limited white label release of the demo of their song \"Columbia\", Oasis went on a UK tour to promote the release of their first single, \"[[Supersonic (Oasis song)|Supersonic]]\", playing venues such as the Tunbridge Wells Forum, a converted public toilet. Supersonic was released in April 1994, reaching number&nbsp;31 in the charts.<ref>Harris, pg. 149</ref> The release was followed by \"[[Shakermaker]]\", which became the subject of a plagiarism suit, with Oasis paying $500,000 in damages. Their third single, \"[[Live Forever (Oasis song)|Live Forever]]\", was their first to enter the top ten of the UK charts. After troubled recording and mixing sessions, Oasis's debut album, ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'', was released on 29 August 1994, entering the charts at number one within a week of its release, and at the time becoming the fastest selling debut album in the UK.<ref>Harris, pg. 178</ref>\n\nNearly a year of constant live performances and recordings, along with a [[hedonistic]] lifestyle, were taking their toll on the band. This behaviour culminated during a gig in Los Angeles in September 1994, leading to an inept performance by Liam during which he made offensive remarks about American audiences and hit Noel with a [[tambourine]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Grundy|first=Gareth|title=Born To Feud|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/30/oasis-split-liam-noel-gallagher|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref>  The incident upset Noel to such an extent he temporarily quit the band and flew to San Francisco (it was from this incident the song \"[[Talk Tonight]]\" was written). He was tracked down by Creation's Tim Abbot and they made a trip to Las Vegas. Once there, the elder Gallagher was persuaded to continue with the band. He reconciled with Liam and the tour resumed in [[Minneapolis]].<ref>Harris, pg. 189</ref> The group followed up with the fourth single from ''Definitely Maybe'', \"[[Cigarettes & Alcohol]]\", and the Christmas single \"[[Whatever (Oasis song)|Whatever]]\", issued in December 1994 which entered the British charts at number three.<ref>Harris, pg. 213</ref>\n\n===1995\u20131996: ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'', international success, and peak popularity===\nOasis had their first UK number one single in April 1995 with \"[[Some Might Say]]\". At the same time, drummer Tony McCarroll was ousted from the band. McCarroll said, on leaving Oasis, that he was \"unlawfully expelled from the partnership\" for what he called a \"personality clash\" with the brothers. The Gallaghers, on the other hand, doubted McCarroll's musical ability, with Noel saying: \"I like Tony as a geezer but he wouldn't have been able to drum the new songs\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supanet.com/entertainment/music_feature/news/52861/Almost_famous.html|title=Supanet entertainment music feature|publisher=Supanet.com|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/288881.stm|title=\u00a3550,000 for sacked Oasis drummer|work=BBC News|date=3 March 1999|accessdate=3 February 2008}}</ref> McCarroll was replaced by [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]], formerly of [[Starclub]] and younger brother of renowned studio percussionist [[Steve White (drummer)|Steve White]] and recommended to Noel by [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]].

Previously, Oasis did not associate themselves with the Britpop movement and were not invited to perform on the [[BBC]]'s ''Britpop Now'' programme introduced by Blur singer Damon Albarn. On 14 August 1995, Blur and Oasis released singles on the same day, setting up the [[Britpop#\"The Battle of Britpop\"|\"Battle of Britpop\"]] that dominated the national news.<ref>{{cite news |title=When Blur beat Oasis in the battle of Britpop |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/only-in-britain/blur-beat-oasis-in-chart-battle/ |accessdate=17 September 2019 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref> Blur's \"[[Country House (song)|Country House]]\" outsold Oasis' \"[[Roll with It (Oasis song)|Roll with It]]\" 274,000 copies to 216,000 during the week.<ref>Harris, pg. 235</ref> Oasis' management came up with several reasons for this, claiming \"Country House\" sold more because it was less expensive (\u00a31.99 vs \u00a33.99) and because there were two versions of \"Country House\" with different B-sides, forcing serious fans to buy two copies.<ref>Harris, pg. 233</ref> An alternative explanation given at the time by Creation was that there were problems associated with the barcode on the \"Roll with It\" single case, which did not record all sales.<ref>Author unknown. \"Cockney revels\".

Quarrels between the Gallagher brothers plagued the recording sessions. ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' was released in August 1997. Preceded by the UK number&nbsp;one single \"[[D'You Know What I Mean?]]\", the album was their most anticipated effort, and as such became the subject of considerable media attention. By the end of the first day of release, ''Be Here Now'' had sold 424,000 units and by the end of business on Saturday of that week sales had reached 696,000, making it the fastest-selling album in British history.<ref>Harris, pg. 342.</ref> The album debuted at number&nbsp;two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the US, but its first week sales of 152,000\u2014below expected sales of 400,000 copies\u2014were considered a disappointment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5924518/live_forever|title=Rolling Stone news article|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref> Predominantly written by Noel Gallagher during a holiday with [[Kate Moss]], [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Mick Jagger]], Gallagher has since expressed regret over the writing process of ''Be Here Now'', adding it doesn\u2019t match up to the standard of the band\u2019s first two albums;\n\n{{quote|In the studio it was great, and on the day it came out it was great.

However, long-time drummer Alan White, who at this time had played on nearly all of the band's material, left the band in early January 2004.

The song features the singer Erika Shevon, and was produced by [[The Legendary Traxster]]. It is sometimes referred to as the second part to the song \"[[Get It Wet]]\" off his 1997 album ''[[Adrenaline Rush (album)|Adrenaline Rush]]'' due its similarities. It was released as a digital download on February 24, 2009. The radio version is remixed. The song contains elements from [[Janet Jackson]]'s 1994 hit \"[[Any Time, Any Place]]\". It is a straightforward [[slow jam]], with Shevon's vocal chorus punctuating Twista's two verses. The 'calling you daddy' section serves as both an intro and outro. There is a freestyle by [[Lil Wayne]] & Shanell called \"Wayne On Me\" from Wayne's 2009 mixtape ''[[No Ceilings]]''. This song is Twista's highest-charting single since ''[[Girl Tonite]]'' ([[2005 in music|2005]]).\n\n==Formats and track listing==\n'''Promo CD single'''\n#\"Wetter\" (Squeaky Clean Version) <small>(featuring Erika Shevon)</small> - 4:18\n#\"Wetter\" (Clean Version) <small>(featuring Erika Shevon)</small> - 4:18\n#\"Wetter\" (Explicit Version) <small>(featuring Erika Shevon)</small> - 4:18\n#\"Wetter\" (Instrumental) - 4:18\n#\"Wetter\" (Acapella) <small>(featuring Erika Shevon)</small> - 4:16\n\n'''Digital single'''\n#\"Wetter\" <small>(featuring Erika Shevon)</small> - 4:16\n#\"Wetter\" (Radio Version) <small>(featuring Erika Shevon)</small> - 4:16\n#\"Wetter\" (Instrumental Version) <small>(featuring Erika Shevon)</small> - 4:16\n\n==Charts==\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (2009)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]<ref name=\"Billboard\">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=twista|chart=all}}|title=Artist Chart History - Twista - Singles|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|44\n|-\n|U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]]<ref name=\"Billboard\"/>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n|-\n|U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Rap Songs]]<ref name=\"Billboard\"/>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (2009)\n!Position\n|-\n|US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (''Billboard'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2009/hot-r-and-and-b-hip-hop-songs|title=Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs \u2013 Year-End 2009|work=Billboard|accessdate=2020-02-06}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n|}\n\n===Certifications===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
