[[Hadji Khalfa]] (1609-1657) wrote that during the mid seventeenth century the nahiya (sub-district) of Bilisht was populated by a mixed [[Albanians|Albanian]] and [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] population and the Christian element was declining due to local disturbances and [[Islamization of Albania#Southern Albania|inhabitants converting to Islam]].<ref name=\"Gyuzelev67\"/> In the early nineteenth century, the ethnic border between Albanians and the neighbouring Slavic (Bulgarian) population ran close and to the east of Bilisht.<ref name=\"Gyuzelev67\"/> Between 1805-1807, the British traveller [[William Martin Leake]] passed through the area, referred to the ethnic border and stated that the people of Bilisht spoke [[Albanian language|Albanian]].<ref name=\"Gyuzelev67\">{{cite

This causes the cell membrane to temporarily depolarize (lose its electrical charge) forming the basis of action potentials.\n\nThe sodium ions in the ECF also play an important role in the movement of water from one body compartment to the other. When tears are secreted, or saliva is formed, sodium ions are pumped from the ECF into the ducts in which these fluids are formed and collected.

Since the [[Homeostasis#Extracellular fluid pH|pH of the ECF is directly dependent on the partial pressure of carbon dioxide]] in the ECF, [[hyperventilation]], which lowers the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the ECF, produces symptoms that are almost indistinguishable from low plasma ionized calcium concentrations.<ref name=macefield />\n\nThe extracellular fluid is constantly \"stirred\" by the [[circulatory system]], which ensures that the [[Milieu int\u00e9rieur|watery environment]] which bathes the body's cells is virtually identical throughout the body. This means that nutrients can be secreted into the ECF in one place (e.g. the gut, liver, or fat cells) and will, within about a minute, be evenly distributed throughout the body. Hormones are similarly rapidly and evenly spread to every cell in the body, regardless of where they are secreted into the blood. Oxygen taken up by the lungs from the alveolar air is also evenly distributed at the [[Respiratory system#Gas exchange|correct partial pressure]] to all the cells of the body. Waste products are also uniformly spread to the whole of the ECF, and are removed from this general circulation at specific points (or organs), once again ensuring that there is generally no localized accumulation of unwanted compounds or excesses of otherwise essential substances (e.g. sodium ions, or any of the other constituents of the ECF). The only significant exception to this general principle is the plasma in the [[vein]]s, where the concentrations of dissolved substances in individual veins differ, to varying degrees, from those in the rest of the ECF. However, this plasma is confined within the waterproof walls of the venous tubes, and therefore does not affect the interstitial fluid in which the body's cells live. When the blood from all the veins in the body mixes in the heart and lungs, the differing compositions cancel out (e.g. acidic blood from active muscles is neutralized by the alkaline blood [[Homeostasis#Extracellular fluid pH|homeostatically]] produced by the kidneys). From the [[Atrium (heart)|left atrium]] onward, to every organ in the body, the normal, homeostatically regulated values of all of the ECF's components are therefore restored.\n\n==Interaction between the blood plasma, interstitial fluid and lymph==\n{{Further |Starling equation |Microcirculation#Capillary exchange}}\n[[File:Capillary microcirculation.svg|thumb|Formation of interstitial fluid from blood.]]\n[[File:Illu lymph capillary.png|thumb |Diagram showing the formation of lymph from interstitial fluid (labeled here as \"Tissue fluid\"). The tissue fluid is entering the blind ends of [[lymph capillaries]] (shown as deep green arrows)]]\nThe arterial blood plasma, interstitial fluid and lymph interact at the level of the blood [[capillary|capillaries]]. The capillaries are [[Vascular permeability|permeable]] and water can move freely in and out. At the [[arteriole|arteriolar end]] of the capillary the blood pressure is greater than the [[Hydrostatics#Medicine|hydrostatic pressure]] in the tissues.<ref name=\"Guyton\">{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=John | name-list-format = vanc |title=Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology|date=2011|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-1-4160-4574-8|pages=177\u2013181|edition=12th}}</ref><ref name=tortora /> Water will therefore seep out of the capillary into the interstitial fluid. The pores through which this water moves are large enough to allow all the smaller molecules (up to the size of small proteins such as [[insulin]]) to move freely through the capillary wall as well. This means that their concentrations across the capillary wall equalize, and therefore have no osmotic effect (because the osmotic pressure caused by these small molecules and ions \u2013 called the [[Crystalloid solution|crystalloid osmotic pressure]] to distinguish it from the osmotic effect of the larger molecules that cannot move across the capillary membrane \u2013 is the same on both sides of capillary wall).<ref name=\"Guyton\" /><ref name=tortora />\n\nThe movement of water out of the capillary at the arteriolar end causes the concentration of the substances that cannot cross the capillary wall to increase as the blood moves to the [[Venule|venular]] end of the capillary. The most important substances that are confined to the capillary tube are [[Serum albumin|plasma albumin]], the [[Globulin|plasma globulins]] and [[fibrinogen]]. They, and particularly the plasma albumin, because of its molecular abundance in the plasma, are responsible for the so-called [[Oncotic pressure|\"oncotic\" or \"colloid\" osmotic pressure]] which draws water back into the capillary, especially at the venular end.<ref name=\"Guyton\" />\n\nThe net effect of all of these processes is that water moves out of and back into the capillary, while the crystalloid substances in the capillary and interstitial fluids equilibrate. Since the capillary fluid is constantly and rapidly renewed by the flow of the blood, its composition dominates the equilibrium concentration that is achieved in the capillary bed. This ensures that the [[Milieu int\u00e9rieur|watery environment]] of the body's cells is always close to their ideal environment (set by the body's [[Homeostasis|homeostats]]).\n\nA small proportion of the solution that leaks out of the capillaries is not drawn back into the capillary by the colloid osmotic forces. This amounts to between 2-4 liters per day for the body as a whole. This water is collected by the [[Lymphatic vessel|lymphatic system]] and is ultimately discharged into the left [[subclavian vein]], where it mixes with the venous blood coming from the left arm, on its way to the heart.<ref name=tortora /> The [[lymph]] flows through [[Lymph capillary|lymph capillaries]] to [[lymph node]]s where bacteria and tissue debris are removed from the lymph, while various types of [[white blood cells]] (mainly [[lymphocytes]]) are added to the fluid.

The only significant exception to this general principle is the plasma in the [[vein]]s, where the concentrations of dissolved substances in individual veins differ, to varying degrees, from those in the rest of the ECF. However, this plasma is confined within the waterproof walls of the venous tubes, and therefore does not affect the interstitial fluid in which the body's cells live. When the blood from all the veins in the body mixes in the heart and lungs, the differing compositions cancel out (e.g. acidic blood from active muscles is neutralized by the alkaline blood [[Homeostasis#Extracellular fluid pH|homeostatically]] produced by the kidneys). From the [[Atrium (heart)|left atrium]] onward, to every organ in the body, the normal, homeostatically regulated values of all of the ECF's components are therefore restored.\n\n==Interaction between the blood plasma, interstitial fluid and lymph==\n{{Further |Starling equation |Microcirculation#Capillary exchange}}\n[[File:Capillary microcirculation.svg|thumb|Formation of interstitial fluid from blood.]]\n[[File:Illu lymph capillary.png|thumb |Diagram showing the formation of lymph from interstitial fluid (labeled here as \"Tissue fluid\"). The tissue fluid is entering the blind ends of [[lymph capillaries]] (shown as deep green arrows)]]\nThe arterial blood plasma, interstitial fluid and lymph interact at the level of the blood [[capillary|capillaries]]. The capillaries are [[Vascular permeability|permeable]] and water can move freely in and out. At the [[arteriole|arteriolar end]] of the capillary the blood pressure is greater than the [[Hydrostatics#Medicine|hydrostatic pressure]] in the tissues.<ref name=\"Guyton\">{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=John | name-list-format = vanc |title=Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology|date=2011|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-1-4160-4574-8|pages=177\u2013181|edition=12th}}</ref><ref name=tortora /> Water will therefore seep out of the capillary into the interstitial fluid. The pores through which this water moves are large enough to allow all the smaller molecules (up to the size of small proteins such as [[insulin]]) to move freely through the capillary wall as well. This means that their concentrations across the capillary wall equalize, and therefore have no osmotic effect (because the osmotic pressure caused by these small molecules and ions \u2013 called the [[Crystalloid solution|crystalloid osmotic pressure]] to distinguish it from the osmotic effect of the larger molecules that cannot move across the capillary membrane \u2013 is the same on both sides of capillary wall).<ref name=\"Guyton\" /><ref name=tortora />\n\nThe movement of water out of the capillary at the arteriolar end causes the concentration of the substances that cannot cross the capillary wall to increase as the blood moves to the [[Venule|venular]] end of the capillary. The most important substances that are confined to the capillary tube are [[Serum albumin|plasma albumin]], the [[Globulin|plasma globulins]] and [[fibrinogen]]. They, and particularly the plasma albumin, because of its molecular abundance in the plasma, are responsible for the so-called [[Oncotic pressure|\"oncotic\" or \"colloid\" osmotic pressure]] which draws water back into the capillary, especially at the venular end.<ref name=\"Guyton\" />\n\nThe net effect of all of these processes is that water moves out of and back into the capillary, while the crystalloid substances in the capillary and interstitial fluids equilibrate. Since the capillary fluid is constantly and rapidly renewed by the flow of the blood, its composition dominates the equilibrium concentration that is achieved in the capillary bed. This ensures that the [[Milieu int\u00e9rieur|watery environment]] of the body's cells is always close to their ideal environment (set by the body's [[Homeostasis|homeostats]]).\n\nA small proportion of the solution that leaks out of the capillaries is not drawn back into the capillary by the colloid osmotic forces. This amounts to between 2-4 liters per day for the body as a whole. This water is collected by the [[Lymphatic vessel|lymphatic system]] and is ultimately discharged into the left [[subclavian vein]], where it mixes with the venous blood coming from the left arm, on its way to the heart.<ref name=tortora /> The [[lymph]] flows through [[Lymph capillary|lymph capillaries]] to [[lymph node]]s where bacteria and tissue debris are removed from the lymph, while various types of [[white blood cells]] (mainly [[lymphocytes]]) are added to the fluid. In addition the lymph which drains the small intestine contains fat droplets called [[chylomicron]]s after the ingestion of a fatty meal.<ref name=stryer /> This lymph is called [[chyle]] which has a milky appearance, and imparts the name [[lacteal]]s (referring to the milky appearance of their contents) to the lymph vessels of the small intestine.<ref name=grays>{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Peter L |last2=Warwick |first2=Roger |last3=Dyson|first3=Mary |last4=Bannister |first4=Lawrence H. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Gray's Anatomy| pages=821 |location=Edinburgh|publisher=Churchill Livingstone | edition=Thirty-seventh |date=1989|isbn= 0443-041776 }}</ref>\n\nExtracellular fluid may be mechanically guided in this circulation by the vesicles between other structures.
