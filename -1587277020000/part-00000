The ''Einsatzgruppen'' were involved in the murder of much of the [[intelligentsia]], including members of the [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|priesthood]]{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=4}} and cultural elite of Poland, and had an integral role in the implementation of the so-called \"[[Final Solution]] to the [[Jewish Question]]\" (''Die Endl\u00f6sung der Judenfrage'') in territories conquered by Nazi Germany. Almost all of the people they killed were civilians, beginning with the intelligentsia and swiftly progressing to Soviet [[political commissar]]s, [[Jew]]s, and [[Romani people]] as well as actual or alleged [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] throughout Eastern Europe.\n\nUnder the direction of ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] and the supervision of SS-''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]], the ''Einsatzgruppen'' operated in territories occupied by the [[Wehrmacht]] (German armed forces) following the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 and the [[invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941. The ''Einsatzgruppen'' worked hand-in-hand with the [[Order Police battalions]] on the Eastern Front to carry out operations ranging from the murder of a few people to operations which lasted over two or more days, such as the massacre at [[Babi Yar]] with 33,771 Jews killed in two days, and the [[Rumbula massacre]] (with about 25,000 killed in two days of shooting). As ordered by Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler]], the Wehrmacht cooperated with the ''Einsatzgruppen'', providing logistical support for their operations, and participated in the mass killings. Historian [[Raul Hilberg]] estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the ''Einsatzgruppen'', related agencies, and foreign auxiliary personnel killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million of the 5.5 to 6 million Jews murdered during the [[Holocaust]].\n\nAfter the close of World War II, 24 senior leaders of the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were prosecuted in the [[Einsatzgruppen trial]] in 1947\u201348, charged with [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crimes]]. Fourteen death sentences and two life sentences were handed out. Four additional ''Einsatzgruppe'' leaders were later tried and executed by other nations.\n\n== Formation and Aktion T4 ==\nThe ''Einsatzgruppen'' were formed under the direction of SS-''Obergruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and operated by the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) before and during [[World War II]].{{sfn|Edeiken|2000}} The ''Einsatzgruppen'' had their origins in the ad hoc ''Einsatzkommando'' formed by Heydrich to secure government buildings and documents following the ''[[Anschluss]]'' in [[Austria]] in March 1938.{{sfn|Streim|1989|p=436}} Originally part of the ''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' (Security Police; SiPo), two units of ''Einsatzgruppen'' were stationed in the [[Sudetenland]] in October 1938. When military action turned out not to be necessary due to the [[Munich Agreement]], the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents. They also secured government buildings, questioned senior civil servants, and arrested as many as 10,000 Czech communists and German citizens.{{sfn|Streim|1989|p=436}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=405, 412}} From September 1939, the ''[[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]'' (Reich Main Security Office; RSHA) had overall command of the ''Einsatzgruppen''.{{sfn|Nuremberg Trial, Vol. 20, Day 194}}\n\nAs part of the drive by the Nazi regime to remove so-called \"undesirable\" elements from the German population, from September to December 1939 the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and others took part in [[Action T4]], a program of systematic murder of persons with physical and mental disabilities and patients of psychiatric hospitals. Aktion T4 mainly took place from 1939 to 1941, but the killings continued until the end of the war. Initially the victims were shot by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and others, but [[gas chamber]]s were put into use by spring 1940.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=138\u2013141}}\n\n== Invasion of Poland ==\n{{main|Intelligenzaktion|Operation Tannenberg}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1968-034-19A, Exekution von polnischen Geiseln.jpg|thumb|Execution of Poles in [[K\u00f3rnik]], 20 October 1939]]\n[[File:Palmiry ostatnia droga.jpeg|thumb|Polish women led to mass execution in a forest near [[Palmiry massacre|Palmiry]]]]\nIn response to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s plan to [[invasion of Poland|invade Poland]] on 1 September 1939, Heydrich re-formed the ''Einsatzgruppen'' to travel in the wake of the German armies.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=425}} Membership at this point was drawn from the SS, the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (Security Service; SD), the police, and the [[Gestapo]].{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=144}}{{sfn|Rossino|2003|p=11}} Heydrich placed SS-''Obergruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Werner Best]] in command, who assigned {{ill|Hans-Joachim Tesmer|de}} to choose personnel for the task forces and their subgroups, called ''[[Einsatzkommando]]s'', from among educated people with military experience and a strong ideological commitment to Nazism.{{sfn|Rossino|2003|pp=11, 20}} Some had previously been members of paramilitary groups such as the ''[[Freikorps]]''.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=17}} Heydrich instructed Wagner in meetings in late July that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' should undertake their operations in cooperation with the ''[[Ordnungspolizei]]'' (Order Police; Orpo) and military commanders in the area.{{sfn|Rossino|2003|p=14}} Army intelligence was in constant contact with ''Einsatzgruppen'' to coordinate their activities with other units.{{sfn|Rossino|2003|p=17}}\n\nInitially numbering 2,700 men (and ultimately 4,250 in Poland),{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=17}}{{sfn|Rossino|2003|p=12}} the ''Einsatzgruppen''{{'}}s mission was to kill members of the Polish leadership most clearly identified with Polish national identity: the intelligentsia, [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|members of the clergy]], teachers, and members of the nobility.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=144}}{{sfn|Browning|Matth\u00e4us|2004|pp=16\u201318}} As stated by Hitler: \"...&nbsp;there must be no Polish leaders; where Polish leaders exist they must be killed, however harsh that sounds\".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=143}} SS-''[[Brigadef\u00fchrer]]'' [[Lothar Beutel]], commander of ''Einsatzgruppe'' IV, later testified that Heydrich gave the order for these killings at a series of meetings in mid-August.{{sfn|Rossino|2003|p=15}} The ''[[Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen]]'' \u2014 lists of people to be killed \u2014 had been drawn up by the SS as early as May 1939, using dossiers collected by the SD from 1936 forward.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=144}}{{sfn|Rossino|2003|p=16}} The ''Einsatzgruppen'' performed these murders with the support of the ''[[Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz]]'', a paramilitary group consisting of ethnic Germans living in Poland.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=144\u2013145}} Members of the SS, the [[Wehrmacht]], and the ''Ordnungspolizei'' also shot civilians during the Polish campaign.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=429}} Approximately 65,000 civilians were killed by the end of 1939. In addition to leaders of Polish society, they killed Jews, prostitutes, [[Romani people]], and the mentally ill. Psychiatric patients in Poland were initially killed by shooting, but by spring 1941 [[Nazi gas van|gas van]]s were widely used.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=15}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=430\u2013432}}\n\nSeven ''Einsatzgruppen'' of battalion strength (around 500 men) operated in Poland.

However, Hitler had decreed that the army would have to tolerate and even offer logistical support to the ''Einsatzgruppen'' when it was tactically possible to do so. Some army commanders complained about unauthorised shootings, looting, and rapes committed by members of the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and the ''Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz'', to little effect.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=146}} For example, when ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Johannes Blaskowitz]] sent a memorandum of complaint to Hitler about the atrocities, Hitler dismissed his concerns as \"childish\", and Blaskowitz was relieved of his post in May 1940.

As this method proved too slow, the ''Einsatzkommandos'' began to take their victims out in larger groups and shot them next to, or even inside, mass graves that had been prepared.

Jeckeln selected a site about {{convert|10|km}} southeast of Riga near the Rumbula railway station, and had 300 Russian prisoners of war prepare the site by digging pits in which to bury the victims. Jeckeln organised around 1,700 men, including 300 members of the ''Arajs Kommando'', 50 German SD men, and 50 Latvian guards, most of whom had already participated in mass killings of civilians. These troops were supplemented by Latvians, including members of the Riga city police, battalion police, and ghetto guards. Around 1,500 able-bodied Jews would be spared execution so their slave labour could be exploited; a thousand men were relocated to a fenced-off area within the ghetto and 500 women were temporarily housed in a prison and later moved to a separate nearby ghetto, where they were put to work mending uniforms.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=206\u2013209}}\n\nAlthough Rumbula was on the rail line, Jeckeln decided that the victims should travel on foot from Riga to the execution ground.

The first day of executions, 30 November 1941, began with the perpetrators rousing and assembling the victims at 4:00&nbsp;am.

Here the victims were split into groups of fifty and taken deeper into the forest, near the pits, where they were ordered to strip. The victims were driven into the prepared trenches, made to lie down, and shot in the head or the back of the neck by members of Jeckeln's bodyguard. Around 13,000 Jews from Riga were killed at the pits that day, along with a thousand Jews from Berlin who had just arrived by train. On the second day of the operation, 8 December 1941, the remaining 10,000 Jews of Riga were killed in the same way. About a thousand were killed on the streets of the city or on the way to the site, bringing the total deaths for the two-day extermination to 25,000 people. For his part in organising the massacre, Jeckeln was promoted to Leader of the SS Upper Section, [[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]].{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=210\u2013214}}\n\n== Second sweep ==\n''Einsatzgruppe B, C'', and ''D'' did not immediately follow ''Einsatzgruppe'' A's example in systematically killing all Jews in their areas. The ''Einsatzgruppe'' commanders, with the exception of ''Einsatzgruppe'' A's Stahlecker, were of the opinion by the fall of 1941 that it was impossible to kill the entire Jewish population of the Soviet Union in one sweep, and thought the killings should stop.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=342}} An ''Einsatzgruppe'' report dated 17 September advised that the Germans would be better off using any skilled Jews as labourers rather than shooting them.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=342}} Also, in some areas poor weather and a lack of transportation led to a slowdown in deportations of Jews from points further west.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=549}} Thus, an interval passed between the first round of ''Einsatzgruppen'' massacres in summer and fall, and what American historian [[Raul Hilberg]] called the second sweep, which started in December 1941 and lasted into the summer of 1942.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|pp=342\u2013343}} During the interval, the surviving Jews were forced into ghettos.{{sfn|Marrus|2000|p=64}}\n\n''Einsatzgruppe'' A had already murdered almost all Jews in its area, so it shifted its operations into Belarus to assist ''Einsatzgruppe'' B. In [[Dnepropetrovsk]] in February 1942, ''Einsatzgruppe'' D reduced the city's Jewish population from 30,000 to 702 over the course of four days.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=372}} The German Order Police and local collaborators provided the extra manpower needed to perform all the shootings. Haberer wrote that, as in the Baltic states, the Germans could not have killed so many Jews so quickly without local help. He points out that the ratio of Order Police to auxiliaries was 1 to 10 in both Ukraine and Belarus. In rural areas the proportion was 1 to 20. This meant that most Ukrainian and Belarusian Jews were killed by fellow Ukrainians and Belarusians commanded by German officers rather than by Germans.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=78}}\n\nThe second wave of exterminations in the Soviet Union met with armed resistance in some areas, though the chance of success was poor. Weapons were typically primitive or home-made. Communications were impossible between ghettos in various cities, so there was no way to create a unified strategy. Few in the ghetto leadership supported resistance for fear of reprisals on the ghetto residents. Mass break-outs were sometimes attempted, though survival in the forest was nearly impossible due to the lack of food and the fact that escapees were often tracked down and killed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=353\u2013354}}\n\n== Transition to gassing ==\n{{see also|Final Solution}}\n\n[[File:Chelmno Gas Van.jpg|thumb|[[Magirus-Deutz]] van found near [[Che\u0142mno extermination camp]] is the same type as those used as [[Nazi gas van|gas van]]s. ]]\nAfter a time, Himmler found that the killing methods used by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were inefficient: they were costly, demoralising for the troops, and sometimes did not kill the victims quickly enough.{{sfn|Rees|1997|p=197}} Many of the troops found the massacres to be difficult if not impossible to perform. Some of the perpetrators suffered physical and mental health problems, and many turned to drink.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=52, 124, 168}} As much as possible, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders militarized the genocide. The historian Christian Ingrao notes an attempt was made to make the shootings a collective act without individual responsibility. Framing the shootings in this way was not psychologically sufficient for every perpetrator to feel absolved of guilt.{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|pp=199\u2014200}} Browning notes three categories of potential perpetrators: those who were eager to participate right from the start, those who participated in spite of moral qualms because they were ordered to do so, and a significant minority who refused to take part.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=163}} A few men spontaneously became excessively brutal in their killing methods and their zeal for the task. Commander of ''Einsatzgruppe'' D, SS-''Gruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Otto Ohlendorf]], particularly noted this propensity towards excess, and ordered that any man who was too eager to participate or too brutal should not perform any further executions.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=165\u2013166}}\n\nDuring a visit to [[Minsk]] in August 1941, Himmler witnessed an ''Einsatzgruppen'' mass execution first-hand and concluded that shooting Jews was too stressful for his men.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=547\u2013548}} By November he made arrangements for any SS men suffering ill health from having participated in executions to be provided with rest and mental health care.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=167}} He also decided a transition should be made to gassing the victims, especially the women and children, and ordered the recruitment of expendable native auxiliaries who could assist with the murders.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=167}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=551}} Gas vans, which had been used previously to kill mental patients, began to see service by all four main ''Einsatzgruppen'' from 1942.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=548}} However, the gas vans were not popular with the ''Einsatzkommandos'', because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them was a horrible ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=243}} Some of the early mass killings at [[extermination camp]]s used carbon monoxide fumes produced by diesel engines, similar to the method used in gas vans, but by as early as September 1941 experiments were begun at [[Auschwitz]] using [[Zyklon B]], a cyanide-based pesticide gas.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=280\u2013281}}\n\nPlans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europe\u2014eleven million people\u2014were formalised at the [[Wannsee Conference]], held on 20 January 1942. Some would be [[Extermination through labor|worked to death]], and the rest would be killed in the implementation of the [[Final Solution]] of the [[Jewish question]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Die Endl\u00f6sung der Judenfrage}}).{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=555\u2013556}} Permanent killing centres at Auschwitz, [[Belzec]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]], [[Treblinka]], and other Nazi extermination camps replaced mobile death squads as the primary method of mass killing.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=279\u2013280}} The ''Einsatzgruppen'' remained active, however, and were put to work fighting partisans, particularly in Belarus.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=248}}\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Stalingrad|fall of Stalingrad]] in February 1943, Himmler realised that Germany would likely lose the war, and ordered the formation of a special task force, [[Sonderaktion 1005|''Sonderkommando'' 1005]], under SS-''Standartenf\u00fchrer'' [[Paul Blobel]]. The unit's assignment was to visit mass graves all along the [[Eastern Front of World War II|Eastern Front]] to exhume bodies and burn them in an attempt to cover up the genocide. The task remained unfinished at the end of the war, and many mass graves remain unmarked and unexcavated.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=258\u2013260, 262}}\n\nBy 1944 the Red Army had begun to push the German forces out of Eastern Europe, and the ''Einsatzgruppen'' retreated alongside the Wehrmacht. By late 1944, most ''Einsatzgruppen'' personnel had been folded into Waffen-SS combat units or transferred to permanent death camps. Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and related agencies killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=257}} The total number of Jews murdered during the war is estimated at 5.5 to six million people.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=318}}\n\n== Plans for the Middle East and Britain ==\n[[Einsatzgruppe Egypt|''Einsatzgruppe'' Egypt]], led by [[Walter Rauff]], was raised in 1942 and standing by in [[Athens]], prepared to enter Egypt and Palestine once German forces arrived there.\n\nAccording to historians [[Klaus-Michael Mallmann]] and {{ill|Martin C\u00fcppers|de|}}, based on archival research, the units purpose was to carry out a mass killing of the [[Jew]]ish population in [[Mandatory Palestine|British mandate of Palestine]] and [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], similar to the way the [[Einsatzgruppe]]n operated in [[eastern Europe]]. Despite the word \"Palestine\" never being mentioned in the archival documents, the researchers state that the unit's objective was to go there in order to enact systematic mass murder of Jews.<ref>[[Klaus-Michael Mallmann]], [[Martin C\u00fcppers]]: \u201eBeseitigung der j\u00fcdisch-nationalen Heimst\u00e4tte in Pal\u00e4stina.\u201c Das Einsatzkommando bei der Panzerarmee Afrika 1942.

The men were charged with [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], and membership in the SS (which had been declared a criminal organization). Fourteen death sentences and two life sentences were among the judgments; only four executions were carried out, on 7 June 1951; the rest were reduced to lesser sentences. Four additional ''Einsatzgruppe'' leaders were later tried and executed by other nations.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=274\u2013275}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J08517, Otto Ohlendorf.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Otto Ohlendorf]], 1943]]\n\nSeveral ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders, including Ohlendorf, claimed at the trial to have received an order before Operation Barbarossa requiring them to murder all Soviet Jews.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=187}} To date no evidence has been found that such an order was ever issued.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=187\u2013189}} German prosecutor Alfred Streim noted that if such an order had been given, post-war courts would only have been able to convict the ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders as ''accomplices'' to mass murder. However, if it could be established that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' had committed mass murder without orders, then they could have been convicted as ''perpetrators'' of mass murder, and hence could have received stiffer sentences, including capital punishment.{{sfn|Streim|1989|p=439}}\n\nStreim postulated that the existence of an early comprehensive order was a fabrication created for use in Ohlendorf's defence. This theory is now widely accepted by historians.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=188}} Longerich notes that most orders received by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders\u2014especially when they were being ordered to carry out criminal activities\u2014were vague, and couched in terminology that had a specific meaning for members of the regime. Leaders were given briefings about the need to be \"severe\" and \"firm\"; all Jews were to be viewed as potential enemies that had to be dealt with ruthlessly.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=189\u2013190}} British historian Sir [[Ian Kershaw]] argues that Hitler's apocalyptic remarks before Barbarossa about the necessity for a war without mercy to \"annihilate\" the forces of \"Judeo-Bolshevism\" were interpreted by ''Einsatzgruppen'' commanders as permission and encouragement to engage in extreme antisemitic violence, with each ''Einsatzgruppen'' commander to use his own discretion about how far he was prepared to go.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\nMost of the perpetrators of Nazi war crimes were never charged, and returned unremarked to civilian life. The West German Central Prosecution Office of Nazi War Criminals only charged about a hundred former ''Einsatzgruppe'' members with war crimes.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=275\u2013276}} And as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions; witnesses grew older and were less likely to be able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, and the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.{{sfn|Segev|2010|pp=226, 250, 376}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Functionalism versus intentionalism]]\n* [[Glossary of Nazi Germany]]\n* [[List of Nazi Party leaders and officials]]\n* [[Myth of the clean Wehrmacht]]\n* [[Porajmos]]\n* [[Special Organization (Ottoman Empire)]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Explanatory notes ===\n{{notelist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book | last = Browning | first = Christopher R. | title = Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland | publisher = Penguin | location = London; New York | orig-year = 1992 | year = 1998 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Browning | first1 = Christopher | author-link = Christopher Browning | last2 = Matth\u00e4us | first2 = J\u00fcrgen | authorlink2 = J\u00fcrgen Matth\u00e4us | title = The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939 \u2013 March 1942 | series = Comprehensive History of the Holocaust | publisher = University of Nebraska Press | location = Lincoln | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-8032-1327-2 | ref = harv | url = https://archive.org/details/originsoffinalso00brow }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Caron | first1 = Jean-Christophe | title = Erwin Rommel: Auf der Jagd nach dem Schatz des \"W\u00fcstenfuchses\" | page = 2 | journal = Spiegel Online | date = 22 December 2007 | language = German | url = http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/erwin-rommel-auf-der-jagd-nach-dem-schatz-des-wuestenfuchses-a-522484-2.html | accessdate = 9 September 2016 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Conze | first1 = Eckart | last2 = Frei | first2 = Norbert | last3 = Hayes | first3 = Peter | last4 = Zimmermann | first4 = Moshe | title = Das Amt und die Vergangenheit : deutsche Diplomaten im Dritten Reich und in der Bundesrepublik | year = 2010 | publisher = Karl Blessing | location = Munich | language = German | isbn = 978-3-89667-430-2 | ref = {{sfnRef|Conze, Frei et al.|2010}} }}\n* {{cite book | last = Craig | first = William | authorlink = William Craig (author) | title = Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad | year = 1973 | publisher = Konecky & Konecky | location = Old Saybrook, CT | isbn = 978-1-56852-368-2 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Crowe | first = David | title = Oskar Schindler: The Untold Account of his Life, Wartime Activities and the True Story Behind the List | year = 2007 | origyear = 2004 | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-465-00253-5 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Dams | first1 = Carsten | last2 = Stolle | first2 = Michael | title = Die Gestapo: Herrschaft und Terror im Dritten Reich | series = Becksche Reihe | year = 2012 | origyear = 2008 | language = German | publisher = Beck | location = Munich | isbn = 978-3-406-62898-6 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite web | last = Edeiken | first = Yale F. | publisher = Holocaust History Project | title = Introduction to the Einsatzgruppen | date = 22 August 2000 | url = http://www.holocaust-history.org/intro-einsatz/ | accessdate= 10 June 2018 | ref = harv | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151007085553/http://www.holocaust-history.org/intro-einsatz/ | archive-date = 7 October 2015}}\n* {{cite book | title = Trials of War Criminals before the Nuernberg Military Tribunals under Control Council Law No. 10 | location = N\u00fcrnberg | date = October 1946 \u2013 April 1949 | volume =Volume 4 | series = Green Series | chapter = Einsatzgruppen case | chapter-url = https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/NT_war-criminals_Vol-IV.pdf | url = https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/NTs_war-criminals.html | format = PDF | accessdate = 10 June 2018 | ref = {{sfnRef|Einsatzgruppen judgment}} }}\n* {{cite book | last = Evans | first = Richard J. | authorlink = Richard J.

The ''Einsatzgruppen'' were involved in the murder of much of the [[intelligentsia]], including members of the [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|priesthood]]{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=4}} and cultural elite of Poland, and had an integral role in the implementation of the so-called \"[[Final Solution]] to the [[Jewish Question]]\" (''Die Endl\u00f6sung der Judenfrage'') in territories conquered by Nazi Germany. Almost all of the people they killed were civilians, beginning with the intelligentsia and swiftly progressing to Soviet [[political commissar]]s, [[Jew]]s, and [[Romani people]] as well as actual or alleged [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] throughout Eastern Europe.\n\nUnder the direction of ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] and the supervision of SS-''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]], the ''Einsatzgruppen'' operated in territories occupied by the [[Wehrmacht]] (German armed forces) following the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 and the [[invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941. The ''Einsatzgruppen'' worked hand-in-hand with the [[Order Police battalions]] on the Eastern Front to carry out operations ranging from the murder of a few people to operations which lasted over two or more days, such as the massacre at [[Babi Yar]] with 33,771 Jews killed in two days, and the [[Rumbula massacre]] (with about 25,000 killed in two days of shooting). As ordered by Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler]], the Wehrmacht cooperated with the ''Einsatzgruppen'', providing logistical support for their operations, and participated in the mass killings. Historian [[Raul Hilberg]] estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the ''Einsatzgruppen'', related agencies, and foreign auxiliary personnel killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million of the 5.5 to 6 million Jews murdered during the [[Holocaust]].\n\nAfter the close of World War II, 24 senior leaders of the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were prosecuted in the [[Einsatzgruppen trial]] in 1947\u201348, charged with [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crimes]]. Fourteen death sentences and two life sentences were handed out. Four additional ''Einsatzgruppe'' leaders were later tried and executed by other nations.\n\n== Formation and Aktion T4 ==\nThe ''Einsatzgruppen'' were formed under the direction of SS-''Obergruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and operated by the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) before and during [[World War II]].{{sfn|Edeiken|2000}} The ''Einsatzgruppen'' had their origins in the ad hoc ''Einsatzkommando'' formed by Heydrich to secure government buildings and documents following the ''[[Anschluss]]'' in [[Austria]] in March 1938.{{sfn|Streim|1989|p=436}} Originally part of the ''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' (Security Police; SiPo), two units of ''Einsatzgruppen'' were stationed in the [[Sudetenland]] in October 1938. When military action turned out not to be necessary due to the [[Munich Agreement]], the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents.

Aktion T4 mainly took place from 1939 to 1941, but the killings continued until the end of the war.

The Germans relied increasingly on the ''Ar\u0101js Kommando'' and similar groups to perform massacres of Jews.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=70}}\n\nSuch extensive and enthusiastic collaboration with the ''Einsatzgruppen'' has been attributed to several factors. Since the [[1905 Russian Revolution|Russian Revolution of 1905]], the [[Kresy|''Kresy Wschodnie'']] and other borderlands had experienced a political culture of violence.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=73}} The period of Soviet rule had been profoundly traumatic for residents of the Baltic states and areas that had been part of Poland until 1939; the population was brutalised and terrorised by the imposed Soviet rule, and the existing familiar structures of society were destroyed.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n[[File:Liepaja December 1941 massacres 01.jpeg|thumb|[[Liep\u0101ja massacres]] in Latvia, December 1941]]\nHistorian Erich Haberer notes that many survived and made sense of the \"totalitarian atomization\" of society by seeking conformity with communism.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=76}} As a result, by the time of the German invasion in 1941, many had come to see conformity with a totalitarian regime as socially acceptable behaviour; thus, people simply transferred their allegiance to the German regime when it arrived.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=76}} Some who had collaborated with the Soviet regime sought to divert attention from themselves by naming Jews as collaborators and killing them.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=77}}\n\n[[File:Einsatzgruppen SD issued and used dog-tag.jpg|thumb|Dog tag issued by Einsatzgruppen SD]]\n\n=== Rumbula ===\n{{main|Rumbula massacre}}\n\nIn November 1941 Himmler was dissatisfied with the pace of the exterminations in Latvia, as he intended to move Jews from Germany into the area. He assigned SS-''Obergruppenf\u00fchrer'' Jeckeln, one of the perpetrators of the Babi Yar massacre, to liquidate the [[Riga ghetto]]. Jeckeln selected a site about {{convert|10|km}} southeast of Riga near the Rumbula railway station, and had 300 Russian prisoners of war prepare the site by digging pits in which to bury the victims. Jeckeln organised around 1,700 men, including 300 members of the ''Arajs Kommando'', 50 German SD men, and 50 Latvian guards, most of whom had already participated in mass killings of civilians. These troops were supplemented by Latvians, including members of the Riga city police, battalion police, and ghetto guards. Around 1,500 able-bodied Jews would be spared execution so their slave labour could be exploited; a thousand men were relocated to a fenced-off area within the ghetto and 500 women were temporarily housed in a prison and later moved to a separate nearby ghetto, where they were put to work mending uniforms.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=206\u2013209}}\n\nAlthough Rumbula was on the rail line, Jeckeln decided that the victims should travel on foot from Riga to the execution ground. Trucks and buses were arranged to carry children and the elderly. The victims were told that they were being relocated, and were advised to bring up to {{convert|20|kg}} of possessions. The first day of executions, 30 November 1941, began with the perpetrators rousing and assembling the victims at 4:00&nbsp;am. The victims were moved in columns of a thousand people toward the execution ground. As they walked, some SS men went up and down the line, shooting people who could not keep up the pace or who tried to run away or rest.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=208\u2013210}}\n\nWhen the columns neared the prepared execution site, the victims were driven some {{convert|270|m|yd}} from the road into the forest, where any possessions that had not yet been abandoned were seized. Here the victims were split into groups of fifty and taken deeper into the forest, near the pits, where they were ordered to strip. The victims were driven into the prepared trenches, made to lie down, and shot in the head or the back of the neck by members of Jeckeln's bodyguard. Around 13,000 Jews from Riga were killed at the pits that day, along with a thousand Jews from Berlin who had just arrived by train. On the second day of the operation, 8 December 1941, the remaining 10,000 Jews of Riga were killed in the same way. About a thousand were killed on the streets of the city or on the way to the site, bringing the total deaths for the two-day extermination to 25,000 people. For his part in organising the massacre, Jeckeln was promoted to Leader of the SS Upper Section, [[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]].{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=210\u2013214}}\n\n== Second sweep ==\n''Einsatzgruppe B, C'', and ''D'' did not immediately follow ''Einsatzgruppe'' A's example in systematically killing all Jews in their areas. The ''Einsatzgruppe'' commanders, with the exception of ''Einsatzgruppe'' A's Stahlecker, were of the opinion by the fall of 1941 that it was impossible to kill the entire Jewish population of the Soviet Union in one sweep, and thought the killings should stop.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=342}} An ''Einsatzgruppe'' report dated 17 September advised that the Germans would be better off using any skilled Jews as labourers rather than shooting them.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=342}} Also, in some areas poor weather and a lack of transportation led to a slowdown in deportations of Jews from points further west.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=549}} Thus, an interval passed between the first round of ''Einsatzgruppen'' massacres in summer and fall, and what American historian [[Raul Hilberg]] called the second sweep, which started in December 1941 and lasted into the summer of 1942.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|pp=342\u2013343}} During the interval, the surviving Jews were forced into ghettos.{{sfn|Marrus|2000|p=64}}\n\n''Einsatzgruppe'' A had already murdered almost all Jews in its area, so it shifted its operations into Belarus to assist ''Einsatzgruppe'' B. In [[Dnepropetrovsk]] in February 1942, ''Einsatzgruppe'' D reduced the city's Jewish population from 30,000 to 702 over the course of four days.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=372}} The German Order Police and local collaborators provided the extra manpower needed to perform all the shootings. Haberer wrote that, as in the Baltic states, the Germans could not have killed so many Jews so quickly without local help. He points out that the ratio of Order Police to auxiliaries was 1 to 10 in both Ukraine and Belarus. In rural areas the proportion was 1 to 20. This meant that most Ukrainian and Belarusian Jews were killed by fellow Ukrainians and Belarusians commanded by German officers rather than by Germans.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=78}}\n\nThe second wave of exterminations in the Soviet Union met with armed resistance in some areas, though the chance of success was poor. Weapons were typically primitive or home-made. Communications were impossible between ghettos in various cities, so there was no way to create a unified strategy. Few in the ghetto leadership supported resistance for fear of reprisals on the ghetto residents. Mass break-outs were sometimes attempted, though survival in the forest was nearly impossible due to the lack of food and the fact that escapees were often tracked down and killed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=353\u2013354}}\n\n== Transition to gassing ==\n{{see also|Final Solution}}\n\n[[File:Chelmno Gas Van.jpg|thumb|[[Magirus-Deutz]] van found near [[Che\u0142mno extermination camp]] is the same type as those used as [[Nazi gas van|gas van]]s. ]]\nAfter a time, Himmler found that the killing methods used by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were inefficient: they were costly, demoralising for the troops, and sometimes did not kill the victims quickly enough.{{sfn|Rees|1997|p=197}} Many of the troops found the massacres to be difficult if not impossible to perform. Some of the perpetrators suffered physical and mental health problems, and many turned to drink.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=52, 124, 168}} As much as possible, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders militarized the genocide. The historian Christian Ingrao notes an attempt was made to make the shootings a collective act without individual responsibility. Framing the shootings in this way was not psychologically sufficient for every perpetrator to feel absolved of guilt.{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|pp=199\u2014200}} Browning notes three categories of potential perpetrators: those who were eager to participate right from the start, those who participated in spite of moral qualms because they were ordered to do so, and a significant minority who refused to take part.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=163}} A few men spontaneously became excessively brutal in their killing methods and their zeal for the task. Commander of ''Einsatzgruppe'' D, SS-''Gruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Otto Ohlendorf]], particularly noted this propensity towards excess, and ordered that any man who was too eager to participate or too brutal should not perform any further executions.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=165\u2013166}}\n\nDuring a visit to [[Minsk]] in August 1941, Himmler witnessed an ''Einsatzgruppen'' mass execution first-hand and concluded that shooting Jews was too stressful for his men.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=547\u2013548}} By November he made arrangements for any SS men suffering ill health from having participated in executions to be provided with rest and mental health care.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=167}} He also decided a transition should be made to gassing the victims, especially the women and children, and ordered the recruitment of expendable native auxiliaries who could assist with the murders.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=167}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=551}} Gas vans, which had been used previously to kill mental patients, began to see service by all four main ''Einsatzgruppen'' from 1942.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=548}} However, the gas vans were not popular with the ''Einsatzkommandos'', because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them was a horrible ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=243}} Some of the early mass killings at [[extermination camp]]s used carbon monoxide fumes produced by diesel engines, similar to the method used in gas vans, but by as early as September 1941 experiments were begun at [[Auschwitz]] using [[Zyklon B]], a cyanide-based pesticide gas.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=280\u2013281}}\n\nPlans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europe\u2014eleven million people\u2014were formalised at the [[Wannsee Conference]], held on 20 January 1942. Some would be [[Extermination through labor|worked to death]], and the rest would be killed in the implementation of the [[Final Solution]] of the [[Jewish question]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Die Endl\u00f6sung der Judenfrage}}).{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=555\u2013556}} Permanent killing centres at Auschwitz, [[Belzec]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]], [[Treblinka]], and other Nazi extermination camps replaced mobile death squads as the primary method of mass killing.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=279\u2013280}} The ''Einsatzgruppen'' remained active, however, and were put to work fighting partisans, particularly in Belarus.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=248}}\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Stalingrad|fall of Stalingrad]] in February 1943, Himmler realised that Germany would likely lose the war, and ordered the formation of a special task force, [[Sonderaktion 1005|''Sonderkommando'' 1005]], under SS-''Standartenf\u00fchrer'' [[Paul Blobel]]. The unit's assignment was to visit mass graves all along the [[Eastern Front of World War II|Eastern Front]] to exhume bodies and burn them in an attempt to cover up the genocide. The task remained unfinished at the end of the war, and many mass graves remain unmarked and unexcavated.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=258\u2013260, 262}}\n\nBy 1944 the Red Army had begun to push the German forces out of Eastern Europe, and the ''Einsatzgruppen'' retreated alongside the Wehrmacht. By late 1944, most ''Einsatzgruppen'' personnel had been folded into Waffen-SS combat units or transferred to permanent death camps. Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and related agencies killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=257}} The total number of Jews murdered during the war is estimated at 5.5 to six million people.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=318}}\n\n== Plans for the Middle East and Britain ==\n[[Einsatzgruppe Egypt|''Einsatzgruppe'' Egypt]], led by [[Walter Rauff]], was raised in 1942 and standing by in [[Athens]], prepared to enter Egypt and Palestine once German forces arrived there.\n\nAccording to historians [[Klaus-Michael Mallmann]] and {{ill|Martin C\u00fcppers|de|}}, based on archival research, the units purpose was to carry out a mass killing of the [[Jew]]ish population in [[Mandatory Palestine|British mandate of Palestine]] and [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], similar to the way the [[Einsatzgruppe]]n operated in [[eastern Europe]].

He states that those German generals who claimed that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were a necessary anti-partisan response were lying, and maintained that the slaughter of about 2.2 million defenceless civilians for reasons of racist ideology cannot be justified.{{sfn|Hillgruber|1989|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\n== Einsatzgruppen Trial ==\n\nAfter the close of World War II, 24 senior leaders of the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were prosecuted in the [[Einsatzgruppen Trial]] in 1947\u201348, part of the [[Subsequent Nuremberg Trials]] held under United States military authority. The men were charged with [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], and membership in the SS (which had been declared a criminal organization). Fourteen death sentences and two life sentences were among the judgments; only four executions were carried out, on 7 June 1951; the rest were reduced to lesser sentences. Four additional ''Einsatzgruppe'' leaders were later tried and executed by other nations.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=274\u2013275}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J08517, Otto Ohlendorf.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Otto Ohlendorf]], 1943]]\n\nSeveral ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders, including Ohlendorf, claimed at the trial to have received an order before Operation Barbarossa requiring them to murder all Soviet Jews.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=187}} To date no evidence has been found that such an order was ever issued.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=187\u2013189}} German prosecutor Alfred Streim noted that if such an order had been given, post-war courts would only have been able to convict the ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders as ''accomplices'' to mass murder. However, if it could be established that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' had committed mass murder without orders, then they could have been convicted as ''perpetrators'' of mass murder, and hence could have received stiffer sentences, including capital punishment.{{sfn|Streim|1989|p=439}}\n\nStreim postulated that the existence of an early comprehensive order was a fabrication created for use in Ohlendorf's defence. This theory is now widely accepted by historians.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=188}} Longerich notes that most orders received by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders\u2014especially when they were being ordered to carry out criminal activities\u2014were vague, and couched in terminology that had a specific meaning for members of the regime. Leaders were given briefings about the need to be \"severe\" and \"firm\"; all Jews were to be viewed as potential enemies that had to be dealt with ruthlessly.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=189\u2013190}} British historian Sir [[Ian Kershaw]] argues that Hitler's apocalyptic remarks before Barbarossa about the necessity for a war without mercy to \"annihilate\" the forces of \"Judeo-Bolshevism\" were interpreted by ''Einsatzgruppen'' commanders as permission and encouragement to engage in extreme antisemitic violence, with each ''Einsatzgruppen'' commander to use his own discretion about how far he was prepared to go.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\nMost of the perpetrators of Nazi war crimes were never charged, and returned unremarked to civilian life. The West German Central Prosecution Office of Nazi War Criminals only charged about a hundred former ''Einsatzgruppe'' members with war crimes.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=275\u2013276}} And as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions; witnesses grew older and were less likely to be able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, and the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.{{sfn|Segev|2010|pp=226, 250, 376}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Functionalism versus intentionalism]]\n* [[Glossary of Nazi Germany]]\n* [[List of Nazi Party leaders and officials]]\n* [[Myth of the clean Wehrmacht]]\n* [[Porajmos]]\n* [[Special Organization (Ottoman Empire)]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Explanatory notes ===\n{{notelist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book | last = Browning | first = Christopher R. | title = Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland | publisher = Penguin | location = London; New York | orig-year = 1992 | year = 1998 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Browning | first1 = Christopher | author-link = Christopher Browning | last2 = Matth\u00e4us | first2 = J\u00fcrgen | authorlink2 = J\u00fcrgen Matth\u00e4us | title = The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939 \u2013 March 1942 | series = Comprehensive History of the Holocaust | publisher = University of Nebraska Press | location = Lincoln | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-8032-1327-2 | ref = harv | url = https://archive.org/details/originsoffinalso00brow }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Caron | first1 = Jean-Christophe | title = Erwin Rommel: Auf der Jagd nach dem Schatz des \"W\u00fcstenfuchses\" | page = 2 | journal = Spiegel Online | date = 22 December 2007 | language = German | url = http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/erwin-rommel-auf-der-jagd-nach-dem-schatz-des-wuestenfuchses-a-522484-2.html | accessdate = 9 September 2016 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Conze | first1 = Eckart | last2 = Frei | first2 = Norbert | last3 = Hayes | first3 = Peter | last4 = Zimmermann | first4 = Moshe | title = Das Amt und die Vergangenheit : deutsche Diplomaten im Dritten Reich und in der Bundesrepublik | year = 2010 | publisher = Karl Blessing | location = Munich | language = German | isbn = 978-3-89667-430-2 | ref = {{sfnRef|Conze, Frei et al.|2010}} }}\n* {{cite book | last = Craig | first = William | authorlink = William Craig (author) | title = Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad | year = 1973 | publisher = Konecky & Konecky | location = Old Saybrook, CT | isbn = 978-1-56852-368-2 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Crowe | first = David | title = Oskar Schindler: The Untold Account of his Life, Wartime Activities and the True Story Behind the List | year = 2007 | origyear = 2004 | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-465-00253-5 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Dams | first1 = Carsten | last2 = Stolle | first2 = Michael | title = Die Gestapo: Herrschaft und Terror im Dritten Reich | series = Becksche Reihe | year = 2012 | origyear = 2008 | language = German | publisher = Beck | location = Munich | isbn = 978-3-406-62898-6 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite web | last = Edeiken | first = Yale F. | publisher = Holocaust History Project | title = Introduction to the Einsatzgruppen | date = 22 August 2000 | url = http://www.holocaust-history.org/intro-einsatz/ | accessdate= 10 June 2018 | ref = harv | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151007085553/http://www.holocaust-history.org/intro-einsatz/ | archive-date = 7 October 2015}}\n* {{cite book | title = Trials of War Criminals before the Nuernberg Military Tribunals under Control Council Law No. 10 | location = N\u00fcrnberg | date = October 1946 \u2013 April 1949 | volume =Volume 4 | series = Green Series | chapter = Einsatzgruppen case | chapter-url = https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/NT_war-criminals_Vol-IV.pdf | url = https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/NTs_war-criminals.html | format = PDF | accessdate = 10 June 2018 | ref = {{sfnRef|Einsatzgruppen judgment}} }}\n* {{cite book | last = Evans | first = Richard J. | authorlink = Richard J.
