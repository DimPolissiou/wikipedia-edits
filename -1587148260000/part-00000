The voltage of the [[gate oxide|covered gate]] determines the [[electrical conductivity]] of the device; this ability to change conductivity with the amount of applied voltage can be used for [[amplifier|amplifying]] or [[electronic switch|switching]] electronic [[signal (electrical engineering)|signals]]. The MOSFET was invented by Egyptian engineer [[Mohamed M. Atalla]] and Korean engineer [[Dawon Kahng]] at [[Bell Labs]] in 1959. It is the basic building block of modern [[electronics]], and the [[List of best-selling electronic devices|most frequently manufactured device]] in history, with an estimated total of 13{{nbsp}}[[sextillion]] (1.3 \u00d7 10<sup>22</sup>) MOSFETs manufactured between 1960 and 2018.\n\nThe MOSFET is the most common [[semiconductor device]] in [[digital electronics|digital]] and [[analog circuits]], and the most common [[power device]]. It was the first truly compact [[transistor]] that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a [[#Common applications|wide range of uses]], revolutionizing the [[electronics industry]] and the [[world economy]], having been central to the [[microcomputer revolution|computer revolution]], [[digital revolution]], [[information revolution]], [[silicon age]] and [[information age]]. [[#Scaling|MOSFET scaling]] and miniaturization has been driving the rapid exponential growth of electronic semiconductor technology since the 1960s, and enable [[Very Large Scale Integration|high-density]] [[integrated circuits]] (ICs) such as [[memory chip]]s and [[microprocessors]]. The MOSFET is considered to be possibly the most important invention in electronics, as the \"workhorse\" of the electronics industry and the \"base technology\" of the late 20th to early 21st centuries, having revolutionized modern culture, economy, society and daily life.\n\nThe MOSFET is by far the most widely used transistor in both [[digital circuit]]s and [[analog circuit]]s, and it is the backbone of modern [[electronics]].<ref name=\"Boston\">{{cite web |title=MOSFET DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER |url=http://sites.bu.edu/engcourses/files/2016/08/mosfet-differential-amplifier.pdf |publisher=[[Boston University]] |accessdate=10 August 2019}}</ref> It is the basis for numerous modern technologies,<ref name=\"Colinge2005\"/> and is commonly used for a wide range of applications.<ref name=\"Sridharan\"/> According to Jean-Pierre Colinge, numerous modern technologies would not exist without the MOSFET, such as the modern [[computer industry]], [[digital telecommunication]] systems, [[video games]], [[pocket calculators]], and [[digital wristwatch]]es, for example.<ref name=\"Colinge2005\">{{cite book |last1=Colinge |first1=Jean-Pierre |last2=Colinge |first2=C.

Discrete MOSFET devices are widely used in applications such as [[switch mode power supply|switch mode power supplies]], [[variable-frequency drive]]s and other [[power electronics]] applications where each device may be switching thousands of watts. Radio-frequency amplifiers up to the [[UHF]] spectrum use MOSFET transistors as [[analog signal]] and [[power amplifiers]]. Radio systems also use MOSFETs as oscillators, or [[frequency mixer|mixer]]s to convert frequencies. MOSFET devices are also applied in audio-frequency power amplifiers for [[public address systems]], [[sound reinforcement]], and home and [[automobile]] sound systems.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|MOSFET}}\n{{multiple image\n | align  = right\n | image1 = Atalla1963.png\n | width1 = 139\n | image2 = Dawon Kahng.jpg\n | width2 = 144\n | footer = [[Mohamed M.

The insulating oxide between the gate and channel effectively isolates a MOSFET in one logic stage from earlier and later stages, which allows a single MOSFET output to drive a considerable number of MOSFET inputs. Bipolar transistor-based logic (such as [[transistor-transistor logic|TTL]]) does not have such a high fanout capacity. This isolation also makes it easier for the designers to ignore to some extent loading effects between logic stages independently. That extent is defined by the operating frequency: as frequencies increase, the input impedance of the MOSFETs decreases.\n\n=== Analog ===\n{{See|CMOS amplifier|Mixed-signal integrated circuit}}\n\nThe MOSFET's advantages in digital circuits do not translate into supremacy in all [[analog circuit]]s. The two types of circuit draw upon different features of transistor behavior. Digital circuits switch, spending most of their time either fully on or fully off. The transition from one to the other is only of concern with regards to speed and charge required. Analog circuits depend on operation in the transition region where small changes to ''V''{{sub|gs}} can modulate the output (drain) current. The JFET and [[bipolar junction transistor]] (BJT) are preferred for accurate matching (of adjacent devices in integrated circuits), higher [[transconductance]] and certain temperature characteristics which simplify keeping performance predictable as circuit temperature varies.\n\nNevertheless, MOSFETs are widely used in many types of analog circuits because of their own advantages (zero gate current, high and adjustable output impedance and improved robustness vs. BJTs which can be permanently degraded by even lightly breaking down the emitter-base).{{Vague|date=January 2016}} The characteristics and performance of many analog circuits can be scaled up or down by changing the sizes (length and width) of the MOSFETs used. By comparison, in bipolar transistors the size of the device does not significantly affect its performance.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} MOSFETs' ideal characteristics regarding gate current (zero) and drain-source offset voltage (zero) also make them nearly ideal switch elements, and also make [[switched capacitor]] analog circuits practical. In their linear region, MOSFETs can be used as precision resistors, which can have a much higher controlled resistance than BJTs. In high power circuits, MOSFETs sometimes have the advantage of not suffering from [[thermal runaway]] as BJTs do.{{Dubious|reason=Depends on circuit topology?|date=January 2016}} Also, MOSFETs can be configured to perform as capacitors and [[gyrator]] circuits which allow op-amps made from them to appear as inductors, thereby allowing all of the normal analog devices on a chip (except for diodes, which can be made smaller than a MOSFET anyway) to be built entirely out of MOSFETs. This means that complete analog circuits can be made on a silicon chip in a much smaller space and with simpler fabrication techniques. MOSFETS are ideally suited to switch inductive loads because of tolerance to inductive kickback.\n\nSome ICs combine analog and digital MOSFET circuitry on a single [[mixed-signal integrated circuit]], making the needed board space even smaller. This creates a need to isolate the analog circuits from the digital circuits on a chip level, leading to the use of isolation rings and [[silicon on insulator]] (SOI). Since MOSFETs require more space to handle a given amount of power than a BJT, fabrication processes can incorporate BJTs and MOSFETs into a single device. Mixed-transistor devices are called bi-FETs (bipolar FETs) if they contain just one BJT-FET and [[BiCMOS]] (bipolar-CMOS) if they contain complementary BJT-FETs. Such devices have the advantages of both insulated gates and higher current density.\n\n=== RF CMOS ===\n{{Main|RF CMOS}}\n[[File:AVM BlueFRITZ! USB v1.0.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bluetooth]] [[dongle]].

This changed the way in which [[RF circuit]]s were designed, away from discrete bipolar transistors and towards CMOS integrated circuits. As of 2008, the [[radio transceiver]]s in all [[wireless networking]] devices and modern [[mobile phones]] are mass-produced as RF CMOS devices.

Signals flow in both directions across a MOSFET switch. In this application, the drain and source of a MOSFET exchange places depending on the relative voltages of the source/drain electrodes. The source is the more negative side for an N-MOS or the more positive side for a P-MOS. All of these switches are limited on what signals they can pass or stop by their gate\u2013source, gate\u2013drain, and source\u2013drain voltages; exceeding the voltage, current, or power limits will potentially damage the switch.\n\n=== Single-type ===\nThis analog switch uses a four-terminal simple MOSFET of either P or N type.\n\nIn the case of an n-type switch, the body is connected to the most negative supply (usually GND) and the gate is used as the switch control. Whenever the gate voltage exceeds the source voltage by at least a threshold voltage, the MOSFET conducts. The higher the voltage, the more the MOSFET can conduct. An N-MOS switch passes all voltages less than ''V''{{sub|gate}} \u2212 ''V''{{sub|tn}}. When the switch is conducting, it typically operates in the linear (or ohmic) mode of operation, since the source and drain voltages will typically be nearly equal.\n\nIn the case of a P-MOS, the body is connected to the most positive voltage, and the gate is brought to a lower potential to turn the switch on. The P-MOS switch passes all voltages higher than ''V''{{sub|gate}} \u2212 ''V''{{sub|tp}} (threshold voltage ''V''{{sub|tp}} is negative in the case of enhancement-mode P-MOS).\n\n=== Dual-type (CMOS) ===\nThis \"complementary\" or CMOS type of switch uses one P-MOS and one N-MOS FET to counteract the limitations of the single-type switch. The FETs have their drains and sources connected in parallel, the body of the P-MOS is connected to the high potential (''V''<sub>DD</sub>) and the body of the N-MOS is connected to the low potential (''gnd''). To turn the switch on, the gate of the P-MOS is driven to the low potential and the gate of the N-MOS is driven to the high potential. For voltages between ''V''<sub>DD</sub> \u2212 ''V''<sub>tn</sub> and ''gnd'' \u2212 ''V''<sub>tp</sub>, both FETs conduct the signal; for voltages less than ''gnd'' \u2212 ''V''<sub>tp</sub>, the N-MOS conducts alone; and for voltages greater than ''V''<sub>DD</sub> \u2212 ''V''<sub>tn</sub>, the P-MOS conducts alone.\n\nThe voltage limits for this switch are the gate\u2013source, gate\u2013drain and source\u2013drain voltage limits for both FETs. Also, the P-MOS is typically two to three times wider than the N-MOS, so the switch will be balanced for speed in the two directions.\n\n[[Three-state logic|Tri-state circuitry]] sometimes incorporates a CMOS MOSFET switch on its output to provide for a low-ohmic, full-range output when on, and a high-ohmic, mid-level signal when off.\n\n== MOS memory ==\n{{Main|MOS memory}}\n{{See|Computer memory|Memory cell (computing)}}\n[[File:Two 8 GB DDR4-2133 ECC 1.2 V RDIMMs (straightened).jpg|thumb|[[DDR4]] [[SDRAM]] [[dual in-line memory module]] (DIMM).

The insulating oxide between the gate and channel effectively isolates a MOSFET in one logic stage from earlier and later stages, which allows a single MOSFET output to drive a considerable number of MOSFET inputs. Bipolar transistor-based logic (such as [[transistor-transistor logic|TTL]]) does not have such a high fanout capacity. This isolation also makes it easier for the designers to ignore to some extent loading effects between logic stages independently. That extent is defined by the operating frequency: as frequencies increase, the input impedance of the MOSFETs decreases.\n\n=== Analog ===\n{{See|CMOS amplifier|Mixed-signal integrated circuit}}\n\nThe MOSFET's advantages in digital circuits do not translate into supremacy in all [[analog circuit]]s. The two types of circuit draw upon different features of transistor behavior. Digital circuits switch, spending most of their time either fully on or fully off. The transition from one to the other is only of concern with regards to speed and charge required. Analog circuits depend on operation in the transition region where small changes to ''V''{{sub|gs}} can modulate the output (drain) current. The JFET and [[bipolar junction transistor]] (BJT) are preferred for accurate matching (of adjacent devices in integrated circuits), higher [[transconductance]] and certain temperature characteristics which simplify keeping performance predictable as circuit temperature varies.\n\nNevertheless, MOSFETs are widely used in many types of analog circuits because of their own advantages (zero gate current, high and adjustable output impedance and improved robustness vs. BJTs which can be permanently degraded by even lightly breaking down the emitter-base).{{Vague|date=January 2016}} The characteristics and performance of many analog circuits can be scaled up or down by changing the sizes (length and width) of the MOSFETs used. By comparison, in bipolar transistors the size of the device does not significantly affect its performance.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} MOSFETs' ideal characteristics regarding gate current (zero) and drain-source offset voltage (zero) also make them nearly ideal switch elements, and also make [[switched capacitor]] analog circuits practical. In their linear region, MOSFETs can be used as precision resistors, which can have a much higher controlled resistance than BJTs. In high power circuits, MOSFETs sometimes have the advantage of not suffering from [[thermal runaway]] as BJTs do.{{Dubious|reason=Depends on circuit topology?|date=January 2016}} Also, MOSFETs can be configured to perform as capacitors and [[gyrator]] circuits which allow op-amps made from them to appear as inductors, thereby allowing all of the normal analog devices on a chip (except for diodes, which can be made smaller than a MOSFET anyway) to be built entirely out of MOSFETs. This means that complete analog circuits can be made on a silicon chip in a much smaller space and with simpler fabrication techniques. MOSFETS are ideally suited to switch inductive loads because of tolerance to inductive kickback.\n\nSome ICs combine analog and digital MOSFET circuitry on a single [[mixed-signal integrated circuit]], making the needed board space even smaller. This creates a need to isolate the analog circuits from the digital circuits on a chip level, leading to the use of isolation rings and [[silicon on insulator]] (SOI). Since MOSFETs require more space to handle a given amount of power than a BJT, fabrication processes can incorporate BJTs and MOSFETs into a single device. Mixed-transistor devices are called bi-FETs (bipolar FETs) if they contain just one BJT-FET and [[BiCMOS]] (bipolar-CMOS) if they contain complementary BJT-FETs. Such devices have the advantages of both insulated gates and higher current density.\n\n=== RF CMOS ===\n{{Main|RF CMOS}}\n[[File:AVM BlueFRITZ! USB v1.0.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bluetooth]] [[dongle]]. [[RF CMOS]] [[mixed-signal integrated circuit]]s are widely used in nearly all modern Bluetooth devices.<ref name=\"O'Neill\"/>]]\n\nIn the late 1980s, [[Asad Abidi]] pioneered [[RF CMOS]] technology, which uses MOS [[VLSI]] circuits, while working at [[UCLA]]. This changed the way in which [[RF circuit]]s were designed, away from discrete bipolar transistors and towards CMOS integrated circuits. As of 2008, the [[radio transceiver]]s in all [[wireless networking]] devices and modern [[mobile phones]] are mass-produced as RF CMOS devices. RF CMOS is also used in nearly all modern [[Bluetooth]] and [[wireless LAN]] (WLAN) devices.<ref name=\"O'Neill\">{{cite journal |last1=O'Neill |first1=A. |title=Asad Abidi Recognized for Work in RF-CMOS |journal=IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society Newsletter |year=2008 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=57\u201358 |doi=10.1109/N-SSC.2008.4785694 |issn=1098-4232}}</ref>\n\n== Analog switches ==\nMOSFET analog switches use the MOSFET to pass analog signals when on, and as a high impedance when off. Signals flow in both directions across a MOSFET switch. In this application, the drain and source of a MOSFET exchange places depending on the relative voltages of the source/drain electrodes. The source is the more negative side for an N-MOS or the more positive side for a P-MOS. All of these switches are limited on what signals they can pass or stop by their gate\u2013source, gate\u2013drain, and source\u2013drain voltages; exceeding the voltage, current, or power limits will potentially damage the switch.\n\n=== Single-type ===\nThis analog switch uses a four-terminal simple MOSFET of either P or N type.\n\nIn the case of an n-type switch, the body is connected to the most negative supply (usually GND) and the gate is used as the switch control. Whenever the gate voltage exceeds the source voltage by at least a threshold voltage, the MOSFET conducts. The higher the voltage, the more the MOSFET can conduct. An N-MOS switch passes all voltages less than ''V''{{sub|gate}} \u2212 ''V''{{sub|tn}}. When the switch is conducting, it typically operates in the linear (or ohmic) mode of operation, since the source and drain voltages will typically be nearly equal.\n\nIn the case of a P-MOS, the body is connected to the most positive voltage, and the gate is brought to a lower potential to turn the switch on. The P-MOS switch passes all voltages higher than ''V''{{sub|gate}} \u2212 ''V''{{sub|tp}} (threshold voltage ''V''{{sub|tp}} is negative in the case of enhancement-mode P-MOS).\n\n=== Dual-type (CMOS) ===\nThis \"complementary\" or CMOS type of switch uses one P-MOS and one N-MOS FET to counteract the limitations of the single-type switch. The FETs have their drains and sources connected in parallel, the body of the P-MOS is connected to the high potential (''V''<sub>DD</sub>) and the body of the N-MOS is connected to the low potential (''gnd''). To turn the switch on, the gate of the P-MOS is driven to the low potential and the gate of the N-MOS is driven to the high potential. For voltages between ''V''<sub>DD</sub> \u2212 ''V''<sub>tn</sub> and ''gnd'' \u2212 ''V''<sub>tp</sub>, both FETs conduct the signal; for voltages less than ''gnd'' \u2212 ''V''<sub>tp</sub>, the N-MOS conducts alone; and for voltages greater than ''V''<sub>DD</sub> \u2212 ''V''<sub>tn</sub>, the P-MOS conducts alone.\n\nThe voltage limits for this switch are the gate\u2013source, gate\u2013drain and source\u2013drain voltage limits for both FETs. Also, the P-MOS is typically two to three times wider than the N-MOS, so the switch will be balanced for speed in the two directions.\n\n[[Three-state logic|Tri-state circuitry]] sometimes incorporates a CMOS MOSFET switch on its output to provide for a low-ohmic, full-range output when on, and a high-ohmic, mid-level signal when off.\n\n== MOS memory ==\n{{Main|MOS memory}}\n{{See|Computer memory|Memory cell (computing)}}\n[[File:Two 8 GB DDR4-2133 ECC 1.2 V RDIMMs (straightened).jpg|thumb|[[DDR4]] [[SDRAM]] [[dual in-line memory module]] (DIMM).

She was named to memorialize the U.S. casualties of the [[Battle of Savo Island]], which was fought in support of the [[Guadalcanal campaign]]. The ship was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]]in December 1943, [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] in February 1944, and served as a frontline carrier throughout the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]] and the [[Philippines campaign (1944\u20131945)|Philippines campaign]]. During the [[Battle of Okinawa]], she provided air cover for the replenishment carrier fleet. Postwar, she participated in [[Operation Magic Carpet]]. She was decommissioned in December 1946, when she was [[Reserve fleet|mothballed]] in the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]]. Ultimately, she was sold for [[Ship breaking|scrapping]] in February 1960.\n\n==Design and description==\n[[File:Inboard and outboard profiles of a Casablanca-class escort carrier, 1946.png|thumb|left|A profile of the design of {{USS|Takanis Bay|CVE-89|2}}, which was shared with all ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers.]]\n{{main|Casablanca-class escort carrier}}\n''Savo Island'' was a ''Casablanca''-class [[escort carrier]], the most numerous type of [[aircraft carrier]]s ever built,{{sfn|Chesneau|Gardiner|1980|p=109}} and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her [[sister ship]]s, she was {{convert|512|ft|3|in|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]], she had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{cvt|65|ft|2|in|abbr=on}}, at her widest point, this was {{cvt|108|ft|abbr=on}}, and a [[draft (nautical)|draft]] of {{convert|20|ft|9|in|abbr=on}}. She [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|8188|LT|lk=on}} [[Standard displacement|standard]], {{cvt|10902|LT}} with a [[Full-load displacement|full load]]. She had a {{convert|257|ft|abbr=on}} long [[Hangar#Hangars aboard ships|hangar deck]] and a {{convert|477|ft|abbr=on}} long [[flight deck]]. She was powered with two [[Skinner Unaflow]] reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing {{convert|9000|shp|lk=in}}, thus enabling her to make {{Casablanca class speed}}. The ship had a cruising range of {{convert|10240|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|15|kn}}. Her compact size necessitated the installment of an [[aircraft catapult]] at her bow, and there were two [[Elevator#Elevators for aircraft|aircraft elevators]] to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|pp=34\u201335}}{{sfn|Chesneau|Gardiner|1980|p=109}}{{sfn|Hazegray|1998}}\n\nOne [[5\"/38 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|0|adj=on}}/38]] [[Caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[dual-purpose gun]] was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors {{convert|40|mm|in|sp=us}} anti-aircraft guns]] in single mounts, as well as 12 [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon {{convert|20|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} cannon]]s, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck.{{sfn|Hazegray|1998}} By the end of the war, ''Casablanca''-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20-mm cannons, and the amount of 40-mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to [[kamikaze]] attacks. Although ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers were designed to function with a crew of 860 and an embarked squadron of 50 to 56, the exigencies of wartime often necessitated the inflation of the crew count. ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. During the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]], she carried 16 [[Grumman F4F Wildcat#FM-1/-2 Wildcat|FM-2]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], and 12 [[Grumman TBF Avenger#TBM|TBM-1C]] [[torpedo bomber]]s, for a total of 28 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=109}} During the [[Battle off Samar]], she carried 17 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 29 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=121}} During the [[Battle of Mindoro]], she carried 24 FM-2 fighters and 9 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 33 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=251}} During the [[Battle of Lingayen Gulf]], she carried 19 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 31 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=277}} During the [[Battle of Okinawa]], she carried 20 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 32 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=349}}\n\n==Construction==\nHer construction was awarded to [[Kaiser Shipyards|Kaiser Shipbuilding Company]], [[Vancouver, Washington]] under a [[Maritime Commission]] contract, on 18 June 1942. The escort carrier was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 27 September 1943 under the name ''Kaita Bay'', as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska.{{sfn|Maksel|2012}} She was laid down as MC hull 1115, the twenty-third of a series of fifty ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers. She was renamed ''Savo Island'' on 6 November 1943, as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent ''Casablanca''-class carriers after naval or land engagements.{{sfn|Stubblebine|2011}} She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 22 December 1943; [[Ship sponsor|sponsored]] by Miss Margaret Taffinder; transferred to the [[United States Navy]] and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 3 February 1944, with [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] Clarence Eugene Ekstrom in command.{{sfn|Kaiser Vancouver|2010}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\n==Service history==\nUpon being commissioned, ''Savo Island'' underwent a [[shakedown cruise]] down the West Coast to [[San Diego]], where she took on a load of replacement aircraft. Between 15 March 1944 and 2 July, she underwent two transport missions, ferrying aircraft to bases in the Southwest Pacific. On 6 July, she embarked Composite Squadron (VC) 27, which would be her aircraft contingent throughout the Marianas and Palau Islands campaign and the [[Philippines campaign (1944\u20131945)|Philippines campaign of 1944\u201345]]. After a brief period of training off the waters of San Diego, she sailed west to [[Pearl Harbor]], where similar exercises were conducted. There, on 4 August, she was assigned to Task Group 32.7, the Western Escort Carrier Group, commanded by [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[William Sample]], of the [[United States Third Fleet|3rd Fleet]], assigned to support the planned [[Battle of Peleliu|landings]] on the island of [[Peleliu]], of the [[Palau|Palau Islands]]. Her aircraft contingent began combat operations on 11 September, strafing and bombarding the island to soften up the defenses for the landings. Following the landing of [[United States Marine Corps|marines]], her aircraft transitioned into providing [[close air support]] and patrol missions, up until 30 September.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=109}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\nOn 3 October, she was assigned to and joined Task Group 77.4, which was gathering at [[Manus Island]], part of the [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]].  She, accompanied with eighteen other escort carriers and their screens of [[battleships]], [[cruisers]], and [[destroyers]], steamed on 12 October for [[Leyte Gulf]], where they were expected to support the [[Battle of Leyte|landings]] on [[Leyte]], which marked the beginning of the Philippines campaign. As a part of Task Unit 77.4.2, otherwise known as \"Taffy 2\", commanded by Rear Admiral [[Felix Stump]], she was positioned to the direct south of \"Taffy 3\", which was located to the direct east of the [[San Bernadino Strait]]. Arriving off the island on 18 October, her aircraft began carrying out naval patrols and strikes against predesignated targets. Once the [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth Army]] had landed on 20 October, her aircraft transitioned towards a focus on close air support, supporting the initial advances for the next few days.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=121}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\nOn 23 October, the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] began. Almost the entirety of Japan's remaining surface fleet had been concentrated into a counterattack against the U.S. forces in the vicinity of the Philippines, which had threatened to cut off Japan's vital oil supply from Southeast Asia. Split into three groups, the Southern Force was defeated in the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]], whilst [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[William Halsey Jr.]] sent the Third Fleet in an attack against the diversionary Northern Force. Therefore, the escort carriers which continued providing ground support had no capital ship screening, even as Vice Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]]'s Center Force drove through the San Bernadino Strait during the night.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=148}} On the early morning of 25 October, the Center Force emerged into the waters of the Leyte Gulf, catching Taffy 3, some {{cvt|20|mi}} north of ''Savo Island'', by surprise.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=153}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\nAs the American command came to an understanding of the severity of the situation, with the Center Force consisting of four battleships, six cruisers, and a large destroyer screen, the entirety of Taffy 2's aircraft were recalled to join the defense. ''Savo Island''{{'}}s fighters and torpedo bombers were not equipped to attack surface ships, with most of her bombers being loaded with [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]] and missiles for ground attacks.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=196}} Nonetheless, aircraft from ''Savo Island''{{'}}s VC-27 were amongst Taffy 2's first wave of strikes, launched at 7:37 in the morning. Some of the destroyers within Taffy 2's screen wandered north, before being confronted with some Japanese naval gunfire and being ordered to withdraw towards the escort carriers. Overall, ''Savo Island'' launched six strikes against the Japanese forces, with her aircraft notably landing a torpedo hit on a Japanese battleship and shooting down an [[Aichi E13A]] [[reconnaissance]] [[seaplane]] caught in the middle of the action.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=221}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\nDiscouraged by the stiff resistance his Center Force had faced, including the loss of three cruisers, Admiral Kurita issued orders to withdraw in the late morning, sparing Taffy 3 from further destruction. As the Japanese forces withdrew, fighters from ''Savo Island'' took the opportunity to down four more Japanese planes.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=225}} Nonetheless, the escort carriers underwent concentrated Japanese attack again in the afternoon, this time from the air, including some of the first usage of [[kamikaze]] suicide attacks. The carrier continued supporting ground operations until 30 October, when Taffy 2 was reorganized into Task Unit 77.4.4, and ordered to withdraw back to Manus Island to rearm and replenish.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=241}} She sortied from Manus on 19 November, providing cover for convoys proceeding to Leyte Gulf from 22 November to 27 November, accompanied by two other escort carriers. Upon completing this task, she replenished at [[Kossol Roads]], before she left on 10 December, this time in support of the [[Battle of Mindoro|landings]] on the island of [[Mindoro]]. Her aircraft provided air cover as the landing crafts unloaded their troops, and provided close air support as they advanced. They also targeted air fields, from which kamikaze aircraft were beginning to make regular forays. The escort carriers were relieved by Army aircraft on 15 December, but she stayed offshore until 17 December because of indications of a Japanese surface raid, which never materialized. On 17 December, she steamed back to Manus Island.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=264}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\n[[File:SavoIslandSuluSea.jpg|thumb|left|''Savo Island'' underway in the Sulu Sea, photographed from the battleship {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|2}}.]]\nAt Manus Island, ''Savo Island'' was assigned to Task Unit 77.4.2., the San Fabian Carrier Group.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=277}} On 27 December, the carriers, escorted by a large surface fleet, left Manus bound for [[Lingayen Gulf]], to the west of [[Luzon]]. There, the carriers would support the [[Sixth United States Army|6th Army]] [[Invasion of Lingayen Gulf|landings]] on Luzon. As a part of Task Unit 77.4.2., ''Savo Island'' would provide air support and cover for the [[I Corps (United States)|I Army Corps]], which would land around the [[San Fabian, Pangasinan|San Fabian]] area. Pausing at [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]], the carriers entered the [[Sulu Sea]] on 3 January 1945, where they began being harried by aircraft, circling around on radar. Japanese planes continued appearing around the periphery of the American forces throughout 4 January, but it was not until 17:00 in the evening that the Japanese forces coalesced into a [[kamikaze]] strike, attacking at 17:12, achieving complete surprise, and sinking {{USS|Ommaney Bay|CVE-79|2}}.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=281}} \n\nThe following day, on 5 January, the kamikazes returned. At 17:43 in the evening, the [[battleship]] {{USS|New Mexico|BB-40|2}} reported planes approaching from her starboard bow, and shortly afterwards, {{USS|Manila Bay|CVE-61|2}} had been hit by two kamikazes, heavily damaging the ship. A few minutes after the attack on ''Manila Bay'', a [[Nakajima Ki-43]] kamikaze dove towards ''Savo Island''. Engaged by several anti-aircraft batteries, the plane being trailing smoke some {{cvt|800|yds}} away from the carrier. As a reaction, ''Savo Island'' turned hard to starboard, whilst its {{cvt|24|in}} searchlight was pointed at the aircraft to try to blind the pilot. The plane, moving erratically, passed between the carrier's mast and the whip antenna, shearing off the carrier's radar antenna, before diving into the sea.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=295}}\n\nOn 6 January, the carriers proceeded into Lingayen Gulf, and started a heavy bombardment of Japanese defenses, flying 5,971 sorties in eleven days. On 9 January, the 6th Army moved onshore, encountering little resistance. ''Savo Island'' remained on station until 17 January, when the [[United States Air Force]] took over air operations on Luzon.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=316}}  She then proceeded south to operate to the northwest of Mindoro, to guard against any counterattacks on the American garrisons situated throughout the Northern Philippines, staying on station from 17 January until 29 January. During this period, on 19 January, Captain William Donald Anderson took command of the ship. Upon completing her patrols, she then provided cover for landings near [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]] on 29 and 30 January, before retiring to [[Ulithi]] for repairs and replenishment. There, her aircraft contingent, Composite Squadron 27, was replaced with Composite Squadron 91, which had previously served upon {{USS|Kitkun Bay|CVE-71|2}}. Upon receiving replacement pilots, she began a brief period of training exercises, before being assigned to Task Unit 52.1.1, in preparation for the [[Battle of Okinawa]].{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=349}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}} \n\nTransiting via Leyte, her aircraft provided air cover and patrols en route. On 26 March, along with two other escort carriers, she supported the [[77th Sustainment Brigade|77th Infantry Division]] as it occupied the [[Kerama Islands]]. On 27 March, she began bombing the main island of [[Okinawa]], with her fighters flying antiaircraft and antisubmarine patrols. On 7 April, the carrier left Task Unit 52.1.1., trading places with {{USS|Shamrock Bay|CVE-84|2}}, part of Task Group 50.8, the Logistics Support Group.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=363}} Therefore, from 7 to 16 April, she screened a replenishment convoy proceeding to the east of Okinawa. Upon the completion of that task, she continued providing close air support for American forces advancing down Okinawa. On 27 April, her aircraft bombed [[Sakishima Gunto]], an island situated halfway between Okinawa and [[Taiwan|Formosa]]. On 29 April, ''Savo Island'', along with {{USS|Marcus Island|CVE-77|2}} and {{USS|Saginaw Bay|CVE-82|2}}, were discharged from their task group, all sailing for overhaul in San Diego.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=380}} ''Savo Island''{{'}}s aircraft contingent, Composite Squadron 91, was traded for {{USS|Makin Island|CVE-93|2}}'s Composite Squadron (VC) 84.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=381}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\n[[Image:CVE-78 Savo Island.jpg|thumb|300px|USS ''Savo Island'' (CVE-78) photographed from the waterline, her flight deck full of aircraft, date and location unknown.]]\n\nAfter finishing overhaul, ''Savo Island'' began a transport mission from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, before transiting back to [[Alameda, California]], on the West Coast. On 6 August, she departed for the [[Aleutian Islands]], arriving on 15 August, right as the [[Surrender of Japan]] was announced. On 31 August, she headed, along with six other escort carriers, to support the [[Occupation of Japan]] in northern [[Honsh\u016b]] and [[Hokkaid\u014d]]. After finishing her duties, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 September, where she was assigned to the \"Magic Carpet\" fleet, which repatriated servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She first loaded occupation troops bound for Japan at [[San Francisco]], before heading west. ''Savo Island'' made a total of three \"Magic Carpet\" voyages, repatriating troops from [[Guam]], Pearl Harbor, and Okinawa, respectively. Upon arriving at [[Seattle]] on 14 January 1946, and finishing her final voyage, she transited to the Eastern seaboard, entering [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] harbor on 16 March for inactivation.{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\n''Savo Island'' was decommissioned on 12 December, and [[Reserve fleet|mothballed]] in the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]], as port of its Boston group.

She was then further reclassified as an aviation transport ('''AKV-28''') on 7 May 1959. She was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy list]] on 1 September 1959, and she was sold on 29 February 1960 to Comarket Inc., which [[Ship breaking|broke]] her up in [[Hong Kong]] throughout June 1960.{{sfn|Hazegray|1998}}\n''Savo Island'' received 4 [[battle star]]s for her World War II service.

She was named to memorialize the U.S. casualties of the [[Battle of Savo Island]], which was fought in support of the [[Guadalcanal campaign]]. The ship was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]]in December 1943, [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] in February 1944, and served as a frontline carrier throughout the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]] and the [[Philippines campaign (1944\u20131945)|Philippines campaign]]. During the [[Battle of Okinawa]], she provided air cover for the replenishment carrier fleet. Postwar, she participated in [[Operation Magic Carpet]]. She was decommissioned in December 1946, when she was [[Reserve fleet|mothballed]] in the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]]. Ultimately, she was sold for [[Ship breaking|scrapping]] in February 1960.\n\n==Design and description==\n[[File:Inboard and outboard profiles of a Casablanca-class escort carrier, 1946.png|thumb|left|A profile of the design of {{USS|Takanis Bay|CVE-89|2}}, which was shared with all ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers.]]\n{{main|Casablanca-class escort carrier}}\n''Savo Island'' was a ''Casablanca''-class [[escort carrier]], the most numerous type of [[aircraft carrier]]s ever built,{{sfn|Chesneau|Gardiner|1980|p=109}} and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her [[sister ship]]s, she was {{convert|512|ft|3|in|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]], she had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{cvt|65|ft|2|in|abbr=on}}, at her widest point, this was {{cvt|108|ft|abbr=on}}, and a [[draft (nautical)|draft]] of {{convert|20|ft|9|in|abbr=on}}. She [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|8188|LT|lk=on}} [[Standard displacement|standard]], {{cvt|10902|LT}} with a [[Full-load displacement|full load]]. She had a {{convert|257|ft|abbr=on}} long [[Hangar#Hangars aboard ships|hangar deck]] and a {{convert|477|ft|abbr=on}} long [[flight deck]]. She was powered with two [[Skinner Unaflow]] reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing {{convert|9000|shp|lk=in}}, thus enabling her to make {{Casablanca class speed}}. The ship had a cruising range of {{convert|10240|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|15|kn}}. Her compact size necessitated the installment of an [[aircraft catapult]] at her bow, and there were two [[Elevator#Elevators for aircraft|aircraft elevators]] to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|pp=34\u201335}}{{sfn|Chesneau|Gardiner|1980|p=109}}{{sfn|Hazegray|1998}}\n\nOne [[5\"/38 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|0|adj=on}}/38]] [[Caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[dual-purpose gun]] was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors {{convert|40|mm|in|sp=us}} anti-aircraft guns]] in single mounts, as well as 12 [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon {{convert|20|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} cannon]]s, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck.{{sfn|Hazegray|1998}} By the end of the war, ''Casablanca''-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20-mm cannons, and the amount of 40-mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to [[kamikaze]] attacks. Although ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers were designed to function with a crew of 860 and an embarked squadron of 50 to 56, the exigencies of wartime often necessitated the inflation of the crew count. ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. During the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]], she carried 16 [[Grumman F4F Wildcat#FM-1/-2 Wildcat|FM-2]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], and 12 [[Grumman TBF Avenger#TBM|TBM-1C]] [[torpedo bomber]]s, for a total of 28 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=109}} During the [[Battle off Samar]], she carried 17 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 29 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=121}} During the [[Battle of Mindoro]], she carried 24 FM-2 fighters and 9 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 33 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=251}} During the [[Battle of Lingayen Gulf]], she carried 19 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 31 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=277}} During the [[Battle of Okinawa]], she carried 20 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 32 aircraft.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=349}}\n\n==Construction==\nHer construction was awarded to [[Kaiser Shipyards|Kaiser Shipbuilding Company]], [[Vancouver, Washington]] under a [[Maritime Commission]] contract, on 18 June 1942. The escort carrier was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 27 September 1943 under the name ''Kaita Bay'', as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska.{{sfn|Maksel|2012}} She was laid down as MC hull 1115, the twenty-third of a series of fifty ''Casablanca''-class escort carriers. She was renamed ''Savo Island'' on 6 November 1943, as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent ''Casablanca''-class carriers after naval or land engagements.{{sfn|Stubblebine|2011}} She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 22 December 1943; [[Ship sponsor|sponsored]] by Miss Margaret Taffinder; transferred to the [[United States Navy]] and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 3 February 1944, with [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] Clarence Eugene Ekstrom in command.{{sfn|Kaiser Vancouver|2010}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\n==Service history==\nUpon being commissioned, ''Savo Island'' underwent a [[shakedown cruise]] down the West Coast to [[San Diego]], where she took on a load of replacement aircraft. Between 15 March 1944 and 2 July, she underwent two transport missions, ferrying aircraft to bases in the Southwest Pacific. On 6 July, she embarked Composite Squadron (VC) 27, which would be her aircraft contingent throughout the Marianas and Palau Islands campaign and the [[Philippines campaign (1944\u20131945)|Philippines campaign of 1944\u201345]]. After a brief period of training off the waters of San Diego, she sailed west to [[Pearl Harbor]], where similar exercises were conducted. There, on 4 August, she was assigned to Task Group 32.7, the Western Escort Carrier Group, commanded by [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[William Sample]], of the [[United States Third Fleet|3rd Fleet]], assigned to support the planned [[Battle of Peleliu|landings]] on the island of [[Peleliu]], of the [[Palau|Palau Islands]]. Her aircraft contingent began combat operations on 11 September, strafing and bombarding the island to soften up the defenses for the landings. Following the landing of [[United States Marine Corps|marines]], her aircraft transitioned into providing [[close air support]] and patrol missions, up until 30 September.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=109}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\nOn 3 October, she was assigned to and joined Task Group 77.4, which was gathering at [[Manus Island]], part of the [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]].  She, accompanied with eighteen other escort carriers and their screens of [[battleships]], [[cruisers]], and [[destroyers]], steamed on 12 October for [[Leyte Gulf]], where they were expected to support the [[Battle of Leyte|landings]] on [[Leyte]], which marked the beginning of the Philippines campaign. As a part of Task Unit 77.4.2, otherwise known as \"Taffy 2\", commanded by Rear Admiral [[Felix Stump]], she was positioned to the direct south of \"Taffy 3\", which was located to the direct east of the [[San Bernadino Strait]]. Arriving off the island on 18 October, her aircraft began carrying out naval patrols and strikes against predesignated targets. Once the [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth Army]] had landed on 20 October, her aircraft transitioned towards a focus on close air support, supporting the initial advances for the next few days.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=121}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\nOn 23 October, the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] began. Almost the entirety of Japan's remaining surface fleet had been concentrated into a counterattack against the U.S. forces in the vicinity of the Philippines, which had threatened to cut off Japan's vital oil supply from Southeast Asia. Split into three groups, the Southern Force was defeated in the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]], whilst [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[William Halsey Jr.]] sent the Third Fleet in an attack against the diversionary Northern Force. Therefore, the escort carriers which continued providing ground support had no capital ship screening, even as Vice Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]]'s Center Force drove through the San Bernadino Strait during the night.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=148}} On the early morning of 25 October, the Center Force emerged into the waters of the Leyte Gulf, catching Taffy 3, some {{cvt|20|mi}} north of ''Savo Island'', by surprise.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=153}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\nAs the American command came to an understanding of the severity of the situation, with the Center Force consisting of four battleships, six cruisers, and a large destroyer screen, the entirety of Taffy 2's aircraft were recalled to join the defense. ''Savo Island''{{'}}s fighters and torpedo bombers were not equipped to attack surface ships, with most of her bombers being loaded with [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]] and missiles for ground attacks.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=196}} Nonetheless, aircraft from ''Savo Island''{{'}}s VC-27 were amongst Taffy 2's first wave of strikes, launched at 7:37 in the morning. Some of the destroyers within Taffy 2's screen wandered north, before being confronted with some Japanese naval gunfire and being ordered to withdraw towards the escort carriers. Overall, ''Savo Island'' launched six strikes against the Japanese forces, with her aircraft notably landing a torpedo hit on a Japanese battleship and shooting down an [[Aichi E13A]] [[reconnaissance]] [[seaplane]] caught in the middle of the action.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=221}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\nDiscouraged by the stiff resistance his Center Force had faced, including the loss of three cruisers, Admiral Kurita issued orders to withdraw in the late morning, sparing Taffy 3 from further destruction. As the Japanese forces withdrew, fighters from ''Savo Island'' took the opportunity to down four more Japanese planes.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=225}} Nonetheless, the escort carriers underwent concentrated Japanese attack again in the afternoon, this time from the air, including some of the first usage of [[kamikaze]] suicide attacks. The carrier continued supporting ground operations until 30 October, when Taffy 2 was reorganized into Task Unit 77.4.4, and ordered to withdraw back to Manus Island to rearm and replenish.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=241}} She sortied from Manus on 19 November, providing cover for convoys proceeding to Leyte Gulf from 22 November to 27 November, accompanied by two other escort carriers. Upon completing this task, she replenished at [[Kossol Roads]], before she left on 10 December, this time in support of the [[Battle of Mindoro|landings]] on the island of [[Mindoro]]. Her aircraft provided air cover as the landing crafts unloaded their troops, and provided close air support as they advanced. They also targeted air fields, from which kamikaze aircraft were beginning to make regular forays. The escort carriers were relieved by Army aircraft on 15 December, but she stayed offshore until 17 December because of indications of a Japanese surface raid, which never materialized. On 17 December, she steamed back to Manus Island.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=264}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\n[[File:SavoIslandSuluSea.jpg|thumb|left|''Savo Island'' underway in the Sulu Sea, photographed from the battleship {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|2}}.]]\nAt Manus Island, ''Savo Island'' was assigned to Task Unit 77.4.2., the San Fabian Carrier Group.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=277}} On 27 December, the carriers, escorted by a large surface fleet, left Manus bound for [[Lingayen Gulf]], to the west of [[Luzon]]. There, the carriers would support the [[Sixth United States Army|6th Army]] [[Invasion of Lingayen Gulf|landings]] on Luzon. As a part of Task Unit 77.4.2., ''Savo Island'' would provide air support and cover for the [[I Corps (United States)|I Army Corps]], which would land around the [[San Fabian, Pangasinan|San Fabian]] area. Pausing at [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]], the carriers entered the [[Sulu Sea]] on 3 January 1945, where they began being harried by aircraft, circling around on radar. Japanese planes continued appearing around the periphery of the American forces throughout 4 January, but it was not until 17:00 in the evening that the Japanese forces coalesced into a [[kamikaze]] strike, attacking at 17:12, achieving complete surprise, and sinking {{USS|Ommaney Bay|CVE-79|2}}.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=281}} \n\nThe following day, on 5 January, the kamikazes returned. At 17:43 in the evening, the [[battleship]] {{USS|New Mexico|BB-40|2}} reported planes approaching from her starboard bow, and shortly afterwards, {{USS|Manila Bay|CVE-61|2}} had been hit by two kamikazes, heavily damaging the ship. A few minutes after the attack on ''Manila Bay'', a [[Nakajima Ki-43]] kamikaze dove towards ''Savo Island''. Engaged by several anti-aircraft batteries, the plane being trailing smoke some {{cvt|800|yds}} away from the carrier. As a reaction, ''Savo Island'' turned hard to starboard, whilst its {{cvt|24|in}} searchlight was pointed at the aircraft to try to blind the pilot. The plane, moving erratically, passed between the carrier's mast and the whip antenna, shearing off the carrier's radar antenna, before diving into the sea.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=295}}\n\nOn 6 January, the carriers proceeded into Lingayen Gulf, and started a heavy bombardment of Japanese defenses, flying 5,971 sorties in eleven days. On 9 January, the 6th Army moved onshore, encountering little resistance. ''Savo Island'' remained on station until 17 January, when the [[United States Air Force]] took over air operations on Luzon.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=316}}  She then proceeded south to operate to the northwest of Mindoro, to guard against any counterattacks on the American garrisons situated throughout the Northern Philippines, staying on station from 17 January until 29 January. During this period, on 19 January, Captain William Donald Anderson took command of the ship. Upon completing her patrols, she then provided cover for landings near [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]] on 29 and 30 January, before retiring to [[Ulithi]] for repairs and replenishment. There, her aircraft contingent, Composite Squadron 27, was replaced with Composite Squadron 91, which had previously served upon {{USS|Kitkun Bay|CVE-71|2}}. Upon receiving replacement pilots, she began a brief period of training exercises, before being assigned to Task Unit 52.1.1, in preparation for the [[Battle of Okinawa]].{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=349}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}} \n\nTransiting via Leyte, her aircraft provided air cover and patrols en route. On 26 March, along with two other escort carriers, she supported the [[77th Sustainment Brigade|77th Infantry Division]] as it occupied the [[Kerama Islands]]. On 27 March, she began bombing the main island of [[Okinawa]], with her fighters flying antiaircraft and antisubmarine patrols. On 7 April, the carrier left Task Unit 52.1.1., trading places with {{USS|Shamrock Bay|CVE-84|2}}, part of Task Group 50.8, the Logistics Support Group.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=363}} Therefore, from 7 to 16 April, she screened a replenishment convoy proceeding to the east of Okinawa. Upon the completion of that task, she continued providing close air support for American forces advancing down Okinawa. On 27 April, her aircraft bombed [[Sakishima Gunto]], an island situated halfway between Okinawa and [[Taiwan|Formosa]]. On 29 April, ''Savo Island'', along with {{USS|Marcus Island|CVE-77|2}} and {{USS|Saginaw Bay|CVE-82|2}}, were discharged from their task group, all sailing for overhaul in San Diego.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=380}} ''Savo Island''{{'}}s aircraft contingent, Composite Squadron 91, was traded for {{USS|Makin Island|CVE-93|2}}'s Composite Squadron (VC) 84.{{sfn|Y'Blood|2014|p=381}}{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\n[[Image:CVE-78 Savo Island.jpg|thumb|300px|USS ''Savo Island'' (CVE-78) photographed from the waterline, her flight deck full of aircraft, date and location unknown.]]\n\nAfter finishing overhaul, ''Savo Island'' began a transport mission from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, before transiting back to [[Alameda, California]], on the West Coast. On 6 August, she departed for the [[Aleutian Islands]], arriving on 15 August, right as the [[Surrender of Japan]] was announced. On 31 August, she headed, along with six other escort carriers, to support the [[Occupation of Japan]] in northern [[Honsh\u016b]] and [[Hokkaid\u014d]]. After finishing her duties, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 September, where she was assigned to the \"Magic Carpet\" fleet, which repatriated servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She first loaded occupation troops bound for Japan at [[San Francisco]], before heading west. ''Savo Island'' made a total of three \"Magic Carpet\" voyages, repatriating troops from [[Guam]], Pearl Harbor, and Okinawa, respectively. Upon arriving at [[Seattle]] on 14 January 1946, and finishing her final voyage, she transited to the Eastern seaboard, entering [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] harbor on 16 March for inactivation.{{sfn|DANFS|2016}}\n\n''Savo Island'' was decommissioned on 12 December, and [[Reserve fleet|mothballed]] in the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]], as port of its Boston group. Docked at the [[South Boston Naval Annex]], she was reclassified as a helicopter escort carrier ('''CVHE-78''') on 12 June 1955.

Some of the best surviving carved fragments from the castle are displayed in the centre, which also has a shop.\n\n== Wars of Scottish Independence ==\nDuring the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], the castle was destroyed and rebuilt several times as it changed hands between the Scots and the [[England|English]]. Soon after the [[sack of Berwick]] in 1296 by [[Edward I of England]], the castle was taken and made ready for the [[English king]] in 1303. In 1314, however, after the Scottish victory at [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]], the castle was retaken and repaired by [[William de Lamberton|Bishop William Lamberton]], [[Guardian of Scotland]], a loyal supporter of [[Robert I of Scotland|King Robert the Bruce]]. The English had recaptured it again by the 1330s and reinforced its defences in 1336, but were not successful in holding the castle. Sir [[Andrew Moray]], [[Regent of Scotland]] in the absence of [[David II of Scotland|David II]], recaptured it after a siege lasting three weeks. Shortly after this, in 1336-1337, it was destroyed by the Scots to prevent the English from once again using it as a stronghold.\n\nIt remained in this ruined state until Bishop [[Walter Trail]] rebuilt it at the turn of the century. His castle forms the basis of what can be seen today. He completed work on the castle in about 1400 and died within its walls in 1401.\n\n== Home to kings ==\nSeveral notable figures spent time in the castle over the next several years. [[James I of Scotland]] (1406-1437) received part of his education from Bishop [[Henry Wardlaw]], the founder of [[St Andrews University]] in 1410. A later resident, Bishop [[James Kennedy (bishop)|James Kennedy]], was a trusted advisor of [[James II of Scotland]] (1437-1460). In 1445 the castle was the birthplace of [[James III of Scotland]].\n\n== Used as a prison ==\nDuring these years, the castle also served as a notorious [[prison]]. The castle's [[bottle dungeon]] is a dank and airless pit cut out of solid rock below the north-west tower. It housed local miscreants who fell under the Bishop's jurisdiction as well as several more prominent individuals such as [[David Stuart, Duke of Rothesay]] in 1402, [[Murdoch Stewart, 2nd Duke of Albany|Duke Murdoch]] in 1425, and [[Archbishop]] [[Patrick Graham (bishop)|Patrick Graham]], who was judged to be insane and imprisoned in his own castle in 1478.\n\n== Reformation and siege ==\n{{Main|Siege of St Andrews Castle}}\n\nDuring the [[Scottish Reformation]], the castle became a centre of religious persecution and controversy. Referring to the bottle dungeon the Scottish reformer, [[John Knox]], wrote, \"Many of God's Children were imprisoned here.\" In 1521 [[James Beaton]], then [[Archbishop of Glasgow]], won the seat of St Andrews and took up residence in the castle. Beaton altered the defences to enable the castle to withstand a heavy [[artillery]] attack, which was a threat as tensions grew between English [[Protestant]]s and Scottish [[Catholic]]s. In 1538 James Beaton was succeeded by his ambitious and wealthy nephew, Cardinal [[David Beaton]]. His strong opposition to the marriage of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], with Prince Edward (later King [[Edward VI]]), the son and heir of [[Henry VIII of England]], helped to spark renewed fighting in 1544.\n\n[[File:Military mine beneath St. Andrews Castle 2017-05-28.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Mine tunnel dug during the siege in 1546]]\n\nScottish Protestants were increasingly viewed as dangerous turncoats who sided with the English. In 1546 David Beaton imprisoned the Protestant preacher [[George Wishart]] (1513-1546) in the castle's Sea Tower and had him burnt at the stake in front of the castle walls on 1 March. Today, brick lettering with his initials marks the spot where he died. In May the same year, Wishart's friends conspired against the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]. On 26 May they gained entry to the castle by disguising themselves as [[stonemason|masons]] when some building work was in progress. After overcoming the [[garrison]], they murdered Cardinal Beaton and hung his body from his window on the front of the castle.\n\nFollowing this murder, the Protestants took refuge in the castle and formed the first Protestant [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]] in Scotland. A long [[siege]] was ordered by the Scottish Regent, [[James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran]]. In October 1546 a [[Mining (military)|mine]] was begun by the attackers which was successfully counter-mined by the defenders.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/correspondancep00pongoog ''Correspondance Politique de Odet de Selve'', (1888), 54, 10 November 1546]</ref> Both the mine and counter-mine cut through solid rock. They were rediscovered in 1879 and remain open to the public today. Arran heard that an English army was on its way to relieve the Castle and asked Fife Lairds like John Wemyss of that Ilk to come by 4 November 1546, bringing his followers and whatever artillery they had to resist a sea invasion.<ref>Fraser, William, ed., ''Memorials of the family of Wemyss'', vol. 3, Edinburgh (1888), 7, (letter 31 October 1546)</ref> Although Henry VIII made plans to assist the Protestants within the castle,<ref>''State Papers Henry VIII'', vol. 5, part IV part 2, (1836), 572-584.</ref> the invasion never came and his son [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] did not send aid.\n\nDuring an [[armistice]] in April 1547, [[John Knox]] entered the castle and served as the garrison's preacher for the remainder of the siege. For a time Knox had the freedom to pass to and from the castle to preach in the [[parish]] church. This peaceful interlude came to end, however, when a French fleet arrived bringing an Italian engineer [[Leone Strozzi]] who directed a devastating artillery bombardment to dislodge the Protestant [[laird]]s. The lairds knew an expert was in the field when their own Italian engineer observed cannon being winched into position with ropes rather than exposing the besiegers to their fire.<ref>Lindsay of Pitscottie, ''Chronicles of Scotland'', vol. 2, Edinburgh, (1814), 489-490.</ref> Guns were also placed on St Salvator's and the cathedral towers. One of the largest Scottish cannon was called \"thrawynmouthe.\"<ref>''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 9 (1911), 103.</ref> The castle was quickly rendered indefensible. Within six hours according to [[Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie]].<ref>Lindsay of Pitscottie, ''Chronicles of Scotland'', vol. 2, Edinburgh, (1814), 490.</ref> The defeated Protestants were taken away: some were imprisoned in France while others, including Knox, were condemned to the [[galley]]s.\n\n== Decline and current condition ==\n\n[[File:Carving of Cardinal Beaton's Arms.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Beaton's arms on a panel believed to have been removed from one of his private apartments in the castle]]\n\nFollowing this Protestant defeat, the castle was substantially rebuilt by [[John Hamilton (archbishop)|Archbishop John Hamilton]], the illegitimate brother of [[James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran|Regent Arran]], and successor to [[Dr.]] [[David Cardinal Beaton]]. But following his death in 1571 it was mainly occupied by a succession of [[constable]]s. [[Parliament of Scotland|Parliament]] separated the castle from the archbishopric in 1606, and it was granted to the [[Earl of Dunbar]], constable since 1603. In 1612 it was returned to Archbishop [[George Gledstanes]], but further attempts to re-establish the former estates of the Archbishop failed. With the eventual success of the [[Reformation in Scotland]], the office of the bishop was increasingly eroded until it was finally abolished by [[William III of England|William of Orange]] in 1689. Deprived of any function, the castle fell rapidly into ruin. By 1656, it had fallen into such disrepair that the burgh council ordered the use of its materials in repairing the pier. The principal remains are a portion of the south wall enclosing a square tower, the \"bottle dungeon,\" the kitchen tower, and the underground mine and counter-mine.\n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Attributed to Robert Adamson (Scottish - St. Andrews Castle from the East) - Google Art Project - top image.jpg|1843-44 photo of St. Andrews Castle by [[Robert Adamson (photographer)|Robert Adamson]]\nFile:The ruins of St Andrews Castle.jpg|The ruins of St Andrews Castle viewed from St Andrews Pier\nFile:St. Andrews Castle 2017-05-28.jpg|The courtyard of St Andrews Castle\n</gallery>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|St Andrews Castle}}\n*Historic Environment Scotland: [https://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/st-andrews-castle Visitor guide]\n\n{{St Andrews}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Andrews Castle}}\n[[Category:Ruined castles in Fife]]\n[[Category:St Andrews]]\n[[Category:Episcopal palaces in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Defunct prisons in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Fife]]\n[[Category:Historic house museums in Fife]]\n", "text_old": "{{Distinguish|St Andrew's Castle, Hamble}}\n{{Infobox military installation\n|name=St. Andrews Castle\n|location=[[St. Andrews]], [[Fife]], [[Scotland]]\n|image=[[Image:General view of castle from SE.jpg|250px]]\n|caption=St Andrews castle ruins\n|map_type = UK Scotland\n|map_relief= 1\n|map_caption = Shown within Scotland\n|coordinates = {{coord|56.34|-2.79|type:landmark|display=inline}}\n|map_size=220\n|type=\n|built=c.1200\n|builder=[[Bishop Roger|Roger de Beaumont]]\n|controlledby=Bishops of St Andrews\n|materials=stone\n|height=\n|used=Until c.1689\n|condition=Ruined\n|ownership=[[Historic Environment Scotland]]\n|open_to_public= Yes\n}}\n\n'''St Andrew's Castle''' is a [[ruin]] located in the coastal [[Royal Burgh of St Andrews]] in [[Fife]], [[Scotland]].

In 1314, however, after the Scottish victory at [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]], the castle was retaken and repaired by [[William de Lamberton|Bishop William Lamberton]], [[Guardian of Scotland]], a loyal supporter of [[Robert I of Scotland|King Robert the Bruce]]. The English had recaptured it again by the 1330s and reinforced its defences in 1336, but were not successful in holding the castle. Sir [[Andrew Moray]], [[Regent of Scotland]] in the absence of [[David II of Scotland|David II]], recaptured it after a siege lasting three weeks. Shortly after this, in 1336-1337, it was destroyed by the Scots to prevent the English from once again using it as a stronghold.\n\nIt remained in this ruined state until Bishop [[Walter Trail]] rebuilt it at the turn of the century. His castle forms the basis of what can be seen today. He completed work on the castle in about 1400 and died within its walls in 1401.\n\n== Home to kings ==\nSeveral notable figures spent time in the castle over the next several years. [[James I of Scotland]] (1406-1437) received part of his education from Bishop [[Henry Wardlaw]], the founder of [[St Andrews University]] in 1410. A later resident, Bishop [[James Kennedy (bishop)|James Kennedy]], was a trusted advisor of [[James II of Scotland]] (1437-1460). In 1445 the castle was the birthplace of [[James III of Scotland]].\n\n== Used as a prison ==\nDuring these years, the castle also served as a notorious [[prison]]. The castle's [[bottle dungeon]] is a dank and airless pit cut out of solid rock below the north-west tower. It housed local miscreants who fell under the Bishop's jurisdiction as well as several more prominent individuals such as [[David Stuart, Duke of Rothesay]] in 1402, [[Murdoch Stewart, 2nd Duke of Albany|Duke Murdoch]] in 1425, and [[Archbishop]] [[Patrick Graham (bishop)|Patrick Graham]], who was judged to be insane and imprisoned in his own castle in 1478.\n\n== Reformation and siege ==\n{{Main|Siege of St Andrews Castle}}\n\nDuring the [[Scottish Reformation]], the castle became a centre of religious persecution and controversy. Referring to the bottle dungeon the Scottish reformer, [[John Knox]], wrote, \"Many of God's Children were imprisoned here.\" In 1521 [[James Beaton]], then [[Archbishop of Glasgow]], won the seat of St Andrews and took up residence in the castle. Beaton altered the defences to enable the castle to withstand a heavy [[artillery]] attack, which was a threat as tensions grew between English [[Protestant]]s and Scottish [[Catholic]]s. In 1538 James Beaton was succeeded by his ambitious and wealthy nephew, Cardinal [[David Beaton]]. His strong opposition to the marriage of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], with Prince Edward (later King [[Edward VI]]), the son and heir of [[Henry VIII of England]], helped to spark renewed fighting in 1544.\n\n[[File:Military mine beneath St. Andrews Castle 2017-05-28.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Mine tunnel dug during the siege in 1546]]\n\nScottish Protestants were increasingly viewed as dangerous turncoats who sided with the English. In 1546 David Beaton imprisoned the Protestant preacher [[George Wishart]] (1513-1546) in the castle's Sea Tower and had him burnt at the stake in front of the castle walls on 1 March. Today, brick lettering with his initials marks the spot where he died. In May the same year, Wishart's friends conspired against the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]. On 26 May they gained entry to the castle by disguising themselves as [[stonemason|masons]] when some building work was in progress. After overcoming the [[garrison]], they murdered Cardinal Beaton and hung his body from his window on the front of the castle.\n\nFollowing this murder, the Protestants took refuge in the castle and formed the first Protestant [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]] in Scotland. A long [[siege]] was ordered by the Scottish Regent, [[James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran]]. In October 1546 a [[Mining (military)|mine]] was begun by the attackers which was successfully counter-mined by the defenders.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/correspondancep00pongoog ''Correspondance Politique de Odet de Selve'', (1888), 54, 10 November 1546]</ref> Both the mine and counter-mine cut through solid rock. They were rediscovered in 1879 and remain open to the public today. Arran heard that an English army was on its way to relieve the Castle and asked Fife Lairds like John Wemyss of that Ilk to come by 4 November 1546, bringing his followers and whatever artillery they had to resist a sea invasion.<ref>Fraser, William, ed., ''Memorials of the family of Wemyss'', vol. 3, Edinburgh (1888), 7, (letter 31 October 1546)</ref> Although Henry VIII made plans to assist the Protestants within the castle,<ref>''State Papers Henry VIII'', vol. 5, part IV part 2, (1836), 572-584.</ref> the invasion never came and his son [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] did not send aid.\n\nDuring an [[armistice]] in April 1547, [[John Knox]] entered the castle and served as the garrison's preacher for the remainder of the siege. For a time Knox had the freedom to pass to and from the castle to preach in the [[parish]] church. This peaceful interlude came to end, however, when a French fleet arrived bringing an Italian engineer [[Leone Strozzi]] who directed a devastating artillery bombardment to dislodge the Protestant [[laird]]s. The lairds knew an expert was in the field when their own Italian engineer observed cannon being winched into position with ropes rather than exposing the besiegers to their fire.<ref>Lindsay of Pitscottie, ''Chronicles of Scotland'', vol. 2, Edinburgh, (1814), 489-490.</ref> Guns were also placed on St Salvator's and the cathedral towers. One of the largest Scottish cannon was called \"thrawynmouthe.\"<ref>''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 9 (1911), 103.</ref> The castle was quickly rendered indefensible. Within six hours according to [[Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie]].<ref>Lindsay of Pitscottie, ''Chronicles of Scotland'', vol. 2, Edinburgh, (1814), 490.</ref> The defeated Protestants were taken away: some were imprisoned in France while others, including Knox, were condemned to the [[galley]]s.\n\n== Decline and current condition ==\n\n[[File:Carving of Cardinal Beaton's Arms.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Beaton's arms on a panel believed to have been removed from one of his private apartments in the castle]]\n\nFollowing this Protestant defeat, the castle was substantially rebuilt by [[John Hamilton (archbishop)|Archbishop John Hamilton]], the illegitimate brother of [[James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran|Regent Arran]], and successor to [[Dr.]] [[David Cardinal Beaton]]. But following his death in 1571 it was mainly occupied by a succession of [[constable]]s. [[Parliament of Scotland|Parliament]] separated the castle from the archbishopric in 1606, and it was granted to the [[Earl of Dunbar]], constable since 1603. In 1612 it was returned to Archbishop [[George Gledstanes]], but further attempts to re-establish the former estates of the Archbishop failed. With the eventual success of the [[Reformation in Scotland]], the office of the bishop was increasingly eroded until it was finally abolished by [[William III of England|William of Orange]] in 1689. Deprived of any function, the castle fell rapidly into ruin. By 1656, it had fallen into such disrepair that the burgh council ordered the use of its materials in repairing the pier. The principal remains are a portion of the south wall enclosing a square tower, the \"bottle dungeon,\" the kitchen tower, and the underground mine and counter-mine.\n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Attributed to Robert Adamson (Scottish - St. Andrews Castle from the East) - Google Art Project - top image.jpg|1843-44 photo of St. Andrews Castle by [[Robert Adamson (photographer)|Robert Adamson]]\nFile:The ruins of St Andrews Castle.jpg|The ruins of St Andrews Castle viewed from St Andrews Pier\nFile:St. Andrews Castle 2017-05-28.jpg|The courtyard of St Andrews Castle\n</gallery>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|St Andrews Castle}}\n*Historic Environment Scotland: [https://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/st-andrews-castle Visitor guide]\n\n{{St Andrews}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Andrews Castle}}\n[[Category:Ruined castles in Fife]]\n[[Category:St Andrews]]\n[[Category:Episcopal palaces in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Defunct prisons in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Fife]]\n[[Category:Historic house museums in Fife]]\n", "name_user": "Zh84", "label": "safe", "comment": "Corrected \"St Andrew's Castle\" to \"St Andrews Castle\".", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews_Castle"}

He has played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[Baltimore Orioles]], [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], [[Kansas City Royals]], [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], [[Toronto Blue Jays]], [[Atlanta Braves]], [[New York Mets]], and [[Philadelphia Phillies]].\n\nBautista's professional career began when the Pittsburgh Pirates selected him in the 20th round of the [[2000 Major League Baseball draft]]. In {{by|2010}}, he became the 26th member of the [[50 home run club]], while leading MLB in [[home runs]] for the first of two consecutive seasons. From 2010\u2013{{by|2015}}, Bautista hit more home runs than any player in the major leagues.  An [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star]] selection six consecutive times, he has won three [[Silver Slugger Awards]] and two [[Hank Aaron Award]]s. In addition, he has received the [[American League]] (AL) [[Major League Baseball Player of the Month|Player of the Month Award]], five times, and the AL [[Major League Baseball Player of the Week Award|Player of the Week]], four times. Before being traded to the Blue Jays, Bautista primarily played [[third base]].\n\nAlthough major league [[Scout (sport)|scouts]] initially took note of Bautista while he was in [[junior college]] for his batting skills \u2013 including [[Power hitter|power hitting]] potential and a strong throwing arm \u2013 his career would take many detours, until Bautista finally realized his potential, in 2010. He made his MLB debut with the Baltimore Orioles in {{by|2004}}, and, that year, became the first player ever to appear on [[#Early career|five MLB rosters in one season]]. The last of those clubs was the Pirates, where he would spend four-plus seasons, seeing time as a [[utility player]], while playing at six different positions, including [[designated hitter]] (DH).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/players/7264/career;_ylt=AluOYHKnUCIIU54UZfxxEc.FCLcF |title=Jos\u00e9 Bautista \u2013 Toronto Blue Jays \u2013 Career Statistics \u2013 MLB |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=September 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBautista was then traded to the Blue Jays, in August {{by|2008}}.<ref>{{cite web |author=Blue Jays Press Release |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20080821&content_id=3344473&vkey=pr_tor&fext=.jsp&c_id=tor&partnerId=rss_tor |title=Blue Jays acquire Bautista |publisher=[[MLB.com]] |date=August 21, 2008 |accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref> After making adjustments to his swing, he broke through with ten home runs in September {{by|2009}}.

In {{by|2011}}, Bautista set up a program that assists athletes from the [[Dominican Republic]] to attend universities in the United States.\n\n==Early life==\nComing from a [[middle-class]] family in the [[Dominican Republic]] that placed great importance on education, Bautista began studying English at age eight.  His mother was an accountant and [[financial planner]], and his father, who had earned a [[master's degree]] in [[agricultural engineering]] in Hungary, ran poultry farms.  Bautista attended a private high school, De La Salle High School, in [[Santo Domingo]].  He was aided by the Latin Athletes Education Fund,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/05/sports/baseball/05odermann.html|title=Education fund for latin players quietly changes lives |last=Schwarz|first=Alan|work=nytimes.com|date=May 5, 2008|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}</ref> designed for players from Spanish-speaking countries aspiring to play [[college baseball]] in the United States.

The [[Cincinnati Reds]] offered him $300,000, which Bautista accepted; however, before the contract could become official, the team changed [[List of Cincinnati Reds owners and executives|ownership]] and subsequently rescinded the offer.  Bautista then created a highlight tape of himself using a [[camcorder]] and sent it to various colleges in the United States.  There was no response until he received a call from Oscar P\u00e9rez, whom he had known from the Quique Cruz League in the Dominican Republic.  P\u00e9rez informed him of the Latin Athletes Education Fund, designed for players from Spanish-speaking countries aspiring to play [[college baseball]] in the United States.  He connected Bautista with Don Odermann, a businessman in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].  Odermann, who assisted baseball players from Latin America desiring to play baseball in the US, knew that [[Chipola College]], a [[junior college]] in [[Marianna, Florida]], was seeking an everyday player.

[[right fielder]] and [[third baseman]]. He has played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[Baltimore Orioles]], [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], [[Kansas City Royals]], [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], [[Toronto Blue Jays]], [[Atlanta Braves]], [[New York Mets]], and [[Philadelphia Phillies]].\n\nBautista's professional career began when the Pittsburgh Pirates selected him in the 20th round of the [[2000 Major League Baseball draft]]. In {{by|2010}}, he became the 26th member of the [[50 home run club]], while leading MLB in [[home runs]] for the first of two consecutive seasons. From 2010\u2013{{by|2015}}, Bautista hit more home runs than any player in the major leagues.  An [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star]] selection six consecutive times, he has won three [[Silver Slugger Awards]] and two [[Hank Aaron Award]]s. In addition, he has received the [[American League]] (AL) [[Major League Baseball Player of the Month|Player of the Month Award]], five times, and the AL [[Major League Baseball Player of the Week Award|Player of the Week]], four times. Before being traded to the Blue Jays, Bautista primarily played [[third base]].\n\nAlthough major league [[Scout (sport)|scouts]] initially took note of Bautista while he was in [[junior college]] for his batting skills \u2013 including [[Power hitter|power hitting]] potential and a strong throwing arm \u2013 his career would take many detours, until Bautista finally realized his potential, in 2010. He made his MLB debut with the Baltimore Orioles in {{by|2004}}, and, that year, became the first player ever to appear on [[#Early career|five MLB rosters in one season]]. The last of those clubs was the Pirates, where he would spend four-plus seasons, seeing time as a [[utility player]], while playing at six different positions, including [[designated hitter]] (DH).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/players/7264/career;_ylt=AluOYHKnUCIIU54UZfxxEc.FCLcF |title=Jos\u00e9 Bautista \u2013 Toronto Blue Jays \u2013 Career Statistics \u2013 MLB |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=September 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBautista was then traded to the Blue Jays, in August {{by|2008}}.<ref>{{cite web |author=Blue Jays Press Release |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20080821&content_id=3344473&vkey=pr_tor&fext=.jsp&c_id=tor&partnerId=rss_tor |title=Blue Jays acquire Bautista |publisher=[[MLB.com]] |date=August 21, 2008 |accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref> After making adjustments to his swing, he broke through with ten home runs in September {{by|2009}}.

In {{by|2015}}, while playing in the [[Major League Baseball postseason|playoffs]] for the first time, his [[Bat flip#Jos\u00e9 Bautista bat flip|bat flip]] in the [[2015 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]] (ALDS) caused a sensation that became a symbol of Toronto's first playoff appearance in 22 years. In {{by|2011}}, Bautista set up a program that assists athletes from the [[Dominican Republic]] to attend universities in the United States.\n\n==Early life==\nComing from a [[middle-class]] family in the [[Dominican Republic]] that placed great importance on education, Bautista began studying English at age eight.  His mother was an accountant and [[financial planner]], and his father, who had earned a [[master's degree]] in [[agricultural engineering]] in Hungary, ran poultry farms.  Bautista attended a private high school, De La Salle High School, in [[Santo Domingo]].  He was aided by the Latin Athletes Education Fund,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/05/sports/baseball/05odermann.html|title=Education fund for latin players quietly changes lives |last=Schwarz|first=Alan|work=nytimes.com|date=May 5, 2008|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}</ref> designed for players from Spanish-speaking countries aspiring to play [[college baseball]] in the United States.

The [[Cincinnati Reds]] offered him $300,000, which Bautista accepted; however, before the contract could become official, the team changed [[List of Cincinnati Reds owners and executives|ownership]] and subsequently rescinded the offer.  Bautista then created a highlight tape of himself using a [[camcorder]] and sent it to various colleges in the United States.  There was no response until he received a call from Oscar P\u00e9rez, whom he had known from the Quique Cruz League in the Dominican Republic.  P\u00e9rez informed him of the Latin Athletes Education Fund, designed for players from Spanish-speaking countries aspiring to play [[college baseball]] in the United States.  He connected Bautista with Don Odermann, a businessman in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].  Odermann, who assisted baseball players from Latin America desiring to play baseball in the US, knew that [[Chipola College]], a [[junior college]] in [[Marianna, Florida]], was seeking an everyday player.  There, Bautista played for two years until being drafted.<ref name=vagabond/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2015/02/10/jose-bautista-toronto-blue-jays-bautista-family-education-fund |title=Jose Bautista giving back to Latin America by giving kids an education |last=Bradley |first=Jeff |work=si.com|date=February 13, 2015|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n===Early career===\nThe [[2000 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] drafted Jos\u00e9 Bautista in the 20th round of the [[2000 Major League Baseball draft]].

He made his MLB debut with Baltimore on April 4, 2004. After playing 16 games with the Orioles, the [[2004 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] claimed him off [[Major League Baseball transactions#Waivers|waivers]] on June 3.

In [[2006 Pittsburgh Pirates season|2006]], his first full season in the major leagues, Bautista [[Batting average (baseball)|hit]] .235 with 16 [[home run]]s (HR) and 51 [[runs batted in]] (RBI).  The following season in 2007, he posted similar numbers in 142 games, finishing the season with a batting average of .254, 15 home runs and 63 RBI.  That same year, he became the starting [[third baseman]] for the Pittsburgh Pirates.  He took over for reigning National League [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|batting champion]] [[Freddy Sanchez]], who moved to [[Second baseman|second base]].\n\nBautista was to be the Pirates' starting third baseman and backup outfielder in [[2008 Pittsburgh Pirates season|2008]].  From June 14 to 24, he hit five home runs in a span of nine games against [[interleague]] opponents [[2008 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore]], [[2008 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]], [[2008 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]], and the [[2008 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]].  However, he struggled offensively for most of the year, and after the 2008 trade deadline Bautista lost his starting job to the newly acquired [[Andy LaRoche]].

One was to move first base coach [[Dwayne Murphy]] to replace the retiring [[Gene Tenace]] as hitting coach.

RK Bosna competes in the [[Handball Championship of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Handball Cup of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].\n\n== History ==\n<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Igrali\u0161te.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Old asphalted playing-field of RK Bosna]] -->\nAfter Ferid Semi\u0107 brought the first [[Team handball|handball]] ball to [[Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Visoko]], and when the congress was held on 9 February 1954, sport society Mladost was born. Its founders were Ferid Semi\u0107 and Vladimir Joli\u0107. The first game was held on 9 May 1954 when Visoko was beaten by [[Sarajevo]] by 25:9.\n\n===Handball club Bosna established===\nOn 15 March 1960 club's name Mladost was renamed to Handball Club Bosna. From the autumn of 1962 all games were held at city's asphalted handball playing-field. The most important moment for Visoko's handball team was the arrival of Sr\u0111an Praljak: the first real handball coach, who from 1 August 1960 to 31 July 1971 created the characteristic Visoko handball school. This was second generation of players with Nevzad Sir\u0107o at the helm, who was one of the best players in the history of Visoko's handball.\n\n===First Yugoslav league===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Nevzad Sirco.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Nevzad Sir\u0107o, one of the best players ever from Visoko]] -->\nAfter only four years, Bosna entered the strong First league of [[Yugoslavia]] in 1964, and at same time won the Cup of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and runner-up in Cup of Yugoslavia. On 20 May 1970, club was renamed to RK Vitex, after economic giant Vitex, and continued with that name until 1991. The club remained in the First handball league of Yugoslavia for seven years until it was relegated to second in 1971/72 season. This wasn't for long, and after only one year, the club re-entered the first league and achieved its best place ever: fourth in 1974/75 season in one of the best handball leagues of that time. It stayed for two more seasons when Bosna was relegated in 1976 to Second Yugoslav league, which was last season for club in first league. Altogether, Bosna have played 10 seasons in elite Yugoslav handball league, having won 3 times Cup of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Pioneer selection became champions of Yugoslavia in 1971. Juniors were two times runners-up, in 1973 and 1974. Zdenko Antovi\u0107 became standard player for Yugoslavian national handball team in 1976, 1977 and 1979, other players like Kemal Vra\u017ei\u0107 and Ranko Antovi\u0107 didn't stay for long.\n\n===Decline===\nAt around this time, the game of handball began to be played in halls, and asphalted playing-fields started to be abandoned. Visoko didn't have a hall so it was forced to play in other towns like [[Sarajevo]], [[Vogo\u0161\u0107a]], [[Zavidovi\u0107i]] and [[Had\u017ei\u0107i]]. After only three seasons Bosna was relegated again to the second league in 1975/76 season. From then until 1991, the club couldn't get back into first league. The most significant result was winning the cup of [[SR BiH]] in 1981. Finally, Visoko got its first handball hall, sports centre Mladost, which was finished on 9 April 1986.\n\n===War and recovery===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:RkBosna.jpg|thumb|200px|Handball derby in Visoko between home team Bosna, and Sarajevo]] -->\nAfter the devastating [[Bosnian War]], the hall and clubs offices were damaged, but Bosna started to recover. From 1995 Bosna twice won the First league of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (seasons 1996/97 and 1998/99) and record three times Cup of BiH (1995, 1998 and in 2001). Bosna had involvement in [[European Handball Federation|EHF]] competitions such as [[EHF Cup]] and [[EHF Cup Winner's Cup]]. At the end of 2001. Bosna was far most successful handball team in after war Bosnia and Herzegovina. But that year brought financial breakdown, Bosna lost most of its players and club staff, which resulted in total result crisis which lasted to 2005. From 2001 till today Bosna has not achieved significant honors, only managing to stay in the First league through good home form.\n\nOnly after 2005 club got its financial aid with signing more sponsors. Results were visible after just one season, in 2006 Bosna finished eight out of twelve clubs in the league, which was relief because club was in past season always on edge being relegated. In 2007 club finished second in Premier League and will play in [[EHF Cup]]. This is big success for club, because it is first time since 2002 that Bosna qualified form one European competition. Edhem Sir\u0107o was first scorer for Bosna, being followed by Amir \u010caki\u0107 and Faruk Halilbegovi\u0107.\n\n=== 2007/2008 season ===\nFor the 2007/2008 season Bosna was reinforced by three new players. [[Muhamed Mustafi\u0107]], a right wing, returned to his parent club after playing 3 successful seasons in HC Bosna Sarajevo which competed successfully in the [[EHF Champions League]], and later the [[EHF Cup Winner's Cup]] where they played semi-finals. Kenan Ahi\u0107, on loan to the Sarajevo side last season returned to Visoko. The third player is Aldin Begagi\u0107, a pivot men from Krivaja and later Gora\u017ede. \n \nIn the first round of [[EHF Cup]] Bosna played against handball club Sutjeska from [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], and passed after playing draw match in Nik\u0161i\u0107, and scored win in Visoko. Result in Nik\u0161i\u0107 was 21-21, but in Visoko home team Bosna defeated Montenegrin side by 38-27. In second round Bosna was defeated by Gold Club from Slovenia. The first game in Slovenia was a draw (37-37), but the Slovenians managed to defeat the Bosnian side at home, and went through.\n\n==Accomplishments==\n\n=== Domestic ===\n'''Yugoslavia'''\n\n*'''[[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|SRBiH]] Cup:''' \n**'''Winners (4)''': 1965, 1968, 1971, 1982\n*'''[[Yugoslav Handball Cup]]'''\n** Runner-up (1): 1965\n*'''[[Yugoslav Handball Championship]]'''\n** 1975 - 4th place\n\n'''Bosnia and Herzegovina \u2013 5'''\n\n*'''[[Handball Cup of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Cup]]:''' \n**'''Winners (3):''' 1995, 1998, 2001\n**Runner-up (1): 2018\n*'''[[Handball Championship of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Championship]]:''' \n**'''Winners (2):''' 1997, 1999\n**Runner-up (1): 2007\n\n=== European  ===\n\n* '''EHF Cup'''\n** 1/8 finalist: 1999/2000<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurohandball.com/ec/ehfc/men/1999-00/round/2/1/8-finals|title=European Handball Federation - 1999/00 Men's EHF Cup / 1/8-finals|website=www.eurohandball.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-13}}</ref>\n\n==Notable former players==\n\n*{{flagicon|YUG}} [[Sr\u0111an Praljak]]\n*{{flagicon|YUG}} Ranko Antovi\u0107\n*{{flagicon|YUG}} Nevzad Sir\u0107o \n*{{flagicon|YUG}} Kemal Vra\u017ei\u0107\n*{{flagicon|YUG}} Zdenko Antovi\u0107\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} Adis Had\u017ei\u0107\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} Edhem Sir\u0107o\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} Mahir D\u017eud\u017eo\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} [[Faruk Vra\u017eali\u0107]]\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} [[Muhamed Mustafi\u0107]]\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} [[Faruk Halilbegovi\u0107]]\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} Amir \u010caki\u0107\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} Mirza Hurem\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} [[Adnan Harmandi\u0107]]\n\n==Notable former coaches==\n*{{flagicon|YUG}} Sr\u0111an Praljak\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} Halid Demirovi\u0107\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} Zdenko Antovi\u0107\n*{{flagicon|YUG}} Nevzad Sir\u0107o\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} Senad Skopljak\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n\n*[http://www.rkbosna.ba Official page]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070314001447/http://www.rkbosna.ba/ekipa.php Current roster of team]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071230021805/http://www.rkbosna.ba/galerija_seniori.php Photo gallery, 1954-2006]\n\n[[Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina handball clubs]]\n[[Category:Visoko]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox handball club\n| clubname    = '''HC Bosna Visoko'''\n| image       = \n| fullname    = Handball club Bosna\n| short name  = \n| founded     = 1954\n| ground      = Sport Centre Mladost\n| capacity    = \n| chairman    = Adnan Deli\u0107\n| manager     = Senad Skopljak \n| league      = \n| season      = \n| position    = \n| website     = http://www.rkbosna.ba \n| colour1     = green\n| colour2     = white\n| pattern_la1 = \n| pattern_b1  = _unknown\n| pattern_ra1 = \n| pattern_sh1 = \n| leftarm1    = \n| body1       = \n| rightarm1   = \n| shorts1     = \n| pattern_la2 = \n| pattern_b2  = \n| pattern_ra2 = \n| pattern_sh2 = \n| leftarm2    = \n| body2       = \n| rightarm2   = \n| shorts2     = \n}}\n\n'''RK Bosna Visoko''' (''[[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]: Rukometni klub Bosna'') is a [[team handball|handball]] club from [[Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Visoko]], founded on 9 February 1954.
