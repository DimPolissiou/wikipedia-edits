The battle was fought on 12 April 1782 off the east coast of [[Ceylon]], near a rocky islet called Providien, south of [[Trincomalee]].<ref name=cunat128>Cunat, p.128</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\nIn 1778, France had entered the [[American Revolutionary War]]; and in 1780 Britain declared war on the [[Dutch Republic]] after the Dutch refused to stop trading military supplies with France and America. The British had rapidly gained control over most French and Dutch outposts in India when news of these events reached India, spawning the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]] in the process.\n\nIn March 1781, French Admiral [[Pierre Andre de Suffren Saint Tropez|Bailli de Suffren]] was dispatched on a mission to provide military assistance to French colonies in [[India]], leading a fleet of five ships, seven transports, and a corvette to escort the transports from [[Brest, France|Brest]]. After a [[Battle of Porto Praya|happenstance battle]] with the British fleet at [[Porto Praya]] in the [[Cape Verde Islands]] in April, the French fleet stopped at the Dutch-controlled [[Cape of Good Hope]] in October. Troops were left to assist the Dutch in defence of that colony while the fleet was reinforced by additional ships with command transferred to the elderly Admiral [[Thomas d'Estienne d'Orves]]. The French fleet sailed on to \u00cele de France (now [[Mauritius]]), arriving at [[Port Louis, Mauritius|Port Louis]] in December. They then sailed for India with transports that carried nearly 3,000 men under the command of the Comte du Chemin. D'Orves died in February 1782, shortly before the fleet arrived off the Indian coast, and Suffren resumed command.\n\nSuffren first sailed for [[Chennai|Madras]], hoping to surprise the British stronghold. When he found the fleet of [[Edward Hughes (admiral)|Sir Edward Hughes]] anchored there on 15 February 1782, he turned south with the intent of landing troops at [[Parangipettai|Porto Novo]], hoping to march up the coast and recapture French and Dutch holdings on the way. Hughes raised anchor and sailed after Suffren. In the [[Battle of Sadras]], both fleets suffered damage without loss of ships, but the French were able to safely land troops at Porto Novo to assist the Mysoreans. Suffren made repairs to his fleet at [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] after that battle; on 23 February, he sailed out to find Hughes, who had gone to [[Trincomalee]] for repairs.\n\nOn 8 April, Hughes' fleet was spotted heading for Trincomalee. Suffren gave chase, but was unable to close for three days. Hughes had to change course on 12 April to continue toward Trincomalee, which gave Suffren the advantage of the wind.\n\n==Battle==\nThe battle lines engaged at about 12:30&nbsp;pm.  Initially, some of Suffren's captains hesitated, not immediately joining in the line (as had also happened at Sadras), but eventually ten of his twelve ships were engaged against the eleven British ships.  ''[[HMS Monmouth (1772)|Monmouth]]'' was the first ship to quit the British line after being dismasted, and ''Superb'' also suffered significant damage in the early rounds.  Hughes was able to regain advantage by ordering his fleet to [[Jibe (sailing)|wear ship]], and the battle began to turn against the French.  Around 6&nbsp;pm, a storm arose; the combatants, close to a [[lee shore]], broke off the battle to attend to the risks the storm presented. Darkness from the storm and then nightfall precluded further battle that day.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe fleets had anchored near enough to each other that Suffren again positioned for battle. Hughes, however, had a convoy to protect, and sailed for Trincomalee. Suffren sailed south and anchored at [[Batticaloa]], which was still under Dutch control, where he spent six weeks for repairs and resupply. While there, he received orders to sail to \u00cele de France (Mauritius) to escort another troop convoy. Suffren chose to disregard this order, as the risk posed by Hughes to French operations required his full strength, and he could not trust his captains. The captains of ''Vengeur'' and ''Art\u00e9sien'', the two ships that stayed out of the action, were reported for their failure to obey orders, and his second-in-command was intriguing with some of the other captains against him.\n\n== Order of battle ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Captain

While there, he received orders to sail to \u00cele de France (Mauritius) to escort another troop convoy. Suffren chose to disregard this order, as the risk posed by Hughes to French operations required his full strength, and he could not trust his captains. The captains of ''Vengeur'' and ''Art\u00e9sien'', the two ships that stayed out of the action, were reported for their failure to obey orders, and his second-in-command was intriguing with some of the other captains against him.\n\n== Order of battle ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Captain

{"title_page": "History of the Bahamas", "text_new": "Bootyholebetween about 500 and 800 AD from other islands of the [[Caribbean]].ancestors came from mainland South America, where Arawakan-language peoples were present in most territories, and especially along the northeastern coast.\n\nRecorded history began on 12 October 1492, when [[Christopher Columbus]] landed on the island of [[Guanahani]], which he renamed [[San Salvador Island]] on his first voyage to the [[New World]]. The earliest permanent European settlement was in 1648 on [[Eleuthera]]. During the 18th century [[slave trade]], many Africans were brought to the Bahamas as slaves to work for free. Their descendants now constitute 85% of the Bahamian population. The Bahamas gained independence from the [[United Kingdom]] on July 10, 1973.\n\n==Pre-history==\nSometime between 500 and 800 AD, Ta\u00ednos began crossing in [[dugout canoe]]s from [[Hispaniola]] and/or [[Cuba]] to the Bahamas. Suggested routes for the earliest migrations have been from Hispaniola to the [[Turks and Caicos Islands|Caicos Islands]], from Hispaniola or eastern Cuba to [[Great Inagua Island]], and from central Cuba to [[Long Island, Bahamas|Long Island]] (in the central Bahamas). William Keegan argues that the most likely route was from Hispaniola or Cuba to Great Inagua. Granberry and Vescelius argue for two migrations, from Hispaniola to the Turks and Caicos Islands, and from Cuba to Great Inagua.<ref>Craton:17<br>Granberry and Vescelius:80-86<br>Keegan:48-62</ref>\n\nFrom the initial colonization(s), the Lucayan expanded throughout the Bahamas in some 800 years (c. 700 \u2013 c. 1500), growing to a population of about 40,000. Population density at the time of first European contact was highest in the south-central area of the Bahamas, declining towards the north, reflecting the migration pattern and progressively shorter time of occupation of the northern islands. Known Lucayan settlement sites are confined to the nineteen largest islands in the archipelago, or to smaller cays located less than one km. from those islands. Population density in the southern-most Bahamas remained lower, probably due to the drier climate there (less than 800&nbsp;mm of rain a year on Great Inagua Island and the Turks and Caicos Islands and only slightly higher on Acklins and Crooked Islands and Mayaguana).<ref>Keegan:25, 54-8, 86, 170-3</ref>\n\nIn 1492 [[Christopher Columbus]] sailed from [[Spain]] on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|first voyage]] with three ships, the ''Ni\u00f1a,'' the ''Pinta,'' and the flagship, ''Santa Maria,'' seeking a direct route to [[Asia]]. On 12 October 1492 Columbus reached an island in the Bahamas and claimed it for Spain, an event long regarded by Europeans as the 'discovery' of America. This island was called ''[[Guanahani]]'' by the Lucayan, and San Salvador by the Spanish. The identity of the first American landfall by Columbus remains controversial, but many authors accept [[Samuel E. Morison]]'s identification of Columbus' San Salvador as what was later called Watling (or Watling's) Island. Its name has been officially changed to [[San Salvador Island|San Salvador]]. Columbus visited several other islands in the Bahamas before sailing to present-day Cuba and afterwards to Hispaniola.<ref>Albury:21-33<br>Craton:28-37<br>Keegan:175-205</ref>\n\nThe Bahamas held little interest to the Spanish except as a source of slave labor. Nearly the entire population of Lucayan (almost 40,000 people total) were transported to other islands as laborers over the next 30 years. When the Spanish decided to remove the remaining Lucayans to Hispaniola in 1520, they could find only eleven. The islands remained abandoned and depopulated for 130 years afterwards. With no gold to be found, and the population removed, the Spanish effectively abandoned the Bahamas. They retained titular claims to them until the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris in 1783]], when they ceded them to Britain in exchange for East Florida.<ref>Albury:34-7</ref><ref>Albury:34-7<br>Craton. pp. 37-39<br>Johnson:3<br>Keegan:212, 220-3</ref>\n\nWhen Europeans first landed on the islands, they reported the Bahamas were lushly forested. Cleared to develop the land for [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s, the forests have not regrown and have not been replanted.\n\n==Early English settlement==\nFor many years, historians believed that The Bahamas was not colonized until the 17th century. However, recent studies show that there may have been attempts of colonization by groups from Spain, France, Britain, and the Netherlands. The French settled in Abaco in 1565, and tried again in 1625. In 1648 a group from [[Bermuda]] called 'The Company of Adventurers for the Plantation of the Islands of Eleutheria,' which was led by [[William Sayle]], sailed to the Bahamas to found a colony. These early settlers were [[Puritan]]s and [[Classical republicanism|republicans]]. Bermuda was becoming overcrowded, and the Bahamas offered both religious and political freedom and economic opportunity. The larger of the company's two ships, the ''William'', wrecked on the reef at the north end of what is now called [[Eleuthera Island]], with the loss of all provisions. Despite the arrival of additional settlers, including Europeans, slaves and former African slaves from Bermuda and the receipt of relief supplies from [[Virginia]] and [[New England]], the Eleuthera colony struggled for many years, hampered by poor soil, fighting between settlers, and conflict with the Spanish. In the mid-1650s many of the settlers returned to Bermuda. The remaining settlers founded communities on [[Harbour Island, Bahamas|Harbour Island]] and Saint George's Cay ([[Spanish Wells]]) at the north end of Eleuthera. In 1670 about 20 families lived in the Eleuthera communities.<ref>Albury:41-6<br>Johnson:3-4</ref>\n\nIn 1666 other colonists from Bermuda settled on [[New Providence]], which soon became the center of population and commerce in the Bahamas, with almost 500 people living on the island by 1670. Unlike the Eleutherians, who were primarily farmers, the first settlers on New Providence made their living from the sea, salvaging (mainly Spanish) wrecks, making salt, and taking fish, turtles, [[conch]]s and [[ambergris]]. Farmers from Bermuda soon followed the seamen to New Providence, where they found good, plentiful land. Neither the Eleutherian colony nor the settlement on New Providence had any legal standing under English law. In 1670 the Proprietors of Carolina were issued a patent for the Bahamas, but the governors sent by the Proprietors had difficulty imposing their authority on the independent-minded residents of New Providence.<ref>Albury:47-51<br>Johnson:4</ref>\n\nThe early settlers continued to live much as they had in Bermuda, fishing, hunting turtles, whales, and seals, finding [[ambergris]], making salt on the drier islands, cutting the abundant hardwoods of the islands for lumber, [[dyewood]] and medicinal bark; and [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|wrecking]], or salvaging wrecks. The Bahamas were close to the sailing routes between Europe and the Caribbean, so shipwrecks in the islands were common, and wrecking was the most lucrative occupation available to the Bahamians.<ref>Johnson:4-5</ref>\n\n==Wreckers, privateers and pirates==\nThe Bahamians soon came into conflict with the Spanish over the salvaging of wrecks. The Bahamian wreckers drove the Spanish away from their wrecked ships, and attacked Spanish salvagers, seizing goods the Spanish had already recovered from the wrecks. When the Spanish raided the Bahamas, the Bahamians in turn commissioned [[privateer]]s against Spain, even though England and Spain were at peace. In 1684 the Spanish [[Raid on Charles Town|burned the settlements]] on New Providence and Eleuthera, after which they were largely abandoned. New Providence was settled a second time in 1686 by colonists from [[Jamaica]].\n\nIn the 1690s English privateers (England was then at war with [[France]]) made a base in the Bahamas. In 1696 [[Henry Every]] (or Avery), using the assumed name Henry Bridgeman, brought his ship [[Fancy (ship)|''Fancy'']], loaded with pirates' loot, into Nassau harbor. Every bribed the governor, Nicholas Trott (uncle of the [[Nicholas Trott]] who presided at the trial of [[Stede Bonnet]]), with gold and silver, and by leaving him the ''Fancy'', still loaded with 50 tons of [[elephant#Tusks|elephant tusks]] and 100 barrels of gunpowder. Following peace with France in 1697, many of the privateers became [[pirates]]. From this time the pirates increasingly made Nassau, the Bahamian capital founded in 1694, their base. The governors appointed by the Proprietors usually made a show of suppressing the pirates, but most were accused of dealing with them. By 1701 England was at war with France and Spain. In 1703 and in 1706 combined French-Spanish fleets [[Raid on Nassau|attacked and sacked]] Nassau, after which some settlers left, and the Proprietors gave up on trying to govern the islands.<ref>Albury:51-5<br>Craton:70-87<br>Johnson:6<br>Woodard:12-14, 23-24</ref>\n\nWith no functioning government in the Bahamas, English privateers operated from Nassau as their base, in what has been called a \"[[Pirates' republic|privateers' republic]],\" which lasted for eleven years. The raiders attacked French and Spanish ships, while French and Spanish forces burned Nassau several times. The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] ended in 1714, but some privateers were slow to get the news, or reluctant to accept it, and slipped into piracy. One estimate puts at least 1,000 pirates in the Bahamas in 1713, outnumbering the 200 families of more permanent settlers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Albury:58-68<br>Craton:89-90<br>Woodard:89-90, 140, 160</ref>\n\nThe \"privateers' republic\" in Nassau became a \"pirates' republic\". At least 20 pirate captains used Nassau or other places in the Bahamas as a home port during this period, including [[Henry Jennings]], [[Edward Teach]] (Blackbeard), [[Benjamin Hornigold]] and [[Stede Bonnet]]. Many settler families moved from New Providence to Eleuthera or [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]] to escape harassment from the pirates. On the other hand, residents of Harbor Island were happy to serve as middlemen for the pirates, as merchants from [[New England]] and Virginia came there to exchange needed supplies for pirate plunder.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> As mentioned above, the activities of pirates provoked frequent and brutal retaliatory attacks by the French and Spanish.\n\n==Reclaiming Bahamas for the Crown ==\nStarting in 1713, [[Woodes Rogers]] had conceived the idea of leading an expedition to [[Madagascar]] to suppress the pirates there and establish it as a British colony. Rogers' friends [[Richard Steele]] and [[Joseph Addison]] eventually convinced him to tackle the pirates nest in the Bahamas, instead. Rogers and others formed a company to fund the venture. They persuaded the Proprietors of Carolina to surrender the government of the Bahamas to the king, while retaining title to the land. In 1717 [[George I of Great Britain|King George]] appointed Rogers governor of the Bahamas and issued a proclamation granting a pardon to any pirate who surrendered to a British governor within one year.<ref>Albury:69-74<br>Craton:93-6<br>Johnson:7-8<br>Woodard:117-121, 163-168</ref>\n\nWord of the appointment of a new governor and of the offer of pardons reached Nassau ahead of Rogers and his forces. Some of the pirates were willing to accept a pardon and retire from piracy. [[Henry Jennings]] and Christopher Winter, sailed off to find British authorities to confirm their acceptance of the amnesty.\n\nOthers were not ready to give up. Many of those were [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], supporters of the [[House of Stuart]], who identified as enemies of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] King George. Still others simply identified as rebels, or thought they were better off as pirates than trying to earn an honest living. When a Royal Navy ship brought official word to Nassau of the pardon offer, many pirates planned to accept. Soon, however, the recalcitrant parties gained the upper hand, eventually forcing the Navy ship to leave.<ref>Woodard:226-29</ref>\n\n[[Blackbeard]], [[Stede Bonnet]], [[Nicholas Brown (pirate)|Nicholas Brown]] and Edmond Condent left the Bahamas for other territories. [[Charles Vane]], with \"[[Calico Jack]]\" Rackham and [[Edward England]] in his crew, came to prominence at this time. Vane worked to organize resistance to the anticipated arrival of Royal authority, even appealing to [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], the Stuart [[pretender]], for aid in holding the Bahamas and capturing Bermuda for the Stuarts. As aid from the Stuarts failed to materialize and the date for Rogers' arrival approached, Vane and his crew prepared to leave Nassau.<ref>Woodard:236-40, 245-47, 259-61</ref>\n\nWoodes Rogers arrived in Nassau in late July 1718, with his own 460-ton warship, three ships belonging to his company, and an escort of three ships of the Royal Navy. Vane's ship was trapped in Nassau harbor. His crew set that ship on fire, sending it towards Rogers' ships, and escaped in the ensuing confusion in a smaller ship they had seized from another pirate. The remaining population welcomed Rogers; they comprised about 200 settlers and 500 to 700 pirates who wanted to receive pardons, most prominently [[Benjamin Hornigold]].<ref>Woodard:247-48, 262-67</ref> After the pirates' surrender, the Proprietors leased their land in the Bahamas to Rogers' company for 21 years.\n\nRogers controlled Nassau, but Charles Vane was loose and threatening to drive the governor and his forces out. Learning that the King of Spain wanted to expel English from the islands, Rogers worked to improve the defenses of Nassau. He lost nearly 100 men of the new forces due to an unidentified disease, and the Navy ships left for other assignments. Rogers sent four of his ships to Havana to assure the Spanish governor that he was suppressing piracy and to trade for supplies. The crews of ex-pirates and men who had come with Rogers all turned to piracy. The ex-pirate Benjamin Hornigold later caught ten men at [[Green Turtle Cay]] as part of Rogers' suppression effort. Eight were found guilty and hanged in front of the fort.<ref>Woodard:268-72, 286, 301-04</ref>\n\nVane attacked several small settlements in the Bahamas but, after he refused to attack a stronger French frigate, he was deposed for cowardice and replaced as captain by \"[[Calico Jack]]\" Rackham. Vane never returned to the Bahamas; he was eventually caught, convicted and executed in Jamaica. After nearly being captured by Jamaican privateers, and hearing that the king had extended the deadline for pardons for piracy, Rackham and his crew returned to Nassau to surrender to Woodes Rogers.\n\nIn Nassau Rackham became involved with [[Anne Bonny]]; he tried to arrange an annulment of her marriage to another ex-pirate, James Bonny. Rogers blocked the annulment, and Rackham and Bonny left Nassau to be pirates again, taking a small crew and Bonny's friend [[Mary Read]] with them. Within months, Rackham, Bonny and Read were captured and taken to Jamaica. They were convicted of piracy, and Rackham was executed. Bonny and Read were sent to prison, as both were pregnant and therefore excluded from execution. Read died in prison, while Bonny's fate is unknown.<ref>Woodard:304-10, 315-20</ref>\n\nWhen Britain and Spain went to war again in 1719, many of the ex-pirates were commissioned by the British government as privateers. A Spanish invasion fleet set out for the Bahamas, but was diverted to [[Pensacola, Florida]] when it was seized by the French. Rogers continued to improve the defenses of Nassau, spending his personal fortune and going heavily into debt to do so. In 1720, the [[Raid on Nassau (1720)|Spaniards finally attacked Nassau]]. Rogers returned to Britain in 1722 to plead for repayment of the money he had borrowed to build up Nassau, only to find he had been replaced as governor. He was sent to debtors' prison, although his creditors later absolved his debts, gaining him release.\n\nAfter the publication in 1724 of ''A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pirates,'' which praised Rogers' efforts to suppress piracy in the Bahamas, his fortunes began to improve. The king awarded him a pension, retroactive to 1721. In 1728 Rogers was appointed Governor of the Bahamas for a second term. He dissolved the colony's assembly when it would not approve taxes to repair Nassau's defenses. He died in Nassau in 1732.<ref>Woodard:311-14, 325-28</ref>\n\n==Mid-century==\nIn 1741, Governor [[John Tinker (governor)|John Tinker]] and Peter Henry Bruce constructed [[Fort Montague]]. Additionally, the Governor also reported a privateering boom in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in North America. He also reported that over 2300 sumptuous houses were built. In 1768 Governor William Shirley filled in mosquito-breeding swamps and extended Nassau.\n\n==Loyalists, slaves and Black Seminoles==\nDuring the [[American War of Independence]] the Bahamas [[Capture of the Bahamas (1782)|fell to Spanish forces]] under [[Bernardo de Galvez|General Galvez]] in 1782. A British-American Loyalist expedition led by Colonel [[Andrew Deveaux]], [[Capture of the Bahamas (1783)|recaptured the islands]] in 1783. After the [[American Revolution]], the British issued land grants to [[American Loyalists]] who  had gone into exile from the newly established United  States. The sparse population of the Bahamas tripled within a few years. The Loyalists developed cotton as a commodity crop, but it dwindled from insect damage and soil exhaustion. In addition to slaves they brought with them, the planters' descendants imported more African slaves for labour.\n\nMost of the current inhabitants in the islands are descended from the slaves brought to work on the Loyalist plantations. In addition, thousands of captive Africans, who were liberated from foreign slave ships by the British navy after the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolition of the British slave trade in 1807]], were resettled as free persons in the Bahamas.\n\nIn the early 1820s, following the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] ceding Florida from Spain to the United States, hundreds of African slaves and [[Black Seminoles]] escaped from Florida, most settling on [[Andros Island]] in the Bahamas. Three hundred escaped in a mass flight in 1823.<ref name=\"nps\">[http://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/ntf_member/ntf_member_details.htm?SPFID=9173&SPFTerritory=Florida&SPFType=Site&SPFKeywords=Bill%20Baggs%20Cape%20Florida%20State%20Park \"Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park\"], ''Network to Freedom,'' National Park Service, 2010, accessed 10 April 2013.</ref> While the flow was reduced by federal construction of a lighthouse at [[Cape Florida Lighthouse|Cape Florida]] in 1825, slaves continued to find freedom in the Bahamas.<ref name=\"nps\"/>\n\nIn August 1834, the traditional plantation life ended with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|British emancipation of slaves throughout most of its colonies]].

These included the ''[[Hermosa (slave ship)|Hermosa]]'' (1840) and the ''[[Creole case|Creole]]'' (1841), the latter brought in after a slave revolt on board. Britain had notified nations that slaves brought into Bahama and Bermuda waters would be forfeited and freed the slaves, refusing US efforts to recover them.<ref name=\"horne\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=XTLFKrmJPgcC&dq=%22children+of+the+enterprise%22+musson Gerald Horne, ''Negro Comrades of the Crown: African Americans and the British Empire Fight the U.S. Before Emancipation''], New York University (NYU) Press, 2012, pp. 107-108</ref> In 1853 Britain and the US signed a claims treaty and submitted to arbitration for claims dating to 1814; they paid each other in 1855.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], the Bahamas prospered as a base for Confederate blockade-running, bringing in cotton to be shipped to the mills of England and running out arms and munitions. None of these provided any lasting prosperity to the islands, nor did attempts to grow different kinds of crops for export.\n\nWith emancipation, Caribbean societies inherited a rigid racial stratification that was reinforced by the unequal distribution of wealth and power. The three-tier race structure, of whites, [[mixed-race]], and primarily blacks, who comprised the large majority, existed well into the 1940s and in some societies beyond. Like African Americans, many also have European and Native American ancestry. Caribbean societies continue to struggle with racial issues.\n\n==Late-colonial period==\nIn 1911, there was a short-lived movement to make the Bahamas part of [[Canada]]. Although the movement enjoyed the support of many in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] and from the head of [[Sun Life Financial|Sun Life]], a Canadian insurance company, the movement failed. The failure of the movement was, in part, due to the British government's opposition to uniting a predominantly Black colony with a predominantly white country.<ref>Smith, Andrew. 2009. \"Thomas Bassett Macaulay and the Bahamas: Racism, Business and Canadian Sub-imperialism\".

Freeport, on the island of Grand Bahama, was established as a free trade zone in the 1950s and became the Bahama's second city. [[Bank secrecy]] combined with the lack of corporate and income taxes led to a rapid growth in the offshore financial sector during the postwar years.\n\nThe fourth [[James Bond films|James Bond film]], ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', was partly filmed in 1965 in Nassau.\n\nBy the early 1980s, the islands had become a major center for the drug trade, with 90% of all the [[cocaine]] entering the [[United States]] reportedly passing through the Bahamas. Diplomatic relations were established with [[Cuba]] in 1974. A decade later, as increased Cuban immigration to the islands strained the Bahamas\u2019 resources, Cuba refused to sign a letter of repatriation.\n\nIn September 2004, [[Hurricane Frances]] swept through the Bahamas, leaving widespread damage in its wake. Just three weeks later, Hurricane Jeanne uprooted trees, blew out windows, and sent seawater flooding through neighborhoods on the islands of [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]] and [[Grand Bahama]]. Receding floodwaters left boats tossed on roads and homes battered.\n\nThe College of the Bahamas was founded in 1974 and provided the nation's higher or tertiary education. The College was chartered in 2016 as the [[University of the Bahamas]], offering baccalaureate, masters and associate degrees, on three campuses and teaching and research centres throughout the Bahamas.\n\nBased on the twin pillars of tourism and offshore finance, the Bahamian economy has prospered since the 1950s. However, there remain significant challenges in areas such as education, health care, housing, international narcotics trafficking and illegal immigration from Haiti.\n\n==Political developments==\nModern political development began after World War II. The first political parties were formed in the 1950s. The [[Progressive Liberal Party]] was formed in 1953, and the [[United Bahamian Party]] was formed in 1956.\n\nBahamians achieved self-government in 1964, with [[Sir Roland Symonette]], of the United Bahamian Party, as the first Premier. The Bahamas achieved full independence as a [[Commonwealth realm]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on 10 July 1973. Sir [[Lynden O. Pindling]], leader of the Progressive Liberal Party,  became the first black Premier of the colony in 1967, and in 1968 the title was changed to [[Prime Minister of the Bahamas|Prime Minister]]. [[Sir Milo Butler]] was appointed the first [[Governor-General of the Bahamas]] (the official representative of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]) shortly after independence. Pindling was prime minister until 1992, during which the Bahamas benefited from tourism and foreign investment. He was succeeded by [[Hubert Ingraham]], leader of the [[Free National Movement]], who was prime minister until 2002.\n\n==See also==\n*[[British colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the British West Indies]]\n*[[History of North America]]\n*[[History of the Caribbean]]\n*[[List of Prime Ministers of the Bahamas]]\n*[[Politics of the Bahamas]]\n*[[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Albury, Paul.

The first inhabitants of the islands were the [[Lucayan people|Lucayans]], an [[Arawakan]]-speaking [[Ta\u00edno people|Taino]] people, who arrived between about 500 and 800 AD from other islands of the [[Caribbean]]. Their ancestors came from mainland South America, where Arawakan-language peoples were present in most territories, and especially along the northeastern coast.\n\nRecorded history began on 12 October 1492, when [[Christopher Columbus]] landed on the island of [[Guanahani]], which he renamed [[San Salvador Island]] on his first voyage to the [[New World]]. The earliest permanent European settlement was in 1648 on [[Eleuthera]]. During the 18th century [[slave trade]], many Africans were brought to the Bahamas as slaves to work for free. Their descendants now constitute 85% of the Bahamian population. The Bahamas gained independence from the [[United Kingdom]] on July 10, 1973.\n\n==Pre-history==\nSometime between 500 and 800 AD, Ta\u00ednos began crossing in [[dugout canoe]]s from [[Hispaniola]] and/or [[Cuba]] to the Bahamas. Suggested routes for the earliest migrations have been from Hispaniola to the [[Turks and Caicos Islands|Caicos Islands]], from Hispaniola or eastern Cuba to [[Great Inagua Island]], and from central Cuba to [[Long Island, Bahamas|Long Island]] (in the central Bahamas). William Keegan argues that the most likely route was from Hispaniola or Cuba to Great Inagua. Granberry and Vescelius argue for two migrations, from Hispaniola to the Turks and Caicos Islands, and from Cuba to Great Inagua.<ref>Craton:17<br>Granberry and Vescelius:80-86<br>Keegan:48-62</ref>\n\nFrom the initial colonization(s), the Lucayan expanded throughout the Bahamas in some 800 years (c. 700 \u2013 c. 1500), growing to a population of about 40,000. Population density at the time of first European contact was highest in the south-central area of the Bahamas, declining towards the north, reflecting the migration pattern and progressively shorter time of occupation of the northern islands. Known Lucayan settlement sites are confined to the nineteen largest islands in the archipelago, or to smaller cays located less than one km. from those islands. Population density in the southern-most Bahamas remained lower, probably due to the drier climate there (less than 800&nbsp;mm of rain a year on Great Inagua Island and the Turks and Caicos Islands and only slightly higher on Acklins and Crooked Islands and Mayaguana).<ref>Keegan:25, 54-8, 86, 170-3</ref>\n\nIn 1492 [[Christopher Columbus]] sailed from [[Spain]] on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|first voyage]] with three ships, the ''Ni\u00f1a,'' the ''Pinta,'' and the flagship, ''Santa Maria,'' seeking a direct route to [[Asia]]. On 12 October 1492 Columbus reached an island in the Bahamas and claimed it for Spain, an event long regarded by Europeans as the 'discovery' of America. This island was called ''[[Guanahani]]'' by the Lucayan, and San Salvador by the Spanish. The identity of the first American landfall by Columbus remains controversial, but many authors accept [[Samuel E. Morison]]'s identification of Columbus' San Salvador as what was later called Watling (or Watling's) Island. Its name has been officially changed to [[San Salvador Island|San Salvador]]. Columbus visited several other islands in the Bahamas before sailing to present-day Cuba and afterwards to Hispaniola.<ref>Albury:21-33<br>Craton:28-37<br>Keegan:175-205</ref>\n\nThe Bahamas held little interest to the Spanish except as a source of slave labor. Nearly the entire population of Lucayan (almost 40,000 people total) were transported to other islands as laborers over the next 30 years. When the Spanish decided to remove the remaining Lucayans to Hispaniola in 1520, they could find only eleven. The islands remained abandoned and depopulated for 130 years afterwards. With no gold to be found, and the population removed, the Spanish effectively abandoned the Bahamas. They retained titular claims to them until the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris in 1783]], when they ceded them to Britain in exchange for East Florida.<ref>Albury:34-7</ref><ref>Albury:34-7<br>Craton. pp. 37-39<br>Johnson:3<br>Keegan:212, 220-3</ref>\n\nWhen Europeans first landed on the islands, they reported the Bahamas were lushly forested. Cleared to develop the land for [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s, the forests have not regrown and have not been replanted.\n\n==Early English settlement==\nFor many years, historians believed that The Bahamas was not colonized until the 17th century. However, recent studies show that there may have been attempts of colonization by groups from Spain, France, Britain, and the Netherlands. The French settled in Abaco in 1565, and tried again in 1625. In 1648 a group from [[Bermuda]] called 'The Company of Adventurers for the Plantation of the Islands of Eleutheria,' which was led by [[William Sayle]], sailed to the Bahamas to found a colony. These early settlers were [[Puritan]]s and [[Classical republicanism|republicans]]. Bermuda was becoming overcrowded, and the Bahamas offered both religious and political freedom and economic opportunity. The larger of the company's two ships, the ''William'', wrecked on the reef at the north end of what is now called [[Eleuthera Island]], with the loss of all provisions. Despite the arrival of additional settlers, including Europeans, slaves and former African slaves from Bermuda and the receipt of relief supplies from [[Virginia]] and [[New England]], the Eleuthera colony struggled for many years, hampered by poor soil, fighting between settlers, and conflict with the Spanish. In the mid-1650s many of the settlers returned to Bermuda. The remaining settlers founded communities on [[Harbour Island, Bahamas|Harbour Island]] and Saint George's Cay ([[Spanish Wells]]) at the north end of Eleuthera. In 1670 about 20 families lived in the Eleuthera communities.<ref>Albury:41-6<br>Johnson:3-4</ref>\n\nIn 1666 other colonists from Bermuda settled on [[New Providence]], which soon became the center of population and commerce in the Bahamas, with almost 500 people living on the island by 1670. Unlike the Eleutherians, who were primarily farmers, the first settlers on New Providence made their living from the sea, salvaging (mainly Spanish) wrecks, making salt, and taking fish, turtles, [[conch]]s and [[ambergris]]. Farmers from Bermuda soon followed the seamen to New Providence, where they found good, plentiful land. Neither the Eleutherian colony nor the settlement on New Providence had any legal standing under English law. In 1670 the Proprietors of Carolina were issued a patent for the Bahamas, but the governors sent by the Proprietors had difficulty imposing their authority on the independent-minded residents of New Providence.<ref>Albury:47-51<br>Johnson:4</ref>\n\nThe early settlers continued to live much as they had in Bermuda, fishing, hunting turtles, whales, and seals, finding [[ambergris]], making salt on the drier islands, cutting the abundant hardwoods of the islands for lumber, [[dyewood]] and medicinal bark; and [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|wrecking]], or salvaging wrecks. The Bahamas were close to the sailing routes between Europe and the Caribbean, so shipwrecks in the islands were common, and wrecking was the most lucrative occupation available to the Bahamians.<ref>Johnson:4-5</ref>\n\n==Wreckers, privateers and pirates==\nThe Bahamians soon came into conflict with the Spanish over the salvaging of wrecks. The Bahamian wreckers drove the Spanish away from their wrecked ships, and attacked Spanish salvagers, seizing goods the Spanish had already recovered from the wrecks. When the Spanish raided the Bahamas, the Bahamians in turn commissioned [[privateer]]s against Spain, even though England and Spain were at peace. In 1684 the Spanish [[Raid on Charles Town|burned the settlements]] on New Providence and Eleuthera, after which they were largely abandoned. New Providence was settled a second time in 1686 by colonists from [[Jamaica]].\n\nIn the 1690s English privateers (England was then at war with [[France]]) made a base in the Bahamas. In 1696 [[Henry Every]] (or Avery), using the assumed name Henry Bridgeman, brought his ship [[Fancy (ship)|''Fancy'']], loaded with pirates' loot, into Nassau harbor. Every bribed the governor, Nicholas Trott (uncle of the [[Nicholas Trott]] who presided at the trial of [[Stede Bonnet]]), with gold and silver, and by leaving him the ''Fancy'', still loaded with 50 tons of [[elephant#Tusks|elephant tusks]] and 100 barrels of gunpowder. Following peace with France in 1697, many of the privateers became [[pirates]]. From this time the pirates increasingly made Nassau, the Bahamian capital founded in 1694, their base. The governors appointed by the Proprietors usually made a show of suppressing the pirates, but most were accused of dealing with them. By 1701 England was at war with France and Spain. In 1703 and in 1706 combined French-Spanish fleets [[Raid on Nassau|attacked and sacked]] Nassau, after which some settlers left, and the Proprietors gave up on trying to govern the islands.<ref>Albury:51-5<br>Craton:70-87<br>Johnson:6<br>Woodard:12-14, 23-24</ref>\n\nWith no functioning government in the Bahamas, English privateers operated from Nassau as their base, in what has been called a \"[[Pirates' republic|privateers' republic]],\" which lasted for eleven years. The raiders attacked French and Spanish ships, while French and Spanish forces burned Nassau several times. The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] ended in 1714, but some privateers were slow to get the news, or reluctant to accept it, and slipped into piracy. One estimate puts at least 1,000 pirates in the Bahamas in 1713, outnumbering the 200 families of more permanent settlers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Albury:58-68<br>Craton:89-90<br>Woodard:89-90, 140, 160</ref>\n\nThe \"privateers' republic\" in Nassau became a \"pirates' republic\". At least 20 pirate captains used Nassau or other places in the Bahamas as a home port during this period, including [[Henry Jennings]], [[Edward Teach]] (Blackbeard), [[Benjamin Hornigold]] and [[Stede Bonnet]]. Many settler families moved from New Providence to Eleuthera or [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]] to escape harassment from the pirates. On the other hand, residents of Harbor Island were happy to serve as middlemen for the pirates, as merchants from [[New England]] and Virginia came there to exchange needed supplies for pirate plunder.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> As mentioned above, the activities of pirates provoked frequent and brutal retaliatory attacks by the French and Spanish.\n\n==Reclaiming Bahamas for the Crown ==\nStarting in 1713, [[Woodes Rogers]] had conceived the idea of leading an expedition to [[Madagascar]] to suppress the pirates there and establish it as a British colony. Rogers' friends [[Richard Steele]] and [[Joseph Addison]] eventually convinced him to tackle the pirates nest in the Bahamas, instead. Rogers and others formed a company to fund the venture. They persuaded the Proprietors of Carolina to surrender the government of the Bahamas to the king, while retaining title to the land. In 1717 [[George I of Great Britain|King George]] appointed Rogers governor of the Bahamas and issued a proclamation granting a pardon to any pirate who surrendered to a British governor within one year.<ref>Albury:69-74<br>Craton:93-6<br>Johnson:7-8<br>Woodard:117-121, 163-168</ref>\n\nWord of the appointment of a new governor and of the offer of pardons reached Nassau ahead of Rogers and his forces. Some of the pirates were willing to accept a pardon and retire from piracy. [[Henry Jennings]] and Christopher Winter, sailed off to find British authorities to confirm their acceptance of the amnesty.\n\nOthers were not ready to give up. Many of those were [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], supporters of the [[House of Stuart]], who identified as enemies of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] King George. Still others simply identified as rebels, or thought they were better off as pirates than trying to earn an honest living. When a Royal Navy ship brought official word to Nassau of the pardon offer, many pirates planned to accept. Soon, however, the recalcitrant parties gained the upper hand, eventually forcing the Navy ship to leave.<ref>Woodard:226-29</ref>\n\n[[Blackbeard]], [[Stede Bonnet]], [[Nicholas Brown (pirate)|Nicholas Brown]] and Edmond Condent left the Bahamas for other territories. [[Charles Vane]], with \"[[Calico Jack]]\" Rackham and [[Edward England]] in his crew, came to prominence at this time. Vane worked to organize resistance to the anticipated arrival of Royal authority, even appealing to [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], the Stuart [[pretender]], for aid in holding the Bahamas and capturing Bermuda for the Stuarts. As aid from the Stuarts failed to materialize and the date for Rogers' arrival approached, Vane and his crew prepared to leave Nassau.<ref>Woodard:236-40, 245-47, 259-61</ref>\n\nWoodes Rogers arrived in Nassau in late July 1718, with his own 460-ton warship, three ships belonging to his company, and an escort of three ships of the Royal Navy. Vane's ship was trapped in Nassau harbor. His crew set that ship on fire, sending it towards Rogers' ships, and escaped in the ensuing confusion in a smaller ship they had seized from another pirate. The remaining population welcomed Rogers; they comprised about 200 settlers and 500 to 700 pirates who wanted to receive pardons, most prominently [[Benjamin Hornigold]].<ref>Woodard:247-48, 262-67</ref> After the pirates' surrender, the Proprietors leased their land in the Bahamas to Rogers' company for 21 years.\n\nRogers controlled Nassau, but Charles Vane was loose and threatening to drive the governor and his forces out. Learning that the King of Spain wanted to expel English from the islands, Rogers worked to improve the defenses of Nassau. He lost nearly 100 men of the new forces due to an unidentified disease, and the Navy ships left for other assignments. Rogers sent four of his ships to Havana to assure the Spanish governor that he was suppressing piracy and to trade for supplies. The crews of ex-pirates and men who had come with Rogers all turned to piracy. The ex-pirate Benjamin Hornigold later caught ten men at [[Green Turtle Cay]] as part of Rogers' suppression effort. Eight were found guilty and hanged in front of the fort.<ref>Woodard:268-72, 286, 301-04</ref>\n\nVane attacked several small settlements in the Bahamas but, after he refused to attack a stronger French frigate, he was deposed for cowardice and replaced as captain by \"[[Calico Jack]]\" Rackham. Vane never returned to the Bahamas; he was eventually caught, convicted and executed in Jamaica. After nearly being captured by Jamaican privateers, and hearing that the king had extended the deadline for pardons for piracy, Rackham and his crew returned to Nassau to surrender to Woodes Rogers.\n\nIn Nassau Rackham became involved with [[Anne Bonny]]; he tried to arrange an annulment of her marriage to another ex-pirate, James Bonny. Rogers blocked the annulment, and Rackham and Bonny left Nassau to be pirates again, taking a small crew and Bonny's friend [[Mary Read]] with them. Within months, Rackham, Bonny and Read were captured and taken to Jamaica. They were convicted of piracy, and Rackham was executed. Bonny and Read were sent to prison, as both were pregnant and therefore excluded from execution. Read died in prison, while Bonny's fate is unknown.<ref>Woodard:304-10, 315-20</ref>\n\nWhen Britain and Spain went to war again in 1719, many of the ex-pirates were commissioned by the British government as privateers. A Spanish invasion fleet set out for the Bahamas, but was diverted to [[Pensacola, Florida]] when it was seized by the French. Rogers continued to improve the defenses of Nassau, spending his personal fortune and going heavily into debt to do so. In 1720, the [[Raid on Nassau (1720)|Spaniards finally attacked Nassau]]. Rogers returned to Britain in 1722 to plead for repayment of the money he had borrowed to build up Nassau, only to find he had been replaced as governor. He was sent to debtors' prison, although his creditors later absolved his debts, gaining him release.\n\nAfter the publication in 1724 of ''A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pirates,'' which praised Rogers' efforts to suppress piracy in the Bahamas, his fortunes began to improve. The king awarded him a pension, retroactive to 1721. In 1728 Rogers was appointed Governor of the Bahamas for a second term. He dissolved the colony's assembly when it would not approve taxes to repair Nassau's defenses. He died in Nassau in 1732.<ref>Woodard:311-14, 325-28</ref>\n\n==Mid-century==\nIn 1741, Governor [[John Tinker (governor)|John Tinker]] and Peter Henry Bruce constructed [[Fort Montague]]. Additionally, the Governor also reported a privateering boom in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in North America. He also reported that over 2300 sumptuous houses were built. In 1768 Governor William Shirley filled in mosquito-breeding swamps and extended Nassau.\n\n==Loyalists, slaves and Black Seminoles==\nDuring the [[American War of Independence]] the Bahamas [[Capture of the Bahamas (1782)|fell to Spanish forces]] under [[Bernardo de Galvez|General Galvez]] in 1782. A British-American Loyalist expedition led by Colonel [[Andrew Deveaux]], [[Capture of the Bahamas (1783)|recaptured the islands]] in 1783. After the [[American Revolution]], the British issued land grants to [[American Loyalists]] who  had gone into exile from the newly established United  States. The sparse population of the Bahamas tripled within a few years. The Loyalists developed cotton as a commodity crop, but it dwindled from insect damage and soil exhaustion. In addition to slaves they brought with them, the planters' descendants imported more African slaves for labour.\n\nMost of the current inhabitants in the islands are descended from the slaves brought to work on the Loyalist plantations. In addition, thousands of captive Africans, who were liberated from foreign slave ships by the British navy after the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolition of the British slave trade in 1807]], were resettled as free persons in the Bahamas.\n\nIn the early 1820s, following the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] ceding Florida from Spain to the United States, hundreds of African slaves and [[Black Seminoles]] escaped from Florida, most settling on [[Andros Island]] in the Bahamas. Three hundred escaped in a mass flight in 1823.<ref name=\"nps\">[http://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/ntf_member/ntf_member_details.htm?SPFID=9173&SPFTerritory=Florida&SPFType=Site&SPFKeywords=Bill%20Baggs%20Cape%20Florida%20State%20Park \"Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park\"], ''Network to Freedom,'' National Park Service, 2010, accessed 10 April 2013.</ref> While the flow was reduced by federal construction of a lighthouse at [[Cape Florida Lighthouse|Cape Florida]] in 1825, slaves continued to find freedom in the Bahamas.<ref name=\"nps\"/>\n\nIn August 1834, the traditional plantation life ended with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|British emancipation of slaves throughout most of its colonies]]. [[Freedmen]] chose to work on their own small plots of land when possible.\n\n==Post-emancipation==\n{{Main|Bahamas and the American Civil War}}\nIn the 1830s and 1840s, tensions rose between Britain and the United States after American merchant ships, part of the coastwise slave trade, put into Nassau or were wrecked on its reefs. These included the ''[[Hermosa (slave ship)|Hermosa]]'' (1840) and the ''[[Creole case|Creole]]'' (1841), the latter brought in after a slave revolt on board. Britain had notified nations that slaves brought into Bahama and Bermuda waters would be forfeited and freed the slaves, refusing US efforts to recover them.<ref name=\"horne\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=XTLFKrmJPgcC&dq=%22children+of+the+enterprise%22+musson Gerald Horne, ''Negro Comrades of the Crown: African Americans and the British Empire Fight the U.S. Before Emancipation''], New York University (NYU) Press, 2012, pp. 107-108</ref> In 1853 Britain and the US signed a claims treaty and submitted to arbitration for claims dating to 1814; they paid each other in 1855.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], the Bahamas prospered as a base for Confederate blockade-running, bringing in cotton to be shipped to the mills of England and running out arms and munitions. None of these provided any lasting prosperity to the islands, nor did attempts to grow different kinds of crops for export.\n\nWith emancipation, Caribbean societies inherited a rigid racial stratification that was reinforced by the unequal distribution of wealth and power. The three-tier race structure, of whites, [[mixed-race]], and primarily blacks, who comprised the large majority, existed well into the 1940s and in some societies beyond. Like African Americans, many also have European and Native American ancestry. Caribbean societies continue to struggle with racial issues.\n\n==Late-colonial period==\nIn 1911, there was a short-lived movement to make the Bahamas part of [[Canada]]. Although the movement enjoyed the support of many in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] and from the head of [[Sun Life Financial|Sun Life]], a Canadian insurance company, the movement failed. The failure of the movement was, in part, due to the British government's opposition to uniting a predominantly Black colony with a predominantly white country.<ref>Smith, Andrew. 2009. \"Thomas Bassett Macaulay and the Bahamas: Racism, Business and Canadian Sub-imperialism\". The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History. 37, no. 1: 29-50.</ref>\n\n==The Bahamas at war==\nIn [[World War I]] organizations such as the Imperial Order of the Daughters of Empire and the Bahamas Red Cross Guild, began collecting money, food and clothing for soldiers and civilians in Europe. \"The Gallant Thirty\" Bahamians set out to join the British West Indies Regiment as early as 1915 and as many as 1,800 served in the armed forces of Canada, Britain and the United States.\n\n=== Riot===\n\nOakes Field, the Bahamas first airport, was opened in Nassau in January 1940. It was named after [[Harry Oakes]], a millionaire who made a large contribution to its creation.

Freeport, on the island of Grand Bahama, was established as a free trade zone in the 1950s and became the Bahama's second city. [[Bank secrecy]] combined with the lack of corporate and income taxes led to a rapid growth in the offshore financial sector during the postwar years.\n\nThe fourth [[James Bond films|James Bond film]], ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', was partly filmed in 1965 in Nassau.\n\nBy the early 1980s, the islands had become a major center for the drug trade, with 90% of all the [[cocaine]] entering the [[United States]] reportedly passing through the Bahamas. Diplomatic relations were established with [[Cuba]] in 1974. A decade later, as increased Cuban immigration to the islands strained the Bahamas\u2019 resources, Cuba refused to sign a letter of repatriation.\n\nIn September 2004, [[Hurricane Frances]] swept through the Bahamas, leaving widespread damage in its wake. Just three weeks later, Hurricane Jeanne uprooted trees, blew out windows, and sent seawater flooding through neighborhoods on the islands of [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]] and [[Grand Bahama]]. Receding floodwaters left boats tossed on roads and homes battered.\n\nThe College of the Bahamas was founded in 1974 and provided the nation's higher or tertiary education. The College was chartered in 2016 as the [[University of the Bahamas]], offering baccalaureate, masters and associate degrees, on three campuses and teaching and research centres throughout the Bahamas.\n\nBased on the twin pillars of tourism and offshore finance, the Bahamian economy has prospered since the 1950s. However, there remain significant challenges in areas such as education, health care, housing, international narcotics trafficking and illegal immigration from Haiti.\n\n==Political developments==\nModern political development began after World War II. The first political parties were formed in the 1950s. The [[Progressive Liberal Party]] was formed in 1953, and the [[United Bahamian Party]] was formed in 1956.\n\nBahamians achieved self-government in 1964, with [[Sir Roland Symonette]], of the United Bahamian Party, as the first Premier. The Bahamas achieved full independence as a [[Commonwealth realm]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on 10 July 1973. Sir [[Lynden O. Pindling]], leader of the Progressive Liberal Party,  became the first black Premier of the colony in 1967, and in 1968 the title was changed to [[Prime Minister of the Bahamas|Prime Minister]]. [[Sir Milo Butler]] was appointed the first [[Governor-General of the Bahamas]] (the official representative of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]) shortly after independence. Pindling was prime minister until 1992, during which the Bahamas benefited from tourism and foreign investment. He was succeeded by [[Hubert Ingraham]], leader of the [[Free National Movement]], who was prime minister until 2002.\n\n==See also==\n*[[British colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the British West Indies]]\n*[[History of North America]]\n*[[History of the Caribbean]]\n*[[List of Prime Ministers of the Bahamas]]\n*[[Politics of the Bahamas]]\n*[[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Albury, Paul.

For example, in the [[Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta]], the Buddha is depicted presenting a notion of the [http://www.buddhisma2z.com/content.php?id=530 \"three knowledges\" (''tevijja'')]&nbsp;\u2013 a term also used in the Vedic tradition to describe knowledge of the [[Veda]]s&nbsp;\u2013 as being not texts, but things that he had experienced.<ref>{{Harv|Gombrich|1997|pp=29\u201330}}</ref> The true \"three knowledges\" are said to be constituted by the process of achieving enlightenment, which is what the Buddha is said to have achieved in the three watches of the night of his enlightenment.<ref>\"The brahmin by caste alone, the teacher of the ''Veda'', is (jokingly) etymologized as the 'non-meditator' (''ajh\u0101yaka'').

Gombrich in Paul Williams, ed., \"Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious studies.\" Taylor and Francis 2006, page 120.</ref>\n\n====Karma====\n[[Karma]] ([[Sanskrit]]: \u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e from the root k\u1e5b, \"to do\") is a word meaning ''action'' or ''activity'' and often implies its subsequent '''results''' (also called karma-phala, \"the fruits of action\"). It is commonly understood as a term to denote the entire cycle of [[Causality|cause and effect]] as described in the philosophies of a number of cosmologies, including those of Buddhism and Hinduism.\n\nKarma is a central part of Buddhist teachings. In Buddha's teaching, karma is a direct intentional<ref>Kamma A Study Guide by Thanissaro Bhikkhu http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/kamma.html</ref> result of a person's word, thought and/or action in life. In Buddhism a person's words, thoughts and/or actions form the basis for good and bad karma: [[\u015a\u012bla|sila]] (moral conduct) goes hand in hand with the development of meditation and wisdom. Buddhist teachings carry a markedly different meaning from pre-Buddhist conceptions of karma.<ref>{{Harv|Gombrich|1997|p=37}}</ref>\n\n====Dharma====\n[[Dharma]] ([[Sanskrit]], [[Devanagari]]: \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e or [[P\u0101li]] '''Dhamma''', Devanagari: \u0927\u092e\u094d\u092e) means '''Natural Law''', '''Reality''' or '''Duty''', and with respect to its significance for [[spirituality]] and [[religion]] might be considered '''the Way of the Higher Truths'''. A Hindu appellation for [[Hinduism]] itself is ''[[San\u0101tana Dharma]]'', which translates as \"the eternal dharma.\" Similarly, [[Buddhadharma]] is an appellation for [[Buddhism]]. The general concept of dharma forms a basis for philosophies, beliefs and practices originating in [[India]]. The four main ones are [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] (Jaina Dharma), and [[Sikhism]] (Sikha Dharma), all of whom retain the centrality of dharma in their teachings. In these traditions, beings that live in harmony with dharma proceed more quickly toward, according to the tradition, [[Dharma Yukam]], [[Moksha]], or [[Nirvana]] (personal liberation). Dharma can refer generally to religious [[duty]], and also mean social order, right conduct, or simply virtue.\n\n====Buddha====\nThe term \"Buddha\" too has appeared in Hindu scriptures before the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]]. In the ''[[Vayu Purana]]'', [[Daksha|sage Daksha]] calls Lord Shiva as Buddha.<ref>\"''namah suddhaya buddhaya''\"; P. 67 ''Cultural History From The Vayu Purana'' By Devendrakumar Rajaram Patil, Rajaram D. K. Patil</ref>\n\n===Similar symbolism===\n* '''[[Mudra]]''': This is a symbolic hand-gesture expressing an emotion. Images of the Buddha almost always depict him performing some [[mudra]].\n* '''[[Dharma Chakra]]''': The [[Dharmacakra|Dharma Chakra]], which appears on the national flag of India and the flag of the Thai royal family, is a Buddhist symbol that is used by members of both religions.\n* '''[[Rudraksha]]''': These are [[prayer beads|beads]] that devotees, usually monks, use for praying.\n* '''[[Tilak]]''': Many Hindu devotees mark their heads with a [[tilak]], which is interpreted as a [[third eye]]. A similar mark is one of the characteristic [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]].\n* '''[[Swastika]]''' and '''[[Sauwastika]]''': both are sacred symbols. It can be either clockwise or counter-clockwise and both are seen in Hinduism and Buddhism. The Buddha is sometimes depicted with a sauwastika on his chest or the palms of his hands.<ref>[http://img.search.com/0/0f/300px-Buddha_image_-_stone_-_with_disciple.jpg Buddha image] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321133243/http://img.search.com/0/0f/300px-Buddha_image_-_stone_-_with_disciple.jpg |date=March 21, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Similar practices===\n\n====Mantra====\n[[File:Mantras caved into rock in Tibet.jpg|thumb|250px|In [[Tibet]], many [[Buddhist]]s carve mantras into rocks as a form of [[Buddhist devotion|devotion]].]]\nA '''[[mantra]]''' (\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930) is a [[religion|religious]] [[syllable]] or [[poem]], typically from the [[Sanskrit]] language. Their use varies according to the school and philosophy associated with the mantra. They are primarily used as [[spiritual conduit]]s, words or vibrations that instill one-pointed [[Attention|concentration]] in the devotee. Other purposes have included religious ceremonies to accumulate wealth, avoid danger, or eliminate enemies. Mantras existed in the [[historical Vedic religion]], [[Zoroastrianism]]<ref>http://tenets.parsizoroastrianism.com/IsthereanysenseinchantingAvestaprayers.pdf</ref> and the Shramanic traditions, and thus they remain important in Buddhism and [[Jainism]] as well as other faiths of Indian origin such as [[Sikhism]].\n\n====Yoga====\n{{further|Mindful yoga}}\n\nThe practice of [[Yoga]] is intimately connected to the religious beliefs and practices of both Hinduism and Buddhism.<ref>The Yoga Tradition: its literature, philosophy and practice By Georg Feuerstein. {{ISBN|81-208-1923-3}}. p. 111</ref> However, there are distinct variations in the usage of yoga terminology in the two religions.\n\nIn Hinduism, the term \"Yoga\" commonly refers to the eight limbs of yoga as defined in the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]], written some time after 100 BCE, and means \"yoke\", with the idea that one's individual [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|atman]], or soul, would yoke or bind with the monistic entity that underlies everything ([[brahman]]). Yoga in Hinduism also known as being 'complex', based on yoking (integrating). Yoga defines a specific process: it has an emphasis on knowledge and practice, as well as being known to be 'mature' and difficult.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stratton Hawley|first=John|title=Yoga and Viyoga: Simple Religion in Hinduism|journal=The Harvard Theological Review|date=January 1981|volume=74|pages=1\u201320|doi=10.1017/s0017816000028492}}<!--|accessdate=September 22, 2012--></ref> The most basic meaning of this Sanskrit term is with technique. The technique of the different forms of yoga is what makes the practice meaningful. Yoga is not an easy or simple practice, viyoga is what is described as simple.

Many Hindus tend to pick and choose between the five forms of yoga because of the way they live their life and how they want to practice it in the form they are most connected to.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stratton Hawley|first=John|title=Yoga and Viyoga: Simple Religion in Hinduism|journal=The Harvard Theological Review|date=January 1981|volume=74|series=no. 1|pages=1\u201320|doi=10.1017/s0017816000028492}}<!--|accessdate=September 22, 2012--></ref>\n\nIn the [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism of Tibet, however, the  term \"Yoga\" is simply used to refer to any type of spiritual practice; from the various types of tantra (like [[Kriyayoga]] or [[Charyayoga]]) to '[[Deity yoga]]' and '[[guru yoga]]'. In the early translation phase of the [[Sutrayana]] and [[Tantrayana]] from India, China and other regions to Tibet, along with the practice lineages of [[sadhana]], codified in the [[Nyingmapa]] canon, the most subtle 'conveyance' (Sanskrit: [[Yana (Buddhism)|yana]]) is [[Dzogchen|Adi Yoga]] (Sanskrit). A contemporary scholar with a focus on [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Robert Thurman]] writes that Patanjali was influenced by the success of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastic system to formulate his own matrix for the version of thought he considered orthodox.<ref>Robert Thurman, \"The Central Philosophy of Tibet.'' Princeton University Press, 1984, p. 34.</ref>\n\nThe yoga scholar [[Stephen Cope]] identifies the following similarities between [[Raja yoga]] and Buddhism. He notes that the two philosophies are not the same, but are strikingly similar, having shared a long period of interchange up to about 500 CE.<ref name=\"Cope 2006\">{{cite book | last=Cope | first=Stephen | authorlink=Stephen Cope | title=The wisdom of yoga : a seeker's guide to extraordinary living | url=https://archive.org/details/wisdomofyogaseek00cope | url-access=registration | publisher=Bantam Books | publication-place=New York | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-553-38054-5 | oclc=64098584 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/wisdomofyogaseek00cope/page/276 276-278]}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!

Many scholars have noted that the concepts of [[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]] and [[sam\u0101dhi]] - technical terms describing stages of meditative absorption&nbsp;\u2013 are common to meditative practices in both Hinduism and Buddhism. Most notable in this context is the relationship between the system of four Buddhist ''dhyana'' states ([[Pali]]: [[Jhana in Theravada|''jhana'']]) and the ''samprajnata samadhi'' states of Classical Yoga.<ref>Samadhi: The Numinous and Cessative in Indo-Tibetan Yoga By Stuart Ray Sarbacker. {{ISBN|0-7914-6553-5}}. p. 77</ref> Also, many (Tibetan) Vajrayana practices of the [[generation stage]] and [[completion stage]] work with the [[chakras]], inner energy channels ([[nadi (yoga)|nadis]]) and [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]], called [[tummo]] in Tibetan.\n\n==Differences==\nDespite the similarities in terminology there exist differences between the two religions. There is no evidence to show that Buddhism ever subscribed to vedic sacrifices, vedic deities or caste.<ref>Y. Masih (2000) In : A Comparative Study of Religions, Motilal Banarsidass Publ : Delhi, {{ISBN|81-208-0815-0}} Page 18.</ref>\n\nThe major differences are mentioned below.\n\n===God===\n[[Gautama Buddha]] was very ambiguous about the existence of a Creator Deity ([[Brahman]]) and Eternal Self ([[\u0100tman (Buddhism)|Atman]]) and rejected them both. Various sources from the Pali Canon and others suggest that the Buddha taught that belief in a Creator deity was not essential to attaining liberation from suffering, and perhaps chose to ignore theological questions because they were \"fascinating to discuss,\" and frequently brought about more conflict and anger than peace.  The Buddha did not deny the existence of the  popular gods of the Vedic pantheon, but rather argued that these [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s, who may be in a more exalted state than humans, are still nevertheless trapped in the same samsaric cycle of suffering as other beings and are not necessarily worthy of veneration and worship. The focus of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], while inheriting many practices and ideologies from the previous Hindu yogic tradition, deviates from the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita and earlier works of the [[Dharmic Religions]] in that liberation ([[Nirvana]] or [[Moksha]]) is not attained via unity with Brahman (the Godhead), Self-realization or worship. Rather, the Buddha's teaching centers around what [[Eknath Easwaran]] described as a \"psychology of desire,\" that is attaining liberation from suffering by extermination of self-will, selfish desire and passions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Easwaran |first=Eknath |authorlink=Eknath Easwaran |title=The Dhammapada: (Classics of Indian Spirituality) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8czJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA227 |year=2007 |publisher=Nilgiri Press |isbn=978-1-58638-020-5 |page=227}}</ref> This is not to say that such teachings are absent from the previous Hindu tradition, rather they are singled out and separated from Vedic Theology.\n\nAccording to [[Buddhology|Buddhologist]] [[Richard Hayes (professor)|Richard Hayes]], the early Buddhist [[Nikaya]] literature treats the question of the existence of a creator god \"primarily from either an epistemological point of view or a moral point of view\". In these texts the [[Buddha]] is portrayed not as a creator-denying atheist who claims to be able to prove such a God's nonexistence, but rather his focus is other teachers' claims that their teachings lead to the highest good.<ref>Hayes, Richard P., [http://www.unm.edu/~rhayes/atheism.pdf \"Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition\"], ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar) pgs 5-6, 8</ref>\n\nCiting the ''Devadaha Sutta'' (Majjhima Nikaya 101), Hayes states, \"while the reader is left to conclude that it is attachment rather than God, actions in past lives, fate, type of birth or efforts in this life that is responsible for our experiences of sorrow, no systematic argument is given in an attempt to disprove the existence of God.\"<ref>Hayes, Richard P., \"Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition\", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar) pgs 9-10</ref>\n\nThe Buddha (as portrayed in the Pali scriptures, the [[\u0100gama (Buddhism)|agamas]]) set an important trend in [[Nontheistic#Nontheism in Buddhism|nontheism in Buddhism]] by establishing a somewhat non-theistic view on the notion of an omnipotent God, generally ignoring the issue as being irrelevant to his teachings.<ref name=\"gunasekara\">{{cite web|title=The Buddhist Attitude to God |work=Statement made to a Multi-religious Seminar |author=Dr V.

Hinduism though proposes detachment from fruits of action<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/3/verse/19|title=Chapter 3, Verse 19 \u2013 Bhagavad Gita, The Song of God \u2013 Swami Mukundananda|last=Mukundananda|first=Swami|access-date=2016-08-17}}</ref> and stresses on performance of duty or ''dharma'', it is not solely focused on it. In Hinduism, Lord Shiva explains 'death' to be journey of the immortal soul in pursuit of 'Moksha' and therefore a fact of life.\n# While Buddhism says retirement into forest was open to everyone regardless of caste, and although according to the vinaya (the code of conduct for the Sangha) it is not possible to take ordination as a Buddhist mendicant (a Bhikkhu or Bhikkhuni) under the age of 20 or adulthood, this is still viewed as escapism by Hinduism. Pre-Buddhist, non-brahman forest mendicants are criticised in the earliest group of Upanishads. Hinduism allows for this to happen only after performing all ''dharmas'' or duties of one's life, starting from studying scriptures, working to support children and family and taking care of aged parents and lastly after all the dharma done retire to the forest and slowly meditate, fast and perform rituals and austerities (tapas), until physical disintegration & to reach the ultimate truth or ''Brahman''. Buddhism by contrast emphasises realisation by the middle way (avoiding extremes of luxury or austerities), seeing limited value in the rituals and tapas and the danger of their mis-application.\n# Buddhism explained that attachment is the cause of sorrow in society. Therefore, Buddhism's cure for sorrow was detachment and non-involvement (non-action or negative action). Hinduism on the other hand explained that both sorrow or happiness is due to 'Karma' or past actions and bad karma can be overcome and good karma can be obtained by following dharma or righteous duty (pro-action or positive action) which will ultimately provide 'Moksha' i.e. overcoming the cycle of life and joining ''Brahman''.\n\nBuddhist canonical views about God and the priests are:\n\n{{quote|13. Well then, Vasettha, those ancient sages versed in ancient scriptures, the authors of the verses, the utterers of the verses, whose, ancient form of words so chanted, uttered, or composed, the priests of today chant over again or repeat; intoning or reciting exactly as has been intoned or recited-to wit, Atthaka, Vamaka, Vamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bharadvaja, Vasettha, Kassapa, and Bhagu [11]&nbsp;\u2013 did even they speak thus, saying: \"We know it, we have seen it\", where the creator is whence the creator is?}}\n\nScholar-monk [[Walpola Rahula]] writes that man depends on God \"for his own protection, safety, and security, just as a child depends on his parent.\" He describes this as a product of \"ignorance, weakness, fear, and desire,\" and writes that this \"deeply and fanatically held belief\" for man's consolation is \"false and empty\" from the perspective of Buddhism. He writes that man does not wish to hear or understand teachings against this belief, and that the Buddha described his teachings as \"against the current\" for this reason.<ref>Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught,'' pp. 51\u201352.</ref> He also wrote that for self-protection man created God and for self-preservation man created \"soul\".<ref>''What the Buddha Taught,'' pp.&nbsp;51\u201352.</ref>\n\nIn later Mahayana literature, however, the idea of an eternal, all-pervading, all-knowing, immaculate, uncreated and deathless Ground of Being (the dharmadhatu, inherently linked to the sattvadhatu, the realm of beings), which is the Awakened Mind (bodhicitta) or Dharmakaya (\"body of Truth\") of the Buddha himself, is attributed to the Buddha in a number of Mahayana sutras, and is found in various tantras as well. In some Mahayana texts, such a principle is occasionally presented as manifesting in a more personalised form as a primordial buddha, such as Samantabhadra, Vajradhara, Vairochana, Amitabha and Adi-Buddha, among others.\n\n===Rites and rituals===\nIn later tradition such as [[Mahayana Buddhism]] in Japan, the [[Shingon]] Fire Ritual (Homa /Yagna) and Urabon (Sanskrit: Ullambana) derives from Hindu traditions.<ref>R.K. Payne: The Tantric Ritual of Japan. Feeding the Gods: the Shingon Fire Ritual., and Koenraad Elst: Who is a Hindu? 2001</ref> Similar rituals are common in Tibetan Buddhism. Both Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism share common rites, such as the purification rite of Homa (Havan, Yagna in Sanskrit), prayers for the ancestors and deceased (Ullambana in Sanskrit, Urabon in Japanese).\n\n===Caste===\nThe Buddha repudiated the caste distinctions of the Brahmanical religion,<ref name=\"ccbs.ntu.edu.tw\">K.N.

They will even get into trouble from their own deeds, whatever their caste (Brahmin, Khattiya, Vessa, and Sudda) might be.<ref>{{cite book|title = The Long Discourses of the Buddha|first = Maurice|last = Walshe|page = 216|publisher = Wisdom Publications Inc|year = 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe superiority of Brahmanas were pretty clearly laid out in Buddhist scripture. In Madhura Sutta of the [[Majjhima Nikaya|Majjhimanikdya]] (II 4.4) and in the Assalayana Sutta of [[Majjhima Nikaya|Majjhima]] (II 5.3), the brahamanas claim to be of superior caste (\"''brdhmano seftho venno\"'') and the rest are of inferior caste (\"''hino anno vanno\"''), the brahmanas claim to have fair complexion (\"''sukko vanno\"''), while others are dark (\"''kanho''\"); the brahamanas are pure (\"''sujjhanti\"''), while non-brahamarws are not.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Krishan|first=Y.|date=1998|title=Buddhism and Caste System|journal=East and West|volume=48|issue=1/2|pages=41\u201355|issn=0012-8376|jstor=29757366}}</ref> Occupational mobility across caste divisions was frowned upon as indicated in Osukdri Sutta of the [[Majjhima Nikaya|Majjhima]] (II 5.6).<ref name=\":0\" /> In [[Jataka tales|Jataka]] like ''Setdketu Jataka, Matanga Jataka, Citta Sambhutta Jataka,'' there is evidence that the touch or sight of the pancamas was believed to cause pollution.\n\nThe Buddha himself didn't repudiate or condemn the caste system. In ''Citta Sambhutta Jataka'', describes the ''chandalas'' to be the lowest race and the meanest of men, and their origins traced to karma. Buddha in Ambaitha Sutta of [[Dighanikaya|Dighanikdya]] III says, \"''khattiyo va setfha hino brahmano''\" (he ksatriya is superior, brahmana inferior ) by the purity of their blood. Buddhist scriptures recognised caste distinctions in the present life as the product of a man's past karmas and not an accident of birth.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Cosmology and worldview===\n{{Main|Buddhist Cosmology}}\n\nIn [[Buddhist cosmology]], there are 31 planes of existence within samsara.<ref name=\"books.google.co.in\">Jacob N. Kinnard, ''The Emergence of Buddhism: Classical Traditions in Contemporary Perspective'',  Fortress [https://books.google.com/books?id=xIzyZ7Nvs7cC&pg=PA14&dq=buddhist+cosmology+31+realms&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gDMJUIvZCfGviQe84unrCQ&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=buddhist%20cosmology%2031%20realms&f=false], Page 14</ref> Beings in these realms are subject to rebirth after some period of time, except for realms of the Non-Returners. Therefore, most of these places are not the goal of the holy life in the Buddha's dispensation. Buddhas are beyond all these 31 planes of existence after parinibbana. Hindu texts mostly mentions the devas in Kamma Loka. Only the Hindu god Brahma can be found in the Rupa loka. There are many realms above Brahma realm that are accessible through meditation. Those in Brahma realm are also subject to rebirth according to the Buddha.\n\n===Practices===\n\nTo have an idea of the differences between Buddhism and pre-existing beliefs and practices during this time, we can look into the [[Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta]] in the [[Digha Nikaya]] of the [[Pali Canon]]. In this sutra, a king of Magadha listed the teachings from many prominent and famous spiritual teachers around during that time. He also asked the [[Buddha]] about his teaching when visiting him. The Buddha told the king about the practices of his spiritual path.  The list of various practices he taught disciples as well as practices he doesn't encourage are listed. The text, rather than stating what the new faith was, emphasized what the new faith was not.  Contemporaneous religious traditions were caricatured and then negated. Though critical of prevailing religious practices and social institutions on philosophical grounds, early Buddhist texts exhibit a reactionary anxiety at having to compete in religiously plural societies. Below are a few examples found in the sutra:\n\n{{quote|Whereas some priests and contemplatives... are addicted to high and luxurious furnishings such as these&nbsp;\u2014 over-sized couches, couches adorned with carved animals, long-haired coverlets, multi-colored patchwork coverlets, white woolen coverlets, woolen coverlets embroidered with flowers or animal figures, stuffed quilts, coverlets with fringe, silk coverlets embroidered with gems;

Could that be the path to Awakening?\" Then following on that memory came the realization: \"That is the path to Awakening.\"|<ref name=\"Nanamoli, Bhikkhu 1995\"/>}}\n\nAccording to the Upakkilesa Sutta, after figuring out the cause of the various obstacles and overcoming them, the Buddha was able to penetrate the sign and enters 1st- 4th Jhana.\n\n{{quote|I also saw both the light and the vision of forms. Shortly after the vision of light and shapes disappear. I thought, \"What is the cause and condition in which light and vision of the forms disappear?\u201d\n\nThen consider the following: \"The question arose in me and because of doubt my concentration fell, when my concentration fell, the light disappeared and the vision of forms. I act so that the question does not arise in me again.\u201d\n\nI remained diligent, ardent, perceived both the light and the vision of forms. Shortly after the vision of light and shapes disappear. I thought, \"What is the cause and condition in which light and vision of the forms disappear?\u201d\n\nThen consider the following: \u201cInattention arose in me because of inattention and my concentration has decreased, when my concentration fell, the light disappeared and the vision of forms. I must act in such a way that neither doubt nor disregard arise in me again.\u201d}}\n\nIn the same way as above, the Buddha encountered many more obstacles that caused the light to disappear  and found his way out of them. These include sloth and torpor, fear, elation, inertia, excessive energy, energy deficient, desire, perception of diversity, and excessive meditation on the ways. Finally, he was able to penetrate the light and entered jhana.\n\nThe following descriptions in the Upakkilesa Sutta further show how he find his way into the first four Jhanas, which he later considered [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|''samma samadhi'']].\n\n{{quote|When Anuruddha, I realized that doubt is an imperfection of the mind, I dropped out of doubt, an imperfection of the mind.

The Buddha said in the Ariyapariyesana Sutta:\n\n{{quote|But the thought occurred to me, \"This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to Awakening, nor to Unbinding, but only to reappearance in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.\" So, dissatisfied with that Dhamma, I left.|<ref name=\"Nanamoli, Bhikkhu 1995\">Nanamoli, Bhikkhu (trans.)

This is sometimes called the \"ninth ''jh\u0101na''\" in commentarial and scholarly literature.<ref name=\"Steven Sutcliffe 2004, page 135\"/><ref>Chandima Wijebandara, ''Early Buddhism, Its Religious and Intellectual Milieu.'' Postgraduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies, University of Kelaniya, 1993, page 22.</ref>\nAlthough the \"Dimension of Nothingness\" and the \"Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception\" are included in the list of nine Jhanas taught by the Buddha, they are not included in the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. Noble Path number eight is \"Samma Samadhi\" (Right Concentration), and only the first four Jhanas are considered \"Right Concentration\". If he takes a disciple through all the Jhanas, the emphasis is on the \"Cessation of Feelings and Perceptions\" rather than stopping short at the \"Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception\".\n\nIn the Magga-vibhanga Sutta, the Buddha defines Right Concentration that belongs to the concentration (samadhi)  division of the path as the first four Jhanas:\n\n{{quote|And what is right concentration? There is the case where a monk&nbsp;\u2014 quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful (mental) qualities&nbsp;\u2014 enters & remains in the first Jhana: rapture & pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, he enters & remains in the Second Jhana: rapture & pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought & evaluation&nbsp;\u2014 internal assurance. With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the Third Jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous & mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure & pain&nbsp;\u2014 as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress&nbsp;\u2014 he enters & remains in the Fourth Jhana: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain.

He then underwent harsh ascetic practices that he eventually also became disillusioned with. He subsequently remembered entering ''jh\u0101na'' as a child, and realized that, \"That indeed is the path to enlightenment.\"\n\nIn the ''suttas'', the immaterial attainments are never referred to as ''jh\u0101nas''. The immaterial attainments have more to do with expanding, while the Jhanas (1-4) focus on  concentration. A common translation for the term \"samadhi\" is concentration. Rhys Davids and Maurice Walshe agreed that the term \u201d samadhi\u201d is not found in any pre-buddhist text. Hindu texts later used that term to indicate the state of enlightenment. This is not  in conformity with Buddhist usage. In ''The Long Discourse of the Buddha: A Translation of the Digha Nikaya'' (pg. 1700) Maurice Walshe wrote,\n\n{{quote|Rhys Davids also states that the term samadhi is not found in any pre-Buddhist text.

Routledge, 2007, p. 73.</ref>\n\nReligious knowledge or \"vision\" was indicated as a result of practice both within and outside the Buddhist fold. According to the ''[[Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta]]'' this sort of vision arose for the Buddhist adept as a result of the perfection of 'meditation' (Sanskrit: [[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|dhy\u0101na]]) coupled with the perfection of 'ethics' (Sanskrit: [[\u015b\u012bla]]). Some of the Buddha's meditative techniques were shared with other traditions of his day, but the idea that ethics are causally related to the attainment of \"religious insight\" (Sanskrit: [[Wisdom in Buddhism|praj\u00f1\u0101]]) was original.<ref name=\"westernbuddhistreview.com\">Dharmacarini Manishini, ''Western Buddhist Review.''

Pp. 72-78. {{ISBN|81-307-0092-1}}.</ref> Buddhist scriptures depict such conversions in the form of lay followers declaring their support for the Buddha and his teachings, or via ordination as a Buddhist monk. Buddhist identity has been broadly defined as one who \"[[Refuge (Buddhism)|takes Refuge]]\" in the [[Three Jewels]]: Buddha, Dharma, and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], echoing a formula seen in Buddhist texts. In some communities, formal conversion rituals are observed. No specific ethnicity has typically been associated with Buddhism, and as it spread beyond its origin in India immigrant monastics were replaced with newly ordained members of the local ethnic or tribal group.<ref>Hunter, W. W. ''The Indian Empire: Its People, History, and Products''. Routledge, 2000. P. 149. {{ISBN|0-415-24495-1}}.</ref>\n\n===Soteriology===\nUpanishadic soteriology is focused on the static Self, while the Buddha's is focused on dynamic agency. In the former paradigm, change and movement are an illusion; to realize the Self as the only reality is to realize something that has always been the case. In the Buddha's system by contrast, one has to make things happen.<ref>Richard Gombrich, ''How Buddhism began: the Conditioned Genesis of the Early Teachings.'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 1996, p. 58.</ref>\n\nThe fire metaphor used in the [[Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta]] (which is also used elsewhere) is a radical way of making the point that the liberated sage is beyond phenomenal experience. It also makes the additional point that this indefinable, transcendent state is the sage's state even during life. This idea goes against the early Brahminic notion of liberation at death.<ref>Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, p. 96.</ref>\n\nLiberation for the Brahminic yogin was thought to be the permanent realization at death of a [[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|nondual meditative state]] anticipated in life. In fact, old Brahminic metaphors for the liberation at death of the yogic adept (\"becoming cool\", \"going out\") were given a new meaning by the Buddha; their point of reference became the sage who is liberated in life.<ref name=\"Alexander Wynne 2007, page 109\">Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, page 109.</ref> The Buddha taught that these meditative states alone do not offer a decisive and permanent end to suffering either during life or after death.<ref>Michael Carrithers, ''The Buddha,'' 1983, page 36. Found in ''Founders of Faith,'' Oxford University Press, 1986.</ref>\n\nHe stated that achieving a formless attainment with no further practice would only lead to temporary rebirth in a formless realm after death.<ref>Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, p. 21.</ref> Moreover, he gave a pragmatic refutation of early Brahminical theories according to which the meditator, the meditative state, and the proposed uncaused, unborn, unanalyzable Self, are identical.<ref name=\"Michael Carrithers 1983, pp. 41\u201342\">Michael Carrithers, ''The Buddha,'' 1983, pp. 41\u201342. Found in ''Founders of Faith,'' Oxford University Press, 1986.</ref> These theories are undergirded by the Upanishadic correspondence between macrocosm and microcosm, from which perspective it is not surprising that meditative states of consciousness were thought to be identical to the subtle strata of the cosmos.<ref>Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, p. 42.</ref> The Buddha, in contrast, argued that states of consciousness come about caused and conditioned by the yogi's training and techniques, and therefore no state of consciousness could be this eternal Self.<ref name=\"Michael Carrithers 1983, pp. 41\u201342\"/>\n\n====Nonduality====\nBoth the Buddha's conception of the liberated person and the goal of early Brahminic yoga can be characterized as nondual, but in different ways. The nondual goal in early [[Brahminism]] was conceived in [[ontology|ontological]] terms; the goal was that into which one merges after death. According to Wynne, liberation for the Buddha \"... is nondual in another, more radical, sense. This is made clear in the dialogue with Upasiva, where the liberated sage is defined as someone who has passed beyond conceptual dualities. Concepts that might have some meaning in ordinary discourse, such as consciousness or the lack of it, existence and non-existence, etc., do not apply to the sage. For the Buddha, propositions are not applicable to the liberated person, because language and concepts ([[Sutta Nipata|Sn]] 1076: ''vaadapathaa'', ''dhammaa''), as well as any sort of intellectual reckoning (''sankhaa'') do not apply to the liberated sage.<ref>Alexander Wynne 2007, page 109</ref>\n\n====Nirvana====\n''[[Nirvana]]'' (or Nibbana in Pali language) means literally 'blowing out' or 'quenching'. The term is  pre-Buddhist, but its etymology is not essentially conclusive for finding out its exact meaning as the highest goal of early Buddhism.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HP9O6OM4iOgC&pg=PA9&dq=its+etymology+is+not+necessarily+conclusive+for+determining+its+exact+meaning&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwieiuO9yMrWAhWBLI8KHV4PAM8Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=its%20etymology%20is%20not%20necessarily%20conclusive%20for%20determining%20its%20exact%20meaning&f=false Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy], Edward Craig, 1.

A specific example might be that nirvana is 'amrta', or the deathlessness, but it is important that this refers to the nectar that confers immortality upon gods.

Brahmins who appear in the Tevijja-suttanta of the [[Digha Nikaya]] regard \"union with Brahm\u0101\" as liberation, and earnestly seek it. In that text, Brahmins of the time are reported to assert: \"Truly every Brahmin versed in the three Vedas has said thus: 'We shall expound the path for the sake of union with that which we do not know and do not see. This is the correct path. This path is the truth, and leads to liberation. If one practices it, he shall be able to enter into association with Brahm\u0101.\" The early Upanishads frequently expound \"association with Brahm\u0101\", and \"that which we do not know and do not see\" matches exactly with the early Upanishadic Brahman.<ref>Hajime Nakamura, ''A History of Early Ved\u0101nta Philosophy: Part One.''

Possibly the most famous Upanishadic dictum is ''[[tat tvam asi]]'', \"thou art that.\" Transposed into first person, the [[Pali]] version is ''eso \u2018ham asmi'', \"I am this.\" This is said in several suttas to be false. The full statement declared to be incorrect is \"This is mine, I am this, this is my self/essence.\" This is often rejected as a wrong view.<ref>Richard Francis Gombrich, How Buddhism began: the conditioned genesis of the early teachings Continuum International Publishing Group, 1996, page 38.</ref> The Alagaduppama Sutta rejects this and other obvious echoes of surviving Upanishadic statements as well (these are not mentioned as such in the commentaries, and seem not to have been noticed until modern times). Moreover, the passage denies that one\u2019s self is the same as the world and that one will become the world self at death.<ref name=\"Richard Francis Gombrich 1996, page 39\">Richard Francis Gombrich, How Buddhism began: the conditioned genesis of the early teachings Continuum International Publishing Group, 1996, p. 39.</ref> The Buddha tells the monks that people worry about something that is non-existent externally ([https://notesfrommylibrary.com/2011/04/15/denial-of-the-atman-%E2%80%93-the-alagaddupama-sutta/ ''bahiddhaa asati'')] and non-existent internally (''ajjhattam asati''); he is referring respectively to the soul/essence of the world and of the individual.<ref name=\"Richard Francis Gombrich 1996, page 39\"/> A similar rejection of \"internal\" Self and \"external\" Self occurs at AN II 212.

In that regard, the chapter on Brahmins in the Dhammapada may be regarded as being entirely in tune with the definition of a Brahmin in Chapter 18 of the Bhagavad Gita. Both say that a Brahmin is a person having certain qualities.\n\nA defining of feature of the Buddha's teachings is self-sufficiency, so much so as to render the Brahminical priesthood entirely redundant.<ref>Sue Hamilton, ''Early Buddhism: A New Approach: The I of the Beholder.''

K. Patil</ref>\n\n===Similar symbolism===\n* '''[[Mudra]]''': This is a symbolic hand-gesture expressing an emotion. Images of the Buddha almost always depict him performing some [[mudra]].\n* '''[[Dharma Chakra]]''': The [[Dharmacakra|Dharma Chakra]], which appears on the national flag of India and the flag of the Thai royal family, is a Buddhist symbol that is used by members of both religions.\n* '''[[Rudraksha]]''': These are [[prayer beads|beads]] that devotees, usually monks, use for praying.\n* '''[[Tilak]]''': Many Hindu devotees mark their heads with a [[tilak]], which is interpreted as a [[third eye]]. A similar mark is one of the characteristic [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]].\n* '''[[Swastika]]''' and '''[[Sauwastika]]''': both are sacred symbols. It can be either clockwise or counter-clockwise and both are seen in Hinduism and Buddhism. The Buddha is sometimes depicted with a sauwastika on his chest or the palms of his hands.<ref>[http://img.search.com/0/0f/300px-Buddha_image_-_stone_-_with_disciple.jpg Buddha image] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321133243/http://img.search.com/0/0f/300px-Buddha_image_-_stone_-_with_disciple.jpg |date=March 21, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Similar practices===\n\n====Mantra====\n[[File:Mantras caved into rock in Tibet.jpg|thumb|250px|In [[Tibet]], many [[Buddhist]]s carve mantras into rocks as a form of [[Buddhist devotion|devotion]].]]\nA '''[[mantra]]''' (\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930) is a [[religion|religious]] [[syllable]] or [[poem]], typically from the [[Sanskrit]] language. Their use varies according to the school and philosophy associated with the mantra. They are primarily used as [[spiritual conduit]]s, words or vibrations that instill one-pointed [[Attention|concentration]] in the devotee. Other purposes have included religious ceremonies to accumulate wealth, avoid danger, or eliminate enemies. Mantras existed in the [[historical Vedic religion]], [[Zoroastrianism]]<ref>http://tenets.parsizoroastrianism.com/IsthereanysenseinchantingAvestaprayers.pdf</ref> and the Shramanic traditions, and thus they remain important in Buddhism and [[Jainism]] as well as other faiths of Indian origin such as [[Sikhism]].\n\n====Yoga====\n{{further|Mindful yoga}}\n\nThe practice of [[Yoga]] is intimately connected to the religious beliefs and practices of both Hinduism and Buddhism.<ref>The Yoga Tradition: its literature, philosophy and practice By Georg Feuerstein. {{ISBN|81-208-1923-3}}. p. 111</ref> However, there are distinct variations in the usage of yoga terminology in the two religions.\n\nIn Hinduism, the term \"Yoga\" commonly refers to the eight limbs of yoga as defined in the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]], written some time after 100 BCE, and means \"yoke\", with the idea that one's individual [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|atman]], or soul, would yoke or bind with the monistic entity that underlies everything ([[brahman]]). Yoga in Hinduism also known as being 'complex', based on yoking (integrating). Yoga defines a specific process: it has an emphasis on knowledge and practice, as well as being known to be 'mature' and difficult.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stratton Hawley|first=John|title=Yoga and Viyoga: Simple Religion in Hinduism|journal=The Harvard Theological Review|date=January 1981|volume=74|pages=1\u201320|doi=10.1017/s0017816000028492}}<!--|accessdate=September 22, 2012--></ref> The most basic meaning of this Sanskrit term is with technique. The technique of the different forms of yoga is what makes the practice meaningful. Yoga is not an easy or simple practice, viyoga is what is described as simple.

Many Hindus tend to pick and choose between the five forms of yoga because of the way they live their life and how they want to practice it in the form they are most connected to.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stratton Hawley|first=John|title=Yoga and Viyoga: Simple Religion in Hinduism|journal=The Harvard Theological Review|date=January 1981|volume=74|series=no. 1|pages=1\u201320|doi=10.1017/s0017816000028492}}<!--|accessdate=September 22, 2012--></ref>\n\nIn the [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism of Tibet, however, the  term \"Yoga\" is simply used to refer to any type of spiritual practice; from the various types of tantra (like [[Kriyayoga]] or [[Charyayoga]]) to '[[Deity yoga]]' and '[[guru yoga]]'. In the early translation phase of the [[Sutrayana]] and [[Tantrayana]] from India, China and other regions to Tibet, along with the practice lineages of [[sadhana]], codified in the [[Nyingmapa]] canon, the most subtle 'conveyance' (Sanskrit: [[Yana (Buddhism)|yana]]) is [[Dzogchen|Adi Yoga]] (Sanskrit). A contemporary scholar with a focus on [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Robert Thurman]] writes that Patanjali was influenced by the success of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastic system to formulate his own matrix for the version of thought he considered orthodox.<ref>Robert Thurman, \"The Central Philosophy of Tibet.'' Princeton University Press, 1984, p. 34.</ref>\n\nThe yoga scholar [[Stephen Cope]] identifies the following similarities between [[Raja yoga]] and Buddhism.

Many scholars have noted that the concepts of [[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]] and [[sam\u0101dhi]] - technical terms describing stages of meditative absorption&nbsp;\u2013 are common to meditative practices in both Hinduism and Buddhism. Most notable in this context is the relationship between the system of four Buddhist ''dhyana'' states ([[Pali]]: [[Jhana in Theravada|''jhana'']]) and the ''samprajnata samadhi'' states of Classical Yoga.<ref>Samadhi: The Numinous and Cessative in Indo-Tibetan Yoga By Stuart Ray Sarbacker. {{ISBN|0-7914-6553-5}}. p. 77</ref> Also, many (Tibetan) Vajrayana practices of the [[generation stage]] and [[completion stage]] work with the [[chakras]], inner energy channels ([[nadi (yoga)|nadis]]) and [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]], called [[tummo]] in Tibetan.\n\n==Differences==\nDespite the similarities in terminology there exist differences between the two religions. There is no evidence to show that Buddhism ever subscribed to vedic sacrifices, vedic deities or caste.<ref>Y. Masih (2000) In : A Comparative Study of Religions, Motilal Banarsidass Publ : Delhi, {{ISBN|81-208-0815-0}} Page 18.</ref>\n\nThe major differences are mentioned below.\n\n===God===\n[[Gautama Buddha]] was very ambiguous about the existence of a Creator Deity ([[Brahman]]) and Eternal Self ([[\u0100tman (Buddhism)|Atman]]) and rejected them both. Various sources from the Pali Canon and others suggest that the Buddha taught that belief in a Creator deity was not essential to attaining liberation from suffering, and perhaps chose to ignore theological questions because they were \"fascinating to discuss,\" and frequently brought about more conflict and anger than peace.  The Buddha did not deny the existence of the  popular gods of the Vedic pantheon, but rather argued that these [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s, who may be in a more exalted state than humans, are still nevertheless trapped in the same samsaric cycle of suffering as other beings and are not necessarily worthy of veneration and worship. The focus of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], while inheriting many practices and ideologies from the previous Hindu yogic tradition, deviates from the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita and earlier works of the [[Dharmic Religions]] in that liberation ([[Nirvana]] or [[Moksha]]) is not attained via unity with Brahman (the Godhead), Self-realization or worship. Rather, the Buddha's teaching centers around what [[Eknath Easwaran]] described as a \"psychology of desire,\" that is attaining liberation from suffering by extermination of self-will, selfish desire and passions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Easwaran |first=Eknath |authorlink=Eknath Easwaran |title=The Dhammapada: (Classics of Indian Spirituality) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8czJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA227 |year=2007 |publisher=Nilgiri Press |isbn=978-1-58638-020-5 |page=227}}</ref> This is not to say that such teachings are absent from the previous Hindu tradition, rather they are singled out and separated from Vedic Theology.\n\nAccording to [[Buddhology|Buddhologist]] [[Richard Hayes (professor)|Richard Hayes]], the early Buddhist [[Nikaya]] literature treats the question of the existence of a creator god \"primarily from either an epistemological point of view or a moral point of view\". In these texts the [[Buddha]] is portrayed not as a creator-denying atheist who claims to be able to prove such a God's nonexistence, but rather his focus is other teachers' claims that their teachings lead to the highest good.<ref>Hayes, Richard P., [http://www.unm.edu/~rhayes/atheism.pdf \"Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition\"], ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar) pgs 5-6, 8</ref>\n\nCiting the ''Devadaha Sutta'' (Majjhima Nikaya 101), Hayes states, \"while the reader is left to conclude that it is attachment rather than God, actions in past lives, fate, type of birth or efforts in this life that is responsible for our experiences of sorrow, no systematic argument is given in an attempt to disprove the existence of God.\"<ref>Hayes, Richard P., \"Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition\", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar) pgs 9-10</ref>\n\nThe Buddha (as portrayed in the Pali scriptures, the [[\u0100gama (Buddhism)|agamas]]) set an important trend in [[Nontheistic#Nontheism in Buddhism|nontheism in Buddhism]] by establishing a somewhat non-theistic view on the notion of an omnipotent God, generally ignoring the issue as being irrelevant to his teachings.<ref name=\"gunasekara\">{{cite web|title=The Buddhist Attitude to God |work=Statement made to a Multi-religious Seminar |author=Dr V.

Hinduism though proposes detachment from fruits of action<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/3/verse/19|title=Chapter 3, Verse 19 \u2013 Bhagavad Gita, The Song of God \u2013 Swami Mukundananda|last=Mukundananda|first=Swami|access-date=2016-08-17}}</ref> and stresses on performance of duty or ''dharma'', it is not solely focused on it. In Hinduism, Lord Shiva explains 'death' to be journey of the immortal soul in pursuit of 'Moksha' and therefore a fact of life.\n# While Buddhism says retirement into forest was open to everyone regardless of caste, and although according to the vinaya (the code of conduct for the Sangha) it is not possible to take ordination as a Buddhist mendicant (a Bhikkhu or Bhikkhuni) under the age of 20 or adulthood, this is still viewed as escapism by Hinduism. Pre-Buddhist, non-brahman forest mendicants are criticised in the earliest group of Upanishads. Hinduism allows for this to happen only after performing all ''dharmas'' or duties of one's life, starting from studying scriptures, working to support children and family and taking care of aged parents and lastly after all the dharma done retire to the forest and slowly meditate, fast and perform rituals and austerities (tapas), until physical disintegration & to reach the ultimate truth or ''Brahman''. Buddhism by contrast emphasises realisation by the middle way (avoiding extremes of luxury or austerities), seeing limited value in the rituals and tapas and the danger of their mis-application.\n# Buddhism explained that attachment is the cause of sorrow in society. Therefore, Buddhism's cure for sorrow was detachment and non-involvement (non-action or negative action). Hinduism on the other hand explained that both sorrow or happiness is due to 'Karma' or past actions and bad karma can be overcome and good karma can be obtained by following dharma or righteous duty (pro-action or positive action) which will ultimately provide 'Moksha' i.e. overcoming the cycle of life and joining ''Brahman''.\n\nBuddhist canonical views about God and the priests are:\n\n{{quote|13. Well then, Vasettha, those ancient sages versed in ancient scriptures, the authors of the verses, the utterers of the verses, whose, ancient form of words so chanted, uttered, or composed, the priests of today chant over again or repeat; intoning or reciting exactly as has been intoned or recited-to wit, Atthaka, Vamaka, Vamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bharadvaja, Vasettha, Kassapa, and Bhagu [11]&nbsp;\u2013 did even they speak thus, saying: \"We know it, we have seen it\", where the creator is whence the creator is?}}\n\nScholar-monk [[Walpola Rahula]] writes that man depends on God \"for his own protection, safety, and security, just as a child depends on his parent.\" He describes this as a product of \"ignorance, weakness, fear, and desire,\" and writes that this \"deeply and fanatically held belief\" for man's consolation is \"false and empty\" from the perspective of Buddhism. He writes that man does not wish to hear or understand teachings against this belief, and that the Buddha described his teachings as \"against the current\" for this reason.<ref>Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught,'' pp. 51\u201352.</ref> He also wrote that for self-protection man created God and for self-preservation man created \"soul\".<ref>''What the Buddha Taught,'' pp.&nbsp;51\u201352.</ref>\n\nIn later Mahayana literature, however, the idea of an eternal, all-pervading, all-knowing, immaculate, uncreated and deathless Ground of Being (the dharmadhatu, inherently linked to the sattvadhatu, the realm of beings), which is the Awakened Mind (bodhicitta) or Dharmakaya (\"body of Truth\") of the Buddha himself, is attributed to the Buddha in a number of Mahayana sutras, and is found in various tantras as well. In some Mahayana texts, such a principle is occasionally presented as manifesting in a more personalised form as a primordial buddha, such as Samantabhadra, Vajradhara, Vairochana, Amitabha and Adi-Buddha, among others.\n\n===Rites and rituals===\nIn later tradition such as [[Mahayana Buddhism]] in Japan, the [[Shingon]] Fire Ritual (Homa /Yagna) and Urabon (Sanskrit: Ullambana) derives from Hindu traditions.<ref>R.K. Payne: The Tantric Ritual of Japan. Feeding the Gods: the Shingon Fire Ritual., and Koenraad Elst: Who is a Hindu? 2001</ref> Similar rituals are common in Tibetan Buddhism. Both Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism share common rites, such as the purification rite of Homa (Havan, Yagna in Sanskrit), prayers for the ancestors and deceased (Ullambana in Sanskrit, Urabon in Japanese).\n\n===Caste===\nThe Buddha repudiated the caste distinctions of the Brahmanical religion,<ref name=\"ccbs.ntu.edu.tw\">K.N.

They will even get into trouble from their own deeds, whatever their caste (Brahmin, Khattiya, Vessa, and Sudda) might be.<ref>{{cite book|title = The Long Discourses of the Buddha|first = Maurice|last = Walshe|page = 216|publisher = Wisdom Publications Inc|year = 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe superiority of Brahmanas were pretty clearly laid out in Buddhist scripture. In Madhura Sutta of the [[Majjhima Nikaya|Majjhimanikdya]] (II 4.4) and in the Assalayana Sutta of [[Majjhima Nikaya|Majjhima]] (II 5.3), the brahamanas claim to be of superior caste (\"''brdhmano seftho venno\"'') and the rest are of inferior caste (\"''hino anno vanno\"''), the brahmanas claim to have fair complexion (\"''sukko vanno\"''), while others are dark (\"''kanho''\"); the brahamanas are pure (\"''sujjhanti\"''), while non-brahamarws are not.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Krishan|first=Y.|date=1998|title=Buddhism and Caste System|journal=East and West|volume=48|issue=1/2|pages=41\u201355|issn=0012-8376|jstor=29757366}}</ref> Occupational mobility across caste divisions was frowned upon as indicated in Osukdri Sutta of the [[Majjhima Nikaya|Majjhima]] (II 5.6).<ref name=\":0\" /> In [[Jataka tales|Jataka]] like ''Setdketu Jataka, Matanga Jataka, Citta Sambhutta Jataka,'' there is evidence that the touch or sight of the pancamas was believed to cause pollution.\n\nThe Buddha himself didn't repudiate or condemn the caste system. In ''Citta Sambhutta Jataka'', describes the ''chandalas'' to be the lowest race and the meanest of men, and their origins traced to karma. Buddha in Ambaitha Sutta of [[Dighanikaya|Dighanikdya]] III says, \"''khattiyo va setfha hino brahmano''\" (he ksatriya is superior, brahmana inferior ) by the purity of their blood. Buddhist scriptures recognised caste distinctions in the present life as the product of a man's past karmas and not an accident of birth.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Cosmology and worldview===\n{{Main|Buddhist Cosmology}}\n\nIn [[Buddhist cosmology]], there are 31 planes of existence within samsara.<ref name=\"books.google.co.in\">Jacob N. Kinnard, ''The Emergence of Buddhism: Classical Traditions in Contemporary Perspective'',  Fortress [https://books.google.com/books?id=xIzyZ7Nvs7cC&pg=PA14&dq=buddhist+cosmology+31+realms&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gDMJUIvZCfGviQe84unrCQ&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=buddhist%20cosmology%2031%20realms&f=false], Page 14</ref> Beings in these realms are subject to rebirth after some period of time, except for realms of the Non-Returners. Therefore, most of these places are not the goal of the holy life in the Buddha's dispensation. Buddhas are beyond all these 31 planes of existence after parinibbana. Hindu texts mostly mentions the devas in Kamma Loka. Only the Hindu god Brahma can be found in the Rupa loka. There are many realms above Brahma realm that are accessible through meditation. Those in Brahma realm are also subject to rebirth according to the Buddha.\n\n===Practices===\n\nTo have an idea of the differences between Buddhism and pre-existing beliefs and practices during this time, we can look into the [[Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta]] in the [[Digha Nikaya]] of the [[Pali Canon]]. In this sutra, a king of Magadha listed the teachings from many prominent and famous spiritual teachers around during that time. He also asked the [[Buddha]] about his teaching when visiting him. The Buddha told the king about the practices of his spiritual path.  The list of various practices he taught disciples as well as practices he doesn't encourage are listed. The text, rather than stating what the new faith was, emphasized what the new faith was not.  Contemporaneous religious traditions were caricatured and then negated. Though critical of prevailing religious practices and social institutions on philosophical grounds, early Buddhist texts exhibit a reactionary anxiety at having to compete in religiously plural societies. Below are a few examples found in the sutra:\n\n{{quote|Whereas some priests and contemplatives... are addicted to high and luxurious furnishings such as these&nbsp;\u2014 over-sized couches, couches adorned with carved animals, long-haired coverlets, multi-colored patchwork coverlets, white woolen coverlets, woolen coverlets embroidered with flowers or animal figures, stuffed quilts, coverlets with fringe, silk coverlets embroidered with gems;

Could that be the path to Awakening?\" Then following on that memory came the realization: \"That is the path to Awakening.\"|<ref name=\"Nanamoli, Bhikkhu 1995\"/>}}\n\nAccording to the Upakkilesa Sutta, after figuring out the cause of the various obstacles and overcoming them, the Buddha was able to penetrate the sign and enters 1st- 4th Jhana.\n\n{{quote|I also saw both the light and the vision of forms. Shortly after the vision of light and shapes disappear. I thought, \"What is the cause and condition in which light and vision of the forms disappear?\u201d\n\nThen consider the following: \"The question arose in me and because of doubt my concentration fell, when my concentration fell, the light disappeared and the vision of forms. I act so that the question does not arise in me again.\u201d\n\nI remained diligent, ardent, perceived both the light and the vision of forms. Shortly after the vision of light and shapes disappear. I thought, \"What is the cause and condition in which light and vision of the forms disappear?\u201d\n\nThen consider the following: \u201cInattention arose in me because of inattention and my concentration has decreased, when my concentration fell, the light disappeared and the vision of forms. I must act in such a way that neither doubt nor disregard arise in me again.\u201d}}\n\nIn the same way as above, the Buddha encountered many more obstacles that caused the light to disappear  and found his way out of them. These include sloth and torpor, fear, elation, inertia, excessive energy, energy deficient, desire, perception of diversity, and excessive meditation on the ways. Finally, he was able to penetrate the light and entered jhana.\n\nThe following descriptions in the Upakkilesa Sutta further show how he find his way into the first four Jhanas, which he later considered [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|''samma samadhi'']].\n\n{{quote|When Anuruddha, I realized that doubt is an imperfection of the mind, I dropped out of doubt, an imperfection of the mind. When I realized that inattention ... sloth and torpor ... fear ... elation ... inertia ... excessive energy ... deficient energy ... desire ... perception of diversity ... excessive meditation on the ways, I abandoned excessive meditation on the ways, an imperfection of the mind.\n\nWhen Anuruddha, I realized that doubt is an imperfection of the mind, I dropped out of doubt, an imperfection of the mind.

The Buddha said in the Ariyapariyesana Sutta:\n\n{{quote|But the thought occurred to me, \"This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to Awakening, nor to Unbinding, but only to reappearance in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.\" So, dissatisfied with that Dhamma, I left.|<ref name=\"Nanamoli, Bhikkhu 1995\">Nanamoli, Bhikkhu (trans.)

Postgraduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies, University of Kelaniya, 1993, page 22.</ref>\nAlthough the \"Dimension of Nothingness\" and the \"Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception\" are included in the list of nine Jhanas taught by the Buddha, they are not included in the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. Noble Path number eight is \"Samma Samadhi\" (Right Concentration), and only the first four Jhanas are considered \"Right Concentration\". If he takes a disciple through all the Jhanas, the emphasis is on the \"Cessation of Feelings and Perceptions\" rather than stopping short at the \"Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception\".\n\nIn the Magga-vibhanga Sutta, the Buddha defines Right Concentration that belongs to the concentration (samadhi)  division of the path as the first four Jhanas:\n\n{{quote|And what is right concentration? There is the case where a monk&nbsp;\u2014 quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful (mental) qualities&nbsp;\u2014 enters & remains in the first Jhana: rapture & pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, he enters & remains in the Second Jhana: rapture & pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought & evaluation&nbsp;\u2014 internal assurance. With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the Third Jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous & mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure & pain&nbsp;\u2014 as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress&nbsp;\u2014 he enters & remains in the Fourth Jhana: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain.

He then underwent harsh ascetic practices that he eventually also became disillusioned with. He subsequently remembered entering ''jh\u0101na'' as a child, and realized that, \"That indeed is the path to enlightenment.\"\n\nIn the ''suttas'', the immaterial attainments are never referred to as ''jh\u0101nas''. The immaterial attainments have more to do with expanding, while the Jhanas (1-4) focus on  concentration. A common translation for the term \"samadhi\" is concentration. Rhys Davids and Maurice Walshe agreed that the term \u201d samadhi\u201d is not found in any pre-buddhist text. Hindu texts later used that term to indicate the state of enlightenment. This is not  in conformity with Buddhist usage. In ''The Long Discourse of the Buddha: A Translation of the Digha Nikaya'' (pg. 1700) Maurice Walshe wrote,\n\n{{quote|Rhys Davids also states that the term samadhi is not found in any pre-Buddhist text.

According to the ''[[Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta]]'' this sort of vision arose for the Buddhist adept as a result of the perfection of 'meditation' (Sanskrit: [[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|dhy\u0101na]]) coupled with the perfection of 'ethics' (Sanskrit: [[\u015b\u012bla]]). Some of the Buddha's meditative techniques were shared with other traditions of his day, but the idea that ethics are causally related to the attainment of \"religious insight\" (Sanskrit: [[Wisdom in Buddhism|praj\u00f1\u0101]]) was original.<ref name=\"westernbuddhistreview.com\">Dharmacarini Manishini, ''Western Buddhist Review.''

Buddhist identity has been broadly defined as one who \"[[Refuge (Buddhism)|takes Refuge]]\" in the [[Three Jewels]]: Buddha, Dharma, and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], echoing a formula seen in Buddhist texts. In some communities, formal conversion rituals are observed. No specific ethnicity has typically been associated with Buddhism, and as it spread beyond its origin in India immigrant monastics were replaced with newly ordained members of the local ethnic or tribal group.<ref>Hunter, W.

P. 149. {{ISBN|0-415-24495-1}}.</ref>\n\n===Soteriology===\nUpanishadic soteriology is focused on the static Self, while the Buddha's is focused on dynamic agency. In the former paradigm, change and movement are an illusion; to realize the Self as the only reality is to realize something that has always been the case. In the Buddha's system by contrast, one has to make things happen.<ref>Richard Gombrich, ''How Buddhism began: the Conditioned Genesis of the Early Teachings.'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 1996, p. 58.</ref>\n\nThe fire metaphor used in the [[Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta]] (which is also used elsewhere) is a radical way of making the point that the liberated sage is beyond phenomenal experience. It also makes the additional point that this indefinable, transcendent state is the sage's state even during life. This idea goes against the early Brahminic notion of liberation at death.<ref>Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, p. 96.</ref>\n\nLiberation for the Brahminic yogin was thought to be the permanent realization at death of a [[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|nondual meditative state]] anticipated in life. In fact, old Brahminic metaphors for the liberation at death of the yogic adept (\"becoming cool\", \"going out\") were given a new meaning by the Buddha; their point of reference became the sage who is liberated in life.<ref name=\"Alexander Wynne 2007, page 109\">Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, page 109.</ref> The Buddha taught that these meditative states alone do not offer a decisive and permanent end to suffering either during life or after death.<ref>Michael Carrithers, ''The Buddha,'' 1983, page 36. Found in ''Founders of Faith,'' Oxford University Press, 1986.</ref>\n\nHe stated that achieving a formless attainment with no further practice would only lead to temporary rebirth in a formless realm after death.<ref>Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, p. 21.</ref> Moreover, he gave a pragmatic refutation of early Brahminical theories according to which the meditator, the meditative state, and the proposed uncaused, unborn, unanalyzable Self, are identical.<ref name=\"Michael Carrithers 1983, pp. 41\u201342\">Michael Carrithers, ''The Buddha,'' 1983, pp. 41\u201342. Found in ''Founders of Faith,'' Oxford University Press, 1986.</ref> These theories are undergirded by the Upanishadic correspondence between macrocosm and microcosm, from which perspective it is not surprising that meditative states of consciousness were thought to be identical to the subtle strata of the cosmos.<ref>Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, p. 42.</ref> The Buddha, in contrast, argued that states of consciousness come about caused and conditioned by the yogi's training and techniques, and therefore no state of consciousness could be this eternal Self.<ref name=\"Michael Carrithers 1983, pp. 41\u201342\"/>\n\n====Nonduality====\nBoth the Buddha's conception of the liberated person and the goal of early Brahminic yoga can be characterized as nondual, but in different ways. The nondual goal in early [[Brahminism]] was conceived in [[ontology|ontological]] terms; the goal was that into which one merges after death. According to Wynne, liberation for the Buddha \"... is nondual in another, more radical, sense. This is made clear in the dialogue with Upasiva, where the liberated sage is defined as someone who has passed beyond conceptual dualities. Concepts that might have some meaning in ordinary discourse, such as consciousness or the lack of it, existence and non-existence, etc., do not apply to the sage. For the Buddha, propositions are not applicable to the liberated person, because language and concepts ([[Sutta Nipata|Sn]] 1076: ''vaadapathaa'', ''dhammaa''), as well as any sort of intellectual reckoning (''sankhaa'') do not apply to the liberated sage.<ref>Alexander Wynne 2007, page 109</ref>\n\n====Nirvana====\n''[[Nirvana]]'' (or Nibbana in Pali language) means literally 'blowing out' or 'quenching'. The term is  pre-Buddhist, but its etymology is not essentially conclusive for finding out its exact meaning as the highest goal of early Buddhism.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HP9O6OM4iOgC&pg=PA9&dq=its+etymology+is+not+necessarily+conclusive+for+determining+its+exact+meaning&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwieiuO9yMrWAhWBLI8KHV4PAM8Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=its%20etymology%20is%20not%20necessarily%20conclusive%20for%20determining%20its%20exact%20meaning&f=false Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy], Edward Craig, 1.

Possibly the most famous Upanishadic dictum is ''[[tat tvam asi]]'', \"thou art that.\" Transposed into first person, the [[Pali]] version is ''eso \u2018ham asmi'', \"I am this.\" This is said in several suttas to be false. The full statement declared to be incorrect is \"This is mine, I am this, this is my self/essence.\" This is often rejected as a wrong view.<ref>Richard Francis Gombrich, How Buddhism began: the conditioned genesis of the early teachings Continuum International Publishing Group, 1996, page 38.</ref> The Alagaduppama Sutta rejects this and other obvious echoes of surviving Upanishadic statements as well (these are not mentioned as such in the commentaries, and seem not to have been noticed until modern times). Moreover, the passage denies that one\u2019s self is the same as the world and that one will become the world self at death.<ref name=\"Richard Francis Gombrich 1996, page 39\">Richard Francis Gombrich, How Buddhism began: the conditioned genesis of the early teachings Continuum International Publishing Group, 1996, p. 39.</ref> The Buddha tells the monks that people worry about something that is non-existent externally ([https://notesfrommylibrary.com/2011/04/15/denial-of-the-atman-%E2%80%93-the-alagaddupama-sutta/ ''bahiddhaa asati'')] and non-existent internally (''ajjhattam asati''); he is referring respectively to the soul/essence of the world and of the individual.<ref name=\"Richard Francis Gombrich 1996, page 39\"/> A similar rejection of \"internal\" Self and \"external\" Self occurs at AN II 212.

Routledge 2007, pp. 50, 96.</ref> The Buddha's rejection of these theories is therefore one instance of the Buddha's attack on the whole enterprise of Upanishadic ontology.<ref>Richard Francis Gombrich, ''How Buddhism began: the conditioned genesis of the early teachings.''

In that regard, the chapter on Brahmins in the Dhammapada may be regarded as being entirely in tune with the definition of a Brahmin in Chapter 18 of the Bhagavad Gita. Both say that a Brahmin is a person having certain qualities.\n\nA defining of feature of the Buddha's teachings is self-sufficiency, so much so as to render the Brahminical priesthood entirely redundant.<ref>Sue Hamilton, ''Early Buddhism: A New Approach: The I of the Beholder.''

In front of the White House, a group of anti-marijuana protesters are gathered, seemingly unbothered by the zombies around them. This sparks debate between Clancy and Glasses Man as to whether there is such a thing as a 'good drug' or a 'bad drug'. Over the course of the episode, the two discuss the pros and cons of psychedelics, the dangers of drug usage if not well educated, and whether or not drugs can be beneficial for an individual's personal spiritual growth. They end up helping a pregnant woman give birth before they are all turned into zombies. However, they find the new situation relieving.

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\nLater, the rough of concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix has ordered eight episodes, which is slated to premiere in sometime in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|website=Animation Magazine|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> Mike Mayfield joined the project as supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show are composed by Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production was they need to know how much of the episodes will be story to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell the parts of podcast who entered the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> The main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation. They also worked to find a way to embed them in psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. The episodes should have a balance so that the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation people would not pay attention to everything at the same time. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> Acording Trussell the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]] lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like Space Ghost: Coast 2 Coast and [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]. Others shows included [[Watership Down]], [[The Last Unicorn]], Liquid Television; Aeon Flux and [[David Lynch]] was a big influence in how when you watch [[Twin Peak]].<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, that it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation <ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and the new show would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. Acording to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that somewhat was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\"<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. As part of the promotional action for series, Netflix launched on April 19, 2020 on its YouTube channel a live with a countdown to series. Throughout the live, small portions of the episode were shown as well as a psychedelic animation.<ref name=\"Countdown\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by [[Netflix]], was released on April 20, 2020. According to Trussell, the Netflix executives first suggested dropping the series on the unofficial stoner holiday and Ward suggests putting the show out on 4/20. The date is Trussell's birthday and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-oriented celebrations that take place annually on April 20.<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = The Midnight Gospel\n| image                    = File:The Midnight Gospel promotional poster.jpg\n| caption                  = Promotional poster\n| genre                    = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Adult animation]]\n* [[Surrealism]]\n* [[Science fantasy]]\n* [[Dark comedy]]\n* [[Adventure fiction|Adventure]]\n* [[Interview]]\n}}\n| director                 = {{Plainlist|\n* Pendleton Ward\n* Mike L.

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\nLater, the rough of concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix has ordered eight episodes, which is slated to premiere in sometime in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|website=Animation Magazine|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> Mike Mayfield joined the project as supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show are composed by Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production was they need to know how much of the episodes will be story to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell the parts of podcast who entered the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> The main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation. They also worked to find a way to embed them in psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. The episodes should have a balance so that the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation people would not pay attention to everything at the same time. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> Acording Trussell the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]] lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like Space Ghost: Coast 2 Coast and [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]. Others shows included [[Watership Down]], The Last Unicorn, Liquid Television; Aeon Flux and [[David Lynch]] was a big influence in how when you watch [[Twin Peak]]. <ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, that it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation <ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and the new show would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. Acording to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that somewhat was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\" <ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. As part of the promotional action for series, Netflix launched on April 19, 2020 on its YouTube channel a live with a countdown to series. Throughout the live, small portions of the episode were shown as well as a psychedelic animation.<ref name=\"Coutdown\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by [[Netflix]], was released on April 20, 2020. According to Trussell, the Netflix executives first suggested dropping the series on the unofficial stoner holiday and Ward suggests putting the show out on 4/20. The date is Trussell's birthday and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-oriented celebrations that take place annually on April 20.<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "name_user": "Prince Silversaddle", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Gospel"}

For this reason the Change Journal cannot be used to undo operations on files within NTFS.\n\n==Uses==\nThe USN Journal is used by the [[File History]] feature introduced in [[Windows 8]] to determine which files have changed since the last backup so that only files that have changed are added to the history so far.<ref name=\"Ars Technica File History\">{{cite web|last=Bright|first=Peter|title=A step back in time with Windows 8\u2032s File History|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/07/a-step-back-in-time-with-windows-8s-file-history/|work=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=2 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363798.aspx|title=Change Journals (Windows)|work=Microsoft Developers Network Library, Win32 and COM Development, Volume Management|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=10 June 2009}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/fsutil_usn.mspx?mfr=true|title=FSUTIL: USN|work=Windows XP Professional Product Documentation|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=10 June 2009}}\n*{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc788042.aspx|title=FSUTIL: USN|date=28 September 2007|work=Microsoft Technet Library, Windows Server Tech Center|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=10 June 2009}}\n*{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc771388.aspx|title=NTFS Self-Healing|date=21 January 2008|work=Microsoft Technet Library, Windows Server Tech Center|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=10 June 2009}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Usn Journal}}\n[[Category:Computer file systems]]\n[[Category:Windows disk file systems]]\n", "name_user": "Dl2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "repair template; tidy", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USN_Journal"}

The film was Erice's debut and is considered a masterpiece of [[Spanish cinema]].<ref>Curran, Daniel, ed. ''Foreign Films,'' film review and analysis of ''The Spirit of the Beehive,'' pp. 161-2, 1989. Evanston, Illinois: [[Cinebooks]]. {{ISBN|0-933997-22-1}}.</ref>\n\nThe film focuses on the young girl Ana and her fascination with the 1931 American horror film ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', as well as exploring her family life and schooling. The film has been called a \"bewitching portrait of a child\u2019s haunted inner life\".<ref>[http://www.criterion.com/films/367 The Criterion Collection.] Accessed 2010</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSix-year-old Ana is a shy girl who lives in the manor house in an isolated Spanish village on the [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian plateau]] with her parents Fernando and Teresa and her older sister, Isabel. The year is 1940, and the civil war has just ended with the [[Francoist]] victory over the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican forces]]. Her aging father spends most of his time absorbed in tending to and writing about his beehives; her much younger mother is caught up in daydreams about a distant lover, to whom she writes letters. Ana's closest companion is Isabel, who loves her but cannot resist playing on her little sister's gullibility.\n\nA [[mobile cinema]] brings ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' to the village and the two sisters go to see it. The film makes a deep impression on Ana, in particular, the scene where [[Frankenstein's monster|the monster]] plays benignly with a little girl, then accidentally kills her. She asks her sister: \"Why did he kill the girl, and why did they kill him after that?\" Isabel tells her that the monster did not kill the girl and is not really dead; she says that everything in films is fake. Isabel says the monster is like a spirit, and Ana can talk to him if she closes her eyes and calls him.\n\nAna's fascination with the story increases when Isabel takes her to a desolate [[sheepfold]], which she claims is the monster's house. Ana returns alone several times to look for him and eventually discovers a wounded republican soldier hiding in the sheepfold. Instead of running away, she feeds him and even brings him her father's coat and watch. One night the Francoist police come and find the republican soldier and shoot him. The police soon connect Ana's father with the fugitive and assume he stole the items from him. The father discovers which of the daughters had helped the fugitive by noticing Ana's reaction when he produces the pocket watch.  When Ana next goes to visit the soldier, she finds him gone, with blood stains still on the ground. Her father confronts her, and she runs away.\n\nAna's family and the other villagers search for her all night, mirroring a scene from Frankenstein. While she kneels next to a lake, she sees Frankenstein's monster approaching from the forest and kneeling beside her. The next day, they find Ana physically unharmed. The doctor assures her mother that she will gradually recover from her unspecified \"trauma,\" but Ana instead withdraws from her family, preferring to stand alone by the window and silently call to the spirit, just as Isabel told her to.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fernando Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez]] as Fernando\n* [[Teresa Gimpera]] as Teresa\n* [[Ana Torrent]] as Ana\n* Isabel Teller\u00eda as Isabel\n* Ketty de la C\u00e1mara as Milagros, the maid\n* Estanis Gonz\u00e1lez as Civil Guard\n* Jos\u00e9 Villasante as [[Frankenstein's monster|The Frankenstein Monster]]\n* Juan Margallo as The Fugitive\n* Laly Soldevila as Do\u00f1a Luc\u00eda, the teacher\n* Miguel Picazo as the Doctor\n\n==Historical context==\n[[General Franco|Francisco Franco]] came to power in Spain in 1939, after a [[Spanish Civil War|bloody civil war]] that overthrew a [[Republican Spain|leftist government]]. The war split families and left a society divided and intimidated into silence in the years following the civil war. The film was made in 1973, when the [[Francoist State]] was not as severe as it had been at the beginning; however, it was still not possible to be openly critical of the Francoist State. Artists in all media in Spain had already managed to slip material critical of Francoist Spain past the censor. Most notable is the director [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]], who shot ''[[Viridiana]]'' there in 1962. By making films rich in symbolism and subtlety, a message could be embodied in a film that would be accepted or missed by the censor's office.<ref name=\"Hagopian\"/>\n\n==Symbolism==\nThe film is rife with symbolism and the disintegration of the family's emotional life can be seen as symbolic of the emotional disintegration of the Spanish nation during the civil war.<ref name=\"Hagopian\">{{cite web|url=http://www.albany.edu/writers-inst/webpages4/filmnotes/beehive.html|title=FILM NOTES -The Spirit of the Beehive|last=Hagopian|first=Kevin Jack |date=8 April 2009 |work=New York State Writers' Institute|publisher=University of Albany|accessdate=9 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Wilson\">{{cite web|url=http://thirtyframesasecond.blogspot.com/2008/08/spirit-of-beehive-1973-spain-victor.html|title=The Spirit of the Beehive (1973, Spain, Victor Erice)|last=Wilson|first=Kevin |date= 25 August 2008|publisher=thirtyframesasecond|accessdate=8 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Cinerg\u00eda\"/>\n\nThe barren empty landscapes around the sheepfold have been seen as representing Spain's isolation during the beginning years of the Francoist State.<ref name=\"Cinerg\u00eda\"/>\n\nIn the film, Fernando describes in writing his revulsion at the mindless activity of the  beehive.

This is because Ana, at her young age of seven at the time of filming was confused by the on- and off-screen naming.

It is taken from a book, in my opinion the most beautiful thing ever written about the life of bees, written by the great poet and playwright [[Maurice Maeterlinck]].

The film's producer said many in the audience offered him their condolences after the first screening in late 1973.\n\nYears later, when the film was re-released in the [[United States]] in early 2007, [[A.O. Scott]], film critic for ''[[The New York Times]],'' reviewed it and lauded the direction of the drama, writing: \"The story that emerges from [Erice's] lovely, lovingly considered images is at once lucid and enigmatic, poised between adult longing and childlike eagerness, sorrowful knowledge and startled innocence.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/2006/01/27/movies/27beeh.html Scott, A. O.] ''The New York Times,'' film review, January 27, 2006. Last accessed: December 18, 2007.</ref>\n\nFilm critic Dan Callahan praised the film's cinematography, story, direction and acting. He wrote, \"Every magic hour, light-drenched image in Victor Erice's ''The Spirit of the Beehive'' is filled with mysterious dread....There's something voluptuous about the cinematography, and this suits the sense of emerging sexuality in the girls, especially in the scene where Isabel speculatively paints her lips with blood from her own finger...[and] Torrent, with her severe, beautiful little face, provides an eerily unflappable presence to center the film. The one time she smiles, it's like a small miracle, a glimpse of grace amid the uneasiness of black cats, hurtling black trains, devouring fire and poisonous mushrooms. These signs of dismay haunt the movie.\"<ref>[http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=2032 Callahan, Dan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213084855/http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=2032 |date=2007-12-13 }}.

The film has been called a \"bewitching portrait of a child\u2019s haunted inner life\".<ref>[http://www.criterion.com/films/367 The Criterion Collection.] Accessed 2010</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSix-year-old Ana is a shy girl who lives in the manor house in an isolated Spanish village on the [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian plateau]] with her parents Fernando and Teresa and her older sister, Isabel. The year is 1940, and the civil war has just ended with the [[Francoist]] victory over the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican forces]]. Her aging father spends most of his time absorbed in tending to and writing about his beehives; her much younger mother is caught up in daydreams about a distant lover, to whom she writes letters. Ana's closest companion is Isabel, who loves her but cannot resist playing on her little sister's gullibility.\n\nA [[mobile cinema]] brings ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' to the village and the two sisters go to see it. The film makes a deep impression on Ana, in particular, the scene where [[Frankenstein's monster|the monster]] plays benignly with a little girl, then accidentally kills her. She asks her sister: \"Why did he kill the girl, and why did they kill him after that?\" Isabel tells her that the monster did not kill the girl and is not really dead; she says that everything in films is fake. Isabel says the monster is like a spirit, and Ana can talk to him if she closes her eyes and calls him.\n\nAna's fascination with the story increases when Isabel takes her to a desolate [[sheepfold]], which she claims is the monster's house. Ana returns alone several times to look for him and eventually discovers a wounded republican soldier hiding in the sheepfold. Instead of running away, she feeds him and even brings him her father's coat and watch. One night the Francoist police come and find the republican soldier and shoot him. The police soon connect Ana's father with the fugitive and assume he stole the items from him. The father discovers which of the daughters had helped the fugitive by noticing Ana's reaction when he produces the pocket watch.  When Ana next goes to visit the soldier, she finds him gone, with blood stains still on the ground. Her father confronts her, and she runs away.\n\nAna's family and the other villagers search for her all night, mirroring a scene from Frankenstein. While she kneels next to a lake, she sees Frankenstein's monster approaching from the forest and kneeling beside her. The next day, they find Ana physically unharmed. The doctor assures her mother that she will gradually recover from her unspecified \"trauma,\" but Ana instead withdraws from her family, preferring to stand alone by the window and silently call to the spirit, just as Isabel told her to.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fernando Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez]] as Fernando\n* [[Teresa Gimpera]] as Teresa\n* [[Ana Torrent]] as Ana\n* Isabel Teller\u00eda as Isabel\n* Ketty de la C\u00e1mara as Milagros, the maid\n* Estanis Gonz\u00e1lez as Guardia civil\n* Jos\u00e9 Villasante as [[Frankenstein's monster|The Frankenstein Monster]]\n* Juan Margallo as The Fugitive\n* Laly Soldevila as Do\u00f1a Luc\u00eda, the teacher\n* Miguel Picazo as the Doctor\n\n==Historical context==\n[[General Franco|Francisco Franco]] came to power in Spain in 1939, after a [[Spanish Civil War|bloody civil war]] that overthrew a [[Republican Spain|leftist government]]. The war split families and left a society divided and intimidated into silence in the years following the civil war. The film was made in 1973, when the [[Francoist State]] was not as severe as it had been at the beginning; however, it was still not possible to be openly critical of the Francoist State. Artists in all media in Spain had already managed to slip material critical of Francoist Spain past the censor. Most notable is the director [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]], who shot ''[[Viridiana]]'' there in 1962. By making films rich in symbolism and subtlety, a message could be embodied in a film that would be accepted or missed by the censor's office.<ref name=\"Hagopian\"/>\n\n==Symbolism==\nThe film is rife with symbolism and the disintegration of the family's emotional life can be seen as symbolic of the emotional disintegration of the Spanish nation during the civil war.<ref name=\"Hagopian\">{{cite web|url=http://www.albany.edu/writers-inst/webpages4/filmnotes/beehive.html|title=FILM NOTES -The Spirit of the Beehive|last=Hagopian|first=Kevin Jack |date=8 April 2009 |work=New York State Writers' Institute|publisher=University of Albany|accessdate=9 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Wilson\">{{cite web|url=http://thirtyframesasecond.blogspot.com/2008/08/spirit-of-beehive-1973-spain-victor.html|title=The Spirit of the Beehive (1973, Spain, Victor Erice)|last=Wilson|first=Kevin |date= 25 August 2008|publisher=thirtyframesasecond|accessdate=8 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Cinerg\u00eda\"/>\n\nThe barren empty landscapes around the sheepfold have been seen as representing Spain's isolation during the beginning years of the Francoist State.<ref name=\"Cinerg\u00eda\"/>\n\nIn the film, Fernando describes in writing his revulsion at the mindless activity of the  beehive.

The film's producer said many in the audience offered him their condolences after the first screening in late 1973.\n\nYears later, when the film was re-released in the [[United States]] in early 2007, [[A.O. Scott]], film critic for ''[[The New York Times]],'' reviewed it and lauded the direction of the drama, writing: \"The story that emerges from [Erice's] lovely, lovingly considered images is at once lucid and enigmatic, poised between adult longing and childlike eagerness, sorrowful knowledge and startled innocence.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/2006/01/27/movies/27beeh.html Scott, A. O.] ''The New York Times,'' film review, January 27, 2006. Last accessed: December 18, 2007.</ref>\n\nFilm critic Dan Callahan praised the film's cinematography, story, direction and acting. He wrote, \"Every magic hour, light-drenched image in Victor Erice's ''The Spirit of the Beehive'' is filled with mysterious dread....There's something voluptuous about the cinematography, and this suits the sense of emerging sexuality in the girls, especially in the scene where Isabel speculatively paints her lips with blood from her own finger...[and] Torrent, with her severe, beautiful little face, provides an eerily unflappable presence to center the film. The one time she smiles, it's like a small miracle, a glimpse of grace amid the uneasiness of black cats, hurtling black trains, devouring fire and poisonous mushrooms. These signs of dismay haunt the movie.\"<ref>[http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=2032 Callahan, Dan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213084855/http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=2032 |date=2007-12-13 }}.
