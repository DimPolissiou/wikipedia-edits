Though he often fights with his cousin Gopi ([[Deepak Dobriyal]])\u2014who runs a competing sweet-shop nearby\u2014over the Ghasiteram family name, they are greatly fond of each other and of Champak's daughter Tarika ([[Radhika Madan]]), who has always harboured a dream to travel and study abroad. Despite Tarika being poor in studies, Champak is strongly supportive of her dream, and, with some effort, she secures a high rank in her final school examinations, enough for her to secure a scholarship from London's Truford University, which has partnered with her school.\n\nOn the school's Annual Day, Champak notices that the chief guest is Judge Chheda, who had accepted a watch as a bribe from Gopi a few days before so that he could win the rights to the Ghasiteram name. He goes on stage and exposes the judge, who is in the middle of a speech on honesty and values, not knowing that he is the principal's husband. The following morning, he meets the principal at her home and asks for forgiveness, only for her to tear Tarika's scholarship letter to pieces. He vows to send Tarika to London, come what may.\n\nWith the help of a London-based acquaintance, Bablu ([[Ranvir Shorey]]), Champak and Tarika along with Gopi proceed to London so that Tarika can find accommodation there till college opens. However, Champak and Gopi are caught and interrogated by the airport police. When they inadvertently say that they have 'drugs', they are deported and their passports blacklisted. Tarika, who had been calling Champak, Gopi and Bablu to no avail, goes to a rented home, and starts enjoying the free-spirited London life while also trying to fund her education. Meanwhile, Champak and Gopi are referred to a fixer in Dubai, Tony ([[Pankaj Tripathi]]), who gives them Pakistani aliases and forged passports. They return to London and are briefly accosted by Naina ([[Kareena Kapoor Khan]]), a cop. They find lodging in a house owned by Mrs. Kohli ([[Dimple Kapadia]]), who is Naina's estranged mother.\n\nWhen they meet Tarika, Champak is aghast at her lifestyle, and demands that she leave her lodgings or he will severe ties with her. Gopi asks him why he says so, to which he replies that this is in order to avoid getting caught by Naina. The two visit a police station, where Bablu is lodged; they pay for his bail, and he tells them that he is now penniless. One night, Mrs. Kohli has invited the Bansals for dinner on the eve of her birthday, when Naina suddenly barges in and says that since her mother has not cared for her, she can do whatever she pleases. The next day, Champak and Gopi find the senior Kohli unconscious on the floor, and rush her to the hospital, narrowly saving her life. When Naina arrives on the scene, she breaks down and realises the value of caring for her.\n\nChampak, Gopi and Bablu hear of a fundraiser organised by Truford University and reluctantly agree to bid for its renovation, which costs 250,000 pounds. At their wits' end for arranging for such a large sum, they agree to sell the Ghasiteram family name. When Champak tells Tarika the news, she is nonplussed. The next day, as the three go to a scrapyard to collect the money, Champak pours his entire story to Tarika, who is convinced that she should not have put him and Gopi through so much trouble to fulfil her dream. Tarika later decides to give up her London scholarship and study back home in Udaipur, to which everyone agrees. The film ends with Champak and Gopi making peace over the Ghasiteram name.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Irrfan Khan]] as Champak Bansal\n* [[Radhika Madan]] as Tarika Bansal\n* [[Deepak Dobriyal]] as Gopi Bansal \n* [[Dimple Kapadia]] as Mrs. Sampada Kohli\n*[[Kareena Kapoor Khan]] as Officer Naina Kohli\n* [[Ranvir Shorey]] as Balashankar Tripathi / Bablu\n* [[Pankaj Tripathi]] as Tony \n* [[Kiku Sharda]] as Gajju\n* [[Manu Rishi]] as Bheluram Bansal\n* [[Zakir Hussain (actor)|Zakir Hussain]] as Judge Chedda\n* [[Meghna Malik]] as Principal\n* [[Poorvi Jain]] as Rashi Bansal\n* [[Manish Gandhi]] as Advait\n* [[Tillotama Shome]] as Consultant\n* Vipul Tank as Lagnesh\n* Ankit Bisht as Anmol\n* [[Anushka Sharma]] Special appearance in song \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\" \n* [[Katrina Kaif]] Special appearance in song \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\" \n* [[Alia Bhatt]] Special appearance in song  \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\" \n* [[Janhvi Kapoor]] Special appearance in song \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\" \n* [[Ananya Panday]] Special appearance in song \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\" \n* [[Kriti Sanon]] Special appearance in song \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\" \n* [[Kiara Advani]] Special appearance in song \"Kudi Nu Nachne De\"\n\n== Production ==\nIn June 2017 in an interview after the success of his film ''[[Hindi Medium]]'' producer [[Dinesh Vijan]] told ''[[Mid Day]]'', \"There is definitely scope for a sequel.

She joins her daughter [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]], Joseph, and a young boy who will later become known as [[John the Baptist]] in caring for the injured hand of Jesus.\n\n===Iconography===\nThe subject of Joachim and Anne ''[[Joachim and Anne Meeting at the Golden Gate|The Meeting at the Golden Gate]]'' was a regular component of artistic cycles of the [[Life of the Virgin]]. The couple meet at the [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|Golden Gate]] of [[Jerusalem]] and embrace. They are aware of Anne's pregnancy, of which they have been separately informed by an archangel. This moment stood for the conception of Mary, and the feast was celebrated on the same day as the [[Immaculate Conception]]. Art works representing the Golden Gate and the events leading up to it were influenced by the narrative in the widely read ''Golden Legend'' of Jacobus de Voragine. The [[Nativity of Mary|Birth of Mary]], the [[Presentation of Mary]] and the [[Marriage of the Virgin]] were usual components of cycles of the Life of the Virgin in which Anne is normally shown here.\n\nHer emblem is a door.<ref name=crawley/> She is often portrayed wearing red and green, representing love and life.<ref name=\"Fongemie\" />\n\nAnne is never shown as present at the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]], but is frequently shown with the infant Christ in various subjects. She is sometimes believed to be depicted in scenes of the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]] and the [[Circumcision of Christ]], but in the former case, this likely reflects a misidentification through confusion with [[Anna the Prophetess]]. There was a tradition that Anne went (separately) to Egypt and rejoined the [[Holy Family]] after their [[Flight to Egypt]]. Anne is not seen with the adult Christ, so was regarded as having died during the youth of Jesus.<ref>Some writers gave her age at death, as part of a general family chronology, but no generally accepted tradition developed on this point, even during the Middle Ages.</ref> Anne is also shown as the matriarch of the [[Holy Kinship]], the extended family of Jesus, a popular subject in late medieval Germany; some versions of these pictorial and sculptural depictions include [[Emerentia]] who was reputed in the 15th Century to be Anne's mother. In modern devotions, Anne and her husband are invoked for protection for the unborn.\n\n===Virgin and Child with Saint Anne===\nThe role of the Messiah's grandparents in salvation history was commonly depicted in early medieval devotional art in a vertical double-Madonna arrangement known as the [[Virgin and Child with Saint Anne]].

She joins her daughter [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]], Joseph, and a young boy who will later become known as [[John the Baptist]] in caring for the injured hand of Jesus.\n\n===Iconography===\nThe subject of Joachim and Anne ''[[Joachim and Anne Meeting at the Golden Gate|The Meeting at the Golden Gate]]'' was a regular component of artistic cycles of the [[Life of the Virgin]]. The couple meet at the [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|Golden Gate]] of [[Jerusalem]] and embrace. They are aware of Anne's pregnancy, of which they have been separately informed by an archangel. This moment stood for the conception of Mary, and the feast was celebrated on the same day as the [[Immaculate Conception]]. Art works representing the Golden Gate and the events leading up to it were influenced by the narrative in the widely read ''Golden Legend'' of Jacobus de Voragine. The [[Nativity of Mary|Birth of Mary]], the [[Presentation of Mary]] and the [[Marriage of the Virgin]] were usual components of cycles of the Life of the Virgin in which Anne is normally shown here.\n\nHer emblem is a door.<ref name=crawley/> She is often portrayed wearing red and green, representing love and life.<ref name=\"Fongemie\" />\n\nAnne is never shown as present at the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]], but is frequently shown with the infant Christ in various subjects. She is sometimes believed to be depicted in scenes of the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]] and the [[Circumcision of Christ]], but in the former case, this likely reflects a misidentification through confusion with [[Anna the Prophetess]]. There was a tradition that Anne went (separately) to Egypt and rejoined the [[Holy Family]] after their [[Flight to Egypt]]. Anne is not seen with the adult Christ, so was regarded as having died during the youth of Jesus.<ref>Some writers gave her age at death, as part of a general family chronology, but no generally accepted tradition developed on this point, even during the Middle Ages.</ref> Anne is also shown as the matriarch of the [[Holy Kinship]], the extended family of Jesus, a popular subject in late medieval Germany; some versions of these pictorial and sculptural depictions include [[Emerentia]] who was reputed in the 15th Century to be Anne's mother. In modern devotions, Anne and her husband are invoked for protection for the unborn.\n\n===Virgin and Child with Saint Anne===\nThe role of the Messiah's grandparents in salvation history was commonly depicted in early medieval devotional art in a vertical double-Madonna arrangement known as the [[Virgin and Child with Saint Anne]].
