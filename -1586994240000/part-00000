{"title_page": "Generator (computer programming)", "text_new": "{{other uses|Generator (disambiguation)#Computing}}\n\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2007}}\n\nIn [[computer science]], a '''generator''' is a [[subroutine|routine]] that can be used to control the [[iteration]] behaviour of a [[control flow#Loops|loop]]. All generators are also [[iterator]]s.<ref>[https://stackoverflow.com/q/1022564 What is the difference between an Iterator and a Generator?]</ref> A generator is very similar to a function that returns an array, in that a generator has parameters, can be called, and generates a sequence of values. However, instead of building an array containing all the values and returning them all at once, a generator yields the values one at a time, which requires less memory and allows the caller to get started processing the first few values immediately.  In short, a generator ''looks like'' a function but ''behaves like'' an [[iterator]].\n\nGenerators can be implemented in terms of more expressive [[control flow]] constructs, such as [[coroutine]]s or first-class [[continuation]]s.<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Kiselyov\n| first = Oleg\n|date=January 2004\n| title = General ways to traverse collections in Scheme\n| url = http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/enumerators-callcc.html\n}}</ref> Generators, also known as semicoroutines,<ref name=\"Ralston2000\">{{cite book|author=Anthony Ralston|title=Encyclopedia of computer science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQ9LAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=11 May 2013|year=2000|publisher=Nature Pub. Group|isbn=978-1-56159-248-7}}</ref> are a special case of (and weaker than) coroutines, in that they always yield control back to the caller (when passing a value back), rather than specifying a coroutine to jump to; see [[Coroutine#Comparison with generators|comparison of coroutines with generators]].\n\n==Uses==\n\nGenerators are usually [[execution (computers)|invoked]] inside loops.<ref name=icon>The [[Icon (programming language)|Icon Programming Language]] utilizes generators to implement its goal directed evaluation. In Icon, generators can be invoked in contexts outside of the normal looping control structures.</ref>  The first time that a generator invocation is reached in a loop, an iterator [[object (computer science)|object]] is created that encapsulates the state of the generator routine at its beginning, with arguments bound to the corresponding [[parameter (computer science)|parameter]]s.  The generator's body is then executed in the context of that iterator until a special ''yield'' action is encountered; at that time, the value provided with the ''yield'' action is used as the value of the invocation expression.  The next time the same generator invocation is reached in a subsequent iteration, the execution of the generator's body is resumed after the ''yield'' action, until yet another ''yield'' action is encountered.  In addition to the ''yield'' action, execution of the generator body can also be terminated by a ''finish'' action, at which time the innermost loop enclosing the generator invocation is terminated. In more complicated situations, a generator may be used manually outside of a loop to create an iterator, which can then be used in various ways.\n\nBecause generators compute their yielded values only on demand, they are useful for representing [[Stream (computing)|streams]], such as sequences that would be expensive or impossible to compute at once. These include e.g. infinite sequences and live data streams.\n\nWhen eager evaluation is desirable (primarily when the sequence is finite, as otherwise evaluation will never terminate), one can either convert to a [[List (abstract data type)|list]], or use a parallel construction that creates a list instead of a generator. For example, in Python a generator <code>g</code> can be evaluated to a list <code>l</code> via <code>l = list(g)</code>, while in [[F Sharp programming language|F#]] the sequence expression <code>seq { ... }</code> evaluates lazily (a generator or sequence) but <code>[ ... ]</code> evaluates eagerly (a list).\n\nIn the presence of generators, loop constructs of a language \u2013 such as for and while \u2013 can be reduced into a single loop ... end loop construct; all the usual loop constructs can then be comfortably simulated by using suitable generators in the right way. For example, a ranged loop like <code>for x = 1 to 10</code> can be implemented as iteration through a generator, as in Python's <code>for x in range(1, 10)</code>. Further, <code>break</code> can be implemented as sending ''finish'' to the generator and then using <code>continue</code> in the loop.\n\n==Timeline==\n\nGenerators first appeared in [[CLU programming language|CLU]] (1975),<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Liskov\n| first = Barbara\n| authorlink = Barbara Liskov\n| date = April 1992\n| title = A History of CLU\n| url = http://www.lcs.mit.edu/publications/pubs/pdf/MIT-LCS-TR-561.pdf\n| format = pdf\n| access-date = 2006-01-05\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030917041834/http://www.lcs.mit.edu/publications/pubs/pdf/MIT-LCS-TR-561.pdf\n| archive-date = 2003-09-17\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref> were a prominent feature in the string manipulation language [[Icon (programming language)|Icon]] (1977) and are now available in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (2001),<ref name=python>\nPython Enhancement Proposals:\n[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/ PEP 255: Simple Generators],\n[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/ PEP 289: Generator Expressions],\n[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0342/ PEP 342: Coroutines via Enhanced Generators]\n</ref> [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]],<ref>\n[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9k7k7cf0.aspx yield (C# Reference)]\n</ref> [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], the later versions of ECMAScript (as of ES6/ES2015) and other languages.  In CLU and C#, generators are called ''iterators'', and in Ruby, ''enumerators''.\n\n===Lisp===\n\nThe final [[Common Lisp]] standard does not natively provide generators, yet various library implementations exist, such as [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/node347.html#SECTION003400000000000000000 SERIES] documented in CLtL2 or [https://web.archive.org/web/20110723043455/http://cliki.net/pygen pygen].\n\n===CLU===\n\nA yield statement is used to implement iterators over user-defined data abstractions.<ref name=Liskov1977>{{cite journal | citeseerx=10.1.1.112.656 | last1 = Liskov | first1 = B. | last2 = Snyder | first2 = A. | last3 = Atkinson | first3 = R. | last4 = Schaffert | first4 = C. | title = Abstraction mechanisms in CLU | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 20 | issue = 8 | year = 1977 | accessdate = <!-- 24 May 2013 --> | doi = 10.1145/359763.359789 }}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\">\nstring_chars = iter (s: string) yields (char);\n  index: int := 1;\n  limit: int := string$size (s);\n  while index <= limit do\n    yield (string$fetch(s, index));\n    index := index + 1;\n    end;\nend string_chars;\n\nfor c: char in string_chars(s) do\n   ...\nend;\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Icon===\n\nEvery expression (including loops) is a generator. The language has many generators built-in and even implements some of the logic semantics using the generator mechanism ([[logical disjunction]] or \"OR\" is done this way).\n\nPrinting squares from 0 to 20 can be achieved using a co-routine by writing:\n<pre>\n   local squares, j\n   squares := create (seq(0) ^ 2)\n   every j := |@squares do\n      if j <= 20 then\n         write(j)\n      else\n         break\n</pre>\n\nHowever, most of the time custom generators are implemented with the \"suspend\" keyword which functions exactly like the \"yield\" keyword in CLU.\n\n===C===\n\n[[C (programming language)|C]] does not have generator functions as a language construct, but, as they are a subset of [[coroutines]], it is simple to implement them using any framework that implements stackful coroutines, such as libdill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libdill.org|title=Structured Concurrency for C}}</ref>. On POSIX platforms, when the cost of [[context switching]] per iteration is not a concern, or full [[Parallel_computing|parallelism]] rather than merely [[Concurrency (computer_science)|concurrency]] is desired, a very simple generator function framework can be implemented using [[pthreads]] and [[Anonymous_pipe|pipes]].\n\n===C++===\n\nIt is possible to introduce generators into C++ using pre-processor macros. The resulting code might have aspects that are very different from native C++, but the generator syntax can be very uncluttered.<ref>http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cpp/cpp_generators.aspx</ref> The set of pre-processor macros defined in this source allow generators defined with the syntax as in the following example:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\n$generator(descent)\n{\n   int i;\n\n   // place the constructor of our generator, e.g. \n   // descent(int minv, int maxv) {...}\n   \n   // from $emit to $stop is a body of our generator:\n    \n   $emit(int) // will emit int values. Start of body of the generator.\n      for (i = 10; i > 0; --i)\n         $yield(i); // similar to yield in Python,\n                    // returns next number in [1..10], reversed.\n   $stop; // stop, end of sequence. End of body of the generator.\n};\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis can then be iterated using:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\n  descent gen;\n  for(int n; gen(n);) // \"get next\" generator invocation\n    printf(\"next number is %d\\n\", n);\n  return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nMoreover, [[C++11]] allows [[foreach loop]]s to be applied to any class that provides the <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> functions. It's then possible to write generator-like classes by defining both the iterable methods (<code>begin</code> and <code>end</code>) and the iterator methods (<code>operator!=</code>, <code>operator++</code> and <code>operator*</code>) in the same class. For example, it is possible to write the following program:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\n#include <iostream>\nint main()\n{\n    for (int i: range(10))\n    {\n        std::cout << i << std::endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA basic range implementation would look like that:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\nclass range\n{\nprivate:\n    int last;\n    int iter;\n\npublic:\n    range(int end):\n        last(end),\n        iter(0)\n    {}\n\n    // Iterable functions\n    const range& begin() const { return *this; }\n    const range& end() const { return *this; }\n\n    // Iterator functions\n    bool operator!=(const range&) const { return iter < last; }\n    void operator++() { ++iter; }\n    int operator*() const { return iter; }\n};\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Perl===\n\nPerl does not natively provide generators, but support is provided by the [https://metacpan.org/module/Coro::Generator Coro::Generator] module which uses the [https://metacpan.org/module/Coro Coro] co-routine framework.  Example usage:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"perl\">\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\n# Enable generator { BLOCK } and yield\nuse Coro::Generator;\n# Array reference to iterate over\nmy $chars = ['A'...'Z'];\n\n# New generator which can be called like a coderef.\nmy $letters = generator {\n    my $i = 0;\n    for my $letter (@$chars) {\n        # get next letter from $chars\n        yield $letter;\n    }\n};\n\n# Call the generator 15 times.\nprint $letters->(), \"\\n\" for (0..15);\n\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Tcl===\n\nIn [[Tcl]] 8.6, the generator mechanism is founded on named [[coroutine]]s.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"tcl\">\nproc generator {body} {\n    coroutine gen[incr ::disambiguator] apply {{script} {\n        # Produce the result of [generator], the name of the generator\n        yield [info coroutine]\n        # Do the generation\n        eval $script\n        # Finish the loop of the caller using a 'break' exception\n        return -code break\n    }} $body\n}\n\n# Use a simple 'for' loop to do the actual generation\nset count [generator {\n    for {set i 10} {$i <= 20} {incr i} {\n        yield $i\n    }\n}]\n\n# Pull values from the generator until it is exhausted\nwhile 1 {\n    puts [$count]\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Haskell===\n\nIn [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], with its [[lazy evaluation]] model, everything is a generator - every datum created with a [[Non-strict evaluation|non-strict]] data constructor is generated on demand. For example,\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\ncountfrom n = n : countfrom (n+1)\n\n-- Example use: printing out the integers from 10 to 20.\ntest1 = mapM_ print $ takeWhile (<= 20) $ countfrom 10\n\nprimes = 2 : 3 : nextprime 5  where\n  nextprime n | b = n : nextprime (n+2)\n              | otherwise = nextprime (n+2)\n    where b = all ((/= 0).(rem n)) $ takeWhile ((<= n).(^2)) $ tail primes\n</syntaxhighlight>\nwhere <code>(:)</code> is a non-strict list constructor, ''cons'', and <code>$</code> is just a ''\"called-with\"'' operator, used for parenthesization. This uses the standard adaptor function,\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\ntakeWhile p [] = []\ntakeWhile p (x:xs) | p x = x : takeWhile p xs\n                   | otherwise = []\n</syntaxhighlight>\nwhich re-fetches values agreeable with a predicate, and stops requesting new values as soon as a non-agreeable one is encountered. The shared storage access is used as a universal mediator in Haskell. List comprehensions can be freely used:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\ntest2 = mapM_ print $ takeWhile (<= 20) [x*x | x <- countfrom 10]\ntest3 = mapM_ print [x*x | x <- takeWhile (<= 20) $ countfrom 10]\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Racket===\n[[Racket (programming language)|Racket]] provides several related facilities for generators.  First, its for-loop forms work with ''sequences'', which are a kind of a producer:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"racket\">\n(for ([i (in-range 10 20)])\n  (printf \"i = ~s\\n\" i))\n</syntaxhighlight>\nand these sequences are also first-class values:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"racket\">\n(define 10-to-20 (in-range 10 20))\n(for ([i 10-to-20])\n  (printf \"i = ~s\\n\" i))\n</syntaxhighlight>\nSome sequences are implemented imperatively (with private state variables) and some are implemented as (possibly infinite) lazy lists.  Also, new struct definitions can have a property that specifies how they can be used as sequences.\n\nBut more directly, Racket comes with a generator library for a more traditional generator specification.  For example,\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"racket\">\n#lang racket\n(require racket/generator)\n(define (ints-from from)\n  (generator ()\n    (for ([i (in-naturals from)]) ; infinite sequence of integers from 0\n      (yield i))))\n(define g (ints-from 10))\n(list (g) (g) (g)) ; -> '(10 11 12)\n</syntaxhighlight>\nNote that the Racket core implements powerful continuation features, providing general (re-entrant) continuations that are composable, and also delimited continuations.  Using this, the generator library is implemented in Racket.\n\n===PHP===\nThe community of PHP implemented generators in PHP 5.5. Details can be found in the original [https://wiki.php.net/rfc/generators RFC about Generator].\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\nfunction fibonacci(): Generator\n{\n    $last = 0;\n    $current = 1;\n    yield 1;\n    while (true) {\n        $current = $last + $current;\n        $last = $current - $last;\n        yield $current;\n    }\n}\n\nforeach (fibonacci() as $number) {\n    echo $number, \"\\n\";\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Ruby===\nRuby supports generators (starting from version 1.9) in the form of the built-in Enumerator class.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ruby\">\n# Generator from an Enumerator object\nchars = Enumerator.new(['A', 'B', 'C', 'Z'])\n\n4.times { puts chars.next }\n\n# Generator from a block\ncount = Enumerator.new do |yielder|\n  i = 0\n  loop { yielder.yield i += 1 }\nend\n\n100.times { puts count.next }\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Java===\nJava has had a standard interface for implementing iterators since its early days, and since Java 5, the \"foreach\" construction makes it easy to loop over objects that provide the <tt>java.lang.Iterable</tt> interface. (The [[Java collections framework]] and other collections frameworks, typically provide iterators for all collections.)\n\nHowever, [[Java (programming language)|Java]] does not have generators built into the language.  This means that creating iterators is often much trickier than in languages with built-in generators, especially when the generation logic is complex. Because all state must be saved and restored every time an item is to be yielded from an iterator, it is not possible to store state in local variables or use built-in looping routines, as when generators are available; instead, all of this must be manually simulated, using object fields to hold local state and loop counters.\n\nEven simple iterators built this way tend to be significantly bulkier than those using generators, with a lot of [[boilerplate code]].\n\nThe original example above could be written in '''Java 5''' as:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\n// Iterator implemented as anonymous class.  This uses generics but doesn't need to.\nfor (int i: new Iterable<Integer>() {\n    @Override\n    public Iterator<Integer> iterator() {\n        return new Iterator<Integer>() {\n            int counter = 1;\n\n            @Override\n            public boolean hasNext() {\n                return counter <= 100;\n            }\n\n            @Override\n            public Integer next() {\n                return counter++;\n            }\n\n            @Override\n            public void remove() {\n                throw new UnsupportedOperationException();\n            }\n        };\n    }\n}) {\n    System.out.println(i);\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAn infinite Fibonacci sequence could also be written in '''Java 5''' as an Iterator:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\nIterable<Integer> fibo = new Iterable<Integer>() {\n    @Override\n    public Iterator<Integer> iterator() {\n        return new Iterator<Integer>() {\n            int a = 1, b = 2;\n\n            @Override\n            public boolean hasNext() {\n                return true;\n            }\n\n            @Override\n            public Integer next() {\n                int temp = a;\n                a = b;\n                b = a + temp;\n                return temp;\n            }\n\n            @Override\n            public void remove() {\n                throw new UnsupportedOperationException();\n            }\n        };\n    }\n};\n// this could then be used as...\nfor (int f: fibo) {\n    System.out.println(\"next Fibonacci number is \" + f);\n    if (someCondition(f)) break;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAlso an infinite Fibonacci sequence could also be written using '''Java 8''' Stream interface:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\nIntStream.generate(new IntSupplier() {\n    int a = 1, b = 2;\n\n    public int getAsInt() {\n        int temp = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = a + temp;\n        return temp;\n    }\n}).forEach(System.out::println);\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nOr get an Iterator from the '''Java 8''' super-interface BaseStream of Stream interface.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\npublic Iterable<Integer> fibonacci(int limit){\n    return IntStream.generate(new IntSupplier() {\n        int a = 1, b = 2;\n\n        public int getAsInt() {\n            int temp = a;\n            a = b;\n            b = a + temp;\n            return temp;\n        }\n    }).limit(limit).boxed()::iterator;\n}\n\n// this could then be used as...\nfor (int f: fibonacci(10)) {\n    System.out.println(f);\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===C#===\nAn example C# 2.0 generator (the <code>yield</code> is available since C# version 2.0):\nBoth of these examples utilize generics, but this is not required. yield keyword also helps in implementing custom stateful iterations over a collection as discussed in this discussion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/a/15977474 |title=What is the yield keyword used for in C#?|website=stackoverflow.com|access-date=2018-01-01}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\n// Method that takes an iterable input (possibly an array)\n// and returns all even numbers.\npublic static IEnumerable<int> GetEven(IEnumerable<int> numbers) {\n    foreach (int i in numbers) {\n        if ((i % 2) == 0) {\n            yield return i;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIt is possible to use multiple <code>yield return</code> statements and they are applied in sequence on each iteration:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\npublic class CityCollection : IEnumerable<string> {\n    public IEnumerator<string> GetEnumerator() {\n        yield return \"New York\";\n        yield return \"Paris\";\n        yield return \"London\";\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===XL===\nIn [[XL (programming language)|XL]], iterators are the basis of 'for' loops:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\">\nimport IO = XL.UI.CONSOLE\n\niterator IntegerIterator (var out Counter : integer; Low, High : integer) written Counter in Low..High is\n    Counter := Low\n    while Counter <= High loop\n        yield\n        Counter += 1\n\n// Note that I needs not be declared, because declared 'var out' in the iterator\n// An implicit declaration of I as an integer is therefore made here\nfor I in 1..5 loop\n    IO.WriteLn \"I=\", I\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===F#===\n{{further information|Sequence expression}}\n[[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]] provides generators via ''[[sequence expression]]s,'' since version 1.9.1.<ref name=\"seq\">{{cite web | url = http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/09/22/some-details-on-f-computation-expressions-aka-monadic-or-workflow-syntax.aspx | title = Some Details on F# Computation Expressions | accessdate = 2007-12-14}}</ref> These can define a sequence (lazily evaluated, sequential access) via <code>seq { ... }</code>, a list (eagerly evaluated, sequential access) via <code>[ ... ]</code> or an array (eagerly evaluated, indexed access) via <code>[| ... |]</code> that contain code that generates values.

Whenever <code>next()</code> is called on the iterator, Python resumes the frozen frame, which executes normally until the next <code>yield</code> statement is reached. The generator's frame is then frozen again, and the yielded value is returned to the caller.\n\nPEP 380 (implemented in Python 3.3) adds the <tt>yield from</tt> expression, allowing a generator to delegate part of its operations to another generator or iterable.<ref name=\"pep380\">[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0380/ PEP 380 -- Syntax for Delegating to a Subgenerator]</ref>\n\n====Generator expressions====\n\nPython has a syntax modeled on that of [[list comprehension]]s, called a generator expression that aids in the creation of generators.\nThe following extends the first example above by using a generator expression to compute squares from the <code>countfrom</code> generator function:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"python\">\nsquares = (n * n for n in countfrom(2))\n\nfor j in squares:\n    if j <= 20:\n        print(j)\n    else:\n        break\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===ECMAScript===\n\n[[ECMAScript|ECMAScript 6]] (a.k.a.

All generators are also [[iterator]]s.<ref>[https://stackoverflow.com/q/1022564 What is the difference between an Iterator and a Generator?]</ref> A generator is very similar to a function that returns an array, in that a generator has parameters, can be called, and generates a sequence of values. However, instead of building an array containing all the values and returning them all at once, a generator yields the values one at a time, which requires less memory and allows the caller to get started processing the first few values immediately.  In short, a generator ''looks like'' a function but ''behaves like'' an [[iterator]].\n\nGenerators can be implemented in terms of more expressive [[control flow]] constructs, such as [[coroutine]]s or first-class [[continuation]]s.<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Kiselyov\n| first = Oleg\n|date=January 2004\n| title = General ways to traverse collections in Scheme\n| url = http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/enumerators-callcc.html\n}}</ref> Generators, also known as semicoroutines,<ref name=\"Ralston2000\">{{cite book|author=Anthony Ralston|title=Encyclopedia of computer science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQ9LAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=11 May 2013|year=2000|publisher=Nature Pub. Group|isbn=978-1-56159-248-7}}</ref> are a special case of (and weaker than) coroutines, in that they always yield control back to the caller (when passing a value back), rather than specifying a coroutine to jump to; see [[Coroutine#Comparison with generators|comparison of coroutines with generators]].\n\n==Uses==\n\nGenerators are usually [[execution (computers)|invoked]] inside loops.<ref name=icon>The [[Icon (programming language)|Icon Programming Language]] utilizes generators to implement its goal directed evaluation. In Icon, generators can be invoked in contexts outside of the normal looping control structures.</ref>  The first time that a generator invocation is reached in a loop, an iterator [[object (computer science)|object]] is created that encapsulates the state of the generator routine at its beginning, with arguments bound to the corresponding [[parameter (computer science)|parameter]]s.  The generator's body is then executed in the context of that iterator until a special ''yield'' action is encountered; at that time, the value provided with the ''yield'' action is used as the value of the invocation expression.  The next time the same generator invocation is reached in a subsequent iteration, the execution of the generator's body is resumed after the ''yield'' action, until yet another ''yield'' action is encountered.  In addition to the ''yield'' action, execution of the generator body can also be terminated by a ''finish'' action, at which time the innermost loop enclosing the generator invocation is terminated. In more complicated situations, a generator may be used manually outside of a loop to create an iterator, which can then be used in various ways.\n\nBecause generators compute their yielded values only on demand, they are useful for representing [[Stream (computing)|streams]], such as sequences that would be expensive or impossible to compute at once. These include e.g. infinite sequences and live data streams.\n\nWhen eager evaluation is desirable (primarily when the sequence is finite, as otherwise evaluation will never terminate), one can either convert to a [[List (abstract data type)|list]], or use a parallel construction that creates a list instead of a generator. For example, in Python a generator <code>g</code> can be evaluated to a list <code>l</code> via <code>l = list(g)</code>, while in [[F Sharp programming language|F#]] the sequence expression <code>seq { ... }</code> evaluates lazily (a generator or sequence) but <code>[ ... ]</code> evaluates eagerly (a list).\n\nIn the presence of generators, loop constructs of a language \u2013 such as for and while \u2013 can be reduced into a single loop ... end loop construct; all the usual loop constructs can then be comfortably simulated by using suitable generators in the right way. For example, a ranged loop like <code>for x = 1 to 10</code> can be implemented as iteration through a generator, as in Python's <code>for x in range(1, 10)</code>. Further, <code>break</code> can be implemented as sending ''finish'' to the generator and then using <code>continue</code> in the loop.\n\n==Timeline==\n\nGenerators first appeared in [[CLU programming language|CLU]] (1975),<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Liskov\n| first = Barbara\n| authorlink = Barbara Liskov\n| date = April 1992\n| title = A History of CLU\n| url = http://www.lcs.mit.edu/publications/pubs/pdf/MIT-LCS-TR-561.pdf\n| format = pdf\n| access-date = 2006-01-05\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030917041834/http://www.lcs.mit.edu/publications/pubs/pdf/MIT-LCS-TR-561.pdf\n| archive-date = 2003-09-17\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref> were a prominent feature in the string manipulation language [[Icon (programming language)|Icon]] (1977) and are now available in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (2001),<ref name=python>\nPython Enhancement Proposals:\n[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/ PEP 255: Simple Generators],\n[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/ PEP 289: Generator Expressions],\n[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0342/ PEP 342: Coroutines via Enhanced Generators]\n</ref> [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]],<ref>\n[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9k7k7cf0.aspx yield (C# Reference)]\n</ref> [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], the later versions of ECMAScript (as of ES6/ES2015) and other languages.  In CLU and C#, generators are called ''iterators'', and in Ruby, ''enumerators''.\n\n===Lisp===\n\nThe final [[Common Lisp]] standard does not natively provide generators, yet various library implementations exist, such as [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/node347.html#SECTION003400000000000000000 SERIES] documented in CLtL2 or [https://web.archive.org/web/20110723043455/http://cliki.net/pygen pygen].\n\n===CLU===\n\nA yield statement is used to implement iterators over user-defined data abstractions.<ref name=Liskov1977>{{cite journal | citeseerx=10.1.1.112.656 | last1 = Liskov | first1 = B. | last2 = Snyder | first2 = A. | last3 = Atkinson | first3 = R. | last4 = Schaffert | first4 = C. | title = Abstraction mechanisms in CLU | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 20 | issue = 8 | year = 1977 | accessdate = <!-- 24 May 2013 --> | doi = 10.1145/359763.359789 }}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\">\nstring_chars = iter (s: string) yields (char);\n  index: int := 1;\n  limit: int := string$size (s);\n  while index <= limit do\n    yield (string$fetch(s, index));\n    index := index + 1;\n    end;\nend string_chars;\n\nfor c: char in string_chars(s) do\n   ...\nend;\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Icon===\n\nEvery expression (including loops) is a generator. The language has many generators built-in and even implements some of the logic semantics using the generator mechanism ([[logical disjunction]] or \"OR\" is done this way).\n\nPrinting squares from 0 to 20 can be achieved using a co-routine by writing:\n<pre>\n   local squares, j\n   squares := create (seq(0) ^ 2)\n   every j := |@squares do\n      if j <= 20 then\n         write(j)\n      else\n         break\n</pre>\n\nHowever, most of the time custom generators are implemented with the \"suspend\" keyword which functions exactly like the \"yield\" keyword in CLU.\n\n===C===\n\n[[C (programming language)|C]] does not have generator functions as a language construct, but, as they are a subset of [[coroutines]], it is simple to implement them using any framework that implements stackful coroutines, such as libdill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libdill.org|title=Structured Concurrency for C}}</ref>. On POSIX platforms, when the cost of [[context switching]] per iteration is not a concern, or full [[Parallel_computing|parallelism]] rather than merely [[Concurrency (computer_science)|concurrency]] is desired, a very simple generator function framework can be implemented using [[pthreads]] and [[Anonymous_pipe|pipes]].\n\n===C++===\n\nIt is possible to introduce generators into C++ using pre-processor macros. The resulting code might have aspects that are very different from native C++, but the generator syntax can be very uncluttered.<ref>http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cpp/cpp_generators.aspx</ref> The set of pre-processor macros defined in this source allow generators defined with the syntax as in the following example:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\n$generator(descent)\n{\n   int i;\n\n   // place the constructor of our generator, e.g. \n   // descent(int minv, int maxv) {...}\n   \n   // from $emit to $stop is a body of our generator:\n    \n   $emit(int) // will emit int values. Start of body of the generator.\n      for (i = 10; i > 0; --i)\n         $yield(i); // similar to yield in Python,\n                    // returns next number in [1..10], reversed.\n   $stop; // stop, end of sequence. End of body of the generator.\n};\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis can then be iterated using:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\n  descent gen;\n  for(int n; gen(n);) // \"get next\" generator invocation\n    printf(\"next number is %d\\n\", n);\n  return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nMoreover, [[C++11]] allows [[foreach loop]]s to be applied to any class that provides the <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> functions. It's then possible to write generator-like classes by defining both the iterable methods (<code>begin</code> and <code>end</code>) and the iterator methods (<code>operator!=</code>, <code>operator++</code> and <code>operator*</code>) in the same class. For example, it is possible to write the following program:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\n#include <iostream>\nint main()\n{\n    for (int i: range(10))\n    {\n        std::cout << i << std::endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA basic range implementation would look like that:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\nclass range\n{\nprivate:\n    int last;\n    int iter;\n\npublic:\n    range(int end):\n        last(end),\n        iter(0)\n    {}\n\n    // Iterable functions\n    const range& begin() const { return *this; }\n    const range& end() const { return *this; }\n\n    // Iterator functions\n    bool operator!=(const range&) const { return iter < last; }\n    void operator++() { ++iter; }\n    int operator*() const { return iter; }\n};\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Perl===\n\nPerl does not natively provide generators, but support is provided by the [https://metacpan.org/module/Coro::Generator Coro::Generator] module which uses the [https://metacpan.org/module/Coro Coro] co-routine framework.  Example usage:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"perl\">\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\n# Enable generator { BLOCK } and yield\nuse Coro::Generator;\n# Array reference to iterate over\nmy $chars = ['A'...'Z'];\n\n# New generator which can be called like a coderef.\nmy $letters = generator {\n    my $i = 0;\n    for my $letter (@$chars) {\n        # get next letter from $chars\n        yield $letter;\n    }\n};\n\n# Call the generator 15 times.\nprint $letters->(), \"\\n\" for (0..15);\n\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Tcl===\n\nIn [[Tcl]] 8.6, the generator mechanism is founded on named [[coroutine]]s.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"tcl\">\nproc generator {body} {\n    coroutine gen[incr ::disambiguator] apply {{script} {\n        # Produce the result of [generator], the name of the generator\n        yield [info coroutine]\n        # Do the generation\n        eval $script\n        # Finish the loop of the caller using a 'break' exception\n        return -code break\n    }} $body\n}\n\n# Use a simple 'for' loop to do the actual generation\nset count [generator {\n    for {set i 10} {$i <= 20} {incr i} {\n        yield $i\n    }\n}]\n\n# Pull values from the generator until it is exhausted\nwhile 1 {\n    puts [$count]\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Haskell===\n\nIn [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], with its [[lazy evaluation]] model, everything is a generator - every datum created with a [[Non-strict evaluation|non-strict]] data constructor is generated on demand. For example,\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\ncountfrom n = n : countfrom (n+1)\n\n-- Example use: printing out the integers from 10 to 20.\ntest1 = mapM_ print $ takeWhile (<= 20) $ countfrom 10\n\nprimes = 2 : 3 : nextprime 5  where\n  nextprime n | b = n : nextprime (n+2)\n              | otherwise = nextprime (n+2)\n    where b = all ((/= 0).(rem n)) $ takeWhile ((<= n).(^2)) $ tail primes\n</syntaxhighlight>\nwhere <code>(:)</code> is a non-strict list constructor, ''cons'', and <code>$</code> is just a ''\"called-with\"'' operator, used for parenthesization. This uses the standard adaptor function,\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\ntakeWhile p [] = []\ntakeWhile p (x:xs) | p x = x : takeWhile p xs\n                   | otherwise = []\n</syntaxhighlight>\nwhich re-fetches values agreeable with a predicate, and stops requesting new values as soon as a non-agreeable one is encountered. The shared storage access is used as a universal mediator in Haskell. List comprehensions can be freely used:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\ntest2 = mapM_ print $ takeWhile (<= 20) [x*x | x <- countfrom 10]\ntest3 = mapM_ print [x*x | x <- takeWhile (<= 20) $ countfrom 10]\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Racket===\n[[Racket (programming language)|Racket]] provides several related facilities for generators.  First, its for-loop forms work with ''sequences'', which are a kind of a producer:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"racket\">\n(for ([i (in-range 10 20)])\n  (printf \"i = ~s\\n\" i))\n</syntaxhighlight>\nand these sequences are also first-class values:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"racket\">\n(define 10-to-20 (in-range 10 20))\n(for ([i 10-to-20])\n  (printf \"i = ~s\\n\" i))\n</syntaxhighlight>\nSome sequences are implemented imperatively (with private state variables) and some are implemented as (possibly infinite) lazy lists.  Also, new struct definitions can have a property that specifies how they can be used as sequences.\n\nBut more directly, Racket comes with a generator library for a more traditional generator specification.  For example,\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"racket\">\n#lang racket\n(require racket/generator)\n(define (ints-from from)\n  (generator ()\n    (for ([i (in-naturals from)]) ; infinite sequence of integers from 0\n      (yield i))))\n(define g (ints-from 10))\n(list (g) (g) (g)) ; -> '(10 11 12)\n</syntaxhighlight>\nNote that the Racket core implements powerful continuation features, providing general (re-entrant) continuations that are composable, and also delimited continuations.  Using this, the generator library is implemented in Racket.\n\n===PHP===\nThe community of PHP implemented generators in PHP 5.5. Details can be found in the original [https://wiki.php.net/rfc/generators RFC about Generator].\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\nfunction fibonacci(): Generator\n{\n    $last = 0;\n    $current = 1;\n    yield 1;\n    while (true) {\n        $current = $last + $current;\n        $last = $current - $last;\n        yield $current;\n    }\n}\n\nforeach (fibonacci() as $number) {\n    echo $number, \"\\n\";\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Ruby===\nRuby supports generators (starting from version 1.9) in the form of the built-in Enumerator class.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ruby\">\n# Generator from an Enumerator object\nchars = Enumerator.new(['A', 'B', 'C', 'Z'])\n\n4.times { puts chars.next }\n\n# Generator from a block\ncount = Enumerator.new do |yielder|\n  i = 0\n  loop { yielder.yield i += 1 }\nend\n\n100.times { puts count.next }\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Java===\nJava has had a standard interface for implementing iterators since its early days, and since Java 5, the \"foreach\" construction makes it easy to loop over objects that provide the <tt>java.lang.Iterable</tt> interface. (The [[Java collections framework]] and other collections frameworks, typically provide iterators for all collections.)\n\nHowever, [[Java (programming language)|Java]] does not have generators built into the language.  This means that creating iterators is often much trickier than in languages with built-in generators, especially when the generation logic is complex. Because all state must be saved and restored every time an item is to be yielded from an iterator, it is not possible to store state in local variables or use built-in looping routines, as when generators are available; instead, all of this must be manually simulated, using object fields to hold local state and loop counters.\n\nEven simple iterators built this way tend to be significantly bulkier than those using generators, with a lot of [[boilerplate code]].\n\nThe original example above could be written in '''Java 5''' as:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\n// Iterator implemented as anonymous class.  This uses generics but doesn't need to.\nfor (int i: new Iterable<Integer>() {\n    @Override\n    public Iterator<Integer> iterator() {\n        return new Iterator<Integer>() {\n            int counter = 1;\n\n            @Override\n            public boolean hasNext() {\n                return counter <= 100;\n            }\n\n            @Override\n            public Integer next() {\n                return counter++;\n            }\n\n            @Override\n            public void remove() {\n                throw new UnsupportedOperationException();\n            }\n        };\n    }\n}) {\n    System.out.println(i);\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAn infinite Fibonacci sequence could also be written in '''Java 5''' as an Iterator:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\nIterable<Integer> fibo = new Iterable<Integer>() {\n    @Override\n    public Iterator<Integer> iterator() {\n        return new Iterator<Integer>() {\n            int a = 1, b = 2;\n\n            @Override\n            public boolean hasNext() {\n                return true;\n            }\n\n            @Override\n            public Integer next() {\n                int temp = a;\n                a = b;\n                b = a + temp;\n                return temp;\n            }\n\n            @Override\n            public void remove() {\n                throw new UnsupportedOperationException();\n            }\n        };\n    }\n};\n// this could then be used as...\nfor (int f: fibo) {\n    System.out.println(\"next Fibonacci number is \" + f);\n    if (someCondition(f)) break;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAlso an infinite Fibonacci sequence could also be written using '''Java 8''' Stream interface:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\nIntStream.generate(new IntSupplier() {\n    int a = 1, b = 2;\n\n    public int getAsInt() {\n        int temp = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = a + temp;\n        return temp;\n    }\n}).forEach(System.out::println);\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nOr get an Iterator from the '''Java 8''' super-interface BaseStream of Stream interface.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\npublic Iterable<Integer> fibonacci(int limit){\n    return IntStream.generate(new IntSupplier() {\n        int a = 1, b = 2;\n\n        public int getAsInt() {\n            int temp = a;\n            a = b;\n            b = a + temp;\n            return temp;\n        }\n    }).limit(limit).boxed()::iterator;\n}\n\n// this could then be used as...\nfor (int f: fibonacci(10)) {\n    System.out.println(f);\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===C#===\nAn example C# 2.0 generator (the <code>yield</code> is available since C# version 2.0):\nBoth of these examples utilize generics, but this is not required. yield keyword also helps in implementing custom stateful iterations over a collection as discussed in this discussion<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/a/15977474 |title=What is the yield keyword used for in C#?|website=stackoverflow.com|access-date=2018-01-01}}</ref>.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\n// Method that takes an iterable input (possibly an array)\n// and returns all even numbers.\npublic static IEnumerable<int> GetEven(IEnumerable<int> numbers) {\n    foreach (int i in numbers) {\n        if ((i % 2) == 0) {\n            yield return i;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIt is possible to use multiple <code>yield return</code> statements and they are applied in sequence on each iteration:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\npublic class CityCollection : IEnumerable<string> {\n    public IEnumerator<string> GetEnumerator() {\n        yield return \"New York\";\n        yield return \"Paris\";\n        yield return \"London\";\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===XL===\nIn [[XL (programming language)|XL]], iterators are the basis of 'for' loops:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\">\nimport IO = XL.UI.CONSOLE\n\niterator IntegerIterator (var out Counter : integer; Low, High : integer) written Counter in Low..High is\n    Counter := Low\n    while Counter <= High loop\n        yield\n        Counter += 1\n\n// Note that I needs not be declared, because declared 'var out' in the iterator\n// An implicit declaration of I as an integer is therefore made here\nfor I in 1..5 loop\n    IO.WriteLn \"I=\", I\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===F#===\n{{further information|Sequence expression}}\n[[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]] provides generators via ''[[sequence expression]]s,'' since version 1.9.1.<ref name=\"seq\">{{cite web | url = http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/09/22/some-details-on-f-computation-expressions-aka-monadic-or-workflow-syntax.aspx | title = Some Details on F# Computation Expressions | accessdate = 2007-12-14}}</ref> These can define a sequence (lazily evaluated, sequential access) via <code>seq { ... }</code>, a list (eagerly evaluated, sequential access) via <code>[ ... ]</code> or an array (eagerly evaluated, indexed access) via <code>[| ... |]</code> that contain code that generates values. For example,\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"fsharp\">\nseq { for b in 0 .. 25 do\n          if b < 15 then\n              yield b * b }\n</syntaxhighlight>\nforms a sequence of squares of numbers from 0 to 14 by filtering out numbers from the range of numbers from 0 to 25.\n\n===Python===\n\nGenerators were added to [[Python (programming language)|Python]] in version 2.2 in 2001.<ref name=\"python\"/> An example generator:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"python\">\nfrom typing import Iterator\n\ndef countfrom(n: int) -> Iterator[int]:\n    while True:\n        yield n\n        n += 1\n\n# Example use: printing out the integers from 10 to 20.\n# Note that this iteration terminates normally, despite\n# countfrom() being written as an infinite loop.\n\nfor i in countfrom(10):\n    if i <= 20:\n        print(i)\n    else:\n        break\n\n# Another generator, which produces prime numbers indefinitely as needed.\nimport itertools\n\ndef primes() -> Iterator[int]:\n    yield 2\n    n = 3\n    p = []\n    while True:\n        # If dividing n by all the numbers in p, up to and including sqrt(n),\n        # produces a non-zero remainder then n is prime.\n        if all(n % f > 0 for f in itertools.takewhile(lambda f: f*f <= n, p)):\n            yield n\n            p.append(n)\n        n += 2\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn Python, a generator can be thought of as an [[iterator]] that contains a frozen [[stack frame]]. Whenever <code>next()</code> is called on the iterator, Python resumes the frozen frame, which executes normally until the next <code>yield</code> statement is reached. The generator's frame is then frozen again, and the yielded value is returned to the caller.\n\nPEP 380 (implemented in Python 3.3) adds the <tt>yield from</tt> expression, allowing a generator to delegate part of its operations to another generator or iterable.<ref name=\"pep380\">[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0380/ PEP 380 -- Syntax for Delegating to a Subgenerator]</ref>\n\n====Generator expressions====\n\nPython has a syntax modeled on that of [[list comprehension]]s, called a generator expression that aids in the creation of generators.\nThe following extends the first example above by using a generator expression to compute squares from the <code>countfrom</code> generator function:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"python\">\nsquares = (n * n for n in countfrom(2))\n\nfor j in squares:\n    if j <= 20:\n        print(j)\n    else:\n        break\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===ECMAScript===\n\n[[ECMAScript|ECMAScript 6]] (a.k.a.

All of these engines are 12-valve cam-in-block or [[overhead valve engine]]s, except for the [[#LQ1|LQ1]]; which uses 24 valves driven by [[dual overhead cams]]. These engines vary in displacement between {{convert|2490|and|3350|cc|L|order=flip|1}} and have a cast-iron block and either cast-iron or aluminum heads. Production of these engines began in 1980 and ended in 2005 in the U.S., with production continued in China until 2010. This engine family was the basis for the [[GM High Value engine]] family. These engines have also been referred to as the '''X engines''' due to their first usage in the [[GM X platform (FWD)|X-body]] cars.\n\nThis engine is not related to the [[GMC V6 engine]] that was designed for commercial vehicle usage.\n\n==Generation I==\nThe first generation of modern small GM 60\u00b0 V6 engines featured an iron block and heads with inline valves. This \"clean sheet\" design was introduced in 1980 and versions were produced through 1995. Two different blocks with minor differences were developed:\n* A [[transverse engine]] family for [[front-wheel drive]]\n* A [[longitudinal engine]] family for [[rear-wheel drive]]\n\n===Transverse===\nThe [[transverse engine]]s began the 60\u00b0 family in 1980. Like the rest of the Generation I engines, they were updated in 1985 with larger main journals for durability, along with [[multi-point fuel injection]] or E2SE carb and [[On-board diagnostics|OBD I]]. Production of the Generation I transverse engines ended in 1986.\n\n====LE2====\nThe {{convert|2837|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} '''LE2''' was the first version of the 60\u00b0 engine. It was a transverse version produced from 1980 through 1986 for the A-body and X-body cars. The standard (\"X-code\") engine for this line, it used a two-barrel [[carburetor]]. Output was {{convert|115|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for 1980 and '81 {{convert|112|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for 1982-86 and {{convert|135|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. Bore was {{convert|89|mm|in|abbr=on}} and stroke was {{convert|76|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}.\n\nApplications:\n* 1980\u20131985 [[Buick Skylark]]\n* 1986 [[Buick Century]]\n* 1986 [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera]] & Cutlass Cruiser\n* 1980\u20131984 [[Oldsmobile Omega]]\n* 1980\u20131984 [[Pontiac Phoenix]]\n* 1980\u20131985 [[Chevrolet Citation]]\n* 1982\u20131986 [[Pontiac 6000]]\n* 1982\u20131986 [[Chevrolet Celebrity]]\n\n====LH7====\nIntroduced in 1981, the {{convert|2837|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} '''LH7''' was a High Output (\"Z-code\") version of the [[#LE2|LE2]] for the higher-performance X-cars like the [[Chevrolet Citation#X-11|Chevrolet Citation X-11]] and higher-performance A-cars like the Pontiac 6000 STE. It retained a two-barrel carburetor and produced {{convert|135|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|165|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} for 1981 and {{convert|145|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} for 1982-1984 versions. The LH7 was replaced after 1984 with the [[Multi-point fuel injection|MFI]] [[#L44|L44]].\n\nApplications:\n* 1982\u20131984 [[Buick Skylark#1980.E2.80.931985|Buick Skylark]] T-Type\n* 1982\u20131984 [[Oldsmobile Omega#1980\u20131984|Oldsmobile Omega]] SX\n* 1982\u20131984 [[Pontiac Phoenix#1980\u20131984 Front Wheel Drive|Pontiac Phoenix]] SJ\n* 1981\u20131984 [[Chevrolet Citation#X-11|Chevrolet Citation X-11]]\n* 1984      [[Chevrolet Celebrity]] (optional on first year Eurosport) \n* 1983\u20131984 [[Pontiac 6000#STE version|Pontiac 6000 STE]]\n* 1989\u20131991 [[Isuzu Trooper#First generation .281981.E2.80.931991.29|Isuzu Trooper/Trooper II]]\n\n====L44====\n[[File:1988 Fiero Formula motor.jpg|right|thumb|150px|L44 in a 1988 [[Pontiac]] [[Fiero]] Formula]]\nThe '''L44''' was produced from 1985 to 1988, replacing the LH7. It was the first transverse {{convert|2837|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} to use multiport fuel injection, and was a High Output (\"9-code\") engine option for the higher performance A-cars, X-cars, and [[Pontiac Fiero]]. This engine produced {{convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5200&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|170|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 3600&nbsp;rpm.<ref name=\"85FieroDIY\">1984 General Motors, \"Pontiac Fiero 1985 Do-It-Yourself\" Manual, pg 3-2</ref><ref name=\"86FieroDIY\">1985 General Motors, \"Pontiac Fiero 1986 Do-It-Yourself\" Manual, pg 3-2</ref><ref name=\"87FieroMan\">1986 General Motors, \"1987 Pontiac Fiero Owner's Manual\", pg 6-5</ref><ref name=\"88FieroMan\">1987 General Motors, \"1988 Pontiac Fiero Owner's Manual\", pg 6-4</ref> This engine's camshaft and cylinder heads were later reused in the [[#L32|L32]] {{convert|3350|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}}.4-L engine.\n\nApplications:\n* 1985\u20131988 [[Pontiac Fiero]]\n* 1985\u20131986 [[Pontiac 6000]] STE\n* 1985\u20131986 [[Chevrolet Celebrity]] Eurosport\n* 1985 [[Chevrolet Citation]] X-11\n\n====LB6====\nThe LB6 engine was introduced in 1985 to replace the original LE2. It used multiport fuel injection and produced {{convert|130|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nApplications:\n\n*1985\u20131986 [[Cadillac Cimarron]]\n*1985\u20131986 [[Chevrolet Cavalier]]\n*1985 [[Chevrolet Citation]]\n*1985 [[Buick Skylark]] (sedan)\n*1985-1986 [[Chevrolet Celebrity]]\n*1985-1986 [[Pontiac 6000]]\n*1985\u20131986 [[Oldsmobile Firenza]]\n\n===LG6===\nThe '''LG6''' (\"D-code\") was produced from 1990 to 1996 in both transverse and longitudinal applications. It used [[throttle-body fuel injection]] and iron heads. It produced {{convert|120|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|170|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nApplications:\n*1990\u20131995 [[Chevrolet Lumina APV]]\n*1990\u20131995 [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]]\n*1990\u20131995 [[Pontiac Trans Sport]]\n*1991\u20131994 [[Isuzu Faster|Isuzu Pickup]]\n*1991\u20131992 [[Isuzu Wizard|Isuzu Rodeo]]\n\n===Longitudinal===\nThe [[longitudinal engine|longitudinal]] versions had minor differences from the transverse engines on which they were based. This group appeared in 1982 with the [[#LC1|LC1]] and [[#LR2|LR2]] and never added the aluminum heads of the [[#Generation II|Generation II]] engines.\n\nLike the rest of the family, larger journals appeared in 1985, along with [[MPFI|multiport fuel injection]] for the [[GM F platform|F-body]] [[#LB8|LB8]] version. [[Throttle-body fuel injection|TBI]] was added for the truck version in 1986.\n\nA {{convert|3135|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} version was added in 1990 with an {{convert|8|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} longer stroke, and a {{convert|3350|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} appeared for 1993 with a {{convert|92|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} bore and [[Sequential fuel injection|SFI]]. Production of the {{convert|2837|and|3135|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} ([[Isuzu]]) engines ended in 1994. Production ended for all longitudinal 60\u00b0 V6s in 1996. GM's performance-parts division continued production of a related crate engine after 1999.\n\n====LC1====\nThe longitudinal '''LC1''' was produced from 1982 to 1984. It was a 2-barrel High Output (\"1-code\") version for the [[GM F platform|F-body]] cars. Output was {{convert|102|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|145|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. It was replaced by the [[#LB8|LB8]] for 1985.\n\nApplications:\n* 1982\u20131984 [[Chevrolet Camaro]]\n* 1982\u20131984 [[Pontiac Firebird]]\n\n====LR2====\nThe longitudinal '''LR2''' was a truck version (\"B-code\") produced from 1982 to 1990. It used a two-barrel carburetor and produced {{convert|115|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|150|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nApplications:\n* 1982\u20131986 [[Chevrolet S-10]]/[[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer]]\n* 1982\u20131986 [[GMC S-15]]/[[GMC S-15 Jimmy]]\n* 1984\u20131986 [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)#XJ (1984\u20131996)|Jeep Cherokee]]\n* 1986 [[Jeep Comanche]]\n\n====LL1/LL2====\nThe longitudinal '''LL1''' was a high-output version of the [[#LC1|LC1]] produced in 1983 and 1984. It was an optional (\"L-code\") engine on the Pontiac Firebird with {{convert|125|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. It was used in the 1983\u20131984 [[Pontiac Firebird]].\n\nThe carbureted '''LL2''' (\"R-code\") was produced from 1982 to 1988. Another LL2 (\"R-code\") with [[throttle-body fuel injection]] was produced from 1986 to 1993. Output of the TBI version was {{convert|125|hp|0|abbr=on}}.\nApplications:\n* 1986\u20131993 [[Chevrolet S-10]]/[[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer]]\n* 1986\u20131993 [[GMC S-15]]/[[GMC S-15 Jimmy]]\n* 1989\u20131991 [[Isuzu Trooper]]\n\n====LB8====\nThe '''LB8''' (\"S-code\") replaced the [[#LC1|LC1]] in 1985 and was produced until 1989. It used multiport fuel injection and was made for longitudinal mounting. Output was {{convert|135|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|165|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nApplications:\n* 1985\u20131989 [[Chevrolet Camaro]]\n* 1985\u20131989 [[Pontiac Firebird]]\n\n====LH0====\nThe LH0 as used in the rear-wheel drive applications differed significantly from that used in front-wheel drive applications. The latter retained the generation-I architecture block and heads. Output was {{convert|140|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|180|lbft|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nApplication:\n* 1990\u20131992 [[Chevrolet Camaro]]\n* 1990\u20131992 [[Pontiac Firebird]]\n* 1990-1992 [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera]] S , Iraq version\n\n====L32====\nThe power rating of the {{convert|3350|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} '''L32''' (\"S-code\") used in the Camaro and Firebird was {{convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,600&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|200|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} torque at 3600&nbsp;rpm. The [[GM F platform|F-body cars]] used the Generation I architecture, with iron heads, and without splayed valves.\n\nApplications:\n* 1993\u20131994 [[Chevrolet Camaro]] (California models)<ref name=\"en.wikipedia.org\">[[Buick V6 engine#L36 Naturally Aspirated]]</ref>\n* 1993\u20131995 [[Chevrolet Camaro]] \n* 1993\u20131994 [[Pontiac Firebird]] (California models)<ref name=\"en.wikipedia.org\"/>\n* 1993\u20131995 [[Pontiac Firebird]]\n\n==Generation II==\nThe second generation, still {{convert|2837|cc|L|order=flip|1}}, was introduced in 1987. It used aluminum heads with splayed valves and an aluminum front cover. It was produced exclusively for transverse, front-wheel drive use.\n\nThe next year, Chevrolet introduced a full-production long-stroke {{convert|3135|cc|L CID|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} version in the [[Pontiac 6000]] STE AWD, with a{{convert|89|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} bore and {{convert|84|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} stroke compared to the 2.8 which shared the same bore, however with a {{convert|76|mm|2|abbr=on}} in stroke. It was produced simultaneously with the {{convert|2837|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} in various compact and midsized vehicles until 1990, when the {{convert|2837|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} was dropped.

The engine was built only for front-wheel drive applications, and was featured exclusively in the first generation of [[GM W platform|GM's W-body platform]].\n\nIt was built from 1991 to 1997. From 1991 to 1993, it used tuned multiport fuel injection, made {{convert|200-210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5200&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|215|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4000&nbsp;rpm.

In 1996, the heads were redesigned for better flow, as well as now making the engine an interference design and adapting the engine for federally mandated OBDII emissions. Output for the 1996-1997 LQ1 is {{convert|215|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|220|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. It had four valves per cylinder. The {{convert|3350|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} engine substituted the standard camshaft for a chain driven intermediate shaft, which drives four overhead cams via a cogged belt. Adapting the 60\u00b0pushrod block for the LQ1's overhead cams significantly increased packaged engine height.\n\nBore was increased to {{convert|92|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and the {{convert|3135|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} engine's {{convert|84|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} stroke was retained. Only a few interchangeable parts are use between this DOHC engine and other members of the 60\u00b0 family, primarily the connecting rods and crankshaft.\n\nThe heads and intake manifolds were redesigned for the 1996 model year, incorporating a larger throttle body and plenum area, slightly longer intake runners, cloverleaf combustion chambers, and larger \"pill\"-shaped exhaust ports. Camshafts and cam timing were also revised for the new, higher-rpm powerband.\n\nOptional from 1991 to 1993 was a [[Getrag]] 284 five-speed manual [[transaxle]], which was also exclusive to the [[GM W platform]] and was available only with the LQ1. The electronically controlled [[Hydramatic]] [[GM 4T60-E transmission|4T60-E]] four-speed automatic [[transaxle]] was the alternative, used during the entire production run with the exception of the 1997 Monte Carlo Z34 and 1997 Lumina LTZ, which received the 4T65-E.\n\nApplications:\n* 1991\u20131994 [[Chevrolet Lumina]] Z34 and the Euro 3.4 sedan\n* 1991\u20131996 [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]]\n* 1991\u20131996 [[Pontiac Grand Prix]]\n* 1995\u20131997 [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] Z34\n* 1995\u20131996 [[Chevrolet Lumina]] LS\n\n==Generation III==\nThe third generation of the 60\u00b0 engine was introduced in the 1993 [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]].<ref name=\"LA1specs\" /> Like its predecessors, it continued to use an [[overhead valve]] configuration with two valves per cylinder, a [[cast-iron]] [[cylinder block]], [[aluminum]] [[cylinder head]]s, and an aluminum [[intake manifold]].<ref name=\"LA1specs\" /> However, the heads and intake manifold were redesigned for better air flow{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}, the cylinder block was stiffened{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}, and the [[tappet|flat-tappet]]s of the generation I and II engines were replaced with [[tappet|roller tappet]]s.<ref name=\"LA1specs\" /> This generation also came standard with sequential multiport fuel injection<ref name=\"LA1specs\" /> and [[structural]] [[oil pan]].<ref name=\"LA1specs\" />\n\n===3.1 L/3100===\n\n====L82====\nThe '''L82''' (\"M-code\") was an updated, SFI replacement for the MPFI [[#LH0|LH0]], produced from 1993 through 1999.

All of these engines are 12-valve cam-in-block or [[overhead valve engine]]s, except for the [[#LQ1|LQ1]]; which uses 24 valves driven by [[dual overhead cams]]. These engines vary in displacement between {{convert|2490|and|3350|cc|L|order=flip|1}} and have a cast-iron block and either cast-iron or aluminum heads. Production of these engines began in 1980 and ended in 2005 in the U.S., with production continued in China until 2010. This engine family was the basis for the [[GM High Value engine]] family. These engines have also been referred to as the '''X engines''' due to their first usage in the [[GM X platform (FWD)|X-body]] cars.\n\nThis engine is not related to the [[GMC V6 engine]] that was designed for commercial vehicle usage.\n\n==Generation I==\nThe first generation of modern small GM 60\u00b0 V6 engines featured an iron block and heads with inline valves. This \"clean sheet\" design was introduced in 1980 and versions were produced through 1995. Two different blocks with minor differences were developed:\n* A [[transverse engine]] family for [[front-wheel drive]]\n* A [[longitudinal engine]] family for [[rear-wheel drive]]\n\n===Transverse===\nThe [[transverse engine]]s began the 60\u00b0 family in 1980. Like the rest of the Generation I engines, they were updated in 1985 with larger main journals for durability, along with [[multi-point fuel injection]] or E2SE carb and [[On-board diagnostics|OBD I]]. Production of the Generation I transverse engines ended in 1986.\n\n====LE2====\nThe {{convert|2837|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} '''LE2''' was the first version of the 60\u00b0 engine. It was a transverse version produced from 1980 through 1986 for the A-body and X-body cars. The standard (\"X-code\") engine for this line, it used a two-barrel [[carburetor]]. Output was {{convert|115|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for 1980 and '81 {{convert|112|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for 1982-86 and {{convert|135|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. Bore was {{convert|89|mm|in|abbr=on}} and stroke was {{convert|76|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}.\n\nApplications:\n* 1980\u20131985 [[Buick Skylark]]\n* 1986 [[Buick Century]]\n* 1986 [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera]] & Cutlass Cruiser\n* 1980\u20131984 [[Oldsmobile Omega]]\n* 1980\u20131984 [[Pontiac Phoenix]]\n* 1980\u20131985 [[Chevrolet Citation]]\n* 1982\u20131986 [[Pontiac 6000]]\n* 1982\u20131986 [[Chevrolet Celebrity]]\n\n====LH7====\nIntroduced in 1981, the {{convert|2837|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} '''LH7''' was a High Output (\"Z-code\") version of the [[#LE2|LE2]] for the higher-performance X-cars like the [[Chevrolet Citation#X-11|Chevrolet Citation X-11]] and higher-performance A-cars like the Pontiac 6000 STE. It retained a two-barrel carburetor and produced {{convert|135|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|165|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} for 1981 and {{convert|145|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} for 1982-1984 versions.

This group appeared in 1982 with the [[#LC1|LC1]] and [[#LR2|LR2]] and never added the aluminum heads of the [[#Generation II|Generation II]] engines.\n\nLike the rest of the family, larger journals appeared in 1985, along with [[MPFI|multiport fuel injection]] for the [[GM F platform|F-body]] [[#LB8|LB8]] version. [[Throttle-body fuel injection|TBI]] was added for the truck version in 1986.\n\nA {{convert|3135|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} version was added in 1990 with an {{convert|8|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} longer stroke, and a {{convert|3350|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} appeared for 1993 with a {{convert|92|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} bore and [[Sequential fuel injection|SFI]]. Production of the {{convert|2837|and|3135|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} ([[Isuzu]]) engines ended in 1994. Production ended for all longitudinal 60\u00b0 V6s in 1996. GM's performance-parts division continued production of a related crate engine after 1999.\n\n====LC1====\nThe longitudinal '''LC1''' was produced from 1982 to 1984. It was a 2-barrel High Output (\"1-code\") version for the [[GM F platform|F-body]] cars. Output was {{convert|102|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|145|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}.

It was an optional (\"L-code\") engine on the Pontiac Firebird with {{convert|125|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. It was used in the 1983\u20131984 [[Pontiac Firebird]].\n\nThe carbureted '''LL2''' (\"R-code\") was produced from 1982 to 1988. Another LL2 (\"R-code\") with [[throttle-body fuel injection]] was produced from 1986 to 1993.

It used aluminum heads with splayed valves and an aluminum front cover. It was produced exclusively for transverse, front-wheel drive use.\n\nThe next year, Chevrolet introduced a full-production long-stroke {{convert|3135|cc|L CID|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} version in the [[Pontiac 6000]] STE AWD, with a{{convert|89|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} bore and {{convert|84|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} stroke compared to the 2.8 which shared the same bore, however with a {{convert|76|mm|2|abbr=on}} in stroke. It was produced simultaneously with the {{convert|2837|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} in various compact and midsized vehicles until 1990, when the {{convert|2837|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} was dropped. MPFI was used on both, and a full-production turbo version was available on the {{convert|3135|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}}. An even higher displacement [[DOHC]] {{convert|3350|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} [[#LQ1|LQ1]] was also developed, and eventually, the new [[GM High Value engine]] family followed. Production of OHV Generation II engines ended in 1994 after the introduction of the [[#Generation III|Generation III]] in 1993.\n\nThe {{convert|2837|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} 60\u00b0 V6 was used in these vehicles:\n* 1988\u20131989 [[Buick Regal]]\n* 1987\u20131989 [[Chevrolet Beretta]]\n* 1987\u20131989 [[Chevrolet Cavalier]] Z24\n* 1990\u20131994 Mexican [[Chevrolet Cavalier]]\n* 1987\u20131989 [[Chevrolet Corsica]]\n* 1987\u20131989 [[Pontiac 6000]]\n* 1988\u20131989 [[Pontiac Grand Prix]]\n* 1987\u20131989 [[Chevrolet Celebrity]]\n* 1987\u20131989 [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera]]\n* 1987\u20131989 [[Buick Century]]\n* 1988-1989 [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]]\n\n[[File:2.8L Regal.JPG|thumb|Generation 2, 2.8 L 60\u00b0 V6 in a Buick Regal|320 px]]\n\nThe {{convert|3135|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} 60\u00b0 V6 was used in these vehicles:\n* 1994\u20132005 [[Buick Century]]\n* 1989\u20131996 [[Buick Regal]]\n* 1994\u20131998 [[Buick Skylark]]\n* 1990\u20131996 [[Chevrolet Beretta]]\n* 1990\u20131994 [[Chevrolet Cavalier]]\n* 1990 [[Chevrolet Celebrity]]\n* 1990\u20131996 [[Chevrolet Corsica]]\n* 1994\u20131998 [[Oldsmobile Achieva]]\n* 1989\u20131997 [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]]\n* 1994\u20131996 [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera]]\n* 1988\u20131991 [[Pontiac 6000]] (STE & LE, but primarily for STE)\n* 1994\u20131998 [[Pontiac Grand Am]]\n* 1989\u20132003 [[Pontiac Grand Prix]]\n* 1991\u20131994 [[Pontiac Sunbird]]\n[[File:GM 60deg 3.1LMPFI eng ChevBeretta.jpg|thumb|A 3.1-L engine in a 1990 Chevrolet Beretta]]\n\n===LH0===\nThe '''LH0''' (\"T-code\") was introduced in 1988 on the Pontiac 6000 STE AWD.

This engine had a block with more nickel content and hardened internals.\n\nApplications:\n*1989\u20131990 [[Pontiac Grand Prix]] Turbo\n*1990 [[Pontiac Grand Prix]] Turbo STE\n\n===LQ1===\n[[File:GM 60 Degree V6 engine Generation II LQ.jpg|thumb|right|3.4 L 60\u00b0 [[DOHC]] V6 (LQ1)]]\n\nThe '''LQ1''' (also called the '''Twin Dual Cam''' or '''TDC''') was a {{convert|3350|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} DOHC V6 engine (\"X-code\") based on the aluminum-headed second generation of GM's 60\u00b0 engine line, sharing a similar block with its [[pushrod]] cousins, the 3.1&nbsp;L [[#LH0|LH0]] V6 and the then recently retired {{convert|2837|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} [[#LB6|LB6]] V6. The engine was built only for front-wheel drive applications, and was featured exclusively in the first generation of [[GM W platform|GM's W-body platform]].\n\nIt was built from 1991 to 1997. From 1991 to 1993, it used tuned multiport fuel injection, made {{convert|200-210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5200&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|215|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4000&nbsp;rpm. From 1994 to 1997, it used sequential port fuel injection, making {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5200&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|215|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4000&nbsp;rpm. In 1996, the heads were redesigned for better flow, as well as now making the engine an interference design and adapting the engine for federally mandated OBDII emissions. Output for the 1996-1997 LQ1 is {{convert|215|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|220|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. It had four valves per cylinder. The {{convert|3350|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} engine substituted the standard camshaft for a chain driven intermediate shaft, which drives four overhead cams via a cogged belt. Adapting the 60\u00b0pushrod block for the LQ1's overhead cams significantly increased packaged engine height.\n\nBore was increased to {{convert|92|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and the {{convert|3135|cc|L|abbr=on|order=flip|1}} engine's {{convert|84|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} stroke was retained. Only a few interchangeable parts are use between this DOHC engine and other members of the 60\u00b0 family, primarily the connecting rods and crankshaft.\n\nThe heads and intake manifolds were redesigned for the 1996 model year, incorporating a larger throttle body and plenum area, slightly longer intake runners, cloverleaf combustion chambers, and larger \"pill\"-shaped exhaust ports. Camshafts and cam timing were also revised for the new, higher-rpm powerband.\n\nOptional from 1991 to 1993 was a [[Getrag]] 284 five-speed manual [[transaxle]], which was also exclusive to the [[GM W platform]] and was available only with the LQ1. The electronically controlled [[Hydramatic]] [[GM 4T60-E transmission|4T60-E]] four-speed automatic [[transaxle]] was the alternative, used during the entire production run with the exception of the 1997 Monte Carlo Z34 and 1997 Lumina LTZ, which received the 4T65-E.\n\nApplications:\n* 1991\u20131994 [[Chevrolet Lumina]] Z34 and the Euro 3.4 sedan\n* 1991\u20131996 [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]]\n* 1991\u20131996 [[Pontiac Grand Prix]]\n* 1995\u20131997 [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] Z34\n* 1995\u20131996 [[Chevrolet Lumina]] LS\n\n==Generation III==\nThe third generation of the 60\u00b0 engine was introduced in the 1993 [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]].<ref name=\"LA1specs\" /> Like its predecessors, it continued to use an [[overhead valve]] configuration with two valves per cylinder, a [[cast-iron]] [[cylinder block]], [[aluminum]] [[cylinder head]]s, and an aluminum [[intake manifold]].<ref name=\"LA1specs\" /> However, the heads and intake manifold were redesigned for better air flow{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}, the cylinder block was stiffened{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}, and the [[tappet|flat-tappet]]s of the generation I and II engines were replaced with [[tappet|roller tappet]]s.<ref name=\"LA1specs\" /> This generation also came standard with sequential multiport fuel injection<ref name=\"LA1specs\" /> and [[structural]] [[oil pan]].<ref name=\"LA1specs\" />\n\n===3.1 L/3100===\n\n====L82====\nThe '''L82''' (\"M-code\") was an updated, SFI replacement for the MPFI [[#LH0|LH0]], produced from 1993 through 1999.

He developed his own driving-rhythm boogie style, distinct from the 1930s\u20131940s piano-derived [[boogie-woogie]].

Most sources give 1917, though at times Hooker stated he was born in 1920.  Information in the 1920 and 1930 censuses indicates that he was born in 1912.<ref name=\"bare\"/>  In 2017, a series of events took place to celebrate the purported centenary of his birth.<ref>Brian McCollum, [http://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/05/01/john-lee-hooker-100th-centennial-tribute-grammy/101027412 \"John Lee Hooker to get year-long 100th birthday tribute\"], ''Detroit Free Press'', May 1, 2017.</ref> In the 1920 federal census, John Hooker is seven years old and one of nine children living with William and Minnie Hooker in Tutwiler Mississippi.\n\nIt is believed that he was born in [[Tutwiler, Mississippi]], in Tallahatchie County, although some sources say his birthplace was near [[Clarksdale, Mississippi|Clarksdale]], in Coahoma County.<ref name=\"palmer\"/> He was the youngest of the 11 children of William Hooker (born 1871, died after 1923),<ref>According to ''Boogie Man'', p. 24, \"In 1928, Will Hooker Sr. and Jr. made a profit of twenty-eight dollars\" from farming, making his death in 1923 impossible.</ref> a [[sharecropper]] and Baptist preacher, and Minnie Ramsey (born c. 1880, date of death unknown).

She was said to have been a \"decade or so younger\" than her husband (''Boogie Man'', p.&nbsp;23), which gives additional credibility to this census record as evidence of Hooker's origins.\n\nThe Hooker children were [[Homeschooling|homeschooled]]. They were permitted to listen only to religious songs; the [[spirituals]] sung in church were their earliest exposure to music. In 1921, their parents separated. The next year, their mother married William Moore, a blues singer, who provided John Lee with an introduction to the guitar (and whom he would later credit for his distinctive playing style).<ref>Oliver, Paul. ''Conversation with the Blues''. p. 188. See also Bennett, Joe; Curwen, Trevor; Douse, Cliff. ''Guitar Facts''. p. 76.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nMoore was his first significant blues influence. He was a local blues guitarist who, in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], learned to play a droning, one-chord blues that was strikingly different from the [[Delta blues]] of the time.<ref name=\"palmer\">{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Palmer|year=1982|title=Deep Blues|publisher=Penguin Books|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/242 242\u201343]|isbn=0-14-006223-8|url=https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/242}}</ref>\n\nAnother influence was [[Tony Hollins]], who dated Hooker's sister Alice, helped teach Hooker to play, and gave him his first guitar. For the rest of his life, Hooker regarded Hollins as a formative influence on his style of playing and his career as a musician. Among the songs that Hollins reputedly taught Hooker were versions of \"[[Crawlin' King Snake]]\" and \"[[Robert Petway#Catfish Blues|Catfish Blues]]\".<ref>Murray, Charles Shaar (2011).

He frequented the blues clubs and bars on [[Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects|Hastings Street]], the heart of the black entertainment district, on Detroit's east side. In a city noted for its pianists, guitar players were scarce. Hooker's popularity grew quickly as he performed in Detroit clubs, and, seeking an instrument louder than his acoustic guitar, he bought his first electric guitar.<ref name=\"oliver\">{{cite book|first=Terry|last=Wogan|year=1984|title=Shoes Off the Record|edition=|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bluesoffrecordth00oliv/page/116 116\u201318]|isbn=0-306-80321-6|url=https://archive.org/details/bluesoffrecordth00oliv/page/116}}</ref>\n\n==Earlier career==\nHooker was working as janitor in a Detroit steel mill when his recording career began in 1948,<ref>{{cite book|title=Deep Blues|author=Robert Palmer|authorlink=Robert Palmer (writer)|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/242 242]|isbn=978-0-14-006223-6|url=https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/242}}</ref> when [[Modern Records]], based in Los Angeles, released a demo he had recorded for Bernie Besman in Detroit.<ref>{{cite book|title=Deep Blues|author=Robert Palmer|authorlink=Robert Palmer (writer)|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/243 243]|isbn=978-0-14-006223-6|url=https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/243}}</ref> The single, \"[[Boogie Chillen']]{{-\"}}, became a hit and the best-selling [[race record]] of 1949.<ref name=\"palmer\"/> Despite being illiterate, Hooker was a prolific lyricist. In addition to adapting [[traditional blues verses|traditional blues lyrics]], he composed original songs. In the 1950s, like many black musicians, Hooker earned little from record sales, and so he often recorded variations of his songs for different studios for an up-front fee. To evade his recording contract, he used various pseudonyms, including John Lee Booker (for [[Chess Records]] and [[Chance Records]] in 1951\u20131952), Johnny Lee (for [[De Luxe Records]] in 1953\u20131954), John Lee, John Lee Cooker,<ref>Liner notes.

This often made it difficult to use backing musicians, who were not accustomed to Hooker's musical vagaries. As a result, Besman recorded Hooker playing guitar, singing and stomping on a wooden pallet in time with the music.<ref>''Boogie Man'', p. 121.</ref>\n\nFor much of this period he recorded and toured with [[Eddie Kirkland]].

Information in the 1920 and 1930 censuses indicates that he was born in 1912.<ref name=\"bare\"/>  In 2017, a series of events took place to celebrate the purported centenary of his birth.<ref>Brian McCollum, [http://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/05/01/john-lee-hooker-100th-centennial-tribute-grammy/101027412 \"John Lee Hooker to get year-long 100th birthday tribute\"], ''Detroit Free Press'', May 1, 2017.</ref> In the 1920 federal census, John Hooker is seven years old and one of nine children living with William and Minnie Hooker in Tutwiler Mississippi.\n\nIt is believed that he was born in [[Tutwiler, Mississippi]], in Tallahatchie County, although some sources say his birthplace was near [[Clarksdale, Mississippi|Clarksdale]], in Coahoma County.<ref name=\"palmer\"/> He was the youngest of the 11 children of William Hooker (born 1871, died after 1923),<ref>According to ''Boogie Man'', p. 24, \"In 1928, Will Hooker Sr. and Jr. made a profit of twenty-eight dollars\" from farming, making his death in 1923 impossible.</ref> a [[sharecropper]] and Baptist preacher, and Minnie Ramsey (born c. 1880, date of death unknown).

She was said to have been a \"decade or so younger\" than her husband (''Boogie Man'', p.&nbsp;23), which gives additional credibility to this census record as evidence of Hooker's origins.\n\nThe Hooker children were [[Homeschooling|homeschooled]]. They were permitted to listen only to religious songs; the [[spirituals]] sung in church were their earliest exposure to music. In 1921, their parents separated. The next year, their mother married William Moore, a blues singer, who provided John Lee with an introduction to the guitar (and whom he would later credit for his distinctive playing style).<ref>Oliver, Paul.

He was a local blues guitarist who, in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], learned to play a droning, one-chord blues that was strikingly different from the [[Delta blues]] of the time.<ref name=\"palmer\">{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Palmer|year=1982|title=Deep Blues|publisher=Penguin Books|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/242 242\u201343]|isbn=0-14-006223-8|url=https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/242}}</ref>\n\nAnother influence was [[Tony Hollins]], who dated Hooker's sister Alice, helped teach Hooker to play, and gave him his first guitar. For the rest of his life, Hooker regarded Hollins as a formative influence on his style of playing and his career as a musician. Among the songs that Hollins reputedly taught Hooker were versions of \"[[Crawlin' King Snake]]\" and \"[[Robert Petway#Catfish Blues|Catfish Blues]]\".<ref>Murray, Charles Shaar (2011).

He frequented the blues clubs and bars on [[Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects|Hastings Street]], the heart of the black entertainment district, on Detroit's east side. In a city noted for its pianists, guitar players were scarce.

In addition to adapting [[traditional blues verses|traditional blues lyrics]], he composed original songs. In the 1950s, like many black musicians, Hooker earned little from record sales, and so he often recorded variations of his songs for different studios for an up-front fee. To evade his recording contract, he used various pseudonyms, including John Lee Booker (for [[Chess Records]] and [[Chance Records]] in 1951\u20131952), Johnny Lee (for [[De Luxe Records]] in 1953\u20131954), John Lee, John Lee Cooker,<ref>Liner notes.

This often made it difficult to use backing musicians, who were not accustomed to Hooker's musical vagaries. As a result, Besman recorded Hooker playing guitar, singing and stomping on a wooden pallet in time with the music.<ref>''Boogie Man'', p. 121.</ref>\n\nFor much of this period he recorded and toured with [[Eddie Kirkland]].

{"title_page": "General MIDI", "text_new": "{{short description|Standardized specification for music synthesizers adopting the MIDI protocol}}\n{{About|the electronic musical instrument specification|the British DJ|General Midi (DJ)}}\n\n'''General MIDI''' (also known as '''GM''' or '''GM 1''') is a [[Specification (technical standard)|standardized specification]] for [[electronic musical instrument]]s that respond to [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] messages. GM was developed by the American [[MIDI Manufacturers Association]] (MMA) and the [[Japan MIDI Standards Committee]] (JMSC) and first published in 1991. The official specification is available in English from the MMA, bound together with the MIDI 1.0 specification, and in Japanese from the Association of Musical Electronic Industry (AMEI).\n\nGM imposes several requirements beyond the more abstract MIDI 1.0 specification. While MIDI 1.0 by itself provides a [[communications protocol]] which ensures that different instruments can interoperate at a fundamental level (e.g., that pressing keys on a MIDI keyboard will cause an attached MIDI sound module to play musical notes), GM goes further in two ways: it requires that all GM-compatible instruments meet a certain minimal set of features, such as being able to play at least 24 [[Musical note|note]]s simultaneously ([[Polyphony (instrument)|polyphony]]), and it attaches specific interpretations to many parameters and control messages which were left unspecified in the MIDI 1.0 spec, such as defining instrument sounds for each of the 128 possible program numbers.\n\nGM ensures that playback of MIDI files sounds consistently between different devices compliant with the GM specification. Instrument selection in MIDI is done by assigning a \"Program Number\": this assignment previously was arbitrary, while a specific instrument is attributed to each program number with GM.\n\nThe GM 1 specification was superseded by General MIDI 2 in 1999; however, GM 1 is still commonly used.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.midi.org/specifications-old/item/general-midi|title=General MIDI (GM 1)|website=www.midi.org|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref>\n\n== General MIDI 1 Requirements ==\nTo be GM 1 compatible, sound generating devices (keyboards, hardware or software synthesizers, sound cards) are required to meet the General MIDI System Level 1 performance specification:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Criterion\n!Requirement\n|-\n|Voices\n|Allow 24 voices to be available simultaneously for both melodic and percussive sounds (alternatively, allow 16 melodic and 8 percussive voices). All voices respond to note velocity.\n|-\n|Channels\n|Support all 16 channels simultaneously, each assignable to different instruments. Channel 10 is reserved for percussion. Support polyphony (multiple simultaneous notes) on each channel.\n|-\n|Instruments\n|Support a minimum of 128 MIDI Program Numbers (conforming to the GM 1 Instrument Patch Map) and 47 percussion sounds (conforming to the GM 1 Percussion Key Map).\n|-\n|Channel messages\n|Support for controller number 1, 7, 10, 11, 64, 100, 101, 121 and 123; support for channel pressure and pitch bend controllers.\n|-\n|Other messages\n|Respond to the data entry controller and the RPNs for fine and coarse tuning and pitch bend range, as well as all General MIDI Level 1 System Messages.\n|}\n\n==Parameter interpretations==\nGM Instruments must also obey the following conventions for program and controller events:\n\n===Program change events===\nIn MIDI, the instrument sound or \"program\" for each of the 16 possible MIDI channels is selected with the Program Change message, which has a Program Number parameter. The following table shows which instrument sound corresponds to each of the 128 possible Program Numbers '''for GM only'''. There are 128 program numbers. The numbers can be displayed as values 1 to 128, or, alternatively, as 0 to 127. The 0 to 127 numbering is usually only used internally by the synthesizer; the vast majority of MIDI devices, [[digital audio workstation]]s and professional [[Music sequencer|MIDI sequencers]] display these Program Numbers as shown in the table (1\u2013128).\n\n{{div col |colwidth=15em}}\n====[[Piano]]====\n*1   [[Grand piano|Acoustic Grand Piano]]\n*2   [[Piano|Bright Acoustic Piano]]\n*3

GM was developed by the American [[MIDI Manufacturers Association]] (MMA) and the [[Japan MIDI Standards Committee]] (JMSC) and first published in 1991. The official specification is available in English from the MMA, bound together with the MIDI 1.0 specification, and in Japanese from the Association of Musical Electronic Industry (AMEI).\n\nGM imposes several requirements beyond the more abstract MIDI 1.0 specification. While MIDI 1.0 by itself provides a [[communications protocol]] which ensures that different instruments can interoperate at a fundamental level (e.g., that pressing keys on a MIDI keyboard will cause an attached MIDI sound module to play musical notes), GM goes further in two ways: it requires that all GM-compatible instruments meet a certain minimal set of features, such as being able to play at least 24 [[Musical note|note]]s simultaneously ([[Polyphony (instrument)|polyphony]]), and it attaches specific interpretations to many parameters and control messages which were left unspecified in the MIDI 1.0 spec, such as defining instrument sounds for each of the 128 possible program numbers.\n\nGM ensures that playback of MIDI files sounds consistently between different devices compliant with the GM specification. Instrument selection in MIDI is done by assigning a \"Program Number\": this assignment previously was arbitrary, while a specific instrument is attributed to each program number with GM.\n\nThe GM 1 specification was superseded by General MIDI 2 in 1999; however, GM 1 is still commonly used.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.midi.org/specifications-old/item/general-midi|title=General MIDI (GM 1)|website=www.midi.org|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref>\n\n== General MIDI 1 Requirements ==\nTo be GM 1 compatible, sound generating devices (keyboards, hardware or software synthesizers, sound cards) are required to meet the General MIDI System Level 1 performance specification:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Criterion\n!Requirement\n|-\n|Voices\n|Allow 24 voices to be available simultaneously for both melodic and percussive sounds (alternatively, allow 16 melodic and 8 percussive voices).

The following table shows which instrument sound corresponds to each of the 128 possible Program Numbers '''for GM only'''. There are 128 program numbers. The numbers can be displayed as values 1 to 128, or, alternatively, as 0 to 127. The 0 to 127 numbering is usually only used internally by the synthesizer; the vast majority of MIDI devices, [[digital audio workstation]]s and professional [[Music sequencer|MIDI sequencers]]

While both maps are a collection of [[genetic markers]] and gene loci,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aguilera-Galvez |first1=C. |last2=Champouret |first2=N. |last3=Rietman |first3=H. |last4=Lin |first4=X. |last5=Wouters |first5=D. |last6=Chu |first6=Z. |last7=Jones |first7=J.D.G. |last8=Vossen |first8=J.H. |last9=Visser |first9=R.G.F. |last10=Wolters |first10=P.J. |last11=Vleeshouwers |first11=V.G.A.A. |title=Two different R gene loci co-evolved with Avr2 of Phytophthora infestans and confer distinct resistance specificities in potato |journal=Studies in Mycology |volume=89 |pages=105\u2013115 |doi=10.1016/j.simyco.2018.01.002 |pmid=29910517 |pmc=6002340 |ref=In Leading women in fungal biology, Studies in Mycology March 2018 89:105-115|year=2018 }}</ref> genetic maps' distances are based on the genetic linkage information, while physical maps use actual physical distances usually measured in number of base pairs. While the physical map could be a more \"accurate\" representation of the genome, genetic maps often offer insights into the nature of different regions of the chromosome, e.g. the genetic distance to physical distance ratio varies greatly at different genomic regions which reflects different recombination rates, and such rate is often indicative of euchromatic (usually gene-rich) vs heterochromatic (usually gene poor) regions of the genome.\n\n===Gene mapping===\nResearchers begin a genetic map by collecting samples of blood., saliva, or tissue from family members that carry a prominent disease or trait and family members that don't. The most common sample used in gene mapping, especially in personal genomic tests is saliva. Scientists then isolate DNA from the samples and closely examine it, looking for unique patterns in the DNA of the family members who do carry the disease that the DNA of those who don't carry the disease don't have. These unique molecular patterns in the DNA are referred to as polymorphisms, or markers.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.genome.gov/10000715 |title = Genetic Mapping Fact Sheet}}</ref>\n\nThe first steps of building a genetic map are the development of [[genetic marker]]s and a mapping population. The closer two markers are on the chromosome, the more likely they are to be passed on to the next generation together. Therefore, the \"co-segregation\" patterns of all markers can be used to reconstruct their order. With this in mind, the genotypes of each genetic marker are recorded for both parents and each individual in the following generations. The quality of the genetic maps is largely dependent upon these factors: the number of genetic markers on the map and the size of the mapping population. The two factors are interlinked, as a larger mapping population could increase the \"resolution\" of the map and prevent the map from being \"saturated\".\n\nIn gene mapping, any sequence feature that can be faithfully distinguished from the two parents can be used as a genetic marker. Genes, in this regard, are represented by \"traits\" that can be faithfully distinguished between two parents. Their linkage with other genetic markers is calculated in the same way as if they are common markers and the actual gene loci are then bracketed in a region between the two nearest neighboring markers. The entire process is then repeated by looking at more markers that target that region to map the gene neighborhood to a higher resolution until a specific causative locus can be identified. This process is often referred to as \"[[positional cloning]]\", and it is used extensively in the study of plant species. One plant species, in particular in which positional cloning is utilized is in [[Maize|maize]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gallvetti |first1=Andrea |last2=Whipple |first2=Clinton J. |title=Positional cloning in maize (Zea mays subsp. mays, Poaceae) |journal=Applications in Plant Sciences |date=2015 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1400092 |doi=10.3732/apps.1400092|pmid=25606355 |pmc=4298233 }}</ref> The great advantage of genetic mapping is that it can identify the relative position of genes based solely on their phenotypic effect.\n\nGenetic mapping is a way to identify exactly which chromosome has which gene and exactly pinpointing where that gene lies on that particular chromosome.

A centimorgan is a distance between genes for which one product of meiosis in one hundred is recombinant. The further two genes are from each other, the more likely they are going to recombine. If it were closer, the opposite would occur.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Physical mapping===\nSince actual base-pair distances are generally hard or impossible to directly measure, physical maps are actually constructed by first shattering the genome into hierarchically smaller pieces. By characterizing each single piece and assembling back together, the overlapping path or \"tiling path\" of these small fragments would allow researchers to infer physical distances between genomic features. The fragmentation of the genome can be achieved by [[restriction enzyme]] cutting or by physically shattering the genome by processes like sonication.

Now a good choice of clones can be made to efficiently sequence the clones to determine the DNA sequence of the organism under study.\n\nIn physical mapping, there are no direct ways of marking up a specific gene since the mapping does not include any information that concerns traits and functions. Genetic markers can be linked to a physical map by processes like [[in situ hybridization]]. By this approach, physical map contigs can be \"anchored\" onto a genetic map.
