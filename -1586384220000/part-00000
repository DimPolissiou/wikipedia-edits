Neutrons and protons, both nucleons, are affected by the nuclear force almost identically. Since protons have charge +1&nbsp;''e'', they experience an [[Coulomb's law|electric force]] that tends to push them apart, but at short range the attractive nuclear force is strong enough to overcome the electromagnetic force.  The nuclear force binds nucleons into [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]].\n\nThe nuclear force is powerfully [[wikt:attraction|attractive]] between nucleons at distances of about 1&nbsp;[[femtometre]] (fm, or 1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221215</sup> [[metre]]s), but it rapidly decreases to insignificance at distances beyond about 2.5&nbsp;fm. At distances less than 0.7&nbsp;fm, the nuclear force becomes repulsive. This repulsive component is responsible for the physical size of nuclei, since the nucleons can come no closer than the force allows. By comparison, the size of an atom, measured in [[angstrom]]s (\u00c5, or 1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221210</sup> m), is five orders of magnitude larger. The nuclear force is not simple, however, since it depends on the nucleon spins, has a tensor component, and may depend on the relative momentum of the nucleons.<ref name=\"Krane\">{{cite book | author=Kenneth S. Krane | title=Introductory Nuclear Physics | year= 1988 | location= | publisher=Wiley & Sons | isbn=0-471-80553-X}}</ref>\n\nThe nuclear force plays an essential role in storing energy that is used in [[nuclear power]] and [[nuclear weapons]].  [[Work (physics)|Work (energy)]] is required to bring charged protons together against their electric repulsion.  This energy is stored when the protons and neutrons are bound together by the nuclear force to form a nucleus.  The mass of a nucleus is less than the sum total of the individual masses of the protons and neutrons.  The difference in masses is known as the [[mass defect]], which can be expressed as an energy equivalent. Energy is released when a heavy nucleus breaks apart into two or more lighter nuclei.  This energy is the electromagnetic potential energy that is released when the nuclear force no longer holds the charged nuclear fragments together.<ref>[http://www.furryelephant.com/content/radioactivity/binding-energy-mass-defect/ Binding Energy, Mass Defect], Furry Elephant physics educational site, retr 2012 7 1</ref><ref>[http://mragheb.com/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Nuclear%20Processes%20The%20Strong%20Force.pdf Chapter 4 NUCLEAR PROCESSES, THE STRONG FORCE], M. Ragheb 1/30/2013, University of Illinois</ref>\n\nA quantitative description of the nuclear force relies on equations that are partly [[empirical research|empirical]].  These equations model the internucleon potential energies, or potentials. (Generally, forces within a system of particles can be more simply modeled by describing the system's potential energy; the negative gradient of a [[scalar potential|potential]] is equal to the vector force.) The constants for the equations are phenomenological, that is, determined by fitting the equations to experimental data. The internucleon potentials attempt to describe the properties of nucleon\u2013nucleon interaction. Once determined, any given potential can be used in, e.g., the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] to determine the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] properties of the nucleon system.\n\nThe [[discovery of the neutron]] in 1932, revealed that atomic nuclei were made of protons and neutrons, held together by an attractive force. By 1935 the nuclear force was conceived to be transmitted by particles called [[meson]]s. This theoretical development included a description of the [[Yukawa potential]], an early example of a nuclear potential. [[Pion]]s, fulfilling the prediction, were discovered experimentally in 1947. By the 1970s, the [[quark model]] had been developed, by which the mesons and nucleons were viewed as composed of quarks and gluons. By this new model, the nuclear force, resulting from the exchange of mesons between neighboring nucleons, is a residual effect of the strong force.\n\n==Description==\nWhile the nuclear force is usually associated with nucleons, more generally this force is felt between [[hadron]]s, or particles composed of [[quark]]s. At small separations between nucleons (less than ~ 0.7&nbsp;fm between their centers, depending upon spin alignment) the force becomes repulsive, which keeps the nucleons at a certain average separation. For identical nucleons (such as two neutrons or two protons) this repulsion arises from the [[Pauli exclusion principle|Pauli exclusion]] force. A Pauli repulsion also occurs between quarks of the same [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]] from different nucleons (a proton and a neutron).\n\n===Field strength===\nAt distances larger than 0.7&nbsp;fm the force becomes attractive between spin-aligned nucleons, becoming maximal at a center\u2013center distance of about 0.9&nbsp;fm. Beyond this distance the force drops exponentially, until beyond about 2.0&nbsp;fm separation, the force is negligible. Nucleons have a radius of about 0.8&nbsp;fm.<ref name=\"Povh\">{{cite book | last1=Povh | first1=B.| last2=Rith| first2=K.| last3=Scholz| first3=C.| last4=Zetsche| first4=F. |title=Particles and Nuclei: An Introduction to the Physical Concepts | location=Berlin | publisher=Springer-Verlag |pages=73| year=2002 | isbn=978-3-540-43823-6}}</ref>\n\nAt short distances (less than 1.7&nbsp;fm or so), the attractive nuclear force is stronger than the repulsive [[Coulomb force]] between protons; it thus overcomes the repulsion of protons within the nucleus. However, the Coulomb force between protons has a much greater range as it varies as the inverse square of the charge separation, and Coulomb repulsion thus becomes the only significant force between protons when their separation exceeds about 2 to 2.5&nbsp;fm.\n\nThe nuclear force has a spin-dependent component. The force is stronger for particles with their spins aligned than for those with their spins anti-aligned. If two particles are the same, such as two neutrons or two protons, the force is not enough to bind the particles, since the spin vectors of two particles of the same type must point in opposite directions when the particles are near each other and are (save for spin) in the same quantum state. This requirement for [[fermion]]s stems from the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. For fermion particles of different types, such as a proton and neutron, particles may be close to each other and have aligned spins without violating the Pauli exclusion principle, and the nuclear force may bind them (in this case, into a [[deuteron]]), since the nuclear force is much stronger for spin-aligned particles. But if the particles' spins are anti-aligned the nuclear force is too weak to bind them, even if they are of different types.\n\nThe nuclear force also has a tensor component which depends on the interaction between the nucleon spins and the angular momentum of the nucleons, leading to deformation from a simple spherical shape.\n\n===Nuclear binding===\nTo disassemble a nucleus into unbound protons and neutrons requires work against the nuclear force. Conversely, energy is released when a nucleus is created from free nucleons or other nuclei: the [[nuclear binding energy]]. Because of [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]] (i.e. Einstein's formula {{nowrap|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}), releasing this energy causes the mass of the nucleus to be lower than the total mass of the individual nucleons, leading to the so-called \"mass defect\".<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Stern\n  | first = Dr. Swapnil Nikam\n  | title = Nuclear Binding Energy\n  | work = \"From Stargazers to Starships\"\n  | publisher = NASA website\n  | date = February 11, 2009\n  | url = http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/SnucEnerA-2.htm\n  | accessdate = 2010-12-30}}</ref>\n\nThe nuclear force is nearly independent of whether the nucleons are neutrons or protons. This property is called ''charge independence''. The force depends on whether the [[spin (physics)|spins]] of the nucleons are parallel or antiparallel, as it has a non-central or ''[[tensor]]'' component. This part of the force does not conserve orbital [[angular momentum]], which under the action of [[central forces]] is conserved.\n\nThe symmetry resulting in the strong force, proposed by [[Werner Heisenberg]], is that protons and neutrons are identical in every respect, other than their charge. This is not completely true, because neutrons are a tiny bit heavier, but it is an approximate symmetry. Protons and neutrons are therefore viewed as the same particle, but with different [[isospin]] quantum numbers; conventionally, the proton is ''isospin up,'' while the neutron is ''isospin down''. The strong force is invariant under SU(2) isospin transformations, just as other interactions between particles are invariant under SU(2) transformations of [[Spin (physics)|intrinsic spin]]. In other words, both isospin and intrinsic spin transformations are [[Group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[Representation theory of SU(2)|SU(2) symmetry group.]] There are only strong attractions when the total isospin of the set of interacting particles is 0, which is confirmed by experiment.<ref>Griffiths, David, Introduction to Elementary Particles</ref>\n\nOur understanding of the nuclear force is obtained by scattering experiments and the binding energy of light nuclei.\n\n[[File:pn scatter pi0.svg|thumb|300px|A [[Feynman diagram]] of a strong [[proton]]\u2013[[neutron]] interaction mediated by a neutral [[pion]]. Time proceeds from left to right.]]\nThe nuclear force occurs by the exchange of virtual light [[meson]]s, such as the virtual [[pion]]s, as well as two types of virtual mesons with spin ([[vector meson]]s), the [[rho meson]]s and the [[omega meson]]s. The vector mesons account for the spin-dependence of the nuclear force in this \"virtual meson\" picture.\n\nThe nuclear force is distinct from what historically was known as the [[weak nuclear force]]. The [[weak interaction]] is one of the four [[fundamental interactions]], and plays a role in processes such as [[beta decay]]. The weak force plays no role in the interaction of nucleons, though it is responsible for the decay of neutrons to protons and vice versa.\n\n==History==\nThe nuclear force has been at the heart of [[nuclear physics]] ever since the field was born in 1932 with the discovery of the [[neutron]] by [[James Chadwick]]. The traditional goal of nuclear physics is to understand the properties of [[atomic nuclei]] in terms of the 'bare' interaction between pairs of nucleons, or nucleon\u2013nucleon forces (NN forces).\n\nWithin months after the discovery of the neutron, [[Werner Heisenberg]]<ref>{{cite journal |last=Heisenberg |first=W. |title=\u00dcber den Bau der Atomkerne.

He considered protons and neutrons to be different quantum states of the same particle, i.e., nucleons distinguished by the value of their nuclear [[isospin]] quantum numbers.\n\nOne of the earliest models for the nucleus was the [[Semi-empirical mass formula#The liquid drop model and its analysis|liquid drop model]] developed in the 1930s. One property of nuclei is that the average binding energy per nucleon is approximately the same for all stable nuclei, which is similar to a liquid drop. The liquid drop model treated the nucleus as a drop of incompressible nuclear fluid, with nucleons behaving like molecules in a liquid. The model was first proposed by [[George Gamow]] and then developed by [[Niels Bohr]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], and [[Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker]]. This crude model did not explain all the properties of the nucleus, but it did explain the spherical shape of most nuclei. The model also gave good predictions for the binding energy of nuclei.\n\nIn 1934, [[Hideki Yukawa]] made the earliest attempt to explain the nature of the nuclear force. According to his theory, massive [[boson]]s ([[meson]]s) mediate the interaction between two nucleons. In light of [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD)\u2014and, by extension, the [[Standard Model]]\u2014meson theory is no longer perceived as fundamental. But the meson-exchange concept (where [[hadron]]s are treated as [[elementary particles]]) continues to represent the best working model for a quantitative ''NN'' potential. The Yukawa potential (also called a screened [[Coulomb potential]]) is a potential of the form\n\n:<math>V_\\text{Yukawa}(r)= -g^2\\frac{e^{-\\mu r}}{r},</math>\n\nwhere ''g'' is a magnitude scaling constant, i.e., the amplitude of potential, <math>\\mu</math> is the Yukawa particle mass, ''r'' is the radial distance to the particle. The potential is [[Monotonic function|monotone increasing]], [[Force#Potential energy|implying]] that the force is always attractive. The constants are determined empirically. The Yukawa potential depends only on the distance between particles, ''r'', hence it models a [[central force]].\n\nThroughout the 1930s a group at [[Columbia University]] led by [[I. I. Rabi]] developed magnetic resonance techniques to determine the magnetic moments of nuclei. These measurements led to the discovery in 1939 that the [[deuteron]] also possessed an [[quadrupole|electric quadrupole moment]].<ref name=\"Rigden\">{{cite book | author=[[John S.

The deuteron, composed of a proton and a neutron, is one of the simplest nuclear systems. The discovery meant that the physical shape of the deuteron was not symmetric, which provided valuable insight into the nature of the nuclear force binding nucleons. In particular, the result showed that the nuclear force was not a [[central force]], but had a tensor character.<ref name=\"Reid\"/> [[Hans Bethe]] identified the discovery of the deuteron's quadrupole moment as one of the important events during the formative years of nuclear physics.<ref name=\"Rigden\"/>\n\nHistorically, the task of describing the nuclear force phenomenologically was formidable. The first semi-empirical quantitative models came in the mid-1950s,<ref name=\"Reid\"/> such as the [[Woods\u2013Saxon potential]] (1954).

The strong interaction is the attractive force that binds the elementary particles called [[quark]]s together to form the nucleons (protons and neutrons) themselves. This more powerful force, one of the [[fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]] of nature, is mediated by particles called [[gluon]]s. Gluons hold quarks together through [[color charge]] which is analogous to electric charge, but far stronger. Quarks, gluons, and their dynamics are mostly confined within nucleons, but residual influences extend slightly beyond nucleon boundaries to give rise to the nuclear force.\n\nThe nuclear forces arising between nucleons are analogous to the forces in chemistry between neutral atoms or molecules called [[London force]]s. Such forces between atoms are much weaker than the attractive electrical forces that hold the atoms themselves together (i.e., that bind electrons to the nucleus), and their range between atoms is shorter, because they arise from small separation of charges inside the neutral atom. Similarly, even though nucleons are made of quarks in combinations which cancel most gluon forces (they are \"color neutral\"), some combinations of quarks and gluons nevertheless leak away from nucleons, in the form of short-range nuclear force fields that extend from one nucleon to another nearby nucleon. These nuclear forces are very weak compared to direct gluon forces (\"color forces\" or [[strong force]]s) inside nucleons, and the nuclear forces extend only over a few nuclear diameters, falling exponentially with distance. Nevertheless, they are strong enough to bind neutrons and protons over short distances, and overcome the electrical repulsion between protons in the nucleus.\n\nSometimes, the nuclear force is called the '''residual strong force''', in contrast to the [[strong interaction]]s which arise from QCD. This phrasing arose during the 1970s when QCD was being established. Before that time, the ''strong nuclear force'' referred to the inter-nucleon potential. After the verification of the [[quark model]], ''strong interaction'' has come to mean QCD.\n\n==Nucleon\u2013nucleon potentials==\nTwo-nucleon systems such as the [[deuteron]], the nucleus of a deuterium atom, as well as proton\u2013proton or neutron\u2013proton scattering are ideal for studying the ''NN'' force. Such systems can be described by attributing a ''[[potential]]'' (such as the [[Yukawa potential]]) to the nucleons and using the potentials in a [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]. The form of the potential is derived phenomenologically (by measurement), although for the long-range interaction, meson-exchange theories help to construct the potential. The parameters of the potential are determined by fitting to [[Nuclear data|experimental data]] such as the deuteron binding energy or ''NN'' [[elastic scattering]] [[cross section (physics)|cross sections]] (or, equivalently in this context, so-called ''NN'' phase shifts).\n\nThe most widely used ''NN'' potentials are the [[Paris potential]], the [[Argonne AV18 potential]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wiringa |first1=R.B. |last2=Stoks |first2=V.G.J. |last3=Schiavilla |first3=R. |title=Accurate nucleon\u2013nucleon potential with charge-independence breaking |journal=Physical Review C |volume=51 |page=38 |year=1995 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.51.38 |bibcode=1995PhRvC..51...38W |arxiv=nucl-th/9408016}}</ref> the [[CD-Bonn potential]] and the [[Nijmegen potentials]].\n\nA more recent approach is to develop [[effective field theory|effective field theories]] for a consistent description of nucleon\u2013nucleon and three-nucleon forces. [[Quantum hadrodynamics]] is an effective field theory of the nuclear force, comparable to QCD for color interactions and [[quantum electrodynamics|QED]] for electromagnetic interactions. Additionally, [[chiral symmetry breaking]] can be analyzed in terms of an effective field theory (called [[chiral perturbation theory]]) which allows [[perturbation theory|perturbative calculations]] of the interactions between nucleons with pions as exchange particles.\n\n===From nucleons to nuclei===\nThe ultimate goal of [[nuclear physics]] would be to describe all [[Nuclear reaction|nuclear interactions]] from the basic interactions between nucleons. This is called the ''microscopic'' or [[ab initio methods (nuclear physics)|''ab initio'']] approach of nuclear physics. There are two major obstacles to overcome:\n\n*Calculations in [[many-body system]]s are difficult and require advanced computation techniques.\n*There is evidence that [[Three-body force|three-nucleon force]]s (and possibly higher multi-particle interactions) play a significant role. This means that three-nucleon potentials must be included into the model.\nThis is an active area of research with ongoing advances in computational techniques leading to better first-principles calculations of the [[nuclear shell]] structure. Two- and three-nucleon potentials have been implemented for nuclides up to ''[[mass number|A]]''&nbsp;=&nbsp;12.\n\n===Nuclear potentials===\nA successful way of describing nuclear interactions is to construct one potential for the whole nucleus instead of considering all its nucleon components. This is called the ''macroscopic'' approach. For example, scattering of neutrons from nuclei can be described by considering a plane wave in the potential of the nucleus, which comprises a real part and an imaginary part. This model is often called the optical model since it resembles the case of light scattered by an opaque glass sphere.\n\nNuclear potentials can be ''local'' or ''global'': local potentials are limited to a narrow energy range and/or a narrow nuclear mass range, while global potentials, which have more parameters and are usually less accurate, are functions of the energy and the nuclear mass and can therefore be used in a wider range of applications.\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal-inline|Physics}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Gerald Edward Brown and A.

Neutrons and protons, both nucleons, are affected by the nuclear force almost identically. Since protons have charge +1&nbsp;''e'', they experience an [[Coulomb's law|electric force]] that tends to push them apart, but at short range the attractive nuclear force is strong enough to overcome the electromagnetic force.  The nuclear force binds nucleons into [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]].\n\nThe nuclear force is powerfully [[wikt:attraction|attractive]] between nucleons at distances of about 1&nbsp;[[femtometre]] (fm, or 1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221215</sup> [[metre]]s), but it rapidly decreases to insignificance at distances beyond about 2.5&nbsp;fm. At distances less than 0.7&nbsp;fm, the nuclear force becomes repulsive. This repulsive component is responsible for the physical size of nuclei, since the nucleons can come no closer than the force allows. By comparison, the size of an atom, measured in [[angstrom]]s (\u00c5, or 1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221210</sup> m), is five orders of magnitude larger. The nuclear force is not simple, however, since it depends on the nucleon spins, has a tensor component, and may depend on the relative momentum of the nucleons.<ref name=\"Krane\">{{cite book | author=Kenneth S.

[[Work (physics)|Work (energy)]] is required to bring charged protons together against their electric repulsion.  This energy is stored when the protons and neutrons are bound together by the nuclear force to form a nucleus.  The mass of a nucleus is less than the sum total of the individual masses of the protons and neutrons.  The difference in masses is known as the [[mass defect]], which can be expressed as an energy equivalent. Energy is released when a heavy nucleus breaks apart into two or more lighter nuclei.  This energy is the electromagnetic potential energy that is released when the nuclear force no longer holds the charged nuclear fragments together.<ref>[http://www.furryelephant.com/content/radioactivity/binding-energy-mass-defect/ Binding Energy, Mass Defect], Furry Elephant physics educational site, retr 2012 7 1</ref><ref>[http://mragheb.com/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Nuclear%20Processes%20The%20Strong%20Force.pdf Chapter 4 NUCLEAR PROCESSES, THE STRONG FORCE], M. Ragheb 1/30/2013, University of Illinois</ref>\n\nA quantitative description of the nuclear force relies on equations that are partly [[empirical research|empirical]].  These equations model the internucleon potential energies, or potentials. (Generally, forces within a system of particles can be more simply modeled by describing the system's potential energy; the negative gradient of a [[scalar potential|potential]] is equal to the vector force.) The constants for the equations are phenomenological, that is, determined by fitting the equations to experimental data. The internucleon potentials attempt to describe the properties of nucleon\u2013nucleon interaction. Once determined, any given potential can be used in, e.g., the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] to determine the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] properties of the nucleon system.\n\nThe [[discovery of the neutron]] in 1932 revealed that atomic nuclei were made of protons and neutrons, held together by an attractive force. By 1935 the nuclear force was conceived to be transmitted by particles called [[meson]]s. This theoretical development included a description of the [[Yukawa potential]], an early example of a nuclear potential. [[Pion]]s, fulfilling the prediction, were discovered experimentally in 1947. By the 1970s, the [[quark model]] had been developed, by which the mesons and nucleons were viewed as composed of quarks and gluons. By this new model, the nuclear force, resulting from the exchange of mesons between neighboring nucleons, is a residual effect of the strong force.\n\n==Description==\nWhile the nuclear force is usually associated with nucleons, more generally this force is felt between [[hadron]]s, or particles composed of [[quark]]s. At small separations between nucleons (less than ~ 0.7&nbsp;fm between their centers, depending upon spin alignment) the force becomes repulsive, which keeps the nucleons at a certain average separation. For identical nucleons (such as two neutrons or two protons) this repulsion arises from the [[Pauli exclusion principle|Pauli exclusion]] force. A Pauli repulsion also occurs between quarks of the same [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]] from different nucleons (a proton and a neutron).\n\n===Field strength===\nAt distances larger than 0.7&nbsp;fm the force becomes attractive between spin-aligned nucleons, becoming maximal at a center\u2013center distance of about 0.9&nbsp;fm. Beyond this distance the force drops exponentially, until beyond about 2.0&nbsp;fm separation, the force is negligible. Nucleons have a radius of about 0.8&nbsp;fm.<ref name=\"Povh\">{{cite book | last1=Povh | first1=B.| last2=Rith| first2=K.| last3=Scholz| first3=C.| last4=Zetsche| first4=F. |title=Particles and Nuclei: An Introduction to the Physical Concepts | location=Berlin | publisher=Springer-Verlag |pages=73| year=2002 | isbn=978-3-540-43823-6}}</ref>\n\nAt short distances (less than 1.7&nbsp;fm or so), the attractive nuclear force is stronger than the repulsive [[Coulomb force]] between protons; it thus overcomes the repulsion of protons within the nucleus. However, the Coulomb force between protons has a much greater range as it varies as the inverse square of the charge separation, and Coulomb repulsion thus becomes the only significant force between protons when their separation exceeds about 2 to 2.5&nbsp;fm.\n\nThe nuclear force has a spin-dependent component. The force is stronger for particles with their spins aligned than for those with their spins anti-aligned. If two particles are the same, such as two neutrons or two protons, the force is not enough to bind the particles, since the spin vectors of two particles of the same type must point in opposite directions when the particles are near each other and are (save for spin) in the same quantum state. This requirement for [[fermion]]s stems from the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. For fermion particles of different types, such as a proton and neutron, particles may be close to each other and have aligned spins without violating the Pauli exclusion principle, and the nuclear force may bind them (in this case, into a [[deuteron]]), since the nuclear force is much stronger for spin-aligned particles. But if the particles' spins are anti-aligned the nuclear force is too weak to bind them, even if they are of different types.\n\nThe nuclear force also has a tensor component which depends on the interaction between the nucleon spins and the angular momentum of the nucleons, leading to deformation from a simple spherical shape.\n\n===Nuclear binding===\nTo disassemble a nucleus into unbound protons and neutrons requires work against the nuclear force. Conversely, energy is released when a nucleus is created from free nucleons or other nuclei: the [[nuclear binding energy]]. Because of [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]] (i.e. Einstein's formula {{nowrap|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}), releasing this energy causes the mass of the nucleus to be lower than the total mass of the individual nucleons, leading to the so-called \"mass defect\".<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Stern\n  | first = Dr. Swapnil Nikam\n  | title = Nuclear Binding Energy\n  | work = \"From Stargazers to Starships\"\n  | publisher = NASA website\n  | date = February 11, 2009\n  | url = http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/SnucEnerA-2.htm\n  | accessdate = 2010-12-30}}</ref>\n\nThe nuclear force is nearly independent of whether the nucleons are neutrons or protons. This property is called ''charge independence''. The force depends on whether the [[spin (physics)|spins]] of the nucleons are parallel or antiparallel, as it has a non-central or ''[[tensor]]'' component. This part of the force does not conserve orbital [[angular momentum]], which under the action of [[central forces]] is conserved.\n\nThe symmetry resulting in the strong force, proposed by [[Werner Heisenberg]], is that protons and neutrons are identical in every respect, other than their charge. This is not completely true, because neutrons are a tiny bit heavier, but it is an approximate symmetry. Protons and neutrons are therefore viewed as the same particle, but with different [[isospin]] quantum numbers; conventionally, the proton is ''isospin up,'' while the neutron is ''isospin down''. The strong force is invariant under SU(2) isospin transformations, just as other interactions between particles are invariant under SU(2) transformations of [[Spin (physics)|intrinsic spin]]. In other words, both isospin and intrinsic spin transformations are [[Group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[Representation theory of SU(2)|SU(2) symmetry group.]] There are only strong attractions when the total isospin of the set of interacting particles is 0, which is confirmed by experiment.<ref>Griffiths, David, Introduction to Elementary Particles</ref>\n\nOur understanding of the nuclear force is obtained by scattering experiments and the binding energy of light nuclei.\n\n[[File:pn scatter pi0.svg|thumb|300px|A [[Feynman diagram]] of a strong [[proton]]\u2013[[neutron]] interaction mediated by a neutral [[pion]]. Time proceeds from left to right.]]\nThe nuclear force occurs by the exchange of virtual light [[meson]]s, such as the virtual [[pion]]s, as well as two types of virtual mesons with spin ([[vector meson]]s), the [[rho meson]]s and the [[omega meson]]s. The vector mesons account for the spin-dependence of the nuclear force in this \"virtual meson\" picture.\n\nThe nuclear force is distinct from what historically was known as the [[weak nuclear force]]. The [[weak interaction]] is one of the four [[fundamental interactions]], and plays a role in processes such as [[beta decay]]. The weak force plays no role in the interaction of nucleons, though it is responsible for the decay of neutrons to protons and vice versa.\n\n==History==\nThe nuclear force has been at the heart of [[nuclear physics]] ever since the field was born in 1932 with the discovery of the [[neutron]] by [[James Chadwick]]. The traditional goal of nuclear physics is to understand the properties of [[atomic nuclei]] in terms of the 'bare' interaction between pairs of nucleons, or nucleon\u2013nucleon forces (NN forces).\n\nWithin months after the discovery of the neutron, [[Werner Heisenberg]]<ref>{{cite journal |last=Heisenberg |first=W. |title=\u00dcber den Bau der Atomkerne.

He considered protons and neutrons to be different quantum states of the same particle, i.e., nucleons distinguished by the value of their nuclear [[isospin]] quantum numbers.\n\nOne of the earliest models for the nucleus was the [[Semi-empirical mass formula#The liquid drop model and its analysis|liquid drop model]] developed in the 1930s. One property of nuclei is that the average binding energy per nucleon is approximately the same for all stable nuclei, which is similar to a liquid drop. The liquid drop model treated the nucleus as a drop of incompressible nuclear fluid, with nucleons behaving like molecules in a liquid. The model was first proposed by [[George Gamow]] and then developed by [[Niels Bohr]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], and [[Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker]]. This crude model did not explain all the properties of the nucleus, but it did explain the spherical shape of most nuclei. The model also gave good predictions for the binding energy of nuclei.\n\nIn 1934, [[Hideki Yukawa]] made the earliest attempt to explain the nature of the nuclear force. According to his theory, massive [[boson]]s ([[meson]]s) mediate the interaction between two nucleons. In light of [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD)\u2014and, by extension, the [[Standard Model]]\u2014meson theory is no longer perceived as fundamental. But the meson-exchange concept (where [[hadron]]s are treated as [[elementary particles]]) continues to represent the best working model for a quantitative ''NN'' potential. The Yukawa potential (also called a screened [[Coulomb potential]]) is a potential of the form\n\n:<math>V_\\text{Yukawa}(r)= -g^2\\frac{e^{-\\mu r}}{r},</math>\n\nwhere ''g'' is a magnitude scaling constant, i.e., the amplitude of potential, <math>\\mu</math> is the Yukawa particle mass, ''r'' is the radial distance to the particle. The potential is [[Monotonic function|monotone increasing]], [[Force#Potential energy|implying]] that the force is always attractive. The constants are determined empirically. The Yukawa potential depends only on the distance between particles, ''r'', hence it models a [[central force]].\n\nThroughout the 1930s a group at [[Columbia University]] led by [[I. I. Rabi]] developed magnetic resonance techniques to determine the magnetic moments of nuclei. These measurements led to the discovery in 1939 that the [[deuteron]] also possessed an [[quadrupole|electric quadrupole moment]].<ref name=\"Rigden\">{{cite book | author=[[John S.

The strong interaction is the attractive force that binds the elementary particles called [[quark]]s together to form the nucleons (protons and neutrons) themselves. This more powerful force, one of the [[fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]] of nature, is mediated by particles called [[gluon]]s. Gluons hold quarks together through [[color charge]] which is analogous to electric charge, but far stronger. Quarks, gluons, and their dynamics are mostly confined within nucleons, but residual influences extend slightly beyond nucleon boundaries to give rise to the nuclear force.\n\nThe nuclear forces arising between nucleons are analogous to the forces in chemistry between neutral atoms or molecules called [[London force]]s. Such forces between atoms are much weaker than the attractive electrical forces that hold the atoms themselves together (i.e., that bind electrons to the nucleus), and their range between atoms is shorter, because they arise from small separation of charges inside the neutral atom. Similarly, even though nucleons are made of quarks in combinations which cancel most gluon forces (they are \"color neutral\"), some combinations of quarks and gluons nevertheless leak away from nucleons, in the form of short-range nuclear force fields that extend from one nucleon to another nearby nucleon. These nuclear forces are very weak compared to direct gluon forces (\"color forces\" or [[strong force]]s) inside nucleons, and the nuclear forces extend only over a few nuclear diameters, falling exponentially with distance. Nevertheless, they are strong enough to bind neutrons and protons over short distances, and overcome the electrical repulsion between protons in the nucleus.\n\nSometimes, the nuclear force is called the '''residual strong force''', in contrast to the [[strong interaction]]s which arise from QCD. This phrasing arose during the 1970s when QCD was being established. Before that time, the ''strong nuclear force'' referred to the inter-nucleon potential. After the verification of the [[quark model]], ''strong interaction'' has come to mean QCD.\n\n==Nucleon\u2013nucleon potentials==\nTwo-nucleon systems such as the [[deuteron]], the nucleus of a deuterium atom, as well as proton\u2013proton or neutron\u2013proton scattering are ideal for studying the ''NN'' force. Such systems can be described by attributing a ''[[potential]]'' (such as the [[Yukawa potential]]) to the nucleons and using the potentials in a [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]. The form of the potential is derived phenomenologically (by measurement), although for the long-range interaction, meson-exchange theories help to construct the potential. The parameters of the potential are determined by fitting to [[Nuclear data|experimental data]] such as the deuteron binding energy or ''NN'' [[elastic scattering]] [[cross section (physics)|cross sections]] (or, equivalently in this context, so-called ''NN'' phase shifts).\n\nThe most widely used ''NN'' potentials are the [[Paris potential]], the [[Argonne AV18 potential]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wiringa |first1=R.B. |last2=Stoks |first2=V.G.J. |last3=Schiavilla |first3=R. |title=Accurate nucleon\u2013nucleon potential with charge-independence breaking |journal=Physical Review C |volume=51 |page=38 |year=1995 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.51.38 |bibcode=1995PhRvC..51...38W |arxiv=nucl-th/9408016}}</ref> the [[CD-Bonn potential]] and the [[Nijmegen potentials]].\n\nA more recent approach is to develop [[effective field theory|effective field theories]] for a consistent description of nucleon\u2013nucleon and three-nucleon forces. [[Quantum hadrodynamics]] is an effective field theory of the nuclear force, comparable to QCD for color interactions and [[quantum electrodynamics|QED]] for electromagnetic interactions. Additionally, [[chiral symmetry breaking]] can be analyzed in terms of an effective field theory (called [[chiral perturbation theory]]) which allows [[perturbation theory|perturbative calculations]] of the interactions between nucleons with pions as exchange particles.\n\n===From nucleons to nuclei===\nThe ultimate goal of [[nuclear physics]] would be to describe all [[Nuclear reaction|nuclear interactions]] from the basic interactions between nucleons. This is called the ''microscopic'' or [[ab initio methods (nuclear physics)|''ab initio'']] approach of nuclear physics. There are two major obstacles to overcome:\n\n*Calculations in [[many-body system]]s are difficult and require advanced computation techniques.\n*There is evidence that [[Three-body force|three-nucleon force]]s (and possibly higher multi-particle interactions) play a significant role. This means that three-nucleon potentials must be included into the model.\nThis is an active area of research with ongoing advances in computational techniques leading to better first-principles calculations of the [[nuclear shell]] structure. Two- and three-nucleon potentials have been implemented for nuclides up to ''[[mass number|A]]''&nbsp;=&nbsp;12.\n\n===Nuclear potentials===\nA successful way of describing nuclear interactions is to construct one potential for the whole nucleus instead of considering all its nucleon components. This is called the ''macroscopic'' approach. For example, scattering of neutrons from nuclei can be described by considering a plane wave in the potential of the nucleus, which comprises a real part and an imaginary part. This model is often called the optical model since it resembles the case of light scattered by an opaque glass sphere.\n\nNuclear potentials can be ''local'' or ''global'': local potentials are limited to a narrow energy range and/or a narrow nuclear mass range, while global potentials, which have more parameters and are usually less accurate, are functions of the energy and the nuclear mass and can therefore be used in a wider range of applications.\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal-inline|Physics}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Gerald Edward Brown and A.

It is the 11th in [[the Cadfael Chronicles]], published in 1985.\n\nThe siege of Winchester sends monks streaming across England seeking safe haven. Two arrive at Shrewsbury Abbey. A young man seeks out the older of the two monks, wanting his approval to marry a young woman once meant for another, and she cannot be found. His quest begins.\n\n==Plot introduction==\n\nNews comes slowly to the Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul from the battles in the south between the imprisoned [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]] and the [[Empress Matilda|Empress Maud]] besieged in [[Winchester]]. Empress Maud wants to regain the support of [[Henry of Blois|Henry, Bishop of Winchester]], but the canny bishop will not side with her again after the failure of his legatine council. Rather he is building up his own stores at [[Wolvesey Castle]] in Winchester in case he is besieged, and rebuilding his alliance with [[Matilda of Boulogne|Queen Matilda]], now leading King Stephen's armies. In Winchester, battle begins, with the Bishop's forces shooting fire arrows. The Abbey of Hyde-Mead in Winchester is laid waste, dispersing the surviving monks.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nIn this hot, dry August 1141, Cadfael brings Brother Oswin to his term at the leper house at Saint Giles. Two monks arrive at Shrewsbury Abbey, Brother Humilis and the mute, young Brother Fidelis as refugees from Abbey of Hyde-Mead. Humilis came so far because he was born nearby. Cadfael recognizes Humilis as local man Godfrid Marescot, who joined the Crusades years earlier, gaining a reputation for valour. Hugh Beringar sees that the man is ill and not long for this world. Cadfael finds Humilis collapsed over his writing desk. Cadfael sees the severity of the old wound, which left him unable to father children.\n\nBrother Urien makes a sexual advance towards young Rhun, but is rejected. Rhun is thus aware of the troubled Brother Urien. Two days later, Rhun begins formally as a novice with a tonsure, a Brother. A week or so later, Brother Urien makes an advance towards Brother Fidelis. Fidelis rejects him.\n\nNicholas Harnage arrives on leave from the Queen's army, to visit his leader in the Crusades. He wants to propose marriage to Julian Cruce. She was once betrothed to Humilis/Godfrid, but freed by him upon his return as a wounded man. Nicholas met her once, when he delivered this news three years earlier. Humilis consents, so Nicholas begins his quest for the lady.\n\nNicholas\u2019s quest brings him first to her family home; then to the convent at [[Wherwell Abbey|Wherwell]], which she planned to join after Godfrid ended the betrothal; back to the family home to learn of the men who escorted her; to Winchester, with the Bishop's blessing, to seek the goods she carried as a gift to the convent that never heard word of her; each time returning to Shrewsbury Abbey with his news. He fears for her life when Wherwell Abbey is burned, and again when the jeweller who purchased her personal jewelry from the servant says the servant reported the lady as dead. On that news, her brother Reginald agrees to aid Nicholas. Hugh agrees to seek the missing escort Adam Heriet, a man-at-arms since the overlord called for more men from Reginald. \nIn his travels, Nicholas witnesses the [[rout of Winchester]]. The Empress broke out of the siege, marching out at dawn along the Stockbridge road, now pursued by the Queen's army, which takes [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]] at Stockbridge. He is held in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]. In the rout, the Empress escapes with her life.\n\nHugh finds Heriet at his sister's home. Heriet let Julian travel the last mile on her own at her request. He has no knowledge of her in the three years since. Hugh returns to Shrewsbury with Heriet. Heriet recalls Julian's happy expectation of her marriage to Godfrid, in her youth. Brother Humilis is in the infirmary where Cadfael and Brother Fidelis tend him. Hugh tells Humilis what he has learned and Heriet recounts his story. Heriet denies robbing and killing Julian, and agrees to stay in a castle cell.\n\nAlone with Cadfael and Hugh, Brother Humilis asks about the valuables that disappeared with Julian. Hugh describes them. Brother Urien overhears and thinks one item is worn by Brother Fidelis, giving Urien reason to approach again. Angered by rejection, Urien pulls the chain to see what hangs on it. Urien threatens to accuse Fidelis of theft, and leaves. Rhun witnesses this. Rhun suggests to Brother Edmund that Fidelis sleep in Brother Humilis's room. That night, Humilis wakes to discover his friend on the cot. He sees an old gold ring on the chain around his neck. Thus Brother Humilis confirms the truth about his faithful mute companion.\n\nHumilis asks Cadfael to protect Brother Fidelis after Humilis dies. Humilis then asks that he and Fidelis visit his childhood home. They travel by the river, for less exertion. Cadfael enlists Aline's assistance for his plans. Then Cadfael recruits Madog and his skiff for their journey next day to the manor upriver at Salton. At the manor, Humilis speaks warmly to Fidelis of his gratitude and love for all the care in his last years. Returning to the Abbey, they are caught in heavy rains. They are undone by lightning that strikes a huge willow, which falls to knock their skiff to pieces. Fidelis comes up for air, sees Humilis, holds him up. Madog takes Humilis to shore, tries to revive him, as Fidelis washes up alive at the same place. Realising Humilis is dead, Fidelis keens in deep pain.\n\nMadog meets Cadfael alone at the mill. Relating how Humilis died in the river, he asks how to deal with the surprise uncovered in the disaster. Cadfael says their story is that Fidelis died in the river with Humilis, body never found. Cadfael proceeds to Aline. They ride along the river on horseback to care for the survivor.\n\nHugh and Nicholas accuse Adam Heriet of the lady Julian's murder. Heriet sticks to his story. News of the river deaths interrupts the interrogation. Hugh and Nicholas see Brother Humilis's body being carried to the Abbey. Madog recounts the accident to Abbott Radulfus, who sorrowfully accepts all he says. Hugh notices Cadfael's absence. Once home, Aline tells Hugh what has happened. Cadfael will return their horse; Hugh sets Adam Heriet at ease about Lady Julian.\n\nBrother Humilis is laid to rest in the Abbey transept. Reginald Cruce recalls another ring that meant much to his sister, Godfrid's betrothal gift, a gold ring from his family. She wore it on a chain around her neck. This is what Godfrid saw just before his death.\n\nJust after the ceremony, Sister Magdalene of Godric's Ford Benedictine cell arrives with a letter addressed to Hugh from Lady Julian, now at [[Polesworth Abbey]]. Lady Julian had not felt a true vocation so went instead to [[Sopwell Priory]] without taking vows. Hearing the rumors that she was 'done to death for gain,' she asks for an escort to fetch her to Shrewsbury. Reginald is joyous that his sister is alive and repentant of having wronged Adam Heriet. Nicholas is stunned and pleased.\n\nBrothers Rhun and Urien are both at the river side, one in grief and the latter in despair. Urien speaks of confessing and facing retribution for what he did. Rhun persuades him to keep Fidelis's secret between the two of them for the sake of Fidelis. Rhun realises that Fidelis is Julian Cruce, in many ways back from the dead. Two days later, Lady Julian arrives for the Mass said in honor of the lost brothers, walking unrecognized past the men with whom she had lived for weeks. She wore the gold ring on her finger, and was dressed by Aline and Sister Magdalene to hide her tonsure. Nicholas and Julian meet. Nicholas is still in love with her. Julian asks him to visit her at her brother's manor.\n\nCadfael is relieved to avoid the scandal it would have been to the order, both Abbeys, and Lady Julian, had the truth come out. Hugh reflects on Heriet's true devotion. Cadfael recalls his journey to Sister Magdalene with Fidelis/Julian. Sister Magdalene notes that the letter she wrote for Julian had no lies, just a few deceptions, and praises the wisdom of Julian's decision to assume muteness in her time as Fidelis, as one who cannot speak, cannot lie.\n\nThe novel concludes with a quote from the solemnization of matrimony, taken from the Book of Common Prayer.\n\n==Characters==\n\n*Brother [[Cadfael]]: [[Benedictine]] monk and [[herbalist]] for Shrewsbury Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul at Shrewsbury, Shropshire.<ref name=\"A Rare Benedicine\">{{cite book\n|last = Peters\n|first = Ellis\n|authorlink = Ellis Peters\n|title = A Rare Benedicine\n|publisher = Headline Book Publishing\n|date = 22 September 1988\n|location = UK\n|pages = 25, 26\n|isbn = 978-0-7472-0076-5}}</ref> He is about 61 years old in this novel.\n*Hugh Beringar: Lord Sheriff of Shropshire.

How the lost is found, with numerous surprising ramifications that bear on the puzzle, tests Cadfael's wits and ingenuity to the limit and provides the reader with unflagging tension, which builds to a sweeping, satisfying climax. Peters never disappoints--her absorbing, superbly crafted stories are one of the oases in a desert of mediocrity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/ellis-peters-21/an-excellent-mystery/ |date= 24 June 1986 |title=An Excellent Mystery |first=Ellis |last=Peters |work=Kirkus Reviews |accessdate=27 November 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[Library Journal]]'', reviewing an audio version read by Stephen Thorne, has praise for the narrator in making medieval language sound natural:\n\n<blockquote>''An Excellent Mystery'', also set in 1141, is a close sequel to ''Pilgrim of Hate''. When the Benedictine abbey at Winchester is ravaged by fire, two Brothers of the order seek sanctuary at Shrewsbury. Brother Humilis was a famous knight crusader before a nearly fatal wound led to his retirement from the secular world. His mute companion, Brother Fidelis, serves as Humilis's caretaker and nurse. Young Fidelis is like a shadow, his inability to speak makes him the keeper of many secrets. Stephen Thorne, who reads both novels, has a feel for Peters's distinctive prose style, making her use of medieval phrasing and vocabulary sound genuine and natural rather than \"historical.\" Thorne voices the large number of characters and accents in each book with precision, making each unique.

The review is on the whole favourable, praising Ellis Peters' use of strong yet feminine characters and the character of Cadfael as an original detective. The review closes with the recommendation that the book be read as part of the Cadfael series.<ref name=\"National Review\">{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_v38/ai_4551558/ |title=An excellent mystery: the eleventh chronicle of Brother Cadfael |accessdate=16 April 2009 |first=Linda |last=Bridges |date=5 December 1986 |publisher=National Review |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040926014441/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_v38/ai_4551558 |archive-date=26 September 2004 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Historical setting==\nThe events in ''An Excellent Mystery'' take place in August 1141 during the civil war between [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] and [[Empress Maud]], known as [[the Anarchy]].

The two monks arrive in Shrewsbury from the [[Hyde Abbey|Abbey of Hyde-Mead]] because it had burned completely in the start of the battles in Winchester. Hugh Beringar's pursuit of Adam Heriet is made easy because it occurs in the time after the [[Rout of Winchester]], when armies are scattered, a lull in the battles while negotiations begin for the exchange of the King imprisoned seven months, and the newly-taken Robert of Gloucester. Heriet is on leave for a visit with his family. Searching for news of Julian, Nicholas rides past the scene of that same battle, sharing the news with the Abbott, the Sheriff and Cadfael in Shrewsbury.\n\nThe Abbey is in [[Shropshire]] in England. The real towns of [[Shrewsbury]] and [[Winchester]] (in Hampshire) are used as locations for much of the story's action. The manor of the de Marescot family was set upriver of [[Frankwell]] along the [[River Severn]]. Harnage's travels seeking the Lady Julian take him to [[Romsey Abbey]], about 200 miles south on modern roads from Shrewsbury, and near Winchester. He journeyed to [[Wherwell Abbey]] in Hampshire, about 175 miles on modern roads from Shrewsbury. He stops twice at Lai, one of several manors of the Cruce family in the shire, presumably close to [[Ightfield]] (another of the family's manors) about 20 miles northeast of Shrewsbury on modern roads. The last stopping place before reaching the Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul for the two monks from Hyde-Mead Abbey is [[Bridgnorth|Brigge]], a market town with a bridge over the River Severn, about 20\u201327 miles from Shrewsbury on modern roads. Lady Julian Cruce waited at [[Polesworth Abbey]], the mother house for the Godric's Ford cell of nuns. That real nunnery (until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]) is about 60 miles on modern roads from Shrewsbury, so it was prudent for her to request an escort to return to her family home. Lai appears in [[Domesday Book]] as one of the [[List of Shropshire deserted villages and lost places|lost manors of Shropshire]] but its actual location is uncertain. \n\nAt the opening of the novel, [[Lammas]] Day and Loaf Mass are mentioned as having been well-timed to the actual harvest from the good growing weather up to the start of August. The first of August did mark the expected time of the wheat harvest before the calendar change in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guy-sports.com/humor/saints/lammas_august.htm |title=Lammas Tide Traditions - 1st August |work=Stories}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/aug/01/local-loaves-for-lammas?newsfeed=true |title=Local Loaves for Lammas |publisher=The Guardian |author=Andrew Whitely |date=1 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.kumc.edu/diversity/ethnic_relig/lammas.html |title=Lammas and Ughnasadh |publisher=University of Kansas Medical Center |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509034212/http://www3.kumc.edu/diversity/ethnic_relig/lammas.html |archivedate=9 May 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> The success of the three-day [[Saint Peter's Fair]] of this year is also mentioned.\n\nIn this and other novels of the series, Cadfael makes wine for his guests. In the 12th century, this was possible, vineyards in southern England. This reflects the warmer climate in northern Europe, described in the [[Medieval Warm Period]], [[Wine from the United Kingdom]] and one other source.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english-wine.com/history.html |title=Domesday & Middle Ages |work=The History of English Wine |author=Robert J.

Although the marriage of Godfrid and Julian could not be consummated because of his wounds and her disguise, she had \"his company, the care of him, the secrets of his body, as intimate as ever was marriage - his love, far beyond the common claims of marriage.\"<ref name=EM>{{cite book |author=Peters, Ellis |title=An Excellent Mystery |page=218 |edition=American paperback |publisher=Fawcett Crest |location=New York |year=1985}}</ref>\n\nThe power of love shared in goodness for the other, and the perversion of love, in the hands of one who does not understand this, is a major theme. The perversion is shown in the confusion of the mind of Brother Urien, consumed by the passion of love, seeking his own needs and not those of the one he purports to love, from the wife who left him to the young brothers in the Abbey he approaches. The power of love shared for the benefit of the loved one is shown in many characters, including Brother Fidelis, Nicholas, Hugh and his wife Aline, Brother Ruhn, and always, Brother Cadfael.\n\nThis novel is unique among the Brother Cadfael series in that no one of the major characters is killed - although it is believed through most of the novel that the Lady Julian has been murdered. It is set in a time of brutal killing of non-combatants in the conflict over who should rule England, setting fire to a monastery and convent at Winchester and the convent at Wherwell while their residents yet lived there.\n\n==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==\nAlthough there have been BBC Radio adaptations and TV adaptations of many of the Cadfael stories, ''An Excellent Mystery'' has not been featured amongst them.\n\n==Publication history==\nFollowing is a list of four editions in hardback, eight in paperback, and nine audio books, published in the UK and the US in English.

Anarchy]]. It is the 11th in [[the Cadfael Chronicles]], published in 1985.\n\nThe siege of Winchester sends monks streaming across England seeking safe haven. Two arrive at Shrewsbury Abbey. A young man seeks out the older of the two monks, wanting his approval to marry a young woman once meant for another, and she cannot be found. His quest begins.\n\n==Plot introduction==\n\nNews comes slowly to the Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul from the battles in the south between the imprisoned [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]] and the [[Empress Matilda|Empress Maud]] besieged in [[Winchester]]. Empress Maud wants to regain the support of [[Henry of Blois|Henry, Bishop of Winchester]], but the canny bishop will not side with her again after the failure of his legatine council. Rather he is building up his own stores at [[Wolvesey Castle]] in Winchester in case he is besieged, and rebuilding his alliance with [[Matilda of Boulogne|Queen Matilda]], now leading King Stephen's armies. In Winchester, battle begins, with the Bishop's forces shooting fire arrows. The Abbey of Hyde-Mead in Winchester is laid waste, dispersing the surviving monks.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nIn this hot, dry August 1141, Cadfael brings Brother Oswin to his term at the leper house at Saint Giles. Two monks arrive at Shrewsbury Abbey, Brother Humilis and the mute, young Brother Fidelis as refugees from Abbey of Hyde-Mead. Humilis came so far because he was born nearby. Cadfael recognizes Humilis as local man Godfrid Marescot, who joined the Crusades years earlier, gaining a reputation for valour. Hugh Beringar sees that the man is ill and not long for this world. Cadfael finds Humilis collapsed over his writing desk. Cadfael sees the severity of the old wound, which left him unable to father children.\n\nBrother Urien makes a sexual advance towards young Rhun, but is rejected. Rhun is thus aware of the troubled Brother Urien. Two days later, Rhun begins formally as a novice with a tonsure, a Brother. A week or so later, Brother Urien makes an advance towards Brother Fidelis. Fidelis rejects him.\n\nNicholas Harnage arrives on leave from the Queen's army, to visit his leader in the Crusades. He wants to propose marriage to Julian Cruce. She was once betrothed to Humilis/Godfrid, but freed by him upon his return as a wounded man. Nicholas met her once, when he delivered this news three years earlier. Humilis consents, so Nicholas begins his quest for the lady.\n\nNicholas\u2019s quest brings him first to her family home; then to the convent at [[Wherwell Abbey|Wherwell]], which she planned to join after Godfrid ended the betrothal; back to the family home to learn of the men who escorted her; to Winchester, with the Bishop's blessing, to seek the goods she carried as a gift to the convent that never heard word of her; each time returning to Shrewsbury Abbey with his news. He fears for her life when Wherwell Abbey is burned, and again when the jeweller who purchased her personal jewelry from the servant says the servant reported the lady as dead. On that news, her brother Reginald agrees to aid Nicholas. Hugh agrees to seek the missing escort Adam Heriet, a man-at-arms since the overlord called for more men from Reginald. \nIn his travels, Nicholas witnesses the [[rout of Winchester]]. The Empress broke out of the siege, marching out at dawn along the Stockbridge road, now pursued by the Queen's army, which takes [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]] at Stockbridge. He is held in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]. In the rout, the Empress escapes with her life.\n\nHugh finds Heriet at his sister's home. Heriet let Julian travel the last mile on her own at her request. He has no knowledge of her in the three years since. Hugh returns to Shrewsbury with Heriet. Heriet recalls Julian's happy expectation of her marriage to Godfrid, in her youth. Brother Humilis is in the infirmary where Cadfael and Brother Fidelis tend him. Hugh tells Humilis what he has learned and Heriet recounts his story. Heriet denies robbing and killing Julian, and agrees to stay in a castle cell.\n\nAlone with Cadfael and Hugh, Brother Humilis asks about the valuables that disappeared with Julian. Hugh describes them. Brother Urien overhears and thinks one item is worn by Brother Fidelis, giving Urien reason to approach again. Angered by rejection, Urien pulls the chain to see what hangs on it. Urien threatens to accuse Fidelis of theft, and leaves. Rhun witnesses this. Rhun suggests to Brother Edmund that Fidelis sleep in Brother Humilis's room. That night, Humilis wakes to discover his friend on the cot. He sees an old gold ring on the chain around his neck. Thus Brother Humilis confirms the truth about his faithful mute companion.\n\nHumilis asks Cadfael to protect Brother Fidelis after Humilis dies. Humilis then asks that he and Fidelis visit his childhood home. They travel by the river, for less exertion. Cadfael enlists Aline's assistance for his plans. Then Cadfael recruits Madog and his skiff for their journey next day to the manor upriver at Salton. At the manor, Humilis speaks warmly to Fidelis of his gratitude and love for all the care in his last years. Returning to the Abbey, they are caught in heavy rains. They are undone by lightning that strikes a huge willow, which falls to knock their skiff to pieces. Fidelis comes up for air, sees Humilis, holds him up. Madog takes Humilis to shore, tries to revive him, as Fidelis washes up alive at the same place. Realising Humilis is dead, Fidelis keens in deep pain.\n\nMadog meets Cadfael alone at the mill. Relating how Humilis died in the river, he asks how to deal with the surprise uncovered in the disaster. Cadfael says their story is that Fidelis died in the river with Humilis, body never found. Cadfael proceeds to Aline. They ride along the river on horseback to care for the survivor.\n\nHugh and Nicholas accuse Adam Heriet of the lady Julian's murder. Heriet sticks to his story. News of the river deaths interrupts the interrogation. Hugh and Nicholas see Brother Humilis's body being carried to the Abbey. Madog recounts the accident to Abbott Radulfus, who sorrowfully accepts all he says. Hugh notices Cadfael's absence. Once home, Aline tells Hugh what has happened. Cadfael will return their horse; Hugh sets Adam Heriet at ease about Lady Julian.\n\nBrother Humilis is laid to rest in the Abbey transept. Reginald Cruce recalls another ring that meant much to his sister, Godfrid's betrothal gift, a gold ring from his family. She wore it on a chain around her neck. This is what Godfrid saw just before his death.\n\nJust after the ceremony, Sister Magdalene of Godric's Ford Benedictine cell arrives with a letter addressed to Hugh from Lady Julian, now at [[Polesworth Abbey]]. Lady Julian had not felt a true vocation so went instead to [[Sopwell Priory]] without taking vows. Hearing the rumors that she was 'done to death for gain,' she asks for an escort to fetch her to Shrewsbury. Reginald is joyous that his sister is alive and repentant of having wronged Adam Heriet. Nicholas is stunned and pleased.\n\nBrothers Rhun and Urien are both at the river side, one in grief and the latter in despair. Urien speaks of confessing and facing retribution for what he did. Rhun persuades him to keep Fidelis's secret between the two of them for the sake of Fidelis. Rhun realises that Fidelis is Julian Cruce, in many ways back from the dead. Two days later, Lady Julian arrives for the Mass said in honor of the lost brothers, walking unrecognized past the men with whom she had lived for weeks. She wore the gold ring on her finger, and was dressed by Aline and Sister Magdalene to hide her tonsure. Nicholas and Julian meet. Nicholas is still in love with her. Julian asks him to visit her at her brother's manor.\n\nCadfael is relieved to avoid the scandal it would have been to the order, both Abbeys, and Lady Julian, had the truth come out. Hugh reflects on Heriet's true devotion. Cadfael recalls his journey to Sister Magdalene with Fidelis/Julian. Sister Magdalene notes that the letter she wrote for Julian had no lies, just a few deceptions, and praises the wisdom of Julian's decision to assume muteness in her time as Fidelis, as one who cannot speak, cannot lie.\n\nThe novel concludes with a quote from the solemnization of matrimony, taken from the Book of Common Prayer.\n\n==Characters==\n\n*Brother [[Cadfael]]: [[Benedictine]] monk and [[herbalist]] for Shrewsbury Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul at Shrewsbury, Shropshire.<ref name=\"A Rare Benedicine\">{{cite book\n|last = Peters\n|first = Ellis\n|authorlink = Ellis Peters\n|title = A Rare Benedicine\n|publisher = Headline Book Publishing\n|date = 22 September 1988\n|location = UK\n|pages = 25, 26\n|isbn = 978-0-7472-0076-5}}</ref> He is about 61 years old in this novel.\n*Hugh Beringar: Lord Sheriff of Shropshire.

He was introduced in ''[[The Leper of Saint Giles]]''.\n\n==Reviews==\n\n''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' finds this a superbly crafted story, with a mystery that tests Cadfael and keeps the reader's attention to the resolution:\n\n<blockquote>Eleventh of the author's civilized, imaginative forays into 12th-century England and, once again, we have the clever sleuthing of warm, wise Benedictine monk Brother Cadfael (''The Sanctuary Sparrow'', etc.). . . . How the lost is found, with numerous surprising ramifications that bear on the puzzle, tests Cadfael's wits and ingenuity to the limit and provides the reader with unflagging tension, which builds to a sweeping, satisfying climax. Peters never disappoints--her absorbing, superbly crafted stories are one of the oases in a desert of mediocrity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/ellis-peters-21/an-excellent-mystery/ |date= 24 June 1986 |title=An Excellent Mystery |first=Ellis |last=Peters |work=Kirkus Reviews |accessdate=27 November 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[Library Journal]]'', reviewing an audio version read by Stephen Thorne, has praise for the narrator in making medieval language sound natural:\n\n<blockquote>''An Excellent Mystery'', also set in 1141, is a close sequel to ''Pilgrim of Hate''. When the Benedictine abbey at Winchester is ravaged by fire, two Brothers of the order seek sanctuary at Shrewsbury. Brother Humilis was a famous knight crusader before a nearly fatal wound led to his retirement from the secular world. His mute companion, Brother Fidelis, serves as Humilis's caretaker and nurse. Young Fidelis is like a shadow, his inability to speak makes him the keeper of many secrets. Stephen Thorne, who reads both novels, has a feel for Peters's distinctive prose style, making her use of medieval phrasing and vocabulary sound genuine and natural rather than \"historical.\" Thorne voices the large number of characters and accents in each book with precision, making each unique.

The review is on the whole favourable, praising Ellis Peters' use of strong yet feminine characters and the character of Cadfael as an original detective. The review closes with the recommendation that the book be read as part of the Cadfael series.<ref name=\"National Review\">{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_v38/ai_4551558/ |title=An excellent mystery: the eleventh chronicle of Brother Cadfael |accessdate=16 April 2009 |first=Linda |last=Bridges |date=5 December 1986 |publisher=National Review |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040926014441/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_v38/ai_4551558 |archive-date=26 September 2004 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Setting in History==\nThe events in ''An Excellent Mystery'' take place in August 1141 during the civil war between [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] and [[Empress Maud]], known as [[the Anarchy]].

The two monks arrive in Shrewsbury from the [[Hyde Abbey|Abbey of Hyde-Mead]] because it had burned completely in the start of the battles in Winchester. Hugh Beringar's pursuit of Adam Heriet is made easy because it occurs in the time after the [[Rout of Winchester]], when armies are scattered, a lull in the battles while negotiations begin for the exchange of the King imprisoned seven months, and the newly-taken Robert of Gloucester. Heriet is on leave for a visit with his family. Searching for news of Julian, Nicholas rides past the scene of that same battle, sharing the news with the Abbott, the Sheriff and Cadfael in Shrewsbury.\n\nThe Abbey is in [[Shropshire]] in England. The real towns of [[Shrewsbury]] and [[Winchester]] (in Hampshire) are used as locations for much of the story's action. The manor of the de Marescot family was set upriver of [[Frankwell]] along the [[River Severn]]. Harnage's travels seeking the Lady Julian take him to [[Romsey Abbey]], about 200 miles south on modern roads from Shrewsbury, and near Winchester. He journeyed to [[Wherwell Abbey]] in Hampshire, about 175 miles on modern roads from Shrewsbury. He stops twice at Lai, one of several manors of the Cruce family in the shire, presumably close to [[Ightfield]] (another of the family's manors) about 20 miles northeast of Shrewsbury on modern roads. The last stopping place before reaching the Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul for the two monks from Hyde-Mead Abbey is [[Bridgnorth|Brigge]], a market town with a bridge over the River Severn, about 20\u201327 miles from Shrewsbury on modern roads. Lady Julian Cruce waited at [[Polesworth Abbey]], the mother house for the Godric's Ford cell of nuns. That real nunnery (until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]) is about 60 miles on modern roads from Shrewsbury, so it was prudent for her to request an escort to return to her family home. Lai appears in [[Domesday Book]] as one of the [[List of Shropshire deserted villages and lost places|lost manors of Shropshire]] but its actual location is uncertain. \n\nAt the opening of the novel, [[Lammas]] Day and Loaf Mass are mentioned as having been well-timed to the actual harvest from the good growing weather up to the start of August. The first of August did mark the expected time of the wheat harvest before the calendar change in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guy-sports.com/humor/saints/lammas_august.htm |title=Lammas Tide Traditions - 1st August |work=Stories}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/aug/01/local-loaves-for-lammas?newsfeed=true |title=Local Loaves for Lammas |publisher=The Guardian |author=Andrew Whitely |date=1 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.kumc.edu/diversity/ethnic_relig/lammas.html |title=Lammas and Ughnasadh |publisher=University of Kansas Medical Center |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509034212/http://www3.kumc.edu/diversity/ethnic_relig/lammas.html |archivedate=9 May 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> The success of the three-day [[Saint Peter's Fair]] of this year is also mentioned.\n\nIn this and other novels of the series, Cadfael makes wine for his guests. In the 12th century, this was possible, vineyards in southern England. This reflects the warmer climate in northern Europe, described in the [[Medieval Warm Period]], [[Wine from the United Kingdom]] and one other source.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english-wine.com/history.html |title=Domesday & Middle Ages |work=The History of English Wine |author=Robert J.

The author who avoids irony<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-ellis-peters-1577918.html |title=Obituary: Ellis Peters |publisher= The Independent |date=16 October 1995}}</ref> adds a touch of it with this quote, as the Book of Common Prayer came after Henry VIII split from the Roman Catholic church that dominated in the 12th Century, the setting of the novel.

Although the marriage of Godfrid and Julian could not be consummated because of his wounds and her disguise, she had \"his company, the care of him, the secrets of his body, as intimate as ever was marriage - his love, far beyond the common claims of marriage.\"<ref name=EM>{{cite book |author=Peters, Ellis |title=An Excellent Mystery |page=218 |edition=American paperback |publisher=Fawcett Crest |location=New York |year=1985}}</ref>\n\nThe power of love shared in goodness for the other, and the perversion of love, in the hands of one who does not understand this, is a major theme. The perversion is shown in the confusion of the mind of Brother Urien, consumed by the passion of love, seeking his own needs and not those of the one he purports to love, from the wife who left him to the young brothers in the Abbey he approaches. The power of love shared for the benefit of the loved one is shown in many characters, including Brother Fidelis, Nicholas, Hugh and his wife Aline, Brother Ruhn, and always, Brother Cadfael.\n\nThis novel is unique among the Brother Cadfael series in that no one of the major characters is killed - although it is believed through most of the novel that the Lady Julian has been murdered. It is set in a time of brutal killing of non-combatants in the conflict over who should rule England, setting fire to a monastery and convent at Winchester and the convent at Wherwell while their residents yet lived there.\n\n==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==\nAlthough there have been BBC Radio adaptations and TV adaptations of many of the Cadfael stories, ''An Excellent Mystery'' has not been featured amongst them.\n\n==Publication history==\nFollowing is a list of four editions in hardback, eight in paperback, and nine audio books, published in the UK and the US in English.
