{"title_page": "Fantasie in C (Schumann)", "text_new": "The '''Fantasie in C major''', Op. 17, was written by [[Robert Schumann]] in 1836.

I remember that I was surrounded with a lot of good athletes.\" In 1952, he became the first WKU athlete to be named an All-American. He was also named to the All-Ohio Valley Conference team in 1951 and 1952 and was named to the conference's all-time team in 1988. As a senior in 1952, Feix guided the Hilltoppers to their first OVC football championship with a 9-1 record and the school's first bowl game appearance. WKU was invited to the Refrigerator Bowl in Evansville, Ind. where they beat Arkansas State 34-19. Feix Stats were very impressive that year. He led the nation's college quarterbacks with a 63.1 percent completion percentage, making good on 111 of 176 passes for 1,581 yards and 15 touchdowns.

One of his many responsibilities while serving for the Air Force was to coach baseball, football and volleyball teams on the base. One day, Feix was coaching a 15-year-old how to pick off a base runner and at that moment he realized what he wanted to do with his life. \"There I was out on that field in the sunshine, the breeze blowing and the 15-year old eating up what I was talking about\", Feix said. \"I went home that day at noon and told my wife, Frankie, 'we're gonna get out of this air force.

One of his many responsibilities while serving for the Air Force was to coach baseball, football and volleyball teams on the base. One day, Feix was coaching a 15-year-old how to pick off a base runner and at that moment he realized what he wanted to do with his life. \"There I was out on that field in the sunshine, the breeze blowing and the 15-year old eating up what I was talking about\", Feix said. \"I went home that day at noon and told my wife, Frankie, 'we're gonna get out of this air force. I'm gonna try to find a coaching job somewhere because I think I wanna be a coach.'\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Coach Jimmy Feix|url=http://gavarsity.rivals.com/barrier_noentry.asp?ReturnTo=&sid=&script=content.asp&cid=828239&fid=&tid=&mid=&rid=|publisher=GA Varsity.com|accessdate=August 16, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter serving four years in the Air Force, Feix returned to WKU in 1957 to become the Assistant Football Coach under Coach Nick Denes. Feix was in charge of the offensive backfield. \"I learned a lot from Coach Denes\", Feix said. \"He was a great man and a great coach. The {{sic|principle}} thing I remember always is he emphasized that the player was the most important part of the program. The student athlete was the key and not to be carried away with how great a coach you were or what kind of facilities you had.\" <ref>{{cite web|title=Coach Jimmy Feix|url=http://gavarsity.rivals.com/barrier_noentry.asp?ReturnTo=&sid=&script=content.asp&cid=828239&fid=&tid=&mid=&rid=|publisher=GA Varsity|accessdate=August 16, 2012}}</ref> In 1968 after 11 years as the Assistant Football Coach, Feix was promoted to Head Coach, replacing the retiring Nick Denes.

Wolfe Davidson and minted in 1936. The [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] design depicts the personification of [[Lady Justice|justice]] holding a sword and scales, standing between the Old State House (built in 1790) and the [[South Carolina State House|New State House]] built (between 1855 and 1907). The reverse shows the [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]], [[South Carolina]]'s state symbol, surrounded by 13 stars representing the original [[Thirteen Colonies]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe area around what is now [[Columbia, South Carolina]], was settled by British colonials as early as 1718, when [[Fort Congaree]] was established at [[Granby, South Carolina]], near the city's present site.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} Following the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[South Carolina Legislature]] was concerned that the state capital, [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], was too vulnerable to attack by sea and too far from the agricultural lands being developed. Accordingly, in 1786, Columbia was designated to be the new capital, one of the first [[planned cities]] in the United States. The legislature first met there at the [[South Carolina State House#Old Carolina State House|Old State House]] in 1790.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} That building proved subject to flooding and damp\u2014a poor place to store important state records. Work began on a new building in 1856 but was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]]; the Old State House was burned following its capture by Union troops in 1865. South Carolina had little money for capitol construction after the war, and the new building was not completed until 1903.{{sfn|Stang|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nUntil 1954, the entire mintage of commemorative coin issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market. In early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the hobby of [[coin collecting]], where they sought to purchase the new issues. This led to many commemorative coin proposals in Congress, including some of purely local significance.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=62\u201363}} These bills passed despite the fact the Treasury Department opposed the issuance of commemorative coins, and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had asked that Congress pass no more such bills in 1935.<ref>{{cite book|author=United States Senate Committee on Banking and Currency|title=Commemorative coins and Mint bills|url=https://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/docview/t29.d30.hrg-1947-bcs-0003|url-access=subscription|date=February 10, 1947|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]|pp=36\u201338}}</ref> The group designated to purchase the Columbia half dollar from the government was a committee to be established by Columbia's mayor, consisting of not fewer than three people.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n== Legislation ==\nThe coin was proposed by the Columbia Sesqui-Centennial Commission, which wanted to strike commemorative coins for the 150th anniversary of the city's founding.<ref name=ngc>{{cite web|url=https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/silver-commemoratives-pscid-71/1936-d-columbia-50c-ms-coinid-19292|title=Silver Commemoratives \u2013 1936 D Columbia 50C MS|website=NGC Coin Explorer|accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> Legislation to authorize a Columbia half dollar was introduced on June 17, 1935, by South Carolina's [[Hampton P.

[[Bertrand H. Snell]] of New York asked if the bill had come from the Coinage Committee. Fulmer stated that it had, and it was being pressed now in the hope of having coins to sell at the celebrations in Columbia in March. Snell stated that he had wanted such a coin at the request of some people from his part of the country, but had learned it was against Treasury Department policy. [[Jesse P. Wolcott]] of Michigan noted that he and others from that state had tried to get a coin for the centennial of its admission to the Union. They had not pressed the matter only because of Treasury Department opposition and the threat of a presidential veto. [[Thomas J. O'Brien (Illinois politician)|Thomas J.

South Carolina's [[James F. Byrnes]] reported it back on March 3, 1936, recommending a number of minor amendments which stressed that the anniversary commemorated was not the founding of the city, but of it being the capital of South Carolina. The Senate amended the bill and passed it without discussion or dissent.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3100|date=March 3, 1936}}</ref> As the two houses had passed versions that were not identical, the bill returned to the House of Representatives, where, on March 5, Fulmer asked that the House adopt the Senate amendments, which it did.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3337|date=March 5, 1936}}</ref> The bill, providing for 25,000 half dollars, became law with the signature of President Roosevelt on March 18, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n==Preparation==\nThe Sesqui-Centennial Commission selected 32-year old sculptor Abraham Wolfe Davidson of [[Clemson University|Clemson College]] to design the coin.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early>{{cite web|url=http://earlycommemorativecoins.com/1936-columbia-sesquicentennial-half-dollar/|title=1936 Columbia Sesquicentennial Half Dollar|website=Early Commemorative Coins|accessdate=April 22, 2019}}</ref> Davidson, a Jewish immigrant from Russia, had reached a deal with Clemson administrators whereby he would sculpt a statue of its founder, [[Thomas G.

The figure of Justice on the obverse was made less \"slumpy\", and the leaves of the [[wikt:palmetto|palmetto]] on the reverse idealized. On July 22, the revised models were approved by the CFA, and they also met the approval of Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]].{{sfn|Taxay|p=181}}\n\n== Design ==\nThe obverse of the Columbia half dollar depicts [[Lady Justice]], bearing a sword and a set of scales, though lacking the blindfold used in many depictions. To her left and right are South Carolina's old and new state houses, with one of the anniversary dates under each. If the coin was struck at the [[Denver Mint]] or at [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]], the appropriate [[mint mark]] appears beneath her\u2014D or S. At the time, the [[Philadelphia Mint]] did not use one. The word {{small|LIBERTY}} appears to her left, and a statement of the anniversary rings the design.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=321\u2013322}}\n\nThe reverse depicts a [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]], the emblem of South Carolina. Arrows are tied to its base in a [[saltire]] pattern by a broad ribbon, signifying the tree's military connotation. On June 28, 1776, a British naval squadron tried to seize [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston Harbor]]. Though many shots were fired by the British ships, those that hit the fortifications were absorbed by the soft palmetto logs that formed it; the American death toll was 12 against hundreds of British killed by the fort's gunfire. The lopped oak branch at the palmetto's base symbolizes the oaken British vessels.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} As Arlie Slabaugh Jr. put it in his volume on commemorative coins, \"the South Carolinians had proven in 1776 that the palmetto was superior to the oak of Old England, and so it appears above the oak on this coin\".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} The 13 stars surrounding the tree ostensibly symbolize the original American states, but may also have been intended to evoke the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} The name of the country, the coin's face value, and the mottos required by law appear on the reverse. Davidson's initials do not appear on the coin.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=322}}\n\nAccording to Carl Stang in his 2012 article on the Columbia half dollar, \"the coin generally is nice looking in virtually any condition\".{{sfn|Stang|p=59}} Numismatic author [[Q. David Bowers]] stated, \"The half dollar was attractive in its simplicity, and few numismatists\u2014who certainly are inclined to voice opinions if they don't like things\u2014felt moved to be critical.\"{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}} Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume on American coins and medals, writes, \"the coin presents a weak combination of allegorical obverse and symbolic reverse, with disparate lettering, cramped on one side and spread out irregularly on the other.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}} He deemed the obverse \"badly proportioned\" and the reverse \"boring; it recalls the nineteenth-century primitivism of a Spanish colonial or newly-independent South American country's large denominations in silver, but lacks the spontaneity of those rugged pieces of eight. The Columbia half-dollar, of course, lacks the rough feeling of work in a screw press evoked by these coins.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}}\n\n== Distribution and collecting ==\nThe anniversary celebrations in Columbia took place between March&nbsp;22 and 29, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} On May&nbsp;30, Senator Byrnes wrote to Director Ross, asking on behalf of Hammond that the coins be struck at all three of the mints then open. He also requested that if this was not possible, that some of the coins be struck dated 1936 and some dated 1937.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} A subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency had held hearings on March&nbsp;11, at which there had been testimony that commemoratives were being struck at multiple mints and in multiple years to increase the number of [[Glossary of numismatics#V|varieties]] a collector needed for a complete set,{{sfn|Bowers|pp=210\u2013211}} but the Columbia bill, signed into law only a week later, allowed for striking at multiple mints, and this had occurred by the end of September 1936.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=343\u2013344}} 9,007 were struck at Philadelphia, 8,009 at Denver and 8,007 at San Francisco, with the excess over the even thousands held for examination and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=77}} Although the Columbia piece was the first new commemorative authorized in 1936, it thus became the last to be struck.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=132}} The coins were not distributed immediately, but orders were taken at $2.15 for a single coin, with a set of three for $6.45. By October 19, 1936, the issue was oversubscribed by 15,000 coins, likely representing quantities desired by coin dealers. By the start of December, the coins remained undistributed, causing some adverse comment in the numismatic community.{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}}\n\nTo ensure a fair distribution of the coins, only small orders were filled. For the first 24 hours of sales, the coins were available only to residents of the city and could only be purchased by mail order.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early/> Local residents could buy them at $2 each.

Wolfe Davidson and minted in 1936. The [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] design depicts the personification of [[Lady Justice|justice]] holding a sword and scales, standing between the Old State House (built in 1790) and the [[South Carolina State House|New State House]] built (between 1855 and 1907). The reverse shows the [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]], [[South Carolina]]'s state symbol, surrounded by 13 stars representing the original [[Thirteen Colonies]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe area around what is now [[Columbia, South Carolina]], was settled by British colonials as early as 1718, when [[Fort Congaree]] was established at [[Granby, South Carolina]], near the city's present site.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} Following the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[South Carolina Legislature]] was concerned that the state capital, [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], was too vulnerable to attack by sea and too far from the agricultural lands being developed. Accordingly, in 1786, Columbia was designated to be the new capital, one of the first [[planned cities]] in the United States. The legislature first met there at the [[South Carolina State House#Old Carolina State House|Old State House]] in 1790.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} That building proved subject to flooding and damp\u2014a poor place to store important state records. Work began on a new building in 1856 but was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]]; the Old State House was burned following its capture by Union troops in 1865. South Carolina had little money for capitol construction after the war, and the new building was not completed until 1903.{{sfn|Stang|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nUntil 1954, the entire mintage of commemorative coin issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market. In early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the hobby of [[coin collecting]], where they sought to purchase the new issues. This led to many commemorative coin proposals in Congress, including some of purely local significance.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=62\u201363}} These bills passed despite the fact the Treasury Department opposed the issuance of commemorative coins, and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had asked that Congress pass no more such bills in 1935.<ref>{{cite book|author=United States Senate Committee on Banking and Currency|title=Commemorative coins and Mint bills|url=https://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/docview/t29.d30.hrg-1947-bcs-0003|url-access=subscription|date=February 10, 1947|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]|pp=36\u201338}}</ref> The group designated to purchase the Columbia half dollar from the government was a committee to be established by Columbia's mayor, consisting of not fewer than three people.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n== Legislation ==\nThe coin was proposed by the Columbia Sesqui-Centennial Commission, which wanted to strike commemorative coins for the 150th anniversary of the city's founding.<ref name=ngc>{{cite web|url=https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/silver-commemoratives-pscid-71/1936-d-columbia-50c-ms-coinid-19292|title=Silver Commemoratives \u2013 1936 D Columbia 50C MS|website=NGC Coin Explorer|accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> Legislation to authorize a Columbia half dollar was introduced on June 17, 1935, by South Carolina's [[Hampton P.

[[Bertrand H. Snell]] of New York asked if the bill had come from the Coinage Committee. Fulmer stated that it had, and it was being pressed now in the hope of having coins to sell at the celebrations in Columbia in March. Snell stated that he had wanted such a coin at the request of some people from his part of the country, but had learned it was against Treasury Department policy. [[Jesse P. Wolcott]] of Michigan noted that he and others from that state had tried to get a coin for the centennial of its admission to the Union. They had not pressed the matter only because of Treasury Department opposition and the threat of a presidential veto. [[Thomas J. O'Brien (Illinois politician)|Thomas J.

South Carolina's [[James F. Byrnes]] reported it back on March 3, 1936, recommending a number of minor amendments which stressed that the anniversary commemorated was not the founding of the city, but of it being the capital of South Carolina. The Senate amended the bill and passed it without discussion or dissent.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3100|date=March 3, 1936}}</ref> As the two houses had passed versions that were not identical, the bill returned to the House of Representatives, where, on March 5, Fulmer asked that the House adopt the Senate amendments, which it did.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3337|date=March 5, 1936}}</ref> The bill, providing for 25,000 half dollars, became law with the signature of President Roosevelt on March 18, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n==Preparation==\nThe Sesqui-Centennial Commission selected 32-year old sculptor Abraham Wolfe Davidson of [[Clemson University|Clemson College]] to design the coin.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early>{{cite web|url=http://earlycommemorativecoins.com/1936-columbia-sesquicentennial-half-dollar/|title=1936 Columbia Sesquicentennial Half Dollar|website=Early Commemorative Coins|accessdate=April 22, 2019}}</ref> Davidson, a Jewish immigrant from Russia, had reached a deal with Clemson administrators whereby he would sculpt a statue of its founder, [[Thomas G.

Harding]] charged the CFA with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins,{{sfn|Taxay|pp=v\u2013vi}} and Ross wanted the CFA\"s opinion.

The figure of Justice on the obverse was made less \"slumpy\", and the leaves of the [[wikt:palmetto|palmetto]] on the reverse idealized. On July 22, the revised models were approved by the CFA, and they also met the approval of Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]].{{sfn|Taxay|p=181}}\n\n== Design ==\nThe obverse of the Columbia half dollar depicts [[Lady Justice]], bearing a sword and a set of scales, though lacking the blindfold used in many depictions. To her left and right are South Carolina's old and new state houses, with one of the anniversary dates under each. If the coin was struck at the [[Denver Mint]] or at [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]], the appropriate [[mint mark]] appears beneath her\u2014D or S. At the time, the [[Philadelphia Mint]] did not use one. The word {{small|LIBERTY}} appears to her left, and a statement of the anniversary rings the design.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=321\u2013322}}\n\nThe reverse depicts a [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]], the emblem of South Carolina. Arrows are tied to its base in a [[saltire]] pattern by a broad ribbon, signifying the tree's military connotation. On June 28, 1776, a British naval squadron tried to seize [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston Harbor]]. Though many shots were fired by the British ships, those that hit the fortifications were absorbed by the soft palmetto logs that formed it; the American death toll was 12 against hundreds of British killed by the fort's gunfire. The lopped oak branch at the palmetto's base symbolizes the oaken British vessels.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} As Arlie Slabaugh Jr. put it in his volume on commemorative coins, \"the South Carolinians had proven in 1776 that the palmetto was superior to the oak of Old England, and so it appears above the oak on this coin\".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} The 13 stars surrounding the tree ostensibly symbolize the original American states, but may also have been intended to evoke the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} The name of the country, the coin's face value, and the mottos required by law appear on the reverse. Davidson's initials do not appear on the coin.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=322}}\n\nAccording to Carl Stang in his 2012 article on the Columbia half dollar, \"the coin generally is nice looking in virtually any condition\".{{sfn|Stang|p=59}} Numismatic author [[Q. David Bowers]] stated, \"The half dollar was attractive in its simplicity, and few numismatists\u2014who certainly are inclined to voice opinions if they don't like things\u2014felt moved to be critical.\"{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}} Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume on American coins and medals, writes, \"the coin presents a weak combination of allegorical obverse and symbolic reverse, with disparate lettering, cramped on one side and spread out irregularly on the other.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}} He deemed the obverse \"badly proportioned\" and the reverse \"boring; it recalls the nineteenth-century primitivism of a Spanish colonial or newly-independent South American country's large denominations in silver, but lacks the spontaneity of those rugged pieces of eight. The Columbia half-dollar, of course, lacks the rough feeling of work in a screw press evoked by these coins.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}}\n\n== Distribution and collecting ==\nThe anniversary celebrations in Columbia took place between March&nbsp;22 and 29, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} On May&nbsp;30, Senator Byrnes wrote to Director Ross, asking on behalf of Hammond that the coins be struck at all three of the mints then open. He also requested that if this was not possible, that some of the coins be struck dated 1936 and some dated 1937.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} A subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency had held hearings on March&nbsp;11, at which there had been testimony that commemoratives were being struck at multiple mints and in multiple years to increase the number of [[Glossary of numismatics#V|varieties]] a collector needed for a complete set,{{sfn|Bowers|pp=210\u2013211}} but the Columbia bill, signed into law only a week later, allowed for striking at multiple mints, and this had occurred by the end of September 1936.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=343\u2013344}} 9,007 were struck at Philadelphia, 8,009 at Denver and 8,007 at San Francisco, with the excess over the even thousands held for examination and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=77}} Although the Columbia piece was the first new commemorative authorized in 1936, it thus became the last to be struck.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=132}} The coins were not distributed immediately, but orders were taken at $2.15 for a single coin, with a set of three for $6.45. By October 19, 1936, the issue was oversubscribed by 15,000 coins, likely representing quantities desired by coin dealers. By the start of December, the coins remained undistributed, causing some adverse comment in the numismatic community.{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}}\n\nTo ensure a fair distribution of the coins, only small orders were filled. For the first 24 hours of sales, the coins were available only to residents of the city and could only be purchased by mail order.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early/> Local residents could buy them at $2 each. Dealers were unable to obtain large quantities,{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} leading them to list the coins for sale in their advertisements without a sales price.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} David Bullowa, in his 1938 monograph on commemoratives, wrote, \"the distribution was made by the commission on a very fair basis, and few persons were able to secure these coins in quantity. It made every endeavor to treat the collector fairly and to prevent the speculator from manipulating the prices of the sets in the open market, as had been done with many previous commemorative issues.\"{{sfn|Bullowa|p=132}} Most orders for a single set of coins were filled.

According to Robert's own statements, the Palk family was resident at Ambrooke in the late 15th century, which at the time of Robert's birth in 1717 was owned by the Neyle family.<ref>Love, Introduction, p.v</ref> This would therefore appear to discount suppositions in some sources that Robert himself was born at Ambrooke.\n\n==Education==\nHe was educated at Ashburton Grammar School, and was subsequently sponsored by his maternal uncle and godfather Robert Abraham, to attend [[Wadham College, Oxford]], where he graduated in 1739.\n\n==Career==\nPalk was ordained as a [[deacon]] in 1739 at [[Exeter Cathedral]] by Bishop Weston and held two [[Curate|curacies]] in [[Cornwall]] at [[Egloskerry]] and [[Launcells]], before going to London in 1741. During his time in London he attracted the attention and favour of Sir [[Robert Walpole]], generally regarded as the first [[Prime Minister of Great Britain]], under whose auspices he was sent to India.\n\nIn 1747 he was appointed naval chaplain to Admiral [[Edward Boscawen]] on the ''Namura'', bound for India. He arrived at [[Fort St David]] in 1748, at the time when the French were in control of [[Fort St George]] in [[Madras]], and vying with the British for trade supremacy. Initially this rivalry was merely a trade war, with only a minimal presence of armed troops, whose task it was to guard the warehouses. Soon however the situation evolved into armed fighting between the French and British, and eventually the British Government recognised they were at war with France over control of India. General [[Stringer Lawrence]] was given the task of forming an army, and history now remembers him as the \"Father of the Indian Army\". An [[Act of Parliament]] was passed in 1773 which effectively took control of Indian interests away from the [[East India Company]] and its shareholders and placed it into the hands of [[The Crown]].\n\n== Promotion ==\nEarly in 1749 the chaplain at Fort St David, Francis Fordyce, publicly insulted [[Robert Clive]], leading to his dismissal, and replacement by Robert Palk. This important promotion led to disagreements regarding the seniority of Palk over other chaplains. Palk sailed to [[Bombay]] in October 1750 with the intention of resigning his post and seeking [[informal sector|formal employment]] with the East India Company. However, matters were resolved and he was re-instated and returned to Fort St David in March 1751. It was at this time that Palk made the acquaintance of Stringer Lawrence, after which time they remained lifelong friends.\n\nRobert Clive was an army officer in the East India Company and later became Governor of Bengal. He arrived in India almost penniless, and due to his hard work and dedication to the King and the East India Company, he was well rewarded with many opportunities by his mentor, Stringer Lawrence. He later became the 1st [[Baron Clive]] of [[Plassey]] and made a fortune in India greater than Palk or Stringer Lawrence could ever have dreamt of.\n \nIn 1752 Robert Palk was appointed to the lucrative position of \"Paymaster and Commissary in the Field\" to Lawrence's army. In January 1754 Palk and [[Henry Vansittart]] were appointed to discuss the terms of a peace settlement with the French who  controlled a large part of India. A year later a settlement was reached. A colleague of Palk's in Madras, [[Robert Orme]], noted at that time that \"Palk had long ince given up studies of history and theology and had thrown himself into active engagement with the contemporary affairs of the British at Madras\".\n\nPalk was starting to amass a small fortune, mainly due to Stringer Lawrence putting lucrative deals in his direction, but the directors of the Company soon instructed Palk to confine himself to his religious duties. This did not sit well with Palk and he returned to England. He renounced his clerical vows and on 7 February 1761 married Anne Vansittart, the sister of [[Henry Vansittart]], his wealthy and well-respected colleague in India, whose family home was [[Shottesbrooke Park]] in [[Berkshire]].\n\nWhile back in England, the East India Company was experiencing various trading difficulties in India. At the Company's London Headquarters during discussions concerning who might be able to resolve the problem, one of the members declared: \"Gentlemen, you forget, we have Palk at home\". With one voice the members replied \"The very man!\" Thus Robert Palk returned to India in October 1761 and was invited to serve on the Council of the Company. He was appointed to membership of the Treasury Committee and also served as the Export Warehouse Keeper.\n\nWhen [[George Pigot]] resigned in November 1763, it made way for Palk to take up the post of [[Governor of Madras]]. With his new-found authority Palk entered more deeply into the world of trade, all the time enlarging his personal wealth.\n\nPalk eventually left India in January 1767 at the age of 50, and was well received by both King [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] and the Court of Directors on his return.  Returning to England was not however the end of his involvement with India. He provided introductions and was patron to many who, like himself, went to India with the intention of making themselves a fortune.\n\nHis nephew Jonathan Palk said of his uncle Robert: \n:\"Rectitude of mind and benignity of heart formed the outline of his character. Uncorrupted by the luxury of the East, he was an encourager of bodily and mental exertion, furnishing his friends with the means not of idleness, but of being active for their own good and the good of society. My father was a little farmer with a large family; for him my uncle bought an estate, which enabled him to live a credit to his mother, and respected by his neighbours\".\n\n== Election to Parliament ==\nRobert Palk served as [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Ashburton (UK Parliament constituency)|Ashburton]] in 1767 for [[Wareham (UK Parliament constituency)|Wareham]], between 1768 and 1774 (due to the influence of Calcraft, at the time Secretary for War) and again for Ashburton between 1774 and 1787.<ref>Sutherland</ref> His brother [[Walter Palk]] also served as MP for Ashburton. Despite living in [[Torquay]] and then at [[Haldon House]] near Exeter, he continued his involvement with the parish of Ashburton, where he owned land and supplied the parish church with a new organ.\n\nRobert Palk took a great interest in political matters, especially in matters concerning India and the [[British East India Company]] and mainly supported the government. Palk was a [[British Tory Party|Tory]] in sentiment but resented [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]]'s Act of 1773, for the regulation of the East India Company.\n\nThe Warren Hastings Correspondence in the British Museum contains many letters written by Robert Palk to [[Warren Hastings]] between 1767 and 1782. Hastings was the first Governor General of India and often wrote to Palk back in England. Some of the letters in the ''Palk Manuscripts'' are written by Hastings asking favours of Sir Robert. Diamonds were a key method of sending large sums of money back to England and one letter concerning these is dated March 1770, as follows:\n:\"Fort St. George. Dear Sir, I must trouble you again to desire that you will not sell the diamonds by an advance on the invoice price, which I understand is the usual method, because they are, I am assured, of a superior quality to most sent to England by this ship. You will be pleased therefore to open the bulses, and rate them by their quality when you dispose of them. I am, dear Sir, your most obedient servant, Warren Hastings.\n\n==Baronetcy==\nOn 14 November 1760 \"Robert Palk of Headborough\" received a grant of arms as follows: ''Sable, an eagle displayed argent beaked and legged or a bordure engrailed of the second'' with [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]: ''On a semi-terrestrial globe of the northern hemisphere proper an eagle rising as in the arms''<ref>[[Richard Polwhele|Polwhele, Richard]], ''History of Devonshire'', 3 Vols., Vol.2, London, 1793, p.181, footnote\n</ref> with [[Supporters (heraldry)|supporters]]: ''Two Asian Indians in loincloths and turbans''.<ref>Berry, William, ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bfNfAAAAcAAJ&pg=PT664 Encyclopaedia Heraldica, Or Complete Dictionary of Heraldry]'', Volume 2</ref> His [[motto]] was: ''Deo Ducente''<ref>Polwhele</ref> (\"With God Guiding\").\nHe was made a [[Palk baronets|baronet]] on 19 June 1782 by King [[George III of Great Britain|George III]], in recognition of his efforts in securing India for Britain. He was then admitted by the [[Mayor of Exeter]] as a Freeman of the [[City of Exeter]], a privilege his son and successive heirs retained until 1883.\n\n==Landholdings==\n[[Tor Mohun]]. Palk had intended to build a mansion at Torwood<ref>See 1863 painting by John Wallace Tucker ''Torwood Manor'', collection of Torre Abbey Historic House and Gallery [https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/torwood-manor-146244]</ref> in his manor of [[Tor Mohun]], which he had purchased from Lord Donegal in about 1759, but where he had been unable to purchase various surrounding fields which interfered with the estate.<ref>[[Todd Gray (Devon Historian)|Gray, Todd]] & Rowe, Margery (Eds.), Travels in Georgian Devon: The Illustrated Journals of The Reverend [[John Swete]], 1789-1800, 4 vols., Tiverton, 1999, Vol.1, p.165</ref> The Torwood estate was later developed by his successors into half of the resort of [[Torquay]].\n\n==Marriage and children==\n[[File:AnneVansittart LadyPalk ByReynolds 1761.png|thumb|Anne Vansittart, Lady Palk (died 1788).

She died in 1788, predeceasing her husband by 20 years. By his wife he had one son and three daughters as follows:\n*[[Palk Baronets|Sir Lawrence Palk, 2nd Baronet]] (c. 1766 \u2013 1813), son and heir, whose godfather was General Stringer Lawrence. All future male heirs were named \"Lawrence\" in honour of the General.

According to Robert's own statements, the Palk family was resident at Ambrooke in the late 15th century, which at the time of Robert's birth in 1717 was owned by the Neyle family.<ref>Love, Introduction, p.v</ref> This would therefore appear to discount suppositions in some sources that Robert himself was born at Ambrooke.\n\n==Education==\nHe was educated at Ashburton Grammar School, and was subsequently sponsored by his maternal uncle and godfather Robert Abraham, to attend [[Wadham College, Oxford]], where he graduated in 1739.\n\n==Career==\nPalk was ordained as a [[deacon]] in 1739 at [[Exeter Cathedral]] by Bishop Weston and held two [[Curate|curacies]] in [[Cornwall]] at [[Egloskerry]] and [[Launcells]], before going to London in 1741. During his time in London he attracted the attention and favour of Sir [[Robert Walpole]], generally regarded as the first [[Prime Minister of Great Britain]], under whose auspices he was sent to India.\n\nIn 1747 he was appointed naval chaplain to Admiral [[Edward Boscawen]] on the ''Namura'', bound for India. He arrived at [[Fort St David]] in 1748, at the time when the French were in control of [[Fort St George]] in [[Madras]], and vying with the British for trade supremacy. Initially this rivalry was merely a trade war, with only a minimal presence of armed troops, whose task it was to guard the warehouses. Soon however the situation evolved into armed fighting between the French and British, and eventually the British Government recognised they were at war with France over control of India. General [[Stringer Lawrence]] was given the task of forming an army, and history now remembers him as the \"Father of the Indian Army\". An [[Act of Parliament]] was passed in 1773 which effectively took control of Indian interests away from the [[East India Company]] and its shareholders and placed it into the hands of [[The Crown]].\n\n== Promotion ==\nEarly in 1749 the chaplain at Fort St David, Francis Fordyce, publicly insulted [[Robert Clive]], leading to his dismissal, and replacement by Robert Palk. This important promotion led to disagreements regarding the seniority of Palk over other chaplains. Palk sailed to [[Bombay]] in October 1750 with the intention of resigning his post and seeking [[informal sector|formal employment]] with the East India Company. However, matters were resolved and he was re-instated and returned to Fort St David in March 1751. It was at this time that Palk made the acquaintance of Stringer Lawrence, after which time they remained lifelong friends.\n\nRobert Clive was an army officer in the East India Company and later became Governor of Bengal. He arrived in India almost penniless, and due to his hard work and dedication to the King and the East India Company, he was well rewarded with many opportunities by his mentor, Stringer Lawrence. He later became the 1st [[Baron Clive]] of [[Plassey]] and made a fortune in India greater than Palk or Stringer Lawrence could ever have dreamt of.\n \nIn 1752 Robert Palk was appointed to the lucrative position of \"Paymaster and Commissary in the Field\" to Lawrence\u2019s army. In January 1754 Palk and [[Henry Vansittart]] were appointed to discuss the terms of a peace settlement with the French who  controlled a large part of India. A year later a settlement was reached. A colleague of Palk's in Madras, [[Robert Orme]], noted at that time that \"Palk had long ince given up studies of history and theology and had thrown himself into active engagement with the contemporary affairs of the British at Madras\".\n\nPalk was starting to amass a small fortune, mainly due to Stringer Lawrence putting lucrative deals in his direction, but the directors of the Company soon instructed Palk to confine himself to his religious duties. This did not sit well with Palk and he returned to England. He renounced his clerical vows and on 7 February 1761 married Anne Vansittart, the sister of [[Henry Vansittart]], his wealthy and well-respected colleague in India, whose family home was [[Shottesbrooke Park]] in [[Berkshire]].\n\nWhile back in England, the East India Company was experiencing various trading difficulties in India. At the Company\u2019s London Headquarters during discussions concerning who might be able to resolve the problem, one of the members declared: \"Gentlemen, you forget, we have Palk at home\". With one voice the members replied \"The very man!\" Thus Robert Palk returned to India in October 1761 and was invited to serve on the Council of the Company. He was appointed to membership of the Treasury Committee and also served as the Export Warehouse Keeper.\n\nWhen [[George Pigot]] resigned in November 1763, it made way for Palk to take up the post of [[Governor of Madras]]. With his new-found authority Palk entered more deeply into the world of trade, all the time enlarging his personal wealth.\n\nPalk eventually left India in January 1767 at the age of 50, and was well received by both King [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] and the Court of Directors on his return.  Returning to England was not however the end of his involvement with India. He provided introductions and was patron to many who, like himself, went to India with the intention of making themselves a fortune.\n\nHis nephew Jonathan Palk said of his uncle Robert: \n:\"Rectitude of mind and benignity of heart formed the outline of his character. Uncorrupted by the luxury of the East, he was an encourager of bodily and mental exertion, furnishing his friends with the means not of idleness, but of being active for their own good and the good of society. My father was a little farmer with a large family; for him my uncle bought an estate, which enabled him to live a credit to his mother, and respected by his neighbours\".\n\n== Election to Parliament ==\nRobert Palk served as [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Ashburton (UK Parliament constituency)|Ashburton]] in 1767 for [[Wareham (UK Parliament constituency)|Wareham]], between 1768 and 1774 (due to the influence of Calcraft, at the time Secretary for War) and again for Ashburton between 1774 and 1787.<ref>Sutherland</ref> His brother [[Walter Palk]] also served as MP for Ashburton. Despite living in [[Torquay]] and then at [[Haldon House]] near Exeter, he continued his involvement with the parish of Ashburton, where he owned land and supplied the parish church with a new organ.\n\nRobert Palk took a great interest in political matters, especially in matters concerning India and the [[British East India Company]] and mainly supported the government. Palk was a [[British Tory Party|Tory]] in sentiment but resented [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]]'s Act of 1773, for the regulation of the East India Company.\n\nThe Warren Hastings Correspondence in the British Museum contains many letters written by Robert Palk to [[Warren Hastings]] between 1767 and 1782. Hastings was the first Governor General of India and often wrote to Palk back in England. Some of the letters in the ''Palk Manuscripts'' are written by Hastings asking favours of Sir Robert. Diamonds were a key method of sending large sums of money back to England and one letter concerning these is dated March 1770, as follows:\n:\"Fort St. George. Dear Sir, I must trouble you again to desire that you will not sell the diamonds by an advance on the invoice price, which I understand is the usual method, because they are, I am assured, of a superior quality to most sent to England by this ship. You will be pleased therefore to open the bulses, and rate them by their quality when you dispose of them. I am, dear Sir, your most obedient servant, Warren Hastings.\n\n==Baronetcy==\nOn 14 November 1760 \"Robert Palk of Headborough\" received a grant of arms as follows: ''Sable, an eagle displayed argent beaked and legged or a bordure engrailed of the second'' with [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]: ''On a semi-terrestrial globe of the northern hemisphere proper an eagle rising as in the arms''<ref>[[Richard Polwhele|Polwhele, Richard]], ''History of Devonshire'', 3 Vols., Vol.2, London, 1793, p.181, footnote\n</ref> with [[Supporters (heraldry)|supporters]]: ''Two Asian Indians in loincloths and turbans''.<ref>Berry, William, ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bfNfAAAAcAAJ&pg=PT664 Encyclopaedia Heraldica, Or Complete Dictionary of Heraldry]'', Volume 2</ref> His [[motto]] was: ''Deo Ducente''<ref>Polwhele</ref> (\"With God Guiding\").\nHe was made a [[Palk baronets|baronet]] on 19 June 1782 by King [[George III of Great Britain|George III]], in recognition of his efforts in securing India for Britain. He was then admitted by the [[Mayor of Exeter]] as a Freeman of the [[City of Exeter]], a privilege his son and successive heirs retained until 1883.\n\n==Landholdings==\n[[Tor Mohun]]. Palk had intended to build a mansion at Torwood<ref>See 1863 painting by John Wallace Tucker ''Torwood Manor'', collection of Torre Abbey Historic House and Gallery [https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/torwood-manor-146244]</ref> in his manor of [[Tor Mohun]], which he had purchased from Lord Donegal in about 1759, but where he had been unable to purchase various surrounding fields which interfered with the estate.<ref>[[Todd Gray (Devon Historian)|Gray, Todd]] & Rowe, Margery (Eds.), Travels in Georgian Devon: The Illustrated Journals of The Reverend [[John Swete]], 1789-1800, 4 vols., Tiverton, 1999, Vol.1, p.165</ref> The Torwood estate was later developed by his successors into half of the resort of [[Torquay]].\n\n==Marriage and children==\n[[File:AnneVansittart LadyPalk ByReynolds 1761.png|thumb|Anne Vansittart, Lady Palk (died 1788). Portrait by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]].]]\nOn 7 February 1761 he married Anne Vansittart (died 1788),<ref>Sutherland</ref> daughter of Arthur van Sittart (1691\u20131760) by his wife Martha Stonhouse, daughter of [[Sir John Stonhouse, 3rd Baronet]] and sister of [[Henry Vansittart]] (1732\u20131770), of [[Shottesbrooke Park]] in [[Berkshire]], [[Governor of Bengal]] from 1759 to 1764, his wealthy and well-respected colleague in India. She died in 1788, predeceasing her husband by 20 years. By his wife he had one son and three daughters as follows:\n*[[Palk Baronets|Sir Lawrence Palk, 2nd Baronet]] (c. 1766 \u2013 1813), son and heir, whose godfather was General Stringer Lawrence. All future male heirs were named \"Lawrence\" in honour of the General. His descendant [[Lawrence Palk, 1st Baron Haldon|Sir Lawrence Palk, 4th Baronet]] (1818\u20131883) was created [[Baron Haldon]] in 1880.\n*Anne Palk (1764\u20131791), who in 1786 married [[Sir Bourchier Wrey, 7th Baronet]], of [[Tawstock|Tawstock Court]] in Devon, and  died at the age of 27, leaving three infant children.
