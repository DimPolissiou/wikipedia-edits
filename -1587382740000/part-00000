Saint Michael's was founded in 1904 by the [[Society of Saint Edmund]]. Saint Michael's College grants [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees in over 30 majors to their 1,600 undergraduate students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smcvt.edu/academics/majors-minors-and-curriculum.aspx|title=Majors, Minors, & Programs|website=www.smcvt.edu}}</ref> Housing availability is guaranteed for all four years although about 10% of students, primarily upperclassmen, live off campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smcvt.edu/on-campus/housing-and-dining/living-at-st-mikes.aspx|title=Living at St Mike's|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1889, priests from the [[Society of Saint Edmund]] fled to the United States after [[Anti-clericalism#The Third Republic|widespread anticlericism seized France]]. In 1904, they opened Saint Michael's Institute with an initial investment of $5,000.  Thirty-four students aged 10 to 22 enrolled, with a tuition and board fee of $105. Slowly, the school discontinued its high school program. Gradually, the school transitioned from an academy to a traditional residential college. In 1939, graduate programs were offered for the first time.\n\nSaint Michael's Playhouse was opened in 1947, bringing professional summer theater to Vermont, giving students the chance to work behind the scenes.\n\nBefore the 1950s, classes at Saint Michael's were small, just a few dozen Michaelmen in any class. In the 1950s, the college expanded to hundreds of students per class. To manage the influx of [[GI Bill]] students after [[World War II]], Saint Michael's acquired temporary housing in the form of military barracks from [[Fort Ethan Allen]] in Colchester.<ref>\"Transformation,\" Rev. Ray Doherty, SSE, Celebrating a Century, page 24, 2003. {{ISBN|0-9718323-2-3}}</ref> In the 1950s, the college began a building program that established the red brick architectural style that permeates campus today.\n\nIn the 1950s, freshmen were required to wear a dress shirt, coat and tie to every class and for the evening meal. All dorm students said the rosary before retiring.<ref name=\"bfp090614\"/>\n\nSaint Michael's Applied Linguistics Department was started in 1954, focusing on teaching English to students from around the world.\n\nAbout 130 refugees from the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] came to the college. Most of them, already well-educated, came to learn English.<ref name=\"bfp090614\">Burlington Free Press, June 14, 2009, page 4C. \"Reunion:Class of '50 looks back\". Tim Johnson</ref>\n\nIn April 1970, the Board of Trustees approved a proposal by then-president Bernard Boutin to become a co-educational institution. In 1972, the first four female graduates of Saint Michael's received their degrees.<ref>Celebrating a Century, Saint Michael's College, 2003 {{ISBN|0-9718323-2-3}}</ref>\n\n=== Presidents ===\n# Very Rev.

The Quad is anchored by Durick Library to the west and the Chapel of Saint Michael the Archangel to the east. The three academic halls, Cheray Hall, Jeanmarie Hall, and Saint Edmund's Hall, along with the McCarthy Arts Center line the Quad to the south. The Alliot Student Center and the four underclass residence halls wall the Quad on the north.\n\nAlso located on the main campus are the [[George Jacobs (basketball)|Doc Jacobs]] Athletic Fields, [[Ross Sports Center]] and Tarrant Recreation Center, Founder's Hall, which houses the administrative offices, and the Hoehl Welcome Center, which houses the Admissions office. Standing at the main gateway of the school, admission interviews with prospective students are held in Hoehl.\n\nNorth Campus, one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from Main Campus, features additional residence halls, some apartments, and the Sloane Art Center, which has studio arts facilities for drawing and painting, the photography darkroom, and some classrooms.  Sloane also contains the Knights of the Round Table, a dining hall.\n\nBeginning in 2015, the school began closing many of North Campus's residential areas and sold much of the undeveloped property to University of Vermont's Medical School. This decision reflected the high cost of maintaining the aging housing and high deficits the school was facing. As of Fall 2018 North Campus is partially occupied by small summer programs, but during the fall and spring semesters is used exclusively for parking and art classes.\n\n===Demographics===\nAs of spring 2018, there were approximately 1,600 undergraduate students, about 20% of the students are in-state; of the 80% out-of-state, 2% are international.  Undergraduate students at the college come from 35 states and 17 countries. Saint Michael's has 155 full-time faculty members; creating a 12:1 student to faculty ratio on campus. There are 439 graduate students who attend the college; over 90 percent are from Vermont.\n\n===Sustainability===\n\nSaint Michael's has taken many steps towards sustainability over the years.  It was named the first fair trade school in Vermont.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vpr.net/news_detail/93498/saint-michaels-designated-fair-trade-college/|title=VPR: Saint Michael's College Designated Fair Trade College|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref>  Along with the initiatives in the cafeteria, Saint Michael's has an organic garden<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smcvtfarm.blogspot.com/2013/06/organic-garden-seminar-series.html|title=SMC Organic Garden|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref> that started in 2008 and has grown into a huge project for students and faculty alike.

All campus showerheads and sink aerators are low flow.  Saint Michael's College also took the St. Francis Pledge, a promise and commitment by Catholic individuals, families, parishes, organizations, and institutions to live their faith by protecting the environment and advocating on behalf of people in poverty who face the harshest impacts of global climate change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catholicclimatecovenant.org/the-st-francis-pledge/|title=The St. Francis Pledge|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref>  As part of the college's ban on bottled water, the Office of Sustainability<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smcvt.edu/On-Campus/Green-Campus.aspx|title=Green Campus|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref> has installed several water bottle fill stations throughout campus, allowing students to more easily use their reusable water bottles.  Saint Michael's College has been recycling throughout the campus since 1989 and also takes steps toward improving energy such as the Light Bulb Exchange Program (switching out standard light bulbs for energy efficient light bulbs) and 3 Degree Challenge (lowering temperatures in residence halls and academic buildings) while working to increase the energy and electrical efficiency of campus buildings.  Two most recently constructed campus buildings, The Dion Family Center and Residence Hall Four use geothermal wells to meet the greater majority of their heating needs. Combined with many education programs on energy consumption run by the Office of Sustainability, the college has reduced its carbon footprint by 29% since 2003.  Saint Michael's also offers both [[Environmental Studies]] and [[Environmental Science]] majors and an [[Environmental Studies]] minor for those students interested in further focusing on the environment from the perspective of natural sciences, social sciences, and the humanities.\n\n===Housing===\nStudents at Saint Michael's College live in a variety of different housing facilities.  All housing is single-sex by floor or wing.\n\n====Main campus====\n*Joyce Hall, Ryan Hall, and Lyons Hall are three of the four main quad dormitories.  They consist primarily of doubles, and house the entire freshman class. Some wings are reserved for Honors Housing and GREAT Housing, the alcohol-free living option.\n*Alumni Hall is the fourth dormitory building on the main quad, and houses sophomores and juniors.\n*Cashman Hall, Pontigny Hall, and Canterbury Hall consist of four and eight person suites for sophomores, juniors, and some seniors.  Many suites are reserved for Honors Housing, GREAT Housing, and Ambassador Housing.\n*Hodson and the newest building on campus, Residence Hall 4, are apartment style housing for juniors and seniors.\n*The Townhouses, numbered in series; 100s, 200s, 300s,and 400s, house seniors in apartment-style living. In the summer of 2008, kitchens were added to the 400s in order to accommodate the senior housing initiative.\n\n====Major additions====\n\nThe Dion Family Student Center<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smcvt.edu/On-Campus/dion-family-student-center.aspx|title=Dion Family Student Center|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}</ref> is a $30 million structure creating a new 40,000 square-foot student center and 43,000 square-foot residence hall on campus, completed in the fall of 2013.

Classes are small and hands-on learning is emphasized, with a student to teacher ratio of 12:1<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smcvt.edu/About-SMC/Fast-Facts.aspx|title=Fast Facts -Saint Michael's College|accessdate=June 17, 2013}}</ref>  Saint Michael's houses the following honors: [[Phi Beta Kappa]]; [[Delta Epsilon Sigma]], the Catholic honor society; [[Pi Sigma Alpha]] for Political Science; [[Omicron Delta Epsilon]] for Economics; [[Phi Alpha Theta]] for History; [[Kappa Delta Pi]] for Education; [[Psi Chi]] for Psychology; [[Sigma Xi]] for Science and Technology; [[Pi Mu Epsilon]] for Mathematics; [[Beta Beta Beta]] for Biology; [[Kappa Tau Alpha]] for Journalism and Mass Communication (the only KTA chapter nationwide housed at a small college); and [[Sigma Beta Delta]] for Business, Management and Administration. Four Saint Michael's professors have been named the CASE/Carnegie Foundation Vermont Professor of the Year. Saint Michael's College is accredited by the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]].\n\n===Undergraduate===\nUndergraduate programs include over 30 majors and minors, combined with a liberal studies curriculum and experiential learning requirement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smcvt.edu/academics/|title=Academics - Saint Michael's College|accessdate=June 19, 2013}}</ref> Emphasis is placed on independent study, independent research, internships and foreign study.  Eligible students can also participate in the College's Honors Program.\n\n===Graduate===\nThere are three master's degree programs: Clinical Psychology, Education, and Teaching English as a Second/Foreign Language. There are three post-master's certificates and Vermont teacher licensure programs.

In 1904, they opened Saint Michael's Institute with an initial investment of $5,000.  Thirty-four students aged 10 to 22 enrolled, with a tuition and board fee of $105. Slowly, the school discontinued its high school program. Gradually, the school transitioned from an academy to a traditional residential college. In 1939, graduate programs were offered for the first time.\n\nSaint Michael's Playhouse was opened in 1947, bringing professional summer theater to Vermont, giving students the chance to work behind the scenes.\n\nBefore the 1950s, classes at Saint Michael's were small, just a few dozen Michaelmen in any class. In the 1950s, the college expanded to hundreds of students per class. To manage the influx of [[GI Bill]] students after [[World War II]], Saint Michael's acquired temporary housing in the form of military barracks from [[Fort Ethan Allen]] in Colchester.<ref>\"Transformation,\" Rev. Ray Doherty, SSE, Celebrating a Century, page 24, 2003. {{ISBN|0-9718323-2-3}}</ref> In the 1950s, the college began a building program that established the red brick architectural style that permeates campus today.\n\nIn the 1950s, freshmen were required to wear a dress shirt, coat and tie to every class and for the evening meal. All dorm students said the rosary before retiring.<ref name=\"bfp090614\"/>\n\nSaint Michael's Applied Linguistics Department was started in 1954, focusing on teaching English to students from around the world.\n\nAbout 130 refugees from the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] came to the college.

The Quad is anchored by Durick Library to the west and the Chapel of Saint Michael the Archangel to the east. The three academic halls, Cheray Hall, Jeanmarie Hall, and Saint Edmund's Hall, along with the McCarthy Arts Center line the Quad to the south. The Alliot Student Center and the four underclass residence halls wall the Quad on the north.\n\nAlso located on the main campus are the [[George Jacobs (basketball)|Doc Jacobs]] Athletic Fields, [[Ross Sports Center]] and Tarrant Recreation Center, Founder's Hall, which houses the administrative offices, and the Hoehl Welcome Center, which houses the Admissions office. Standing at the main gateway of the school, admission interviews with prospective students are held in Hoehl.\n\nNorth Campus, one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from Main Campus, features additional residence halls, some apartments, and the Sloane Art Center, which has studio arts facilities for drawing and painting, the photography darkroom, and some classrooms.  Sloane also contains the Knights of the Round Table, a dining hall.\n\nBeginning in 2015, the school began closing many of North Campus's residential areas and sold much of the undeveloped property to University of Vermont's Medical School. This decision reflected the high cost of maintaining the aging housing and high deficits the school was facing. As of Fall 2018 North Campus is partially occupied by small summer programs, but during the fall and spring semesters is used exclusively for parking and art classes.\n\n===Demographics===\nAs of spring 2018, there were approximately 1,600 undergraduate students, about 20% of the students are in-state; of the 80% out-of-state, 2% are international.  Undergraduate students at the college come from 35 states and 17 countries. Saint Michael's has 155 full-time faculty members; creating a 12:1 student to faculty ratio on campus. There are 439 graduate students who attend the college; over 90 percent are from Vermont.\n\n===Sustainability===\n\nSaint Michael's has taken many steps towards sustainability over the years.
