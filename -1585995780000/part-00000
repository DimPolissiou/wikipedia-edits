The [[U.S. Census Bureau|United States Census Bureau]] uses the term '''Asian Indian''' to avoid confusion with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], also known as American Indians.\n\n==Terminology==\nIn the [[Americas]], historically, the term \"Indian\" has been most commonly used in reference to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] of the continents since [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] in the 15th century. Qualifying terms such as \"[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]\" and \"[[India|East Indian]]\" were and still are commonly used in order to avoid ambiguity. The U.S. government has since coined the term \"Native American\" in reference to the indigenous peoples of the United States, but terms such as \"American Indian\" [[Native American name controversy|remain popular]] among indigenous as well as non-indigenous populations.

At the same time, Canadian steamship companies, acting on behalf of Pacific coast employers, recruited Sikh farmers with economic opportunities in British Columbia. Racist attacks in British Columbia, however, prompted Sikhs and new Sikh immigrants to move down the Pacific Coast to [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]], where they worked in lumber mills and in the railroad industry.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Many [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] Sikhs who settled in California, around the [[Yuba City]] area, formed close ties with Mexican Americans.<ref name=\"Thakur\" /> The presence of Indian-Americans also helped develop interest in Eastern religions in the US and would result in its influence on American philosophies such as [[Transcendentalism]]. [[Swami Vivekananda]] arriving in Chicago at the World's Fair led to the establishment of the [[Vedanta Society]].\n\n===20th century===\nBetween 1907 and 1908, Sikhs moved further south to warmer climates in California, where they were employed by various railroad companies. Some white Americans, resentful of economic competition and the arrival of people from different cultures, responded to Sikh immigration with racism and violent attacks.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The [[Bellingham riots]] in Bellingham, Washington on September 5, 1907 epitomized the low tolerance in the U.S. for Indians and Sikhs, who were called \"[[hindoos]]\" by locals. While anti-Asian racism was embedded in U.S. politics and culture in the early 20th century, Indians were also racialized for their anticolonialism, with U.S. officials pushing for Western imperial expansion abroad casting them as a \"Hindu\" menace.

In 1913, the Alien Land Act of California prevented Sikhs (in addition to Japanese and Chinese immigrants) from owning land. However, Asian immigrants got around the system by having Anglo friends or their own U.S. born children legally own the land that they worked on.  In some states, [[anti-miscegenation]] laws made it illegal for Indian men to marry white women. However, it was acceptable for \"brown\" races to mix.

The judge  [[Emile Henry Lacombe]], of the [[Southern District of New York]], only gave Balsara citizenship on the hope that the [[United States attorney]] would indeed challenge his decision and appeal it to create \"an authoritative interpretation\" of the law.

K. Mozumdar]] was also considered \"Caucasian\" and therefore eligible for citizenship. Between 1913 and 1923, about 100 Indians were naturalized.\n\nIn 1923, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind]]'' that Indians were ineligible for citizenship because they were not \"free white persons\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The Court argued that the \"great body of our people\" would reject Indians.<ref name=\"Thind\">Zhao, X. & Park, E.J.W.

Greenwood. pp. 1142. {{ISBN|978-1-59884-239-5}}</ref> Over fifty Indians had their citizenship revoked after this decision, but Dr. [[Sakharam Ganesh Pandit]] fought against denaturalization. He was a lawyer and married to a white American, and he regained his citizenship in 1927. However, no other naturalization was permitted after the ruling, which led to about 3,000 Indians leaving the United States. Many other Indians had no means of returning to India. One such immigrant, Vaisho Das Bagai, committed suicide in despair: \"The return migration was large enough to render questionable the idea of immigration as a one-way system.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAfter the [[Immigration Act of 1917]], Indian immigration into the U.S. decreased. Illegal entry through the Mexican border became the way of entering the country for Punjabi immigrants. California\u2019s Imperial Valley had a large population of Punjabis who assisted these immigrants and provided support. Immigrants were able to blend in with this relatively homogenous population. [[Ghadar Party|The Gadar Party]], an Indian anti-British group with operations in California, facilitated illegal crossing of the Mexican border, using funds from this migration \"as a means to bolster the party\u2019s finances\".<ref name=\"Oxford University Press\"/> The Gadar Party charged different prices for entering the US depending on whether Punjabi immigrants were willing to shave off their beard and cut their hair. It is estimated that between 1920 and 1935, about 1,800 to 2,000 Indian immigrants entered the U.S. illegally.<ref name=\"Oxford University Press\"/>\n\nIndians started moving up the social ladder by getting higher education. In 1910, [[Dhan Gopal Mukerji]] came to UC Berkeley when he was 20 years old. He was an author of many children\u2019s books and won the Newbery Medal in 1928 for his book ''Gay-Neck: The Story of a Pigeon''. However, he committed suicide at the age of 46 while he was suffering from depression. Another student, [[Yellapragada Subbarow]], came to the U.S. in 1922. He became a biochemist at [[Harvard University]], and he \"discovered the function of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an energy source in cells, and developed methotrexate for the treatment of cancer.\" However, being a foreigner, he was refused tenure at Harvard. [[Gobind Behari Lal]], who came to UC Berkeley in 1912, became the science editor of the ''San Francisco Examiner'' and was the first Indian-American to win the Pulitzer Prize for journalism.<ref name=\"Oxford University Press\"/>\n\nAfter WWII, U.S. policy re-opened the door to Indian immigration, although slowly at first. The [[Luce\u2013Celler Act of 1946]] Luce\u2013Celler Act of 1946 permitted a quota of 100 Indians per year to immigrate to the U.S. It also allowed Indian immigrants to naturalize and become citizens of the U.S., effectively reversing the Supreme Court\u2019s 1923 ruling in ''[[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/rootsinthesand/a_lucecellar.html |title=Roots in the Sand&nbsp;\u2014 the Archives |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2013-02-07}}</ref> The Naturalization Act of 1952, also known as the [[McCarran-Walter Act]], repealed the Barred Zone Act of 1917, but limited immigration from the former Barred Zone to a total of 2,000 per year. In 1910, 95% of all Indian-Americans lived on the western coast of the United States. In 1920, that proportion decreased to 75%; by 1940, it was 65%, as more Indian Americans moved to the east coast. In that year, Indian Americans were registered residents in 43 states. The majority of Indian Americans on the west coast were in rural areas, but on the east coast they became residents of urban areas. In the 1940s, the prices of the land increased, and the Bracero program brought thousands of Mexican guest workers to work on farms, which helped shift second-generation Indian American farmers into \"commercial, nonagricultural occupations, from running small shops and grocery stores, to operating taxi services and becoming engineers.\" In Stockton and Sacramento, a new group of Indian immigrants from the state of Gujarat opened several small hotels.<ref name=\"Oxford University Press\"/> In 1955, 14 of 21 hotels enterprises in San Francisco were operated by Gujarati Hindus. By the 1980s, Gujaratis had come to \"dominate the industry.\" An article published by ''National Geographic'' mentions several stories of Gujarati immigrants in the hospitality industry.<ref>{{cite web |last1=BHATTACHARJEE |first1=YUDHIJIT |title=How Indian Americans Came to Run Half of All U.S. Motels |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2018/09/south-asia-america-motels-immigration/ |website=Culture & History |accessdate=9 March 2019 |date=4 September 2018}}</ref> The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional Northern European groups, which would significantly alter the demographic mix in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |title= 1965 immigration law changed face of America |author=Jennifer Ludden |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5391395 |publisher=NPR|accessdate=December 9, 2016}}</ref> Not all Indian Americans came directly from India; some came to the U.S. via [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian communities in other countries]], including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], ([[South Africa]], the former British colonies of [[East Africa]],<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite book|last1=Rangaswamy|first1=Padma|title=Indian Americans|date=2007|publisher=Chelsea House|location=New York|isbn=9780791087862|page=[https://archive.org/details/indianamericans0000rang/page/55 55]|edition=2007 Hardcover Edition.|url=https://archive.org/details/indianamericans0000rang|url-access=registration|quote=gujarati.}}</ref> (namely [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]]), and [[Uganda]], [[Mauritius]]), the [[Asia-Pacific]] region ([[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Australia]], [[Fiji]]),<ref name=\"auto1\"/> and the [[Caribbean]] ([[Guyana]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Suriname]], and [[Jamaica]]).<ref name=\"auto1\"/> From 1965 until the mid-1990s, long-term immigration from Indian averaged about 40,000 people per year.

The implementation of Privatization and liberalization had changed the entire outflow of migrants. The [[Business process outsourcing to India|emergence of Information Technology industry in Indian cities]] like Bangalore and Hyderabad had led to large number of migrations to USA primarily from the erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh in South India. There are sizable population of people from the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Telangana]], [[Gujarat]], [[Punjab]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Kerala]] who have settled in different parts of the United States. Indians comprise over 80% of all [[H-1B visa]]s.\n\nIn the last twenty years, a large number of students have started migrating to the United States to pursue higher education.

The immigration of Indians has taken place in several waves since the first Indian came to the United States in the 1700s. A major wave of immigration to California from the region of Punjab took place in the first decade of the 20th&nbsp;century. Another significant wave followed in the 1950s which mainly included students and professionals. The elimination of immigration quotas in 1965 spurred successively larger waves of immigrants in the late 1970s and early 1980s. With the technology boom of the 1990s, the largest influx of Indians arrived between 1995 and 2000. This latter group has also caused surge in the application for various immigration benefits including applications for green card. This has resulted in long waiting periods for people born in India from receiving these benefits.\n\nAs of 2012, over 330,000 Indians were on the visa wait list, third only to [[Mexican people|Mexico]] and [[Filipino people|The Philippines]].<ref name=\"wait times pdf 2012\">{{cite web|url=http://www.travel.state.gov/pdf/WaitingListItem.pdf |title=Annual Report of Immigration Visa Applicants in the Family-sponsored and Employment-based preferences Registered at the National Visa Center as of November 1, 2012 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=1 November 2012 |work=Bureau of Consular Affairs |publisher=United States Secretary of State |accessdate=5 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217034041/http://www.travel.state.gov/pdf/WaitingListItem.pdf |archivedate=February 17, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn December, 2015, over 30 Indian students seeking admission in two US universities\u2014[[Silicon Valley University]] and the [[Northwestern Polytechnic University]]\u2014were denied entry by [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Protection]] and were deported to India.

At the same time, Canadian steamship companies, acting on behalf of Pacific coast employers, recruited Sikh farmers with economic opportunities in British Columbia.

In 1913, the Alien Land Act of California prevented Sikhs (in addition to Japanese and Chinese immigrants) from owning land. However, Asian immigrants got around the system by having Anglo friends or their own U.S. born children legally own the land that they worked on.  In some states, [[anti-miscegenation]] laws made it illegal for Indian men to marry white women. However, it was acceptable for \"brown\" races to mix. Many Indian men, especially Punjabi men, married Hispanic women and Punjabi-Mexican marriages became a norm in the West.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"Oxford University Press\">{{cite book |last1=CHAKRAVORTY |first1=SANJOY |title=The other one percent : Indians in America |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780190648749}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bhardwaj usn2001.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Mohini Bhardwaj]], [[2004 Summer Olympics]] medalist in gymnastics]]\n[[Bhicaji Balsara]] became the first known Indian-born person to gain naturalized U.S. citizenship. As a [[Parsi]], he was considered a \"pure member of the Persian sect\" and therefore a free white person. The judge  [[Emile Henry Lacombe]], of the [[Southern District of New York]], only gave Balsara citizenship on the hope that the [[United States attorney]] would indeed challenge his decision and appeal it to create \"an authoritative interpretation\" of the law. The U.S. attorney adhered to Lacombe's wishes and took the matter to the Circuit Court of Appeals in 1910. The Circuit Court of Appeal agreed that [[Parsis]] are classified as white.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|title=Postmodernism & a Sociology...(c)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnMon2RiFLAC&pg=PA143|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|isbn=978-1-61075-322-7|pages=143\u2013}}</ref>\n\n[[A. K. Mozumdar]] was also considered \"Caucasian\" and therefore eligible for citizenship. Between 1913 and 1923, about 100 Indians were naturalized.\n\nIn 1923, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind]]'' that Indians were ineligible for citizenship because they were not \"free white persons\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The Court argued that the \"great body of our people\" would reject Indians.<ref name=\"Thind\">Zhao, X. & Park, E.J.W.

Greenwood. pp. 1142. {{ISBN|978-1-59884-239-5}}</ref> Over fifty Indians had their citizenship revoked after this decision, but Dr. [[Sakharam Ganesh Pandit]] fought against denaturalization. He was a lawyer and married to a white American, and he regained his citizenship in 1927. However, no other naturalization was permitted after the ruling, which led to about 3,000 Indians leaving the United States. Many other Indians had no means of returning to India. One such immigrant, Vaisho Das Bagai, committed suicide in despair: \"The return migration was large enough to render questionable the idea of immigration as a one-way system.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAfter the [[Immigration Act of 1917]], Indian immigration into the U.S. decreased. Illegal entry through the Mexican border became the way of entering the country for Punjabi immigrants. California\u2019s Imperial Valley had a large population of Punjabis who assisted these immigrants and provided support. Immigrants were able to blend in with this relatively homogenous population. [[Ghadar Party|The Gadar Party]], an Indian anti-British group with operations in California, facilitated illegal crossing of the Mexican border, using funds from this migration \"as a means to bolster the party\u2019s finances\".<ref name=\"Oxford University Press\"/> The Gadar Party charged different prices for entering the US depending on whether Punjabi immigrants were willing to shave off their beard and cut their hair. It is estimated that between 1920 and 1935, about 1,800 to 2,000 Indian immigrants entered the U.S. illegally.<ref name=\"Oxford University Press\"/>\n\nIndians started moving up the social ladder by getting higher education. In 1910, [[Dhan Gopal Mukerji]] came to UC Berkeley when he was 20 years old. He was an author of many children\u2019s books and won the Newbery Medal in 1928 for his book ''Gay-Neck: The Story of a Pigeon''. However, he committed suicide at the age of 46 while he was suffering from depression. Another student, [[Yellapragada Subbarow]], came to the U.S. in 1922. He became a biochemist at [[Harvard University]], and he \"discovered the function of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an energy source in cells, and developed methotrexate for the treatment of cancer.\" However, being a foreigner, he was refused tenure at Harvard. [[Gobind Behari Lal]], who came to UC Berkeley in 1912, became the science editor of the ''San Francisco Examiner'' and was the first Indian-American to win the Pulitzer Prize for journalism.<ref name=\"Oxford University Press\"/>\n\nAfter WWII, U.S. policy re-opened the door to Indian immigration, although slowly at first. The [[Luce\u2013Celler Act of 1946]] Luce\u2013Celler Act of 1946 permitted a quota of 100 Indians per year to immigrate to the U.S. It also allowed Indian immigrants to naturalize and become citizens of the U.S., effectively reversing the Supreme Court\u2019s 1923 ruling in ''[[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/rootsinthesand/a_lucecellar.html |title=Roots in the Sand&nbsp;\u2014 the Archives |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2013-02-07}}</ref> The Naturalization Act of 1952, also known as the [[McCarran-Walter Act]], repealed the Barred Zone Act of 1917, but limited immigration from the former Barred Zone to a total of 2,000 per year. In 1910, 95% of all Indian-Americans lived on the western coast of the United States. In 1920, that proportion decreased to 75%; by 1940, it was 65%, as more Indian Americans moved to the east coast. In that year, Indian Americans were registered residents in 43 states. The majority of Indian Americans on the west coast were in rural areas, but on the east coast they became residents of urban areas. In the 1940s, the prices of the land increased, and the Bracero program brought thousands of Mexican guest workers to work on farms, which helped shift second-generation Indian American farmers into \"commercial, nonagricultural occupations, from running small shops and grocery stores, to operating taxi services and becoming engineers.\" In Stockton and Sacramento, a new group of Indian immigrants from the state of Gujarat opened several small hotels.<ref name=\"Oxford University Press\"/> In 1955, 14 of 21 hotels enterprises in San Francisco were operated by Gujarati Hindus. By the 1980s, Gujaratis had come to \"dominate the industry.\" An article published by ''National Geographic'' mentions several stories of Gujarati immigrants in the hospitality industry.<ref>{{cite web |last1=BHATTACHARJEE |first1=YUDHIJIT |title=How Indian Americans Came to Run Half of All U.S. Motels |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2018/09/south-asia-america-motels-immigration/ |website=Culture & History |accessdate=9 March 2019 |date=4 September 2018}}</ref> The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional Northern European groups, which would significantly alter the demographic mix in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |title= 1965 immigration law changed face of America |author=Jennifer Ludden |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5391395 |publisher=NPR|accessdate=December 9, 2016}}</ref> Not all Indian Americans came directly from India; some came to the U.S. via [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian communities in other countries]], including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], ([[South Africa]], the former British colonies of [[East Africa]],<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite book|last1=Rangaswamy|first1=Padma|title=Indian Americans|date=2007|publisher=Chelsea House|location=New York|isbn=9780791087862|page=[https://archive.org/details/indianamericans0000rang/page/55 55]|edition=2007 Hardcover Edition.|url=https://archive.org/details/indianamericans0000rang|url-access=registration|quote=gujarati.}}</ref> (namely [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]]), and [[Uganda]], [[Mauritius]]), the [[Asia-Pacific]] region ([[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Australia]], [[Fiji]]),<ref name=\"auto1\"/> and the [[Caribbean]] ([[Guyana]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Suriname]], and [[Jamaica]]).<ref name=\"auto1\"/> From 1965 until the mid-1990s, long-term immigration from Indian averaged about 40,000 people per year.

The implementation of Privatization and liberalization had changed the entire outflow of migrants. The [[Business process outsourcing to India|emergence of Information Technology industry in Indian cities]] like Bangalore and Hyderabad had led to large number of migrations to USA primarily from the erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh in South India. There are sizable population of people from the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Telangana]], [[Gujarat]], [[Punjab]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Kerala]] who have settled in different parts of the United States. Indians comprise over 80% of all [[H-1B visa]]s.\n\nIn the last twenty years, a large number of students have started migrating to the United States to pursue higher education.

The article claimed that during a trial run that lasted almost four years, the card \"was held by an ultra-select group of consumers who numbered fewer than 1,000 around the world.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=An American Express Black Card?|website=luxuryplastic.com|url=http://www.luxuryplastic.com/wall-street-journal-5131988-an-american-express-black-card/}}</ref> Lee Middleton, a spokesman for American Express, confirmed the card's existence to the ''Journal'' and said that it was given to clients who had a \"substantial banking relationship\" with American Express Bank Ltd., the New York parent of American Express's bank subsidiaries in Switzerland. Services included \"dispatching limousines or helicopters for clients, booking their vacations and finding medical care in exotic places.\" Middleton said American Express abandoned the black card in 1987 because the newly introduced Platinum Card offered \"95% of the black card's services.\" \n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = I was waiting for [the crew] to move some cameras, and the crew guy comes up me, he says, \"You got the black card?\" And I go \"No, what\u2019s the black card?\" He says, \"There\u2019s only three in the world. The Sultan of Brunei has one, the president of American Express has one, and I thought you would have the third one.\" Next morning I call the president of American Express.

In a 2018 episode of the [[Netflix]] show ''Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee'', Jerry Seinfeld, who was paid to appear in American Express commercials in the 1990s, claims to have received the first Centurion card after contacting the company's president about the rumored existence of an exclusive black card.<ref>{{cite web|title=The American Express Black Card May Exist Thanks to Jerry Seinfeld|website=cnbc.com|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/11/the-american-express-black-card-may-exist-thanks-to-jerry-seinfeld.html}}</ref> \n\nDoug Smith, the director of American Express in Europe, told the fact-checking website [[Snopes.com]] that there \"had been rumors going around that we had this ultra-exclusive black card for elite customers. It wasn't true, but we decided to capitalize on the idea anyway. So far we've had a customer buy a Bentley and another charter a jet.\" The website lists unverified descriptions of cardholder requests, such as dispatching a motorcycle rider to the shores of the Dead Sea to retrieve a handful of sand and couriering it back to London for a child's school project.<ref>{{cite web|title=Black American Express Card|website=snopes.com|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/black-american-express-card/}}</ref>  \n\nSince its introduction, the Centurion card has only been issued to clients invited by American Express to apply for it. The selection criteria the company uses to identify potential cardholders has been subject to speculation. In most countries where the card is issued, it's made of [[anodize]]d [[titanium]]<ref name=\"Luxury\"/> with the information and numbers [[Laser etching|laser etched]] into the metal.

In \"[[Welcome Back (Mase song)|Welcome Back]]\" (2004), [[Mase]] sings: ''Amex black card / Shopper of the year''.

Other singers including [[Ariana Grande]], [[Beyonc\u00e9]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Bow Wow (rapper)|Bow Wow]], [[Nelly Furtado]] and [[Lil Wayne]] also mention black cards in their song lyrics but not a specific American Express product.\n\n===Film and TV===\n\nThe Centurion card has been used as an on-screen prop. In ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'', [[James Bond]] hands a Centurion card to a travel agent with a private jet chartering company to pay for a flight to Bolivia. The payment is declined by [[MI6]] as the intelligence service seeks to strip Bond of his duties and revokes his credit cards and passports. The Centurion replica used in the film was part of the Bond in Motion exhibition at the [[London Film Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|website=jamesbondlifestyle.com|url=https://www.jamesbondlifestyle.com/product/american-express-centurion-card|title=American Express Centurion Card}}</ref>\n\nIn the pilot episode of the [[USA Network]] medical comedy-drama show ''[[Royal Pains]]'', Tucker Bryant, the young heir to a family fortune earned from inventing the blender, injures himself crashing his father\u2019s Ferrari.

He was known especially for his popular poetry written during the [[Second World War|Second World War]], but he also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse.<ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

'Parton Street Bookshop' in ''Pen Pusher'']</ref> His first published collection of verse, ''Spring Encounter'', came out in 1933 from [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] and gained the attention of [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]] who became a patron. Pudney also wrote for [[The Listener]], and worked as a producer at the [[BBC]], where he produced the radio play ''Hadrian's Wall'' with text by Auden and music by Britten, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 25 November 1937.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IMFZ8a8aNHUC&pg=PT116&lpg=PT116&dq=John+Pudney+Benjamin+Britten&source=bl&ots=MUhRGApbmp&sig=ACfU3U2b1caNszL8RMuBi3jjBlRlW4z0Lw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8-c67k8zoAhUJesAKHRsaDzIQ6AEwCXoECAsQOA#v=onepage&q=John%20Pudney%20Benjamin%20Britten&f=false Warden, C.

He was with the ''[[News Review]]'' from 1948 to 1950, and as a director and literary adviser at the publishing houses Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. His later poetry, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967), took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection published in 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/> Of his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''.\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert, the daughter of [[A. P. Herbert]], the writer and [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] [[Member of Parliament]]. They had two daughters and a son, but were divorced. In 1955 he married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967.

He was known especially for his popular poetry written during the [[Second World War|Second World War]], but he also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse.<ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

'Parton Street Bookshop' in ''Pen Pusher'']</ref> His first published collection of verse, ''Spring Encounter'', came out in 1933 from [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] and gained the attention of [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]] who became a patron. Pudney also wrote for [[The Listener]], and worked as a producer at the [[BBC]], where he produced the radio play ''Hadrian's Wall'' with text by Auden and music by Britten, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 25 November 1937.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IMFZ8a8aNHUC&pg=PT116&lpg=PT116&dq=John+Pudney+Benjamin+Britten&source=bl&ots=MUhRGApbmp&sig=ACfU3U2b1caNszL8RMuBi3jjBlRlW4z0Lw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8-c67k8zoAhUJesAKHRsaDzIQ6AEwCXoECAsQOA#v=onepage&q=John%20Pudney%20Benjamin%20Britten&f=false Warden, C.

He was with the ''[[News Review]]'' from 1948 to 1950, and as a director and literary adviser at the publishing houses Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. His later poetry, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967), took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection published in 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/> Of his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''.\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert, the daughter of [[A.

In 1955 he married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967. That process became a subject for his writing. In 1976 he developed cancer of the throat from which he died a year later in much pain.

Mexican families decorate homes and parties in colors that represent wishes for the upcoming year: red encourages an overall improvement of lifestyle and love, yellow encourages blessings of improved employment conditions, green for improved financial circumstances, and white for improved health. Mexican sweet bread is baked with a coin or charm hidden in the dough. When the bread is served, the recipient of the slice with the coin or charm is said to be blessed with good luck in the New Year. Another tradition is to make a list of all the bad or unhappy events over the past 12 months; before midnight, this list is thrown into a fire, symbolizing the removal of negative energy from the new year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topics-mag.com|title=TOPICS Online Magazine \u2013 ESL/EFL \u2013 Sandy Peters and Thomas Peters|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref> At the same time, they are expressed for all the good things during the year that is ending so that they will continue in the new year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.focusonmexico.com/Mexican_customs_for_the_New_Year.html |title=Mexican customs for the New Year |publisher=Focus on Mexico |access-date=31 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711014410/http://www.focusonmexico.com/Mexican_customs_for_the_New_Year.html |archivedate=11 July 2011  }}</ref>\n\nMexicans celebrate with a late-night dinner with their families, the traditional meal being turkey or pork loin.

Over 200 local and overseas media organizations covered the spectacular that generated a publicity value of more than [[Indonesian rupiah|RP]]1000 million.\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main|\u014cmisoka}}\n[[File:Tokyo Tower in New Year's Eve 2012.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Tokyo Tower on New Year's Eve, 2012]]\nIn [[Japan]], New Year's Eve is used to prepare for and welcome ''Toshigami'' (\u5e74\u795e), the New Year's god. People clean their home and prepare [[Kadomatsu]] or [[Shimenawa]] to welcome the god before New Year's Eve. Buddhist temples ring their bells 108 times<ref name=telegraph/> at midnight in the traditional ''Joya no Kane'' (\u9664\u591c\u306e\u9418). The rings represent the 108 elements of ''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|bon\u014d]]'' (\u7169\u60a9), mental states that lead people to take unwholesome actions.\n\nIn most cities and urban areas across Japan, New Year's Eve celebrations are usually accompanied by concerts, countdowns, fireworks and other events. In [[Tokyo]], the two most crowded celebrations are held at the Shibuya crossing in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] and the [[Z\u014dj\u014d-ji|Zojoji Temple]] in [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]]. People gather around the Zojoji Temple to release helium balloons with New Year's wishes up in the sky and watch the lighting of [[Tokyo Tower]] and [[Tokyo Skytree]] with a year number displayed on the observatory at the stroke of midnight.\n\nThree notable music-oriented television specials air near New Year's Eve. Since 1951, [[NHK]] has traditionally broadcast ''[[K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen]]'' (''Red and White Song Battle'') on New Year's Eve, a music competition where two teams of popular musicians (the red and white teams, which predominantly contain female and male performers respectively) perform songs, with the winning team determined by a panel of judges and televotes. The special is traditionally one of the most-watched television programs of the year in Japan. Although it did air on 31 December from 1959 to 2006, the [[Japan Record Award]]s ceremony, recognizing outstanding achievements in the [[Music of Japan|Japanese music industry]], is held annually on 30 December since 2007 and is broadcast by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]. Since 1996, [[Fuji Television]] has broadcast ''Johnny's Countdown''\u2014a live concert at the [[Tokyo Dome]] organized by the talent agency [[Johnny & Associates]].\n\n===Korea===\nThere are two New Years celebrated in both [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]], which are Lunar New Year and Solar New Year. The Solar New Year are always celebrated on the first day of January while Lunar New Year varies. Sometimes there are some traits that both North and South Korea celebrate, while some traits are celebrated differently or only on one side.\n\nIn both Koreas, they call New Year's Day \uc124\ub0a0 (Seoll-Nal). They eat a special soup called \ub5a1\uad6d (Tteok-Guk) which is a hot soup with thin, flat rice cakes and most of the times, eggs are inserted. The Koreans believe that one would get to earn one age if the soup is eaten New Year's Day. They say if one dares to not eat the soup on New Year's Day, then he or she will lose luck.\n\nMost cities and urban areas in both Koreas host New Year's Eve gatherings. In South Korea, two of the biggest celebrations take place in [[Seoul]]: the ringing of [[Bosingak]] bell 33 times at midnight and fireworks display at [[Myeong-dong]], and an LED laser light show and fireworks display at the [[Lotte World Tower]] in [[Songpa District|Songpa-gu]]. In [[Pyongyang]], North Korea, the chimes of the clock at the Grand People's Study House and the national fireworks display along [[Kim Il-sung Square]], [[Juche Tower]] and the surrounding areas signal the start of the New Year. The celebration in Pyongyang, however, also marks the beginning of the [[North Korean calendar]] or the Juche Year, which is based on 15 April 1912, [[Kim Il-sung]]'s date of birth, the celebrations are more recent in origin with the fireworks displays dating from 2013.\n\nFor 2018-2019, Kim Il-sung Square held its first large-scale public celebration, which featured a concert performance by the state [[Moranbong Band]], midnight fireworks, and a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] light show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nknews.org/2018/12/north-korea-rings-in-new-year-with-midnight-concert-drone-show/|title=North Korea rings in new year with midnight concert, drone show|date=1 January 2019|website=NK News|language=en-US|access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Malaysia===\n[[File:2018 New Year Fireworks in George Town, Penang.jpg|left|thumb|Fireworks in [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Penang]] on 1 January 2018]]\n[[File:MALAM TAHUN BARU (5309956791).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Fireworks in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia]]\n''Ambang Tahun Baru'', a celebration sponsored by the government was held at [[Dataran Merdeka|Merdeka Square]], the field opposite the [[Sultan Abdul Samad Building]] in the [[Malaysia]]n capital of [[Kuala Lumpur]] in the early days.

As a modern tradition, New Year's Eve as well as New Year's Day are public holidays, and are two of the biggest holidays of the year. They celebrate New Year's Eve with their family. It is common, just like in the former Soviet Union, that the [[National Anthem of Mongolia]] is to be played at the midnight hour on television.\n\n===Pakistan===\nNew Year's Eve is usually celebrated with fireworks in big cities (e.g. [[Lahore]], [[Karachi]] and [[Islamabad]]). Musical nights and concerts are also held.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nMany Pakistani youngsters enjoy the type of celebrations held the world over. The elite and educated classes participate in night-long activities in urban and cosmopolitan cities like Karachi, Lahore, and the capital of Islamabad.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Philippines===\nIn the [[Philippines]], New Year's Eve (''Bisperas ng Bagong Taon'') is a special non-working holiday. [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] usually celebrate New Year's Eve in the company of family or close friends. Traditionally, most households would visit the churches and attend year-end service and afterwards, would host or attend a midnight feast called the ''Media Noche''. Typical dishes included holiday fare, ''[[pancit]]'' (for long life) and ''[[Jam\u00f3n|Ham\u00f3n]]''. ''[[Lechon]]'' (roasted pig), is usually prepared, as is barbecued food. Some refrain from serving chicken, as their scratching and pecking for food is unlucky, being an idiom for a hand-to-mouth existence.\n\nMany opt to wear new, bright, or colourful clothes with circular patterns, such as [[polka dot]]s, or display sweets and twelve round fruits as the centrepiece, in the belief that circles attract money and fortune and that candies represent a sweeter year ahead. Several customs must only be done at midnight: some throw about coins to increase wealth in the coming year, or jump to increase their height, while some follow the [[Spanish influence on Filipino culture|Spanish custom]] of eating twelve grapes, one for each month of the year. People also make loud noises by blowing on cardboard or plastic horns, called ''torotot'', banging on pots and pans, playing loud music, blowing car horns, or by igniting firecrackers, in the belief that the din scares away bad luck and evil spirits. [[Bamboo cannon]]s are also fired on the night in some places.\n\nUrban areas usually host many New Year's Eve parties and countdown celebrations hosted by the private sector with the help of the local government. These parties, which include balls hosted by hotels, usually display their own fireworks and are often very well-attended. Within Metro Manila, popular locations for celebrations include the area along [[Manila Bay]] at [[Roxas Boulevard]] or [[Luneta Park]] in [[Manila]], the intersection of Ayala and Makati Avenues in [[Makati City]], [[Resorts World Manila]] and [[SM Mall of Asia]] in [[Pasay City]], [[Quezon Memorial Circle]] in Diliman and [[Eastwood City]] in Libis, [[Quezon City]], [[Bonifacio Global City]] in [[Taguig City]], [[Entertainment City]] in [[Para\u00f1aque|Para\u00f1aque City]], and the [[Philippine Arena]] at [[Ciudad de Victoria]] in [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue]] and [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]], [[Bulacan]].

It is a public holiday. In most cities and urban areas across [[Thailand]], New Year's Eve celebrations are accompanied by countdowns, fireworks, concerts and other major events, notably, the CentralWorld Square at [[CentralWorld]] and the area along [[Chao Phraya River]] at [[ICONSIAM]] and [[Asiatique]] in [[Bangkok]], and the Pattaya Beach in [[Pattaya]], while public places such as hotels, pubs, restaurants and nightclubs, also host New Year's Eve parties by offering food, entertainment and music to the guests, and they usually stay open until the next morning.\n{{-}}\n\n==Europe==\n===Albania===\nPreparations for New Year's Eve in [[Albania]] start with the Christmas tree, which in Albania is known as \"New Year's Tree\" or \"New Year's Pine\".  At midnight, everyone toasts and greets each other and fireworks are lit.\n\n===Austria===\nIn [[Austria]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with friends and family. At exactly midnight, all radio and television programmes operated by [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] broadcast the sound of the [[Pummerin]], the bell of [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]] in [[Vienna]], followed by the ''Donauwalzer'' (\"[[The Blue Danube]]\") by [[Johann Strauss II]]. Many people dance to this at parties or in the street. Large crowds gather in the streets of Vienna, where the municipal government organises a series of stages where bands and orchestras play. Fireworks are set off by both municipal governments and individuals.\n\n===Belgium===\nIn [[Belgium]], New Year's Eve (''Sint Sylvester Vooravond'' (\"Saint Sylvester's Eve\") or ''Oudjaar'' (\"old year\")) is celebrated with family parties, called ''r\u00e9veillons'' in the [[Wallonia|French speaking areas]]. On television, a stand-up comedian reviews the past year after which a musical or variety show signals midnight, when everyone kisses, exchanges good luck greetings, and toasts the New Year and absent relatives and friends with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]. Many people light fireworks or go into the street to watch them. Most cities have their own fireworks display: the most famous is at [[Mont des Arts]] in Brussels. Cities, caf\u00e9s and restaurants are crowded. Free bus services and special New Year's Eve taxis (the ''Responsible Young Drivers'') bring everyone home afterwards.\n\nOn 1 January (''Nieuwjaarsdag'' in Dutch) children read their \"New Year's letter\" and give holiday greeting cards of decorated paper featuring golden cherubs and angels, colored roses and ribbon-tied garlands to parents and godparents, on decorated paper.\n\nBelgian farmers also wish their animals a happy New Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartanplace.com/newyear/newyrcustom/belgium.html|title=Belgian New Year: Sint Sylvester Vooranvond|author= Christine OKeeffe|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Bosnia and Herzegovina===\nNew Year is widely celebrated in [[Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]]. Streets are decorated for New Year's Eve and there is a fireworks show and concerts in all the larger cities. Restaurants, clubs, cafes and hotels are usually full of guests and they organize New Year's Eve parties.\n\nIn Sarajevo, people gather in the Square of children of Sarajevo where a local rock band entertains them. Several trumpet and rock groups play until the early morning hours. At midnight there is a big fireworks show.\n\n===Czech Republic and Slovakia===\n[[File:Prague New Year 2016 fireworks. Happy New Year! (23741249829).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Prague]] New Year Fireworks]]\nNew Year's Eve (''Silvestr/Silvester'') celebrations and traditions in [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] are very similar. New Year's Eve is the noisiest day of the year. People generally gather with friends at parties, in pubs, clubs, in the streets, or city squares to eat, drink, and celebrate the new year. Fireworks are a popular tradition; in large cities such as [[Bratislava]], or [[Prague]], the fireworks start before noon and steadily increase until midnight. In the first minutes after midnight, people toast with champagne, wish each other a happy new year, fortune and health, and go outside for the fireworks.\n\nIn both countries all major TV stations air entertainment shows before and after the midnight countdown, which is followed by the National anthem of each country. The Presidents of the republics gave their [[New Year speech]] in the morning \u2013 the new Czech President Milo\u0161 Zeman renewed the tradition of Christmas speeches. In recent years however the Czechoslovak national anthem is played at midnight, in honor of the shared history of both nations.\n\n===Denmark===\n[[File:CopenhagenNYE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|New Year fireworks over [[Copenhagen]]]]\nPeople in [[Denmark]] may go to parties or entertain guests at home.

Meals should not be completely finished\u2014some food should be left for ancestors and spirits who visit the house on New Year's Eve.\n\nTraditional New Year food includes pork with sauerkraut or Estonian sauerkraut (''mulgikapsad''), baked potatoes and swedes with hog's head, and white and blood sausage. Vegetarians can eat potato salad with navy beet{{clarify|date=January 2012}} and p\u00e2t\u00e9. Gingerbread and marzipan are very popular for dessert. Traditional New Year drinks include beer and mead, but mulled wine and champagne have become modern favourites.\n\n===Finland===\nIn [[Finland]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with family or friends. Late supper is served, often featuring wieners, [[Janssons frestelse]], and potato salad. Some municipalities organize fireworks at midnight. Consumer fireworks are also very popular. A Finnish tradition is [[molybdomancy]] \u2013 to tell the fortunes of the New Year by melting \"tin\" (actually lead) in a tiny pan on the stove and throwing it quickly in a bucket of cold water. The resulting blob of metal is analyzed, for example by interpreting shadows it casts by candlelight. These predictions are however never taken seriously.\n\nThe Finnish Broadcasting Company broadcasts the reception of the New Year at [[Helsinki Senate Square]]. Countdown to New Year is with the [[Helsinki Cathedral]] clock. In the afternoon programme, the German comedy sketch ''[[Dinner for One]]'' is shown every year. On the radio, just before midnight, the poem ''Hymyilev\u00e4 Apollo'' (Smiling Apollo) by [[Eino Leino]] is read.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |title=Eino Leino |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305170013/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |archivedate=5 March 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n===France===\n[[File:Eiffel Tower on the New Year Eve at midnight.webm|thumb|(video) Celebrations in 2014]]\nIn [[France]], New Year's Eve (''la Saint-Sylvestre'') is usually celebrated with a feast, ''le R\u00e9veillon de la Saint-Sylvestre''<ref>\"[https://www.vibescout.com/fr/post/reveillon-du-nouvel le R\u00e9veillon de la Saint-Sylvestre]\" .Vibescout.com.

The celebration can be a simple, intimate dinner with friends and family or, ''une soir\u00e9e dansante'', a much fancier ball.\n\nOn New Year's Day (''le Jour de l'An'') friends and family exchange [[New Year's resolutions]], kisses, and wishes. Some people eat [[ice cream]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/france/new-year-day|title=New Year's Day in France}}</ref>\n\nThe holiday period ends on 6 January with the celebration of [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] (''Jour des Rois''). A traditional type of flat pastry cake, ''la galette des rois'', made of two sheets of puff pastry, filled with ''frangipane'' (almond paste) is eaten. The cake contains a ''f\u00e8ve'', a small china doll; whomever finds it becomes king or queen and gets to wear a gold paper crown and choose his or her partner. This tradition can last up to two weeks.\n\n===Germany===\nIn [[Germany]], parties are common on New Year's Eve. Fireworks are very popular, both with individuals and at large municipal displays. 31 December and the three days leading up to it are the only four days of the year on which fireworks may be sold in Germany. Every year [[Berlin]] hosts one of the largest New Year's Eve celebrations in all of Europe, attended by over a million people. The focal point is the [[Brandenburg Gate]], where midnight fireworks are centered. Germans toast the New Year with a glass of [[Sparkling wine#Sekt|Sekt]] (German sparkling wine) or champagne.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Molybdomancy]] {{lang|de|(Bleigie\u00dfen)}} is another German New Year's Eve tradition, which involves telling fortunes by the shapes made by molten lead dropped into cold water. Other auspicious actions are to touch a chimney sweep or rub some ash on your forehead for good luck and health. [[Berliner (doughnut)|Jam-filled doughnuts]] with or without alcoholic fillings are eaten. Finally a tiny [[marzipan pig]] is consumed for more good luck.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In some northern regions of Germany (e.g. [[East Frisia]]) the making of ''{{ill|Speckendicken|de}}'' (also {{lang|de|Speckdicken}}) is another tradition \u2013 people go door to door visiting their neighbors and partaking in this dish. It looks similar to a pancake, but the recipe calls for either dark molasses or dark syrup, topped with a few [[mettwurst]] slices and bacon strips.<ref>https://www.spezialitaeten-aus-niedersachsen.de/speckendicken.html, accessed 2018-12-25, indirectly citing ''Atlas der deutschen Volkskunde f\u00fcr Loppersum, Kr.

The version traditionally broadcast on German television was originally recorded in 1963, and was occasionally used as filler programming by [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] due to popular demand; in 1972, ''Dinner for One'' received its traditional New Year's Eve scheduling. The sketch, as well as its catchphrase \"the same procedure as every year\", are well known in German pop culture. ''Dinner for One'' is also broadcast on or around New Year's Eve in other European countries, although it is, ironically, relatively unknown in the United Kingdom.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/12/30/bvdinner30.xml | title = Gesundheit to an old favourite | author = Peake, Mike | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= 30 December 2006 | accessdate = 1 January 2007 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=\"slate-dinnerforone\">{{cite web|title=The Mystery of Dinner for One|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2005/12/the_mystery_of_dinner_for_one.html|website=Slate|accessdate=18 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Greece===\nA midnight fireworks display is held over the historic [[Parthenon]] temple in the capital of [[Athens]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-38477734|title=World celebrations ring in new year|work=BBC News|date=2017-01-01|access-date=2020-01-07|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nA common tradition among [[Greek Orthodox]] families is the cutting of a [[vasilopita]] (\"King's pie\" or \"St. Basil's pie\") at midnight.

An ancient tradition in southern regions which is rarely followed today was disposing of old or unused items by dropping them from the window.\n\nDinner is traditionally eaten with relatives and friends. It often includes [[zampone]] or [[cotechino]] (a meal made with [[pig's trotters]] or entrails), and lentils. At 20:30, the President reads a television message of greetings to Italians.\n\nAt midnight, fireworks are displayed all across the country. Rarely followed today is the tradition that consist in eating [[lentil]] stew when bell tolls midnight, one spoonful per bell. This is supposed to bring good fortune; the round lentils represent coins.\n\n===Malta===\n[[Malta]] organized its first New Year's street party in 2009 in [[Floriana]]. The event was not highly advertised and proved controversial, due to the closing of an arterial street for the day. In 2010 there were the first national celebrations in [[St. George's Square]], [[Valletta]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maltanewyearseve.com |title=Official New Year's Eve Street Celebrations Website in Malta |publisher=Maltanewyearseve.com |accessdate=31 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206100908/http://www.maltanewyearseve.com/ |archivedate=6 December 2010  }}</ref> Although professional fireworks are very popular in Malta, they are almost totally absent on New Year's Eve.

Traditional snack foods are ''[[oliebol]]len'' (oil dumplings) and ''appelbeignets'' (apple slice [[fritter]]s).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/netherlands/new-year-day|title=New Year's Day in the Netherlands}}</ref> On television, the main feature is the ''[[oudejaarsconference]]'', a performance by one of the major Dutch [[Kleinkunst|cabaretiers]] (comparable to [[stand-up comedy]], but more serious, generally including a satirical review of the year's politics).

In rural areas, the tradition of [[:nl:Carbidschieten]] (''blasting off footballs or churnlids with [[Calcium carbide]] gas filled milk churns'') is performed instead of lighting fireworks.\n\n===North Macedonia===\nNew Year's Eve is celebrated across [[North Macedonia]]. New Year's Day is celebrated by day-long fireworks shows. The day is celebrated together with family or friends at home or in restaurants, clubs, caf\u00e9s and hotels. During the day-time celebration, children get gifts. Evening celebrations include food, music, and dancing to both traditional Macedonian folk music, and modern music. New Year's Eve is celebrated on 31 December and also on 14 January according to the Macedonian Orthodox Calendar.\n\n===Norway===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nIn [[Norway]] New Year's Eve (''Nytt\u00e5rsaften'') is the second biggest celebration of the year, after [[Christmas Eve]]. While Christmas Eve is a family celebration, New Year's Eve is an opportunity to celebrate with friends.\n\nTraditionally, there is first a feast, commonly consisting of stuffed, roast turkey with potatoes, sprouts, gravy and [[Waldorf salad]]. The accompanying beverage is traditionally beer (commonly either Christmas beer or lager beer). Dessert will often be vanilla pudding or rice cream, and there will be cakes and coffee later in the evening \u2013 commonly accompanied by a glass of cognac. Then, at close to 12 am on New Year's Day, people will go outside to send up fireworks. Fireworks are only permitted to be sold to the general public on the days leading up to New Year's Eve, and only to be launched that night.\n\nDue to the general use of fireworks, more fires occur on New Year's Eve than on any other day of the year in Norway. Accordingly, most Norwegian cities, and many towns, host a large, public fireworks display in order to discourage private use of fireworks in built-up areas. People will then congregate in a central square or similar to watch and celebrate.\n\n===Poland===\nIn [[Poland]] New Year's Eve (''Sylwester'') celebrations include both indoor and outdoor festivities. A large open-air concert is held in the [[Main Market Square, Krak\u00f3w|Main Square]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. 150,000 to 200,000 revelers celebrate the New Year with live music and a fireworks display over [[St. Mary's Basilica, Krak\u00f3w|St. Mary's Basilica]].<ref name=\"onet\">{{cite web|last=\u015awierczek|first=Marcin|title=Tylko w Onet.tv \u2013 sylwester z krakowskiego Rynku na \u017cywo!|publisher=[[Onet.tv]] from Polish Press Agency|location=[[Krak\u00f3w]]|year=2008|url=http://muzyka.onet.pl/10172,1888447,newsy.html|accessdate=31 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117013012/http://muzyka.onet.pl/10172,1888447,newsy.html|archivedate=17 January 2009}}</ref> Similar festivities are held in other cities around Poland.\n\nFor those who do not wish to spend the New Year in the city, the mountains are a popular destination. [[Zakopane]], located in the [[Carpathian Mountains]], is the most popular Polish mountain resort in winter.\n\nAlso, New Year's Eve (''Sylwester'') celebrations are in [[Katowice]], near the [[Spodek]] arena.

The tradition is to drink champagne and eat twelve raisins \u2013 one for each month of the year, making a wish for each. Another Portuguese tradition is a special cake called ''[[Bolo-Rei]]'' (literally: King Cake). ''Bolo-Rei'' is a round cake with a large hole in the centre, resembling a crown covered with crystallised and dried fruit. It is baked from a soft, white dough, with raisins, various nuts and crystallised fruit. Inside is hidden the characteristic ''fava'' ([[broad bean]]). Tradition dictates that whoever finds the ''fava'' has to pay for the ''Bolo-Rei'' next year. Initially, a small prize (usually a small metal toy) was also included within the cake. However, the inclusion of the prize was forbidden by the European Union for safety reasons. The Portuguese brought the recipe of the ''[[Gateau des Rois]]'' from France in the second half of the 19th century. To this day, this recipe is a very well kept secret.\n\nIn [[Lisbon]] the New Year is celebrated with a grand concert. The New Year's Concert is held at the CCB ([[Centro Cultural de Bel\u00e9m]]) on the evening of 1 January, featuring the prestigious Lisbon Metropolitan Orchestra.\n\n===Romania===\n[[File:Vanghelion.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Romexpo]] indoors during ''Vanghelion'' New Year's Eve party.]]\nTraditional celebrations of New Year's Eve (''Revelion'') are the norm in [[Romania]]. Romanians follow centuries-old customs, rituals, and conventions. Children sing \"[[Plugu\u0219orul]]\" and \"Sorcova\", traditional carols that wish goodwill, happiness and success.\n\nParties are common in the evening. Since the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], Romanians have gathered in the [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]] in [[Bucharest]]. Other significant parties occur in [[Pia\u021ba Constitu\u021biei]]. New Year's Eve is also marked by a national all-night telecast on [[Romanian Television]], which also celebrates its anniversary on this holiday, having opened its doors in the New Year's Eve of 1956.\n\n===Russia===\n{{main|Novy God}}\n[[File:S novym godom 2012.ogv|thumb|left|Midnight at Red Square in 2012.]]\nThe most prominent public celebration of the New Year is held at [[Moscow]]'s [[Red Square]] under the [[Kremlin Clock]]\u2014whose chimes at midnight are traditionally followed by the playing of the [[Russian national anthem]], and a fireworks display.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/31/world/russia-unveils-new-national-anthem-joining-old-soviet-tune-older-unsoviet-god.html|title=Russia Unveils New National Anthem Joining the Old Soviet Tune to the Older, Unsoviet God|last=Press|first=The Associated|date=31 December 2000|work=The New York Times|access-date=31 December 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The [[President of Russia|President's]] [[New Year Address by President of Russia|New Year's address]] is traditionally televised shortly before midnight in each time zone, reflecting on the previous year and the state of the country; in 1999, unpopular president [[Boris Yeltsin]] used the New Year's address to announce his resignation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/01/world/yeltsin-resigns-overview-yeltsin-resigns-naming-putin-acting-president-run-march.html|title=YELTSIN RESIGNS: THE OVERVIEW; Yeltsin Resigns, Naming Putin as Acting President To Run in March Election|last=Bohlen|first=Celestine|date=1 January 2000|work=The New York Times|access-date=15 January 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbth.com/arts/2016/12/20/survival-guide-how-to-survive-new-year-russian-style_663723|title=Survival guide: How to survive New Year, Russian-style|last=Zubtsov|first=Vitaly|date=29 December 2016|website=Russia Beyond|language=en-US|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://themoscowtimes.com/articles/the-10-best-places-to-spend-new-years-eve-in-moscow-42618|title=The 10 Best Places to Spend New Year's Eve in Moscow|website=The Moscow Times|language=en|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Secularity|Secular]] celebrations of the New Year in Russia, also known as ''Novy God'', are derived from traditions associated with [[Christmas]]; [[New Year tree]]s (''yolka'') are put up in homes and in public, and [[Ded Moroz]] (''Grandfather Frost'') delivers presents to children for New Year's Day in a similar manner to [[Santa Claus]]. The practices date back to the early 20th century: due to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]'s stance of [[state atheism]] and a larger series of [[Soviet anti-religious legislation|anti-religious policies]], the celebration of Christmas and other religious holidays was widely discouraged. In particular, [[Christmas tree]]s were singled out for originating from [[World War I]] enemy [[Germany]], and being a symbol of the [[bourgeoisie]]. In 1935, Soviet politician [[Pavel Postyshev]] and other high-ranking officials began to promote the concept of New Year trees as a wide, secular tradition\u2014representing happiness and prosperity among youth. Even with the reinstatement of religious holidays after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Novy God has remained a popular celebration in modern Russia.<ref name=\"Father Frost and the Snow Maiden deliver Russia's winter warmer, by Helen Womack, 31 December 1996\">{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/father-frost-and-the-snow-maiden-deliver-russias-winter-warmer-1316564.html| title=Father Frost and the Snow Maiden deliver Russia's winter warmer, by Helen Womack, 31 December 1996| accessdate=12 December 2010| newspaper=The Independent| location=London| date=31 December 1996}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.calvertjournal.com/articles/show/9424/yolka-russia-new-year-tree-pagan-soviet-christmas|title=Yolka: the story of Russia's 'New Year tree', from pagan origins to Soviet celebrations|website=The Calvert Journal|language=en|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"MIG\">{{cite book|title=Echo of Islam|year=1993|publisher=MIG|quote=In the former Soviet Union, fir trees were usually put up to mark New Year's day, following a tradition established by the officially atheist state.}}</ref><ref name=\"Dice2009\">{{cite book|last=Dice|first=Elizabeth A.|title=Christmas and Hanukkah|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438119717|page=44|quote=The Christmas tree, or Yolka, is another tradition that was banned during the Soviet era.

Indoors, families celebrate New Year's Eve with an abundance of food. Serbs decorate trees, ''Novogodi\u0161nja jelka'', at New Year's Eve, rather than at Christmas Eve. Near, or after midnight, Santa Claus (''Deda Mraz'') visits houses and leaves presents under the tree, to be unpacked then or, if the family is asleep, to be discovered in the morning.\n\nSerbian New Year's celebrations take place in [[Belgrade]], and several other major cities such as [[Novi Sad]] and [[Ni\u0161]]. As of mid-December, cities are extensively decorated and lit. The decorations remain until way into January due to the influence of the [[Julian calendar]]. Throughout the region, especially amongst former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] republics, Belgrade is the most popular destination for major parties.\n\nOn 13 January, a large part of the population{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} celebrates \"[[Old New Year|Serbian New Year]]\", according to the Julian calendar. Usually, one concert is organized in front of either City Hall or the National Parliament in Belgrade, while fireworks are prepared by the Serbian Orthodox Church and fired from the [[Cathedral of Saint Sava]], where people also gather. Other cities also organize such celebrations.\n\n===Slovenia===\nIn [[Slovenia]], New Year's Eve is known as a Saint Sylvester's Day (Silvestrovo). Streets are decorated for December. In larger cities like [[Ljubljana]], [[Maribor]], [[Celje]] or [[Koper]] there are concerts, culture programmes and countdowns followed by fireworks. There is also a special programme on national TV. Tradition is that the family comes together and has dinner. At midnight, people toast with champagne, wish each other a happy new year, fortune and health. People have already decorated the Christmas tree before Christmas and children are waiting for the third \"Goodman of December \u2013 Dedek Mraz.\"\n\n===Spain===\n[[File:Nochevieja puertadelsol 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Madrid]]'s [[Puerta del Sol]] on New Year's Eve, 2005.]]\nSpanish New Year's Eve (''Nochevieja'' or ''Fin de A\u00f1o'') celebrations usually begin with a family dinner, traditionally including [[shrimp]] or [[prawns]], and [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[capon]]. The actual countdown is primarily followed from the clock on top of the [[Royal House of the Post Office]] in [[Puerta del Sol]] Square in [[Madrid]]. It is traditional to eat [[Twelve Grapes]], one on each chime of the clock. This tradition has its origins in 1909 when grape growers in [[Alicante]] thought of it as a way to cut down on the large production surplus they had had that year. Nowadays, the tradition is followed by almost every Spaniard, and the twelve grapes have become synonymous with the New Year. After the clock has finished striking twelve, people greet each other and toast with sparkling wine such as [[Cava (Spanish wine)|cava]], [[champagne (wine)|champagne]] or [[cider]]. The song \"Un a\u00f1o m\u00e1s\" by the Spanish group [[Mecano]], is frequently played. The event is broadcast live on major Spanish networks including [[Antena 3 (Spanish TV channel)|Antena 3]] and [[Radio y Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|RTVE]].\n\nEarlier in the evening at around 20:00, there is a 10k run called [[San Silvestre Vallecana]], which starts on [[Paseo de la Castellana]], next to [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium]], and ends at the [[Campo de F\u00fatbol de Vallecas|Vallecas Stadium]].  Professional runners come to Madrid for this 10k.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nAfter the family dinner and the grapes, many young people attend ''cotillones de nochevieja'' parties (named for the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''cotill\u00f3n'', which refers to party supplies like confetti, party blowers, and party hats) at pubs, clubs, and similar places. Parties usually last until the next morning and range from small, personal celebrations at local bars to huge parties with guests numbering the thousands at hotel convention rooms. Early the next morning, party attendees usually gather to have the traditional winter breakfast of hot chocolate and fried pastry (''chocolate con [[churro]]s'').\n\n===Sweden===\n[[File:New Years Eve 2008-2009 -1.jpg|thumb|[[Gothenburg]] fireworks on New Year's Eve, 2008.]]\nIn [[Sweden]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with families or with friends. A few hours before and after midnight, people usually party and eat a special dinner, often three courses. New Year's Eve is celebrated with large fireworks displays throughout the country, especially in the cities. People over the age of 18 are allowed to buy fireworks, which are sold by local stores or by private people. While watching or lighting fireworks at midnight, people usually drink champagne. The Swedish lottery television show ''[[BingoLotto]]'' features a special New Year's Eve edition to commemorate the holiday.\n\n===Switzerland===\nIn [[Switzerland]], New Year's Eve is typically celebrated in private gatherings or public events.\n\nThe final of the [[Spengler Cup]] ice hockey tournament is traditionally held on New Year's Eve.\n\n===Turkey===\n[[File:Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Y\u0131lba\u015f\u0131.jpg|thumb|New Year's Eve decorations in [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]], Istanbul.]]\n[[File:Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131 2010-11 Y\u0131lba\u015f\u0131 S\u00fcslemeleri.jpg|thumb|New Year's Eve decorations in [[Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131]], [[\u0130stanbul]].]]\nNumerous decorations and customs traditionally associated with Christmas and [[Bayram (Turkey)|Bayrams]] are part of [[secular]] New Year's Eve celebrations in [[Turkey]]. Homes and streets are lit in glittering lights. Small gifts are exchanged, and large family dinners are organized with family and friends, featuring a special [[Stuffed turkey|turkey]] dish stuffed with a [[zante currant]], [[pine nuts]], [[pimiento]] and [[dill]] ''[[pilaf|i\u00e7 pilav]]'', [[dolma]], hot [[b\u00f6rek]], [[baklava]], and various other [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish dishes]], accompanied with [[rak\u0131]], [[Turkish wine]], or [[boza]], [[Sharbat|\u015ferbet]], [[salep]], and [[Turkish tea]] or [[Turkish coffee|coffee]]. Even though Turkish people generally do not celebrate [[Christmas]], decorating Christmas trees is a very popular tradition on New Year's Eve in Turkey, and the Turks associate [[Santa Claus]] with New Year's Eve.\n\nTelevision and radio channels are known to continuously broadcast a variety of special New Year's Eve programs, while [[Municipality|municipalities]] all around the country organize fundraising events for the poor, in addition to celebratory public shows such as concerts and family-friendly events, as well as more traditional forms of entertainment such as the [[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat]] [[shadow theatre|shadow-theater]], and even performances by the [[Mehter]]\u2014the [[Janissary]] Band that was founded during the days of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nPublic and private parties with large public attendances are organised in a number of cities and towns, particularly in the largest metropolitan areas such as [[Istanbul]], [[Ankara]], [[Izmir]], [[Adana]], [[Bursa]] and [[Antalya]], with the biggest celebrations taking place in Istanbul's [[Taksim Square|Taksim]], [[Beyo\u011flu]], [[Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131]] and [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]] districts and Ankara's [[K\u0131z\u0131lay Square]], which generally feature dancing, concerts, laser and light shows as well as the traditional countdown and fireworks display.\n\n===Ukraine===\n[[File:Christmas tree in Kyiv, 2019-2020.jpg|thumb|New Year celebration in [[Kiev]]]]\nIn the countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union, New Year's has the same cultural significance as Christmas has in the United States, but without the religious connotations. Ukrainian families traditionally install spruce trees at home, the equivalent of a Christmas tree. Families gather to eat a large feast and reflect on the past year. They have a large celebration, make toasts, and make wishes for a happy New Year. Families give presents to their friends as well as informal acquaintances. As Ukrainians are traditionally a closely-knit community, it is seen as a taboo to not give presents to those the family associates with. Children stay up until midnight, waiting for the New Year. During these celebrations, many Ukrainians tune to special New Year shows, which have become a long-standing tradition for Ukrainian TV. And just before midnight the [[President of Ukraine]] gives his New Year's message to the nation, and when the clock strikes 12, the National Anthem [[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina]] is played in all TV and radio stations as well as in Independence Square in Kiev and other cities where holiday celebrations are held.\n\nThe first New year dish in Ukraine which associates with the New year for every Ukrainian person is the Olivier salad. It has become the main \u00abcharacter\u00bb of many jokes and anecdotes. There are several versions about where the name Olivier comes from, but most people say that it appeared thanks to the French chef Olivier, who lived in the USSR in the 1960s and was the owner of a French restaurant in Moscow. He was the first one to cook this dish.

The unofficial hymn for the first minutes of the New Year is \"A\u00f1o Nuevo, Vida Nueva\" (\"New Year, New Life\"), by the band Billo's Caracas Boys. Many people play the national anthem in their houses.\n\nTraditions include wearing yellow underwear, eating [[Pan de jam\u00f3n]], and 12 grapes with sparkling wine.\n\nSpecial holiday programs are broadcast on Venezuelan television stations including [[Venevision]].\n\n==Asia==\n===Bangladesh===\nThe New Year celebrations take place in all around the country mostly in [[Dhaka]], [[Chittagong]], [[Sylhet]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Khulna]], [[Barishal]], [[Cox's Bazar]] etc. The celebrations mostly take place at night.

The [[Christians]] go to the churches for a watch night service till midnight, praying for blessing in the coming new year as it is also part of the [[Christmastide]] season observances.\n\n===China===\nIn [[China]], although the celebrations of the [[Chinese New Year|Lunar New Year]] are not until a few weeks after the Gregorian New Year, celebrations of the Gregorian New Year are held in some areas, particularly in major cities. For example, celebrations with fireworks and rock concerts have taken place in [[Beijing]]'s Solana Blue Harbor Shopping Park, while cultural shows and other events are held at the city's Millennium Monument, [[Temple of Heaven]], [[Great Wall of China]], [[Olympic Green]], and the [[Summer Palace]]. Since 2011, a light and sound show has been held at [[The Bund (Shanghai)|The Bund]] in [[Shanghai]], a few minutes before midnight.\n\n====Hong Kong====\n[[File:HK NYE.jpg|thumb|Fireworks display in [[Hong Kong]].]]\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], many gather in shopping districts like [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], [[Causeway Bay]] and [[Tsim Sha Tsui]].

For the arrival of 2013, the [[Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre]] initiated the countdown, while the fireworks display and A Symphony of Lights show were extended to eight minutes.\n\nShopping malls are often major celebration venues. The [[Times Square (Hong Kong)|Times Square]] shopping mall, for instance, holds their own celebration of the ball drop held at [[Times Square]], [[New York City]]. There are also various district-wide celebrations.\n\n===Central Asia===\nIn [[Central Asia]], New Year's Eve celebrations were inherited from Soviet traditions; thus they are similar to those of Russia. An example of such traditions would be the playing of the national anthem at midnight and the presidential address before it.\n\n===India===\nIn India as a land of diverse cultures and practices, apart from the Gregorian new year, there is Parsi New Year, Hindu New Year(which might differ from region to region), Muslim New Year, etc. Celebration for culture-specific new years is different from the celebrations of the Gregorian new year. Gregorian new year celebration is mostly by way of parties late night and a working holiday followed by it. Most celebrations for December 31 take place in the major metropolitan cities like [[Kochi]], [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Bangalore]], [[Pune]], [[Ahmedabad]].

Many people across the country also follow old traditions. The[[Christians|Christian]] community often go to church for a watch night service till midnight praying for blessing in the coming new year.\n\n===Indonesia===\nNew Year's Eve celebrations in [[Medan]] ([[Capital city|capital]] of [[North Sumatra]]), included the [[:id:Dunia Terbalik|Dunia Terbalik New Year Countdown Celebrations fireworks]] which was part of the event called \"[[Pelita Harapan University|Medan Pelita Harapan University]] Down Eve Countdown.\" The event, which celebrated the arrival of 2018, attracted 400,000 spectators along both sides of the [[CIMB Niaga]].

People clean their home and prepare [[Kadomatsu]] or [[Shimenawa]] to welcome the god before New Year's Eve. Buddhist temples ring their bells 108 times<ref name=telegraph/> at midnight in the traditional ''Joya no Kane'' (\u9664\u591c\u306e\u9418). The rings represent the 108 elements of ''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|bon\u014d]]'' (\u7169\u60a9), mental states that lead people to take unwholesome actions.\n\nIn most cities and urban areas across Japan, New Year's Eve celebrations are usually accompanied by concerts, countdowns, fireworks and other events. In [[Tokyo]], the two most crowded celebrations are held at the Shibuya crossing in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] and the [[Z\u014dj\u014d-ji|Zojoji Temple]] in [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]]. People gather around the Zojoji Temple to release helium balloons with New Year's wishes up in the sky and watch the lighting of [[Tokyo Tower]] and [[Tokyo Skytree]] with a year number displayed on the observatory at the stroke of midnight.\n\nThree notable music-oriented television specials air near New Year's Eve. Since 1951, [[NHK]] has traditionally broadcast ''[[K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen]]'' (''Red and White Song Battle'') on New Year's Eve, a music competition where two teams of popular musicians (the red and white teams, which predominantly contain female and male performers respectively) perform songs, with the winning team determined by a panel of judges and televotes. The special is traditionally one of the most-watched television programs of the year in Japan. Although it did air on 31 December from 1959 to 2006, the [[Japan Record Award]]s ceremony, recognizing outstanding achievements in the [[Music of Japan|Japanese music industry]], is held annually on 30 December since 2007 and is broadcast by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]. Since 1996, [[Fuji Television]] has broadcast ''Johnny's Countdown''\u2014a live concert at the [[Tokyo Dome]] organized by the talent agency [[Johnny & Associates]].\n\n===Korea===\nThere are two New Years celebrated in both [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]], which are Lunar New Year and Solar New Year. The Solar New Year are always celebrated on the first day of January while Lunar New Year varies. Sometimes there are some traits that both North and South Korea celebrate, while some traits are celebrated differently or only on one side.\n\nIn both Koreas, they call New Year's Day \uc124\ub0a0 (Seoll-Nal). They eat a special soup called \ub5a1\uad6d (Tteok-Guk) which is a hot soup with thin, flat rice cakes and most of the times, eggs are inserted. The Koreans believe that one would get to earn one age if the soup is eaten New Year's Day. They say if one dares to not eat the soup on New Year's Day, then he or she will lose luck.\n\nMost cities and urban areas in both Koreas host New Year's Eve gatherings. In South Korea, two of the biggest celebrations take place in [[Seoul]]: the ringing of [[Bosingak]] bell 33 times at midnight and fireworks display at [[Myeong-dong]], and an LED laser light show and fireworks display at the [[Lotte World Tower]] in [[Songpa District|Songpa-gu]]. In [[Pyongyang]], North Korea, the chimes of the clock at the Grand People's Study House and the national fireworks display along [[Kim Il-sung Square]], [[Juche Tower]] and the surrounding areas signal the start of the New Year. The celebration in Pyongyang, however, also marks the beginning of the [[North Korean calendar]] or the Juche Year, which is based on 15 April 1912, [[Kim Il-sung]]'s date of birth, the celebrations are more recent in origin with the fireworks displays dating from 2013.\n\nFor 2018-2019, Kim Il-sung Square held its first large-scale public celebration, which featured a concert performance by the state [[Moranbong Band]], midnight fireworks, and a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] light show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nknews.org/2018/12/north-korea-rings-in-new-year-with-midnight-concert-drone-show/|title=North Korea rings in new year with midnight concert, drone show|date=1 January 2019|website=NK News|language=en-US|access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Malaysia===\n[[File:2018 New Year Fireworks in George Town, Penang.jpg|left|thumb|Fireworks in [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Penang]] on 1 January 2018]]\n[[File:MALAM TAHUN BARU (5309956791).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Fireworks in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia]]\n''Ambang Tahun Baru'', a celebration sponsored by the government was held at [[Dataran Merdeka|Merdeka Square]], the field opposite the [[Sultan Abdul Samad Building]] in the [[Malaysia]]n capital of [[Kuala Lumpur]] in the early days.

[[Filipino people|Filipinos]] usually celebrate New Year's Eve in the company of family or close friends. Traditionally, most households would visit the churches and attend year-end service and afterwards, would host or attend a midnight feast called the ''Media Noche''. Typical dishes included holiday fare, ''[[pancit]]'' (for long life) and ''[[Jam\u00f3n|Ham\u00f3n]]''. ''[[Lechon]]'' (roasted pig), is usually prepared, as is barbecued food. Some refrain from serving chicken, as their scratching and pecking for food is unlucky, being an idiom for a hand-to-mouth existence.\n\nMany opt to wear new, bright, or colourful clothes with circular patterns, such as [[polka dot]]s, or display sweets and twelve round fruits as the centrepiece, in the belief that circles attract money and fortune and that candies represent a sweeter year ahead. Several customs must only be done at midnight: some throw about coins to increase wealth in the coming year, or jump to increase their height, while some follow the [[Spanish influence on Filipino culture|Spanish custom]] of eating twelve grapes, one for each month of the year. People also make loud noises by blowing on cardboard or plastic horns, called ''torotot'', banging on pots and pans, playing loud music, blowing car horns, or by igniting firecrackers, in the belief that the din scares away bad luck and evil spirits. [[Bamboo cannon]]s are also fired on the night in some places.\n\nUrban areas usually host many New Year's Eve parties and countdown celebrations hosted by the private sector with the help of the local government. These parties, which include balls hosted by hotels, usually display their own fireworks and are often very well-attended. Within Metro Manila, popular locations for celebrations include the area along [[Manila Bay]] at [[Roxas Boulevard]] or [[Luneta Park]] in [[Manila]], the intersection of Ayala and Makati Avenues in [[Makati City]], [[Resorts World Manila]] and [[SM Mall of Asia]] in [[Pasay City]], [[Quezon Memorial Circle]] in Diliman and [[Eastwood City]] in Libis, [[Quezon City]], [[Bonifacio Global City]] in [[Taguig City]], [[Entertainment City]] in [[Para\u00f1aque|Para\u00f1aque City]], and the [[Philippine Arena]] at [[Ciudad de Victoria]] in [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue]] and [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]], [[Bulacan]]. Fireworks displays are also held in select cities in the regions.\n\n===Singapore===\n[[File:DSC 4864 2012 New Year Fireworks.jpg|thumb|A midnight fireworks show in [[Marina Bay, Singapore]], welcoming 2012.]]\n\nNew Year's celebrations in the city-state of [[Singapore]] are centered upon [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]], which hosts a midnight fireworks show organized by the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]].

It is a public holiday. In most cities and urban areas across [[Thailand]], New Year's Eve celebrations are accompanied by countdowns, fireworks, concerts and other major events, notably, the CentralWorld Square at [[CentralWorld]] and the area along [[Chao Phraya River]] at [[ICONSIAM]] and [[Asiatique]] in [[Bangkok]], and the Pattaya Beach in [[Pattaya]], while public places such as hotels, pubs, restaurants and nightclubs, also host New Year's Eve parties by offering food, entertainment and music to the guests, and they usually stay open until the next morning.\n{{-}}\n\n==Europe==\n===Albania===\nPreparations for New Year's Eve in [[Albania]] start with the Christmas tree, which in Albania is known as \"New Year's Tree\" or \"New Year's Pine\".  At midnight, everyone toasts and greets each other and fireworks are lit.\n\n===Austria===\nIn [[Austria]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with friends and family.

Many people dance to this at parties or in the street. Large crowds gather in the streets of Vienna, where the municipal government organises a series of stages where bands and orchestras play. Fireworks are set off by both municipal governments and individuals.\n\n===Belgium===\nIn [[Belgium]], New Year's Eve (''Sint Sylvester Vooravond'' (\"Saint Sylvester's Eve\") or ''Oudjaar'' (\"old year\")) is celebrated with family parties, called ''r\u00e9veillons'' in the [[Wallonia|French speaking areas]]. On television, a stand-up comedian reviews the past year after which a musical or variety show signals midnight, when everyone kisses, exchanges good luck greetings, and toasts the New Year and absent relatives and friends with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]. Many people light fireworks or go into the street to watch them. Most cities have their own fireworks display: the most famous is at [[Mont des Arts]] in Brussels. Cities, caf\u00e9s and restaurants are crowded. Free bus services and special New Year's Eve taxis (the ''Responsible Young Drivers'') bring everyone home afterwards.\n\nOn 1 January (''Nieuwjaarsdag'' in Dutch) children read their \"New Year's letter\" and give holiday greeting cards of decorated paper featuring golden cherubs and angels, colored roses and ribbon-tied garlands to parents and godparents, on decorated paper.\n\nBelgian farmers also wish their animals a happy New Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartanplace.com/newyear/newyrcustom/belgium.html|title=Belgian New Year: Sint Sylvester Vooranvond|author= Christine OKeeffe|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Bosnia and Herzegovina===\nNew Year is widely celebrated in [[Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]].

(23741249829).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Prague]] New Year Fireworks]]\nNew Year's Eve (''Silvestr/Silvester'') celebrations and traditions in [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] are very similar. New Year's Eve is the noisiest day of the year. People generally gather with friends at parties, in pubs, clubs, in the streets, or city squares to eat, drink, and celebrate the new year. Fireworks are a popular tradition; in large cities such as [[Bratislava]], or [[Prague]], the fireworks start before noon and steadily increase until midnight. In the first minutes after midnight, people toast with champagne, wish each other a happy new year, fortune and health, and go outside for the fireworks.\n\nIn both countries all major TV stations air entertainment shows before and after the midnight countdown, which is followed by the National anthem of each country. The Presidents of the republics gave their [[New Year speech]] in the morning \u2013 the new Czech President Milo\u0161 Zeman renewed the tradition of Christmas speeches. In recent years however the Czechoslovak national anthem is played at midnight, in honor of the shared history of both nations.\n\n===Denmark===\n[[File:CopenhagenNYE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|New Year fireworks over [[Copenhagen]]]]\nPeople in [[Denmark]] may go to parties or entertain guests at home.

Meals should not be completely finished\u2014some food should be left for ancestors and spirits who visit the house on New Year's Eve.\n\nTraditional New Year food includes pork with sauerkraut or Estonian sauerkraut (''mulgikapsad''), baked potatoes and swedes with hog's head, and white and blood sausage. Vegetarians can eat potato salad with navy beet{{clarify|date=January 2012}} and p\u00e2t\u00e9. Gingerbread and marzipan are very popular for dessert. Traditional New Year drinks include beer and mead, but mulled wine and champagne have become modern favourites.\n\n===Finland===\nIn [[Finland]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with family or friends. Late supper is served, often featuring wieners, [[Janssons frestelse]], and potato salad. Some municipalities organize fireworks at midnight. Consumer fireworks are also very popular. A Finnish tradition is [[molybdomancy]] \u2013 to tell the fortunes of the New Year by melting \"tin\" (actually lead) in a tiny pan on the stove and throwing it quickly in a bucket of cold water. The resulting blob of metal is analyzed, for example by interpreting shadows it casts by candlelight. These predictions are however never taken seriously.\n\nThe Finnish Broadcasting Company broadcasts the reception of the New Year at [[Helsinki Senate Square]]. Countdown to New Year is with the [[Helsinki Cathedral]] clock. In the afternoon programme, the German comedy sketch ''[[Dinner for One]]'' is shown every year. On the radio, just before midnight, the poem ''Hymyilev\u00e4 Apollo'' (Smiling Apollo) by [[Eino Leino]] is read.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |title=Eino Leino |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305170013/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |archivedate=5 March 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n===France===\n[[File:Eiffel Tower on the New Year Eve at midnight.webm|thumb|(video) Celebrations in 2014]]\nIn [[France]], New Year's Eve (''la Saint-Sylvestre'') is usually celebrated with a feast, ''le R\u00e9veillon de la Saint-Sylvestre''<ref>\"[https://www.vibescout.com/fr/post/reveillon-du-nouvel le R\u00e9veillon de la Saint-Sylvestre]\" .Vibescout.com.

Some people eat [[ice cream]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/france/new-year-day|title=New Year's Day in France}}</ref>\n\nThe holiday period ends on 6 January with the celebration of [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] (''Jour des Rois''). A traditional type of flat pastry cake, ''la galette des rois'', made of two sheets of puff pastry, filled with ''frangipane'' (almond paste) is eaten. The cake contains a ''f\u00e8ve'', a small china doll; whomever finds it becomes king or queen and gets to wear a gold paper crown and choose his or her partner. This tradition can last up to two weeks.\n\n===Germany===\nIn [[Germany]], parties are common on New Year's Eve. Fireworks are very popular, both with individuals and at large municipal displays. 31 December and the three days leading up to it are the only four days of the year on which fireworks may be sold in Germany. Every year [[Berlin]] hosts one of the largest New Year's Eve celebrations in all of Europe, attended by over a million people. The focal point is the [[Brandenburg Gate]], where midnight fireworks are centered. Germans toast the New Year with a glass of [[Sparkling wine#Sekt|Sekt]] (German sparkling wine) or champagne.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Molybdomancy]] {{lang|de|(Bleigie\u00dfen)}} is another German New Year's Eve tradition, which involves telling fortunes by the shapes made by molten lead dropped into cold water. Other auspicious actions are to touch a chimney sweep or rub some ash on your forehead for good luck and health. [[Berliner (doughnut)|Jam-filled doughnuts]] with or without alcoholic fillings are eaten. Finally a tiny [[marzipan pig]] is consumed for more good luck.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In some northern regions of Germany (e.g. [[East Frisia]]) the making of ''{{ill|Speckendicken|de}}'' (also {{lang|de|Speckdicken}}) is another tradition \u2013 people go door to door visiting their neighbors and partaking in this dish.

The version traditionally broadcast on German television was originally recorded in 1963, and was occasionally used as filler programming by [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] due to popular demand; in 1972, ''Dinner for One'' received its traditional New Year's Eve scheduling. The sketch, as well as its catchphrase \"the same procedure as every year\", are well known in German pop culture. ''Dinner for One'' is also broadcast on or around New Year's Eve in other European countries, although it is, ironically, relatively unknown in the United Kingdom.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/12/30/bvdinner30.xml | title = Gesundheit to an old favourite | author = Peake, Mike | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= 30 December 2006 | accessdate = 1 January 2007 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=\"slate-dinnerforone\">{{cite web|title=The Mystery of Dinner for One|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2005/12/the_mystery_of_dinner_for_one.html|website=Slate|accessdate=18 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Greece===\nA midnight fireworks display is held over the historic [[Parthenon]] temple in the capital of [[Athens]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-38477734|title=World celebrations ring in new year|work=BBC News|date=2017-01-01|access-date=2020-01-07|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nA common tradition among [[Greek Orthodox]] families is the cutting of a [[vasilopita]] (\"King's pie\" or \"St. Basil's pie\") at midnight.

Dessert will often be vanilla pudding or rice cream, and there will be cakes and coffee later in the evening \u2013 commonly accompanied by a glass of cognac. Then, at close to 12 am on New Year's Day, people will go outside to send up fireworks. Fireworks are only permitted to be sold to the general public on the days leading up to New Year's Eve, and only to be launched that night.\n\nDue to the general use of fireworks, more fires occur on New Year's Eve than on any other day of the year in Norway. Accordingly, most Norwegian cities, and many towns, host a large, public fireworks display in order to discourage private use of fireworks in built-up areas. People will then congregate in a central square or similar to watch and celebrate.\n\n===Poland===\nIn [[Poland]] New Year's Eve (''Sylwester'') celebrations include both indoor and outdoor festivities. A large open-air concert is held in the [[Main Market Square, Krak\u00f3w|Main Square]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. 150,000 to 200,000 revelers celebrate the New Year with live music and a fireworks display over [[St. Mary's Basilica, Krak\u00f3w|St. Mary's Basilica]].<ref name=\"onet\">{{cite web|last=\u015awierczek|first=Marcin|title=Tylko w Onet.tv \u2013 sylwester z krakowskiego Rynku na \u017cywo!|publisher=[[Onet.tv]] from Polish Press Agency|location=[[Krak\u00f3w]]|year=2008|url=http://muzyka.onet.pl/10172,1888447,newsy.html|accessdate=31 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117013012/http://muzyka.onet.pl/10172,1888447,newsy.html|archivedate=17 January 2009}}</ref> Similar festivities are held in other cities around Poland.\n\nFor those who do not wish to spend the New Year in the city, the mountains are a popular destination. [[Zakopane]], located in the [[Carpathian Mountains]], is the most popular Polish mountain resort in winter.\n\nAlso, New Year's Eve (''Sylwester'') celebrations are in [[Katowice]], near the [[Spodek]] arena. In [[S\u0142awatycze]], people tour the streets dressed up as bearded men.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/year-eve-celebrated-world-171228130120603.html|title=New Year's Eve 2017: How the world celebrates today|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=31 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nMajor television networks broadcast the events live all across the country on New Year's Eve like [[Polsat]] and [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]].\n\n===Portugal===\nIn [[Portugal]] the New Year celebration is taken very seriously. The tradition is to drink champagne and eat twelve raisins \u2013 one for each month of the year, making a wish for each. Another Portuguese tradition is a special cake called ''[[Bolo-Rei]]'' (literally: King Cake). ''Bolo-Rei'' is a round cake with a large hole in the centre, resembling a crown covered with crystallised and dried fruit. It is baked from a soft, white dough, with raisins, various nuts and crystallised fruit. Inside is hidden the characteristic ''fava'' ([[broad bean]]). Tradition dictates that whoever finds the ''fava'' has to pay for the ''Bolo-Rei'' next year. Initially, a small prize (usually a small metal toy) was also included within the cake. However, the inclusion of the prize was forbidden by the European Union for safety reasons. The Portuguese brought the recipe of the ''[[Gateau des Rois]]'' from France in the second half of the 19th century. To this day, this recipe is a very well kept secret.\n\nIn [[Lisbon]] the New Year is celebrated with a grand concert. The New Year's Concert is held at the CCB ([[Centro Cultural de Bel\u00e9m]]) on the evening of 1 January, featuring the prestigious Lisbon Metropolitan Orchestra.\n\n===Romania===\n[[File:Vanghelion.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Romexpo]] indoors during ''Vanghelion'' New Year's Eve party.]]\nTraditional celebrations of New Year's Eve (''Revelion'') are the norm in [[Romania]]. Romanians follow centuries-old customs, rituals, and conventions. Children sing \"[[Plugu\u0219orul]]\" and \"Sorcova\", traditional carols that wish goodwill, happiness and success.\n\nParties are common in the evening. Since the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], Romanians have gathered in the [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]] in [[Bucharest]]. Other significant parties occur in [[Pia\u021ba Constitu\u021biei]]. New Year's Eve is also marked by a national all-night telecast on [[Romanian Television]], which also celebrates its anniversary on this holiday, having opened its doors in the New Year's Eve of 1956.\n\n===Russia===\n{{main|Novy God}}\n[[File:S novym godom 2012.ogv|thumb|left|Midnight at Red Square in 2012.]]\nThe most prominent public celebration of the New Year is held at [[Moscow]]'s [[Red Square]] under the [[Kremlin Clock]]\u2014whose chimes at midnight are traditionally followed by the playing of the [[Russian national anthem]], and a fireworks display.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/31/world/russia-unveils-new-national-anthem-joining-old-soviet-tune-older-unsoviet-god.html|title=Russia Unveils New National Anthem Joining the Old Soviet Tune to the Older, Unsoviet God|last=Press|first=The Associated|date=31 December 2000|work=The New York Times|access-date=31 December 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The [[President of Russia|President's]] [[New Year Address by President of Russia|New Year's address]] is traditionally televised shortly before midnight in each time zone, reflecting on the previous year and the state of the country; in 1999, unpopular president [[Boris Yeltsin]] used the New Year's address to announce his resignation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/01/world/yeltsin-resigns-overview-yeltsin-resigns-naming-putin-acting-president-run-march.html|title=YELTSIN RESIGNS: THE OVERVIEW; Yeltsin Resigns, Naming Putin as Acting President To Run in March Election|last=Bohlen|first=Celestine|date=1 January 2000|work=The New York Times|access-date=15 January 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbth.com/arts/2016/12/20/survival-guide-how-to-survive-new-year-russian-style_663723|title=Survival guide: How to survive New Year, Russian-style|last=Zubtsov|first=Vitaly|date=29 December 2016|website=Russia Beyond|language=en-US|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://themoscowtimes.com/articles/the-10-best-places-to-spend-new-years-eve-in-moscow-42618|title=The 10 Best Places to Spend New Year's Eve in Moscow|website=The Moscow Times|language=en|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Secularity|Secular]] celebrations of the New Year in Russia, also known as ''Novy God'', are derived from traditions associated with [[Christmas]]; [[New Year tree]]s (''yolka'') are put up in homes and in public, and [[Ded Moroz]] (''Grandfather Frost'') delivers presents to children for New Year's Day in a similar manner to [[Santa Claus]]. The practices date back to the early 20th century: due to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]'s stance of [[state atheism]] and a larger series of [[Soviet anti-religious legislation|anti-religious policies]], the celebration of Christmas and other religious holidays was widely discouraged. In particular, [[Christmas tree]]s were singled out for originating from [[World War I]] enemy [[Germany]], and being a symbol of the [[bourgeoisie]]. In 1935, Soviet politician [[Pavel Postyshev]] and other high-ranking officials began to promote the concept of New Year trees as a wide, secular tradition\u2014representing happiness and prosperity among youth. Even with the reinstatement of religious holidays after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Novy God has remained a popular celebration in modern Russia.<ref name=\"Father Frost and the Snow Maiden deliver Russia's winter warmer, by Helen Womack, 31 December 1996\">{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/father-frost-and-the-snow-maiden-deliver-russias-winter-warmer-1316564.html| title=Father Frost and the Snow Maiden deliver Russia's winter warmer, by Helen Womack, 31 December 1996| accessdate=12 December 2010| newspaper=The Independent| location=London| date=31 December 1996}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.calvertjournal.com/articles/show/9424/yolka-russia-new-year-tree-pagan-soviet-christmas|title=Yolka: the story of Russia's 'New Year tree', from pagan origins to Soviet celebrations|website=The Calvert Journal|language=en|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"MIG\">{{cite book|title=Echo of Islam|year=1993|publisher=MIG|quote=In the former Soviet Union, fir trees were usually put up to mark New Year's day, following a tradition established by the officially atheist state.}}</ref><ref name=\"Dice2009\">{{cite book|last=Dice|first=Elizabeth A.|title=Christmas and Hanukkah|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438119717|page=44|quote=The Christmas tree, or Yolka, is another tradition that was banned during the Soviet era.

Indoors, families celebrate New Year's Eve with an abundance of food. Serbs decorate trees, ''Novogodi\u0161nja jelka'', at New Year's Eve, rather than at Christmas Eve. Near, or after midnight, Santa Claus (''Deda Mraz'') visits houses and leaves presents under the tree, to be unpacked then or, if the family is asleep, to be discovered in the morning.\n\nSerbian New Year's celebrations take place in [[Belgrade]], and several other major cities such as [[Novi Sad]] and [[Ni\u0161]]. As of mid-December, cities are extensively decorated and lit. The decorations remain until way into January due to the influence of the [[Julian calendar]]. Throughout the region, especially amongst former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] republics, Belgrade is the most popular destination for major parties.\n\nOn 13 January, a large part of the population{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} celebrates \"[[Old New Year|Serbian New Year]]\", according to the Julian calendar. Usually, one concert is organized in front of either City Hall or the National Parliament in Belgrade, while fireworks are prepared by the Serbian Orthodox Church and fired from the [[Cathedral of Saint Sava]], where people also gather. Other cities also organize such celebrations.\n\n===Slovenia===\nIn [[Slovenia]], New Year's Eve is known as a Saint Sylvester's Day (Silvestrovo). Streets are decorated for December. In larger cities like [[Ljubljana]], [[Maribor]], [[Celje]] or [[Koper]] there are concerts, culture programmes and countdowns followed by fireworks. There is also a special programme on national TV. Tradition is that the family comes together and has dinner. At midnight, people toast with champagne, wish each other a happy new year, fortune and health. People have already decorated the Christmas tree before Christmas and children are waiting for the third \"Goodman of December \u2013 Dedek Mraz.\"\n\n===Spain===\n[[File:Nochevieja puertadelsol 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Madrid]]'s [[Puerta del Sol]] on New Year's Eve, 2005.]]\nSpanish New Year's Eve (''Nochevieja'' or ''Fin de A\u00f1o'') celebrations usually begin with a family dinner, traditionally including [[shrimp]] or [[prawns]], and [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[capon]]. The actual countdown is primarily followed from the clock on top of the [[Royal House of the Post Office]] in [[Puerta del Sol]] Square in [[Madrid]]. It is traditional to eat [[Twelve Grapes]], one on each chime of the clock. This tradition has its origins in 1909 when grape growers in [[Alicante]] thought of it as a way to cut down on the large production surplus they had had that year. Nowadays, the tradition is followed by almost every Spaniard, and the twelve grapes have become synonymous with the New Year. After the clock has finished striking twelve, people greet each other and toast with sparkling wine such as [[Cava (Spanish wine)|cava]], [[champagne (wine)|champagne]] or [[cider]]. The song \"Un a\u00f1o m\u00e1s\" by the Spanish group [[Mecano]], is frequently played. The event is broadcast live on major Spanish networks including [[Antena 3 (Spanish TV channel)|Antena 3]] and [[Radio y Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|RTVE]].\n\nEarlier in the evening at around 20:00, there is a 10k run called [[San Silvestre Vallecana]], which starts on [[Paseo de la Castellana]], next to [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium]], and ends at the [[Campo de F\u00fatbol de Vallecas|Vallecas Stadium]].  Professional runners come to Madrid for this 10k.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nAfter the family dinner and the grapes, many young people attend ''cotillones de nochevieja'' parties (named for the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''cotill\u00f3n'', which refers to party supplies like confetti, party blowers, and party hats) at pubs, clubs, and similar places. Parties usually last until the next morning and range from small, personal celebrations at local bars to huge parties with guests numbering the thousands at hotel convention rooms. Early the next morning, party attendees usually gather to have the traditional winter breakfast of hot chocolate and fried pastry (''chocolate con [[churro]]s'').\n\n===Sweden===\n[[File:New Years Eve 2008-2009 -1.jpg|thumb|[[Gothenburg]] fireworks on New Year's Eve, 2008.]]\nIn [[Sweden]], New Year's Eve is usually celebrated with families or with friends. A few hours before and after midnight, people usually party and eat a special dinner, often three courses. New Year's Eve is celebrated with large fireworks displays throughout the country, especially in the cities. People over the age of 18 are allowed to buy fireworks, which are sold by local stores or by private people. While watching or lighting fireworks at midnight, people usually drink champagne. The Swedish lottery television show ''[[BingoLotto]]'' features a special New Year's Eve edition to commemorate the holiday.\n\n===Switzerland===\nIn [[Switzerland]], New Year's Eve is typically celebrated in private gatherings or public events.\n\nThe final of the [[Spengler Cup]] ice hockey tournament is traditionally held on New Year's Eve.\n\n===Turkey===\n[[File:Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Y\u0131lba\u015f\u0131.jpg|thumb|New Year's Eve decorations in [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]], Istanbul.]]\n[[File:Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131 2010-11 Y\u0131lba\u015f\u0131 S\u00fcslemeleri.jpg|thumb|New Year's Eve decorations in [[Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131]], [[\u0130stanbul]].]]\nNumerous decorations and customs traditionally associated with Christmas and [[Bayram (Turkey)|Bayrams]] are part of [[secular]] New Year's Eve celebrations in [[Turkey]]. Homes and streets are lit in glittering lights. Small gifts are exchanged, and large family dinners are organized with family and friends, featuring a special [[Stuffed turkey|turkey]] dish stuffed with a [[zante currant]], [[pine nuts]], [[pimiento]] and [[dill]] ''[[pilaf|i\u00e7 pilav]]'', [[dolma]], hot [[b\u00f6rek]], [[baklava]], and various other [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish dishes]], accompanied with [[rak\u0131]], [[Turkish wine]], or [[boza]], [[Sharbat|\u015ferbet]], [[salep]], and [[Turkish tea]] or [[Turkish coffee|coffee]]. Even though Turkish people generally do not celebrate [[Christmas]], decorating Christmas trees is a very popular tradition on New Year's Eve in Turkey, and the Turks associate [[Santa Claus]] with New Year's Eve.\n\nTelevision and radio channels are known to continuously broadcast a variety of special New Year's Eve programs, while [[Municipality|municipalities]] all around the country organize fundraising events for the poor, in addition to celebratory public shows such as concerts and family-friendly events, as well as more traditional forms of entertainment such as the [[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat]] [[shadow theatre|shadow-theater]], and even performances by the [[Mehter]]\u2014the [[Janissary]] Band that was founded during the days of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nPublic and private parties with large public attendances are organised in a number of cities and towns, particularly in the largest metropolitan areas such as [[Istanbul]], [[Ankara]], [[Izmir]], [[Adana]], [[Bursa]] and [[Antalya]], with the biggest celebrations taking place in Istanbul's [[Taksim Square|Taksim]], [[Beyo\u011flu]], [[Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131]] and [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]] districts and Ankara's [[K\u0131z\u0131lay Square]], which generally feature dancing, concerts, laser and light shows as well as the traditional countdown and fireworks display.\n\n===Ukraine===\n[[File:Christmas tree in Kyiv, 2019-2020.jpg|thumb|New Year celebration in [[Kiev]]]]\nIn the countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union, New Year's has the same cultural significance as Christmas has in the United States, but without the religious connotations. Ukrainian families traditionally install spruce trees at home, the equivalent of a Christmas tree. Families gather to eat a large feast and reflect on the past year. They have a large celebration, make toasts, and make wishes for a happy New Year. Families give presents to their friends as well as informal acquaintances. As Ukrainians are traditionally a closely-knit community, it is seen as a taboo to not give presents to those the family associates with. Children stay up until midnight, waiting for the New Year. During these celebrations, many Ukrainians tune to special New Year shows, which have become a long-standing tradition for Ukrainian TV. And just before midnight the [[President of Ukraine]] gives his New Year's message to the nation, and when the clock strikes 12, the National Anthem [[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina]] is played in all TV and radio stations as well as in Independence Square in Kiev and other cities where holiday celebrations are held.\n\nThe first New year dish in Ukraine which associates with the New year for every Ukrainian person is the Olivier salad. It has become the main \u00abcharacter\u00bb of many jokes and anecdotes. There are several versions about where the name Olivier comes from, but most people say that it appeared thanks to the French chef Olivier, who lived in the USSR in the 1960s and was the owner of a French restaurant in Moscow. He was the first one to cook this dish. Nowadays this salad is also called Russian, potato and meat salad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diolli.com/new-year-dishes-in-ukraine/|title=New year dish - Ukrainian food - Diolli.com|date=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nNew Year is often considered a \"pre-celebration\" for Greek Catholics and Eastern Orthodox living in Eastern Europe, primarily in Ukraine, since Christmas is celebrated on 7 January.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n====England====\n{{Main|New Year's Eve in London}}\n[[File:LondonTrafSQNYE.jpg|thumb|right|Thousands of people gather in [[central London]] for New Year celebrations, including fireworks at the [[London Eye]] at midnight]]\nThe most prominent New Year's Eve (Old Year's Night) celebration in England is that of [[Central London]], where the arrival of midnight is greeted with the chimes of [[Big Ben]].

The celebration is focused on a major street party along [[Princes Street]]. The cannon is fired at [[Edinburgh Castle]] at the stroke of midnight, followed by a large fireworks display. Edinburgh hosts a festival of four or five days, beginning on 28 December, and lasting until New Year's Day or 2 January, which is also a [[bank holiday]] in Scotland.\n\nOther cities across Scotland, such as [[Aberdeen]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Stirling]] have large organised celebrations too, including fireworks at midnight.\n\n[[BBC Scotland]] [[Hogmanay Live|broadcast the celebrations]] in Edinburgh to a Scottish audience, with the celebrations also screened across the world.

The race celebrates the life and achievements of Welsh runner [[Guto Nyth Br\u00e2n]].\n\nFounded in 1958 by local runner Bernard Baldwin, it is run over the 5-kilometre route of Guto's first competitive race. The main race starts with a church service at [[Llanwynno]], and then a wreath is laid on Guto's grave in [[Llanwynno]] graveyard. After lighting a torch, it is carried to the nearby town of Mountain Ash, where the main race takes place.\n\nThe race consists of a double circuit of the town centre, starting in Henry Street and ending in Oxford Street, by the commemorative statue of Guto. Traditionally, the race was timed to end at midnight, but in recent times it was rescheduled for the convenience of family entertainment, now concluding at around 9 pm.\n\nThis has resulted in a growth in size and scale, and the proceedings now start with an afternoon of street entertainment, and fun run races for children, concluding with the church service, elite runners' race, and presentations.\n\n==Middle East==\n===Israel===\nNew Year's Eve (''Sylvester'') in [[Israel]], is celebrated by parties, social get togethers, concerts, and dining out in major cities such as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Tel Aviv]].

The dinner features traditional dishes such as tabouli, hummus, kibbi, and other Lebanese foods. These celebrations could also take place in restaurants and clubs. Game shows are also organized where people can try to win money. The countdown to New Year's is broadcast through the leading TV channel and the celebrations usually continue until sunrise.
