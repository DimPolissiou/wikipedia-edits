In an interview conducted on May 2019 with the PAF Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal [[Mujahid Anwar Khan]] stated that he does not expect the Fifth Generation Fighter to become operational for another decade. He also revealed the current Air Staff Requirements of the FGFA are a \"twin-engine single-seater, boasting the likes of super-cruise and laser weapons (directed energy weapons).\" Thus, the FGFA is not only a clean-sheet design, but currently slated as a medium-to-heavyweight, high-performance jet. This design configuration indicates that the PAF intends to produce a platform capable of heavier payloads and range than the [[JF-17]].

In an interview conducted on May 2019 with the PAF Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal [[Mujahid Anwar Khan]] stated that he does not expect the Fifth Generation Fighter to become operational for another decade. He also revealed the current Air Staff Requirements of the FGFA are a \"twin-engine single-seater, boasting the likes of super-cruise and laser weapons (directed energy weapons).\" Thus, the FGFA is not only a clean-sheet design, but currently slated as a medium-to-heavyweight, high-performance jet. This design configuration indicates that the PAF intends to produce a platform capable of heavier payloads and range than the [[JF-17]].

The astrological order of the days was explained by [[Vettius Valens]] and [[Dio Cassius]] (and [[Chaucer]] gave the same explanation in his ''[[Treatise on the Astrolabe]]''). According to these authors, it was a principle of [[astrology]] that the heavenly bodies presided, in succession, over the hours of the day. The association of the weekdays with the respective deities is thus indirect, the days are named for the planets, which were in turn named for the deities. Feeling good, like I should\nWent and took a walk around the neighborhood\nFeeling blessed, never stressed\nGot that sunshine on my Sunday best\nEvery day can be a better day despite the challenge\nAll you gotta do is leave it better than you found it\nIt's gonna get difficult to stand but hold your balance\nI just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it 'cause\nEveryone falls down sometimes\nBut you just gotta know it'll all be fine\nIt's ok, uh-huh\nIt's ok, it's ok\nFeeling good, like I should\nWent and took a walk around the neighborhood\nFeeling blessed, never stressed\nGot that sunshine on my Sunday best\nSomedays you wake up and nothing works you feel surrounded\nGotta give your feet some gravity to get you grounded\nKeep good things inside your ears just like the waves and sound did\nAnd just say whatever cause there is no way around it\nEveryone falls down sometimes\nBut you just gotta know it'll all be fine\nIt's ok, uh-huh\nIt's ok, it's ok\nFeeling good, like I should\nWent and took a walk around the neighborhood\nFeeling blessed, never stressed\nGot that sunshine on my Sunday best\nFeeling good, like I should\nWent and took a walk around the neighborhood\nFeeling blessed, never stressed\nGot that sunshine on my Sunday best\n\nThe [[Germanic peoples]] adapted the system introduced by the Romans but glossed their [[Germanic mythology|indigenous gods]] over the Roman deities in a process known as ''[[interpretatio germanica]]''.  In the case of Saturday, however, the Roman name was [[Loanword|borrowed]] directly by West Germanic peoples, apparently because none of the Germanic gods were considered to be counterparts of the Roman god [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]. Otherwise [[Old Norse]] and [[Old High German]] did not borrow the name of the Roman god (Icelandic ''laugardagur'', German ''Samstag'').\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], Saturdays are days on which the [[Theotokos]] ([[Mother of God]]) and [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]] are commemorated, and the day on which [[prayer for the dead#Eastern Christianity|prayers for the dead]] are especially offered, in remembrance that it was on a Saturday that Jesus lay dead in the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb]]. The [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]] contains hymns on these themes, arranged in an eight-week cycle, that are chanted on Saturdays throughout the year.  At the end of services on Saturday, the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] begins with the words: \"May Christ our True God, through the [[intercession]]s of his most-pure Mother, of the holy, glorious and right victorious [[Martyr]]s, of our reverend and God-bearing [[Holy Fathers|Fathers]]\u2026\". For the Orthodox, Saturday &mdash; with the sole exception of [[Holy Saturday]] &mdash; is never a strict [[fast day]]. When a Saturday falls during one of the fasting seasons ([[Great Lent]], [[Nativity Fast]], [[Apostles' Fast]], [[Dormition Fast]]) the fasting rules are always lessened to an extent. The [[Great Feast]] of the [[Exaltation of the Cross]] and the [[Beheading of St. John the Baptist]] are normally observed as strict fast days, but if they fall on a Saturday or Sunday, the fast is lessened.\n\n==Name and associations==\n\nToday, Saturday is officially called ''Samstag'' in all [[German language|German]]-speaking countries, but there it has two names in modern [[Standard German]]. ''Samstag'' is always used in [[Austria]], [[Liechtenstein]], and the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], and generally used in southern and western [[Germany]]. It derives from [[Old High German]] ''sambaztac'', which itself derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''\u03a3\u03ac\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf'', and this Greek word derives from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea'' ([[Shabbat]]). However, the current German word for Sabbath is ''Sabbat''. The second name for Saturday in German is ''Sonnabend'', which derives from Old High German ''sunnunaband'', and is closely related to the [[Old English]] word ''sunnan\u00e6fen''. It means literally \"Sun eve\", i.e., \"The day before Sunday\". ''Sonnabend'' is generally used in northern and eastern Germany, and was also the official name for Saturday in [[East Germany]].\n\nIn West Frisian there are also two words for Saturday. In Wood Frisian it is '' saterdei'', and in Clay Frisian it is ''sneon'', derived from ''snjoen'', a combination of Old Frisian ''sunne'', meaning ''sun'' and ''joen'', meaning eve.\n\nIn the [[Westphalia]]n dialects of [[West Low German|Low Saxon]], in [[East Frisian Low Saxon]] and in the [[Saterland Frisian language]], Saturday is called ''Satertag'', also akin to [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''zaterdag'', which has the same linguistic roots as the English word ''Saturday''. It was formerly thought that the English name referred to a deity named ''S\u00e6tere'' who was venerated by the pre-Christian peoples of north-western Germany, some of whom were the ancestors of the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. S\u00e6tere was identified as either a god associated with the [[harvest]] of possible [[Slav]] origin,<ref>Palgrave, Francis, ''History of the Anglo-Saxons'' (1876), William Tegg & Co., London p.43</ref> or another name for [[Loki]]<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/time/smd/smd22.htm Couzens, Reginald C., ''The Stories of the Months and Days'' (1923), ch.22]</ref> a complex deity associated with both good and evil; this latter suggestion may be due to [[Jacob Grimm]].<ref>Grimm, Jacob, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mDHXAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA247= Teutonic Mythology]'' (1835), translated by James Steven Stallybrass in 1882 from ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]'', George Bell, London, p. 247.</ref> However, modern dictionaries derive the name from ''Saturn''.<ref>\"Saturday\", Oxford English Dictionary, Third Edition (2008).</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/saturday \"Saturday\"], Merriam-Webster Dictionary (2013).</ref><ref>[http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Saturday&submit.x=38&submit.y=18 \"Saturday\"], American Heritage Dictionary, Fifth Edition (2011).</ref><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=Saturday&searchmode=none \"Saturday\"].  Online Etymology Dictionary, accessed 2013.</ref>\n\nIn most [[languages of India]], Saturday is ''Shaniv\u0101ra'', ''v\u0101ra'' meaning day, based on [[Shani]], the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] god manifested in the planet [[Saturn]]. In the [[Thai solar calendar]] of [[Thailand]], the day is named from the [[Pali]] word for Saturn, and the color associated with Saturday is [[purple]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In [[Pakistan]], Saturday is [[Hafta]], meaning the week. In Eastern Indian languages like Bengali Saturday is called Shonibar or \u09b6\u09a8\u09bf\u09ac\u09be\u09b0 meaning Saturn's Day and is the first day of the Bengali Week in the [[Bengali calendar]].\nIn [[Muslim world|Islamic countries]], Fridays are considered as the last or penultimate day of the week and are holidays along with [[Thursday]]s or Saturdays; Saturday is called \u0633\u0628\u062a or ''Sabt'' (cognate to [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]]) and it is the first day of the week in many [[Arab World|Arab countries]] but the Last Day in other Islamic countries such as [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], [[Central Asia|Central Asian countries]].\n\nIn [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the word Saturday is {{Lang|ja|\u571f\u66dc\u65e5}} (''doy\u014dbi''), meaning 'soil day' and is associated with {{Lang|ja|\u571f\u661f}} (''dosei''): Saturn (the planet), literally meaning \"soil star\". Similarly, in [[Korean language|Korean]] the word Saturday is \ud1a0\uc694\uc77c (''tho yo il''), also meaning earth day. The element Earth was associated with the planet Saturn in Chinese astrology and philosophy.\n\nThe modern [[Maori language|Maori]] name for Saturday, ''rahoroi'', literally means \"washing-day\" - a vestige of early colonized life when M\u0101ori converts would set aside time on the Saturday to wash their whites for Church on Sunday.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} A common alternative M\u0101ori name for Saturday is the transliteration ''Hatarei''.\n\n[[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] traditionally referred to Saturday as \"Seventh Day\", eschewing the \"[[paganism|pagan]]\" origin of the name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iymc.org/calendarnames.html |title=Guide to Quaker Calendar Names |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= |publisher=Iowa Yearly Meeting (Conservative) Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) |access-date=30 March 2017 |quote=In the 20th Century, many Friends began accepting use of the common date names, feeling that any pagan meaning has been forgotten. The numerical names continue to be used, however, in many documents and more formal situations.\"}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Scandinavia]]n countries, Saturday is called ''l\u00f6rdag,'' ''l\u00f8rdag,'' or ''laurdag,'' the name being derived from the old word ''[[laugr]]/laug'' (hence [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] name ''Laugardagur''), meaning bath, thus ''L\u00f6rdag'' equates to bath-day. This is due to the [[Viking]] practice of bathing on Saturdays.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Vikings : facts and fictions|last=Wolf, Kirsten, 1959-|others=Mueller-Vollmer, Tristan|isbn=9781440862984|location=Santa Barbara, California|oclc=1035771932|year = 2018}}</ref> The roots ''l\u00f6r'', ''laugar'' and so forth are cognate to the English word ''[[lye]]'', in the sense of detergent. The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] names for the day, ''lauantai'' and ''laup\u00e4ev'', respectively, are also derived from this term.\n\n==Position in the week==\n{{see also|Gregorian calendar}}\nThe international standard [[ISO 8601]] sets Saturday as the sixth day of the week. The three [[Abrahamic religions]] ([[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]) regard Saturday as the seventh [[week|day of the week]]. As a result, many refused the ISO 8601 standards and continue to use Saturday as their seventh day.\n\n==Saturday Sabbath==\n{{See also|Shabbat|Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Sabbath in Christianity}}\nFor [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Messianic Judaism|Messianics]], [[Seventh Day Baptists]] and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]]s, the seventh day of the week, known as [[Shabbat]] (or [[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Sabbath]] for Seventh-day Adventists), stretches from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday and is the day of rest. [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches distinguish between Saturday (Sabbath) and the [[Lord's Day]] (Sunday). Other Protestant groups, such as Seventh-day Adventists, hold that the Lord's Day is the Sabbath, according to the fourth commandment (Exodus 20:8),and not Sunday.\n\n{{quote|But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work.|source= Exodus 20:10 King James Version}}\n\n==Astrology==\n{{Main article|Saturn (astrology)}}\nIn [[astrology]], Saturn is associated with Saturday, its planet's symbol [[File:Saturn symbol.svg|22px]], and the astrological signs [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] and [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]].\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{or section|date=January 2018}}\n===Regional customs===\n* In most countries, Saturday is a [[weekend]] day (see [[workweek]]).\n* In [[Australia]], elections must take place on a Saturday.<ref name=\"Australia Electoral Act\">{{cite web |url=http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdb/au/legis/act/consol_act/ea1992103/ |title=Electoral Act 1992, s.100-101 |date=1992 |website=www6.austlii.edu.au |access-date=19 February 2019}}</ref>\n* In [[Israel]], Saturday is the official [[Shabbat|day of rest]],<ref name=\"Basic Law Israel\">{{cite web |url=http://knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/BasicLawNationState.pdf |title=Basic Law: Israel - the Nation State of the Jewish People  |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=19 July 2018 |website=knesset.gov.il |access-date=19 February 2019}}</ref> on which all government offices and most businesses, including some public transportation, are closed.\n* In [[Nepal]], Saturday is the last day of the week and is the only official weekly holiday.<ref name=\"BharatOnline Holidays in Nepal\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bharatonline.com/nepal/travel-tips/holidays-in-nepal.html |title=Holidays in Nepal |website=bharatonline.com |access-date=19 February 2019}}</ref>\n* In [[New Zealand]], Saturday is the only day on which elections can be held.<ref name=\"New Zealand Electoral Act 1993\">{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM309482.html |title=Electoral Act 1993, section 139(1)(b) |date=1993 |website=www.legislation.govt.nz |access-date=19 February 2019}}</ref>\n* In [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]], Saturday has usually been the only day of the week when especially younger children are allowed to eat [[sweets]], ''l\u00f6rdagsgodis'' in [[Swedish Language|Swedish]] and ''l\u00f8rdagsgodtteri'' in [[Norwegian Language|Norwegian]].

The astrological order of the days was explained by [[Vettius Valens]] and [[Dio Cassius]] (and [[Chaucer]] gave the same explanation in his ''[[Treatise on the Astrolabe]]''). According to these authors, it was a principle of [[astrology]] that the heavenly bodies presided, in succession, over the hours of the day. The association of the weekdays with the respective deities is thus indirect, the days are named for the planets, which were in turn named for the deities.\n\nThe [[Germanic peoples]] adapted the system introduced by the Romans but glossed their [[Germanic mythology|indigenous gods]] over the Roman deities in a process known as ''[[interpretatio germanica]]''.  In the case of Saturday, however, the Roman name was [[Loanword|borrowed]] directly by West Germanic peoples, apparently because none of the Germanic gods were considered to be counterparts of the Roman god [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]. Otherwise [[Old Norse]] and [[Old High German]] did not borrow the name of the Roman god (Icelandic ''laugardagur'', German ''Samstag'').\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], Saturdays are days on which the [[Theotokos]] ([[Mother of God]]) and [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]] are commemorated, and the day on which [[prayer for the dead#Eastern Christianity|prayers for the dead]] are especially offered, in remembrance that it was on a Saturday that Jesus lay dead in the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb]]. The [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]] contains hymns on these themes, arranged in an eight-week cycle, that are chanted on Saturdays throughout the year.  At the end of services on Saturday, the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] begins with the words: \"May Christ our True God, through the [[intercession]]s of his most-pure Mother, of the holy, glorious and right victorious [[Martyr]]s, of our reverend and God-bearing [[Holy Fathers|Fathers]]\u2026\". For the Orthodox, Saturday &mdash; with the sole exception of [[Holy Saturday]] &mdash; is never a strict [[fast day]]. When a Saturday falls during one of the fasting seasons ([[Great Lent]], [[Nativity Fast]], [[Apostles' Fast]], [[Dormition Fast]]) the fasting rules are always lessened to an extent. The [[Great Feast]] of the [[Exaltation of the Cross]] and the [[Beheading of St. John the Baptist]] are normally observed as strict fast days, but if they fall on a Saturday or Sunday, the fast is lessened.\n\n==Name and associations==\n\nToday, Saturday is officially called ''Samstag'' in all [[German language|German]]-speaking countries, but there it has two names in modern [[Standard German]]. ''Samstag'' is always used in [[Austria]], [[Liechtenstein]], and the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], and generally used in southern and western [[Germany]]. It derives from [[Old High German]] ''sambaztac'', which itself derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''\u03a3\u03ac\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf'', and this Greek word derives from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea'' ([[Shabbat]]). However, the current German word for Sabbath is ''Sabbat''. The second name for Saturday in German is ''Sonnabend'', which derives from Old High German ''sunnunaband'', and is closely related to the [[Old English]] word ''sunnan\u00e6fen''. It means literally \"Sun eve\", i.e., \"The day before Sunday\". ''Sonnabend'' is generally used in northern and eastern Germany, and was also the official name for Saturday in [[East Germany]].\n\nIn West Frisian there are also two words for Saturday. In Wood Frisian it is '' saterdei'', and in Clay Frisian it is ''sneon'', derived from ''snjoen'', a combination of Old Frisian ''sunne'', meaning ''sun'' and ''joen'', meaning eve.\n\nIn the [[Westphalia]]n dialects of [[West Low German|Low Saxon]], in [[East Frisian Low Saxon]] and in the [[Saterland Frisian language]], Saturday is called ''Satertag'', also akin to [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''zaterdag'', which has the same linguistic roots as the English word ''Saturday''. It was formerly thought that the English name referred to a deity named ''S\u00e6tere'' who was venerated by the pre-Christian peoples of north-western Germany, some of whom were the ancestors of the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. S\u00e6tere was identified as either a god associated with the [[harvest]] of possible [[Slav]] origin,<ref>Palgrave, Francis, ''History of the Anglo-Saxons'' (1876), William Tegg & Co., London p.43</ref> or another name for [[Loki]]<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/time/smd/smd22.htm Couzens, Reginald C., ''The Stories of the Months and Days'' (1923), ch.22]</ref> a complex deity associated with both good and evil; this latter suggestion may be due to [[Jacob Grimm]].<ref>Grimm, Jacob, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mDHXAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA247= Teutonic Mythology]'' (1835), translated by James Steven Stallybrass in 1882 from ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]'', George Bell, London, p. 247.</ref> However, modern dictionaries derive the name from ''Saturn''.<ref>\"Saturday\", Oxford English Dictionary, Third Edition (2008).</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/saturday \"Saturday\"], Merriam-Webster Dictionary (2013).</ref><ref>[http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Saturday&submit.x=38&submit.y=18 \"Saturday\"], American Heritage Dictionary, Fifth Edition (2011).</ref><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=Saturday&searchmode=none \"Saturday\"].  Online Etymology Dictionary, accessed 2013.</ref>\n\nIn most [[languages of India]], Saturday is ''Shaniv\u0101ra'', ''v\u0101ra'' meaning day, based on [[Shani]], the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] god manifested in the planet [[Saturn]]. In the [[Thai solar calendar]] of [[Thailand]], the day is named from the [[Pali]] word for Saturn, and the color associated with Saturday is [[purple]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In [[Pakistan]], Saturday is [[Hafta]], meaning the week. In Eastern Indian languages like Bengali Saturday is called Shonibar or \u09b6\u09a8\u09bf\u09ac\u09be\u09b0 meaning Saturn's Day and is the first day of the Bengali Week in the [[Bengali calendar]].\nIn [[Muslim world|Islamic countries]], Fridays are considered as the last or penultimate day of the week and are holidays along with [[Thursday]]s or Saturdays; Saturday is called \u0633\u0628\u062a or ''Sabt'' (cognate to [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]]) and it is the first day of the week in many [[Arab World|Arab countries]] but the Last Day in other Islamic countries such as [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], [[Central Asia|Central Asian countries]].\n\nIn [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the word Saturday is {{Lang|ja|\u571f\u66dc\u65e5}} (''doy\u014dbi''), meaning 'soil day' and is associated with {{Lang|ja|\u571f\u661f}} (''dosei''): Saturn (the planet), literally meaning \"soil star\". Similarly, in [[Korean language|Korean]] the word Saturday is \ud1a0\uc694\uc77c (''tho yo il''), also meaning earth day. The element Earth was associated with the planet Saturn in Chinese astrology and philosophy.\n\nThe modern [[Maori language|Maori]] name for Saturday, ''rahoroi'', literally means \"washing-day\" - a vestige of early colonized life when M\u0101ori converts would set aside time on the Saturday to wash their whites for Church on Sunday.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} A common alternative M\u0101ori name for Saturday is the transliteration ''Hatarei''.\n\n[[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] traditionally referred to Saturday as \"Seventh Day\", eschewing the \"[[paganism|pagan]]\" origin of the name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iymc.org/calendarnames.html |title=Guide to Quaker Calendar Names |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= |publisher=Iowa Yearly Meeting (Conservative) Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) |access-date=30 March 2017 |quote=In the 20th Century, many Friends began accepting use of the common date names, feeling that any pagan meaning has been forgotten.

This is due to the [[Viking]] practice of bathing on Saturdays.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Vikings : facts and fictions|last=Wolf, Kirsten, 1959-|others=Mueller-Vollmer, Tristan|isbn=9781440862984|location=Santa Barbara, California|oclc=1035771932|year = 2018}}</ref> The roots ''l\u00f6r'', ''laugar'' and so forth are cognate to the English word ''[[lye]]'', in the sense of detergent. The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] names for the day, ''lauantai'' and ''laup\u00e4ev'', respectively, are also derived from this term.\n\n==Position in the week==\n{{see also|Gregorian calendar}}\nThe international standard [[ISO 8601]] sets Saturday as the sixth day of the week. The three [[Abrahamic religions]] ([[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]) regard Saturday as the seventh [[week|day of the week]]. As a result, many refused the ISO 8601 standards and continue to use Saturday as their seventh day.\n\n==Saturday Sabbath==\n{{See also|Shabbat|Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Sabbath in Christianity}}\nFor [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Messianic Judaism|Messianics]], [[Seventh Day Baptists]] and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]]s, the seventh day of the week, known as [[Shabbat]] (or [[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Sabbath]] for Seventh-day Adventists), stretches from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday and is the day of rest. [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches distinguish between Saturday (Sabbath) and the [[Lord's Day]] (Sunday). Other Protestant groups, such as Seventh-day Adventists, hold that the Lord's Day is the Sabbath, according to the fourth commandment (Exodus 20:8),and not Sunday.\n\n{{quote|But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work.|source= Exodus 20:10 King James Version}}\n\n==Astrology==\n{{Main article|Saturn (astrology)}}\nIn [[astrology]], Saturn is associated with Saturday, its planet's symbol [[File:Saturn symbol.svg|22px]], and the astrological signs [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] and [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]].\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{or section|date=January 2018}}\n===Regional customs===\n* In most countries, Saturday is a [[weekend]] day (see [[workweek]]).\n* In [[Australia]], elections must take place on a Saturday.<ref name=\"Australia Electoral Act\">{{cite web |url=http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdb/au/legis/act/consol_act/ea1992103/ |title=Electoral Act 1992, s.100-101 |date=1992 |website=www6.austlii.edu.au |access-date=19 February 2019}}</ref>\n* In [[Israel]], Saturday is the official [[Shabbat|day of rest]],<ref name=\"Basic Law Israel\">{{cite web |url=http://knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/BasicLawNationState.pdf |title=Basic Law: Israel - the Nation State of the Jewish People  |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=19 July 2018 |website=knesset.gov.il |access-date=19 February 2019}}</ref> on which all government offices and most businesses, including some public transportation, are closed.\n* In [[Nepal]], Saturday is the last day of the week and is the only official weekly holiday.<ref name=\"BharatOnline Holidays in Nepal\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bharatonline.com/nepal/travel-tips/holidays-in-nepal.html |title=Holidays in Nepal |website=bharatonline.com |access-date=19 February 2019}}</ref>\n* In [[New Zealand]], Saturday is the only day on which elections can be held.<ref name=\"New Zealand Electoral Act 1993\">{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM309482.html |title=Electoral Act 1993, section 139(1)(b) |date=1993 |website=www.legislation.govt.nz |access-date=19 February 2019}}</ref>\n* In [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]], Saturday has usually been the only day of the week when especially younger children are allowed to eat [[sweets]], ''l\u00f6rdagsgodis'' in [[Swedish Language|Swedish]] and ''l\u00f8rdagsgodtteri'' in [[Norwegian Language|Norwegian]].

Such themes include but are not limited to: [[disguise]], [[Masking (personality)|masking]], [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], [[cannibalism]], the [[grotesque body|grotesque]], bodily fluids, power, violent murders, and secrecy.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Revenge: An Analysis of Its Psychological Underpinnings|last = Grobbink|first = Leonie|date = July 2015|journal = International Journal of Offender Therapy & Comparative Criminology|volume = 59|issue = 8|pages = 892\u2013907|doi = 10.1177/0306624X13519963|pmid = 24441031}}</ref> Each theme is usually coupled with the concept of [[Irony#Dramatic irony|dramatic irony]].

''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'', a 20th-century novel written by [[Stephen King]], has examples of this theme that do occur during the final scenes. Another text that incorporates this theme is the 16th-century drama ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]].\n\nThe themes of masking and disguise have the ability to go hand in hand with one another.

[[Primatology|Primatologists]] <nowiki/>[[Frans de Waal]] and Lesleigh Luttrellave conducted numerous studies that provide evidence of revenge in many species of primates. They observed chimpanzees and noticed patterns of revenge. For example, if chimpanzee A helped chimpanzee B defeat his opponent, chimpanzee C, then chimpanzee C would be more likely to help chimpanzee A's opponent in a later squabble. Chimpanzees are one of the most common species that show revenge due to their desire for dominance. Studies have also been performed on less cognitive species such as fish to demonstrate that not only intellectual animals execute revenge.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Beyond Revenge : The Evolution of the Forgiveness Instinct|last = McCullough|first = Michael|publisher = Jossey-Bass|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = 79\u201385}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==<!-- Please respect alphabetical order -->\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[Crime of passion]]\n*[[Cycle of violence]]\n*[[Dirty Work (1998 film)|''Dirty Work'' (1998 film)]]\n*[[Divine retribution]]\n*[[Eye for an eye]]\n*[[Frontier justice]]\n*[[Guilt-Shame-Fear spectrum of cultures]]\n*[[Honor killing]]\n*[[Just-world hypothesis]]\n*[[Karma]]\n*[[Lawsuit]]\n*[[Nemesis (mythology)]]\n*[[Proportionality (law)]]\n*[[Punishment]]\n*[[Retributive justice]]\n*[[Schadenfreude]]\n*[[Two wrongs make a right]]\n*[[Vengeful ghost]]\n*[[Vigilantism]]\n*[[War]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category-inline}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Avenger of Blood}}\n{{Wikiquote|Revenge}}\n\n{{emotion-footer}}\n\n[[Category:Revenge| ]]\n[[Category:Punishment]]\n[[Category:Justice]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:, templated 3 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge"}
