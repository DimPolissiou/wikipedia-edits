Although there is no formal grouping for these books in the Jewish tradition, they nevertheless share a number of distinguishing characteristics:\n* Their narratives all openly describe relatively late events (i.e., the Babylonian captivity and the subsequent restoration of Zion).\n* The Talmudic tradition ascribes late authorship to all of them.\n* Two of them (Daniel and Ezra) are the only books in the Tanakh with significant portions in [[Biblical Aramaic|Aramaic]].\n\n==== Order of the books ====\nThe following list presents the books of Ketuvim in the order they appear in most printed editions.

The [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Bava Batra]] 14b\u201315a) gives their order as Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Daniel, Scroll of Esther, Ezra, Chronicles.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9NUejG2IGPMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage] The Babylonian Talmud, Vol. 7 of 9: Tract Baba Bathra (Last Gate) translated by Michael L.

While the Torah may have been considered canon by Israel as early as the 5th century BCE and the [[Former Prophets|Former]] and [[Latter Prophets]] were canonized by the 2nd century BCE, the Ketuvim was not a fixed canon until the 2nd century of the [[Common Era]].<ref name=\"Coogan2009\" />\n\nEvidence suggests, however, that the people of Israel were adding what would become the Ketuvim to their holy literature shortly after the canonization of the prophets. As early as 132 BCE references suggest that the Ketuvim was starting to take shape, although it lacked a formal title.{{sfn|Henshaw|1963|pp=16\u201317}} References in the four [[Gospels]] as well as other books of the New Testament indicate that many of these texts were both commonly known and counted as having some degree of religious authority early in the 1st century CE.\n\nMany scholars believe that the limits of the Ketuvim as canonized scripture were determined by the [[Council of Jamnia]] c. 90 CE.

Second, the Hebrew source texts used for the Septuagint differed from the Masoretic tradition of Hebrew texts, which was chosen as canonical by the Jewish rabbis.<ref>\"The translation, which shows at times a peculiar ignorance of Hebrew usage, was evidently made from a codex which differed widely in places from the text crystallized by the Masorah.\" {{cite web|title=Bible Translations \u2013 The Septuagint|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3269-bible-translations|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref> Third, the rabbis wanted to distinguish their tradition from the newly emerging tradition of Christianity.<ref name=\"ndq\">\"[...] die griechische Bibel\u00fcbersetzung, die einem innerj\u00fcdischen Bed\u00fcrfnis entsprang [...] [von den] Rabbinen zuerst ger\u00fchmt (.)

In Greek-speaking areas, this happened near the end of the 2nd century, and in Latin-speaking areas (at least in North Africa), it occurred in the middle of the 3rd century.

It has been proposed, and is thought highly likely by scholars, that \"Esdras B\" \u2013 the canonical Ezra\u2013Nehemiah \u2013 is Theodotion's version of this material, and \"Esdras A\" is the version which was previously in the Septuagint on its own.<ref name=\"EncBibTV\" />\n\n=== Final form ===\nSome texts are found in the Septuagint but are not present in the Hebrew. These additional books are [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]], [[Judith]], [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]], [[Sirach|Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach]], [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]], the [[Letter of Jeremiah]] (which later became chapter 6 of Baruch in the Vulgate), [[additions to Daniel]] ([[The Prayer of Azariah|The Prayer of Azarias]], the [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children|Song of the Three Children]], [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]] and [[Bel and the Dragon]]), additions to [[Book of Esther|Esther]], [[1 Maccabees]], [[2 Maccabees]], [[3 Maccabees]], [[4 Maccabees]], [[1 Esdras]], [[Book of Odes (Bible)|Odes]], including the [[Prayer of Manasseh]], the [[Psalms of Solomon]], and [[Psalm 151]].\n\nSome books that are set apart in the Masoretic Text are grouped together. For example, the [[Books of Samuel]] and the [[Books of Kings]] are in the LXX one book in four parts called \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u1ff6\u03bd (\"Of Reigns\").

Not all of these works are actually pseudepigraphical. It also refers to books of the New Testament canon whose authorship is misrepresented. The Old Testament pseudepigraphal works include the following:<ref name =\"Harris\">[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], ''Understanding the Bible''.

These are ancient [[Jewish]] religious works, traditionally ascribed to the prophet [[Enoch (Biblical figure)|Enoch]], the great-grandfather of the patriarch [[Noah]]. They are not part of the [[biblical canon]] used by [[Jews]], apart from [[Beta Israel]]. Most Christian denominations and traditions may accept the Books of Enoch as having some historical or theological interest or significance. It has been observed that part of the Book of Enoch is quoted in the [[Epistle of Jude]] (part of the New Testament) but Christian denominations generally regard the Books of Enoch as non-canonical or non-inspired.<ref>[http://reluctant-messenger.com/enoch.htm The Book of Enoch] \u2013 The Reluctant Messenger. Retrieved 14 June 2014.</ref> However, the Enoch books are treated as canonical by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] and [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]].\n\nThe older sections (mainly in the Book of the Watchers) are estimated to date from about 300&nbsp;BCE, and the latest part (Book of Parables) probably was composed at the end of the 1st century&nbsp;BCE.<ref>Fahlbusch E., Bromiley G.W.

These works were also outside the particular set of books that Roman Catholics called ''deuterocanonical'' and to which Protestants had generally applied the term Apocryphal.  Accordingly, the term ''pseudepigraphical'', as now used often among both Protestants and Roman Catholics (allegedly for the clarity it brings to the discussion), may make it difficult to discuss questions of pseudepigraphical authorship of canonical books dispassionately with a lay audience.  To confuse the matter further, Eastern Orthodox Christians accept books as canonical that Roman Catholics and most Protestant denominations consider pseudepigraphical or at best of much less authority.  There exist also churches that reject some of the books that Roman Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants accept.  The same is true of some [[Jewish denominations|Jewish sects]].  Many works that are apocryphal are otherwise considered genuine.{{clarify|date=May 2019}}\n\n==== Role of the Old Testament in Christian theology ====\n{{further|Sola scriptura|Christian theology}}\nThe Old Testament has always been central to the life of the Christian church. Bible scholar [[N.T. Wright]] says \"Jesus himself was profoundly shaped by the scriptures.\"{{sfn|Wright|2005|p=3}} He adds that the earliest Christians also searched those same Hebrew scriptures in their effort to understand the earthly life of Jesus. They regarded the \"holy writings\" of the Israelites as necessary and instructive for the Christian, as seen from Paul's words to Timothy (2 Timothy 3:15), and as pointing to the Messiah, and as having reached a climactic fulfilment in Jesus himself, generating the \"[[new covenant]]\" prophesied by [[Jeremiah]].<ref name=\"Wright\">{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=}}</ref>\n\n=== New Testament ===\n{{Main|Development of the New Testament canon}}\nThe New Testament is the name given to the second and final portion of the Christian Bible.

When later scribes were copying the copy, they were sometimes uncertain if a note was intended to be included as part of the text.\n\nThe three main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament are sometimes called the [[Alexandrian text-type]] (generally minimalist), the [[Byzantine text-type]] (generally maximalist), and the [[Western text-type]] (occasionally wild).

In addition to the Septuagint, Christianity{{vague|date=December 2014}} subsequently added various writings that would become the New Testament. Somewhat different lists of accepted works continued to develop in antiquity. In the 4th century a series of [[synod]]s produced a list of texts equal to the 39, 46, 51, or 54-book canon of the Old Testament and to the 27-book canon of the New Testament that would be subsequently used to today, most notably the [[Synod of Hippo]] in 393 CE. Also ''c''. 400, [[Jerome]] produced a definitive Latin edition of the Bible (see [[Vulgate]]), the canon of which, at the insistence of the Pope, was in accord with the earlier Synods. With the benefit of hindsight it can be said that this process effectively set the New Testament canon, although there are examples of other canonical lists in use after this time.\n\nThe Protestant Old Testament of today has a 39-book canon \u2013 the number of books (though not the content) varies from the Jewish Tanakh only because of a different method of division \u2013 while the Roman Catholic Church recognizes 46 books (51 books with some books combined into 46 books) as the canonical Old Testament. The Eastern Orthodox Churches recognize 3 Maccabees, 1 Esdras, Prayer of Manasseh and Psalm 151 in addition to the Catholic canon. Some include 2 Esdras. The Anglican Church also recognizes a longer canon.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The term \"Hebrew Scriptures\" is often used as being synonymous with the Protestant Old Testament, since the surviving scriptures in Hebrew include only those books, while Catholics and Orthodox include additional texts that have not survived in Hebrew.

In addition to the authoritative Masoretic Text, Jews still refer to the Septuagint, the translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, and the [[Targum Onkelos]], an Aramaic version of the Bible. There are several different ancient versions of the Tanakh in Hebrew, mostly differing by spelling, and the traditional Jewish version is based on the version known as Aleppo Codex. Even in this version there are words which are traditionally read differently from written, because the oral tradition is considered more fundamental than the written one, and presumably mistakes had been made in copying the text over the generations.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe primary biblical text for early Christians was the Septuagint. In addition, they translated the Hebrew Bible into several other languages. Translations were made into Syriac, [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]], and Latin, among other languages. The Latin translations were historically the most important for the Church in the West, while the Greek-speaking East continued to use the Septuagint translations of the Old Testament and had no need to translate the New Testament.\n\nThe earliest Latin translation was the [[Old Latin]] text, or ''[[Vetus Latina]]'', which, from internal evidence, seems to have been made by several authors over a period of time. It was based on the Septuagint, and thus included books not in the Hebrew Bible.\n\nAccording to the Latin [[Decretum Gelasianum]] (also known as the Gelasian Decree), thought to be of a 6th-century document<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Francis|title=The Pseudo-Gregorian dialogues|date=1987|publisher=E.J.

It has inspired men and women to acts of great service and courage, to fight for liberation and human development; and it has provided the ideological fuel for societies which have enslaved their fellow human beings and reduced them to abject poverty. ... It has, perhaps above all, provided a source of religious and moral norms which have enabled communities to hold together, to care for, and to protect one another; yet precisely this strong sense of belonging has in turn fuelled ethnic, racial, and international tension and conflict.{{sfn|Riches|2000|p=134}}}}\n\n=== Other religions ===\n{{Main|Islamic view of the Christian Bible}}\nIn [[Islam]], the Bible is held to reflect true unfolding [[revelation]] from [[God in Islam|God]]; but revelation which had been corrupted or distorted (in Arabic: ''[[tahrif]]''); which necessitated the giving of the [[Qur'an]] to the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]], [[Muhammad]], to correct this deviation.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nMembers of other religions may also seek inspiration from the Bible. For example, [[Rastafari]]s view the Bible as essential to their religion<ref>Becoming Rasta: Origins of Rastafari Identity in Jamaica. p. 171, Charles Price. 2009</ref> and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalists]] view it as \"one of many important religious texts\".<ref>Unitarian Universalism. p. 42, Zondervan Publishing, 2009</ref>\n\n=== Biblical studies ===\n{{Main|Biblical studies|Biblical criticism}}\n[[Biblical criticism]] refers to the investigation of the Bible as a text, and addresses questions such as authorship, dates of composition, and authorial intention. It is not the same as [[criticism of the Bible]], which is an assertion against the Bible being a source of information or ethical guidance, or observations that the Bible may have [[translation]] errors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baptistlink.com/creationists/expondoerrossbinvi.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021029221934/http://www.baptistlink.com/creationists/expondoerrossbinvi.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 October 2002|title=Expondo Os Erros Da Sociedade B\u00edblica Internacional|publisher=Baptistlink.com|year=2000|accessdate=13 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Higher criticism ===\n{{Main|Higher criticism|Lower criticism}}\nIn the 17th century [[Thomas Hobbes]] collected the current evidence to conclude outright that Moses could not have written the bulk of the Torah. Shortly afterwards the philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] published a unified critical analysis, arguing that the problematic passages were not isolated cases that could be explained away one by one, but pervasive throughout the five books, concluding that it was \"clearer than the sun at noon that the Pentateuch was not written by Moses ...\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gvrcHyusPbMC&pg=PA121&dq=clearer+than+the+sun+at+noon+that+the+Pentateuch+was+not+written+by+Moses#v=onepage&q=clearer%20than%20the%20sun%20at%20noon%20that%20the%20Pentateuch%20was%20not%20written%20by%20Moses ''Ten More Amazing Discoveries By George Potter''], Cedar Fort,  2005, p. 121</ref>\n\n== Archaeological and historical research ==\n{{Main|Biblical archaeology school|Historicity of the Bible}}\nBiblical archeology is the [[archeology]] that relates to and sheds light upon the Hebrew Scriptures and the Christian Greek Scriptures (or the New Testament). It is used to help determine the lifestyle and practices of people living in biblical times. There are a wide range of interpretations in the field of biblical archeology. One broad division includes [[biblical maximalism]] which generally takes the view that most of the Old Testament or the [[Hebrew Bible]] is based on history although it is presented through the religious viewpoint of its time. It is considered to be the opposite of [[Biblical Minimalism|biblical minimalism]] which considers the Bible to be a purely [[post-exilic]] (5th century BCE and later) composition. Even among those scholars who adhere to biblical minimalism, the Bible is a historical document containing first-hand information on the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman era]]s, and there is universal scholarly consensus that the events of the 6th century BCE [[Babylonian captivity]] have a basis in history.\n\nThe historicity of the biblical account of the [[history of ancient Israel and Judah]] of the 10th to 7th centuries BCE is disputed in scholarship. The biblical account of the 8th to 7th centuries BCE is widely, but not universally, accepted as historical, while the verdict on the earliest period of the [[United Monarchy]] (10th century BCE) and the [[historicity of David]] is unclear. Archaeological evidence providing information on this period, such as the [[Tel Dan Stele]], can potentially be decisive. The biblical account of events of the [[Exodus from Egypt]] in the Torah, and the migration to the [[Promised Land]] and the period of [[Biblical judges|Judges]] are not considered historical in scholarship.<ref>* {{cite book|last=Finkelstein|first=Israel|authorlink=Israel Finkelstein|last2=Silberman|first2=Neil Asher|authorlink2=Neil Asher Silberman|title=The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|year=2001|isbn=978-0-7432-2338-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lu6ywyJr0CMC&pg=PA57&dq=Finkelstein+Bible+Unearthed+Exodus+unoccupied#v=onepage&q=unoccupied}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dever|first=William|authorlink=William G.

They contain narratives that begin immediately after the death of Moses with the divine appointment of Joshua as his successor, who then leads the people of Israel into the [[Promised Land]], and end with the release from imprisonment of the last [[king of Judah]]. Treating Samuel and Kings as single books, they cover:\n* Joshua's conquest of the land of Canaan (in the [[Book of Joshua]]),\n* the struggle of the people to possess the land (in the [[Book of Judges]]),\n* the people's request to God to give them a king so that they can occupy the land in the face of their enemies (in the [[Books of Samuel]])\n* the possession of the land under the divinely appointed kings of the House of David, ending in conquest and foreign exile ([[Books of Kings]])\n\n==== Latter Prophets ====\nThe Latter Prophets are divided into two groups, the \"major\" prophets, [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], and the [[Twelve Minor Prophets]], collected into a single book. The collection is broken up to form twelve individual books in the Christian Old Testament, one for each of the prophets:\n* [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]], ''Hoshea'' (\u05d4\u05d5\u05e9\u05e2)\n* [[Book of Joel|Joel]], ''Yoel'' (\u05d9\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc)\n* [[Book of Amos|Amos]], ''Amos'' (\u05e2\u05de\u05d5\u05e1)\n* [[Book of Obadiah|Obadiah]], ''Ovadyah'' (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d9\u05d4)\n* [[Book of Jonah|Jonah]], ''Yonah'' (\u05d9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4)\n* [[Book of Micah|Micah]], ''Mikhah'' (\u05de\u05d9\u05db\u05d4)\n* [[Book of Nahum|Nahum]], ''Nahum'' (\u05e0\u05d7\u05d5\u05dd)\n* [[Book of Habakkuk|Habakkuk]], ''Havakuk'' (\u05d7\u05d1\u05e7\u05d5\u05e7)\n* [[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]], ''Tsefanya'' (\u05e6\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05d4)\n* [[Book of Haggai|Haggai]], ''Khagay'' (\u05d7\u05d2\u05d9)\n* [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]], ''Zekharyah'' (\u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4)\n* [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]], ''Malakhi'' (\u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05d9)\n\n=== Ketuvim ===\n{{Main|Ketuvim}}\n{{Books of Ketuvim}}\n''Ketuvim'' or ''K\u0259\u1e6f\u00fb\u1e07\u00eem'' (in {{lang-hbo|\u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05ea\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd}} \"writings\") is the third and final section of the Tanakh.

University Press of America, 2005</ref>\n\n==== The poetic books ====\n[[File:Bhs psalm1.png|thumb|[[Hebrew]] text of {{bibleverse|Psalm|1:1\u20132}} ]]\nIn [[Masoretic]] manuscripts (and some printed editions), Psalms, Proverbs and Job are presented in a special two-column form emphasizing the parallel stichs in the verses, which are a function of their [[Biblical poetry|poetry]]. Collectively, these three books are known as ''Sifrei Emet'' (an acronym of the titles in Hebrew, \u05d0\u05d9\u05d5\u05d1, \u05de\u05e9\u05dc\u05d9, \u05ea\u05d4\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd yields ''Emet'' \u05d0\u05de\"\u05ea, which is also the Hebrew for \"truth\").\n\nThese three books are also the only ones in Tanakh with a special system of [[cantillation]] notes that are designed to emphasize parallel stichs within verses. However, the beginning and end of the book of Job are in the normal prose system.\n\n==== The five scrolls (''Hamesh Megillot'') ====\nThe five relatively short books of [[Song of Songs]], [[Book of Ruth]], the [[Book of Lamentations]], [[Ecclesiastes]] and [[Book of Esther]] are collectively known as the ''Hamesh Megillot'' ([[Five Megillot]]). These are the latest books collected and designated as \"authoritative\" in the Jewish canon even though they were not complete until the 2nd century CE.<ref name=\"Coogan2009\">Coogan, Michael D. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: the Hebrew Bible in its Context.'' Oxford University Press. 2009; p. 5</ref>\n\n==== Other books ====\nBesides the three poetic books and the five scrolls, the remaining books in Ketuvim are [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Ezra\u2013Nehemiah]] and Chronicles. Although there is no formal grouping for these books in the Jewish tradition, they nevertheless share a number of distinguishing characteristics:\n* Their narratives all openly describe relatively late events (i.e., the Babylonian captivity and the subsequent restoration of Zion).\n* The Talmudic tradition ascribes late authorship to all of them.\n* Two of them (Daniel and Ezra) are the only books in the Tanakh with significant portions in [[Biblical Aramaic|Aramaic]].\n\n==== Order of the books ====\nThe following list presents the books of Ketuvim in the order they appear in most printed editions. It also divides them into three subgroups based on the distinctiveness of ''Sifrei Emet'' and ''Hamesh Megillot''.\n\nThe Three Poetic Books (''Sifrei Emet'')\n* ''Tehillim'' ([[Psalms]]) \u05ea\u05b0\u05d4\u05b4\u05dc\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd\n* ''Mishlei'' ([[Book of Proverbs]]) \u05de\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05dc\u05b5\u05d9\n* ''Iyy\u00f4bh'' ([[Book of Job]]) \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d1\nThe [[Five Megillot]] (''Hamesh Megillot'')\n* ''Sh\u012br Hashsh\u012br\u012bm'' ([[Song of Songs]]) or (Song of Solomon) \u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05b7\u05e9\u05c1\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd ([[Passover]])\n* ''R\u016bth'' ([[Book of Ruth]]) \u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05ea ([[Sh\u0101bh\u00fb\u2018\u00f4th]])\n* ''Eikhah'' ([[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]]) \u05d0\u05d9\u05db\u05d4 ([[Ninth of Av]]) [Also called ''Kinnot'' in Hebrew.]\n* ''Q\u014dheleth'' ([[Ecclesiastes]]) \u05e7\u05d4\u05dc\u05ea ([[Sukk\u00f4th]])\n* ''Est\u0113r'' ([[Book of Esther]]) \u05d0\u05b6\u05e1\u05b0\u05ea\u05b5\u05e8 ([[P\u00fbr\u00eem]])\nOther books\n* ''D\u0101n\u00ee\u2019\u0113l'' ([[Book of Daniel]]) \u05d3\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05b5\u05bc\u05d0\u05dc\n* ''\u2018Ezr\u0101'' ([[Book of Ezra]]\u2013[[Book of Nehemiah]]) \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8\u05d0\n* ''Divrei ha-Yamim'' ([[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]]) \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd\n\nThe Jewish textual tradition never finalized the order of the books in Ketuvim. The [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Bava Batra]] 14b\u201315a) gives their order as Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Daniel, Scroll of Esther, Ezra, Chronicles.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9NUejG2IGPMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage] The Babylonian Talmud, Vol. 7 of 9: Tract Baba Bathra (Last Gate) translated by Michael L.

While the Torah may have been considered canon by Israel as early as the 5th century BCE and the [[Former Prophets|Former]] and [[Latter Prophets]] were canonized by the 2nd century BCE, the Ketuvim was not a fixed canon until the 2nd century of the [[Common Era]].<ref name=\"Coogan2009\" />\n\nEvidence suggests, however, that the people of Israel were adding what would become the Ketuvim to their holy literature shortly after the canonization of the prophets. As early as 132 BCE references suggest that the Ketuvim was starting to take shape, although it lacked a formal title.{{sfn|Henshaw|1963|pp=16\u201317}} References in the four [[Gospels]] as well as other books of the New Testament indicate that many of these texts were both commonly known and counted as having some degree of religious authority early in the 1st century CE.\n\nMany scholars believe that the limits of the Ketuvim as canonized scripture were determined by the [[Council of Jamnia]] c. 90 CE. ''[[Against Apion]]'', the writing of [[Flavius Josephus|Josephus]] in 95 CE, treated the text of the Hebrew Bible as a closed canon to which \"... no one has ventured either to add, or to remove, or to alter a syllable...\"<ref>Lightfoot, Neil R.

The Torah always maintained its pre-eminence as the basis of the canon but the collection of prophetic writings, based on the ''Nevi'im'', had various [[hagiographa|hagiographical]] works incorporated into it. In addition, some newer books were included in the Septuagint, among these are the [[Books of the Maccabees|Maccabees]] and the [[Wisdom of Sirach]]. However, the book of [[Sirach]], is now known to have existed in a Hebrew version, since ancient Hebrew manuscripts of it were rediscovered in modern times. The Septuagint version of some Biblical books, like [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Esther|Esther]], are longer than those in the Jewish canon.<ref>Rick Grant Jones, ''Various Religious Topics'', \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20030606114529/http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Pines/7224/Rick/Septuagint/sp_books.html Books of the Septuagint]\", (Accessed 2006.9.5).</ref> Some of these [[deuterocanonical books]] (e.g. the [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]], and the [[2 Maccabees|second book of Maccabees]]) were not translated, but composed directly in Greek.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nSince [[Late Antiquity]], once attributed to a hypothetical late 1st-century [[Council of Jamnia#Developments attributed to Jamnia|Council of Jamnia]], mainstream [[Rabbinic Judaism]] rejected the Septuagint as valid Jewish scriptural texts. Several reasons have been given for this. First, some mistranslations were claimed. Second, the Hebrew source texts used for the Septuagint differed from the Masoretic tradition of Hebrew texts, which was chosen as canonical by the Jewish rabbis.<ref>\"The translation, which shows at times a peculiar ignorance of Hebrew usage, was evidently made from a codex which differed widely in places from the text crystallized by the Masorah.\" {{cite web|title=Bible Translations \u2013 The Septuagint|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3269-bible-translations|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref> Third, the rabbis wanted to distinguish their tradition from the newly emerging tradition of Christianity.<ref name=\"ndq\">\"[...] die griechische Bibel\u00fcbersetzung, die einem innerj\u00fcdischen Bed\u00fcrfnis entsprang [...] [von den] Rabbinen zuerst ger\u00fchmt (.)

After the [[Protestant Reformation]], many [[Protestant Bibles]] began to follow the Jewish canon and exclude the additional texts, which came to be called [[biblical apocrypha]]. The Apocrypha are included under a separate heading in the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version]] of the Bible, the basis for the [[Revised Standard Version]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/nets/edition/|title=NETS: Electronic Edition|publisher=Ccat.sas.upenn.edu|date=11 February 2011|accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Incorporations from Theodotion ===\nIn most ancient copies of the Bible which contain the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, the [[Book of Daniel]] is not the original Septuagint version, but instead is a copy of [[Theodotion]]'s translation from the Hebrew, which more closely resembles the Masoretic Text.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The original Septuagint version was discarded in favour of Theodotion's version in the 2nd to 3rd centuries CE. In Greek-speaking areas, this happened near the end of the 2nd century, and in Latin-speaking areas (at least in North Africa), it occurred in the middle of the 3rd century.

It has been proposed, and is thought highly likely by scholars, that \"Esdras B\" \u2013 the canonical Ezra\u2013Nehemiah \u2013 is Theodotion's version of this material, and \"Esdras A\" is the version which was previously in the Septuagint on its own.<ref name=\"EncBibTV\" />\n\n=== Final form ===\nSome texts are found in the Septuagint but are not present in the Hebrew.

Not all of these works are actually pseudepigraphical. It also refers to books of the New Testament canon whose authorship is misrepresented. The Old Testament pseudepigraphal works include the following:<ref name =\"Harris\">[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], ''Understanding the Bible''.

These are ancient [[Jewish]] religious works, traditionally ascribed to the prophet [[Enoch (Biblical figure)|Enoch]], the great-grandfather of the patriarch [[Noah]]. They are not part of the [[biblical canon]] used by [[Jews]], apart from [[Beta Israel]]. Most Christian denominations and traditions may accept the Books of Enoch as having some historical or theological interest or significance. It has been observed that part of the Book of Enoch is quoted in the [[Epistle of Jude]] (part of the New Testament) but Christian denominations generally regard the Books of Enoch as non-canonical or non-inspired.<ref>[http://reluctant-messenger.com/enoch.htm The Book of Enoch] \u2013 The Reluctant Messenger. Retrieved 14 June 2014.</ref> However, the Enoch books are treated as canonical by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] and [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]].\n\nThe older sections (mainly in the Book of the Watchers) are estimated to date from about 300&nbsp;BCE, and the latest part (Book of Parables) probably was composed at the end of the 1st century&nbsp;BCE.<ref>Fahlbusch E., Bromiley G.W. ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity: P\u2013Sh'' p. 411, {{ISBN|0-8028-2416-1}} (2004)</ref>\n\n===== Denominational views of pseudepigrapha =====\nThere arose{{When|date=May 2019}} in some Protestant biblical scholarship an extended use of the term ''pseudepigrapha'' for works that appeared as though they ought to be part of the biblical canon, because of the authorship ascribed to them, but which stood outside both the [[biblical canon]]s recognized by Protestants and Catholics.  These works were also outside the particular set of books that Roman Catholics called ''deuterocanonical'' and to which Protestants had generally applied the term Apocryphal.  Accordingly, the term ''pseudepigraphical'', as now used often among both Protestants and Roman Catholics (allegedly for the clarity it brings to the discussion), may make it difficult to discuss questions of pseudepigraphical authorship of canonical books dispassionately with a lay audience.  To confuse the matter further, Eastern Orthodox Christians accept books as canonical that Roman Catholics and most Protestant denominations consider pseudepigraphical or at best of much less authority.  There exist also churches that reject some of the books that Roman Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants accept.  The same is true of some [[Jewish denominations|Jewish sects]].  Many works that are apocryphal are otherwise considered genuine.{{clarify|date=May 2019}}\n\n==== Role of the Old Testament in Christian theology ====\n{{further|Sola scriptura|Christian theology}}\nThe Old Testament has always been central to the life of the Christian church. Bible scholar [[N.T. Wright]] says \"Jesus himself was profoundly shaped by the scriptures.\"{{sfn|Wright|2005|p=3}} He adds that the earliest Christians also searched those same Hebrew scriptures in their effort to understand the earthly life of Jesus. They regarded the \"holy writings\" of the Israelites as necessary and instructive for the Christian, as seen from Paul's words to Timothy (2 Timothy 3:15), and as pointing to the Messiah, and as having reached a climactic fulfillment in Jesus himself, generating the \"[[new covenant]]\" prophesied by [[Jeremiah]].<ref name=\"Wright\">{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=}}</ref>\n\n=== New Testament ===\n{{Main|Development of the New Testament canon}}\nThe New Testament is the name given to the second and final portion of the Christian Bible.

There have been some minor variations, additions or omissions, in some of the texts. When ancient scribes copied earlier books, they sometimes wrote notes on the margins of the page (''[[Glosses to the Bible#Glosses as marginal notes|marginal glosses]]'') to correct their text \u2013 especially if a scribe accidentally omitted a word or line \u2013 and to comment about the text. When later scribes were copying the copy, they were sometimes uncertain if a note was intended to be included as part of the text.\n\nThe three main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament are sometimes called the [[Alexandrian text-type]] (generally minimalist), the [[Byzantine text-type]] (generally maximalist), and the [[Western text-type]] (occasionally wild).

[[Jerome]] produced a 4th-century [[Latin]] edition of the Bible, known as the ''[[Vulgate]]'', that became the Catholic Church's official translation.]]\nThe Old Testament canon entered into Christian use in the Greek Septuagint translations and original books, and their differing lists of texts. In addition to the Septuagint, Christianity{{vague|date=December 2014}} subsequently added various writings that would become the New Testament. Somewhat different lists of accepted works continued to develop in antiquity. In the 4th century a series of [[synod]]s produced a list of texts equal to the 39, 46, 51, or 54-book canon of the Old Testament and to the 27-book canon of the New Testament that would be subsequently used to today, most notably the [[Synod of Hippo]] in 393 CE. Also ''c''. 400, [[Jerome]] produced a definitive Latin edition of the Bible (see [[Vulgate]]), the canon of which, at the insistence of the Pope, was in accord with the earlier Synods. With the benefit of hindsight it can be said that this process effectively set the New Testament canon, although there are examples of other canonical lists in use after this time.\n\nThe Protestant Old Testament of today has a 39-book canon \u2013 the number of books (though not the content) varies from the Jewish Tanakh only because of a different method of division \u2013 while the Roman Catholic Church recognizes 46 books (51 books with some books combined into 46 books) as the canonical Old Testament. The Eastern Orthodox Churches recognize 3 Maccabees, 1 Esdras, Prayer of Manasseh and Psalm 151 in addition to the Catholic canon. Some include 2 Esdras. The Anglican Church also recognizes a longer canon.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The term \"Hebrew Scriptures\" is often used as being synonymous with the Protestant Old Testament, since the surviving scriptures in Hebrew include only those books, while Catholics and Orthodox include additional texts that have not survived in Hebrew. Both Catholics and Protestants (as well as Greek Orthodox) have the same 27-book New Testament Canon.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gxEONS0FFlsC&pg=PA103&dq=Both+Catholics+and+Protestants+have+the+same+27-book+New+Testament+Canon#v=onepage&q=Both%20Catholics%20and%20Protestants%20have%20the%20same%2027-book%20New%20Testament%20Canon] ''Encyclopedia of Catholicism'', Frank K.

There are several different ancient versions of the Tanakh in Hebrew, mostly differing by spelling, and the traditional Jewish version is based on the version known as Aleppo Codex.

In addition, they translated the Hebrew Bible into several other languages.

The Latin translations were historically the most important for the Church in the West, while the Greek-speaking East continued to use the Septuagint translations of the Old Testament and had no need to translate the New Testament.\n\nThe earliest Latin translation was the [[Old Latin]] text, or ''[[Vetus Latina]]'', which, from internal evidence, seems to have been made by several authors over a period of time.

It has inspired men and women to acts of great service and courage, to fight for liberation and human development; and it has provided the ideological fuel for societies which have enslaved their fellow human beings and reduced them to abject poverty. ... It has, perhaps above all, provided a source of religious and moral norms which have enabled communities to hold together, to care for, and to protect one another; yet precisely this strong sense of belonging has in turn fuelled ethnic, racial, and international tension and conflict.{{sfn|Riches|2000|p=134}}}}\n\n=== Other religions ===\n{{Main|Islamic view of the Christian Bible}}\nIn [[Islam]], the Bible is held to reflect true unfolding [[revelation]] from [[God in Islam|God]]; but revelation which had been corrupted or distorted (in Arabic: ''[[tahrif]]''); which necessitated the giving of the [[Qur'an]] to the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]], [[Muhammad]], to correct this deviation.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nMembers of other religions may also seek inspiration from the Bible. For example, [[Rastafari]]s view the Bible as essential to their religion<ref>Becoming Rasta: Origins of Rastafari Identity in Jamaica. p. 171, Charles Price. 2009</ref> and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalists]] view it as \"one of many important religious texts\".<ref>Unitarian Universalism. p. 42, Zondervan Publishing, 2009</ref>\n\n=== Biblical studies ===\n{{Main|Biblical studies|Biblical criticism}}\n[[Biblical criticism]] refers to the investigation of the Bible as a text, and addresses questions such as authorship, dates of composition, and authorial intention. It is not the same as [[criticism of the Bible]], which is an assertion against the Bible being a source of information or ethical guidance, or observations that the Bible may have [[translation]] errors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baptistlink.com/creationists/expondoerrossbinvi.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021029221934/http://www.baptistlink.com/creationists/expondoerrossbinvi.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 October 2002|title=Expondo Os Erros Da Sociedade B\u00edblica Internacional|publisher=Baptistlink.com|year=2000|accessdate=13 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Higher criticism ===\n{{Main|Higher criticism|Lower criticism}}\nIn the 17th century [[Thomas Hobbes]] collected the current evidence to conclude outright that Moses could not have written the bulk of the Torah. Shortly afterwards the philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] published a unified critical analysis, arguing that the problematic passages were not isolated cases that could be explained away one by one, but pervasive throughout the five books, concluding that it was \"clearer than the sun at noon that the Pentateuch was not written by Moses ...\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gvrcHyusPbMC&pg=PA121&dq=clearer+than+the+sun+at+noon+that+the+Pentateuch+was+not+written+by+Moses#v=onepage&q=clearer%20than%20the%20sun%20at%20noon%20that%20the%20Pentateuch%20was%20not%20written%20by%20Moses ''Ten More Amazing Discoveries By George Potter''], Cedar Fort,  2005, p. 121</ref>\n\n== Archaeological and historical research ==\n{{Main|Biblical archaeology school|Historicity of the Bible}}\nBiblical archaeology is the [[archaeology]] that relates to and sheds light upon the Hebrew Scriptures and the Christian Greek Scriptures (or the New Testament). It is used to help determine the lifestyle and practices of people living in biblical times. There are a wide range of interpretations in the field of biblical archaeology. One broad division includes [[biblical maximalism]] which generally takes the view that most of the Old Testament or the [[Hebrew Bible]] is based on history although it is presented through the religious viewpoint of its time. It is considered to be the opposite of [[Biblical Minimalism|biblical minimalism]] which considers the Bible to be a purely [[post-exilic]] (5th century BCE and later) composition. Even among those scholars who adhere to biblical minimalism, the Bible is a historical document containing first-hand information on the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman era]]s, and there is universal scholarly consensus that the events of the 6th century BCE [[Babylonian captivity]] have a basis in history.\n\nThe historicity of the biblical account of the [[history of ancient Israel and Judah]] of the 10th to 7th centuries BCE is disputed in scholarship. The biblical account of the 8th to 7th centuries BCE is widely, but not universally, accepted as historical, while the verdict on the earliest period of the [[United Monarchy]] (10th century BCE) and the [[historicity of David]] is unclear. Archaeological evidence providing information on this period, such as the [[Tel Dan Stele]], can potentially be decisive. The biblical account of events of the [[Exodus from Egypt]] in the Torah, and the migration to the [[Promised Land]] and the period of [[Biblical judges|Judges]] are not considered historical in scholarship.<ref>* {{cite book|last=Finkelstein|first=Israel|authorlink=Israel Finkelstein|last2=Silberman|first2=Neil Asher|authorlink2=Neil Asher Silberman|title=The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|year=2001|isbn=978-0-7432-2338-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lu6ywyJr0CMC&pg=PA57&dq=Finkelstein+Bible+Unearthed+Exodus+unoccupied#v=onepage&q=unoccupied}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dever|first=William|authorlink=William G.

extradition bill|the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill]] by the [[Hong Kong government]].<ref name=\"bbc_49317695\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190213_trojanhorse\" /> Had it been enacted, the bill would have allowed the [[extradition]] of wanted criminal fugitives to territories with which [[Hong Kong]] does not currently have extradition agreements, including [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]].<ref name=\"nyt_20190610_whatis\" /> This led to concerns by some that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the jurisdiction and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|legal system

/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190522_chrispatten\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" />  and infringe on privacy and [[Freedom of speech by country|freedom of speech]] laws. As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, an investigation into [[Allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct surrounding the 2019 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of all arrested protesters, a retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Carrie Lam]]'s resignation along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] for election of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and the Chief Executive.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\" /><ref name=\"abc_66464962\" />\n\nDespite a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9&nbsp;June 2019, the government persisted with the bill.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"vox_18658650\" /> Protesters gathered outside the [[Legislative Council Complex]] to stall the bill's second reading on 12&nbsp;June,<ref name=\"scmp_3013797\" /><ref name=\"cnbc_20190610\" /><ref name=\"nyt_20190610_carriestandfast\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_20190610_pursuebill\" /> resulting in an [[612 Incident|intense standoff]] between the protesters and the police who deployed [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=\"time_20190613_battlefront\" /> An even bigger protest took place on 16 June, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters insisted on the complete withdrawal of the bill and reacted to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12&nbsp;June.<ref name=\"scmp_3014695\" /> The anniversary of the handover on 1&nbsp;July 2019 saw the [[storming of the Legislative Council Complex]],<ref name=\"hkfp_20190701_occupychamber\" /> and subsequent protests throughout the summer spread to different districts.<ref name=\"nyt_20190722_trainstation\" /> Police inaction when suspected triad members [[2019 Yuen Long attack|assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long]] on 21&nbsp;July 2019,<ref name=\"bbc_49074532\" /> the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|police storming of Prince Edward station]] on 31&nbsp;August 2019, and the large-scale demonstrations during the [[70th&nbsp;anniversary of the People's Republic of China]] on 1&nbsp;October, caused further escalation of the protests.<ref name=\"amnesty_20190901_policeprotest\" />\n\nLam eventually withdrew the bill on 4&nbsp;September 2019,<ref name=\"cnn_20190904_withdrawbill\" /><ref name=\"guardian_20190719_extraditionbill\" /><ref name=\"bbc_48917796\" /> but still refused to concede to the other four demands. Claiming to curb further protests, Lam invoked the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]] on 4&nbsp;October 2019 to implement an [[anti-mask law]], to counterproductive effect.<ref name=\"rthk_1484040\" /> As the protests dragged on, confrontations escalated as both sides became increasingly violent.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], would erode the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the Chinese Communist Party's internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping or snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted on by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representative of Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it on the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism.

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective was to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10&nbsp;years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to rise, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the police force to be disbanded.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|Police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12&nbsp;June&nbsp;2019.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March 2019 was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill.

Their claim it was impossible to recognise a person in the video footage was widely criticised.<ref name=\"standardhk_211952\"/>\n\n===Accountability of the HKPF===\nThe [[Independent Police Complaints Council]] (IPCC) has launched investigations into alleged incidents of police misconduct during the protests. Protesters are demanding an independent commission of inquiry instead, as the members of the IPCC are mainly pro-establishment and it lacks the power to investigate, make definitive judgements, and hand out penalties.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190704_policewatchdog\"/><ref name=\"eji_20190822\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\"/> Carrie Lam has rejected this demand and insisted that the IPCC was able to fulfill the task.<ref name=\"scmp_3025948\"/><ref name=\"diplomat_20190725_notjust\"/> On 8&nbsp; November 2019, a five-member expert panel, headed by Sir [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]] and appointed by Lam in September 2019 to advise the IPCC, concluded that the police watchdog lacked the \"powers, capacity and independent investigative capability necessary\" to fulfill its role as a police watchdog group and suggested the formation of an independent commission of inquiry given the current protest situation.<ref name=\"hkstandard_136821\"/> Members of the panel quit after negotiations to increase the IPCC's powers fell through. The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while its chair [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel have exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nPolice modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1&nbsp;October 2019 confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any disciplinary measures to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>. The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequences.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales had declined and consumers' appetite for spending had decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to the businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancelling their bookings, and some banks and shops were forced to shut their doors. Supplies of goods were also halted or obstructed because of the protests. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Because of lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Stock of protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. The desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce selling prices.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9&nbsp;June 2019 to late August 2019. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012; two large IPOs were shelved in June and July 2019. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to a year earlier,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13&nbsp;August 2019, the Airport Authority cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting.

conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was 'reaching the end of its life.' Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], would erode the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the Chinese Communist Party's internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping or snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted on by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representative of Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it on the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries. Of 167 countries, Hong Kong ranked&nbsp;75th while mainland China ranked&nbsp;153rd.<ref name=thestandard215668>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/215668/Hong-Kong-barely-passes-as-%27flawed-democracy%27|title=Hong Kong barely passes as 'flawed democracy'|last=Standard|first=The|website=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracyindex2019|title=Democracy Index 2019 A year of democratic setbacks and popular protest|website=[[Economist Intelligence Unit|EIU.com]]|url-access=registration|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] and the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence movement]] was marked by the campaign for the [[2016 New Territories East by-election]] by activist [[Edward Leung]].<ref name=\"scmp_3021518\" /> As fewer and fewer young people in Hong Kong identified themselves as Chinese, pollsters at the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the younger respondents were, the more distrustful they were of the Chinese government.<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /> By 2019, almost no Hong Kong youth identified themselves as Chinese.<ref name=\"economist_20190826_almostnobody\" /> The [[Moral and National Education controversy]] in 2012 severely shook young people's confidence in the systems which they believed protected their rights. With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire, along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media have noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> It has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> because, since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> This has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting great influence, Hong Kong also suffers from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city had the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the world in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective was to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10&nbsp;years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to rise, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the police force to be disbanded.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|Police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12&nbsp;June&nbsp;2019.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March 2019 was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill. In response, the Secretary of Security [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] announced that the government would resume second reading of the bill in full council on 12&nbsp;June 2019, bypassing the Bills Committee, whose role would have been to scrutinise it.<ref name=\"scmp_3011104\" />\n\nWith the possibility of a second reading of the bill, the CHRF launched their third protest march on 9&nbsp;June.

Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any disciplinary measures to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>.

As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012; two large IPOs were shelved in June and July 2019.

Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

These have been used to date the construction of the mounds to the [[Woodland period]], ending about 1000 A.D. The [[Choctaw people]], one of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the Southeast, occupied extensive territory in this area for centuries prior to European encounter. The Indian Mound Campground nearby was named for the earthwork monuments.\n\nArtifacts in the form of clay pot fragments and artwork dating from that period have been found east of Starkville at the [[Herman Mound and Village site]], which is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and can be accessed from the Indian Mound Campground.

They were removed to other lands west of the Mississippi River, in [[Indian Territory]], what is now the state of [[Oklahoma]].\n\nLike the indigenous peoples before them, white settlers were drawn to the Starkville area because of two large natural springs.

In that year, Rosenwald funds became available to build schools for these children, and the first two were erected in Trim Cane and in Turnpike. A total of eight Rosenwald Schools were built in the county between 1922 and 1927. The largest of these, Oktibbeha County Training School was opened in 1926 at a cost of $127,000.

The [[Choctaw people]], one of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the Southeast, occupied extensive territory in this area for centuries prior to European encounter. The Indian Mound Campground nearby was named for the earthwork monuments.\n\nArtifacts in the form of clay pot fragments and artwork dating from that period have been found east of Starkville at the [[Herman Mound and Village site]], which is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and can be accessed from the Indian Mound Campground.

By 1922, there were about twenty small schools for African-American children across the county. In that year, Rosenwald funds became available to build schools for these children, and the first two were erected in Trim Cane and in Turnpike. A total of eight Rosenwald Schools were built in the county between 1922 and 1927. The largest of these, Oktibbeha County Training School was opened in 1926 at a cost of $127,000. Other schools included a three-teacher school in Longview, Maben Colored School with two teachers, Pleasant Grove, which had four teachers, True Vine school (3 teachers), and Rock Hill School, which also had four teachers.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Morgan |first1=Ruth |title=Early African American schools in Oktibbeha County - FROM DAYS PAST |url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/document-view?p=AWNB&docref=news/13B918C9FA277768 |accessdate=20 September 2018 |date=11 December 11}}</ref>\n\nUntil 2013, Oktibbeha County was served by both the [[Oktibbeha County School District]] and the [[Starkville Public School District]]. Until 1970, a dual system was maintained, one for white students, and another for blacks. From 1923 until 1970, African Americans attended schools on what is now known as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard. These schools, originally built with Rosenwald funds, were variously known as the Oktibbeha County Training School,<ref>{{cite web|title=ABOUT O.C.T.S|url=http://octshhs.org/?page_id=1196|accessdate=10 November 2017}}</ref> Rosenwald School, and [[Henderson High School (Mississippi)|Henderson High School]].

Problems were anticipated, and arose, because many programs represented four-digit years with only the final two digits \u2013 making the year 2000 indistinguishable from 1900.  The assumption of a twentieth-century date in such programs could cause various errors, such as the incorrect display of dates and the inaccurate ordering of automated dated records or real-time events.\n\nIn 1997, the [[British Standards Institute]] (BSI) developed [[Technical standard|standard]] DISC PD2000-1 defining \"Year 2000 Conformity requirements\" as four rules:<ref name=\"BSI\">[http://www.empress.com/whatsnew/Y2K/bdd200.htm BSI Standard] on year 2000.</ref>\n\n# No valid date will cause any interruption in operations.<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n#Date-based functionality must behave consistently for dates prior to, during and after year 2000.<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n#In all interfaces and in all storage, the century must be unambiguous, either specified, or calculable by [[algorithm]].<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n#Year 2000 must be recognised as a leap year.<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n\nIt identifies two problems that may exist in many [[computer programs]]. First, the practice of representing the year with two digits became problematic with logical error(s) arising upon \"rollover\" from xx99 to xx00. This had caused some date-related processing to operate incorrectly for dates and times on and after 1 January 2000, and on other critical dates which were billed \"event horizons\". Without corrective action, long-working systems would break down when the \"... 97, 98, 99, 00 ...\" ascending numbering assumption suddenly became invalid.\n\nSecondly, some programmers had misunderstood the [[Gregorian calendar]] rule that determines whether years that are exactly divisible by 100 are not [[leap year]]s, and assumed that the year 2000 would not be a leap year. In reality, there is a rule in the Gregorian calendar system that states years divisible by 400 are leap years &ndash; thus making 2000 a leap year.\n\nCorrecting all of this, however, was not the largest part of the problem. By 1997, AT&T had estimated that \"60% of the time and money needed for its total compliance efforts\" would be devoted to testing the source code changes made to address the issue.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Testing for 2000 |magazine=[[InformationWeek]] |date=15 September 1997 |author1=Bruce Caldwell |author2=Andy Patrizio |pages=42\u201356 |via=ProQuest ABI/INFORM Collection}}</ref>\n\nCompanies and organisations in some countries, but not all, checked, fixed, and danay was is the best upgraded their computer systems to address the anticipated problem.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2000/02/leap-day-tuesday-last-y2k-worry |title=Leap Day Tuesday Last Y2K Worry |date=25 February 2000 |website=Wired |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> Very few computer failures were reported when the clocks rolled over into 2000.<ref name=\"bbc_boost\">{{cite news |last=Carrington |first=Damian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/590932.stm |title=Was Y2K bug a boost? |date=4 January 2000 |access-date=19 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040422221434/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/590932.stm |archive-date=22 April 2004 |work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nY2K is a [[numeronym]] and was the common abbreviation for the year 2000 software problem.

As space on disc and tape was also expensive, this also saved money by reducing the size of stored data files and data bases.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.comlinks.com/mag/accr.htm |title=Accrued Savings of the Year 2000 Computer Date Problem |last=Kappelman |first=Leon |last2=Scott |first2=Phil |date=25 November 1996 |website=Computerworld}}</ref>\n\nSome programs, when facing two digit years, could not distinguish between 2000 and 1900.

Back then, it was very important. We used to spend a lot of time running through various mathematical exercises before we started to write our programs so that they could be very clearly delimited with respect to space and the use of capacity. It never entered our minds that those programs would have lasted for more than a few years. As a consequence, they are very poorly documented.

Many tricks were used to squeeze needed data into fixed-field 80-character records. Saving two digits for every date field was significant in this effort.\n\nIn the 1960s, computer memory and mass storage were scarce and expensive. Early [[core memory]] cost one dollar per bit. Popular commercial computers, such as the [[IBM 1401]], shipped with as little as 2&nbsp;kilobytes of memory.<ref>The name IBM 1401 reflected the smallest amount of memory: 1,400 characters. {{Cite web |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/140x/A24-1403-5_1401_Reference_Apr62.pdf |title=IBM 1401 Reference manual|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809033646/http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/140x/A24-1403-5_1401_Reference_Apr62.pdf|archive-date=9 August 2010}}</ref> Programs often mimicked card processing techniques. Commercial programming languages of the time, such as [[COBOL]] and [[IBM RPG|RPG]], processed numbers in their character representations. Over time the punched cards were converted to [[magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]] and then disc files, but the structure of the data usually changed very little. Data was still input using punched cards until the mid-1970s. Machine architectures, programming languages and application designs were evolving rapidly. Neither managers nor programmers of that time expected their programs to remain in use for many decades. The realisation that databases were a new type of program with different characteristics had not yet come.\n\n====Early attention====\nThere were exceptions, of course. The first person known to publicly address this issue was [[Bob Bemer]], who had noticed it in 1958 as a result of work on genealogical software. He spent the next twenty years trying to make programmers, [[International Business Machines|IBM]], the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]] and the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] aware of the problem, with little result. This included the recommendation that the COBOL [[Picture clause]] should be used to specify four digit years for dates.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A4138-2004Jun24.html |title=Key computer coding creator dies |date=25 June 2004 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=25 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s the brokerage industry began to address this issue, mostly because of bonds with maturity dates beyond the year 2000. By 1987 the [[New York Stock Exchange]] had reportedly spent over $20 million, including \"a team of 100\" programmers on Y2K.<ref name=\"Globe.Y2K\">{{Cite news |last=Andrew-Gee |first=Eric |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-y2k-20th-anniversary-how-canada-prepared |title=Y2K: The strange, true history of how Canada prepared for an apocalypse that never happened, but changed us all |date=28 December 2019 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nDespite magazine articles on the subject from 1970 onward, the majority of programmers and managers only started recognising Y2K as a looming problem in the mid-1990s, but even then, inertia and complacency caused it to be mostly unresolved until the last few years of the decade. In 1989, [[Erik Naggum]] was instrumental in ensuring that internet mail used four digit representations of years by including a strong recommendation to this effect in the internet host requirements document RFC 1123.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123 |title=Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support |date=October 1989 |editor-last=Braden |editor-first=Robert |publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> On [[April Fools' Day]] of 1998 some companies set their mainframe computer dates to 2001, so that \"the wrong date will be perceived as good fun instead of bad computing\" while having a full day of testing.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[CIO magazine]] |date=15 November 1997 |title=Helpful Year 2000 hint |author=D. Kolstedt |page=12}}</ref>\n\nWhile using 3 digit years and 3 digit dates within that year was used by some, others chose to use the number of days since a fixed date, such as 1 January 1900.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[InformationWeek]] |quote=extends .. the 23rd century |title=Thinking Ahead  |date=28 October 1996  |page=8}}</ref> Inaction was not an option, and risked major failure. Embedded systems with similar date logic were expected to malfunction and cause utilities and other crucial infrastructure to fail.\n\nSaving space on stored dates persisted into the Unix era, with most systems representing dates to a single 32-bit word, typically representing dates as [[Unix time|elapsed seconds from some fixed date]], which causes the similar [[Y2K38 problem]].\n\n===Resulting bugs from date programming===\n[[File:JavaScript getYear Method Problem.png|thumb|Webpage screenshots showing the [[JavaScript]] .getYear() method problem, which depicts the Year 2000 problem]]\n[[File:Apple Lisa Workshop.png|thumb|An [[Apple Lisa]] does not accept the date]]\nStorage of a combined date and time within a fixed binary field is often considered a solution, but the possibility for software to misinterpret dates remains because such date and time representations must be relative to some known origin. Rollover of such systems is still a problem but can happen at varying dates and can fail in various ways. For example:\n* An upscale grocer's 1997 credit-card caused crash of their 10 cash registers, repeatedly, due to year 2000 expiration dates, was the source of the first Y2K-related lawsuit.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[InformationWeek]] |date=15 September 1997 |page=50 |last=Patrizio |first=Andy |title=Visa Debits The Vendors}}</ref>\n* The [[Microsoft Excel]] spreadsheet program had a very elementary Y2K problem: Excel (in both Windows and Mac versions, when they are set to start at 1900) incorrectly set the year 1900 as a leap year for compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/214326 |title=Microsoft Knowledge Base article 214326 |date=17 December 2015 |publisher=Microsoft Support |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> In addition, the years 2100, 2200, and so on, were regarded as leap years. This bug was fixed in later versions, but since the [[Epoch (computing)|epoch]] of the Excel timestamp was set to the meaningless date of [[0 January]] 1900 in previous versions, the year 1900 is still regarded as a leap year to maintain backward compatibility.\n* In the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], the standard library function to extract the year from a timestamp returns the year minus 1900. Many programs using functions from C, such as [[Perl]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], two programming languages widely used in web development, incorrectly treated this value as the last two digits of the year. On the web this was usually a harmless presentation bug, but it did cause many dynamically generated web pages to display 1 January 2000 as \"1/1/19100\", \"1/1/100\", or other variants, depending on the display format. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=\"many\". Please quantify and give examples of sites where this did or would have happened if not caught}}\n* [[JavaScript]] was changed due to concerns over the Y2K bug, and the return value for years changed and thus differed between versions from sometimes being a four digit representation and sometimes a two-digit representation forcing programmers to rewrite already working code to make sure web pages worked for all versions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docs.sun.com/source/816-6410-10/date.htm#1194138 |title=JavaScript Reference Javascript 1.2 |publisher=Sun Microsystems |access-date=7 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docs.sun.com/source/816-6408-10/date.htm#1194138 |title=JavaScript Reference Javascript 1.3 |publisher=Sun |access-date=7 June 2009}}</ref>\n* Older applications written for the commonly used UNIX [[Source Code Control System]] failed to handle years that began with the digit \"2\".\n* In the Windows 3.x file manager, dates displayed as 1/1/<!-- immutable date format-->19:0 for 1/<!-- immutable date format-->1/2000 (because the colon is the character after \"9\" in the [[ASCII]] character set). An update was available.\n* Some software, such as [[Math Blaster Episode I: In Search of Spot]] which only treats years as two-digit values instead of four, will give a given year as \"1900\", \"1901\", and so on, depending on the last two digits of the present year.\n\n===Date bugs similar to Y2K===\n{{main|Time formatting and storage bugs}}\n\n====4 January 1975====\nThis date overflowed the 12-bit field that had been used in the Decsystem 10 operating systems. There were numerous problems and crashes related to this bug while an alternative format was developed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/4.45.html |title=The Risks Digest Volume 4: Issue 45 |website=The Risks Digest}}</ref>\n\n====9 September 1999====\nEven before 1 January 2000 arrived, there were also some worries about 9 September 1999 (albeit less than those generated by Y2K). Because this date could also be written in the numeric format 9/9/99, it could have conflicted with the date value <code>9999</code>, frequently used to specify an unknown date. It was thus possible that database programs might act on the records containing unknown dates on that day. Data entry operators commonly entered 9999 into required fields for an unknown future date, (e.g., a termination date for cable television or telephone service), in order to process computer forms using [[CICS]] software.<ref>Stockton, J.R., \"[http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/critdate.htm Critical and Significant Dates]\" ''Merlyn''.</ref> Somewhat similar to this is the end-of-file code <code>9999</code>, used in older programming languages. While fears arose that some programs might unexpectedly terminate on that date, the bug was more likely to confuse computer operators than machines.\n\n====Leap years====\n{{Main|Zeller's congruence}}\nNormally, a year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by four. A year divisible by 100, however, is not a leap year in the Gregorian calendar unless it is also divisible by 400. For example, 1600 was a leap year, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. Some programs may have relied on the oversimplified rule that ''a year divisible by four is a leap year''. This method works fine for the year 2000 (because it is a leap year), and will not become a problem until 2100, when older legacy programs will likely have long since been replaced. Other programs contained incorrect leap year logic, assuming for instance that no year divisible by 100 could be a leap year. An assessment of this ''leap year problem'' including a number of real life code fragments appeared in 1998.<ref>A. van Deursen, \"[http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/~arie/papers/klint.pdf The Leap Year Problem]\" ''The Year/2000 Journal'' 2(4):65\u201370, July/August 1998.</ref> For information on why century years are treated differently, see [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\n====Year 2010 problem====\nSome systems had problems once the year rolled over to 2010. This was dubbed by some in the media as the \"Y2K+10\" or \"Y2.01K\" problem.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crn.com.au/News/163864,bank-of-queensland-hit-by-y201k-glitch.aspx |title=Bank of Queensland hit by \"Y2.01k\" glitch |date=4 January 2010 |publisher=CRN |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe main source of problems was confusion between hexadecimal number encoding and [[binary-coded decimal]] encodings of numbers. Both hexadecimal and BCD encode the numbers 0\u20139 as 0x0\u20130x9. But BCD encodes the number 10 as 0x10, whereas hexadecimal encodes the number 10 as 0x0A; 0x10 interpreted as a hexadecimal encoding represents the number 16.\n\nFor example, because the SMS protocol uses BCD for dates, some mobile phone software incorrectly reported dates of SMSes as 2016 instead of 2010. [[Windows Mobile]] is the first software reported to have been affected by this glitch; in some cases WM6 changes the date of any incoming SMS message sent after 1 January 2010 from the year \"2010\" to \"2016\".<ref name=\"wm6\">{{Cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10425455-56.html?tag=newsLatestHeadlinesArea.0#addcomm |title=Windows Mobile glitch dates 2010 texts 2016 |date=5 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"cellphone2010\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/windows-mobile-phones-suffer-y2k-10-bug-661062 |title=Windows Mobile phones suffer Y2K+10 bug |date=4 January 2010 |access-date=4 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061135/http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/windows-mobile-phones-suffer-y2k-10-bug-661062 |archive-date=23 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOther systems affected include [[EFTPOS]] terminals,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.itwire.com/content/view/30308/53/ |title=Bank of Queensland vs Y2K \u2013 an update |date=4 January 2010}}</ref> and the [[PlayStation 3]] (except the Slim model).<ref name=\"PS3-1\">{{Cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/error-8001050f-takes-down-playstation-network-5482365|title=Error: 8001050F Takes Down PlayStation Network|website=Gizmodo}}</ref>\n\nThe most important occurrences of such a glitch were in Germany, where upwards of 20 million bank cards became unusable, and with Citibank Belgium, whose digipass customer identification chips failed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rtlinfo.be/info/monde/europe/297916/bug-de-l-an-2010-en-allemagne-plus-de-20-millions-de-cartes-bancaires-inutilisables |title=2010 Bug in Germany |date=5 January 2010 |publisher=RTL |language=French |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Year 2038 problem====\n{{main|Year 2038 problem}}\n\nThe original [[Unix time]] datatype (<code>[[time_t]]</code>) stores a date and time as a signed long integer (on 32-bit systems a 32-bit integer) representing the number of seconds since 1 January 1970. During and after 2038, this number will exceed 2{{sup|31}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, the largest number representable by a signed [[long integer]] on 32-bit systems, causing the [[Year 2038 problem]] (also known as the Unix Millennium bug or [[Y2K38]]). As a long integer in 64-bit systems uses 64 bits, the problem does not realistically exist on 64-bit systems that use the [[LP64]] model.\n\n==Programming solutions{{anchor|bugfix}}==\nSeveral very different approaches were used to solve the Year 2000 problem in legacy systems. Five of them follow:\n;Date expansion\n: Two-digit years were expanded to include the century (becoming four-digit years) in programs, files, and databases. This was considered the \"purest\" solution, resulting in unambiguous dates that are permanent and easy to maintain. However, this method was costly, requiring massive testing and conversion efforts, and usually affecting entire systems.\n;Date compression\n: Dates can be compressed into binary 14-bit numbers.  This allows retention of [[data structure alignment]], using an [[integer]] value for years. Such a scheme is capable of representing 16384 different years; the exact scheme varies by the selection of [[Unix Epoch|epoch]].\n;Date re-partitioning\n: In legacy databases whose size could not be economically changed, six-digit year/month/day codes were converted to three-digit years (with 1999 represented as 099 and 2001 represented as 101, etc.) and three-digit days ([[ordinal date]] in year). Only input and output instructions for the date fields had to be modified, but most other date operations and whole record operations required no change. This delays the eventual roll-over problem to the end of the year 2899.\n;[[Date windowing|Windowing]]\n: Two-digit years were retained, and programs determined the century value only when needed for particular functions, such as date comparisons and calculations. (The century \"window\" refers to the 100-year period to which a date belongs.) This technique, which required installing small patches of code into programs, was simpler to test and implement than date expansion, thus much less costly. While not a permanent solution, windowing fixes were usually designed to work for several decades. This was thought acceptable, as older legacy systems tend to eventually get replaced by newer technology.<ref>\"''The Case for Windowing: Techniques That Buy 60 Years''\", article by Raymond B.

In both countries, the birth year was historically indicated by two digits only. This numbering system had already given rise to a similar problem, the \"[[Year 1900 problem]]\", which arose due to problems distinguishing between people born in the 20th and 19th centuries. Y2K fears drew attention to an older issue, while prompting a solution to a new problem. In Finland, the problem was solved by replacing the hyphen (\"-\") in the number with the letter \"A\" for people born in the 21st century (for people born before 1900, the sign was already \"+\"). In Norway, the range of the individual numbers following the birth date was altered from 0\u2013499 to 500\u2013999.\n\n===Romania===\nRomania also changed its national identification number in response to the Y2K problem, due to the birth year being represented by only two digits.

For example, they list \"01996\" as their year of founding.\n* While there was no one comprehensive internet Y2K effort, multiple internet trade associations and organisations banded together to form the Internet Year 2000 Campaign.<ref>[http://www.cybertelecom.org/year2000/ Internet Year 2000 Campaign] archived at Cybertelecom.</ref> This effort partnered with the White House's Internet Y2K Roundtable.\n\nThe Y2K issue was a major topic of discussion in the late 1990s and as such showed up in most popular media. A number of \"Y2K disaster\" books were published such as ''Deadline Y2K'' by Mark Joseph. Movies such as ''Y2K: Year to Kill'' capitalised on the currency of Y2K, as did numerous TV shows, comic strips, and computer games.\n\n==Fringe group responses==\nA variety of fringe groups and individuals such as those within some [[fundamentalist]] religious organizations, [[survivalists]], [[cults]], anti-social movements, [[self-sufficiency]] enthusiasts, [[communes]] and those attracted to [[conspiracy theories]], embraced Y2K as a tool to engender fear and provide a form of evidence for their respective theories. [[End of the world (civilization)|End-of-the-world]] scenarios and [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] themes were common in their communication.\n\nInterest in the survivalist movement peaked in 1999 in its second wave for that decade, triggered by Y2K fears. In the time before extensive efforts were made to rewrite computer programming codes to mitigate the possible impacts, some writers such as [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]], [[Ed Yourdon]], [[James Howard Kunstler]],<ref name=\"y2k2\">{{Cite web |url=http://kunstler.com/mags_y2k.html |title=My Y2K\u2014A Personal Statement |last=Kunstler |first=Jim |year=1999 |publisher=Kunstler, Jim |access-date=12 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927062527/http://kunstler.com/mags_y2k.html |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Ed Yardeni anticipated widespread power outages, food and gasoline shortages, and other emergencies. North and others raised the alarm because they thought Y2K code fixes were not being made quickly enough. While a range of authors responded to this wave of concern, two of the most survival-focused texts to emerge were ''Boston on Y2K'' (1998) by [[Kenneth W. Royce]], and Mike Oehler's ''The Hippy Survival Guide to Y2K''.\n\nY2K was also exploited by some [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] and [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] Christian leaders throughout the Western world, particularly in North America and Australia.<ref name=\"au.org\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.au.org/church-state/february-2000-church-state/featured/false-prophets-real-profits |title=False Prophets, Real Profits - Americans United |access-date=9 November 2016}}</ref> Their promotion of the perceived risks of Y2K was combined with [[end times]] thinking and [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[prophecies]] in an attempt to influence followers.<ref name=\"au.org\" /> The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported in late 1999, \"The Rev.

Problems were anticipated, and arose, because many programs represented four-digit years with only the final two digits \u2013 making the year 2000 indistinguishable from 1900.  The assumption of a twentieth-century date in such programs could cause various errors, such as the incorrect display of dates and the inaccurate ordering of automated dated records or real-time events.\n\nIn 1997, the [[British Standards Institute]] (BSI) developed [[Technical standard|standard]] DISC PD2000-1 defining \"Year 2000 Conformity requirements\" as four rules:<ref name=\"BSI\">[http://www.empress.com/whatsnew/Y2K/bdd200.htm BSI Standard] on year 2000.</ref>\n\n# No valid date will cause any interruption in operations.<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n#Date-based functionality must behave consistently for dates prior to, during and after year 2000.<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n#In all interfaces and in all storage, the century must be unambiguous, either specified, or calculable by [[algorithm]].<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n#Year 2000 must be recognised as a leap year.<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n\nIt identifies two problems that may exist in many [[computer programs]]. First, the practice of representing the year with two digits became problematic with logical error(s) arising upon \"rollover\" from xx99 to xx00. This had caused some date-related processing to operate incorrectly for dates and times on and after 1 January 2000, and on other critical dates which were billed \"event horizons\". Without corrective action, long-working systems would break down when the \"... 97, 98, 99, 00 ...\" ascending numbering assumption suddenly became invalid.\n\nSecondly, some programmers had misunderstood the [[Gregorian calendar]] rule that determines whether years that are exactly divisible by 100 are not [[leap year]]s, and assumed that the year 2000 would not be a leap year. In reality, there is a rule in the Gregorian calendar system that states years divisible by 400 are leap years &ndash; thus making 2000 a leap year.\n\nCorrecting all of this, however, was not the largest part of the problem. By 1997, AT&T had estimated that \"60% of the time and money needed for its total compliance efforts\" would be devoted to testing the source code changes made to address the issue.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Testing for 2000 |magazine=[[InformationWeek]] |date=15 September 1997 |author1=Bruce Caldwell |author2=Andy Patrizio |pages=42\u201356 |via=ProQuest ABI/INFORM Collection}}</ref>\n\nCompanies and organisations in some countries, but not all, checked, fixed, and upgraded their computer systems to address the anticipated problem.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2000/02/leap-day-tuesday-last-y2k-worry |title=Leap Day Tuesday Last Y2K Worry |date=25 February 2000 |website=Wired |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> Very few computer failures were reported when the clocks rolled over into 2000.<ref name=\"bbc_boost\">{{cite news |last=Carrington |first=Damian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/590932.stm |title=Was Y2K bug a boost? |date=4 January 2000 |access-date=19 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040422221434/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/590932.stm |archive-date=22 April 2004 |work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nY2K is a [[numeronym]] and was the common abbreviation for the year 2000 software problem. The abbreviation combines the letter ''Y'' for \"year\", the number 2 and a capitalized version of ''k'' for the SI unit prefix [[kilo-|kilo]] meaning 1000; hence, ''2K'' signifies 2000.

Back then, it was very important. We used to spend a lot of time running through various mathematical exercises before we started to write our programs so that they could be very clearly delimited with respect to space and the use of capacity. It never entered our minds that those programs would have lasted for more than a few years. As a consequence, they are very poorly documented.

Many tricks were used to squeeze needed data into fixed-field 80-character records. Saving two digits for every date field was significant in this effort.\n\nIn the 1960s, computer memory and mass storage were scarce and expensive. Early [[core memory]] cost one dollar per bit. Popular commercial computers, such as the [[IBM 1401]], shipped with as little as 2&nbsp;kilobytes of memory.<ref>The name IBM 1401 reflected the smallest amount of memory: 1,400 characters. {{Cite web |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/140x/A24-1403-5_1401_Reference_Apr62.pdf |title=IBM 1401 Reference manual|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809033646/http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/140x/A24-1403-5_1401_Reference_Apr62.pdf|archive-date=9 August 2010}}</ref> Programs often mimicked card processing techniques. Commercial programming languages of the time, such as [[COBOL]] and [[IBM RPG|RPG]], processed numbers in their character representations. Over time the punched cards were converted to [[magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]] and then disc files, but the structure of the data usually changed very little. Data was still input using punched cards until the mid-1970s. Machine architectures, programming languages and application designs were evolving rapidly. Neither managers nor programmers of that time expected their programs to remain in use for many decades. The realisation that databases were a new type of program with different characteristics had not yet come.\n\n====Early attention====\nThere were exceptions, of course. The first person known to publicly address this issue was [[Bob Bemer]], who had noticed it in 1958 as a result of work on genealogical software. He spent the next twenty years trying to make programmers, [[International Business Machines|IBM]], the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]] and the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] aware of the problem, with little result. This included the recommendation that the COBOL [[Picture clause]] should be used to specify four digit years for dates.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A4138-2004Jun24.html |title=Key computer coding creator dies |date=25 June 2004 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=25 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s the brokerage industry began to address this issue, mostly because of bonds with maturity dates beyond the year 2000.

Kolstedt |page=12}}</ref>\n\nWhile using 3 digit years and 3 digit dates within that year was used by some, others chose to use the number of days since a fixed date, such as 1 January 1900.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[InformationWeek]] |quote=extends .. the 23rd century |title=Thinking Ahead  |date=28 October 1996  |page=8}}</ref> Inaction was not an option, and risked major failure. Embedded systems with similar date logic were expected to malfunction and cause utilities and other crucial infrastructure to fail.\n\nSaving space on stored dates persisted into the Unix era, with most systems representing dates to a single 32-bit word, typically representing dates as [[Unix time|elapsed seconds from some fixed date]], which causes the similar [[Y2K38 problem]].\n\n===Resulting bugs from date programming===\n[[File:JavaScript getYear Method Problem.png|thumb|Webpage screenshots showing the [[JavaScript]] .getYear() method problem, which depicts the Year 2000 problem]]\n[[File:Apple Lisa Workshop.png|thumb|An [[Apple Lisa]] does not accept the date]]\nStorage of a combined date and time within a fixed binary field is often considered a solution, but the possibility for software to misinterpret dates remains because such date and time representations must be relative to some known origin. Rollover of such systems is still a problem but can happen at varying dates and can fail in various ways. For example:\n* An upscale grocer's 1997 credit-card caused crash of their 10 cash registers, repeatedly, due to year 2000 expiration dates, was the source of the first Y2K-related lawsuit.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[InformationWeek]] |date=15 September 1997 |page=50 |last=Patrizio |first=Andy |title=Visa Debits The Vendors}}</ref>\n* The [[Microsoft Excel]] spreadsheet program had a very elementary Y2K problem: Excel (in both Windows and Mac versions, when they are set to start at 1900) incorrectly set the year 1900 as a leap year for compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/214326 |title=Microsoft Knowledge Base article 214326 |date=17 December 2015 |publisher=Microsoft Support |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> In addition, the years 2100, 2200, and so on, were regarded as leap years. This bug was fixed in later versions, but since the [[Epoch (computing)|epoch]] of the Excel timestamp was set to the meaningless date of [[0 January]] 1900 in previous versions, the year 1900 is still regarded as a leap year to maintain backward compatibility.\n* In the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], the standard library function to extract the year from a timestamp returns the year minus 1900. Many programs using functions from C, such as [[Perl]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], two programming languages widely used in web development, incorrectly treated this value as the last two digits of the year. On the web this was usually a harmless presentation bug, but it did cause many dynamically generated web pages to display 1 January 2000 as \"1/1/19100\", \"1/1/100\", or other variants, depending on the display format. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=\"many\". Please quantify and give examples of sites where this did or would have happened if not caught}}\n* [[JavaScript]] was changed due to concerns over the Y2K bug, and the return value for years changed and thus differed between versions from sometimes being a four digit representation and sometimes a two-digit representation forcing programmers to rewrite already working code to make sure web pages worked for all versions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docs.sun.com/source/816-6410-10/date.htm#1194138 |title=JavaScript Reference Javascript 1.2 |publisher=Sun Microsystems |access-date=7 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docs.sun.com/source/816-6408-10/date.htm#1194138 |title=JavaScript Reference Javascript 1.3 |publisher=Sun |access-date=7 June 2009}}</ref>\n* Older applications written for the commonly used UNIX [[Source Code Control System]] failed to handle years that began with the digit \"2\".\n* In the Windows 3.x file manager, dates displayed as 1/1/<!-- immutable date format-->19:0 for 1/<!-- immutable date format-->1/2000 (because the colon is the character after \"9\" in the [[ASCII]] character set). An update was available.\n* Some software, such as [[Math Blaster Episode I: In Search of Spot]] which only treats years as two-digit values instead of four, will give a given year as \"1900\", \"1901\", and so on, depending on the last two digits of the present year.\n\n===Date bugs similar to Y2K===\n{{main|Time formatting and storage bugs}}\n\n====4 January 1975====\nThis date overflowed the 12-bit field that had been used in the Decsystem 10 operating systems. There were numerous problems and crashes related to this bug while an alternative format was developed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/4.45.html |title=The Risks Digest Volume 4: Issue 45 |website=The Risks Digest}}</ref>\n\n====9 September 1999====\nEven before 1 January 2000 arrived, there were also some worries about 9 September 1999 (albeit less than those generated by Y2K). Because this date could also be written in the numeric format 9/9/99, it could have conflicted with the date value <code>9999</code>, frequently used to specify an unknown date. It was thus possible that database programs might act on the records containing unknown dates on that day. Data entry operators commonly entered 9999 into required fields for an unknown future date, (e.g., a termination date for cable television or telephone service), in order to process computer forms using [[CICS]] software.<ref>Stockton, J.R., \"[http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/critdate.htm Critical and Significant Dates]\" ''Merlyn''.</ref> Somewhat similar to this is the end-of-file code <code>9999</code>, used in older programming languages. While fears arose that some programs might unexpectedly terminate on that date, the bug was more likely to confuse computer operators than machines.\n\n====Leap years====\n{{Main|Zeller's congruence}}\nNormally, a year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by four. A year divisible by 100, however, is not a leap year in the Gregorian calendar unless it is also divisible by 400. For example, 1600 was a leap year, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. Some programs may have relied on the oversimplified rule that ''a year divisible by four is a leap year''. This method works fine for the year 2000 (because it is a leap year), and will not become a problem until 2100, when older legacy programs will likely have long since been replaced. Other programs contained incorrect leap year logic, assuming for instance that no year divisible by 100 could be a leap year. An assessment of this ''leap year problem'' including a number of real life code fragments appeared in 1998.<ref>A. van Deursen, \"[http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/~arie/papers/klint.pdf The Leap Year Problem]\" ''The Year/2000 Journal'' 2(4):65\u201370, July/August 1998.</ref> For information on why century years are treated differently, see [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\n====Year 2010 problem====\nSome systems had problems once the year rolled over to 2010. This was dubbed by some in the media as the \"Y2K+10\" or \"Y2.01K\" problem.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crn.com.au/News/163864,bank-of-queensland-hit-by-y201k-glitch.aspx |title=Bank of Queensland hit by \"Y2.01k\" glitch |date=4 January 2010 |publisher=CRN |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe main source of problems was confusion between hexadecimal number encoding and [[binary-coded decimal]] encodings of numbers. Both hexadecimal and BCD encode the numbers 0\u20139 as 0x0\u20130x9. But BCD encodes the number 10 as 0x10, whereas hexadecimal encodes the number 10 as 0x0A; 0x10 interpreted as a hexadecimal encoding represents the number 16.\n\nFor example, because the SMS protocol uses BCD for dates, some mobile phone software incorrectly reported dates of SMSes as 2016 instead of 2010. [[Windows Mobile]] is the first software reported to have been affected by this glitch; in some cases WM6 changes the date of any incoming SMS message sent after 1 January 2010 from the year \"2010\" to \"2016\".<ref name=\"wm6\">{{Cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10425455-56.html?tag=newsLatestHeadlinesArea.0#addcomm |title=Windows Mobile glitch dates 2010 texts 2016 |date=5 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"cellphone2010\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/windows-mobile-phones-suffer-y2k-10-bug-661062 |title=Windows Mobile phones suffer Y2K+10 bug |date=4 January 2010 |access-date=4 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061135/http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/windows-mobile-phones-suffer-y2k-10-bug-661062 |archive-date=23 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOther systems affected include [[EFTPOS]] terminals,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.itwire.com/content/view/30308/53/ |title=Bank of Queensland vs Y2K \u2013 an update |date=4 January 2010}}</ref> and the [[PlayStation 3]] (except the Slim model).<ref name=\"PS3-1\">{{Cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/error-8001050f-takes-down-playstation-network-5482365|title=Error: 8001050F Takes Down PlayStation Network|website=Gizmodo}}</ref>\n\nThe most important occurrences of such a glitch were in Germany, where upwards of 20 million bank cards became unusable, and with Citibank Belgium, whose digipass customer identification chips failed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rtlinfo.be/info/monde/europe/297916/bug-de-l-an-2010-en-allemagne-plus-de-20-millions-de-cartes-bancaires-inutilisables |title=2010 Bug in Germany |date=5 January 2010 |publisher=RTL |language=French |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Year 2038 problem====\n{{main|Year 2038 problem}}\n\nThe original [[Unix time]] datatype (<code>[[time_t]]</code>) stores a date and time as a signed long integer (on 32-bit systems a 32-bit integer) representing the number of seconds since 1 January 1970. During and after 2038, this number will exceed 2{{sup|31}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, the largest number representable by a signed [[long integer]] on 32-bit systems, causing the [[Year 2038 problem]] (also known as the Unix Millennium bug or [[Y2K38]]). As a long integer in 64-bit systems uses 64 bits, the problem does not realistically exist on 64-bit systems that use the [[LP64]] model.\n\n==Programming solutions{{anchor|bugfix}}==\nSeveral very different approaches were used to solve the Year 2000 problem in legacy systems. Five of them follow:\n;Date expansion\n: Two-digit years were expanded to include the century (becoming four-digit years) in programs, files, and databases. This was considered the \"purest\" solution, resulting in unambiguous dates that are permanent and easy to maintain. However, this method was costly, requiring massive testing and conversion efforts, and usually affecting entire systems.\n;Date compression\n: Dates can be compressed into binary 14-bit numbers.  This allows retention of [[data structure alignment]], using an [[integer]] value for years. Such a scheme is capable of representing 16384 different years; the exact scheme varies by the selection of [[Unix Epoch|epoch]].\n;Date re-partitioning\n: In legacy databases whose size could not be economically changed, six-digit year/month/day codes were converted to three-digit years (with 1999 represented as 099 and 2001 represented as 101, etc.) and three-digit days ([[ordinal date]] in year). Only input and output instructions for the date fields had to be modified, but most other date operations and whole record operations required no change. This delays the eventual roll-over problem to the end of the year 2899.\n;[[Date windowing|Windowing]]\n: Two-digit years were retained, and programs determined the century value only when needed for particular functions, such as date comparisons and calculations. (The century \"window\" refers to the 100-year period to which a date belongs.) This technique, which required installing small patches of code into programs, was simpler to test and implement than date expansion, thus much less costly. While not a permanent solution, windowing fixes were usually designed to work for several decades. This was thought acceptable, as older legacy systems tend to eventually get replaced by newer technology.<ref>\"''The Case for Windowing: Techniques That Buy 60 Years''\", article by Raymond B.

Y2K fears drew attention to an older issue, while prompting a solution to a new problem. In Finland, the problem was solved by replacing the hyphen (\"-\") in the number with the letter \"A\" for people born in the 21st century (for people born before 1900, the sign was already \"+\"). In Norway, the range of the individual numbers following the birth date was altered from 0\u2013499 to 500\u2013999.\n\n===Romania===\nRomania also changed its national identification number in response to the Y2K problem, due to the birth year being represented by only two digits.

For example, they list \"01996\" as their year of founding.\n* While there was no one comprehensive internet Y2K effort, multiple internet trade associations and organisations banded together to form the Internet Year 2000 Campaign.<ref>[http://www.cybertelecom.org/year2000/ Internet Year 2000 Campaign] archived at Cybertelecom.</ref> This effort partnered with the White House's Internet Y2K Roundtable.\n\nThe Y2K issue was a major topic of discussion in the late 1990s and as such showed up in most popular media. A number of \"Y2K disaster\" books were published such as ''Deadline Y2K'' by Mark Joseph. Movies such as ''Y2K: Year to Kill'' capitalised on the currency of Y2K, as did numerous TV shows, comic strips, and computer games.\n\n==Fringe group responses==\nA variety of fringe groups and individuals such as those within some [[fundamentalist]] religious organizations, [[survivalists]], [[cults]], anti-social movements, [[self-sufficiency]] enthusiasts, [[communes]] and those attracted to [[conspiracy theories]], embraced Y2K as a tool to engender fear and provide a form of evidence for their respective theories. [[End of the world (civilization)|End-of-the-world]] scenarios and [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] themes were common in their communication.\n\nInterest in the survivalist movement peaked in 1999 in its second wave for that decade, triggered by Y2K fears. In the time before extensive efforts were made to rewrite computer programming codes to mitigate the possible impacts, some writers such as [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]], [[Ed Yourdon]], [[James Howard Kunstler]],<ref name=\"y2k2\">{{Cite web |url=http://kunstler.com/mags_y2k.html |title=My Y2K\u2014A Personal Statement |last=Kunstler |first=Jim |year=1999 |publisher=Kunstler, Jim |access-date=12 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927062527/http://kunstler.com/mags_y2k.html |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Ed Yardeni anticipated widespread power outages, food and gasoline shortages, and other emergencies. North and others raised the alarm because they thought Y2K code fixes were not being made quickly enough. While a range of authors responded to this wave of concern, two of the most survival-focused texts to emerge were ''Boston on Y2K'' (1998) by [[Kenneth W. Royce]], and Mike Oehler's ''The Hippy Survival Guide to Y2K''.\n\nY2K was also exploited by some [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] and [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] Christian leaders throughout the Western world, particularly in North America and Australia.<ref name=\"au.org\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.au.org/church-state/february-2000-church-state/featured/false-prophets-real-profits |title=False Prophets, Real Profits - Americans United |access-date=9 November 2016}}</ref> Their promotion of the perceived risks of Y2K was combined with [[end times]] thinking and [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[prophecies]] in an attempt to influence followers.<ref name=\"au.org\" /> The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported in late 1999, \"The Rev.

A humorous tribute to the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] and [[Horror film|horror]] [[B movie]]s of the 1930s through to the early 1960s, the musical tells the story of a newly engaged couple getting caught in a storm and coming to the home of a mad [[transvestite]] scientist, Dr Frank-N-Furter, unveiling his new creation, a sort of [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein-style monster]] in the form of an artificially made, fully grown, physically perfect [[Strongman (strength athlete)|muscle man]] named Rocky, complete \"with blond hair and a tan\".\n\nThe show was produced and directed by [[Jim Sharman]]. The original London production of the musical premiered at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] (Upstairs) on 19 June 1973 (after two previews on 16 and 18 June 1973). It later moved to several other locations in London and closed on 13 September 1980. The show ran for a total of 2,960 performances and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Theatre Awards#The Ned Award for Best Musical|''Evening Standard'' Theatre Award]] for Best Musical. Its 1974 debut in the US in Los Angeles had a successful nine-month run, but its 1975 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut at the [[Belasco Theatre]] lasted only three previews and forty-five showings, despite earning one [[Tony Award|Tony]] nomination and three [[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk]] nominations. Various international productions have since spanned across six continents as well as [[West End theatre|West End]] and Broadway revivals and eight UK tours. Actor [[Tim Curry]], who originated the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the original London production, became particularly associated with the musical.\n\nThe musical was adapted into the 1975 [[film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', starring O'Brien as Riff Raff, with Curry also reprising his role; the film has the longest-running release in film history. In 2016, it was adapted into the [[television film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again]]''. The musical was ranked eighth in a [[BBC Radio 2]] listener [[Opinion poll|poll]] of the \"Nation's Number One Essential Musicals\".<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/paige/essentialvote.shtml Nation's Number One Essential Musical] from a [[BBC]] website</ref> ''The Rocky Horror Show'' was one of eight UK musicals featured on [[Royal Mail]] stamps, issued in February 2011.<ref>{{cite news |title=Royal Mail musicals stamps set to rock you! |url=https://www.royalmailgroup.com/en/press-centre/press-releases/royal-mail/royal-mail-musicals-stamps-set-to-rock-you/ |accessdate=27 April 2019 |agency=Royal Mail group}}</ref>\n\nBeyond its cult status, ''The Rocky Horror Show'' is also widely said to have been an influence on countercultural and sexual liberation movements that followed on from the 1960s. It was one of the first popular musicals to depict fluid-sexuality during a time of division between generations and a lack of sexual difference acceptance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/539534/we-live-in-the-world-rocky-horror-created|title=We Live in the World 'Rocky Horror' Created|date=25 September 2015 |work=Flavorwire|accessdate=22 May 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rocky Horror London programme.jpg|thumb|left|Original programme of the musical from the Theatre Upstairs]]\nAs an out-of-work actor in London in the early 1970s, [[Richard O'Brien]] wrote ''The Rocky Horror Show'' to keep himself busy on winter evenings. Since his youth, he had developed a passion for [[science fiction]] and [[B movies|B horror movies]]; he wanted to combine elements of the unintentional humour of B horror movies, portentous dialogue of schlock-horror, [[Steve Reeves]] muscle films, and fifties [[rock and roll]] into ''The Rocky Horror Show''.<ref name=AmericanMusical>{{cite book |title = The American Musical and the Performance of Personal Identity |last=Knapp |first=Raymond |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2 March 2009 |pages=240 |isbn=978-0-691-14105-3}}</ref> A major theme running throughout the musical is [[transvestism]], which according to O'Brien was not originally meant to be as prominent as it ended up being. He conceived and wrote the play set against the backdrop of the glam era that had manifested itself throughout British popular culture in the early 1970s;<ref>{{cite book |last1=Auslander |first1=Philip |title=Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music |date=2006 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |page=49}}</ref> he has stated \"[[glam rock]] allowed me to be myself more\", allowing his concept to come into being.<ref name=\"Glam era\">{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Simon |title=Shock and Awe: Glam Rock and Its Legacy, from the Seventies to the Twenty-First Century |date=2016 |publisher=Faber & Faber}}</ref>\n\nO'Brien took a small amount of his unfinished ''Rocky Horror'' to Australian director [[Jim Sharman]], who decided he wanted to direct it at the small experimental space Upstairs at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], [[Sloane Square]], [[Chelsea, London]], which was used as a project space for new work.<ref name=Miller /> Sharman had received considerable local acclaim as the director of the original Australian productions of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' and ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. He went to London to direct the first British stage production of ''Superstar'', during which he met O'Brien, who had played King Herod for just one performance. Sharman brought fellow Australians [[Nell Campbell]] and long-time scenic designer partner [[Brian Thomson (scenic designer)|Brian Thomson]] into the production.\n\nStar [[Tim Curry]] recalled his first encounter with the script:\n{{quote|I'd heard about the play because I lived on [[Paddington Street]], off [[Baker Street]], and there was an old gym a few doors away. I saw Richard O'Brien in the street, and he said he'd just been to the gym to see if he could find a muscleman who could sing. I said, \"Why do you need him to sing?\" [laughs] And he told me that his musical was going to be done, and I should talk to Jim Sharman. He gave me the script, and I thought, \"Boy, if this works, it's going to be a smash.\"<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/146232172/Tim-Curry-intervirew |title=Curry Prefers the Sidelight for Now |publisher=[[United Media|NEA]] newspaper syndicate |authorlink=Frank Lovece |first=Frank |last=Lovece |date=8 December 1992 |accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nThe original creative team was then rounded out by costume designer [[Sue Blane]] and musical director [[Richard Hartley (composer)|Richard Hartley]], although Pete Moss would later take over as musical director. [[Michael White (producer)|Michael White]] was also brought in to produce ''Rocky Horror''. As the musical went into rehearsal, the working title for it became ''They Came from Denton High'', but it was changed just before previews at the suggestion of Sharman to ''The Rocky Horror Show''.<ref name=Miller>{{cite book |title = Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll, and Musicals | last=Miller | first=Scott | publisher = Northeastern |date=11 October 2011 |page = 114 | isbn=978-1-55553-743-2}}</ref><ref>Thomson, Brian, ed.

King was involved heavily in the initial promotion for the show, as well as being the minority backer of it financially with White having a majority share.\n\nThe impact at the Royal Court Upstairs allowed the production be transferred to the 230-seat [[Chelsea Classic Cinema]] nearby on [[Kings Road]] from 14 August 1973 to 20 October 1973.<ref name=Shuker>{{cite book |title=Understanding popular music |url=https://archive.org/details/understandingpop0000shuk_i1i5 |url-access=registration |last=Shuker |first=Roy |publisher=Routledge; annotated edition |date=1 November 1994 |page=[https://archive.org/details/understandingpop0000shuk_i1i5/page/160 160] |isbn=978-0-415-10722-8}}</ref> ''Rocky Horror'' found a quasi-permanent home at the 500-seat King's Road Theatre\u2014another cinema house, even further down Kings Road\u2014from 3 November 1973. The show received critical praise and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Award|''Evening Standard'' Award]] for Best Musical. When Richard O'Brien played Riff Raff in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''Rocky Horror'' in 1974 [[Robert Longden (actor)|Robert Longden]] took over the role in London.\n\nThe show's run at the King's Road Theatre ended on 31 March 1979; it then transferred to the Comedy Theatre (now the [[Harold Pinter Theatre]]) to begin performances on 6 April 1979. At the new venue, ''Rocky Horror'' required some restaging, for the Comedy was the first theatre at which the musical had played that possessed a traditional [[proscenium]] arch stage. For the first time, the musical was also broken into two acts with an interval. It finished its run there on 13 September 1980.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nThe Usherette, sometimes referred to as \"Trixie\", who works in a derelict cinema, introduces tonight's \"film\" in a song (\"[[Science Fiction/Double Feature]]\"), with masked Phantoms providing the backing vocals.\n\nAfter attending the wedding of his best friend since high school (Ralph Hapschatt, now married to Janet Weiss' friend Betty Munroe), Brad Majors confesses his love to Janet Weiss (\"[[Dammit Janet]]\") and the two become engaged. The Narrator appears and explains that Brad and Janet are leaving Denton to visit Dr Everett Scott, their former science tutor, while driving into a rainstorm. During the trip, their car has a flat tire and they are forced to walk through the rain to seek a telephone in an old castle (\"[[Over at the Frankenstein Place]]\").\n\nThe Narrator explains that Brad and Janet are feeling \"apprehensive and uneasy\", but must accept any help that they are offered. As Brad and Janet arrive, Riff Raff, the hunchbacked handyman and live-in butler, greets them, and his sister Magenta, the maid, appears. Riff Raff, Magenta and Columbia (a groupie) speak briefly of an unlucky delivery boy named Eddie who fell victim to unfortunate circumstances because he botched a delivery, before performing the show's signature dance number (\"[[Time Warp (song)|Time Warp]]\"*). Brad and Janet try to leave at this point, but are stopped when Dr Frank-N-Furter, a [[Pansexuality|pansexual]], [[cross-dressing]] [[mad scientist]], arrives. He introduces himself as \"a sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania\" and invites Brad and Janet up to his laboratory (\"[[Sweet Transvestite]]\"). As he goes up, Brad and Janet are stripped to their underwear to dry off.\n\nBrad and Janet enter the laboratory, where Frank-N-Furter gives them [[White coat|laboratory coats]] to wear. Frank announces that he has discovered the secret to life itself. He unveils his creation, a blond, well-built man named Rocky, who is brought to life. As his bandages are removed, Rocky worries about his predicament (\"The Sword of Damocles\"). Frank admires Rocky's physique by singing a tribute to muscle builders (\"Charles Atlas Song\"/\"I Can Make You a Man\"**). A Coca-Cola freezer in the laboratory opens to reveal Frank and Columbia's former lover, Eddie, a biker covered in surgical scars, who has been rendered a (slightly more) brain-damaged zombie, intent on rescuing Columbia, and escaping the castle while successfully causing large amounts of damage to Frank's laboratory, exhibiting signs of partially returning memory of the way he lived life in the past (\"[[Hot Patootie (Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?)|Hot Patootie \u2013 Bless My Soul]]\"). Frank panics, forces Eddie back into the freezer and hacks him to death (his weapon of choice typically being a pick axe or chainsaw). Frank tells Rocky \u2014 the recipient of the other half of Eddie's brain \u2014 that he prefers him over Eddie (\"Charles Atlas Song (Reprise)\"/\"I Can Make You a Man (Reprise)\"**), as although he and Eddie had a strong mental relationship, he had no muscle, and therefore, had to go. Brad and Janet, somewhat flustered after witnessing the re-murdering of Eddie, are then ushered to separate bedrooms for the night.\n\n===Act II===\nThe Narrator foreshadows that Brad and Janet may be unsafe. Janet enjoys Brad's advances in her darkened bedroom before realizing that it is Frank in disguise. He convinces Janet that pleasure is no crime, and after she asks him to promise not to tell Brad, they resume their lovemaking. The scene changes to Brad's darkened bedroom, where Brad makes love to Janet before discovering that, once again, it is Frank in disguise. Frank promises not to tell Janet, but as they resume, Riff Raff interrupts on the television monitor with the message that Rocky has escaped. Janet searches for Brad in the laboratory and discovers Rocky hiding there. Checking the television monitor, Janet sees Brad in bed with Frank and seduces Rocky (\"[[Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me]]\"). While searching the television monitor for Rocky, the rest of the group discovers that Janet has slept with him and Brad becomes hurt and angry (\"Once in a While\"). Riff Raff then notifies Frank that there is another visitor entering the castle: Dr. Everett Scott, the [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] science tutor whom Brad and Janet intended to visit.\n\nDr Scott is pushed into the laboratory by Columbia, where Frank accuses him and Brad of trying to investigate his castle, knowing that Dr Scott has connections with the [[FBI]]. Dr Scott assures him that he has come in search of Eddie, who is revealed to be his nephew (\"Eddie's Teddy\"). Frank displays Eddie's corpse to the group and then uses a device to electronically restrain the three visitors and a rebellious Rocky to the floor (\"Planet Schmanet Janet\"); the inhabitants of the castle are revealed to be space aliens led by Frank, who abandoned their original mission in order to engage in kinky sex with Earthlings and work on Rocky. Magenta insists that they return to their home planet now that they have been found out; Frank refuses and, instead, declares his intentions to put on a \"floor show\".\n\nUnder Frank's influence, Columbia, Rocky, Brad, and Janet perform song and dance routines while clad in lingerie ([[Rose Tint My World|\"Rose Tint My World (Floor Show)\"]]). After, Frank entices them to lose all inhibition and give in to their natural carnal instincts, resulting in everyone beginning to engage in [[Orgy|orgiastic sex]] (\"Don't Dream It \u2013 Be It\") before Frank leads them into the rousing concluding number of the floor show (\"Wild and Untamed Thing\"). The show comes to an abrupt end when Riff Raff and Magenta enter, wearing spacesuits and carrying [[ray gun]]s. Riff Raff declares that he is usurping Frank's authority and taking them all back to their home planet (\"Transit Beam\"). Frank makes a final plea for sympathy from Riff Raff, trying to make him understand his desire to spend the rest of his life having sex with Earthlings (\"[[I'm Going Home (Rocky Horror song)|I'm Going Home]]\"). Riff Raff is unmoved and guns down Columbia, Frank, and Rocky before ordering Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott to leave.\n\nAs the trio evacuates the castle, Riff Raff and Magenta express their excitement to return to their world and do the \"Time Warp\" again with their fellow Transylvanians (\"Spaceship\"). Brad and Janet watch as the castle blasts off into outer space, confused about the implications of their sexual escapades (\"Super Heroes\"). To conclude his tale, the Narrator says \"and crawling on the planet's face, insects called the human race, lost in time, and lost in space \u2013 and meaning.\" As the show ends, The Usherette returns to recount the night's events (\"Science Fiction/Double Feature (Reprise)\").\n\n* In the original London and Los Angeles productions, \"Sweet Transvestite\" came before \"Time Warp\". This was changed for the [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|film version]] and was subsequently updated for the stage version when O'Brien revised the script for the 1990 [[West End theatre|West End]] revival.\n* \"Charles Atlas Song\" was replaced by a reworked version of the song, \"I Can Make You a Man\", for the film version. O'Brien's revision of the script in 1990 featured a hybrid of the two songs under the title \"I Can Make You a Man\", in the 1999 revised script this song was replaced by the film version, which continues to be used in all major productions. The reprise remains unchanged except for the title.\n\n==Other productions==\n\n===Original Los Angeles production (American premiere)===\n[[Lou Adler]] had made millions with risky ventures such as [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey Pop]].

Miller]] produced the original Sydney production of Rocky Horror, which opened on 19 April 1974 at the New Arts Cinema (formerly The Astor, later The Valhalla and now an office building) in [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]]. It starred [[Reg Livermore]] as Frank-N-Furter, Jane Harders as Janet Weiss, [[Kate Fitzpatrick]] as Usherette and Magenta, [[Arthur Dignam]] as Narrator, Sal Sharah as Riff-Raff, John Paramor as Brad Majors, Graham Matters as Rocky, Maureen Elkner as Columbia, David Cameron as Eddie and Dr. Scott with [[Bob Hudson (singer)|Bob Hudson]] and Piero Von Arnam and Julie McGregor.\n\n===Original Melbourne/Adelaide production===\nAfter eighteen-month run in Sydney, Harry M. Miller's production moved to Melbourne, with [[Max Phipps]] taking over the star role. It opened at the Regent Palace Theatre on 24 October 1975 and ran through 19 months and 458 performances, finally closing on 28 May 1977.<ref>''The Rocky Horror Show'', Regent Place Theatre, 1975.[https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/67975 www.ausstage.edu.au]</ref>\n\nThe Melbourne production included Max Phipps - Frank N Furter; [[Gregory Apps]] - Brad (later Stephen Clark); Paula Maxwell - Janet (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Diana Greentree); [[Tommy Dysart]] - narrator; Sal Sharah - Riff-Raff; Robyn Moase - Magenta (later Joan Brockenshire); Sue Smithers - Columbia (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Joan Millar); Graham Matters - Rocky (later Grant Whiteman, Clive Blackie); Terry Bader - Eddie/Dr Scott (later David Cameron, William Gluth).<ref name=\"auto\" />  When Paula Maxwell left, resident stage director, Roland Rocchiccioli, moved Kear (at her request) into the role of Janet, and Joan Miller, who was an understudy, took over from Kear as Columbia. \nIt was in Melbourne, during the Sword of Damocles number, that Grant Whiteman fell while swinging on ladder and being pursued by Max Phipps. Fortunately, there was a Doctor in the house. Without missing a beat, Rocchiccioli told Clive Blackie to get into the costume: \"This is your big chance. You're on!\" he said. The show picked-up from where Whiteman had fallen and went-on without further hitch. Soon after that Whiteman left, and, to Blackie's surprise, Rocchiccioli put him into the role - without hesitation. He said to him: \"You're the understudy. Of course you take over. That's what you're here for!\" He proved a very popular Rocky. What he lacked in height he made-up for in muscle. \nThe show then transferred to Adelaide, where it opened on 12 August 1977 at The Warner Theatre. Max Phipps, Diana Greentree, Joan Millar, Tommy Dysart and Joan Brockenshire went on to reprise their roles from the Melbourne production. Staged by Roland Rocchiccioli, the Adelaide production \u2013 which was a transfer of Jim Sharman's original Sydney and Melbourne productions, and adapted for the new theatre, was not a success, and closed after only two months. As Rocchiccioli said on ABC Television in Adelaide, talking with Clive Hale: \"It is the same Jim Sharman production as Melbourne. It is Brian Thomson's design, except the set has been altered slightly because this is not a television theatre in the last days of its existence!\" Rocchiccioli later said he was astonished that it did not work in Adelaide after playing in Melbourne for the two-years previous. Some weeks the company did ten performances, so great was the demand for tickets. It would have gone on running - possibly for another year - had Max Phipps not decided to leave. He was exhausted. In the final months Harry M Miller was selling standing-room at the back of the theatre for up to 50-patrons per performance.\n\nAfter several weeks in Adelaide, [[Jon Finlayson]] replaced Max Phipps as Frank-N-Furter. Max had come-in to the production at the last moment, after Darrell Hilton and Rocchiccioli agreed on a parting of the ways, just days before the opening night. Other cast members included Tony Preece as Brad; [[Keith Reid]] (who was the Melbourne understudy) as Riff-Raff; Bill Binks as Eddie/Dr. Scott; and [[Shane Bourne]] as Rocky. The Adelaide reviews were\nsavage, and killed the production. Everyone was taken by surprise, including Max Phipps, who was brilliant in the role. Rocchiccioli said at the time: \"It's baffling. Nothing has changed from Melbourne, and it's difficult to know why they hate it so much.\"  It is the only time the Rocky Horror Show has not been critically applauded in Australia.\n\n<ref name=\"auto\">''The Rocky Horror Picture Show FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Campy Cult Classic'' (2016) by Dave Thompson; Applause Theatre & Cinema Books</ref><ref>Adelaide Programme 1977.</ref>\n\n===Original New York City (Broadway) production===\n[[File:The Rocky Horror Show Broadway.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Original Broadway poster]]\nIn early 1975, Adler closed the show at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]] after a ten-month run.

Well, I'm a blue-eyed blonde soul lost in a body of a bumpkin for fifty years and nobody ever defended me. Don't I have human rights? Like I said: if the father hits them, they will know it's wrong and will have sex with their guy friend from school, they will not say they are trans people, they will try to find a man to them and will stop searching for the spotlight. The spotlight is for Judy [Garland], Barbra [Streisand] and Rog\u00e9ria [a very famous Brazilian trans actress], the rest is a bunch of junkie fagot from rave parties.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nFollowing the event, many Facebook users have expressed outrage at Botelho's claims.

A humorous tribute to the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] and [[Horror film|horror]] [[B movie]]s of the 1930s through to the early 1960s, the musical tells the story of a newly engaged couple getting caught in a storm and coming to the home of a mad [[transvestite]] scientist, Dr Frank-N-Furter, unveiling his new creation, a sort of [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein-style monster]] in the form of an artificially made, fully grown, physically perfect [[Strongman (strength athlete)|muscle man]] named Rocky, complete \"with blond hair and a tan\".\n\nThe show was produced and directed by [[Jim Sharman]]. The original London production of the musical premiered at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] (Upstairs) on 19 June 1973 (after two previews on 16 and 18 June 1973). It later moved to several other locations in London and closed on 13 September 1980. The show ran for a total of 2,960 performances and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Theatre Awards#The Ned Award for Best Musical|''Evening Standard'' Theatre Award]] for Best Musical. Its 1974 debut in the US in Los Angeles had a successful nine-month run, but its 1975 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut at the [[Belasco Theatre]] lasted only three previews and forty-five showings, despite earning one [[Tony Award|Tony]] nomination and three [[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk]] nominations. Various international productions have since spanned across six continents as well as [[West End theatre|West End]] and Broadway revivals and eight UK tours. Actor [[Tim Curry]], who originated the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the original London production, became particularly associated with the musical.\n\nThe musical was adapted into the 1975 [[film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', starring O'Brien as Riff Raff, with Curry also reprising his role; the film has the longest-running release in film history. In 2016, it was adapted into the [[television film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again]]''. The musical was ranked eighth in a [[BBC Radio 2]] listener [[Opinion poll|poll]] of the \"Nation's Number One Essential Musicals\".<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/paige/essentialvote.shtml Nation's Number One Essential Musical] from a [[BBC]] website</ref> ''The Rocky Horror Show'' was one of eight UK musicals featured on [[Royal Mail]] stamps, issued in February 2011.<ref>{{cite news |title=Royal Mail musicals stamps set to rock you! |url=https://www.royalmailgroup.com/en/press-centre/press-releases/royal-mail/royal-mail-musicals-stamps-set-to-rock-you/ |accessdate=27 April 2019 |agency=Royal Mail group}}</ref>\n\nBeyond its cult status, ''The Rocky Horror Show'' is also widely said to have been an influence on countercultural and sexual liberation movements that followed on from the 1960s. It was one of the first popular musicals to depict fluid-sexuality during a time of division between generations and a lack of sexual difference acceptance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/539534/we-live-in-the-world-rocky-horror-created|title=We Live in the World 'Rocky Horror' Created|date=25 September 2015 |work=Flavorwire|accessdate=22 May 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rocky Horror London programme.jpg|thumb|left|Original programme of the musical from the Theatre Upstairs]]\nAs an out-of-work actor in London in the early 1970s, [[Richard O'Brien]] wrote ''The Rocky Horror Show'' to keep himself busy on winter evenings. Since his youth, he had developed a passion for [[science fiction]] and [[B movies|B horror movies]]; he wanted to combine elements of the unintentional humour of B horror movies, portentous dialogue of schlock-horror, [[Steve Reeves]] muscle films, and fifties [[rock and roll]] into ''The Rocky Horror Show''.<ref name=AmericanMusical>{{cite book |title = The American Musical and the Performance of Personal Identity |last=Knapp |first=Raymond |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2 March 2009 |pages=240 |isbn=978-0-691-14105-3}}</ref> A major theme running throughout the musical is [[transvestism]], which according to O'Brien was not originally meant to be as prominent as it ended up being. He conceived and wrote the play set against the backdrop of the glam era that had manifested itself throughout British popular culture in the early 1970s;<ref>{{cite book |last1=Auslander |first1=Philip |title=Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music |date=2006 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |page=49}}</ref> he has stated \"[[glam rock]] allowed me to be myself more\", allowing his concept to come into being.<ref name=\"Glam era\">{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Simon |title=Shock and Awe: Glam Rock and Its Legacy, from the Seventies to the Twenty-First Century |date=2016 |publisher=Faber & Faber}}</ref>\n\nO'Brien took a small amount of his unfinished ''Rocky Horror'' to Australian director [[Jim Sharman]], who decided he wanted to direct it at the small experimental space Upstairs at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], [[Sloane Square]], [[Chelsea, London]], which was used as a project space for new work.<ref name=Miller /> Sharman had received considerable local acclaim as the director of the original Australian productions of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' and ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. He went to London to direct the first British stage production of ''Superstar'', during which he met O'Brien, who had played King Herod for just one performance. Sharman brought fellow Australians [[Nell Campbell]] and long-time scenic designer partner [[Brian Thomson (scenic designer)|Brian Thomson]] into the production.\n\nStar [[Tim Curry]] recalled his first encounter with the script:\n{{quote|I'd heard about the play because I lived on [[Paddington Street]], off [[Baker Street]], and there was an old gym a few doors away. I saw Richard O'Brien in the street, and he said he'd just been to the gym to see if he could find a muscleman who could sing. I said, \"Why do you need him to sing?\" [laughs] And he told me that his musical was going to be done, and I should talk to Jim Sharman. He gave me the script, and I thought, \"Boy, if this works, it's going to be a smash.\"<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/146232172/Tim-Curry-intervirew |title=Curry Prefers the Sidelight for Now |publisher=[[United Media|NEA]] newspaper syndicate |authorlink=Frank Lovece |first=Frank |last=Lovece |date=8 December 1992 |accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nThe original creative team was then rounded out by costume designer [[Sue Blane]] and musical director [[Richard Hartley (composer)|Richard Hartley]], although Pete Moss would later take over as musical director. [[Michael White (producer)|Michael White]] was also brought in to produce ''Rocky Horror''. As the musical went into rehearsal, the working title for it became ''They Came from Denton High'', but it was changed just before previews at the suggestion of Sharman to ''The Rocky Horror Show''.<ref name=Miller>{{cite book |title = Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll, and Musicals | last=Miller | first=Scott | publisher = Northeastern |date=11 October 2011 |page = 114 | isbn=978-1-55553-743-2}}</ref><ref>Thomson, Brian, ed.

The show received critical praise and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Award|''Evening Standard'' Award]] for Best Musical. When Richard O'Brien played Riff Raff in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''Rocky Horror'' in 1974 [[Robert Longden (actor)|Robert Longden]] took over the role in London.\n\nThe show's run at the King's Road Theatre ended on 31 March 1979; it then transferred to the Comedy Theatre (now the [[Harold Pinter Theatre]]) to begin performances on 6 April 1979. At the new venue, ''Rocky Horror'' required some restaging, for the Comedy was the first theatre at which the musical had played that possessed a traditional [[proscenium]] arch stage. For the first time, the musical was also broken into two acts with an interval. It finished its run there on 13 September 1980.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nThe Usherette, sometimes referred to as \"Trixie\", who works in a derelict cinema, introduces tonight's \"film\" in a song (\"[[Science Fiction/Double Feature]]\"), with masked Phantoms providing the backing vocals.\n\nAfter attending the wedding of his best friend since high school (Ralph Hapschatt, now married to Janet Weiss' friend Betty Munroe), Brad Majors confesses his love to Janet Weiss (\"[[Dammit Janet]]\") and the two become engaged. The Narrator appears and explains that Brad and Janet are leaving Denton to visit Dr Everett Scott, their former science tutor, while driving into a rainstorm. During the trip, their car has a flat tire and they are forced to walk through the rain to seek a telephone in an old castle (\"[[Over at the Frankenstein Place]]\").\n\nThe Narrator explains that Brad and Janet are feeling \"apprehensive and uneasy\", but must accept any help that they are offered. As Brad and Janet arrive, Riff Raff, the hunchbacked handyman and live-in butler, greets them, and his sister Magenta, the maid, appears. Riff Raff, Magenta and Columbia (a groupie) speak briefly of an unlucky delivery boy named Eddie who fell victim to unfortunate circumstances because he botched a delivery, before performing the show's signature dance number (\"[[Time Warp (song)|Time Warp]]\"*). Brad and Janet try to leave at this point, but are stopped when Dr Frank-N-Furter, a [[Pansexuality|pansexual]], [[cross-dressing]] [[mad scientist]], arrives. He introduces himself as \"a sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania\" and invites Brad and Janet up to his laboratory (\"[[Sweet Transvestite]]\"). As he goes up, Brad and Janet are stripped to their underwear to dry off.\n\nBrad and Janet enter the laboratory, where Frank-N-Furter gives them [[White coat|laboratory coats]] to wear. Frank announces that he has discovered the secret to life itself. He unveils his creation, a blond, well-built man named Rocky, who is brought to life. As his bandages are removed, Rocky worries about his predicament (\"The Sword of Damocles\"). Frank admires Rocky's physique by singing a tribute to muscle builders (\"Charles Atlas Song\"/\"I Can Make You a Man\"**). A Coca-Cola freezer in the laboratory opens to reveal Frank and Columbia's former lover, Eddie, a biker covered in surgical scars, who has been rendered a (slightly more) brain-damaged zombie, intent on rescuing Columbia, and escaping the castle while successfully causing large amounts of damage to Frank's laboratory, exhibiting signs of partially returning memory of the way he lived life in the past (\"[[Hot Patootie (Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?)|Hot Patootie \u2013 Bless My Soul]]\"). Frank panics, forces Eddie back into the freezer and hacks him to death (his weapon of choice typically being a pick axe or chainsaw). Frank tells Rocky \u2014 the recipient of the other half of Eddie's brain \u2014 that he prefers him over Eddie (\"Charles Atlas Song (Reprise)\"/\"I Can Make You a Man (Reprise)\"**), as although he and Eddie had a strong mental relationship, he had no muscle, and therefore, had to go. Brad and Janet, somewhat flustered after witnessing the re-murdering of Eddie, are then ushered to separate bedrooms for the night.\n\n===Act II===\nThe Narrator foreshadows that Brad and Janet may be unsafe. Janet enjoys Brad's advances in her darkened bedroom before realizing that it is Frank in disguise. He convinces Janet that pleasure is no crime, and after she asks him to promise not to tell Brad, they resume their lovemaking. The scene changes to Brad's darkened bedroom, where Brad makes love to Janet before discovering that, once again, it is Frank in disguise. Frank promises not to tell Janet, but as they resume, Riff Raff interrupts on the television monitor with the message that Rocky has escaped. Janet searches for Brad in the laboratory and discovers Rocky hiding there. Checking the television monitor, Janet sees Brad in bed with Frank and seduces Rocky (\"[[Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me]]\"). While searching the television monitor for Rocky, the rest of the group discovers that Janet has slept with him and Brad becomes hurt and angry (\"Once in a While\"). Riff Raff then notifies Frank that there is another visitor entering the castle: Dr. Everett Scott, the [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] science tutor whom Brad and Janet intended to visit.\n\nDr Scott is pushed into the laboratory by Columbia, where Frank accuses him and Brad of trying to investigate his castle, knowing that Dr Scott has connections with the [[FBI]]. Dr Scott assures him that he has come in search of Eddie, who is revealed to be his nephew (\"Eddie's Teddy\"). Frank displays Eddie's corpse to the group and then uses a device to electronically restrain the three visitors and a rebellious Rocky to the floor (\"Planet Schmanet Janet\"); the inhabitants of the castle are revealed to be space aliens led by Frank, who abandoned their original mission in order to engage in kinky sex with Earthlings and work on Rocky. Magenta insists that they return to their home planet now that they have been found out; Frank refuses and, instead, declares his intentions to put on a \"floor show\".\n\nUnder Frank's influence, Columbia, Rocky, Brad, and Janet perform song and dance routines while clad in lingerie ([[Rose Tint My World|\"Rose Tint My World (Floor Show)\"]]). After, Frank entices them to lose all inhibition and give in to their natural carnal instincts, resulting in everyone beginning to engage in [[Orgy|orgiastic sex]] (\"Don't Dream It \u2013 Be It\") before Frank leads them into the rousing concluding number of the floor show (\"Wild and Untamed Thing\"). The show comes to an abrupt end when Riff Raff and Magenta enter, wearing spacesuits and carrying [[ray gun]]s. Riff Raff declares that he is usurping Frank's authority and taking them all back to their home planet (\"Transit Beam\"). Frank makes a final plea for sympathy from Riff Raff, trying to make him understand his desire to spend the rest of his life having sex with Earthlings (\"[[I'm Going Home (Rocky Horror song)|I'm Going Home]]\"). Riff Raff is unmoved and guns down Columbia, Frank, and Rocky before ordering Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott to leave.\n\nAs the trio evacuates the castle, Riff Raff and Magenta express their excitement to return to their world and do the \"Time Warp\" again with their fellow Transylvanians (\"Spaceship\"). Brad and Janet watch as the castle blasts off into outer space, confused about the implications of their sexual escapades (\"Super Heroes\"). To conclude his tale, the Narrator says \"and crawling on the planet's face, insects called the human race, lost in time, and lost in space \u2013 and meaning.\" As the show ends, The Usherette returns to recount the night's events (\"Science Fiction/Double Feature (Reprise)\").\n\n* In the original London and Los Angeles productions, \"Sweet Transvestite\" came before \"Time Warp\". This was changed for the [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|film version]] and was subsequently updated for the stage version when O'Brien revised the script for the 1990 [[West End theatre|West End]] revival.\n* \"Charles Atlas Song\" was replaced by a reworked version of the song, \"I Can Make You a Man\", for the film version. O'Brien's revision of the script in 1990 featured a hybrid of the two songs under the title \"I Can Make You a Man\", in the 1999 revised script this song was replaced by the film version, which continues to be used in all major productions. The reprise remains unchanged except for the title.\n\n==Other productions==\n\n===Original Los Angeles production (American premiere)===\n[[Lou Adler]] had made millions with risky ventures such as [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey Pop]].

Miller]] produced the original Sydney production of Rocky Horror, which opened on 19 April 1974 at the New Arts Cinema (formerly The Astor, later The Valhalla and now an office building) in [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]]. It starred [[Reg Livermore]] as Frank-N-Furter, Jane Harders as Janet Weiss, [[Kate Fitzpatrick]] as Usherette and Magenta, [[Arthur Dignam]] as Narrator, Sal Sharah as Riff-Raff, John Paramor as Brad Majors, Graham Matters as Rocky, Maureen Elkner as Columbia, David Cameron as Eddie and Dr. Scott with [[Bob Hudson (singer)|Bob Hudson]] and Piero Von Arnam and Julie McGregor.\n\n===Original Melbourne/Adelaide production===\nAfter eighteen-month run in Sydney, Harry M. Miller's production moved to Melbourne, with [[Max Phipps]] taking over the star role. It opened at the Regent Palace Theatre on 24 October 1975 and ran through 19 months and 458 performances, finally closing on 28 May 1977.<ref>''The Rocky Horror Show'', Regent Place Theatre, 1975.[https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/67975 www.ausstage.edu.au]</ref>\n\nThe Melbourne production included Max Phipps - Frank N Furter; [[Gregory Apps]] - Brad (later Stephen Clark); Paula Maxwell - Janet (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Diana Greentree); [[Tommy Dysart]] - narrator; Sal Sharah - Riff-Raff; Robyn Moase - Magenta (later Joan Brockenshire); Sue Smithers - Columbia (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Joan Millar); Graham Matters - Rocky (later Grant Whiteman, Clive Blackie); Terry Bader - Eddie/Dr Scott (later David Cameron, William Gluth).<ref name=\"auto\" />  When Paula Maxwell left, resident stage director, Roland Rocchiccioli, moved Kear (at her request) into the role of Janet, and Joan Miller, who was an understudy, took over from Kear as Columbia. \nIt was in Melbourne, during the Sword of Damocles number, that Grant Whiteman fell while swinging on ladder and being pursued by Max Phipps. Fortunately, there was a Doctor in the house. Without missing a beat, Rocchiccioli told Clive Blackie to get into the costume: \"This is your big chance. You're on!\" he said. The show picked-up from where Whiteman had fallen and went-on without further hitch. Soon after that Whiteman left, and, to Blackie's surprise, Rocchiccioli put him into the role - without hesitation. He said to him: \"You're the understudy. Of course you take over. That's what you're here for!\" He proved a very popular Rocky. What he lacked in height he made-up for in muscle. \nThe show then transferred to Adelaide, where it opened on 12 August 1977 at The Warner Theatre. Max Phipps, Diana Greentree, Joan Millar, Tommy Dysart and Joan Brockenshire went on to reprise their roles from the Melbourne production. Staged by Roland Rocchiccioli, the Adelaide production \u2013 which was a transfer of Jim Sharman's original Sydney and Melbourne productions, and adapted for the new theatre, was not a success, and closed after only two months. As Rocchiccioli said on ABC Television in Adelaide, talking with Clive Hale: \"It is the same Jim Sharman production as Melbourne. It is Brian Thomson's design, except the set has been altered slightly because this is not a television theatre in the last days of its existence!\" Rocchiccioli later said he was astonished that it did not work in Adelaide after playing in Melbourne for the two-years previous. Some weeks the company did ten performances, so great was the demand for tickets. It would have gone on running - possibly for another year - had Max Phipps not decided to leave. He was exhausted. In the final months Harry M Miller was selling standing-room at the back of the theatre for up to 50-patrons per performance.\n\nAfter several weeks in Adelaide, [[Jon Finlayson]] replaced Max Phipps as Frank-N-Furter. Max had come-in to the production at the last moment, after Darrell Hilton and Rocchiccioli agreed on a parting of the ways, just days before the opening night. Other cast members included Tony Preece as Brad; [[Keith Reid]] (who was the Melbourne understudy) as Riff-Raff; Bill Binks as Eddie/Dr. Scott; and [[Shane Bourne]] as Rocky. The Adelaide reviews were\nsavage, and killed the production. Everyone was taken by surprise, including Max Phipps, who was brilliant in the role. Rocchiccioli said at the time: \"It's baffling. Nothing has changed from Melbourne, and it's difficult to know why they hate it so much.\"  It is the only time the Rocky Horror Show has not been critically applauded in Australia.\n\n<ref name=\"auto\">''The Rocky Horror Picture Show FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Campy Cult Classic'' (2016) by Dave Thompson; Applause Theatre & Cinema Books</ref><ref>Adelaide Programme 1977.</ref>\n\n===Original New York City (Broadway) production===\n[[File:The Rocky Horror Show Broadway.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Original Broadway poster]]\nIn early 1975, Adler closed the show at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]] after a ten-month run.

Well, I'm a blue-eyed blonde soul lost in a body of a bumpkin for fifty years and nobody ever defended me. Don't I have human rights? Like I said: if the father hits them, they will know it's wrong and will have sex with their guy friend from school, they will not say they are trans people, they will try to find a man to them and will stop searching for the spotlight. The spotlight is for Judy [Garland], Barbra [Streisand] and Rog\u00e9ria [a very famous Brazilian trans actress], the rest is a bunch of junkie fagot from rave parties.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nFollowing the event, many Facebook users have expressed outrage at Botelho's claims.
