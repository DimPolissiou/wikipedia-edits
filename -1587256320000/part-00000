From 1960 to 1964, this category was combined with the Comedy Specials (one time programs) category so that both type of programs competed for the same award during those years.\n\n''[[The Flintstones]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'' are the only animated series to be nominated for the award. In [[2019 in television|2019]], ''[[Fleabag]]'' made history as the first series from outside the United States to win this award.\n\nOutside the [[Big Three television networks|Big Three networks (ABC, CBS and NBC)]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] has won this award twice, with ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' and ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', [[Cable television|cable network]] [[HBO]] has won this award four times, one with ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and three times with ''[[Veep]]'', [[streaming service]] [[Prime Video]] for ''[[The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel]]'', and the [[BBC]] for ''[[Fleabag]]'' (although seen later on Prime Video).\n\n==Winners and nominations==\nThe following tables, divided by decade, show the winners and nominees of the \"Comedy Series\" award, according to the Primetime Emmy Awards database:\n\n===1950s===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\" | Year\n! style=\"width:90%;\" | Program\n! style=\"width:5%;\" | Network\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center\"| [[1952 in television|1952]]<br /><small>[[4th Primetime Emmy Awards|(4th)]]</small> || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | [[NBC]]\n|-\n| ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]'' || [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[The Herb Shriner Show]]'' || [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|-\n| ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' || [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' || [[NBC]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center\"| [[1953 in television|1953]]<br /><small>[[5th Primetime Emmy Awards|(5th)]]</small> || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'' || [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|-\n| ''[[Amos 'n' Andy#Television|Amos 'n' Andy]]'' || rowspan=\"2\" | [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]''\n|-\n| ''[[Mister Peepers]]'' || [[NBC]]\n|-\n| ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]'' || [[CBS]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center\"| [[1954 in television|1954]]<br /><small>[[6th Primetime Emmy Awards|(6th)]]</small> || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]'' || [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[Mister Peepers]]'' || [[NBC]]\n|-\n| ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]'' || rowspan=\"2\" | [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[Topper (TV series)|Topper]]''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center\"| [[1955 in television|1955]]<br /><small>[[7th Primetime Emmy Awards|(7th)]]</small> || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | ''[[The Danny Thomas Show|Make Room for Daddy]]'' || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|-\n| ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]'' || rowspan=\"2\" | [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[I Love Lucy]]''\n|-\n| ''[[Mister Peepers]]'' || [[NBC]]\n|-\n| ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]'' || rowspan=\"2\" | [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[Private Secretary (TV series)|Private Secretary]]''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center\"| [[1956 in television|1956]]<br /><small>[[8th Primetime Emmy Awards|(8th)]]</small> || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]'' || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[The Bob Cummings Show]]'' || rowspan=\"3\" | [[NBC]]\n|-\n| ''[[Caesar's Hour]]''\n|-\n| ''The George Gobel Show''\n|-\n| ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' || [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[The Danny Thomas Show|Make Room for Daddy]]'' || [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|-\n| rowspan=13 style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1957 in television|1957]]<br /><small>[[9th Primetime Emmy Awards|(9th)]]</small><br/><ref group=note>In 1957, two separate series categories existed, Best Series \u2013 Half Hour or Less and Best Series \u2013 One Hour or More, and an award was given in each category.

In [[2019 in television|2019]], ''[[Fleabag]]'' made history as the first series from outside the United States to win this award.\n\nOutside the [[Big Three television networks|Big Three networks (ABC, CBS and NBC)]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] has won this award twice, with ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' and ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', [[Cable television|cable network]] [[HBO]] has won this award four times, one with ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and three times with ''[[Veep]]'', [[streaming service]] [[Prime Video]] for ''[[The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel]]'', and the [[BBC]] for ''[[Fleabag]]'' (although seen later on Prime Video).\n\n==Winners and nominations==\nThe following tables, divided by decade, show the winners and nominees of the \"Comedy Series\" award, according to the Primetime Emmy Awards database:\n\n===1950s===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\" | Year\n! style=\"width:90%;\" | Program\n! style=\"width:5%;\" | Network\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center\"| [[1952 in television|1952]]<br /><small>[[4th Primetime Emmy Awards|(4th)]]</small> || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | [[NBC]]\n|-\n| ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]'' || [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[The Herb Shriner Show]]'' || [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|-\n| ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' || [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' || [[NBC]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center\"| [[1953 in television|1953]]<br /><small>[[5th Primetime Emmy Awards|(5th)]]</small> || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'' || [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|-\n| ''[[Amos 'n' Andy#Television|Amos 'n' Andy]]'' || rowspan=\"2\" | [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]''\n|-\n| ''[[Mister Peepers]]'' || [[NBC]]\n|-\n| ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]'' || [[CBS]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center\"| [[1954 in television|1954]]<br /><small>[[6th Primetime Emmy Awards|(6th)]]</small> || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]'' || [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[Mister Peepers]]'' || [[NBC]]\n|-\n| ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]'' || rowspan=\"2\" | [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[Topper (TV series)|Topper]]''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center\"| [[1955 in television|1955]]<br /><small>[[7th Primetime Emmy Awards|(7th)]]</small> || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | ''[[The Danny Thomas Show|Make Room for Daddy]]'' || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|-\n| ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]'' || rowspan=\"2\" | [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[I Love Lucy]]''\n|-\n| ''[[Mister Peepers]]'' || [[NBC]]\n|-\n| ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]'' || rowspan=\"2\" | [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[Private Secretary (TV series)|Private Secretary]]''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center\"| [[1956 in television|1956]]<br /><small>[[8th Primetime Emmy Awards|(8th)]]</small> || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]'' || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[The Bob Cummings Show]]'' || rowspan=\"3\" | [[NBC]]\n|-\n| ''[[Caesar's Hour]]''\n|-\n| ''The George Gobel Show''\n|-\n| ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' || [[CBS]]\n|-\n| ''[[The Danny Thomas Show|Make Room for Daddy]]'' || [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|-\n| rowspan=13 style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1957 in television|1957]]<br /><small>[[9th Primetime Emmy Awards|(9th)]]</small><br/><ref group=note>In 1957, two separate series categories existed, Best Series \u2013 Half Hour or Less and Best Series \u2013 One Hour or More, and an award was given in each category.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] (1955) for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] (1955) for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

It was released [[TV movie|direct-to-TV]] in Australia on 7 August 2010. It premiered on [[Syfy]], on [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] in the UK and Ireland on 9 August. It was released on 25 August in the United States. The film is set on a fictional [[Replica Titanic|replica ''Titanic'']] that sets off exactly 100 years after the original ship's maiden voyage to perform the reverse route, but [[global warming]] and the forces of nature cause history to repeat itself on the same night, only on a more disastrous and deadly scale.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[Arctic]] waters near the [[Helheim Glacier]] in [[Greenland]], a person is surfing on waves created by falling chunks of ice that fall off the glacier and into the ocean caused by the effects of [[global warming]]. However, a very large chunk of ice falls into the water, creating an especially large wave. The surfer tries to escape from the wave, but it is far too fast for him, and in a matter of seconds, it catches up to him then drowns and kills him. [[United States Coast Guard]] Captain James Maine, is sent to investigate in Greenland. While he is there with Dr. Kim Patterson ([[Brooke Burns]]), a huge chunk of ice falls into the ocean.\n\nOn 10 April 2012, 100 years after the launch of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], a new, similar-looking luxury [[cruise ship|cruise liner]], the SS ''Titanic II'', is christened. She embarks on her maiden voyage using the same route the ''Titanic'' took 100 years before in reverse direction (from [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], US to [[Southampton]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]). The ship's captain Will Howard ([[D.C. Douglas]]) is in command. The ship's designer, Hayden Walsh ([[Shane Van Dyke]]) and the ship's nurses Amy Maine ([[Marie Westbrook]]) and Kelly Wade ([[Mechelle Glavan]]) are onboard. During the [[Transatlantic crossing|Atlantic crossing]], the crew are alerted of the tsunami by James Maine. Maine warns that any ice in the area will be moved with the tsunami. In a rush to get back to shore, one of the engines is damaged, right before the wave, and a large [[iceberg]], ram into the ship, injuring many passengers. The entire starboard side of the ship and the starboard lifeboat ramps are crushed. Hayden and Amy return below decks and find Kelly badly injured. The three escape and move towards the upper decks. Meanwhile back up north, a much larger tsunami is created by yet another glacier. During the evacuation, immense pressure is placed on the ship's turbines. The turbines eventually explode, killing many people, including ship Captain Howard. The explosion also causes an immense fire on the ''Titanic II'', which is sinking by its bow while also listing at a shallow angle to its starboard side. \n\nAmy gets a call from her father who warns her of the second wave, and to stay out of the lifeboats. (As they will be washed away by the wave.) Maine orders the three to move to the ship's onboard diving facility. Kelly is later killed when a very heavy door crushes her. Hayden and Amy make it to the diving facility when they hear somebody trapped. They try to help him, but he dies behind a jammed door. When Hayden and Amy go inside the diving facility, the second wave hits the ship, turning it upside down, and destroying the lifeboats.\n\nThe ship's diving facility only has one oxygen tank and scuba suit, which Hayden gives to Amy. Before sacrificing his life for her, Hayden kisses Amy and with his last words tells her to resuscitate him should he drown before they are rescued. Captain Maine arrives to rescue Amy and Hayden by swimming inside the ship as it sinks. His helicopter runs out of fuel and crashes as Patterson gets in a life raft. With the ship flooded, \"Titanic II\" finally sinks. After James rescues them, Amy attempts to resuscitate Hayden but it's too late. Amy, and an unknown number of injured passengers whom Hayden ordered his helicopter to take (earlier in the film) are the only known survivors of the disaster.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shane Van Dyke]] as Hayden Walsh, the ship's owner\n* Marie Westbrook as Amy Maine, one of the ship's nurses and Hayden's love interest\n* [[Bruce Davison]] as Captain James Maine, Amy's father and helicopter commander of the U.S. Coast Guard\n* Michelle Glavan as Kelly Wade, another of the ship's nurses and Amy's colleague and friend\n* [[D.

Originally based on [[Electric Avenue]] in [[Brixton]], the school moved to its current premises on Shelton Street in 1966, after a brief parenthesis in [[Charlotte Street]], and changed its name to London Film School in 1969. From 1974 to 2000, it was known as the '''London International Film School''' (LIFS), and reverted to the name London Film School in 2001. \n\nLFS offers various degrees at [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] level: an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Filmmaking, an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Screenwriting, and, in partnership with the [[University of Exeter]], an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in International Film Business and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Film by Practice. It also offers a range of short and part-time professional development courses under the LFS Workshops banner. \n\nLFS recruits students from all over the world and is specifically constituted as an international community; around 60% of its students are from outside the [[United Kingdom]]. LFS is one of the ScreenSkills \"Film Academy Centres of Excellence\".<ref name=\"lfs.org.uk\">[http://www.lfs.org.uk/ Official Website], London Film School. Retrieved June 2007.</ref>\n\nThe school's current Director is G\u00edsli Sn\u00e6r and its current chairman is [[Greg Dyke]].\n\n==History==\nThe origin of the LFS was a short film training course taught by Gilmore Roberts at the [[Heatherley School of Fine Art]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]. After a dispute with the art school, he decided to continue the course independently, so he set up the London School of Film Technique in October 1956. After struggling to find suitable premises, the first filmmaking course finally started in April 1957, based in rather modest locales above a grocer's shop in [[Electric Avenue]], [[Brixton]].\n\nThe school was the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. Inspired by the emergence of film schools in Eastern Europe after World War II, it was set up around the belief that the future of the British film industry required properly designed formal training, rather than the apprenticeship basis which was, at the time, the only access into the field. At first, the school offered a 6-months diploma course which students could take over the day or evening classes, with an optional 6-months extension. Under the leadership of a new principal, Robert Dunbar, the course was expanded to 33 weeks and later 2 years, forming the basic structure for a curriculum that is still largely in place today.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Educating Film-makers: Past, Present and Future|last=Petrie|first=Duncan J.|last2=Stoneman|first2=Rod|publisher=Intellect|year=2014|isbn=978-178320-185-3|location=Bristol|pages=123-140}}</ref> \n\nThis caused a drastic increase in the student numbers, which made the original premises unsuited. The school moved to the [[West End of London|West End]] in 1963, first into a building in [[Charlotte Street]] and later, in 1966, in its current premises on Shelton Street. In 1969 it changed name to London Film School, to avoid being regarded as an institution that only offered narrow technical training. Notable alumni from the 1960s include directors such as [[Mike Leigh]], [[Michael Mann]], [[Don Boyd]], and [[Les Blair]], cinematographers such as [[Tak Fujimoto]] and [[Roger Pratt (cinematographer)|Roger Pratt]], as well as producers like [[Iain Smith (producer)|Iain Smith]].\n\nIn the early 1970s, a decrease of student numbers caused by various factors, including the establishment of the [[National Film and Television School|National Film School]] and the global impact of the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], brought the school into a financial crisis and eventually into liquidation. Staff and students banded together to press for continuation of the school; thanks to their efforts in raising the necessary funds, the school reopened in 1975, at the same location, under a new name: the London International Film School. \n\nThe school was newly incorporated as a charity, nonprofit-making company limited by guarantee. All students automatically became members of the company upon enrolment, with the right to elect, together with the other members, a board of governors with the overall responsibility for the management of the school. Manny Wynn was appointed principal of the re-established LIFS until his sudden death six months later, when he was succeeded by John Fletcher.\n\nNotable filmmakers from all over the world studied at the LIFS in the 1970s and 1980s, including Mexican director [[Luis Mandoki]], Hong Kong director [[Ann Hui]], Swiss cinematographer [[Ueli Steiger]] and Argentinian director [[Miguel Pereira (film director)|Miguel Pereira]]. After John Fletcher's death, Martin Amstel was appointed principal in 1986. Ten years later, in 1996, the 40th anniversary of the school was celebrated with events and screening of graduates\u2019 work in London, Los Angeles and Mexico City.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lfs.org.uk/50th/index.php?sec=1990|title=London Film School 50th|website=www.lfs.org.uk|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref> \n\nAfter the appointment of Ben Gibson as principal in 2000, the school returned to be known as London Film School.\u00a0Under Ben Gibson, LFS transitioned from offering a diploma course to offering [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] [[Master of Arts|MA]] programmes, first validated by the [[London Metropolitan University]] and later by [[University of Warwick]]. Nevertheless, the curriculum of the filmmaking course remained very similar and maintained its focus on practical filmmaking. Adjustments where brought in place to reflect the technological developments in the film industry and the transition to [[Digital cinematography|digital]]. The school also started diversifying its courses: next to its traditional course in [[filmmaking]], it started offering an MA course in [[screenwriting]] in 2005 and, from 2014, an MA in International Film Business in partnership with the [[University of Exeter]]. \n\nBen Gibson was succeeded as the director of the school by Jane Roscoe, who briefly held the post from 2014 to 2017. G\u00edsli Sn\u00e6r, former head of the Puttnam School of Film at the [[LASALLE College of the Arts]] in [[Singapore]] and Head of Studies at LFS since 2016, was appointed as the new director in 2018.\n\nIn recent years, films made at the school have regularly featured and won awards in some of the world's top film festivals, including [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]], [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]], [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]], the [[BFI London Film Festival]], Encounters and [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]]. Recent alumni include [[Duncan Jones]], [[Benjamin Cleary]], and [[Anu Menon]].\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe main London Film School building in Shelton Street was previously a brewery and a banana warehouse. Additional facilities are present in an annex building in [[Long Acre]].\n\nFacilities at LFS include two studios (Stage B and Stage D) equipped with lighting grids, as well as a rehearsal studio used also for workshops. LFS occasionally hires external studios facilities as well. \n\nThe school has a fully equipped [[Production designer|design]] studio with drawing boards, model making facilities, visual reference library, materials library and design computer suite. It has [[editing]] suites equipped with [[Media Composer|Avid Media Composer]] as well as sound suites equipped with [[Pro Tools|Pro Tools 24HD]], a commentary and foley recording area and a sound effects library.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lfs.org.uk/full-time-study/facilities|title=Facilities {{!}} London Film School|website=lfs.org.uk|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref> \n\nLFS also has two [[Movie theater|cinemas]] (Cinema A & B), with 110 and 35 seat capacity respectively and projection facilities for both [[Digital Cinema Package|digital]] and [[35mm movie film|35mm]]. \n\nLondon Film School is planning to relocate to new facilities in London City Island, [[Canning Town]], by autumn 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lfs.org.uk/full-time-study/admissions|title=Admissions {{!}} London Film School|website=lfs.org.uk|access-date=6 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Courses of studies==\n\nThe London Film School is built around a conservatoire model, providing an environment for intense creative work. Filmmaking is taught on stages and in workshops rather than in classrooms, and the courses are structured around practical work; students spend most of their time making films of increasing levels of difficulty. The school has a full-time faculty and a varied group of regular visiting lecturers, forming a living creative community with continuous connections to the film industry. \n\nThe '''MA Filmmaking''' programme has no pre-specialisation. All students are provided with a full education in all the craft areas of [[filmmaking]]: directing, producing, editing, cinematography, sound, production design, and writing. Students work on a minimum of ten films over 2 years, in different roles, and have the chance to crew on films from terms above and below them. Exercises include films shot in [[16 mm film|16mm]] on location with no sound or only post-recorded sound and films shot on [[35mm movie film|35mm]] or [[Digital cinematography|digital]] in studio, on purposely designed and built sets. One term is dedicated to making a [[Documentary film|documentary]]. For their graduation films, students do not have limitations and are allowed to shoot on any format and at any length they can budget and schedule. Often, students go back to their home country to make a graduation film, which means that LFS films have been made all over the world. All film exercises are provided with a production allowance included in the fees. With around 200 full-time students at any one time on the programme, it generates over 180 films a year. \n\nThe one-year '''MA Screenwriting''' programme is centred on the development of a full-length feature script, with individual monitoring and guidance from industry mentors. Workshops on storytelling and film language, characterisation, scene writing, and more are based around practical writing exercises. Screenwriting students have the chance to collaborate with students on the filmmaking programme and experience the production side of filmmaking first hand. \n\nThe '''MA International Film Business''' programme, run in conjunction with the [[University of Exeter]], prepares students for careers in programming, exhibition and distribution. Over the one-year course, students participate in modules in international finance, world cinema and a trip to the [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin Film Festival]]. \n\nNext to the full-time MA courses, the London Film School offers a variety of short term workshops and professional development courses, as well as a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] programme in Film by Practice in partnership with the [[University of Exeter]]. \n\n==Governance and Staff==\n{{col-begin|width=95%}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n===Director===\n*G\u00edsli Sn\u00e6r Erlingsson\n\n===Governing Body===\n*Chair: [[Greg Dyke]]\n*Vice-chair: Professor [[Diana Green]] [[CBE]]\n*Governors:\n**Peter Armstrong\n**Helen Dudley [[CBE]]\n**Kemal Akhtar\n**Olivier Kaempfer\n**Nick Humby\n**Peter Holliday\n**Moshe Nitzani, LFS Staff Governor\n**Peter Hogenson, LFS Student Governor\n\n{{col-2-of-2}}\n===Key Tutors===\n*Femi Kolade \u2013 Head of Studies \n*Jonathan Hourigan \u2013 Co-Head of Screenwriting\n*Sophia Wellington \u2013 Co-Head of Screenwriting\n*Timo Hein\u00e4nen FSC \u2013 Head of Camera\n*Candida Moriarty \u2013 Head of Production Design\n*Wojciech Wrzesniewski \u2013 Head of Sound\n*Peter Hollywood \u2013 Head of Editing\n*Rafael Kapelinski \u2013 Term 1 Tutor\n*Dominic Fitzgerald - Term 2 Tutor\n*Nicola Gibson \u2013 Term 3 Tutor\n*Rosie Toner - Term 4 Tutor\n*Giles Borg - Term 5 Tutor\n*Sue Austen \u2013 Term 6 Tutor\n*[[Richard Kwietniowski]] \u2013 Term 6 Tutor\n*[[Les Blair]] \u2013 Emeritus Professor\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Notable LFS alumni==\n{{Category seealso|Alumni of the London Film School}}\nThe school's alumni include:\n{{col-begin|width=95%}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n*[[Gavin MacFadyen]]\n*[[John Irvin]] \n*[[Ian Wilson (cinematographer)|Ian Wilson]] [[British Society of Cinematographers|BSC]]\n*[[Ross Devenish]]\n*[[Bill Douglas]]\n*[[Tak Fujimoto]] [[American Society of Cinematographers|ASC]]\n*[[Boaz Davidson]]\n*[[Mark Forstater]]\n*[[Harley Cokeliss]]\n*[[Mohamed Khan]]\n*[[Mike Leigh]]\n*[[Les Blair]]\n*[[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]]\n*[[Franc Roddam]]\n*[[Eduardo Guedes]]\n*[[George P.

The school also started diversifying its courses: next to its traditional course in [[filmmaking]], it started offering an MA course in [[screenwriting]] in 2005 and, from 2014, an MA in International Film Business in partnership with the [[University of Exeter]]. \n\nBen Gibson was succeeded as the director of the school by Jane Roscoe, who briefly held the post from 2014 to 2017. G\u00edsli Sn\u00e6r, former head of the Puttnam School of Film at the [[LASALLE College of the Arts]] in [[Singapore]] and Head of Studies at LFS since 2016, was appointed as the new director in 2018.\n\nIn recent years, films made at the school have regularly featured and won awards in some of the world's top film festivals, including [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]], [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]], [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]], the [[BFI London Film Festival]], Encounters and [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]]. Recent alumni include [[Duncan Jones]], [[Benjamin Cleary]], and [[Anu Menon]].\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe main London Film School building in Shelton Street was previously a brewery and a banana warehouse. Additional facilities are present in an annex building in [[Long Acre]].\n\nFacilities at LFS include two studios (Stage B and Stage D) equipped with lighting grids, as well as a rehearsal studio used also for workshops. LFS occasionally hires external studios facilities as well. \n\nThe school has a fully equipped [[Production designer|design]] studio with drawing boards, model making facilities, visual reference library, materials library and design computer suite. It has [[editing]] suites equipped with [[Media Composer|Avid Media Composer]] as well as sound suites equipped with [[Pro Tools|Pro Tools 24HD]], a commentary and foley recording area and a sound effects library.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lfs.org.uk/full-time-study/facilities|title=Facilities {{!}} London Film School|website=lfs.org.uk|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref> \n\nLFS also has two [[Movie theater|cinemas]] (Cinema A & B), with 110 and 35 seat capacity respectively and projection facilities for both [[Digital Cinema Package|digital]] and [[35mm movie film|35mm]]. \n\nLondon Film School is planning to relocate to new facilities in London City Island, [[Canning Town]], by autumn 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lfs.org.uk/full-time-study/admissions|title=Admissions {{!}} London Film School|website=lfs.org.uk|access-date=6 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Courses of studies==\n\nThe London Film School is built around a conservatoire model, providing an environment for intense creative work. Filmmaking is taught on stages and in workshops rather than in classrooms, and the courses are structured around practical work; students spend most of their time making films of increasing levels of difficulty. The school has a full-time faculty and a varied group of regular visiting lecturers, forming a living creative community with continuous connections to the film industry. \n\nThe '''MA Filmmaking''' programme has no pre-specialisation. All students are provided with a full education in all the craft areas of [[filmmaking]]: directing, producing, editing, cinematography, sound, production design, and writing. Students work on a minimum of ten films over 2 years, in different roles, and have the chance to crew on films from terms above and below them. Exercises include films shot in [[16 mm film|16mm]] on location with no sound or only post-recorded sound and films shot on [[35mm movie film|35mm]] or [[Digital cinematography|digital]] in studio, on purposely designed and built sets. One term is dedicated to making a [[Documentary film|documentary]]. For their graduation films, students do not have limitations and are allowed to shoot on any format and at any length they can budget and schedule. Often, students go back to their home country to make a graduation film, which means that LFS films have been made all over the world. All film exercises are provided with a production allowance included in the fees. With around 200 full-time students at any one time on the programme, it generates over 180 films a year. \n\nThe one-year '''MA Screenwriting''' programme is centred on the development of a full-length feature script, with individual monitoring and guidance from industry mentors. Workshops on storytelling and film language, characterisation, scene writing, and more are based around practical writing exercises. Screenwriting students have the chance to collaborate with students on the filmmaking programme and experience the production side of filmmaking first hand. \n\nThe '''MA International Film Business''' programme, run in conjunction with the [[University of Exeter]], prepares students for careers in programming, exhibition and distribution. Over the one-year course, students participate in modules in international finance, world cinema and a trip to the [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin Film Festival]]. \n\nNext to the full-time MA courses, the London Film School offers a variety of short term workshops and professional development courses, as well as a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] programme in Film by Practice in partnership with the [[University of Exeter]]. \n\n==Governance and Staff==\n{{col-begin|width=95%}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n===Director===\n*G\u00edsli Sn\u00e6r Erlingsson\n\n===Governing Body===\n*Chair: [[Greg Dyke]]\n*Vice-chair: Professor [[Diana Green]] [[CBE]]\n*Governors:\n**Peter Armstrong\n**Helen Dudley [[CBE]]\n**Kemal Akhtar\n**Olivier Kaempfer\n**Nick Humby\n**Peter Holliday\n**Moshe Nitzani, LFS Staff Governor\n**Peter Hogenson, LFS Student Governor\n\n{{col-2-of-2}}\n===Key Tutors===\n*Femi Kolade \u2013 Head of Studies \n*Jonathan Hourigan \u2013 Co-Head of Screenwriting\n*Sophia Wellington \u2013 Co-Head of Screenwriting\n*Timo Hein\u00e4nen FSC \u2013 Head of Camera\n*Candida Moriarty \u2013 Head of Production Design\n*Wojciech Wrzesniewski \u2013 Head of Sound\n*Peter Hollywood \u2013 Head of Editing\n*Rafael Kapelinski \u2013 Term 1 Tutor\n*Dominic Fitzgerald - Term 2 Tutor\n*Nicola Gibson \u2013 Term 3 Tutor\n*Rosie Toner - Term 4 Tutor\n*Giles Borg - Term 5 Tutor\n*Sue Austen \u2013 Term 6 Tutor\n*[[Richard Kwietniowski]] \u2013 Term 6 Tutor\n*[[Les Blair]] \u2013 Emeritus Professor\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Notable LFS alumni==\n{{Category seealso|Alumni of the London Film School}}\nThe school's alumni include:\n{{col-begin|width=95%}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n*[[Gavin MacFadyen]]\n*[[John Irvin]] \n*[[Ian Wilson (cinematographer)|Ian Wilson]] [[British Society of Cinematographers|BSC]]\n*[[Ross Devenish]]\n*[[Bill Douglas]]\n*[[Tak Fujimoto]] [[American Society of Cinematographers|ASC]]\n*[[Boaz Davidson]]\n*[[Mark Forstater]]\n*[[Harley Cokeliss]]\n*[[Mohamed Khan]]\n*[[Mike Leigh]]\n*[[Les Blair]]\n*[[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]]\n*[[Franc Roddam]]\n*[[Eduardo Guedes]]\n*[[George P.

The \"most serious of all Tudor rebellions\", it was a protest against [[Henry VIII]]'s break with the Catholic Church, the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], and the policies of the King's chief minister, [[Thomas Cromwell]], as well as other specific political, social and economic grievances.{{sfn|Cross|2013}}\n\nFollowing the suppression of the short-lived Lincolnshire Rising of 1536, the traditional historical view portrays the Pilgrimage as \"a spontaneous mass protest of the conservative elements in the North of England angry with the religious upheavals instigated by King Henry VIII\".

Only then was the term 'Pilgrimage of Grace' used. Historians have identified several key themes of the revolt:\n\n===Economic===\nThe northern gentry had concerns over the new [[Statute of Uses]]. The poor harvest of 1535 had also led to high food prices, which likely contributed to discontent. The dissolution of the monasteries also affected the local poor, many of whom relied on them for food and shelter.\n\n===Political===\nMany people in England disliked the way in which Henry VIII had cast off his wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://englishhistory.net/tudor/the-divorce-of-catherine-of-aragon-book-chapter-one/|title=The Divorce of Catherine of Aragon Book Chapter One|date=2015-03-06|website=English History|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> Although her successor, [[Anne Boleyn]], had been unpopular as Catherine's replacement as a rumoured Protestant, her execution in 1536 on trumped-up charges of [[adultery]] and [[treason]] had done much to undermine the monarchy's prestige and the King's personal reputation. Aristocrats objected to the rise of [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]], who was \"base born\".\n\n===Religious===\nThe local church was, for many in the north, the centre of community life. Many ordinary peasants were worried that their church plate would be confiscated. There were also popular rumours at the time which hinted that baptisms might be taxed. The recently released [[Ten Articles]] and the new order of prayer issued by the government in 1535 had also made official doctrine more Protestant, which went against the Catholic beliefs of most northerners.\n\n==Events==\n[[Robert Aske (political leader)|Robert Aske]] was chosen to lead the insurgents; he was a  [[barrister]] from [[London]], a resident of the [[Inns of Court]], and the youngest son of Sir Robert Aske of [[Aughton, East Riding of Yorkshire|Aughton]], near [[Selby]]. His family was from [[Aske Hall]], [[Richmondshire]], and had long been in Yorkshire. In 1536, Aske led a band of 9,000 followers, who entered and occupied [[York]]. He arranged for expelled monks and nuns to return to their houses; the King's newly installed tenants were driven out, and Catholic observances were resumed.\n\nThe rising was so successful that the royalist leaders, [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]], and [[George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury]], opened negotiations with the insurgents at Scawsby Leys, near [[Doncaster]], where Aske had assembled between thirty and forty thousand people.<ref name=Burton>{{Catholic|prescript=|wstitle=Pilgrimage of Grace|last=Burton|first=Edwin|volume=12 }}</ref>\n\nNorfolk promised a general pardon and a Parliament to be held at York within a year, as well as a reprieve for the abbeys until the parliament had met. Naively trusting the king's promises, Aske dismissed his followers.<ref name=Burton/>\n\nJesse Childs (a biographer of the Earl of Surrey, Norfolk's son) specifically notes that Henry VIII did not authorize Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, to grant remedies for the grievances. Norfolk's enemies had whispered into the King's ear that the Howards could put down a rebellion of peasants if they wanted to, suggesting that Norfolk sympathized with the Pilgrimage. Norfolk, seeing their vast numbers (he and the Earl of Shrewsbury were outnumbered: they had 5000 and 7000 respectively but there were 40,000 pilgrims) negotiated and made promises to avoid being massacred.\n\n==Suppression==\nIn February 1537 there was a new rising (not authorised by Aske) in [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]], called [[Bigod's Rebellion]], under [[Francis Bigod|Sir Francis Bigod]], of [[Settrington]] in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]]. Because he knew the promises he made on behalf of the King would not be met, Norfolk reacted quickly to the new uprising after the Pilgrims did not disperse as they had promised.\n\nThe rebellion failed and King Henry arrested Bigod, Aske and several other rebels, such as [[Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Darcy|Darcy]], [[John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford]], the [[Chief Butler of England]]; [[Thomas Percy, knight|Sir Thomas Percy]] and Sir Robert Constable. All were convicted of [[treason]] and executed. During 1537 Bigod was hanged at Tyburn; Lords Darcy and Hussey both beheaded; [[Thomas Moigne]], [[Parliament of England|M.P.]] for [[Lincoln (UK Parliament constituency)|Lincoln]] was hanged, drawn and quartered; [[Robert Constable|Sir Robert Constable]] hanged in chains at Hull; and [[Robert Aske (political leader)|Robert Aske]] hanged in chains at York. In total 216 were executed: several lords and knights (including [[Thomas Percy (Pilgrimage of Grace)|Sir Thomas Percy]], Sir Stephen Hamerton, Sir William Lumley, Sir John Constable and Sir William Constable), 6 abbots ([[Adam Sedbar, Abbot of Jervaulx]], William Trafford, Abbot of Sawley, Matthew Mackarel, Abbot of Barlings and Bishop of Chalcedon, William Thirsk, Abbot of Fountains and the Prior of Bridlington), 38 monks, and 16 parish priests. Sir Nicholas Tempest, Bowbearer of the Forest of Bowland, was hanged at Tyburn, Sir John Bulmer hanged, drawn and quartered and his wife Margaret Stafford burnt at the stake.\n\nIn late 1538, Sir [[Edward Neville]], Keeper of the Sewer, was beheaded.

The Bishop's Book was followed by the [[Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]] of 1539.\n* An onslaught upon [[heresy]] was promised in a royal proclamation in 1538.\n\n==Leadership==\nHistorians have noted the leaders among the nobility and gentry in the Lincolnshire Rising and the Pilgrimage of Grace and tend to argue that the Risings gained legitimacy only through the involvement of the northern nobility and gentlemen, such as [[Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Darcy|Lord Darcy]], [[Lord Hussey]] and Robert Aske.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fletcher|first1=Anthony|last2=MacCulloch|first2=Diarmaid|title=Tudor Rebellions|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317437376}}</ref> However, historians such as M. E. James, C. S. L. Davies and [[Andy Wood (historian)|Andy Wood]], among others, believe the question of leadership was more complex.\n\nJames and Davies look at the Risings of 1536 as the product of common grievances. The lower classes were aggrieved because of the closure of local monasteries by the Act of Suppression. The northern nobility felt their rights were being taken away from them in the Acts of 1535\u20131536, which made them lose confidence in the royal government. James analysed how the lower classes and the nobility used each other as a legitimizing force in an extremely ordered society.\n\nThe nobles hid behind the force of the lower classes with claims of coercion, since they were seen as blameless for their actions because they did not possess political choice. This allowed the nobles an arena to air their grievances while, at the same time, playing the victims of popular violence. The lower classes used the nobility to give their grievance a sense of obedience since the \"leaders\" of the rebellion were of a higher social class.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=James|first1=M.

Common grievances over evil advisors and religion brought the higher and lower classes together in their fight. Once the nobles had to confront the King's forces and an all-out war, they decided to surrender, thereby ending the cohesion.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Davies|first1=C. S.

He argues that this force came from a class group largely left out of history: minor gentlemen and well-off farmers. He believes these groups were the leaders of the Risings because they had more political agency and thought.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Andy|title=Riot, rebellion and popular politics in early modern England|date=2002|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|isbn=9780333637623|pages=19\u201354}}</ref>\n\n==List of executions==\n\n===After the Lincolnshire Rising===\n* Richard Harrison, Abbot of [[Kirkstead Abbey]]\n* Thomas Kendal, priest and vicar of Louth\n* Matthew Mackerel, [[Premonstratensian]] abbot of [[Barlings Abbey]], titular bishop of Chalcedon;\n* [[Thomas Moigne]] (Moyne), gentleman\n* William Moreland (aka Borowby), priest of [[Louth Park Abbey]]\n* James Mallet, priest and chaplain to the late Queen Catherine\n\n===After the Pilgrimage===\nThe sub-[[prior]] of the Augustinian [[Cartmel Priory]] and several of the canons were hanged, along with ten villagers who had supported them.<ref name=BHOL>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=38352 |title=British History Online: The Priory of Cartmel |accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref> The monks of the Augustinian [[Hexham Abbey|Hexham priory]], who became involved in the Pilgrimage of Grace, were executed.\n\n*1537: George ab Alba Rose, Augustinian;\n*[[George Ashby (martyr)|George Ashby]] (Asleby), monk;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01776a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: George Ashby |website=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2016-11-05}}</ref>\n*Ralph Barnes, monk;\n*Laurence Blonham, monk;\n*James Cockerell, Prior of [[Gisborough Priory]];\n*William Coe, monk;\n*William Cowper, monk;\n*John Eastgate, monk;\n*Richard Eastgate, monk of Whalley Abbey; hanged 12 March 1537\n*John Francis, monk;\n*William Gylham, monk;\n*William Haydock, monk of Whalley Abbey; hanged 13 March 1537\n*Nicholas Heath, Prior of Lenton;\n*John Henmarsh, priest;\n*Robert Hobbes, Abbot of Woburn;\n*Henry Jenkinson, monk;\n*Richard Laynton, monk;\n*Robert Leeche, layman;\n*Hugh Londale, monk;\n*John Paslew, Abbot of [[Whalley Abbey]]; hanged at Whalley \n*25 May 1537: John Pickering, priest;<ref name=blood/>\n*Thomas Redforth, priest;\n*26 May 1537: [[Adam Sedbar, Abbot of Jervaulx]];\n*William Swale, monk;\n*John Tenant, monk;\n*Richard Wade, monk\n\n===Executed after Bigod's rebellion (1537)===\n*[[Robert Aske (political leader)|Robert Aske]], layman;{{sfn|Dodds, p. 225}}\n*[[Robert Constable]], layman;\n*[[Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Darcy|The Lord Darcy de Darcy]];{{sfn|Dodds, p. 194}}\n*[[Thomas Percy (Pilgrimage of Grace)|Sir Thomas Percy]];\n*John Pickering (friar);\n*William Trafford, Abbot of Sawley; hanged at Lancaster 10 March 1537\n*William Thyrsk (Thirsk), Cistercian former abbot of [[Fountains Abbey]]<ref name=blood>{{cite web|url=http://academic.regis.edu/bgeger/PDF%20files/London%20Martyrs%20List.pdf |title=London Martyrs List.PDF |website=Academic.regis.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-11-05}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[John Longland]], [[Bishop of Lincoln]] during the period\n*[[Prayer Book Rebellion]]\n*[[Rising of the North]]\n*[[Thomas Trahern]], [[Somerset Herald]], murdered in 1542 by William Leech of Fulletby, fugitive ringleader of the Lincolnshire rising\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite ODNB |last=Cross |first=Claire |year=2009 |title=Participants in the Pilgrimage of Grace (act. 1536\u20131537) |publisher=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-95587?rskey=UG8A5G&result=1 |accessdate=17 November 2018 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Dodds |first=Madeleine Hope |year=1971 |title=The Pilgrimage of Grace 1536\u20131537 and the Exeter Conspiracy 1538 |last2=Dodds |first2=Ruth |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=vDU9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA214 |ref=harv}}Still the major comprehensive history.\n*{{Cite book |last=Hamilton |first=William Douglas, ed. |year=1875 |title=A Chronicle of England During the Reigns of the Tudors from A.D. 1485 to 1559 by Charles Wriothesley, Windsor Herald |location=London |publisher=J.B.

The \"most serious of all Tudor rebellions\", it was a protest against [[Henry VIII]]'s break with the Catholic Church, the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], and the policies of the King's chief minister, [[Thomas Cromwell]], as well as other specific political, social and economic grievances.{{sfn|Cross|2013}}\n\nFollowing the suppression of the short-lived Lincolnshire Rising of 1536, the traditional historical view portrays the Pilgrimage as \"a spontaneous mass protest of the conservative elements in the North of England angry with the religious upheavals instigated by King Henry VIII\".

Only then was the term 'Pilgrimage of Grace' used. Historians have identified several key themes of the revolt:\n\n===Economic===\nThe northern gentry had concerns over the new [[Statute of Uses]]. The poor harvest of 1535 had also led to high food prices, which likely contributed to discontent. The dissolution of the monasteries also affected the local poor, many of whom relied on them for food and shelter.\n\n===Political===\nMany people in England disliked the way in which Henry VIII had cast off his wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://englishhistory.net/tudor/the-divorce-of-catherine-of-aragon-book-chapter-one/|title=The Divorce of Catherine of Aragon Book Chapter One|date=2015-03-06|website=English History|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> Although her successor, [[Anne Boleyn]], had been unpopular as Catherine's replacement as a rumoured Protestant, her execution in 1536 on trumped-up charges of [[adultery]] and [[treason]] had done much to undermine the monarchy's prestige and the King's personal reputation. Aristocrats objected to the rise of [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]], who was 'base born'.\n\n===Religious===\nThe local church was, for many in the north, the centre of community life. Many ordinary peasants were worried that their church plate would be confiscated. There were also popular rumours at the time which hinted that baptisms might be taxed. The recently released [[Ten Articles]] and the new order of prayer issued by the government in 1535 had also made official doctrine more Protestant, which went against the Catholic beliefs of most northerners.\n\n==Events==\n[[Robert Aske (political leader)|Robert Aske]] was chosen to lead the insurgents; he was a  [[barrister]] from [[London]], a resident of the [[Inns of Court]], and the youngest son of Sir Robert Aske of [[Aughton, East Riding of Yorkshire|Aughton]], near [[Selby]]. His family was from [[Aske Hall]], [[Richmondshire]], and had long been in Yorkshire. In 1536, Aske led a band of 9,000 followers, who entered and occupied [[York]]. He arranged for expelled monks and nuns to return to their houses; the King's newly installed tenants were driven out, and Catholic observances were resumed.\n\nThe rising was so successful that the royalist leaders, [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]], and [[George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury]], opened negotiations with the insurgents at Scawsby Leys, near [[Doncaster]], where Aske had assembled between thirty and forty thousand people.<ref name=Burton>{{Catholic|prescript=|wstitle=Pilgrimage of Grace|last=Burton|first=Edwin|volume=12 }}</ref>\n\nNorfolk promised a general pardon and a Parliament to be held at York within a year, as well as a reprieve for the abbeys until the parliament had met. Naively trusting the king's promises, Aske dismissed his followers.<ref name=Burton/>\n\nJesse Childs (a biographer of the Earl of Surrey, Norfolk's son) specifically notes that Henry VIII did not authorize Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, to grant remedies for the grievances. Norfolk's enemies had whispered into the King's ear that the Howards could put down a rebellion of peasants if they wanted to, suggesting that Norfolk sympathized with the Pilgrimage. Norfolk, seeing their vast numbers (he and the Earl of Shrewsbury were outnumbered: they had 5000 and 7000 respectively but there were 40,000 pilgrims) negotiated and made promises to avoid being massacred.\n\n==Suppression==\nIn February 1537 there was a new rising (not authorised by Aske) in [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]], called [[Bigod's Rebellion]], under [[Francis Bigod|Sir Francis Bigod]], of [[Settrington]] in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]]. Because he knew the promises he made on behalf of the King would not be met, Norfolk reacted quickly to the new uprising after the Pilgrims did not disperse as they had promised.\n\nThe rebellion failed and King Henry arrested Bigod, Aske and several other rebels, such as [[Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Darcy|Darcy]], [[John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford]], the [[Chief Butler of England]]; [[Thomas Percy, knight|Sir Thomas Percy]] and Sir Robert Constable. All were convicted of [[treason]] and executed. During 1537 Bigod was hanged at Tyburn; Lords Darcy and Hussey both beheaded; [[Thomas Moigne]], [[Parliament of England|M.P.]] for [[Lincoln (UK Parliament constituency)|Lincoln]] was hanged, drawn and quartered; [[Robert Constable|Sir Robert Constable]] hanged in chains at Hull; and [[Robert Aske (political leader)|Robert Aske]] hanged in chains at York. In total 216 were executed: several lords and knights (including [[Thomas Percy (Pilgrimage of Grace)|Sir Thomas Percy]], Sir Stephen Hamerton, Sir William Lumley, Sir John Constable and Sir William Constable), 6 abbots ([[Adam Sedbar, Abbot of Jervaulx]], William Trafford, Abbot of Sawley, Matthew Mackarel, Abbot of Barlings and Bishop of Chalcedon, William Thirsk, Abbot of Fountains and the Prior of Bridlington), 38 monks, and 16 parish priests. Sir Nicholas Tempest, Bowbearer of the Forest of Bowland, was hanged at Tyburn, Sir John Bulmer hanged, drawn and quartered and his wife Margaret Stafford burnt at the stake.\n\nIn late 1538, Sir [[Edward Neville]], Keeper of the Sewer, was beheaded. The loss of the leaders enabled the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] to quell the rising,<ref name=Burton/> and martial law was imposed upon the demonstrating regions. Norfolk executed some 216 activists (such as Lord Darcy, who tried to implicate Norfolk as a sympathizer): churchmen, monks, commoners.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Childs|first1=Jessie|title=Henry VIII's last victim : the life and times of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey|date=2008|publisher=Vintage|location=London|isbn=9780712643474|page=115}}</ref>\n\nThe details of the trial and execution of major leaders were recorded by the author of ''[[Wriothesley's Chronicle]]:''{{r|Wrioth|page1=63-4}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dodds |first=Madeleine Hope |year=1915 |title=The Pilgrimage of Grace 1536\u20131537 and the Exeter Conspiracy 1538 |last2=Dodds |first2=Ruth |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=vDU9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA214|page=214}}</ref>{{sfn|Cross|2013}}\n\n<blockquote>Also the 16 day of May [1537] there were arraigned at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] afore the King\u2019s Commissioners, the [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Lord Chancellor]] that day being the chief, these persons following: [[Robert Constable|Sir Robert Constable]], knight; [[Thomas Percy (Pilgrimage of Grace)|Sir Thomas Percy]], knight, and brother to the [[Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]]; Sir John Bulmer, knight, and Ralph Bulmer, his son and heir; [[Francis Bigod|Sir Francis Bigod]], knight; Margaret Cheney, after Lady Bulmer by untrue matrimony; George Lumley, esquire;<ref>Father of [[John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley]].</ref> [[Robert Aske (political leader)|Robert Aske]], gentleman, that was captain in the insurrection of the Northern men; and one Hamerton, esquire, all which persons were indicted of [[high treason]] against the King, and that day condemned by a jury of knights and esquires for the same, whereupon they had sentence to be [[hanged, drawn and quartered|drawn, hanged and quartered]], but Ralph Bulmer, the son of John Bulmer, was reprieved and had no sentence.\n\nAnd on the 25 day of May, being the Friday in [[Whitsun]] week, Sir John Bulmer, Sir Stephen Hamerton, knights, were hanged and headed; Nicholas Tempest, esquire; Doctor Cockerell, priest;<ref>James Cockerell, Prior of [[Gisborough Priory|Guisborough]].</ref> Abbot quondam of [[Fountains Abbey|Fountains]];<ref>William Thirsk.</ref> and Doctor Pickering, friar,<ref>John Pickering of [[Bridlington]].</ref> were drawn from the [[Tower of London]] to [[Tyburn]], and there hanged, [[disembowelment|bowelled]] and quartered, and their [[head on a spike|heads set on]] [[London Bridge]] and divers gates in London.\n\nAnd the same day Margaret Cheney, 'other wife to Bulmer called', was drawn after them from the Tower of London into [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]], and there [[death by burning|burned]] according to her judgment, God pardon her soul, being the Friday in Whitsun week; she was a very fair creature, and a beautiful.</blockquote>\n\n==Outcome==\n\n===Failures===\nThe Lincolnshire Rising and the Pilgrimage of Grace have historically been seen as failures for the following reasons:\n\n* England was not reconciled to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], except during the brief reign of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] (1553\u20131558).\n* The dissolution of the monasteries continued unabated, with the largest monasteries being dissolved by 1540.\n* Great tracts of land were seized from the Church and divided among the Crown and its supporters.\n* The steps towards official Protestantism achieved by Cromwell continued, except during the reign of Mary I.\n\n===Successes===\nTheir partial successes are less known:\n\n* The government postponed the collection of the October subsidy, a major grievance amongst the Lincolnshire organisations.\n* The Statute of Uses was partially negated by a new law, the [[Statute of Wills]].\n* Four of the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|seven sacraments]] that were omitted from the Ten Articles were restored in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles|Bishop's Book]] of 1537, which marked the end of the drift of official doctrine towards [[Protestantism]]. The Bishop's Book was followed by the [[Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]] of 1539.\n* An onslaught upon [[heresy]] was promised in a royal proclamation in 1538.\n\n==Leadership==\nHistorians have noted the leaders among the nobility and gentry in the Lincolnshire Rising and the Pilgrimage of Grace and tend to argue that the Risings gained legitimacy only through the involvement of the northern nobility and gentlemen, such as [[Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Darcy|Lord Darcy]], [[Lord Hussey]] and Robert Aske.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fletcher|first1=Anthony|last2=MacCulloch|first2=Diarmaid|title=Tudor Rebellions|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317437376}}</ref> However, historians such as M. E. James, C. S. L. Davies and [[Andy Wood (historian)|Andy Wood]], among others, believe the question of leadership was more complex.\n\nJames and Davies look at the Risings of 1536 as the product of common grievances. The lower classes were aggrieved because of the closure of local monasteries by the Act of Suppression. The northern nobility felt their rights were being taken away from them in the Acts of 1535\u20131536, which made them lose confidence in the royal government. James analysed how the lower classes and the nobility used each other as a legitimizing force in an extremely ordered society.\n\nThe nobles hid behind the force of the lower classes with claims of coercion, since they were seen as blameless for their actions because they did not possess political choice. This allowed the nobles an arena to air their grievances while, at the same time, playing the victims of popular violence. The lower classes used the nobility to give their grievance a sense of obedience since the \"leaders\" of the rebellion were of a higher social class.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=James|first1=M. E.|title=Obedience and Dissent in Henrician England: The Lincolnshire Rebellion 1536|journal=Past & Present|date=August 1970|issue=48|pages=68\u201376|jstor=650480}}</ref>\n\nDavies considers the leadership of the 1536 Risings as more of a cohesion. Common grievances over evil advisors and religion brought the higher and lower classes together in their fight. Once the nobles had to confront the King's forces and an all-out war, they decided to surrender, thereby ending the cohesion.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Davies|first1=C. S.

He argues that this force came from a class group largely left out of history: minor gentlemen and well-off farmers. He believes these groups were the leaders of the Risings because they had more political agency and thought.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Andy|title=Riot, rebellion and popular politics in early modern England|date=2002|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|isbn=9780333637623|pages=19\u201354}}</ref>\n\n==List of executions==\n\n===After the Lincolnshire Rising===\n* Richard Harrison, Abbot of [[Kirkstead Abbey]]\n* Thomas Kendal, priest and vicar of Louth\n* Matthew Mackerel, [[Premonstratensian]] abbot of [[Barlings Abbey]], titular bishop of Chalcedon;\n* [[Thomas Moigne]] (Moyne), gentleman\n* William Moreland (aka Borowby), priest of [[Louth Park Abbey]]\n* James Mallet, priest and chaplain to the late Queen Catherine\n\n===After the Pilgrimage===\nThe sub-[[prior]] of the Augustinian [[Cartmel Priory]] and several of the canons were hanged, along with ten villagers who had supported them.<ref name=BHOL>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=38352 |title=British History Online: The Priory of Cartmel |accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref> The monks of the Augustinian [[Hexham Abbey|Hexham priory]], who became involved in the Pilgrimage of Grace, were executed.\n\n*1537: George ab Alba Rose, Augustinian;\n*[[George Ashby (martyr)|George Ashby]] (Asleby), monk;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01776a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: George Ashby |website=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2016-11-05}}</ref>\n*Ralph Barnes, monk;\n*Laurence Blonham, monk;\n*James Cockerell, Prior of [[Gisborough Priory]];\n*William Coe, monk;\n*William Cowper, monk;\n*John Eastgate, monk;\n*Richard Eastgate, monk of Whalley Abbey; hanged 12 March 1537\n*John Francis, monk;\n*William Gylham, monk;\n*William Haydock, monk of Whalley Abbey; hanged 13 March 1537\n*Nicholas Heath, Prior of Lenton;\n*John Henmarsh, priest;\n*Robert Hobbes, Abbot of Woburn;\n*Henry Jenkinson, monk;\n*Richard Laynton, monk;\n*Robert Leeche, layman;\n*Hugh Londale, monk;\n*John Paslew, Abbot of [[Whalley Abbey]]; hanged at Whalley \n*25 May 1537: John Pickering, priest;<ref name=blood/>\n*Thomas Redforth, priest;\n*26 May 1537: [[Adam Sedbar, Abbot of Jervaulx]];\n*William Swale, monk;\n*John Tenant, monk;\n*Richard Wade, monk\n\n===Executed after Bigod's rebellion (1537)===\n*[[Robert Aske (political leader)|Robert Aske]], layman;{{sfn|Dodds, p. 225}}\n*[[Robert Constable]], layman;\n*[[Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Darcy|The Lord Darcy de Darcy]];{{sfn|Dodds, p. 194}}\n*[[Thomas Percy (Pilgrimage of Grace)|Sir Thomas Percy]];\n*John Pickering (friar);\n*William Trafford, Abbot of Sawley; hanged at Lancaster 10 March 1537\n*William Thyrsk (Thirsk), Cistercian former abbot of [[Fountains Abbey]]<ref name=blood>{{cite web|url=http://academic.regis.edu/bgeger/PDF%20files/London%20Martyrs%20List.pdf |title=London Martyrs List.PDF |website=Academic.regis.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-11-05}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[John Longland]], [[Bishop of Lincoln]] during the period\n*[[Prayer Book Rebellion]]\n*[[Rising of the North]]\n*[[Thomas Trahern]], [[Somerset Herald]], murdered in 1542 by William Leech of Fulletby, fugitive ringleader of the Lincolnshire rising\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite ODNB |last=Cross |first=Claire |year=2009 |title=Participants in the Pilgrimage of Grace (act. 1536\u20131537) |publisher=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-95587?rskey=UG8A5G&result=1 |accessdate=17 November 2018 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Dodds |first=Madeleine Hope |year=1971 |title=The Pilgrimage of Grace 1536\u20131537 and the Exeter Conspiracy 1538 |last2=Dodds |first2=Ruth |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=vDU9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA214 |ref=harv}}Still the major comprehensive history.\n*{{Cite book |last=Hamilton |first=William Douglas, ed. |year=1875 |title=A Chronicle of England During the Reigns of the Tudors from A.D. 1485 to 1559 by Charles Wriothesley, Windsor Herald |location=London |publisher=J.B.

Piperi is located between the [[Mora\u010da river|Mora\u010da]] and [[Zeta River|Zeta]] rivers up to the northern suburbs of the Montenegrin capital [[Podgorica]].\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nOral traditions and fragmentary stories were collected by writers, who travelled in the region, about the early history of Piperi. An interdisciplinary and comparative approach of those stories with recorded historical material has yielded more historically-grounded accounts in 20th and 21st centuries.\n\n[[Johann Georg von Hahn]] recorded the oral tradition about Piperi's origins in the mid 19th century. The same oral tradition with minor variations is preserved in other communities of the region. According to it the first direct male ancestor of the Triepshi was ''Ban Keqi'' son of ''Keq'', a Catholic Albanian who fled from Ottoman conquest and settled in a Slavic-speaking area that would become the historical Piperi region. His sons, ''Laz\u00ebr Keqi'' (ancestor of [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti)]]), ''Ban Keqi'' (ancestor of Triepshi), ''[[Mrkojevici|Merkota Keqi]], Kaster Keqi'' (ancestor of [[Krasniqi]]) and ''Vas Keqi'' (ancestor of [[Vasojevi\u0107i]]) had to abandon the village after committing murder against the locals, but ''Keq'' and his younger son ''Piper Keqi'' remained there and ''Piper Keqi'' became the direct ancestor of the Piperi tribe.{{sfn|Hahn|2015|p=125-35}} The name of the first ancestor, ''Keq'', which means ''bad'' in Albanian, is given in [[Mal\u00ebsia]] to only children or to children from families with very few children (due to infant mortality). In those families, an \"ugly\" name (''i \u00e7udun'') was given as a spoken talisman to protect the child from the \"[[evil eye]].{{sfn|Shkurtaj|2009|p=390}}\n\nHistorical research has shown that Piperi is not a tribe (''pleme'') of common patrilineal ancestry.{{sfn|Zlatar|1990|p=55}} It formed in the period between the mid 15th century and the 16th century by communities that settled in different periods in Piperi, where they also found an already settled population. Piperi appears in the defter of the [[Sanjak of Scutari]] in 1485 and in 1497. The population of Piperi more than doubled from 167 to 347 households from 1485 to 1497. 121 of those households were of unmarried men and 38 of widows. This indicates that many of the newcomers were refugees from areas conquered in Montenegro and northern Albania. In the supplementary defter of 1497, there are several kin groups in the region of Piperi, which appears as a distinct [[nahiya]] divided in three [[timar]]s under local Christian Ottoman [[spahi]]s.<ref name=\"Pulaha\"/> Many communities of the villages of Piperi were categorized as ''already settled'' or ''newcomers'' from other areas. In the villages, the communities formed clusters of households according to their kinship tries. This separation of settlements by kinship persisted even in the early 20th century. The villages of Piperi in 1497 were Luskozhupa, Drezka,  Strahalic, Belica, Moracica, Dug, Mirasnica, Dobrico, Radushev do, Brestica, Dirnovica, Merka. The biggest distinct tribal communities that inhabited Piperi at the time were [[Lu\u017eani (tribe)|Lu\u017eani]], [[Bukumiri]], [[Bushati family|Bushati]] and others.<ref name=\"Pulaha\">{{cite book |last1=Pulaha |first1=Selami |title=Defter i Sanxhakut t\u00eb Shkodr\u00ebs 1485 |date=1974 |publisher=Academy of Sciences of Albania |page=404, 430 |url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3ma9plMXxAEZi1PZTVXMXV1NFE/edit |accessdate=28 January 2020 |ref=Pulaha}}</ref> The Slavic anthroponymy at that time in Piperi is mainly attributed to the Lu\u017eani while the Albanian anthroponymy to Bukumiri, Bushati and some smaller communities.<ref name=\"Pulaha\"/> Other communities like the [[Macure]] and the [[Mataruge]] had also settled in Piperi.

An interdisciplinary and comparative approach of those stories with recorded historical material has yielded more historically-grounded accounts in 20th and 21st centuries.\n\n[[Johann Georg von Hahn]] recorded oral tradition about Piperi's origins in the mid 19th century. The same oral tradition with minor variations is preserved in other communities of the region. According to it the first direct male ancestor of the Triepshi was ''Ban Keqi'' son of ''Keq'', a Catholic Albanian who fled from Ottoman conquest and settled in a Slavic-speaking area that would become the historical Piperi region. His sons, ''Laz\u00ebr Keqi'' (ancestor of [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti)]]), ''Ban Keqi'' (ancestor of Triepshi), ''[[Mrkojevici|Merkota Keqi]], Kaster Keqi'' (ancestor of [[Krasniqi]]) and ''Vas Keqi'' (ancestor of [[Vasojevi\u0107i]]) had to abandon the village after committing murder against the locals, but ''Keq'' and his younger son ''Piper Keqi'' remained there and ''Piper Keqi'' became the direct ancestor of the Piperi tribe.{{sfn|Hahn|2015|p=125-35}} The name of the first ancestor, ''Keq'', which means ''bad'' in Albanian, is given in [[Mal\u00ebsia]] to only children or to children from families with very few children (due to infant mortality). In those families, an \"ugly\" name (''i \u00e7udun'') was given as a spoken talisman to protect the child from the \"[[evil eye]].{{sfn|Shkurtaj|2009|p=390}}\n\nHistorical research has shown that Piperi is not a tribe (''pleme'') of common patrilineal ancestry.{{sfn|Zlatar|1990|p=55}} It formed in the period between the mid 15th century and the 16th century by communities that settled in different periods in Piperi, where they also found an already settled population. Piperi appears in the defter of the [[Sanjak of Scutari]] in 1485 and in 1497. The population of Piperi more than doubled from 167 to 347 households from 1485 to 1497. 121 of those households were of unmarried men and 38 of widows. This indicates that many of the newcomers were refugees from areas conquered in Montenegro and northern Albania. In the supplementary defter of 1497, there are several kin groups in the region of Piperi, which appears as a distinct [[nahiya]] divided in three [[timar]]s under local Christian Ottoman [[spahi]]s.<ref name=\"Pulaha\"/> Many communities of the villages of Piperi were categorized as ''already settled'' or ''newcomers'' from other areas. In the villages, the communities formed clusters of households according to their kinship tries. This separation of settlements by kinship persisted even in the early 20th century. The villages of Piperi in 1497 were Luskozhupa, Drezka,  Strahalic, Belica, Moracica, Dug, Mirasnica, Dobrico, Radushev do, Brestica, Dirnovica, Merka.
