The artistic style of the series has a similar look to ''Rugrats'' and  ''[[Rocket Power]]'' (another Klasky Csupo series). The background music was recycled from later episodes of ''Rugrats''.\n\nIn a format similar to ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'', each episode starts and ends with a live-action segment.\n\nBy various accounts, the episodes turned out to be rather popular, to which individual McDonald's locations frequently ran out of VHS tapes, which were sold individually for $3.49 and could be bought with a small vanilla [[ice cream cone]] or [[Diet Coke]]. Klasky Csupo also sold them through their online [[gift shop]], which was shut down in fall 2005.\n\nA [[Happy Meal]] featuring [[Lego]] vehicles to build was released at the restaurant chain in 1999, a year after the series originally premiered.

Due to a sudden bout of stormy weather, the campers are forced to stay in the old house, where a holographic head named Franklin leads them through a challenging game which will eventually help them to escape. Along the way, the Fry Kids and McNuggets get caught in traps and are separated from the group and the rest face off against Franklin in a challenge of riddles. Tika, Hamburglar, and Birdie fail each riddle and are swept into traps, leaving only Ronald, Grimace, and Sundae to solve the final one, which they do. The holographic head turns out to be a child named Franklin programming the game with help from Tika (who wanted to give Ronald a challenge) and the McNuggets in a lab room. After Ronald gets a \"You Win\" out of Franklin, the scientist Dr. Quizzical returns to catch his son Franklin in the act and releases the others from their traps. Upon the group officially meeting Dr. Quizzical, he states that he had to leave a lecture he was giving early when he saw lightning on the mountain and that Franklin has done something like this before. Franklin apologizes to Ronald and the gang for his actions and is allowed to join their camping trip, becoming their new friend in the process.\n'''Note:''' The 1998 Klasky Csupo logo makes its debut on this episode.\n|LineColor=#FF6229\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=2\n|Title=The Legend of Grimace Island\n|DirectedBy=[[Jim Duffy (animator)|Jim Duffy]]\n|WrittenBy=[[Mark Zaslove]] and Eryk Casemiro\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1999|1|22}}\n|ShortSummary=Ronald and the gang go out on a journey to Grimace Island (where Grimace's species is discovered) after Grimace receives a letter supposedly by the island's residents asking for help.

Later, Hamburglar gets abducted by real aliens after foolishly accepting an offer to go on vacation with them, not realizing until too late that the vacation will end up keeping him away from Earth for thousands of years. Despite being angry at him for his lie and prank, Ronald and his friends go on a mission in outer space to rescue Hamburglar.\n'''Note:''' Ronald and Sundae go down the ball pit slide for the last time, as this is the last episode to have the original introduction and closing.

Pinchworm gives him tickets to a fake [[amusement park]] called Birthday World. During their visit, Ronald and his friends quickly become disappointed to find that most of the park's rides are broken and/or malfunctioning; they then ride a roller coaster which turns them into toddlers and babies with a ray. The gang then discovers that they were test subjects for Pinchworm's evil scheme to take over the world by using a bigger version of the ray to de-age the world's population into toddlers and babies. Despite the fact that the de-aging has left their abilities limited, Ronald and his friends set out to stop Pinchworm's scheme and restore themselves to their regular ages.\n'''Note:''' A new opening sequence was made for this episode and the next two.

Despite not being good at keeping secrets, Birdie agrees to, but this becomes difficult when Stiles and Pip's scheme goes awry, putting everyone in danger.\n'''Note:''' This episode was the rarest of all six, as it was only released online on the Klasky Csupo website on January 30, 2003 as opposed to McDonald's stores. The episode was titled \"The Legend of Ol\u2019 McDonaldland Loch\" on most websites.

The artistic style of the series has a similar look to ''Rugrats'' and  ''[[Rocket Power]]'' (another Klasky Csupo series). The background music was recycled from later episodes of ''Rugrats''.\n\nIn a format similar to ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'', each episode starts and ends with a live-action segment.\n\nBy various accounts, the episodes turned out to be rather popular, to which individual McDonald's locations frequently ran out of VHS tapes, which were sold individually for $3.49 and could be bought with a small vanilla [[ice cream cone]] or [[Diet Coke]]. Klasky Csupo also sold them through their online [[gift shop]], which was shut down in fall 2005.\n\nA [[Happy Meal]] featuring [[Lego]] vehicles to build was released at the restaurant chain in 1999, a year after the series originally premiered.

Due to a sudden bout of stormy weather, the campers are forced to stay in the old house, where a holographic head named Franklin leads them through a challenging game which will eventually help them to escape. Along the way, the Fry Kids and McNuggets get caught in traps and are separated from the group and the rest face off against Franklin in a challenge of riddles. Tika, Hamburglar, and Birdie fail each riddle and are swept into traps, leaving only Ronald, Grimace, and Sundae to solve the final one, which they do. The holographic head turns out to be a child named Franklin programming the game with help from Tika (who wanted to give Ronald a challenge) and the McNuggets in a lab room. After Ronald gets a \"You Win\" out of Franklin, the scientist Dr. Quizzical returns to catch his son Franklin in the act and releases the others from their traps. Upon the group officially meeting Dr. Quizzical, he states that he had to leave a lecture he was giving early when he saw lightning on the mountain and that Franklin has done something like this before. Franklin apologizes to Ronald and the gang for his actions and is allowed to join their camping trip, becoming their new friend in the process.\n'''Note:''' The 1998 Klasky Csupo logo makes its debut on this episode.\n|LineColor=#FF6229\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=2\n|Title=The Legend of Grimace Island\n|DirectedBy=[[Jim Duffy (animator)|Jim Duffy]]\n|WrittenBy=[[Mark Zaslove]] and Eryk Casemiro\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1999|1|22}}\n|ShortSummary=Ronald and the gang go out on a journey to Grimace Island (where Grimace's species is discovered) after Grimace receives a letter supposedly by the island's residents asking for help.

The gang then discovers that they were test subjects for Pinchworm's evil scheme to take over the world by using a bigger version of the ray to de-age the world's population into toddlers and babies. Despite the fact that the de-aging has left their abilities limited, Ronald and his friends set out to stop Pinchworm's scheme and restore themselves to their regular ages.\n'''Note:''' A new opening sequence was made for this episode and the next two.
