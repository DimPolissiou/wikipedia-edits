Yarnal, and B. L. Turner Ii. 2003. The Human Dimensions of Global Change. In Geography in America at the Dawn of the 21st Century, eds. G. L. Gaile and C. J. Willmott, 267-282. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> These five main divers of global change can stem from [[Shared_Socioeconomic_Pathways|socioeconomic]] factors which in turn, these can be seen as drivers in their own regard.\u00a0 Socioeconomic drivers of climate change can be triggered by a social or economic demand for resources such as a demand for timber or a demand for agricultural crops. \u00a0In tropical deforestation for instance, the main driver is economic opportunities that come the extraction of these resources and the conversion of this land to crop or rangelands. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Lambin, E. F., B. L. Turner Ii, J. Helmut, S. Agbola, A. Angelsen, J. Bruce, O. Coomes, R. Dirzo, G. Fischer, C. Folke, P. George, K. Homewood, J. Imbernon, R. Leemans, X. Li, E. Moran, M. Mortimore, R.

Global Environmental Change 11:261-269.</ref> These drivers can be manifested at any level, from the global level demand for timber all the way to the household level.\n\nAn example of how socioeconomic drivers affect [[Climate change|climate change]] can be seen in the [[Soybean|soy bean trading]] between Brazil and China. The trading of soy beans from to [[Brazil]] and [[China]] has grown immensely in the past few decades. This growth in trade between these two countries is stimulated by socioeconomic drivers. Some of the socioeconomic drivers in play here are the rising demand for Brazilian soy beans in China, the increase in land use change for soy bean production in Brazil, and the importance of strengthening foreign trade between the two countries. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Liu, J., V. Hull, M. Batistella, R. DeFries, T. Dietz, F. Fu, T. W. Hertel, R. C. Izaurralde, E. F. Lambin, S. Li, L. A. Martinelli, W. J. McConnell, E. F. Moran, R. Naylor, Z. Ouyang, K. R. Polenske, A. Reenberg, G. de Miranda Rocha, C. S. Simmons, P. H. Verburg, P. M. Vitousek, F. Zhang, and C. Zhu. 2013. Framing Sustainability in a Telecoupled World. Ecology and Society 18 (2).</ref> All of these socioeconomic drivers have implications in climate change. For instance, an increase in the development for soy bean croplands in Brazil means there needs to be more and more land made available for this resource. This causes the general land cover of forest to be converted into croplands which in its own regard has an impact on the environment. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Turner Ii, B. L., and W. Meyer. 1994. Global Land-Use and Land-Cover Change: An Overview. In Changes in Land Use and Land Cover: A Global Perspective, eds. W. Meyer and B. L. Turner Ii, 3-9. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>This example of land use change driven by a demand of a resource, isn\u2019t only happening in Brazil with soy bean production.\n[[File:Crawfish Farming - Acadia Parish Louisiana 2020.jpg|thumb]]\n\n\nAnother example came from The [[Renewable Energy Directive 2009]] Union when they mandated [[biofuel]] development for countries within their membership. With an international socioeconomic driver of increasing the production biofuels comes affects in land use in these countries. When agricultural cropland shift to bioenergy cropland the original crop supply decreases while the global market for this crop increases. This causes a cascading socioeconomic driver for the need for more agricultural croplands to support the growing demand. However, with the lack of available land from the crop substitution to biofuels, countries must look into areas further away to develop these original croplands. This causes spillover systems in countries where this new development takes place. For instance, African countries are converting savanna's into cropland and this all stems from the socioeconomic driver of wanting to develop biofuels. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Eakin, H., DeFries, R., Kerr, S., Lambin, E. F., Liu, J., Marcotullio, P. J., ... Zimmerer, K. (2014). Significance of telecoupling for exploration of land-use change. In ''Rethinking Global Land Use in an Urban Era'' (pp. 141-161). MIT Press.</ref> Furthermore, socioeconomic driver that cause land use change don\u2019t all occur at an international level. These drivers can be experienced all the way down to the household level. Crop substitution doesn't only come from biofuel shifts in agriculture, a big substitution came from Thailand when they switched the production of opium poppy plants to non-narcotic crops. This caused Thailand's agricultural sector to grow, but it caused global rippling effects. [[Opium replacement]]\n\nFor instance, in Wolong China, locals use forests as fuelwood to cook and heat their homes. So, the socioeconomic driver in play here is the local demand for timber to support subsistence in this area. With this driver, locals are depleting their supply for fuelwood so they have to keep moving further away to extract this resource. This movement and demand for timber is in turn contributing to the loss of pandas in this area because their ecosystem is getting destroyed. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Liu, J., T. Dietz, S. R.

Complexity of Coupled Human and Natural Systems. Science 317 (5844):1513- 1516</ref>\n\nHowever, when researching local trends the focus tends to be on outcomes instead of on how changes in the global drivers affect outcomes. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Stockholm Environment Institute. ''Linking Global and Local Scenarios under Climate Change''. Stockholm Environment Institute, 2003, www.jstor.org/stable/resrep00343. Accessed 12 Mar. 2020.\n\n\n</ref> With this being said, community level planning needs to be implemented when analyzing socioeconomic drivers of change.\n\nIn conclusion, one can see how socioeconomic drivers at any level play a role in the consequences of human actions on the environment. These drivers all have cascading effects on land, humans, resources, and the environment as a whole. With this being said, humans need to fully understand how their socioeconomic drivers can change the way we live. For instance, going back to the soy bean example, when the supply can\u2019t meet the demand for soy beans the global market for this crop increases which then in turn affects countries that rely on this crop for a food source. These affects can cause a higher price for soy beans at their stores and markets or it can cause an overall lack of availability for this crop in importing countries. With both of these outcomes, the household level is being affected by a national level socioeconomic driver of an increased demand for Brazilian soy beans in China. From just this one example alone, one can see how socioeconomic drivers influence changes at a national level that then lead to more global, regional, communal, and household level changes.

Yarnal, and B. L. Turner Ii. 2003. The Human Dimensions of Global Change. In Geography in America at the Dawn of the 21st Century, eds. G. L. Gaile and C. J. Willmott, 267-282. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> These five main divers of global change can stem from [[Shared_Socioeconomic_Pathways|socioeconomic]] factors which in turn, these can be seen as drivers in their own regard.\u00a0 Socioeconomic drivers of climate change can be triggered by a social or economic demand for resources such as a demand for timber or a demand for agricultural crops. \u00a0In tropical deforestation for instance, the main driver is economic opportunities that come the extraction of these resources and the conversion of this land to crop or rangelands. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Lambin, E. F., B. L. Turner Ii, J. Helmut, S. Agbola, A. Angelsen, J. Bruce, O. Coomes, R. Dirzo, G. Fischer, C. Folke, P. George, K. Homewood, J. Imbernon, R. Leemans, X. Li, E. Moran, M. Mortimore, R.

Global Environmental Change 11:261-269.</ref> These drivers can be manifested at any level, from the global level demand for timber all the way to the household level.\n\nAn example of how socioeconomic drivers affect [[Climate change|climate change]] can be seen in the [[Soybean|soy bean trading]] between Brazil and China. The trading of soy beans from to [[Brazil]] and [[China]] has grown immensely in the past few decades. This growth in trade between these two countries is stimulated by socioeconomic drivers. Some of the socioeconomic drivers in play here are the rising demand for Brazilian soy beans in China, the increase in land use change for soy bean production in Brazil, and the importance of strengthening foreign trade between the two countries. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Liu, J., V. Hull, M. Batistella, R. DeFries, T. Dietz, F. Fu, T. W. Hertel, R. C. Izaurralde, E. F. Lambin, S. Li, L. A. Martinelli, W. J. McConnell, E. F. Moran, R. Naylor, Z. Ouyang, K. R. Polenske, A. Reenberg, G. de Miranda Rocha, C. S. Simmons, P. H. Verburg, P. M. Vitousek, F. Zhang, and C. Zhu. 2013. Framing Sustainability in a Telecoupled World. Ecology and Society 18 (2).</ref> All of these socioeconomic drivers have implications in climate change. For instance, an increase in the development for soy bean croplands in Brazil means there needs to be more and more land made available for this resource. This causes the general land cover of forest to be converted into croplands which in its own regard has an impact on the environment. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Turner Ii, B. L., and W. Meyer. 1994. Global Land-Use and Land-Cover Change: An Overview. In Changes in Land Use and Land Cover: A Global Perspective, eds. W. Meyer and B. L. Turner Ii, 3-9. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>This example of land use change driven by a demand of a resource, isn\u2019t only happening in Brazil with soy bean production.\n[[File:Crawfish Farming - Acadia Parish Louisiana 2020.jpg|thumb]]\n\n\nAnother example came from The [[Renewable Energy Directive 2009]] Union when they mandated [[biofuel]] development for countries within their membership. With an international socioeconomic driver of increasing the production biofuels comes affects in land use in these countries. When agricultural cropland shift to bioenergy cropland the original crop supply decreases while the global market for this crop increases. This causes a cascading socioeconomic driver for the need for more agricultural croplands to support the growing demand. However, with the lack of available land from the crop substitution to biofuels, countries must look into areas further away to develop these original croplands. This causes spillover systems in countries where this new development takes place. For instance, African countries are converting savanna's into cropland and this all stems from the socioeconomic driver of wanting to develop biofuels. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Eakin, H., DeFries, R., Kerr, S., Lambin, E. F., Liu, J., Marcotullio, P. J., ... Zimmerer, K. (2014). Significance of telecoupling for exploration of land-use change. In ''Rethinking Global Land Use in an Urban Era'' (pp. 141-161). MIT Press.</ref> Furthermore, socioeconomic driver that cause land use change don\u2019t all occur at an international level. These drivers can be experienced all the way down to the household level. Crop substitution doesn't only come from biofuel shifts in agriculture, a big substitution came from Thailand when they switched the production of opium poppy plants to non-narcotic crops. This caused Thailand's agricultural sector to grow, but it caused global rippling effects. [[Opium replacement]]\n\nFor instance, in Wolong China, locals use forests as fuelwood to cook and heat their homes. So, the socioeconomic driver in play here is the local demand for timber to support subsistence in this area. With this driver, locals are depleting their supply for fuelwood so they have to keep moving further away to extract this resource. This movement and demand for timber is in turn contributing to the loss of pandas in this area because their ecosystem is getting destroyed. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Liu, J., T. Dietz, S. R.

Complexity of Coupled Human and Natural Systems. Science 317 (5844):1513- 1516</ref>\n\nHowever, when researching local trends the focus tends to be on outcomes instead of on how changes in the global drivers affect outcomes. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Stockholm Environment Institute. ''Linking Global and Local Scenarios under Climate Change''. Stockholm Environment Institute, 2003, www.jstor.org/stable/resrep00343. Accessed 12 Mar. 2020.\n\n\n</ref> With this being said, community level planning needs to be implemented when analyzing socioeconomic drivers of change.\n\nIn conclusion, one can see how socioeconomic drivers at any level play a role in the consequences of human actions on the environment. These drivers all have cascading effects on land, humans, resources, and the environment as a whole. With this being said, humans need to fully understand how their socioeconomic drivers can change the way we live. For instance, going back to the soy bean example, when the supply can\u2019t meet the demand for soy beans the global market for this crop increases which then in turn affects countries that rely on this crop for a food source. These affects can cause a higher price for soy beans at their stores and markets or it can cause an overall lack of availability for this crop in importing countries. With both of these outcomes, the household level is being affected by a national level socioeconomic driver of an increased demand for Brazilian soy beans in China. From just this one example alone, one can see how socioeconomic drivers influence changes at a national level that then lead to more global, regional, communal, and household level changes.

Lautering usually consists of 3 steps: mashout, recirculation, and sparging.\n\n==Mashout==\nMashout is the term for raising the temperature of the mash to {{convert|170|F|C|order=flip}}. This stops the [[enzyme|enzymatic]] conversion of [[starch]]es to fermentable [[sugar]]s, and makes the mash and wort more fluid. Mashout is considered especially necessary if there is less than 3 liters of water per kilogram of grain (3 pints of water per pound of grain), or if the grain is more than 25% [[wheat]] or [[oat]]s. The mashout step can be done by using external heat, or by adding hot water.<ref name=\"howtobrew\">\n{{cite book\n  | last = Palmer\n  | first = John\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = How to Brew\n  | publisher = Brewers Publications\n  | date = 2006\n  | location = Boulder, CO\n  | pages = Chapter 17\n  | url = http://www.howtobrew.com/\n  | isbn = 0-937381-88-8\n}}</ref><ref>[https://byo.com/article/lautering-101/ lautering]</ref>\n\n==Recirculation==\nRecirculation consists of drawing off wort from the bottom of the mash, and adding it to the top. Lauter tuns typically have slotted bottoms to assist in the filtration process. The mash itself functions much as a [[sand filter]] to capture mash debris and proteins. This step is monitored by use of a [[Nephelometer|turbidimeter]] to measure solids in the wort liquid by their [[opacity (optics)|opacity]].<ref name=\"howtobrew\" />\n\n==Sparging==\nSparging is trickling water through the grain to extract sugars. This is a delicate step, as the wrong temperature or [[pH]] will extract [[tannin]]s from the ''chaff'' (grain husks) as well, resulting in a bitter brew. Typically, 1.5 times more water is used for sparging than was for mashing.<ref name=\"howtobrew\" /> Sparging is typically conducted in a lauter tun.<ref name=\"howtobrew\" />\n\n[[English beer|English]] sparging (or batch sparging) drains the wort completely from the mash, after which more water is added, held for a while at {{convert|76|C|F}} and then drained again. The second draining can be used in making a lighter-bodied low-alcohol beer known as [[Low-alcohol beer#Small beer|small beer]], or can be added to the first draining. Some homebrewers use English sparging, except that the second batch of water is only held long enough for the grain bed to settle, after which recirculation and draining occurs.<ref name=\"howtobrew\" /><ref>[https://beerandbrewing.com/lauter-and-clear/ Lauter and Clear] Lautering is the process of separating sweet wort from mashed grain.</ref>\n\nFly sparging (or [[German beer|German]] sparging), which is used by commercial [[brewery|breweries]] and many homebrewers, uses continuous process sparging. When the wort reaches a desired level (typically about {{convert|1|in|abbr=in|order=flip|disp=or}}) above the grainbed, water is added at the same slow rate that wort is being drained. The wort gradually becomes weaker and weaker, and at a certain point, they stop adding water. This results in greater yields.<ref name=\"howtobrew\" />\n\n==Lauter tun==\n{{refimprove|section|date=August 2018}}\nA lauter tun is the traditional vessel used for separation of the extracted [[wort]].\nWhile the basic principle of its operation has remained the same since its first use, technological advances have led to better designed lauter tuns capable of quicker and more complete extraction of the sugars from the grain.\n\nThe false bottom in a lauter tun has thin ({{convert|0.7|to|1.1|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) slits to hold back the solids and allow liquids to pass through. The solids, not the false bottom, form a filtration medium and hold back small solids, allowing the otherwise cloudy mash to run out of the lauter tun as a clear liquid. The false bottom of today's lauter tun is made of wedge wire, which can provide a free-flow surface of up to 12% of the bottom of the tun.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of food chemistry|others=DeMan, John M., 1925-, Finley, John W., 1942-, Hurst, W.

Typically, these tubes have a wide, shallow cone around them to prevent compaction of the grain directly above the outlet. In the past, the run-off tubes flowed through swan-neck valves into a wort collection grant. While visually appealing, this system led to a lot of oxygen uptake. Such a system has mostly been replaced either by a central wort-collection vessel or the arrangement of outlet ports into concentric zones, with each zone having a ring-shaped collection pipe. Brewhouses in plain public view, particularly those in [[brewpub]]s, often maintain the swan-neck valves and grant for their visual effect.\n\nA good quality lauter tun has rotating rake arms with a central drive unit. Depending on the size of the lauter tun, there can be between two and six rake arms. Cutting blades hang from these arms. The blade is usually wavy and has a plough-like foot. Each blade has its own path around the tun and the whole rake assembly can be raised and lowered. Attached to each of these arms is a flap which can be raised and lowered for pushing the spent grains out of the tun. The brewer, or better yet an automated system, can raise and lower the rake arms depending on the turbidity (cloudiness) of the run-off, and the tightness of the grain bed, as measured by the pressure difference between the top and bottom of the grain bed.\n\nThere must be a system for introducing sparge water into the lauter tun. Most systems have a ring of spray heads that ensure an even and gentle introduction of the sparge water. The watering system should not beat down on the grain bed and form a channel.\n\nLarge breweries have self-closing inlets on the bottom of the tun through which the mash is transferred to the lauter tun, and one outlet, also on the bottom of the tun, into which the spent grains fall after lautering is complete. Craft breweries often have manways on the side of the mash tun for spent grain removal, which then must be helped along to a large extent by the brewer.\n\nSome small breweries use a combination mash/lauter tun, in which the rake system cannot be implemented because the mixing mechanism for mashing is of higher importance. The stirring blades can be used as an ersatz rake, but typically they cannot be moved up and down, and would disturb the bed too much were they used deep in the grain bed.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Brewing]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Brasserie Ratz - 20140926 - Cuve \u00e0 m\u00e9langer.jpg|thumb|right|Lauter tun.]]\n\n'''Lautering''' is a process in [[brewing]] [[beer]] in which the [[Mashing|mash]] is separated into the clear liquid [[wort]] and the residual grain.

On 12 May an Allied liaison team arrived in Flensburg and took quarters aboard the passenger ship ''Patria''. The liaison officers and the Supreme Allied Headquarters soon realized that they had no need to act through the Flensburg government and that its members should be arrested. On 23 May, acting on SHAEF's orders and with the approval of the Soviets, American Major General Rooks summoned D\u00f6nitz aboard the ''Patria'' and communicated to him that he and all the members of his Government were under arrest, and that their government was dissolved. The Allies had a problem, because they realized that although the German armed forces had surrendered unconditionally, SHAEF had failed to use the document created by the \"[[European Advisory Commission]]\" (EAC) and so there had been no formal surrender by the civilian German government. This was considered a very important issue, because just as the civilian, but not military, surrender in 1918 had been used by Hitler to create the \"[[Dolchstosslegende|stab in the back]]\" argument, the Allies did not want to give any future hostile German regime a legal argument to resurrect an old quarrel.\n\n'''[[Morgenthau Plan|Order JCS 1067]]''' was signed into effect by President [[Harry S. Truman]] on 10 May 1945. This was part of the post-war economic plan that advocated how the Allied occupation would include measures to prevent Germany from waging further war by eliminating its armament industry, and the removal or destruction of other key industries required for military strength. This included the removal or destruction of all industrial plants and equipment in the [[Ruhr]].<ref>{{Cite web | last    =Morgenthau | first   =Henry | author-link  = Henry Morgenthau, Jr. | publication-date = 27 May 2004 | year = 1944 | title= Suggested Post-Surrender Program for Germany [The original memorandum from 1944, signed by Morgenthau] (text and facsimile) | work = Box 31, Folder Germany: Jan.-Sept. 1944 (i297) | publisher = Franklin D.

They also ordered German [[demilitarization]], [[denazification]], [[Industrial plans for Germany|industrial disarmament]] and settlements of [[war reparations]].  But, as France (at American insistence) had not been invited to the Potsdam Conference, so the French representatives on the Allied Control Council subsequently refused to recognise any obligation to implement the Potsdam Agreement; with the  consequence that much of the programme envisaged at Potsdam, for the establishment of a German government and state adequate for accepting a peace settlement, remained a dead letter. \n\n[[File:Germany occupation zones with border.jpg|thumb|alt=Map showing the Allied zones of occupation in post-war Germany|The Allied zones of occupation in post-war Germany, highlighting the Soviet zone (red), the inner German border (heavy black line) and the zone from which British and US troops withdrew in July 1945 (purple).

On 12 May an Allied liaison team arrived in Flensburg and took quarters aboard the passenger ship ''Patria''. The liaison officers and the Supreme Allied Headquarters soon realized that they had no need to act through the Flensburg government and that its members should be arrested. On 23 May, acting on SHAEF's orders and with the approval of the Soviets, American Major General Rooks summoned D\u00f6nitz aboard the ''Patria'' and communicated to him that he and all the members of his Government were under arrest, and that their government was dissolved. The Allies had a problem, because they realized that although the German armed forces had surrendered unconditionally, SHAEF had failed to use the document created by the \"[[European Advisory Commission]]\" (EAC) and so there had been no formal surrender by the civilian German government. This was considered a very important issue, because just as the civilian, but not military, surrender in 1918 had been used by Hitler to create the \"[[Dolchstosslegende|stab in the back]]\" argument, the Allies did not want to give any future hostile German regime a legal argument to resurrect an old quarrel.\n\n'''[[Morgenthau Plan|Order JCS 1067]]''' was signed into effect by President [[Harry S.

She is beautiful and friendly when approached, yet places a wall between herself and others so she has no close friends.

She is particularly annoyed with Haruki, who has been persistently pestering her for the past half year. However, once Haruki befriends her, she is a valuable ally for the cultural festival.

It is a [[rare-earth element]] with a metallic silver luster. Dysprosium is never found in nature as a free element, though it is found in various minerals, such as [[xenotime]]. Naturally occurring dysprosium is composed of seven [[isotope]]s, the most [[isotopic abundance|abundant]] of which is <sup>164</sup>Dy.\n\nDysprosium was first identified in 1886 by [[Paul \u00c9mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]], but it was not isolated in pure form until the development of [[ion-exchange]] techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements. It is used for its high thermal-neutron absorption cross-section in making [[control rod]]s in [[nuclear reactor]]s, for its high [[magnetic susceptibility]] (<math>\\chi_v \\approx 5.44 \\times 10^{-3}</math>) in data-storage applications, and as a component of [[Terfenol-D]] (a magnetostrictive material).

Lt. Gen. Nikolai Parshin, chief of the Missile and Artillery Directorate, said that after Dutch investigators displayed parts of the missile and their serial numbers, they studied and declassified archives at the research center that produced the Buk missiles. Parshin said the Russian archives show that the missile that was made of these parts was transported to a military unit in western Ukraine in 1986, and to Russia's knowledge never left Ukraine.

It is also known variously as the '''Boer War''', '''Anglo-Boer War''', or '''South African War'''. Initial Boer attacks were successful, and although British reinforcements later reversed these, the war continued for years with Boer [[guerrilla warfare]], until harsh British counter-measures brought the Boers to terms.\n\nThe war started with the British overconfident and under-prepared.<ref name=\"millard\">{{cite book|last1=Millard|first1=Candice|title=Hero of the Empire: The Boer War, a daring escape, and the making of Winston Churchill|date=2016|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=978-0-385-53573-1}}</ref> The Boers were well armed and struck first, besieging [[Siege of Ladysmith|Ladysmith]], [[Siege of Kimberley|Kimberley]], and [[Siege of Mafeking|Mafeking]] in early 1900, and winning important battles at [[Battle of Colenso|Colenso]], [[Battle of Magersfontein|Magersfontein]] and [[Battle of Stormberg|Stormberg]]. Staggered, the British brought in large numbers of soldiers and fought back. [[Redvers Buller|General Redvers Buller]] was replaced by [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] and [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]. They relieved the three besieged cities, and invaded the two Boer republics in late 1900. The onward marches of the [[British Army]], well over 400,000 men, were so overwhelming that the Boers did not fight staged battles in defence of their homeland.\n\nThe British army seized control of all of the Orange Free State and Transvaal, as the civilian leadership went into hiding or exile. In conventional terms, the war was over. The British officially annexed the two countries in 1900. Back home, Britain's Conservative government wanted to capitalize on this success and use it to maneuver an early general election, dubbed a \"[[khaki election]]\", to give the government another six years of power in London.<ref name=\"bristolmercury\">{{cite web |last1=Biggins |first1=David |title=Khaki Election of 1900 |url=https://www.angloboerwar.com/forum/8-events/8709-khaki-election-of-1900 |website=angloboerwar.com |accessdate=November 27, 2018}}</ref> British military efforts were aided by [[Cape Colony]], the [[Colony of Natal]] and some native African allies, and further supported by volunteers from the [[British Empire]], including [[southern Africa]], the Australian colonies, Canada, [[British Raj|India]] and New Zealand. All other nations were neutral, but international opinion was largely hostile to the British.<ref>See [[Opposition to the Second Boer War#Among neutrals]]</ref> Inside the British Empire there also was significant [[opposition to the Second Boer War]].\n\nThe Boers refused to surrender. They reverted to guerrilla warfare under new generals [[Louis Botha]], [[Jan Smuts]], [[Christiaan de Wet]] and [[Koos de la Rey]]. Two years of surprise attacks and quick escapes followed. As guerrillas without uniforms, the Boer fighters easily blended into the farmlands, which provided hiding places, supplies, and horses.\n\nThe British response to guerrilla warfare was to set up complex nets of [[blockhouse]]s, [[strongpoint]]s, and barbed wire fences, partitioning off the entire conquered territory. In addition, civilian farms and livestock were destroyed as part of a [[scorched earth]] policy. Survivors were forced into [[British concentration camps|concentration camps]]. Very large proportions of these civilians died of hunger and disease, especially the children.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/women-children-white-concentration-camps-during-anglo-boer-war-1900-1902|title=Women & Children in White Concentration Camps during the Anglo-Boer War, 1900\u20131902|date=2011-03-21|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>\n\nBritish mounted infantry units systematically tracked down the highly mobile Boer guerrilla units. The battles at this stage were small operations. Few died during combat, though many of disease. The war ended when the Boer leadership surrendered and accepted British terms with the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] in May 1902.  Both former republics were incorporated into the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910, as part of the British Empire.\n\n== Name ==\nThe conflict is commonly referred to as the Boer War, since the [[First Boer War]] (December 1880 to March 1881) was a much smaller conflict. \"[[Boer]]\" (meaning farmer) is the common term for [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]-speaking [[white South African]]s descended from the [[Dutch East India Company]]'s original settlers at the [[Cape of Good Hope]].  It is also known as the (Second) Anglo-Boer War among some South Africans. In Afrikaans it may be called the ''Anglo-Boereoorlog'' (\"Anglo-Boer War\"), ''Tweede Boereoorlog'' (\"Second Boer War\"), ''Tweede Vryheidsoorlog'' (\"Second Freedom War\") or ''Engelse oorlog'' (\"English War\").{{sfn|Gronum|1977}}\n\nIn [[South Africa]] it is officially called the South African War.{{sfn|''South African History Online''|2011}} In fact, according to a 2011 [[BBC]] report, \"most scholars prefer to call the war of 1899\u20131902 the South African War, thereby acknowledging that all South Africans, white and black, were affected by the war and that many were participants\".<ref name=\"bbc01\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/victorians/boer_wars_01.shtml|title=History \u2013 The Boer Wars|last=Pretorius|first=Fransjohan|date=2008-03-18|website=[[BBC]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200407234451/https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/victorians/boer_wars_01.shtml|archive-date=7 April 2020|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\nThe origins of the war were complex and stemmed from more than a century of conflict between the Boers and Britain.

After Britain annexed Natal in 1843, they journeyed further northwards into South Africa's vast eastern interior. There they established two independent Boer republics: the South African Republic (1852; also known as the Transvaal Republic) and the Orange Free State (1854). Britain recognised the two Boer republics in 1852 and 1854, but attempted British annexation of the Transvaal in 1877 led to the [[First Boer War]] in 1880\u201381. After Britain suffered defeats, particularly at the [[Battle of Majuba Hill]] (1881), the independence of the two republics was restored subject to certain conditions; relations, however, remained uneasy.\n\nIn 1866 diamonds were discovered at [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], prompting a [[diamond rush]] and a massive influx of foreigners to the borders of the Orange Free State. Then in 1886, gold was discovered in the Witwatersrand area of the South African Republic. Gold made the Transvaal the richest nation in southern Africa; however, the country had neither the manpower nor the industrial base to develop the resource on its own. As a result, the Transvaal reluctantly acquiesced to the immigration of ''[[uitlander]]s'' (foreigners), mainly English-speaking men from Britain, who came to the Boer region in search of fortune and employment. This resulted in the number of uitlanders in the Transvaal potentially exceeding the number of Boers, and precipitated confrontations between the earlier-arrived Boer settlers and the newer, non-Boer arrivals.\n\nBritain's expansionist ideas (notably propagated by [[Cecil Rhodes]]) as well as disputes over uitlander political and economic rights resulted in the failed [[Jameson Raid]] of 1895. Dr. [[Leander Starr Jameson]], who led the raid, intended to encourage an uprising of the uitlanders in [[Johannesburg]]. However, the uitlanders did not take up arms in support, and Transvaal government forces surrounded the column and captured Jameson's men before they could reach Johannesburg.{{sfn|Pakenham|1979|pp=1\u20135}}\n\nAs tensions escalated, political manoeuvrings and negotiations attempted to reach compromise on the issues of the rights of the uitlanders within the South African Republic, control of the gold mining industry, and Britain's desire to incorporate the Transvaal and the Orange Free State into a federation under British control. Given the British origins of the majority of uitlanders and the ongoing influx of new uitlanders into Johannesburg, the Boers recognised that granting full voting rights to the uitlanders would eventually result in the loss of ethnic Boer control in the South African Republic.\n\nThe June 1899 [[Bloemfontein Conference|negotiations in Bloemfontein]] failed, and in September 1899 British [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] [[Joseph Chamberlain]] demanded full voting rights and representation for the uitlanders residing in the Transvaal. [[Paul Kruger]], the President of the South African Republic, issued an ultimatum on 9 October 1899, giving the British government 48 hours to withdraw all their troops from the borders of both the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, albeit Kruger had ordered [[Boer Commando|Commandos]] to the Natal border in early September and Britain only had troops in garrison towns far from the border,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/15699/15699-h/15699-h.htm|title=A Handbook of the Boer War|publisher=[[Gale and Polden]]|year=1910|isbn=978-1-37-497455-5|location=[[London]]|pages=|orig-year=}}</ref> failing which the Transvaal, allied to the Orange Free State, would declare war on the British government. The British government rejected the South African Republic's ultimatum, resulting in the South African Republic and Orange Free State declaring war on Britain.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Phases ==\nThe war had three phases. In the first phase, the Boers mounted preemptive strikes into British-held territory in Natal and the Cape Colony, besieging the British garrisons of [[Siege of Ladysmith|Ladysmith]], [[Siege of Mafeking|Mafeking]], and [[Siege of Kimberley|Kimberley]]. The Boers then won a series of tactical victories at [[Battle of Stormberg|Stormberg]], [[Battle of Magersfontein|Magersfontein]], [[Battle of Colenso|Colenso]] and [[Battle of Spion Kop|Spion Kop]].\n\nIn the second phase, after the number of British troops was greatly increased under the command of [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]], the British launched another offensive in 1900 to relieve the sieges, this time achieving success. After Natal and the Cape Colony were secure, the British army was able to invade the Transvaal, and the republic's capital, [[Pretoria]], was ultimately captured in June 1900.\n\nIn the third and final phase, beginning in March 1900 and lasting a further two years, the Boers conducted a hard-fought guerrilla war, attacking British troop columns, telegraph sites, railways, and storage depots. To deny supplies to the Boer guerrillas, the British, now under the leadership of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], adopted a [[scorched earth]] policy. They cleared whole areas, destroying Boer farms and moving the civilians into concentration camps.{{sfn|Pakenham|1979|pp=493\u201395}}\n\nSome parts of the British press and British government expected the campaign to be over within months, and the protracted war gradually became less popular, especially after revelations about the conditions in the concentration camps (where as many as 26,000 Afrikaner women and children died of disease and malnutrition). The Boer forces finally surrendered on Saturday, 31 May 1902, with 54 of the 60 delegates from the Transvaal and Orange Free State voting to accept the terms of the peace treaty.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wessels|2000|p=97}}</ref> This was known as the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]], and under its provisions, the two republics were absorbed into the British Empire, with the promise of self-government in the future. This promise was fulfilled with the creation of the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910.\n\nThe war had a lasting effect on the region and on British domestic politics. For Britain, the Second Boer War was the longest, the most expensive (\u00a3211&nbsp;million, \u00a3202&nbsp;billion at 2014 prices), and the bloodiest conflict between 1815 and 1914,<ref>{{Harvnb|Pakenham|1979|p=xv}}</ref> lasting three months longer and resulting in more British combat casualties than the [[Crimean War]] (1853\u201356), although more soldiers died from disease in the Crimean War.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:British Empire in 1898.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Extent of the British Empire in 1898, prior to the outbreak of the Second Boer War]]\n[[File:SouthAfrica1885.svg|thumb|270px|The geography of the region in 1885, between the [[First Boer War|First]] and Second Boer Wars]]\nThe southern part of the African continent was dominated in the 19th century by a set of struggles to create within it a single unified state. While the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u201385 sought to draw boundaries between the European powers' African possessions, it also set the stage for further scrambles. Britain attempted to annex first the South African Republic in 1880, and then, in 1899, both the South African Republic and the Orange Free State. In 1868, Britain annexed [[History of Lesotho|Basutoland]] in the [[Drakensberg]] Mountains following an appeal from [[Moshesh]], the leader of a mixed group of African refugees from the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] wars, who sought British protection against the Boers.\n\nIn the 1880s, Bechuanaland (modern [[Botswana]], located north of the Orange River) became the object of a dispute between the Germans to the west, the Boers to the east, and Britain's [[Cape Colony]] to the south. Although Bechuanaland had no economic value, the \"Missionaries Road\" passed through it towards territory farther north. After the Germans annexed [[Damaraland]] and Namaqualand (modern [[Namibia]]) in 1884, Britain annexed Bechuanaland in 1885.\n\nIn the [[First Boer War]] of 1880\u201381 the Boers of the Transvaal Republic had proved skilful fighters in resisting Britain's attempt at annexation, causing a series of British defeats. The British government of [[William Ewart Gladstone]] had been unwilling to become mired in a distant war, requiring substantial troop reinforcement and expense, for what was at the time perceived to be a minimal return. An armistice followed, ending the war, and subsequently a peace treaty was signed with the Transvaal President [[Paul Kruger]].\n\nIn 1886, when a big gold field was discovered at an outcrop on a large ridge some {{convert|69|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the Boer capital at [[Pretoria]], it reignited British imperial interests. The ridge, known locally as the \"[[Witwatersrand]]\" (white water ridge, a watershed) contained the world's largest deposit of gold-bearing ore. With the 1886 discovery of gold in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], a [[gold rush]] brought thousands of British and other prospectors and settlers from across the globe and over the border from the [[Cape Colony]] (under British control since 1806).\n\nThe city of [[Johannesburg]] sprang up as a [[shanty town]] nearly overnight as the ''[[uitlanders]]'' (foreigners, white outsiders) poured in and settled around the mines. The influx was such that the uitlanders quickly outnumbered the [[Boer]]s in Johannesburg and along the Rand, although they remained a minority in the Transvaal. The Boers, nervous and resentful of the uitlanders' growing presence, sought to contain their influence through requiring lengthy residential qualifying periods before voting rights could be obtained, by imposing taxes on the gold industry and by introducing controls through licensing, tariffs and administrative requirements. Among the issues giving rise to tension between the Transvaal government on the one hand and the uitlanders and British interests on the other, were\n* Established uitlanders, including the mining magnates, wanted political, social, and economic control over their lives. These rights included a stable constitution, a fair franchise law, an independent judiciary and a better educational system. The Boers, for their part, recognised that the more concessions they made to the uitlanders the greater the likelihood\u2014with approximately 30,000 white male Boer voters and potentially 60,000 white male uitlanders\u2014that their independent control of the Transvaal would be lost and the territory absorbed into the British Empire.\n* The uitlanders resented the taxes levied by the Transvaal government, particularly when this money was not spent on Johannesburg or uitlander interests, but diverted to projects elsewhere in the Transvaal. For example, as the gold-bearing ore sloped away from the outcrop underground to the south, more and more blasting was necessary for extraction, and mines consumed vast quantities of explosives. A box of dynamite costing five pounds included five shillings tax. Not only was this tax perceived as exorbitant, but British interests were offended when President [[Paul Kruger]] gave monopoly rights for the manufacture of the explosive to a non-British branch of the Nobel company, which infuriated Britain.{{sfn|Cartwright|1964|p={{Page needed|date=July 2010}} }} The so-called \"dynamite monopoly\" became a [[casus belli]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1.0em 1.0em; text-align:right; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#ccf;\"| Gold Production on the Witwatersrand <br /> 1898 to 1910{{sfn|Yap|Leong Man|1996 |p=134}}\n|-\n| '''Year''' || '''No. of <br />Mines''' || '''Gold output<br />(fine ounces)''' || '''Value ([[Pound sterling|GB\u00a3]])''' || '''Relative 2010<br /> value ([[Pound sterling|GB\u00a3]])<ref>{{harvnb|Measuringworth|2015}}, Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount \u2013 average earnings, retrieved on 27 January 2011</ref>'''\n|-\n| 1898 || 77 || 4,295,608 || \u00a315,141,376 || \u00a36,910,000,000\n|-\n| 1899<br /> (Jan\u2013Oct) || 85 || 3,946,545 || \u00a314,046,686 || \u00a36,300,000,000\n|-\n| 1899<br /> (Nov) \u2013 1901 (Apr)|| 12 || 574,043 || \u00a32,024,278 || \u00a3908,000,000\n|-\n| 1901<br /> (May\u2013Dec) || 12 || 238,994 || \u00a31,014,687 || \u00a3441,000,000\n|-\n| 1902 || 45 || 1,690,100 || \u00a37,179,074 || \u00a33,090,000,000\n|-\n| 1903 || 56 || 2,859,482 || \u00a312,146,307 || \u00a35,220,000,000\n|-\n| 1904 || 62 || 3,658,241 || \u00a315,539,219 || \u00a36,640,000,000\n|-\n| 1905 || 68 || 4,706,433 || \u00a319,991,658 || \u00a38,490,000,000\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"5\" style=\"color:#900;\"|\n|}\n\nBritish imperial interests were alarmed when in 1894\u201395 Kruger proposed building a railway through [[Portuguese East Africa]] to [[Maputo Bay|Delagoa Bay]], bypassing British-controlled ports in Natal and Cape Town and avoiding British tariffs.{{sfn|Nathan|1941|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }} At the time the Prime Minister of the Cape Colony was [[Cecil Rhodes]], a man driven by a vision of a British-controlled Africa extending from [[Cape to Cairo Road|Cape to Cairo]]. Certain self-appointed ''uitlanders'' representatives and British mine owners became increasingly angered and frustrated by their dealings with the Transvaal government. A Reform Committee (Transvaal) was formed to represent the uitlanders.\n\n=== Jameson Raid ===\n{{Main|Jameson Raid}}\n[[File:Leander Starr Jameson00.jpg|thumb|A sketch showing the arrest of [[Jameson Raid|Jameson]] after the failed raid, in 1896]]\n\nIn 1895, a plan was hatched with the connivance of the Cape Prime Minister [[Cecil Rhodes]] and Johannesburg gold magnate [[Alfred Beit]] to take [[Johannesburg]], ending the control of the Transvaal government. A column of 600 armed men (mainly made up of his [[Rhodesia (name)|Rhodesian]] and [[Bechuanaland]] [[British South Africa Police]]men) was led by Dr. [[Leander Starr Jameson]] (the Administrator [[Company rule in Rhodesia|in Rhodesia]] of the [[British South Africa Company]] (or Chartered Company) of which Cecil Rhodes was the chairman) over the border from Bechuanaland towards Johannesburg. The column was equipped with Maxim machine guns and some artillery pieces.\n\nThe plan was to make a three-day dash to Johannesburg and trigger an uprising by the primarily British expatriate workers (uitlanders) organised by the [[Johannesburg Reform Committee|Reform Committee]] before the [[Boer commando]]s could mobilise. The Transvaal authorities had advance warning of the [[Jameson Raid]] and tracked it from the moment it crossed the border. Four days later, the weary and dispirited column was surrounded near [[Krugersdorp]] within sight of Johannesburg. After a brief skirmish in which the column lost 65 killed and wounded\u2014while the Boers lost but one man\u2014Jameson's men surrendered and were arrested by the Boers.{{sfn|Pakenham|1979|pp=1\u20135}}\n\nThe botched raid resulted in repercussions throughout southern Africa and in Europe. In Rhodesia, the departure of so many policemen enabled the [[Northern Ndebele people|Matabele]] and [[Shona people|Mashona]] peoples to rise up against the Chartered Company, and the rebellion, known as the [[Second Matabele War]], was suppressed only at great cost.\n\nA few days after the raid, the German Kaiser sent the [[Kruger telegram]] congratulating President Kruger and the government of the South African Republic on their success. When the text of this telegram was disclosed in the British press, it generated a storm of anti-German feeling. In the baggage of the raiding column, to the great embarrassment of Britain, the Boers found telegrams from Cecil Rhodes and the other plotters in Johannesburg. [[Joseph Chamberlain]], the British Colonial Secretary, quickly moved to condemn the raid, despite having approved Rhodes' plans to send armed assistance in the case of a Johannesburg uprising. Rhodes was severely censured at the Cape inquiry and the London parliamentary inquiry and forced to resign as Prime Minister of the Cape and as Chairman of the Chartered Company, for having sponsored the failed ''coup d'\u00e9tat''.\n\nThe Boer government handed their prisoners over to the British for trial. Jameson was tried in England for leading the raid where the British press and London society inflamed by anti-Boer and anti-German feeling and in a frenzy of jingoism, lionised Jameson and treated him as a hero. Although sentenced to 15 months imprisonment (which he served in [[Holloway (HM Prison)|Holloway]]), Jameson was later rewarded by being named Prime Minister of the Cape Colony (1904\u201308) and ultimately anointed as one of the founders of the Union of South Africa. For conspiring with Jameson, the uitlander members of the Reform Committee (Transvaal) were tried in the Transvaal courts and found guilty of high treason. The four leaders were sentenced to death by hanging but this sentence was next day commuted to 15 years' imprisonment. In June 1896, the other members of the Committee were released on payment of \u00a32,000 each in fines, all of which were paid by Cecil Rhodes. One Reform Committee member, Frederick Gray, had committed suicide while in Pretoria [[gaol]], on 16 May, and his death was a factor in softening the Transvaal government's attitude to the remaining prisoners.\n\nJan C. Smuts wrote in 1906,\n\n{{quote|The Jameson Raid was the real declaration of war&nbsp;... And that is so in spite of the four years of truce that followed&nbsp;... [the] aggressors consolidated their alliance&nbsp;... the defenders on the other hand silently and grimly prepared for the inevitable\".{{sfn|Pakenham|1979|p=9|date=February 2017}} }}\n\n=== Escalation and war ===\nThe Jameson Raid alienated many Cape Afrikaners from Britain and united the Transvaal Boers behind President Kruger and his government. It also had the effect of drawing the Transvaal and the [[Orange Free State]] (led by President [[Martinus Theunis Steyn]]) together in opposition to perceived British imperialism. In 1897, a military pact was concluded between the two republics.\n\n==== Arming the Boers ====\nIn earlier conflicts, the Boers's most common weapon was the Westley Richards, falling-block, breech-loader. A book about the war (J. Lehmann's  ''The First Boer War'', 1972)  offered this comment: \"Employing chiefly the very fine breech-loading Westley Richards \u2013 calibre 45; paper cartridge; percussion-cap replaced on the nipple manually \u2013 they made it exceedingly dangerous for the British to expose themselves on the skyline\".<ref>{{cite web | last=Machanik | first=Felix | title=Firearms and Firepower \u2013 First War of Independence, 1880\u20131881 \u2013 Journal | website=South African Military History Society | url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol052fm.html | access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>\n[[File:KrugerPaulusJohannes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Kruger]], leader of the [[South African Republic]] (Transvaal)]]\n[[File:Rifle, bolt action (AM 1930.61-17).jpg|thumb|Mauser 1895 bolt-action rifle (at the Auckland Museum)]]\nPresident [[Paul Kruger]] re-equipped the Transvaal army, importing 37,000 of the latest 7x57 mm [[Mauser Model 1895]] rifles,<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2016/6/1/the-guns-of-the-boer-commandos/|title=The Guns of the Boer Commandos|last=Smith-Christmas|first=Kenneth L.|date=2016-06-01|website=American Rifleman|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314072227/https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2016/6/1/the-guns-of-the-boer-commandos/|archive-date=14 March 2020|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref> and some 40 to 50&nbsp;million rounds of ammunition.<ref>{{harvnb|Bester|1994|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}; {{Harvnb|Wessels|2000|p=80}}.</ref> Some commandos used the [[Martini-Henry]] Mark III, since thousands of these had also been purchased; the drawback was the large puff of white smoke after firing which gave away the shooter's position.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web | last=Scarlata | first=Paul | title=6 Rifles Used by the Afrikaners During the Second Boer War | website=Tactical Life Gun Magazine | date=2017-04-17 | url=https://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/second-boer-war-rifles/ | access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Pretorius|first=Fransjohan|title=Life on Commando during the Anglo-Boer War 1899\u20131902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WfovAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA81|year=1999|publisher=Human & Rousseau|isbn=978-0-7981-3808-6|page=81}}</ref> Roughly 7,000 Guedes 1885 rifles had also been purchased a few years earlier, and these were also used during the hostilities.<ref name=\"auto1\" />\n\nAs the war went on, some commandos relied on captured British rifles such as the [[Lee-Metford]] and the [[Lee\u2013Enfield|Enfield]].<ref name=\"auto2\" /><ref name=bbc01 /> In fact, when the ammunition for the Mausers ran out, the Boers relied primarily on the captured Lee-Metfords.<ref>{{cite book|last=Muller|first=C.

President Kruger's victory in the Jameson Raid incident did nothing to resolve the fundamental problem of finding a formula to conciliate the uitlanders, without surrendering the independence of the Transvaal.\n\n==== British case for war ====\nThe failure to gain improved rights for uitlanders became a pretext for war and a justification for a big military buildup in Cape Colony. The case for war was developed and espoused as far away as the Australian colonies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Connolly|first=C.

Confident that the Boers would be quickly defeated, they planned and organised a short war, citing the uitlanders' grievances as the motivation for the conflict.\n\nThe influence of the war party with the British government was limited. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], the Prime Minister, despised [[jingoism]] and jingoists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.me.uk/lordsalisbury.html|title=Lord Salisbury|last=Crowhurst|first=Peter|date=|website=www.britishempire.me.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> He also distrusted the abilities of the British Army. Yet he led Britain into war because he believed the British government had an obligation to British South Africans, because he thought that the Transvaal, the Orange Free State, and the Cape Boers aspired to a Dutch South Africa and that the achievement of such a state would damage British imperial prestige and because of the Boers treatment of black South Africans (Salisbury had referred to the [[London Convention (1884)|London Convention of 1884]], after the British defeat, as an agreement 'really in the interest of slavery').<ref>{{Harvnb|Steele|2000|p=7}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Steele|2000|p=6}}</ref> Salisbury was not alone in this concern over the treatment of black South Africans; [[Roger Casement]], already well on the way to becoming an Irish Nationalist, was nevertheless happy to gather intelligence for the British against the Boers because of their cruelty to Africans.<ref>{{harvnb|Jeffery|2000|p=145}} cites {{harvnb|Inglis|1974|pp=53\u201355}}</ref>\n\nGiven this sense of caution among members of the British cabinet and of the army, it is even harder to understand why the British government went against the advice of its generals (such as Wolseley) to send substantial reinforcements to South Africa before war broke out. Lansdowne, Secretary of State for War, did not believe the Boers were preparing for war and also believed that if Britain were to send large numbers of troops, it would strike too aggressive a posture and so prevent a negotiated settlement being reached or even encourage a Boer attack.{{sfn|Surridge|2000|p=24}}\n\n==== Negotiations fail ====\nPresident Steyn of the Orange Free State invited Milner and Kruger to attend a conference in [[Bloemfontein]]. The conference started on 30 May 1899 but negotiations quickly broke down, despite Kruger's offer of concessions. In September 1899, Chamberlain sent an ultimatum demanding full equality for British citizens resident in Transvaal. Kruger, seeing that war was inevitable, simultaneously issued his own ultimatum prior to receiving Chamberlain's. This gave Britain 48 hours to withdraw all their troops from the border of Transvaal or the Transvaal, allied with the Orange Free State, would declare war.\n\nNews of the ultimatum reached London on the day it expired. Outrage and laughter were the main responses. The editor of the ''Times'' laughed out loud when he read it, saying 'an official document is seldom amusing and useful yet this was both'. ''The Times'' denounced the ultimatum as an 'extravagant farce' and ''The Globe'' denounced this 'trumpery little state'. Most editorials were similar to the ''Daily Telegraph'', which declared: 'of course there can only be one answer to this grotesque challenge. Kruger has asked for war and war he must have!'\n\nSuch views were far from those of the British government and from those in the army. To most sensible observers, army reform had been a matter of pressing concern from the 1870s, constantly put off because the British public did not want the expense of a larger, more professional army and because a large home army was not politically welcome. Lord Salisbury, the Prime Minister, then had to explain to a surprised Queen Victoria that 'We have no army capable of meeting even a second-class Continental Power'.<ref>{{Harvnb|Steele|2000|p=4}}</ref>\n\nWhen war with the Boer Republics was imminent in September 1899, a Field Force, referred to as the Army Corps (sometimes 1st Army Corps) was mobilised and sent to Cape Town. It was \"about the equivalent of the [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Army Corps]] of the existing mobilization scheme\" and was placed under the command of Gen Sir [[Redvers Buller]], GOC in C of [[Aldershot Command]].<ref>Dunlop, Colonel John K., ''The Development of the British Army 1899\u20131914'', London, Methuen (1938) p. 72.</ref> In South Africa the corps never operated as such and the [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st]], [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd]] and [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd]] divisions were widely dispersed.\n\n== First phase: The Boer offensive (October\u2013December 1899) ==\n\n=== Boer organisation and skills ===\n\nWar was declared on 11 October 1899 with a Boer offensive into the British-held Natal and Cape Colony areas. The Boers had about 33,000 soldiers, and decisively outnumbered the British, who could move only 13,000 troops to the front line.{{sfn|Searle|2004|p=276}} The Boers had no problems with mobilisation, since the fiercely independent Boers had no regular army units, apart from the ''Staatsartillerie'' (Afrikaans for 'States Artillery') of both republics. As with the First Boer War, since most of the Boers were members of civilian militias, none had adopted uniforms or insignia. Only the members of the ''Staatsartillerie'' wore light green uniforms.\n\n[[File:Mafikeng Second Boer War.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Boers in a trench at Mafeking, 1899]]\nWhen danger loomed, all the ''burgers'' (citizens) in a district would form a military unit called a ''commando'' and would elect officers. A full-time official titled a ''Veldkornet'' maintained muster rolls, but had no disciplinary powers. Each man brought his own weapon, usually a hunting rifle, and his own horse. Those who could not afford a gun were given one by the authorities.<ref name=\"Andr\u00e9 Wessels 2000 p.80\" /> The Presidents of the Transvaal and Orange Free State simply signed decrees to concentrate within a week and the Commandos could muster between 30,000\u201340,000 men.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pakenham|1979|p=56}}</ref> The average Boer nevertheless was not thirsty for war. Many did not look forward to fighting against fellow Christians and, by and large, fellow Christian Protestants. Many may have had an overly optimistic sense of what the war would involve, imagining that victory could be won as easily as in the First South African War.{{sfn|Wessels|2000|p=74}} Many, including many generals, also had a sense that their cause was holy and just, and blessed by God.{{sfn|Pretorius|2000|p=179}}\n\nIt rapidly became clear that the Boer forces presented the British forces with a severe tactical challenge. What the Boers presented was a mobile and innovative approach to warfare, drawing on their experiences from the First Boer War. The average Boers who made up their Commandos were farmers who had spent almost all their working life in the saddle, both as farmers and hunters. They depended on the pot, horse and rifle; they were also skilled stalkers and marksmen. As hunters they had learned to fire from cover; from a [[Prone position|prone]] position and to make the first shot count, knowing that if they missed, the game would either be long gone or could charge and potentially kill them.\n\nAt community gatherings, target shooting was a major sport; they practised shooting at targets such as hens' eggs perched on posts {{convert|100|m|yd}} away. They made expert mounted infantry, using every scrap of cover, from which they could pour in a destructive fire using modern, smokeless, [[Mauser]] rifles. In preparation for hostilities, the Boers had acquired around one hundred of the latest [[Krupp]] [[8 cm Kanone C/80|field guns]], all horse-drawn and dispersed among the various Kommando groups and several [[Le Creusot]] \"[[155 mm Creusot Long Tom|Long Tom]]\" siege guns. The Boers' skill in adapting themselves to become first-rate artillerymen shows them to have been a versatile adversary.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pakenham|1979|p=30}}</ref> The Transvaal also had an intelligence service that stretched across South Africa and of whose extent and efficiency the British were as yet unaware.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wessels|2000|p=81}}</ref>\n\n=== Boers besiege Ladysmith, Mafeking and Kimberley ===\n[[File:NorthNatalWarTheatre, colour, crop.png|thumb|right|War theatre in northern Natal]]\nThe Boers struck first on 12 October at the [[Battle of Kraaipan]], an attack that heralded the invasion of the [[Cape Colony]] and [[Colony of Natal]] between October 1899 and January 1900. With speed and surprise, the Boer drove quickly towards the British garrison at Ladysmith and the smaller ones at Mafeking and Kimberley. The quick Boer mobilisation resulted in early military successes against scattered British forces. Sir [[George White (British Army officer)|George Stuart White]], commanding the British division at [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]], had unwisely allowed Major-General [[Penn Symons]] to throw a brigade forward to the coal-mining town of Dundee (also reported as Glencoe), which was surrounded by hills. This became the site of the first engagement of the war, the [[Battle of Talana Hill]]. Boer guns began shelling the British camp from the summit of Talana Hill at dawn on 20 October. Penn Symons immediately counter-attacked: his infantry drove the Boers from the hill, for the loss of 446 British casualties, including Penn Symons.\n\nAnother Boer force occupied Elandslaagte, which lay between Ladysmith and Dundee. The British under Major General [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]] and Colonel [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Ian Hamilton]] attacked to clear the line of communications to Dundee. The resulting [[Battle of Elandslaagte]] was a clear-cut British tactical victory, but Sir George White feared that more Boers were about to attack his main position and so ordered a chaotic retreat from Elandslaagte, throwing away any advantage gained. The detachment from Dundee was compelled to make an exhausting cross-country retreat to rejoin White's main force. As Boers surrounded Ladysmith and opened fire on the town with siege guns, White ordered a major sortie against their artillery positions. The result was a disaster, with 140 men killed and over 1,000 captured. The [[Siege of Ladysmith]] began, and was to last several months.\n\nMeanwhile, to the north-west at Mafeking, on the border with Transvaal, Colonel [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] had raised two regiments of local forces amounting to about 1,200 men in order to attack and create diversions if things further south went amiss. Mafeking, being a railway junction, provided good supply facilities and was the obvious place for Baden-Powell to fortify in readiness for such attacks. However, instead of being the aggressor Baden-Powell and Mafeking were forced to defend when 6,000 Boer, commanded by [[Piet Cronj\u00e9]], attempted a determined assault on the town. But this quickly subsided into a desultory affair with the Boers prepared to starve the stronghold into submission, and so, on 13 October, began the 217-day [[Siege of Mafeking]].\n\nLastly, over {{convert|360|km|mi}} to the south of Mafeking lay the diamond mining city of Kimberley, which was also subjected to a [[Siege of Kimberley|siege]]. Although not militarily significant, it nonetheless represented an enclave of British imperialism on the borders of the [[Orange Free State]] and was hence an important Boer objective. From early November about 7,500 Boer began their siege, again content to starve the town into submission. Despite Boer shelling, the 40,000 inhabitants, of which only 5,000 were armed, were under little threat as the town was well-stocked with provisions. The garrison was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel [[Robert Kekewich]], although [[Cecil Rhodes]] was also a prominent figure in the town's defences.\n\nSiege life took its toll on both the defending soldiers and the civilians in the cities of Mafeking, Ladysmith, and Kimberley as food began to grow scarce after a few weeks. In Mafeking, [[Sol Plaatje]] wrote, \"I saw horseflesh for the first time being treated as a human foodstuff.\" The cities under siege also dealt with constant artillery bombardment, making the streets a dangerous place. Near the end of the siege of Kimberley, it was expected that the Boers would intensify their bombardment, so Rhodes displayed a notice encouraging people to go down into shafts of the [[Big Hole|Kimberley Mine]] for protection. The townspeople panicked, and people surged into the mine-shafts constantly for a 12-hour period. Although the bombardment never came, this did nothing to diminish the anxious civilians distress.  The most well-heeled of the townspeople, such as Cecil Rhodes, sheltered in the Sanatorium, site of the present-day [[McGregor Museum]]; the poorer residents, notably the black population, did not have any shelter from the shelling.\n\nIn retrospect, the Boer decision to commit themselves to sieges (''[[Sitzkrieg]]'') was a mistake and one of the best illustrations of the Boers' lack of strategic vision.  Historically, it had little in its favour. Of the seven sieges in the First Boer War, the Boers had won none. More importantly, it handed the initiative back to the British and allowed them time to recover, which they then did.  Generally speaking, throughout the campaign, the Boers were too defensive and passive, wasting the opportunities they had for victory.  Yet that passiveness also testified to the fact that they had no desire to conquer British territory, but only to preserve their ability to rule in their own territory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wessels|2000|pp=82\u201385}}</ref>\n\n=== First British relief attempts ===\n[[File:VCRedversHenryBuller.jpg|thumb|upright|General [[Redvers Henry Buller]] launched an offensive against the Boers in the early phases of the war but after several defeats, culminating at the [[Battle of Colenso]], he was replaced by [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Earl Roberts]].]]\nBy February 1900 General Sir [[Redvers Henry Buller]], a much respected commander, arrived in South Africa with British reinforcements (including an army corps of three infantry divisions and one cavalry division). Buller originally intended an offensive straight up the railway line leading from [[Cape Town]] through [[Bloemfontein]] to [[Pretoria]]. Finding on arrival that the British troops already in South Africa were under siege, he split his army corps into detachments to relieve the besieged garrisons. One division, led by Lieutenant General [[Paul Methuen, 3rd Baron Methuen|Lord Methuen]], was to follow the Western Railway to the north and relieve Kimberley and Mafeking. A smaller force of about 3,000 led by Major General [[William Forbes Gatacre|William Gatacre]], was to push north toward the railway junction at Stormberg, to secure the [[Cape Midlands]] district from Boer raids and local rebellions by Boer inhabitants and Buller led the major part of the army corps to relieve Ladysmith to the east.\n\nThe initial results of this offensive were mixed, with Methuen winning several bloody skirmishes in the [[Battle of Belmont (1899)|Battle of Belmont]] on 23 November, the [[Battle of Graspan]] on 25 November, and at a larger engagement, the [[Battle of Modder River]] on 28 November resulting in British losses of 71 dead and over 400 wounded. British commanders had trained on the lessons of the [[Crimean War]] and were adept at battalion and regimental set pieces with columns manoeuvring in jungles, deserts and mountainous regions. What British generals failed to comprehend was the impact of destructive fire from trench positions and the mobility of cavalry raids. The British troops went to war with what would prove to be antiquated tactics and in some cases antiquated weapons against the mobile Boer forces with the destructive fire of their modern Mausers, the latest Krupp field guns and their novel tactics.<ref>Field Marshal Lord Carver, ''The Boer War'', pp. 259\u201362</ref>\n\nThe middle of December was not\n disastrous for the British Army.  In a period known as [[Black Week]] (10\u201315 December 1899), the British suffered defeats on each of the three fronts.  On 10 December, General Gatacre tried to recapture Stormberg railway junction about {{convert|50|mi|km|order=flip}} south of the [[Orange River]].  Gatacre's attack was marked by administrative and tactical blunders and the [[Battle of Stormberg]] ended in a British defeat, with 135 killed and wounded and two guns and over 600 troops captured.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Magersfontein]] on 11 December, Methuen's 14,000 British troops attempted to capture a Boer position in a dawn attack to relieve Kimberley. This too turned into a disaster when the [[Highland Brigade (Scottish)|Highland Brigade]] became pinned down by accurate Boer fire. After suffering from intense heat and thirst for nine hours, they eventually broke in ill-disciplined retreat. The Boer commanders, [[Koos de la Rey]] and [[Piet Cronj\u00e9]], had ordered [[trench]]es to be dug in an unconventional place to fool the British and to give their riflemen a greater firing range. The plan worked and this tactic helped write the doctrine of the supremacy of the defensive position, using modern small arms and trench fortifications.<ref>'Historical Overview' in Antony O'Brien, ''Bye-Bye Dolly Gray''</ref>{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The British lost 120 killed and 690 wounded and were prevented from relieving Kimberley and Mafeking.

Through a combination of artillery and accurate rifle fire and better use of the ground, the Boers repelled all British attempts to cross the river.  After his first attacks failed, Buller broke off the battle and ordered a retreat, abandoning many wounded men, several isolated units and ten field guns to be captured by Botha's men. Buller's forces lost 145 men killed and 1,200 missing or wounded and the Boers suffered only 40 casualties, including 8 killed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Steele|2000|p=12}}</ref>\n\n== Second phase: The British offensive of January to September 1900 ==\n[[File:British casualties, Spionkop, 1900.jpg|thumb|British casualties lie dead on the battlefield after the [[Battle of Spion Kop]], 24 January 1900.]]\nThe British government took these defeats badly and with the sieges still continuing was compelled to send two more divisions plus large numbers of colonial volunteers. By January 1900 this would become the largest force Britain had ever sent overseas, amounting to some 180,000 men with further reinforcements being sought.\n\nWhile watching for these reinforcements, Buller made another bid to relieve Ladysmith by crossing the Tugela west of [[Colenso, KwaZulu-Natal|Colenso]]. Buller's subordinate, Major General [[Charles Warren]], successfully crossed the river, but was then faced with a fresh defensive position centred on a prominent hill known as Spion Kop. In the resulting [[Battle of Spion Kop]], British troops captured the summit by surprise during the early hours of 24 January 1900, but as the early morning fog lifted they realised too late that they were overlooked by Boer gun emplacements on the surrounding hills. The rest of the day resulted in a disaster caused by poor communication between Buller and his commanders. Between them they issued contradictory orders, on the one hand ordering men off the hill, while other officers ordered fresh reinforcements to defend it. The result was 350 men killed and nearly 1,000 wounded and a retreat across the Tugela River into British territory. There were nearly 300 Boer casualties.\n\nBuller attacked Louis Botha again on 5 February at [[Battle of Vaal Krantz|Vaal Krantz]] and was again defeated. Buller withdrew early when it appeared that the British would be isolated in an exposed bridgehead across the Tugela, for which he was nicknamed \"Sir Reverse\" by some of his officers.\n\n[[File:Peter de wet01.jpg|thumb|left|Boer General Piet de Wet, 1900]]\nBy taking command in person in Natal, Buller had allowed the overall direction of the war to drift. Because of concerns about his performance and negative reports from the field, he was replaced as Commander in Chief by [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Field Marshal Lord Roberts]]. Roberts quickly assembled an entirely new team for headquarters staff and he chose military men from far and wide: [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] (Chief of Staff) from the Sudan; [[Frederick Russell Burnham]] (Chief of Scouts), the American scout, from the Klondike; [[George Francis Robert Henderson|George Henderson]] from the Staff College; [[Neville Bowles Chamberlain]] from Afghanistan; and [[William Nicholson, 1st Baron Nicholson|William Nicholson]] (Military Secretary) from Calcutta.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Like Buller, Roberts first intended to attack directly along the Cape Town\u2013Pretoria railway but, again like Buller, was forced to relieve the beleaguered garrisons. Leaving Buller in command in Natal, Roberts massed his main force near the [[Orange River]] and along the Western Railway behind Methuen's force at the [[Modder River]], and prepared to make a wide outflanking move to relieve Kimberley.\n\n[[File:Inniskillings al colle di Hart.jpg|thumb|Siege of Ladysmith]]\nExcept in Natal, the war had stagnated. Other than a single attempt to storm Ladysmith, the Boers made no attempt to capture the besieged towns. In the Cape Midlands, the Boers did not exploit the British defeat at Stormberg, and were prevented from capturing the railway junction at [[Colesberg]]. In the dry summer, the grazing on the veld became parched, weakening the Boers' horses and draught oxen, and many Boer families joined their menfolk in the siege lines and ''laagers'' (encampments), fatally encumbering Cronj\u00e9's army.\n\nRoberts launched his main attack on 10 February 1900 and although hampered by a long supply route, managed to outflank the Boers defending [[Magersfontein]]. On 14 February, a cavalry division under Major General [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]] launched a major attack to relieve Kimberley. Although encountering severe fire, a massed cavalry charge split the Boer defences on 15 February, opening the way for French to enter Kimberley that evening, ending its 124 days' siege.\n\nMeanwhile, Roberts pursued Piet Cronj\u00e9's 7,000-strong force, which had abandoned Magersfontein to head for Bloemfontein. General French's cavalry was ordered to assist in the pursuit by embarking on an epic {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} drive towards Paardeberg where Cronj\u00e9 was attempting to cross the Modder River. At the [[Battle of Paardeberg]] from 18 to 27 February, Roberts then surrounded General [[Piet Cronj\u00e9]]'s retreating Boer army. On 17 February, a pincer movement involving both French's cavalry and the main British force attempted to take the entrenched position, but the frontal attacks were uncoordinated and so were easily repulsed by the Boers. Finally, Roberts resorted to bombarding Cronj\u00e9 into submission, but it took a further ten precious days, and with the British troops using the polluted Modder River as water supply, there was a typhoid epidemic killing many troops. General Cronj\u00e9 was forced to surrender at [[Surrender Hill]] with 4,000 men.\n\n[[File:The Relief of Ladysmith by John Henry Frederick Bacon.jpg|thumb|The Relief of Ladysmith. Sir [[George White (British Army officer)|George Stuart White]] greets Major [[Hubert Gough]] on 28 February. Painting by [[John Henry Frederick Bacon]] (1868\u20131914).]]\nIn Natal, the [[Battle of the Tugela Heights]], which started on 14 February was Buller's fourth attempt to relieve Ladysmith. The losses Buller's troops had sustained convinced Buller to adopt Boer tactics \"in the firing line\u2014to advance in small rushes, covered by rifle fire from behind; to use the tactical support of artillery; and above all, to use the ground, making rock and earth work for them as it did for the enemy.\" Despite reinforcements his progress was painfully slow against stiff opposition. However, on 26 February, after much deliberation, Buller used all his forces in one all-out attack for the first time and at last succeeded in forcing a crossing of the Tugela to defeat Botha's outnumbered forces north of Colenso. After a siege lasting 118 days, the [[Relief of Ladysmith]] was effected, the day after Cronj\u00e9 surrendered, but at a total cost of 7,000 British casualties. Buller's troops marched into Ladysmith on 28 February.{{sfn|Pakenham|1991a|p=573}}\n\nAfter a succession of defeats, the Boers realised that against such overwhelming numbers of troops, they had little chance of defeating the British and so became demoralised. Roberts then advanced into the Orange Free State from the west, putting the Boers to flight at the [[Battle of Poplar Grove]] and capturing [[Bloemfontein]], the capital, unopposed on 13 March with the Boer defenders escaping and scattering. Meanwhile, he detached a small force to relieve Baden-Powell. The [[Relief of Mafeking]] on 18 May 1900 provoked riotous celebrations in Britain, the origin of the Edwardian slang word \"mafficking\".  On 28 May, the Orange Free State was annexed and renamed the Orange River Colony.\n\nAfter being forced to delay for several weeks at Bloemfontein by a shortage of supplies, an outbreak of [[Typhoid fever|enteric (typhoid) fever]] caused by poor hygiene, drinking bad drinking water at Paardeburg, and appalling medical care, Roberts finally resumed his advance.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Paterson|first=Andrew Barton|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/From_the_Front.html?id=vEV1AAAAMAAJ|title=From the Front: Dispatches from the Boer War|publisher=[[Pan Macmillan]]|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7329-1062-4|editor-last=Droogleever|editor-first=R.

The first into Pretoria was Lt. William Watson of the New South Wales Mounted Rifles, who persuaded the Boers to surrender the capital.{{sfn|Wilcox|2002|pp=84-85}} Before the war, the Boers had constructed several forts south of Pretoria, but the artillery had been removed from the forts for use in the field, and in the event they abandoned Pretoria without a fight. Having won the principal cities, Roberts declared the war over on 3 September 1900; and the South African Republic was formally annexed.\n\nBritish observers believed the war to be all but over after the capture of the two capital cities. However, the Boers had earlier met at the temporary new capital of the Orange Free State, [[Kroonstad]], and planned a guerrilla campaign to hit the British supply and communication lines. The first engagement of this new form of warfare was at [[Sanna's Post]] on 31 March where 1,500 Boers under the command of [[Christiaan De Wet|Christiaan de Wet]] attacked Bloemfontein's waterworks about {{convert|23|mi|km|order=flip}} east of the city, and ambushed a heavily escorted convoy, which caused 155 British casualties and the capture of seven guns, 117 wagons, and 428 British troops.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Speed, Neil G.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61567917|title=Born to fight : Major Charles Joseph Ross DSO, a definitive study of his life|date=2002|publisher=Caps & Flints Press|isbn=0-9581356-0-6|location=Melbourne|oclc=61567917}}</ref>\n\n[[File:PACronje CHM VA2863.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Piet Cronj\u00e9]] as a prisoner of war in Saint Helena, 1900\u201302. He was captured, with 4,000 men, after the loss of the [[Battle of Paardeberg]].]]\nAfter the fall of Pretoria, one of the last formal battles was at [[Battle of Diamond Hill|Diamond Hill]] on 11\u201312 June, where Roberts attempted to drive the remnants of the Boer field army under Botha beyond striking distance of Pretoria. Although Roberts drove the Boers from the hill, Botha did not regard it as a defeat, for he inflicted 162 casualties on the British while suffering only around 50 casualties.\n\nThe set-piece period of the war now largely gave way to a mobile guerrilla war, but one final operation remained. President Kruger and what remained of the Transvaal government had retreated to eastern Transvaal. Roberts, joined by troops from Natal under Buller, advanced against them, and broke their last defensive position at [[Battle of Bergendal|Bergendal]] on 26 August. As Roberts and Buller followed up along the railway line to [[Komatipoort]], Kruger sought asylum in Portuguese East Africa (modern [[Mozambique]]). Some dispirited Boers did likewise, and the British gathered up much war material. However, the core of the Boer fighters under Botha easily broke back through the [[Drakensberg]] Mountains into the Transvaal highveld after riding north through the bushveld. Under the new conditions of the war, heavy equipment was no use to them, and therefore no great loss.\n\nAs Roberts's army occupied Pretoria, the Boer fighters in the Orange Free State retreated into the Brandwater Basin, a fertile area in the north-east of the Republic. This offered only temporary sanctuary, as the mountain passes leading to it could be occupied by the British, trapping the Boers. A force under General [[Archibald Hunter]] set out from Bloemfontein to achieve this in July 1900. The hard core of the Free State Boers under De Wet, accompanied by President Steyn, left the basin early. Those remaining fell into confusion and most failed to break out before Hunter trapped them. 4,500 Boers surrendered and much equipment was captured but as with Roberts's drive against Kruger at the same time, these losses were of relatively little consequence, as the hard core of the Boer armies and their most determined and active leaders remained at large.\n\nFrom the Basin, Christiaan de Wet headed west. Although hounded by British columns, he succeeded in crossing the Vaal into western Transvaal, to allow Steyn to travel to meet their leaders.  There was much sympathy for the Boers on mainland Europe. In October, President Kruger and members of the Transvaal government left Portuguese East Africa on the Dutch warship ''[[De Gelderland]]'', sent by the Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]]. Paul Kruger's wife, however, was too ill to travel and remained in South Africa where she died on 20 July 1901 without seeing her husband again. President Kruger first went to Marseille and then on to the Netherlands, where he stayed for a while before moving finally to [[Clarens, Switzerland]], where he died in exile on 14 July 1904.\n\n=== POWs sent overseas ===\nThe first sizeable batch of Boer prisoners of war taken by the British consisted of those captured at the [[Battle of Elandslaagte]] on 21 October 1899. At first, many were put on ships, but as numbers grew, the British decided they did not want them kept locally. The capture of 400 POWs in February 1900 was a key event, which made the British realise they could not accommodate all POWs in South Africa.<ref name=\"collint\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boerwarsociety.org/Interests.cfm|title=Anglo-Boer War Philatelic Society: Collecting Interests|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210040529/http://www.boerwarsociety.org/Interests.cfm|archivedate=10 December 2005|access-date=}}</ref> The British feared they could be freed by sympathetic locals. Moreover, they already had trouble supplying their own troops in South Africa, and did not want the added burden of sending supplies for the POWs.

However, they soon discovered that they only controlled the territory their columns physically occupied. Despite the loss of their two capital cities and half of their army, the Boer commanders adopted [[guerrilla warfare]] tactics, primarily conducting raids against railways, resource and supply targets, all aimed at disrupting the operational capacity of the British Army. They avoided pitched battles and casualties were light.\n\nEach Boer commando unit was sent to the district from which its members had been recruited, which meant that they could rely on local support and personal knowledge of the terrain and the towns within the district thereby enabling them to live off the land. Their orders were simply to act against the British whenever possible. Their tactics were to strike fast and hard causing as much damage to the enemy as possible, and then to withdraw and vanish before enemy reinforcements could arrive. The vast distances of the Republics allowed the Boer commandos considerable freedom to move about and made it nearly impossible for the 250,000 British troops to control the territory effectively using columns alone. As soon as a British column left a town or district, British control of that area faded away.\n[[File:BoerWarBlockHouse SouthAfrica.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A surviving [[blockhouse]] in South Africa. Blockhouses were constructed by the British to secure supply routes from Boer raids during the war.]]\n\nThe Boer commandos were especially effective during the initial guerrilla phase of the war because Roberts had assumed that the war would end with the capture of the Boer capitals and the dispersal of the main Boer armies. Many British troops were therefore redeployed out of the area, and had been replaced by lower-quality contingents of [[Imperial Yeomanry]] and locally raised irregular corps.\n\nFrom late May 1900, the first successes of the Boer guerrilla strategy were at Lindley (where 500 Yeomanry surrendered), and at Heilbron (where a large convoy and its escort were captured) and other skirmishes resulting in 1,500 British casualties in less than ten days. In December 1900, De la Rey and [[Christiaan Beyers]] attacked and mauled a British brigade at [[Battle of Nooitgedacht|Nooitgedacht]]. As a result of these and other Boer successes, the British, led by Lord Kitchener, mounted three extensive searches for [[Christiaan de Wet]], but without success. However, the very nature of the Boer guerrilla war and the Boer raids on British camps were sporadic, poorly planned, and had little overall long-term objective, with the exception to simply harass the British. This led to a disorganised pattern of scattered engagements between the British and the Boers throughout the region.\n\n===British response===<!-- This section is linked from [[Blockhouse]] -->\nThe British were forced to quickly revise their tactics. They concentrated on restricting the freedom of movement of the Boer commandos and depriving them of local support. The railway lines had provided vital lines of communication and supply, and as the British had advanced across South Africa, they had used [[armoured train]]s and had established fortified [[blockhouses]] at key points.<ref name=\"Jones\" /> They now built additional blockhouses (each housing 6\u20138 soldiers) and fortified these to protect supply routes against Boer [[raid (military)|raiders]]. Eventually some 8,000 such blockhouses were built across the two South African republics, radiating from the larger towns along principal routes. Each blockhouse cost between \u00a3800 to \u00a31,000 and took about three months to build. However, they proved very effective. Not one bridge where one of these blockhouses was sited and manned was blown.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nThe blockhouse system required an enormous number of troops to garrison. Well over 50,000 British troops, or 50 battalions, were involved in blockhouse duty, greater than the approximately 30,000 Boers in the field during the guerrilla phase. In addition, up to 16,000 Africans were used both as armed guards and to patrol the line at night.<ref name=\"Jones\">{{harvnb|Jones|1996}}</ref> The Army linked the blockhouses with barbed wire fences to parcel up the wide veld into smaller areas. \"New Model\" drives were mounted under which a continuous line of troops could sweep an area of veld bounded by blockhouse lines, unlike the earlier inefficient scouring of the countryside by scattered columns.\n\n[[File:VerskroeideAarde1.jpg|thumb|left|One British response to the guerrilla war was a '[[scorched earth]]' policy to deny the guerrillas supplies and refuge. In this image [[Boer]] civilians watch their house as it is burned.]]\nThe British also implemented a \"[[scorched earth]]\" policy under which they targeted everything within the controlled areas that could give sustenance to the Boer guerrillas with a view to making it harder for the Boers to survive. As British troops swept the countryside, they systematically destroyed crops, burned homesteads and farms and interned Boer and African men, women, children and workers in concentration camps. Finally, the British also established their own mounted raiding columns in support of the sweeper columns. These were used to rapidly follow and relentlessly harass the Boers with a view to delaying them and cutting off escape, while the sweeper units caught up. Many of the 90 or so mobile columns formed by the British to participate in such drives were a mixture of British and colonial troops, but they also had a large minority of armed Africans. The total number of armed Africans serving with these columns has been estimated at approximately 20,000.\n\nThe British Army also made use of Boer auxiliaries who had been persuaded to change sides and enlist as \"National Scouts\". Serving under the command of General Andries Cronj\u00e9, the National Scouts were despised as ''joiners'' but came to number a fifth of the fighting Afrikaners by the end of the War.{{sfn|Pakenham|1991|p=571}}\n\nThe British utilised armoured trains throughout the War to deliver rapid reaction forces much more quickly to incidents (such as Boer attacks on blockhouses and columns) or to drop them off ahead of retreating Boer columns.\n\n=== Peace committees ===\nAmong those Burghers who had stopped fighting, it was decided to form peace committees to persuade those who were still fighting to desist. In December 1900 Lord Kitchener gave permission that a central Burgher Peace Committee be inaugurated in Pretoria. By the end of 1900 some thirty envoys were sent out to the various districts to form local peace committees to persuade burghers to give up the fight. Previous leaders of the Boers, like Generals Piet de Wet and Andries Cronj\u00e9 were involved in the organisation. [[Meyer de Kock]] was the only emissary of a peace committee to be convicted of high treason and executed by firing squad.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=140}}\n\n=== Joiners ===\nSome burghers joined the British in their fight against the Boers. By the end of hostilities in May 1902, there were no fewer than 5,464 burghers working for the British.{{sfn|Ploeger1985|pp=15\u201322}}\n\n=== Orange Free State ===\n[[File:Christiaan de Wet.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Christiaan De Wet]] was the most formidable leader of the Boer guerrillas. He successfully evaded capture on numerous occasions and was later involved in the negotiations for a peace settlement.]]\nAfter having conferred with the Transvaal leaders, [[Christiaan de Wet]] returned to the Orange Free State, where he inspired a series of successful attacks and raids from the hitherto quiet western part of the country, though he suffered a rare defeat at [[Battle of Bothaville|Bothaville]] in November 1900. Many Boers who had earlier returned to their farms, sometimes giving formal parole to the British, took up arms again. In late January 1901, De Wet led a renewed invasion of [[Cape Colony]]. This was less successful, because there was no general uprising among the Cape Boers, and De Wet's men were hampered by bad weather and relentlessly pursued by British forces. They narrowly escaped across the [[Orange River]].\n\nFrom then until the final days of the war, De Wet remained comparatively quiet, partly because the Orange Free State was effectively left desolate by British sweeps. In late 1901, De Wet overran an isolated British detachment at [[Battle of Groenkop|Groenkop]], inflicting heavy casualties. This prompted Kitchener to launch the first of the \"New Model\" drives against him. De Wet escaped the first such drive, but lost 300 of his fighters. This was a severe loss, and a portent of further attrition, although the subsequent attempts to round up De Wet were badly handled, and De Wet's forces avoided capture.\n\n=== Western Transvaal ===\nThe Boer commandos in the Western Transvaal were very active after September 1901. Several battles of importance were fought here between September 1901 and March 1902. At Moedwil on 30 September 1901 and again at Driefontein on 24 October, General [[Koos De La Rey]]'s forces attacked the British, but were forced to withdraw after the British offered strong resistance.\n\nA time of relative quiet descended thereafter on the western Transvaal. February 1902 saw the next major battle in that region. On 25 February, [[Koos De La Rey]] attacked a British column under Lieutenant-Colonel [[Stanley Brenton von Donop|S. B. von Donop]] at Ysterspruit near [[Wolmaransstad]]. De La Rey succeeded in capturing many men and a large amount of ammunition. The Boer attacks prompted Lord Methuen, the British second-in-command after [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], to move his column from Vryburg to Klerksdorp to deal with De La Rey. On the morning of 7 March 1902, the Boers attacked the rear guard of Methuen's moving column at [[Battle of Tweebosch|Tweebosch]]. Confusion reigned in British ranks and Methuen was wounded and captured by the Boers.\n\nThe Boer victories in the west led to stronger action by the British. In the second half of March 1902, large British reinforcements were sent to the Western Transvaal under the direction of Ian Hamilton. The opportunity the British were waiting for arose on 11 April 1902 at [[Battle of Rooiwal|Rooiwal]], where a commando led by General [[Jan Kemp (South African)|Jan Kemp]] and Commandant Potgieter attacked a superior force under Kekewich. The British soldiers were well positioned on the hillside and inflicted severe casualties on the Boers charging on horseback over a large distance, beating them back. This was the end of the war in the Western Transvaal and also the last major battle of the war.\n\n=== Eastern Transvaal ===\n[[File:Afrikaner Commandos2.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Boer Commando|Boer commandos]]]]\nTwo Boer forces fought in this area, one under Botha in the south east and a second under Ben Viljoen in the north east around Lydenburg. Botha's forces were particularly active, raiding railways and British supply convoys, and even mounting a renewed invasion of Natal in September 1901. After defeating British mounted infantry in the [[Battle of Blood River Poort]] near [[Dundee, KwaZulu-Natal|Dundee]], Botha was forced to withdraw by heavy rains that made movement difficult and crippled his horses. Back on the Transvaal territory around his home district of Vryheid, Botha attacked a British raiding column at [[Battle of Bakenlaagte|Bakenlaagte]], using an effective mounted charge. One of the most active British units was effectively destroyed in this engagement. This made Botha's forces the target of increasingly large and ruthless drives by British forces, in which the British made particular use of native scouts and informers. Eventually, Botha had to abandon the high veld and retreat to a narrow enclave bordering [[Swaziland]].\n\nTo the north, Ben Viljoen grew steadily less active. His forces mounted comparatively few attacks and as a result, the Boer enclave around [[Lydenburg]] was largely unmolested. Viljoen was eventually captured.\n\n=== Cape Colony ===\nIn parts of Cape Colony, particularly the Cape Midlands district where Boers formed a majority of the white inhabitants, the British had always feared a general uprising against them. In fact, no such uprising took place, even in the early days of the war when Boer armies had advanced across the Orange. The cautious conduct of some of the elderly Orange Free State generals had been one factor that discouraged the Cape Boers from siding with the Boer republics. Nevertheless, there was widespread pro-Boer sympathy.  Some of the Cape Dutch volunteered to help the British, but a much larger number volunteered to help the other side. The political factor was more important than the military: the Cape Dutch controlled the provincial legislature. Milner said 90 percent favoured the rebels.{{sfn|Marsh|1994|pages=483\u201385}}\n\nAfter he escaped across the Orange in March 1901, [[Christiaan de Wet]] had left forces under Cape rebels [[Pieter Hendrik Kritzinger|Kritzinger]] and Scheepers to maintain a guerrilla campaign in the Cape Midlands. The campaign here was one of the least chivalrous of the war, with intimidation by both sides of each other's civilian sympathizers. In one of many skirmishes, Commandant Lotter's small commando was tracked down by a much-superior British column and wiped out at [[Battle of Groenkloof|Groenkloof]]. Several captured rebels, including Lotter and Scheepers, who was captured when he fell ill with appendicitis, were executed by the British for treason or for capital crimes such as the murder of prisoners or of unarmed civilians. Some of the executions took place in public, to deter further disaffection. Since the Cape Colony was Imperial territory, its authorities forbade the British Army to burn farms or to force Boers into concentration camps.\n\nFresh Boer forces under [[Jan Christiaan Smuts]], joined by the surviving rebels under Kritzinger, made another attack on the Cape in September 1901. They suffered severe hardships and were hard pressed by British columns, but eventually rescued themselves by routing some of their pursuers at the [[Battle of Elands River (1901)|Battle of Elands River]] and capturing their equipment. From then until the end of the war, Smuts increased his forces from among Cape rebels until they numbered 3,000. However, no general uprising took place, and the situation in the Cape remained stalemated.\n\nIn January 1902, Boer leader [[Manie Maritz]] was implicated in the [[Leliefontein massacre]] in the far [[Northern Cape]].\n\n=== Boer foreign volunteers ===\n{{Main|Boer foreign volunteers}}\nWhile no other government actively supported the Boer cause, individuals from several countries volunteered and formed Foreign Volunteer Units. These primarily came from [[Europe]], particularly the [[Netherlands]], [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Sweden-Norway]]. Other countries such as [[French Fourth Republic|France]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Ireland]] (then wholly part of the United Kingdom), and restive areas of the [[Russian Empire]], including [[Poland]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], also formed smaller volunteer corps. Finns fought in the Scandinavian Corps. Two volunteers, [[George Henri Anne-Marie Victor de Villebois-Mareuil]] of France and [[Yevgeny Maximov]] of Russia became ''veggeneraals'' (fighting generals) of the South African Republic.{{sfn|Davidson & Filatova|1998|p=80}}\n\n== Nonwhite roles ==\nThe policy on both sides was to minimise the role of nonwhites but the need for manpower continuously stretched those resolves.  At the battle of Spion Kop in Ladysmith, Mahatma Gandhi with 300 free burgher Indians and 800 indentured Indian labourers started the Ambulance Corps serving the British side.  As the war raged across African farms and their homes were destroyed, many became refugees and they, like the Boers, moved to the towns where the British hastily created internment camps. Subsequently, the \"Scorched Earth\" policy was ruthlessly applied to both Boers and Africans. Although most black Africans were not considered by the British to be hostile, many tens of thousands were also forcibly removed from Boer areas and also placed in concentration camps. Africans were held separately from Boer internees. Eventually there were a total of 64 tented camps for Africans. Conditions were as bad as in the camps for the Boers, but even though, after the Fawcett Commission report, conditions improved in the Boer camps, \"improvements were much slower in coming to the black camps.\" 20,000 died there.{{sfn|Warwick|1983|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}\n\nAbout 10,000 black men were attached to Boer units where they performed camp duties; a handful unofficially fought in combat.  The British Army employed over 14,000 Africans as wagon drivers. Even more had combatant roles as spies, guides, and eventually as soldiers. By 1902 there were about 30,000 armed Africans in the British Army.{{sfn|Pretorius|2011|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}\n\n== Concentration camps ==\n{{Main|British concentration camps}}\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-215-94-Derivative01.jpg|thumb|Tents in the [[Bloemfontein]] concentration camp]]\n\nThe term \"[[concentration camp]]\" was used to describe camps operated by the British in South Africa during this conflict in the years 1900\u20131902, and the term grew in prominence during this period.\n\nThe camps had originally been set up by the British Army as \"[[refugee camps]]\" to provide refuge for civilian families who had been forced to abandon their homes for whatever reason related to the war. However, when Kitchener took over in late 1900, he introduced new tactics in an attempt to break the [[Boer Commando|guerrilla campaign]] and the influx of civilians grew dramatically as a result.

This was not the first appearance of internment camps, as the Spanish had used internment in Cuba in the [[Ten Years' War]], but the Boer War concentration camp system was the first time that a whole nation had been systematically targeted, and the first in which whole regions had been depopulated.\n\nEventually, there were a total of 45 tented camps built for Boer internees and 64 for black Africans. Of the 28,000 Boer men captured as [[prisoners of war]], 25,630 were sent overseas and either freed or enslaved within civil societies. The vast majority of Boers remaining in the local camps were women and children. Over 27,000 women and children were to perish in these concentration camps.{{sfn|Wessels|2010|p=32}}\n\nThe camps were poorly administered from the outset and became increasingly overcrowded when Kitchener's troops implemented the internment strategy on a vast scale. Conditions were terrible for the health of the internees, mainly due to neglect, poor hygiene and bad sanitation. The supply of all items was unreliable, partly because of the constant disruption of communication lines by the Boers. The food [[ration]]s were meager and there was a two-tier allocation policy, whereby families of men who were still fighting were routinely given smaller rations than others.{{sfn|Pakenham|1979|p=505}} The inadequate shelter, poor diet, bad hygiene and overcrowding led to malnutrition and endemic contagious diseases such as [[measles]], [[typhoid]], and [[dysentery]], to which the children were particularly vulnerable. {{sfn|Judd|Surridge|2013|p=195}} Coupled with a shortage of modern medical facilities, many of the internees died. [[Emily Hobhouse]] was instrumental in bringing relief to the concentration camps, as well as raising public awareness in Europe of the atrocities.\n\n== The end of the war ==\n[[File:Resa del bacino del Brandewater.jpg|thumb|The end result of the Boer War was the [[annexation]] of the [[Boer Republics]] to the British Empire in 1902]]\n[[File:Kitchener at the Peace Conference that ended the Second Boer War.png|thumb|Peace conference at Vereeniging]]\n[[File:Company C returns from Boer War.jpg|thumb|C Company returns from Boer War, pictured here in [[King Street (Toronto)|King Street]], [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada.]]\nTowards the end of the war, British tactics of containment, denial, and harassment began to yield results against the guerrillas. The sourcing and co-ordination of intelligence became increasingly efficient with regular reporting from observers in the [[blockhouses]], from units patrolling the fences and conducting \"sweeper\" operations, and from native Africans in rural areas who increasingly supplied intelligence, as the [[Scorched Earth]] policy took effect and they found themselves competing with the Boers for food supplies. Kitchener's forces at last began to seriously affect the Boers' fighting strength and freedom of manoeuvre, and made it harder for the Boers and their families to survive. Despite this success, almost half the Boer fighting strength, 15,000 men were still in the field fighting. Kitchener's tactics were very costly: Britain was running out of time and money and needed to change tack.{{sfn|O'Brien|1988|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}\n\nThe Boers and the British both feared the consequences of arming Africans. The memories of the Zulu and other tribal conflicts were still fresh, and they recognised that whoever won would have to deal with the consequences of a mass militarisation of the tribes. There was therefore an unwritten agreement that this war would be a \"white man's war.\" At the outset, British officials instructed all white magistrates in the Natal Colony to appeal to Zulu amakhosi (chiefs) to remain neutral, and President Kruger sent emissaries asking them to stay out of it. However, in some cases there were old scores to be settled, and some Africans, such as the [[Swazi people|Swazis]], were eager to enter the war with the specific aim of reclaiming land won by the Boers. As the war went on there was greater involvement of Africans, and in particular large numbers became embroiled in the conflict on the British side, either voluntarily or involuntarily. By the end of the war, many blacks had been armed and had shown conspicuous gallantry in roles such as scouts, messengers, watchmen in blockhouses, and auxiliaries.\n\nAnd there were more flash-points outside of the war. On 6 May 1902 at Holkrantz in the southeastern Transvaal, a Zulu faction had their cattle stolen and their people mistreated by the Boers as a punishment for helping the British. The local Boer officer then sent an insulting message to the tribe, challenging them to take back their cattle. The Zulus attacked at night, and in a mutual bloodbath, the Boers lost 56 killed and 3 wounded, while the Africans suffered 52 killed and 48 wounded.{{sfn|Pakenham|1979|p=601}}\n\nThe British offered terms of peace on various occasions, notably in March 1901, but were rejected by Botha and the \"Bitter-enders\" among the commandos. They pledged to fight until the bitter end and rejected the demand for compromise made by the \"Hands-uppers.\"  Their reasons included hatred of the British, loyalty to their dead comrades, solidarity with fellow commandos, an intense desire for independence, religious arguments, and fear of captivity or punishment. On the other hand, their women and children were dying every day and independence seemed impossible.{{sfn|Grundlingh|1980|pp=258\u201378}} The last of the Boers surrendered in May 1902 and the war ended with the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] signed on 31 May 1902. The British had won and offered generous terms to regain the support of the Boers.The Boers were given \u00a33,000,000 for reconstruction and were promised eventual limited self-government, which was granted in 1906 and 1907. The treaty ended the existence of the [[South African Republic]] and the [[Orange Free State]] as independent Boer republics and placed them within the [[British Empire]]. The [[Union of South Africa]] was established as a [[dominion]] of the [[British Empire]] in 1910.\n\n=== Cost of the war ===\nIt is estimated that the total cost of the war to the British government was \u00a3211,156,000<ref name=\"CostofWar\">{{harvnb|''Cost of the war''|loc={{Unreliable source?|date=February 2017}} }}</ref> (equivalent to \u00a3202,000,000,000 in 2014).{{sfn|Measuringworth|2015}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 0 1.0em 1.0em; text-align:right; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#ccf;\"| Cost of War over its entire course\n|-\n!

The predominantly agrarian society of the former [[Boer]] republics was profoundly and fundamentally affected by the [[scorched earth]] policy of Roberts and Kitchener. The devastation of both Boer and black African populations in the concentration camps and through war and exile were to have a lasting effect on the demography and quality of life in the region. Many exiles and prisoners were unable to return to their farms at all; others attempted to do so but were forced to abandon the farms as unworkable given the damage caused by farm burning in the course of the scorched earth policy. Destitute Boers and black Africans swelled the ranks of the unskilled urban poor competing with the \"uitlanders\" in the mines.{{sfn|Onselen|1982|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}\n\nThe postwar reconstruction administration was presided over by [[Lord Milner]] and his largely Oxford trained [[Milner's Kindergarten]]. This small group of civil servants had a profound effect on the region, eventually leading to the [[Union of South Africa]].\n{{quote|In the aftermath of the war, an imperial administration freed from accountability to a domestic electorate set about reconstructing an economy that was by then predicated unambiguously on gold. At the same time, British civil servants, municipal officials, and their cultural adjuncts were hard at work in the heartland of the former [[Boer]] Republics helping to forge new identities\u2014first as 'British South Africans' and then, later still, as 'white South Africans'.\"}}\n\nSome scholars, for good reasons, identify these new identities as partly underpinning the act of union that followed in 1910.

He was involved from the start of the war and had a role in the peace process and the creation of the [[Union of South Africa]].]]\nThe counterinsurgency techniques and lessons (the restriction of movement, the containment of space, the ruthless targeting of anything, everything and anyone that could give sustenance to guerrillas, the relentless harassment through sweeper groups coupled with rapid reaction forces, the sourcing and co-ordination of intelligence, and the nurturing of native allies) learned during the Boer War were used by the British (and other forces) in future guerrilla campaigns including to counter [[Federation of Malaya|Malayan]] communist rebels during the [[Malayan Emergency]]. In World War II the British also adopted some of the concepts of raiding from the Boer commandos when, after the [[Battle of France|fall of France]], they set up their special raiding forces, and in acknowledgement of their erstwhile enemies, chose the name [[British Commandos]].\n\nMany of the Boers referred to the war as the second of the ''Freedom Wars''. The most resistant of Boers wanted to continue the fight and were known as \"''[[Bittereinder]]s''\" (or ''irreconcilables'') and at the end of the war a number of Boer fighters such as [[Deneys Reitz]] chose exile rather than sign an oath, such as the following, to pledge allegiance to Britain:{{sfn|Swardt|1998|p=97}}\n{{Quote box|width=50%|align=none|quote=The bearer, ''&lt;prisoner name&gt;'' has been released from prison of war camp ''&lt;Camp name&gt;'' on signing that he acknowledge terms of surrender and becomes a British subject.\n}}\nOver the following decade, many returned to South Africa and never signed the pledge. Some, like Reitz, eventually reconciled themselves to the new ''status quo'', but others could not.\n\n=== Union of South Africa ===\n{{Main|Union of South Africa}}\nOne of the most important events in the decade after the end of the war was the creation of the [[Union of South Africa]] (later the [[Republic of South Africa]]). It proved a key ally to Britain as a [[British Dominions|Dominion]] of the [[British Empire]] during the World Wars. At the start of the First World War a crisis ensued when the South African government led by [[Louis Botha]] and other former Boer fighters, such as [[Jan Smuts]], declared support for Britain and agreed to send troops to take over the German colony of [[German South-West Africa]] (Namibia).\n\nMany Boers were opposed to fighting for Britain, especially against Germany, which had been sympathetic to their struggle. A number of ''bittereinders'' and their allies took part in a revolt known as the [[Maritz Rebellion]]. This was quickly suppressed, and in 1916 the leading Boer rebels in the Maritz Rebellion got off lightly (especially compared with the fate of leading Irish rebels of the [[Easter Rising#Men executed for their role in the Easter Rising|Easter Rising]]), with terms of imprisonment of six and seven years and heavy fines. Two years later, they were released from prison, as Louis Botha recognised the value of reconciliation. Thereafter the ''bittereinders'' concentrated on political organisation within the constitutional system and built up what later became the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], which took power in 1948 and dominated the politics of South Africa from the late 1940s until the early 1990s, under the [[apartheid]] system.\n\n=== Effect of the war on domestic British politics ===\n{{further|Opposition to the Second Boer War}}\n[[File:Dublin St. Patrick's Cathedral North Transept Window King Cormac of Cashel Detail Irish Royal Regiment 2012 09 26.jpg|thumb|Memorial window from [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]] by [[An T\u00far Gloine]]. Much of the Irish public sympathised with the Boer side, rather than the British side on which fought the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1684\u20131922)|Royal Irish Regiment]].]]\nMany [[Irish nationalist]]s sympathised with the Boers, viewing them to be a people oppressed by British [[imperialism]], much like themselves. Irish miners already in the Transvaal at the start of the war formed the nucleus of two [[Irish commandos]]. The Second Irish Brigade was headed up by an Australian of Irish parents, Colonel [[Arthur Lynch (politician)|Arthur Lynch]]. In addition, small groups of Irish volunteers went to South Africa to fight with the Boers\u2014this despite the fact that there were many Irish troops fighting in the British army, including the [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers]].{{efn|\"Although some 30,000 Irishmen served in the British Army under Irish General Lord Frederick Roberts, who had been Commander of Chief of British Forces in Ireland prior to his transfer to South Africa, some historians argue that the sympathies of many of their compatriots lay with the Boers.

Chesterton]]'s writing to 1905 \u2013 (see [[Rice University]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20000605083501/http://www.cs.rice.edu:80/~ssiyer/minstrels/poems/228.html Chesterton's poetry analysis)]}} with writers often idealising the Boer society.\n\nThe war also highlighted the dangers of Britain's policy of non-alignment and deepened her isolation. The [[1900 United Kingdom general election|1900 UK general election]], also known as the \"[[Khaki election]]\", was called by the Prime Minister, [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], on the back of recent British victories. There was much enthusiasm for the war at this point, resulting in a victory for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government.\n\nHowever, public support quickly waned as it became apparent that the war would not be easy and it dragged on, partially contributing to [[1906 United Kingdom general election|the Conservatives' spectacular defeat in 1906]]. There was public outrage at the use of [[scorched earth]] tactics\u2014the forced clearance of men, women and children, the destruction of the countryside, burning of Boer homesteads for example\u2014and the conditions in the concentration camps. It also became apparent that there were serious problems with public health in Britain: up to 40% of recruits in Britain were unfit for [[conscription|military service]], suffering from medical problems such as [[rickets]] and other poverty-related illnesses. This came at a time of increasing concern for the state of the poor in Britain.\n\nHaving taken the country into a prolonged war, the Conservative government was rejected by the electorate at the first general election after the war was over.  Balfour, succeeding his uncle Lord Salisbury in 1903 immediately after the war, took over a Conservative party that had won two successive landslide majorities but led it to a landslide defeat in 1906.\n\n=== Horses ===\n[[File:Horses on board ship - a guide to their management-page69.jpg|thumb|A horse destined to serve in the war, being off-loaded in [[Port Elizabeth]]]]\nThe number of horses killed in the war was at the time unprecedented in modern warfare. For example, in the [[Siege of Kimberley|Relief of Kimberley]], French's cavalry rode 500 horses to their deaths in a single day. The wastage was particularly heavy among British forces for several reasons: overloading of horses with unnecessary equipment and saddlery, failure to rest and acclimatise horses after long sea voyages and, later in the war, poor management by inexperienced mounted troops and distant control by unsympathetic staffs.{{sfn|McElwee|1974|pp=223\u201329}} The average life expectancy of a British horse, from the time of its arrival in Port Elizabeth, was around six weeks.{{sfn|Hayes|1902|pp=213\u201314}}\n\nHorses were slaughtered for their meat when needed.

These countries had their own internal disputes over whether they should remain tied to London, or have full independence, which carried over into the debate around the sending of forces to assist the war. Though not fully independent on foreign affairs, these countries did have local say over how much support to provide, and the manner it was provided. Ultimately, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and British South African Company administered Rhodesia all sent volunteers to aid the United Kingdom. Canada provided the largest number of troops followed by Australia. Troops were also raised to fight with the British from the [[Cape Colony]] and the [[Colony of Natal]]. Some Boer fighters, such as [[Jan Smuts]] and Louis Botha, were technically British subjects as they came from the Cape Colony and Colony of Natal, respectively.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nThere were also many volunteers from the Empire who were not selected for the official contingents from their countries and travelled privately to South Africa to form private units, such as the Canadian Scouts and Doyle's Australian Scouts. There were also some European volunteer units from [[British Raj|British India]] and [[British Ceylon]], though the British Government refused offers of non-white troops from the Empire. Some [[Cape Coloureds]] also volunteered early in the war, but later some of them were effectively conscripted and kept in segregated units. As a community, they received comparatively little reward for their services. In many ways, the war set the pattern for the Empire's later involvement in the two [[World war|World Wars]]. Specially raised units, consisting mainly of volunteers, were dispatched overseas to serve with forces from elsewhere in the British Empire.\n\nThe United States stayed neutral in the conflict, but some American citizens were eager to participate. Early in the war Lord Roberts cabled the American [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], a veteran of both Matabele wars but at that very moment prospecting in the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Klondike]], to serve on his personal staff as Chief of Scouts. Burnham went on to receive the highest awards of any American who served in the war, but American mercenaries participated on both sides.{{sfn|Farwell|1976}}\n\n=== Australia ===\n\n{{See also|History of the Australian Army#Boer War 1899\u20131902}}\n{{Main|Military history of Australia during the Second Boer War}}\n[[File:Boer War officers P03206.001.jpg|thumb|left|British and Australian officers in South Africa, {{circa|1900}}]]\n\nFrom 1899 to 1901 the six separate [[self-governing colony|self-governing colonies]] in Australia sent their own contingents to serve in the Boer War.

As the war dragged on some Australians became disenchanted, in part because of the sufferings of Boer civilians reported in the press. In an interesting twist (for Australians), when the British missed capturing President Paul Kruger, as he escaped Pretoria during its fall in June 1900, a ''[[Melbourne Punch]]'', 21 June 1900, cartoon depicted how the War could be won, using the [[Kelly Gang]].{{sfn|Wilcox|2002|p=103}}\n\nThe convictions and executions of two Australian lieutenants, [[Breaker Morant|Harry Harbord Morant]], colloquially known as 'The Breaker' for his skill with horses, and [[Peter Handcock]] in 1902, and the imprisonment of a third, [[George Witton]], had little impact on the Australian public at the time despite later legend. The controversial [[court-martial]] saw the three convicted of executing [[Boer]] prisoners under their authority. After the war, though, Australians joined an empire-wide campaign that saw Witton released from jail.

The first part (October 1899 \u2013 December 1899) was characterised by questionable decisions and blunders from the Commonwealth leadership which affected its soldiers greatly. The soldiers of the Commonwealth were shocked at the number of Afrikaner soldiers who were willing to oppose the British. The Afrikaner troops were very willing to fight for their country, and were armed with modern weaponry and were highly mobile soldiers.<ref name=\"South African War\" /> This was one of the best examples of [[Guerrilla]] style warfare, which would be employed throughout the twentieth century after [[Set piece battle|set piece fighting]] was seen as a hindrance by certain groups.{{sfn|Webb|2010|pp=75\u201390}} The Boer soldiers would evade capture and secure provisions from their enemies therefore they were able to exist as a fighting entity for an indeterminate period of time.<ref name=\"The Guerrilla War\">{{cite web|title=The Guerrilla War|url=http://www.anglo-boer.co.za/intro/the-guerrilla-war.php|work=Anglo-Boer War Museum}}</ref>\n\nThe end of the First part was the period in mid-December, referred to as the \"Black Week\". During the week of 10\u201317 December 1899, the British suffered three major defeats at the hands of the Boers at the battlefields of Stormberg, Magersfontein and Colenso. Afterwards, the British called upon more volunteers to take part in the war from the Commonwealth.<ref name=\"Black Week\">{{cite web|last=Rickard|first=J.|title=The Black Week|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/concepts_black_week.html|work=History of War}}</ref>\n\nThe second part of the war (February\u2013April 1900) was the opposite of the first. After the British reorganised and reinforced under new leadership, they began to experience success against the Boer soldiers. [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] soldiers resorted to using blockhouses, farm burning and concentration camps to 'persuade' the resisting Boers into submission.<ref name=\"History of the Boer War\">{{cite web|title=Canada & The South African War, 1899\u20131902|url=http://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/boer/boerwarhistory_e.shtml|work=Canadian War Museum}}</ref>\n\nThe final phase of the war was the guerrilla phase in which many Boer soldiers turned to guerrilla tactics such as raiding infrastructure or communications lines. Many Canadian soldiers did not actually see combat after they had been shipped over to South Africa since many arrived around the time of the signing of the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] on 31 May 1902.<ref name=\"The Peace of Vereeniging\">{{cite web|last=Cavendish|first=Richard|title=The Peace of Vereeniging|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/peace-vereeniging|work=History Today}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Notable Canadian Engagements\n|-\n!

Over 800 Canadian soldiers from Otter's 2nd Special Service Battalion were attached to the British attack force. This was the first major attack involving the Canadians in the Boer War, as well as the first major victory for Commonwealth soldiers. The Canadian soldiers perched on a hill above the Boer camp and were credited with being the main reason that the Boers under General Cronj\u00e9 surrendered.{{sfn|Granatstein|2010|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|Zand River\n|On 6 May 1900, the Commonwealth's northwards advance to the capital of Pretoria was well on its way. However, the British soldiers encountered a position of Boer soldiers on the Zand River. The British commander felt that the best course of action was to use cavalry to envelop the Boers on their left flank and infantry would therefore march on the Boer right flank to secure a crossing. The Canadian 2nd Battalion was the lead unit advancing on the right flank. However, due to disease and casualties from earlier encounters, the 2nd battalion was reduced to approximately half of its initial strength. The Canadian battalion came under fire from the Boers who were occupying protected positions. The battle continued for several hours until the British cavalry was able to flank the Boers and force a retreat. Canadian casualties were two killed and two wounded. The skirmishes around the Zand River would continue and more soldiers from various Commonwealth countries would become involved.{{sfn|O'Leary|1999}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|[[Doornkop]]\n|On the days of 28\u201329 May 1900, both the Canadian 2nd battalion and the 1st Mounted Infantry Brigade fought together on the same battlefield for the first, and only, time.

There were large communities of English-speaking immigrants and settlers in [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] and [[Cape Colony]] (especially around [[Cape Town]] and [[Grahamstown]]), which formed volunteer units that took the field, or local \"town guards.\" At one stage of the war, a \"Colonial Division,\" consisting of five light horse and infantry units under Brigadier General [[Edward Brabant]], took part in the invasion of the [[Orange Free State]]. Part of it withstood a siege by Christiaan de Wet at [[Wepener]] on the borders of [[Lesotho|Basutoland]]. Another large source of volunteers was the ''[[uitlander]]'' community, many of whom hastily left [[Johannesburg]] in the days immediately preceding the war.\n\n[[File:Rhodesians leaving Salisbury for Boer War.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rhodesia (region)|Rhodesian]] volunteers leaving [[Harare|Salisbury]] for service in the Second Boer War, 1899]]\nLater during the war, [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] attempted to form a Boer Police Force, as part of his efforts to pacify the occupied areas and effect a reconciliation with the Boer community. The members of this force were despised as traitors by the Boers still in the field. Those Boers who attempted to remain neutral after giving their parole to British forces were derided as ''\"hensoppers\"'' (hands-uppers) and were often coerced into giving support to the Boer guerrillas. (This was one of the reasons for the British ruthlessly scouring the countryside of people, livestock and anything else the Boer commandos might find useful.)\n\nLike the Canadian and particularly the Australian and New Zealand contingents, many of the volunteer units formed by South Africans were \"[[light cavalry|light horse]]\" or [[mounted infantry]], well suited to the countryside and manner of warfare. Some regular British officers scorned their comparative lack of formal discipline, but the light horse units were hardier and more suited to the demands of campaigning than the overloaded British cavalry, who were still obsessed with the charge by lance or sabre.{{efn| British cavalry travelled light compared with earlier campaigns, but were still expected to carry all kit with them on campaign owing to distances covered on the Veldt.}} At their peak, 24,000 South Africans (including volunteers from the Empire) served in the field in various \"colonial\" units.

Douglas (1899, Magersfontein) and Lieutenant W.H.S. Nickerson (1900, Wakkerstroom).<ref name=\"History of the Boer War\" /> Not all soldiers saw action since many landed in South Africa after the hostilities ended while others (including the 3rd Special Service Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment) performed garrison duty in Halifax, Nova Scotia so that their British counterparts could join at the front lines. Later on, contingents of Canadians served with the paramilitary South Africa Constabulary. Both sides used a [[scorched Earth]] policy to deprive the marching enemy of food.  And both had to corral civilians into makeshift huts by 'concentrating them camps.<ref name=\"South African War\" /> For example, at [[Buffelspoort]], British soldiers were held in captivity in Boer encampments after surrendering their arms, and civilians were often mixed in with service personnel because the Boer did not have the resources to do otherwise.  A total of 116,000 women, children and Boer soldiers were confined to the Commonwealth concentration camps, of which at least 28,000, mainly women and children, would die.{{sfn|Pulsifer|2017}} The lack of food, water, and sanitary provisions was a feature of 20th-century warfare for both civilians and armed services personnel, yet one consequence of the Boer War and investigative commissions was the implementation of The Hague Convention (1899) and Geneva Convention (1904); of which there were many further agreements thereafter.\n\n=== Views on British tactics ===\nThe British saw their tactics of [[Scorched Earth]] and [[concentration camp]]s as ways of controlling the Boers by \"eliminating the decay and deterioration of the national character\" and as a way of reinforcing the values, through subjugation of citizens and the destruction of the means for the Boer soldiers to continue fighting, of British society that the Boers were rejecting by engaging in a war against the Commonwealth.{{sfn|Berger|1970|pp=233\u201334}} The Boers saw them as a British ploy designed to coerce the Boer soldiers into a surrender.

It is also known variously as the '''Boer War''', '''Anglo-Boer War''', or '''South African War'''. Initial Boer attacks were successful, and although British reinforcements later reversed these, the war continued for years with Boer [[guerrilla warfare]], until harsh British counter-measures brought the Boers to terms.\n\nThe war started with the British overconfident and under-prepared.<ref name=\"millard\">{{cite book|last1=Millard|first1=Candice|title=Hero of the Empire: The Boer War, a daring escape, and the making of Winston Churchill|date=2016|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=978-0-385-53573-1}}</ref> The Boers were well armed and struck first, besieging [[Siege of Ladysmith|Ladysmith]], [[Siege of Kimberley|Kimberley]], and [[Siege of Mafeking|Mafeking]] in early 1900, and winning important battles at [[Battle of Colenso|Colenso]], [[Battle of Magersfontein|Magersfontein]] and [[Battle of Stormberg|Stormberg]]. Staggered, the British brought in large numbers of soldiers and fought back. [[Redvers Buller|General Redvers Buller]] was replaced by [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] and [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]. They relieved the three besieged cities, and invaded the two Boer republics in late 1900. The onward marches of the [[British Army]], well over 400,000 men, were so overwhelming that the Boers did not fight staged battles in defence of their homeland.\n\nThe British army seized control of all of the Orange Free State and Transvaal, as the civilian leadership went into hiding or exile. In conventional terms, the war was over. The British officially annexed the two countries in 1900. Back home, Britain's Conservative government wanted to capitalize on this success and use it to maneuver an early general election, dubbed a \"[[khaki election]]\", to give the government another six years of power in London.<ref name=\"bristolmercury\">{{cite web |last1=Biggins |first1=David |title=Khaki Election of 1900 |url=https://www.angloboerwar.com/forum/8-events/8709-khaki-election-of-1900 |website=angloboerwar.com |accessdate=November 27, 2018}}</ref> British military efforts were aided by [[Cape Colony]], the [[Colony of Natal]] and some native African allies, and further supported by volunteers from the [[British Empire]], including [[southern Africa]], the Australian colonies, Canada, [[British Raj|India]] and New Zealand. All other nations were neutral, but international opinion was largely hostile to the British.<ref>See [[Opposition to the Second Boer War#Among neutrals]]</ref> Inside the British Empire there also was significant [[opposition to the Second Boer War]].\n\nThe Boers refused to surrender. They reverted to guerrilla warfare under new generals [[Louis Botha]], [[Jan Smuts]], [[Christiaan de Wet]] and [[Koos de la Rey]]. Two years of surprise attacks and quick escapes followed. As guerrillas without uniforms, the Boer fighters easily blended into the farmlands, which provided hiding places, supplies, and horses.\n\nThe British response to guerrilla warfare was to set up complex nets of [[blockhouse]]s, [[strongpoint]]s, and barbed wire fences, partitioning off the entire conquered territory. In addition, civilian farms and livestock were destroyed as part of a [[scorched earth]] policy. Survivors were forced into [[British concentration camps|concentration camps]]. Very large proportions of these civilians died of hunger and disease, especially the children.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/women-children-white-concentration-camps-during-anglo-boer-war-1900-1902|title=Women & Children in White Concentration Camps during the Anglo-Boer War, 1900\u20131902|date=2011-03-21|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>\n\nBritish mounted infantry units systematically tracked down the highly mobile Boer guerrilla units. The battles at this stage were small operations. Few died during combat, though many of disease. The war ended when the Boer leadership surrendered and accepted British terms with the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] in May 1902.  Both former republics were incorporated into the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910, as part of the British Empire.\n\n== Name ==\nThe conflict is commonly referred to as the Boer War, since the [[First Boer War]] (December 1880 to March 1881) was a much smaller conflict. \"[[Boer]]\" (meaning farmer) is the common term for [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]-speaking [[white South African]]s descended from the [[Dutch East India Company]]'s original settlers at the [[Cape of Good Hope]].  It is also known as the (Second) Anglo-Boer War among some South Africans. In Afrikaans it may be called the ''Anglo-Boereoorlog'' (\"Anglo-Boer War\"), ''Tweede Boereoorlog'' (\"Second Boer War\"), ''Tweede Vryheidsoorlog'' (\"Second Freedom War\") or ''Engelse oorlog'' (\"English War\").{{sfn|Gronum|1977}}\n\nIn [[South Africa]] it is officially called the South African War.{{sfn|''South African History Online''|2011}} In fact, according to a 2011 [[BBC]] report, \"most scholars prefer to call the war of 1899\u20131902 the South African War, thereby acknowledging that all South Africans, white and black, were affected by the war and that many were participants\".<ref name=\"bbc01\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/victorians/boer_wars_01.shtml|title=History \u2013 The Boer Wars|last=Pretorius|first=Fransjohan|date=2008-03-18|website=[[BBC]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200407234451/https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/victorians/boer_wars_01.shtml|archive-date=7 April 2020|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\nThe origins of the war were complex and stemmed from more than a century of conflict between the Boers and Britain.

After Britain annexed Natal in 1843, they journeyed further northwards into South Africa's vast eastern interior. There they established two independent Boer republics: the South African Republic (1852; also known as the Transvaal Republic) and the Orange Free State (1854). Britain recognised the two Boer republics in 1852 and 1854, but attempted British annexation of the Transvaal in 1877 led to the [[First Boer War]] in 1880\u201381. After Britain suffered defeats, particularly at the [[Battle of Majuba Hill]] (1881), the independence of the two republics was restored subject to certain conditions; relations, however, remained uneasy.\n\nIn 1866 diamonds were discovered at [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], prompting a [[diamond rush]] and a massive influx of foreigners to the borders of the Orange Free State. Then in 1886, gold was discovered in the Witwatersrand area of the South African Republic. Gold made the Transvaal the richest nation in southern Africa; however, the country had neither the manpower nor the industrial base to develop the resource on its own. As a result, the Transvaal reluctantly acquiesced to the immigration of ''[[uitlander]]s'' (foreigners), mainly English-speaking men from Britain, who came to the Boer region in search of fortune and employment. This resulted in the number of uitlanders in the Transvaal potentially exceeding the number of Boers, and precipitated confrontations between the earlier-arrived Boer settlers and the newer, non-Boer arrivals.\n\nBritain's expansionist ideas (notably propagated by [[Cecil Rhodes]]) as well as disputes over uitlander political and economic rights resulted in the failed [[Jameson Raid]] of 1895. Dr. [[Leander Starr Jameson]], who led the raid, intended to encourage an uprising of the uitlanders in [[Johannesburg]]. However, the uitlanders did not take up arms in support, and Transvaal government forces surrounded the column and captured Jameson's men before they could reach Johannesburg.{{sfn|Pakenham|1979|pp=1\u20135}}\n\nAs tensions escalated, political manoeuvrings and negotiations attempted to reach compromise on the issues of the rights of the uitlanders within the South African Republic, control of the gold mining industry, and Britain's desire to incorporate the Transvaal and the Orange Free State into a federation under British control. Given the British origins of the majority of uitlanders and the ongoing influx of new uitlanders into Johannesburg, the Boers recognised that granting full voting rights to the uitlanders would eventually result in the loss of ethnic Boer control in the South African Republic.\n\nThe June 1899 [[Bloemfontein Conference|negotiations in Bloemfontein]] failed, and in September 1899 British [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] [[Joseph Chamberlain]] demanded full voting rights and representation for the uitlanders residing in the Transvaal. [[Paul Kruger]], the President of the South African Republic, issued an ultimatum on 9 October 1899, giving the British government 48 hours to withdraw all their troops from the borders of both the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, albeit Kruger had ordered [[Boer Commando|Commandos]] to the Natal border in early September and Britain only had troops in garrison towns far from the border,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/15699/15699-h/15699-h.htm|title=A Handbook of the Boer War|publisher=[[Gale and Polden]]|year=1910|isbn=978-1-37-497455-5|location=[[London]]|pages=|orig-year=}}</ref> failing which the Transvaal, allied to the Orange Free State, would declare war on the British government.

In the first phase, the Boers mounted preemptive strikes into British-held territory in Natal and the Cape Colony, besieging the British garrisons of [[Siege of Ladysmith|Ladysmith]], [[Siege of Mafeking|Mafeking]], and [[Siege of Kimberley|Kimberley]]. The Boers then won a series of tactical victories at [[Battle of Stormberg|Stormberg]], [[Battle of Magersfontein|Magersfontein]], [[Battle of Colenso|Colenso]] and [[Battle of Spion Kop|Spion Kop]].\n\nIn the second phase, after the number of British troops was greatly increased under the command of [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]], the British launched another offensive in 1900 to relieve the sieges, this time achieving success. After Natal and the Cape Colony were secure, the British army was able to invade the Transvaal, and the republic's capital, [[Pretoria]], was ultimately captured in June 1900.\n\nIn the third and final phase, beginning in March 1900 and lasting a further two years, the Boers conducted a hard-fought guerrilla war, attacking British troop columns, telegraph sites, railways, and storage depots. To deny supplies to the Boer guerrillas, the British, now under the leadership of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], adopted a [[scorched earth]] policy. They cleared whole areas, destroying Boer farms and moving the civilians into concentration camps.{{sfn|Pakenham|1979|pp=493\u201395}}\n\nSome parts of the British press and British government expected the campaign to be over within months, and the protracted war gradually became less popular, especially after revelations about the conditions in the concentration camps (where as many as 26,000 Afrikaner women and children died of disease and malnutrition). The Boer forces finally surrendered on Saturday, 31 May 1902, with 54 of the 60 delegates from the Transvaal and Orange Free State voting to accept the terms of the peace treaty.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wessels|2000|p=97}}</ref> This was known as the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]], and under its provisions, the two republics were absorbed into the British Empire, with the promise of self-government in the future. This promise was fulfilled with the creation of the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910.\n\nThe war had a lasting effect on the region and on British domestic politics. For Britain, the Second Boer War was the longest, the most expensive (\u00a3211&nbsp;million, \u00a3202&nbsp;billion at 2014 prices), and the bloodiest conflict between 1815 and 1914,<ref>{{Harvnb|Pakenham|1979|p=xv}}</ref> lasting three months longer and resulting in more British combat casualties than the [[Crimean War]] (1853\u201356), although more soldiers died from disease in the Crimean War.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:British Empire in 1898.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Extent of the British Empire in 1898, prior to the outbreak of the Second Boer War]]\n[[File:SouthAfrica1885.svg|thumb|270px|The geography of the region in 1885, between the [[First Boer War|First]] and Second Boer Wars]]\nThe southern part of the African continent was dominated in the 19th century by a set of struggles to create within it a single unified state. While the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u201385 sought to draw boundaries between the European powers' African possessions, it also set the stage for further scrambles. Britain attempted to annex first the South African Republic in 1880, and then, in 1899, both the South African Republic and the Orange Free State. In 1868, Britain annexed [[History of Lesotho|Basutoland]] in the [[Drakensberg]] Mountains following an appeal from [[Moshesh]], the leader of a mixed group of African refugees from the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] wars, who sought British protection against the Boers.\n\nIn the 1880s, Bechuanaland (modern [[Botswana]], located north of the Orange River) became the object of a dispute between the Germans to the west, the Boers to the east, and Britain's [[Cape Colony]] to the south. Although Bechuanaland had no economic value, the \"Missionaries Road\" passed through it towards territory farther north. After the Germans annexed [[Damaraland]] and Namaqualand (modern [[Namibia]]) in 1884, Britain annexed Bechuanaland in 1885.\n\nIn the [[First Boer War]] of 1880\u201381 the Boers of the Transvaal Republic had proved skilful fighters in resisting Britain's attempt at annexation, causing a series of British defeats. The British government of [[William Ewart Gladstone]] had been unwilling to become mired in a distant war, requiring substantial troop reinforcement and expense, for what was at the time perceived to be a minimal return. An armistice followed, ending the war, and subsequently a peace treaty was signed with the Transvaal President [[Paul Kruger]].\n\nIn 1886, when a big gold field was discovered at an outcrop on a large ridge some {{convert|69|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the Boer capital at [[Pretoria]], it reignited British imperial interests. The ridge, known locally as the \"[[Witwatersrand]]\" (white water ridge, a watershed) contained the world's largest deposit of gold-bearing ore. With the 1886 discovery of gold in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], a [[gold rush]] brought thousands of British and other prospectors and settlers from across the globe and over the border from the [[Cape Colony]] (under British control since 1806).\n\nThe city of [[Johannesburg]] sprang up as a [[shanty town]] nearly overnight as the ''[[uitlanders]]'' (foreigners, white outsiders) poured in and settled around the mines. The influx was such that the uitlanders quickly outnumbered the [[Boer]]s in Johannesburg and along the Rand, although they remained a minority in the Transvaal. The Boers, nervous and resentful of the uitlanders' growing presence, sought to contain their influence through requiring lengthy residential qualifying periods before voting rights could be obtained, by imposing taxes on the gold industry and by introducing controls through licensing, tariffs and administrative requirements. Among the issues giving rise to tension between the Transvaal government on the one hand and the uitlanders and British interests on the other, were\n* Established uitlanders, including the mining magnates, wanted political, social, and economic control over their lives. These rights included a stable constitution, a fair franchise law, an independent judiciary and a better educational system. The Boers, for their part, recognised that the more concessions they made to the uitlanders the greater the likelihood\u2014with approximately 30,000 white male Boer voters and potentially 60,000 white male uitlanders\u2014that their independent control of the Transvaal would be lost and the territory absorbed into the British Empire.\n* The uitlanders resented the taxes levied by the Transvaal government, particularly when this money was not spent on Johannesburg or uitlander interests, but diverted to projects elsewhere in the Transvaal. For example, as the gold-bearing ore sloped away from the outcrop underground to the south, more and more blasting was necessary for extraction, and mines consumed vast quantities of explosives. A box of dynamite costing five pounds included five shillings tax. Not only was this tax perceived as exorbitant, but British interests were offended when President [[Paul Kruger]] gave monopoly rights for the manufacture of the explosive to a non-British branch of the Nobel company, which infuriated Britain.{{sfn|Cartwright|1964|p={{Page needed|date=July 2010}} }} The so-called \"dynamite monopoly\" became a [[casus belli]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1.0em 1.0em; text-align:right; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#ccf;\"| Gold Production on the Witwatersrand <br /> 1898 to 1910{{sfn|Yap|Leong Man|1996 |p=134}}\n|-\n| '''Year''' || '''No. of <br />Mines''' || '''Gold output<br />(fine ounces)''' || '''Value ([[Pound sterling|GB\u00a3]])''' || '''Relative 2010<br /> value ([[Pound sterling|GB\u00a3]])<ref>{{harvnb|Measuringworth|2015}}, Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount \u2013 average earnings, retrieved on 27 January 2011</ref>'''\n|-\n| 1898 || 77 || 4,295,608 || \u00a315,141,376 || \u00a36,910,000,000\n|-\n| 1899<br /> (Jan\u2013Oct) || 85 || 3,946,545 || \u00a314,046,686 || \u00a36,300,000,000\n|-\n| 1899<br /> (Nov) \u2013 1901 (Apr)|| 12 || 574,043 || \u00a32,024,278 || \u00a3908,000,000\n|-\n| 1901<br /> (May\u2013Dec) || 12 || 238,994 || \u00a31,014,687 || \u00a3441,000,000\n|-\n| 1902 || 45 || 1,690,100 || \u00a37,179,074 || \u00a33,090,000,000\n|-\n| 1903 || 56 || 2,859,482 || \u00a312,146,307 || \u00a35,220,000,000\n|-\n| 1904 || 62 || 3,658,241 || \u00a315,539,219 || \u00a36,640,000,000\n|-\n| 1905 || 68 || 4,706,433 || \u00a319,991,658 || \u00a38,490,000,000\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"5\" style=\"color:#900;\"|\n|}\n\nBritish imperial interests were alarmed when in 1894\u201395 Kruger proposed building a railway through [[Portuguese East Africa]] to [[Maputo Bay|Delagoa Bay]], bypassing British-controlled ports in Natal and Cape Town and avoiding British tariffs.{{sfn|Nathan|1941|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }} At the time the Prime Minister of the Cape Colony was [[Cecil Rhodes]], a man driven by a vision of a British-controlled Africa extending from [[Cape to Cairo Road|Cape to Cairo]]. Certain self-appointed ''uitlanders'' representatives and British mine owners became increasingly angered and frustrated by their dealings with the Transvaal government. A Reform Committee (Transvaal) was formed to represent the uitlanders.\n\n=== Jameson Raid ===\n{{Main|Jameson Raid}}\n[[File:Leander Starr Jameson00.jpg|thumb|A sketch showing the arrest of [[Jameson Raid|Jameson]] after the failed raid, in 1896]]\n\nIn 1895, a plan was hatched with the connivance of the Cape Prime Minister [[Cecil Rhodes]] and Johannesburg gold magnate [[Alfred Beit]] to take [[Johannesburg]], ending the control of the Transvaal government. A column of 600 armed men (mainly made up of his [[Rhodesia (name)|Rhodesian]] and [[Bechuanaland]] [[British South Africa Police]]men) was led by Dr. [[Leander Starr Jameson]] (the Administrator [[Company rule in Rhodesia|in Rhodesia]] of the [[British South Africa Company]] (or Chartered Company) of which Cecil Rhodes was the chairman) over the border from Bechuanaland towards Johannesburg. The column was equipped with Maxim machine guns and some artillery pieces.\n\nThe plan was to make a three-day dash to Johannesburg and trigger an uprising by the primarily British expatriate workers (uitlanders) organised by the [[Johannesburg Reform Committee|Reform Committee]] before the [[Boer commando]]s could mobilise. The Transvaal authorities had advance warning of the [[Jameson Raid]] and tracked it from the moment it crossed the border. Four days later, the weary and dispirited column was surrounded near [[Krugersdorp]] within sight of Johannesburg. After a brief skirmish in which the column lost 65 killed and wounded\u2014while the Boers lost but one man\u2014Jameson's men surrendered and were arrested by the Boers.{{sfn|Pakenham|1979|pp=1\u20135}}\n\nThe botched raid resulted in repercussions throughout southern Africa and in Europe. In Rhodesia, the departure of so many policemen enabled the [[Northern Ndebele people|Matabele]] and [[Shona people|Mashona]] peoples to rise up against the Chartered Company, and the rebellion, known as the [[Second Matabele War]], was suppressed only at great cost.\n\nA few days after the raid, the German Kaiser sent the [[Kruger telegram]] congratulating President Kruger and the government of the South African Republic on their success. When the text of this telegram was disclosed in the British press, it generated a storm of anti-German feeling. In the baggage of the raiding column, to the great embarrassment of Britain, the Boers found telegrams from Cecil Rhodes and the other plotters in Johannesburg. [[Joseph Chamberlain]], the British Colonial Secretary, quickly moved to condemn the raid, despite having approved Rhodes' plans to send armed assistance in the case of a Johannesburg uprising. Rhodes was severely censured at the Cape inquiry and the London parliamentary inquiry and forced to resign as Prime Minister of the Cape and as Chairman of the Chartered Company, for having sponsored the failed ''coup d'\u00e9tat''.\n\nThe Boer government handed their prisoners over to the British for trial. Jameson was tried in England for leading the raid where the British press and London society inflamed by anti-Boer and anti-German feeling and in a frenzy of jingoism, lionised Jameson and treated him as a hero. Although sentenced to 15 months imprisonment (which he served in [[Holloway (HM Prison)|Holloway]]), Jameson was later rewarded by being named Prime Minister of the Cape Colony (1904\u201308) and ultimately anointed as one of the founders of the Union of South Africa. For conspiring with Jameson, the uitlander members of the Reform Committee (Transvaal) were tried in the Transvaal courts and found guilty of high treason. The four leaders were sentenced to death by hanging but this sentence was next day commuted to 15 years' imprisonment. In June 1896, the other members of the Committee were released on payment of \u00a32,000 each in fines, all of which were paid by Cecil Rhodes. One Reform Committee member, Frederick Gray, had committed suicide while in Pretoria [[gaol]], on 16 May, and his death was a factor in softening the Transvaal government's attitude to the remaining prisoners.\n\nJan C. Smuts wrote in 1906,\n\n{{quote|The Jameson Raid was the real declaration of war&nbsp;... And that is so in spite of the four years of truce that followed&nbsp;... [the] aggressors consolidated their alliance&nbsp;... the defenders on the other hand silently and grimly prepared for the inevitable\".{{sfn|Pakenham|1979|p=9|date=February 2017}} }}\n\n=== Escalation and war ===\nThe Jameson Raid alienated many Cape Afrikaners from Britain and united the Transvaal Boers behind President Kruger and his government. It also had the effect of drawing the Transvaal and the [[Orange Free State]] (led by President [[Martinus Theunis Steyn]]) together in opposition to perceived British imperialism. In 1897, a military pact was concluded between the two republics.\n\n==== Arming the Boers ====\nIn earlier conflicts, the Boers's most common weapon was the Westley Richards, falling-block, breech-loader. A book about the war (J. Lehmann's  ''The First Boer War'', 1972)  offered this comment: \"Employing chiefly the very fine breech-loading Westley Richards \u2013 calibre 45; paper cartridge; percussion-cap replaced on the nipple manually \u2013 they made it exceedingly dangerous for the British to expose themselves on the skyline\".<ref>{{cite web | last=Machanik | first=Felix | title=Firearms and Firepower \u2013 First War of Independence, 1880\u20131881 \u2013 Journal | website=South African Military History Society | url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol052fm.html | access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>\n[[File:KrugerPaulusJohannes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Kruger]], leader of the [[South African Republic]] (Transvaal)]]\n[[File:Rifle, bolt action (AM 1930.61-17).jpg|thumb|Mauser 1895 bolt-action rifle (at the Auckland Museum)]]\nPresident [[Paul Kruger]] re-equipped the Transvaal army, importing 37,000 of the latest 7x57 mm [[Mauser Model 1895]] rifles,<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2016/6/1/the-guns-of-the-boer-commandos/|title=The Guns of the Boer Commandos|last=Smith-Christmas|first=Kenneth L.|date=2016-06-01|website=American Rifleman|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314072227/https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2016/6/1/the-guns-of-the-boer-commandos/|archive-date=14 March 2020|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref> and some 40 to 50&nbsp;million rounds of ammunition.<ref>{{harvnb|Bester|1994|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}; {{Harvnb|Wessels|2000|p=80}}.</ref> Some commandos used the [[Martini-Henry]] Mark III, since thousands of these had also been purchased; the drawback was the large puff of white smoke after firing which gave away the shooter's position.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web | last=Scarlata | first=Paul | title=6 Rifles Used by the Afrikaners During the Second Boer War | website=Tactical Life Gun Magazine | date=2017-04-17 | url=https://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/second-boer-war-rifles/ | access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Pretorius|first=Fransjohan|title=Life on Commando during the Anglo-Boer War 1899\u20131902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WfovAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA81|year=1999|publisher=Human & Rousseau|isbn=978-0-7981-3808-6|page=81}}</ref> Roughly 7,000 Guedes 1885 rifles had also been purchased a few years earlier, and these were also used during the hostilities.<ref name=\"auto1\" />\n\nAs the war went on, some commandos relied on captured British rifles such as the [[Lee-Metford]] and the [[Lee\u2013Enfield|Enfield]].<ref name=\"auto2\" /><ref name=bbc01 /> In fact, when the ammunition for the Mausers ran out, the Boers relied primarily on the captured Lee-Metfords.<ref>{{cite book|last=Muller|first=C.

President Kruger's victory in the Jameson Raid incident did nothing to resolve the fundamental problem of finding a formula to conciliate the uitlanders, without surrendering the independence of the Transvaal.\n\n==== British case for war ====\nThe failure to gain improved rights for uitlanders became a pretext for war and a justification for a big military buildup in Cape Colony. The case for war was developed and espoused as far away as the Australian colonies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Connolly|first=C.

Confident that the Boers would be quickly defeated, they planned and organised a short war, citing the uitlanders' grievances as the motivation for the conflict.\n\nThe influence of the war party with the British government was limited. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], the Prime Minister, despised [[jingoism]] and jingoists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.me.uk/lordsalisbury.html|title=Lord Salisbury|last=Crowhurst|first=Peter|date=|website=www.britishempire.me.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> He also distrusted the abilities of the British Army. Yet he led Britain into war because he believed the British government had an obligation to British South Africans, because he thought that the Transvaal, the Orange Free State, and the Cape Boers aspired to a Dutch South Africa and that the achievement of such a state would damage British imperial prestige and because of the Boers treatment of black South Africans (Salisbury had referred to the [[London Convention (1884)|London Convention of 1884]], after the British defeat, as an agreement 'really in the interest of slavery').<ref>{{Harvnb|Steele|2000|p=7}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Steele|2000|p=6}}</ref> Salisbury was not alone in this concern over the treatment of black South Africans; [[Roger Casement]], already well on the way to becoming an Irish Nationalist, was nevertheless happy to gather intelligence for the British against the Boers because of their cruelty to Africans.<ref>{{harvnb|Jeffery|2000|p=145}} cites {{harvnb|Inglis|1974|pp=53\u201355}}</ref>\n\nGiven this sense of caution among members of the British cabinet and of the army, it is even harder to understand why the British government went against the advice of its generals (such as Wolseley) to send substantial reinforcements to South Africa before war broke out. Lansdowne, Secretary of State for War, did not believe the Boers were preparing for war and also believed that if Britain were to send large numbers of troops, it would strike too aggressive a posture and so prevent a negotiated settlement being reached or even encourage a Boer attack.{{sfn|Surridge|2000|p=24}}\n\n==== Negotiations fail ====\nPresident Steyn of the Orange Free State invited Milner and Kruger to attend a conference in [[Bloemfontein]]. The conference started on 30 May 1899 but negotiations quickly broke down, despite Kruger's offer of concessions. In September 1899, Chamberlain sent an ultimatum demanding full equality for British citizens resident in Transvaal. Kruger, seeing that war was inevitable, simultaneously issued his own ultimatum prior to receiving Chamberlain's. This gave Britain 48 hours to withdraw all their troops from the border of Transvaal or the Transvaal, allied with the Orange Free State, would declare war.\n\nNews of the ultimatum reached London on the day it expired. Outrage and laughter were the main responses. The editor of the ''Times'' laughed out loud when he read it, saying 'an official document is seldom amusing and useful yet this was both'. ''The Times'' denounced the ultimatum as an 'extravagant farce' and ''The Globe'' denounced this 'trumpery little state'. Most editorials were similar to the ''Daily Telegraph'', which declared: 'of course there can only be one answer to this grotesque challenge. Kruger has asked for war and war he must have!'\n\nSuch views were far from those of the British government and from those in the army. To most sensible observers, army reform had been a matter of pressing concern from the 1870s, constantly put off because the British public did not want the expense of a larger, more professional army and because a large home army was not politically welcome. Lord Salisbury, the Prime Minister, then had to explain to a surprised Queen Victoria that 'We have no army capable of meeting even a second-class Continental Power'.<ref>{{Harvnb|Steele|2000|p=4}}</ref>\n\nWhen war with the Boer Republics was imminent in September 1899, a Field Force, referred to as the Army Corps (sometimes 1st Army Corps) was mobilised and sent to Cape Town. It was \"about the equivalent of the [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Army Corps]] of the existing mobilization scheme\" and was placed under the command of Gen Sir [[Redvers Buller]], GOC in C of [[Aldershot Command]].<ref>Dunlop, Colonel John K., ''The Development of the British Army 1899\u20131914'', London, Methuen (1938) p. 72.</ref> In South Africa the corps never operated as such and the [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st]], [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd]] and [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd]] divisions were widely dispersed.\n\n== First phase: The Boer offensive (October\u2013December 1899) ==\n\n=== Boer organisation and skills ===\n\nWar was declared on 11 October 1899 with a Boer offensive into the British-held Natal and Cape Colony areas. The Boers had about 33,000 soldiers, and decisively outnumbered the British, who could move only 13,000 troops to the front line.{{sfn|Searle|2004|p=276}} The Boers had no problems with mobilisation, since the fiercely independent Boers had no regular army units, apart from the ''Staatsartillerie'' (Afrikaans for 'States Artillery') of both republics. As with the First Boer War, since most of the Boers were members of civilian militias, none had adopted uniforms or insignia. Only the members of the ''Staatsartillerie'' wore light green uniforms.\n\n[[File:Mafikeng Second Boer War.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Boers in a trench at Mafeking, 1899]]\nWhen danger loomed, all the ''burgers'' (citizens) in a district would form a military unit called a ''commando'' and would elect officers. A full-time official titled a ''Veldkornet'' maintained muster rolls, but had no disciplinary powers. Each man brought his own weapon, usually a hunting rifle, and his own horse. Those who could not afford a gun were given one by the authorities.<ref name=\"Andr\u00e9 Wessels 2000 p.80\" /> The Presidents of the Transvaal and Orange Free State simply signed decrees to concentrate within a week and the Commandos could muster between 30,000\u201340,000 men.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pakenham|1979|p=56}}</ref> The average Boer nevertheless was not thirsty for war. Many did not look forward to fighting against fellow Christians and, by and large, fellow Christian Protestants. Many may have had an overly optimistic sense of what the war would involve, imagining that victory could be won as easily as in the First South African War.{{sfn|Wessels|2000|p=74}} Many, including many generals, also had a sense that their cause was holy and just, and blessed by God.{{sfn|Pretorius|2000|p=179}}\n\nIt rapidly became clear that the Boer forces presented the British forces with a severe tactical challenge. What the Boers presented was a mobile and innovative approach to warfare, drawing on their experiences from the First Boer War. The average Boers who made up their Commandos were farmers who had spent almost all their working life in the saddle, both as farmers and hunters. They depended on the pot, horse and rifle; they were also skilled stalkers and marksmen. As hunters they had learned to fire from cover; from a [[Prone position|prone]] position and to make the first shot count, knowing that if they missed, the game would either be long gone or could charge and potentially kill them.\n\nAt community gatherings, target shooting was a major sport; they practised shooting at targets such as hens' eggs perched on posts {{convert|100|m|yd}} away. They made expert mounted infantry, using every scrap of cover, from which they could pour in a destructive fire using modern, smokeless, [[Mauser]] rifles. In preparation for hostilities, the Boers had acquired around one hundred of the latest [[Krupp]] [[8 cm Kanone C/80|field guns]], all horse-drawn and dispersed among the various Kommando groups and several [[Le Creusot]] \"[[155 mm Creusot Long Tom|Long Tom]]\" siege guns. The Boers' skill in adapting themselves to become first-rate artillerymen shows them to have been a versatile adversary.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pakenham|1979|p=30}}</ref> The Transvaal also had an intelligence service that stretched across South Africa and of whose extent and efficiency the British were as yet unaware.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wessels|2000|p=81}}</ref>\n\n=== Boers besiege Ladysmith, Mafeking and Kimberley ===\n[[File:NorthNatalWarTheatre, colour, crop.png|thumb|right|War theatre in northern Natal]]\nThe Boers struck first on 12 October at the [[Battle of Kraaipan]], an attack that heralded the invasion of the [[Cape Colony]] and [[Colony of Natal]] between October 1899 and January 1900. With speed and surprise, the Boer drove quickly towards the British garrison at Ladysmith and the smaller ones at Mafeking and Kimberley. The quick Boer mobilisation resulted in early military successes against scattered British forces. Sir [[George White (British Army officer)|George Stuart White]], commanding the British division at [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]], had unwisely allowed Major-General [[Penn Symons]] to throw a brigade forward to the coal-mining town of Dundee (also reported as Glencoe), which was surrounded by hills. This became the site of the first engagement of the war, the [[Battle of Talana Hill]]. Boer guns began shelling the British camp from the summit of Talana Hill at dawn on 20 October. Penn Symons immediately counter-attacked: his infantry drove the Boers from the hill, for the loss of 446 British casualties, including Penn Symons.\n\nAnother Boer force occupied Elandslaagte, which lay between Ladysmith and Dundee. The British under Major General [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]] and Colonel [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Ian Hamilton]] attacked to clear the line of communications to Dundee. The resulting [[Battle of Elandslaagte]] was a clear-cut British tactical victory, but Sir George White feared that more Boers were about to attack his main position and so ordered a chaotic retreat from Elandslaagte, throwing away any advantage gained. The detachment from Dundee was compelled to make an exhausting cross-country retreat to rejoin White's main force. As Boers surrounded Ladysmith and opened fire on the town with siege guns, White ordered a major sortie against their artillery positions. The result was a disaster, with 140 men killed and over 1,000 captured. The [[Siege of Ladysmith]] began, and was to last several months.\n\nMeanwhile, to the north-west at Mafeking, on the border with Transvaal, Colonel [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] had raised two regiments of local forces amounting to about 1,200 men in order to attack and create diversions if things further south went amiss. Mafeking, being a railway junction, provided good supply facilities and was the obvious place for Baden-Powell to fortify in readiness for such attacks. However, instead of being the aggressor Baden-Powell and Mafeking were forced to defend when 6,000 Boer, commanded by [[Piet Cronj\u00e9]], attempted a determined assault on the town. But this quickly subsided into a desultory affair with the Boers prepared to starve the stronghold into submission, and so, on 13 October, began the 217-day [[Siege of Mafeking]].\n\nLastly, over {{convert|360|km|mi}} to the south of Mafeking lay the diamond mining city of Kimberley, which was also subjected to a [[Siege of Kimberley|siege]]. Although not militarily significant, it nonetheless represented an enclave of British imperialism on the borders of the [[Orange Free State]] and was hence an important Boer objective. From early November about 7,500 Boer began their siege, again content to starve the town into submission. Despite Boer shelling, the 40,000 inhabitants, of which only 5,000 were armed, were under little threat as the town was well-stocked with provisions. The garrison was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel [[Robert Kekewich]], although [[Cecil Rhodes]] was also a prominent figure in the town's defences.\n\nSiege life took its toll on both the defending soldiers and the civilians in the cities of Mafeking, Ladysmith, and Kimberley as food began to grow scarce after a few weeks. In Mafeking, [[Sol Plaatje]] wrote, \"I saw horseflesh for the first time being treated as a human foodstuff.\" The cities under siege also dealt with constant artillery bombardment, making the streets a dangerous place. Near the end of the siege of Kimberley, it was expected that the Boers would intensify their bombardment, so Rhodes displayed a notice encouraging people to go down into shafts of the [[Big Hole|Kimberley Mine]] for protection. The townspeople panicked, and people surged into the mine-shafts constantly for a 12-hour period. Although the bombardment never came, this did nothing to diminish the anxious civilians distress.  The most well-heeled of the townspeople, such as Cecil Rhodes, sheltered in the Sanatorium, site of the present-day [[McGregor Museum]]; the poorer residents, notably the black population, did not have any shelter from the shelling.\n\nIn retrospect, the Boer decision to commit themselves to sieges (''[[Sitzkrieg]]'') was a mistake and one of the best illustrations of the Boers' lack of strategic vision.  Historically, it had little in its favour. Of the seven sieges in the First Boer War, the Boers had won none. More importantly, it handed the initiative back to the British and allowed them time to recover, which they then did.  Generally speaking, throughout the campaign, the Boers were too defensive and passive, wasting the opportunities they had for victory.  Yet that passiveness also testified to the fact that they had no desire to conquer British territory, but only to preserve their ability to rule in their own territory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wessels|2000|pp=82\u201385}}</ref>\n\n=== First British relief attempts ===\n[[File:VCRedversHenryBuller.jpg|thumb|upright|General [[Redvers Henry Buller]] launched an offensive against the Boers in the early phases of the war but after several defeats, culminating at the [[Battle of Colenso]], he was replaced by [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Earl Roberts]].]]\nBy February 1900 General Sir [[Redvers Henry Buller]], a much respected commander, arrived in South Africa with British reinforcements (including an army corps of three infantry divisions and one cavalry division). Buller originally intended an offensive straight up the railway line leading from [[Cape Town]] through [[Bloemfontein]] to [[Pretoria]]. Finding on arrival that the British troops already in South Africa were under siege, he split his army corps into detachments to relieve the besieged garrisons. One division, led by Lieutenant General [[Paul Methuen, 3rd Baron Methuen|Lord Methuen]], was to follow the Western Railway to the north and relieve Kimberley and Mafeking. A smaller force of about 3,000 led by Major General [[William Forbes Gatacre|William Gatacre]], was to push north toward the railway junction at Stormberg, to secure the [[Cape Midlands]] district from Boer raids and local rebellions by Boer inhabitants and Buller led the major part of the army corps to relieve Ladysmith to the east.\n\nThe initial results of this offensive were mixed, with Methuen winning several bloody skirmishes in the [[Battle of Belmont (1899)|Battle of Belmont]] on 23 November, the [[Battle of Graspan]] on 25 November, and at a larger engagement, the [[Battle of Modder River]] on 28 November resulting in British losses of 71 dead and over 400 wounded. British commanders had trained on the lessons of the [[Crimean War]] and were adept at battalion and regimental set pieces with columns manoeuvring in jungles, deserts and mountainous regions. What British generals failed to comprehend was the impact of destructive fire from trench positions and the mobility of cavalry raids. The British troops went to war with what would prove to be antiquated tactics and in some cases antiquated weapons against the mobile Boer forces with the destructive fire of their modern Mausers, the latest Krupp field guns and their novel tactics.<ref>Field Marshal Lord Carver, ''The Boer War'', pp. 259\u201362</ref>\n\nThe middle of December was disastrous for the British Army.  In a period known as [[Black Week]] (10\u201315 December 1899), the British suffered defeats on each of the three fronts.  On 10 December, General Gatacre tried to recapture Stormberg railway junction about {{convert|50|mi|km|order=flip}} south of the [[Orange River]].  Gatacre's attack was marked by administrative and tactical blunders and the [[Battle of Stormberg]] ended in a British defeat, with 135 killed and wounded and two guns and over 600 troops captured.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Magersfontein]] on 11 December, Methuen's 14,000 British troops attempted to capture a Boer position in a dawn attack to relieve Kimberley. This too turned into a disaster when the [[Highland Brigade (Scottish)|Highland Brigade]] became pinned down by accurate Boer fire. After suffering from intense heat and thirst for nine hours, they eventually broke in ill-disciplined retreat. The Boer commanders, [[Koos de la Rey]] and [[Piet Cronj\u00e9]], had ordered [[trench]]es to be dug in an unconventional place to fool the British and to give their riflemen a greater firing range. The plan worked and this tactic helped write the doctrine of the supremacy of the defensive position, using modern small arms and trench fortifications.<ref>'Historical Overview' in Antony O'Brien, ''Bye-Bye Dolly Gray''</ref>{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The British lost 120 killed and 690 wounded and were prevented from relieving Kimberley and Mafeking.

(Quoted in {{Harvnb|Pakenham|1979|p=115}})</ref>}}\n\nThe [[nadir]] of [[Black Week]] was the Battle of Colenso on 15 December, where 21,000 British troops commanded by Buller attempted to cross the [[Tugela River]] to relieve Ladysmith, where 8,000 Transvaal Boers under the command of [[Louis Botha]] were awaiting them.  Through a combination of artillery and accurate rifle fire and better use of the ground, the Boers repelled all British attempts to cross the river.  After his first attacks failed, Buller broke off the battle and ordered a retreat, abandoning many wounded men, several isolated units and ten field guns to be captured by Botha's men. Buller's forces lost 145 men killed and 1,200 missing or wounded and the Boers suffered only 40 casualties, including 8 killed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Steele|2000|p=12}}</ref>\n\n== Second phase: The British offensive of January to September 1900 ==\n[[File:British casualties, Spionkop, 1900.jpg|thumb|British casualties lie dead on the battlefield after the [[Battle of Spion Kop]], 24 January 1900.]]\nThe British government took these defeats badly and with the sieges still continuing was compelled to send two more divisions plus large numbers of colonial volunteers. By January 1900 this would become the largest force Britain had ever sent overseas, amounting to some 180,000 men with further reinforcements being sought.\n\nWhile watching for these reinforcements, Buller made another bid to relieve Ladysmith by crossing the Tugela west of [[Colenso, KwaZulu-Natal|Colenso]]. Buller's subordinate, Major General [[Charles Warren]], successfully crossed the river, but was then faced with a fresh defensive position centred on a prominent hill known as Spion Kop. In the resulting [[Battle of Spion Kop]], British troops captured the summit by surprise during the early hours of 24 January 1900, but as the early morning fog lifted they realised too late that they were overlooked by Boer gun emplacements on the surrounding hills. The rest of the day resulted in a disaster caused by poor communication between Buller and his commanders. Between them they issued contradictory orders, on the one hand ordering men off the hill, while other officers ordered fresh reinforcements to defend it. The result was 350 men killed and nearly 1,000 wounded and a retreat across the Tugela River into British territory. There were nearly 300 Boer casualties.\n\nBuller attacked Louis Botha again on 5 February at [[Battle of Vaal Krantz|Vaal Krantz]] and was again defeated. Buller withdrew early when it appeared that the British would be isolated in an exposed bridgehead across the Tugela, for which he was nicknamed \"Sir Reverse\" by some of his officers.\n\n[[File:Peter de wet01.jpg|thumb|left|Boer General Piet de Wet, 1900]]\nBy taking command in person in Natal, Buller had allowed the overall direction of the war to drift. Because of concerns about his performance and negative reports from the field, he was replaced as Commander in Chief by [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Field Marshal Lord Roberts]]. Roberts quickly assembled an entirely new team for headquarters staff and he chose military men from far and wide: [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] (Chief of Staff) from the Sudan; [[Frederick Russell Burnham]] (Chief of Scouts), the American scout, from the Klondike; [[George Francis Robert Henderson|George Henderson]] from the Staff College; [[Neville Bowles Chamberlain]] from Afghanistan; and [[William Nicholson, 1st Baron Nicholson|William Nicholson]] (Military Secretary) from Calcutta.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Like Buller, Roberts first intended to attack directly along the Cape Town\u2013Pretoria railway but, again like Buller, was forced to relieve the beleaguered garrisons. Leaving Buller in command in Natal, Roberts massed his main force near the [[Orange River]] and along the Western Railway behind Methuen's force at the [[Modder River]], and prepared to make a wide outflanking move to relieve Kimberley.\n\n[[File:Inniskillings al colle di Hart.jpg|thumb|Siege of Ladysmith]]\nExcept in Natal, the war had stagnated. Other than a single attempt to storm Ladysmith, the Boers made no attempt to capture the besieged towns. In the Cape Midlands, the Boers did not exploit the British defeat at Stormberg, and were prevented from capturing the railway junction at [[Colesberg]]. In the dry summer, the grazing on the veld became parched, weakening the Boers' horses and draught oxen, and many Boer families joined their menfolk in the siege lines and ''laagers'' (encampments), fatally encumbering Cronj\u00e9's army.\n\nRoberts launched his main attack on 10 February 1900 and although hampered by a long supply route, managed to outflank the Boers defending [[Magersfontein]]. On 14 February, a cavalry division under Major General [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]] launched a major attack to relieve Kimberley. Although encountering severe fire, a massed cavalry charge split the Boer defences on 15 February, opening the way for French to enter Kimberley that evening, ending its 124 days' siege.\n\nMeanwhile, Roberts pursued Piet Cronj\u00e9's 7,000-strong force, which had abandoned Magersfontein to head for Bloemfontein. General French's cavalry was ordered to assist in the pursuit by embarking on an epic {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} drive towards Paardeberg where Cronj\u00e9 was attempting to cross the Modder River. At the [[Battle of Paardeberg]] from 18 to 27 February, Roberts then surrounded General [[Piet Cronj\u00e9]]'s retreating Boer army. On 17 February, a pincer movement involving both French's cavalry and the main British force attempted to take the entrenched position, but the frontal attacks were uncoordinated and so were easily repulsed by the Boers. Finally, Roberts resorted to bombarding Cronj\u00e9 into submission, but it took a further ten precious days, and with the British troops using the polluted Modder River as water supply, there was a typhoid epidemic killing many troops. General Cronj\u00e9 was forced to surrender at [[Surrender Hill]] with 4,000 men.\n\n[[File:The Relief of Ladysmith by John Henry Frederick Bacon.jpg|thumb|The Relief of Ladysmith. Sir [[George White (British Army officer)|George Stuart White]] greets Major [[Hubert Gough]] on 28 February. Painting by [[John Henry Frederick Bacon]] (1868\u20131914).]]\nIn Natal, the [[Battle of the Tugela Heights]], which started on 14 February was Buller's fourth attempt to relieve Ladysmith. The losses Buller's troops had sustained convinced Buller to adopt Boer tactics \"in the firing line\u2014to advance in small rushes, covered by rifle fire from behind; to use the tactical support of artillery; and above all, to use the ground, making rock and earth work for them as it did for the enemy.\" Despite reinforcements his progress was painfully slow against stiff opposition. However, on 26 February, after much deliberation, Buller used all his forces in one all-out attack for the first time and at last succeeded in forcing a crossing of the Tugela to defeat Botha's outnumbered forces north of Colenso. After a siege lasting 118 days, the [[Relief of Ladysmith]] was effected, the day after Cronj\u00e9 surrendered, but at a total cost of 7,000 British casualties. Buller's troops marched into Ladysmith on 28 February.{{sfn|Pakenham|1991a|p=573}}\n\nAfter a succession of defeats, the Boers realised that against such overwhelming numbers of troops, they had little chance of defeating the British and so became demoralised. Roberts then advanced into the Orange Free State from the west, putting the Boers to flight at the [[Battle of Poplar Grove]] and capturing [[Bloemfontein]], the capital, unopposed on 13 March with the Boer defenders escaping and scattering. Meanwhile, he detached a small force to relieve Baden-Powell. The [[Relief of Mafeking]] on 18 May 1900 provoked riotous celebrations in Britain, the origin of the Edwardian slang word \"mafficking\".  On 28 May, the Orange Free State was annexed and renamed the Orange River Colony.\n\nAfter being forced to delay for several weeks at Bloemfontein by a shortage of supplies, an outbreak of [[Typhoid fever|enteric (typhoid) fever]] caused by poor hygiene, drinking bad drinking water at Paardeburg, and appalling medical care, Roberts finally resumed his advance.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Paterson|first=Andrew Barton|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/From_the_Front.html?id=vEV1AAAAMAAJ|title=From the Front: Dispatches from the Boer War|publisher=[[Pan Macmillan]]|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7329-1062-4|editor-last=Droogleever|editor-first=R.

The first into Pretoria was Lt. William Watson of the New South Wales Mounted Rifles, who persuaded the Boers to surrender the capital.{{sfn|Wilcox|2002|pp=84-85}} Before the war, the Boers had constructed several forts south of Pretoria, but the artillery had been removed from the forts for use in the field, and in the event they abandoned Pretoria without a fight. Having won the principal cities, Roberts declared the war over on 3 September 1900; and the South African Republic was formally annexed.\n\nBritish observers believed the war to be all but over after the capture of the two capital cities. However, the Boers had earlier met at the temporary new capital of the Orange Free State, [[Kroonstad]], and planned a guerrilla campaign to hit the British supply and communication lines. The first engagement of this new form of warfare was at [[Sanna's Post]] on 31 March where 1,500 Boers under the command of [[Christiaan De Wet|Christiaan de Wet]] attacked Bloemfontein's waterworks about {{convert|23|mi|km|order=flip}} east of the city, and ambushed a heavily escorted convoy, which caused 155 British casualties and the capture of seven guns, 117 wagons, and 428 British troops.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Speed, Neil G.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61567917|title=Born to fight : Major Charles Joseph Ross DSO, a definitive study of his life|date=2002|publisher=Caps & Flints Press|isbn=0-9581356-0-6|location=Melbourne|oclc=61567917}}</ref>\n\n[[File:PACronje CHM VA2863.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Piet Cronj\u00e9]] as a prisoner of war in Saint Helena, 1900\u201302. He was captured, with 4,000 men, after the loss of the [[Battle of Paardeberg]].]]\nAfter the fall of Pretoria, one of the last formal battles was at [[Battle of Diamond Hill|Diamond Hill]] on 11\u201312 June, where Roberts attempted to drive the remnants of the Boer field army under Botha beyond striking distance of Pretoria. Although Roberts drove the Boers from the hill, Botha did not regard it as a defeat, for he inflicted 162 casualties on the British while suffering only around 50 casualties.\n\nThe set-piece period of the war now largely gave way to a mobile guerrilla war, but one final operation remained. President Kruger and what remained of the Transvaal government had retreated to eastern Transvaal. Roberts, joined by troops from Natal under Buller, advanced against them, and broke their last defensive position at [[Battle of Bergendal|Bergendal]] on 26 August. As Roberts and Buller followed up along the railway line to [[Komatipoort]], Kruger sought asylum in Portuguese East Africa (modern [[Mozambique]]). Some dispirited Boers did likewise, and the British gathered up much war material. However, the core of the Boer fighters under Botha easily broke back through the [[Drakensberg]] Mountains into the Transvaal highveld after riding north through the bushveld. Under the new conditions of the war, heavy equipment was no use to them, and therefore no great loss.\n\nAs Roberts's army occupied Pretoria, the Boer fighters in the Orange Free State retreated into the Brandwater Basin, a fertile area in the north-east of the Republic. This offered only temporary sanctuary, as the mountain passes leading to it could be occupied by the British, trapping the Boers. A force under General [[Archibald Hunter]] set out from Bloemfontein to achieve this in July 1900. The hard core of the Free State Boers under De Wet, accompanied by President Steyn, left the basin early. Those remaining fell into confusion and most failed to break out before Hunter trapped them. 4,500 Boers surrendered and much equipment was captured but as with Roberts's drive against Kruger at the same time, these losses were of relatively little consequence, as the hard core of the Boer armies and their most determined and active leaders remained at large.\n\nFrom the Basin, Christiaan de Wet headed west. Although hounded by British columns, he succeeded in crossing the Vaal into western Transvaal, to allow Steyn to travel to meet their leaders.  There was much sympathy for the Boers on mainland Europe. In October, President Kruger and members of the Transvaal government left Portuguese East Africa on the Dutch warship ''[[De Gelderland]]'', sent by the Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]]. Paul Kruger's wife, however, was too ill to travel and remained in South Africa where she died on 20 July 1901 without seeing her husband again. President Kruger first went to Marseille and then on to the Netherlands, where he stayed for a while before moving finally to [[Clarens, Switzerland]], where he died in exile on 14 July 1904.\n\n=== POWs sent overseas ===\nThe first sizeable batch of Boer prisoners of war taken by the British consisted of those captured at the [[Battle of Elandslaagte]] on 21 October 1899. At first, many were put on ships, but as numbers grew, the British decided they did not want them kept locally. The capture of 400 POWs in February 1900 was a key event, which made the British realise they could not accommodate all POWs in South Africa.<ref name=\"collint\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boerwarsociety.org/Interests.cfm|title=Anglo-Boer War Philatelic Society: Collecting Interests|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210040529/http://www.boerwarsociety.org/Interests.cfm|archivedate=10 December 2005|access-date=}}</ref> The British feared they could be freed by sympathetic locals.

However, they soon discovered that they only controlled the territory their columns physically occupied. Despite the loss of their two capital cities and half of their army, the Boer commanders adopted [[guerrilla warfare]] tactics, primarily conducting raids against railways, resource and supply targets, all aimed at disrupting the operational capacity of the British Army. They avoided pitched battles and casualties were light.\n\nEach Boer commando unit was sent to the district from which its members had been recruited, which meant that they could rely on local support and personal knowledge of the terrain and the towns within the district thereby enabling them to live off the land. Their orders were simply to act against the British whenever possible. Their tactics were to strike fast and hard causing as much damage to the enemy as possible, and then to withdraw and vanish before enemy reinforcements could arrive. The vast distances of the Republics allowed the Boer commandos considerable freedom to move about and made it nearly impossible for the 250,000 British troops to control the territory effectively using columns alone. As soon as a British column left a town or district, British control of that area faded away.\n[[File:BoerWarBlockHouse SouthAfrica.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A surviving [[blockhouse]] in South Africa. Blockhouses were constructed by the British to secure supply routes from Boer raids during the war.]]\n\nThe Boer commandos were especially effective during the initial guerrilla phase of the war because Roberts had assumed that the war would end with the capture of the Boer capitals and the dispersal of the main Boer armies. Many British troops were therefore redeployed out of the area, and had been replaced by lower-quality contingents of [[Imperial Yeomanry]] and locally raised irregular corps.\n\nFrom late May 1900, the first successes of the Boer guerrilla strategy were at Lindley (where 500 Yeomanry surrendered), and at Heilbron (where a large convoy and its escort were captured) and other skirmishes resulting in 1,500 British casualties in less than ten days. In December 1900, De la Rey and [[Christiaan Beyers]] attacked and mauled a British brigade at [[Battle of Nooitgedacht|Nooitgedacht]]. As a result of these and other Boer successes, the British, led by Lord Kitchener, mounted three extensive searches for [[Christiaan de Wet]], but without success. However, the very nature of the Boer guerrilla war and the Boer raids on British camps were sporadic, poorly planned, and had little overall long-term objective, with the exception to simply harass the British. This led to a disorganised pattern of scattered engagements between the British and the Boers throughout the region.\n\n===British response===<!-- This section is linked from [[Blockhouse]] -->\nThe British were forced to quickly revise their tactics. They concentrated on restricting the freedom of movement of the Boer commandos and depriving them of local support. The railway lines had provided vital lines of communication and supply, and as the British had advanced across South Africa, they had used [[armoured train]]s and had established fortified [[blockhouses]] at key points.<ref name=\"Jones\" /> They now built additional blockhouses (each housing 6\u20138 soldiers) and fortified these to protect supply routes against Boer [[raid (military)|raiders]]. Eventually some 8,000 such blockhouses were built across the two South African republics, radiating from the larger towns along principal routes. Each blockhouse cost between \u00a3800 to \u00a31,000 and took about three months to build. However, they proved very effective. Not one bridge where one of these blockhouses was sited and manned was blown.<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nThe blockhouse system required an enormous number of troops to garrison. Well over 50,000 British troops, or 50 battalions, were involved in blockhouse duty, greater than the approximately 30,000 Boers in the field during the guerrilla phase. In addition, up to 16,000 Africans were used both as armed guards and to patrol the line at night.<ref name=\"Jones\">{{harvnb|Jones|1996}}</ref> The Army linked the blockhouses with barbed wire fences to parcel up the wide veld into smaller areas. \"New Model\" drives were mounted under which a continuous line of troops could sweep an area of veld bounded by blockhouse lines, unlike the earlier inefficient scouring of the countryside by scattered columns.\n\n[[File:VerskroeideAarde1.jpg|thumb|left|One British response to the guerrilla war was a '[[scorched earth]]' policy to deny the guerrillas supplies and refuge. In this image [[Boer]] civilians watch their house as it is burned.]]\nThe British also implemented a \"[[scorched earth]]\" policy under which they targeted everything within the controlled areas that could give sustenance to the Boer guerrillas with a view to making it harder for the Boers to survive. As British troops swept the countryside, they systematically destroyed crops, burned homesteads and farms and interned Boer and African men, women, children and workers in concentration camps. Finally, the British also established their own mounted raiding columns in support of the sweeper columns. These were used to rapidly follow and relentlessly harass the Boers with a view to delaying them and cutting off escape, while the sweeper units caught up. Many of the 90 or so mobile columns formed by the British to participate in such drives were a mixture of British and colonial troops, but they also had a large minority of armed Africans. The total number of armed Africans serving with these columns has been estimated at approximately 20,000.\n\nThe British Army also made use of Boer auxiliaries who had been persuaded to change sides and enlist as \"National Scouts\". Serving under the command of General Andries Cronj\u00e9, the National Scouts were despised as ''joiners'' but came to number a fifth of the fighting Afrikaners by the end of the War.{{sfn|Pakenham|1991|p=571}}\n\nThe British utilised armoured trains throughout the War to deliver rapid reaction forces much more quickly to incidents (such as Boer attacks on blockhouses and columns) or to drop them off ahead of retreating Boer columns.\n\n=== Peace committees ===\nAmong those Burghers who had stopped fighting, it was decided to form peace committees to persuade those who were still fighting to desist. In December 1900 Lord Kitchener gave permission that a central Burgher Peace Committee be inaugurated in Pretoria. By the end of 1900 some thirty envoys were sent out to the various districts to form local peace committees to persuade burghers to give up the fight. Previous leaders of the Boers, like Generals Piet de Wet and Andries Cronj\u00e9 were involved in the organisation. [[Meyer de Kock]] was the only emissary of a peace committee to be convicted of high treason and executed by firing squad.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=140}}\n\n=== Joiners ===\nSome burghers joined the British in their fight against the Boers. By the end of hostilities in May 1902, there were no fewer than 5,464 burghers working for the British.{{sfn|Ploeger1985|pp=15\u201322}}\n\n=== Orange Free State ===\n[[File:Christiaan de Wet.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Christiaan De Wet]] was the most formidable leader of the Boer guerrillas. He successfully evaded capture on numerous occasions and was later involved in the negotiations for a peace settlement.]]\nAfter having conferred with the Transvaal leaders, [[Christiaan de Wet]] returned to the Orange Free State, where he inspired a series of successful attacks and raids from the hitherto quiet western part of the country, though he suffered a rare defeat at [[Battle of Bothaville|Bothaville]] in November 1900. Many Boers who had earlier returned to their farms, sometimes giving formal parole to the British, took up arms again. In late January 1901, De Wet led a renewed invasion of [[Cape Colony]]. This was less successful, because there was no general uprising among the Cape Boers, and De Wet's men were hampered by bad weather and relentlessly pursued by British forces. They narrowly escaped across the [[Orange River]].\n\nFrom then until the final days of the war, De Wet remained comparatively quiet, partly because the Orange Free State was effectively left desolate by British sweeps. In late 1901, De Wet overran an isolated British detachment at [[Battle of Groenkop|Groenkop]], inflicting heavy casualties. This prompted Kitchener to launch the first of the \"New Model\" drives against him. De Wet escaped the first such drive, but lost 300 of his fighters. This was a severe loss, and a portent of further attrition, although the subsequent attempts to round up De Wet were badly handled, and De Wet's forces avoided capture.\n\n=== Western Transvaal ===\nThe Boer commandos in the Western Transvaal were very active after September 1901. Several battles of importance were fought here between September 1901 and March 1902. At Moedwil on 30 September 1901 and again at Driefontein on 24 October, General [[Koos De La Rey]]'s forces attacked the British, but were forced to withdraw after the British offered strong resistance.\n\nA time of relative quiet descended thereafter on the western Transvaal. February 1902 saw the next major battle in that region. On 25 February, [[Koos De La Rey]] attacked a British column under Lieutenant-Colonel [[Stanley Brenton von Donop|S. B. von Donop]] at Ysterspruit near [[Wolmaransstad]]. De La Rey succeeded in capturing many men and a large amount of ammunition. The Boer attacks prompted Lord Methuen, the British second-in-command after [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], to move his column from Vryburg to Klerksdorp to deal with De La Rey. On the morning of 7 March 1902, the Boers attacked the rear guard of Methuen's moving column at [[Battle of Tweebosch|Tweebosch]]. Confusion reigned in British ranks and Methuen was wounded and captured by the Boers.\n\nThe Boer victories in the west led to stronger action by the British. In the second half of March 1902, large British reinforcements were sent to the Western Transvaal under the direction of Ian Hamilton. The opportunity the British were waiting for arose on 11 April 1902 at [[Battle of Rooiwal|Rooiwal]], where a commando led by General [[Jan Kemp (South African)|Jan Kemp]] and Commandant Potgieter attacked a superior force under Kekewich. The British soldiers were well positioned on the hillside and inflicted severe casualties on the Boers charging on horseback over a large distance, beating them back. This was the end of the war in the Western Transvaal and also the last major battle of the war.\n\n=== Eastern Transvaal ===\n[[File:Afrikaner Commandos2.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Boer Commando|Boer commandos]]]]\nTwo Boer forces fought in this area, one under Botha in the south east and a second under Ben Viljoen in the north east around Lydenburg. Botha's forces were particularly active, raiding railways and British supply convoys, and even mounting a renewed invasion of Natal in September 1901. After defeating British mounted infantry in the [[Battle of Blood River Poort]] near [[Dundee, KwaZulu-Natal|Dundee]], Botha was forced to withdraw by heavy rains that made movement difficult and crippled his horses. Back on the Transvaal territory around his home district of Vryheid, Botha attacked a British raiding column at [[Battle of Bakenlaagte|Bakenlaagte]], using an effective mounted charge. One of the most active British units was effectively destroyed in this engagement. This made Botha's forces the target of increasingly large and ruthless drives by British forces, in which the British made particular use of native scouts and informers. Eventually, Botha had to abandon the high veld and retreat to a narrow enclave bordering [[Swaziland]].\n\nTo the north, Ben Viljoen grew steadily less active. His forces mounted comparatively few attacks and as a result, the Boer enclave around [[Lydenburg]] was largely unmolested. Viljoen was eventually captured.\n\n=== Cape Colony ===\nIn parts of Cape Colony, particularly the Cape Midlands district where Boers formed a majority of the white inhabitants, the British had always feared a general uprising against them. In fact, no such uprising took place, even in the early days of the war when Boer armies had advanced across the Orange. The cautious conduct of some of the elderly Orange Free State generals had been one factor that discouraged the Cape Boers from siding with the Boer republics. Nevertheless, there was widespread pro-Boer sympathy.  Some of the Cape Dutch volunteered to help the British, but a much larger number volunteered to help the other side. The political factor was more important than the military: the Cape Dutch controlled the provincial legislature. Milner said 90 percent favoured the rebels.{{sfn|Marsh|1994|pages=483\u201385}}\n\nAfter he escaped across the Orange in March 1901, [[Christiaan de Wet]] had left forces under Cape rebels [[Pieter Hendrik Kritzinger|Kritzinger]] and Scheepers to maintain a guerrilla campaign in the Cape Midlands. The campaign here was one of the least chivalrous of the war, with intimidation by both sides of each other's civilian sympathizers. In one of many skirmishes, Commandant Lotter's small commando was tracked down by a much-superior British column and wiped out at [[Battle of Groenkloof|Groenkloof]]. Several captured rebels, including Lotter and Scheepers, who was captured when he fell ill with appendicitis, were executed by the British for treason or for capital crimes such as the murder of prisoners or of unarmed civilians. Some of the executions took place in public, to deter further disaffection. Since the Cape Colony was Imperial territory, its authorities forbade the British Army to burn farms or to force Boers into concentration camps.\n\nFresh Boer forces under [[Jan Christiaan Smuts]], joined by the surviving rebels under Kritzinger, made another attack on the Cape in September 1901. They suffered severe hardships and were hard pressed by British columns, but eventually rescued themselves by routing some of their pursuers at the [[Battle of Elands River (1901)|Battle of Elands River]] and capturing their equipment. From then until the end of the war, Smuts increased his forces from among Cape rebels until they numbered 3,000. However, no general uprising took place, and the situation in the Cape remained stalemated.\n\nIn January 1902, Boer leader [[Manie Maritz]] was implicated in the [[Leliefontein massacre]] in the far [[Northern Cape]].\n\n=== Boer foreign volunteers ===\n{{Main|Boer foreign volunteers}}\nWhile no other government actively supported the Boer cause, individuals from several countries volunteered and formed Foreign Volunteer Units. These primarily came from [[Europe]], particularly the [[Netherlands]], [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Sweden-Norway]]. Other countries such as [[French Fourth Republic|France]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Ireland]] (then wholly part of the United Kingdom), and restive areas of the [[Russian Empire]], including [[Poland]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], also formed smaller volunteer corps. Finns fought in the Scandinavian Corps. Two volunteers, [[George Henri Anne-Marie Victor de Villebois-Mareuil]] of France and [[Yevgeny Maximov]] of Russia became ''veggeneraals'' (fighting generals) of the South African Republic.{{sfn|Davidson & Filatova|1998|p=80}}\n\n== Nonwhite roles ==\nThe policy on both sides was to minimise the role of nonwhites but the need for manpower continuously stretched those resolves.  At the battle of Spion Kop in Ladysmith, Mahatma Gandhi with 300 free burgher Indians and 800 indentured Indian labourers started the Ambulance Corps serving the British side.  As the war raged across African farms and their homes were destroyed, many became refugees and they, like the Boers, moved to the towns where the British hastily created internment camps. Subsequently, the \"Scorched Earth\" policy was ruthlessly applied to both Boers and Africans. Although most black Africans were not considered by the British to be hostile, many tens of thousands were also forcibly removed from Boer areas and also placed in concentration camps. Africans were held separately from Boer internees. Eventually there were a total of 64 tented camps for Africans. Conditions were as bad as in the camps for the Boers, but even though, after the Fawcett Commission report, conditions improved in the Boer camps, \"improvements were much slower in coming to the black camps.\" 20,000 died there.{{sfn|Warwick|1983|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}\n\nAbout 10,000 black men were attached to Boer units where they performed camp duties; a handful unofficially fought in combat.  The British Army employed over 14,000 Africans as wagon drivers. Even more had combatant roles as spies, guides, and eventually as soldiers. By 1902 there were about 30,000 armed Africans in the British Army.{{sfn|Pretorius|2011|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}\n\n== Concentration camps ==\n{{Main|British concentration camps}}\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-215-94-Derivative01.jpg|thumb|Tents in the [[Bloemfontein]] concentration camp]]\n\nThe term \"[[concentration camp]]\" was used to describe camps operated by the British in South Africa during this conflict in the years 1900\u20131902, and the term grew in prominence during this period.\n\nThe camps had originally been set up by the British Army as \"[[refugee camps]]\" to provide refuge for civilian families who had been forced to abandon their homes for whatever reason related to the war. However, when Kitchener took over in late 1900, he introduced new tactics in an attempt to break the [[Boer Commando|guerrilla campaign]] and the influx of civilians grew dramatically as a result.

This was not the first appearance of internment camps, as the Spanish had used internment in Cuba in the [[Ten Years' War]], but the Boer War concentration camp system was the first time that a whole nation had been systematically targeted, and the first in which whole regions had been depopulated.\n\nEventually, there were a total of 45 tented camps built for Boer internees and 64 for black Africans. Of the 28,000 Boer men captured as [[prisoners of war]], 25,630 were sent overseas and either freed or enslaved within civil societies. The vast majority of Boers remaining in the local camps were women and children. Over 27,000 women and children were to perish in these concentration camps.{{sfn|Wessels|2010|p=32}}\n\nThe camps were poorly administered from the outset and became increasingly overcrowded when Kitchener's troops implemented the internment strategy on a vast scale. Conditions were terrible for the health of the internees, mainly due to neglect, poor hygiene and bad sanitation. The supply of all items was unreliable, partly because of the constant disruption of communication lines by the Boers. The food [[ration]]s were meager and there was a two-tier allocation policy, whereby families of men who were still fighting were routinely given smaller rations than others.{{sfn|Pakenham|1979|p=505}} The inadequate shelter, poor diet, bad hygiene and overcrowding led to malnutrition and endemic contagious diseases such as [[measles]], [[typhoid]], and [[dysentery]], to which the children were particularly vulnerable. {{sfn|Judd|Surridge|2013|p=195}} Coupled with a shortage of modern medical facilities, many of the internees died. [[Emily Hobhouse]] was instrumental in bringing relief to the concentration camps, as well as raising public awareness in Europe of the atrocities.\n\n== The end of the war ==\n[[File:Resa del bacino del Brandewater.jpg|thumb|The end result of the Boer War was the [[annexation]] of the [[Boer Republics]] to the British Empire in 1902]]\n[[File:Kitchener at the Peace Conference that ended the Second Boer War.png|thumb|Peace conference at Vereeniging]]\n[[File:Company C returns from Boer War.jpg|thumb|C Company returns from Boer War, pictured here in [[King Street (Toronto)|King Street]], [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada.]]\nTowards the end of the war, British tactics of containment, denial, and harassment began to yield results against the guerrillas. The sourcing and co-ordination of intelligence became increasingly efficient with regular reporting from observers in the [[blockhouses]], from units patrolling the fences and conducting \"sweeper\" operations, and from native Africans in rural areas who increasingly supplied intelligence, as the [[Scorched Earth]] policy took effect and they found themselves competing with the Boers for food supplies. Kitchener's forces at last began to seriously affect the Boers' fighting strength and freedom of manoeuvre, and made it harder for the Boers and their families to survive. Despite this success, almost half the Boer fighting strength, 15,000 men were still in the field fighting. Kitchener's tactics were very costly: Britain was running out of time and money and needed to change tack.{{sfn|O'Brien|1988|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}\n\nThe Boers and the British both feared the consequences of arming Africans. The memories of the Zulu and other tribal conflicts were still fresh, and they recognised that whoever won would have to deal with the consequences of a mass militarisation of the tribes. There was therefore an unwritten agreement that this war would be a \"white man's war.\" At the outset, British officials instructed all white magistrates in the Natal Colony to appeal to Zulu amakhosi (chiefs) to remain neutral, and President Kruger sent emissaries asking them to stay out of it. However, in some cases there were old scores to be settled, and some Africans, such as the [[Swazi people|Swazis]], were eager to enter the war with the specific aim of reclaiming land won by the Boers. As the war went on there was greater involvement of Africans, and in particular large numbers became embroiled in the conflict on the British side, either voluntarily or involuntarily. By the end of the war, many blacks had been armed and had shown conspicuous gallantry in roles such as scouts, messengers, watchmen in blockhouses, and auxiliaries.\n\nAnd there were more flash-points outside of the war. On 6 May 1902 at Holkrantz in the southeastern Transvaal, a Zulu faction had their cattle stolen and their people mistreated by the Boers as a punishment for helping the British. The local Boer officer then sent an insulting message to the tribe, challenging them to take back their cattle. The Zulus attacked at night, and in a mutual bloodbath, the Boers lost 56 killed and 3 wounded, while the Africans suffered 52 killed and 48 wounded.{{sfn|Pakenham|1979|p=601}}\n\nThe British offered terms of peace on various occasions, notably in March 1901, but were rejected by Botha and the \"Bitter-enders\" among the commandos. They pledged to fight until the bitter end and rejected the demand for compromise made by the \"Hands-uppers.\"  Their reasons included hatred of the British, loyalty to their dead comrades, solidarity with fellow commandos, an intense desire for independence, religious arguments, and fear of captivity or punishment. On the other hand, their women and children were dying every day and independence seemed impossible.{{sfn|Grundlingh|1980|pp=258\u201378}} The last of the Boers surrendered in May 1902 and the war ended with the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] signed on 31 May 1902. The British had won and offered generous terms to regain the support of the Boers.The Boers were given \u00a33,000,000 for reconstruction and were promised eventual limited self-government, which was granted in 1906 and 1907. The treaty ended the existence of the [[South African Republic]] and the [[Orange Free State]] as independent Boer republics and placed them within the [[British Empire]]. The [[Union of South Africa]] was established as a [[dominion]] of the [[British Empire]] in 1910.\n\n=== Cost of the war ===\nIt is estimated that the total cost of the war to the British government was \u00a3211,156,000<ref name=\"CostofWar\">{{harvnb|''Cost of the war''|loc={{Unreliable source?|date=February 2017}} }}</ref> (equivalent to \u00a3202,000,000,000 in 2014).{{sfn|Measuringworth|2015}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 0 1.0em 1.0em; text-align:right; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#ccf;\"| Cost of War over its entire course\n|-\n!

The predominantly agrarian society of the former [[Boer]] republics was profoundly and fundamentally affected by the [[scorched earth]] policy of Roberts and Kitchener. The devastation of both Boer and black African populations in the concentration camps and through war and exile were to have a lasting effect on the demography and quality of life in the region. Many exiles and prisoners were unable to return to their farms at all; others attempted to do so but were forced to abandon the farms as unworkable given the damage caused by farm burning in the course of the scorched earth policy. Destitute Boers and black Africans swelled the ranks of the unskilled urban poor competing with the \"uitlanders\" in the mines.{{sfn|Onselen|1982|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}\n\nThe postwar reconstruction administration was presided over by [[Lord Milner]] and his largely Oxford trained [[Milner's Kindergarten]]. This small group of civil servants had a profound effect on the region, eventually leading to the [[Union of South Africa]].\n{{quote|In the aftermath of the war, an imperial administration freed from accountability to a domestic electorate set about reconstructing an economy that was by then predicated unambiguously on gold.

He was involved from the start of the war and had a role in the peace process and the creation of the [[Union of South Africa]].]]\nThe counterinsurgency techniques and lessons (the restriction of movement, the containment of space, the ruthless targeting of anything, everything and anyone that could give sustenance to guerrillas, the relentless harassment through sweeper groups coupled with rapid reaction forces, the sourcing and co-ordination of intelligence, and the nurturing of native allies) learned during the Boer War were used by the British (and other forces) in future guerrilla campaigns including to counter [[Federation of Malaya|Malayan]] communist rebels during the [[Malayan Emergency]]. In World War II the British also adopted some of the concepts of raiding from the Boer commandos when, after the [[Battle of France|fall of France]], they set up their special raiding forces, and in acknowledgement of their erstwhile enemies, chose the name [[British Commandos]].\n\nMany of the Boers referred to the war as the second of the ''Freedom Wars''. The most resistant of Boers wanted to continue the fight and were known as \"''[[Bittereinder]]s''\" (or ''irreconcilables'') and at the end of the war a number of Boer fighters such as [[Deneys Reitz]] chose exile rather than sign an oath, such as the following, to pledge allegiance to Britain:{{sfn|Swardt|1998|p=97}}\n{{Quote box|width=50%|align=none|quote=The bearer, ''&lt;prisoner name&gt;'' has been released from prison of war camp ''&lt;Camp name&gt;'' on signing that he acknowledge terms of surrender and becomes a British subject.\n}}\nOver the following decade, many returned to South Africa and never signed the pledge. Some, like Reitz, eventually reconciled themselves to the new ''status quo'', but others could not.\n\n=== Union of South Africa ===\n{{Main|Union of South Africa}}\nOne of the most important events in the decade after the end of the war was the creation of the [[Union of South Africa]] (later the [[Republic of South Africa]]). It proved a key ally to Britain as a [[British Dominions|Dominion]] of the [[British Empire]] during the World Wars. At the start of the First World War a crisis ensued when the South African government led by [[Louis Botha]] and other former Boer fighters, such as [[Jan Smuts]], declared support for Britain and agreed to send troops to take over the German colony of [[German South-West Africa]] (Namibia).\n\nMany Boers were opposed to fighting for Britain, especially against Germany, which had been sympathetic to their struggle. A number of ''bittereinders'' and their allies took part in a revolt known as the [[Maritz Rebellion]]. This was quickly suppressed, and in 1916 the leading Boer rebels in the Maritz Rebellion got off lightly (especially compared with the fate of leading Irish rebels of the [[Easter Rising#Men executed for their role in the Easter Rising|Easter Rising]]), with terms of imprisonment of six and seven years and heavy fines. Two years later, they were released from prison, as Louis Botha recognised the value of reconciliation. Thereafter the ''bittereinders'' concentrated on political organisation within the constitutional system and built up what later became the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], which took power in 1948 and dominated the politics of South Africa from the late 1940s until the early 1990s, under the [[apartheid]] system.\n\n=== Effect of the war on domestic British politics ===\n{{further|Opposition to the Second Boer War}}\n[[File:Dublin St. Patrick's Cathedral North Transept Window King Cormac of Cashel Detail Irish Royal Regiment 2012 09 26.jpg|thumb|Memorial window from [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]] by [[An T\u00far Gloine]].

In addition, small groups of Irish volunteers went to South Africa to fight with the Boers\u2014this despite the fact that there were many Irish troops fighting in the British army, including the [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers]].{{efn|\"Although some 30,000 Irishmen served in the British Army under Irish General Lord Frederick Roberts, who had been Commander of Chief of British Forces in Ireland prior to his transfer to South Africa, some historians argue that the sympathies of many of their compatriots lay with the Boers. Nationalist-controlled local authorities passed pro-Boer resolutions and there were proposals to confer civic honours on Boer leader, Paul Kruger.\" (Irish Ambassador Daniel Mulhall [http://www.promuda-prodigy.com/archives/000083.html written] for ''History Ireland'', 2004.)}} In Britain, the \"Pro-Boer\" campaign expanded,{{efn|[[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] and [[Keir Hardie]] were members of the [[Stop the War Committee]] (See the founder's biography: [http://www.attackingthedevil.co.uk/worksabout/bairns.php William T.

Chesterton]]'s writing to 1905 \u2013 (see [[Rice University]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20000605083501/http://www.cs.rice.edu:80/~ssiyer/minstrels/poems/228.html Chesterton's poetry analysis)]}} with writers often idealising the Boer society.\n\nThe war also highlighted the dangers of Britain's policy of non-alignment and deepened her isolation. The [[1900 United Kingdom general election|1900 UK general election]], also known as the \"[[Khaki election]]\", was called by the Prime Minister, [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], on the back of recent British victories. There was much enthusiasm for the war at this point, resulting in a victory for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government.\n\nHowever, public support quickly waned as it became apparent that the war would not be easy and it dragged on, partially contributing to [[1906 United Kingdom general election|the Conservatives' spectacular defeat in 1906]]. There was public outrage at the use of [[scorched earth]] tactics\u2014the forced clearance of men, women and children, the destruction of the countryside, burning of Boer homesteads for example\u2014and the conditions in the concentration camps. It also became apparent that there were serious problems with public health in Britain: up to 40% of recruits in Britain were unfit for [[conscription|military service]], suffering from medical problems such as [[rickets]] and other poverty-related illnesses. This came at a time of increasing concern for the state of the poor in Britain.\n\nHaving taken the country into a prolonged war, the Conservative government was rejected by the electorate at the first general election after the war was over.  Balfour, succeeding his uncle Lord Salisbury in 1903 immediately after the war, took over a Conservative party that had won two successive landslide majorities but led it to a landslide defeat in 1906.\n\n=== Horses ===\n[[File:Horses on board ship - a guide to their management-page69.jpg|thumb|A horse destined to serve in the war, being off-loaded in [[Port Elizabeth]]]]\nThe number of horses killed in the war was at the time unprecedented in modern warfare. For example, in the [[Siege of Kimberley|Relief of Kimberley]], French's cavalry rode 500 horses to their deaths in a single day. The wastage was particularly heavy among British forces for several reasons: overloading of horses with unnecessary equipment and saddlery, failure to rest and acclimatise horses after long sea voyages and, later in the war, poor management by inexperienced mounted troops and distant control by unsympathetic staffs.{{sfn|McElwee|1974|pp=223\u201329}} The average life expectancy of a British horse, from the time of its arrival in Port Elizabeth, was around six weeks.{{sfn|Hayes|1902|pp=213\u201314}}\n\nHorses were slaughtered for their meat when needed. During the [[Siege of Kimberley]] and [[Siege of Ladysmith]], horses were consumed as food once the regular sources of meat were depleted.{{sfn|Davis|1900|p=34}} The besieged British forces in Ladysmith also produced ''chevril'', a [[Bovril]]-like paste, by [[boiling down]] the horse meat to a jelly paste and serving it like beef tea.{{sfn|Watt|1982}}{{sfn|Jacson|1908|p=88}}\n\nThe [[Horse Memorial]] in Port Elizabeth is a tribute to the 300,000 horses that died during the conflict.{{sfn|Pocock|1917|p=viii fn. 11}}\n\n== Imperial involvement ==\n{{See also|History of the British Army#South Africa}}\n[[File:Gandhi Boer War.jpg|thumb|right|Stretcher-bearers of the Indian Ambulance Corps during the war, including the future leader [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] (Middle row, 5th from left)]]\nThe vast majority of troops fighting for the British army came from Great Britain. Yet a significant number came from other parts of the [[British Empire]]. These countries had their own internal disputes over whether they should remain tied to London, or have full independence, which carried over into the debate around the sending of forces to assist the war. Though not fully independent on foreign affairs, these countries did have local say over how much support to provide, and the manner it was provided. Ultimately, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and British South African Company administered Rhodesia all sent volunteers to aid the United Kingdom. Canada provided the largest number of troops followed by Australia. Troops were also raised to fight with the British from the [[Cape Colony]] and the [[Colony of Natal]]. Some Boer fighters, such as [[Jan Smuts]] and Louis Botha, were technically British subjects as they came from the Cape Colony and Colony of Natal, respectively.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nThere were also many volunteers from the Empire who were not selected for the official contingents from their countries and travelled privately to South Africa to form private units, such as the Canadian Scouts and Doyle's Australian Scouts. There were also some European volunteer units from [[British Raj|British India]] and [[British Ceylon]], though the British Government refused offers of non-white troops from the Empire. Some [[Cape Coloureds]] also volunteered early in the war, but later some of them were effectively conscripted and kept in segregated units. As a community, they received comparatively little reward for their services. In many ways, the war set the pattern for the Empire's later involvement in the two [[World war|World Wars]]. Specially raised units, consisting mainly of volunteers, were dispatched overseas to serve with forces from elsewhere in the British Empire.\n\nThe United States stayed neutral in the conflict, but some American citizens were eager to participate. Early in the war Lord Roberts cabled the American [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], a veteran of both Matabele wars but at that very moment prospecting in the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Klondike]], to serve on his personal staff as Chief of Scouts. Burnham went on to receive the highest awards of any American who served in the war, but American mercenaries participated on both sides.{{sfn|Farwell|1976}}\n\n=== Australia ===\n\n{{See also|History of the Australian Army#Boer War 1899\u20131902}}\n{{Main|Military history of Australia during the Second Boer War}}\n[[File:Boer War officers P03206.001.jpg|thumb|left|British and Australian officers in South Africa, {{circa|1900}}]]\n\nFrom 1899 to 1901 the six separate [[self-governing colony|self-governing colonies]] in Australia sent their own contingents to serve in the Boer War.

As the war dragged on some Australians became disenchanted, in part because of the sufferings of Boer civilians reported in the press. In an interesting twist (for Australians), when the British missed capturing President Paul Kruger, as he escaped Pretoria during its fall in June 1900, a ''[[Melbourne Punch]]'', 21 June 1900, cartoon depicted how the War could be won, using the [[Kelly Gang]].{{sfn|Wilcox|2002|p=103}}\n\nThe convictions and executions of two Australian lieutenants, [[Breaker Morant|Harry Harbord Morant]], colloquially known as 'The Breaker' for his skill with horses, and [[Peter Handcock]] in 1902, and the imprisonment of a third, [[George Witton]], had little impact on the Australian public at the time despite later legend. The controversial [[court-martial]] saw the three convicted of executing [[Boer]] prisoners under their authority. After the war, though, Australians joined an empire-wide campaign that saw Witton released from jail. Much later, some Australians came to see the execution of Morant and Handcock as instances of wrongfully executed Australians, as illustrated in the 1980 Australian film [[Breaker Morant (film)|''Breaker Morant'']].\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{Wikisource|Canadian Appeal for the Widows and Orphans of the South African War}}\n{{See also|Military history of Canada#Boer War}}\n[[File:1908 Toronto SouthAfrican War Memorial QueenSt.jpg|left|thumb|The unveiling of the ''[[South African War Memorial (Toronto)|South African War Memorial]]'' in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in 1908]]\n\nOver 7,000 Canadian soldiers and support personnel were involved in the second Boer war from October 1899 to May 1902.{{sfn|Webb|2010|pp=75\u201390}} With approximately 7,368<ref name=\"Boer War Remembered\">{{cite web|last=Marshall|first=Robert|title=Boer War Remembered|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/macleans/boer-war-remembered|work=Maclean's}}</ref> soldiers in a combat situation, the conflict became the largest military engagement involving Canadian soldiers from the time of Confederation until the [[Great War]].{{sfn|Webb|2010|pp=75\u201390}} Eventually, 270 of these soldiers died in the course of the Boer War.{{sfn|Webb|2010|pp=75\u201390}}\n\nThe Canadian public was initially divided on the decision to go to war as some citizens did not want Canada to become Britain's 'tool' for engaging in armed conflicts. Many [[English Canadian|Anglophone]] citizens were pro-[[Empire]], and wanted the [[Prime Minister]], [[Sir Wilfrid Laurier]], to support the British in their conflict.

The volunteers were provided to the British if the latter paid costs of the battalion after it arrived in South Africa.{{sfn|Granatstein|2010|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}\n\nThe supporters of the war claimed that it \"pitted British Freedom, justice and civilization against Boer backwardness\".{{sfn|Berger|1970|pp=233\u201334}} The French Canadians' opposition to the Canadian involvement in a British 'colonial venture' eventually led to a three-day riot in various areas of Quebec.<ref name=\"Boer War Remembered\" />\n[[File:HaroldBorden2ndBoerWar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Harold Lothrop Borden]] \u2013 son of the National Minister of Defence and the most famous Canadian casualty of the war]]\n\nCommonwealth involvement in the Boer War can be summarised into three parts. The first part (October 1899 \u2013 December 1899) was characterised by questionable decisions and blunders from the Commonwealth leadership which affected its soldiers greatly. The soldiers of the Commonwealth were shocked at the number of Afrikaner soldiers who were willing to oppose the British. The Afrikaner troops were very willing to fight for their country, and were armed with modern weaponry and were highly mobile soldiers.<ref name=\"South African War\" /> This was one of the best examples of [[Guerrilla]] style warfare, which would be employed throughout the twentieth century after [[Set piece battle|set piece fighting]] was seen as a hindrance by certain groups.{{sfn|Webb|2010|pp=75\u201390}} The Boer soldiers would evade capture and secure provisions from their enemies therefore they were able to exist as a fighting entity for an indeterminate period of time.<ref name=\"The Guerrilla War\">{{cite web|title=The Guerrilla War|url=http://www.anglo-boer.co.za/intro/the-guerrilla-war.php|work=Anglo-Boer War Museum}}</ref>\n\nThe end of the First part was the period in mid-December, referred to as the \"Black Week\". During the week of 10\u201317 December 1899, the British suffered three major defeats at the hands of the Boers at the battlefields of Stormberg, Magersfontein and Colenso. Afterwards, the British called upon more volunteers to take part in the war from the Commonwealth.<ref name=\"Black Week\">{{cite web|last=Rickard|first=J.|title=The Black Week|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/concepts_black_week.html|work=History of War}}</ref>\n\nThe second part of the war (February\u2013April 1900) was the opposite of the first. After the British reorganised and reinforced under new leadership, they began to experience success against the Boer soldiers. [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] soldiers resorted to using blockhouses, farm burning and concentration camps to 'persuade' the resisting Boers into submission.<ref name=\"History of the Boer War\">{{cite web|title=Canada & The South African War, 1899\u20131902|url=http://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/boer/boerwarhistory_e.shtml|work=Canadian War Museum}}</ref>\n\nThe final phase of the war was the guerrilla phase in which many Boer soldiers turned to guerrilla tactics such as raiding infrastructure or communications lines. Many Canadian soldiers did not actually see combat after they had been shipped over to South Africa since many arrived around the time of the signing of the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] on 31 May 1902.<ref name=\"The Peace of Vereeniging\">{{cite web|last=Cavendish|first=Richard|title=The Peace of Vereeniging|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/peace-vereeniging|work=History Today}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Notable Canadian Engagements\n|-\n!

Over 800 Canadian soldiers from Otter's 2nd Special Service Battalion were attached to the British attack force. This was the first major attack involving the Canadians in the Boer War, as well as the first major victory for Commonwealth soldiers. The Canadian soldiers perched on a hill above the Boer camp and were credited with being the main reason that the Boers under General Cronj\u00e9 surrendered.{{sfn|Granatstein|2010|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|Zand River\n|On 6 May 1900, the Commonwealth's northwards advance to the capital of Pretoria was well on its way. However, the British soldiers encountered a position of Boer soldiers on the Zand River. The British commander felt that the best course of action was to use cavalry to envelop the Boers on their left flank and infantry would therefore march on the Boer right flank to secure a crossing. The Canadian 2nd Battalion was the lead unit advancing on the right flank. However, due to disease and casualties from earlier encounters, the 2nd battalion was reduced to approximately half of its initial strength. The Canadian battalion came under fire from the Boers who were occupying protected positions. The battle continued for several hours until the British cavalry was able to flank the Boers and force a retreat. Canadian casualties were two killed and two wounded.

There were large communities of English-speaking immigrants and settlers in [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] and [[Cape Colony]] (especially around [[Cape Town]] and [[Grahamstown]]), which formed volunteer units that took the field, or local \"town guards.\" At one stage of the war, a \"Colonial Division,\" consisting of five light horse and infantry units under Brigadier General [[Edward Brabant]], took part in the invasion of the [[Orange Free State]]. Part of it withstood a siege by Christiaan de Wet at [[Wepener]] on the borders of [[Lesotho|Basutoland]]. Another large source of volunteers was the ''[[uitlander]]'' community, many of whom hastily left [[Johannesburg]] in the days immediately preceding the war.\n\n[[File:Rhodesians leaving Salisbury for Boer War.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rhodesia (region)|Rhodesian]] volunteers leaving [[Harare|Salisbury]] for service in the Second Boer War, 1899]]\nLater during the war, [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] attempted to form a Boer Police Force, as part of his efforts to pacify the occupied areas and effect a reconciliation with the Boer community. The members of this force were despised as traitors by the Boers still in the field. Those Boers who attempted to remain neutral after giving their parole to British forces were derided as ''\"hensoppers\"'' (hands-uppers) and were often coerced into giving support to the Boer guerrillas. (This was one of the reasons for the British ruthlessly scouring the countryside of people, livestock and anything else the Boer commandos might find useful.)\n\nLike the Canadian and particularly the Australian and New Zealand contingents, many of the volunteer units formed by South Africans were \"[[light cavalry|light horse]]\" or [[mounted infantry]], well suited to the countryside and manner of warfare. Some regular British officers scorned their comparative lack of formal discipline, but the light horse units were hardier and more suited to the demands of campaigning than the overloaded British cavalry, who were still obsessed with the charge by lance or sabre.{{efn| British cavalry travelled light compared with earlier campaigns, but were still expected to carry all kit with them on campaign owing to distances covered on the Veldt.}} At their peak, 24,000 South Africans (including volunteers from the Empire) served in the field in various \"colonial\" units.

Holland received his Victoria Cross from the same rear-guard conflict at Leliefontein on 7 November 1900 as Cockburn and Turner.

During the Boer advance, Holland kept the Boer soldiers at bay with his carriage-mounted Colt machine gun, despite the position becoming increasingly dangerous due to the proximity of the enemy. With his gun jammed and in danger of falling into enemy hands, Holland removed the Colt from its carriage and rode away on his horse with the gun in hand.{{sfn|Pulsifer|2017}}\n\n== Final overview ==\nThe Second Boer War was the harbinger of a new type of combat which would persevere throughout the twentieth century, guerrilla warfare.{{sfn|Webb|2010|pp=75\u201390}} After the war was over, the entire British army underwent a period of reform which was focused on lessening the emphasis placed on mounted units in combat.<ref name=\"Reconnaissance and the British Cavalry 1899-1914\">{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Spencer|title=Scouting for Soldiers:Reconnaissance and the British Cavalry 1899\u20131914|journal=War in History|volume=18|issue=4|pages=495\u2013513|year=2011|doi=10.1177/0968344511417348}}</ref> It was determined that the traditional role of [[cavalry]] was antiquated and improperly used on the battlefield in the modern warfare of the Boer War, and that the First World War was the final proof that mounted attacks had no place in twentieth century combat.<ref name=\"Reconnaissance and the British Cavalry 1899-1914\" /> Cavalry was put to better use after the reforms in the theatres of the Middle East and World War I, and that the idea of [[mounted infantry]] was useful in the times where the war was more mobile.<ref name=\"Reconnaissance and the British Cavalry 1899-1914\" /> An example was during the First World War during the [[Battle of Mons]] in which the British cavalry held the Belgian town against an initial German assault.

Later on, contingents of Canadians served with the paramilitary South Africa Constabulary. Both sides used a [[scorched Earth]] policy to deprive the marching enemy of food.  And both had to corral civilians into makeshift huts by 'concentrating them camps.<ref name=\"South African War\" /> For example, at [[Buffelspoort]], British soldiers were held in captivity in Boer encampments after surrendering their arms, and civilians were often mixed in with service personnel because the Boer did not have the resources to do otherwise.  A total of 116,000 women, children and Boer soldiers were confined to the Commonwealth concentration camps, of which at least 28,000, mainly women and children, would die.{{sfn|Pulsifer|2017}} The lack of food, water, and sanitary provisions was a feature of 20th-century warfare for both civilians and armed services personnel, yet one consequence of the Boer War and investigative commissions was the implementation of The Hague Convention (1899) and Geneva Convention (1904); of which there were many further agreements thereafter.\n\n=== Views on British tactics ===\nThe British saw their tactics of [[Scorched Earth]] and [[concentration camp]]s as ways of controlling the Boers by \"eliminating the decay and deterioration of the national character\" and as a way of reinforcing the values, through subjugation of citizens and the destruction of the means for the Boer soldiers to continue fighting, of British society that the Boers were rejecting by engaging in a war against the Commonwealth.{{sfn|Berger|1970|pp=233\u201334}} The Boers saw them as a British ploy designed to coerce the Boer soldiers into a surrender.

''who did more than any other to hold together the diversity of first-century Christianity.'' James the brother of Jesus, and Paul of Tarsus, the two other most prominent leading figures in first-century Christianity, were too much identified with their respective \"brands\" of Christianity, at least in the eyes of Christians at the opposite ends of this particular spectrum. But Peter, as shown particularly by the Antioch episode in {{Bibleref2|Galatians|2}}, had both a care to hold firm to his Jewish heritage\u2014which Paul lacked\u2014and an openness to the demands of developing Christianity, which James lacked. John might have served as a figure of the center holding together the extremes, but if the writings linked with his name are at all indicative of his own stance, he was too much of an individualist to provide such a rallying point. Others could link the developing new religion more firmly to its founding events and to Jesus himself. But none of them, including the rest of the twelve, seem to have played any role of continuing significance for the whole sweep of Christianity\u2014though James the brother of John might have proved an exception had he been spared.\" [Italics original] [[James Dunn (theologian)|Dunn, James D.G.]] ''The Canon Debate''. McDonald & Sanders editors, 2002, ch. 32, p. 577.</ref>\n\n== Matthew 16:18 ==\n\nControversy has surrounded one particular text that is linked with the Aramaic nickname name \u05db\u05e4\u05d0 (''Cepha''), meaning \"rock,\" that Jesus gave the man previously known as Simon.{{Bibleref2c|John|1:42}} The Greeks translated it as \u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''Petros''), a new form, appropriately masculine, of the standard feminine word \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 (''petra''), also meaning \"rock;\" and the Latins translated it as ''Petrus''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cephas |title=Cephas - Dictionary.com - Reference.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>\n\nWhile the reasons for disagreement on the nature of the primacy are complex, hinging on matters of doctrine, history and politics, the debate is often reduced to a discussion of the meaning and translation of Matthew 16:18: \"And I say to thee: That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\" {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16:18, Douay-Rheims Bible}}\n\nIn the [[Greek language|Greek]] text, the new name given is \u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''Petros''), and in the second half of the same verse the word translated as \"rock\" is \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 (''petra''). A literal translation, in the style of the [[King James Version]], of the words presumably used by Jesus would be \"Thou art Rock, and upon this rock will I build my church\".<ref>In [[French language|French]], the translation, \"Tu es ''Pierre'', et sur cette ''pierre'' je b\u00e2tirai mon \u00c9glise, et les portes de l'enfer ne pr\u00e9vaudront point contre elle\" preserves exactly the play on words in what is believed to be the original Aramaic.</ref> To preserve a supposed pun, the Greek text chose to translate Peter's name as \"\u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\" rather than as \"\u039a\u03b7\u03c6\u1fb6\u03c2\" (Cephas).\n\nOne common Protestant argument historically has been that the translation from the [[New Testament]] in Hebrew into Greek is tenuous at best as there is no real evidence or indication that the New Testament (in Greek) was ever translated from Hebrew or Aramaic texts; for that argument see [[Aramaic primacy]]. According to the Protestant transliteration argument,{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} in the [[Aramaic of Jesus|language that Jesus spoke]], the same word, \u05db\u05e4\u05d0 (cepha), was used for both Peter's name and for the rock on which Jesus said he would build his church. Since the [[Protestant Reformation]], many non-Catholics, in disagreement with the historic Catholic Church view, have disputed whether the feminine \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 refers to Peter, claiming it instead refers to either Peter's confession of faith or to Jesus himself.<ref name=Engler>John Engler. \"The Rock-Foundation of Matthew 16:17-20\". <http://www.greatcommission.com/Matthew161720.html> Accessed 12 Mar 2013</ref><ref name=Stagg>Stagg, Frank. ''New Testament Theology''. Broadman Press, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}</ref>\n\n==Catholic view on relationship to the Church today==\n{{Papal primacy and infallibility|expanded=overview}}\n\nIn [[Catholicism]], it is argued that the primacy of Peter is a basis for the primacy of the bishop of Rome over other [[bishops]] throughout the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]. This extension of Petrine primacy to popes is known as the [[primacy of the Bishop of Rome]], also known as the primacy of the Roman Pontiff. This Catholic Church doctrine holds that the [[pope|papacy]] has authority delegated from Jesus to rule over the [[Christendom|entire Church]]. There are various views on the nature of the primacy and how it has been exercised and [[Apostolic succession|passed on]]. This belief makes a distinction between the personal prestige of Peter and the supremacy of the office of [[pope]] which Catholics believe Jesus instituted in the person of Peter. Protestants do not believe the pope holds any authority over the [[Christian Church|universal Church]].\n\nSome [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] believe that [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Saint Paul saw Judaism]] as the [[Typology (theology)|type]] or figure of [[Christianity]]: \"Now all these things happened to [the Jews] in figure....\"{{bibleref2c|1Cor|10:11||1 Cor. 10:11}} In the [[613 Mitzvot|Old Law]], {{bibleref2|Deut.|17:8-12}} attributes to the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] the highest jurisdiction in religious matters. Therefore, it is argued, logic suggests that a supreme head would be necessary in the Christian Church,{{cn|date=August 2019}} though the relevance of [[Biblical law in Christianity]] is still disputed; see also [[New Covenant]] and [[The New Commandment|New Commandment]]. Furthermore, it is typically the local bishop who is considered the high priest of his flock, rather than the pope alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a6.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sacrament of Holy Orders|website=www.va|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], which some call the ''New Law'' or \"New Greek Testament\",<ref>Knight, Kevin. \"Question 106. The law of the Gospel, called the New Law, considered in itself.\" ''New Advent.'' Sept. 11, 2009: http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2106.htm</ref> {{bibleref2|Matthew|16:16-18}} reports that Jesus changed Simon's name to Peter. Elsewhere in Scripture such a name change always denotes some change in status (e.g., Abram to Abraham, Jacob to Israel, and Saul to Paul).\n\nJesus also said to Peter in verse 19, \"I will give to thee the [[Keys of Heaven|keys of the kingdom of heaven]].\" Especially for the Hebrew people, keys were a symbol of authority. Indeed, Jesus declares in the [[Book of Revelation]], that He has the \"keys of death and hell,\" which means that He has power over death and hell; {{Bibleref2|Isaiah|22:21-22}} also supports this. [[James Gibbons|Cardinal Gibbons]], in his book ''The Faith of Our Fathers'', points out that keys are still a symbol of authority in today's culture; he uses the example of someone giving the keys of his house to another person, and that the latter represented the owner of the house in his absence. In receiving the keys, Peter takes on the office of [[prime minister]], which was well-known to ancient and contemporary Hebrews, and depicted in the Old Testament, as the one who had authority from the King to bind and loose.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/pope/hahn.asp|title=Dr Scott Hahn on the Papacy {{!}} Catholic-Pages.com|website=www.catholic-pages.com|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/resources/apologetics/catholic-doctrines-and-practices/st-peter-and-the-popes|title=St. Peter and the Popes|website=Catholic News Agency|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\nAnother source indicating Peter's supremacy can be found in {{Bibleref2|John|21:15-17}} where Christ tells Peter three times to \"feed His sheep\" and \"feed His lambs.\" The \"sheep\" might be understood to be the stronger portion of Jesus' flock (the [[clergy]]), and the \"lambs\" as the weaker portion (the [[laity]]). From this, Catholics believe that Peter was given charge over Christ's whole flock, that is, the [[Catholic Church|Church]].\n\nMoreover, Peter is always named first in all listings of the Apostles; [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] is invariably mentioned last. In {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:2}} Peter is described as the \"first Apostle\". It is important to note that Peter was neither the first Apostle in age nor election; therefore, Peter must be the first Apostle in the sense of authority, if one ignores the possibility of him being first in the sense of first in the list of Twelve Apostles.{{bibleref2c|Mk.|3:16}} {{bibleref2c|Mt.|4:18-19}} According to {{bibleref2|Acts|1-2,10-11,15}}, St. Peter was the leader of the early Christian church in Jerusalem. Jesus also instructed St. Peter to strengthen his brethren, i.e., the apostles, according to {{bibleref2|Luke|22:31-32}}.\n\nBoth Latin and Greek writers in the early church (such as the St. [[John Chrysostom]]) referred to \"rock\" as applying to both Peter personally and his faith symbolically, as well as seeing Christ's promise to apply more generally to his twelve apostles and the Church at large.<ref name=\"Veselin Kesich 1992 61\u201366\">{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |pages= 61\u201366}}</ref>\n\n[[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council I]] defined the primacy of the bishop of Rome over the whole Catholic Church as an essential institution of the Church that can never be relinquished. This primacy is thus crucial to the understanding of the church from a Catholic viewpoint. At the same time, the history of papal primacy has always been imperfect and much-debated.<ref>Schatz, Klaus.  Papal Primacy: From Its Origins to the Present.  Translated by John A. Otto and Linda M. Maloney.  Collegeville, MN: The Liturgical Press, 1996.  p. x.</ref> This is reflected in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]:\n\n{{quote|'''424'''  Moved by the grace of the Holy Spirit and drawn by the Father, we believe in Jesus and confess: \"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" On the rock of this faith confessed by St. Peter, Christ built his Church.|author=|title=|source=}}\n\n{{quote|'''552'''  Simon Peter holds the first place in the college of the Twelve; Jesus entrusted a unique mission to him. Through a revelation from the Father, Peter had confessed: \"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" Our Lord then declared to him: \"You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.\" Christ, the \"living Stone\", thus assures his Church, built on Peter, of victory over the powers of death. Because of the faith he confessed Peter will remain the unshakable rock of the Church. His mission will be to keep this faith from every lapse and to strengthen his brothers in it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1D.HTM#-F1 |title=Cathecism of the Catholic Church |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=2012-07-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623214259/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1D.HTM#-F1 |archivedate=2012-06-23 }}</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nRegarding the Catholic interpretation of Matthew 16:18-19, [[Jaroslav Pelikan]] writes:<ref>{{cite book |last= Pelikan |first= Jaroslav |authorlink= Jaroslav Pelikan |editor= |others= |title= The Riddle of Roman Catholicism |year= 1959 |publisher= Abingdon Press |location= New York |page= 78}}</ref> \"As Roman Catholic scholars now concede, the ancient Christian father Cyprian used it to prove the authority of the bishop\u2014not merely of the Roman bishop, but of every bishop,\" referring to Maurice Bevenot's work on St. Cyprian.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bevenot |first= Maurice | title= St. Cyprian: The Lapsed, The Unity of the Catholic Church |pages= 6\u20138}}</ref>\n\n[[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]] agree with the above, but also consider Peter to be representative of all bishops. In this, they represent a middle-ground between the Catholic position and that of the [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] in the next section.\n\nThough among the Twelve Peter is predominant in the first chapters of [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[James the Just|James \"the brother of the Lord\"]] is shown to be a leader in his own right in later chapters, indeed he is commonly considered the first [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem#Bishops of Jerusalem|Bishop of Jerusalem]]. Some assume James outranks Peter because he speaks last in the [[Council of Jerusalem]] and suggests the final ruling (concerning Gentile converts and Jewish practices such as [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]]) agreed upon by all, and because Paul mentions him before Peter and John when he calls them \"pillars of the church\" in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]. James was indeed the first bishop or [[patriarch]] of Jerusalem according to tradition. However, Catholics believe the bishop of Jerusalem was not by that fact the head of the Christian church, since the leadership rested in Peter as the \"Rock\" and \"Chief Shepherd\".<ref>Mckenzie, John L. ''The Dictionary of the Bible'' (Catholic)</ref> It is believed Peter entrusted the Jerusalem community to James when he was forced to leave Jerusalem due to [[Herod Agrippa]]'s persecution. {{bibleref2c|Acts|12}}<ref>''The Navarre Bible'', footnotes</ref>\n\nHowever, at the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15, James uses the Greek ''exegesato'' to refer to Peter's statements, which refers to literally \"declaring\" or \"issuing a ruling.\" <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EvQJ_i7J4CEC&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=exegesato+james&source=bl&ots=0T7FZfHbub&sig=MSPr7qcxxSLvgY1BDHdUgA3xu4g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj3mbqave7JAhUJlB4KHTVgDV0Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=exegesato%20james&f=false The Biblical Basis for the Papacy] by John Salza</ref> However, James uses the Greek word ''akouoo'' in relation to his statements, which refers to literally \"giving one's opinion,\" and does not denote authority. Catholic scholar Michael M. Winter puts it in his ''Saint Peter and the Popes'' in the following terms: \"The speech of St. James is of a different character [from that of St. Peter]. He acquiesces to what St. Peter had said, although it seems to have been against his personal inclinations, and then puts forward a practical suggestion for the sake of harmony.\"\n\nThe Fourth Century Latin Father St. Jerome, in his epistle to St. Augustine of Hippo, wrote that \"nay more, that Peter was the prime mover in issuing the decree by which this was affirmed,\" in relation to the Council of Jerusalem, and again, \"and to his opinion the Apostle James, and all the elders together, gave consent.\" <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1102075.htm</ref>\n\nThis view is likewise echoed by Saint John Chrysostom, the Fourth Century Patriarch of Constantinople:\n\n{{quote|And why, then, passing by the others, does He converse with Peter on these things? (John 21:15). He was the chosen one of the Apostles, and the mouth of the disciples, and the leader of the choir. On this account, Paul also went up on a time to see him rather than the others (Galatians 1:18). And withal, to show him that he must thenceforward have confidence, as the denial was done away with, He puts into his hands the presidency over the brethren. And He brings not forward the denial, nor reproaches him with what had past, but says, \"If you love me, preside over the brethren.\" ...And the third time He gives him the same injunction, showing what a price He sets the presidency over His own sheep. And if one should say, \"How then did James receive the throne of Jerusalem?,\" this I would answer that He appointed this man (Peter) teacher, not of that throne, but of the whole world.<ref>http://www.catholicbridge.com/catholic/orthodox/pope_acts_15_james_and_peter.php</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nFor Catholics, the fact that the new name for Simon is Peter is in fact itself very significant. In the Old Testament God is frequently referred to as a Rock or stone. Jesus refers to himself as the cornerstone. The Book of Daniel contains a prophecy that a Rock or stone from the mountain of God (heaven) will come down to earth and destroy the pagan kings. The rock will then grow itself until it covers the entire earth. Protestants consider this prophecy to allude to the [[end times]] but Catholics consider the prophecy to refer specifically to Jesus as the Rock from Heaven. Further, Catholics see the fact that the Rock does not leave but stays to until it covers the entire earth to mean that the Church, built of the Rock of Peter, is the [[body of Christ]], the Rock from Heaven, and that the Rock will eventually cover the entire Earth which is why the term Catholic (universal or worldwide) is the most common designation for the Catholic Church.\n\n===Individuals and documents supporting Roman primacy===\n\n====Irenaeus====\n[[Irenaeus]] has been called the most important witness of the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|Christianity of the 2nd century]].<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 6.</ref> Taught by [[Polycarp]], who had been instructed by John the apostle, Irenaeus became [[Bishop of Lyon]] in 178. In his ''Against the Heresies'', Irenaeus wrote, \"Although there are many dialects in the world, the force of the tradition is one and the same. For the same faith is held and handed down by the churches established in the German states, the Spains, among the Celtic tribes, in the East, in Libya, and in the central portions of the world.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 8.</ref> In Book 3, Irenaeus continues his defense of the unity of the church around the bishop, writing, \"By pointing out the apostolic tradition and faith announced to mankind, which has been brought down to our time by successions of bishops, in the greatest, most ancient, and well known church, founded and established by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul, at Rome, we can confound all who in any other way \u2026 gather more than they ought.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 9.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus asserted the Doctrine of Apostolic Succession to counter the claims of heretics, especially the Gnostics who were attacking the theology and authority of the mainstream Church. He stated that one could find true teaching in several leading episcopal sees, not just at Rome. The doctrine he asserted, therefore, has two parts: lineage from the Apostles and right teaching. Even today a bishop can be in the line of succession, but schismatic and heretical as is the case with many episcopi vagantes who claim to or may have Catholic Orders, but have no following and have deviated from the Catholic orthodox faith as defined by the larger denominations such as the Orthodox, Anglicans, Catholics and Lutherans.\n\n====Ignatius of Antioch====\n[[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]], bishop of Antioch, was well known for his insistence on the authority of the bishop. In his writings to the church at [[Smyrna]] in 115 AD, he encouraged the Smyrnaeans to \"Avoid divisions, as the beginning of evil. Follow, all of you, the bishop, as Jesus Christ followed the father; and follow the presbytery as the apostles. Let no man do aught pertaining to the Church apart from the bishop. Wheresoever the bishop appears, there let the people be, even as wheresoever Christ Jesus is, there is the Catholic Church.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 4.</ref>\n\n====Tertullian====\nBorn in [[Carthage]] around 155 AD, [[Tertullian]] became a priest around the age of forty and worked tirelessly to defend the faith. In his ''Scorpiace'' of 208 AD, Tertullian wrote, \"No delay or inquest will meet Christians on the threshold. \u2026For though you think that heaven is still shut up, remember that the Lord left the keys of it to Peter here, and through him to the Church, which keys everyone will carry with him, if he has been questioned and made confession [of faith].\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 23.</ref> ''Scorpiace'' is the first known historical reference to the keys pertaining to anyone other than Peter. In it, he saw the keys as pertaining to \"everyone\" if they \"made confession\", rather than according to the modern interpretation concerning the bishops of Rome alone. Tertullian later retracted even this association in De Pudecitia,<ref>Schaff, Philip., American Ed., 1994. Alexander Roberts, D.D. & James Donaldson, LL.D. with notes by A. Cleveland Coxe, D.D..

Published online at http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.iii.viii.xxi.html</ref> listing various reasons why the Keys of Peter pertained to Peter alone. The churches later declared him an apostate along with the followers of Montanus for insisting that authority must be associated with demonstrable power.\n\n====Cyprian====\n[[Cyprian|Thascius Caecilius Cyprianus]] was made bishop of Carthage in 248 AD. but died only ten years later. Throughout his writings, Cyprian asserts that the Rock is Peter, and the Church rests upon him. He also claims that as the Church is settled upon the bishops, they too have authority. He writes, \"They, who have departed from the Church, do not allow the Church to recall and bring back the lapsed. There is one God, and one Christ, and one Church, and one chair founded by the voice of the Lord on the rock. Another altar cannot be set up, nor a new priesthood made, besides the one altar and the one priesthood. Whoever gathers elsewhere scatters.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. pp. 29-30.</ref> In his 251 AD ''De Catholicae Ecclesiae Unitate'', Cyprian asks, \"He who deserts the chair of Peter, upon whom the Church was founded, does he trust himself to be in the Church?\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 53.</ref>\n\n====John Chrysostom====\n[[John Chrysostom]] was born at [[Antioch]] around 347 and would fight for the reform of the Church until his exile in 404. His homilies emphasize his belief in the primacy. He called Peter \"the leader of the choir, the mouth of all the apostles, the head of that tribe, the ruler of the whole world, the foundation of the Church, the ardent lover of Christ.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 126.</ref> His writings also emphasize the mortality of Peter, linking him more closely to the people of the Church.\n\n====Augustine of Hippo====\n[[Saint Augustine]] was born in [[Numidia]] in 354 AD and was baptized in [[Milan]] in 387 AD. He was also bishop of Hippo from 397 AD til his death in 430 AD. Augustine taught that Peter was first amongst the apostles, and thus represents the church.<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 163.</ref> His ''Sermo'' states, \"Peter in many places in the Scriptures appears to represent the Church, especially in that place where it was said 'I give to thee the keys \u2026 shall be loosed in heaven'. What! did Peter receive these keys, and Paul not receive? Did Peter receive and John and James not receive, and the rest of the apostles? But since in a figure Peter represented the Church, what was given to him singly was given to the Church.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 175.</ref> His 395 A.D. ''Contra Epistolam Manichaei'' states, \"There are many other things which rightly keep me in the bosom of the Catholic Church. \u2026The succession of the priests keeps me, from the very seat of the apostle Peter (to whom the Lord after his resurrection gave charge to feed his sheep) down to the present episcopate.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 182.</ref>\n\n====Pope Innocent I====\n[[Pope Innocent I|Innocent I]] held the papal office from 402 to 417. Modern theories of papal primacy developed around Innocent and his writings. In a 416 AD letter to [[Decentius]], bishop of Eugubium, Innocent writes, \"Who does not know or observe that it [the church order] was delivered by Peter the chief of the apostles to the Roman church, and is kept until now, and ought to be retained by all, and that nothing ought to be imposed or introduced which has no authority, or seems to derive its precedents elsewhere?\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 194.</ref> It is also during this time that bishops began to recognize Innocent's primacy as Pope over other bishops in the West. This is made evident, among others, in a letter from the Council at Mileve to Innocent in 416 AD, which alludes to the authority of \"his holiness\" drawn from the authority of Scripture.<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 198.</ref> The doctrine of primacy was beginning to take shape with Innocent's papacy.\n\n====Pope Leo I====\nBased on his knowledge of the Petrine texts of the Gospel, and his writings which expound upon it, it is easy to see that [[Pope Leo I|Leo I]] identified with the authority bestowed on Peter as bishop of Rome. Leo himself was consecrated bishop of Rome in 440 AD. He writes that \"The right of this power did indeed pass on to other apostles, and the order of this decree passed on to all the chiefs of the Church; but not in vain was that which was imparted to all entrusted to but one. Therefore this is commended to Peter separately, because all the rulers of the Church are invested with the figure of Peter. \u2026So then in Peter the strength of all is fortified, and the help of divine grace is so ordered that the stability which through Christ is given to Peter, through Peter is conveyed to the apostles.\" The [[Council of Chalcedon]] would later refer to Leo as \"him who had been charged with the custody of the vine by the savior.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. pp. 280, 323.</ref>\n\n====Pope Gregory VII====\nThe [[Gregorian Reform|Gregorian Reform movement]] was rather a series of movements many of which involved the reform of the Catholic Church, headed by [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], formerly the Archdeacon Hildebrand. Gregory became Pope in 1073 with the objective of reforming not the body of the church, but a purification of the clergy in general.<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 101.</ref> Gregory is perhaps most recognized with the quarrel between himself and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|King Henry IV]] of Germany, known as the \"[[Investiture Contest]]\". Gregory's ''Dictus Pape'' outlines his policies and ideals, as well as those of the Catholic Church. In this work, Gregory claims that the pope has power to depose and restore bishops, and also effectively reduces the authority of other bishops.<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 129.</ref> This doctrine supported the idea that Rome and the church here also afforded primacy over all other churches. Gregory's papacy also bolstered the power of the Church over that of the State. The Gregorians defended the ideal of a separation of powers, claiming \"Let kings have what belongs to kings, and priests have what belongs to priests.\"<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 133.</ref> The Petrine primacy was now more affirmed than ever.\n\n===Challenges===\n\n====Councils====\nMany challenges faced the Popes claiming primacy throughout the history of Catholicism. The [[Edict of Milan]], the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]], and the [[First Council of Constantinople]] all dealt with the issue of primacy in that they amended the power of the popes over the other bishops. The third canon of the First Council of Constantinople of 381 AD declares Constantinople the new Rome, gives the Bishop of Rome the seat of honor and gives the Bishop of Constantinople second place in honor. The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431 AD offers debate as to whether the results determine that the Pope is at the head of the Church, or rather that it is under the authority of a council of bishops (Giles, 238-256 AD).<ref>Giles, E., ed. Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454. London: S.P.C.K., 1952. Pp. 238-256.</ref> Although the highlight of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 AD was the confession of the [[Person of Christ]], the Council also resulted in limitations to the powers of the bishops. Many letters of the Council identify its position as in agreement with papal primacy. Those present employ titles such as \"the most holy and beloved of God\" and \"ecumenical archbishop and patriarch of great Rome\" to address Pope Leo. Thus, as not all can be satisfied with the results, the Council of Chalcedon resulted in a schism with the Oriental Orthodox Church.<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 297-321.</ref>\n\n====Schism====\nInternally, people questioned who rightfully was pope, while others wondered as to the role the pope was to play outside of Rome.<ref>Logan, F. Donald.  A History of the Church in the Middle Ages.  New York: Routledge, 2002. p. 133.</ref> The papacy's most widely known crisis, as well as its largest challenge to authority, came with the \"[[Western Schism]]\" in the late Middle Ages, dating from 1378\u20131417.<ref>Schatz, Klaus.

The Cardinals called the election into question and elected [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]] as Pope. Germany, Italy, England, and the rest of Northern and Eastern Europe remained loyal to Urban, while France, Spain, Scotland, and Rome followed Clement VII (1378\u20131394) and his successor, [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] (1394&ndash;1417) who would reside in Avignon.\n\n==Eastern Orthodox view on relationship to the Church today==\n\n===Many hold the ''Primacy'' of Peter===\n[[File:StPeter-RussianMuseum.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of St. Peter (15th century, [[Russian State Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg]]).]]\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] regards the Apostle Peter, together with the Apostle Paul, as \"preeminent apostles\". Another title used for Peter is ''Coryphaeus'', which could be translated as \"Choir-director,\" or lead singer.<ref>[[John Meyendorff]], et al.

In this traditional Orthodox and Patristic view, the Church is the local Eucharistic assembly (\"the diocese\" in today's terminology) and the one who holds the \"Chair of Peter\" (St. Cyprian's expression) is the bishop. As a result, the primacy of Peter is relevant to the relationship between the bishop and the presbyters, not between the bishop of Rome and the other bishops who are all equally holding Peter's chair.\n\nAs John Meyendorff explained:\n\n{{quote|A very clear patristic tradition sees the succession of Peter in the episcopal ministry. The doctrine of St Cyprian of Carthage on the \"See of Peter\" being present in every local Church, and not only in Rome, is well-known. It is also found in the East, among people who certainly never read the De unitate ecclesia of Cyprian, but who share its main idea, thus witnessing to it as part of the catholic tradition of the Church. St Gregory of Nyssa, for example, affirms that Christ \"through Peter gave to the bishops the keys of the heavenly honors,\" and the author of the Areopagitica, when speaking of the \"hierarchs\" of the Church, refers immediately to the image of St Peter. A careful analysis of ecclesiastical literature both Eastern and Western, of the first millennium, including such documents as the lives of the saint, would certainly show that this tradition was a persistent one; and indeed it belongs to the essence of Christian ecclesiology to consider any local bishop to be the teacher of his flock and therefore to fulfill sacramentally, through apostolic succession, the office of the first true believer, Peter... There exists, however, another succession, equally recognized by Byzantine theologians, but only on the level of the analogy existing between the apostolic college and the episcopal college, this second succession being determined by the need for ecclesiastical order. Its limits are determined by the Councils, and - in the Byzantine practice \u2013 by the \"very pious emperors.\"|''The Primacy of Peter'', p. 89}}\n\nThe notion that many [[Episcopal see|Sees]] were \u2018\u2019of Peter\u2019\u2019 had also once been held in the West:\n\n[[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]]\n{{quote|Your most sweet Holiness has spoken much in your letter to me about the chair of Saint Peter, Prince of the apostles, saying that he himself now sits on it in the persons of his successors...Wherefore though there are many apostles, yet with regard to the principality itself the See of the Prince of the apostles alone has grown strong in authority, which in three places is the See of one...He himself stablished (sic) the See in which, though he was to leave it, he sat for seven years.

However, the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul.\n\nThe Orthodox also consider that [[Pope Linus|St. Linus]], not Peter, was actually the first [[Bishop of Rome]].\n{{quote|Of the church of Rome, Linus the son of Claudia was the first, ordained by Paul; and Clemens (Clement), after Linus' death, the second, ordained by me Peter.<ref>\u2019\u2019Apostolic Teaching and Constitutions\u2019\u2019, Book 7, Chapter XLVI \u2013 \"Who Were They that the Holy Apostles Sent and Ordained?\"</ref>}}\n\n===''Keys'' and ''rock'' not exclusive to Peter===\n[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] theologians agree that in {{bibleref2|Matthew|16:18}}, \"rock\" is a likely reference to Peter personally since the very name \"Peter\" means \"rock.\".<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |pages= 47\u201348}}</ref> However {{bibleref2|Matthew|18:18}} implies that the other Apostles were given the same powers.

There were no positions of power between the twelve, only \"degrees of intimacy\" or \"degrees of honor.\" According to this view, Peter has a weak symbolic primacy or primacy of honor (in the sense of a purely honorary primacy). In the patristic era, this was actually the Western view held by St Augustine.

Further if Peter's pronouncement was authoritative then Paul speaking afterwards would be superfluous; given that the 'decision' had already been made.\n\nEquality of all the Apostles is shown in {{bibleref2|Ephesians|2:19-20}}; that all the Apostles together are the foundation of the church.\n\n{{bibleref2|Galatians|2:7}} shows that Paul taught in the same terms as Peter did.\n\nThe ''forgiveness of sins'' (one of the powers of ''the keys'') is granted to many {{bibleref2|John|20:23}} and, {{bibleref2|Matthew|18:19}}.\n\n===Examples from history===\nOrthodox historians also maintain that Rome's authority in the early Eastern Roman (or Byzantine) empire was recognized only partially because of Rome's Petrine character, and that this factor was not the decisive issue. Moreover, the Orthodox view is that Rome's privileges were not understood as an absolute power (i.e., the difference between primacy and supremacy). In the East, there were numerous \"apostolic sees\", Jerusalem being considered the \"mother of all churches,\" and the bishop of Antioch could also claim the title of successor to Peter, being that Peter was the first [[List of Patriarchs of Antioch|bishop of Antioch]]. \"Canon 28 of [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] was for [the Byzantines] one of the essential texts for the organization of the Church: 'It is for right reasons that the accorded privileges to old Rome, for this city was the seat of the Emperor and the Senate.' ... The reason why the Roman Church had been accorded an incontestable precedence over all other apostolic churches was that its Petrine and Pauline 'apostolicity' was in fact added to the city's position as the capital city, and only the conjunction of both of these elements gave the Bishop of Rome the right to occupy the place of a primate in the Christian world with the consensus of all the churches.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |page= 68}}</ref>\n\n==Protestant views on relationship to the Church today==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 400\n\n | image1 = Saint Raphael Catholic Church (Springfield, Ohio) - stained glass, Upon this Rock, detail - St. Peter's Basilica.jpg\n | caption1 = Stained glass window in a Catholic church depicting [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome sitting \"Upon this rock,\" a reference to [[:s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 16|Matthew 16]]:18.

However he refers to the \"rock\" as ''petra''. The inspired New Testament Scriptures were written in Greek, not Aramaic. [[Aramaic of Jesus|What Jesus ''might'' have said in Aramaic]] is conjecture.

Moreover the underlying Aramaic is in this case unquestionable; and most probably ''kepha'' was used in both clauses (\"you are ''kepha''\" and \"on this ''kepha''\"), since the word was used both for a name and for a \"rock\". The Peshitta (written in Syriac, a language cognate with Aramaic) makes no distinction between the words in the two clauses. The Greek makes the distinction between ''petros'' and ''petra'' simply because it is trying to preserve the pun, and in Greek the feminine ''petra'' could not very well serve as a masculine name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.stargate.net/~elcore/kephas.htm |title=Who is the Rock? |publisher=Users.stargate.net |accessdate=2012-07-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216055823/http://users.stargate.net/~elcore/kephas.htm |archivedate=2012-02-16 }}</ref>}}\n\nAn alternate Protestant argument is that when Jesus said \"upon this rock\" in the aforementioned Matthew verse, he referred to himself, in reference to {{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|32:3-4}}, which states that \"God...is the Rock, his work is perfect\". This idea also appears in {{Bibleref2|1 Corinthians|10:4}}, which says \"...that Rock is Christ.\" In {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|2:20}}, Jesus is called \"the chief cornerstone\".\n\n===Meaning of \"Rock\"===\n\nIn the original [[Greek language|Greek]] the word translated as \"Peter\" is ''\u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2'' (Petros) and that translated as \"rock\" is ''\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1'' (petra), two words that, while not identical, give an impression of one of many times when Jesus used a play on words.

In classical Attic Greek ''petros'' generally meant \"pebble,\" while ''petra'' meant \"boulder\" or \"cliff.\" Accordingly, taking Peter's name to mean \"pebble,\" they argue that the \"rock\" in question cannot have been Peter, but something else, either Jesus himself, or the faith in Jesus that Peter had just professed. However, the New Testament was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek, not Attic Greek, and some authorities say no significant difference existed between the meanings of ''petros'' and ''petra''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[File:Gesupietrochiave.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter'', by [[Pietro Perugino]] (1481\u201382)]]\nHowever, even though the feminine noun ''petra'' is translated as ''rock'' in the phrase \"on this rock I will build my church,\" the word ''petra'' (\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 in Greek) is also used at {{Bibleref2|1Cor|10:4||1 Cor. 10:4}} in describing Jesus Christ, which reads: \"They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.\"\n\nAlthough {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16}} is used as a primary proof-text for the Catholic doctrine of Papal supremacy, Protestant scholars say that prior to the Reformation of the sixteenth century, Matthew 16 was very rarely used to support papal claims. Their position is that most of the early and medieval Church interpreted the 'rock' as being a reference either to Christ or to Peter's faith, not Peter himself. They understand Jesus' remark to have been his affirmation of Peter's testimony that Jesus was the Son of God.<ref>Mathison, Keith A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=w_PHAGr2TfgC ''The Shape of Sola Scriptura''], pp.184\u2013185</ref>\n\nAnother rebuttal of the Catholic position is that if ''Peter'' really means ''the Rock'' which makes him the chief of Apostles, it would contradict Bible's teaching in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|2:20}} which says that the church's foundation is the apostles and prophets, not Peter alone. They posit that the meaning of {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16:18}} is that Jesus uses a play on words with Peter's name to say that the confession he had just made is the rock on which the church is built.<ref name=WELS-ROCK>{{cite web |url=http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=813&cuItem_itemID=24624 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090927075835/http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=813&cuItem_itemID=24624 |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 September 2009 |work=WELS Topical Q&A |title=Matthew 16:18 - Peter, This Rock |publisher=Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod |accessdate=16 Mar 2017 }}</ref>\n\nOther theologically conservative Christians, including Confessional Lutherans, also rebut comments made by Karl Keating and D.A.

The Lutheran theologians<ref>Danker, Frederick W., ''The concise Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament'', p. 282.</ref> state that the dictionaries of [[Koine Greek|Koine/NT Greek]], including the authoritative<ref>Rykle Borger, \"Remarks of an Outsider about Bauer's Worterbuch, BAGD, BDAG, and Their Textual Basis,\" Biblical Greek Language and Lexicography: Essays in Honor of Frederick W.

He disagrees with Luther and the Protestant reformers who held that by \"rock\" Christ did not mean Peter, but meant either himself or the faith of His followers. He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that \"Kepha\" was the Aramaic word for \"rock\", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.<ref name=Time/>\n\nYet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"<ref name=Time>\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html Religion: Peter & the Rock.]\" \"Time,\" Dec. 07, 1953. Accessed Oct. 08, 2009</ref>\n\nCullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.<ref name=Time/>\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\"<ref>D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).</ref> Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or ''this same'', when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]] believes in the re-established Apostle ministry. It sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]] in the [[Early Church]].\n\n===Lutheran view===\nFrom the ''[[Book of Concord]]'': {{quote|Chrysostom says thus: \"Upon this rock,\" not upon Peter. For He built His Church not upon man, but upon the faith of Peter. But what was his faith? \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" And Hilary says: To Peter the Father revealed that he should say, \"Thou art the Son of the living God.\" Therefore, the building of the Church is upon this rock of confession; this faith is the foundation of the Church. \"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofconcord.org/treatise.php |title=Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope |publisher=Book of Concord |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref>}}\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of ''Rock'' by looking at the Aramaic language, this is true that the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, however in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual and that is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.<ref name=WLS-Gawrisch>{{cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf |title=The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today |last1=Gawrisch |first1=Wilbert R. |date=5 Aug 1991 |publisher=Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-03 }}</ref><ref name=WLS-Balge>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf \n |title=Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In The New Testament \n |last1=Balge \n |first1=Richard D. \n |date=6 June 1995 \n |publisher=Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary \n |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf \n |archivedate=2015-02-03 \n}}</ref><ref>[http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.htm ''Some thoughts on Matthew 16:18''] {{Dead link|date=February 2015}}</ref>\n\nModern Lutheran historians even disclose that the Catholic church didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the ''Rock'' until the 1870s:\n\n{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]].

''who did more than any other to hold together the diversity of first-century Christianity.'' James the brother of Jesus, and Paul of Tarsus, the two other most prominent leading figures in first-century Christianity, were too much identified with their respective \"brands\" of Christianity, at least in the eyes of Christians at the opposite ends of this particular spectrum. But Peter, as shown particularly by the Antioch episode in {{Bibleref2|Galatians|2}}, had both a care to hold firm to his Jewish heritage\u2014which Paul lacked\u2014and an openness to the demands of developing Christianity, which James lacked. John might have served as a figure of the center holding together the extremes, but if the writings linked with his name are at all indicative of his own stance, he was too much of an individualist to provide such a rallying point. Others could link the developing new religion more firmly to its founding events and to Jesus himself. But none of them, including the rest of the twelve, seem to have played any role of continuing significance for the whole sweep of Christianity\u2014though James the brother of John might have proved an exception had he been spared.\" [Italics original] [[James Dunn (theologian)|Dunn, James D.G.]] ''The Canon Debate''. McDonald & Sanders editors, 2002, ch. 32, p. 577.</ref>\n\n== Matthew 16:18 ==\n\nControversy has surrounded one particular text that is linked with the Aramaic nickname name \u05db\u05e4\u05d0 (''Cepha''), meaning \"rock,\" that Jesus gave the man previously known as Simon.{{Bibleref2c|John|1:42}} The Greeks translated it as \u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''Petros''), a new form, appropriately masculine, of the standard feminine word \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 (''petra''), also meaning \"rock;\" and the Latins translated it as ''Petrus''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cephas |title=Cephas - Dictionary.com - Reference.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>\n\nWhile the reasons for disagreement on the nature of the primacy are complex, hinging on matters of doctrine, history and politics, the debate is often reduced to a discussion of the meaning and translation of Matthew 16:18: \"And I say to thee: That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\" {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16:18, Douay-Rheims Bible}}\n\nIn the [[Greek language|Greek]] text, the new name given is \u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''Petros''), and in the second half of the same verse the word translated as \"rock\" is \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 (''petra''). A literal translation, in the style of the [[King James Version]], of the words presumably used by Jesus would be \"Thou art Rock, and upon this rock will I build my church\".<ref>In [[French language|French]], the translation, \"Tu es ''Pierre'', et sur cette ''pierre'' je b\u00e2tirai mon \u00c9glise, et les portes de l'enfer ne pr\u00e9vaudront point contre elle\" preserves exactly the play on words in what is believed to be the original Aramaic.</ref> To preserve a supposed pun, the Greek text chose to translate Peter's name as \"\u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\" rather than as \"\u039a\u03b7\u03c6\u1fb6\u03c2\" (Cephas).\n\nOne common Protestant argument historically has been that the translation from the [[New Testament]] in Hebrew into Greek is tenuous at best as there is no real evidence or indication that the New Testament (in Greek) was ever translated from Hebrew or Aramaic texts; for that argument see [[Aramaic primacy]]. According to the Protestant transliteration argument,{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} in the [[Aramaic of Jesus|language that Jesus spoke]], the same word, \u05db\u05e4\u05d0 (cepha), was used for both Peter's name and for the rock on which Jesus said he would build his church. Since the [[Protestant Reformation]], many non-Catholics, in disagreement with the historic Catholic Church view, have disputed whether the feminine \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 refers to Peter, claiming it instead refers to either Peter's confession of faith or to Jesus himself.<ref name=Engler>John Engler. \"The Rock-Foundation of Matthew 16:17-20\". <http://www.greatcommission.com/Matthew161720.html> Accessed 12 Mar 2013</ref><ref name=Stagg>Stagg, Frank.

Broadman Press, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}</ref>\n\n==Catholic view on relationship to the Church today==\n{{Papal primacy and infallibility|expanded=overview}}\n\nIn [[Catholicism]], it is argued that the primacy of Peter is a basis for the primacy of the bishop of Rome over other [[bishops]] throughout the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]. This extension of Petrine primacy to popes is known as the [[primacy of the Bishop of Rome]], also known as the primacy of the Roman Pontiff. This Catholic Church doctrine holds that the [[pope|papacy]] has authority delegated from Jesus to rule over the [[Christendom|entire Church]]. There are various views on the nature of the primacy and how it has been exercised and [[Apostolic succession|passed on]]. This belief makes a distinction between the personal prestige of Peter and the supremacy of the office of [[pope]] which Catholics believe Jesus instituted in the person of Peter. Protestants do not believe the pope holds any authority over the [[Christian Church|universal Church]].\n\nSome [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] believe that [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Saint Paul saw Judaism]] as the [[Typology (theology)|type]] or figure of [[Christianity]]: \"Now all these things happened to [the Jews] in figure....\"{{bibleref2c|1Cor|10:11||1 Cor. 10:11}} In the [[613 Mitzvot|Old Law]], {{bibleref2|Deut.|17:8-12}} attributes to the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] the highest jurisdiction in religious matters. Therefore, it is argued, logic suggests that a supreme head would be necessary in the Christian Church,{{cn|date=August 2019}} though the relevance of [[Biblical law in Christianity]] is still disputed; see also [[New Covenant]] and [[The New Commandment|New Commandment]]. Furthermore, it is typically the local bishop who is considered the high priest of his flock, rather than the pope alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a6.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sacrament of Holy Orders|website=www.va|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], which some call the ''New Law'' or \"New Greek Testament\",<ref>Knight, Kevin. \"Question 106. The law of the Gospel, called the New Law, considered in itself.\" ''New Advent.'' Sept. 11, 2009: http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2106.htm</ref> {{bibleref2|Matthew|16:16-18}} reports that Jesus changed Simon's name to Peter. Elsewhere in Scripture such a name change always denotes some change in status (e.g., Abram to Abraham, Jacob to Israel, and Saul to Paul).\n\nJesus also said to Peter in verse 19, \"I will give to thee the [[Keys of Heaven|keys of the kingdom of heaven]].\" Especially for the Hebrew people, keys were a symbol of authority. Indeed, Jesus declares in the [[Book of Revelation]], that He has the \"keys of death and hell,\" which means that He has power over death and hell; {{Bibleref2|Isaiah|22:21-22}} also supports this. [[James Gibbons|Cardinal Gibbons]], in his book ''The Faith of Our Fathers'', points out that keys are still a symbol of authority in today's culture; he uses the example of someone giving the keys of his house to another person, and that the latter represented the owner of the house in his absence. In receiving the keys, Peter takes on the office of [[prime minister]], which was well-known to ancient and contemporary Hebrews, and depicted in the Old Testament, as the one who had authority from the King to bind and loose.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/pope/hahn.asp|title=Dr Scott Hahn on the Papacy {{!}} Catholic-Pages.com|website=www.catholic-pages.com|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/resources/apologetics/catholic-doctrines-and-practices/st-peter-and-the-popes|title=St. Peter and the Popes|website=Catholic News Agency|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\nAnother source indicating Peter's supremacy can be found in {{Bibleref2|John|21:15-17}} where Christ tells Peter three times to \"feed His sheep\" and \"feed His lambs.\" The \"sheep\" might be understood to be the stronger portion of Jesus' flock (the [[clergy]]), and the \"lambs\" as the weaker portion (the [[laity]]). From this, Catholics believe that Peter was given charge over Christ's whole flock, that is, the [[Catholic Church|Church]].\n\nMoreover, Peter is always named first in all listings of the Apostles; [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] is invariably mentioned last. In {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:2}} Peter is described as the \"first Apostle\". It is important to note that Peter was neither the first Apostle in age nor election; therefore, Peter must be the first Apostle in the sense of authority, if one ignores the possibility of him being first in the sense of first in the list of Twelve Apostles.{{bibleref2c|Mk.|3:16}} {{bibleref2c|Mt.|4:18-19}} According to {{bibleref2|Acts|1-2,10-11,15}}, St. Peter was the leader of the early Christian church in Jerusalem. Jesus also instructed St. Peter to strengthen his brethren, i.e., the apostles, according to {{bibleref2|Luke|22:31-32}}.\n\nBoth Latin and Greek writers in the early church (such as the St. [[John Chrysostom]]) referred to \"rock\" as applying to both Peter personally and his faith symbolically, as well as seeing Christ's promise to apply more generally to his twelve apostles and the Church at large.<ref name=\"Veselin Kesich 1992 61\u201366\">{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |pages= 61\u201366}}</ref>\n\n[[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council I]] defined the primacy of the bishop of Rome over the whole Catholic Church as an essential institution of the Church that can never be relinquished. This primacy is thus crucial to the understanding of the church from a Catholic viewpoint. At the same time, the history of papal primacy has always been imperfect and much-debated.<ref>Schatz, Klaus.  Papal Primacy: From Its Origins to the Present.  Translated by John A. Otto and Linda M.

Because of the faith he confessed Peter will remain the unshakable rock of the Church.

In this, they represent a middle-ground between the Catholic position and that of the [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] in the next section.\n\nThough among the Twelve Peter is predominant in the first chapters of [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[James the Just|James \"the brother of the Lord\"]] is shown to be a leader in his own right in later chapters, indeed he is commonly considered the first [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem#Bishops of Jerusalem|Bishop of Jerusalem]]. Some assume James outranks Peter because he speaks last in the [[Council of Jerusalem]] and suggests the final ruling (concerning Gentile converts and Jewish practices such as [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]]) agreed upon by all, and because Paul mentions him before Peter and John when he calls them \"pillars of the church\" in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]. James was indeed the first bishop or [[patriarch]] of Jerusalem according to tradition. However, Catholics believe the bishop of Jerusalem was not by that fact the head of the Christian church, since the leadership rested in Peter as the \"Rock\" and \"Chief Shepherd\".<ref>Mckenzie, John L. ''The Dictionary of the Bible'' (Catholic)</ref> It is believed Peter entrusted the Jerusalem community to James when he was forced to leave Jerusalem due to [[Herod Agrippa]]'s persecution. {{bibleref2c|Acts|12}}<ref>''The Navarre Bible'', footnotes</ref>\n\nHowever, at the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15, James uses the Greek ''exegesato'' to refer to Peter's statements, which refers to literally \"declaring\" or \"issuing a ruling.\" <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EvQJ_i7J4CEC&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=exegesato+james&source=bl&ots=0T7FZfHbub&sig=MSPr7qcxxSLvgY1BDHdUgA3xu4g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj3mbqave7JAhUJlB4KHTVgDV0Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=exegesato%20james&f=false The Biblical Basis for the Papacy] by John Salza</ref> However, James uses the Greek word ''akouoo'' in relation to his statements, which refers to literally \"giving one's opinion,\" and does not denote authority. Catholic scholar Michael M. Winter puts it in his ''Saint Peter and the Popes'' in the following terms: \"The speech of St. James is of a different character [from that of St. Peter]. He acquiesces to what St. Peter had said, although it seems to have been against his personal inclinations, and then puts forward a practical suggestion for the sake of harmony.\"\n\nThe Fourth Century Latin Father St. Jerome, in his epistle to St. Augustine of Hippo, wrote that \"nay more, that Peter was the prime mover in issuing the decree by which this was affirmed,\" in relation to the Council of Jerusalem, and again, \"and to his opinion the Apostle James, and all the elders together, gave consent.\" <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1102075.htm</ref>\n\nThis view is likewise echoed by Saint John Chrysostom, the Fourth Century Patriarch of Constantinople:\n\n{{quote|And why, then, passing by the others, does He converse with Peter on these things? (John 21:15). He was the chosen one of the Apostles, and the mouth of the disciples, and the leader of the choir. On this account, Paul also went up on a time to see him rather than the others (Galatians 1:18). And withal, to show him that he must thenceforward have confidence, as the denial was done away with, He puts into his hands the presidency over the brethren. And He brings not forward the denial, nor reproaches him with what had past, but says, \"If you love me, preside over the brethren.\" ...And the third time He gives him the same injunction, showing what a price He sets the presidency over His own sheep. And if one should say, \"How then did James receive the throne of Jerusalem?,\" this I would answer that He appointed this man (Peter) teacher, not of that throne, but of the whole world.<ref>http://www.catholicbridge.com/catholic/orthodox/pope_acts_15_james_and_peter.php</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nFor Catholics, the fact that the new name for Simon is Peter is in fact itself very significant. In the Old Testament God is frequently referred to as a Rock or stone. Jesus refers to himself as the cornerstone. The Book of Daniel contains a prophecy that a Rock or stone from the mountain of God (heaven) will come down to earth and destroy the pagan kings. The rock will then grow itself until it covers the entire earth. Protestants consider this prophecy to allude to the [[end times]] but Catholics consider the prophecy to refer specifically to Jesus as the Rock from Heaven. Further, Catholics see the fact that the Rock does not leave but stays to until it covers the entire earth to mean that the Church, built of the Rock of Peter, is the [[body of Christ]], the Rock from Heaven, and that the Rock will eventually cover the entire Earth which is why the term Catholic (universal or worldwide) is the most common designation for the Catholic Church.\n\n===Individuals and documents supporting Roman primacy===\n\n====Irenaeus====\n[[Irenaeus]] has been called the most important witness of the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|Christianity of the 2nd century]].<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 6.</ref> Taught by [[Polycarp]], who had been instructed by John the apostle, Irenaeus became [[Bishop of Lyon]] in 178. In his ''Against the Heresies'', Irenaeus wrote, \"Although there are many dialects in the world, the force of the tradition is one and the same. For the same faith is held and handed down by the churches established in the German states, the Spains, among the Celtic tribes, in the East, in Libya, and in the central portions of the world.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 8.</ref> In Book 3, Irenaeus continues his defense of the unity of the church around the bishop, writing, \"By pointing out the apostolic tradition and faith announced to mankind, which has been brought down to our time by successions of bishops, in the greatest, most ancient, and well known church, founded and established by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul, at Rome, we can confound all who in any other way \u2026 gather more than they ought.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 9.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus asserted the Doctrine of Apostolic Succession to counter the claims of heretics, especially the Gnostics who were attacking the theology and authority of the mainstream Church. He stated that one could find true teaching in several leading episcopal sees, not just at Rome. The doctrine he asserted, therefore, has two parts: lineage from the Apostles and right teaching. Even today a bishop can be in the line of succession, but schismatic and heretical as is the case with many episcopi vagantes who claim to or may have Catholic Orders, but have no following and have deviated from the Catholic orthodox faith as defined by the larger denominations such as the Orthodox, Anglicans, Catholics and Lutherans.\n\n====Ignatius of Antioch====\n[[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]], bishop of Antioch, was well known for his insistence on the authority of the bishop. In his writings to the church at [[Smyrna]] in 115 AD, he encouraged the Smyrnaeans to \"Avoid divisions, as the beginning of evil. Follow, all of you, the bishop, as Jesus Christ followed the father; and follow the presbytery as the apostles. Let no man do aught pertaining to the Church apart from the bishop. Wheresoever the bishop appears, there let the people be, even as wheresoever Christ Jesus is, there is the Catholic Church.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 4.</ref>\n\n====Tertullian====\nBorn in [[Carthage]] around 155 AD, [[Tertullian]] became a priest around the age of forty and worked tirelessly to defend the faith. In his ''Scorpiace'' of 208 AD, Tertullian wrote, \"No delay or inquest will meet Christians on the threshold. \u2026For though you think that heaven is still shut up, remember that the Lord left the keys of it to Peter here, and through him to the Church, which keys everyone will carry with him, if he has been questioned and made confession [of faith].\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 23.</ref> ''Scorpiace'' is the first known historical reference to the keys pertaining to anyone other than Peter. In it, he saw the keys as pertaining to \"everyone\" if they \"made confession\", rather than according to the modern interpretation concerning the bishops of Rome alone. Tertullian later retracted even this association in De Pudecitia,<ref>Schaff, Philip., American Ed., 1994. Alexander Roberts, D.D. & James Donaldson, LL.D. with notes by A. Cleveland Coxe, D.D..

The churches later declared him an apostate along with the followers of Montanus for insisting that authority must be associated with demonstrable power.\n\n====Cyprian====\n[[Cyprian|Thascius Caecilius Cyprianus]] was made bishop of Carthage in 248 AD. but died only ten years later. Throughout his writings, Cyprian asserts that the Rock is Peter, and the Church rests upon him. He also claims that as the Church is settled upon the bishops, they too have authority. He writes, \"They, who have departed from the Church, do not allow the Church to recall and bring back the lapsed. There is one God, and one Christ, and one Church, and one chair founded by the voice of the Lord on the rock. Another altar cannot be set up, nor a new priesthood made, besides the one altar and the one priesthood. Whoever gathers elsewhere scatters.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.

London: S.P.C.K., 1952. pp. 29-30.</ref> In his 251 AD ''De Catholicae Ecclesiae Unitate'', Cyprian asks, \"He who deserts the chair of Peter, upon whom the Church was founded, does he trust himself to be in the Church?\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.

London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 53.</ref>\n\n====John Chrysostom====\n[[John Chrysostom]] was born at [[Antioch]] around 347 and would fight for the reform of the Church until his exile in 404. His homilies emphasize his belief in the primacy. He called Peter \"the leader of the choir, the mouth of all the apostles, the head of that tribe, the ruler of the whole world, the foundation of the Church, the ardent lover of Christ.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.

He was also bishop of Hippo from 397 AD til his death in 430 AD. Augustine taught that Peter was first amongst the apostles, and thus represents the church.<ref>Giles, E., ed.

Modern theories of papal primacy developed around Innocent and his writings. In a 416 AD letter to [[Decentius]], bishop of Eugubium, Innocent writes, \"Who does not know or observe that it [the church order] was delivered by Peter the chief of the apostles to the Roman church, and is kept until now, and ought to be retained by all, and that nothing ought to be imposed or introduced which has no authority, or seems to derive its precedents elsewhere?\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.

London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 194.</ref> It is also during this time that bishops began to recognize Innocent's primacy as Pope over other bishops in the West. This is made evident, among others, in a letter from the Council at Mileve to Innocent in 416 AD, which alludes to the authority of \"his holiness\" drawn from the authority of Scripture.<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 198.</ref> The doctrine of primacy was beginning to take shape with Innocent's papacy.\n\n====Pope Leo I====\nBased on his knowledge of the Petrine texts of the Gospel, and his writings which expound upon it, it is easy to see that [[Pope Leo I|Leo I]] identified with the authority bestowed on Peter as bishop of Rome. Leo himself was consecrated bishop of Rome in 440 AD. He writes that \"The right of this power did indeed pass on to other apostles, and the order of this decree passed on to all the chiefs of the Church; but not in vain was that which was imparted to all entrusted to but one. Therefore this is commended to Peter separately, because all the rulers of the Church are invested with the figure of Peter. \u2026So then in Peter the strength of all is fortified, and the help of divine grace is so ordered that the stability which through Christ is given to Peter, through Peter is conveyed to the apostles.\" The [[Council of Chalcedon]] would later refer to Leo as \"him who had been charged with the custody of the vine by the savior.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. pp. 280, 323.</ref>\n\n====Pope Gregory VII====\nThe [[Gregorian Reform|Gregorian Reform movement]] was rather a series of movements many of which involved the reform of the Catholic Church, headed by [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], formerly the Archdeacon Hildebrand. Gregory became Pope in 1073 with the objective of reforming not the body of the church, but a purification of the clergy in general.<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 101.</ref> Gregory is perhaps most recognized with the quarrel between himself and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|King Henry IV]] of Germany, known as the \"[[Investiture Contest]]\". Gregory's ''Dictus Pape'' outlines his policies and ideals, as well as those of the Catholic Church. In this work, Gregory claims that the pope has power to depose and restore bishops, and also effectively reduces the authority of other bishops.<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 129.</ref> This doctrine supported the idea that Rome and the church here also afforded primacy over all other churches. Gregory's papacy also bolstered the power of the Church over that of the State. The Gregorians defended the ideal of a separation of powers, claiming \"Let kings have what belongs to kings, and priests have what belongs to priests.\"<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 133.</ref> The Petrine primacy was now more affirmed than ever.\n\n===Challenges===\n\n====Councils====\nMany challenges faced the Popes claiming primacy throughout the history of Catholicism. The [[Edict of Milan]], the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]], and the [[First Council of Constantinople]] all dealt with the issue of primacy in that they amended the power of the popes over the other bishops. The third canon of the First Council of Constantinople of 381 AD declares Constantinople the new Rome, gives the Bishop of Rome the seat of honor and gives the Bishop of Constantinople second place in honor. The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431 AD offers debate as to whether the results determine that the Pope is at the head of the Church, or rather that it is under the authority of a council of bishops (Giles, 238-256 AD). Although the highlight of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 AD was the confession of the [[Person of Christ]], the Council also resulted in limitations to the powers of the bishops. Many letters of the Council identify its position as in agreement with papal primacy. Those present employ titles such as \"the most holy and beloved of God\" and \"ecumenical archbishop and patriarch of great Rome\" to address Pope Leo. Thus, as not all can be satisfied with the results, The Council of Chalcedon resulted in a schism with the Oriental Orthodox Church.<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 297-321.</ref>\n\n====Schism====\nInternally, people questioned who rightfully was pope, while others wondered as to the role the Pope was to play outside of Rome.<ref>Logan, F. Donald.  A History of the Church in the Middle Ages.  New York: Routledge, 2002. p. 133.</ref> The papacy's most widely known crisis, as well as its largest challenge to authority, came with the \"[[Western Schism]]\" in the late Middle Ages, dating from 1378\u20131417.<ref>Schatz, Klaus.

The Cardinals called the election into question and elected [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]] as Pope. Germany, Italy, England, and the rest of Northern and Eastern Europe remained loyal to Urban, while France, Spain, Scotland, and Rome followed Clement VII (1378\u20131394) and his successor, [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] (1394&ndash;1417) who would reside in Avignon.\n\n==Eastern Orthodox view on relationship to the Church today==\n\n===Many hold the ''Primacy'' of Peter===\n[[File:StPeter-RussianMuseum.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of St. Peter (15th century, [[Russian State Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg]]).]]\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] regards the Apostle Peter, together with the Apostle Paul, as \"preeminent apostles\".

In this traditional Orthodox and Patristic view, the Church is the local Eucharistic assembly (\"the diocese\" in today's terminology) and the one who holds the \"Chair of Peter\" (St. Cyprian's expression) is the bishop. As a result, the primacy of Peter is relevant to the relationship between the bishop and the presbyters, not between the bishop of Rome and the other bishops who are all equally holding Peter's chair.\n\nAs John Meyendorff explained:\n\n{{quote|A very clear patristic tradition sees the succession of Peter in the episcopal ministry. The doctrine of St Cyprian of Carthage on the \"See of Peter\" being present in every local Church, and not only in Rome, is well-known. It is also found in the East, among people who certainly never read the De unitate ecclesia of Cyprian, but who share its main idea, thus witnessing to it as part of the catholic tradition of the Church. St Gregory of Nyssa, for example, affirms that Christ \"through Peter gave to the bishops the keys of the heavenly honors,\" and the author of the Areopagitica, when speaking of the \"hierarchs\" of the Church, refers immediately to the image of St Peter. A careful analysis of ecclesiastical literature both Eastern and Western, of the first millennium, including such documents as the lives of the saint, would certainly show that this tradition was a persistent one; and indeed it belongs to the essence of Christian ecclesiology to consider any local bishop to be the teacher of his flock and therefore to fulfill sacramentally, through apostolic succession, the office of the first true believer, Peter... There exists, however, another succession, equally recognized by Byzantine theologians, but only on the level of the analogy existing between the apostolic college and the episcopal college, this second succession being determined by the need for ecclesiastical order. Its limits are determined by the Councils, and - in the Byzantine practice \u2013 by the \"very pious emperors.\"|''The Primacy of Peter'', p. 89}}\n\nThe notion that many [[Episcopal see|Sees]] were \u2018\u2019of Peter\u2019\u2019 had also once been held in the West:\n\n[[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]]\n{{quote|Your most sweet Holiness has spoken much in your letter to me about the chair of Saint Peter, Prince of the apostles, saying that he himself now sits on it in the persons of his successors...Wherefore though there are many apostles, yet with regard to the principality itself the See of the Prince of the apostles alone has grown strong in authority, which in three places is the See of one...He himself stablished (sic) the See in which, though he was to leave it, he sat for seven years.

However, the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul.\n\nThe Orthodox also consider that [[Pope Linus|St. Linus]], not Peter, was actually the first [[Bishop of Rome]].\n{{quote|Of the church of Rome, Linus the son of Claudia was the first, ordained by Paul; and Clemens (Clement), after Linus' death, the second, ordained by me Peter.<ref>\u2019\u2019Apostolic Teaching and Constitutions\u2019\u2019, Book 7, Chapter XLVI \u2013 \"Who Were They that the Holy Apostles Sent and Ordained?\"</ref>}}\n\n===''Keys'' and ''rock'' not exclusive to Peter===\n[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] theologians agree that in {{bibleref2|Matthew|16:18}}, \"rock\" is a likely reference to Peter personally since the very name \"Peter\" means \"rock.\".<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |pages= 47\u201348}}</ref> However {{bibleref2|Matthew|18:18}} implies that the other Apostles were given the same powers.

There were no positions of power between the twelve, only \"degrees of intimacy\" or \"degrees of honor.\" According to this view, Peter has a weak symbolic primacy or primacy of honor (in the sense of a purely honorary primacy). In the patristic era, this was actually the Western view held by St Augustine.

In the East, there were numerous \"apostolic sees\", Jerusalem being considered the \"mother of all churches,\" and the bishop of Antioch could also claim the title of successor to Peter, being that Peter was the first [[List of Patriarchs of Antioch|bishop of Antioch]]. \"Canon 28 of [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] was for [the Byzantines] one of the essential texts for the organization of the Church: 'It is for right reasons that the accorded privileges to old Rome, for this city was the seat of the Emperor and the Senate.' ... The reason why the Roman Church had been accorded an incontestable precedence over all other apostolic churches was that its Petrine and Pauline 'apostolicity' was in fact added to the city's position as the capital city, and only the conjunction of both of these elements gave the Bishop of Rome the right to occupy the place of a primate in the Christian world with the consensus of all the churches.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |page= 68}}</ref>\n\n==Protestant views on relationship to the Church today==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 400\n\n | image1 = Saint Raphael Catholic Church (Springfield, Ohio) - stained glass, Upon this Rock, detail - St. Peter's Basilica.jpg\n | caption1 = Stained glass window in a Catholic church depicting [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome sitting \"Upon this rock,\" a reference to [[:s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 16|Matthew 16]]:18.

The Peshitta (written in Syriac, a language cognate with Aramaic) makes no distinction between the words in the two clauses.

In classical Attic Greek ''petros'' generally meant \"pebble,\" while ''petra'' meant \"boulder\" or \"cliff.\" Accordingly, taking Peter's name to mean \"pebble,\" they argue that the \"rock\" in question cannot have been Peter, but something else, either Jesus himself, or the faith in Jesus that Peter had just professed. However, the New Testament was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek, not Attic Greek, and some authorities say no significant difference existed between the meanings of ''petros'' and ''petra''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[File:Gesupietrochiave.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter'', by [[Pietro Perugino]] (1481\u201382)]]\nHowever, even though the feminine noun ''petra'' is translated as ''rock'' in the phrase \"on this rock I will build my church,\" the word ''petra'' (\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 in Greek) is also used at {{Bibleref2|1Cor|10:4||1 Cor. 10:4}} in describing Jesus Christ, which reads: \"They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.\"\n\nAlthough {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16}} is used as a primary proof-text for the Catholic doctrine of Papal supremacy, Protestant scholars say that prior to the Reformation of the sixteenth century, Matthew 16 was very rarely used to support papal claims. Their position is that most of the early and medieval Church interpreted the 'rock' as being a reference either to Christ or to Peter's faith, not Peter himself. They understand Jesus' remark to have been his affirmation of Peter's testimony that Jesus was the Son of God.<ref>Mathison, Keith A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=w_PHAGr2TfgC ''The Shape of Sola Scriptura''], pp.184\u2013185</ref>\n\nAnother rebuttal of the Catholic position is that if ''Peter'' really means ''the Rock'' which makes him the chief of Apostles, it would contradict Bible's teaching in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|2:20}} which says that the church's foundation is the apostles and prophets, not Peter alone. They posit that the meaning of {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16:18}} is that Jesus uses a play on words with Peter's name to say that the confession he had just made is the rock on which the church is built.<ref name=WELS-ROCK>{{cite web |url=http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=813&cuItem_itemID=24624 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090927075835/http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=813&cuItem_itemID=24624 |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 September 2009 |work=WELS Topical Q&A |title=Matthew 16:18 - Peter, This Rock |publisher=Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod |accessdate=16 Mar 2017 }}</ref>\n\nOther theologically conservative Christians, including Confessional Lutherans, also rebut comments made by Karl Keating and D.A. Carson who claim that there is no distinction between the words ''petros'' and ''petra'' in Koine Greek. The Lutheran theologians<ref>Danker, Frederick W., ''The concise Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament'', p. 282.</ref> state that the dictionaries of [[Koine Greek|Koine/NT Greek]], including the authoritative<ref>Rykle Borger, \"Remarks of an Outsider about Bauer's Worterbuch, BAGD, BDAG, and Their Textual Basis,\" Biblical Greek Language and Lexicography: Essays in Honor of Frederick W.

He disagrees with Luther and the Protestant reformers who held that by \"rock\" Christ did not mean Peter, but meant either himself or the faith of His followers. He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that \"Kepha\" was the Aramaic word for \"rock\", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.<ref name=Time/>\n\nYet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"<ref name=Time>\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html Religion: Peter & the Rock.]\" \"Time,\" Dec. 07, 1953. Accessed Oct. 08, 2009</ref>\n\nCullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.<ref name=Time/>\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\"<ref>D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).</ref> Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or ''this same'', when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]] believes in the re-established Apostle ministry. It sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]] in the [[Early Church]].\n\n===Lutheran view===\nFrom the ''[[Book of Concord]]'': {{quote|Chrysostom says thus: \"Upon this rock,\" not upon Peter. For He built His Church not upon man, but upon the faith of Peter. But what was his faith? \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" And Hilary says: To Peter the Father revealed that he should say, \"Thou art the Son of the living God.\" Therefore, the building of the Church is upon this rock of confession; this faith is the foundation of the Church. \"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofconcord.org/treatise.php |title=Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope |publisher=Book of Concord |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref>}}\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of ''Rock'' by looking at the Aramaic language, this is true that the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, however in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual and that is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.<ref name=WLS-Gawrisch>{{cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf |title=The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today |last1=Gawrisch |first1=Wilbert R. |date=5 Aug 1991 |publisher=Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-03 }}</ref><ref name=WLS-Balge>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf \n |title=Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In The New Testament \n |last1=Balge \n |first1=Richard D. \n |date=6 June 1995 \n |publisher=Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary \n |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf \n |archivedate=2015-02-03 \n}}</ref><ref>[http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.htm ''Some thoughts on Matthew 16:18''] {{Dead link|date=February 2015}}</ref>\n\nModern Lutheran historians even disclose that the Catholic church didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the ''Rock'' until the 1870s:\n\n{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]].

The LDS Church teaches that Peter was the chief apostle and head of the Church after Christ's ascension. The LDS Church further teaches that all [[Melchizedek Priesthood]] authority in the Church must come through a line of authority traceable directly from Christ through Peter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1996/12/the-restoration-of-the-aaronic-and-melchizedek-priesthoods?lang=eng|title = The Restoration of the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods}}</ref> However, in contrast to other groups, they believe that the line of succession was at some point broken following the death of the apostles, necessitating a restoration of the priesthood authority. The LDS Church teaches that this restoration occurred with the appearance of the resurrected Peter, James, and John, who ordained Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in 1829.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1979/06/dating-the-restoration-of-the-melchizedek-priesthood?lang=eng|title = Dating the Restoration of the Melchizedek Priesthood}}</ref> All ordained members of the LDS Church can obtain a written line of authority tracing back to Christ through Peter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/help/support/request-a-priesthood-line-of-authority?lang=eng|title = Request a Priesthood Line of Authority}}</ref>\n\nDespite the acceptance of Peter's primacy, several leaders of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) have taught that the rock referred to by Jesus in Matthew 16:18 was neither Peter nor his confession, but the gift of [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] from the [[Holy Spirit]] which made Christ's divinity known to Peter. [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] [[Howard W. Hunter]] taught: {{quote|\"And upon this rock I will build my church.\" Upon what rock? Peter? Upon a man?
