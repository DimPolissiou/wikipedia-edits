A protest was held about this and many prominent musicians including [[John Rutter]] protested against the church decision.

A Service of Thanksgiving for those named in the Book of Remembrance is held at the church each year as well as a Requiem close to [[All Souls' Day]]. Many concerts and memorial events for musicians have been held in the church over the years. In 2017 the Rector caused a storm in the media by ending the hiring scheme and excluding many choirs from singing and rehearsing in the church. A protest was held about this and many prominent musicians including [[John Rutter]] protested against the church decision. Attempts to mediate failed.\n\n===Military link===\nThe south aisle of the church holds the regimental chapel of [[the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment)]] (merged to form the [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]), and its gardens are a memorial garden to that regiment.<ref>\"The Visitors Guide to the City of London Churches\" Tucker,T: London, Friends of the City Churches, 2006 {{ISBN|0-9553945-0-3}}</ref> The west end of the north aisle has various memorials connected with the [[City of London Rifles]] (the 6th Battalion [[London Regiment]]).

Austin, chairman of geology at the [[Institute for Creation Research]]. Wilkerson urged the conference attendees to drop the young Earth viewpoint and accept the \"ample scientific evidence\" that the Earth is [[Age of the Earth|4.5 billion years old]].  Austin stated that Wilkerson was misinterpreting the data and that a young Earth viewpoint remained feasible.<ref>{{cite news | first = Ken | last = Guggenheim | title = Geologists Debate The Age Of Earth Before Creationists | date = 1990-09-01| url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=n3YcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3mMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5883,64309&dq=international-conference-on-creationism&hl=en | publisher = Pittsburgh Press | accessdate = 2010-12-01|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n{{Hidden\n|showhide=left\n|header=1994 Conference \n|content=: <small>Aardsma, Gerald E., ''Search for Radiocarbon in Coal''</small>\n: <small>Aardsma, Gerald E., ''The Exodus Happened 2450 B.C.''</small>\n: <small>Ackerman, Paul D., ''Preventing Out-of-Wedlock Teenage Pregnancy: Current Practice Versus the Experimental Social Psychology Research Base''</small>\n: <small>Auldaney, Jeremy, ''Catastrophic Fluvial Deposition at the Asphalt Seeps of Rancho La Brea, California''</small>\n: <small>Austin, Steven A. & Wise, Kurt P., ''Pre-Flood / Flood Boundary: As Defined in Grand Canyon and East Mojave''</small>\n: <small>Barnette, Daniel W., & Baumgardner, John R., ''Patterns of Ocean Circulation Over the Continents During Noah's Flood''</small>\n: <small>Baumgardner, John R., ''Computer Modeling of the Large Scale Tectonics Associated with the Genesis Flood''</small>\n: <small>Baumgardner, John R., ''Runaway Subduction as the Driving Mechanism for the Genesis Flood''</small>\n: <small>Bergman, Jerry, ''An Update of the Courts, Academic Freedom and Creationists: The Peloza, Johnson, and Bishop Cases''</small>\n: <small>Bergman, Jerry, ''Magnetic Monopoles and Grand Unification Theory''</small>\n: <small>Berthault, Guy, ''Experiments on Stratification''</small>\n: <small>Boudreaux, Edward A., ''Particle Interaction Analysis of Solar Formation and Stabilization''</small>\n: <small>Brown, Robert H., ''Mixing Lines - Considerations Regarding Their Use in Creationist Interpretation of Radioisotope Age Data''</small>\n: <small>Cadwallader, Mark W. , ''A Biblical Creation Model and Response for Environmental Difficulties''</small>\n: <small>Chaffin, Eugene F., ''Are Fundamental Constants of Physics Really Variables?''</small>\n: <small>Clark, M.

Most presentations tried either to advance a model in some way or at least to honestly review the evidence that needs explaining. This requirement was stated in the call for papers and enforced in the refereeing process, Anyone whose only exposure to creationism is a Gish Gallop would not have recognized a single presentation at ICC98.<ref name=rncse /> Larry Witham described it as having \"become the preeminent meeting of its kind in the world.\" Its goal is to provide a peer-review forum wherein the Creation model could be rigorously developed. He states that the conferences express similar disdain for both \"slipshod\" populist young earth creationism, and for smuggling in \"antiquity and evolution\". He describes as \"astounding\" their presupposition that God \"''used processes which are not now operating anywhere in the natural universe''.\" They state they cannot discover by scientific investigation anything about the creative processes used by the Creator.<ref name=witham>{{cite book |last=Witham |first=Larry A. |title=Where Darwin meets the Bible: creationists and evolutionists in America |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=llzwy_Ft1DQC&pg=PA52&lpg=PA52&dq=icc+Creationism#v=onepage&q=icc%20Creationism&f=false |page=52 | isbn=978-0-19-518281-1|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nMathematics professor [[Jason Rosenhouse]] writes expressing sadness that while generally impressed with attendees \"personality and temperament\", that they are \"hopelessly ignorant of science.

track\" nonsense still were abundant.<ref name=rncse /> The 1990 conference featured a debate between Gregg Wilkerson, an old-earth creationist geologist and Steven A. Austin, chairman of geology at the [[Institute for Creation Research]]. Wilkerson urged the conference attendees to drop the young Earth viewpoint and accept the \"ample scientific evidence\" that the Earth is [[Age of the Earth|4.5 billion years old]].  Austin stated that Wilkerson was misinterpreting the data and that a young Earth viewpoint remained feasible.<ref>{{cite news | first = Ken | last = Guggenheim | title = Geologists Debate The Age Of Earth Before Creationists | date = 1990-09-01| url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=n3YcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3mMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5883,64309&dq=international-conference-on-creationism&hl=en | publisher = Pittsburgh Press | accessdate = 2010-12-01|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n{{Hidden\n|showhide=left\n|header=1994 Conference \n|content=: <small>Aardsma, Gerald E., ''Search for Radiocarbon in Coal''</small>\n: <small>Aardsma, Gerald E., ''The Exodus Happened 2450 B.C.''</small>\n: <small>Ackerman, Paul D., ''Preventing Out-of-Wedlock Teenage Pregnancy: Current Practice Versus the Experimental Social Psychology Research Base''</small>\n: <small>Auldaney, Jeremy, ''Catastrophic Fluvial Deposition at the Asphalt Seeps of Rancho La Brea, California''</small>\n: <small>Austin, Steven A. & Wise, Kurt P., ''Pre-Flood / Flood Boundary: As Defined in Grand Canyon and East Mojave''</small>\n: <small>Barnette, Daniel W., & Baumgardner, John R., ''Patterns of Ocean Circulation Over the Continents During Noah's Flood''</small>\n: <small>Baumgardner, John R., ''Computer Modeling of the Large Scale Tectonics Associated with the Genesis Flood''</small>\n: <small>Baumgardner, John R., ''Runaway Subduction as the Driving Mechanism for the Genesis Flood''</small>\n: <small>Bergman, Jerry, ''An Update of the Courts, Academic Freedom and Creationists: The Peloza, Johnson, and Bishop Cases''</small>\n: <small>Bergman, Jerry, ''Magnetic Monopoles and Grand Unification Theory''</small>\n: <small>Berthault, Guy, ''Experiments on Stratification''</small>\n: <small>Boudreaux, Edward A., ''Particle Interaction Analysis of Solar Formation and Stabilization''</small>\n: <small>Brown, Robert H., ''Mixing Lines - Considerations Regarding Their Use in Creationist Interpretation of Radioisotope Age Data''</small>\n: <small>Cadwallader, Mark W. , ''A Biblical Creation Model and Response for Environmental Difficulties''</small>\n: <small>Chaffin, Eugene F., ''Are Fundamental Constants of Physics Really Variables?''</small>\n: <small>Clark, M.

Most presentations tried either to advance a model in some way or at least to honestly review the evidence that needs explaining. This requirement was stated in the call for papers and enforced in the refereeing process, Anyone whose only exposure to creationism is a Gish Gallop would not have recognized a single presentation at ICC98.<ref name=rncse /> Larry Witham described it as having \"become the preeminent meeting of its kind in the world.\" Its goal is to provide a peer-review forum wherein the Creation model could be rigorously developed. He states that the conferences express similar disdain for both \"slipshod\" populist young earth creationism, and for smuggling in \"antiquity and evolution\". He describes as \"astounding\" their presupposition that God \"''used processes which are not now operating anywhere in the natural universe''.\" They state they cannot discover by scientific investigation anything about the creative processes used by the Creator.<ref name=witham>{{cite book |last=Witham |first=Larry A. |title=Where Darwin meets the Bible: creationists and evolutionists in America |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=llzwy_Ft1DQC&pg=PA52&lpg=PA52&dq=icc+Creationism#v=onepage&q=icc%20Creationism&f=false |page=52 | isbn=978-0-19-518281-1|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nMathematics professor [[Jason Rosenhouse]] writes expressing sadness that while generally impressed with attendees \"personality and temperament\", that they are \"hopelessly ignorant of science.

N. Sinha and directed by S. U. Sunny. The film stars [[Dilip Kumar]], [[Meena Kumari]], [[Leela Chitnis]] and [[Kumkum (actress)|Kumkum]]. The film's music is by [[Naushad]].\n\nIt is said that Dilip Kumar went into depression after playing tragic roles in films such as Devdas and his psychiatrist recommended to him to do light roles. One such role that he took up was Kohinoor. Kohinoor cast Dilip Kumar and Meena Kumari to play a prince and princess of different kingdoms and was full of sword fights, songs and dances. This film is also notable for some rare comical and funny scenes by Meena Kumari, who is otherwise known as the tragedy queen. Its tone was light and it lacked the intense characterisations of their earlier films. It was a major hit of the year.\n\nThe film included the melodic songs \"Madhuban mein Radhika Nache Re\" and \"Do Sitaron Ka Zameen Par Hai Milan Aaj Ki Raat\".\n\n==Plot==\nAfter the passing of Maharaj Dhiraj Rana Chandrabhan of Kailash Nagar, the Senapati, Veer Singh, crowns Rajkumar Dhivendra Pratap Bahadur Chandrabhan as the next King. Veer's wife, who has brought up Dhivendra like her own son, Surinder, would like Dhivendra to marry Rajkumari Chandramukhi of Rajgarh. The Maharaja of Rajgarh is pleased to hear of this, and asks his daughter to set forth to Kailash Nagar. On the way there, she is abducted by her very own Senapati and held captive until she gives her consent to marry him. Dhivendra rescues her, both fall in love, but are captured by Senapati's men. Dhivendra is gravely injured, but manages to escape and is looked after by Rajgarh's Raj Nartaki, Rajlaxmi, who also falls in love with him. After Dhivendra recuperates, he finds out that Chandramukhi is being held against her will at Senapati's castle, he sets forth to set her free, but is captured in the process. Held in chains, he is blinded by a vengeful Rajlaxmi, and Chandramukhi is given an ultimatum - either wed Senapati or witness the death of Dhivendra.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Dilip Kumar]]   \n*[[Meena Kumari]]   \n*Azim   \n*Bina\n*[[Leela Chitnis]]   \n*Jeevan   \n*[[Raja Kapur]]   \n*[[Nazir Kashmiri]]   \n*Kumar   \n*[[Kumkum (actress)|Kumkum]]  \n*Rekha Mallick   \n*[[Mukri]]   \n*Nissar  \n*Qamar   \n*M.Y.

The soundtrack became a cult favourite among music lovers for its soul stirring music compositions. The soundtrack consists of 10 songs, featuring vocals by [[Mohammed Rafi]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]] and [[Asha Bhonsle]].

N. Sinha and directed by S. U. Sunny. The film stars [[Dilip Kumar]], [[Meena Kumari]], [[Leela Chitnis]] and [[Kumkum (actress)|Kumkum]]. The film's music is by [[Naushad]].\n\nIt is said that Dilip Kumar went into depression after playing tragic roles in films such as Devdas and his psychiatrist recommended to him to do light roles. One such role that he took up was Kohinoor. Kohinoor cast Dilip Kumar and Meena Kumari to play a prince and princess of different kingdoms and was full of sword fights, songs and dances. This film is also notable for some rare comical and funny scenes by Meena Kumari, who is otherwise known as the tragedy queen. Its tone was light and it lacked the intense characterisations of their earlier films. It was a major hit of the year.\n\nThe film included the very melodious songs \"Madhuban mein Radhika Nache Re\" and \"Do Sitaron Ka Zameen Par Hai Milan Aaj Ki Raat\".\n\n==Plot==\nAfter the passing of Maharaj Dhiraj Rana Chandrabhan of Kailash Nagar, the Senapati, Veer Singh, crowns Rajkumar Dhivendra Pratap Bahadur Chandrabhan as the next King. Veer's wife, who has brought up Dhivendra like her own son, Surinder, would like Dhivendra to get married to Rajkumari Chandramukhi of Rajgarh. The Maharaja of Rajgarh is pleased to hear of this, and asks his daughter to set forth to Kailash Nagar. On the way there, she is abducted by her very own Senapati and held captive until she gives her consent to marry him. Dhivendra rescues her, both fall in love, but are captured by Senapati's men. Dhivendra is gravely injured, but manages to escape and is looked after by Rajgarh's Raj Nartaki, Rajlaxmi, who also falls in love with him. After Dhivendra recuperates, he finds out that Chandramukhi is being held against her will at Senapati's castle, he sets forth to set her free, but is captured in the process. Held in chains, he is blinded by a vengeful Rajlaxmi, and Chandramukhi is given an ultimatum - either wed Senapati or witness the death of Dhivendra.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Dilip Kumar]]   \n*[[Meena Kumari]]   \n*Azim   \n*Bina\n*[[Leela Chitnis]]   \n*Jeevan   \n*[[Raja Kapur]]   \n*[[Nazir Kashmiri]]   \n*Kumar   \n*[[Kumkum (actress)|Kumkum]]  \n*Rekha Mallick   \n*[[Mukri]]   \n*Nissar  \n*Qamar   \n*M.Y.
