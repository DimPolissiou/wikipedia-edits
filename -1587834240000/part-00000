Since his debut, he has appeared in almost every ''Mario'' franchise game, usually serving as the main antagonist. Bowser is voiced by Kenny James. In addition to his usual animated and video game appearances, he also appears in the [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|1993 live-action film]], where he is portrayed by [[Dennis Hopper]].\n\n==Concept and creation==\nBowser was created by Nintendo designer and producer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. Miyamoto had first envisioned Bowser as an [[ox]], basing him on the Ox King from the [[Toei Animation]] film ''[[Alakazam the Great]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ds.kombo.com/article.php?artid=7373|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917090724/http://ds.kombo.com/article.php?artid=7373|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 17, 2010|author=David Oxford|title=Iwata Asks:The Birth of Bowser|publisher=Ds.Kombo|accessdate=August 23, 2010}}</ref> However, Nintendo designer [[Takashi Tezuka]] pointed out that the character looked a lot more like a turtle than an ox. Miyamoto and Tezuka then began to work together to define Bowser's appearance. Since the character was the leader of the turtle-like Koopa Troopas the two began to base his new appearance on them, creating a new illustration. In his final design, Miyamoto commented that he could make Bowser \"look cool now\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Iwata Asks Volume 8- Flipnote Studios-An Animation Class 4.My First Project: Draw a Rug |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/systems/volume_8_14207.html#top |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120525101151/http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/systems/volume_8_14207.html#top |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 25, 2012 }}2009-08-11</ref>\n\nMiyamoto named him {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u5927|\u5927]] [[wikt:\u9b54|\u9b54]] [[wikt:\u738b|\u738b]] \u30af\u30c3\u30d1}} ''Daima\u014d Kuppa''.

(film)|''Super Mario Bros.'' film]], Bowser is portrayed by [[Dennis Hopper]] and is called President Koopa. He is also briefly referred to as King Koopa. This incarnation is almost entirely human in appearance, with blonde hair he gels in the shape of a crown, and he frequently wears a black business suit and tie. However, after brief exposure to his own evolution-reversing device by the Mario Bros., he starts occasionally possessing some reptilian traits. The climax of the film sees Koopa devolve into an enormous green [[Tyrannosaurus|''Tyrannosaurus rex'']] to battle the Mario Bros., but he is further devolved into primordial ooze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smbmovie.com/SMBArchive/specials/interviews/2_JeffGoodwin_3-30-09.html|title=Super Mario Bros. The Movie Archive|publisher=Smbmovie.com|date=March 30, 2009|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nBowser is portrayed as the \"King of the [[Koopa Troopa|Koopas]]\", [[anthropomorphic]] [[turtle]]s that inhabit the world of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. Bowser differs greatly from the rest of the Koopa clan, which consists mainly of bipedal tortoises. He is characterized by a large, spiked [[turtle shell]], horns, a draconic muzzle, razor-sharp fangs, taloned fingers, three clawed toes on each foot, red eyes and a shock of red hair.\n\nHe is physically endowed with immense strength, is nearly indestructible, and can [[Fire breathing|breathe fire]]. He can also jump surprisingly high for his large size, although his [[speed]] and [[agility]] are most of the time lacking. He is also accomplished in black magic, thanks to which he can teleport himself or summon objects, fly, generate a huge amount of electricity, use telekinesis or metamorphose.\n\nBowser's physical size tends to vary from game to game. In most games, he towers over the majority of characters, but there are exceptions. In ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', he stands only slightly taller than Mario. He is shown changing his size at will or through others' sorcery in games including ''[[Yoshi's Island]]'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]''.\n\nBowser aspires to take over the Mushroom Kingdom and merge it with his own realm. He is infatuated with [[Princess Peach]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars Strategy Guide}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game|title=Paper Mario|developer=Intelligent Systems}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game|title=Super Paper Mario|developer=Intelligent Systems}}</ref> and routinely kidnaps her as part of his plans for domination.<ref name=Screwattack /> Sometimes, he kidnaps Peach simply to lure [[Mario]] into a trap, but occasionally he hopes to marry her.\n\nThe character's role in the franchise varies. He is typically the main antagonist in the main series, but in [[List of Mario role-playing games|the RPG series]], he sometimes works with the heroes to defeat a greater evil.<ref>''[[Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars]]'', ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'', ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'', and ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story]]''.</ref> The RPGs also portray Bowser in a more humorous light as a blustering, buffoonish [[Bullying|bully]] with a hidden softer side. He also cares for his minions.\n\nBowser has a son, [[Bowser Jr.]], who helps his father kidnap Princess Peach. Bowser Jr.'s mother is unknown, as Bowser isn't officially confirmed as having a previous marriage yet. Originally in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Bowser was stated to be the father of the [[Koopalings]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clv/manuals/ja/pdf/CLV-P-HAACJ.pdf |title=Original Japanese manual of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''. |publisher= Nintendo Co., Ltd. |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}</ref> with subsequent official sources adding that he was their biological father,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/NES/Super-Mario-Bros-3-279558.html |title=''Super Mario Bros. 3'' page on Nintendo UK's site. |publisher= Nintendo UK |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>\"''Bowser, King of the Koopas, and his evil offspring have invaded yet another kingdom.

Bowser's only child is Bowser Jr., and we do not know who the mother is.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/09/24/miyamoto-tezuka-interview.aspx |title=Mario's Creators Answer Burning Questions About The Series |publisher=Game Informer |accessdate=December 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130123161706/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/09/24/miyamoto-tezuka-interview.aspx |archive-date=January 23, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Voice and portrayal==\nUp until the release of ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', Bowser's voice consisted of mostly computer generated roars, snarls, and laughs. Then, in the 2002 release of ''Super Mario Sunshine'', [[radio personality]] and voice actor Scott Burns gave Bowser his first spoken dialogue and continued portraying him for several more years. With the late 2005 release of ''[[Super Mario Strikers]]'', Kenneth W. James became the new voice actor for Bowser. Although, for a few years, old recordings of Burns were reused for games after James took the role, such as ''[[Mario Party DS]]''. Between Burns and James, Bowser was briefly voiced by Eric Newsome in ''[[Super Paper Mario]]''. Computerized roars are still used for Bowser occasionally in such games as the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===In video games===\n\n====''Super Mario'' series====\nBowser's first appearance was in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' as the main antagonist who kidnaps [[Princess Peach]] and as the [[Boss (video gaming)|final boss]] with several false versions of him appearing as lesser bosses. In addition to breathing fire, he also throws hammers in later levels, similar to the [[Hammer Bros.]] He reappears in ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]'', in which he uses the same battle tactics as in the previous game. Although he was absent in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' (where he was replaced by [[Wart (character)|Wart]] as the final boss), he appears in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', and along with the [[Koopalings]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.screwattack.com/news/koopalings-are-not-related-bowser |title=The koopalings are NOT related to Bowser!!! |accessdate=December 3, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916012336/http://www.screwattack.com/news/koopalings-are-not-related-bowser |archivedate=September 16, 2012}}</ref> he transforms the kings of seven worlds into various different creatures and eventually capturing Princess Peach yet again. Bowser and his seven koopalings reappear in ''[[Super Mario World]]'', where they conquer Dinosaur Land and kidnap Peach while she and Mario are on vacation on Yoshi's Island. He makes his first 3D appearance in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', where he takes over Peach's castle and steals 120 Power Stars<ref>{{cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/833/833615p4.html|title=IGN Presents: The History of Super Mario Bros. \u2013 Retro Feature at IGN|publisher=Retro.ign.com|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}</ref> (150 in ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]''), scattering them through various worlds linked using the castle. He returns in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', in which his youngest, but favorite son, [[Bowser Jr.]], who is disguised as an evil version of Mario, kidnaps Peach. Bowser himself eventually appears in the final boss battle of the game. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'', Bowser is the boss of the first world, which features a battle similar to that of ''Super Mario Bros.'' After being defeated, he falls into lava and is reduced to a skeleton called Dry Bowser. He is eventually restored by Bowser Jr. and acts as the final world's boss along with his son. In ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', Bowser steals the Power Stars from [[Rosalina (Mario)|Rosalina's]] Comet Observatory and kidnaps Peach, taking her to the center of the universe to recreate it, with the intention of taking over the universe. He also appears in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'' as the final boss and primary antagonist of the game. After being defeated at the end, he grows to a much greater size, chasing Mario through the castle by breathing fireballs before Mario defeats him again. Bowser appears in the sequel ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'', once again as the main antagonist. Here, however, Bowser has grown to giant size, requiring the player to dodge more powerful attacks such as [[Meteoroid#Meteor|meteors]] and bolts of lightning. Bowser also appears in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' as the main antagonist once again where he steals Peach and uses the [[Super Mario Bros. 3|Super Leaf]] to create tailed minions. Dry Bowser also returns in this game as well. Bowser also appeared in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' along with his Koopalings in order to capture Peach once more. Dry Bowser also makes an appearance in this game. Bowser returns as the main antagonist of ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U|New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''[[New Super Luigi U|Luigi U]]'' along with the Koopalings and his son, but this time, they invade Castle Toadstool. Bowser returns once again in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' as the main antagonist who is fought thrice, including as the final boss in a form known as Meowser, and this time, he will take over the Sprixie Kingdom by kidnapping the seven Sprixies so that he may steal the kingdom's treasures. He appears once more in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' as the main antagonist, kidnapping Peach so he can marry her. He goes about various kingdoms, stealing items for his use at the wedding. He also enlisted the aid of a band of anthropomorphic rabbits named \u201cThe Broodals\u201d as his wedding planners and also to stop Mario from thwarting Bowser's wedding plans. He serves as a boss midway through the game and also as the final boss. Once all Power Moons are obtained, an alternate final battle with Bowser can be unlocked.\n\nBowser appears as a child in various games. Known as '''Baby Bowser''' (not to be confused with [[Bowser Jr.]]), he antagonizes the Baby Mario brothers and various members of the [[Yoshi]] species. He first appears in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'' where [[List of Mario franchise characters#Kamek|Kamek]] predicts the brothers will become problems in the future, so he attempts to kidnap them. He appears yet again in the sequel ''[[Yoshi's Story]]'', stealing the \"Super Happy Tree\" from a group of Yoshis. He appeared yet again in ''[[Yoshi's Island DS]]'' as a playable character to recover his castle. Baby Bowser and his older self also appeared in ''[[Yoshi's New Island]]'' as the final boss. Baby Bowser makes an appearance in ''[[Yoshi's Woolly World]]'' as the [[main antagonist]]. Baby Bowser also appears alongside adult Bowser in early installments of the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, typically as a flunky for adult Bowser but also stealing coins from players on the game boards.\n\nIn ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'', Bowser can now be placed in any non-castle level. Although he cannot throw hammers, a winged [[Bowser Jr.]] can be stacked on top of him for that purpose. A Bowser costume can also be unlocked for use in the ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' style.\n\n====Other games====\n* Bowser makes various appearances in the ''Mario'' [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]].\n** In ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', he uses Mario and the Koopa Troop to become an ally only to reclaim his castle which is stolen by the main antagonist Smithy.\n** [[List of Mario role-playing games#Paper Mario series|The ''Paper Mario'' series]]\n*** In [[Paper Mario|the first ''Paper Mario'' game]], he is the primary antagonist, stealing an item called the Star Rod and using it to empower himself.\n*** He is a lesser antagonist in ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door|The Thousand-Year Door]]'' and a minor playable character, and is a major playable character in the sequel ''[[Super Paper Mario]]''.\n*** He also appeared in ''[[Paper Mario: Sticker Star|Sticker Star]]'' as the main antagonist where he invades the [[Sticker]] Fest ceremony and serves as the final boss with the sixth and final Royal Sticker. Unlike the other games, this is the first ''Paper Mario'' game he doesn't talk.\n*** He appears in ''[[Paper Mario: Color Splash|Color Splash]]'' as the main antagonist. However, unusually, he is unintentionally evil in this game, having been corrupted by poisonous black paint he accidentally created, turning him into Black Bowser. Under its influence, Black Bowser plans to cover Prism Island, as well as the Mushroom Kingdom in black paint.\n** [[List of Mario role-playing games#Mario & Luigi series|The ''Mario & Luigi'' series]]\n*** He plays minor antagonistic and supporting roles in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga|Superstar Saga]]'', where he aids Mario and Luigi in battling the witch Cackletta. At one point in the story, he loses his memory after a big clunk on the head and becomes '''Rookie''', the assistant of master thief Popple. After regaining it, he gets possessed by Cackletta's spirit, becoming '''Bowletta'''.\n**** In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions|Bowser's Minions]]'' he reprises his role from the original ''Superstar Saga'', only that this time his minions are fighting back against [[Fawful]]'s forces to free their leader.\n*** Its prequel/sequel, ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time|Partners in Time]]'', features both Bowser and Baby Bowser as minor antagonists (the major antagonists are an alien race called the Shroobs). Baby Bowser races against the Bros. to rebuild an artifact called the Cobalt Star, while Bowser, after failing to kidnap an impostor Peach, is enhanced by the elder Princess Shroob and becomes the final boss called '''Shrowser'''. Both Bowser and Baby Bowser also team up at one point to fight the Bros.\n*** In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story|Bowser's Inside Story]]'' and its 3DS remake ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story#Remake|Bowser Jr.'s Journey]]'', Bowser is the main protagonist and a playable character, with Mario and Luigi supporting him from inside his body without his knowledge. Although he is one of the game's three protagonists, he is still fought twice in the game as a boss by the Mario Bros.\n*** In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team|Dream Team]]'', he appeared as the main antagonist and major boss, being fought three times, including as the final boss where he becomes Dreamy Bowser. He forms an alliance with the initial antagonist Antasma, but later betrays Antasma (which he intended to do for a while).\n*** ''[[Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam|Paper Jam]]'', a crossover 3DS game, features both Bowser and his paper counterpart (Paper Bowser), similar to '''''Partners in Time''''' where Bowser and Baby Bowser meet each other, who team up.\n* In ''[[Super Princess Peach]]'', he uses the power of the Vibe Scepter to capture Mario and Luigi (prompting Princess Peach herself to come to their rescue).\n* He serves as the final boss in ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' in a battle on the roof of the titular mansion itself. Throughout the battle, it becomes apparent that this incarnation is [[King Boo]] inside a Bowser costume, which falls inert to the floor if Luigi is victorious.\n* Bowser also appears as a playable character in the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series and various [[List of Mario sports games|''Mario'' sports titles]], such as ''[[Mario Golf]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis|Tennis]]'' and all five ''[[List of Mario sports games#Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games series|Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'' installments. Dry Bowser also appears in some of the sports games occasionally as a playable character, being an independent character as opposed to being a form of Bowser.\n* He also appears frequently in the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series as a [[non-playable character]], with a space that, if players land on it, causes him to appear and either steal Stars or coins or make the players play his [[minigames]]. He finally gets to be playable in ''[[Mario Party 10]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Party]]''.\n* Bowser is a selectable character within ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|3DS/Wii U]]'', and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate|Ultimate]]''. In these games is a form called '''Giga Bowser''', a darker and more monstrous form with added power elements to his attacks. This form is an unplayable boss character in ''Melee'', and is fought in Adventure Mode and the final Event Match (alongside [[Mewtwo]] and [[Ganondorf]]), while in ''Brawl'', ''3DS'' and ''Wii U'', it serves as a temporary playable transformation with the Final Smash. This monstrous form appears again as a boss in the Classic Mode of ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate|Ultimate]]''. In The Subspace Emissary from ''Brawl'', Bowser is unplayable for most of the story and only becomes playable after [[King Dedede]] defeats him in a duel.\n* In the Wii U and Switch version of ''[[Bayonetta|Bayonetta 1]]'' and ''[[Bayonetta 2|2]]'', Bowser makes a cameo in which Bayonetta can summon his fists and feet when wearing the game's unlockable Princesses Peach and Daisy costumes.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n* Bowser appears as one of the [[List of Skylanders characters#SuperChargers|Skylanders]] in ''[[Skylanders: SuperChargers]]'' as a fire element SuperCharger along with Spitfire and the SuperCharger version of Eruptor. His signature vehicle is the Clown Cruiser. He is only available on the Wii, the Wii U, and the Nintendo 3DS along with [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]].\n* Bowser also appears in the SNES version of [[SimCity (1989 video game)|''SimCity'']]; he is the one attacking the player's city during the monster attack disaster instead of the monster resembling Godzilla in the original PC release.\n* In the 1996 game ''[[Tetris Attack]]'', he is the final boss fought on Hard and the hidden Super Hard difficulties in both the SNES and GB versions.\n\n===In other media===\n[[File:Bowserwreckitralph.png|thumb|The \"Bad-Anon\" villain meeting from ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'' features Bowser and other various well-known video game characters, including [[Ghosts (Pac-Man)|Clyde]], [[Doctor Eggman]], [[M.

The character is typically referred to as \"King Koopa\" rather than Bowser. His appearance in the cartoons was also different than his video game appearances. He had green skin and lacked his red hair and ability to breathe fire, although he did wield a magic wand similar to those seen in ''Super Mario Bros. 3''.\n** Bowser uses various [[alter ego]]s in ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'' to match some of the episodes' titles.\n** In ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Bowser was assisted by his Koopa Kids, who received different names in the show.\n** In ''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'', Bowser and the Koopa Kids returned to fight Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, and Princess Peach in [[Super Mario (series)#Settings|Dinosaur Land]].\n* In 1989, Bowser, again referred to as \"King Koopa\", hosted a live action show entitled ''[[King Koopa's Kool Kartoons]]''. On this half-hour program, Bowser gives away prizes to the children.\n* Bowser appears as the antagonist in the ''Mario'' comics published as part of the [[Nintendo Comics System]].\n* In the 1993 [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|''Super Mario Bros.'']] movie, Bowser was played by [[Dennis Hopper]].

In the first sketch, \"Koopa Soup\", he advertises a new kind of soup served in a Koopa shell. In the second sketch, \"Franklin & Crash\", he is briefly seen trying to stop Mario from rescuing Peach before the castle he is guarding is crushed, then agrees to go buy some soda with Mario afterwards.\n* In late 2018, [[Bowsette]], a fan-made powered-up version of Bowser using the Super Crown power-up from ''[[New Super Mario Bros.

Miyamoto and Tezuka then began to work together to define Bowser's appearance. Since the character was the leader of the turtle-like Koopa Troopas the two began to base his new appearance on them, creating a new illustration. In his final design, Miyamoto commented that he could make Bowser \"look cool now\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Iwata Asks Volume 8- Flipnote Studios-An Animation Class 4.My First Project: Draw a Rug |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/systems/volume_8_14207.html#top |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120525101151/http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/systems/volume_8_14207.html#top |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 25, 2012 }}2009-08-11</ref>\n\nMiyamoto named him {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u5927|\u5927]] [[wikt:\u9b54|\u9b54]] [[wikt:\u738b|\u738b]] \u30af\u30c3\u30d1}} ''Daima\u014d Kuppa''.

(film)|''Super Mario Bros.'' film]], Bowser is portrayed by [[Dennis Hopper]] and is called President Koopa. He is also briefly referred to as King Koopa. This incarnation is almost entirely human in appearance, with blonde hair he gels in the shape of a crown, and he frequently wears a black business suit and tie. However, after brief exposure to his own evolution-reversing device by the Mario Bros., he starts occasionally possessing some reptilian traits. The climax of the film sees Koopa devolve into an enormous green [[Tyrannosaurus|''Tyrannosaurus rex'']] to battle the Mario Bros., but he is further devolved into primordial ooze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smbmovie.com/SMBArchive/specials/interviews/2_JeffGoodwin_3-30-09.html|title=Super Mario Bros. The Movie Archive|publisher=Smbmovie.com|date=March 30, 2009|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nBowser is portrayed as the \"King of the [[Koopa Troopa|Koopas]]\", [[anthropomorphic]] [[turtle]]s that inhabit the world of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. Bowser differs greatly from the rest of the Koopa clan, which consists mainly of bipedal tortoises. He is characterized by a large, spiked [[turtle shell]], horns, a draconic muzzle, razor-sharp fangs, taloned fingers, three clawed toes on each foot, red eyes and a shock of red hair.\n\nHe is physically endowed with immense strength, is nearly indestructible, and can [[Fire breathing|breathe fire]]. He can also jump surprisingly high for his large size, although his [[speed]] and [[agility]] are most of the time lacking. He is also accomplished in black magic, thanks to which he can teleport himself or summon objects, fly, generate a huge amount of electricity, use telekinesis or metamorphose.\n\nBowser's physical size tends to vary from game to game. In most games, he towers over the majority of characters, but there are exceptions. In ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', he stands only slightly taller than Mario. He is shown changing his size at will or through others' sorcery in games including ''[[Yoshi's Island]]'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]''.\n\nBowser aspires to take over the Mushroom Kingdom and merge it with his own realm. He is infatuated with [[Princess Peach]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars Strategy Guide}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game|title=Paper Mario|developer=Intelligent Systems}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game|title=Super Paper Mario|developer=Intelligent Systems}}</ref> and routinely kidnaps her as part of his plans for domination.<ref name=Screwattack /> Sometimes, he kidnaps Peach simply to lure [[Mario]] into a trap, but occasionally he hopes to marry her.\n\nThe character's role in the franchise varies. He is typically the main antagonist in the main series, but in [[List of Mario role-playing games|the RPG series]], he sometimes works with the heroes to defeat a greater evil.<ref>''[[Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars]]'', ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'', ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'', and ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story]]''.</ref> The RPGs also portray Bowser in a more humorous light as a blustering, buffoonish [[Bullying|bully]] with a hidden softer side. He also cares for his minions.\n\nBowser has a son, [[Bowser Jr.]], who helps his father kidnap Princess Peach. Bowser Jr.'s mother is unknown, as Bowser isn't officially confirmed as having a previous marriage yet. Originally in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Bowser was stated to be the father of the [[Koopalings]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clv/manuals/ja/pdf/CLV-P-HAACJ.pdf |title=Original Japanese manual of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''. |publisher= Nintendo Co., Ltd. |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}</ref> with subsequent official sources adding that he was their biological father,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/NES/Super-Mario-Bros-3-279558.html |title=''Super Mario Bros. 3'' page on Nintendo UK's site. |publisher= Nintendo UK |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>\"''Bowser, King of the Koopas, and his evil offspring have invaded yet another kingdom.

Then, in the 2002 release of ''Super Mario Sunshine'', [[radio personality]] and voice actor Scott Burns gave Bowser his first spoken dialogue and continued portraying him for several more years. With the late 2005 release of ''[[Super Mario Strikers]]'', Kenneth W. James became the new voice actor for Bowser. Although, for a few years, old recordings of Burns were reused for games after James took the role, such as ''[[Mario Party DS]]''. Between Burns and James, Bowser was briefly voiced by Eric Newsome in ''[[Super Paper Mario]]''. Computerized roars are still used for Bowser occasionally in such games as the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===In video games===\n\n====''Super Mario'' series====\nBowser's first appearance was in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' as the main antagonist who kidnaps [[Princess Peach]] and as the [[Boss (video gaming)|final boss]] with several false versions of him appearing as lesser bosses. In addition to breathing fire, he also throws hammers in later levels, similar to the [[Hammer Bros.]] He reappears in ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]'', in which he uses the same battle tactics as in the previous game. Although he was absent in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' (where he was replaced by [[Wart (character)|Wart]] as the final boss), he appears in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', and along with the [[Koopalings]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.screwattack.com/news/koopalings-are-not-related-bowser |title=The koopalings are NOT related to Bowser!!! |accessdate=December 3, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916012336/http://www.screwattack.com/news/koopalings-are-not-related-bowser |archivedate=September 16, 2012}}</ref> he transforms the kings of seven worlds into various different creatures and eventually capturing Princess Peach yet again. Bowser and his seven koopalings reappear in ''[[Super Mario World]]'', where they conquer Dinosaur Land and kidnap Peach while she and Mario are on vacation on Yoshi's Island. He makes his first 3D appearance in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', where he takes over Peach's castle and steals 120 Power Stars<ref>{{cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/833/833615p4.html|title=IGN Presents: The History of Super Mario Bros. \u2013 Retro Feature at IGN|publisher=Retro.ign.com|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}</ref> (150 in ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]''), scattering them through various worlds linked using the castle. He returns in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', in which his youngest, but favorite son, [[Bowser Jr.]], who is disguised as an evil version of Mario, kidnaps Peach. Bowser himself eventually appears in the final boss battle of the game. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'', Bowser is the boss of the first world, which features a battle similar to that of ''Super Mario Bros.'' After being defeated, he falls into lava and is reduced to a skeleton called Dry Bowser. He is eventually restored by Bowser Jr. and acts as the final world's boss along with his son. In ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', Bowser steals the Power Stars from [[Rosalina (Mario)|Rosalina's]] Comet Observatory and kidnaps Peach, taking her to the center of the universe to recreate it, with the intention of taking over the universe. He also appears in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'' as the final boss and primary antagonist of the game. After being defeated at the end, he grows to a much greater size, chasing Mario through the castle by breathing fireballs before Mario defeats him again. Bowser appears in the sequel ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'', once again as the main antagonist. Here, however, Bowser has grown to giant size, requiring the player to dodge more powerful attacks such as [[Meteoroid#Meteor|meteors]] and bolts of lightning. Bowser also appears in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' as the main antagonist once again where he steals Peach and uses the [[Super Mario Bros. 3|Super Leaf]] to create tailed minions. Dry Bowser also returns in this game as well. Bowser also appeared in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' along with his Koopalings in order to capture Peach once more. Dry Bowser also makes an appearance in this game. Bowser returns as the main antagonist of ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U|New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''[[New Super Luigi U|Luigi U]]'' along with the Koopalings and his son, but this time, they invade Castle Toadstool. Bowser returns once again in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' as the main antagonist who is fought thrice, including as the final boss in a form known as Meowser, and this time, he will take over the Sprixie Kingdom by kidnapping the seven Sprixies so that he may steal the kingdom's treasures. He appears once more in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' as the main antagonist, kidnapping Peach so he can marry her. He goes about various kingdoms, stealing items for his use at the wedding. He also enlisted the aid of a band of anthropomorphic rabbits named \u201cThe Broodals\u201d as his wedding planners and also to stop Mario from thwarting Bowser's wedding plans. He serves as a boss midway through the game and also as the final boss. Once all Power Moons are obtained, an alternate final battle with Bowser can be unlocked.\n\nBowser appears as a child in various games. Known as '''Baby Bowser''' (not to be confused with [[Bowser Jr.]]), he antagonizes the Baby Mario brothers and various members of the [[Yoshi]] species. He first appears in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'' where [[List of Mario franchise characters#Kamek|Kamek]] predicts the brothers will become problems in the future, so he attempts to kidnap them. He appears yet again in the sequel ''[[Yoshi's Story]]'', stealing the \"Super Happy Tree\" from a group of Yoshis. He appeared yet again in ''[[Yoshi's Island DS]]'' as a playable character to recover his castle. Baby Bowser and his older self also appeared in ''[[Yoshi's New Island]]'' as the final boss. Baby Bowser makes an appearance in ''[[Yoshi's Woolly World]]'' as the [[main antagonist]]. Baby Bowser also appears alongside adult Bowser in early installments of the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, typically as a flunky for adult Bowser but also stealing coins from players on the game boards.\n\nIn ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'', Bowser can now be placed in any non-castle level. Although he cannot throw hammers, a winged [[Bowser Jr.]] can be stacked on top of him for that purpose. A Bowser costume can also be unlocked for use in the ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' style.\n\n====Other games====\n* Bowser makes various appearances in the ''Mario'' [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]].\n** In ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', he uses Mario and the Koopa Troop to become an ally only to reclaim his castle which is stolen by the main antagonist Smithy.\n** [[List of Mario role-playing games#Paper Mario series|The ''Paper Mario'' series]]\n*** In [[Paper Mario|the first ''Paper Mario'' game]], he is the primary antagonist, stealing an item called the Star Rod and using it to empower himself.\n*** He is a lesser antagonist in ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door|The Thousand-Year Door]]'' and a minor playable character, and is a major playable character in the sequel ''[[Super Paper Mario]]''.\n*** He also appeared in ''[[Paper Mario: Sticker Star|Sticker Star]]'' as the main antagonist where he invades the [[Sticker]] Fest ceremony and serves as the final boss with the sixth and final Royal Sticker. Unlike the other games, this is the first ''Paper Mario'' game he doesn't talk.\n*** He appears in ''[[Paper Mario: Color Splash|Color Splash]]'' as the main antagonist. However, unusually, he is unintentionally evil in this game, having been corrupted by poisonous black paint he accidentally created, turning him into Black Bowser. Under its influence, Black Bowser plans to cover Prism Island, as well as the Mushroom Kingdom in black paint.\n** [[List of Mario role-playing games#Mario & Luigi series|The ''Mario & Luigi'' series]]\n*** He plays minor antagonistic and supporting roles in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga|Superstar Saga]]'', where he aids Mario and Luigi in battling the witch Cackletta. At one point in the story, he loses his memory after a big clunk on the head and becomes '''Rookie''', the assistant of master thief Popple. After regaining it, he gets possessed by Cackletta's spirit, becoming '''Bowletta'''.\n**** In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions|Bowser's Minions]]'' he reprises his role from the original ''Superstar Saga'', only that this time his minions are fighting back against [[Fawful]]'s forces to free their leader.\n*** Its prequel/sequel, ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time|Partners in Time]]'', features both Bowser and Baby Bowser as minor antagonists (the major antagonists are an alien race called the Shroobs). Baby Bowser races against the Bros. to rebuild an artifact called the Cobalt Star, while Bowser, after failing to kidnap an impostor Peach, is enhanced by the elder Princess Shroob and becomes the final boss called '''Shrowser'''. Both Bowser and Baby Bowser also team up at one point to fight the Bros.\n*** In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story|Bowser's Inside Story]]'' and its 3DS remake ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story#Remake|Bowser Jr.'s Journey]]'', Bowser is the main protagonist and a playable character, with Mario and Luigi supporting him from inside his body without his knowledge. Although he is one of the game's three protagonists, he is still fought twice in the game as a boss by the Mario Bros.\n*** In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team|Dream Team]]'', he appeared as the main antagonist and major boss, being fought three times, including as the final boss where he becomes Dreamy Bowser. He forms an alliance with the initial antagonist Antasma, but later betrays Antasma (which he intended to do for a while).\n*** ''[[Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam|Paper Jam]]'', a crossover 3DS game, features both Bowser and his paper counterpart (Paper Bowser), similar to '''''Partners in Time''''' where Bowser and Baby Bowser meet each other, who team up.\n* In ''[[Super Princess Peach]]'', he uses the power of the Vibe Scepter to capture Mario and Luigi (prompting Princess Peach herself to come to their rescue).\n* He serves as the final boss in ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' in a battle on the roof of the titular mansion itself. Throughout the battle, it becomes apparent that this incarnation is [[King Boo]] inside a Bowser costume, which falls inert to the floor if Luigi is victorious.\n* Bowser also appears as a playable character in the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series and various [[List of Mario sports games|''Mario'' sports titles]], such as ''[[Mario Golf]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis|Tennis]]'' and all five ''[[List of Mario sports games#Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games series|Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'' installments. Dry Bowser also appears in some of the sports games occasionally as a playable character, being an independent character as opposed to being a form of Bowser.\n* He also appears frequently in the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series as a [[non-playable character]], with a space that, if players land on it, causes him to appear and either steal Stars or coins or make the players play his [[minigames]]. He finally gets to be playable in ''[[Mario Party 10]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Party]]''.\n* Bowser is a selectable character within ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|3DS/Wii U]]'', and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate|Ultimate]]''. In these games is a form called '''Giga Bowser''', a darker and more monstrous form with added power elements to his attacks. This form is an unplayable boss character in ''Melee'', and is fought in Adventure Mode and the final Event Match (alongside [[Mewtwo]] and [[Ganondorf]]), while in ''Brawl'', ''3DS'' and ''Wii U''', it serves as a temporary playable transformation with the Final Smash. This monstrous form appears again as a boss in the Classic Mode of ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate|Ultimate]]''. In The Subspace Emissary from ''Brawl'', Bowser is unplayable for most of the story and only becomes playable after [[King Dedede]] defeats him in a duel.\n* In the Wii U version of ''[[Bayonetta|Bayonetta 1]]'' and ''[[Bayonetta 2|2]]'', Bowser makes a cameo in which Bayonetta can summon his fists and feet when wearing the game's unlockable Princesses Peach and Daisy costumes.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n* Bowser appears as one of the [[List of Skylanders characters#SuperChargers|Skylanders]] in ''[[Skylanders: SuperChargers]]'' as a fire element SuperCharger along with Spitfire and the SuperCharger version of Eruptor. His signature vehicle is the Clown Cruiser. He is only available on the Wii, the Wii U, and the Nintendo 3DS along with [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]].\n* Bowser also appears in the SNES version of [[SimCity (1989 video game)|''SimCity'']]; he is the one attacking the player's city during the monster attack disaster instead of the monster resembling Godzilla in the original PC release.\n* In the 1996 game ''[[Tetris Attack]]'', he is the final boss fought on Hard and the hidden Super Hard difficulties in both the SNES and GB versions.\n\n===In other media===\n[[File:Bowserwreckitralph.png|thumb|The \"Bad-Anon\" villain meeting from ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'' features Bowser and other various well-known video game characters, including [[Ghosts (Pac-Man)|Clyde]], [[Doctor Eggman]], [[M.

The character is typically referred to as \"King Koopa\" rather than Bowser. His appearance in the cartoons was also different than his video game appearances. He had green skin and lacked his red hair and ability to breathe fire, although he did wield a magic wand similar to those seen in ''Super Mario Bros. 3''.\n** Bowser uses various [[alter ego]]s in ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'' to match some of the episodes' titles.\n** In ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Bowser was assisted by his Koopa Kids, who received different names in the show.\n** In ''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'', Bowser and the Koopa Kids returned to fight Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, and Princess Peach in [[Super Mario (series)#Settings|Dinosaur Land]].\n* In 1989, Bowser, again referred to as \"King Koopa\", hosted a live action show entitled ''[[King Koopa's Kool Kartoons]]''. On this half-hour program, Bowser gives away prizes to the children.\n* Bowser appears as the antagonist in the ''Mario'' comics published as part of the [[Nintendo Comics System]].\n* In the 1993 [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|''Super Mario Bros.'']] movie, Bowser was played by [[Dennis Hopper]]. Here, he is President Koopa but is called \"King Koopa,\" who usurped the throne of the parallel-universe city of Dinohattan. Rather than a turtle, Koopa is a humanoid evolved from dinosaurs. Koopa is defeated when Mario and Luigi devolve him first into a [[Tyrannosaurus]] and then into primordial slime. The film version of Bowser/Koopa was met with significant criticism, and was mentioned by Hopper as the worst role he has ever played.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/dennis-hopper-speaks-candidly-about-his-role-as-king-koopa-110566.phtml|title=Dennis Hopper speaks candidly about his role as King Koopa|publisher=Destructoid|accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>\n* Bowser was played by [[Christopher Hewett]] in the 1989 ''[[Ice Capades]]''.\n* Bowser also appears in the [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] game ''[[Hotel Mario]]'' as a final boss.\n* Bowser appears in the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'' as one of the video game villains that attend the villain support group Bad-Anon. When Wreck-It Ralph mentions his interest in not being a villain anymore, Bowser reacts to this by [[Fire breathing|breathing fire]] similar to a [[spit take]] since he was drinking something at the time. Later near the end of the film, Ralph expresses his success of being a real hero and gaining some respect from Bowser and the other villains, who applaud him.\n* Bowser appears in two sketches in two separate episodes of the ''[[Mad (TV series)|MAD]]'' television series, voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]] both times. In the first sketch, \"Koopa Soup\", he advertises a new kind of soup served in a Koopa shell. In the second sketch, \"Franklin & Crash\", he is briefly seen trying to stop Mario from rescuing Peach before the castle he is guarding is crushed, then agrees to go buy some soda with Mario afterwards.\n* In late 2018, [[Bowsette]], a fan-made powered-up version of Bowser using the Super Crown power-up from ''[[New Super Mario Bros.

[[Vassar Clements]] originally wrote the basic [[melody]] an [[octave]] lower, in a tune called \"Lonesome Fiddle Blues\" released on Clements' self-titled 1975 album on which Charlie Daniels played guitar. The Charlie Daniels Band moved it up an octave and put words to it. The song's verses are closer to being spoken rather than sung (i.e., [[recitation song|recitation]]), and tell the story of a young man named Johnny, in a variant on the classic [[deal with the Devil]]. The performances of [[Satan]] and Johnny are played as instrumental bridges. The song was the band's biggest hit, reaching number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], prevented from further chart movement by \"[[After The Love Has Gone]]\" by [[Earth, Wind and Fire]] and \"[[My Sharona]]\" by [[The Knack]].<ref>Whitburn, Joel: \"The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits\", p. 92, {{ISBN|0-8230-7518-4}}</ref> \n\nIt is featured in the 1980 film ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'', whose choreographer, [[Patsy Swayze]], claims that she set the song's tempo. \"How fast can you dance it?\" Daniels asked. \"How fast can you play it?\" Swayze replied, but considering that the song was recorded in December 1978 and ''Urban Cowboy'' was filmed in 1979, it would have been impossible for Swayze to set the recorded song's tempo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rolandnote.com/people.php?scode=btimelines&keyword=Epic+Records&sorting=DESC&page=46|title=RolandNote.com: The Ultimate Country Music Database|website=www.rolandnote.com|access-date=2017-08-29}}</ref>\n\n==Content==\n{{Original research section|date=July 2016}}\nThe song is an uptempo [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] song about the [[Devil]]'s failed attempt to gain a young man's [[soul]]{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} through a [[fiddle]]-playing contest that involves enticing the young man's participation with a worldly prize. The song begins as a disappointed Devil arrives in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], apparently \"way behind\" on stealing [[soul]]s, when he comes upon a fiddle-playing young man named Johnny. At that moment, Johnny happens to be playing his fiddle impressively \"hot.\" Out of desperation, the Devil, who as it turns out also plays the fiddle, offers Johnny the [[Gamble|wager]] which involves challenging the young man to a fiddle-playing contest. The Devil offers to give Johnny a [[gold]]en fiddle if the young man plays better than he does; otherwise, the Devil will gain Johnny's soul. Although Johnny believes taking the Devil's bet might be a [[sin]], he wagers his soul without fear, confidently boasting that he is \"the best that's ever been.\"\n\nThe Devil plays his fiddle first, to a contemporary [[rock music]] theme with the backing of [[demon]] musicians. When the Devil's performance ends, Johnny compliments him and takes his own turn, making reference to four songs. Two are traditional songs of [[Appalachia]] -- \"Fire on the Mountain\" (also the name of Daniels' 1974 album) and \"Granny Does Your Dog Bite?\" (the latter traditionally known as \"Granny Will Your Dog Bite?\"). The third is an unnamed [[square dance]] melody that includes the [[patter]], \"Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough.\" (The country music standard \"[[Ida Red]]\", as most famously recorded by [[Bob Wills|Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys]], includes the lyric \"Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough / Granny will your dog bite, no child no.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classic-country-song-lyrics.com/idaredlyricschords.html|title=Ida Red lyrics chords {{!}} Bob Wills|website=www.classic-country-song-lyrics.com|access-date=2017-01-20}}</ref>) The last is a traditional American southern [[folk song]] \"[[The House of the Rising Sun]].\" The four songs are not performed but are only mentioned by reference. The Devil is impressed, admits defeat, and lays the golden fiddle at Johnny's feet. Johnny repeats his claim to be the best player ever and dares the Devil to a rematch in the future.\n\nJohnny's final boast, as originally recorded for the ''[[Million Mile Reflections]]'' album, goes ''\"I done told you once, you son of a bitch, I'm the best that's ever been.\"'' To accommodate radio airplay (both Country and Top 40 formats), the 45 RPM single release [[Overdubbing|overdubbed]] that portion of the lyric as ''\"'Cause I told you once, '''you son of a gun,''' I'm the best that's ever been.\"'' (The uncensored album version appears on the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Urban Cowboy#Soundtrack|Urban Cowboy]]'',<ref name=\"billboard\"/> and it is this version that has been used on numerous music compilations since then.)

The devil is convinced that Johnny's [[Hubris|sinful pride]] will be his undoing, so he takes back the golden fiddle he lost to Johnny, now married and with an infant son, and forces him to practice with his old fiddle before their rematch. \n \nThough the lyrics of the song state that \"Johnny's the best that's ever been\", reiterating his bold claim in the original song, the sequel's lyrics do not reveal who won the rematch.

{"title_page": "Dawg Pound", "text_new": "[[File:2015 Dawg Pound.png|thumb|right|180px|Official logo as of 2015]]\nThe '''Dawg Pound''' is the name of the bleacher section behind the east [[end zone]] in [[FirstEnergy Stadium]], the home field of the [[Cleveland Browns]], a [[National Football League]] (NFL) franchise based in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. It is known for having passionate fans.\n\n==Formation==\n[[File:ClevelandMunicipalStadium1993Outfield.jpg|thumb|East end zone bleachers at [[Cleveland Stadium]], home to the original Dawg Pound]]\nAccording to [[Hanford Dixon]], then a [[cornerback]] with the [[Cleveland Browns|Browns]], Dixon himself gave his defensive teammates the name \"Dawgs\" to inspire them before the 1985 season. The Dawg Pound started during the 1985 training camp at [[Lakeland Community College]] in [[Kirtland, Ohio|Kirtland]]. Dixon and fellow cornerback [[Frank Minnifield]] started the idea of the pound by using the dog-versus-cat relationship between the quarterback and the defense. \"We had the idea of the quarterback being the cat, and the defensive line being the dog,\" Dixon said. \"Whenever the defense would get a regular sack or a coverage sack the defensive linemen and linebackers would bark.\" This attitude carried into the stands at the training camp, where fans started barking along with the players. Dixon and Minnifield then put up the first \"Dawg Pound\" banner in front of the bleachers before the first [[preseason]] game at old [[Cleveland Stadium]]. The bleacher section had the cheapest seats in the stadium, and its fans were already known as the most vocal. They adopted their new identity whole-heartedly, wearing [[dog]] [[nose]]s, dog [[mask]]s, bone-shaped [[hat]]s and other outlandish [[costume]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cleveland Browns: the official illustrated history |first=Ron |last=Smith |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1999 |publisher=[[The Sporting News]] |location=St. Louis |isbn=0-89204-625-2 |page=182 }}</ref>\n\n==Notoriety==\nDawg Pound fans quickly developed a reputation for misbehavior as well as vociferousness. Team officials banned the carrying of [[dog food]] into the stadium, as bleacher fans would shower the visiting team with [[Milk-Bone]]s, along with eggs, batteries, and other objects. Dawg Pound fans also consumed hefty amounts of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], even sneaking a [[keg]] into the stadium inside of a [[doghouse]].<ref>[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/417030-six-points-before-the-dawg-pound-was-neutered Dawg Pound \"neutered\" - Bleacher Report.com]</ref> Their reputation was such that other teams' rowdy fans would often be compared to them - in 1989, when a [[Cincinnati Bengals]] game was halted by the throwing of debris at the visiting [[Seattle Seahawks]], Bengals coach [[Sam Wyche]] addressed the crowd, angrily reminding them that, \"You don't live in Cleveland, you live in Cincinnati!\" <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJMa20xXykI Wyche addresses fans - You Tube]</ref>\n\nOn at least one occasion, Dawg Pound rowdiness affected the outcome of a game. In the fourth quarter of a 1989 game against the hated [[Denver Broncos]], the rain of [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], rocks, eggs, and other debris coming down from the bleachers was endangering the safety of the players. To move the action away from the east end, referee [[Tom Dooley (American football official)|Tom Dooley]] had the teams switch sides. That put the wind at the Browns' back. The Browns won on a [[Matt Bahr]] [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] that barely cleared the crossbar.<ref>[http://www.cleveland.com/brownshistory/plaindealer/index.ssf?/browns/more/history/19891001BROWNS.html Browns vs Broncos 10-1-89 - Cleveland Plain Dealer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618004410/http://www.cleveland.com/brownshistory/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fbrowns%2Fmore%2Fhistory%2F19891001BROWNS.html |date=2012-06-18 }}</ref>\n\nAt the final game at Cleveland Stadium in December 1995, members of the Dawg Pound ripped the bleachers from the stands (many having brought [[wrenches]], [[crowbar (tool)|crowbar]]s, and other tools to dislodge the seats).

The new Pound differs from the original in having two decks, but like the Dawg Pound of Cleveland Municipal Stadium, the new stadium's Dawg Pound seats are all bleachers. The Dawg Pound [[personal seat license]] was one of the most expensive in the new Stadium.\n\nThe new Pound also has official recognition from the team. The team [[trademark]]ed a Dawg Pound [[logo]], which it uses on select fan memorabilia. This logo was created by NFL Properties and is the only such logo developed for an NFL fan base by the league. It is featured on officially licensed Browns merchandise such as T-shirts, pennants, bumper stickers, etc.\n\n[[File:Dawgpoundlogo.jpg|right|thumb|222px|Original Dawg Pound logo from the team's return in 1999.]]\nThe establishment nature of the new Pound, as well as the more-sterile atmosphere of the new stadium, originally turned off some veteran fans, especially the old \"[[blue-collar]]\" fan base.  This has resulted from what was originally a player and fan movement - the Dawg Pound - having been made \"corporate,\" by the Browns organization, including trademarks, copyrights and an official \"Dawg Pound\" logo.  Also, the more sterile, corporate atmosphere at the new FirstEnergy Stadium (as opposed to the near anarchy at the old stadium in the 1960s-1990s) has been viewed by more traditionalist Browns fans and Dawg Pound season ticket holders as tarnishing the history and traditional passion of the fanbase.<ref>[http://www.chatsports.com/cleveland-browns/a/How-I-was-ejected-for-standing-in-the-Dawg-Pound-10-27-293 \"New Pound\" complaints - Chat Sports.com]</ref>\n\n===\"Bottlegate\"===\nIn a crucial late-season 2001 game against the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], the Browns were driving toward the east end zone for what would have been the winning score. A controversial call on fourth down gave the Jaguars the ball. Browns' receiver [[Quincy Morgan]] had caught a pass for a first down on 4th and 1.  After [[Tim Couch]] spiked the ball on the next play, referee [[Terry McAulay]] reviewed Morgan's catch, claiming that the replay officials had buzzed him before Couch spiked the ball. (NFL Rules state that once the next play is completed, the officials cannot under any circumstances review any previous plays.) Upon reviewing the play, McAulay determined that Morgan never had control of the ball, thus the pass was incomplete, and the Jaguars were awarded the ball. Fans in the Dawg Pound began throwing plastic [[beer bottle]]s (a recently introduced concept from the team's beer sponsor, [[Miller Lite]]) and other objects on the players and officials. McAulay declared the game over and sent the teams to the locker rooms. NFL Commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] then called to override the referee's decision, sending the players back onto the field, where the Jaguars ran out the last seconds under a hail of debris.  The incident then would become known as \"Bottlegate\",<ref>[http://nesn.com/2014/01/bottlegate-referee-terry-mcauley-to-lead-super-bowl-xlviii-officiating-crew \"Bottlegate\" referee to officiate Super Bowl - NESN.com]</ref> and resulted in the immediate ban of plastic beer bottles from future Browns home games.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cleveland19.com/story/890359/browns-ban-plastic-bottles-of-beer|title=Browns Ban Plastic Bottles Of Beer|last=Withers|first=Tom|date=2 August 2002|publisher=[[WOIO]] via [[The Associated Press]]|accessdate=18 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n===\"GPODAWUND\"===\nIn October 2016, a group of Browns fans accidentally swapped two parts of a large three-part banner, causing it to read \"This is the GPODAWUND.\"  <ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ftw/2016/10/30/this-botched-gpodawund-banner-perfectly-encapsulates-the-2016-browns/93017812/ GPODAWUND?

Since construction of the new stadium, the Dawg Pound is populated by more affluent attendees compared to the generally [[blue collar]] fan base that made the Municipal Stadium's Dawg Pound famous. Baseball Hall-of-Famer [[Hank Aaron]] often attended Browns games at Municipal Stadium and would sit in the Dawg Pound among the fans, albeit incognito.<ref>Garner, Joe. ''And The Crowd Goes Wild: Relive the Most Celebrated Sporting Events Ever Broadcast''. Foreword written by Aaron. Sourcebooks, 1998.</ref>\n\nOne of the more famous Dawg Pound season-ticket holders is [[John Big Dawg Thompson]] (he had a legal [[name change]] to include his nickname), known as the \"Canine-in-Chief.\"  Television cameras often showed the offensive-lineman-sized man in his dog mask and No. 98 jersey, although recently he has undergone [[gastric bypass]] surgery and lost considerable weight. In 1995, Thompson became an unofficial spokesman for Browns fans fighting the move of the team to Baltimore. He testified before the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]] and appeared on ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' with [[Bill Maher]].<ref>[http://www.southcoasttoday.com/daily/02-96/02-07-96/8nfl.htm New NFL math hard to figure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310130307/http://www.southcoasttoday.com/daily/02-96/02-07-96/8nfl.htm |date=2007-03-10 }}.

The new Pound differs from the original in having two decks, but like the Dawg Pound of Cleveland Municipal Stadium, the new stadium's Dawg Pound seats are all bleachers. The Dawg Pound [[personal seat license]] was one of the most expensive in the new Stadium.\n\nThe new Pound also has official recognition from the team. The team [[trademark]]ed a Dawg Pound [[logo]], which it uses on select fan memorabilia. This logo was created by NFL Properties and is the only such logo developed for an NFL fan base by the league. It is featured on officially licensed Browns merchandise such as T-shirts, pennants, bumper stickers, etc.\n\n[[File:Dawgpoundlogo.jpg|right|thumb|222px|Original Dawg Pound logo from the team's return in 1999.]]\nThe establishment nature of the new Pound, as well as the more-sterile atmosphere of the new stadium, originally turned off some veteran fans, especially the old \"[[blue-collar]]\" fan base.  This has resulted from what was originally a player and fan movement - the Dawg Pound - having been made \"corporate,\" by the Browns organization, including trademarks, copyrights and an official \"Dawg Pound\" logo.  Also, the more sterile, corporate atmosphere at the new FirstEnergy Stadium (as opposed to the near anarchy at the old stadium in the 1960s-1990s) has been viewed by more traditionalist Browns fans and Dawg Pound season ticket holders as tarnishing the history and traditional passion of the fanbase.<ref>[http://www.chatsports.com/cleveland-browns/a/How-I-was-ejected-for-standing-in-the-Dawg-Pound-10-27-293 \"New Pound\" complaints - Chat Sports.com]</ref>\n\n===\"Bottlegate\"===\nIn a crucial late-season 2001 game against the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], the Browns were driving toward the east end zone for what would have been the winning score. A controversial call on fourth down gave the Jaguars the ball. Browns' receiver [[Quincy Morgan]] had caught a pass for a first down on 4th and 1.  After [[Tim Couch]] spiked the ball on the next play, referee [[Terry McAulay]] reviewed Morgan's catch, claiming that the replay officials had buzzed him before Couch spiked the ball. (NFL Rules state that once the next play is completed, the officials cannot under any circumstances review any previous plays.) Upon reviewing the play, McAulay determined that Morgan never had control of the ball, thus the pass was incomplete, and the Jaguars were awarded the ball. Fans in the Dawg Pound began throwing plastic [[beer bottle]]s (a recently introduced concept from the team's beer sponsor, [[Miller Lite]]) and other objects on the players and officials. McAulay declared the game over and sent the teams to the locker rooms. NFL Commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] then called to override the referee's decision, sending the players back onto the field, where the Jaguars ran out the last seconds under a hail of debris.  The incident then would become known as \"Bottlegate\",<ref>[http://nesn.com/2014/01/bottlegate-referee-terry-mcauley-to-lead-super-bowl-xlviii-officiating-crew \"Bottlegate\" referee to officiate Super Bowl - NESN.com]</ref> and resulted in the immediate ban of plastic beer bottles from future Browns home games.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cleveland19.com/story/890359/browns-ban-plastic-bottles-of-beer|title=Browns Ban Plastic Bottles Of Beer|last=Withers|first=Tom|date=2 August 2002|publisher=[[WOIO]] via [[The Associated Press]]|accessdate=18 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n===\"GPODAWUND\"===\nIn October 2016, a group of Browns fans accidentally swapped two parts of a large three-part banner, causing it to read \"This is the GPODAWUND.\"  <ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ftw/2016/10/30/this-botched-gpodawund-banner-perfectly-encapsulates-the-2016-browns/93017812/ GPODAWUND?

Since construction of the new stadium, the Dawg Pound is populated by more affluent attendees compared to the generally [[blue collar]] fan base that made the Municipal Stadium's Dawg Pound famous. Baseball Hall-of-Famer [[Hank Aaron]] often attended Browns games at Municipal Stadium and would sit in the Dawg Pound among the fans, albeit incognito.<ref>Garner, Joe. ''And The Crowd Goes Wild: Relive the Most Celebrated Sporting Events Ever Broadcast''. Foreword written by Aaron. Sourcebooks, 1998.</ref>\n\nOne of the more famous Dawg Pound season-ticket holders is [[John Big Dawg Thompson]] (he had a legal [[name change]] to include his nickname), known as the \"Canine-in-Chief.\"  Television cameras often showed the offensive-lineman-sized man in his dog mask and No. 98 jersey, although recently he has undergone [[gastric bypass]] surgery and lost considerable weight. In 1995, Thompson became an unofficial spokesman for Browns fans fighting the move of the team to Baltimore. He testified before the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]] and appeared on ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' with [[Bill Maher]].<ref>[http://www.southcoasttoday.com/daily/02-96/02-07-96/8nfl.htm New NFL math hard to figure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310130307/http://www.southcoasttoday.com/daily/02-96/02-07-96/8nfl.htm |date=2007-03-10 }}.
