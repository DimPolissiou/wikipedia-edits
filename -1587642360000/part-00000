The book became the inspiration for a genre of books known today as [[armchair treasure hunt]]s.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-47671776 |title=Masquerade: How a real-life treasure hunt obsessed a nation |author=Mark Shields |website=[[BBC]] |date=6 April 2019 |publisher= |accessdate=10 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\nIn March 1982 Williams received a sketch which he considered a good enough solution to the puzzle. The golden hare was located by a \"Ken Thomas\" (a pseudonym of Dugald Thompson) who knew John Guard whose then girlfriend, Veronica Robertson, had once lived with Williams. It later transpired that they had not fully solved the puzzle but used her knowledge that the hare was buried somewhere in [[Ampthill]] which led to a minor scandal. Two British physics teachers were later acknowledged to have correctly solved the puzzle.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/8448139/Masquerade-a-treasure-hunt-that-ended-in-a-scandal.html |title=Masquerade: a treasure hunt that ended in a scandal |author=Matt Warman |website=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=13 April 2011 |publisher= |accessdate=10 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Book==\nChallenged by [[Tom Maschler]], of the British [[publishing]] firm [[Jonathan Cape]], to \"do something no one has ever done before\" with a picture book, Williams set out in the 1970s to create a book of paintings that readers would study carefully rather than flip through and discard. The book's objective, the hunt for a valuable treasure, became his means to this end. ''Masquerade'' features fifteen detailed paintings illustrating the story of a [[hare]] named Jack Hare, who seeks to carry a treasure from the [[Moon]] (depicted as a woman) to her love object, the [[Sun]] (a man). On reaching the Sun, Jack finds that he has lost the treasure, and the reader is left to discover its location.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\nAlong with creating the book, Williams crafted a hare from 18-[[Carat (purity)|carat]] (75%) [[gold]] and jewels, in the form of a large [[filigree]] [[pendant]] on a segmented [[chain]]. He sealed the hare inside a [[ceramic]], hare-shaped [[casket]] (both to protect the prize from the [[soil]], and to foil attempts to locate the treasure with a [[metal detector]]).<ref name=\"BBC\"/> The casket was inscribed with the legend \"I am the keeper of the jewel of Masquerade, which lies waiting safe inside me for you or eternity\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Reckless hunt the necklace|first=Ross|last=Davies|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=31 July 1981|page=19}}</ref>\n\nKit Williams later said:\n<blockquote>If I was to spend two years on the 16 paintings for ''Masquerade'' I wanted them to mean something. I recalled how, as a child, I had come across \"treasure hunts\" in which the puzzles were not exciting nor the treasure worth finding. So I decided to make a real treasure, of gold, bury it in the ground and paint real puzzles to lead people to it. The key was to be [[Catherine of Aragon]]'s Cross at [[Ampthill]], near [[Bedford]], casting a shadow like the pointer of a [[sundial]].</blockquote>\n\nOn 7 August 1979, Williams and celebrity witness [[Bamber Gascoigne]] secretly buried the hare's casket at [[Ampthill Park]]. Williams announced publicly that his forthcoming book contained all clues necessary to decode the treasure's precise location in Britain to \"within a few inches.\" At the time, the only additional clue he provided was that the hare was buried on public property that could be easily accessed. To ensure that readers from further afield had an equal chance of winning, Williams also announced that he would confirm the first precisely correct answer sent to him by post.\n\nA modified version of the book also appeared in Italian, with a treasure buried in Italy.<ref name=Quest_10/> It was reinvented and translated by Joan Arnold and Lilli Denon with the name ''Il tesoro di Masquerade'' (Emme Edizioni).\n\n==Search==\nThe book sold hundreds of thousands of copies worldwide, many in the United Kingdom, but also in Australia, [[South Africa]], [[West Germany]], [[Japan]] (where the book was called \u4eee\u9762\u821e\u8e0f\u4f1a ''kamenbutoukai'', meaning a masquerade ball or masked ball), France and the United States. Searchers often dug up public and private property acting on hunches. One location in England named \"[[Haresfield Beacon]]\" was a popular site for searchers, and Williams paid the cost of a sign notifying searchers that the hare was not hidden on the premises. Real-life locations reproduced in the paintings were searched by treasure hunters, including [[Sudbury Hall]] in [[Derbyshire]] and [[Tewkesbury]], [[Gloucestershire]].\n\nIn March 1982, Kit Williams received a sketch which he recognised as the first correct solution mailed to him. Williams immediately phoned the sender, \"Ken Thomas\", a pseudonym of Dugald Thompson, and instructed him to dig for the hare. He realised that Thompson had not solved the puzzle in the intended manner, but appeared at the time to have blundered into a lucky guess. Shortly after Thompson was formally awarded the prize, Williams received a correct solution sent by two [[physics]] teachers, Mike Barker of [[William Hulme's Grammar School]] and John Rousseau of [[Rossall School]]. Barker and Rousseau had seemingly unearthed the prize themselves when digging at Ampthill, but had not noticed it inside its clay box; Thompson discovered it in the dirt piles they left behind.<ref name=scam/>\n\n[[Bamber Gascoigne]], having been asked by Williams to witness the burial of the hare and to document the contest from beginning to end, did so in his book ''Quest for the Golden Hare''. Gascoigne summarised his experiences thus:\n\n<blockquote>Tens of thousands of letters from Masqueraders have convinced me that the human mind has an equal capacity for pattern-matching and self-deception. While some addicts were busy cooking the riddle, others were more single-mindedly continuing their own pursuit of the hare quite regardless of the news that it had been found. Their own theories had come to seem so convincing that no exterior evidence could refute them. These most determined of Masqueraders may grudgingly have accepted that a hare of some sort was dug up at Ampthill, but they believed there would be another hare, or a better solution, awaiting them at their favourite spot.  Kit would expect them to continue undismayed by the much publicised diversion at Ampthill and would be looking forward to the day when he would greet them as the real discoverers of the real puzzle of ''Masquerade''. Optimistic expeditions were still setting out, with shovels and maps, throughout the summer of 1982.<ref name=Quest_10/></blockquote>\n\n==Solution==\n[[File:Masquerade_-_Isaac_Newton_painting_(Kit_Williams,_1979).jpg|thumb|right|\"Isaac Newton\" painting. Newton's eyes and digits, and those of the mouse in his sleeve, point to letters of the word \"H-O-U-R\". Newton's rings and puppets also give the sequence for digits and animals throughout the book.]]\n\n''Masquerade'''s puzzle is elaborate. The answer is hidden in the 15 painted illustrations. In each painting, a line must be drawn from each depicted creature's left eye through the longest digit on its left hand, and out to one of the letters in the page border. Then from the left eye through the longest digit on the left foot; the right eye through the longest digit on the right hand; and finally the right eye through the longest digit on the right foot. This is only done for eyes and digits that are visible in the painting. The letters indicated by these lines can be made to form words, either by treating them as anagrams or by applying the sequence of animals and digits suggested by the [[Isaac Newton]] painting (pictured).<ref name=\"BBC\"/> Following this method reveals fifteen words or short phrases, which together form a nineteen-word message:\n\n<blockquote>'''C'''ATHERINE'S '''L'''ONG FINGER '''O'''VER '''S'''HADOWS '''E'''ARTH '''B'''URIED '''Y'''ELLOW '''A'''MULET '''M'''IDDAY '''P'''OINTS '''T'''HE '''H'''OUR '''I'''N '''L'''IGHT OF EQUINOX '''L'''OOK YOU</blockquote>\n\nThe [[acrostic]] of these words and phrases reads \"CLOSEBYAMPTHILL\". Properly interpreted, the message tells the reader that the treasure is buried near the cross-shaped monument to [[Catherine of Aragon]] in [[Ampthill Park]], at the precise spot touched by the tip of the monument's shadow at noon on the day of either the [[vernal equinox|vernal]] or [[autumnal equinox]].<ref name=Coords/>\n\nMany additional hints and \"confirmers\" are scattered throughout the book. For example, in the painting depicting the Sun and the Moon dancing around the Earth, the hands of the two figures are clasped together, pointing at the date of the spring equinox.<ref name=Quest_appendix/>\n\n===''Sunday Times'' clue===\nOn December 21, 1980 the Sunday Times published an additional clue created by Kit Williams to the puzzle. This drawing needed to be cut out, folded in half and then with a light shone through a message could be read in a mirror. The message read \"To do my work, I appointed four men from twenty, the tallest and the fattest, and the righteous follow the sinister.\"\n\nThe \"...four men from twenty\" refers to four fingers and toes out of twenty digits; \"...the tallest and the fattest\" relates to using the longest digits; \"..the righteous follow the sinister\" provides a clue to the decoding of the letter order (left (sinister) eyes through left finger and toe first, then the righteous (right) ones). The clue featured a self portrait of Kit Williams surrounded by fourteen animals, the first letter of each making \"Merry Christmas\".\n\n==Scandal==\nOn 11 December 1988, ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' printed a story accusing the winner of the ''Masquerade'' contest of being a fraud. \"Ken Thomas\" was revealed as a pseudonym of Dugald Thompson, and Thompson's business partner, John Guard, was the boyfriend of Veronica Robertson, a former live-in girlfriend of Kit Williams. Guard had allegedly convinced Robertson to help him because both were said to be [[animal rights activists]] and Guard promised to donate any profits to the animal rights cause.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\n''The Sunday Times'' alleged that while living with Williams, Robertson had learned the approximate physical location of the hare, while remaining ignorant of the proper solution to the book's master riddle. After supposedly finding out from Robertson that the hare was in [[Ampthill]], Guard and two assistants were said to have started searching for it using [[metal detector]]s. After searching for some time with no success, they drew a crude sketch of the location, which Thompson then submitted to Williams as \"Thomas\", and it was this that Williams acknowledged as the first correct answer.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\nWilliams was shocked to discover the scandal and said: \"This tarnishes ''Masquerade'' and I'm shocked by what has emerged.  I feel a deep sense of responsibility to all those many people who were genuinely looking for it. Although I didn't know it, it was a skeleton in my cupboard and I'm relieved it has come out.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Golden hare should be put on display, says treasure hunt author Kit Williams|date=17 July 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/5848860/Golden-hare-should-be-put-on-display-says-treasure-hunt-author-Kit-Williams.html|accessdate=1 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nDugald Thompson founded a software company called Haresoft, and offered the jewel as a prize to a new contest which took the form of a computer game, ''[[Hareraiser]]''. The company and its game (which many believe to be unsolvable with only meaningless text and graphics), were unsuccessful, yielding no winner. When the company went into liquidation in 1988, the hare was sold at [[Sotheby's|Sotheby's London]] on behalf of the liquidators, [[KPMG|Peat Marwick]], in December 1988. The hare sold for \u00a331,900 to an anonymous buyer. Williams himself went there to bid, but dropped out at \u00a36,000.<ref>{{cite news|last=Checkland|first=Sarah Jane|title=Masquerade Hare fetches \u00a331,900|date=6 December 1988|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|page=5}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC\" />\n\nThe treasure's whereabouts remained unknown for over 20 years, until it came to light in 2009. The [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''The Grand Masquerade'', broadcast 14 July 2009, told the story of the creation and solution of the puzzle.<ref name=BBC_1/> Williams was interviewed and presenter [[John O'Farrell (author)|John O'Farrell]] claimed that this was the first time Williams had talked about the scandal for 20 years. During the interview Williams expressed the desire to see the hare again. Hearing this, the granddaughter of its then current owner\u2014an anonymous purchaser \"based in the Far East\"\u2014arranged for Williams to be reunited briefly with his work.<ref name=\"BBC\"/> This was featured in a television documentary, ''The Man Behind the Masquerade'', which aired on [[BBC Four]] on 2 December 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=Final chapter in tale of the golden hare and its creator\u2014who would rather be a tortoise|first=Ben|last=Hoyle|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=21 August 2009|page=4}}</ref><ref name=BBC_2/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/aug/20/kit-williams-golden-hare-masquerade |title=Unearthed again \u2013 golden hare that obsessed a nation |author=John Plunkett |website=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 August 2009 |publisher= |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe hare was on display at the [[V&A Museum]], London, as part of its \"British Design 1948\u20132012\" [[retrospective]] in 2012.<ref name=VA/>\n\n''Masquerade'' became the forerunner of an entire genre of cryptic puzzles known as [[armchair treasure hunt|armchair treasure hunts]]. It spawned a succession of books and games from other publishers seeking to emulate its success, including ''The Key To The Kingdom'' (Pavilion Books, 1982), ''The Piper Of Dreams'' (Hodder & Stoughton, 1982), ''The Secret'' (Bantam Books, 1982), ''The Golden Key'' (William Maclellan, 1982), ''[[Treasure: In Search of the Golden Horse]]'' (Intravision, 1984), ''[[The Merlin Mystery]]'' (Warner Books, 1998) and the French ''[[On the Trail of the Golden Owl]]'' (Manya, 1993), which is still unsolved. Forrest Fenn took this idea to the Rocky Mountains and dared to conquer the \"armchair\" genre with his treasure hunt ''[[The Thrill of the Chase: a Memoir]]'' (One Horse Land & Cattle Co., 2010).  Kit Williams himself also created a second treasure-hunt book, ''[[The Bee on the Comb]]'' (1984).\n\nSimilar hunts have continued being published in various formats.

The book became the inspiration for a genre of books known today as [[armchair treasure hunt]]s.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-47671776 |title=Masquerade: How a real-life treasure hunt obsessed a nation |author=Mark Shields |website=[[BBC]] |date=6 April 2019 |publisher= |accessdate=10 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\nIn March 1982 Williams received a sketch which he considered a good enough solution to the puzzle. The golden hare was located by a \"Ken Thomas\" (a pseudonym of Dugald Thompson) who knew John Guard whose then girlfriend, Veronica Robertson, had once lived with Williams. It later transpired that they had not fully solved the puzzle but used her knowledge that the hare was buried somewhere in [[Ampthill]] which led to a minor scandal. Two British physics teachers were later acknowledged to have correctly solved the puzzle.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/8448139/Masquerade-a-treasure-hunt-that-ended-in-a-scandal.html |title=Masquerade: a treasure hunt that ended in a scandal |author=Matt Warman |website=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=13 April 2011 |publisher= |accessdate=10 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Book==\nChallenged by [[Tom Maschler]], of the British [[publishing]] firm [[Jonathan Cape]], to \"do something no one has ever done before\" with a picture book, Williams set out in the 1970s to create a book of paintings that readers would study carefully rather than flip through and discard. The book's objective, the hunt for a valuable treasure, became his means to this end. ''Masquerade'' features fifteen detailed paintings illustrating the story of a [[hare]] named Jack Hare, who seeks to carry a treasure from the [[Moon]] (depicted as a woman) to her love object, the [[Sun]] (a man). On reaching the Sun, Jack finds that he has lost the treasure, and the reader is left to discover its location.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\nAlong with creating the book, Williams crafted a hare from 18-[[Carat (purity)|carat]] (75%) [[gold]] and jewels, in the form of a large [[filigree]] [[pendant]] on a segmented [[chain]]. He sealed the hare inside a [[ceramic]], hare-shaped [[casket]] (both to protect the prize from the [[soil]], and to foil attempts to locate the treasure with a [[metal detector]]).<ref name=\"BBC\"/> The casket was inscribed with the legend \"I am the keeper of the jewel of Masquerade, which lies waiting safe inside me for you or eternity\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Reckless hunt the necklace|first=Ross|last=Davies|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=31 July 1981|page=19}}</ref>\n\nKit Williams later said:\n<blockquote>If I was to spend two years on the 16 paintings for ''Masquerade'' I wanted them to mean something. I recalled how, as a child, I had come across \"treasure hunts\" in which the puzzles were not exciting nor the treasure worth finding. So I decided to make a real treasure, of gold, bury it in the ground and paint real puzzles to lead people to it. The key was to be [[Catherine of Aragon]]'s Cross at [[Ampthill]], near [[Bedford]], casting a shadow like the pointer of a [[sundial]].</blockquote>\n\nOn 7 August 1979, Williams and celebrity witness [[Bamber Gascoigne]] secretly buried the hare's casket at [[Ampthill Park]]. Williams announced publicly that his forthcoming book contained all clues necessary to decode the treasure's precise location in Britain to \"within a few inches.\" At the time, the only additional clue he provided was that the hare was buried on public property that could be easily accessed. To ensure that readers from further afield had an equal chance of winning, Williams also announced that he would confirm the first precisely correct answer sent to him by post.\n\nA modified version of the book also appeared in Italian, with a treasure buried in Italy.<ref name=Quest_10/> It was reinvented and translated by Joan Arnold and Lilli Denon with the name ''Il tesoro di Masquerade'' (Emme Edizioni).\n\n==Search==\nThe book sold hundreds of thousands of copies worldwide, many in the United Kingdom, but also in Australia, [[South Africa]], [[West Germany]], [[Japan]] (where the book was called \u4eee\u9762\u821e\u8e0f\u4f1a ''kamenbutoukai'', meaning a masquerade ball or masked ball), France and the United States. Searchers often dug up public and private property acting on hunches. One location in England named \"[[Haresfield Beacon]]\" was a popular site for searchers, and Williams paid the cost of a sign notifying searchers that the hare was not hidden on the premises. Real-life locations reproduced in the paintings were searched by treasure hunters, including [[Sudbury Hall]] in [[Derbyshire]] and [[Tewkesbury]], [[Gloucestershire]].\n\nIn March 1982, Kit Williams received a sketch which he recognised as the first correct solution mailed to him. Williams immediately phoned the sender, \"Ken Thomas\", a pseudonym of Dugald Thompson, and instructed him to dig for the hare. He realised that Thompson had not solved the puzzle in the intended manner, but appeared at the time to have blundered into a lucky guess. Shortly after Thompson was formally awarded the prize, Williams received a correct solution sent by two [[physics]] teachers, Mike Barker of [[William Hulme's Grammar School]] and John Rousseau of [[Rossall School]]. Barker and Rousseau had seemingly unearthed the prize themselves when digging at Ampthill, but had not noticed it inside its clay box; Thompson discovered it in the dirt piles they left behind.<ref name=scam/>\n\n[[Bamber Gascoigne]], having been asked by Williams to witness the burial of the hare and to document the contest from beginning to end, did so in his book ''Quest for the Golden Hare''. Gascoigne summarised his experiences thus:\n\n<blockquote>Tens of thousands of letters from Masqueraders have convinced me that the human mind has an equal capacity for pattern-matching and self-deception. While some addicts were busy cooking the riddle, others were more single-mindedly continuing their own pursuit of the hare quite regardless of the news that it had been found. Their own theories had come to seem so convincing that no exterior evidence could refute them. These most determined of Masqueraders may grudgingly have accepted that a hare of some sort was dug up at Ampthill, but they believed there would be another hare, or a better solution, awaiting them at their favourite spot.  Kit would expect them to continue undismayed by the much publicised diversion at Ampthill and would be looking forward to the day when he would greet them as the real discoverers of the real puzzle of ''Masquerade''. Optimistic expeditions were still setting out, with shovels and maps, throughout the summer of 1982.<ref name=Quest_10/></blockquote>\n\n==Solution==\n[[File:Masquerade_-_Isaac_Newton_painting_(Kit_Williams,_1979).jpg|thumb|right|\"Isaac Newton\" painting. Newton's eyes and digits, and those of the mouse in his sleeve, point to letters of the word \"H-O-U-R\". Newton's rings and puppets also give the sequence for digits and animals throughout the book.]]\n\n''Masquerade'''s puzzle is elaborate. The answer is hidden in the 15 painted illustrations. In each painting, a line must be drawn from each depicted creature's left eye through the longest digit on its left hand, and out to one of the letters in the page border. Then from the left eye through the longest digit on the left foot; the right eye through the longest digit on the right hand; and finally the right eye through the longest digit on the right foot. This is only done for eyes and digits that are visible in the painting. The letters indicated by these lines can be made to form words, either by treating them as anagrams or by applying the sequence of animals and digits suggested by the [[Isaac Newton]] painting (pictured).<ref name=\"BBC\"/> Following this method reveals fifteen words or short phrases, which together form a nineteen-word message:\n\n<blockquote>'''C'''ATHERINE'S '''L'''ONG FINGER '''O'''VER '''S'''HADOWS '''E'''ARTH '''B'''URIED '''Y'''ELLOW '''A'''MULET '''M'''IDDAY '''P'''OINTS '''T'''HE '''H'''OUR '''I'''N '''L'''IGHT OF EQUINOX '''L'''OOK YOU</blockquote>\n\nThe [[acrostic]] of these words and phrases reads \"CLOSEBYAMPTHILL\". Properly interpreted, the message tells the reader that the treasure is buried near the cross-shaped monument to [[Catherine of Aragon]] in [[Ampthill Park]], at the precise spot touched by the tip of the monument's shadow at noon on the day of either the [[vernal equinox|vernal]] or [[autumnal equinox]].<ref name=Coords/>\n\nMany additional hints and \"confirmers\" are scattered throughout the book. For example, in the painting depicting the Sun and the Moon dancing around the Earth, the hands of the two figures are clasped together, pointing at the date of the spring equinox.<ref name=Quest_appendix/>\n\n===''Sunday Times'' clue===\nOn December 21, 1980 the Sunday Times published an additional clue created by Kit Williams to the puzzle. This drawing needed to be cut out, folded in half and then with a light shone through a message could be read in a mirror. The message read \"To do my work, I appointed four men from twenty, the tallest and the fattest, and the righteous follow the sinister.\"\n\nThe \"...four men from twenty\" refers to four fingers and toes out of twenty digits; \"...the tallest and the fattest\" relates to using the longest digits; \"..the righteous follow the sinister\" provides a clue to the decoding of the letter order (left (sinister) eyes through left finger and toe first, then the righteous (right) ones). The clue featured a self portrait of Kit Williams surrounded by fourteen animals, the first letter of each making \"Merry Christmas\".\n\n==Scandal==\nOn 11 December 1988, ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' printed a story accusing the winner of the ''Masquerade'' contest of being a fraud. \"Ken Thomas\" was revealed as a pseudonym of Dugald Thompson, and Thompson's business partner, John Guard, was the boyfriend of Veronica Robertson, a former live-in girlfriend of Kit Williams. Guard had allegedly convinced Robertson to help him because both were said to be [[animal rights activists]] and Guard promised to donate any profits to the animal rights cause.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\n''The Sunday Times'' alleged that while living with Williams, Robertson had learned the approximate physical location of the hare, while remaining ignorant of the proper solution to the book's master riddle. After supposedly finding out from Robertson that the hare was in [[Ampthill]], Guard and two assistants were said to have started searching for it using [[metal detector]]s. After searching for some time with no success, they drew a crude sketch of the location, which Thompson then submitted to Williams as \"Thomas\", and it was this that Williams acknowledged as the first correct answer.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\nWilliams was shocked to discover the scandal and said: \"This tarnishes ''Masquerade'' and I'm shocked by what has emerged.  I feel a deep sense of responsibility to all those many people who were genuinely looking for it. Although I didn't know it, it was a skeleton in my cupboard and I'm relieved it has come out.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Golden hare should be put on display, says treasure hunt author Kit Williams|date=17 July 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/5848860/Golden-hare-should-be-put-on-display-says-treasure-hunt-author-Kit-Williams.html|accessdate=1 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nDugald Thompson founded a software company called Haresoft, and offered the jewel as a prize to a new contest which took the form of a computer game, ''[[Hareraiser]]''. The company and its game (which many believe to be unsolvable with only meaningless text and graphics), were unsuccessful, yielding no winner. When the company went into liquidation in 1988, the hare was sold at [[Sotheby's|Sotheby's London]] on behalf of the liquidators, [[KPMG|Peat Marwick]], in December 1988. The hare sold for \u00a331,900 to an anonymous buyer. Williams himself went there to bid, but dropped out at \u00a36,000.<ref>{{cite news|last=Checkland|first=Sarah Jane|title=Masquerade Hare fetches \u00a331,900|date=6 December 1988|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|page=5}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC\" />\n\nThe treasure's whereabouts remained unknown for over 20 years, until it came to light in 2009. The [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''The Grand Masquerade'', broadcast 14 July 2009, told the story of the creation and solution of the puzzle.<ref name=BBC_1/> Williams was interviewed and presenter [[John O'Farrell (author)|John O'Farrell]] claimed that this was the first time Williams had talked about the scandal for 20 years. During the interview Williams expressed the desire to see the hare again. Hearing this, the granddaughter of its then current owner\u2014an anonymous purchaser \"based in the Far East\"\u2014arranged for Williams to be reunited briefly with his work.<ref name=\"BBC\"/> This was featured in a television documentary, ''The Man Behind the Masquerade'', which aired on [[BBC Four]] on 2 December 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=Final chapter in tale of the golden hare and its creator\u2014who would rather be a tortoise|first=Ben|last=Hoyle|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=21 August 2009|page=4}}</ref><ref name=BBC_2/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/aug/20/kit-williams-golden-hare-masquerade |title=Unearthed again \u2013 golden hare that obsessed a nation |author=John Plunkett |website=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 August 2009 |publisher= |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe hare was on display at the [[V&A Museum]], London, as part of its \"British Design 1948\u20132012\" [[retrospective]] in 2012.<ref name=VA/>\n\n''Masquerade'' became the forerunner of an entire genre of cryptic puzzles known as [[armchair treasure hunt|armchair treasure hunts]]. It spawned a succession of books and games from other publishers seeking to emulate its success, including ''The Key To The Kingdom'' (Pavilion Books, 1982), ''The Piper Of Dreams'' (Hodder & Stoughton, 1982), ''The Secret'' (Bantam Books, 1982), ''The Golden Key'' (William Maclellan, 1982), ''[[Treasure: In Search of the Golden Horse]]'' (Intravision, 1984), ''[[The Merlin Mystery]]'' (Warner Books, 1998) and the French ''[[On the Trail of the Golden Owl]]'' (Manya, 1993), which is still unsolved. Forrest Fenn took this idea to the Rocky Mountains and dared to conquer the \"armchair\" genre with his treasure hunt ''[[The Thrill of the Chase: a Memoir]]'' (One Horse Land & Cattle Co., 2010).  Kit Williams himself also created a second treasure-hunt book, ''[[The Bee on the Comb]]'' (1984).\n\nSimilar hunts have continued being published in various formats. ''Alkemstone'' (Level-10, 1981), a computer game developed during the height of the Masquerade hype, is still unsolved. Many later hunts make use of technologies that were unavailable when ''Masquerade'' was published, such as the web-based homage ''Menagerie'', the CD-ROM based [[Treasure Quest (game)|Treasure Quest]],<ref name=\"Fehr1996\">{{cite news |last=Fehr-Snyder |first=Kerry |title=Scottsdale software chief bets a million on game |date=10 April 1996 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/123682761 |editor-last=Johnson |editor-first=Pam |newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] |volume=106 |issue=332 |edition=Final |location=[[Phoenix, Arizona]] |pages=E1-E2 |issn=0892-8711 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> and ''Text4Treasure'', which uses [[SMS]] messaging.

County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]], along Darby Creek {{convert|5|mi|km}} southwest of [[Center City, Philadelphia]]. Darby Borough is distinct from the nearby municipality of [[Darby Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Darby Township]].\n\n==History==\nDarby was settled in 1682 by seven [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] families led by abolitionist & fair trade avocate John Blunston. The name Darby is derived from the [[England|English]] city of [[Derby]] (pronounced ''\"Darby\"''), the [[county town]] of [[Derbyshire]] (pronounced ''\"Darbyshire\"''), the origin of many early settlers.{{sfn|Gannett|1905|p=100}} Incorporated on May 3, 1853,{{sfn|Ashmeade|Hungerford|1884|p=516}} it had 3,429 residents in 1900, 6,305 in 1910, 10,334 in 1940, and 10,687 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].\n\nDarby is home to the fifth-oldest all-volunteer Fire Department and the [[Darby Free Library]], one of the oldest libraries in the United States, founded in 1743. One of its cemeteries is more than 300 years old.\n\nViolent racial incidents hit all over the country as part of the [[Red Summer|1919 Red Summer]]. The [[Darby 1919 lynching attempt]] was the attempted [[lynching]] of Samuel Gorman of Darby on July 23, 1919. Samuel Gorman, a 17-year-old black boy, was sent to jail for the alleged murder of William E. Taylor.\n\n==Geography==\nDarby has a total area of {{convert|0.8|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.

County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]], along Darby Creek {{convert|5|mi|km}} southwest of [[Center City, Philadelphia]]. Darby Borough is distinct from the nearby municipality of [[Darby Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Darby Township]].\n\n==History==\nDarby was settled in 1682 by seven [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] families led by abolitionist & fair trade avocate John Blunston. The name Darby is derived from the [[England|English]] city of [[Derby]] (pronounced ''\"Darby\"''), the [[county town]] of [[Derbyshire]] (pronounced ''\"Darbyshire\"''), the origin of many early settlers.{{sfn|Gannett|1905|p=100}} Incorporated on May 3, 1853,{{sfn|Ashmeade|Hungerford|1884|p=516}} it had 3,429 residents in 1900, 6,305 in 1910, 10,334 in 1940, and 10,687 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].\n\nDarby is home to the fifth-oldest all-volunteer Fire Department and the [[Darby Free Library]], one of the oldest libraries in the United States, founded in 1743. One of its cemeteries is more than 300 years old.\n\n20th Century:\nViolent racial incidents hit all over the country as part of the [[Red Summer|1919 Red Summer]]. The [[Darby 1919 lynching attempt]] was the attempted [[lynching]] of Samuel Gorman of Darby on July 23, 1919. Samuel Gorman, a 17-year-old black boy, was sent to jail for the alleged murder of William E. Taylor.\n\n==Geography==\nDarby has a total area of {{convert|0.8|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land. It has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') and average monthly temperatures range from 33.6&nbsp;\u00b0F in January to 78.3&nbsp;\u00b0F in July.

It was named after the [[Taymyr Peninsula]].\n\n''Taymyr'' and her sister ship ''[[Icebreaker Vaygach|Vaygach]]'' were built for the purpose of thoroughly exploring the uncharted areas of the [[Northern Sea Route]]. This venture became known as the [[Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition]].\n\n==Surveys==\nThe first of a series of surveys began in the autumn of 1910, when ''Taymyr'' and ''Vaygach'' left [[Vladivostok]]. They entered the [[Chukchi Sea]] with scientists on board and began their exploration. For the next five years, these icebreakers went on sounding and carrying on vital surveys during the thaw. Before every winter, when ice conditions became too bad, they returned to Vladivostok and waited for the spring. In 1911 the scientists and crew aboard ''Vaygach'' and ''Taymyr'' made the first Russian landing on [[Wrangel Island]].\n\nIn 1914, [[Boris Vilkitsky]] was both the captain of ''Taymyr'' and the leader of the Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition. The purpose of the icebreakers ''Taymyr'' and ''Vaygach'' was to force the whole Northern Passage in order to reach [[Archangelsk]]. Severe weather and ice conditions, however, didn't allow them to cross the [[Kara Sea]] and they were forced to winter at [[Bukhta Dika]], close to the [[Firnley Islands]]. Thus the sister icebreakers were able to complete the passage only in 1915. They were warmly welcomed in Archangelsk upon their arrival.\n\nSome of the biggest successes of the expedition were the accurate charting of the Northern Sea Route and the discovery of [[Severnaya Zemlya]] in 1913.

It was named after the [[Taymyr Peninsula]].\n\n''Taymyr'' and her sister ship ''[[Icebreaker Vaygach|Vaygach]]'' were built for the purpose of thoroughly exploring the uncharted areas of the [[Northern Sea Route]]. This venture became known as the [[Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition]].\n\n==Surveys==\nThe first of a series of surveys began in the autumn of 1910, when ''Taymyr'' and ''Vaygach'' left [[Vladivostok]]. They entered the [[Chukchi Sea]] with scientists on board and began their exploration. For the next five years, these icebreakers went on sounding and carrying on vital surveys during the thaw. Before every winter, when ice conditions became too bad, they returned to Vladivostok and waited for the spring. In 1911 the scientists and crew aboard ''Vaygach'' and ''Taymyr'' made the first Russian landing on [[Wrangel Island]].\n\nIn 1914, [[Boris Vilkitsky]] was both the captain of ''Taymyr'' and the leader of the Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition. The purpose of the icebreakers ''Taymyr'' and ''Vaygach'' was to force the whole Northern Passage in order to reach [[Archangelsk]]. Severe weather and ice conditions, however, didn't allow them to cross the [[Kara Sea]] and they were forced to winter at [[Bukhta Dika]], close to the [[Firnley Islands]]. Thus the sister icebreakers were able to complete the passage only in 1915. They were warmly welcomed in Archangelsk upon their arrival.\n\nSome of the biggest successes of the expedition were the accurate charting of the Northern Sea Route and the discovery of [[Severnaya Zemlya]] in 1913. ''Taymyr'' and ''Vaygach'' were considered the best icebreakers in the world at the time.{{by whom|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe first scientific [[Soviet and Russian manned drifting ice stations|drifting ice station]] in the world, [[North Pole-1]] was established on 21 May 1937 some {{convert|20|km}} from the North Pole by the expedition into the high latitudes Sever-1, led by [[Otto Schmidt]].
