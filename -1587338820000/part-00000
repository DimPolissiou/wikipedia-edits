In Sudan, while the [[Abbala]] live in the semi-desert part of the region: northern [[Kordofan]] and [[Darfur]], the [[Baggara]], by contrast, live on their southern fringes; occupying the area roughly south of [[12th parallel north|12 degrees north]] and extending well into flood basins of the White Nile to the south.\n\nIn general the Dar Al Messiria or their zones can be divided into three areas:<br> \n1.1.

The Messiria [[historians]] tell that, one of their grand parents named sheikh Abu Nafisa his burial is found far southern of present [[Abyei (town)|Abyei town]] and he had died around the early 1770s.

Being both [[nomads]], The Messiria and [[Dinka]] coexisted for long time and shared the grazing resources.  Those Messiria who have most contact with Ngok Dinka are the Messiria Humr.  The Messiria Zurug share most of their land with the [[Nuba]] tribes, along the western sides of  the national highway connecting Deling city to [[Kadugli]]; the capital city of South Kordofan and extending to [[Talodi]] city.

The 1139th Engineer Combat Group was part of the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] and was attached for operations to the [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] in direct support of the [[7th Armored Division (United States)|7th Armored Division]]. The 1139th Engineer Combat Group fought from northern France to Austria in World War II, supporting General [[George S. Patton|George Patton]]'s Third Army's rapid movements during the war.\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group is credited with opening routes for the advancement of troops which included building 119 tactical bridges, of which 39 were 200 feet or longer, including the 1,896 foot \"longest floating tactical bridge constructed in the European Theater of Operations.\" The Group was first formed in December 1943 and deactivated in December 1946.\n\n=History=\n\n==Development of the Engineer Combat Group Concept==\nStarting with WWII, the United States Army defined a Combat Group to be similar to a Regiment, the unit from which the Group was evolved.  In general, a Regiment is composed of a fixed number of Battalions whose personnel and equipment are likewise fixed. The Battalions have only the minimum administrative personnel, with the result that administrative details are handled by the Regimental Headquarters.  In warfare as mobile and on as vast a scale as the European campaign was, it was felt that the Regiment was not sufficiently agile for achieving maximum effectiveness; therefor, the Group was created to be more flexible; units could be attached or detached as the situations warranted.\n\nIn the specific case of the Engineer Combat Group, all units were separate entities; the Group would consist of an unspecified number of separate companies and battalions, which were attached to and detached from the Group Headquarters as the situations demanded. Thus, in the instance of the 1139th Engineer Combat Group, there were as many as five battalions and three separate companies under their command at one time, and at other times they functioned with as little as a single company. The job of the 1139th was twofold; primarily they were responsible for the administration of the units under their command; and secondarily they acted in a supervisory capacity for all work assigned to the Group.  In addition to the combat engineer battalions, the group could have attached separate battalions and companies that specialized in and carried equipment for constructing specific types of bridges such as Heavy and Light [[Pontoon bridge|Ponton Bridges]], Treadway and Bailey Bridges, or other specialized support functions such as Area Lighting or Smoke Generation. The group was designed as a flexible organization set up to efficiently meet rapidly changing tactical requirements.  The units under control of Group Headquarters were used to support the Division's Engineer Operations, providing special equipment which the division engineers did not carry, and augmenting the personnel strength of the division Engineer Battalions.<ref name=\"1139th Engineers\">{{cite book |title=1139th Engineer Combat Group Unit History; 1 July 1944 to 8 May 1945 |publisher=1139th Engineer Combat Group |page=4}}</ref>\n\nThe Engineer Combat Group had many duties; construction, repair and dismantling of various bridge types, clearing of obstacles, road repair and construction, ferrying troops in river crossings, and detecting, removing, and laying of mines and demolitions, in addition to offensive and defensive infantry functions.\n\n==1139th Engineer Combat Group Training and Deployment==\n[[File:Camp Ellis Eng Grp Train.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Engineer Group at Camp Ellis training on bridge building techniques, 1940]]\n\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group, 1944 - 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Engineer Combat Group, 1944 - 1945]]\n\nMany of the troops that would eventually make up the 1139th Engineer Combat Group received their initial training at [[Camp Ellis|Camp Ellis, Illinois]], the Army Services Training Center located southwest of Peoria, Illinois.  From there they were sent to [[Beale Air Force Base|Camp Beale, California]], an Army training camp.  Most were consigned to \"the duration plus six months\".  In addition to their basic training courses, they received courses in camouflage, mine field clearing, mapping, reconnaissance, bridge building, and road construction.<ref name=\"Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders\">{{cite book |last1=Fitzharris |first1=Joseph C |title=Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders: Company B, 1303rd Engineer General Service Regiment |date=2007 |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |location=College Station, Texas |isbn=978-1-58544-550-9 |page=186}}</ref> The 1139th was commanded by Colonel John S.

The next day they disembarked and traveled via a twelve-hour train trip to Doddington, [[Nantwich]], England, where they organized their men and supplies, and drew vehicles, trailers and other T/E equipment (equipment specified for their specific operations) as required.\n\nOn August 1, 1944, they traveled via truck convoy from Doddington to [[Bournemouth | Bournemouth, England]]; a large troop marshaling area in preparation of movement to Continental Europe.  On August 5, 1944, they left England sailing on the USAT George Custer and arrived on [[Utah Beach]] just two months after the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings]] there.  Over the next two days, the unit disembarked and bivouacked in the Utah Beach area.\n\n== The 1139th in the European Theater of Operations ==\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group troops bivouacked in France, August 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Engineer Combat Group troops bivouacked in France, August 1944]]\n\nOn August 8, 1944, they proceeded in motor convoy across the Cherbourg Peninsula moving north to Bricquebec, France, and at that point they began to work as an operational unit taking its position in the line of advance, with the [[First United States Army|First Army]] on its left flank and the [[XII Corps (United States)|XII Corps]] on the right flank.  The 1139th Engineer Combat Group was assigned to the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] and attached for operations to the [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] in direct support of the [[7th Armored Division (United States)|7th Armored Division]]. (When a unit is \"assigned\", it becomes a permanent part of the headquarters to which it is assigned. When the unit is \"attached\", it comes under the administrative and operational control of that unit to which it is attached.)\n\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group Troops.jpg|thumb|right|300px|1139th Engineer Combat Group Troops on the road]]\n\nIt was at that point that their Executive Officer, [[Walton Walker|Colonel Walton H. Walker]], outlined their responsibilities; as part of [[George S. Patton|General Patton's]] army the mission of the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was to travel directly behind the armor and remove mines, build bridges, fight as infantry and perform other engineering activities that allowed the rapid advancement of the XX Corps. (The XX Corps played a measurable role in [[Walton Walker|Patton's dash across France in August and early September 1944, earning the nickname \"Ghost Corps\" for the speed of its advance]]; starting in Bricquebec, France, they traveled 600 miles in their first 30 days).<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=12}}</ref>   The XX Corps armored divisions typically traveled many miles ahead of the main body of the army, which resulted in many enemy positions being overrun before alarm could be given.\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group arrived in the vicinity of Saint Jean sur Erve, France, on August 10, 1944, and was joined by their first battalions; the 135th, the 179th, and the 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.  The initial activity of the Group was to support the [[80th Division (United States)|80th Infantry Division]] in its thrust north against the enemy near Sainte-Suzanne, France.\n\nOn August 13, 1944, while en route during this advance, the Group removed landmines from roads and shoulders, and the first of the 1139th's bridges were constructed; two 60 foot [[Bailey bridge|Bailey Bridges]] built at St. Mars and St. George, France, on the sites of two bridges that had been blown up by the enemy.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, August 5-31, 1944 |page=2}}</ref>   (A Bailey Bridge is a temporary pre-fabricated, truss bridge, quickly assembled from prefabricated, standardized parts, assembled on land and then launched across an opening).<ref>{{cite book |title=Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders |page=189}}</ref>   Two days later they constructed two [[Ponton bridge|Treadway Bridges M2]] across the Huisne River at La Fert\u00e9-Bernard, and at Nogent-le-Rotrou, France.  (A Treadway Bridge is a floating bridge, using pontoons to support a continuous deck for pedestrian and vehicle travel).  In his European campaign, [[Dwight D.

They engaged in firefight operations by cleaning out machine-gun and anti-tank gun nests in Bonville, France, suffering 6 dead and 12 wounded.  They constructed two short Treadway bridges at Luce, France, west of Chartres and removed twelve large bombs from bridges in [[Chartres]].  By the next day they were joined by the 7th Armored Division, and the city was finally liberated.\n\nThe Group then moved north to the vicinity of Treon, France, in support of the 7th Armored Division.  There they were tasked with clearing the roads of mines, removing booby-trapped vehicles from roads, de-booby-trapping the Railroad station at Dreux, France, and filling in road craters in the routes of the advancement.  They continued to move rapidly forward, and the Seine River was reached on August 23, 1944, where they bivouacked in an open field near Melun, France.  At Sainte Sauveur, France, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported the 7th Armored Division in its initial crossing of the Seine River at Tilly, France by manning assault boats, by establishing a beachhead and constructing a 504-foot Treadway Bridge while under direct fire, and by constructing a 204-foot footbridge across the canal at Melun, France.  The construction of the foot-bridge was carried on under heavy small arms and 88mm fire.  An 88mm shell blew out 50 feet of the bridge during construction, which had to be replaced while under intense enemy fire.<ref name=\"HQp4\">{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, August 5-31, 1944 |page=4}}</ref>\n\nOver the next few days, the Seine was bridged in three more places by the 991st and the 994th Engineer Treadway Bridge Companies, the 537th Engineer Light Ponton Company, and the 135th, 179th, and 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.<ref name=\"1139Engp15\">{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=15}}</ref> These crossings consisted of multiple span continuous Bailey bridges, a 210-foot Bailey at Vulaines-sur-Seine, Frances, and a 420-foot Bailey at Champagne, France.  Most of the construction was carried out at night, and took place under enemy fire, resulting in several lives lost.  When the bridges were completed, they were guarded and maintained while under considerable fire.<ref name=\"HQp4\" />\n\nArriving at Montmiral, France on August 28, 1944, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group underwent a leadership change with Executive Officer Colonel Walker leaving to become the commanding officer of the 1103rd Engineer Combat Group, and Lt. Col Robert Eininger replacing him.\n\nThe next major objective of the Third Army was Verdun, France and the Moselle Valley, which offered a natural gap in Germany's frontier line.  Early in the morning of September 2, 1944, the XX Corps arrived 5 miles west of Verdun.  Within a matter of hours, the city fell to the armored division, and on September 4, 1944, the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company had built a 200-foot Baily bridge over the Meuse River and a bridgehead was established on the eastern side of the river. At this point, the Third Army's Armored Divisions had outpaced the [[Red Ball Express|Redball]] gasoline supply column, and although emergency supply convoys were rushed south, the Germans had time to reinforce their [[Fortifications of Metz|positions at Metz, Germany]].  The American bridgehead had to be withdrawn from across the Meuse. While awaiting gasoline reinforcements the 1139th Engineer Combat Group completed a considerable amount of repair on the railroads in the vicinity.  Repairs were made by filling in bomb craters in the yards east of Verdun, and by rehabilitation of the track and roadbed from Conflans to Verdun, France, including construction of a 280-foot single track bridge at Conflans.<ref name=\"Headquarters Unit History, September 1\u201330, 1944\">{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group; September 1-30, 1944 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=7}}</ref>\n\nOn September 15, 1944, when adequate supplies had finally reached the Third Army, they moved on toward Thiacourt, France. The 135th Engineer Combat Battalion working with the 180th Engineer Heavy Ponton Battalion constructed a 260-foot Heavy Ponton bridge at Pagny, France.  Because of a shortage of Engineer troops, it was necessary to form a provisional platoon from the Group Headquarters Company to assist in the construction.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, September 1-30, 1944 |page=8}}</ref>  Then working with the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company, they constructed two 80 foot Bailey bridges across the Moselle River.  The bridge building units worked under constant heavy mortar and artillery fire at these crossings, but were aided by the 161st Chemical Smoke Generating Company laying down a heavy smoke screen from hundreds of smoke generators and pots.  The cost in lives was high,<ref name=\"1139Engp15\" /> but it helped pave the way towards taking the heavily defended city of [[Metz]]. Despite the pressure of the continued rapid advance of the Group, morale among the troops remained at a high level.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, September 1-30, 1944 |page=9}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rapid bridge-launching vehicle.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rapid bridge-launching vehicle, designed by the 1139th Engineer Combat Group.]]\n\n[[File:730 foot Heavy Ponton Bridge built at Uckange, France, by 1139th Engineer Combat Group, Nov 17 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Heavy Ponton Bridge built across the Moselle River at Uckange, France, by 1139th Engineer Combat Group, November 17, 1944]]\n\nDuring the month of October 1944, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group grew to one of the largest tactical engineer groups in the United States Army.  Over 5000 troops were under their command, including the 5th, 83rd, 90th, and 95th Infantry Divisions, the 179th and 206th Engineer Combat Battalions, the 991st Engineer Treadway Company, the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company, and the 623rd Engineer Light Equipment Company.  This concentration of men and equipment was in preparation of supporting the crossing of the Moselle River by the 10th Armored Division and the 90th and 95th Infantry Divisions.  In preparation for this, the troops were instructed in crossing techniques using [[Assault boat|Assault Boats]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Infantry Assault Boat Training Program |date=October 31, 1944 |publisher=Unclassified / Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20136}}</ref> and the Group experimented with building a rapid bridge-launching-device constructed on a tank frame.

These crossings were unusually difficult because the Moselle River was in a state of 30-year flood, and the enemy was continually making the bridging difficult with heavy artillery, machine gun and small arms fire.  The enemy fire at Cattenom, France, was so intense that the 440 foot Floating Bailey Bridge was eventually lost.  In most of these crossings the engineers had to first resort to ferrying operations in order for the infantry to clear a beachhead on the eastern shore so that the bridges could be constructed.  Numerous troop losses occurred during these crossings.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, November 1-30, 1944 |pages=2\u20136}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bailey Bridge at Thionville, France.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Bailey Bridge built across the Moselle River at Thionville, France by the 1139th.]]\n\nAfter the successful crossing of the Moselle River by the 90th and 95th Infantry Divisions and the 10th Armored Division, studies of aerial photographs revealed the need for all the engineers in the Group to help overcome the obstacles left by the enemy; extensive antitank ditches, craters, pill boxes, blown bridges, and numerous mine fields (one minefield alone was estimated to contain 10,000 mines).<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, November 1-30, 1944 |page=7}}</ref>  The burden of this work was so great that the 135th Engineer Combat Battalion was reattached to the 1139th Engineer Combat Group for the purpose of taking over the work in the rear of the division, including filling craters and ditches, destroying pill boxes, constructing fords, marking minefields, posting road signs, changing town signs, and removing the dead to [[Mortuary Affairs|Graves Registration]].  Because of the large number of bridges under construction during November, it was also necessary to utilize the 88th Engineer Heavy Ponton Bridge Battalion to haul Bailey bridges from Army Supply Point No. 8 to Thionville, France, and to maintain the Group Bridge Dump there.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, November 1-30, 1944 |page=8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:U.S. infantry soliders deploying an M2 assault boat in Europe in World War II.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Combat engineer]]s ferrying infantry in [[assault boat#Assault Boats|M2 assault boat.]]]]\n\n[[File:Double Treadway M1 Pontoon Bridges built by 1139th at B\u00fcren, Germany, December 11, 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Double Treadway M1 Pontoon Bridges built by 1139th at B\u00fcren, Germany, December 11, 1944.]]\n\n[[File:Infantry support bridge over Saar River erected by 289th Engineers at Volklingen.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ponton bridge|Infantry support bridge]] over [[Saar River]] erected by 289th Engineers at [[Volklingen]]]]\n\nIn December 1944, while planning the crossing of the Saar River, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was stationed at Niedaltdorf, France.  On December 6, 1944,  the 90th Infantry Division, located near Wallerfangen, France, was ready to make the assault crossing. The 20th Engineer Combat Battalion began ferrying operations in [[Assault boat|Assault and storm boats]].  They ferried across two Battalions and part of a 3rd battalion of the 38th Infantry Regiment, while the 179th Engineer Combat Battalion ferried the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 357th Infantry Regiment.  Following these operations the storm boats continued to evacuate wounded and to deliver supplies.  Although all operations of the river were carried out under continuous heavy artillery and small arms fire day and night, there was no letup in the steady flow of materials and supplies by the storm boats.  However, the incoming fire was so heavy that power boats could not be brought down to the river for launching.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History, December 1\u201331, 1944\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group, December 1 - 31, 1944 |date=February 8, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts, a ferry was constructed on December 8, 1944 for ferrying vehicles, anti-tank guns and tanks across the river at Wallerfangen, with additional ferries at Pachten-Dillingen and Rehlingen-Siersburg, France, which made it possible to ferry all the vehicles and tanks of the 90th Infantry as rapidly as they were needed to secure a beachhead on the eastern shore.  This was of importance since a floating bridge was not able to be constructed, since sections were shot away as rapidly as they were placed into the water.  The Saar across from Dillingen, Germany, continued to prove difficult to cross because of heavy fire<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=39}}</ref> from a large number of occupied German [[Pillbox (military)|pill boxes]] on the eastern side of the river where the [[Siegfried Line]] had been most heavily constructed.  As a result, a bridgehead was not expanded there to any great depth, although ferrying operations continued until December 20, 1944.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, December 1 - 31, 1944 |page=2}}</ref>\n\nThese activities were interrupted as Germany made its last major offensive campaign; the [[Battle of the Bulge]] (also known as the Ardennes Counteroffensive). When General Patton learned of the attack, he quickly repositioned six full divisions of his army from their locations along the Saar River to launch a counterattack north to relieve the [[101st Airborne Division|U.S. 101st Airborne Division]] which had been trapped at Bastogne.  To replace the repositioned defensive divisions along the Saar River, the 90th Infantry Division withdrew from their eastern beachhead at Dillengen to join the 95th Infantry Division in defending the western side of the River.  The 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported both divisions in constructing defensive barriers consisting of mine fields, roadblocks, and bridges prepared for demolition, as well as guarding many of these deterrents.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, December 1 - 31, 1944 |page=3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Treadway M2 Bridge built by 1139th across the Saar River at Schoden, Germany March 2, 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Treadway M2 Bridge built by 1139th across the Saar River at Schoden, Germany March 2, 1945]]\n\nDuring January 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group continued to support defensive operations on the west bank of the Saar River, consisting of barrier zone and roadwork maintenance, installation of an anti-mine boom at Maim\u00fchle, Germany, roadway snow-plowing and sanding, guarding displaced German citizens at Niedaltdorf, removing mines and booby traps at Thionville, and patrolling the banks of the Moselle River.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History, January 1\u201331, 1945\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group, January 1 - 31, 1945 |date=February 8, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\nBy February, the Germans were in full retreat from the Ardennes. During the first three weeks of February 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was engaged in miscellaneous engineer activities in support of the 94th Infantry Division and the 3rd Calvary Regiment.  Because of sudden thaws supplemented by heavy rains, the Moselle River was swollen to flood heights again.  As a result, great ice floes were swept down the river with such force that it necessitated the removal of all floating bridges.  The salvaged materials were removed and placed in the storage dumps, and as soon as possible the bridges were reconstructed to allow traffic over the Moselle again.  On February 20, 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was given the mission of assisting the 94th Infantry Division in its assault crossing of the Saar River.

The 135th Engineer Combat Battalion installed a 240-foot Treadway bridge at Taben, Germany, and a 286' Heavy Ponton Bridge at Saarburg, Germany, and the 993rd Engineers Treadway Bridge Company built a 320-foot Treadway Bridge at Serrig, allowing the 94th Infantry Division to cross the Saar River and established a vital bridgehead at Serrig, Germany.  This, in turn, allowed a 286-foot Heavy Ponton bridge and a 336-foot Treadway bridge to be built across the Sarr at Niederleuken and Schoden, Germany, so that both Infantry and Armor could cross and reduce the enemy on the eastern side of the Saar.  On March 6, 1945, an additional 336-foot Treadway M2 C1 bridge was then established at Konz Karthaus, Germany by the 179th and the 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.\n\nDuring the first part of March 1945, the 1139th Group was engaged in engineering work necessary for the rapid advancement of the XX Corps from the Saar to the Rhine Rivers.  In addition to construction of many Bailey Bridges and small fixed bridges, they were tasked with supervising civilian labor on road work, preparing gun emplacements for artillery pieces, constructing camouflage screens and anti-mine booms at bridges, removing dead animals from minefields, hauling prisoners, demolishing buildings to widen roads, painting town signs, and destroying enemy tanks and artillery pieces.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History March 1\u201331, 1945\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group; March 1 - 31, 1945 |date=May 26, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Colonel Jackson and Colonel Niles at Rhine River Mainz, Germany, April 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Colonel Jackson (CO 160th) and Colonel Niles (CO 1139th) at Rhine River, Mainz, Germany, April 1945]]\n\nIn quick secession the American Armies were converging on the enemy in the Rhine-Moselle triangle; the [[4th Armored Division (United States)|4th Armored Division]] from the North, the [[10th Armored Division (United States)|10th]] and [[6th Armored Division (United States)|6th]] Armored Divisions from the South, and the [[United States Army Central|3rd]] and the [[Seventh United States Army|7th]] Armies from various locations.

Extensive studies were made by the 1139th Engineer Combat Group to determine the best site for crossing.  Study of all available maps and photos determined that the downtown area of Mainz, Germany, was the best site, even though the Rhine was wider at that point.  Profiles were prepared for the entire area, showing which terrain areas had to be captured or neutralized by artillery fire, and hydraulic data and river bed materials were studied to understand the types and sizes of anchors necessary for the bridge.  Finally, site reconnaissance at the river's edge by Group personnel determined the exact location for the bridge.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, March 1 - 31, 1945 |page=2}}</ref>  This crossing required two assault operations led by the 80th Infantry Division with support from the 135th Engineer Combat Battalion.<ref name=\"Builders and Fighters\">{{cite book |last1=Fowle |first1=Barry W. |title=Builders and Fighters U.S. Army Engineers in World War II |date=22 March 2005 |publisher=United States Army Corps of Engineers |location=Fort Belvoir, Virginia |isbn=9781410221773 |page=470 |edition=First Edition Revised 1992}}</ref>\n\nThe first infantry crossing (using assault boats) incurred a high causality rate, so the two battalions were then crossed by the 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported Navel units.  Once the infantry was ashore, ferrying operations were carried on by Navy operated boats, using 6 [[Landing Craft Mechanized|LCMs]] and 6 [[LCVP (United States)|Higgens Boats]].  During the launching there was heavy artillery fire, 20mm and small arms fire on the site, knocking out a bulldozer and killing a naval officer.  However, the 997th Engineer Treadway Company with assistance from the 160th Engineer Combat Battalion was able to construct a Treadway M2 Bridge across the Rhine 1,896 feet long; ''the Longest Tactical Bridge built in the European Theater of Operations''.<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=25}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Builders and Fighters U.S. Army Engineers in World War II |page=471}}</ref><ref>The 1370 foot long pontoon bridge built by the [[107th Engineer Battalion]] was the longest tactical floating bridge as of March 22, 1945.</ref>  This bridge served the entire XX Corps in crossing the Rhine and marked the end of the assault phase of the Rhein in the Third Army area.<ref>{{cite book |title=Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders |page=113.

On March 31, 1945 the Third Army started its run towards Berlin, from Mainz, Germany, traveling north-east through Frankfurt to Friedberg, to Alsfeld, then crossing the Fulda River with a 312-foot Treadway M2 Bridge, on to Reichensachsen, Germany.  Then traveling eastward they next bridged the Werra River and traveled to Langensalza, Germany, and after bridging the Helme River on April 11, 1945, they traveled along the [[Autobahn]] for two days constructing Bailey Bridges where needed to repair sections of the highway that had been destroyed by allied bombardment.  While traveling the Autobahn, they came across an area where the median strip had been paved as a landing airstrip and painted green, and on it sat an unusual-looking plane with no propeller.  It turned out to be one of the German Jet planes that had been abandoned during the rapid retreat of the German Army.<ref name=\"Interview\">{{cite news |last1=Gabriel |first1=Michael, SSGT, 1139th Engineer Combat Group |title=Personal Interview, July, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:VE Day Passing out Champagne to 1139th troops.jpg|thumb|left|300px|1139th Engineer Combat Group troops celebrating VE Day with Champagne, near Lambach, Austria, May 8, 1945]]\n\nThe 1139th stopped in Weimar, Germany, on April 13, 1945.  Here they were situated in the most luxurious barracks that they had stayed in; formerly used by German Anti-aircraft troops.  However, it was also here that they saw their most horrible of all sights; the [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald Concentration Camp]].  The Third Army had liberated the camp just two days earlier.  At the urging of General Patton, many of the 1139th troops visited the camp and saw the walking skeletons, stacks of withered corpses, and incompletely burned bodies, pits of lime covered bodies, and all saw emaciated inmates from the camp walking along the road towards Weimer, and heard firsthand accounts about the horrors from a former Captain of the Dutch army, who was taken in from the camp to act as an interpreter.<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=26}}</ref>\n\nOn April 16, 1945, the Third army continued moving eastward until it arrived just outside of Chemnitz, Germany.  At this point, they were only 135 miles from Berlin.  However, with the threat of a [[National redoubt|National Redoubt]] (potential reorganization and resistance by the remainder of the German army), [[Dwight D.

On April 27, 1945, they traveled to Regensburg where they stopped to develop plans for crossing the Danube River.

This coal was key to allowing Germany to rebuild its industries and in turn to feed its own population.<ref>{{cite book |title=Crusade in Europe |page=442}}</ref>\n\nColonel Niles and the 1139th Engineer Combat Group were given this duty. The 1139th was assigned to get the Bavarian and Saar coal mines back in operation.  This included clearing and preparing the mine sites for return to operations, and because there were few returning coal miners, the 1139th's Engineers were also required to providing training and education to the surviving populous on running the mine.  The 1139th worked on the mine projects for many months.  During these activities the 1139th was experiencing a slow reduction in troop size as the GIs with 45 VE Day points or more were discharged and returned home to the states.<ref name=\"Interview\" />\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group was disbanded in December 1946, with the last of the troops returning to the states.\n\n= Tables and Documents =\n\n== Table 1: Divisions and Regiments that were supported by the 1139th Engineer Combat Group ==\n{|class=\"wikitable nowraplinks\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

The 1139th Engineer Combat Group was part of the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] and was attached for operations to the [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] in direct support of the [[7th Armored Division (United States)|7th Armored Division]]. The 1139th Engineer Combat Group fought from northern France to Austria in World War II supporting General [[George S. Patton|George Patton]]'s Third Army's rapid movements during the war.\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group is credited with opening routes for the advancement of troops which included building 119 tactical bridges, of which 39 were 200 feet or longer, including the 1,896 foot \"longest floating tactical bridge constructed in the European theater of operations.\" The Group was first formed in December, 1943 and deactivated in December, 1946.\n\n=History=\n\n==Development of the Engineer Combat Group Concept==\nStarting with WWII, the United States Army defined a Combat Group to be similar to a Regiment, the unit from which the Group was evolved.  In general, a Regiment is composed of a fixed number of Battalions whose personnel and equipment are likewise fixed. The Battalions have only the minimum administrative personnel, with the result that administrative details are handled by the Regimental Headquarters.  In warfare as mobile and on as vast a scale as the European campaign was, it was felt that the Regiment was not sufficiently agile for achieving maximum effectiveness; therefor, the Group was created to be more flexible; units could be attached or detached as the situations warranted.\n\nIn the specific case of the Engineer Combat Group, all units were separate entities; the Group would consist of an unspecified number of separate companies and battalions, which were attached to and detached from the Group Headquarters as the situations demanded. Thus, in the instance of the 1139th Engineer Combat Group, there were as many as five battalions and three separate companies under their command at one time, and at other times they functioned with as little as a single company. The job of the 1139th was twofold; primarily they were responsible for the administration of the units under their command; and secondarily they acted in a supervisory capacity for all work assigned to the Group.  In addition to the combat engineer battalions, the group could have attached separate battalions and companies that specialized in and carried equipment for constructing specific types of bridges such as Heavy and Light [[Pontoon bridge|Ponton Bridges]], Treadway and Bailey Bridges, or other specialized support functions such as Area Lighting or Smoke Generation. The group was designed as a flexible organization set up to efficiently meet rapidly changing tactical requirements.  The units under control of Group Headquarters were used to support the Division's Engineer Operations, providing special equipment which the division engineers did not carry, and augmenting the personnel strength of the division Engineer Battalions.<ref name=\"1139th Engineers\">{{cite book |title=1139th Engineer Combat Group Unit History; 1 July 1944 to 8 May 1945 |publisher=1139th Engineer Combat Group |page=4}}</ref>\n\nThe Engineer Combat Group had many duties; construction, repair and dismantling of various bridge types, clearing of obstacles, road repair and construction, ferrying troops in river crossings, and detecting, removing, and laying of mines and demolitions, in addition to offensive and defensive infantry functions.\n\n==1139th Engineer Combat Group Training and Deployment==\n[[File:Camp Ellis Eng Grp Train.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Engineer Group at Camp Ellis training on bridge building techniques, 1940]]\n\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group, 1944 - 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Engineer Combat Group, 1944 - 1945]]\n\nMany of the troops that would eventually make up the 1139th Engineer Combat Group received their initial training at [[Camp Ellis|Camp Ellis, Illinois]], the Army Services Training Center located southwest of Peoria, Illinois.  From there they were sent to [[Beale Air Force Base|Camp Beale, California]], an Army training camp.  Most were consigned to \"the duration plus six months\".  In addition to their basic training courses, they received courses in camouflage, mine field clearing, mapping, reconnaissance, bridge building, and road construction.<ref name=\"Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders\">{{cite book |last1=Fitzharris |first1=Joseph C |title=Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders: Company B, 1303rd Engineer General Service Regiment |date=2007 |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |location=College Station, Texas |isbn=978-1-58544-550-9 |page=186}}</ref> The 1139th was commanded by Colonel John S.

Barry]].  Early the next morning the ship joined a convoy heading to Scotland.  They arrived at the town of Greenock, Firth of Clyde, Scotland on July 12, 1944.  The next day they disembarked and traveled via a twelve-hour train trip to Doddington, [[Nantwich]], England, where they organized their men and supplies, and drew vehicles, trailers and other T/E equipment (equipment specified for their specific operations) as required.\n\nOn August 1, 1944, they traveled via truck convoy from Doddington to [[Bournemouth | Bournemouth, England]]; a large troop marshaling area in preparation of movement to Continental Europe.  On August 5, 1944, they left England sailing on the USAT George Custer and arrived on [[Utah Beach]] just two months after the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings]] there.  Over the next two days, the unit disembarked and bivouacked in the Utah Beach area.\n\n== The 1139th in the European Theater of Operations ==\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group troops bivouacked in France, August 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Engineer Combat Group troops bivouacked in France, August 1944]]\n\nOn August 8, 1944, they proceeded in motor convoy across the Cherbourg Peninsula moving north to Briquebec, France, and at that point they began to work as an operational unit taking its position in the line of advance, with the [[First United States Army|First Army]] on its left flank and the [[XII Corps (United States)|XII Corps]] on the right flank.  The 1139th Engineer Combat Group was assigned to the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] and attached for operations to the [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] in direct support of the [[7th Armored Division (United States)|7th Armored Division]]. (When a unit is \"assigned\", it becomes a permanent part of the headquarters to which it is assigned. When the unit is \"attached\", it comes under the administrative and operational control of that unit to which it is attached.)\n\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group Troops.jpg|thumb|right|300px|1139th Engineer Combat Group Troops on the road]]\n\nIt was there that their Executive Officer, [[Walton Walker|Colonel Walton H. Walker]], outlined their responsibilities; as part of [[George S. Patton|General Patton's]] army the mission of the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was to travel directly behind the armor and remove mines, build bridges, fight as infantry and perform other engineering activities that allowed the rapid advancement of the XX Corps. (The XX Corps played a measurable role in [[Walton Walker|Patton's dash across France in August and early September 1944, earning the nickname \"Ghost Corps\" for the speed of its advance]]; starting in Briquebec, France, they traveled 600 miles in their first 30 days).<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=12}}</ref>   The XX Corps armored divisions typically traveled many miles ahead of the main body of the army which resulted in many enemy positions being overrun before alarm could be given.\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group arrived in the vicinity of Saint Jean sur Erve, France, on August 10, 1944, and was joined by their first battalions; the 135th, the 179th, and the 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.  The initial activity of the Group was to support the [[80th Division (United States)|80th Infantry Division]] in its thrust north against the enemy in the vicinity of Sainte-Suzanne, France.\n\nOn August 13, 1944, while en route during this advance, the Group removed landmines from roads and shoulders, and the first of the 1139th's bridges were constructed; two 60 foot [[Bailey bridge|Bailey Bridges]] built at St. Mars and St. George, France, on the sites of two bridges that had been blown up by the enemy.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, August 5-31, 1944 |page=2}}</ref>   (A Bailey Bridge is a temporary pre-fabricated, truss bridge, quickly assembled from prefabricated, standardized parts, assembled on land and then launched across an opening).<ref>{{cite book |title=Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders |page=189}}</ref>   Two days later they constructed two [[Ponton bridge|Treadway Bridges M2]] across the Huisne River at La Fert\u00e9-Bernard, and at Nogent-le-Rotrou, France.  (A Treadway Bridge is a floating bridge, using pontoons to support a continuous deck for pedestrian and vehicle travel).  In his European campaign, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]] recognized that the Treadway bridge was an essential piece of equipment to the campaign, easy to transport, quickly installed, and capable of sustaining heavy military loads.<ref name=\"Crusade in Europe\">{{cite book |last1=Eisenhower |first1=Dwight D. |title=Crusade in Europe |date=2 July 1997 |publisher=Doubleday & Company, Inc. |location=Garden City, New York |isbn=080185668X |page=380 |edition=1948 First}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1139th Troops bivouacked near Melun, France, August 23, 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Troops bivouacked near Melun, France, August 23, 1944]]\n\nOn August 17, 1944, the 1139th meet stiff resistance as they were trying to enter Chartres, France, requiring the 1139th Engineer Combat Group to take on their infantry role. They engaged in firefight operations by cleaning out machine-gun and anti-tank gun nests in Bonville, France, suffering 6 dead and 12 wounded.  They constructed two short Treadway bridges at Luce, France, west of Chartres and removed twelve large bombs from bridges in [[Chartres]].  By the next day they were joined by the 7th Armored Division, and the city was finally liberated.\n\nThe Group then moved north to the vicinity of Treon, France, in support of the 7th Armored Division.  There they were tasked with clearing the roads of mines, removing booby-trapped vehicles from roads, de-booby-trapping the Railroad station at Dreaux, France, and filling in road craters in the routes of the advancement.  They continued to move rapidly forward, and the Seine River was reached on August 23, 1944, where they bivouacked in an open field near Melun, France.  At Sainte Sauveur, France, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported the 7th Armored Division in its initial crossing of the Seine River at Tilly, France by manning assault boats, by establishing a beachhead and constructing a 504-foot Treadway Bridge while under direct fire, and by constructing a 204-foot foot-bridge across the canal at Melun, France.  The construction of the foot-bridge was carried on under heavy small arms and 88mm fire.  An 88mm shell blew out 50 feet of the bridge during construction, which had to be replaced while under intense enemy fire.<ref name=\"HQp4\">{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, August 5-31, 1944 |page=4}}</ref>\n\nOver the next few days, the Seine was bridged in three more places by the 991st and the 994th Engineer Treadway Bridge Companies, the 537th Engineer Light Ponton Company, and the 135th, 179th, and 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.<ref name=\"1139Engp15\">{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=15}}</ref> These crossings consisted of multiple span continuous Bailey bridges, a 210-foot Bailey at Vulaines-sur-Seine, Frances, and a 420-foot Bailey at Champagne, France.  Most of the construction was carried out at night, and took place under enemy fire, resulting in several lives lost.  When the bridges were completed, they were guarded and maintained while under considerable fire.<ref name=\"HQp4\" />\n\nArriving at Montmiral, France on August 28, 1944, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group underwent a leadership change with Executive Officer Colonel Walker leaving to become the commanding officer of the 1103rd Engineer Combat Group, and Lt. Col Robert Eininger replacing him.\n\nThe next major objective of the Third Army was Verdun, France and the Moselle Valley, which offered a natural gap in Germany's frontier line.  Early in the morning of September 2, 1944 the XX Corps arrived 5 miles west of Verdun.  Within a matter of hours, the city fell to the armored division, and on September 4, 1944, the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company had built a 200-foot Baily bridge over the Meuse River and a bridgehead was established on the eastern side of the river. At this point, the Third Army's Armored Divisions had outpaced the [[Red Ball Express|Redball]] gasoline supply column, and although emergency supply convoys were rushed south, the Germans had time to reinforce their [[Fortifications of Metz|positions at Metz, Germany]].  The American bridgehead had to be withdrawn from across the Meuse. While awaiting gasoline reinforcements the 1139th Engineer Combat Group completed a considerable amount of repair on the railroads in the vicinity.  Repairs were made by filling in bomb craters in the yards east of Verdun, and by rehabilitation of the track and roadbed from Conflans to Verdun, France, including construction of a 280-foot single track bridge at Conflans.<ref name=\"Headquarters Unit History, September 1\u201330, 1944\">{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group; September 1-30, 1944 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=7}}</ref>\n\nOn September 15, 1944, when adequate supplies had finally reached the Third Army, they moved on toward Thiacourt, France. The 135th Engineer Combat Battalion working with the 180th Engineer Heavy Ponton Battalion constructed a 260-foot Heavy Ponton bridge at Pagny, France.  Because of a shortage of Engineer troops, it was necessary to form a provisional platoon from the Group Headquarters Company to assist in the construction.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, September 1-30, 1944 |page=8}}</ref>  Then working with the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company, they constructed two 80 foot Bailey bridges across the Moselle River.

The cost in lives was high,<ref name=\"1139Engp15\" /> but it helped pave the way towards taking the heavily defended city of [[Metz]].

Over 5000 troops were under their command, including the 5th, 83rd, 90th, and 95th Infantry Divisions, the 179th and 206th Engineer Combat Battalions, the 991st Engineer Treadway Company, the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company, and the 623rd Engineer Light Equipment Company.  This concentration of men and equipment was in preparation of supporting the crossing of the Moselle River by the 10th Armored Division and the 90th and 95th Infantry Divisions.  In preparation for this, the troops were instructed in crossing techniques using [[Assault boat|Assault Boats]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Infantry Assault Boat Training Program |date=October 31, 1944 |publisher=Unclassified / Declassified Holdings of the National Archive |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20136}}</ref> and the Group experimented with building a rapid bridge-launching-device constructed on a tank frame.

These crossings were unusually difficult because the Moselle River was in a state of 30-year flood, and the enemy was continually making the bridging difficult with heavy artillery, machine gun and small arms fire.  The enemy fire at Cattenom, France, was so intense that the 440 foot Floating Bailey Bridge was eventually lost.  In most of these crossings the engineers had to first resort to ferrying operations in order for the infantry to clear a beachhead on the eastern shore so that the bridges could be constructed.  Numerous troop losses occurred during these crossings.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, November 1-30, 1944 |pages=2\u20136}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bailey Bridge at Thionville, France.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Bailey Bridge built across the Moselle River at Thionville, France by the 1139th.]]\n\nAfter the successful crossing of the Moselle River by the 90th and 95th Infantry Divisions and the 10th Armored Division, studies of aerial photographs revealed the need for all the engineers in the Group to assist in overcoming the obstacles left by the enemy; extensive antitank ditches, craters, pill boxes, blown bridges, and numerous mine fields (one minefield alone was estimated to contain 10,000 mines).<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, November 1-30, 1944 |page=7}}</ref>  The burden of this work was so great that the 135th Engineer Combat Battalion was reattached to the 1139th Engineer Combat Group for the purpose of taking over the work in the rear of the division, including filling craters and ditches, destroying pill boxes, constructing fords, marking minefields, posting road signs, changing town signs, and removing the dead to [[Mortuary Affairs|Graves Registration]].  Because of the large number of bridges under construction during November, it was also necessary to utilize the 88th Engineer Heavy Ponton Bridge Battalion to haul Bailey bridges from Army Supply Point No. 8 to Thionville, France, and to maintain the Group Bridge Dump there.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, November 1-30, 1944 |page=8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:U.S. infantry soliders deploying an M2 assault boat in Europe in World War II.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Combat engineer]]s ferrying infantry in [[assault boat#Assault Boats|M2 assault boat.]]]]\n\n[[File:Double Treadway M1 Pontoon Bridges built by 1139th at B\u00fcren, Germany, December 11, 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Double Treadway M1 Pontoon Bridges built by 1139th at B\u00fcren, Germany, December 11, 1944.]]\n\n[[File:Infantry support bridge over Saar River erected by 289th Engineers at Volklingen.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ponton bridge|Infantry support bridge]] over [[Saar River]] erected by 289th Engineers at [[Volklingen]]]]\n\nIn December, 1944, while planning the crossing of the Saar River, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was stationed at Niedaltdorf, France.  On December 6, 1944,  the 90th Infantry Division, located near Wallerfangen, France, was ready to make the assault crossing. The 20th Engineer Combat Battalion commenced ferrying operations in [[Assault boat|Assault and storm boats]].  They ferried across two Battalions and part of a 3rd battalion of the 38th Infantry Regiment, while the 179th Engineer Combat Battalion ferried the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 357th Infantry Regiment.  Following these operations the storm boats continued to evacuate wounded and to deliver supplies.  Although all operations of the river were carried out under continuous heavy artillery and small arms fire day and night, there was no let up in the steady flow of materials and supplies by the storm boats.  However, the incoming fire was so heavy that power boats could not be brought down to the river for launching.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History, December 1\u201331, 1944\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group, December 1 - 31, 1944 |date=February 8, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts, a ferry was constructed on December 8, 1944 for ferrying vehicles, anti-tank guns and tanks across the river at Wallerfangen, with additional ferries at Pachten-Dillingen and Rehlingen-Siersburg, France, which made it possible to ferry all the vehicles and tanks of the 90th Infantry as rapidly as they were needed to secure a beachhead on the eastern shore.  This was of importance since a floating bridge was not able to be constructed, since sections were shot away as rapidly as they were placed into the water.  The Saar across from Dillingen, Germany, continued to prove difficult to cross because of heavy fire<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=39}}</ref> from a large number of occupied German [[Pillbox (military)|pill boxes]] on the eastern side of the river where the [[Siegfried Line]] had been most heavily constructed.

When General Patton learned of the attack he quickly repositioned six full divisions of his army from their locations along the Saar River to launch a counterattack north to relieve the [[101st Airborne Division|U.S. 101st Airborne Division]] which had been trapped at Bastogne.  To replace the repositioned defensive divisions along the Saar River, the 90th Infantry Division withdrew from their eastern beachhead at Dillengen to join the 95th Infantry Division in defending the western side of the River.  The 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported both divisions in constructing defensive barriers consisting of mine fields, road blocks, and bridges prepared for demolition, as well as guarding many of these deterrents.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, December 1 - 31, 1944 |page=3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Treadway M2 Bridge built by 1139th across the Saar River at Schoden, Germany March 2, 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Treadway M2 Bridge built by 1139th across the Saar River at Schoden, Germany March 2, 1945]]\n\nDuring January 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group continued to support defensive operations on the west bank of the Saar River, consisting of barrier zone and roadwork maintenance, installation of an anti-mine boom at Maim\u00fchle, Germany, roadway snow-plowing and sanding, guarding displaced German citizens at Niedaltdorf, removing mines and booby traps at Thionville, and patrolling the banks of the Moselle River.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History, January 1\u201331, 1945\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group, January 1 - 31, 1945 |date=February 8, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\nBy February, the Germans were in full retreat from the Ardennes. During the first three weeks of February 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was engaged in miscellaneous engineer activities in support of the 94th Infantry Division and the 3rd Calvary Regiment.  Because of sudden thaws supplemented by heavy rains, the Moselle River was swollen to flood heights again.  As a result, great ice floes were swept down the river with such force that it necessitated the removal of all floating bridges.  The salvaged materials were removed and placed in the storage dumps, and as soon as possible the bridges were reconstructed to allow traffic over the Moselle again.  On February 20, 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was given the mission of assisting the 94th Infantry Division in its assault crossing of the Saar River.  Under heavy enemy fire coming from strategically located pill boxes on the east bank, three successful assault crossings were made between the 21st and 23 February at Taben, Serrig, and Ayl, Germany.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History, February 1\u201328, 1945\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group, February 1 - 28, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=1}}</ref>\n\nThe first bridge crossings of the Saar River under the direction of the 1139th occurred February 24 and 26, 1945.

This, in turn, allowed a 286-foot Heavy Ponton bridge and a 336-foot Treadway bridge to be built across the Sarr at Niederleuken and Schoden, Germany, so that both Infantry and Armor could cross and reduce the enemy on the eastern side of the Saar.  On March 6, 1945, an additional 336-foot Treadway M2 C1 bridge was then established at Konz Karthaus, Germany by the 179th and the 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.\n\nDuring the first part of March 1945, the 1139th Group was engaged in engineering work necessary for the rapid advancement of the XX Corps from the Saar to the Rhine Rivers.  In addition to construction of numerous Bailey Bridges and small fixed bridges, they were tasked with supervising civilian labor on road work, preparing gun emplacements for artillery pieces, constructing camouflage screens and anti-mine booms at bridges, removing dead animals from minefields, hauling prisoners, demolishing buildings to widen roads, painting town signs, and destroying enemy tanks and artillery pieces.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History March 1\u201331, 1945\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group; March 1 - 31, 1945 |date=May 26, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Colonel Jackson and Colonel Niles at Rhine River Mainz, Germany, April 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Colonel Jackson (CO 160th) and Colonel Niles (CO 1139th) at Rhine River, Mainz, Germany, April 1945]]\n\nIn quick secession the American Armies were converging on the enemy in the Rhine-Moselle triangle; the [[4th Armored Division (United States)|4th Armored Division]] from the North, the [[10th Armored Division (United States)|10th]] and [[6th Armored Division (United States)|6th]] Armored Divisions from the South, and the [[United States Army Central|3rd]] and the [[Seventh United States Army|7th]] Armies from various locations.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Tigers represent the [[University of Memphis]] in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[American Athletic Conference]].\n\nAlthough Memphis began competing in intercollegiate football in 1912,<ref name=\"MG\" /> the school's official record book considers the \"modern era\" to have begun in 1947. Records from before this year are often incomplete and inconsistent, and they are generally not included in these lists.\n\nThese lists are dominated by more recent players for several reasons:\n* Since 1947, seasons have increased from 10 games to 11 and then 12 games in length.\n* The NCAA didn't allow freshmen to play varsity football until [[1972 college football season|1972]] (with the exception of the [[World War II]] years), allowing players to have four-year careers.\n* [[Bowl game]]s only began counting toward single-season and career statistics in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://a.espncdn.com/ncf/news/2002/0828/1423821.html|title = NCAA changes policy on football stats|date = 2002-08-28|accessdate = 2016-08-20|website = ESPN.com|publisher = AP|last = |first = }}</ref> The Tigers have played in eight bowl games since this decision, with a ninth now assured in 2018, giving many recent players an extra game to accumulate statistics.\n* The Tigers have played in the [[American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game|American Championship Game]] twice, in 2017 and 2018. Normally, this gives players in those seasons yet another game to accumulate statistics. However, the Tigers were unable to play one of their originally scheduled games in 2017 due to disruptions resulting from [[Hurricane Irma]].\n\nThese lists are updated through the [[2018 Memphis

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Tigers represent the [[University of Memphis]] in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[American Athletic Conference]].\n\nAlthough Memphis began competing in intercollegiate football in 1912,<ref name=\"MG\" /> the school's official record book considers the \"modern era\" to have begun in 1947. Records from before this year are often incomplete and inconsistent, and they are generally not included in these lists.\n\nThese lists are dominated by more recent players for several reasons:\n* Since 1947, seasons have increased from 10 games to 11 and then 12 games in length.\n* The NCAA didn't allow freshmen to play varsity football until [[1972 college football season|1972]] (with the exception of the [[World War II]] years), allowing players to have four-year careers.\n* [[Bowl game]]s only began counting toward single-season and career statistics in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://a.espncdn.com/ncf/news/2002/0828/1423821.html|title = NCAA changes policy on football stats|date = 2002-08-28|accessdate = 2016-08-20|website = ESPN.com|publisher = AP|last = |first = }}</ref> The Tigers have played in eight bowl games since this decision, with a ninth now assured in 2018, giving many recent players an extra game to accumulate statistics.\n* The Tigers have played in the [[American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game|American Championship Game]] twice, in 2017 and 2018. Normally, this gives players in those seasons yet another game to accumulate statistics. However, the Tigers were unable to play one of their originally scheduled games in 2017 due to disruptions resulting from [[Hurricane Irma]].\n\nThese lists are updated through the [[2018 Memphis

He was closely associated with [[Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] serving as his private and press secretary and later as his [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]]. He was one of Lloyd George's go-betweens in the sale of honours for the Lloyd George Fund. In his dealings with the press he would certainly have been labelled a [[spin doctor]] if that phrase had had currency in the early twentieth century, indeed he has recently been described as \"the first of the modern spin doctors\".<ref>Lance Price, ''Where the Power lies - Prime Ministers v The Media'' Simon & Schuster Ltd, 2010 Page 47</ref>\n\n==Family and education==\nSutherland was born in [[Glasgow]], the son of Alan Sutherland. He was educated at The [[High School of Glasgow]] <ref>Brian R.W. Lockart, ''The Town School - A History of The High School of Glasgow'', Birlinn, Edinburgh, 2010 Page 163</ref> and at [[Glasgow University]] where he gained an [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|MA]] degree.,<ref>The Times, 20 September 1949, p7</ref> and was admitted to the [[Middle Temple]] on 18 January 1904,<ref>Sturgess, H.A.C. (1949). ''Register of Admissions to the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple''. Butterworth & Co. (Publishers) Ltd.: Temple Bar. Vol. 2, p.734.</ref> withdrawing without being [[Called to the Bar]] on 3 March 1927. On 27 August 1921 he married Annie Christine Fountain, CBE of Birthwaite Hall, near [[Barnsley]]. The wedding was attended by [[Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] and [[Margaret Lloyd George|Mrs Lloyd George]].<ref>The Times, 29 August 1921, p11</ref> His wife died in 1949.<ref>''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref> His uncle, [[Angus Sutherland (politician)|Angus Sutherland]] was Liberal MP for [[Sutherland (UK Parliament constituency)|Sutherland]] from 1886\u20131894.<ref>Ewen A Cameron, ''Angus Sutherland'' in ''Dictionary of National Biography'', OUP 2004-08</ref>\n\n==Career==\nSutherland entered the civil service after leaving university and was appointed to the [[Board of Trade]]. This was where he first attracted Lloyd George's attention when he was [[President of the Board of Trade]]. Sutherland helped Lloyd George prepare and develop some of his legislation. He made a particular study of the Land question and between 1909 and 1913 he wrote tracts or books entitled ''The Call of the Land'', ''The Land Question'' and ''Rural Regeneration''. He was also involved in the preparation of the legislation on [[Old Age Pensions Act 1908|Old Age Pensions]] and [[National Insurance Act 1911|National Insurance]] and assisted in the implementation of these measures.<ref>John Grigg, ''Lloyd George: From Peace to War, 1912-1916''; Penguin Books, 2002 edition, p262-263</ref> In 1907 he wrote ''Old Age Pensions, in Theory and Practice, with Some Foreign Examples'' (published by Methuen). He also wrote a one shilling pamphlet in 1920 about the work of [[Coalition Government 1916-1922|Coalition government]] of David Lloyd George,<ref>''1916-1920: The Lloyd George Coalition in War and Peace''; L J Gooding, 1907.</ref> However the work was dismissed in the press as \"no more than a child\u2019s guide for Coalition candidates and other apologists of the government\".<ref>The Times, 11 September 1920, p8</ref> By now a true intimate of the Welsh Wizard, he followed Lloyd George to the [[Ministry of Munitions]], the [[War Office]] and, eventually to [[Number 10 Downing Street]].\n\n==Politics==\n===Lloyd George fund raiser===\n\nFrom his administrative and then Parliamentary association with Lloyd George, Sutherland developed an increasingly close political connection to the Prime Minister. In the run up to the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]], he was used as a fund-raiser from wealthy sources. He was described by political insider and newspaper magnate [[George Riddell, 1st Baron Riddell|Lord Riddell]] as \"...an amusing, cynical dog\".<ref>John M McEwen (ed.) ''The Riddell Diaries: 1908-1923''; The Athlone Press, 1986 p233</ref> He was a major participant in the honours scandal through which Lloyd George was able to build up his war-chest, the [[Lloyd George Fund]]. One historian has called Sutherland \"an unsavoury character\" who, together with [[Maundy Gregory]], Lloyd George used to raise money by lavishly dispensing honours at inflated prices  <ref>Martin Pugh, ''The Making of Modern British Politics, 1867-1945''; Blackwell Publishing, 2002 p183</ref> and he had a reputation for indulging in the good life by hawking [[baronetcies]] at London Clubs.<ref>Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, ''British Political Finance, 1830-1980''; American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, 1981, p45</ref>\n\n===Policy adviser===\n\nIn 1918 Sutherland zealously assisted Lloyd George in building a case to discredit Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice in the circumstances surrounding the [[Maurice Debate]].<ref>Sir Ronald Wingate Bt., ''The Maurice Case: From the Papers of Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice''; Leo Cooper Ltd., 1972</ref> He was one Lloyd George's closest policy advisers. He understood that the old Liberal themes of education, [[Free trade]] and [[Temperance movement|temperance]] had lost their resonance with the electorate. In their place he urged an emphasis on social and economic issues.<ref>[[K O Morgan]], ''The Age of Lloyd George: The Liberal Party and British Politics, 1890-1929''; George Allen & Unwin, 1971 p81</ref> This analysis harked back to the [[social liberalism]] of the Liberal Governments of 1908-1914 and certainly pre-figured the radical direction Liberal policy took in the later 1920s when Lloyd George was reinstated as party leader and commissioned the series of \u2018coloured books\u2019 on land, industry and employment policy which formed the basis of the Liberal manifesto for the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]]. Sutherland also participated in the building up of the Coalition Liberal organisation in the constituencies, particularly in Scotland <ref>Michael Kinnear, ''The British Voter: An Atlas and Survey Since 1885''; Cornell University Press, 1968 p92n</ref> and took charge of the publicity programme.<ref>[[K O Morgan]] in [[A J P Taylor]] (ed.) ''Lloyd George: Twelve Essays''; Hamish Hamilton, 1971 p235</ref> His warnings on the need to have good constituency organisation if the Lloyd George [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberals]] were going to possess effective local influence went largely unheeded however.<ref>Chris Cook, in A J P Taylor (ed.) ''Lloyd George: Twelve Essays''; Hamish Hamilton, 1971 p294</ref>\n\n===Press fixer===\n\nLloyd George also employed Sutherland to further his interests with the press.<ref>Roy Douglas, ''The History of the Liberal Party, 1895-1970''; Sidgwick & Jackson, 1971 p168n</ref> He built up useful relations with newspaper editors in order to promote Lloyd George's achievements and the record of the Coalition.<ref>McEwen, op cit pp242 & 264</ref> In his role as go-between with Lloyd George and the journalists in the [[The Lobby|Lobby]] he acquired the nickname \u2018Bronco Bill\u2019 Sutherland (the media circus ringmaster in the age of the press lords) <ref>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/17/labour.comment</ref> and would allegedly invent damaging stories about Lloyd George's political opponents, which were then published in the press as genuine \u2013 although he was never named as the source.<ref>Michael Cockerell, Peter Hennessy & David Walker, ''Sources Close to the Prime Minister: Inside the Hidden World of the News Manipulators''; Macmillan, 1984 p67</ref>  Lloyd George retained a high regard for Sutherland. As late as 1932 he was referring to him as \"...one of the best and cutest politicians of the day.\" <ref>[[A. J. Sylvester]], Colin Cross (ed.) ''Life with Lloyd George: the diary of A.J.

He was closely associated with [[Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] serving as his private and press secretary and later as his [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]]. He was one of Lloyd George's go-betweens in the sale of honours for the Lloyd George Fund. In his dealings with the press he would certainly have been labelled a [[spin doctor]] if that phrase had had currency in the early twentieth century, indeed he has recently been described as \"the first of the modern spin doctors\".<ref>Lance Price, ''Where the Power lies - Prime Ministers v The Media'' Simon & Schuster Ltd, 2010 Page 47</ref>\n\n==Family and education==\nSutherland was born in [[Glasgow]], the son of Alan Sutherland. He was educated at The [[High School of Glasgow]] <ref>Brian R.W. Lockart, ''The Town School - A History of The High School of Glasgow'', Birlinn, Edinburgh, 2010 Page 163</ref> and at [[Glasgow University]] where he gained an [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|MA]] degree.,<ref>The Times, 20 September 1949, p7</ref> and was admitted to the [[Middle Temple]] on 18 January 1904,<ref>Sturgess, H.A.C.

Vol. 2, p.734.</ref> withdrawing without being [[Called to the Bar]] on 3 March 1927. On 27 August 1921 he married Annie Christine Fountain, CBE of Birthwaite Hall, near [[Barnsley]]. The wedding was attended by [[Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] and [[Margaret Lloyd George|Mrs Lloyd George]].<ref>The Times, 29 August 1921, p11</ref> His wife died in 1949.<ref>''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref> His uncle, [[Angus Sutherland (politician)|Angus Sutherland]] was Liberal MP for [[Sutherland (UK Parliament constituency)|Sutherland]] from 1886\u20131894.<ref>Ewen A Cameron, ''Angus Sutherland'' in ''Dictionary of National Biography'', OUP 2004-08</ref>\n\n==Career==\nSutherland entered the civil service after leaving university and was appointed to the [[Board of Trade]]. This was where he first attracted Lloyd George's attention when he was [[President of the Board of Trade]]. Sutherland helped Lloyd George prepare and develop some of his legislation. He made a particular study of the Land question and between 1909 and 1913 he wrote tracts or books entitled ''The Call of the Land'', ''The Land Question'' and ''Rural Regeneration''. He was also involved in the preparation of the legislation on [[Old Age Pensions Act 1908|Old Age Pensions]] and [[National Insurance Act 1911|National Insurance]] and assisted in the implementation of these measures.<ref>John Grigg, ''Lloyd George: From Peace to War, 1912-1916''; Penguin Books, 2002 edition, p262-263</ref> In 1907 he wrote ''Old Age Pensions, in Theory and Practice, with Some Foreign Examples'' (published by Methuen). He also wrote a one shilling pamphlet in 1920 about the work of [[Coalition Government 1916-1922|Coalition government]] of David Lloyd George,<ref>''1916-1920: The Lloyd George Coalition in War and Peace''; L J Gooding, 1907.</ref> However the work was dismissed in the press as \"no more than a child\u2019s guide for Coalition candidates and other apologists of the government\".<ref>The Times, 11 September 1920, p8</ref> By now a true intimate of the Welsh Wizard, he followed Lloyd George to the [[Ministry of Munitions]], the [[War Office]] and, eventually to [[Number 10 Downing Street]].\n\n==Politics==\n===Lloyd George fund raiser===\n\nFrom his administrative and then Parliamentary association with Lloyd George, Sutherland developed an increasingly close political connection to the Prime Minister. In the run up to the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]], he was used as a fund-raiser from wealthy sources. He was described by political insider and newspaper magnate [[George Riddell, 1st Baron Riddell|Lord Riddell]] as \"...an amusing, cynical dog\".<ref>John M McEwen (ed.) ''The Riddell Diaries: 1908-1923''; The Athlone Press, 1986 p233</ref> He was a major participant in the honours scandal through which Lloyd George was able to build up his war-chest, the [[Lloyd George Fund]]. One historian has called Sutherland \"an unsavoury character\" who, together with [[Maundy Gregory]], Lloyd George used to raise money by lavishly dispensing honours at inflated prices  <ref>Martin Pugh, ''The Making of Modern British Politics, 1867-1945''; Blackwell Publishing, 2002 p183</ref> and he had a reputation for indulging in the good life by hawking [[baronetcies]] at London Clubs.<ref>Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, ''British Political Finance, 1830-1980''; American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, 1981, p45</ref>\n\n===Policy adviser===\n\nIn 1918 Sutherland zealously assisted Lloyd George in building a case to discredit Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice in the circumstances surrounding the [[Maurice Debate]].<ref>Sir Ronald Wingate Bt., ''The Maurice Case: From the Papers of Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice''; Leo Cooper Ltd., 1972</ref> He was one Lloyd George's closest policy advisers. He understood that the old Liberal themes of education, [[Free trade]] and [[Temperance movement|temperance]] had lost their resonance with the electorate. In their place he urged an emphasis on social and economic issues.<ref>[[K O Morgan]], ''The Age of Lloyd George: The Liberal Party and British Politics, 1890-1929''; George Allen & Unwin, 1971 p81</ref> This analysis harked back to the [[social liberalism]] of the Liberal Governments of 1908-1914 and certainly pre-figured the radical direction Liberal policy took in the later 1920s when Lloyd George was reinstated as party leader and commissioned the series of \u2018coloured books\u2019 on land, industry and employment policy which formed the basis of the Liberal manifesto for the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]]. Sutherland also participated in the building up of the Coalition Liberal organisation in the constituencies, particularly in Scotland <ref>Michael Kinnear, ''The British Voter: An Atlas and Survey Since 1885''; Cornell University Press, 1968 p92n</ref> and took charge of the publicity programme.<ref>[[K O Morgan]] in [[A J P Taylor]] (ed.)

was used in Europe at the beginning of the millennium, and all countries that once used the Julian calendar had adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]] by the end of it. For this reason, the end date of the 2nd millennium is usually calculated based on the Gregorian calendar, while the beginning date is based on the Julian calendar  (or occasionally the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]]).\n\nIn the late 1990s, there was a dispute as to whether the millennium should be taken to end on December 31, 1999, or December 31, 2000.\n[[Stephen Jay Gould]] at the time argued there is no objective way of deciding this question.<ref>Stephen Jay Gould, ''Questioning the Millennium: A Rationalist's Guide to a Precisely Arbitrary Countdown'' (New York: Harmony Books, 1999), ch 2.</ref> \n[[Associated Press]] reported that the third millennium began on 1 January  2001, but also reported that celebrations in the US were generally more subdued at the beginning of 2001, compared to the beginning of 2000.<ref>Associated Press, [http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/01/news/mn-7177 \"Y2K It Wasn't, but It Was a Party\"], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 1, 2001.</ref>\nMany public celebrations for the end of the second millennium were held on December 31, 1999 \u2013 January 1, 2000<ref>{{cite web | title = Millennium FAQs \u2013 Frequently Asked Questions | work = When does the Millennium start? | publisher = Greenwich2000.ltd.uk | date = 2008-08-12 | url = http://wwp.millennium-dome.com/info/millennium-faq.htm | accessdate = 2009-01-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090112125450/http://wwp.millennium-dome.com/info/millennium-faq.htm| archivedate= 12 January 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref>\u2014with a few people marking the end of the millennium a year later.\n\n==Centuries and decades==\n\n{| cellpadding=\"3\" border=\"0\"\n|-----\n| align=\"right\" | '''[[11th century]]'''\n| align=\"left\" | [[1000s (decade)|1000s]]<ref group=note>Only the nine years 1001\u20131009 of the [[1000s decade]] were in the 2nd millennium; the year 1000 was the last year of the [[1st millennium]] (1\u20131000).

Its final two centuries coincide with [[Modern history]], characterized by [[industrialization]], the rise of [[nation state]]s, the rapid development of [[science]], widespread [[education]], and universal [[medical|health care]] and [[vaccination]]s in the [[Western world]]. The [[20th century]] saw increasing [[globalization]], most notably the two [[World Wars]] and the subsequent formation of the [[United Nations]]. 20th-century technology includes [[powered flight]], [[television]] and [[Semiconductor device|semiconductor technology]], including [[integrated circuit]]s.  The term \"[[Great Divergence]]\" was coined to refer the unprecedented cultural and political ascent of the [[Western world]] in the second half of the millennium, emerging by the 18th century as the most powerful and wealthy [[Cultural globalization|world civilization]], having eclipsed [[Qing China]] and the [[Islamic World]].\n\n[[World population]] grew without precedent over the millennium, from about 310 million in 1000 to about 6 billion in 2000.\nThe [[population growth]] rate increased dramatically during this time; world population approximately doubled to 600 million by 1700, and

was used in Europe at the beginning of the millennium, and all countries that once used the Julian calendar had adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]] by the end of it. For this reason, the end date of the 2nd millennium is usually calculated based on the Gregorian calendar, while the beginning date is based on the Julian calendar  (or occasionally the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]]).\n\nIn the late 1990s, there was a dispute as to whether the millennium should be taken to end on December 31, 1999, or December 31, 2000.\n[[Stephen Jay Gould]] at the time argued there is no objective way of deciding this question.<ref>Stephen Jay Gould, ''Questioning the Millennium: A Rationalist's Guide to a Precisely Arbitrary Countdown'' (New York: Harmony Books, 1999), ch 2.</ref> \n[[Associated Press]] reported that the third millennium began on 1 January  2001, but also reported that celebrations in the US were generally more subdued at the beginning of 2001, compared to the beginning of 2000.<ref>Associated Press, [http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/01/news/mn-7177 \"Y2K It Wasn't, but It Was a Party\"], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 1, 2001.</ref>\nMany public celebrations for the end of the second millennium were held on December 31, 1999 \u2013 January 1, 2000<ref>{{cite web | title = Millennium FAQs \u2013 Frequently Asked Questions | work = When does the Millennium start? | publisher = Greenwich2000.ltd.uk | date = 2008-08-12 | url = http://wwp.millennium-dome.com/info/millennium-faq.htm | accessdate = 2009-01-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090112125450/http://wwp.millennium-dome.com/info/millennium-faq.htm| archivedate= 12 January 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref>\u2014with a few people marking the end of the millennium a year later.\n\n==Centuries and decades==\n\n{| cellpadding=\"3\" border=\"0\"\n|-----\n| align=\"right\" | '''[[11th century]]'''\n| align=\"left\" | [[1000s (decade)|1000s]]<ref group=note>Only the nine years 1001\u20131009 of the [[1000s decade]] were in the 2nd millennium; the year 1000 was the last year of the [[1st millennium]] (1\u20131000).
