In most parts of the world, a missing person will usually be found quickly. While [[Kidnapping|criminal abductions]] are some of the most widely reported missing person cases, these account for only 2\u20135% of missing children in Europe.\n\nBy contrast, some missing person cases remain unresolved for many years.<!-- STATS NEEDED:- \"Worldwide X people go missing each year\" or something. --> Laws related to these cases are often complex since, in many jurisdictions, relatives and third parties may not deal with a person's assets until their death is considered proven by law and a formal [[death certificate]] issued. The situation, uncertainties, and lack of [[Closure (psychology)|closure]] or a [[funeral]] resulting when a person goes missing may be extremely painful with long-lasting effects on family and friends.\n\nA number of organizations seek to connect, share best practices, and disseminate information and images of missing children to improve the effectiveness of missing children investigations, including the [[International Commission on Missing Persons]], the [[International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children]] (ICMEC), as well as national organizations, including the [[National Center for Missing & Exploited Children]] in the US, [[Missing People]] in the UK, [[Child Focus]] in Belgium, and [[The Smile of the Child]] in Greece.\n\n== Reasons ==\nPeople disappear for many reasons. Some individuals choose to disappear alone. Reasons for non-identification may include:\n\n* To escape domestic abuse.\n* Leaving home to live somewhere else under a new identity.\n* Becoming the victim of [[kidnapping]].\n* [[Child abduction]] by a non-custodial parent or other relative.\n* Seizure by government officials without [[due process|due process of law]] (see [[forced disappearance]]).\n* [[Suicide]] in a remote location or under an [[pseudonym|assumed name]] (generally to spare their families the suicide at home or to allow their deaths to be eventually [[declared death in absentia|declared ''in absentia'']]).\n* Victim of [[murder]] (body disguised, destroyed, or hidden).\n* [[Mental disorder|Mental illness]] or other ailments such as [[Alzheimer's Disease]] can cause people to forget where or who they are.\n* Death by [[natural causes]] (disease) or accident far from home without identification.\n* Disappearance to take advantage of better employment or living conditions elsewhere.\n* Sold into slavery, serfdom, sexual servitude, or other [[unfree labor]].\n* To avoid discovery of a crime or apprehension by law-enforcement authorities. (''See also'' [[failure to appear]].)\n* Joining a [[cult]] or other religious organization that requires no contact to the outside world.  \n* To avoid [[war]] or persecution during a [[genocide]].\n* To escape famine or natural disaster.\n* Death by [[flood]]s, [[flash flood]]s, [[debris flow]]s, [[hurricane]]s, [[tsunami]]s and [[tornado]]es.\n* Death in the water, with no body recovered.\n\n== Categories of missing children ==\n* '''Runaways''' (national / international): Minors who run away from home, from the institution where they have been placed, or from the people responsible for their care.\n* '''Abduction by a third person''': Abduction of minors by anyone other than the parents or the persons with parental authority.\n* '''National or international parental abduction''': Parental abductions are cases where a child is taken to or kept in a country or place other than that of his/her normal residence by one or more parents or persons with parental authority, against another parent's will or against the will of the person with parental authority.\n* '''Missing unaccompanied migrant minors''': Disappearances of migrant children, nationals of a country in which there is no free movement of persons, under the age of 18 who have been separated from both parents and are not being cared for by an adult, who by law is responsible for doing so.\n* '''Lost, injured or otherwise missing children''': Disappearances for no apparent reason of minors who got lost (e.g., young children at the seaside in summer) or hurt themselves and cannot be found immediately (e.g., accidents during sport activities, at youth camps, etc.), as well as children whose reason for disappearing has not yet been determined.\n\n== Legal aspects ==\nA [[List of common misconceptions|common misconception]] is that a person must be absent for at least 24 hours before being legally classed as missing, but this is rarely the case. Law enforcement agencies often stress that the case should be reported as early as possible.<ref>{{cite news|title=Missing persons usually found|author1=Preston Sparks|author2=Timothy Cox|lastauthoramp=yes|date=November 17, 2008|newspaper=[[Augusta Chronicle]]|accessdate=May 21, 2011|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2008/11/17/met_483813.shtml|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214111833/http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2008/11/17/met_483813.shtml|archivedate=December 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missingpersons.gov.au/nmpcc/faqs.aspx#a1|title=FAQs: Question: Do you need to wait 24 hours before reporting a person missing?|publisher=National Missing Persons Coordination Center, [[Australian Federal Police]]|accessdate=May 22, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214111833/http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2008/11/17/met_483813.shtml#a1|archivedate=December 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn most [[common law]] jurisdictions a missing person can be [[Declared death in absentia|declared dead ''in absentia'']] (or \"legally dead\") after seven years.

Disappearances at sea are a general exception, as these require a specialized agency such as a [[coast guard]]. In many countries, such as the United States, voluntary search and rescue teams can be called out to assist the police in the search. Rescue agencies such as [[fire department]]s, [[mountain rescue]] and [[cave rescue]] may also participate in cases that require their specialized resources.\n\nPolice forces such as [[Lancashire Constabulary]] stress the need to try to find the person quickly, to assess how vulnerable the person is, and to search places that the person may have links to.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lancashire.police.uk/faqs/missing-people/what-will-the-police-do-to-find-someone-who-is-reported-missing/|publisher=Lancashire Constabulary|title=What will the police do to find someone who is reported missing?}}</ref>\n\nVarious charities exist to assist the investigations into unsolved cases. These include the [[National Center for Missing & Exploited Children]] in the US, [[Missing People]] in the UK, [[Child Focus]] in Belgium, and [[The Smile of the Child]] in Greece. Some missing person cases are given wide media coverage, with the searchers turning to the public for assistance. The persons' photographs may be displayed on bulletin boards, milk cartons, postcards, websites and social media to publicize their description.\n\n==Media coverage==\n=== Race ===\n{{see also|Missing white woman syndrome}}\nA racial disparity between the American [[news media]] response when a white individual goes missing and when a black individual goes missing has been observed.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Seong-Jae|first=Min|last2=C.|first2=Feaster, John|title=Missing Children in National News Coverage: Racial and Gender Representations of Missing Children Cases|url=https://www.academia.edu/857391|journal=Communication Research Reports|language=en|volume=27|issue=3|issn=0882-4096}}</ref> According to Seong-Jae Min & John C. Feaster, throughout history the news media has provided white individuals, particularly affluent women, more comprehensive news coverage than [[Person of color|people of color]]. The authors have noted that while a [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] has been established, they have no clear [[Causality|causation]]. They suggest that the [[socioeconomic status]] or attractiveness of a child may also influence their chances of appearing in the news media.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAmerican journalist [[Howard Kurtz]], best known for his analysis of the media, supported the conclusion that a person's race and socioeconomic status impacted media coverage. He gave the kidnappings of [[Kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart|Elizabeth Smart]] and Alexis Patterson as an example\u2014when Smart, a young affluent Caucasian girl from Utah, went missing, the media coverage was worldwide. After several months of searching, she was found alive. In comparison, when Patterson, a young black girl from Wisconsin, went missing, she received only local news coverage and is still missing to this day.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nWithin the U.S., there are several organizations that bring awareness and equality to missing people of color, such as the Black and Missing Foundation, a non'''-'''profit organization founded in 2008.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackandmissinginc.com/cdad/about.htm|title=Missing Black Children, Missing Black Adults, Report a Missing Person|website=www.blackandmissinginc.com|access-date=2018-10-20}}</ref> The Black and Missing Foundation's goal is to provide resources to families of missing people of color and educate [[minority group]]s on personal safety.<ref name=\":8\" /> Additionally, Deidra Robey leads a non-profit organization called Black and Missing but not Forgotten, which provides assistance in spreading awareness about a missing person.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url=http://blackandmissing.org/volunteer/|title=Volunteer|work=Black and Missing {{!}} But Not Forgotten|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIt has also been speculated by Kristen Gilchrist that, in Canadian news media, [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] women receive three and a half times less coverage than white women. Their articles were found to be shorter and less detailed\u2014with an average word count for white women of 713 compared to 518 for Aboriginal women\u2014and less likely to be front-page news.

Of these, 203,900 children were reported as the victims of family abductions and 58,200 of non-family abductions. However, only 115 were the result of \"stereotypical\" kidnaps (by someone unknown or of slight acquaintance to the child, taking them a long distance with intent to murder or to hold them permanently or for ransom).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sedlack|first1=Andrea J.|title=National Estimates of Missing Children: An Overview|journal=NISMART Series Bulletin|date=2002|pages=7, 10|url=http://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=ccrc|accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Beam\">{{cite news |last=Beam |first=Christopher |title=800,000 Missing Kids?

The hotline was an initiative pushed for by Missing Children Europe, the European federation for missing and sexually exploited children.\n\nThe Council of Europe estimates that about 1 in 5 children in Europe are victims of some form of sexual violence. In 70% to 85% of cases, the abuser is somebody the child knows and trusts. Child sexual violence can take many forms: sexual abuse within the family circle, child pornography and prostitution, corruption, solicitation via Internet and sexual assault by peers. In some of the cases, with no other available option, children flee their homes and care institutions, in search of a better and safer life.\n\nOf the 50\u201360% of child runaways reported by the 116 000 European missing children hotline network, 1 in 6 are assumed to rough sleep on the run, 1 in 8 resort to stealing to survive and 1 in 4 children are at serious risk of some form of abuse. The number of rough sleeping children across Europe is on the rise. These runaways fall into vulnerable situations of [[Child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]], alcohol abuse and drug abuse leading to depression. Runaways are 9 times likelier to have suicidal tendencies than other children. The Children's Society published a report in 2011 on recommendations to the government to keep child runaways safe.\n \nThe issue of child disappearances is increasingly recognized as a concern for national and international policy makers especially in cross border abduction cases, organized child trafficking and child pornography as well as the transient nature of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum.\n\nAccording to the UNHCR, over 15,000 unaccompanied and separated children claimed [[asylum in the European Union]], Norway and Switzerland in 2009. The precarious situation of these children makes them particularly vulnerable to human rights abuses, rendering their protection critical, given the high risks to which they are exposed. Most of these children are boys aged 14 years and over, with diverse ethnic, cultural, religious and social backgrounds mainly originating from Afghanistan, Somalia, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea and Iraq.\n\nAmong exploiters taking advantage of the children, are sometimes their own relatives who gain benefit in the form of social and/or family allowances. According to research done by Frontex, some types of threats faced by unaccompanied migrant minors include sexual exploitation in terms of pornography, prostitution and the internet; economic exploitation including forced donation of organs; criminal exploitation including drug smuggling and child trafficking including forced marriage and begging.\n\nCriminal networks are heavily involved with human trafficking to the EU and this includes also exploitation of minors as manpower in the sex trade and other criminal activities. According to a 2007 UNICEF report on Child Trafficking in Europe, 2 million children are being trafficked in Europe every year. Child trafficking occurs in virtually all countries in Europe. There is no clear-cut distinction between countries of origin and destination in Europe. Trafficking in children has been perceived mainly in connection with sexual exploitation, but the reality is much more complex. Children in Europe are also trafficked for exploitation through labour, domestic servitude, begging, criminal activities and other exploitative purposes.\n[[File:US Navy 061028-N-9662L-018 Petty Officer 1st Class Daniel Jones, a Sailor assigned to Naval Computer Telecommunications Station (NCTS) Guam, fingerprints Alexis Kosak during the 11th annual Project KidCare event held at Agana S.jpg|thumb|A sailor assigned to Naval Computer Telecommunications Station (NCTS) [[Guam]], [[fingerprint]]s Alexis Kosak during the 11th annual Project KidCare event held at [[Agana Shopping Center]]. The project's goal is to assist local authorities with locating and recovering missing children and inform the public about ways to prevent child abduction.]]\n\nIn the report, UNICEF also warns that there is a dramatic absence of harmonized and systematic data collection, analysis and dissemination at all levels without which countries lack important evidence that informs national policies and responses. Missing Children Europe, the European federation for missing children, aims to meet this need. The CRM system is expected to have a clear impact on the way hotlines are able to work together and collect data on the problem of missing children.\n\nThe British Asylum Screening Unit estimated that 60% of the unaccompanied minors accommodated in social care centres in the UK go missing and are not found again. In the UK these open centres, from where minors are able to call their traffickers, act as 'human markets' for the facilitators and traffickers who generally collect their prey within 24 hours of arrival in the UK. According to the CIA out of the 800,000 people trafficked annually across national borders in the world, up to 50% are minors.\n\n===International statistics and efforts===\nThe [[United Nations]] is operating a [[International Commission on Missing Persons|Commission on Missing Persons]] that serves as an international coordination center and provides also statistical material regarding missing persons worldwide. The [[Restoring Family Links|International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] strives to clarify the fate and whereabouts of missing persons when loss of contact is due to armed conflict or other situations of violence; natural or man-made disaster; migration and in other situations of humanitarian need. It is also supporting the families of missing persons to rebuild their social lives and find emotional well-being.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://familylinks.icrc.org/en/Pages/HowWeWork/Missing-Persons-and-their-Families.aspx |title=Restoring Family Links \u2013 Missing Persons and their Families |publisher=Familylinks.icrc.org |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223044829/http://familylinks.icrc.org/en/Pages/HowWeWork/Missing-Persons-and-their-Families.aspx |archivedate=February 23, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Monument ==\nOn May 26, 2002, a monument to missing persons was unveiled in [[County Kilkenny]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] by President [[Mary McAleese]].

In most parts of the world, a missing person will usually be found quickly. While [[Kidnapping|criminal abductions]] are some of the most widely reported missing person cases, these account for only 2\u20135% of missing children in Europe.\n\nBy contrast, some missing person cases remain unresolved for many years.<!-- STATS NEEDED:- \"Worldwide X people go missing each year\" or something. --> Laws related to these cases are often complex since, in many jurisdictions, relatives and third parties may not deal with a person's assets until their death is considered proven by law and a formal [[death certificate]] issued. The situation, uncertainties, and lack of [[Closure (psychology)|closure]] or a [[funeral]] resulting when a person goes missing may be extremely painful with long-lasting effects on family and friends.\n\nA number of organizations seek to connect, share best practices, and disseminate information and images of missing children to improve the effectiveness of missing children investigations, including the [[International Commission on Missing Persons]], the [[International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children]] (ICMEC), as well as national organizations, including the [[National Center for Missing & Exploited Children]] in the US, [[Missing People]] in the UK, [[Child Focus]] in Belgium, and [[The Smile of the Child]] in Greece.\n\n== Reasons ==\nPeople disappear for many reasons. Some individuals choose to disappear alone. Reasons for non-identification may include:\n\n* To escape domestic abuse.\n* Leaving home to live somewhere else under a new identity.\n* Becoming the victim of [[kidnapping]].\n* [[Child abduction]] by a non-custodial parent or other relative.\n* Seizure by government officials without [[due process|due process of law]] (see [[forced disappearance]]).\n* [[Suicide]] in a remote location or under an [[pseudonym|assumed name]] (generally to spare their families the suicide at home or to allow their deaths to be eventually [[declared death in absentia|declared ''in absentia'']]).\n* Victim of [[murder]] (body disguised, destroyed, or hidden).\n* [[Mental disorder|Mental illness]] or other ailments such as [[Alzheimer's Disease]] can cause people to forget where or who they are.\n* Death by [[natural causes]] (disease) or accident far from home without identification.\n* Disappearance to take advantage of better employment or living conditions elsewhere.\n* Sold into slavery, serfdom, sexual servitude, or other [[unfree labor]].\n* To avoid discovery of a crime or apprehension by law-enforcement authorities. (''See also'' [[failure to appear]].)\n* Joining a [[cult]] or other religious organization that requires no contact to the outside world.  \n* To avoid [[war]] or persecution during a [[genocide]].\n* To escape famine or natural disaster.\n* Death by [[flood]]s, [[flash flood]]s, [[debris flow]]s, [[hurricane]]s, [[tsunami]]s and [[tornado]]es.\n* Death in the water, with no body recovered.\n\n== Categories of missing children ==\n* '''Runaways''' (national / international): Minors who run away from home, from the institution where they have been placed, or from the people responsible for their care.\n* '''Abduction by a third person''': Abduction of minors by anyone other than the parents or the persons with parental authority.\n* '''National or international parental abduction''': Parental abductions are cases where a child is taken to or kept in a country or place other than that of his/her normal residence by one or more parents or persons with parental authority, against another parent's will or against the will of the person with parental authority.\n* '''Missing unaccompanied migrant minors''': Disappearances of migrant children, nationals of a country in which there is no free movement of persons, under the age of 18 who have been separated from both parents and are not being cared for by an adult, who by law is responsible for doing so.\n* '''Lost, injured or otherwise missing children''': Disappearances for no apparent reason of minors who got lost (e.g. young children at the seaside in summer) or hurt themselves and cannot be found immediately (e.g. accidents during sport activities, at youth camps, etc.), as well as children whose reason for disappearing has not yet been determined.\n\n== Legal aspects ==\nA [[List of common misconceptions|common misconception]] is that a person must be absent for at least 24 hours before being legally classed as missing, but this is rarely the case.

In many countries, such as the United States, voluntary search and rescue teams can be called out to assist the police in the search. Rescue agencies such as [[fire department]]s, [[mountain rescue]] and [[cave rescue]] may also participate in cases that require their specialized resources.\n\nPolice forces such as [[Lancashire Constabulary]] stress the need to try to find the person quickly, to assess how vulnerable the person is, and to search places that the person may have links to.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lancashire.police.uk/faqs/missing-people/what-will-the-police-do-to-find-someone-who-is-reported-missing/|publisher=Lancashire Constabulary|title=What will the police do to find someone who is reported missing?}}</ref>\n\nVarious charities exist to assist the investigations into unsolved cases.

The hotline was an initiative pushed for by Missing Children Europe, the European federation for missing and sexually exploited children.\n\nThe Council of Europe estimates that about 1 in 5 children in Europe are victims of some form of sexual violence. In 70% to 85% of cases, the abuser is somebody the child knows and trusts. Child sexual violence can take many forms: sexual abuse within the family circle, child pornography and prostitution, corruption, solicitation via Internet and sexual assault by peers. In some of the cases, with no other available option, children flee their homes and care institutions, in search of a better and safer life.\n\nOf the 50\u201360% of child runaways reported by the 116 000 European missing children hotline network, 1 in 6 are assumed to rough sleep on the run, 1 in 8 resort to stealing to survive and 1 in 4 children are at serious risk of some form of abuse. The number of rough sleeping children across Europe is on the rise. These runaways fall into vulnerable situations of [[Child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]], alcohol abuse and drug abuse leading to depression. Runaways are 9 times likelier to have suicidal tendencies than other children. The Children's Society published a report in 2011 on recommendations to the government to keep child runaways safe.\n \nThe issue of child disappearances is increasingly recognized as a concern for national and international policy makers especially in cross border abduction cases, organized child trafficking and child pornography as well as the transient nature of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum.\n\nAccording to the UNHCR, over 15,000 unaccompanied and separated children claimed [[asylum in the European Union]], Norway and Switzerland in 2009. The precarious situation of these children makes them particularly vulnerable to human rights abuses, rendering their protection critical, given the high risks to which they are exposed. Most of these children are boys aged 14 years and over, with diverse ethnic, cultural, religious and social backgrounds mainly originating from Afghanistan, Somalia, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea and Iraq.\n\nAmong exploiters taking advantage of the children, are sometimes their own relatives who gain benefit in the form of social and/or family allowances. According to research done by Frontex, some types of threats faced by unaccompanied migrant minors include sexual exploitation in terms of pornography, prostitution and the internet; economic exploitation including forced donation of organs; criminal exploitation including drug smuggling and child trafficking including forced marriage and begging.\n\nCriminal networks are heavily involved with human trafficking to the EU and this includes also exploitation of minors as manpower in the sex trade and other criminal activities. According to a 2007 UNICEF report on Child Trafficking in Europe, 2 million children are being trafficked in Europe every year. Child trafficking occurs in virtually all countries in Europe. There is no clear-cut distinction between countries of origin and destination in Europe. Trafficking in children has been perceived mainly in connection with sexual exploitation, but the reality is much more complex. Children in Europe are also trafficked for exploitation through labour, domestic servitude, begging, criminal activities and other exploitative purposes.\n[[File:US Navy 061028-N-9662L-018 Petty Officer 1st Class Daniel Jones, a Sailor assigned to Naval Computer Telecommunications Station (NCTS) Guam, fingerprints Alexis Kosak during the 11th annual Project KidCare event held at Agana S.jpg|thumb|A sailor assigned to Naval Computer Telecommunications Station (NCTS) [[Guam]], [[fingerprint]]s Alexis Kosak during the 11th annual Project KidCare event held at [[Agana Shopping Center]]. The project's goal is to assist local authorities with locating and recovering missing children and inform the public about ways to prevent child abduction.]]\n\nIn the report, UNICEF also warns that there is a dramatic absence of harmonized and systematic data collection, analysis and dissemination at all levels without which countries lack important evidence that informs national policies and responses. Missing Children Europe, the European federation for missing children, aims to meet this need. The CRM system is expected to have a clear impact on the way hotlines are able to work together and collect data on the problem of missing children.\n\nThe British Asylum Screening Unit estimated that 60% of the unaccompanied minors accommodated in social care centres in the UK go missing and are not found again. In the UK these open centres, from where minors are able to call their traffickers, act as 'human markets' for the facilitators and traffickers who generally collect their prey within 24 hours of arrival in the UK. According to the CIA out of the 800,000 people trafficked annually across national borders in the world, up to 50% are minors.\n\n===International statistics and efforts===\nThe [[United Nations]] is operating a [[International Commission on Missing Persons|Commission on Missing Persons]] that serves as an international coordination center and provides also statistical material regarding missing persons worldwide. The [[Restoring Family Links|International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] strives to clarify the fate and whereabouts of missing persons when loss of contact is due to armed conflict or other situations of violence; natural or man-made disaster; migration and in other situations of humanitarian need. It is also supporting the families of missing persons to rebuild their social lives and find emotional well-being.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://familylinks.icrc.org/en/Pages/HowWeWork/Missing-Persons-and-their-Families.aspx |title=Restoring Family Links \u2013 Missing Persons and their Families |publisher=Familylinks.icrc.org |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223044829/http://familylinks.icrc.org/en/Pages/HowWeWork/Missing-Persons-and-their-Families.aspx |archivedate=February 23, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Monument ==\nOn May 26, 2002, a monument to missing persons was unveiled in [[County Kilkenny]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] by President [[Mary McAleese]].

{"title_page": "Themes of The Lord of the Rings", "text_new": "{{Italic title prefixed|9}}\nScholars and critics have identified many '''themes of ''The Lord of the Rings''''', a major fantasy novel by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], including a reversed [[quest]], the struggle of [[good and evil]], death and immortality, fate and free will, the danger of power, and various aspects of [[Christianity]] including the presence of three [[Christ]] figures, for prophet, priest, and king, as well as elements such as hope and redemptive suffering. There is also a strong thread throughout the work of language, its sound, and its relationship to peoples and places; and of moralisation from descriptions of landscape. Out of these, Tolkien stated that the central theme is death and immortality. \n\nIn addition, some commentators have criticised Tolkien for supposed failings in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', such as not including significant women, not being relevant to city-dwellers, not overtly showing any religion, and for racism, though others have defended Tolkien against all these charges.\n\n==Reversed quest==\n\n[[File:Galahad grail.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Unlike a typical [[quest]] like seeking the [[Holy Grail]] of [[Arthurian legend]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s is to destroy an object, the [[One Ring]].<ref name=\"West 1975\"/> ''Vision of the Holy Grail'' by [[William Morris]], 1890]]\n\nThe Tolkien critic Richard C. West writes that the story of ''The Lord of the Rings'' is basically simple, the hobbit [[Frodo Baggins]]'s [[quest]] to take the Dark Lord [[Sauron]]'s [[One Ring|Ring]] to [[Mount Doom]] and destroy it. He calls the quest \"primary\", along with the war against Sauron.<ref name=\"West 1975\">{{cite book |last=West |first=Richard C. |editor-last=Lobdell |editor-first=Jared |title=The Interlace Structure of 'The Lord of the Rings' |work=A Tolkien Compass |date=1975 |publisher=Open Court |isbn=978-0875483030 |page=81}}</ref> The critic David M. Miller agrees that the quest is the \"most important narrative device\" in the book, but adds that it is reversed from the conventional structure: the hero is not seeking a treasure, but is hoping to destroy one.{{efn|Other authors such as Michael N. Stanton and Lori M.

He writes that Tolkien had lived through two [[world war]]s, the \"routine [[Bombing|bombardment]]\" of civilians, the use of famine for political gain, [[concentration camp]]s and [[genocide]], and the development and use of [[Chemical weapon|chemical]] and [[nuclear weapons]]. Shippey states that the book raises the question of whether, if the ability of humans to produce that kind of evil could somehow be destroyed, even at the cost of sacrificing something, this would be worth doing.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=369-370}}\n\n==Antitheses==\n\n\"No careful reader of Tolkien's fiction can fail to be aware of the polarities that give it form and fiction,\"<ref name=Flieger>{{cite book|last=Flieger |first=Verlyn |authorlink=Verlyn Flieger |title=Splintered Light: Logos and Language in Tolkien's World | edition=2nd |location=Kent, Ohio |publisher= [[Kent State University Press]] |year= 2002 | page= 2 |isbn=978-0-87338-744-6}}</ref> writes [[Verlyn Flieger]].

Orcs, the most maligned of races, are in one interpretation a corruption of the mystically exalted race of the Elves. [[Minas Morgul]], the Tower of Sorcery, home of the Lord of the [[Nazg\u00fbl]], the most corrupted King of Men, directly opposes [[Minas Tirith]], the Tower of Guard and the capital of [[Gondor]], the last visible remnant of [[N\u00famenor|the ancient kingdom of Men]] in the [[Third Age]]. [[Mordor]], the land of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]], is opposed to Gondor and to all free peoples. These antitheses, though pronounced and prolific, are sometimes seen to be too polarizing, but they have also been argued to be at the heart of the structure of the entire story. Tolkien's technique has been seen to \"confer literality on what would in the primary world be called [[metaphor]] and then to illustrate [in his secondary world] the process by which the literal becomes metaphoric.\"<ref name=\"Flieger\"/> The theologian Fleming Rutledge argues, on the other hand, that Tolkien aims instead to show that no definite line can be drawn between god and evil, because \"'good' people can be and are capable of evil under certain circumstances.\"<ref name=\"Rutledge2004\">{{cite book |last=Rutledge |first=Fleming|title=The Battle for Middle-earth: Tolkien's Divine Design in The Lord of the Rings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FRiViwMylSUC&pg=PA13 |year=2004 |publisher=Wm.

Beyond Gandalf's words, the story is structured in such a way that past decisions have a critical influence on current events. For instance, because Bilbo and Frodo spared Gollum, Gollum was able to destroy the Ring by falling into the [[Cracks of Doom]] while Frodo failed to destroy it. Thus Frodo, who is overpowered by the evil Ring, is saved by what seems to be luck.{{sfn|Solopova|2009|p=49}}\n\nThe role of fate in ''The Lord of the Rings'' is contrasted sharply with the prominent role also given to personal choice and will. Frodo's voluntary choice to bear the Ring to Mordor is central to the plot of the whole story. Also important is Frodo's willing offer of the Ring to Gandalf, Aragorn, and Galadriel, and their willing refusal of it, not to mention Frodo's final inability to summon the will to destroy it. Thus, both will and fate play out throughout the story: from Sam's vision of old Gaffer Gamgee's wheelbarrow and the [[Scouring of the Shire]] in the Mirror of Galadriel, to Arwen Evenstar's choice of mortality.<ref name=\"Understanding The Lord of the Rings\">{{Cite book |author1=Isaacs, Neil David |author2=Zimbardo, Rose A. |title=Understanding The Lord of the Rings: The Best of Tolkien Criticism |year=2005 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |isbn=978-0-618-42253-1 |pages=58\u201364}}</ref> \n\nPeter Kreeft notes that divine providence, in the form of the will of the [[Valar]], expressing the will of [[Eru Il\u00favatar]], can determine fate.

While Sam follows Frodo out of loyalty and would die for him, Boromir is driven by pride in his desire for the Ring, and would risk the lives of others for his personal glory. Likewise the refusal of the ring by Sam, Faramir, and Galadriel is a courageous rejection of power and glory and personal renown.{{sfn|Solopova|2009|p=42}} Courage in the face of overwhelming odds is a recurring theme. Tolkien stated in ''[[The Monsters and the Critics]]'' that he was inspired by the apocalyptic Norse legend of ''[[Ragnar\u00f6k]],'' where the gods know that they are doomed in their final battle for the world, but go to fight anyway. Frodo and Sam share this \"northern courage\", knowing they have little prospect of returning home from their mission to Mount Doom.{{sfn|Solopova|2009|p=28}}\n\n== Danger of power ==\n\n=== Power corrupts ===\n[[File:Picture of John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] famously stated \"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\", an idea embodied in the corrupting power of the [[One Ring]].{{sfn|Shippey|2002|pp=115-116}}]]\n\nA major theme is the corrupting influence of the [[One Ring]] through the power it offers, especially to those already powerful.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perkins |first1=Agnes |last2=Hill |first2=Helen |editor-last=Lobdell |editor-first=Jared |title=The Corruption of Power |work=A Tolkien Compass |date=1975 |publisher=Open Court |isbn=978-0875483030 |pages=57-68}}</ref> [[Tom Shippey]] notes [[Gandalf]]'s statements about the power and influence of the One Ring, and the corrupting influence it has on its bearers. Gandalf rejects the Ring for this reason when [[Frodo Baggins |Frodo]] offers it to him; this view of the Ring is reinforced as [[Elrond]], [[Galadriel]], Aragorn and [[Faramir]] in their turn, also reject it, fearing that it will overpower them also. Inversely, the hobbits' complacency and lack of ambition makes them less susceptible to the Ring's promises of power, as in Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee |Sam]], who are able to handle the Ring for extended periods of time. Hobbits are not totally immune to the Ring's effects, however, as can be seen in the changes it works in Frodo, [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and Gollum.{{sfn|Shippey|2002|pp=112-160}} On the other hand, [[Boromir]] becomes murderously obsessed with the Ring, but never possesses it, while Sm\u00e9agol kills his kin [[D\u00e9agol]], the first Ring bearer after [[Isildur]], to obtain the Ring.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmu9G8oU3oQC&pg=PA63 |title=Reading The Lord of the Rings: New Writings on Tolkien's Classic |last=Roberts |first=Adam |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]] |year=2006 |isbn=9780826484604 |editor-last=Eaglestone |editor-first=Robert |page=63 |chapter=The One Ring}}</ref>\n\nThe corrupting effect of power is, according to Shippey, a modern theme, since in earlier times, power was considered to \"reveal character\", not alter it. Shippey quotes [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]]'s 1887 statement:\n\n{{quote|Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men{{sfn|Shippey|2002|pp=115-116}}}}\n\nShippey points out authors contemporary with Tolkien who dealt in the theme of the corrupting influence of power: George Orwell with ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945), William Golding with ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' (1954), and T. H. White with ''[[The Once and Future King]]'' (1958).{{sfn|Shippey|2002|pp=115-116}} In his view, this was largely a modern idea; a medieval equivalent is the [[Old English]] \"''man de\u00fe swa he by\u00fe \u00feonne he mot swa he wile''\": \"A man does as he is when he can do what he wants\", i.e. power reveals existing character, rather than changing it for the worse.{{sfn|Shippey|2002|pp=115-116}}\n\nShippey's critics have argued that this theme was not created in the 20th century, pointing to the use of the \"ring\" as a symbol of power in much older works such as those of [[Plato]] in the 4th century BCE. In [[The Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']], the character Glaucon argued that doing justice to others is never to one's benefit; he cited the mythical [[Ring of Gyges]], which could make any man who wore it invisible and thus able to get away with theft or other crime. Glaucon claimed that such power would corrupt any man, and that therefore no man truly believes that acting justly toward others is good for him.<ref>{{cite book  |author1=Plato |author1link=Plato |title=The Republic |last2=Jowett |first2=Benjamin |author2-link=Benjamin Jowett |publisher=The Internet Classics Archive |year=2009 |orig-year=360 B.C. |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.3.ii.html}}</ref> \n\n[[Colin Manlove]] criticises Tolkien's attitude towards power as inconsistent, with exceptions to the supposedly overwhelming influence of the Ring. The Ring ''can'' be handed over relatively easily (Sam and Bilbo), and removing the Ring by force (Gollum to Frodo) does not, despite Gandalf's assertion at the beginning of the story, break Frodo's mind. The Ring also appears to have little effect on characters such as Aragorn, [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli (Middle-earth) |Gimli]].<ref name=\"Manlove 1978\">{{cite book |last=Manlove |first=C.

As another example, Boromir atones for his assault on Frodo by single-handedly but vainly defending Merry and Pippin from orcs,<ref name=olar/> which illustrates also another significant Christian theme: [[immortality of the soul]] and the importance of good intention, especially at the point of death. This is clear from Gandalf's statement: \"But he [Boromir] escaped in the end....

He found a resonance with the ancient myth of the \"true language\", \"isomorphic with reality\": in that language, each word names a thing and each thing has a [[true name]], and using that name gives the speaker power over that thing.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=115, 121}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Zimmer |first=Mary |editor-last=Chance | editor-first=Jane |editor-link=Jane Chance | title=Creating and Re-creating Worlds with Words |work=Tolkien and the invention of myth : a reader | publisher=University Press of Kentucky | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-8131-2301-1 |page=53}}</ref> This is seen directly in the character [[Tom Bombadil]], who can name anything, and that name then becomes that thing's name ever after; Shippey notes that this happens with the names he gives to the hobbits' ponies.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=115, 121}}\n\nThis belief, Shippey states, animated Tolkien's insistence on what he considered to be the ancient, traditional, and genuine forms of words. A modern English word like loaf, deriving directly from Old English ''hl\u0101f'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Clark Hall |first=J. R. |authorlink=John Richard Clark Hall |title=A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary |date=2002 |origyear=1894 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |edition=4th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ufdQAQAAMAAJ |page=185}}</ref> has its plural form in 'v', \"loaves\", whereas a newcomer like \"proof\", not from Old English, rightly has its plural the new way, \"proofs\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=63-66}} So, Tolkien reasoned, the proper plurals of \"dwarf\" and \"elf\" must be \"dwarves\" and \"elves\", not as the dictionary and the printers [[typesetting]] ''The Lord of the Rings'' would have them, \"dwarfs\" and elfs\". The same went for forms like \"dwarvish\" and \"elvish\", strong and old, and avoiding any hint of dainty little \"elfin\" [[Fairy|flower-fairies]].{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=63-66}} Tolkien insisted on the expensive reversion of all such typographical \"corrections\" at the [[galley proof]] stage.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=63-66}}\n\n=== From language to story ===\n\n[[File:Linguistic Map of Middle-Earth.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|According to [[Tom Shippey]], Tolkien invented parts of [[Middle-earth]] to resolve the linguistic puzzle he had accidentally created by using different European languages for those of peoples in his legendarium.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=129-133}}]]\n\nTolkien devoted enormous effort to place-names, for example making those in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|The Shire]] such as Nobottle, Bucklebury, and Tuckborough obviously English in sound and by etymology. Shippey comments that even though many of these names do not enter the book's plot, they contribute a feeling of reality and depth, giving \"Middle-earth that air of solidity and extent both in space and time which its successors [in fantasy literature] so conspicuously lack.\"{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=117-118}} Tolkien wrote in one of his letters that his work was \"largely an essay in linguistic aesthetic\".<ref>''[[Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien|Letters]]'', #165, p. 220</ref> \n\nHe made use of several European languages, ancient and modern, including Old English for the language of Rohan and [[Old Norse]] for the names of dwarves (initially in ''[[The Hobbit]]''), and modern English for the Common Speech, creating as the story developed a tricky linguistic puzzle. Among other things, Middle-earth was not modern Europe but that region long ages ago, and the Common Speech was not modern English but Westron. Therefore, the dialogue and names written in modern English were, in the fiction, ''translations'' from the Westron, and the language and placenames of Rohan was similarly supposedly translated from Rohirric into Old English; therefore, too, the dwarf-names written in Old Norse must have been translated from Khuzdul into Old Norse. Thus the linguistic geography of Middle-earth grew from Tolkien's purely philological or linguistic explorations.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=129-133}}\n\n=== Language, peoples, and places ===\n\nIn addition, Tolkien invested a large amount of time and energy creating languages, especially the [[Elvish languages]] of [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]], both of which appear, sometimes untranslated, in ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien had a private theory on the way that the sounds of a language convey a feeling of beauty; he felt pure pleasure in the vocabulary of the [[Gothic language]], and indeed of [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. Shippey explains that \"He thought that people could feel history in words, could recognise language 'styles', could extract sense (of sorts) from sound alone, could moreover make [[aesthetic]] judgements based on [[phonology]].\"{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=129-133}} Thus Tolkien has Legolas say, on hearing Aragorn singing ''[[Lament of the Rohirrim|The Lament of the Rohirrim]]'' in Rohirric (the language of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]]), which Legolas does not understand:{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=129-133}} \n\n{{quote|That, I guess, is the language of the Rohirrim, for it is like to this land itself, rich and rolling in part, and else hard and stern as the mountains. But I cannot guess what it means, save that it is laden with the sadness of Mortal Men.<ref>''[[The Two Towers]]'', \"The King of the Golden Hall\"</ref>}}\n\nShippey states that Tolkien liked to suppose that there really was such a strong connection between things, people, and language, \"especially if the person who spoke the language lived on the thing.\"{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=129-133}} He notes that the effect of language appears again and again in ''The Lord of the Rings'', such as when the hobbits hear the Elf [[Gildor]] singing and find that the blended sound and melody \"seemed to shape itself in their thought\";<ref>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"Three is Company\"</ref> when everyone at the [[Council of Elrond]] quails at the sound of Gandalf's voicing the [[Black Speech]] in [[Rivendell]];<ref>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"The Council of Elrond\"</ref> or when [[Sam Gamgee]] responds \"I like that!\" when the dwarf [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] sings about the dwarf-King Durin long ago.<ref>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"A Journey in the Dark\"</ref>\n\n== Moralisation from landscape ==\n\nTolkien describes the landscapes of Middle-earth realistically, but at the same time uses descriptions of land and weather to convey feelings and a sense of something beyond the here and now. Shippey states that \"both characters and readers become aware of the extent and nature of Tolkien's moralisations from landscape\"{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=245-246}} in the many passages where he ambiguously writes about landscape, such as Frodo's reflections on the [[Dead Marshes]]:{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=245-246}}\n\n{{quote|They lie in all the pools, pale faces deep deep under the dark water, I saw them: grim faces and evil, and noble faces and sad. Many faces proud and fair, and weeds in their silver hair. But all foul, all rotting, all dead. A fell light is in them.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=245-246}}<ref name=\"Passage of the Marshes\">''[[The Two Towers]]'', \"The Passage of the Marshes\"</ref>}}\n\nShippey writes that Tolkien frequently comes close to what the critic [[John Ruskin]] called the [[pathetic fallacy]], the idea that things in nature can express human emotion and conduct. However, he states, the literary theorist [[Northrop Frye]] more accurately named the function of such passages as hinting at higher [[Literary mode|literary modes]]. In his ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', Frye classified literature as ranging from \"Ironic\" at the lowest, via \"Low Mimetic\" (such as humorous descriptions), \"High Mimetic\" (accurate descriptions), and \"Romantic\" (idealised accounts) to \"Mythic\" as the highest mode; and modern literature is generally at a lower level than literature of past centuries. In Shippey's view, most of ''The Lord of the Rings'' is in Romantic mode, with occasional touches of [[myth]], and moments of high and low mimesis to relieve the mood; and Tolkien's ability to present multiple modes at once is a major reason for his success.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=237-249}}\n\n== Rebutted negative themes ==\n\nThe theologian Ralph Wood notes that three accusations have repeatedly been levelled at ''Lord of the Rings'': that it is a story about men for boys, with no significant women; that it is about a purely rural world with no bearing on modern life in cities; and that there is no point searching for signs of Christianity in it, as it \"contains no formal religion\".<ref name=\"Wood 2003\">{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Ralph C. |title=The Gospel According to Tolkien |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vA-MDa3UyScC&pg=PP1 |year=2003 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |isbn=978-0-664-23466-9 |pages=2-4}}</ref> Other commentators have noted signs of racism in the book, but in the main have acknowledged Tolkien's strongly anti-racist stance as revealed in his letters.<ref name=\"Driskill2011\"/><ref name=\"Rearick 2004\"/>{{sfn|Straubhaar|2004|pp=112-115}}\n\n=== No significant women ===\n[[File:Arwen by Anna Kulisz.jpg|thumb|upright|Some commentators have accused Tolkien of placing women only in background roles while the male protagonists see all the action.<ref name=\"Wood 2003\"/> [[Arwen]] sewing [[Aragorn]]'s standard, by Anna Kulisz, 2015]]\n\nThe first accusation is that there are no significant female characters. Wood replies that Galadriel, [[\u00c9owyn]], and Arwen are far from being \"plaster figures\": Galadriel is powerful, wise and \"terrible in her beauty\"; \u00c9owyn has \"extraordinary courage and valor\"; and Arwen gives up her Elvish immortality to marry Aragorn. Further, Wood argues, Tolkien insists that everyone, man and woman alike, face the same kinds of temptation, hope, and desire.<ref name=\"Wood 2003\"/>\n\n=== No relevance to city-dwellers ===\n\nThe next accusation is that with its emphasis on rustic hobbits and wild places, the book has no relevance to city life. Wood's reply is that while The Shire is held up as an example, life in Hobbiton is not idealized: there are greedy relatives, \"rivalries and factions\" just as there are in real life.<ref name=\"Wood 2003\"/>\n\n=== No overt Christianity ===\n{{further|The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen#Missing religion}}\n\nThe last accusation noted by Wood is that the work contains no formal religion. Hobbits have no temples or sacrifices, though Frodo can call to [[Elbereth]], one of the [[Valar]], ''[[wikt:in extremis|in extremis]]''; the nearest anyone comes to religion is that the men of Gondor \"pause before meals\". Wood's answer here is that Tolkien intentionally left religion out of Middle-earth so that \"we might see Christianity reflected in it more clearly if also indirectly\".<ref name=\"Wood 2003\"/> He quotes Tolkien's remark in a letter that \"The religious element is absorbed into the story and the symbolism\".<ref name=\"Wood 2003\"/><ref>[[Letters of J.

She notes that the \"recurring accusations in the popular media\" of a racist view of the story are \"interesting\". She quotes the Swedish cultural studies scholar David Tjeder who described Gollum's account of the men of [[Harad]] (\"Not nice; very cruel wicked Men they look. Almost as bad as [[Orc]]s, and much bigger.\"<ref>''[[Lord of the Rings]]'', book 4, chapter 3.</ref>) in ''[[Aftonbladet]]''<!--series of articles in 2001 and 2002--> as \"stereotypical and reflective of colonial attitudes\".{{sfn|Straubhaar|2004|p=113}} She argues instead that Gollum's view, with its \"arbitrary and stereotypical assumptions about the 'Other'\",{{sfn|Straubhaar|2004|p=113}} is absurd, and that Gollum cannot be taken as an authority on Tolkien's opinion. Straubhaar contrasts this with [[Sam Gamgee]]'s more humane response to the sight of a dead Harad warrior, which she finds \"harder to find fault with\": \"He was glad that he could not see the dead face. He wondered what the man's name was and where he came from; and if he was really evil of heart, or what lies or threats had led him on the long march from his home.\"<ref>''[[Lord of the Rings]]'', book 4, chapter 4.</ref>{{sfn|Straubhaar|2004|p=113}} Straubhaar quotes the [[English studies|English]] scholar Stephen Shapiro, who wrote in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' that \"Put simply, Tolkien's good guys are white and the bad guys are black, slant-eyed, unattractive, inarticulate, and a psychologically undeveloped horde\".{{sfn|Straubhaar|2004|p=114}}<ref name=\"Shapiro 2002\">{{cite news |last1=Shapiro |first1=Stephen |title=Lord of the Rings labelled racist |work=[[The Scotsman]] |url=https://www.scotsman.com/arts-and-culture/film-and-tv/lord-of-the-rings-labelled-racist-1-632928 |date=14 December 2002}}</ref> Straubhaar concedes that Shapiro may have had a point with \"slant-eyed\", but comments that this was milder than that of many of his contemporary novelists such as [[John Buchan]], and notes that Tolkien had in fact made \"appalled objection\" when people had misapplied his story to current events.{{sfn|Straubhaar|2004|p=114}} She similarly observes that Tjeder had failed to notice Tolkien's \"concerted effort\" to change the Western European \"paradigm\" that speakers of supposedly superior languages were \"ethnically superior\".{{sfn|Straubhaar|2004|p=115}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[J.

R. R. Tolkien]], including a reversed [[quest]], the struggle of [[good and evil]], death and immortality, fate and free will, the danger of power, and various aspects of [[Christianity]] including the presence of three [[Christ]] figures, for prophet, priest, and king, as well as elements such as hope and redemptive suffering. There is also a strong thread throughout the work of language, its sound, and its relationship to peoples and places; and of moralisation from descriptions of landscape. Out of these, Tolkien stated that the central theme is death and immortality. \n\nIn addition, some commentators have criticised Tolkien for supposed failings in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', such as not including significant women, not being relevant to city-dwellers, not overtly showing any religion, and for racism, though others have defended Tolkien against all these charges.\n\n==Reversed quest==\n\n[[File:Galahad grail.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Unlike a typical [[quest]] like seeking the [[Holy Grail]] of [[Arthurian legend]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s is to destroy an object, the [[One Ring]].<ref name=\"West 1975\"/> ''Vision of the Holy Grail'' by [[William Morris]], 1890]]\n\nThe Tolkien critic Richard C.

He writes that Tolkien had lived through two [[world war]]s, the \"routine [[Bombing|bombardment]]\" of civilians, the use of famine for political gain, [[concentration camp]]s and [[genocide]], and the development and use of [[Chemical weapon|chemical]] and [[nuclear weapons]]. Shippey states that the book raises the question of whether, if the ability of humans to produce that kind of evil could somehow be destroyed, even at the cost of sacrificing something, this would be worth doing.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=369-370}}\n\n==Antitheses==\n\n\"No careful reader of Tolkien's fiction can fail to be aware of the polarities that give it form and fiction,\"<ref name=Flieger>{{cite book|last=Flieger |first=Verlyn |authorlink=Verlyn Flieger |title=Splintered Light: Logos and Language in Tolkien's World | edition=2nd |location=Kent, Ohio |publisher= [[Kent State University Press]] |year= 2002 | page= 2 |isbn=978-0-87338-744-6}}</ref> writes [[Verlyn Flieger]].

Orcs, the most maligned of races, are in one interpretation a corruption of the mystically exalted race of the Elves. [[Minas Morgul]], the Tower of Sorcery, home of the Lord of the [[Nazg\u00fbl]], the most corrupted King of Men, directly opposes [[Minas Tirith]], the Tower of Guard and the capital of [[Gondor]], the last visible remnant of [[N\u00famenor|the ancient kingdom of Men]] in the [[Third Age]]. [[Mordor]], the land of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]], is opposed to Gondor and to all free peoples. These antitheses, though pronounced and prolific, are sometimes seen to be too polarizing, but they have also been argued to be at the heart of the structure of the entire story. Tolkien's technique has been seen to \"confer literality on what would in the primary world be called [[metaphor]] and then to illustrate [in his secondary world] the process by which the literal becomes metaphoric.\"<ref name=\"Flieger\"/> The theologian Fleming Rutledge argues, on the other hand, that Tolkien aims instead to show that no definite line can be drawn between god and evil, because \"'good' people can be and are capable of evil under certain circumstances.\"<ref name=\"Rutledge2004\">{{cite book |last=Rutledge |first=Fleming|title=The Battle for Middle-earth: Tolkien's Divine Design in The Lord of the Rings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FRiViwMylSUC&pg=PA13 |year=2004 |publisher=Wm.

Beyond Gandalf's words, the story is structured in such a way that past decisions have a critical influence on current events. For instance, because Bilbo and Frodo spared Gollum, Gollum was able to destroy the Ring by falling into the [[Cracks of Doom]] while Frodo failed to destroy it. Thus Frodo, who is overpowered by the evil Ring, is saved by what seems to be luck.{{sfn|Solopova|2009|p=49}}\n\nThe role of fate in ''The Lord of the Rings'' is contrasted sharply with the prominent role also given to personal choice and will. Frodo's voluntary choice to bear the Ring to Mordor is central to the plot of the whole story. Also important is Frodo's willing offer of the Ring to Gandalf, Aragorn, and Galadriel, and their willing refusal of it, not to mention Frodo's final inability to summon the will to destroy it. Thus, both will and fate play out throughout the story: from Sam's vision of old Gaffer Gamgee's wheelbarrow and the [[Scouring of the Shire]] in the Mirror of Galadriel, to Arwen Evenstar's choice of mortality.<ref name=\"Understanding The Lord of the Rings\">{{Cite book |author1=Isaacs, Neil David |author2=Zimbardo, Rose A. |title=Understanding The Lord of the Rings: The Best of Tolkien Criticism |year=2005 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |isbn=978-0-618-42253-1 |pages=58\u201364}}</ref> \n\nPeter Kreeft notes that divine providence, in the form of the will of the [[Valar]], expressing the will of [[Eru Il\u00favatar]], can determine fate.

While Sam follows Frodo out of loyalty and would die for him, Boromir is driven by pride in his desire for the Ring, and would risk the lives of others for his personal glory. Likewise the refusal of the ring by Sam, Faramir, and Galadriel is a courageous rejection of power and glory and personal renown.{{sfn|Solopova|2009|p=42}} Courage in the face of overwhelming odds is a recurring theme. Tolkien stated in ''[[The Monsters and the Critics]]'' that he was inspired by the apocalyptic Norse legend of ''[[Ragnar\u00f6k]],'' where the gods know that they are doomed in their final battle for the world, but go to fight anyway. Frodo and Sam share this \"northern courage\", knowing they have little prospect of returning home from their mission to Mount Doom.{{sfn|Solopova|2009|p=28}}\n\n== Danger of power ==\n\n=== Power corrupts ===\n[[File:Picture of John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] famously stated \"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\", an idea embodied in the corrupting power of the [[One Ring]].{{sfn|Shippey|2002|pp=115-116}}]]\n\nA major theme is the corrupting influence of the [[One Ring]] through the power it offers, especially to those already powerful.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perkins |first1=Agnes |last2=Hill |first2=Helen |editor-last=Lobdell |editor-first=Jared |title=The Corruption of Power |work=A Tolkien Compass |date=1975 |publisher=Open Court |isbn=978-0875483030 |pages=57-68}}</ref> [[Tom Shippey]] notes [[Gandalf]]'s statements about the power and influence of the One Ring, and the corrupting influence it has on its bearers. Gandalf rejects the Ring for this reason when [[Frodo Baggins |Frodo]] offers it to him; this view of the Ring is reinforced as [[Elrond]], [[Galadriel]], Aragorn and [[Faramir]] in their turn, also reject it, fearing that it will overpower them also. Inversely, the hobbits' complacency and lack of ambition makes them less susceptible to the Ring's promises of power, as in Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee |Sam]], who are able to handle the Ring for extended periods of time. Hobbits are not totally immune to the Ring's effects, however, as can be seen in the changes it works in Frodo, [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and Gollum.{{sfn|Shippey|2002|pp=112-160}} On the other hand, [[Boromir]] becomes murderously obsessed with the Ring, but never possesses it, while Sm\u00e9agol kills his kin [[D\u00e9agol]], the first Ring bearer after [[Isildur]], to obtain the Ring.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmu9G8oU3oQC&pg=PA63 |title=Reading The Lord of the Rings: New Writings on Tolkien's Classic |last=Roberts |first=Adam |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]] |year=2006 |isbn=9780826484604 |editor-last=Eaglestone |editor-first=Robert |page=63 |chapter=The One Ring}}</ref>\n\nThe corrupting effect of power is, according to Shippey, a modern theme, since in earlier times, power was considered to \"reveal character\", not alter it. Shippey quotes [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]]'s 1887 statement:\n\n{{quote|Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men{{sfn|Shippey|2002|pp=115-116}}}}\n\nShippey points out authors contemporary with Tolkien who dealt in the theme of the corrupting influence of power: George Orwell with ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945), William Golding with ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' (1954), and T. H. White with ''[[The Once and Future King]]'' (1958).{{sfn|Shippey|2002|pp=115-116}} In his view, this was largely a modern idea; a medieval equivalent is the [[Old English]] \"''man de\u00fe swa he by\u00fe \u00feonne he mot swa he wile''\": \"A man does as he is when he can do what he wants\", i.e. power reveals existing character, rather than changing it for the worse.{{sfn|Shippey|2002|pp=115-116}}\n\nShippey's critics have argued that this theme was not created in the 20th century, pointing to the use of the \"ring\" as a symbol of power in much older works such as those of [[Plato]] in the 4th century BCE. In [[The Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']], the character Glaucon argued that doing justice to others is never to one's benefit; he cited the mythical [[Ring of Gyges]], which could make any man who wore it invisible and thus able to get away with theft or other crime. Glaucon claimed that such power would corrupt any man, and that therefore no man truly believes that acting justly toward others is good for him.<ref>{{cite book  |author1=Plato |author1link=Plato |title=The Republic |last2=Jowett |first2=Benjamin |author2-link=Benjamin Jowett |publisher=The Internet Classics Archive |year=2009 |orig-year=360 B.C. |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.3.ii.html}}</ref> \n\n[[Colin Manlove]] criticises Tolkien's attitude towards power as inconsistent, with exceptions to the supposedly overwhelming influence of the Ring. The Ring ''can'' be handed over relatively easily (Sam and Bilbo), and removing the Ring by force (Gollum to Frodo) does not, despite Gandalf's assertion at the beginning of the story, break Frodo's mind. The Ring also appears to have little effect on characters such as Aragorn, [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli (Middle-earth) |Gimli]].<ref name=\"Manlove 1978\">{{cite book |last=Manlove |first=C.

He found a resonance with the ancient myth of the \"true language\", \"isomorphic with reality\": in that language, each word names a thing and each thing has a [[true name]], and using that name gives the speaker power over that thing.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=115, 121}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Zimmer |first=Mary |editor-last=Chance | editor-first=Jane |editor-link=Jane Chance | title=Creating and Re-creating Worlds with Words |work=Tolkien and the invention of myth : a reader | publisher=University Press of Kentucky | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-8131-2301-1 |page=53}}</ref> This is seen directly in the character [[Tom Bombadil]], who can name anything, and that name then becomes that thing's name ever after; Shippey notes that this happens with the names he gives to the hobbits' ponies.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=115, 121}}\n\nThis belief, Shippey states, animated Tolkien's insistence on what he considered to be the ancient, traditional, and genuine forms of words. A modern English word like loaf, deriving directly from Old English ''hl\u0101f'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Clark Hall |first=J. R. |authorlink=John Richard Clark Hall |title=A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary |date=2002 |origyear=1894 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |edition=4th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ufdQAQAAMAAJ |page=185}}</ref> has its plural form in 'v', \"loaves\", whereas a newcomer like \"proof\", not from Old English, rightly has its plural the new way, \"proofs\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=63-66}} So, Tolkien reasoned, the proper plurals of \"dwarf\" and \"elf\" must be \"dwarves\" and \"elves\", not as the dictionary and the printers [[typesetting]] ''The Lord of the Rings'' would have them, \"dwarfs\" and elfs\". The same went for forms like \"dwarvish\" and \"elvish\", strong and old, and avoiding any hint of dainty little \"elfin\" [[Fairy|flower-fairies]].{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=63-66}} Tolkien insisted on the expensive reversion of all such typographical \"corrections\" at the [[galley proof]] stage.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=63-66}}\n\n=== From language to story ===\n\n[[File:Linguistic Map of Middle-Earth.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|According to [[Tom Shippey]], Tolkien invented parts of [[Middle-earth]] to resolve the linguistic puzzle he had accidentally created by using different European languages for those of peoples in his legendarium.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=129-133}}]]\n\nTolkien devoted enormous effort to place-names, for example making those in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|The Shire]] such as Nobottle, Bucklebury, and Tuckborough obviously English in sound and by etymology. Shippey comments that even though many of these names do not enter the book's plot, they contribute a feeling of reality and depth, giving \"Middle-earth that air of solidity and extent both in space and time which its successors [in fantasy literature] so conspicuously lack.\"{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=117-118}} Tolkien wrote in one of his letters that his work was \"largely an essay in linguistic aesthetic\".<ref>''[[Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien|Letters]]'', #165, p. 220</ref> \n\nHe made use of several European languages, ancient and modern, including Old English for the language of Rohan and [[Old Norse]] for the names of dwarves (initially in ''[[The Hobbit]]''), and modern English for the Common Speech, creating as the story developed a tricky linguistic puzzle. Among other things, Middle-earth was not modern Europe but that region long ages ago, and the Common Speech was not modern English but Westron. Therefore, the dialogue and names written in modern English were, in the fiction, ''translations'' from the Westron, and the language and placenames of Rohan was similarly supposedly translated from Rohirric into Old English; therefore, too, the dwarf-names written in Old Norse must have been translated from Khuzdul into Old Norse. Thus the linguistic geography of Middle-earth grew from Tolkien's purely philological or linguistic explorations.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=129-133}}\n\n=== Language, peoples, and places ===\n\nIn addition, Tolkien invested a large amount of time and energy creating languages, especially the [[Elvish languages]] of [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]], both of which appear, sometimes untranslated, in ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien had a private theory on the way that the sounds of a language convey a feeling of beauty; he felt pure pleasure in the vocabulary of the [[Gothic language]], and indeed of [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. Shippey explains that \"He thought that people could feel history in words, could recognise language 'styles', could extract sense (of sorts) from sound alone, could moreover make [[aesthetic]] judgements based on [[phonology]].\"{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=129-133}} Thus Tolkien has Legolas say, on hearing Aragorn singing ''[[Lament of the Rohirrim|The Lament of the Rohirrim]]'' in Rohirric (the language of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]]), which Legolas does not understand:{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=129-133}} \n\n{{quote|That, I guess, is the language of the Rohirrim, for it is like to this land itself, rich and rolling in part, and else hard and stern as the mountains. But I cannot guess what it means, save that it is laden with the sadness of Mortal Men.<ref>''[[The Two Towers]]'', \"The King of the Golden Hall\"</ref>}}\n\nShippey states that Tolkien liked to suppose that there really was such a strong connection between things, people, and language, \"especially if the person who spoke the language lived on the thing.\"{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=129-133}} He notes that the effect of language appears again and again in ''The Lord of the Rings'', such as when the hobbits hear the Elf [[Gildor]] singing and find that the blended sound and melody \"seemed to shape itself in their thought\";<ref>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"Three is Company\"</ref> when everyone at the [[Council of Elrond]] quails at the sound of Gandalf's voicing the [[Black Speech]] in [[Rivendell]];<ref>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"The Council of Elrond\"</ref> or when [[Sam Gamgee]] responds \"I like that!\" when the dwarf [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] sings about the dwarf-King Durin long ago.<ref>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"A Journey in the Dark\"</ref>\n\n== Moralisation from landscape ==\n\nTolkien describes the landscapes of Middle-earth realistically, but at the same time uses descriptions of land and weather to convey feelings and a sense of something beyond the here and now. Shippey states that \"both characters and readers become aware of the extent and nature of Tolkien's moralisations from landscape\"{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=245-246}} in the many passages where he ambiguously writes about landscape, such as Frodo's reflections on the [[Dead Marshes]]:{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=245-246}}\n\n{{quote|They lie in all the pools, pale faces deep deep under the dark water, I saw them: grim faces and evil, and noble faces and sad. Many faces proud and fair, and weeds in their silver hair. But all foul, all rotting, all dead. A fell light is in them.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=245-246}}<ref name=\"Passage of the Marshes\">''[[The Two Towers]]'', \"The Passage of the Marshes\"</ref>}}\n\nShippey writes that Tolkien frequently comes close to what the critic [[John Ruskin]] called the [[pathetic fallacy]], the idea that things in nature can express human emotion and conduct. However, he states, the literary theorist [[Northrop Frye]] more accurately named the function of such passages as hinting at higher [[Literary mode|literary modes]]. In his ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', Frye classified literature as ranging from \"Ironic\" at the lowest, via \"Low Mimetic\" (such as humorous descriptions), \"High Mimetic\" (accurate descriptions), and \"Romantic\" (idealised accounts) to \"Mythic\" as the highest mode; and modern literature is generally at a lower level than literature of past centuries. In Shippey's view, most of ''The Lord of the Rings'' is in Romantic mode, with occasional touches of [[myth]], and moments of high and low mimesis to relieve the mood; and Tolkien's ability to present multiple modes at once is a major reason for his success.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=237-249}}\n\n== Rebutted negative themes ==\n\nThe theologian Ralph Wood notes that three accusations have repeatedly been levelled at ''Lord of the Rings'': that it is a story about men for boys, with no significant women; that it is about a purely rural world with no bearing on modern life in cities; and that there is no point searching for signs of Christianity in it, as it \"contains no formal religion\".<ref name=\"Wood 2003\">{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Ralph C. |title=The Gospel According to Tolkien |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vA-MDa3UyScC&pg=PP1 |year=2003 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |isbn=978-0-664-23466-9 |pages=2-4}}</ref> Other commentators have noted signs of racism in the book, but in the main have acknowledged Tolkien's strongly anti-racist stance as revealed in his letters.<ref name=\"Driskill2011\"/><ref name=\"Rearick 2004\"/>{{sfn|Straubhaar|2004|pp=112-115}}\n\n=== No significant women ===\n[[File:Arwen by Anna Kulisz.jpg|thumb|upright|Some commentators have accused Tolkien of placing women only in background roles while the male protagonists see all the action.<ref name=\"Wood 2003\"/> [[Arwen]] sewing [[Aragorn]]'s standard, by Anna Kulisz, 2015]]\n\nThe first accusation is that there are no significant female characters. Wood replies that Galadriel, [[\u00c9owyn]], and Arwen are far from being \"plaster figures\": Galadriel is powerful, wise and \"terrible in her beauty\"; \u00c9owyn has \"extraordinary courage and valor\"; and Arwen gives up her Elvish immortality to marry Aragorn. Further, Wood argues, Tolkien insists that everyone, man and woman alike, face the same kinds of temptation, hope, and desire.<ref name=\"Wood 2003\"/>\n\n=== No relevance to city-dwellers ===\n\nThe next accusation is that with its emphasis on rustic hobbits and wild places, the book has no relevance to city life. Wood's reply is that while The Shire is held up as an example, life in Hobbiton is not idealized: there are greedy relatives, \"rivalries and factions\" just as there are in real life.<ref name=\"Wood 2003\"/>\n\n=== No overt Christianity ===\n{{further|The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen#Missing religion}}\n\nThe last accusation noted by Wood is that the work contains no formal religion. Hobbits have no temples or sacrifices, though Frodo can call to [[Elbereth]], one of the [[Valar]], ''[[wikt:in extremis|in extremis]]''; the nearest anyone comes to religion is that the men of Gondor \"pause before meals\". Wood's answer here is that Tolkien intentionally left religion out of Middle-earth so that \"we might see Christianity reflected in it more clearly if also indirectly\".<ref name=\"Wood 2003\"/> He quotes Tolkien's remark in a letter that \"The religious element is absorbed into the story and the symbolism\".<ref name=\"Wood 2003\"/><ref>[[Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien|Letters]], to Robert Murray S.J., #142, p. 172</ref>\n\n=== Supposed racism ===\n{{further|Orc#Alleged racism}}\n\nTolkien has frequently been accused of racism, but the [[Indigenous studies]] scholar Lisa Tatonetti writes that even though \"his textual imagery often aligns with racialized ideologies\", Tolkien was sharply anti-racist in the [[Second World War]].<ref name=\"Driskill2011\">{{cite book |last=Tatonetti |first=Lisa |chapter= Indingenous fantasies and sovereign erotics: Outland Cherokees write two-spirit nations|editor=Driskill, Qwo-Li |title=Queer Indigenous Studies: Critical Interventions in Theory, Politics, and Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GfjOuqTuaXEC&pg=PA170 |year=2011 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |isbn=978-0-8165-2907-0 |page=170}}</ref><ref name=\"Rearick 2004\">{{cite journal |last1=Rearick |first1=Anderson |title=Why is the Only Good Orc a Dead Orc?

She notes that the \"recurring accusations in the popular media\" of a racist view of the story are \"interesting\". She quotes the Swedish cultural studies scholar David Tjeder who described Gollum's account of the men of [[Harad]] (\"Not nice; very cruel wicked Men they look. Almost as bad as [[Orc]]s, and much bigger.\"<ref>''[[Lord of the Rings]]'', book 4, chapter 3.</ref>) in ''[[Aftonbladet]]''<!--series of articles in 2001 and 2002--> as \"stereotypical and reflective of colonial attitudes\".{{sfn|Straubhaar|2004|p=113}} She argues instead that Gollum's view, with its \"arbitrary and stereotypical assumptions about the 'Other'\",{{sfn|Straubhaar|2004|p=113}} is absurd, and that Gollum cannot be taken as an authority on Tolkien's opinion. Straubhaar contrasts this with [[Sam Gamgee]]'s more humane response to the sight of a dead Harad warrior, which she finds \"harder to find fault with\": \"He was glad that he could not see the dead face. He wondered what the man's name was and where he came from; and if he was really evil of heart, or what lies or threats had led him on the long march from his home.\"<ref>''[[Lord of the Rings]]'', book 4, chapter 4.</ref>{{sfn|Straubhaar|2004|p=113}} Straubhaar quotes the [[English studies|English]] scholar Stephen Shapiro, who wrote in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' that \"Put simply, Tolkien's good guys are white and the bad guys are black, slant-eyed, unattractive, inarticulate, and a psychologically undeveloped horde\".{{sfn|Straubhaar|2004|p=114}}<ref name=\"Shapiro 2002\">{{cite news |last1=Shapiro |first1=Stephen |title=Lord of the Rings labelled racist |work=[[The Scotsman]] |url=https://www.scotsman.com/arts-and-culture/film-and-tv/lord-of-the-rings-labelled-racist-1-632928 |date=14 December 2002}}</ref> Straubhaar concedes that Shapiro may have had a point with \"slant-eyed\", but comments that this was milder than that of many of his contemporary novelists such as [[John Buchan]], and notes that Tolkien had in fact made \"appalled objection\" when people had misapplied his story to current events.{{sfn|Straubhaar|2004|p=114}} She similarly observes that Tjeder had failed to notice Tolkien's \"concerted effort\" to change the Western European \"paradigm\" that speakers of supposedly superior languages were \"ethnically superior\".{{sfn|Straubhaar|2004|p=115}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[J.
