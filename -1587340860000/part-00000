Due to his reputation, in 1904 he was given funding to construct a small chapel on Mount-Royal across from [[Coll\u00e8ge Notre-Dame du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur|Notre Dame College]]<ref name=\"Pound2005\">{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref>  to operate out of. The small, [[Gothic Revival Architecture|Gothic Revival]] style chapel expanded four times over the next decade with the growing of Brother Andr\u00e9's fame and the Congregation decided to fulfill his request to build a [[basilica]] in his patron saint, [[Saint Joseph]]'s honor. The original chapel, measuring 4.5 meters by 5.5 meters still stands today, though it has since been relocated about a hundred meters away to make room for the massive basilica that stands today.\n[[File:Saint Andr\u00e9 Bessette.jpg|thumb||left|[[Andr\u00e9 Bessette]], [[Congregation of Holy Cross|C.S.C.]], commonly known as Brother Andr\u00e9.]]\nThe first phase of the basilica\u2019s construction involved architects Dalb\u00e9 Viau (1881- 1938) and Alphonse Venne (1875-1934) who had previously done work for the Congregation. From 1914 to 1916, Viau and Venne constructed the crypt church, with seating for 1000, which still stands today and forms the base of the basilica where the massive collection of stairs ends. Between 1924 and 1927, the crypt and building up until the roof were completed in the [[Renaissance Revival Architecture|Renaissance Revival]] style. Viau and Venne had wanted the dome of the Oratory to resemble that of [[St. Peter\u2019s Basilica]] in Rome and to be smaller than it actually is today, however they never had the chance to see those plans through as construction was halted with [[The Great Depression in Canada|the Great Depression]].\n\n===After the Great Depression===\nIn 1937, Dom [[Paul Bellot]] (1876-1944), born in France, was hired to work after the death of Venne, however he was required to work through Canadian [[Lucien Parent]] (1893-1956) due to not being a registered architect in Quebec.<ref>{{cite book |title='\"L'oratoire Saint-Joseph\" Montreal: son histoire, son architecture, vol.2, pp.235-244'|last=Pinard |first=Guy |publisher=Les Editions La Presse |year=1988}}</ref> He redesigned Viau and Venne's roof and dome entirely, making the dome significantly larger and modelling it to resemble the dome of [[Florence Cathedral]]. The construction of his large Oratory dome lasted four years and was completed in 1941 after involving thousands of workers.\n[[File:Architecture. St-Joseph Shrine BAnQ P48S1P01110.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of the dome in 1937.]]\nFrom 1949\u20131951, architect Gilbert Moreau carried out alterations and improvements to the interior of Saint Joseph's Oratory, as well as to the adjacent monastery, and rearranged the sacristy in the basilica.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1866 | title=Moreau, Gilbert in Biographical Dictionary of Architects in Canada 1800\u20131950 |accessdate=November 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe basilica is dedicated to Saint Joseph, to whom Brother Andr\u00e9 credited all his reported miracles. These were mostly related to some kind of healing power, and many pilgrims (handicapped, blind, ill, etc.) poured into his Basilica, including numerous non-Catholics. On display in the basilica is a wall covered with thousands of crutches from those who came to the basilica and were purportedly healed. [[Pope John Paul II]] deemed the miracles to be authentic and [[beatification|beatified]] Brother Andr\u00e9 in 1982. In October 2010 [[Pope Benedict XVI]] canonized the saint.\n\nComposer [[\u00c9milien Allard]] was the church's [[carillonneur]] from 1955 to 1975. For [[RCA Victor]] he released the [[LP album]] ''Carols at the Carillon of Saint Joseph's Oratory'' for which he wrote the arrangements.<ref name=\"mort\">\"La vie et la mort d'un carillonneur\", ''Musique p\u00e9riodique'', vol 1, Jan\u2013Feb 1977</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nOn October 19, 2004, the Oratory held its centennial. All the bells of all the churches on the island of Montreal were supposed to ring at 9:00&nbsp;a.m., though not all churches participated. At 9:05&nbsp;a.m., the basilica rang its bell in response and celebration. [[File:Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount-Royal 8130.jpg|thumb|right|The Oratory's bells were rung in October 2004, to commemorate the centennial of the building's construction.]] On April 2, again to commemorate the Oratory's centennial, Canada Post issued 'Saint Joseph's Oratory, Quebec' in the 2004 Tourist Attractions series.

The image moved to the new modern basilica and was recrowned on 9 August 1955 via Cardinal [[Paul-\u00c9mile L\u00e9ger]] now located within its oil chapel department.\n\n==Architecture and structure==\n[[File:Montreal_StJoseph1_tango7174.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the crypt church, showing the barrel vaulting of its ceiling.]]\n[[File:Saint Joseph's Oratory Basilica Interior.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of the basilica, with its bright colours, stained glass and iconic multi-angled arches.]]\n[[File:St. Joseph's Oratory interior dome.jpg|thumb|right|The dome, as seen from the interior of the basilica.]]\nWhen the basilica\u2019s construction began in 1914, many architects were challenging the conventional [[Beaux-Arts style]] and [[neoclassicism (architecture)|neoclassicism]]. This period was exactly around the time where [[expressionist architecture]], [[constructivist architecture]], [[Bauhaus]] ideas and many other facets of modern architecture began to take off, with pioneers like [[Le Corbusier]] in Europe and [[Frank Lloyd Wright ]]in the United States refusing to be categorized by traditional architectural styles. It was certainly atypical for monumental classical church buildings to be constructed in cities around this time, yet Saint Joseph's Oratory was one of the largest buildings in Montreal when it was constructed, and was designed in [[Renaissance Revival]] exterior with an [[Art Deco]] interior. The basilica, as it stands today, comprises many parts, including the ''Crypt Church'', located underneath the basilica, the ''Votive Chapel'', between the Crypt and the rock of Mount-Royal, the ''Shrine'', which encompasses the [[nave]], [[apse]] and [[transept]], and the ''dome'', which is the largest church dome in Canada and the third largest in the world.\n\n===Crypt Church===\nThe Crypt Church, originally designed by Viau and Venne, measures {{cvt|63.39 by 36.5 by 13.1|m}}, has a seating capacity of 1000 people and is designed in a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style. The ceiling is supported using the [[barrel vault|barrel vaulting]] of steel-[[reinforced concrete]] arches. The church is called a \"crypt\" due to its flattened arches as well as its position embedded into the mountain underneath the basilica.<ref name=\"Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix\">{{cite web |url=http://www.saint-joseph.org/en/ |title=\"Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal.\" L'Oratoire Saint-Joseph Du Mont-Royal |publisher=Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix |accessdate=2 January 2020}}</ref> There is a statue of Joseph made out of [[Carrara marble]] behind the main altar of the Crypt Church, added in 1917 by the Italian artist A. Giacomini. Eight stained glass windows depicting the stages in [[Saint Joseph]]'s life were installed in the crypt in 1919 by the Montreal firm Perdriau et O'Shea.\n\n===Votive Chapel===\nAdded between 1946-1949 between the Crypt Church and the rock of Mount Royal, the Votive Chapel is designed in Art Deco style from the plans of [[Lucien Parent]], and relies on heavy use of geometric forms (square columns, square paneling on ceiling). The Chapel measures {{cvt|31.69 by 15.2 by 27.43|m}} and contains approximately 10,000 candles, with the central lampstand in front of the statue of Saint Joseph holding approximately 3500 votive candles. The chapel, also referred to as \"the Chapel of Ex-votos,\" has nearly 1000 [[Ex-voto|Ex-votos]] (canes, crutches, etc.) suspended within it, left behind by [[pilgrims]] during the life of Brother Andr\u00e9. The Chapel also contains eight [[bas-reliefs]] designed by Canadian sculptor, Joseph Guardo in 1948, which illustrate eight of the attributes which [[Christianity]] has accorded to Saint Joseph. The tomb of Saint Andr\u00e9, sculpted in [[black marble]], rests in an alcove in the middle of the Votive Chapel.<ref name=\"Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix\" />\n\n===Shrine===\nThe interior of the basilica, known as the Shrine, was designed using concepts by Dom Bellot as well as Canadian architect G\u00e9rard Notebaert, and uses a Latin cross layout with a dome at the crossing. The interior has an overall length of {{cvt|105|m}}. The nave, which contains [[pews]] to seat 2028 people (with a maximum capacity of 10,000 people), measures {{cvt|37|m}} in width, while the transept measures {{convert|65|m}} and connects to the shrine of Brother Andr\u00e9. The apse, as well as the rest of the interior, is designed in [[Art Deco]] style, which was very popular in Montreal during the 1930s, and contains sculptures, [[bas-reliefs]], mosaics and stained glass of religious imagery. The roof of the basilica is held up using reinforced concrete multi-angle arches iconic of Dom Bellot\u2019s style.\n\nThe exterior of the Oratory is constructed using large blocks of granite from [[Lac M\u00e9gantic]] quarries in Quebec. The [[colonnade]] at the front fa\u00e7ade of the building consists of four {{cvt|18|m}}-tall, {{cvt|1.5|m}}-thick [[Corinthian columns]] which provide the structural support for the [[entablature]] of the front [[portico]]. It is also [[cornice (architecture)|corniced]] and [[ornament (art)|ornamented]]. The staircase which leads from the street to the base of the basilica contain two parallel flights of 283 concrete steps separated by a central flight of 99 wooden steps reserved for pilgrims who wish to climb on their knees.<ref name=\"Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix\" />\n\n===Dome===\nThe dome of Saint Joseph\u2019s Oratory is the largest church dome in Canada and among the largest in the world, and this is a result of Dom Bellot\u2019s very inspired and ambitious designs. His plans for the dome are very similar to those of [[Florence Cathedral]], being of a \u201cdouble shell\u201d design, meaning it consists of two domes, one on the interior and one on the exterior with empty space in between. Like the cathedral in Florence, the outer dome of the Oratory consists of eight [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] laying atop an octagonal [[Tholobate|drum]], with a lantern and cross. The outer dome of the Oratory measures only {{cvt|17.78|cm}} in thickness and the inner dome measures only about {{cvt|12.7|cm}} in thickness, which is approximately 18 times thinner than the dome of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. The concrete shell of the Oratory's dome is so thin in fact that when related to its overall size, it is akin to an eggshell.<ref name=\"Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix\"/> \n\nThe two domes vary immensely span and height, with the outer dome measuring {{cvt|39|m}} in diameter and rising {{cvt|97|m}} from the nave floor and the inner dome measuring {{cvt|26|m}} in diameter and rising {{cvt|60|m}} from the nave floor. There are 16 steel [[buttresses]] along the inner walls of the drums that provide the structural support for the dome. They serve to brace the inner dome against the outer dome, thus making the supporting walls for both domes more rigid.\n\n==Modern developments==\nIn 2018, the architectural firms Atelier TAG and Architecture49 won a competition to renovate the inside of the dome of Saint Joseph's Oratory and its observatory. The project is estimated to cost around $80 million CAD and will also include a complete renovation of the building's museum and the construction of a new welcome centre on Queen Mary road.

Due to his reputation, in 1904 he was given funding to construct a small chapel on Mount-Royal across from [[Coll\u00e8ge Notre-Dame du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur|Notre Dame College]]<ref name=\"Pound2005\">{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref>  to operate out of. The small, [[Gothic Revival Architecture|Gothic Revival]] style chapel expanded four times over the next decade with the growing of Brother Andr\u00e9's fame and the Congregation decided to fulfill his request to build a [[basilica]] in his patron saint, [[Saint Joseph]]'s honor. The original chapel, measuring 4.5 meters by 5.5 meters still stands today, though it has since been relocated about a hundred meters away to make room for the massive basilica that stands today.\n[[File:Saint Andr\u00e9 Bessette.jpg|thumb||left|[[Andr\u00e9 Bessette]], [[Congregation of Holy Cross|C.S.C.]], commonly known as Brother Andr\u00e9.]]\nThe first phase of the basilica\u2019s construction involved architects Dalb\u00e9 Viau (1881- 1938) and Alphonse Venne (1875-1934) who had previously done work for the Congregation. From 1914 to 1916, Viau and Venne constructed the crypt church, with seating for 1000, which still stands today and forms the base of the basilica where the massive collection of stairs ends. Between 1924 and 1927, the crypt and building up until the roof were completed in the [[Renaissance Revival Architecture|Renaissance Revival]] style. Viau and Venne had wanted the dome of the Oratory to resemble that of [[St. Peter\u2019s Basilica]] in Rome and to be smaller than it actually is today, however they never had the chance to see those plans through as construction was halted with [[The Great Depression in Canada|the Great Depression]].\n\n===After the Great Depression===\nIn 1937, Dom [[Paul Bellot]] (1876-1944), born in France, was hired to work after the death of Venne, however he was required to work through Canadian [[Lucien Parent]] (1893-1956) due to not being a registered architect in Quebec.<ref>{{cite book |title='\"L'oratoire Saint-Joseph\" Montreal: son histoire, son architecture, vol.2, pp.235-244'|last=Pinard |first=Guy |publisher=Les Editions La Presse |year=1988}}</ref> He redesigned Viau and Venne's roof and dome entirely, making the dome significantly larger and modelling it to resemble the dome of [[Florence Cathedral]]. The construction of his large Oratory dome lasted four years and was completed in 1941 after involving thousands of workers.\n[[File:Architecture. St-Joseph Shrine BAnQ P48S1P01110.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of the dome in 1937.]]\nFrom 1949\u20131951, architect Gilbert Moreau carried out alterations and improvements to the interior of Saint Joseph's Oratory, as well as to the adjacent monastery, and rearranged the sacristy in the basilica.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1866 | title=Moreau, Gilbert in Biographical Dictionary of Architects in Canada 1800\u20131950 |accessdate=November 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe basilica is dedicated to Saint Joseph, to whom Brother Andr\u00e9 credited all his reported miracles. These were mostly related to some kind of healing power, and many pilgrims (handicapped, blind, ill, etc.) poured into his Basilica, including numerous non-Catholics. On display in the basilica is a wall covered with thousands of crutches from those who came to the basilica and were purportedly healed. [[Pope John Paul II]] deemed the miracles to be authentic and [[beatification|beatified]] Brother Andr\u00e9 in 1982. In October 2010 [[Pope Benedict XVI]] canonized the saint.\n\nComposer [[\u00c9milien Allard]] was the church's [[carillonneur]] from 1955 to 1975. For [[RCA Victor]] he released the [[LP album]] ''Carols at the Carillon of Saint Joseph's Oratory'' for which he wrote the arrangements.<ref name=\"mort\">\"La vie et la mort d'un carillonneur\", ''Musique p\u00e9riodique'', vol 1, Jan\u2013Feb 1977</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nOn October 19, 2004, the Oratory held its centennial. All the bells of all the churches on the island of Montreal were supposed to ring at 9:00&nbsp;a.m., though not all churches participated. At 9:05&nbsp;a.m., the basilica rang its bell in response and celebration.

The image moved to the new modern basilica and was recrowned on 9 August 1955 via Cardinal [[Paul-\u00c9mile L\u00e9ger]] now located within its oil chapel department.\n\n==Architecture and structure==\n[[File:Montreal_StJoseph1_tango7174.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the crypt church, showing the barrel vaulting of its ceiling.]]\n[[File:Saint Joseph's Oratory Basilica Interior.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of the basilica, with its bright colours, stained glass and iconic multi-angled arches.]]\n[[File:St. Joseph's Oratory interior dome.jpg|thumb|right|The dome, as seen from the interior of the basilica.]]\nWhen the basilica\u2019s construction began in 1914, many architects were challenging the conventional [[Beaux-Arts style]] and [[neoclassicism (architecture)|neoclassicism]]. This period was exactly around the time where [[expressionist architecture]], [[constructivist architecture]], [[Bauhaus]] ideas and many other facets of modern architecture began to take off, with pioneers like [[Le Corbusier]] in Europe and [[Frank Lloyd Wright ]]in the United States refusing to be categorized by traditional architectural styles. It was certainly atypical for monumental classical church buildings to be constructed in cities around this time, yet Saint Joseph's Oratory was one of the largest buildings in Montreal when it was constructed, and was designed in [[Renaissance Revival]] exterior with an [[Art Deco]] interior. The basilica, as it stands today, comprises many parts, including the ''Crypt Church'', located underneath the basilica, the ''Votive Chapel'', between the Crypt and the rock of Mount-Royal, the ''Shrine'', which encompasses the [[nave]], [[apse]] and [[transept]], and the ''dome'', which is the largest church dome in Canada and the third largest in the world.\n\n===Crypt Church===\nThe Crypt Church, originally designed by Viau and Venne, measures {{cvt|63.39 by 36.5 by 13.1|m}}, has a seating capacity of 1000 people and is designed in a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style. The ceiling is supported using the [[barrel vault|barrel vaulting]] of steel-[[reinforced concrete]] arches. The church is called a \"crypt\" due to its flattened arches as well as its position embedded into the mountain underneath the basilica.<ref name=\"Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix\">{{cite web |url=http://www.saint-joseph.org/en/ |title=\"Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal.\" L'Oratoire Saint-Joseph Du Mont-Royal |publisher=Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix |accessdate=2 January 2020}}</ref> There is a statue of Joseph made out of [[Carrara marble]] behind the main altar of the Crypt Church, added in 1917 by the Italian artist A. Giacomini. Eight stained glass windows depicting the stages in [[Saint Joseph]]'s life were installed in the crypt in 1919 by the Montreal firm Perdriau et O'Shea.\n\n===Votive Chapel===\nAdded between 1946-1949 between the Crypt Church and the rock of Mount Royal, the Votive Chapel is designed in Art Deco style from the plans of [[Lucien Parent]], and relies on heavy use of geometric forms (square columns, square paneling on ceiling). The Chapel measures {{cvt|31.69 by 15.2 by 27.43|m}} and contains approximately 10,000 candles, with the central lampstand in front of the statue of Saint Joseph holding approximately 3500 votive candles. The chapel, also referred to as \"the Chapel of Ex-votos,\" has nearly 1000 [[Ex-voto|Ex-votos]] (canes, crutches, etc.) suspended within it, left behind by [[pilgrims]] during the life of Brother Andr\u00e9. The Chapel also contains eight [[bas-reliefs]] designed by Canadian sculptor, Joseph Guardo in 1948, which illustrate eight of the attributes which [[Christianity]] has accorded to Saint Joseph. The tomb of Saint Andr\u00e9, sculpted in [[black marble]], rests in an alcove in the middle of the Votive Chapel.<ref name=\"Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix\" />\n\n===Shrine===\nThe interior of the basilica, known as the Shrine, was designed using concepts by Dom Bellot as well as Canadian architect G\u00e9rard Notebaert, and uses a Latin cross layout with a dome at the crossing. The interior has an overall length of {{cvt|105|m}}. The nave, which contains [[pews]] to seat 2028 people (with a maximum capacity of 10,000 people), measures {{cvt|37|m}} in width, while the transept measures {{convert|65|m}} and connects to the shrine of Brother Andr\u00e9. The apse, as well as the rest of the interior, is designed in [[Art Deco]] style, which was very popular in Montreal during the 1930s, and contains sculptures, [[bas-reliefs]], mosaics and stained glass of religious imagery. The roof of the basilica is held up using reinforced concrete multi-angle arches iconic of Dom Bellot\u2019s style.\n\nThe exterior of the Oratory is constructed using large blocks of granite from [[Lac M\u00e9gantic]] quarries in Quebec. The [[colonnade]] at the front fa\u00e7ade of the building consists of four {{cvt|18|m}}-tall, {{cvt|1.5|m}}-thick [[Corinthian columns]] which provide the structural support for the [[entablature]] of the front [[portico]]. It is also [[cornice (architecture)|corniced]] and [[ornament (art)|ornamented]]. The staircase which leads from the street to the base of the basilica contain two parallel flights of 283 concrete steps separated by a central flight of 99 wooden steps reserved for pilgrims who wish to climb on their knees.<ref name=\"Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix\" />\n\n===Dome===\nThe dome of Saint Joseph\u2019s Oratory is the largest church dome in Canada and among the largest in the world, and this is a result of Dom Bellot\u2019s very inspired and ambitious designs. His plans for the dome are very similar to those of [[Florence Cathedral]], being of a \u201cdouble shell\u201d design, meaning it consists of two domes, one on the interior and one on the exterior with empty space in between. Like the cathedral in Florence, the outer dome of the Oratory consists of eight [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] laying atop an octagonal [[Tholobate|drum]], with a lantern and cross. The outer dome of the Oratory measures only {{cvt|17.78|cm}} in thickness and the inner dome measures only about {{cvt|12.7|cm}} in thickness, which is approximately 18 times thinner than the dome of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. The concrete shell of the Oratory's dome is so thin in fact that when related to its overall size, it is akin to an eggshell.<ref name=\"Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix\"/> \n\nThe two domes vary immensely span and height, with the outer dome measuring {{cvt|39|m}} in diameter and rising {{cvt|97|m}} from the nave floor and the inner dome measuring {{cvt|26|m}} in diameter and rising {{cvt|60|m}} from the nave floor. There are 16 steel [[buttresses]] along the inner walls of the drums that provide the structural support for the dome. They serve to brace the inner dome against the outer dome, thus making the supporting walls for both domes more rigid.\n\n==Modern developments==\nIn 2018, the architectural firms Atelier TAG and Architecture49 won a competition to renovate the inside of the dome of Saint Joseph's Oratory and its observatory. The project is estimated to cost around $80 million CAD and will also include a complete renovation of the building's museum and the construction of a new welcome centre on Queen Mary road.

It was filmed on March 25 and 26, 2020 and broadcast as a two-night event on April 4 and 5, marking the first time the event was broadcast over two nights as well as aired on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]]. On PPV, the two productions were sold as individual shows, with both available as a [[Product bundling|package deal]].\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020, at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] and was to air live. In mid-March 2020, all WWE programming was relocated to the [[WWE Performance Center]] training facility in [[Orlando]] due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], with [[Behind closed doors (sport)|no audience]] and only essential staff present and air across two nights. The majority of its matches were pre-recorded at the Performance Center between March 25 and 26. Taking advantage of the format, two matches \u2014 a \"[[Buried Alive match|Boneyard match]]\" and a \"Firefly Fun House match\" \u2014 were filmed off-site in atypical, [[filmmaking|cinematic]] style.\n\nThe card comprised nineteen matches which were divided between the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and a [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#dark_match|dark match]] on the second night. In the main event for Part 1, [[The Undertaker]], returning to his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick, defeated [[AJ Styles]] in a Boneyard match. In other prominent matches, [[Braun Strowman]] defeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] to win the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], [[Becky Lynch]] defeated [[Shayna Baszler]] to retain the [[Raw Women's Championship]], and [[Kevin Owens]] defeated [[Seth Rollins]] in a [[No Disqualification match]]. In the main event for Part 2, [[Drew McIntyre]]  defeated [[Brock Lesnar]] to win the [[WWE Championship]], after which, McIntyre retained the title in an impromptu dark match against [[Big Show]] (which was shown on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''). In other prominent matches, [[Bray Wyatt|\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] defeated [[John Cena]] in a Firefly Fun House match, [[Charlotte Flair]] defeated [[Rhea Ripley]] to win the [[NXT Women's Championship]] for a second time, which was the first time an NXT championship was defended at the event, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] in a [[Last Man Standing match]], which was Edge's first singles match since 2011, and [[Otis Dozovic|Otis]] defeated [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\nWrestleMania 36 received mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. While it was noted that the event suffered from the absence of a live audience and a poor lead-up (partly due to a number of wrestlers being pulled from the event shortly before its filming, mostly in relation to the pandemic, including [[Roman Reigns]], [[The Miz]], [[Andrade (wrestler)|Andrade]], and [[Dana Brooke]], all of whom were slated to defend or challenge for championships), most felt that WWE exceeded expectations. The Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches were singled out as highlights due to their uniqueness and over-the-top tone.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[WWE]]'s flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]].

The climax saw Cesaro perform a U.F.O. on Gulak, followed by a pin to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 1 opened with host Rob Gronkowski hyping WrestleMania, who was then joined by his friend [[Mojo Rawley]].<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the first match, The Kabuki Warriors ([[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]] and [[Kairi Sane]]) defended the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]] against [[Alexa Bliss]] and [[Nikki Cross]].

In the end, as Corbin attempted a pin on Elias with his legs on the rope, the referee noticed it and voided the pin; Elias then performed a roll-up on a distracted Corbin, who was arguing with the referee, to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Becky Lynch defended the Raw Women's Championship against Shayna Baszler. In the closing moments, as Baszler applied the Kirifuda Clutch on Lynch, Lynch countered into a roll-up to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, [[Sami Zayn]] (accompanied by Cesaro and [[Shinsuke Nakamura]]) defended the Intercontinental Championship against [[Daniel Bryan]] (accompanied by Drew Gulak). In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back into the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a Triple Threat Ladder match. The match was originally scheduled as a tag team Triple Threat Ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[No Disqualification match]], which was accepted.

In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium.

A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and chokeslammed Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentator\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]<ref name=\"Spanishannouncers\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]].

In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. With the referee distracted, Rose also performed a low blow on Ziggler. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge waited for Orton to make his entrance, Orton \u2013 who had been disguised as a cameraman \u2013 attacked Edge from behind with an RKO. Orton then attacked Edge with a second RKO and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Center's gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. After fighting all throughout the Performance Center, they eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge performed a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. A conflicted Edge then performed the Conchairto on Orton. Edge won the match after Orton was unable to answer the referee's 10 count.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Angel Garza and Austin Theory (with Zelina Vega). In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits. NXT's [[Bianca Belair]] then ran out and attacked Vega, clearing the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center.

Tamina was the first eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Banks applied the Bank Statement on Naomi to eliminate her. As Bayley attempted a dropkick on Evans in the corner, Evans moved out of the way and Bayley attacked Banks instead. After Bayley tried apologizing, Bayley pushed Banks out of the way of an attack from Evans, who performed the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her. Bayley did not attempt to break up the pin to save Banks. In the end, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then performed a DDT on Evans to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. Cena came out for his match in the Performance Center, assuming his match was taking place in the ring. Wyatt was then shown in the Firefly Fun House, stating that Cena would actually be facing himself before exiting through the fun house's door. Cena was then teleported to the Firefly Fun House. After also going through the door, Cena was transported through a series of [[dream sequence]]s where Wyatt demonstrated his perceived personality flaws (such as being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did), including his debut appearance on ''SmackDown'' (with Wyatt acting as [[Kurt Angle]], and Cena seemingly unable to say anything but \"[[History of WWE#Ruthless Aggression Era (2002-2008)|ruthless aggression]]\"), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' (where Wyatt introduced Cena as his tag team partner \"Johnny Largemeat\", who was tired out from repeatedly lifting weights). Appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt then reminisced about his loss to Cena at [[WrestleMania XXX]], and pledged to right his previous wrong. Back in a ring, Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt. After a fury of fists, Wyatt disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind and performed Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw on Cena to win the match, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin. Just before The Fiend performed Sister Abigail, the audio of Cena's promo from ''SmackDown'' was played, where Cena had stated that at WrestleMania, he would end the existence of the \"most over hyped, over valued, over privileged WWE Superstar\".<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-firefly-funhouse-boneyard-matches-lead-best-moments-from-surreal-2020-show/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results: Firefly FunHouse, Boneyard matches lead best moments from surreal 2020 show|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africa.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28997784/wwe-wrestlemania-36-live-results-recaps-analysis|title=WrestleMania 36: McIntyre stops Lesnar, Gronk wins 24/7 title|date=2020-04-05|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre.

While most agreed that WrestleMania 36 suffered from both a poor lead-up and the absence of a live audience, many felt that the event exceeded expectations, with both critics and fans largely praising the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches as the best of the event for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone (and in the case of the latter, its inventiveness and humor); the SmackDown Tag Team Championship match and Owens vs. Rollins were also singled out by most critics.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\">{{Cite web |last=Szalai |first=Georg |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wwe-pulled-wrestlemania-36-fans-business-impact-1288659 |title=How WWE Pulled Off WrestleMania 36 Without Fans and What It Means for Its Business and Future |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"SlateReview\">{{Cite web |last=Bixenspan |first=David |url=https://slate.com/culture/2020/04/wrestlemania-36-no-fans-audience-coronavirus-undertaker-john-cena.html |title=WrestleMania Still Happened Last Weekend.

While praising WWE for making the most out of its \"weirdest WrestleMania of all time\", particularly praising the Boneyard match, he did point out that most matches suffered from its poor lead-up and lack of live audience, stating notably that Becky Lynch and Shayna Baszler's match was \"a listless and too-short battle that, when you consider the response both performers tend to extract from crowds, might have shifted into another gear in a packed stadium.\" He also cited examples of \"shoddy storytelling\", noting that it \"[was] great that Braun Strowman beat the snot out of Goldberg, but it might have resonated more if the company hadn't just had the 53-year old Goldberg destroy The Fiend, a heretofore untouchable star, during a [[Super ShowDown (2020)| PPV in Saudi Arabia]]\u2014and, you know, done anything with Braun over the past few years.\"<ref name=\"AVCReview\">{{Cite web |last=Colbrun |first=Randall |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-weirdest-wrestlemania-of-all-time-at-least-figured-1842699373 |title=The Weirdest Wrestlemania of All Time at Least Figured Out How to Use Its Legends |work=[[The A.

Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn't actually there. [...] the WWE style\u2014with its emphasis on overwrought capital\u2013P 'performance,' over-rehearsed matches, and flowery mannerisms\u2014looked more like a parody when staged in front of zero spectators. Still, expectations for this WrestleMania were low, albeit with some minor optimism over the show being divided up into two nights instead of the marathon one-night slogs of recent years.\" However, he stated that after two lackluster opening matches, the card from Lynch vs. Baszler onward was \"very physical matches [which] made the best of the setting, and with most of the matches fitting that bill, [Part 1] was really strong overall\", although he found Part 2 much weaker, stating that Edge vs. Randy Orton was \"glacially slow, and it appeared to somehow be edited out of an even longer match\", and that Lesnar vs. McIntyre felt \"more like a formality than anything cool, because it was so paint-by-numbers.\" ''Slate'' considered the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches to be the best matches.<ref name=\"SlateReview\"/>\n\n''[[Bleacher Report]]'' stated \"It's hard to judge this event. You have to take the good with the bad, maintain honest integrity with criticism, but also be forgiving and acknowledge that this was not how WrestleMania was supposed to be.\" They gave a positive review, although they ranked Elias vs. Corbin, Black vs. Lashley, and the SmackDown Women's title match as the low points of the event.<ref name=\"BleacherReview1\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883707-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-1 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 1 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"BleacherReview2\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883709-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-2 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 2 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, ''Bleacher Report'' gave the Boneyard match a 4.5 star ratings on a scale of 5, their highest rated match from both nights, while giving the Universal Championship match a 0.5 star, their lowest rated match from the event.<ref>{{cit web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2885202-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-star-ratings-for-all-matches-from-full-show|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Star Ratings for All Matches from Full Show|author=Rill, Jake|date=April 6, 2020|accessdate=April 8, 2020|work=Bleacher Report}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches could set a precedent for WWE using more \"cinematic experiences\" in its programming to make up for the closed door tapings.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Raw===\nThe following night's episode of ''Raw'' showed the \"hidden WrestleMania main event\", in which Drew McIntyre retained the WWE Championship over Big Show roughly 25 minutes after McIntyre had defeated Brock Lesnar to win the title.<ref name=\"Raw04062020\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/06/4-6-wwe-raw-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-after-wrestlemania-36-edition-featuring-new-wwe-champion-drew-mcintyre-whats-next-for-edge-seth-rollins-becky-lynch-and-shayna-baszler/|title=4/6 WWE Raw Results: Powell\u2019s live review of the night after WrestleMania 36 edition featuring new WWE Champion Drew McIntyre, what\u2019s next for Edge, Seth Rollins, Becky Lynch, and Shayna Baszler|date=April 6, 2020|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nRaw Women's Champion Becky Lynch praised Shayna Baszler in their WrestleMania match and stated that Baszler knew where to find her if she wanted to face off again.<ref name=\"Raw04062020\"/> The following week, Baszler won her qualifying match to compete in the women's [[Money in the Bank ladder match]].<ref name=\"Raw04132020\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/13/4-13-wwe-raw-results-powells-live-review-of-drew-mcintyre-and-becky-lynch-appearances-money-in-the-bank-qualifying-matches-featuring-asuka-vs-ruby-riott-kairi-sane-vs-nia-jax-and-sarah-logan-v/|title=4/13 WWE Raw Results: Powell\u2019s live review of Drew McIntyre and Becky Lynch appearances, Money in the Bank qualifying matches featuring Asuka vs. Ruby Riott, Kairi Sane vs. Nia Jax, and Sarah Logan vs. Shayna Baszler|date=April 13, 2020|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wresting Dot Net|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nRaw Tag Team Champions The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) faced Austin Theory and Angel Garza (accompanied by Zelina Vega) in a rematch for the titles where the champions retained once again, though by disqualification thanks to Vega.

It was filmed on March 25 and 26, 2020 and broadcast as a two-night event on April 4 and 5, marking the first time the event was broadcast over two nights as well as aired on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]]. On PPV, the two productions were sold as individual shows, with both available as a [[Product bundling|package deal]].\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020, at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] and was to air live. In mid-March 2020, all WWE programming was relocated to the [[WWE Performance Center]] training facility in [[Orlando]] due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], with [[Behind closed doors (sport)|no audience]] and only essential staff present and air across two nights. The majority of its matches were pre-recorded at the Performance Center between March 25 and 26. Taking advantage of the format, two matches \u2014 a \"[[Buried Alive match|Boneyard match]]\" and a \"Firefly Fun House match\" \u2014 were filmed off-site in atypical, [[filmmaking|cinematic]] style.\n\nThe card comprised nineteen matches which were divided between the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and a [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#dark_match|dark match]] on the second night. In the main event for Part 1, [[The Undertaker]], returning to his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick, defeated [[AJ Styles]] in a Boneyard match. In other prominent matches, [[Braun Strowman]] defeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] to win the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], [[Becky Lynch]] defeated [[Shayna Baszler]] to retain the [[Raw Women's Championship]], and [[Kevin Owens]] defeated [[Seth Rollins]] in a [[No Disqualification match]]. In the main event for Part 2, [[Drew McIntyre]]  defeated [[Brock Lesnar]] to win the [[WWE Championship]], after which, McIntyre retained the title in an impromptu dark match against [[Big Show]] (which was shown on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''). In other prominent matches, [[Bray Wyatt|\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] defeated [[John Cena]] in a Firefly Fun House match, [[Charlotte Flair]] defeated [[Rhea Ripley]] to win the [[NXT Women's Championship]] for a second time, which was the first time an NXT championship was defended at the event, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] in a [[Last Man Standing match]], which was Edge's first singles match since 2011, and [[Otis Dozovic|Otis]] defeated [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\nWrestleMania 36 received mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. While it was noted that the event suffered from the absence of a live audience and a poor lead-up (partly due to a number of wrestlers being pulled from the event shortly before its filming, mostly in relation to the pandemic, including [[Roman Reigns]], [[The Miz]], [[Andrade (wrestler)|Andrade]], and [[Dana Brooke]], all of whom were slated to defend or challenge for championships), most felt that WWE exceeded expectations. The Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches were singled out as highlights due to their uniqueness and over-the-top tone.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[WWE]]'s flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]].

The climax saw Cesaro perform a U.F.O. on Gulak, followed by a pin to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 1 opened with host Rob Gronkowski hyping WrestleMania, who was then joined by his friend [[Mojo Rawley]].<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the first match, The Kabuki Warriors ([[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]] and [[Kairi Sane]]) defended the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]] against [[Alexa Bliss]] and [[Nikki Cross]].

In the end, as Corbin attempted a pin on Elias with his legs on the rope, the referee noticed it and voided the pin; Elias then performed a roll-up on a distracted Corbin, who was arguing with the referee, to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Becky Lynch defended the Raw Women's Championship against Shayna Baszler. In the closing moments, as Baszler applied the Kirifuda Clutch on Lynch, Lynch countered into a roll-up to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, [[Sami Zayn]] (accompanied by Cesaro and [[Shinsuke Nakamura]]) defended the Intercontinental Championship against [[Daniel Bryan]] (accompanied by Drew Gulak). In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back into the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a Triple Threat Ladder match. The match was originally scheduled as a tag team Triple Threat Ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[No Disqualification match]], which was accepted.

In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium.

A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and chokeslammed Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentator\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]<ref name=\"Spanishannouncers\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]].

In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. With the referee distracted, Rose also performed a low blow on Ziggler. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge waited for Orton to make his entrance, Orton \u2013 who had been disguised as a cameraman \u2013 attacked Edge from behind with an RKO. Orton then attacked Edge with a second RKO and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Center's gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. After fighting all throughout the Performance Center, they eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge performed a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. A conflicted Edge then performed the Conchairto on Orton. Edge won the match after Orton was unable to answer the referee's 10 count.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Angel Garza and Austin Theory (with Zelina Vega). In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits. NXT's [[Bianca Belair]] then ran out and attacked Vega, clearing the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center.

Tamina was the first eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Banks applied the Bank Statement on Naomi to eliminate her. As Bayley attempted a dropkick on Evans in the corner, Evans moved out of the way and Bayley attacked Banks instead. After Bayley tried apologizing, Bayley pushed Banks out of the way of an attack from Evans, who performed the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her. Bayley did not attempt to break up the pin to save Banks. In the end, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then performed a DDT on Evans to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. Cena came out for his match in the Performance Center, assuming his match was taking place in the ring. Wyatt was then shown in the Firefly Fun House, stating that Cena would actually be facing himself before exiting through the fun house's door. Cena was then teleported to the Firefly Fun House. After also going through the door, Cena was transported through a series of [[dream sequence]]s where Wyatt demonstrated his perceived personality flaws (such as being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did), including his debut appearance on ''SmackDown'' (with Wyatt acting as [[Kurt Angle]], and Cena seemingly unable to say anything but \"[[History of WWE#Ruthless Aggression Era (2002-2008)|ruthless aggression]]\"), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' (where Wyatt introduced Cena as his tag team partner \"Johnny Largemeat\", who was tired out from repeatedly lifting weights). Appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt then reminisced about his loss to Cena at [[WrestleMania XXX]], and pledged to right his previous wrong. Back in a ring, Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt. After a fury of fists, Wyatt disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind and performed Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw on Cena to win the match, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin. Just before The Fiend performed Sister Abigail, the audio of Cena's promo from ''SmackDown'' was played, where Cena had stated that at WrestleMania, he would end the existence of the \"most over hyped, over valued, over privileged WWE Superstar\".<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-firefly-funhouse-boneyard-matches-lead-best-moments-from-surreal-2020-show/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results: Firefly FunHouse, Boneyard matches lead best moments from surreal 2020 show|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africa.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28997784/wwe-wrestlemania-36-live-results-recaps-analysis|title=WrestleMania 36: McIntyre stops Lesnar, Gronk wins 24/7 title|date=2020-04-05|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre.

While most agreed that WrestleMania 36 suffered from both a poor lead-up and the absence of a live audience, many felt that the event exceeded expectations, with both critics and fans largely praising the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches as the best of the event for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone (and in the case of the latter, its inventiveness and humor); the SmackDown Tag Team Championship match and Owens vs. Rollins were also singled out by most critics.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\">{{Cite web |last=Szalai |first=Georg |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wwe-pulled-wrestlemania-36-fans-business-impact-1288659 |title=How WWE Pulled Off WrestleMania 36 Without Fans and What It Means for Its Business and Future |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"SlateReview\">{{Cite web |last=Bixenspan |first=David |url=https://slate.com/culture/2020/04/wrestlemania-36-no-fans-audience-coronavirus-undertaker-john-cena.html |title=WrestleMania Still Happened Last Weekend.

While praising WWE for making the most out of its \"weirdest WrestleMania of all time\", particularly praising the Boneyard match, he did point out that most matches suffered from its poor lead-up and lack of live audience, stating notably that Becky Lynch and Shayna Baszler's match was \"a listless and too-short battle that, when you consider the response both performers tend to extract from crowds, might have shifted into another gear in a packed stadium.\" He also cited examples of \"shoddy storytelling\", noting that it \"[was] great that Braun Strowman beat the snot out of Goldberg, but it might have resonated more if the company hadn't just had the 53-year old Goldberg destroy The Fiend, a heretofore untouchable star, during a [[Super ShowDown (2020)| PPV in Saudi Arabia]]\u2014and, you know, done anything with Braun over the past few years.\"<ref name=\"AVCReview\">{{Cite web |last=Colbrun |first=Randall |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-weirdest-wrestlemania-of-all-time-at-least-figured-1842699373 |title=The Weirdest Wrestlemania of All Time at Least Figured Out How to Use Its Legends |work=[[The A.

Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn't actually there. [...] the WWE style\u2014with its emphasis on overwrought capital\u2013P 'performance,' over-rehearsed matches, and flowery mannerisms\u2014looked more like a parody when staged in front of zero spectators. Still, expectations for this WrestleMania were low, albeit with some minor optimism over the show being divided up into two nights instead of the marathon one-night slogs of recent years.\" However, he stated that after two lackluster opening matches, the card from Lynch vs. Baszler onward was \"very physical matches [which] made the best of the setting, and with most of the matches fitting that bill, [Part 1] was really strong overall\", although he found Part 2 much weaker, stating that Edge vs. Randy Orton was \"glacially slow, and it appeared to somehow be edited out of an even longer match\", and that Lesnar vs. McIntyre felt \"more like a formality than anything cool, because it was so paint-by-numbers.\" ''Slate'' considered the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches to be the best matches.<ref name=\"SlateReview\"/>\n\n''[[Bleacher Report]]'' stated \"It's hard to judge this event. You have to take the good with the bad, maintain honest integrity with criticism, but also be forgiving and acknowledge that this was not how WrestleMania was supposed to be.\" They gave a positive review, although they ranked Elias vs. Corbin, Black vs. Lashley, and the SmackDown Women's title match as the low points of the event.<ref name=\"BleacherReview1\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883707-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-1 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 1 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"BleacherReview2\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883709-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-2 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 2 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, ''Bleacher Report'' gave the Boneyard match a 4.5 star ratings on a scale of 5, their highest rated match from both nights, while giving the Universal Championship match a 0.5 star, their lowest rated match from the event.<ref>{{cit web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2885202-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-star-ratings-for-all-matches-from-full-show|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Star Ratings for All Matches from Full Show|author=Rill, Jake|date=April 6, 2020|accessdate=April 8, 2020|work=Bleacher Report}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches could set a precedent for WWE using more \"cinematic experiences\" in its programming to make up for the closed door tapings.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Raw===\nThe following night's episode of ''Raw'' showed the \"hidden WrestleMania main event\", in which Drew McIntyre retained the WWE Championship over Big Show roughly 25 minutes after McIntyre had defeated Brock Lesnar to win the title.<ref name=\"Raw04062020\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/06/4-6-wwe-raw-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-after-wrestlemania-36-edition-featuring-new-wwe-champion-drew-mcintyre-whats-next-for-edge-seth-rollins-becky-lynch-and-shayna-baszler/|title=4/6 WWE Raw Results: Powell\u2019s live review of the night after WrestleMania 36 edition featuring new WWE Champion Drew McIntyre, what\u2019s next for Edge, Seth Rollins, Becky Lynch, and Shayna Baszler|date=April 6, 2020|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nRaw Women's Champion Becky Lynch praised Shayna Baszler in their WrestleMania match and stated that Baszler knew where to find her if she wanted to face off again.<ref name=\"Raw04062020\"/> The following week, Baszler won her qualifying match to compete in the women's [[Money in the Bank ladder match]].<ref name=\"Raw04132020\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/13/4-13-wwe-raw-results-powells-live-review-of-drew-mcintyre-and-becky-lynch-appearances-money-in-the-bank-qualifying-matches-featuring-asuka-vs-ruby-riott-kairi-sane-vs-nia-jax-and-sarah-logan-v/|title=4/13 WWE Raw Results: Powell\u2019s live review of Drew McIntyre and Becky Lynch appearances, Money in the Bank qualifying matches featuring Asuka vs. Ruby Riott, Kairi Sane vs. Nia Jax, and Sarah Logan vs. Shayna Baszler|date=April 13, 2020|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wresting Dot Net|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nRaw Tag Team Champions The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) faced Austin Theory and Angel Garza (accompanied by Zelina Vega) in a rematch for the titles where the champions retained once again, though by disqualification thanks to Vega.

His wingman scored another kill on a third Mirage F1, for a total of three kills in the dogfight.\n\nUSN F/A-18s vs. IRAF MiG-25s\nOn the first night of the war, two F/A-18s from the carrier USS Saratoga were flying outside of Baghdad when two Iraqi MiG-25PDs interceptors from the 96th Squadron engaged them. In the beyond-visual-range (BVR), one of the Iraqi MiGs, piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Zuhair Dawood, fired an R-40 missile, shooting down one of the F/A-18's as it was travelling Mach 0.92. The pilot, Lieutenant Commander [[Scott Speicher]], was killed. It is widely believed he died upon the impact of the missile.\n\nUSN F/A-18s vs. IRAF MiG-21s\nTwo F/A-18s from VFA-81 shot down two Iraqi MiG-21s, one with an AIM-7 Sparrow missile and one with an AIM-9 Sidewinder missile, in a brief dogfight with their bombs still latched on.\n\nUSAF F-15Es vs IRAF MiG-29s\nOn the opening night of the war two Iraqi MiG-29s attempted to engage a flight of USAF F-15Es. One of the MiGs crashed while flying at low altitude but the other MiG pressed on. One of the F-15Es fired an AIM-9 Sidewinder when the MiG locked him up but missed. Several other F-15Es simultaneously tried to engage the lone MiG-29 but were unable to get the kill. One F-15E was actually flying past the Iraqi jet and maneuvered in for the kill but the pilot hesitated to take the shot because he was unsure of his wingmen's location and because he did not get a good tone with the Sidewinder missile.\n\nUSAF EF-111 vs. IRAF Mirage F-1\nOn the first night of the war a USAF EF-111A Raven \"Spark Vark\", flown by pilot Captain James Denton and Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) Captain Brent Brandon, was on an electronic warfare mission ahead of a group of jets on a bombing run. Several IRAF Dassault Mirage F1s came in and engaged the flight. One of them went after the unarmed EF-111. Denton executed a tight turn while Brandon launched chaff to avoid missiles fired by the Mirage. An F-15C on the same flight, piloted by Robert Graeter, went after the Mirage to protect the EF-111. The Mirage launched a missile, spotted by Brandon, which the Raven avoided by turning and launching chaff. Denton decided to head for the deck to try to evade his pursuer. As he went down he pulled up to avoid the ground, the Mirage followed him through, but did not pull up in time and crashed. An unarmed EF-111 had thus scored an air-air victory against a Dassault Mirage F1, although Graeter was credited with a kill. The EF-111A crew were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-25s\nTwo IRAF MiG-25s fired missiles at a group of F-15Cs escorting a bombing run in Iraq (which were evaded by the F-15s). The F-15Cs gave chase, but were forced to give up when the MiGs outran them. A total of 10 missiles were fired at the MiGs.\n\nUSAF F-111s vs. IRAF MiG-23\nAn Iraqi MiG-23 fired a R-24T missile at a F-111 on a bombing run and scored a hit, although the bomber made it safely back to base. Another similar incident occurred with the same Iraqi interceptor several minutes later, this F-111 also made it back to base despite the severe damage to the aircraft. This is Iraq's only success of the Persian Gulf War using MiG-23s.\n\nIRAF MiG-29 vs USAF F-111 and B-52G\nAn Iraqi MiG-29 struck an F-111 aircraft with an R60 missile, though the sturdy F-111 stayed airworthy. Several minutes later the same pilot fired a R27 missile at a B-52G on a bombing run, severely damaging it.\n\n19 January 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-25s\nIn a brief dogfight, two F-15Cs engaged and shot down two Iraqi MiG-25s attempting to engage them, both using AIM-7 missiles. One was destroyed by Captain Rick Tuleni and the second by Captain Larry Pitts.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-29s\nTwo F-15Cs, piloted by Captains Craig Underhill and Cesar Rodriguez gave chase to a pair of MiG-29s detected by AWACS. The Iraqi aircraft, one piloted by Captain Jameel Sayhood, promptly turned and engaged the two American fighters, and one of the most dramatic dogfights of the Persian Gulf War ensued. The two MiGs and F-15s flew straight at each other, each attempting to visually identify the other. Underhill was facing Sayhood's wingman, while Sayhood himself was facing Rodriguez. Underhill fired an AIM-7 at Sayhood's wingman, scoring a head-on hit and killing the opposing pilot instantly. Simultaneously, Sayhood gained a lock on Rodriguez, throwing him onto the defensive. Rodriguez dove to low altitude in order to clutter Sayhood's radar and break the lock-on, and dropped flares to counter his adversary's infra-red search-and-track. However, after seeing his wingman shot down, Sayhood disengaged and fled to the north. Considering the engagement over, Rodriguez and Underhill turned south to rendezvous with a KC-135 tanker in order to refuel, but Sayhood reversed course and set off after them, prompting them to reengage. With the now lone MiG-29 closing head-on with the pair of F-15s, Underhill gained radar lock-on, but did not fire due to a glitch in his IFF interrogator system keeping him from being certain he wasn't about to shoot down a Coalition aircraft. Underhill initially thought he shot down an allied aircraft. Sayhood sliced into the American formation, causing a classic merge. Underhill kept Sayhood locked-on and climbed, while Rodriguez committed to the merge in order to visually identify the opposing aircraft as hostile. As they passed head-on, Rodriguez identified it as an Iraqi, and each pilot turned left to engage the other. Sayhood was relying on his MiG's better turning radius to get into a firing position on Rodriguez' tail but Rodriguez was very close to firing position on him. Both aircraft lost altitude through the sustained hard turning, bringing them perilously close to the ground. Fearing that Rodriguez would obtain infra-red lock-on and shoot him down with an AIM-9, Sayhood attempted to disengage using a split-s. Rodriguez didn't match Sayhood's manoeuver, and observed him eject just prior to his MiG impacting the ground \u2013 he'd commenced his escape maneuver too low. It was reported years later by Iraqi sources that the Captain was rescued by some farmers after he broke his leg and evacuated to a local hospital.\n\nRAF Tornado GR.1 vs. IRAF MiG-29\nIt has been claimed by some sources that an RAF Tornado (ZA467) crewed by Squadron Leader Gary Lennox and Squadron Leader Adrian Weeks was shot down on 19 January by an R-60MK (NATO reporting name: AA-8 Aphid) missile fired from an Iraqi MiG-29 piloted by Jameel Sayhood, however this aircraft is officially recorded as having crashed on 22 January on a mission to Ar Rutbah.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF Mirage F1s\nTwo F-15Cs destroyed two Mirage F1s with AIM-7 missiles.\n\n24 January 1991\nRSAF F-15C vs. IRAF Mirage F1s\nThe Iraqi Air Force attempted to mount a rare offensive bombing operation and loaded two F1s with incendiary bombs. The Royal Saudi Air Force sent up two F-15Cs to intercept the bombers. One of the F-15s piloted by Captain Ayedh Al-Shamrani maneuvered behind the F1s and shot them both down with AIM-9 missiles.\n\n26 January 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-23s\nIn what is considered a textbook \"beyond visual range\" or BVR kill, four MiG-23s took off from an Iraqi airbase.

Not long after, as Kobylash was returning to base at an altitude of 1000 meters, a second [[MANPADS]] missile struck his right engine, leaving the plane without thrust. Kobylash was able to glide to Russian controlled territory before ejecting north of Tskhinvali in a South Ossetian village of the Georgian enclave in the Great Liakh gorge, where he was recovered by a Russian [[combat search and rescue]] team. Shortly after Kobylash was rescued, South Ossetian militants claimed they had downed a Georgian Su-25, however Georgian Air Force did not operate since the day before, likely making the second fatal hit on this Su-25 another friendly fire incident.<ref>http://www.cast.ru/files/The_Tanks_of_August_sm_eng.pdf</ref><ref name=\"Jamestown\">{{cite web |title=The Russia-Georgia Conflict as Analyzed by the Center of Analysis of Strategies and Technologies in Moscow |publisher=Jamestown Foundation |url=https://jamestown.org/program/the-russia-georgia-conflict-as-analyzed-by-the-center-of-analysis-of-strategies-and-technologies-in-moscow/ |access-date=2018-03-14}}</ref>\n* [[File:Roundel of the Soviet Union (1945\u20131991).svg|20px|Russian Air Force roundel (1992\u20132010)]] 9 August 2008 \u2013 at 13:00, another Russian [[Sukhoi Su-25|Su-25]] from the 368th Attack Aviation Regiment, piloted by Major Vladimir Edamenko, was struck by a Russian [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka]] anti-aircraft gun near [[Java (town)|Dzhava]] killing the pilot in another friendly fire incident, due to the failure of the [[Identification friend or foe|IFF system]] on the Su-25.

His wingman scored another kill on a third Mirage F1, for a total of three kills in the dogfight.\n\nUSN F/A-18s vs. IRAF MiG-25s\nOn the first night of the war, two F/A-18s from the carrier USS Saratoga were flying outside of Baghdad when two Iraqi MiG-25PDs interceptors from the 96th Squadron engaged them. In the beyond-visual-range (BVR), one of the Iraqi MiGs, piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Zuhair Dawood, fired an R-40 missile, shooting down one of the F/A-18's as it was travelling Mach 0.92. The pilot, Lieutenant Commander [[Scott Speicher]], was killed. It is widely believed he died upon the impact of the missile.\n\nUSN F/A-18s vs. IRAF MiG-21s\nTwo F/A-18s from VFA-81 shot down two Iraqi MiG-21s, one with an AIM-7 Sparrow missile and one with an AIM-9 Sidewinder missile, in a brief dogfight with their bombs still latched on.\n\nUSAF F-15Es vs IRAF MiG-29s\nOn the opening night of the war two Iraqi MiG-29s attempted to engage a flight of USAF F-15Es. One of the MiGs crashed while flying at low altitude but the other MiG pressed on. One of the F-15Es fired an AIM-9 Sidewinder when the MiG locked him up but missed. Several other F-15Es simultaneously tried to engage the lone MiG-29 but were unable to get the kill. One F-15E was actually flying past the Iraqi jet and maneuvered in for the kill but the pilot hesitated to take the shot because he was unsure of his wingmen's location and because he did not get a good tone with the Sidewinder missile.\n\nUSAF EF-111 vs. IRAF Mirage F-1\nOn the first night of the war a USAF EF-111A Raven \"Spark Vark\", flown by pilot Captain James Denton and Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) Captain Brent Brandon, was on an electronic warfare mission ahead of a group of jets on a bombing run. Several IRAF Dassault Mirage F1s came in and engaged the flight. One of them went after the unarmed EF-111. Denton executed a tight turn while Brandon launched chaff to avoid missiles fired by the Mirage. An F-15C on the same flight, piloted by Robert Graeter, went after the Mirage to protect the EF-111. The Mirage launched a missile, spotted by Brandon, which the Raven avoided by turning and launching chaff. Denton decided to head for the deck to try to evade his pursuer. As he went down he pulled up to avoid the ground, the Mirage followed him through, but did not pull up in time and crashed. An unarmed EF-111 had thus scored an air-air victory against a Dassault Mirage F1, although Graeter was credited with a kill. The EF-111A crew were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-25s\nTwo IRAF MiG-25s fired missiles at a group of F-15Cs escorting a bombing run in Iraq (which were evaded by the F-15s). The F-15Cs gave chase, but were forced to give up when the MiGs outran them. A total of 10 missiles were fired at the MiGs.\n\nUSAF F-111s vs. IRAF MiG-23\nAn Iraqi MiG-23 fired a R-24T missile at a F-111 on a bombing run and scored a hit, although the bomber made it safely back to base. Another similar incident occurred with the same Iraqi interceptor several minutes later, this F-111 also made it back to base despite the severe damage to the aircraft. This is Iraq's only success of the Persian Gulf War using MiG-23s.\n\nIRAF MiG-29 vs USAF F-111 and B-52G\nAn Iraqi MiG-29 struck an F-111 aircraft with an R60 missile, though the sturdy F-111 stayed airworthy. Several minutes later the same pilot fired a R27 missile at a B-52G on a bombing run, severely damaging it.\n\n19 January 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-25s\nIn a brief dogfight, two F-15Cs engaged and shot down two Iraqi MiG-25s attempting to engage them, both using AIM-7 missiles. One was destroyed by Captain Rick Tuleni and the second by Captain Larry Pitts.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-29s\nTwo F-15Cs, piloted by Captains Craig Underhill and Cesar Rodriguez gave chase to a pair of MiG-29s detected by AWACS. The Iraqi aircraft, one piloted by Captain Jameel Sayhood, promptly turned and engaged the two American fighters, and one of the most dramatic dogfights of the Persian Gulf War ensued. The two MiGs and F-15s flew straight at each other, each attempting to visually identify the other. Underhill was facing Sayhood's wingman, while Sayhood himself was facing Rodriguez. Underhill fired an AIM-7 at Sayhood's wingman, scoring a head-on hit and killing the opposing pilot instantly. Simultaneously, Sayhood gained a lock on Rodriguez, throwing him onto the defensive. Rodriguez dove to low altitude in order to clutter Sayhood's radar and break the lock-on, and dropped flares to counter his adversary's infra-red search-and-track. However, after seeing his wingman shot down, Sayhood disengaged and fled to the north. Considering the engagement over, Rodriguez and Underhill turned south to rendezvous with a KC-135 tanker in order to refuel, but Sayhood reversed course and set off after them, prompting them to reengage. With the now lone MiG-29 closing head-on with the pair of F-15s, Underhill gained radar lock-on, but did not fire due to a glitch in his IFF interrogator system keeping him from being certain he wasn't about to shoot down a Coalition aircraft. Underhill initially thought he shot down an allied aircraft. Sayhood sliced into the American formation, causing a classic merge. Underhill kept Sayhood locked-on and climbed, while Rodriguez committed to the merge in order to visually identify the opposing aircraft as hostile. As they passed head-on, Rodriguez identified it as an Iraqi, and each pilot turned left to engage the other. Sayhood was relying on his MiG's better turning radius to get into a firing position on Rodriguez' tail but Rodriguez was very close to firing position on him. Both aircraft lost altitude through the sustained hard turning, bringing them perilously close to the ground. Fearing that Rodriguez would obtain infra-red lock-on and shoot him down with an AIM-9, Sayhood attempted to disengage using a split-s. Rodriguez didn't match Sayhood's manoeuver, and observed him eject just prior to his MiG impacting the ground \u2013 he'd commenced his escape maneuver too low. It was reported years later by Iraqi sources that the Captain was rescued by some farmers after he broke his leg and evacuated to a local hospital.\n\nRAF Tornado GR.1 vs. IRAF MiG-29\nIt has been claimed by some sources that an RAF Tornado (ZA467) crewed by Squadron Leader Gary Lennox and Squadron Leader Adrian Weeks was shot down on 19 January by an R-60MK (NATO reporting name: AA-8 Aphid) missile fired from an Iraqi MiG-29 piloted by Jameel Sayhood, however this aircraft is officially recorded as having crashed on 22 January on a mission to Ar Rutbah.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF Mirage F1s\nTwo F-15Cs destroyed two Mirage F1s with AIM-7 missiles.\n\n24 January 1991\nRSAF F-15C vs. IRAF Mirage F1s\nThe Iraqi Air Force attempted to mount a rare offensive bombing operation and loaded two F1s with incendiary bombs. The Royal Saudi Air Force sent up two F-15Cs to intercept the bombers. One of the F-15s piloted by Captain Ayedh Al-Shamrani maneuvered behind the F1s and shot them both down with AIM-9 missiles.\n\n26 January 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-23s\nIn what is considered a textbook \"beyond visual range\" or BVR kill, four MiG-23s took off from an Iraqi airbase. One of them turned back with mechanical problems, however the other three pressed on. Four F-15Cs were flying when AWACS reported the MiGs. The four F-15s lined up, were assigned targets and fired AIM-7 missiles at all of them, destroying all three MiGs within seconds of each other. Only three of the F-15C pilots were granted kills, as the fourth missile didn't reach the MiG until after it had already been brought down.\n\n27 January 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-23s and Mirage F1\nTwo F-15Cs managed to get kills on three MiG-23s and one Mirage F1, after they caught them trying to flee to Iran. They were brought down with AIM-9 and AIM-7 missiles after a brief dogfight.\n\n29 January 1991\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF MiG-23\nAn American F-15C shot down a MiG-23 fleeing to Iran with an AIM-7 missile.\n\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF MiG-23\nA USAF F-15C eliminates an Iraqi MiG-23 in a short-lived dogfight with an AIM-7 missile.\n\n2 February 1991\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF IL-76\nAn F-15C kills an Iraqi transport, an IL-76, that was parked by strafing it with 20&nbsp;mm bullets.\n\n6 February 1991\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF MiG-21s\nA lone F-15C takes down two Iraqi MiG-21s with AIM-7 missiles after they both engage him. These MiGs were escorting the Su-25s mentioned below.\n\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF Su-25s\nA F-15C spots two Iraqi Su-25s and gives chase, locking on, and shooting down both planes with AIM-9 missiles.\n\nUSAF A-10A vs. IRAF Bo-105\nA USAF A-10 ground attack aircraft, shoots down an Iraqi Bo-105 helicopter using its GAU-8 30&nbsp;mm cannon.\n\n7 February 1991\nUSN F-14 vs. IRAF Mi-8\nA USN F-14 shoots down an IRAF Mi-8 helicopter with an AIM-9 missile. It is the last USN F-14 air-to-air kill.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF Su-22s and Su-7\nTwo USAF F-15Cs shoot down two IRAF Su-22s and one Su-7 as they attempt to flee Iraq. All with AIM-7 missiles.\n\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF Mil-24\nA F-15C shoots down an IRAF Mi-24 with an AIM-7 missile.\n\n11 February 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF helicopters\nTwo F-15Cs shoot down two unidentified Iraqi helicopters by using AIM-7 missiles for both.\n\n14 February 1991\nUSAF F-15E vs. IRAF Hughes 500\nAn F-15E Strike Eagle fighter/bomber dropped a laser-guided bomb onto a Hughes 500 helicopter in the air. The helicopter was on the ground initially loading up commandos, though it took off. Even with it taking off they left the laser on it and the bomb hit it when it was \"200 or so\" feet in the air. A special forces team on the ground witnessed the event.\n\n15 February 1991\nUSAF A-10A vs. IRAF Mi-8\nAn A-10A ground attack aircraft shoots down an Iraqi Mi-8 helicopter with its GAU-8 30&nbsp;mm cannon.\n\n===Iraqi no-fly zones (1991\u20132003)===\n* [[File:Roundel of Iraq.svg|24px|Iraqi Air Force Roundel]] 20 March 1991 \u2013 USAF F-15C vs. IRAF Su-22 \u2013 In accordance with the ceasefire, an F-15C shoots down an Iraqi Su-22 bomber with an AIM-9 missile.\n* [[File:Roundel of Iraq.svg|24px|Iraqi Air Force Roundel]]27 December 1992 \u2013 USAF F-16 vs. IRAF MiG-25 \u2013 A MiG-25 crossed the no-fly zone and an F-16D shot it down with an AIM-120 AMRAAM missile.
