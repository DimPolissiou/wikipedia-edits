[[Anberlin]] was showcasing their new material on the [[Warped Tour#Stages|main stage]] for the entire tour, with the pre-order coming with a [[USB]] device on a wristband. The USB contained a direct link to a [[Music download|digital download]] of the album, available on the release date September 30, 2008. The USB also had four exclusive tracks, including an alternate acoustic remix of \"Breaking\", and remixes of \"Hello Alone\", \"[[The Unwinding Cable Car]]\" and \"[[Feel Good Drag|The Feel Good Drag]]\".<ref name=preorder>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=352941|title=Anberlin New Surrender Pre-Order Info|publisher=Absolute Punk.net|last=Djamoos|first=Anton|date=June 19, 2008|accessdate=July 10, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn response to some fans who claimed Anberlin was selling out, the band members released a music video called \"Compound Lockdown\". Christian McAlhaney introduced the video by saying that Anberlin \"likes money a lot\" and was going in a different direction, more towards a \"hip-hop, thug rap, dirty south kind of thing\". The song \"Drop Dat (Did You?)\" comes on next, displaying Stephen Christian and the members of Anberlin, accompanied by Vic Fuentes of [[Pierce the Veil]] and members of [[Four Year Strong]], rapping to the song.

Another one of the reasons why the band had yet to release a follow-up to ''The Empire Strikes First'' was their various other activities, most obviously frontman [[Greg Graffin]]'s, who released his [[Cold as the Clay|second solo album]] in 2006, his first since [[American Lesion|1997]].\n\n''New Maps of Hell'' also marks the third Bad Religion album released after returning to [[Epitaph Records]] for 2002's ''[[The Process of Belief]]'' and with Gurewitz since his departure during the release of 1994's ''[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion album)|Stranger Than Fiction]]''.\n\n==Background and composition==\nBad Religion first mentioned the follow-up to ''[[The Empire Strikes First]]'' in 2005, stating that the band would begin recording it later that year, making it likely that it would be released sometime in 2006.<ref>[http://www.thebrpage.net/news/news_item.asp?NewsID=777 New album \"sometime in 2006\"], The Bad Religion Page, May 5, 2005</ref> In July 2005, it was announced that Graffin and Gurewitz had begun writing \"about 20 songs or more\" for the album.<ref>[http://www.thebrpage.net/news/news_item.asp?NewsID=818 Bad Religion Come Back?], The Bad Religion Page, July 18, 2005</ref>\n\nOn January 20, 2006, it was announced that Bad Religion was \"almost 100% ready to go back to the studio or to the house\" to begin working on the album.<ref>[http://www.thebrpage.net/news/news_item.asp?NewsID=951 Back to the studio soon?], The Bad Religion Page, January 20, 2006</ref> Members of the band had mentioned that it would be a double release,<ref>[http://www.thebrpage.net/news/news_item.asp?NewsID=995 Double Disc!], The Bad Religion Page, March 14, 2006</ref> but this idea was later turned down flat by Bentley.<ref>[http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/bad_religion_bassist_talks_on_new_album_upcoming_tour.html Bad Religion Bassist Talks On New Album, Upcoming Tour], [[Ultimate Guitar Archive|Ultimate-Guitar.com]], March 1, 2007</ref>\n\nIn early February 2006, Bentley was chatting with a visitor who comments on news articles at the official Bad Religion fansite, stating that the new Bad Religion album was planned for a September release, as well as a tour to follow.<ref>[http://www.thebrpage.net/news/news_item.asp?NewsID=964 New album out in September], The Bad Religion Page, February 2, 2006</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nIn May 2006, Bentley also mentioned that the band was planning to begin recording it around late June/early July.<ref>[http://www.thebrpage.net/news/news_item.asp?NewsID=1024 Bad Religion Podcast], The Bad Religion Page, May 4, 2006</ref> In September, the band mentioned they were in the process of demoing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/index.php/news/entry/archive_1255|title=Bad Religion working on new album for 2007 release|work=Alternative Press|date=September 13, 2006|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBentley also told Kristoffer Averheim, the webmaster of the Bad Religion fansite, that the album had been pushed back to late 2006/early 2007.<ref>[http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/bad_religion_new_album_update.html Bad Religion: New Album Update], [[Ultimate Guitar Archive|Ultimate-Guitar.com]], June 27, 2006</ref> While drummer [[Brooks Wackerman]] posted a message on MySpace stating that the band had continued working on a new album, he stated that the album was once again pushed back to \"mid/late 2007\".\n\nIn January 2007, it was announced that the album would be called ''New Maps of Hell'' and would work with producer [[Joe Barresi]].<ref>[http://www.punknews.org/article/21802 Bad Religion confirms July 10th release date], Punknews.org, January 18, 2007</ref> The band began recording at Grand Master Studios in Los Angeles, California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/index.php/news/entry/archive_1697|title=Bad Religion set studio time, release date for new album|work=Alternative Press|date=January 18, 2007|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}</ref> On April 1, Bentley posted an update on the MySpace bulletin board, stating that the band was finally finished recording the album and would soon begin mixing it.<ref>[http://www.punknews.org/article/23041 Bad Religion finish recording \"New Maps of Hell\"], Punknews.org, April 2, 2007</ref> He had this to say:\n\n:{{cquote|We are done recording.

Another one of the reasons why the band had yet to release a follow-up to ''The Empire Strikes First'' was their various other activities, most obviously frontman [[Greg Graffin]]'s, who released his [[Cold as the Clay|second solo album]] in 2006, his first since [[American Lesion|1997]].\n\n''New Maps of Hell'' also marks the third Bad Religion album released after returning to [[Epitaph Records]] for 2002's ''[[The Process of Belief]]'' and with Gurewitz since his departure during the release of 1994's ''[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion album)|Stranger Than Fiction]].\n\n==Background and composition==\nBad Religion first mentioned the follow-up to ''[[The Empire Strikes First]]'' in 2005, stating that the band would begin recording it later that year, making it likely that it would be released sometime in 2006.<ref>[http://www.thebrpage.net/news/news_item.asp?NewsID=777 New album \"sometime in 2006\"], The Bad Religion Page, May 5, 2005</ref> In July 2005, it was announced that Graffin and Gurewitz had begun writing \"about 20 songs or more\" for the album.<ref>[http://www.thebrpage.net/news/news_item.asp?NewsID=818 Bad Religion Come Back?], The Bad Religion Page, July 18, 2005</ref>\n\nOn January 20, 2006, it was announced that Bad Religion was \"almost 100% ready to go back to the studio or to the house\" to begin working on the album.<ref>[http://www.thebrpage.net/news/news_item.asp?NewsID=951 Back to the studio soon?], The Bad Religion Page, January 20, 2006</ref> Members of the band had mentioned that it would be a double release,<ref>[http://www.thebrpage.net/news/news_item.asp?NewsID=995 Double Disc!], The Bad Religion Page, March 14, 2006</ref> but this idea was later turned down flat by Bentley.<ref>[http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/bad_religion_bassist_talks_on_new_album_upcoming_tour.html Bad Religion Bassist Talks On New Album, Upcoming Tour], [[Ultimate Guitar Archive|Ultimate-Guitar.com]], March 1, 2007</ref>\n\nIn early February 2006, Bentley was chatting with a visitor who comments on news articles at the official Bad Religion fansite, stating that the new Bad Religion album was planned for a September release, as well as a tour to follow.<ref>[http://www.thebrpage.net/news/news_item.asp?NewsID=964 New album out in September], The Bad Religion Page, February 2, 2006</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nIn May 2006, Bentley also mentioned that the band was planning to begin recording it around late June/early July.<ref>[http://www.thebrpage.net/news/news_item.asp?NewsID=1024 Bad Religion Podcast], The Bad Religion Page, May 4, 2006</ref> In September, the band mentioned they were in the process of demoing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/index.php/news/entry/archive_1255|title=Bad Religion working on new album for 2007 release|work=Alternative Press|date=September 13, 2006|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBentley also told Kristoffer Averheim, the webmaster of the Bad Religion fansite, that the album had been pushed back to late 2006/early 2007.<ref>[http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/bad_religion_new_album_update.html Bad Religion: New Album Update], [[Ultimate Guitar Archive|Ultimate-Guitar.com]], June 27, 2006</ref> While drummer [[Brooks Wackerman]] posted a message on MySpace stating that the band had continued working on a new album, he stated that the album was once again pushed back to \"mid/late 2007\".\n\nIn January 2007, it was announced that the album would be called ''New Maps of Hell'' and would work with producer [[Joe Barresi]].<ref>[http://www.punknews.org/article/21802 Bad Religion confirms July 10th release date], Punknews.org, January 18, 2007</ref> The band began recording at Grand Master Studios in Los Angeles, California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/index.php/news/entry/archive_1697|title=Bad Religion set studio time, release date for new album|work=Alternative Press|date=January 18, 2007|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}</ref> On April 1, Bentley posted an update on the MySpace bulletin board, stating that the band was finally finished recording the album and would soon begin mixing it.<ref>[http://www.punknews.org/article/23041 Bad Religion finish recording \"New Maps of Hell\"], Punknews.org, April 2, 2007</ref> He had this to say:\n\n:{{cquote|We are done recording.

Machado is indeed a message bearer. He conceived a whole program of interventions, from which \u201cOctopus\u201d is the starting point to give his art the existential span of a vital phenomenon. Look into [[New York City]] sky the evolution of a giant octopus. What will be the reaction of people around a corner? Imagination takes power among the skyscrapers of [[Wall Street]], caresses the [[Statue of Liberty]]. More than art in freedom, Machado tries to grab our interest in our essential freedom of being.

Machado is indeed a message bearer. He conceived a whole program of interventions, from which \u201cOctopus\u201d is the starting point to give his art the existential span of a vital phenomenon. Look into [[New York City]] sky the evolution of a giant octopus. What will be the reaction of people around a corner? Imagination takes power among the skyscrapers of [[Wall Street]], caresses the [[Statue of Liberty]]. More than art in freedom, Machado tries to grab our interest in our essential freedom of being. His dream, if we share it, is a call to order, to existential order, to the law of the great nature.\u201d\n\n== S\u00e3o Paulo Project ==\n<gallery>\nFile:20_Bienal_Internacional_de_S\u00e3o_Paulo.jpg|[http://issuu.com/bienal/docs/nameb88904 20a Bienal Internacional de S\u00e3o Paulo]\nFile:Disco_-_1989.jpg| [http://issuu.com/bienal/docs/nameb88904 Projeto S\u00e3o Paulo - 1989],p.77\nFile:\" Um sonho e uma chamda a ordem\".jpg| [http://issuu.com/bienal/docs/nameb88904 Projeto S\u00e3o Paulo - 1989],p.77\nFile:Cleber_e_Pierre.jpg|[[Pierre Restany]]\n</gallery>\n\n'''An UFO in S\u00e3o Paulo'''<br>\n\nTo be presented in the Special Events of [https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bienal_Internacional_de_Arte_de_S%C3%A3o_Paulo#20%C2%AA_Bienal_de_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_(1989) 20th International Biennial of S\u00e3o Paulo] ([[1989]]), Cleber Machado prepares an urban interference from outer world.

The chieftaincy in Trincomalee was at times incorporated into the northern Kingdom. Hence Vannimais just south of the Jaffna peninsula and in the eastern Trincomalee district usually paid an annual tribute to the Jaffna Kingdom instead of taxes.

The scheme allotted up to 40% of the university placement to rural youth (primarily from Sinhalese areas). The government claimed that this was an [[affirmative action]] scheme to assist geographically disadvantaged students to gain tertiary education. According to [[K.

Two years later, in 1975, all Tamil political parties merged and became known as the [[Tamil United Liberation Front]] (TULF). In 1976, the first national convention of the [[Tamil United Liberation Front]] was held at [[Vaddukoddai]], where the party adopted a unanimous resolution called the Vaddukodai Resolution. This resolution charged that the Sinhalese government, with the use of the constitution of 1972, had used its power to \"deprive the Tamil nation of its territory, language, citizenship, economic life, opportunities of employment and education thereby destroying all the attributes of nationhood of the Tamil people.\" The resolution further called for the \"Free, Sovereign, Secular Socialist State of TAMIL EELAM\".<ref name=Pfaffenberger1981>{{cite journal\n | author = Pfaffenberger, B.\n | year = 1981\n | title = The Cultural Dimension of Tamil Separatism in Sri Lanka\n | journal = Asian Survey\n | volume = 21\n | issue = 11\n | pages = 1145\u20131157\n | doi = 10.1525/as.1981.21.11.01p0322p\n| jstor=2643999\n}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the Vaddukodai resolution, the Tamil United Liberation Front became the first Tamil political party to run its campaign on a separatist platform.

The District Development Councils scheme was based, to some extent, on decentralization of the government within a united Sri Lanka.

The region is subdivided into three sections, the North, the East where the majority of the native Tamils live, and the northern part of the Puthalam district which had a large Tamil influence in the pre-colonial times.\n\n===North===\nThe Northern province is 22 miles (35&nbsp;km) south of the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. The [[Adam's Bridge]] (Sethu Bridge) is located between the waters of the Mannar islet and the Indian mainland. The North is surrounded by the [[Gulf of Mannar]] and Palk Bay to the west, [[Palk Strait]] to the north, the [[Bay of Bengal]] to the east and the Eastern, North Central and North Western provinces to the south. It has a total area of 8,884 square kilometers (3,430.1 sq mi).\n\nIt is divided into two distinct geographic areas: [[Jaffna peninsula]] and the central [[Vanni region]].\n\nThe Jaffna peninsula has a number of bays and lagoons along its coastline and much of the coast consists of sandy beaches. A chain of both inhabited and uninhabited islands are also found along the Jaffna peninsula.\n\nThe sparsely populated Vanni region is covered in tropical forests with numerous rivers flowing through them, making agriculture and forestry the primary industry in the area. The dry-land forests house rare species of trees, such as the satinwood, ebony, ironwood, and mahogany.\n\n===East===\nThe Eastern part of the Tamil Eelam has an area of 9,996 square kilometers (3,859.5 sq mi). The Area is surrounded by land to the north, the Bay of Bengal to the east, and the central highlands to its west, south and southwest.\n\nThe Eastern coast is dominated by lagoons, the largest being the [[Batticaloa Lagoon]], [[Kokkilai Lagoon]], [[Upaar Lagoon]] and [[Ullackalie Lagoon]]s.\n\nMuch of the coastline has a number of inlets from the sea, making them excellent inland ports and fishing harbours. The East has a rich biodiversity and is the natural habitat to many species.\n\n==Political divisions and demographics==\n[[File:Firewood selling, Batticaloa.JPG|200 px|thumb|Fire-wood sellers in Batticaloa district]]\n\nFollowing the declaration of independence, which saw large scale movements of people in search of better economic opportunities, and the [[Sri Lankan state sponsored colonisation schemes|state sponsored Sinhalese colonization]] of Tamil territories, the demographics of the state had been heavily altered.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe three decade long [[Civil war]] that followed the anti-Tamil policies further affected the North and the East with over 80,000\u2013100,000 people estimated to have been killed and over 400,000 Tamils fleeing their homes. Many people still live in IDP camps in the North and the East and the present-day demographics of the region has been changing due to more and more Sinhalese settling in these territories.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The alliance is the largest Tamil political party in Sri Lanka. It has had two manifestos since 2001. The policies are based on what is known as the Thimpu principles amongst Tamil nationalists. They are\n\n*Recognition of the Tamils of Sri Lanka as a distinct nationality.\n*Recognition of an identified Tamil homeland and guarantee of its territorial integrity.\n*Based on the above, recognition of the inalienable right of self-determination of the Tamil nation.\n*Recognition of the right to full citizenship and other fundamental democratic rights of all Tamils who look upon the island as their country.'\n\nFurther the alliance stands for:\n\n*The immediate lifting of the economic embargo currently in force in parts of the northeast province\n*The withdrawal of the residential and travel restrictions foisted on the Tamil nationality\n*The immediate cessation of the war being currently waged in the northeast\n\nThree of its sitting Members of the Parliament K.

The region is subdivided into three sections, the North, the East where the majority of the native Tamils live, and the northern part of the Puthalam district which had a large Tamil influence in the pre-colonial times.\n\n===North===\nThe Northern province is 22 miles (35&nbsp;km) south of the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. The [[Adam's Bridge]] (Sethu Bridge) is located between the waters of the Mannar islet and the Indian mainland. The North is surrounded by the [[Gulf of Mannar]] and Palk Bay to the west, [[Palk Strait]] to the north, the [[Bay of Bengal]] to the east and the Eastern, North Central and North Western provinces to the south. It has a total area of 8,884 square kilometers (3,430.1 sq mi).\n\nIt is divided into two distinct geographic areas: [[Jaffna peninsula]] and the central [[Vanni region]].\n\nThe Jaffna peninsula has a number of bays and lagoons along its coastline and much of the coast consists of sandy beaches. A chain of both inhabited and uninhabited islands are also found along the Jaffna peninsula.\n\nThe sparsely populated Vanni region is covered in tropical forests with numerous rivers flowing through them, making agriculture and forestry the primary industry in the area. The dry-land forests house rare species of trees, such as the satinwood, ebony, ironwood, and mahogany.\n\n===East===\nThe Eastern part of the Tamil Eelam has an area of 9,996 square kilometers (3,859.5 sq mi). The Area is surrounded by land to the north, the Bay of Bengal to the east, and the central highlands to its west, south and southwest.\n\nThe Eastern coast is dominated by lagoons, the largest being the [[Batticaloa Lagoon]], [[Kokkilai Lagoon]], [[Upaar Lagoon]] and [[Ullackalie Lagoon]]s.\n\nMuch of the coastline has a number of inlets from the sea, making them excellent inland ports and fishing harbours. The East has a rich biodiversity and is the natural habitat to many species.\n\n==Political divisions and demographics==\n[[File:Firewood selling, Batticaloa.JPG|200 px|thumb|Fire-wood sellers in Batticaloa district]]\n\nFollowing the declaration of independence, which saw large scale movements of people in search of better economic opportunities, and the [[Sri Lankan state sponsored colonisation schemes|state sponsored Sinhalese colonization]] of Tamil territories, the demographics of the state had been heavily altered.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe three decade long [[Civil war]] that followed the anti-Tamil policies further affected the North and the East with over 80,000\u2013100,000 people estimated to have been killed and over 400,000 Tamils fleeing their homes. Many people still live in IDP camps in the North and the East and the present-day demographics of the region has been changing due to more and more Sinhalese settling in these territories.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They are\n\n*Recognition of the Tamils of Sri Lanka as a distinct nationality.\n*Recognition of an identified Tamil homeland and guarantee of its territorial integrity.\n*Based on the above, recognition of the inalienable right of self-determination of the Tamil nation.\n*Recognition of the right to full citizenship and other fundamental democratic rights of all Tamils who look upon the island as their country.'\n\nFurther the alliance stands for:\n\n*The immediate lifting of the economic embargo currently in force in parts of the northeast province\n*The withdrawal of the residential and travel restrictions foisted on the Tamil nationality\n*The immediate cessation of the war being currently waged in the northeast\n\nThree of its sitting Members of the Parliament K.

Pharaoh orders the Israelites to leave, taking whatever they want, and asks Moses to bless him in the name of the Lord.\n\n== Composition and theology ==\nScholars are in broad agreement that the publication of the Torah took place in the mid-Persian period (the 5th century BCE).{{sfn|Romer|2008|p=2 and fn.3}} The [[Book of Deuteronomy]], composed in stages between the 7th and 6th centuries, mentions the \"diseases of Egypt\" (Deuteronomy 7:15 and 28:60) but refers to something that afflicted the Israelites, not the Egyptians, and never specifies the plagues.{{sfn|Rogerson|2003b|p=154}}{{sfn|Van Seters|2015|p=124}} \n\nThe traditional number of ten plagues is not actually mentioned in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], and other sources differ; [[Psalm 78|Psalms 78]] and [[Psalm 105|105]] seem to list only seven or eight plagues and order them differently.{{sfn|Greifenhagen|2000|p=1062}} It appears that originally there were only seven (which included the tenth), to which were added the third, sixth, and ninth, bringing the count to ten.{{sfn|Johnstone|2003|p=83-84}} \n\nIn this final version, the first nine plagues form three triads, each of which God introduces by informing Moses of the main lesson it will teach.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=117}} In the first triad, the Egyptians begin to experience the power of God;{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=118}} in the second, God demonstrates that he is directing events;{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=119}} and in the third, the incomparability of Yahweh is displayed.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=121}} Overall, the plagues are \"signs and marvels\" given by the God of Israel to answer Pharaoh's taunt that he does not know Yahweh: \"The Egyptians shall know that I am the {{LORD}}.\"{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=117}}\n star wars\n\n== Historicity ==\n{{main|Historicity of the Bible}}\nScholars broadly agree that the Exodus is not a historical account, and that the Israelites originated in [[Canaan]] and from the [[Canaanites]].{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=81}}{{sfn|Meyers|2005|pp=6\u20137}} The [[Ipuwer Papyrus]], written probably in the late [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt]] (c. 1991\u20131803 BCE),{{sfn|Willems|2010|p=83}} has been put forward in popular literature as confirmation of the Biblical account, most notably because of its statement that \"the river is blood\" and its frequent references to servants running away; however, these arguments ignore the many points on which Ipuwer contradicts Exodus, such as Asiatics arriving in Egypt rather than leaving and the likelihood that the \"river is blood\" phrase is simply a poetic image of turmoil.{{sfn|Enmarch|2011|p=173-175}} Attempts to find natural explanations for the plagues (e.g., a volcanic eruption to explain the \"darkness\" plague) have been dismissed by biblical scholars on the grounds that their pattern, timing, rapid succession, and above all, control by Moses mark them as [[supernatural]].{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=90}}{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=117-118}}\n\n== Artistic representation ==\n===Visual art===\n[[File:Lamentations over the Death of the First-Born of Egypt by Charles Sprague Pearce.JPG|thumb|right|''Lamentations over the Death of the First-Born of Egypt'' by [[Charles Sprague Pearce]] (1877)]]\nIn visual art, the plagues have generally been reserved for works in series, especially engravings. Still, relatively few depictions in art emerged compared to other religious themes until the 19th century, when the plagues became more common subjects, with [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] and [[J. M. W. Turner|Joseph Turner]] producing notable canvases. This trend probably reflected a Romantic attraction to landscape and nature painting, for which the plagues were suited, a Gothic attraction to morbid stories, and a rise in Orientalism, wherein exotic Egyptian themes found currency. Given the importance of noble patronage throughout Western art history, the plagues may have found consistent disfavor because the stories emphasize the limits of a monarch's power, and images of lice, locusts, darkness, and boils were ill-suited for decoration in palaces and churches.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Music===\nTaking direct inspiration from the ten plagues, [[Iced Earth|Iced Earth's]] eleventh studio album ''[[Plagues of Babylon]]'' contains many references and allusions to the plagues. [[Metallica|Metallica's]] song \"[[Creeping Death]]\" (from their second album, ''[[Ride the Lightning]]'') makes references to a few of the plagues, in addition to the rest of the story of the Exodus.\nPerhaps the most successful artistic representation of the plagues is [[George Frideric Handel|Handel's]] oratorio ''[[Israel in Egypt]]'', which, like his perennial favorite, \"[[Handel's Messiah|Messiah]]\", takes a libretto entirely from scripture. The work was especially popular in the 19th century because of its numerous choruses, generally one for each plague, and its playful musical depiction of the plagues. For example, the plague of frogs is performed as a light aria for alto, depicting frogs jumping in the violins, and the plague of flies and lice is a light chorus with fast scurrying runs in the violins.{{sfn|Leon|2011|p=unpaginated}} \n\n===Films===\n* ''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1923)\n* ''[[The Moon of Israel]]'' (1924)\n* ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956)\n* ''[[The Abominable Dr. Phibes]]'' (1971)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066740/trivia|title=The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971) \u2013 Did You Know?|publisher=imdb.com|quote=Dr. Phibes murders were inspired by the 10 plagues of Egypt found in the Old Testament|accessdate=September 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123013207/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066740/trivia|archive-date=January 23, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[Moses (film)|Moses]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (1998)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120794/|title=The Prince of Egypt|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=September 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930002040/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120794/|archive-date=September 30, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'' (1999)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175880/faq|title=FAQ for Magnolia (1999)|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=September 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321002323/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175880/faq|archive-date=March 21, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[The Mummy (1999 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1999)<ref>{{Citation|last=Sommers|first=Stephen|title=The Mummy|date=1999-05-07|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120616/|others=Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah|accessdate=2018-04-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705083230/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120616/|archive-date=July 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[The Reaping]]'' (2007)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0444682/|title=The Reaping|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=September 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906061903/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0444682/|archive-date=September 6, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[Exodus: Gods and Kings]]'' (2014)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1528100/|title=Exodus: Gods and Kings|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=December 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212072407/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1528100/|archive-date=December 12, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[Seder-Masochism]]'' (2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8328612/|title=Seder-Masochism|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=April 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190908191309/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8328612/|archive-date=September 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===TV===\n* ''[[The Bible (miniseries)|The Bible]]'' (2013 miniseries) \u2013 Episode 2 has a scene of these plagues.\n* ''[[Os Dez Mandamentos]]'' (2015)<ref>{{cite web|last=Gomes|first=Marta|url=http://ndonline.com.br/florianopolis/plural/242270-tudo-pronto-para-a-estreia-de-os-dez-mandamentos.html|title=Tudo pronto para a estreia de \"Os Dez Mandamentos\"|publisher=Not\u00edcias do dia (Grupo RIC)|date=March 17, 2015|accessdate=March 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306194805/http://ndonline.com.br/florianopolis/plural/242270-tudo-pronto-para-a-estreia-de-os-dez-mandamentos.html|archive-date=March 6, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* \"[[A Rugrats Passover]]\"\n* \"[[Simpsons Bible Stories]]\"\n* ''[[Family Guy]]'' \u2013 In the [[Family Guy (season 2)|second season]] episode \"[[If I'm Dyin', I'm Lyin']]\", the Griffin family is affected by most of the plagues due to Peter being worshiped like God.\n* ''[[Haven (TV series)|Haven]]'' \u2013 In \"A Tale of Two Audreys,\" the town of Haven is afflicted by almost all of the plagues of Egypt.\n\n==Image gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:Aaron points his rod at the river and it begins to flow with Wellcome V0034268.jpg|The Second Plague: \"Frogs came up and covered the Sand of Egypt''\nFile:William de Brailes - The Third Plague of Egypt - Gnats (Exodus 8 -17) - Walters W1065R - Full Page.jpg|The Third Plague:\nFile:Tissot The Plague of Flies.jpg|The Fourth Plague: ''The Plague of Flies'', [[James Jacques Joseph Tissot]], Jewish Museum, New York\nFile:033.The Fifth Plague.

Pharaoh orders the Israelites to leave, taking whatever they want, and asks Moses to bless him in the name of the Lord.\n\n== Composition and theology ==\nScholars are in broad agreement that the publication of the Torah took place in the mid-Persian period (the 5th century BCE).{{sfn|Romer|2008|p=2 and fn.3}} The [[Book of Deuteronomy]], composed in stages between the 7th and 6th centuries, mentions the \"diseases of Egypt\" (Deuteronomy 7:15 and 28:60) but refers to something that afflicted the Israelites, not the Egyptians, and never specifies the plagues.{{sfn|Rogerson|2003b|p=154}}{{sfn|Van Seters|2015|p=124}} \n\nThe traditional number of ten plagues is not actually mentioned in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], and other sources differ; [[Psalm 78|Psalms 78]] and [[Psalm 105|105]] seem to list only seven or eight plagues and order them differently.{{sfn|Greifenhagen|2000|p=1062}} It appears that originally there were only seven (which included the tenth), to which were added the third, sixth, and ninth, bringing the count to ten.{{sfn|Johnstone|2003|p=83-84}} \n\nIn this final version, the first nine plagues form three triads, each of which God introduces by informing Moses of the main lesson it will teach.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=117}} In the first triad, the Egyptians begin to experience the power of God;{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=118}} in the second, God demonstrates that he is directing events;{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=119}} and in the third, the incomparability of Yahweh is displayed.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=121}} Overall, the plagues are \"signs and marvels\" given by the God of Israel to answer Pharaoh's taunt that he does not know Yahweh: \"The Egyptians shall know that I am the {{LORD}}.\"{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=117}}\n\n== Historicity ==\n{{main|Historicity of the Bible}}\nScholars broadly agree that the Exodus is not a historical account, and that the Israelites originated in [[Canaan]] and from the [[Canaanites]].{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=81}}{{sfn|Meyers|2005|pp=6\u20137}} The [[Ipuwer Papyrus]], written probably in the late [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt]] (c. 1991\u20131803 BCE),{{sfn|Willems|2010|p=83}} has been put forward in popular literature as confirmation of the Biblical account, most notably because of its statement that \"the river is blood\" and its frequent references to servants running away; however, these arguments ignore the many points on which Ipuwer contradicts Exodus, such as Asiatics arriving in Egypt rather than leaving and the likelihood that the \"river is blood\" phrase is simply a poetic image of turmoil.{{sfn|Enmarch|2011|p=173-175}} Attempts to find natural explanations for the plagues (e.g., a volcanic eruption to explain the \"darkness\" plague) have been dismissed by biblical scholars on the grounds that their pattern, timing, rapid succession, and above all, control by Moses mark them as [[supernatural]].{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=90}}{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=117-118}}\n\n== Artistic representation ==\n===Visual art===\n[[File:Lamentations over the Death of the First-Born of Egypt by Charles Sprague Pearce.JPG|thumb|right|''Lamentations over the Death of the First-Born of Egypt'' by [[Charles Sprague Pearce]] (1877)]]\nIn visual art, the plagues have generally been reserved for works in series, especially engravings. Still, relatively few depictions in art emerged compared to other religious themes until the 19th century, when the plagues became more common subjects, with [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] and [[J. M. W. Turner|Joseph Turner]] producing notable canvases. This trend probably reflected a Romantic attraction to landscape and nature painting, for which the plagues were suited, a Gothic attraction to morbid stories, and a rise in Orientalism, wherein exotic Egyptian themes found currency. Given the importance of noble patronage throughout Western art history, the plagues may have found consistent disfavor because the stories emphasize the limits of a monarch's power, and images of lice, locusts, darkness, and boils were ill-suited for decoration in palaces and churches.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Music===\nTaking direct inspiration from the ten plagues, [[Iced Earth|Iced Earth's]] eleventh studio album ''[[Plagues of Babylon]]'' contains many references and allusions to the plagues. [[Metallica|Metallica's]] song \"[[Creeping Death]]\" (from their second album, ''[[Ride the Lightning]]'') makes references to a few of the plagues, in addition to the rest of the story of the Exodus.\nPerhaps the most successful artistic representation of the plagues is [[George Frideric Handel|Handel's]] oratorio ''[[Israel in Egypt]]'', which, like his perennial favorite, \"[[Handel's Messiah|Messiah]]\", takes a libretto entirely from scripture. The work was especially popular in the 19th century because of its numerous choruses, generally one for each plague, and its playful musical depiction of the plagues. For example, the plague of frogs is performed as a light aria for alto, depicting frogs jumping in the violins, and the plague of flies and lice is a light chorus with fast scurrying runs in the violins.{{sfn|Leon|2011|p=unpaginated}} \n\n===Films===\n* ''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1923)\n* ''[[The Moon of Israel]]'' (1924)\n* ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956)\n* ''[[The Abominable Dr. Phibes]]'' (1971)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066740/trivia|title=The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971) \u2013 Did You Know?|publisher=imdb.com|quote=Dr. Phibes murders were inspired by the 10 plagues of Egypt found in the Old Testament|accessdate=September 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123013207/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066740/trivia|archive-date=January 23, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[Moses (film)|Moses]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (1998)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120794/|title=The Prince of Egypt|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=September 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930002040/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120794/|archive-date=September 30, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'' (1999)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175880/faq|title=FAQ for Magnolia (1999)|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=September 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321002323/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175880/faq|archive-date=March 21, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[The Mummy (1999 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1999)<ref>{{Citation|last=Sommers|first=Stephen|title=The Mummy|date=1999-05-07|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120616/|others=Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah|accessdate=2018-04-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705083230/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120616/|archive-date=July 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[The Reaping]]'' (2007)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0444682/|title=The Reaping|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=September 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906061903/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0444682/|archive-date=September 6, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[Exodus: Gods and Kings]]'' (2014)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1528100/|title=Exodus: Gods and Kings|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=December 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212072407/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1528100/|archive-date=December 12, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[Seder-Masochism]]'' (2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8328612/|title=Seder-Masochism|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=April 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190908191309/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8328612/|archive-date=September 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===TV===\n* ''[[The Bible (miniseries)|The Bible]]'' (2013 miniseries) \u2013 Episode 2 has a scene of these plagues.\n* ''[[Os Dez Mandamentos]]'' (2015)<ref>{{cite web|last=Gomes|first=Marta|url=http://ndonline.com.br/florianopolis/plural/242270-tudo-pronto-para-a-estreia-de-os-dez-mandamentos.html|title=Tudo pronto para a estreia de \"Os Dez Mandamentos\"|publisher=Not\u00edcias do dia (Grupo RIC)|date=March 17, 2015|accessdate=March 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306194805/http://ndonline.com.br/florianopolis/plural/242270-tudo-pronto-para-a-estreia-de-os-dez-mandamentos.html|archive-date=March 6, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* \"[[A Rugrats Passover]]\"\n* \"[[Simpsons Bible Stories]]\"\n* ''[[Family Guy]]'' \u2013 In the [[Family Guy (season 2)|second season]] episode \"[[If I'm Dyin', I'm Lyin']]\", the Griffin family is affected by most of the plagues due to Peter being worshiped like God.\n* ''[[Haven (TV series)|Haven]]'' \u2013 In \"A Tale of Two Audreys,\" the town of Haven is afflicted by almost all of the plagues of Egypt.\n\n==Image gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:Aaron points his rod at the river and it begins to flow with Wellcome V0034268.jpg|The Second Plague: \"Frogs came up and covered the Sand of Egypt''\nFile:William de Brailes - The Third Plague of Egypt - Gnats (Exodus 8 -17) - Walters W1065R - Full Page.jpg|The Third Plague:\nFile:Tissot The Plague of Flies.jpg|The Fourth Plague: ''The Plague of Flies'', [[James Jacques Joseph Tissot]], Jewish Museum, New York\nFile:033.The Fifth Plague.
