In many languages also using a word derived from the Greek, the form used is the one closest to ''trapezium'', not to ''trapezoid'' (e.g. French ''trap\u00e8ze'', Italian ''trapezio'', Portuguese ''trap\u00e9zio'', Spanish ''trapecio'', German ''Trapez'', Ukrainian \"\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0456\u044f\").\n\n===''Trapezium'' vs ''Trapezoid''===\nThe term ''trapezoid'' was once defined as a quadrilateral without any parallel sides in Britain and elsewhere. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) says \"Often called by English writers in the 19th century\".<ref name=\"oed\">''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' entries for trapezoid and trapezium.</ref> According to the OED, the sense of a figure with no sides parallel is the meaning for which Proclus introduced the term \"trapezoid\". This is retained in the French ''trap\u00e9zo\u00efde'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/trap%C3%A9zo%C3%AFde/79256|title=Larousse definition for trap\u00e9zo\u00efde}}</ref> German ''Trapezoid'', and in other languages. However, this particular sense is considered obsolete.\n\nA ''trapezium'' in Proclus' sense is a quadrilateral having one pair of its opposite sides parallel. This was the specific sense in England in the 17th and 18th centuries, and again the prevalent one in recent use outside North America. A trapezium as any quadrilateral more general than a [[parallelogram]] is the sense of the term in [[Euclid]].\n\nConfusingly, the word ''trapezium'' was sometimes used in England from c. 1800 to c. 1875, to denote an irregular quadrilateral having no sides parallel. This is now obsolete in England, but continues in North America. However this shape is more usually (and less confusingly) just called an irregular quadrilateral.<ref>[http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/features/chref/chref.py/main?xref=21C44644&title=21st&query=trapezoid ''Chambers 21st Century Dictionary'' Trapezoid]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trapezium |title=1913 American definition of trapezium |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref>\n\n==Inclusive vs exclusive definition==\nThere is some disagreement whether [[parallelogram]]s, which have two pairs of parallel sides, should be regarded as trapezoids.

Retrieved 2012-02-24.</ref>), making the parallelogram a special type of trapezoid. The latter definition is consistent with its uses in higher mathematics such as [[calculus]].  This article uses the inclusive definition and considers parallelograms as special cases of a trapezoid. This is also advocated in the [[Quadrilateral#Taxonomy|taxonomy of quadrilaterals]].\n\nUnder the inclusive definition, all parallelograms (including [[rhombus]]es, [[rectangle]]s and [[Square (geometry)|square]]s) are trapezoids. Rectangles have mirror symmetry on mid-edges; rhombuses have mirror symmetry on vertices, while squares have mirror symmetry on both mid-edges and vertices.\n\n==Special cases==\n[[File:Trapezoid special cases.png|280px|thumb|Trapezoid special cases.  The orange figures also qualify as parallelograms.]]\n\nA '''right trapezoid''' (also called ''right-angled trapezoid'') has two adjacent [[right angles]].<ref name=Mathworld/> Right trapezoids are used in the [[trapezoidal rule]] for estimating areas under a curve.\n\nAn '''acute trapezoid''' has two adjacent acute angles on its longer ''base'' edge, while an '''obtuse trapezoid''' has one acute and one obtuse angle on each ''base''.\n\nAn '''[[isosceles trapezoid]]''' is a trapezoid where the base angles have the same measure. As a consequence the two legs are also of equal length and it has [[reflection symmetry]].  This is possible for acute trapezoids or right trapezoids (rectangles).\n\nA '''[[parallelogram]]''' is a trapezoid with two pairs of parallel sides. A parallelogram has central 2-fold [[rotational symmetry]] (or [[point reflection]] symmetry).  It is possible for obtuse trapezoids or right trapezoids (rectangles).\n\nA '''[[tangential trapezoid]]''' is a trapezoid that has an [[Tangential quadrilateral|incircle]].\n\nA [[Saccheri quadrilateral]] is similar to a trapezoid in the hyperbolic plane, with two adjacent right angles, while it is a rectangle in the Euclidean plane. A [[Lambert quadrilateral]] in the hyperbolic plane has 3 right angles.\n\n==Condition of existence==\nFour lengths ''a'', ''c'', ''b'', ''d'' can constitute the consecutive sides of a non-parallelogram trapezoid with ''a'' and ''b'' parallel only when<ref>''Ask Dr. Math'' (2008), [http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/72738.html \"Area of Trapezoid Given Only the Side Lengths\"].</ref>\n:<math>\\displaystyle |d-c| < |b-a| < d+c.</math>\n\nThe quadrilateral is a parallelogram when <math>d-c = b-a = 0</math>, but it is an [[ex-tangential quadrilateral]] (which is not a trapezoid) when <math>|d-c| = |b-a| \\neq 0</math>.<ref name=Josefsson/>{{rp|p. 35}}\n\n==Characterizations==\nGiven a convex quadrilateral, the following properties are equivalent, and each implies that the quadrilateral is a trapezoid:\n*It has two adjacent [[angle]]s that are [[supplementary angles|supplementary]], that is, they add up to 180 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s.\n*The angle between a side and a diagonal is equal to the angle between the opposite side and the same diagonal.\n*The [[diagonal]]s cut each other in mutually the same [[ratio]] (this ratio is the same as that between the lengths of the parallel sides).\n*The diagonals cut the quadrilateral into four triangles of which one opposite pair are [[similarity (geometry)|similar]].\n*The diagonals cut the quadrilateral into four triangles of which one opposite pair have equal areas.<ref name=Josefsson>Martin Josefsson, [http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2013volume13/FG201305.pdf \"Characterizations of trapezoids\"], Forum Geometricorum, 13 (2013) 23-35.</ref>{{rp|Prop.5}}\n*The product of the areas of the two triangles formed by one diagonal equals the product of the areas of the two triangles formed by the other diagonal.<ref name=Josefsson/>{{rp|Thm.6}}\n*The areas ''S'' and ''T'' of some two opposite triangles of the four triangles formed by the diagonals satisfy the equation\n\n::<math>\\sqrt{K}=\\sqrt{S}+\\sqrt{T},</math>\n\n:where ''K'' is the area of the quadrilateral.<ref name=\"Josefsson\" />{{rp|Thm.8}}\n\n*The midpoints of two opposite sides and the intersection of the diagonals are [[collinear]].<ref name=\"Josefsson\" />{{rp|Thm.15}}\n*The angles in the quadrilateral ''ABCD'' satisfy <math>\\sin A\\sin C=\\sin B\\sin D.</math><ref name=Josefsson/>{{rp|p. 25}}\n*The cosines of two adjacent angles sum to 0, as do the cosines of the other two angles.<ref name=Josefsson/>{{rp|p. 25}}\n*The cotangents of two adjacent angles sum to 0, as do the cotangents of the other two adjacent angles.<ref name=Josefsson/>{{rp|p. 26}}\n*One bimedian divides the quadrilateral into two quadrilaterals of equal areas.<ref name=Josefsson/>{{rp|p. 26}}\n*Twice the length of the bimedian connecting the midpoints of two opposite sides equals the sum of the lengths of the other sides.<ref name=Josefsson/>{{rp|p. 31}}\n\nAdditionally, the following properties are equivalent, and each implies that opposite sides ''a'' and ''b'' are parallel:\n* The consecutive sides ''a'', ''c'', ''b'', ''d'' and the diagonals ''p'', ''q'' satisfy the equation<ref name=\"Josefsson\" />{{rp|Cor.11}}\n::<math>p^2+q^2=c^2+d^2+2ab.</math>\n\n*The distance ''v'' between the midpoints of the diagonals satisfies the equation<ref name=\"Josefsson\" />{{rp|Thm.12}}\n::<math>v=\\frac{|a-b|}{2}.</math>\n\n==Midsegment and height==\nThe ''midsegment'' (also called the median or midline) of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the [[midpoint]]s of the legs. It is parallel to the bases. Its length ''m'' is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases ''a'' and ''b'' of the trapezoid,<ref name=Mathworld/>\n:<math>m = \\frac{a + b}{2}.</math>\n\nThe midsegment of a trapezoid is one of the two [[Quadrilateral#Special line segments|bimedian]]s (the other bimedian divides the trapezoid into equal areas).\n\nThe ''height'' (or altitude) is the [[perpendicular]] distance between the bases. In the case that the two bases have different lengths (''a'' \u2260 ''b''), the height of a trapezoid ''h'' can be determined by the length of its four sides using the formula<ref name=Mathworld/>\n:<math>h= \\frac{\\sqrt{(-a+b+c+d)(a-b+c+d)(a-b+c-d)(a-b-c+d)}}{2|b-a|}</math>\n\nwhere ''c''= and ''d'' are the lengths of the legs.\n\n==Area==\nThe area ''K'' of a trapezoid is given by<ref name=Mathworld/>\n:<math>K = \\frac{a + b}{2} \\cdot h = mh</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are the lengths of the parallel sides, ''h'' is the height (the perpendicular distance between these sides), and ''m'' is the [[arithmetic mean]] of the lengths of the two parallel sides.  In 499 AD [[Aryabhata]], a great [[mathematician]]-[[astronomer]] from the classical age of [[Indian mathematics]] and [[Indian astronomy]], used this method in the ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' (section 2.8). This yields as a [[special case]] the well-known formula for the area of a [[triangle]], by considering a triangle as a degenerate trapezoid in which one of the parallel sides has shrunk to a point.\n\nThe 7th-century Indian mathematician [[Bh\u0101skara I]] derived the following formula for the area of a trapezoid with consecutive sides ''a'', ''c'', ''b'', ''d'':\n:<math>K=\\frac{1}{2}(a+b)\\sqrt{c^2-\\frac{1}{4}\\left((b-a)+\\frac{c^2-d^2}{b-a}\\right)^2}</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are parallel and ''b'' > ''a''.<ref>T.

(This formula is similar to [[Brahmagupta's formula]], but it differs from it, in that a trapezoid might not be [[cyclic quadrilateral|cyclic]] (inscribed in a circle). The formula is also a special case of [[Bretschneider's formula]] for a general [[quadrilateral]]).\n\nFrom Bretschneider's formula, it follows that\n:<math>K= \\sqrt{\\frac{(ab^2-a^2 b-ad^2+bc^2)(ab^2-a^2 b-ac^2+bd^2)}{(2(b-a))^2} - \\left(\\frac{b^2+d^2-a^2-c^2}{4}\\right)^2}.</math>\n\nThe line that joins the midpoints of the parallel sides, bisects the area.\n\n==Diagonals==\n[[File:Trapezium.svg|200px|right]]\nThe lengths of the diagonals are<ref name=Mathworld/>\n:<math>p= \\sqrt{\\frac{ab^2-a^2b-ac^2+bd^2}{b-a}},</math>\n:<math>q= \\sqrt{\\frac{ab^2-a^2b-ad^2+bc^2}{b-a}}</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' is the short base, ''b'' is the long base, and ''c'' and ''d'' are the trapezoid legs.\n\nIf the trapezoid is divided into four triangles by its diagonals ''AC'' and ''BD'' (as shown on the right), intersecting at ''O'', then the area of {{trianglenotation|AOD}} is equal to that of {{trianglenotation|BOC}}, and the product of the areas of {{trianglenotation|AOD}} and {{trianglenotation|BOC}} is equal to that of {{trianglenotation|AOB}} and {{trianglenotation|COD}}.

In many languages also using a word derived from the Greek, the form used is the one closest to ''trapezium'', not to ''trapezoid'' (e.g. French ''trap\u00e8ze'', Italian ''trapezio'', Portuguese ''trap\u00e9zio'', Spanish ''trapecio'', German ''Trapez'', Ukrainian \"\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0456\u044f\").\n\n===''Trapezium'' vs ''Trapezoid''===\nThe term ''trapezoid'' was once defined as a quadrilateral without any parallel sides in Britain and elsewhere. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) says \"Often called by English writers in the 19th century\".<ref name=\"oed\">''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' entries for trapezoid and trapezium.</ref> According to the OED, the sense of a figure with no sides parallel is the meaning for which Proclus introduced the term \"trapezoid\". This is retained in the French ''trap\u00e9zo\u00efde'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/trap%C3%A9zo%C3%AFde/79256|title=Larousse definition for trap\u00e9zo\u00efde}}</ref> German ''Trapezoid'', and in other languages. However, this particular sense is considered obsolete.\n\nA ''trapezium'' in Proclus' sense is a quadrilateral having one pair of its opposite sides parallel. This was the specific sense in England in the 17th and 18th centuries, and again the prevalent one in recent use outside North America. A trapezium as any quadrilateral more general than a [[parallelogram]] is the sense of the term in [[Euclid]].\n\nConfusingly, the word ''trapezium'' was sometimes used in England from c. 1800 to c. 1875, to denote an irregular quadrilateral having no sides parallel. This is now obsolete in England, but continues in North America. However this shape is more usually (and less confusingly) just called an irregular quadrilateral.<ref>[http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/features/chref/chref.py/main?xref=21C44644&title=21st&query=trapezoid ''Chambers 21st Century Dictionary'' Trapezoid]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trapezium |title=1913 American definition of trapezium |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref>\n\n==Inclusive vs exclusive definition==\nThere is some disagreement whether [[parallelogram]]s, which have two pairs of parallel sides, should be regarded as trapezoids. Some define a trapezoid as a quadrilateral having ''only'' one pair of parallel sides (the exclusive definition), thereby excluding parallelograms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.math.com/school/glossary/defs/trapezoid.html |title=American School definition from \"math.com\" |accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref> Others<ref name=Mathworld>{{MathWorld |title=Trapezoid |urlname=Trapezoid}}</ref> define a trapezoid as a quadrilateral with ''at least'' one pair of parallel sides (the inclusive definition<ref>Trapezoids, [http://www.math.washington.edu/~king/coursedir/m444a00/syl/class/trapezoids/Trapezoids.html]. Retrieved 2012-02-24.</ref>), making the parallelogram a special type of trapezoid. The latter definition is consistent with its uses in higher mathematics such as [[calculus]].  This article uses the inclusive definition and considers parallelograms as special cases of a trapezoid. This is also advocated in the [[Quadrilateral#Taxonomy|taxonomy of quadrilaterals]].\n\nUnder the inclusive definition, all parallelograms (including [[rhombus]]es, [[rectangle]]s and [[Square (geometry)|square]]s) are trapezoids. Rectangles have mirror symmetry on mid-edges; rhombuses have mirror symmetry on vertices, while squares have mirror symmetry on both mid-edges and vertices.\n\n==Special cases==\n[[File:Trapezoid special cases.png|280px|thumb|Trapezoid special cases.  The orange figures also qualify as parallelograms.]]\n\nA '''right trapezoid''' (also called ''right-angled trapezoid'') has two adjacent [[right angles]].<ref name=Mathworld/> Right trapezoids are used in the [[trapezoidal rule]] for estimating areas under a curve.\n\nAn '''acute trapezoid''' has two adjacent acute angles on its longer ''base'' edge, while an '''obtuse trapezoid''' has one acute and one obtuse angle on each ''base''.\n\nAn '''[[isosceles trapezoid]]''' is a trapezoid where the base angles have the same measure. As a consequence the two legs are also of equal length and it has [[reflection symmetry]].  This is possible for acute trapezoids or right trapezoids (rectangles).\n\nA '''[[parallelogram]]''' is a trapezoid with two pairs of parallel sides. A parallelogram has central 2-fold [[rotational symmetry]] (or [[point reflection]] symmetry).  It is possible for obtuse trapezoids or right trapezoids (rectangles).\n\nA '''[[tangential trapezoid]]''' is a trapezoid that has an [[Tangential quadrilateral|incircle]].\n\nA [[Saccheri quadrilateral]] is similar to a trapezoid in the hyperbolic plane, with two adjacent right angles, while it is a rectangle in the Euclidean plane. A [[Lambert quadrilateral]] in the hyperbolic plane has 3 right angles.\n\n==Condition of existence==\nFour lengths ''a'', ''c'', ''b'', ''d'' can constitute the consecutive sides of a non-parallelogram trapezoid with ''a'' and ''b'' parallel only when<ref>''Ask Dr. Math'' (2008), [http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/72738.html \"Area of Trapezoid Given Only the Side Lengths\"].</ref>\n:<math>\\displaystyle |d-c| < |b-a| < d+c.</math>\n\nThe quadrilateral is a parallelogram when <math>d-c = b-a = 0</math>, but it is an [[ex-tangential quadrilateral]] (which is not a trapezoid) when <math>|d-c| = |b-a| \\neq 0</math>.<ref name=Josefsson/>{{rp|p. 35}}\n\n==Characterizations==\nGiven a convex quadrilateral, the following properties are equivalent, and each implies that the quadrilateral is a trapezoid:\n*It has two adjacent [[angle]]s that are [[supplementary angles|supplementary]], that is, they add up to 180 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s.\n*The angle between a side and a diagonal is equal to the angle between the opposite side and the same diagonal.\n*The [[diagonal]]s cut each other in mutually the same [[ratio]] (this ratio is the same as that between the lengths of the parallel sides).\n*The diagonals cut the quadrilateral into four triangles of which one opposite pair are [[similarity (geometry)|similar]].\n*The diagonals cut the quadrilateral into four triangles of which one opposite pair have equal areas.<ref name=Josefsson>Martin Josefsson, [http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2013volume13/FG201305.pdf \"Characterizations of trapezoids\"], Forum Geometricorum, 13 (2013) 23-35.</ref>{{rp|Prop.5}}\n*The product of the areas of the two triangles formed by one diagonal equals the product of the areas of the two triangles formed by the other diagonal.<ref name=Josefsson/>{{rp|Thm.6}}\n*The areas ''S'' and ''T'' of some two opposite triangles of the four triangles formed by the diagonals satisfy the equation\n\n::<math>\\sqrt{K}=\\sqrt{S}+\\sqrt{T},</math>\n\n:where ''K'' is the area of the quadrilateral.<ref name=\"Josefsson\" />{{rp|Thm.8}}\n\n*The midpoints of two opposite sides and the intersection of the diagonals are [[collinear]].<ref name=\"Josefsson\" />{{rp|Thm.15}}\n*The angles in the quadrilateral ''ABCD'' satisfy <math>\\sin A\\sin C=\\sin B\\sin D.</math><ref name=Josefsson/>{{rp|p. 25}}\n*The cosines of two adjacent angles sum to 0, as do the cosines of the other two angles.<ref name=Josefsson/>{{rp|p. 25}}\n*The cotangents of two adjacent angles sum to 0, as do the cotangents of the other two adjacent angles.<ref name=Josefsson/>{{rp|p. 26}}\n*One bimedian divides the quadrilateral into two quadrilaterals of equal areas.<ref name=Josefsson/>{{rp|p. 26}}\n*Twice the length of the bimedian connecting the midpoints of two opposite sides equals the sum of the lengths of the other sides.<ref name=Josefsson/>{{rp|p. 31}}\n\nAdditionally, the following properties are equivalent, and each implies that opposite sides ''a'' and ''b'' are parallel:\n* The consecutive sides ''a'', ''c'', ''b'', ''d'' and the diagonals ''p'', ''q'' satisfy the equation<ref name=\"Josefsson\" />{{rp|Cor.11}}\n::<math>p^2+q^2=c^2+d^2+2ab.</math>\n\n*The distance ''v'' between the midpoints of the diagonals satisfies the equation<ref name=\"Josefsson\" />{{rp|Thm.12}}\n::<math>v=\\frac{|a-b|}{2}.</math>\n\n==Midsegment and height==\nThe ''midsegment'' (also called the median or midline) of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the [[midpoint]]s of the legs. It is parallel to the bases. Its length ''m'' is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases ''a'' and ''b'' of the trapezoid,<ref name=Mathworld/>\n:<math>m = \\frac{a + b}{2}.</math>\n\nThe midsegment of a trapezoid is one of the two [[Quadrilateral#Special line segments|bimedian]]s (the other bimedian divides the trapezoid into equal areas).\n\nThe ''height'' (or altitude) is the [[perpendicular]] distance between the bases. In the case that the two bases have different lengths (''a'' \u2260 ''b''), the height of a trapezoid ''h'' can be determined by the length of its four sides using the formula<ref name=Mathworld/>\n:<math>h= \\frac{\\sqrt{(-a+b+c+d)(a-b+c+d)(a-b+c-d)(a-b-c+d)}}{2|b-a|}</math>\n\nwhere ''c'' and ''d'' are the lengths of the legs.\n\n==Area==\nThe area ''K'' of a trapezoid is given by<ref name=Mathworld/>\n:<math>K = \\frac{a + b}{2} \\cdot h = mh</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are the lengths of the parallel sides, ''h'' is the height (the perpendicular distance between these sides), and ''m'' is the [[arithmetic mean]] of the lengths of the two parallel sides.  In 499 AD [[Aryabhata]], a great [[mathematician]]-[[astronomer]] from the classical age of [[Indian mathematics]] and [[Indian astronomy]], used this method in the ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' (section 2.8). This yields as a [[special case]] the well-known formula for the area of a [[triangle]], by considering a triangle as a degenerate trapezoid in which one of the parallel sides has shrunk to a point.\n\nThe 7th-century Indian mathematician [[Bh\u0101skara I]] derived the following formula for the area of a trapezoid with consecutive sides ''a'', ''c'', ''b'', ''d'':\n:<math>K=\\frac{1}{2}(a+b)\\sqrt{c^2-\\frac{1}{4}\\left((b-a)+\\frac{c^2-d^2}{b-a}\\right)^2}</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are parallel and ''b'' > ''a''.<ref>T.

(This formula is similar to [[Brahmagupta's formula]], but it differs from it, in that a trapezoid might not be [[cyclic quadrilateral|cyclic]] (inscribed in a circle). The formula is also a special case of [[Bretschneider's formula]] for a general [[quadrilateral]]).\n\nFrom Bretschneider's formula, it follows that\n:<math>K= \\sqrt{\\frac{(ab^2-a^2 b-ad^2+bc^2)(ab^2-a^2 b-ac^2+bd^2)}{(2(b-a))^2} - \\left(\\frac{b^2+d^2-a^2-c^2}{4}\\right)^2}.</math>\n\nThe line that joins the midpoints of the parallel sides, bisects the area.\n\n==Diagonals==\n[[File:Trapezium.svg|200px|right]]\nThe lengths of the diagonals are<ref name=Mathworld/>\n:<math>p= \\sqrt{\\frac{ab^2-a^2b-ac^2+bd^2}{b-a}},</math>\n:<math>q= \\sqrt{\\frac{ab^2-a^2b-ad^2+bc^2}{b-a}}</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' is the short base, ''b'' is the long base, and ''c'' and ''d'' are the trapezoid legs.\n\nIf the trapezoid is divided into four triangles by its diagonals ''AC'' and ''BD'' (as shown on the right), intersecting at ''O'', then the area of {{trianglenotation|AOD}} is equal to that of {{trianglenotation|BOC}}, and the product of the areas of {{trianglenotation|AOD}} and {{trianglenotation|BOC}} is equal to that of {{trianglenotation|AOB}} and {{trianglenotation|COD}}.

The Britsh [[Middle East Command]] with troops from the [[United Kingdom]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[British Raj|British India]], [[Uganda Protectorate]], [[British Kenya|Kenya]], [[British Somaliland|Somaliland]], [[British West Africa|West Africa]], [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Nyasaland]] participated in the campaign. These were joined by the Allied {{lang|fr|[[Force Publique]]}} of [[Belgian Congo]], [[Ethiopian Empire|Imperial Ethiopian]] [[Arbegnoch]] (resistance forces) and a small unit of [[Free French Forces|Free French]].\n\nItalian East Africa was defended by the {{lang|it|Comando Forze Armate dell'Africa Orientale Italiana}} (Italian East African Armed Forces Command), with units from the {{lang|it|[[Royal Italian Army|Regio Esercito]]}} (Royal Army), {{lang|it|[[Regia Aeronautica]]}} (Royal Air Force) and {{lang|it|[[Regia Marina]]}} (Royal Navy).

With Britain in control of the Suez Canal, the Italian forces were cut off from supplies and reinforcement once hostilities began.\n\nOn 13 June 1940 an Italian air raid took place on the base of [[No. 237 Squadron RAF|237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF]] at [[Wajir]] in [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]] and continued until Italian forces had been pushed back from Kenya and Sudan, through Somaliland, Eritrea and Ethiopia in 1940 and early 1941. The remnants of the Italian forces in the region surrendered after the [[Battle of Gondar]] in November 1941, except for small groups that fought a [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|guerrilla war in Ethiopia]] against the British until the [[Armistice of Cassibile]] in September 1943, which ended the war between Italy and the Allies. The East African campaign was the first Allied strategic victory in the war; few Italian forces escaped the region to be used in other campaigns and the Italian defeat greatly eased the flow of supplies through the Red Sea to Egypt.

When the Mediterranean route was closed to Allied merchant ships in April 1940, the Italian naval bases in East Africa were well placed for attacks on convoys en route to Suez up the east coast of Africa and through the Red Sea.

In July 1939, Wavell devised a strategy to defend and then dominate the Mediterranean as a base to attack Germany, through eastern and south-east Europe. The conquest of Italian East Africa came second only to the defence of Egypt and the Suez Canal and in August Wavell ordered plans to be made quickly to gain control of the Red Sea. Wavell specified a concept of offensive operations from Djibouti to Harar and then Addis Ababa or Kassala to Asmara then Massawa, preferably on both lines simultaneously. Wavell reconnoitred East Africa in January 1940 and the theatre was formally added to his responsibilities; he expected that the Somalilands could be defended with minor reinforcement. If Italy joined the war Ethiopia would be invaded as soon as there were sufficient troops; Wavell also co-ordinated plans with South Africa in March. On 1 May 1940, Wavell ordered British Troops Egypt to discreetly mobilise for military operations in western Egypt but after the June {{lang|fr|debacle}} in France, Wavell had to follow a defensive strategy.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=169\u2013170, 67}}\n\nAfter Italian operations in Sudan at Kassala and Gallabat in June, Churchill blamed Wavell for a \"static policy\".

On the northern front, Platt was to attack Gallabat and vicinity and on the southern front, Cunningham was to advance northwards from Kenya, through Italian Somaliland into Ethiopia. At the start of November 1940, Cunningham had taken over the East African Force from Major-General D. P. Dickinson, who was in poor health. While Platt advanced from the north and Cunningham from the south, Wavell planned for a third force to be landed in British Somaliland by amphibious assault to re-take the colony, prior to advancing into Ethiopia; the three forces were to rendezvous at Addis Ababa. The conquest of the AOI would remove the land threat to supplies and reinforcements coming from Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa and British East Africa via the Suez Canal for the [[Western Desert campaign]] and re-open the land route from [[Cape Town]] to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=168\u2013173}}\n\n====East Africa Force====\n[[File:Africa (Eastern region).png|thumb|{{centre|General definition of East Africa (2005)}}]]\nIn 1940, [[East Africa Force]] (Major-General D.

Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of Lake Tana, to Dangila, Debra Markos and Addis Ababa to prevent them concentrating against the ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots).{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=403}}\n\nItalian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissensions among local potentates were reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=403}} The Frontier Battalion of the Sudan Defence Force, set up in May 1940, was joined at Khartoum by the 2nd Ethiopian and 4th Eritrean battalions, raised from \u00e9migr\u00e9 volunteers in Kenya.

In December 1940, Clarke constructed a model operation for Italian military intelligence to discover and set up administration offices at Aden. Clarke arranged for the Italian defences around Berbera to be softened up by air and sea raids from Aden and distributed maps and pamphlets on the climate, geography and population of British Somaliland; \"Sibs\" (''sibilare'', hisses or whistles), were circulated among civilians in Egypt. Bogus information was planted on the Japanese consul at Port Said and indiscreet wireless messages were transmitted. The operation began on 19 December 1940 and was to mature early in January 1941; the deception was a success.

Mass defections by local forces suggested that Fascist imperialism had made little impression on the East African public. The Italian navy at Massawa had shown a \"stunning\" lack of energy and failed to challenge British access to Mombasa and Port Sudan or the landing at Berbera. The army had failed to exploit British supply difficulties and had left stores behind for the British to use. The British had withdrawn the 4th Indian Division and RAF squadrons for North Africa in February 1941, despite the Italian forces remaining at Amba Alagi, which from 20 April to 15 May, were steadily pressed back until they surrendered on 19 May.{{sfn|Porch|2005|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\nEthiopia, the Somalilands and Eritrea had been conquered by the British and the end of organised Italian resistance, led to the East Africa Force and Air Headquarters East Africa being reduced by the transfer of the South African and the two Indian divisions to Egypt, along with three fighter, three bomber and a reconnaissance squadron, followed by two more in late May. The 11th and 12th (African) divisions remained, supported by six RAF and SAAF squadrons.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=449\u2013450}} The Italians at Galla-Sidom and Gondar were mopped up and the final surrender was taken by the Belgian contingent from Congo. Mussolini blamed the disaster on the \"deficiency of the Italian race\" but the Fascist regime survived and the British victory had little influence on Japanese strategy in the Far East.{{sfn|Porch|2005|pp=137\u2013138}} With the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden cleared of [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] forces, Roosevelt declared that the areas were no longer combat zones on 11 April 1941. Ships of the United States were able to proceed to the Suez Canal, which helped to relieve the strain on British shipping resources.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\n===Signals intelligence===\nThe Italians had replaced their ciphers in the AOI in November 1940 but by the end of the month, the GC&CS in England and the Cipher Bureau Middle East (CBME) in Cairo had broken the new {{lang|it|Regio Esercito}} and {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} ciphers. By 1941, sufficient low-grade ciphers had been broken to reveal the Italian order of battle and the supply situation, by the time that the British offensive began on 19 January 1941. Italian dependence on wireless communication, using frequencies on which it was easy for the British to eavesdrop, led to a flood of information, from the daily report from the Viceroy, to the operational plans of the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} and {{lang|it|Regia Esercito}} on the retreat from Keren.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=64\u201365}} On occasion, British commanders had messages before the recipients and it was reported later by the Deputy Director Military Intelligence in Cairo, that\n\n{{quote|...he could not believe that any army commander in the field had [ever] been better served by his intelligence....|DDMI (ME){{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=64\u201365}}}}\n\n===Casualties===\nOn 16 April 1941, the authorities in the AOI signalled to Rome that {{nowrap|426 officers}} had been killed, {{nowrap|703 wounded}} and {{nowrap|315 captured,}} during military operations before the surrender.

The Britsh [[Middle East Command]] with troops from the [[United Kingdom]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[British Raj|British India]], [[Uganda Protectorate]], [[British Kenya|Kenya]], [[British Somaliland|Somaliland]], [[British West Africa|West Africa]], [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Nyasaland]] participated in the campaign. These were joined by the Allied {{lang|fr|[[Force Publique]]}} of [[Belgian Congo]], [[Ethiopian Empire|Imperial Ethiopian]] [[Arbegnoch]] (resistance forces) and a small unit of [[Free French Forces|Free French]].\n\nItalian East Africa was defended by the {{lang|it|Comando Forze Armate dell'Africa Orientale Italiana}} (Italian East African Armed Forces Command), with units from the {{lang|it|[[Royal Italian Army|Regio Esercito]]}} (Royal Army), {{lang|it|[[Regia Aeronautica]]}} (Royal Air Force) and {{lang|it|[[Regia Marina]]}} (Royal Navy). The Italian forces included about 250,000 soldiers of the {{lang|it|[[Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali]]}} (Royal Corps of Colonial Troops), led by Italian officers and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]].  With Britain in control of the Suez Canal, the Italian forces were cut off from supplies and reinforcement once hostilities began.\n\nOn 13 June 1940 an Italian air raid took place on the base of [[No. 237 Squadron RAF|237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF]] at [[Wajir]] in [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]] and continued until Italian forces had been pushed back from Kenya and Sudan, through Somaliland, Eritrea and Ethiopia in 1940 and early 1941. The remnants of the Italian forces in the region surrendered after the [[Battle of Gondar]] in November 1941, except for small groups that fought a [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|guerrilla war in Ethiopia]] against the British until the [[Armistice of Cassibile]] in September 1943, which ended the war between Italy and the Allies. The East African campaign was the first Allied strategic victory in the war; few Italian forces escaped the region to be used in other campaigns and the Italian defeat greatly eased the flow of supplies through the Red Sea to Egypt. Most of the Commonwealth forces were transferred to North Africa to participate in the [[Western Desert Campaign]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Italian East Africa===\n\n{{main article|Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II)}}\n\nOn 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, [[Benito Mussolini]], proclaimed the formation of [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', AOI), from Ethiopia after the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] and the colonies of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in the AOI a danger to the British and French colonies in East Africa. Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British sea lanes along the coast of East Africa, the [[Gulf of Aden]], the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]]. (The [[Kingdom of Egypt]] remained [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] during the Second World War but the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]] allowed the British to occupy Egypt and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].){{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=6\u20137, 69}} Egypt, the Suez Canal, [[French Somaliland]] and [[British Somaliland]] were also vulnerable to invasion but {{lang|it|Comando Supremo}} (Italian General Staff) had planned for a war after 1942; in the summer of 1940 Italy was far from ready for a long war or for the occupation of large areas of [[Africa]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n===={{lang|it|Regio Esercito}}====\n\n[[File:Italian East Africa.png|thumb|{{centre|The AOI in 1936.

About 70 per cent of Italian troops were locally recruited [[Askari]]. The regular Eritrean battalions and the {{lang|it|Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali}} (RCTC [[Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops]]) were among the best Italian units in the AOI and included Eritrean cavalry {{lang|it|Penne di Falco}} (Falcon Feathers).{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=166}} (On one occasion a squadron of horse charged British and Commonwealth troops, throwing small hand grenades from the saddle.) Most colonial troops were recruited, trained and equipped for colonial repression, although the Somali [[Dubats]] from the borderlands were useful light infantry and skirmishers. Irregular {{lang|it|[[Bands (Italian Army irregulars)|bande]]}} were hardy and mobile, knew the country and were effective scouts and saboteurs, although sometimes confused with ''Shifta'', marauders who plundered and murdered at will.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nOnce Italy entered the war, a 100-strong company was formed from German residents of East Africa and stranded German sailors.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|1995|p=263}} Italian forces in East Africa were equipped with about {{nowrap|3,313 heavy}} machine-guns, {{nowrap|5,313 machine-guns,}} 24 [[M11/39]] medium tanks, 39 [[L3/35]] tankettes, {{nowrap|126 armoured cars}} and {{nowrap|824 guns,}} twenty-four {{nowrap|20 mm}} anti-aircraft guns, seventy-one {{nowrap|81 mm mortars}} and {{nowrap|672,800 rifles.}}{{sfn|Marino|2009|p=31}} The Italians had little opportunity for reinforcement or supply, leading to severe shortages, especially of ammunition.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=14}} On occasion, foreign merchant vessels captured by German [[merchant raider]]s in the [[Indian Ocean]] were brought to Somali ports but their cargoes were not always of much use to the Italian war effort. On 22 November 1940 the Yugoslav steamer ''Durmitor'', captured by the German auxiliary cruiser ''[[German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', put in at [[Warsheikh]] with a cargo of salt and several hundred prisoners.{{sfn|Mohr|Sellwood|2009|p=126}}\n\n===={{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}}====\n[[File:Savoia-Marchetti S.M.79 flight in formation.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Savoia-Marchetti S.M.79 formation}}]]\nThe {{lang|it|Comando Aeronautica Africa Orientale Italiana}} (CAAOI) of the {{lang|it|[[Regia Aeronautica]]}} (General Pietro Pinna) based in Addis Ababa, had three sector commands corresponding to the land fronts,\n* {{lang|it|Comando Settore Aeronautico Nord}} (Air Sector Headquarters North)\n* {{lang|it|Comando Settore Aeronautico Est}} (Air Sector Headquarters West)\n* {{lang|it|Comando Settore Aeronautico Sud}} (Air Sector Headquarters South)\nIn June 1940, there were {{nowrap|323 aircraft}} in the AOI, in {{nowrap|23 bomber}} squadrons with {{nowrap|138 aircraft,}} comprising {{nowrap|14 squadrons}} with six aircraft each, six [[Caproni Ca.133]] light bomber squadrons, seven [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81]] squadrons and two squadrons of [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]]s.

When the Mediterranean route was closed to Allied merchant ships in April 1940, the Italian naval bases in East Africa were well placed for attacks on convoys en route to Suez up the east coast of Africa and through the Red Sea. The finite resources in Italian East Africa were intended to last for a war of about six months' duration, the submarines denying the Red Sea route to the British.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=99}}\n\n===Mediterranean and Middle East===\n{{see also|Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|l1=Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre}}\n[[File:Africa1940.png|thumb|{{centre|Africa in 1940}}]]\nThe British had based [[History of modern Egypt|forces in Egypt]] since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936]].

In mid-1939, General [[Archibald Percival Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] was appointed [[General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) of the new [[Middle East Command]], over the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean and Middle East]] theatres.

In July 1939, Wavell devised a strategy to defend and then dominate the Mediterranean as a base to attack Germany, through eastern and south-east Europe. The conquest of Italian East Africa came second only to the defence of Egypt and the Suez Canal and in August Wavell ordered plans to be made quickly to gain control of the Red Sea. Wavell specified a concept of offensive operations from Djibouti to Harar and then Addis Ababa or Kassala to Asmara then Massawa, preferably on both lines simultaneously. Wavell reconnoitred East Africa in January 1940 and the theatre was formally added to his responsibilities; he expected that the Somalilands could be defended with minor reinforcement. If Italy joined the war Ethiopia would be invaded as soon as there were sufficient troops; Wavell also co-ordinated plans with South Africa in March. On 1 May 1940, Wavell ordered British Troops Egypt to discreetly mobilise for military operations in western Egypt but after the June {{lang|fr|debacle}} in France, Wavell had to follow a defensive strategy.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=169\u2013170, 67}}\n\nAfter Italian operations in Sudan at Kassala and Gallabat in June, Churchill blamed Wavell for a \"static policy\". [[Anthony Eden]], the [[Secretary of State for War]] communicated to Wavell that an Italian advance towards Khartoum should be destroyed. Wavell replied that the Italian attacks were not serious but went to Sudan and Kenya to see for himself and met the Ethiopian Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] at Khartoum.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=67, 72\u201373}} Eden convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940, with Selassie, the South African General [[Jan Smuts]] (advisor to [[Winston Churchill]]), Wavell, Lieutenant-General [[William Platt]] and Lieutenant-General [[Alan Cunningham]]. A plan to attack Ethiopia, including Ethiopian irregular forces, was agreed.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=245}} In November 1940, the British gained an intelligence advantage when the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC & CS) at [[Bletchley Park]] broke the high grade cypher of the Italian army in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the ''Regia Aeronautica'' was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME).{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\nIn September 1940, Wavell ordered the commanders in Sudan and Kenya to make limited attacks once the rainy season ended. On the northern front, Platt was to attack Gallabat and vicinity and on the southern front, Cunningham was to advance northwards from Kenya, through Italian Somaliland into Ethiopia. At the start of November 1940, Cunningham had taken over the East African Force from Major-General D. P. Dickinson, who was in poor health. While Platt advanced from the north and Cunningham from the south, Wavell planned for a third force to be landed in British Somaliland by amphibious assault to re-take the colony, prior to advancing into Ethiopia; the three forces were to rendezvous at Addis Ababa. The conquest of the AOI would remove the land threat to supplies and reinforcements coming from Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa and British East Africa via the Suez Canal for the [[Western Desert campaign]] and re-open the land route from [[Cape Town]] to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=168\u2013173}}\n\n====East Africa Force====\n[[File:Africa (Eastern region).png|thumb|{{centre|General definition of East Africa (2005)}}]]\nIn 1940, [[East Africa Force]] (Major-General D.

Sandford requested that supply routes be established before the rains ended, to the area north of Lake Tana and that Selassie should return in October, as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of Lake Tana, to Dangila, Debra Markos and Addis Ababa to prevent them concentrating against the ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots).{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=403}}\n\nItalian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissensions among local potentates were reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=403}} The Frontier Battalion of the Sudan Defence Force, set up in May 1940, was joined at Khartoum by the 2nd Ethiopian and 4th Eritrean battalions, raised from \u00e9migr\u00e9 volunteers in Kenya.

Major [[Orde Wingate]] was sent to Khartoum with an assistant to join the HQ of the SDF. On 20 November, Wingate was flown to Sakhala to meet Sandford; the RAF managed to bomb Dangila, drop propaganda leaflets and supply Mission 101, which raised Ethiopian morale, having suffered much from Italian air power since the Second Italo-Abyssinian War.

After visiting from 8 to 13 January 1940, Wavell decided that Legentilhomme would command the military forces in both Somalilands should war with Italy come.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}} In June, an Italian force was assembled to capture the port city of [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti]], the main military base.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=89}} After the [[fall of France]] in June, the neutralisation of [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] colonies allowed the Italians to concentrate on the more lightly defended British Somaliland.{{sfn|Mockler|1984|p=241}} On 23 July, Legentilhomme was ousted by the pro-Vichy naval officer [[Pierre Nouailhetas]] and left on 5 August for Aden, to join the [[Free French]]. In March 1941, the British enforcement of a strict contraband regime to prevent supplies being passed on to the Italians, lost its point after the conquest of the AOI. The British changed policy, with encouragement from the Free French, to \"rally French Somaliland to the Allied cause without bloodshed\". The Free French were to arrange a ''voluntary ralliement'' by propaganda ([[Operation Marie]]) and the British were to blockade the colony.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=322\u2013323}}\n\nWavell considered that if British pressure was applied, a rally would appear to have been coerced. Wavell preferred to let the propaganda continue and provided a small amount of supplies under strict control. When the policy had no effect, Wavell suggested negotiations with the Vichy governor Louis Nouailhetas, to use the port and railway. The suggestion was accepted by the British government but because of the concessions granted to the Vichy regime in Syria, proposals were made to invade the colony instead. In June, Nouailhetas was given an ultimatum, the blockade was tightened and the Italian garrison at Assab was defeated by an operation from Aden. For six months, Nouailhetas remained willing to grant concessions over the port and railway but would not tolerate Free French interference. In October the blockade was reviewed but the beginning of the war with Japan in December, led to all but two blockade ships being withdrawn. On 2 January 1942, the Vichy government offered the use of the port and railway, subject to the lifting of the blockade but the British refused and ended the blockade unilaterally in March.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=323\u2013324}}\n\n==Northern front, 1941==\n===Operation Camilla===\n[[Operation Camilla]] was a deception concocted by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Dudley Clarke]], to deceive the Italians, making them believe that the British planned to re-conquer British Somaliland with the 4th and 5th Indian divisions, transferred from Egypt to [[Al Qadarif|Gedaref]] and Port Sudan. In December 1940, Clarke constructed a model operation for Italian military intelligence to discover and set up administration offices at Aden. Clarke arranged for the Italian defences around Berbera to be softened up by air and sea raids from Aden and distributed maps and pamphlets on the climate, geography and population of British Somaliland; \"Sibs\" (''sibilare'', hisses or whistles), were circulated among civilians in Egypt. Bogus information was planted on the Japanese consul at Port Said and indiscreet wireless messages were transmitted. The operation began on 19 December 1940 and was to mature early in January 1941; the deception was a success. The plot backfired when the Italians began to evacuate British Somaliland instead of sending reinforcements. Troops were sent north into Eritrea, where the real attack was coming, instead of to the east. Part of the deception with misleading wireless transmissions, did convince the Italians that two Australian divisions were in Kenya, which did lead the Italians to reinforce the wrong area.{{sfn|Rankin|2009|pp=316\u2013317}}\n\n===Eritrea===\nIn November 1940, Gazelle Force operated from the [[Mareb River|Gash river]] delta against Italian advanced posts around Kassala on the Ethiopian plateau, where hill ranges from {{cvt|2000|\u2013|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}} bound wide valleys and the rainfall makes the area malarial from July to October.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=172\u2013174}} On 11 December, Wavell ordered the 4th Indian Division to withdraw from Operation Compass in the Western Desert and move to Sudan.

Cunningham encountered few Italians west of the Juba, only ''bande'' and a colonial battalion at Afmadu and troops at [[Kismayu]], where the Juba River empties into the Indian Ocean.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=411}} Against an expected six brigades and \"six groups of native levies\" holding the Juba for the Italians, Cunningham began Operation Canvas on 24 January, with four [[brigade group]]s from the 11th (African) Division and the 12th (African) Division. Afmadu was captured on 11 February and three days later, the port of Kismayu the first objective was captured. North of Kismayu and beyond the river was the main Italian position at Jelib. On 22 February, Jelib was attacked on both flanks and from the rear. The Italians were routed and 30,000 were killed, captured or dispersed in the bush.

The 12th (African) Division was ordered to advance on Bardera and Isha Baidoa but was held up because of the difficulty in using Kismayu as a supply base. The division pushed up the Juba River in Italian Somaliland towards the Ethiopian border town of [[Dolo, Ethiopia|Dolo]]. After a pause, caused by the lack of equipment to sweep Mogadishu harbour of British magnetic mines dropped earlier, the 11th (African) Division began a fighting pursuit of the retreating Italian forces north from Mogadishu on 1 March. The division pursued the Italians towards the Ogaden Plateau. By 17 March, the 11th (African) Division completed a 17-day dash along the Italian ''Strada Imperiale'' (Imperial Road) from Mogadishu to [[Jijiga]] in the [[Somali region]] of Ethiopia. By early March Cunningham's forces had captured most of Italian Somaliland and were advancing through Ethiopia towards the ultimate objective, Addis Ababa.

British troops advancing from the south had captured Addis Ababa on 6 April. Wavell imposed a policy of avoiding big operations in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia, that would impede the withdrawal of troops to Egypt. The remaining Italian troops were no threat to Sudan or Eritrea but could trouble the British hold on the AOI. The 1st South African Division was needed in Egypt and Cunningham was ordered to send it north to capture the main road to Massawa and Port Sudan so the ports could be used for embarkation. Amba Alagi obstructed the road north and the 5th Indian Division advanced from southwards as the South Africans moved northwards in a pincer movement. The main attack by the 5th Indian Division began on 4 May and made slow progress. On 10 May, the 1st South African Brigade arrived and completed the encirclement of the mountain. The Indian division attacked again on 13 May, with the South Africans attacking next day and forcing the Italians out of several defensive positions. Concerned about the care of his wounded and rumours of atrocities committed by the ''Arbegnoch'', Aosta offered to surrender, provided that the Italians were granted the [[honours of war]].

Stewart wrote that due to the British defeats in Greece and Crete the East African campaign has been overshadowed, although it was the first victory for the Allies in the Second World War.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=ix}} In 2004, the American historian [[Douglas Porch]] wrote that the \"pearl of the fascist regime\" had lasted only five years, the performance of the Italian army exceeded that in North Africa but there had still been a high ratio of prisoners to casualties. Mass defections by local forces suggested that Fascist imperialism had made little impression on the East African public. The Italian navy at Massawa had shown a \"stunning\" lack of energy and failed to challenge British access to Mombasa and Port Sudan or the landing at Berbera. The army had failed to exploit British supply difficulties and had left stores behind for the British to use. The British had withdrawn the 4th Indian Division and RAF squadrons for North Africa in February 1941, despite the Italian forces remaining at Amba Alagi, which from 20 April to 15 May, were steadily pressed back until they surrendered on 19 May.{{sfn|Porch|2005|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\nEthiopia, the Somalilands and Eritrea had been conquered by the British and the end of organised Italian resistance, led to the East Africa Force and Air Headquarters East Africa being reduced by the transfer of the South African and the two Indian divisions to Egypt, along with three fighter, three bomber and a reconnaissance squadron, followed by two more in late May. The 11th and 12th (African) divisions remained, supported by six RAF and SAAF squadrons.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=449\u2013450}} The Italians at Galla-Sidom and Gondar were mopped up and the final surrender was taken by the Belgian contingent from Congo. Mussolini blamed the disaster on the \"deficiency of the Italian race\" but the Fascist regime survived and the British victory had little influence on Japanese strategy in the Far East.{{sfn|Porch|2005|pp=137\u2013138}} With the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden cleared of [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] forces, Roosevelt declared that the areas were no longer combat zones on 11 April 1941. Ships of the United States were able to proceed to the Suez Canal, which helped to relieve the strain on British shipping resources.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\n===Signals intelligence===\nThe Italians had replaced their ciphers in the AOI in November 1940 but by the end of the month, the GC&CS in England and the Cipher Bureau Middle East (CBME) in Cairo had broken the new {{lang|it|Regio Esercito}} and {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} ciphers. By 1941, sufficient low-grade ciphers had been broken to reveal the Italian order of battle and the supply situation, by the time that the British offensive began on 19 January 1941. Italian dependence on wireless communication, using frequencies on which it was easy for the British to eavesdrop, led to a flood of information, from the daily report from the Viceroy, to the operational plans of the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} and {{lang|it|Regia Esercito}} on the retreat from Keren.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=64\u201365}} On occasion, British commanders had messages before the recipients and it was reported later by the Deputy Director Military Intelligence in Cairo, that\n\n{{quote|...he could not believe that any army commander in the field had [ever] been better served by his intelligence....|DDMI (ME){{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=64\u201365}}}}\n\n===Casualties===\nOn 16 April 1941, the authorities in the AOI signalled to Rome that {{nowrap|426 officers}} had been killed, {{nowrap|703 wounded}} and {{nowrap|315 captured,}} during military operations before the surrender. Casualties among NCOs and other ranks were {{nowrap|4,785 killed,}} {{nowrap|6,244 wounded}} and {{nowrap|15,871 captured}} (inclusive). Casualties among locally recruited soldiers were {{nowrap|11,755 dead,}} {{nowrap|18,151 wounded}} and {{nowrap|3,076 captured}} before the surrender; the {{lang|it|Truppi coloniale}} figures did not include forces on the Giuba and eastern fronts.{{sfn|Rovighi|1988|p=476}} By May 1941, of the {{circa|350,000}} men in the AOI available for military operations in June 1940, only the {{circa|80,000 men}} in the garrisons near Gondar and the seven colonial divisions in Galla-Sidamo remained to be taken prisoner.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=423, 447}}{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=303}} More casualties among the Italian and colonial troops occurred after April 1941, in the operations against Amba Alagi (3,500 casualties), Kulkaber/Culqualber (1,003 killed and 804 wounded) and Gondar (4,000 killed and 8,400 sick and wounded).{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=187}}{{sfn|Maravigna|1949|p=191}} In 1959, I. S. O. Playfair, the British official historian, recorded that from June 1940 to May 1941, the East African Force had {{nowrap|1,154 battle}} casualties and {{nowrap|74,550 sickness}} or accident cases, including {{nowrap|10,000 dysentery}} and {{nowrap|10,000 malaria}} cases of which {{nowrap|744 were}} fatal. The RAF lost {{nowrap|138 aircraft}} and the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} {{nowrap|250 of}} the {{nowrap|325 aeroplanes}} in the AOI when the war began and the {{nowrap|75 flown}} to the region during the campaign. The Belgian {{lang|fr|[[Force Publique]]}} suffered {{nowrap|462 fatalities}} from all causes.{{sfn|BIC|1941|p=22}}\n\n===Subsequent operations===\n====Guerrilla warfare====\n\n{{main article|Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia}}\n\n[[File:Cartolina Ritorneremo.jpg|thumb|{{centre|1941 propaganda poster calling on Italians to avenge the defeat in East Africa}}]]\nUntil 27 November 1941, two African divisions mopped up pockets of resistance until the last formed Italian units surrendered.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=183}} From the end of 1941 to September 1943, {{circa|7,000}} men in scattered Italian units fought a guerrilla war from the deserts of Eritrea and Somalia to the forests and mountains of Ethiopia.{{sfn|Cernuschi|1994|pp=5, 36}} They supposedly did so in the hope of holding out until the Germans and Italians in Egypt (or even possibly the Japanese in India) intervened. [[Amedeo Guillet]] was one of the Italian officers who fought with the Italian guerrillas in Ethiopia. Another notable guerrilla leader was [[Hamid Idris Awate]], a father of the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]].{{sfn|Roselli|2007|p=58}}\n\nOther Italian officers were Captain [[Francesco De Martini]] in Eritrea, Colonel Calderari in western Ethiopia/Somalia, Colonel Di Marco in Ogaden/British Somaliland \"blackshirt centurion\" De Varda in Somalia/Ethiopia and Major Lucchetti in Ethiopia. Civilians participated and in August 1942, forces led by Dr. [[Rosa Dainelli]] sabotaged the main British ammunition dump in Addis Ababa.{{sfn|Roselli|2007|p=58}} Hostilities in East Africa officially ceased on 9 September 1943, when the Italian government signed the [[Armistice with Italy]]. Some three thousand Italian soldiers continued the guerrilla war until October 1943, as they were unaware of the agreement when Italy surrendered to the Allies.{{sfn|Cernuschi|1994|p=74}}\n\n====Post-war====\nIn January 1942, with the final official surrender of the Italians, the British, under American pressure, signed an interim [[Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement]] with Selassie, acknowledging Ethiopian sovereignty. [[Makonnen Endelkachew]] was named as Prime Minister and on 19 December 1944, the final Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement was signed. Eritrea was placed under British military administration for the duration and in 1950, it became part of Ethiopia. After 1945, Britain controlled both Somalilands, as [[protectorate]]s. In November 1949, during the [[Potsdam Conference]], the United Nations granted Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland under close supervision, on condition that Somalia achieve independence within ten years.{{sfn|Zolberg|Aguayo|Suhrke|1992|p=106}} British Somaliland became independent on 26 June 1960 as the [[State of Somaliland]], the [[Trust Territory of Somalia]] (ex-Italian Somaliland) became independent on 1 July 1960 and the territories united as the [[Somali Republic]].{{sfn|NEB|2002|p=835}}\n\n==Victoria Cross==\nThe following is a list of recipients of the Victoria Cross during this campaign:\n* [[Eric Charles Twelves Wilson]] (captain, Somaliland Camel Corps) \u2013 Received during the Italian invasion of British Somaliland.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}}\n* [[Premindra Singh Bhagat]] (second lieutenant, Royal Bombay Sappers and Miners) \u2013 Received during fighting on the Northern Front.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=401}}\n* [[Richhpal Ram]] (Subedar in 6th Rajputana Rifles) \u2013 Received posthumously during fighting on the Northern Front.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=435}}\n* [[Nigel Leakey]] (sergeant in the 1/6 Battalion King's African Rifles and cousin of the paleoanthropologist [[Louis Leakey]]) \u2013 Received posthumously during fighting on the Southern Front.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=308}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia]]\n* [[Italian Empire]]\n* [[Colonial heads of Italian East Africa]]\n* [[Military history of Ethiopia]]\n* [[Military production during World War II]]\n* [[Military history of Italy during World War II]]\n* [[North African campaign]]\n* [[Western Desert campaign]]\n* [[Syria-Lebanon campaign]]\n* [[West Africa campaign (World War II)|West Africa campaign]]\n* [[Battle of Madagascar]]\n* [[German Motorized Company]]\n* [[MVSN Colonial Militia]]\n* [[South African Irish Regiment]]\n* [[81st (West Africa) Division]]\n* [[82nd (West Africa) Division]]\n* [[Royal Corps of Colonial Troops]]\n* [[Dubats]]\n* [[Zaptie]]\n* [[Armoured car regiment]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''Books'''\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Barker|1971}}\n|first=A.

Their mothers were sisters, making them maternal first cousins, and further, their fathers were first cousins, making them paternal second cousins. Elsa had the surname of Einstein at birth, lost it when she took the name of her first husband Max L\u00f6wenthal, and regained it in 1919 when she married her cousin Albert.\n\n==Early life==\nElsa, the daughter of Rudolf Einstein, was born in [[Hechingen]] in January 1876.<ref name=\"Highfield146\"/> She had two sisters: Paula (c.&nbsp;1878\u2013c.&nbsp;1955) and Hermine (1872\u20131942). Rudolf was a textile manufacturer in Hechingen. During the regular visits with the family in [[Munich]], she often played with her cousin Albert. In her [[Swabian German|Swabian]] dialect, she called him \"Albertle\".<ref name=\"elsa\">[http://www.einstein-website.de/biographies/einsteinelsa_content.html Short life history: Elsa Einstein.]</ref> The two parted ways in 1894, when Albert left Germany to follow his family to [[Milan]].\n\n==Married life==\nIn 1896, Elsa married textile trader Max L\u00f6wenthal (1864\u20131914),<ref name=\"Highfield146\"/> from Berlin, with whom she had three children: daughters Ilse (1897\u20131934) and Margot (1899-1986), and a son who was born in 1903, but died shortly after birth.<ref>{{Harvnb|Highfield|1993|p=146,287}}</ref> They lived together in Hechingen. In 1902, Max L\u00f6wenthal took a job in Berlin. His family stayed in Hechingen. She divorced Max on 11 May 1908,<ref name=\"Highfield146\">{{Harvnb|Highfield|1993|p=146}}</ref><ref name=\"elsa\"/> and moved with her two daughters to an apartment above her parents on Haberlandstrasse<ref name=\"Highfield146\"/> 5, in Berlin.<ref name=\"Highfield146\"/>\n[[File:Einstein Albert Elsa LOC 32096u.jpg|alt=Einstein, looking relaxed and holding a pipe, stands next to a smiling, well-dressed Elsa who is wearing a fancy hat and fur wrap.

Einstein separated from Mileva in 1914 and their divorce was final on 14 February 1919.

Elsa had the surname of Einstein at birth, lost it when she took the name of her first husband Max L\u00f6wenthal, and regained it in 1919 when she married her cousin Albert.\n\n==Early life==\nElsa, the daughter of Rudolf Einstein, was born in [[Hechingen]] in January 1876.<ref name=\"Highfield146\"/> She had two sisters: Paula (c.&nbsp;1878\u2013c.&nbsp;1955) and Hermine (1872\u20131942). Rudolf was a textile manufacturer in Hechingen. During the regular visits with the family in [[Munich]], she often played with her cousin Albert. In her [[Swabian German|Swabian]] dialect, she called him \"Albertle\".<ref name=\"elsa\">[http://www.einstein-website.de/biographies/einsteinelsa_content.html Short life history: Elsa Einstein.]</ref> The two parted ways in 1894, when Albert left Germany to follow his family to [[Milan]].\n\n==Married life==\nIn 1896, Elsa married textile trader Max L\u00f6wenthal (1864\u20131914),<ref name=\"Highfield146\"/> from Berlin, with whom she had three children: daughters Ilse (1897\u20131934) and Margot (1899-1986), and a son who was born in 1903, but died shortly after birth.<ref>{{Harvnb|Highfield|1993|p=146,287}}</ref> They lived together in Hechingen. In 1902, Max L\u00f6wenthal took a job in Berlin. His family stayed in Hechingen.

{"title_page": "Argumentum a contrario", "text_new": "{{Italic title}}\n{{No footnotes|date=April 2020}}\nIn [[logic]], an '''''{{lang|la|argumentum a contrario}}''''' (Latin: 'argument from the contrary'), also known as '''appeal from the contrary''', denotes any proposition that is argued to be correct because it is not disproven by a certain case. It is the opposite of the [[analogy]]. When analogy is allowed, ''a contrario'' is forbidden and vice versa.  Arguments ''a contrario'' are often used in the legal system as a way to solve problems not currently covered by a certain system of laws. Although it might be used as a [[Formal fallacy|logical fallacy]], arguments ''a contrario'' are not by definition fallacies.\n\nIn law, the use of the ''argumentum a contrario'' finds its footing in the Latin maxim: ''ubicumque lex voluit dixit, ubi tacuit noluit'' that runs as follows: If the Legislator wished to say something, he would do that expressly.\n\n==Legal examples==\n*\"\u00a7 e X-Law says that green cars need to have blue tires. Therefore, red cars don't have to have blue tires.\"\n: Here the argument is based on the fact that red cars are not green cars and therefore \u00a7 123 of the X-Law cannot be applied to them. This requires the law to be [[Statutory interpretation|interpreted]] to determine which solution would have been desired if the lawmaker had considered red cars. In this case it's probably safe to assume that they only wanted to regulate green cars and not regulate cars of other colors.\n\nOn the other hand, this example:\n*\"\u00a7 456 of the Y-Law says that it's irrelevant whether a message is sent by letter or by telegraph. Therefore, messages cannot be sent by [[fax machines]].\"\n: As with the example above, the argument is based on the fact that the law does not mention something (in this case, faxes), but leaps to the interpretation that they must therefore not be used. Here, the belief that lawmakers intentionally excluded fax machines is less reasonable than the assumption that fax machines did not exist at this time and that, were the law passed today, they would have been mentioned.

Here, the belief that lawmakers intentionally excluded fax machines is less reasonable than the assumption that fax machines did not exist at this time and that, were the law passed today, they would have been mentioned. Here the ''a contrario'' argument is used fallaciously in two ways: it places the letter of the law above its intent, and mistakes a [[time, place, and manner]] law {{em|regulating}} letters and telegraphs, for a law only {{em|authorizing}} letters and telegraphs, which is it not.\n\nNovel legal cases often hinge on more cogent arguments of the form:\n*\"\u00a7\u00a7 455\u2013457 of the Y-Law specifically cover messages sent by letter or by telegraph, and do not mention fax machines or electronic mail, and thus cannot be held to apply to either of the latter.\"\n: Depending upon the intent and scope of the law, it may be held by the court to apply to the previously unaccounted-for situation by analogy, or to not apply because the cases are insufficiently analogous, such that a legislative change to the law's wording would be required for such an expansion of scope.  Cases raising such questions are increasingly common as technology introduces capabilities that are somewhat but not exactly analogous to those provided by older technologies. A high-profile example of the use of ''argumentum a contrario'' (rejected by the court) in such a case is ''[[Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Analogy]]\n*''[[A minore ad maius]]''\n*''[[A maiore ad minus]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Arguments]]\n[[Category:Informal fallacies]]\n[[Category:Latin logical phrases]]\n[[Category:Latin legal terminology]]\n[[Category:Legal reasoning]]\n", "name_user": "67.82.27.115", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eLegal examples)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_a_contrario"}
