The team's founder and principal is former racer Aki Ajo. His son, former racer [[Niklas Ajo]], is also involed in the team as crew chief and race engineer in the Moto3 programme.\n\nThe team debuted in 2001 and took its first win in 2003. Ajo Motorsport has won six world championship titles; the 125cc championship with [[Mike Di Meglio]] in 2008 and [[Marc M\u00e1rquez]] in 2010, the Moto3 championship in 2012 with [[Sandro Cortese]] and 2016 with [[Brad Binder]], and the Moto2 championship in 2015 and 2016, both with [[Johann Zarco]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.motogp.com/en/news/2015/10/09/triumphant-johann-zarco-lifts-moto2-world-title/184959|title=Triumphant Johann Zarco lifts Moto2 world title|publisher=[[Dorna Sports]]|work=MotoGP.com|date=9 October 2015|accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Marc Marquez 2010 Assen.jpg|thumb|[[Marc M\u00e1rquez]] at the [[2010 Dutch TT]]]]\nThe team's debut at a world championship race was at [[Sachsenring]] in 2001, where the team entered [[Mika Kallio]] as a [[Wild card (sports)|wildcard]] rider. The team and Kallio also took part in the competition in [[2001 Valencian Community motorcycle Grand Prix|Valencia]] later in the year. The team's bikes were labelled with the [[Honda]] brand name, even though the [[engine]]s were supplied by Ajo. 2002 was the first season in which Ajo was a regular competitor in the World Championship, with Kallio as their main rider. Their best result that season was fifth place in [[2002 Spanish motorcycle Grand Prix|Jerez]], and Kallio was named \"Rookie of the Year\", beating riders such as [[Andrea Dovizioso]] and [[Jorge Lorenzo]].\n\nIn 2003, the team expanded to two bikes, with Kallio being joined by the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] competitor [[Masao Azuma]]. Kallio then left the team in August after receiving an offer from [[KTM]]. He was replaced by [[Andrea Ballerini]]. In Australia, the team achieved a 1\u20132 victory, with Ballerini in first place and Azuma in second. Ajo attributed a large portion of their success to the combination of wet conditions and [[Bridgestone]] tyres, which are optimal for damp weather. For the 2004 season, the team had two new riders in [[Luk\u00e1\u0161 Pe\u0161ek]] and Danish [[Robbin Harms]]. The season was a disappointing one for Ajo, as Pe\u0161ek crashed repeatedly and as Harms suffered several injuries. Pe\u0161ek moved to the [[Derbi]] team for the next season.\n\nJapanese [[Tomoyoshi Koyama]] and French [[Alexis Masbou]] were Ajo's riders in the 2005 season. Koyama won the \"Rookie of the Year\" title, the team's second in four years. His best results were second place in Australia and third in Turkey; in overall standings he held eighth place. The team kept the same riders for the following year but obtained new bikes from [[Malaguti]]. Both riders suffered many injuries which affected their season. Masbou was only able to ride eight races and did not score any points. Koyama's best result was sixth in Estoril, and he ended in 15th place in the championship standings. In 2007, the team raced with [[Derbi]] bikes, driven by [[Michael Ranseder]] and [[Robert Mure\u0219an]]. Ranseder finished in the points 13 times, while Mure\u0219an failed to score.\n\nAjo Motorsport continued with Derbi for the [[2008 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2008 season]], with [[Mike Di Meglio]] and [[Dominique Aegerter]] as their riders. Di Meglio won four races (France, Catalonia, Germany and Australia) and clinched the world championship in Australia, two races before the end of the season. Aegerter finished eighth twice. [[Sandro Cortese]] accompanied [[Dominique Aegerter]] in [[2009 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2009]]. The team scored several podiums this season but did not manage to win any races. In the [[2010 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2010 season]], Ajo Motorsport fielded [[Marc M\u00e1rquez]], [[Sandro Cortese]] and [[Adri\u00e1n Mart\u00edn]]. The season was a big success for the team. M\u00e1rquez scored twelve poles and ten victories, and brought the team its second title in three years.\n\n==Grand Prix motorcycle results==\n\n([[Template:Motorsport driver results legend|key]]) (Races in '''bold''' indicate pole position; races in ''italics'' indicate fastest lap)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\"\n!

The team's founder and principal is former racer Aki Ajo. His son, former racer [[Niklas Ajo]] is also involed in the team as crew chief and race engineer in the Moto3 programme.\n\nThe team debuted in 2001 and took its first win in 2003. Ajo Motorsport has won six world championship titles; the 125cc championship with [[Mike Di Meglio]] in 2008 and [[Marc M\u00e1rquez]] in 2010, the Moto3 championship in 2012 with [[Sandro Cortese]] and 2016 with [[Brad Binder]], and the Moto2 championship in 2015 and 2016, both with [[Johann Zarco]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.motogp.com/en/news/2015/10/09/triumphant-johann-zarco-lifts-moto2-world-title/184959|title=Triumphant Johann Zarco lifts Moto2 world title|publisher=[[Dorna Sports]]|work=MotoGP.com|date=9 October 2015|accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Marc Marquez 2010 Assen.jpg|thumb|[[Marc M\u00e1rquez]] at the [[2010 Dutch TT]]]]\nThe team's debut at a world championship race was at [[Sachsenring]] in 2001, where the team entered [[Mika Kallio]] as a [[Wild card (sports)|wildcard]] rider. The team and Kallio also took part in the competition in [[2001 Valencian Community motorcycle Grand Prix|Valencia]] later in the year. The team's bikes were labelled with the [[Honda]] brand name, even though the [[engine]]s were supplied by Ajo. 2002 was the first season in which Ajo was a regular competitor in the World Championship, with Kallio as their main rider. Their best result that season was fifth place in [[2002 Spanish motorcycle Grand Prix|Jerez]], and Kallio was named \"Rookie of the Year\", beating riders such as [[Andrea Dovizioso]] and [[Jorge Lorenzo]].\n\nIn 2003, the team expanded to two bikes, with Kallio being joined by the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] competitor [[Masao Azuma]]. Kallio then left the team in August after receiving an offer from [[KTM]]. He was replaced by [[Andrea Ballerini]]. In Australia, the team achieved a 1\u20132 victory, with Ballerini in first place and Azuma in second. Ajo attributed a large portion of their success to the combination of wet conditions and [[Bridgestone]] tyres, which are optimal for damp weather. For the 2004 season, the team had two new riders in [[Luk\u00e1\u0161 Pe\u0161ek]] and Danish [[Robbin Harms]]. The season was a disappointing one for Ajo, as Pe\u0161ek crashed repeatedly and as Harms suffered several injuries. Pe\u0161ek moved to the [[Derbi]] team for the next season.\n\nJapanese [[Tomoyoshi Koyama]] and French [[Alexis Masbou]] were Ajo's riders in the 2005 season. Koyama won the \"Rookie of the Year\" title, the team's second in four years. His best results were second place in Australia and third in Turkey; in overall standings he held eighth place. The team kept the same riders for the following year but obtained new bikes from [[Malaguti]]. Both riders suffered many injuries which affected their season. Masbou was only able to ride eight races and did not score any points. Koyama's best result was sixth in Estoril, and he ended in 15th place in the championship standings. In 2007, the team raced with [[Derbi]] bikes, driven by [[Michael Ranseder]] and [[Robert Mure\u0219an]]. Ranseder finished in the points 13 times, while Mure\u0219an failed to score.\n\nAjo Motorsport continued with Derbi for the [[2008 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2008 season]], with [[Mike Di Meglio]] and [[Dominique Aegerter]] as their riders. Di Meglio won four races (France, Catalonia, Germany and Australia) and clinched the world championship in Australia, two races before the end of the season. Aegerter finished eighth twice. [[Sandro Cortese]] accompanied [[Dominique Aegerter]] in [[2009 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2009]]. The team scored several podiums this season but did not manage to win any races. In the [[2010 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2010 season]], Ajo Motorsport fielded [[Marc M\u00e1rquez]], [[Sandro Cortese]] and [[Adri\u00e1n Mart\u00edn]]. The season was a big success for the team. M\u00e1rquez scored twelve poles and ten victories, and brought the team its second title in three years.\n\n==Grand Prix motorcycle results==\n\n([[Template:Motorsport driver results legend|key]]) (Races in '''bold''' indicate pole position; races in ''italics'' indicate fastest lap)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\"\n!

distancing) includes [[infection control]] actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.<ref name=\"hwlyS\" /><ref name=\"Jr48s\" /> Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.<ref name=\"vczEM\" /><ref name=\"eI8fE\" /> The maximum gathering size recommended by US government bodies and health organizations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.<ref name=\"fihKg\" /> On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.<ref name=\"Xj0e8\" />\n\nOlder adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, [[hypertension]], and [[Immunodeficiency|compromised immune systems]] face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.<ref name=\"ruiZf\" /><ref name=\"sKc4Q\" />\n\nIn late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term \"social distancing\" with \"physical distancing\", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either [[telecommunication|virtually]] or at a distance. The use of the term \"social distancing\" had led to implications that people should engage in complete [[social isolation]], rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.<ref name=\"9tsr9\" /><ref name=\"B2DkM\" /><ref name=\"KTIr0\" />\n\nSome authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

His newly assigned field partner is Richard Lymangood ([[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]]). The two patrol Los Angeles at night and give assistance to police forces on the ground.\n\nMurphy is instructed to attend a sunrise demonstration in the [[Mojave Desert]] at \"Pinkville\", and is selected to pilot the world's most advanced helicopter, originally called ''\"The Special\" '' and now nicknamed ''\"Blue Thunder\"''. It is one of two prototypes of a military-style combat aircraft intended for police use in surveillance and against possible large-scale civic disobedience during the then-upcoming 1984 [[1984 Summer Olympics|Olympic games]]. With powerful armament, and other accoutrements such as [[Thermography|thermal infrared]] scanners, powerful [[microphone#Unidirectional|unidirectional microphones]] and cameras, built-in mobile telephone, computer and modem, and a [[U-Matic]] Video Cassette Recorder ([[VCR]]), ''Blue Thunder'' appears to be a formidable tool in the war on crime. Murphy notes wryly that with enough of these helicopters \"you could run the whole damn country.\"\n\nWhen the death of city councilwoman Diana McNeely turns out to be more than just a random murder, Murphy begins his own covert investigation. He discovers that a subversive action group is intending instead to use ''Blue Thunder'' in a military role to quell disorder under the project codename T.H.O.R. (\"Tactical Helicopter Offensive Response\"), and is secretly eliminating political opponents to advance its agenda.\n\nMurphy suspects the involvement of his old wartime nemesis, former [[United States Army]] Colonel F.E. Cochrane ([[Malcolm McDowell]]), the primary test pilot for ''Blue Thunder'' and someone who felt Murphy was \"unsuitable\" for the program. Murphy and Lymangood use ''Blue Thunder'' to record a meeting between Cochrane and the other government officials which would implicate them in the conspiracy, but Cochrane looks outside and sees ''Blue Thunder'' and realizes what has happened. After landing, Lymangood secures the tape and hides it, but is captured upon returning to his home, interrogated, and then killed while trying to escape. Murphy hijacks ''Blue Thunder'' and arranges to have his girlfriend Kate ([[Candy Clark]]) retrieve the tape and deliver it to the local news station, using the helicopter to thwart her pursuers. Kate arrives at the news station, but is almost captured by one of the conspirators; the reporter Kate was sent to find intercepts Kate and gets the tape back, while the conspirator is knocked unconscious by a security guard.\n\nTwo [[Air National Guard]] [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] are deployed to deal with Murphy, but he manages to shoot one down and evade the other. However, in the process, one missile destroys a barbecue stand in [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles|Little Tokyo]] and a second impacts [[ARCO Tower (Los Angeles)|ARCO Tower]] in [[Downtown Los Angeles]].  The operation is then suspended by the mayor. Cochrane, disobeying orders to stand down, ambushes ''Blue Thunder'' in a heavily armed [[MD Helicopters MD 500|Hughes 500]] helicopter, and after a tense battle, Murphy is able to shoot him down after executing a 360\u00b0 loop through use of ''Blue Thunder'''s turbine boost function. Murphy then destroys ''Blue Thunder'' by landing it in front of an approaching freight train.\n\nIn the meantime, the tape is made public and, as a result, the conspirators are arrested.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Roy Scheider]] as Officer Francis McNeil \"Frank\" Murphy\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as Colonel F.

The company opened a [[factory (trading post)|factory]] in [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] on the first voyage, and imports of [[Black pepper|pepper]] from [[Java]] were an important part of the company's trade for twenty years. The factory in Bantam was closed in 1683. During this time ships belonging to the company arriving in India docked at [[Surat]], which was established as a trade transit point in 1608.\n\nIn the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of [[Machilipatnam]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]] of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.\n\n== Foothold in India ==\n{{See also|History of Kolkata#Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)|label 1=Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)}}\n[[File:Reddragonship.jpg|thumb|{{ship||Red Dragon|1595|2}} fought the Portuguese at the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, and made several voyages to the [[East Indies]]]]\n[[File:Jahangir investing a courtier with a robe of honour watched by Sir Thomas Roe, English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615-18, and others.jpg|thumb|275px|The emperor [[Jahangir]] investing a courtier with a robe of honour, watched by [[Sir Thomas Roe]], English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615 to 1618, and others]]\n\nEnglish traders frequently engaged in hostilities with their Dutch and Portuguese counterparts in the Indian Ocean. The company achieved a major victory over the Portuguese in the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, at [[Suvali]] in [[Surat]]. The company decided to explore the feasibility of gaining a territorial foothold in mainland India, with official sanction from both Britain and the [[Mughal Empire]], and requested that the Crown launch a diplomatic mission.<ref name=\"fordham1\">The battle of Plassey ended the tax on the Indian goods.

The company developed a [[lobbying|lobby]] in the English parliament.

The company sought a permanent establishment, while the Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730.\n\nAt this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of \u00a31&nbsp;million.

Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its spiralling cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade.

One governor of the company was even reported as saying in 1864 that he would rather have the saltpetre made than the tax on salt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://salt.org.il/frame_saltpet.html|title=SALTPETER the secret salt \u2013 Salt made the world go round|publisher=salt.org.il|accessdate=2017-07-07}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Basis for the monopoly ==\n\n=== Colonial monopoly ===\n{{further|Great Britain in the Seven Years' War}}\n[[File:India 1835 2 Mohurs (rev).jpg|thumb|upright|An East India Company coin, struck in 1835]]\n[[File:Clive.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Clive]] became the first British [[Governor of Bengal]] after he had instated [[Mir Jafar]] as the [[Nawab of Bengal]]]]\n\nThe Seven Years' War (1756\u20131763) resulted in the defeat of the French forces, limited French imperial ambitions, and stunted the influence of the Industrial Revolution in French territories.

Elsewhere in India, the French were to remain a military threat, particularly during the War of American Independence, and up to the capture of Pondich\u00e9ry in 1793 at the outset of the French Revolutionary Wars without any military presence. Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.\n\nThe East India Company had also been granted competitive advantages over colonial American tea importers to sell tea from its colonies in Asia in American colonies. This led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in which protesters boarded British ships and threw the tea overboard. When protesters successfully prevented the unloading of tea in three other colonies and in Boston, Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.

The great expansion came after 1750, when it had 3,000 regular troops. By 1763, it had 26,000; by 1778, it had 67,000. It recruited largely [[sepoy|Indian troops]] and trained them along European lines.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gerald Bryant |year=1978 |title=Officers of the East India Company's army in the days of Clive and Hastings |journal=The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=203\u2013227 |doi=10.1080/03086537808582508}}</ref> The military arm of the East India Company quickly developed into a private corporate armed force used as an instrument of geo-political power and expansion instead of its original purpose as a guard force. Because of this, the EIC became the most powerful military force in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. As it increased in size, the army was divided into the [[Presidency Armies]] of [[Bengal Army|Bengal]], [[Madras Army|Madras]] and [[Bombay Army|Bombay]], each of which recruited its own [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] [[:Category:Honourable East India Company regiments|units]]. The navy also grew significantly, vastly expanding its [[:Category:Ships of the British East India Company|fleet]]. Although heavily armed merchant vessels, called East Indiamen, composed most of the fleet, it also included warships.\n\n==== Expansion and conquest ====\nThe company, fresh from a colossal victory, and with the backing of its own private, well-disciplined, and experienced army, was able to assert its interests in the [[Carnatic (region)|Carnatic region]] from its base at [[Madras]] and in Bengal from Calcutta, without facing any further obstacles from other colonial powers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson |author2=Robert Shadle |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-X-XYB_ZkIC&pg=PA252|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood |pages=252\u2013254|isbn=978-0-313-29366-5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Shah Alam II, 1790s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]], who with his allies fought against the East India Company during his early years (1760\u20131764), accepted the protection of the British in the year 1803, only after he had been blinded by his enemies and deserted by his subjects]]\n\nIt continued to experience resistance from local rulers during its expansion. Robert Clive led company forces against [[Siraj Ud Daulah]], the last independent [[Nawab]] of Bengal, [[Bihar]], and Midnapore district in Odisha to victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, resulting in the conquest of Bengal. This victory estranged the British and the Mughals, since Siraj Ud Daulah was a Mughal feudatory ally. That led to the [[Battle of Buxar]].\n\nWith the gradual weakening of the [[Maratha]]s in the aftermath of the three [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], the British also secured the Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat, the fort of [[Ahmednagar]], [[Cuttack district|province of Cuttack]] (which included Mughalbandi/the coastal part of [[Odisha]], Garjat/the princely states of Odisha, [[Balasore]] Port, parts of [[Midnapore]] district of West Bengal), Bombay ([[Mumbai]]) and the surrounding areas, leading to a formal end of the Maratha empire and firm establishment of the British East India Company in India.\n\n[[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]], the rulers of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], offered much resistance to the British forces. Having sided with the French during the Revolutionary War, the rulers of Mysore continued their struggle against the company with the four [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. Mysore finally fell to the company forces in 1799, in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war during which Tipu Sultan was killed.\n\n[[File:2-12th Madras Native Infantry at the Battle of Assaye, 1803.

The highest rank to which an Indian soldier could aspire was Subadar-Major (or Risaldar-Major in cavalry units), effectively a senior [[subaltern]] equivalent. Promotion for both British and Indian soldiers was strictly by seniority, so Indian soldiers rarely reached the commissioned ranks of Jamadar or Subadar before they were middle aged at best. They received no training in administration or leadership to make them independent of their British officers.\n\nDuring the wars against the French and their allies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the East India Company's armies were used to seize the colonial possessions of other European nations, including the islands of [[R\u00e9union]] and [[Mauritius]]. Many [[East Indiaman|East India ships]] were seized by the French based on these islands during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. They were taken by the British in a [[Mauritius campaign of 1809\u20131811|hard fought campaign]] by 1811 and the French threat defeated. In the middle of 1809 the Colonial Governor of India, the [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|1st Earl of Minto]] wanted to conquer the lucrative Dutch owned [[Spice islands]] famous for nutmeg, mace and cloves. For the EIC the occupation of these islands meant not only a curtailment of Dutch and French trade and power in the East Indies but also an equivalent gain to the company of the rich trade in spice. In 1810 the islands including [[Banda Neira]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Ternate]] fell to a [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|British invasion]] with little loss. The following year [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Java fell to the British]] which completed the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. Minto appointed Sir [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]] as lieutenant governor of Java. The British held on to the islands until the end of the war - the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814|Anglo-Dutch Treaty]] of 1814 meant that they were handed back to the Dutch. The EIC nevertheless had uprooted a lot of the spice trees for [[Transplanting|transplantation]] throughout the [[British Empire]]. By the 1790s the EIC had established a number of spice gardens in [[Penang]]; by 1815 the gardens had significantly expanded to 13,000 nutmeg trees and as many as 20,000 clove trees.<ref name=\"Milne\">{{cite news |title=Banda, the nutmeg treasure islands |first=Peter |last=Milne |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/16/banda-nutmeg-treasure-islands.html |newspaper=Jakarta Post |location=Jakarta |date=16 Jan 2011 |pages=10\u201311 |accessdate=22 Dec 2011 |quote=But the economic importance of the Bandas was only fleeting.

The growth of tensions between the EIC and the local religious and cultural groups grew in the 19th century as the Protestant revival grew in Great Britain.

The proceeds of the drug-smugglers landing their cargoes at [[Lintin Island]] were paid into the company's factory at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] and by 1825, most of the money needed to buy tea in China was raised by the illegal opium trade.\n\nThe company established a group of trading settlements centred on the Straits of Malacca called the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 to protect its trade route to China and to combat local piracy. The settlements were also used as penal settlements for Indian civilian and military prisoners.\n\nIn 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, [[Lin Zexu]], to curb smuggling. This resulted in the [[First Opium War]] (1839\u201342).

The [[Bengal famine of 1770]], in which one-third of the local population died, caused distress in Britain. Military and administrative costs mounted beyond control in British-administered regions in Bengal because of the ensuing drop in labour productivity.\n\nAt the same time, there was commercial stagnation and trade depression throughout Europe. The directors of the company attempted to avert bankruptcy by appealing to Parliament for financial help. This led to the passing of the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, which gave the company greater autonomy in running its trade in the American colonies, and allowed it an exemption from tea import duties which its colonial competitors were required to pay.\n\nWhen the American colonists and tea merchants were told of this Act, they boycotted the company tea. Although the price of tea had dropped because of the Act, it also validated the [[Townshend Acts]], setting the precedent for the king to impose additional taxes in the future. The arrival of tax-exempt Company tea, undercutting the local merchants, triggered the [[Boston Tea Party]] in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], one of the major events leading up to the [[American Revolution]].\n\n=== Regulating Acts of Parliament ===\n\n==== East India Company Act 1773 ====\nBy the [[Regulating Act of 1773]] (later known as the East India Company Act 1773), the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] imposed a series of administrative and economic reforms; this clearly established Parliament's sovereignty and ultimate control over the company. The Act recognised the company's political functions and clearly established that the \"[[acquisition of sovereignty]] by the subjects of the Crown is on behalf of the Crown and not in its own right\".\n\n[[File:Nawab Mubarak al-Daula of Murshidabad (1770-93) enthroned in durbar.jpg|thumb|Nawab [[Mubarak Ali Khan (Nawab of Bengal)|Mubarak Ali Khan]] with his son in the Nawab's ''[[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]'' with [[British Resident]], Sir [[Sir John D'Oyly, 6th Baronet|John Hadley]]]]\n\nDespite stiff resistance from the East India lobby in Parliament and from the company's shareholders, the Act passed. It introduced substantial governmental control and allowed British India to be formally under the control of the Crown, but leased back to the company at \u00a340,000 for two years. Under the Act's most important provision, a governing Council composed of five members was created in Calcutta. The three members nominated by Parliament and representing the government's interest could, and invariably would, outvote the two Company members. The Council was headed by [[Warren Hastings]], the incumbent governor, who became the first [[governor-general of Bengal]], with an ill-defined authority over the Bombay and Madras Presidencies.<ref>Keay, John (1991).

British judges and magistrates would also be sent to India to administer the legal system. The governor-general and the council would have complete legislative powers. The company was allowed to maintain its virtual monopoly over trade in exchange for the biennial sum and was obligated to export a minimum quantity of goods yearly to Britain. The costs of administration were to be met by the company. The company initially welcomed these provisions, but the annual burden of the payment contributed to the steady decline of its finances.<ref name=\"Anthony, Frank Pages 18- 19\" />\n\n==== East India Company Act 1784 (Pitt's India Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe East India Company Act 1784 ([[Pitt's India Act]]) had two key aspects:\n* Relationship to the British government: the bill differentiated the East India Company's political functions from its commercial activities. In political matters the East India Company was subordinated to the British government directly. To accomplish this, the Act created a [[India Board|Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India]], usually referred to as the Board of Control. The members of the Board were the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], and four [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillors]], nominated by the King. The act specified that the Secretary of State \"shall preside at, and be [[President of the Board of Control|President of the said Board]]\".\n* Internal Administration of British India: the bill laid the foundation for the centralised and bureaucratic British administration of India which would reach its peak at the beginning of the 20th century during the governor-generalship of [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Curzon]].\n\nPitt's Act was deemed a failure because it quickly became apparent that the boundaries between government control and the company's powers were nebulous and highly subjective. The government felt obliged to respond to humanitarian calls for better treatment of local peoples in British-occupied territories. [[Edmund Burke]], a former East India Company shareholder and diplomat, was moved to address the situation and introduced a new Regulating Bill in 1783. The bill was defeated amid lobbying by company loyalists and accusations of nepotism in the bill's recommendations for the appointment of councillors.\n\n==== Act of 1786 ====\n[[File:Surrender of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], receiving two of [[Tipu Sultan]]'s sons as hostages in the year 1793]]\n\nThe Act of 1786 (26 Geo. 3 c. 16) enacted the demand of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Earl Cornwallis]] that the powers of the governor-general be enlarged to empower him, in special cases, to override the majority of his Council and act on his own special responsibility. The Act enabled the offices of the governor-general and the commander-in-chief to be jointly held by the same official.\n\nThis Act clearly demarcated borders between the Crown and the company. After this point, the company functioned as a regularised subsidiary of the Crown, with greater accountability for its actions and reached a stable stage of expansion and consolidation. Having temporarily achieved a state of truce with the Crown, the company continued to expand its influence to nearby territories through threats and coercive actions. By the middle of the 19th century, the company's rule extended across most of India, [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]], and [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], and a fifth of the world's population was under its trading influence. In addition, [[Penang Island]], ceded from the [[Kedah Sultanate]] in Malaya, became the fourth most important settlement, a presidency, of the company's Indian territories.<ref>Langdon, Marcus; [http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ \"Penang: The Fourth Presidency of India 1805\u20131830, Volume One: Ships, Men and Mansions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703023731/http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ |date=3 July 2014 }}, Areca Books, 2013. {{ISBN|978-967-5719-07-3}}</ref>\n\n==== East India Company Act 1793 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe company's charter was renewed for a further 20&nbsp;years by the [[Charter Act of 1793]]. In contrast with the legislative proposals of the previous two decades, the 1793 Act was not a particularly controversial measure, and made only minimal changes to the system of government in India and to British oversight of the company's activities. Sale of liquor was forbidden without licence. It was pointed that the payment of the staff of the board of council should not be made from the Indian revenue.\n\n==== East India Company Act 1813 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Major-General the Hon.

The Indian princes had become vassals of the company. But the expense of wars leading to the total control of India strained the company's finances. The company was forced to petition Parliament for assistance.

After occupying premises in [[Philpot Lane]] from 1600 to 1621; in [[Crosby Hall, London|Crosby House]], [[Bishopsgate]], from 1621 to 1638; and in Leadenhall Street from 1638 to 1648, the company moved into Craven House, an Elizabethan mansion in Leadenhall Street. The building had become known as East India House by 1661. It was completely rebuilt and enlarged in 1726\u20131729; and further significantly remodelled and expanded in 1796\u20131800. It was finally vacated in 1860 and demolished in 1861\u20131862. The site is now occupied by the [[Lloyd's building]].\n\nIn 1607, the company decided to build its own ships and leased a yard on the [[River Thames]] at [[Deptford]]. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an alternative site was acquired at [[Blackwall Yard|Blackwall]]: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.\n\nIn 1803, an Act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the [[East India Docks]]) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the [[West India Docks|West India Dock Company]]. The docks were taken over by the [[Port of London Authority]] in 1909, and closed in 1967.\n\n[[File:Addiscombe Seminary photo c.1859.jpg|thumb|left|[[Addiscombe Military Seminary|Addiscombe Seminary]], photographed in ''c''.1859, with cadets in the foreground]]\n\nThe [[East India Company College|East India College]] was founded in 1806 as a training establishment for \"writers\" (i.e. clerks) in the company's service. It was initially located in [[Hertford Castle]], but moved in 1809 to purpose-built premises at [[Hertford Heath]], Hertfordshire. In 1858 the college closed; but in 1862 the buildings reopened as a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], now [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]].\n\nThe [[Addiscombe Military Seminary|East India Company Military Seminary]] was founded in 1809 at [[Addiscombe]], near [[Croydon]], Surrey, to train young officers for service in the company's armies in India. It was based in Addiscombe Place, an early 18th-century mansion. The government took it over in 1858, and renamed it the Royal Indian Military College. In 1861 it was closed, and the site was subsequently redeveloped.\n\nIn 1818, the company entered into an agreement by which those of its servants who were certified insane in India might be cared for at Pembroke House, [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]], London, a private [[History of psychiatric institutions|lunatic asylum]] run by Dr George Rees until 1838, and thereafter by Dr William Williams.

Although dissolved by the [[East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873]] following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], it stimulated the growth of the [[British Empire]]. Its professionally trained armies rose to dominate the sub-continent and were to become the armies of British India after 1857. It played a key role in introducing English as an official language in India. This also led to [[Macaulayism]] in the Indian subcontinent.\n[[File:Panorama of a durbar procession of Akbar II (Retouched).jpg|thumb|Panorama of a [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] procession of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar II]], 1806-37. The Emperor is followed by the British Resident.]]\nOnce the East India Company took over Bengal in the [[treaty of Allahabad]] (1765) it collected taxes which it used to further its expansion to the rest of India and did not have to rely on venture capital from London. It returned a high profit to those who risked original money for earlier ventures into Bengal.\n\nDuring the first century of the East India Company's expansion in India, most people in India lived under regional kings or Nawabs. By the late 18th century many Moghuls were weak in comparison to the rapidly expanding Company as it took over cities and land, built railways, roads and bridges. The first railway of 21 mile (33.8&nbsp;km),<ref>Rao, M.A. (1988). ''Indian Railways'', New Delhi: National Book Trust, p.15</ref> known as the [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] ran between Bombay (Mumbai) and Tannah (Thane) in 1849. The Company sought quick profits because the financial backers in England took high risks: their money for possible profits or losses through shipwrecks, wars or calamities.\n\nThe increasingly large territory the Company was annexing and collecting taxes was also run by the local Nawabs. In essence, it was a dual administration. Between 1765 and 1772 [[Robert Clive]] gave the responsibility of tax collecting, [[diwani]], to the Indian deputy and judicial and police responsibilities to other Indian deputies. The Company concentrated its new power of collecting revenue and left the responsibilities to the Indian agencies. The East India Company took the beginning steps of British takeover of power in India for centuries to come. In 1772, the Company made [[Warren Hastings]], who had been in India with the Company since 1750, its first governor-general to manage and overview all of the annexed lands. The dual administration system came to an end.\n\nHastings learned Urdu and Persian and took great interest in preserving ancient Sanskrit manuscripts and having them translated into English. He employed many Indians as officials.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=The British East India Company | trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 24,19:11) | medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales.

This is still used in Pakistani and Bangladeshi courts today in civil law. Hastings also annexed lands and kingdoms and enriched himself in the process.

This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the ''Earl of Mornington'', an East India Company [[packet ship]] of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.\n\nIn addition, the company had its own navy, the [[History of the Indian Navy|Bombay Marine]], equipped with warships such as {{ship|HCS|Grappler|1804|2}}. These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Invasion of Java]].\n\nAt the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]], which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, [[Nathaniel Dance]], Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the {{ship||Warley|1796 ship|2}}, led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off. Some six years earlier, on 28 January 1797, five Indiamen, the ''Woodford'', under Captain Charles Lennox, the ''Taunton-Castle'', Captain Edward Studd, ''Canton'', Captain Abel Vyvyan, ''Boddam'', Captain George Palmer, and {{ship||Ocean|1788 EIC ship|2}}, Captain John Christian Lochner, had encountered Admiral [[Pierre C\u00e9sar Charles de Sercey|de Sercey]] and his squadron of frigates. On this occasion the Indiamen also succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired. Lastly, on 15 June 1795, the ''General Goddard'' played a large role in the capture of seven Dutch East Indiamen off [[Saint Helena|St Helena]].\n\n[[East Indiamen]] were large and strongly built and when the [[Royal Navy]] was desperate for vessels to escort merchant convoys it bought several of them to convert to warships.

The company opened a [[factory (trading post)|factory]] in [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] on the first voyage, and imports of [[Black pepper|pepper]] from [[Java]] were an important part of the company's trade for twenty years. The factory in Bantam was closed in 1683. During this time ships belonging to the company arriving in India docked at [[Surat]], which was established as a trade transit point in 1608.\n\nIn the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of [[Machilipatnam]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]] of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.\n\n== Foothold in India ==\n{{See also|History of Kolkata#Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)|label 1=Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)}}\n[[File:Reddragonship.jpg|thumb|{{ship||Red Dragon|1595|2}} fought the Portuguese at the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, and made several voyages to the [[East Indies]]]]\n[[File:Jahangir investing a courtier with a robe of honour watched by Sir Thomas Roe, English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615-18, and others.jpg|thumb|275px|The emperor [[Jahangir]] investing a courtier with a robe of honour, watched by [[Sir Thomas Roe]], English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615 to 1618, and others]]\n\nEnglish traders frequently engaged in hostilities with their Dutch and Portuguese counterparts in the Indian Ocean. The company achieved a major victory over the Portuguese in the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, at [[Suvali]] in [[Surat]]. The company decided to explore the feasibility of gaining a territorial foothold in mainland India, with official sanction from both Britain and the [[Mughal Empire]], and requested that the Crown launch a diplomatic mission.<ref name=\"fordham1\">The battle of Plassey ended the tax on the Indian goods.

The company developed a [[lobbying|lobby]] in the English parliament. Under pressure from ambitious tradesmen and former associates of the company (pejoratively termed ''Interlopers'' by the company), who wanted to establish private trading firms in India, a deregulating act was passed in 1694.<ref name=\"victorianweb.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://victorianweb.org/history/empire/india/eic.html|title=The British East India Company \u2014 the Company that Owned a Nation (or Two)|website=victorianweb.org}}</ref>\n\nThis allowed any English firm to trade with India, unless specifically prohibited by act of parliament, thereby annulling the charter that had been in force for almost 100 years.

The companies merged in 1708, by a tripartite indenture involving both companies and the state, with the charter and agreement for the new ''United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies'' being awarded by the [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3t0TAAAAQAAJ|title=Charters Relating to the East India Company from 1600 to 1761: Reprinted from a Former Collection with Some Additions and a Preface for the Government of Madras|last=Company|first=East India|last2=Shaw|first2=John|date=1887|publisher=R.

The company sought a permanent establishment, while the Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730.\n\nAt this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of \u00a31&nbsp;million. Between 1756 and 1763, the [[Seven Years' War]] diverted the state's attention towards consolidation and [[French and Indian War|defence of its territorial possessions]] in Europe and its [[English colonization of the Americas|colonies in North America]].<ref name=\"oxforddnb.com\">Thomas, P.

In 1757, the [[Law Officers of the Crown]] delivered the [[Pratt\u2013Yorke opinion]] distinguishing overseas territories acquired by [[right of conquest]] from those acquired by private [[treaty]]. The opinion asserted that, while the Crown of Great Britain enjoyed sovereignty over both, only the property of the former was vested in the Crown.<ref name=\"oxforddnb.com\" />\n\nWith the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]], Britain surged ahead of its European rivals. Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its spiralling cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade.

Elsewhere in India, the French were to remain a military threat, particularly during the War of American Independence, and up to the capture of Pondich\u00e9ry in 1793 at the outset of the French Revolutionary Wars without any military presence. Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.\n\nThe East India Company had also been granted competitive advantages over colonial American tea importers to sell tea from its colonies in Asia in American colonies. This led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in which protesters boarded British ships and threw the tea overboard. When protesters successfully prevented the unloading of tea in three other colonies and in Boston, Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.

Because of this, the EIC became the most powerful military force in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. As it increased in size, the army was divided into the [[Presidency Armies]] of [[Bengal Army|Bengal]], [[Madras Army|Madras]] and [[Bombay Army|Bombay]], each of which recruited its own [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] [[:Category:Honourable East India Company regiments|units]]. The navy also grew significantly, vastly expanding its [[:Category:Ships of the British East India Company|fleet]]. Although heavily armed merchant vessels, called East Indiamen, composed most of the fleet, it also included warships.\n\n==== Expansion and conquest ====\nThe company, fresh from a colossal victory, and with the backing of its own private, well-disciplined, and experienced army, was able to assert its interests in the [[Carnatic (region)|Carnatic region]] from its base at [[Madras]] and in Bengal from Calcutta, without facing any further obstacles from other colonial powers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson |author2=Robert Shadle |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-X-XYB_ZkIC&pg=PA252|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood |pages=252\u2013254|isbn=978-0-313-29366-5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Shah Alam II, 1790s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]], who with his allies fought against the East India Company during his early years (1760\u20131764), accepted the protection of the British in the year 1803, only after he had been blinded by his enemies and deserted by his subjects]]\n\nIt continued to experience resistance from local rulers during its expansion. Robert Clive led company forces against [[Siraj Ud Daulah]], the last independent [[Nawab]] of Bengal, [[Bihar]], and Midnapore district in Odisha to victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, resulting in the conquest of Bengal. This victory estranged the British and the Mughals, since Siraj Ud Daulah was a Mughal feudatory ally. That led to the [[Battle of Buxar]].\n\nWith the gradual weakening of the [[Maratha]]s in the aftermath of the three [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], the British also secured the Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat, the fort of [[Ahmednagar]], [[Cuttack district|province of Cuttack]] (which included Mughalbandi/the coastal part of [[Odisha]], Garjat/the princely states of Odisha, [[Balasore]] Port, parts of [[Midnapore]] district of West Bengal), Bombay ([[Mumbai]]) and the surrounding areas, leading to a formal end of the Maratha empire and firm establishment of the British East India Company in India.\n\n[[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]], the rulers of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], offered much resistance to the British forces. Having sided with the French during the Revolutionary War, the rulers of Mysore continued their struggle against the company with the four [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. Mysore finally fell to the company forces in 1799, in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war during which Tipu Sultan was killed.\n\n[[File:2-12th Madras Native Infantry at the Battle of Assaye, 1803.

The highest rank to which an Indian soldier could aspire was Subadar-Major (or Risaldar-Major in cavalry units), effectively a senior [[subaltern]] equivalent. Promotion for both British and Indian soldiers was strictly by seniority, so Indian soldiers rarely reached the commissioned ranks of Jamadar or Subadar before they were middle aged at best. They received no training in administration or leadership to make them independent of their British officers.\n\nDuring the wars against the French and their allies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the East India Company's armies were used to seize the colonial possessions of other European nations, including the islands of [[R\u00e9union]] and [[Mauritius]]. Many [[East Indiaman|East India ships]] were seized by the French based on these islands during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. They were taken by the British in a [[Mauritius campaign of 1809\u20131811|hard fought campaign]] by 1811 and the French threat defeated. In the middle of 1809 the Colonial Governor of India, the [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|1st Earl of Minto]] wanted to conquer the lucrative Dutch owned [[Spice islands]] famous for nutmeg, mace and cloves. For the EIC the occupation of these islands meant not only a curtailment of Dutch and French trade and power in the East Indies but also an equivalent gain to the company of the rich trade in spice. In 1810 the islands including [[Banda Neira]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Ternate]] fell to a [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|British invasion]] with little loss. The following year [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Java fell to the British]] which completed the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. Minto appointed Sir [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]] as lieutenant governor of Java. The British held on to the islands until the end of the war - the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814|Anglo-Dutch Treaty]] of 1814 meant that they were handed back to the Dutch. The EIC nevertheless had uprooted a lot of the spice trees for [[Transplanting|transplantation]] throughout the [[British Empire]]. By the 1790s the EIC had established a number of spice gardens in [[Penang]]; by 1815 the gardens had significantly expanded to 13,000 nutmeg trees and as many as 20,000 clove trees.<ref name=\"Milne\">{{cite news |title=Banda, the nutmeg treasure islands |first=Peter |last=Milne |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/16/banda-nutmeg-treasure-islands.html |newspaper=Jakarta Post |location=Jakarta |date=16 Jan 2011 |pages=10\u201311 |accessdate=22 Dec 2011 |quote=But the economic importance of the Bandas was only fleeting.

The proceeds of the drug-smugglers landing their cargoes at [[Lintin Island]] were paid into the company's factory at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] and by 1825, most of the money needed to buy tea in China was raised by the illegal opium trade.\n\nThe company established a group of trading settlements centred on the Straits of Malacca called the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 to protect its trade route to China and to combat local piracy. The settlements were also used as penal settlements for Indian civilian and military prisoners.\n\nIn 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, [[Lin Zexu]], to curb smuggling. This resulted in the [[First Opium War]] (1839\u201342). After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain under the [[Treaty of Nanking]] and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and other nations.<ref name=\"Windle 2012 55\u201374\" /> The Jardines and [[Apcar and Company]] dominated the trade, although [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] also tried to take a share.<ref>{{cite book|page=103|last=Harcourt|first=Freda|title=Flagships of Imperialism: The P & O Company and the Politics of Empire from Its Origins to 1867 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HmMLqQXmIkMC&pg=PA103|year=2006|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-1-84779-145-0}}</ref> A [[Second Opium War]] fought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led to the [[Treaty of Tientsin]], which legalised the importation of opium.

The [[Bengal famine of 1770]], in which one-third of the local population died, caused distress in Britain. Military and administrative costs mounted beyond control in British-administered regions in Bengal because of the ensuing drop in labour productivity.\n\nAt the same time, there was commercial stagnation and trade depression throughout Europe. The directors of the company attempted to avert bankruptcy by appealing to Parliament for financial help. This led to the passing of the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, which gave the company greater autonomy in running its trade in the American colonies, and allowed it an exemption from tea import duties which its colonial competitors were required to pay.\n\nWhen the American colonists and tea merchants were told of this Act, they boycotted the company tea. Although the price of tea had dropped because of the Act, it also validated the [[Townshend Acts]], setting the precedent for the king to impose additional taxes in the future. The arrival of tax-exempt Company tea, undercutting the local merchants, triggered the [[Boston Tea Party]] in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], one of the major events leading up to the [[American Revolution]].\n\n=== Regulating Acts of Parliament ===\n\n==== East India Company Act 1773 ====\nBy the [[Regulating Act of 1773]] (later known as the East India Company Act 1773), the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] imposed a series of administrative and economic reforms; this clearly established Parliament's sovereignty and ultimate control over the company. The Act recognised the company's political functions and clearly established that the \"[[acquisition of sovereignty]] by the subjects of the Crown is on behalf of the Crown and not in its own right\".\n\n[[File:Nawab Mubarak al-Daula of Murshidabad (1770-93) enthroned in durbar.jpg|thumb|Nawab [[Mubarak Ali Khan (Nawab of Bengal)|Mubarak Ali Khan]] with his son in the Nawab's ''[[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]'' with [[British Resident]], Sir [[Sir John D'Oyly, 6th Baronet|John Hadley]]]]\n\nDespite stiff resistance from the East India lobby in Parliament and from the company's shareholders, the Act passed. It introduced substantial governmental control and allowed British India to be formally under the control of the Crown, but leased back to the company at \u00a340,000 for two years. Under the Act's most important provision, a governing Council composed of five members was created in Calcutta. The three members nominated by Parliament and representing the government's interest could, and invariably would, outvote the two Company members. The Council was headed by [[Warren Hastings]], the incumbent governor, who became the first [[governor-general of Bengal]], with an ill-defined authority over the Bombay and Madras Presidencies.<ref>Keay, John (1991). ''The Honourable Company: A History of the English East India Company''. Macmillan Publishing Company, New York p. 385.</ref> His nomination, made by the Court of Directors, would in future be subject to the approval of a [[Council of Four from India|Council of Four]] appointed by the Crown.

British judges and magistrates would also be sent to India to administer the legal system. The governor-general and the council would have complete legislative powers. The company was allowed to maintain its virtual monopoly over trade in exchange for the biennial sum and was obligated to export a minimum quantity of goods yearly to Britain. The costs of administration were to be met by the company. The company initially welcomed these provisions, but the annual burden of the payment contributed to the steady decline of its finances.<ref name=\"Anthony, Frank Pages 18- 19\" />\n\n==== East India Company Act 1784 (Pitt's India Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe East India Company Act 1784 ([[Pitt's India Act]]) had two key aspects:\n* Relationship to the British government: the bill differentiated the East India Company's political functions from its commercial activities. In political matters the East India Company was subordinated to the British government directly. To accomplish this, the Act created a [[India Board|Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India]], usually referred to as the Board of Control. The members of the Board were the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], and four [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillors]], nominated by the King. The act specified that the Secretary of State \"shall preside at, and be [[President of the Board of Control|President of the said Board]]\".\n* Internal Administration of British India: the bill laid the foundation for the centralised and bureaucratic British administration of India which would reach its peak at the beginning of the 20th century during the governor-generalship of [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Curzon]].\n\nPitt's Act was deemed a failure because it quickly became apparent that the boundaries between government control and the company's powers were nebulous and highly subjective. The government felt obliged to respond to humanitarian calls for better treatment of local peoples in British-occupied territories. [[Edmund Burke]], a former East India Company shareholder and diplomat, was moved to address the situation and introduced a new Regulating Bill in 1783. The bill was defeated amid lobbying by company loyalists and accusations of nepotism in the bill's recommendations for the appointment of councillors.\n\n==== Act of 1786 ====\n[[File:Surrender of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], receiving two of [[Tipu Sultan]]'s sons as hostages in the year 1793]]\n\nThe Act of 1786 (26 Geo. 3 c. 16) enacted the demand of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Earl Cornwallis]] that the powers of the governor-general be enlarged to empower him, in special cases, to override the majority of his Council and act on his own special responsibility. The Act enabled the offices of the governor-general and the commander-in-chief to be jointly held by the same official.\n\nThis Act clearly demarcated borders between the Crown and the company. After this point, the company functioned as a regularised subsidiary of the Crown, with greater accountability for its actions and reached a stable stage of expansion and consolidation. Having temporarily achieved a state of truce with the Crown, the company continued to expand its influence to nearby territories through threats and coercive actions. By the middle of the 19th century, the company's rule extended across most of India, [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]], and [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], and a fifth of the world's population was under its trading influence. In addition, [[Penang Island]], ceded from the [[Kedah Sultanate]] in Malaya, became the fourth most important settlement, a presidency, of the company's Indian territories.<ref>Langdon, Marcus; [http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ \"Penang: The Fourth Presidency of India 1805\u20131830, Volume One: Ships, Men and Mansions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703023731/http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ |date=3 July 2014 }}, Areca Books, 2013. {{ISBN|978-967-5719-07-3}}</ref>\n\n==== East India Company Act 1793 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe company's charter was renewed for a further 20&nbsp;years by the [[Charter Act of 1793]]. In contrast with the legislative proposals of the previous two decades, the 1793 Act was not a particularly controversial measure, and made only minimal changes to the system of government in India and to British oversight of the company's activities. Sale of liquor was forbidden without licence. It was pointed that the payment of the staff of the board of council should not be made from the Indian revenue.\n\n==== East India Company Act 1813 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Major-General the Hon.

The Indian princes had become vassals of the company. But the expense of wars leading to the total control of India strained the company's finances. The company was forced to petition Parliament for assistance. This was the background to the [[Charter Act of 1813]] which, among other things:\n* asserted the sovereignty of the British Crown over the Indian territories held by the company;\n* renewed the charter of the company for a further twenty years, but\n** deprived the company of its Indian trade monopoly except for trade in tea and the trade with China\n** required the company to maintain separate and distinct its commercial and territorial accounts\n* opened India to missionaries\n\n==== Government of India Act 1833 ====\nThe Industrial Revolution in Britain, the consequent search for markets, and the rise of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic ideology form the background to the [[Saint Helena Act 1833|Government of India Act 1833]] (3 & 4 Will. 4 c. 85). The Act:\n* removed the company's remaining trade monopolies and divested it of all its commercial functions\n* renewed for another twenty years the company's political and administrative authority\n* invested the Board of Control with full power and authority over the company.

The site is now occupied by the [[Lloyd's building]].\n\nIn 1607, the company decided to build its own ships and leased a yard on the [[River Thames]] at [[Deptford]]. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an alternative site was acquired at [[Blackwall Yard|Blackwall]]: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.\n\nIn 1803, an Act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the [[East India Docks]]) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the [[West India Docks|West India Dock Company]]. The docks were taken over by the [[Port of London Authority]] in 1909, and closed in 1967.\n\n[[File:Addiscombe Seminary photo c.1859.jpg|thumb|left|[[Addiscombe Military Seminary|Addiscombe Seminary]], photographed in ''c''.1859, with cadets in the foreground]]\n\nThe [[East India Company College|East India College]] was founded in 1806 as a training establishment for \"writers\" (i.e. clerks) in the company's service. It was initially located in [[Hertford Castle]], but moved in 1809 to purpose-built premises at [[Hertford Heath]], Hertfordshire. In 1858 the college closed; but in 1862 the buildings reopened as a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], now [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]].\n\nThe [[Addiscombe Military Seminary|East India Company Military Seminary]] was founded in 1809 at [[Addiscombe]], near [[Croydon]], Surrey, to train young officers for service in the company's armies in India. It was based in Addiscombe Place, an early 18th-century mansion. The government took it over in 1858, and renamed it the Royal Indian Military College. In 1861 it was closed, and the site was subsequently redeveloped.\n\nIn 1818, the company entered into an agreement by which those of its servants who were certified insane in India might be cared for at Pembroke House, [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]], London, a private [[History of psychiatric institutions|lunatic asylum]] run by Dr George Rees until 1838, and thereafter by Dr William Williams. The arrangement outlasted the company itself, continuing until 1870, when the India Office opened its own asylum, the [[Hanwell#Healthcare|Royal India Asylum]], at [[Hanwell]], Middlesex.<ref>Farrington 1976, pp. 125\u2013132.</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Diane K. |last1=Bolton |first2=Patricia E.

Although dissolved by the [[East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873]] following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], it stimulated the growth of the [[British Empire]]. Its professionally trained armies rose to dominate the sub-continent and were to become the armies of British India after 1857. It played a key role in introducing English as an official language in India. This also led to [[Macaulayism]] in the Indian subcontinent.\n[[File:Panorama of a durbar procession of Akbar II (Retouched).jpg|thumb|Panorama of a [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] procession of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar II]], 1806-37. The Emperor is followed by the British Resident.]]\nOnce the East India Company took over Bengal in the [[treaty of Allahabad]] (1765) it collected taxes which it used to further its expansion to the rest of India and did not have to rely on venture capital from London. It returned a high profit to those who risked original money for earlier ventures into Bengal.\n\nDuring the first century of the East India Company's expansion in India, most people in India lived under regional kings or Nawabs. By the late 18th century many Moghuls were weak in comparison to the rapidly expanding Company as it took over cities and land, built railways, roads and bridges. The first railway of 21 mile (33.8&nbsp;km),<ref>Rao, M.A. (1988). ''Indian Railways'', New Delhi: National Book Trust, p.15</ref> known as the [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] ran between Bombay (Mumbai) and Tannah (Thane) in 1849. The Company sought quick profits because the financial backers in England took high risks: their money for possible profits or losses through shipwrecks, wars or calamities.\n\nThe increasingly large territory the Company was annexing and collecting taxes was also run by the local Nawabs. In essence, it was a dual administration. Between 1765 and 1772 [[Robert Clive]] gave the responsibility of tax collecting, [[diwani]], to the Indian deputy and judicial and police responsibilities to other Indian deputies. The Company concentrated its new power of collecting revenue and left the responsibilities to the Indian agencies. The East India Company took the beginning steps of British takeover of power in India for centuries to come. In 1772, the Company made [[Warren Hastings]], who had been in India with the Company since 1750, its first governor-general to manage and overview all of the annexed lands. The dual administration system came to an end.\n\nHastings learned Urdu and Persian and took great interest in preserving ancient Sanskrit manuscripts and having them translated into English. He employed many Indians as officials.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=The British East India Company | trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 24,19:11) | medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales.

This is still used in Pakistani and Bangladeshi courts today in civil law. Hastings also annexed lands and kingdoms and enriched himself in the process.

Cornwallis distrusted Indians and replaced Indians with Englishmen. He introduced a system of personal land ownership for Indians.

With the [[Acts of Union 1707]], the canton was changed to the new [[Evolution of UK Flag|Union Flag]]\u2014consisting of an English St George's Cross combined with a Scottish [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's cross]]\u2014representing the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. After the [[Acts of Union 1800]] that joined Ireland with Great Britain to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], the canton of the East India Company flag was altered accordingly to include a [[Saint Patrick's Saltire]].\n\nThere has been much debate about the number and order of stripes in the field of the flag.

This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the ''Earl of Mornington'', an East India Company [[packet ship]] of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.\n\nIn addition, the company had its own navy, the [[History of the Indian Navy|Bombay Marine]], equipped with warships such as {{ship|HCS|Grappler|1804|2}}. These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Invasion of Java]].\n\nAt the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]], which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, [[Nathaniel Dance]], Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the {{ship||Warley|1796 ship|2}}, led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off. Some six years earlier, on 28 January 1797, five Indiamen, the ''Woodford'', under Captain Charles Lennox, the ''Taunton-Castle'', Captain Edward Studd, ''Canton'', Captain Abel Vyvyan, ''Boddam'', Captain George Palmer, and {{ship||Ocean|1788 EIC ship|2}}, Captain John Christian Lochner, had encountered Admiral [[Pierre C\u00e9sar Charles de Sercey|de Sercey]] and his squadron of frigates. On this occasion the Indiamen also succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired. Lastly, on 15 June 1795, the ''General Goddard'' played a large role in the capture of seven Dutch East Indiamen off [[Saint Helena|St Helena]].\n\n[[East Indiamen]] were large and strongly built and when the [[Royal Navy]] was desperate for vessels to escort merchant convoys it bought several of them to convert to warships. ''Earl of Mornington'' became HMS ''Drake''.
