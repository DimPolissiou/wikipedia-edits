In 1863 and 1864 it was temporarily known as the Mounted Infantry, 123rd Regiment as part of Wilder's Lightning Brigade.\n\n==Service==\nThis regiment was organized at Camp Terry, [[Mattoon, Illinois|Mattoon]], [[Coles County]], [[Illinois]], by Colonel James Monroe, who at the time was major of the [[7th Illinois Volunteer Regiment|7th Illinois Infantry]].<ref>[http://genealogytrails.com/ill/coles/page9.html History of the 123rd Illinois Infantry]</ref> Companies A, C, D, H, I and K were from Coles County; B from [[Cumberland County, Illinois|Cumberland]]; E from [[Clark County, Illinois|Clark]]; F and G from Clark and [[Crawford County, Illinois|Crawford]]. As a colonel in 1861, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] organized his first command, the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], in Mattoon.\n\nIt was mustered into service on September 6, 1862, with James Monroe as Colonel, Jonathan Biggs, of Westfield, Clark County, as Lieutenant Colonel, and James A. Connolly, of [[Charleston, Illinois]], as Major. On 19 September 1862, the Regiment was loaded into freight cars at Mattoon, and transported to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where it was at once put to work, under Major General [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]], to fortify the city against Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]], who was then advancing on it in pursuit of Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]].\n\nOn October 1, having been assigned to the Thirty-third Brigade (General [[William R. Terrill]]), Fourth Division (General [[James S. Jackson]]), in [[Alexander McDowell McCook|McCook's Corps]], the regiment started on the march under Buell, southward through Kentucky, after Bragg, who had turned back, and up to this time the regiment never had battalion drill, and hardly an attempt at company drill, as all the officers, except the colonel, were \"raw recruits\".\n\nJust 19 days after leaving Mattoon, the regiment engaged in the [[Battle of Perryville]], where 36 men were killed in action and 180 wounded.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bitsofblueandgray.com/readers.htm |title=Story of Corporal William Jared |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514031518/http://www.bitsofblueandgray.com/readers.htm |archive-date=2008-05-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Generals Terrill and Jackson were both killed immediately behind and within twenty feet of the line of the regiment. Among the wounded were Captain Coblentz of Company E, First Lieutenant S. M. Shepard of Company A and Adjutant Leander H. Hamlin. Following the devastating bloodshed the 123rd was assigned to protect the railroad bridge across the Green River at [[Munfordville]], [[Kentucky]], in November and December 1862. It has become known as the \"Battle for the Bridge,\" which began when the Union garrison led by [[John T. Wilder]], prior to his assuming command of the 123rd, surrendered during the [[Battle of Munfordville]].\n\nThe 123rd was initially assigned to the [[Army of the Ohio]] from September 1862 to November 1862, and then to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] from November 1862 to June 1865. The commanding general of the Army of the Cumberland was [[William Rosecrans]]. The regiment was in the 1st Brigade with Colonel Albert S. Hall, which was part of the 5th Division commanded by Brigadier General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]], reporting to Major General [[George Henry Thomas]]. \n\nIn February and March 1863, it was converted to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois' brigade became known as \"Wilder's [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]]\" commanded by [[John T. Wilder|Wilder]]. The brigade remained the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division, XIV Army Corps after its conversion. During this conversion, [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], were adopted as the command's primary weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> The 123rd first used its new rifles in the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref>[http://howcanamandiebetter.com/the-lightning-brigade]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade\" the 123rd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\n\nThe new increase in firepower that the Spencer gave, allowed the 123rd and its brigade mates to maul numerically superior Confederate infantry and cavalry in several engagements. The regiment served quite well through the remainder of the [[Tullahoma campaign|Tullahoma Campaign]] and as part of the Lightning Brigade, was one of the few positive notes in the calamitous [[Chickamauga Campaign]]. \n\nDuring the [[Siege of Chattanooga]], the Lightning Brigade disbanded, and four of its regiments shifted to the Cavalry Corps where they served for the remainder of the war. The 123rd and the 72nd Indiana were sent to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Selma]], First Lieutenant O. J. McManus, Sergeants J. S. Mullen and Henry E. Cross, Corporal McMurry and Privates Daniel Cook, John Bowman, Marion White and Henry Woodruff were killed, with 50 wounded, including Lieutenant Colonel Biggs, Adjutant L. B. Bane, Captains W. E. Adams and Owen Wiley, Lieutenants Alex. McNutt and J. R. Harding.\n\nLate in the war, the regiment pursued Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |title=Battle Near Rome, Georgia, October 12, 1864 |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707060209/http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The unit was instrumental in the capture of former Confederate capital [[Montgomery, Alabama]].\n\nIn June 1865 new recruits and some veterans were transferred to the [[61st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|61st Regiment]] as the 123rd prepared to disband.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/1-123in.htm 1st Battalion, 123d Infantry]</ref> Those who remained were mustered out June 27, 1865, by Captain L.

In 1863 and 1864 it was temporarily known as the Mounted Infantry, 123rd Regiment as part of Wilder's Lightning Brigade.\n\n==Service==\nThis regiment was organized at Camp Terry, [[Mattoon, Illinois|Mattoon]], [[Coles County]], [[Illinois]], by Colonel James Monroe, who at the time was major of the [[7th Illinois Volunteer Regiment|7th Illinois Infantry]].<ref>[http://genealogytrails.com/ill/coles/page9.html History of the 123rd Illinois Infantry]</ref> Companies A, C, D, H, I and K were from Coles County; B from [[Cumberland County, Illinois|Cumberland]]; E from [[Clark County, Illinois|Clark]]; F and G from Clark and [[Crawford County, Illinois|Crawford]]. As a colonel in 1861, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] organized his first command, the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], in Mattoon.\n\nIt was mustered into service on September 6, 1862, with James Monroe as Colonel, Jonathan Biggs, of Westfield, Clark County, as Lieutenant Colonel, and James A. Connolly, of [[Charleston, Illinois]], as Major. On 19 September 1862, the Regiment was loaded into freight cars at Mattoon, and transported to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where it was at once put to work, under Major General [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]], to fortify the city against Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]], who was then advancing on it in pursuit of Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]].\n\nOn October 1, having been assigned to the Thirty-third Brigade (General [[William R. Terrill]]), Fourth Division (General [[James S. Jackson]]), in [[Alexander McDowell McCook|McCook's Corps]], the regiment started on the march under Buell, southward through Kentucky, after Bragg, who had turned back, and up to this time the regiment never had battalion drill, and hardly an attempt at company drill, as all the officers, except the colonel, were \"raw recruits\".\n\nJust 19 days after leaving Mattoon, the regiment engaged in the [[Battle of Perryville]], where 36 men were killed in action and 180 wounded.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bitsofblueandgray.com/readers.htm |title=Story of Corporal William Jared |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514031518/http://www.bitsofblueandgray.com/readers.htm |archive-date=2008-05-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Generals Terrill and Jackson were both killed immediately behind and within twenty feet of the line of the regiment. Among the wounded were Captain Coblentz of Company E, First Lieutenant S. M. Shepard of Company A and Adjutant Leander H. Hamlin. Following the devastating bloodshed the 123rd was assigned to protect the railroad bridge across the Green River at [[Munfordville]], [[Kentucky]], in November and December 1862. It has become known as the \"Battle for the Bridge,\" which began when the Union garrison led by [[John T. Wilder]], prior to his assuming command of the 123rd, surrendered during the [[Battle of Munfordville]].\n\nThe 123rd was initially assigned to the [[Army of the Ohio]] from September 1862 to November 1862, and then to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] from November 1862 to June 1865. The commanding general of the Army of the Cumberland was [[William Rosecrans]]. The regiment was in the 1st Brigade with Colonel Albert S. Hall, which was part of the 5th Division commanded by Brigadier General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]], reporting to Major General [[George Henry Thomas]]. \n\nIn February and March 1863, it was converted to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois' brigade became known as \"Wilder's [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]]\" commanded by [[John T. Wilder|Wilder]]. The brigade remained the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division, XIV Army Corps after its conversion. During this conversion, [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], were adopted as the command's primary weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> The 123rd first used its new rifles in the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref>[http://howcanamandiebetter.com/the-lightning-brigade]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade\" the 123rd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\n\nThe new increase in firepower that the Spencer gave, allowed the 123rd and its brigade mates to maul numerically superior Confederate infantry and cavalry in several engagements. The regiment served quite well through the remainder of the [[Tullahoma campaign|Tullahoma Campaign]] and as part of the Lightning Brigade, was one of the few positive notes in the calamitous [[Chickamauga Campaign]]. \n\nDuring the [[Siege of Chattanooga]], the Lightning Brigade disbanded, and four of its regiments shifted to the Cavalry Corps where they served for the remainder of the war. The 123rd and the 72nd Indiana were sent to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Selma]], First Lieutenant O. J. McManus, Sergeants J. S. Mullen and Henry E. Cross, Corporal McMurry and Privates Daniel Cook, John Bowman, Marion White and Henry Woodruff were killed, with 50 wounded, including Lieutenant Colonel Biggs, Adjutant L. B. Bane, Captains W. E. Adams and Owen Wiley, Lieutenants Alex. McNutt and J. R. Harding.\n\nLate in the war, the regiment pursued Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |title=Battle Near Rome, Georgia, October 12, 1864 |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707060209/http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The unit was instrumental in the capture of former Confederate capital [[Montgomery, Alabama]].\n\nIn June 1865 new recruits and some veterans were transferred to the [[61st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|61st Regiment]] as the 123rd prepared to disband.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/1-123in.htm 1st Battalion, 123d Infantry]</ref> Those who remained were mustered out June 27, 1865, by Captain L.

It was published on [[Sh\u014dsetsuka ni Nar\u014d]], an internet web novel website, between October 2008 and March 2011. Sat\u014d reached a deal with [[Dengeki Bunko]] and began releasing his work in a [[light novel]] format beginning July 2011. The story takes place in an [[alternate history]] where magic exists and is polished through technology, and follows Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba, siblings who enroll into First High magic high school. While keeping their connections to the infamous Yotsuba clan secret, they attempt to live their daily life in peace where Tatsuya is not shunned for his apparent ineptness and Miyuki is validated for her magical abilities.\n\nIn 2013, each [[story arc]] received a [[manga]] adaptation with varying [[manga artist]]s and publishers. That same year, an [[anime]] adaptation by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] was announced and was broadcast between April and September 2014. ''The Irregular at Magic High School'' franchise had been localized for English by two companies: The light novels and one of the manga adaptations are licensed by [[Yen Press]] while [[Aniplex of America]] licensed the anime series. The anime series was [[simulcast]]ed on four networks, and was later made available on [[Netflix]]. An [[The Irregular at Magic High School The Movie: The Girl Who Calls the Stars|anime film]] featuring an original story by Sat\u014d premiered in Japan on June 17, 2017, while a second season taking place after the anime series by [[Eight Bit (studio)|Eight Bit]] is scheduled to premiere in October 2020.\n\nThe series has been well received. The light novels appeared on Sugoi Japan's 2015 polls and since 2011, is one of the top selling series in Japan with 10 million copies sold as of 2019. In addition, its manga and anime adaptations also appeared on top selling charts. English reviewers had mixed to negative reception towards the anime adaptation. The complex technicality of magic within the series was received warmly but the exposition was criticized for being heavy, unclear, and poorly executed.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\nThe series is set in a world with an [[alternate history]], where magic exists and has been polished through modern technology. However, the ability to use magic is determined by genetics, limiting the number of magicians in existence. Following the [[World War III|Third World War]], the world's [[superpower]]s shifted to these four nations: The [[North American Union|United States of North America]] (USNA), New [[Soviet Union]], the Great Asian Alliance, and Japan. In Japan, the magic community is informally governed by the ten master clans in lieu of the government. Due to the limited number of magicians, they are treated as a commodity and are forced to enter magic related schools and professions. Nine magic high schools exist in Japan; they each specialize in different aspects of magic and are simply referred to by their numbers.\n\n===Plot===\nThe story follows Tatsuya Shiba, a bodyguard to his sister Miyuki Shiba who is also a candidate to succeed the leadership of the Yotsuba clan, one of the Ten Master Clans that govern Japan's magicians. They enroll into First High School which segregates its students based on their magical abilities. Miyuki is enrolled as a first course student and is viewed as one of the best students, while Tatsuya is in the second course and considered to be magically inept. However, Tatsuya's technical knowledge, combat abilities, and unique magic techniques cause people to view him as an irregular to the school's standardized rankings.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n;{{Nihongo4|{{vanchor|Tatsuya Shiba}}|\u53f8\u6ce2 \u9054\u4e5f|Shiba Tatsuya}} and {{Nihongo4|{{vanchor|Miyuki Shiba}}|\u53f8\u6ce2 \u6df1\u96ea|Shiba Miyuki}}\nTatsuya and Miyuki are siblings of the same school year and children to Tatsurou Shiba and the late Miya Yotsuba;{{Ref|LN|LN 3.2}} their parents had a loveless [[forced marriage]], and when their mother died, their father married his mistress, Sayuri Furuha, leaving the siblings to live by themselves.{{Ref|LN|LN 6.2}} Maya Yotsuba, their aunt and the current leader of the Yotsuba Clan, was the reason Tatsuya was born with the unique magic to decompose, reconstruct, and detonate matter.{{Ref|LN|LN 16.6}} Out of fear of his powers, the Yotsuba Clan leadership of that time argued for Tatsuya's death, forcing Miya and Maya to take measures to ensure his survival: the first was Miyuki's creation who would act as a seal to Tatsuya's power; the second was to magically dull Tatsuya's emotions except for his familial love towards Miyuki; and the third was to assign Tatsuya to be Miyuki's bodyguard in order to develop his sense of loyalty towards her.{{Ref|LN|LN 16.6}} During a family vacation in Okinawa, Tatsuya warded off an invasion by the Great Asian Alliance and joined the 101 Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion which is headed by [[Major]] Kazama Harunobu.{{Ref|LN|LN 8.7}} At some point during his life Tatsuya developed an interest in engineering magical technology and commercialized revolutionary technology through his family's company, Four Leaves Technology, under the pseudonymous identity Taurus Silver.{{Ref|LN|LN 3.2}} He is voiced by [[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Yuichi Nakamura]].<ref name=\"Staff and Cast\">{{cite web| url=http://mahouka.us/staff/| title=Staff and Cast| publisher=Mahouka.Us| accessdate=October 2, 2015| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929154100/http://mahouka.us/staff/| archivedate=September 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMiyuki is considered one of the strongest magicians in the world and is a candidate to succeed her Aunt Maya as the leader of the Yotsuba Clan.

It was published on [[Sh\u014dsetsuka ni Nar\u014d]], an internet web novel website, between October 2008 and March 2011. Sat\u014d reached a deal with [[Dengeki Bunko]] and began releasing his work in a [[light novel]] format beginning July 2011. The story takes place in an [[alternate history]] where magic exists and is polished through technology, and follows Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba, siblings who enroll into First High magic high school. While keeping their connections to the infamous Yotsuba clan secret, they attempt to live their daily life in peace where Tatsuya is shunned for his apparent ineptness and Miyuki is validated for her magical abilities.\n\nIn 2013, each [[story arc]] received a [[manga]] adaptation with varying [[manga artist]]s and publishers. That same year, an [[anime]] adaptation by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] was announced and was broadcast between April and September 2014. ''The Irregular at Magic High School'' franchise had been localized for English by two companies: The light novels and one of the manga adaptations are licensed by [[Yen Press]] while [[Aniplex of America]] licensed the anime series. The anime series was [[simulcast]]ed on four networks, and was later made available on [[Netflix]]. An [[The Irregular at Magic High School The Movie: The Girl Who Calls the Stars|anime film]] featuring an original story by Sat\u014d premiered in Japan on June 17, 2017, while a second season taking place after the anime series by [[Eight Bit (studio)|Eight Bit]] is scheduled to premiere in October 2020.\n\nThe series has been well received. The light novels appeared on Sugoi Japan's 2015 polls and since 2011, is one of the top selling series in Japan with 10 million copies sold as of 2019. In addition, its manga and anime adaptations also appeared on top selling charts. English reviewers had mixed to negative reception towards the anime adaptation. The complex technicality of magic within the series was received warmly but the exposition was criticized for being heavy, unclear, and poorly executed.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\nThe series is set in a world with an [[alternate history]], where magic exists and has been polished through modern technology. However, the ability to use magic is determined by genetics, limiting the number of magicians in existence. Following the [[World War III|Third World War]], the world's [[superpower]]s shifted to these four nations: The [[North American Union|United States of North America]] (USNA), New [[Soviet Union]], the Great Asian Alliance, and Japan. In Japan, the magic community is informally governed by the ten master clans in lieu of the government. Due to the limited number of magicians, they are treated as a commodity and are forced to enter magic related schools and professions. Nine magic high schools exist in Japan; they each specialize in different aspects of magic and are simply referred to by their numbers.\n\n===Plot===\nThe story follows Tatsuya Shiba, a bodyguard to his sister Miyuki Shiba who is also a candidate to succeed the leadership of the Yotsuba clan, one of the Ten Master Clans that govern Japan's magicians. They enroll into First High School which segregates its students based on their magical abilities. Miyuki is enrolled as a first course student and is viewed as one of the best students, while Tatsuya is in the second course and considered to be magically inept. However, Tatsuya's technical knowledge, combat abilities, and unique magic techniques cause people to view him as an irregular to the school's standardized rankings.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n;{{Nihongo4|{{vanchor|Tatsuya Shiba}}|\u53f8\u6ce2 \u9054\u4e5f|Shiba Tatsuya}} and {{Nihongo4|{{vanchor|Miyuki Shiba}}|\u53f8\u6ce2 \u6df1\u96ea|Shiba Miyuki}}\nTatsuya and Miyuki are siblings of the same school year and children to Tatsurou Shiba and the late Miya Yotsuba;{{Ref|LN|LN 3.2}} their parents had a loveless [[forced marriage]], and when their mother died, their father married his mistress, Sayuri Furuha, leaving the siblings to live by themselves.{{Ref|LN|LN 6.2}} Maya Yotsuba, their aunt and the current leader of the Yotsuba Clan, was the reason Tatsuya was born with the unique magic to decompose, reconstruct, and detonate matter.{{Ref|LN|LN 16.6}} Out of fear of his powers, the Yotsuba Clan leadership of that time argued for Tatsuya's death, forcing Miya and Maya to take measures to ensure his survival: the first was Miyuki's creation who would act as a seal to Tatsuya's power; the second was to magically dull Tatsuya's emotions except for his familial love towards Miyuki; and the third was to assign Tatsuya to be Miyuki's bodyguard in order to develop his sense of loyalty towards her.{{Ref|LN|LN 16.6}} During a family vacation in Okinawa, Tatsuya warded off an invasion by the Great Asian Alliance and joined the 101 Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion which is headed by [[Major]] Kazama Harunobu.{{Ref|LN|LN 8.7}} At some point during his life Tatsuya developed an interest in engineering magical technology and commercialized revolutionary technology through his family's company, Four Leaves Technology, under the pseudonymous identity Taurus Silver.{{Ref|LN|LN 3.2}} He is voiced by [[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Yuichi Nakamura]].<ref name=\"Staff and Cast\">{{cite web| url=http://mahouka.us/staff/| title=Staff and Cast| publisher=Mahouka.Us| accessdate=October 2, 2015| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929154100/http://mahouka.us/staff/| archivedate=September 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMiyuki is considered one of the strongest magicians in the world and is a candidate to succeed her Aunt Maya as the leader of the Yotsuba Clan.

{"title_page": "Republican repression in Madrid (1936\u20131939)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n'''Republican repression in Madrid of 1936\u20131939''' was a series of measures applied against presumed enemies of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Repressive actions were organised by state services, by party militias and by hybrid structures. Some activities were carried out as part of legal procedures and might have involved various judiciary; some remained on the verge of legal framework or clearly beyond it. Legally sanctioned repressive actions included execution, expropriation, fine, dismissal, jail, relocation, forced labor or being stripped of civil rights; extrajudicial violence included execution, rape, mutilation, torture, humiliation, incarceration, destruction or takeover of property. The climax of repressions took place in 1936, though they continued also during the following years. Their total scale remains unclear; fragmentary figures indicate that one institution detained at least 18,000 people in 1936. The number of the executed is disputed; two personal lists produced contain around 9,000 and around 11,500 names. Historians do not agree on most issues related to the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] repressions, including the ones of [[Madrid]] in 1936-1939.\n\n==Organization framework==\n[[File:\u041a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u043e\u0432 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044b 5 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0438\u0434 \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0442.1936.JPG|thumb|left|[[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] unit, Madrid 1936]]\nAt the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War there were three policing formations operational in Madrid, all reporting to Minister of Interior: [[Guardia Civil]], [[Guardia de Asalto]] and the police. Guardia Civil was initially targeted for major purge and reform,<ref>Gerald Blaney Jr., ''La historiograf\u00eda sobre la Guardia Civil. Cr\u00edtica y propuestas de investigaci\u00f3n'', [in:] ''Politica y sociedad'' 42/3 (2005), pp. 31\u201344</ref> but in late August 1936 it was declared to be dissolved and replaced by a new service, [[:es:Guardia Nacional Republicana|Guardia Nacional Republicana]] (GNR). Recruitment to GNR commenced soon, yet the Guard did not play major role in implementation of repressive measures; starting late 1936 it was already marked for merger into a new general public order formation.<ref>Julius Ruiz, ''The \u2018Red Terror\u2019 and the Spanish Civil War. Revolutionary violence in Madrid'', Cambridge 2014, {{ISBN|9781107054547}}, pp. 86\u201387</ref> Guardia de Asalto continued to operate, yet its Madrid units were deployed on the front against the rebels and were scarcely involved in the city. The police, and especially its investigative branch [[:es:Cuerpo de Vigilancia|Cuerpo de Investigaci\u00f3n y Vigilancia]] (CIV), from the onset underwent major change. Supervised by [[:es:Direcci\u00f3n General de Seguridad|Direcci\u00f3n General de Seguridad]] (DSG), a security office within the Ministry of Interior, the change consisted of massive purges on one hand and massive new recruitment on the other.<ref>following 1936 purges the CIV was only in 26% composed of former policemen; 30% were industry workers and 24% service workers, Ruiz 2014, p. 90</ref> Staffed with new militant members coming from revolutionary parties, some CIV units like Brigada Atadell, Brigada de Amanacer or Los Linces de la Rep\u00fablica became instrumental in implementing the Republican order.<ref>Ruiz 2014, pp. 92\u201398</ref>\n\nOutbreak of hostilities and especially the decision to hand weapons to civilians, mostly party and trade union members, produced rapid emergence of armed militias, usually though not always affiliated to political organizations.<ref>Sara Izquierdo Alvarez, ''Las checas del Madrid Republicano: un ejemplo de investigaci\u00f3n interdisciplinar'', [in:] ''Aportes' 79 (2012), p. 79</ref> During first months of the war they by far eclipsed state formations in terms of shaping the public order ambience in Madrid, yet due to their makeshift organization, ephemeral nature and improvised modus operandi this vast force evades systematic structural description. These groups are best known because of detention and interrogation posts operated, commonly known as [[:es:Checa (Espa\u00f1a)|checas]];<ref>the name was then applied to all detention posts, also these operated by state police</ref> their number is currently calculated at around 350,<ref>there were 276 checas in the very city and 64 in its immediate vicinity, Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, pp. 82, 86</ref> some 4 per every square kilometer and one per every 3,000 people;<ref>Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 85</ref> the majority disappeared by early 1937.<ref>Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, pp. 79\u201380. Most of the checas were abandoned in November, when the Nationalist troops were approaching the city, Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 88</ref> Though there are rare accounts of conflict between militias and official public order units,<ref>see e.g. there is an account of a police detachment preventing execution of religious from raided convent, Ruiz 2014, p. 71</ref> in general the latter avoided challenging the former. Both developed sort of operational symbiosis, e.g. militias used official police records to identify and locate suspects, at times handed over detainees to DSG or \u2013 far more frequently \u2013 took them over from prisons, arrests or police stations. It is suspected that on exception basis frontline military units might have also participated in action against presumed anti-Republican conspiracy.<ref>this is the case of 36. Brigada Mixta, believed to be involved in a scam known as T\u00fanel de Usera in October 1937</ref>\n\nIn August 1936 the DSG in agreement with major parties decided to set up a new body, Comit\u00e9 Provincial de Investigaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica (CPIP).<ref>Fernando Jim\u00e9nez Herrera, ''El Comit\u00e9 Provincial de Investigaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica a trav\u00e9s de la documentaci\u00f3n custoriada en el archivo general militar de Madrid,'' [in:] ''Hispania Nova'' 12 (2014), p. 5 [sequential page, there is no original pagination]</ref> A paid policing service<ref>Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, p.8</ref> managed by a board consisting of party delegates,<ref>Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, p. 5. Detailed social analysis of members of public order structures is not available. In case of CPIP all were males, mostly between 25 and 45 years. Usually they were former service employees with many industry men as well; there were also single writers, periodistas, teachers, or painters, Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, p. 28</ref> CPIP was to thwart anti-Republican plots and to arrest individuals involved. In theory they were to be passed to DSG for further investigation; in practice CPIP's internal filtering body, set up to process detainees, was entitled to administer executions.<ref>Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, p. 17, Ruiz 2014, pp. 263-266. It is not clear whether CPIP and its filtering bodies, named \"tribunales\",\n should be considered part of the police system or part of the judiciary. CPIP was set up by Ministry of Interior and was subordinate to its office DSG, not to Ministry of Justice</ref> During some 100 days of its existence CPIP was the key law-enforcement agency before a dissolution decree was issued early November 1936,<ref>Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, p.18</ref> though few units continued to operate some time afterwards.<ref>Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, pp. 23-25</ref> Another new body, by far less important, was Inspecci\u00f3n General de Milicias (IGM).<ref>at one point there were 1,004 men employed in IGM, Ruiz 2014, p. 101</ref> Created also in August 1936 it was an army branch, supposed to co-ordinate logistics and financing of party militias, though it operated also its own Secci\u00f3n de Investigaci\u00f3n; IGM was dissolved in November 1936.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 101</ref> In September 1936 Ministry of Interior set up its own unit designed to co-ordinate militia activities, Milicias de Vigilancia de la Retaguardia (MVR), a hybrid between state policing force and party militias; initially scarcely active, later MVR recruited men from dissolved CPIP<ref>exact reason for dissolution of CPIP is not clear and all related theories are speculative, Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, p. 10</ref> and gained momentum; some of its sections became very active before MVR, including the militia units still operational, was dissolved in December 1936.<ref>at one point there were 1,378 men registered in MVR, Ruiz 2014, pp. 180-182, 268</ref>\n[[File:\u041a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u043e\u0432 \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0420\u043e\u0442 \u0444\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442 \u0422\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e 14 09 1936.JPG|thumb|[[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] supporters from Madrid demonstrating their political preferences, 1936]]\nIn December 1936 it was made public that all policing formations - Guardia de Asalto, GNR, CIV, MVR, IGM \u2013 would merge in a new service, Cuerpo de Seguridad (CS). Of its two branches, Grupo Uniformado and Grupo Civil, the latter included Secci\u00f3n de Investigaciones Especiales; this plain clothes investigation service became the backbone of policing structures managed by the Ministry of Interior.<ref>Ruiz 2014, pp. 294-295</ref> However, the same minister in June 1937 carved out from DSG a unit named [[:es:Departamento Especial de Informaci\u00f3n del Estado|Departamento Especial de Informaci\u00f3n de Estado]] (DEDIDE), basically a [[counter-intelligence]] agency, which also in Madrid ran its own network of operatives and premises.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 321</ref> Two months later, in August 1937, the Ministry of War declared setting up a new organization, supposed to gather all espionage, counter-espionage and information activities: [[Servicio de Investigaci\u00f3n Militar]] (SIM).<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 298</ref> From that moment onwards SIM became the key state instrument in fighting presumed conspiracy. In March 1938 it incorporated the dissolved DEDIDE.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 322</ref> The army intelligence units like Section Two of the General Staff, later known as Servicio de Informaci\u00f3n del Estado Mayor (SIEM), continued to operate independently,<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 285</ref> yet except late 1936/early 1937, when military counter-espionage Special Services remained fairly active, they did not contribute to public order system in Madrid.<ref>for organigram see Javier Cervera, ''Madrid en guerra'', Madrid 1998, {{ISBN|9788420629087}}, p. 428</ref>\n\n==Modus operandi==\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043b\u044c \u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432.JPG|thumb|160px|left|patrol, Madrid 1936]]\nUnits forming the Republican realm of public order relied on various methods when in their pursuit of suspects.<ref>brief discussion of modus operandi in Cervera 1998, pp. 60-68; discussion of who could have been considered a suspect Cervera 1998, pp. 130-148</ref> The most popular one was response to tips and denunciations, either from individuals co-operating with the security \u2013 most prominently porters of the [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores|UGT]] union of porters \u2013 or madrile\u00f1os who were not related to the policing network. Another method was systematic search, usually based on files held by pre-war offices like police departments, or papers obtained from raiding premises of right-wing parties or institutions.<ref>Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 79</ref> One more method was street vigilance and monitoring, e.g. this related to key objects or [[black market]]. Finally, certain units specialized in setting up traps, like the false embassy of [[Siam]] or the so-called T\u00fanel de Usera.<ref>process flow graph with organigram in Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 89, see also annexes in Ruiz 2014</ref>\n\nSome individuals apprehended<ref>most (79.8%) were apprehended in late evening, Javier Cervera Gil, ''Violencia en el Madrid de la Guerra Civil: los \u2018paseos\u2019 (julio a diciembre de 1936)'', [in:] ''Studia Historica Contemporanea'' 13-14 (1995-1996), p. 76</ref> were executed on the spot or shortly afterwards, at times maltreated before death.<ref>bodies were at times found with various types of injuries, see e.g. Ruiz 2014, p. 79</ref> Many of them, however, ended up in some sort of incarceration; it might have been in official prison compounds, in arrests on police stations or in detention centers operated by various groups, usually in former convents or other suitable large buildings.<ref>Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 85</ref> It seems that incarceration usually lasted no longer than few months, though there were cases of much longer detention.<ref>e.g. an individual arrested in July 1936 was kept behind bars until June 1937, when he finally faced the tribunal, Ruiz 2014, p. 59.

There were cases of popular tribunals engaging into detailed examination; a man charged with sniping in October 1936 and trialed in mid-1937 was acquitted following opinion of experts, who inspected the place of alleged crime and found that it physically not possible for the man to have engaged in sniping, Ruiz 2014, p. 59</ref> There is only partial statistics of verdicts adopted;<ref>for an attempt of the summary see Cervera Gil 2015, pp. 223\u2013231</ref> it seems that around 50% of defendants were absolved<ref>Cervera 1998, pp. 153\u2013155; 53% of workers and 44% of middle-class defendants were acquitted, Cervera 1998, p. 152</ref> and that some 8% were sentenced to capital punishment.<ref>45 death sentences of out 566 cases produced by one tribunal, Santos Juli\u00e1 D\u00edaz (ed.), ''Victimas de la guerra civil'', Madrid 1999, {{ISBN|9788484603337}}, p. 164</ref> Perhaps the best known case of Madrid execution following trial and death sentence is this of [[:es:Joaqu\u00edn Fanjul|Joaqu\u00edn Fanjul]].\n[[File:\u041a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u043e\u0432 \u0427\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 1936.JPG|thumb|Republican forces on guard]]\nExecutions might have taken place during or shortly after the apprehension, during incarceration in prison/detention center, or at one of execution sites, the latter either following less or more formal admin/juridical decision or resulting from action unsanctioned even by a dubious procedure.<ref>vast majority of the killings took place in the early morning hours, Cervera 1995-1996, p. 76</ref> There is no systematic data allowing quantitative estimates, yet it is believed that the number of on-the-spot executions was highest during initial months of the war and it decreased rapidly afterwards.<ref>Cervera 1995-1996, p. 76</ref> The best-known form of killings were so-called paseos<ref>detailed discussion in Javier Cervera, ''Madrid en guerra'', Madrid 1998, {{ISBN|9788478809837}}, pp. 68-71</ref> and sacas.<ref>Cervera 1998, pp. 84\u2013102</ref> The former usually stands for small-scale unofficial executions, while the latter typically denotes larger extractions of inmates from detention sites, often substantiated by some form of formal decision.

All estimates focus on the executed but do not advance figures related to other categories of the repressed, be it those related to legal proceedings \u2013 expropriated, fined, dismissed, jailed, relocated, condemned to forced labor, stripped of civil rights \u2013 or those related to extrajudicial violence, like those raped, mutilated, beaten, tortured, humiliated, detained or those who found their property vandalized, stolen, burnt or otherwise destroyed. One study suggests that the number of CPIP detainees only might have been 18,000.<ref>Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, p. 12</ref> Initially the number of executed was counted in tens of thousands, e.g. in early 1937 ''[[The Guardian]]'' coined the figure of 40,000.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 3</ref> The Francoist ''Dictamen'', released in 1939, opted for 60,000, though confidentially the numbers were soon reduced to 18,000.<ref>Ruiz 2014, pp. 3-4</ref> Until the end of [[Francoism]] it was impossible to verify these claims; archival research of the late 20th century produced two lists of identified victims, one totaling 8,815<ref>Rafael Casas de la Vega, ''El Terror.

Existing sets of more thorough data refer to specific processes and it is not clear how representative they are; this is e.g. the case of files produced by popular tribunals. Some scholars tend to accept them as indicative of general social composition of all the repressed,<ref>see the analysis in Cervera 1998</ref> though e.g. in case of sex there are significant discrepancies noted.<ref>Popular tribunal data indicate that females formed 26% of the defendants (Cervera 1998, p. 171), while on lists of those killed during paseos the females make up 7% (Ruiz 2014, p. 4). The discrepancy gives rise to a hypothesis that detained women were more likely than men to evade execution and enjoyed far greater chance to be delivered for orderly trial, which in turn might render the tribunal data scarcely representative.</ref> According to the tribunal files most of the defendants were empleados, a wide and ambiguous category generally pointing to white-collar hired employees; among other top categories housewives form 14%, military 12% and students 8%; industry workers make up 6%.<ref>Cervera 1998, p. 151</ref> In terms of age the prevailing category are these between 26 and 30 (17%),<ref>followed by these aged 20\u201325 (15%), 31\u201335 (13%) and 36\u201340 (13%), Cervera 1998, p. 167</ref> 52% of the defendants were singles and 41% were married.<ref>Cervera 1998, p. 169</ref> In terms of their political preferences the overwhelming majority belonged to two parties, [[Acci\u00f3n Popular (Spain)|Acci\u00f3n Popular]] (40%) and [[Falange Espa\u00f1ola de las JONS|Falange]] (38%).<ref>some 10% were recorded as supporters of [[Renovaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola]], Cervera 1998, pp. 193\u2013166</ref> According to claims based on oral accounts there were two social groups which stood out as key targets of repression: the military and the religious, both approached as uniformed arms and propaganda departments of the same enemy. These claims are not substantiated by the tribunal data, which indicates that 57% of the military defendants were acquitted;<ref>Cervera 1998, p. 154</ref> in case of the religious the figure was 75%.<ref>Cervera 1998, p. 155</ref> Relatively high percentage of acquittals suggests that the tribunals made some effort to investigate the cases and did not default to death sentences. It also suggests that at least 50% of individuals detained and later appearing in court were not engaged in any conspiracy. How many detainees executed before facing trial were engaged in anti-Republican activities is impossible to tell,<ref>counter-espionage services kept claiming successes when fighting conspiracy, e.g. in May 1937 \"San Francisco El Grande\" network was broken up, later that year \"Golfin-Corujo organisation\" was unearthed, and in April 1938 members of \"163 Conspiracy\" were apprehended, Ruiz 2014, pp. 286\u2013293. Given all documentation related is produced by security forces telling to what extent charges were made up is impossible</ref> especially that the term was applied very flexibly.<ref>e.g. paperclips with obituary of Calvo Sotelo might have been considered subversive materials, Ruiz 2014, pp. 248\u20139</ref> Membership in foreign diplomatic corps did not save from arrest or execution.<ref>a Belgian diplomat Jacques Borchgrave was detained and shot in December 1936. A diplomatic scandal ensued; it was settled a year later, when the Republican government paid 1m francs of indemnity and the Belgians agreed to recognize that no government agent was involved, Ruiz 2014, p. 285. Not all cases ended up with compromise; following a similar case, Uruguay broke diplomatic relations with Spain</ref>\n[[File:Monch\u00edn Triana.jpg|thumb|160px|[[:es:Monch\u00edn Triana|\"Monch\u00edn\" Triana]]]]\nMany nationally known personalities fell victim to the Madrid repression.

Also sport personalities might have been subject to repression, as demonstrated by cases of [[Ricardo Zamora|Ricardo Zamora Mart\u00ednez]] (who escaped death), [[:es:Monch\u00edn Triana|Ramon Triana Arroyo]] and [[:es:Hernando Fitz-James Stuart y Falc\u00f3|Hernando Fitz-James Stuart]].\n\n==Time and geography==\n[[File:C\u00edrculo de Bellas Artes - 01.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Checa de Bellas Artes]]\nThere is no study that suggests even approximate quantitative estimates of the scale of Madrid repression year by year. However, almost all studies suggest that most violence took place in 1936. One historian claims that 96% of executions took place in 1936;<ref>Cervera 1995-1996, p. 76</ref> some challenge or reject the methodology altogether, others tend to accept the figures.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 4</ref> An analysis of paseos only, the study based on files stored in the Madrid Audiencia Territorial, indicates that 97,6% of these killings took place before 1937,<ref>Cervera 1995-1996, p. 76</ref> though documentation stored might also reflect changing procedural and filing patterns within the security forces. Detailed analysis of existing evidence of small-scale executions suggests that they climaxed in July (400),<ref>372 bodies were collected for burial at the Cementerio del Este, Ruiz 2014, p. 70</ref> August (650) and September (550), with smaller figures for October and November (around 300 each) and still lower in December (below 100).<ref>Cervera 1996-1996, p. 77, also Cervera 1998, especially graphs on pp. 73\u201379</ref> However, it should by no means be assumed that the overall number of victims decreased throughout 1936; the Paracuellos executions, carried out in late November and early December, took the toll of at least 2,000 victims with few estimates pointing to around 4,000. There is no doubt that the scale of the killings was much smaller throughout 1937, 1938 and 1939, especially that since the spring of 1937 the Minister of Justice [[Juan Garc\u00eda Oliver|Garcia Olivier]] strove to set up a wide network of forced labor camps and advanced the thesis that rather than be punished by death for their crimes, the enemies of the Republic should redeem their deeds by hard work.<ref>Cervera 2015, pp. 214\u2013215</ref> However, also after then executions continued and at times climaxed in large-scale waves of killings; in November 1937 at least 67 individuals were executed in a scam known as T\u00fanel de Usera, while in March 1939 SIM cracked down on unspecified number of Communists, with many of them killed.\n\nGeographical analysis of repression system in the Republican Madrid does not demonstrate any specific pattern as to location of Madrid detention centers. With 4 checas per square kilometer on average, they were covering the city with dense and rather regular network;<ref>detailed analysis Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 86, Cervera 1998, pp. 64\u201365</ref> even at that time suburban borough of [[Puente de Vallecas]] hosted 17 such places.<ref>see e.g. a map published in ''La Raz\u00f3n'', available [http://www.larazon.es/documents/10165/0/video_content_5602772_20161030003713.pdf here]</ref> Among 5 checas with the largest number of victims recorded, Checa San Bernardo, Checa Lista and Checa Santa Engracia were located in the very centre, while Checa del Ateneo and Checa del Circulo somewhat more outside.<ref>out of some 100 barrios of Madrid there were 20 with no checas, Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 87</ref> Headquarters of CPIP, perhaps the most prominent institution of Republican repression system,<ref>the number of deaths administered or otherwise effectuated by CPIP is estimated between 2,400 and 7,200, Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, p. 18</ref> was centrally located first at [[Calle de Alcala]] and then at Calle de Fomento; premises of DGS and its agendas were scattered around the [[Salamanca (Madrid)|Salamanca district]], usually at or near [[:es:Calle de Serrano|Calle de Serrano]]. Until mid-1937 most detentions were carried out in the districts of [[Chamberi (Madrid)|Chamberi]] and [[Buenavista (Madrid)|Buenavista]]; later these areas ceased to stand out.<ref>Cervera 1998. pp. 161\u2013162</ref>\n[[File:Madrile\u00f1os en el Parque de San Isidro.JPG|thumb|[[:es:Parque dec San Isidro|Pradera de San Isidro]] today]]\nGeographical location of execution sites changed over time.<ref>details Cervera 1995-1996</ref> During the first months of the conflict the inmates were taken usually to the Western districts of Madrid or to its Western suburbs, especially to [[Aravaca]] in the North, large green areas of [[Casa de Campo]] in the centre and to the park known as [[:es:Parque dec San Isidro|Pradera de San Isidro]] in the South.<ref>Cervera 1995-1996, p. 81</ref> It is supposed that these sparsely populated and partially rural areas were deemed more suitable for executions than more densely inhabited Eastern and Northern peripheries of the capital. However, as the Nationalist troops approached from the West, Aravaca or Casa del Campo found themselves dangerously close to the frontline and soon became the battlefield themselves, which prompted re-orientation of executions. Since October they were taking place in the East and in the South, especially in [[Rivas-Vaciamadrid]], along Carretera de Andalusia and near [[Cementerio de la Almudena|Cimiterio del Este]].<ref>Cervera 1995-1996, pp. 80\u201381</ref> Paracuellos de Jarama was chosen as site of the largest executions because it remained away from the frontline, because there was an easy road access from Madrid, and because local [[ayuntamiento]]s were considered politically reliable, ready to organize the locals for work related to burying the bodies.<ref>Ruiz 2014, pp. 230 and onwards</ref>\n\n==Protagonists==\n[[File:\u00c1ngel Galarza.png|thumb|160px|left|[[:es:\u00c1ngel Galarza|\u00c1ngel Galarza]]]]\nDuring the first few weeks of the war the person responsible for public order in Republican Spain was [[Sebasti\u00e1n Pozas Perea]], the Minister of Interior; scarcely involved in local Madrid issues, he nevertheless demonstrated complacency towards the revolutionary groupings.<ref>as example of Pozas' yielding position versus the militias some historians quote his stand in case of the so-called Jaen trains, Ruiz 2014, pp. 154\u2013156</ref> His second in command, the DSG head [[:es:Jos\u00e9 Alonso Mallo|Jos\u00e9 Alonso Mallo]]l, tried to preserve integrity of state structures yet overwhelmed by events, he resigned on July 31, 1936. His replacement was [[:es:Manuel Mu\u00f1oz Mart\u00ednez|Manuel Mu\u00f1oz Mart\u00ednez]],<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 372</ref> who since early September reported already to the new minister, [[:es:\u00c1ngel Galarza|Angel Galarza Gago]]. The two remained key public order officials in Madrid until early November 1936, when they left the capital. From this moment onwards both Galarza and Mu\u00f1oz, but also their successors at ministry and DSG retained less influence over state public order structures in Madrid. Their role was about initiating and overseeing some structural changes, yet implementation and local public order policy remained largely in hands of [[Junta de Defensa de Madrid]] (JDM) and later other local bodies.\n\nJDM was set up in early November 1936; its branch responsible for public order, Consejeria de Orden P\u00fablico, was assumed by [[Santiago Carrillo Solares|Santiago Carillo Solares]] and his deputy [[Jos\u00e9 Cazorla Maure|Jos\u00e9 Cazorla Maur\u00e9.]] When a month later Carillo left Madrid, it was Cazorla who became the most potent man in security forces of the capital, the post held almost until the dissolution of JDM in April 1937.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 369</ref> For a few months various individuals competed for power, like e.g. David V\u00e1zquez Baldominos, Cazorla's nominee as inspector general of Madrid police. In the summer of 1937 [[Gustavo Dur\u00e1n|Gustavo Dur\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez]] was appointed head of the Madrid SIM. His tenure lasted few months; in October 1937 he was replaced by [[:es:\u00c1ngel Pedrero Garc\u00eda|\u00c1ngel Pedrero Garc\u00eda]], former deputy head of the Atadell Brigade and a personal [[Indalecio Prieto|Prieto's]] trustee.<ref>Julius Ruiz, ''Defending the Republic: The Garc\u00eda Atadell Brigade in Madrid, 1936'', [in:] ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 42 (2007), pp. 114-115</ref> Pedrero was the most important man in Madrid policing structures for 17 months; during the Casado coup in March 1939 he greatly assisted the rebels by leading SIM to arrest a number of Communist personalities in Madrid.<ref>Ruiz 2007, p. 115</ref> He left the capital in late March; at that time the key man behind forces of order was [[:es:Vicente Girauta Linares|Vicente Girauta Li\u00f1ares]], since mid-1938 Comisario General de Seguridad in the province.<ref>''BOE'' 18.08.1937, available [https://www.boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1938/230/B00812-00812.pdf here], Ruiz 2014, p. 88</ref>\n\nSome individuals rather briefly commanded important public order structures. This was the case of [[Segundo Serrano Poncela]]; he headed the DSG Security Council only few weeks, just in time to issue orders to extract prisoners who ended up at Paracuellos.<ref>Ruiz 2014, pp. 239\u2013240</ref> Federico Manzano Govantes first directed MVR and effectively managed the militias manning the Paracuellos extractions; later he moved to SIM.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 243</ref> Ram\u00f3n Rasc\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez headed CPIP personal section, sat in DGS council and led its prison department, headed commissions selecting inmates for Paracuellos and left for the front in 1937.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 373</ref> Manuel Salgado Moreira vigorously commanded military counter-intelligence at the turn of 1936 and 1937 and organized some spectacular scams, like the false Siam embassy. Julio de Mora Martinez since 1938 supervised the SIM labor camp structure in the province.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 322</ref> Benigno Mancebo Mart\u00edn served as secretary of CPIP and then was member of provincial board which reconstructed new security forces, apart from leading a unit himself.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 371</ref> [[Melchor Rodr\u00edguez Garc\u00eda]] was briefly Delegado General de Prisiones and with limited success tried to stop the Paracuellos extractions.<ref>he secured the post of Prisons Director specifically to stop the killings and at this post he was successful until dismissed by Garcia Oliver. After few days he managed to secure his re-appointment. It is not clear whether he managed to stop the Paracuellos killings again, compare Ruiz 2014, p. 283, or whether the extractions were stopped anyway, as due to international uproar they were no longer \"plausibly deniable\", Ruiz 2014, p. 236</ref>\n[[File:Santiago Carrillo par Claude Truong-Ngoc 1979.jpg|thumb|[[Santiago Carrillo]]]]\nThere are individuals who did not hold top positions in power structures yet made themselves known as particularly efficient when implementing new order.

Mallol and Mu\u00f1oz were former [[Radical Socialist Republican Party|Republican Radical-Socialists]] and both joined [[Izquierda Republicana]] in the mid-1930s; also Galarza was former PRRSI militant, but unlike his colleagues he preferred to move to [[PSOE]] and as a Socialist and [[Largo Caballero|Largo Caballero's]] nominee he landed the job of Minister of Interior.

Its creation acknowledged actual new balance of power, certified by mushrooming party and trade union militias. Attempts to gauge the share of political influences among these units are based on presumed affiliations of checas, operating in Madrid, yet this yardstick is inconclusive. Analysis of some 300 points broadly classified as checas seems to suggest that the Anarchist [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]-[[Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica|FAI]] and the Communist [[Partido Comunista de Espana|PCE]] controlled some 25% of them each, with the rest distributed among PSOE, [[Unified Socialist Youth|JSU]], various Republican groupings and politically ambiguous units like [[:es:Un\u00edos Hermanos Proletarios|UHT]].<ref>see map in ''La Raz\u00f3n'', published [http://www.larazon.es/documents/10165/0/video_content_5602772_20161030003713.pdf here]</ref> Analysis of some 70 larger detention centers reveals a 34% domination of CNT-FAI, with PCE behind 19%, PSOE 13% and JSU behind 6% of the units.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 90</ref>\n\nThe CPIP itself was theoretically controlled by a 30-member board divided equally among a number of parties,<ref>Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional de Trabajadores (CNT), Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica (FAI), Federaci\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rica de Juventudes Libertarias (FIJL), Partido Sindicalista (PS), Partido Socialista Obrero Espa\u00f1ol (PSOE), Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores (UGT), Partido Comunista Espa\u00f1ol (PCE), Juventudes Socialistas Unificadas (JSU) Izquierda Republicana (IR) and Uni\u00f3n Republicana (UR), Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, p. 10</ref> yet its investigative squads reflected clear Anarchist domination: 40% were related to CNT-FAI, 19% to PSOE and 19% to PCE.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 102</ref> The end of \"bourgeoisie policing\" was marked also by transformation of CIV, the state plain clothes police; this formation was overtaken by the Socialists, as 31% of new recruits were from UGT, 17% from PSOE, 15% from IR, 5% from PCE and mere 3% - perhaps unsurprisingly, given the Anarchist position versus state structures in general and police in particular \u2013 from CNT-FAI.<ref>Ruiz 2014, pp. 90\u201391</ref> IGM, a body marginally involved in security system, was also in 64% dominated by PSOE with marginal Anarchist presence.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 101</ref> Definitely more important MVR was similarly the socialist fiefdom; its director Manzano was a PSOE man at the time<ref>later he changed colors and joined the Communists, Ruiz 2014, p. 243</ref> and 59% of militiamen registered were members of UGT; however, PCE affiliations marked 17% of those recorded and membership in Communist-dominated JSU was indicated by 14%.<ref>Ruiz 2014, pp. 180\u2013182</ref>\n\nPolitical control of state security structures in Madrid turned a corner with the government leaving the capital. Within JDM the public order department was seized by the Communists as reflected by appointments of Carillo and Cazorla,<ref>new Consejo de la Direcci\u00f3n General de Seguridad, presided by Poncela, was composed mostly of members of PCU and JSU, Ruiz 2014, pp. 293\u2013240</ref> especially that PSOE-dominated CPIP and IGM were soon disbanded, while MVR followed suit some time afterwards. However, late 1936 and early 1937 are marked by mounting conflict between the Anarchists and the Communists, which following a shootout<ref>in what looked like an accidental night control getting got out of hand anarchist militiamen wounded [[Pablo Yague]], a PCE member and head of JDM Supply Department. Cazorla and PCE demanded dissolution of military counter-intelligence brigades controlled by CNT and exemplary punishment for the culprits; however, the Anarchists opposed these demands and the militiamen were eventually released, Ruiz 2014, p. 289</ref> and a cabinet war in the government led to dissolution of JDM; nevertheless, the Communists at least for some time retained control over some CIV brigades and used some in their campaigns, as suggested by Valenti's role in the fate of [[Andreu Nin|Nin]].<ref>Ruiz 2014, pp. 289\u2013292</ref> The Anarchists retained a grade of control over military counter-intelligence, supervised by Salgado and Val.

This shaky modus vivendi was demolished during the [[National Defence Council (Spain)|Casado coup]] in March 1939, when PSOE-led SIM and Anarchist-led military units crushed the Communist resistance. The showdown left some of PCE personalities executed, like it was the case of former IGM head [[Luis Barcel\u00f3|Barcel\u00f3]], and some imprisoned, like it was the case of former DSG Security Council head Cazorla. The last person who might be considered the top positioned man of Republican Madrid security, Girauta, was a professional policeman-detective and can hardly be put into any political rubric.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Causa General Manises.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[:es:Causa General|Causa General]] files]]\nFew protagonists of the Madrid policing units were captured by the Nationalists in course of the war; it was the case of Atadell, who in November 1936 was intercepted in [[Canary Islands]] when the French [[cruise liner]] he had boarded in [[St. Nazaire]] was about to set off for [[Cuba]].<ref>Ruiz 2007, pp. 111-113</ref> Some high officials who no longer held their posts \u2013 Galarza, Mu\u00f1oz, Carillo, Serrano Poncela, and Pozas \u2013 crossed the French border in [[Catalonia]] in early 1939. Most of these still involved left Madrid during final weeks of the war and headed for the [[Levante, Spain|Levantine]] coast, but few managed to leave Spain; Val secured a seat in an aircraft, while Duran and Salgado boarded a British warship. The rest found themselves trapped on the quays of [[Alicante]] in vain waiting for a ship to get them out. Many \u2013 like Girauta, Manzano, de Mora, Pedrero, Sandoval and Valenti \u2013 were apprehended there and identified already in April 1939. Some managed to slip through the Nationalist security net and tried to start a new life assuming a false identity. However, the Francoist hunters were determined in their pursuit; Mancebo and Cazorla<ref>Cazorla was arrested by the Casadistas when holding the post of civil governor of Guadalajara.

Indeed, authorities launched a massive campaign; it was intended to present the Republican rule in Madrid as period of savage barbarity and to honor its victims. Apart from frequent press notes, there were tens of documentary, para-documentary or historical books on what was dubbed \"red terror\" published every year, and Madrid featured prominently in most of them; it is estimated that some 450 related works were released until 1975, though mostly during the first two decades of Francoism.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Luis Ledesma, ''El 1936 m\u00e1s opaco: las violencias en la zona republicana durante la guerra civil y sus narrativas'', [in:] ''Historia Social'' 58 (2007), p. 153</ref> Republican system of public order was depicted in culture, presented as horrific machine of murder in numerous novels and in some films.<ref>not all films were unambigious in their presentation of the Republicans, compare ''Yo am\u00e9 a un rojo.

Repressive actions were organised by state services, by party militias and by hybrid structures. Some activities were carried out as part of legal procedures and might have involved various judiciary; some remained on the verge of legal framework or clearly beyond it. Legally sanctioned repressive actions included execution, expropriation, fine, dismissal, jail, relocation, forced labor or being stripped of civil rights; extrajudicial violence included execution, rape, mutilation, torture, humiliation, incarceration, destruction or takeover of property. The climax of repressions took place in 1936, though they continued also during the following years. Their total scale remains unclear; fragmentary figures indicate that one institution detained at least 18,000 people in 1936. The number of the executed is disputed; two personal lists produced contain around 9,000 and around 11,500 names. Historians do not agree on most issues related to the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] repressions, including the ones of [[Madrid]] in 1936-1939.\n\n==Organization framework==\n[[File:\u041a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u043e\u0432 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044b 5 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0438\u0434 \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0442.1936.JPG|thumb|left|[[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] unit, Madrid 1936]]\nAt the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War there were three policing formations operational in Madrid, all reporting to Minister of Interior: [[Guardia Civil]], [[Guardia de Asalto]] and the police. Guardia Civil was initially targeted for major purge and reform,<ref>Gerald Blaney Jr., ''La historiograf\u00eda sobre la Guardia Civil. Cr\u00edtica y propuestas de investigaci\u00f3n'', [in:] ''Politica y sociedad'' 42/3 (2005), pp. 31\u201344</ref> but in late August 1936 it was declared to be dissolved and replaced by a new service, [[:es:Guardia Nacional Republicana|Guardia Nacional Republicana]] (GNR). Recruitment to GNR commenced soon, yet the Guard did not play major role in implementation of repressive measures; starting late 1936 it was already marked for merger into a new general public order formation.<ref>Julius Ruiz, ''The \u2018Red Terror\u2019 and the Spanish Civil War. Revolutionary violence in Madrid'', Cambridge 2014, {{ISBN|9781107054547}}, pp. 86\u201387</ref> Guardia de Asalto continued to operate, yet its Madrid units were deployed on the front against the rebels and were scarcely involved in the city. The police, and especially its investigative branch [[:es:Cuerpo de Vigilancia|Cuerpo de Investigaci\u00f3n y Vigilancia]] (CIV), from the onset underwent major change. Supervised by [[:es:Direcci\u00f3n General de Seguridad|Direcci\u00f3n General de Seguridad]] (DSG), a security office within the Ministry of Interior, the change consisted of massive purges on one hand and massive new recruitment on the other.<ref>following 1936 purges the CIV was only in 26% composed of former policemen; 30% were industry workers and 24% service workers, Ruiz 2014, p. 90</ref> Staffed with new militant members coming from revolutionary parties, some CIV units like Brigada Atadell, Brigada de Amanacer or Los Linces de la Rep\u00fablica became instrumental in implementing the Republican order.<ref>Ruiz 2014, pp. 92\u201398</ref>\n\nOutbreak of hostilities and especially the decision to hand weapons to civilians, mostly party and trade union members, produced rapid emergence of armed militias, usually though not always affiliated to political organizations.<ref>Sara Izquierdo Alvarez, ''Las checas del Madrid Republicano: un ejemplo de investigaci\u00f3n interdisciplinar'', [in:] ''Aportes' 79 (2012), p. 79</ref> During first months of the war they by far eclipsed state formations in terms of shaping the public order ambience in Madrid, yet due to their makeshift organization, ephemeral nature and improvised modus operandi this vast force evades systematic structural description. These groups are best known because of detention and interrogation posts operated, commonly known as [[:es:Checa (Espa\u00f1a)|checas]];<ref>the name was then applied to all detention posts, also these operated by state police</ref> their number is currently calculated at around 350,<ref>there were 276 checas in the very city and 64 in its immediate vicinity, Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, pp. 82, 86</ref> some 4 per every square kilometer and one per every 3,000 people;<ref>Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 85</ref> the majority disappeared by early 1937.<ref>Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, pp. 79-80. Most of the checas were abandoned in November, when the Nationalist troops were approaching the city, Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 88</ref> Though there are rare accounts of conflict between militias and official public order units,<ref>see e.g. there is an account of a police detachment preventing execution of religious from raided convent, Ruiz 2014, p. 71</ref> in general the latter avoided challenging the former. Both developed sort of operational symbiosis, e.g. militias used official police records to identify and locate suspects, at times handed over detainees to DSG or \u2013 far more frequently \u2013 took them over from prisons, arrests or police stations. It is suspected that on exception basis frontline military units might have also participated in action against presumed anti-Republican conspiracy.<ref>this is the case of 36. Brigada Mixta, believed to be involved in a scam known as T\u00fanel de Usera in October 1937</ref>\n\nIn August 1936 the DSG in agreement with major parties decided to set up a new body, Comit\u00e9 Provincial de Investigaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica (CPIP).<ref>Fernando Jim\u00e9nez Herrera, ''El Comit\u00e9 Provincial de Investigaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica a trav\u00e9s de la documentaci\u00f3n custoriada en el archivo general militar de Madrid,'' [in:] ''Hispania Nova'' 12 (2014), p. 5 [sequential page, there is no original pagination]</ref> A paid policing service<ref>Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, p.8</ref> managed by a board consisting of party delegates,<ref>Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, p. 5. Detailed social analysis of members of public order structures is not available. In case of CPIP all were males, mostly between 25 and 45 years. Usually they were former service employees with many industry men as well; there were also single writers, periodistas, teachers, or painters, Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, p. 28</ref> CPIP was to thwart anti-Republican plots and to arrest individuals involved. In theory they were to be passed to DSG for further investigation; in practice CPIP's internal filtering body, set up to process detainees, was entitled to administer executions.<ref>Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, p. 17, Ruiz 2014, pp. 263-266. It is not clear whether CPIP and its filtering bodies, named \"tribunales\",\n should be considered part of the police system or part of the judiciary. CPIP was set up by Ministry of Interior and was subordinate to its office DSG, not to Ministry of Justice</ref> During some 100 days of its existence CPIP was the key law-enforcement agency before a dissolution decree was issued early November 1936,<ref>Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, p.18</ref> though few units continued to operate some time afterwards.<ref>Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, pp. 23-25</ref> Another new body, by far less important, was Inspecci\u00f3n General de Milicias (IGM).<ref>at one point there were 1,004 men employed in IGM, Ruiz 2014, p. 101</ref> Created also in August 1936 it was an army branch, supposed to co-ordinate logistics and financing of party militias, though it operated also its own Secci\u00f3n de Investigaci\u00f3n; IGM was dissolved in November 1936.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 101</ref> In September 1936 Ministry of Interior set up its own unit designed to co-ordinate militia activities, Milicias de Vigilancia de la Retaguardia (MVR), a hybrid between state policing force and party militias; initially scarcely active, later MVR recruited men from dissolved CPIP<ref>exact reason for dissolution of CPIP is not clear and all related theories are speculative, Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, p. 10</ref> and gained momentum; some of its sections became very active before MVR, including the militia units still operational, was dissolved in December 1936.<ref>at one point there were 1,378 men registered in MVR, Ruiz 2014, pp. 180-182, 268</ref>\n[[File:\u041a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u043e\u0432 \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0420\u043e\u0442 \u0444\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442 \u0422\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e 14 09 1936.JPG|thumb|[[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] supporters from Madrid demonstrating their political preferences, 1936]]\nIn December 1936 it was made public that all policing formations - Guardia de Asalto, GNR, CIV, MVR, IGM \u2013 would merge in a new service, Cuerpo de Seguridad (CS). Of its two branches, Grupo Uniformado and Grupo Civil, the latter included Secci\u00f3n de Investigaciones Especiales; this plain clothes investigation service became the backbone of policing structures managed by the Ministry of Interior.<ref>Ruiz 2014, pp. 294-295</ref> However, the same minister in June 1937 carved out from DSG a unit named [[:es:Departamento Especial de Informaci\u00f3n del Estado|Departamento Especial de Informaci\u00f3n de Estado]] (DEDIDE), basically a [[counter-intelligence]] agency, which also in Madrid ran its own network of operatives and premises.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 321</ref> Two months later, in August 1937, the Ministry of War declared setting up a new organization, supposed to gather all espionage, counter-espionage and information activities: [[Servicio de Investigaci\u00f3n Militar]] (SIM).<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 298</ref> From that moment onwards SIM became the key state instrument in fighting presumed conspiracy. In March 1938 it incorporated the dissolved DEDIDE.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 322</ref> The army intelligence units like Section Two of the General Staff, later known as Servicio de Informaci\u00f3n del Estado Mayor (SIEM), continued to operate independently,<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 285</ref> yet except late 1936/early 1937, when military counter-espionage Special Services remained fairly active, they did not contribute to public order system in Madrid.<ref>for organigram see Javier Cervera, ''Madrid en guerra'', Madrid 1998, {{ISBN|9788420629087}}, p. 428</ref>\n\n==Modus operandi==\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043b\u044c \u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432.JPG|thumb|160px|left|patrol, Madrid 1936]]\nUnits forming the Republican realm of public order relied on various methods when in their pursuit of suspects.<ref>brief discussion of modus operandi in Cervera 1998, pp. 60-68; discussion of who could have been considfered a suspect Cervera 1998, pp. 130-148</ref> The most popular one was response to tips and denunciations, either from individuals co-operating with the security \u2013 most prominently porters of the [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores|UGT]] union of porters \u2013 or madrile\u00f1os who were not related to the policing network. Another method was systematic search, usually based on files held by pre-war offices like police departments, or papers obtained from raiding premises of right-wing parties or institutions.<ref>Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 79</ref> One more method was street vigilance and monitoring, e.g. this related to key objects or [[black market]].

All estimates focus on the executed but do not advance figures related to other categories of the repressed, be it those related to legal proceedings \u2013 expropriated, fined, dismissed, jailed, relocated, condemned to forced labor, stripped of civil rights \u2013 or those related to extrajudicial violence, like those raped, mutilated, beaten, tortured, humiliated, detained or those who found their property vandalized, stolen, burnt or otherwise destroyed. One study suggests that the number of CPIP detainees only might have been 18,000.<ref>Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, p. 12</ref> Initially the number of executed was counted in tens of thousands, e.g. in early 1937 ''[[The Guardian]]'' coined the figure of 40,000.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 3</ref> The Francoist ''Dictamen'', released in 1939, opted for 60,000, though confidentially the numbers were soon reduced to 18,000.<ref>Ruiz 2014, pp. 3-4</ref> Until the end of [[Francoism]] it was impossible to verify these claims; archival research of the late 20th century produced two lists of identified victims, one totaling 8,815<ref>Rafael Casas de la Vega, ''El Terror.

Existing sets of more thorough data refer to specific processes and it is not clear how representative they are; this is e.g. the case of files produced by popular tribunals. Some scholars tend to accept them as indicative of general social composition of all the repressed,<ref>see the analysis in Cervera 1998</ref> though e.g. in case of sex there are significant discrepancies noted.<ref>Popular tribunal data indicate that females formed 26% of the defendants (Cervera 1998, p. 171), while on lists of those killed during paseos the females make up 7% (Ruiz 2014, p. 4). The discrepancy gives rise to a hypothesis that detained women were more likely than men to evade execution and enjoyed far greater chance to be delivered for orderly trial, which in turn might render the tribunal data scarcely representative.</ref> According to the tribunal files most of the defendants were empleados, a wide and ambiguous category generally pointing to white-collar hired employees; among other top categories housewives form 14%, military 12% and students 8%; industry workers make up 6%.<ref>Cervera 1998, p. 151</ref> In terms of age the prevailing category are these between 26 and 30 (17%),<ref>followed by these aged 20\u201325 (15%), 31\u201335 (13%) and 36\u201340 (13%), Cervera 1998, p. 167</ref> 52% of the defendants were singles and 41% were married.<ref>Cervera 1998, p. 169</ref> In terms of their political preferences the overwhelming majority belonged to two parties, [[Acci\u00f3n Popular (Spain)|Acci\u00f3n Popular]] (40%) and [[Falange Espa\u00f1ola de las JONS|Falange]] (38%).<ref>some 10% were recorded as supporters of [[Renovaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola]], Cervera 1998, pp. 193\u2013166</ref> According to claims based on oral accounts there were two social groups which stood out as key targets of repression: the military and the religious, both approached as uniformed arms and propaganda departments of the same enemy. These claims are not substantiated by the tribunal data, which indicates that 57% of the military defendants were acquitted;<ref>Cervera 1998, p. 154</ref> in case of the religious the figure was 75%.<ref>Cervera 1998, p. 155</ref> Relatively high percentage of acquittals suggests that the tribunals made some effort to investigate the cases and did not default to death sentences. It also suggests that at least 50% of individuals detained and later appearing in court were not engaged in any conspiracy. How many detainees executed before facing trial were engaged in anti-Republican activities is impossible to tell,<ref>counter-espionage services kept claiming successes when fighting conspiracy, e.g. in May 1937 \"San Francisco El Grande\" network was broken up, later that year \"Golfin-Corujo organisation\" was unearthed, and in April 1938 members of \"163 Conspiracy\" were apprehended, Ruiz 2014, pp. 286\u2013293. Given all documentation related is produced by security forces telling to what extent charges were made up is impossible</ref> especially that the term was applied very flexibly.<ref>e.g. paperclips with obituary of Calvo Sotelo might have been considered subversive materials, Ruiz 2014, pp. 248\u20139</ref> Membership in foreign diplomatic corps did not save from arrest or execution.<ref>a Belgian diplomat Jacques Borchgrave was detained and shot in December 1936. A diplomatic scandal ensued; it was settled a year later, when the Republican government paid 1m francs of indemnity and the Belgians agreed to recognize that no government agent was involved, Ruiz 2014, p. 285. Not all cases ended up with compromise; following a similar case, Uruguay broke diplomatic relations with Spain</ref>\n[[File:Monch\u00edn Triana.jpg|thumb|160px|[[:es:Monch\u00edn Triana|\"Monch\u00edn\" Triana]]]]\nMany nationally known personalities fell victim to the Madrid repression.

Also sport personalities might have been subject to repression, as demonstrated by cases of [[Ricardo Zamora|Ricardo Zamora Mart\u00ednez]] (who escaped death), [[:es:Monch\u00edn Triana|Ramon Triana Arroyo]] and [[:es:Hernando Fitz-James Stuart y Falc\u00f3|Hernando Fitz-James Stuart]].\n\n==Time and geography==\n[[File:C\u00edrculo de Bellas Artes - 01.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Checa de Bellas Artes]]\nThere is no study which suggests even approximate quantitative estimates of the scale of Madrid repression year by year. However, almost all studies suggest that most violence took place in 1936. One historian claims that 96% of executions took place in 1936;<ref>Cervera 1995-1996, p. 76</ref> some challenge or reject the methodology altogether, others tend to accept the figures.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 4</ref> An analysis of paseos only, the study based on files stored in the Madrid Audiencia Territorial, indicates that 97,6% of these killings took place before 1937,<ref>Cervera 1995-1996, p. 76</ref> though documentation stored might also reflect changing procedural and filing patterns within the security forces. Detailed analysis of existing evidence of small-scale executions suggests that they climaxed in July (400),<ref>372 bodies were collected for burial at the Cementerio del Este, Ruiz 2014, p. 70</ref> August (650) and September (550), with smaller figures for October and November (around 300 each) and still lower in December (below 100).<ref>Cervera 1996-1996, p. 77, also Cervera 1998, especially graphs on pp. 73\u201379</ref> However, it should by no means be assumed that the overall number of victims decreased throughout 1936; the Paracuellos executions, carried out in late November and early December, took the toll of at least 2,000 victims with few estimates pointing to around 4,000. There is no doubt that the scale of the killings was much smaller throughout 1937, 1938 and 1939, especially that since the spring of 1937 the Minister of Justice [[Juan Garc\u00eda Oliver|Garcia Olivier]] strove to set up a wide network of forced labor camps and advanced the thesis that rather than be punished by death for their crimes, the enemies of the Republic should redeem their deeds by hard work.<ref>Cervera 2015, pp. 214\u2013215</ref> However, also after then executions continued and at times climaxed in large-scale waves of killings; in November 1937 at least 67 individuals were executed in a scam known as T\u00fanel de Usera, while in March 1939 SIM cracked down on unspecified number of Communists, with many of them killed.\n\nGeographical analysis of repression system in the Republican Madrid does not demonstrate any specific pattern as to location of Madrid detention centers. With 4 checas per square kilometer on average, they were covering the city with dense and rather regular network;<ref>detailed analysis Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 86, Cervera 1998, pp. 64\u201365</ref> even at that time suburban borough of [[Puente de Vallecas]] hosted 17 such places.<ref>see e.g. a map published in ''La Raz\u00f3n'', available [http://www.larazon.es/documents/10165/0/video_content_5602772_20161030003713.pdf here]</ref> Among 5 checas with the largest number of victims recorded, Checa San Bernardo, Checa Lista and Checa Santa Engracia were located in the very centre, while Checa del Ateneo and Checa del Circulo somewhat more outside.<ref>out of some 100 barrios of Madrid there were 20 with no checas, Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 87</ref> Headquarters of CPIP, perhaps the most prominent institution of Republican repression system,<ref>the number of deaths administered or otherwise effectuated by CPIP is estimated between 2,400 and 7,200, Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, p. 18</ref> was centrally located first at [[Calle de Alcala]] and then at Calle de Fomento; premises of DGS and its agendas were scattered around the [[Salamanca (Madrid)|Salamanca district]], usually at or near [[:es:Calle de Serrano|Calle de Serrano]]. Until mid-1937 most detentions were carried out in the districts of [[Chamberi (Madrid)|Chamberi]] and [[Buenavista (Madrid)|Buenavista]]; later these areas ceased to stand out.<ref>Cervera 1998. pp. 161\u2013162</ref>\n[[File:Madrile\u00f1os en el Parque de San Isidro.JPG|thumb|[[:es:Parque dec San Isidro|Pradera de San Isidro]] today]]\nGeographical location of execution sites changed over time.<ref>details Cervera 1995-1996</ref> During the first months of the conflict the inmates were taken usually to the Western districts of Madrid or to its Western suburbs, especially to [[Aravaca]] in the North, large green areas of [[Casa de Campo]] in the centre and to the park known as [[:es:Parque dec San Isidro|Pradera de San Isidro]] in the South.<ref>Cervera 1995-1996, p. 81</ref> It is supposed that these sparsely populated and partially rural areas were deemed more suitable for executions than more densely inhabited Eastern and Northern peripheries of the capital. However, as the Nationalist troops approached from the West, Aravaca or Casa del Campo found themselves dangerously close to the frontline and soon became the battlefield themselves, which prompted re-orientation of executions. Since October they were taking place in the East and in the South, especially in [[Rivas-Vaciamadrid]], along Carretera de Andalusia and near [[Cementerio de la Almudena|Cimiterio del Este]].<ref>Cervera 1995-1996, pp. 80\u201381</ref> Paracuellos de Jarama was chosen as site of the largest executions because it remained away from the frontline, because there was an easy road access from Madrid, and because local [[ayuntamiento]]s were considered politically reliable, ready to organize the locals for work related to burying the bodies.<ref>Ruiz 2014, pp. 230 and onwards</ref>\n\n==Protagonists==\n[[File:\u00c1ngel Galarza.png|thumb|160px|left|[[:es:\u00c1ngel Galarza|\u00c1ngel Galarza]]]]\nDuring the first few weeks of the war the person responsible for public order in Republican Spain was [[Sebasti\u00e1n Pozas Perea]], the Minister of Interior; scarcely involved in local Madrid issues, he nevertheless demonstrated complacency towards the revolutionary groupings.<ref>as example of Pozas' yielding position versus the militias some historians quote his stand in case of the so-called Jaen trains, Ruiz 2014, pp. 154\u2013156</ref> His second in command, the DSG head [[:es:Jos\u00e9 Alonso Mallo|Jos\u00e9 Alonso Mallo]]l, tried to preserve integrity of state structures yet overwhelmed by events, he resigned on July 31, 1936. His replacement was [[:es:Manuel Mu\u00f1oz Mart\u00ednez|Manuel Mu\u00f1oz Mart\u00ednez]],<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 372</ref> who since early September reported already to the new minister, [[:es:\u00c1ngel Galarza|Angel Galarza Gago]]. The two remained key public order officials in Madrid until early November 1936, when they left the capital. From this moment onwards both Galarza and Mu\u00f1oz, but also their successors at ministry and DSG retained less influence over state public order structures in Madrid. Their role was about initiating and overseeing some structural changes, yet implementation and local public order policy remained largely in hands of [[Junta de Defensa de Madrid]] (JDM) and later other local bodies.\n\nJDM was set up in early November 1936; its branch responsible for public order, Consejeria de Orden P\u00fablico, was assumed by [[Santiago Carrillo Solares|Santiago Carillo Solares]] and his deputy [[Jos\u00e9 Cazorla Maure|Jos\u00e9 Cazorla Maur\u00e9.]] When a month later Carillo left Madrid, it was Cazorla who became the most potent man in security forces of the capital, the post held almost until the dissolution of JDM in April 1937.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 369</ref> For a few months various individuals competed for power, like e.g. David V\u00e1zquez Baldominos, Cazorla's nominee as inspector general of Madrid police. In the summer of 1937 [[Gustavo Dur\u00e1n|Gustavo Dur\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez]] was appointed head of the Madrid SIM. His tenure lasted few months; in October 1937 he was replaced by [[:es:\u00c1ngel Pedrero Garc\u00eda|\u00c1ngel Pedrero Garc\u00eda]], former deputy head of the Atadell Brigade and a personal [[Indalecio Prieto|Prieto's]] trustee.<ref>Julius Ruiz, ''Defending the Republic: The Garc\u00eda Atadell Brigade in Madrid, 1936'', [in:] ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 42 (2007), pp. 114-115</ref> Pedrero was the most important man in Madrid policing structures for 17 month; during the Casado coup in March 1939 he greatly assisted the rebels by leading SIM to arrest a number of Communist personalities in Madrid.<ref>Ruiz 2007, p. 115</ref> He left the capital in late March; at that time the key man behind forces of order was [[:es:Vicente Girauta Linares|Vicente Girauta Li\u00f1ares]], since mid-1938 Comisario General de Seguridad in the province.<ref>''BOE'' 18.08.1937, available [https://www.boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1938/230/B00812-00812.pdf here], Ruiz 2014, p. 88</ref>\n\nSome individuals rather briefly commanded important public order structures. This was the case of [[Segundo Serrano Poncela]]; he headed the DSG Security Council only few weeks, just in time to issue orders to extract prisoners who ended up at Paracuellos.<ref>Ruiz 2014, pp. 239\u2013240</ref> Federico Manzano Govantes first directed MVR and effectively managed the militias manning the Paracuellos extractions; later he moved to SIM.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 243</ref> Ram\u00f3n Rasc\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez headed CPIP personal section, sat in DGS council and led its prison department, headed commissions selecting inmates for Paracuellos and left for the front in 1937.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 373</ref> Manuel Salgado Moreira vigorously commanded military counter-intelligence at the turn of 1936 and 1937 and organized some spectacular scams, like the false Siam embassy.

After few days he managed to secure his re-appointment. It is not clear whether he managed to stop the Paracuellos killings again, compare Ruiz 2014, p. 283, or whether the extractions were stopped anyway, as due to international uproar they were no longer \"plausibly deniable\", Ruiz 2014, p. 236</ref>\n[[File:Santiago Carrillo par Claude Truong-Ngoc 1979.jpg|thumb|[[Santiago Carrillo]]]]\nThere are individuals who did not hold top positions in power structures yet made themselves known as particularly efficient when implementing new order.

Mallol and Mu\u00f1oz were former [[Radical Socialist Republican Party|Republican Radical-Socialists]] and both joined [[Izquierda Republicana]] in the mid-1930s; also Galarza was former PRRSI militant, but unlike his colleagues he preferred to move to [[PSOE]] and as a Socialist and [[Largo Caballero|Largo Caballero's]] nominee he landed the job of Minister of Interior. The new head of Madrid police appointed in late July, [[:es:Manuel L\u00f3pez del Rey|Manuel L\u00f3pez Rey Arroyo]], was also the IR man.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 77; his tenure did not last long; in September he was promoted to director of prisons nationwide, ''L\u00f3pez-Rey Arrojo, Manuel'' entry, [in:] ''Diccionario de Catedr\u00e1ticos Espa\u00f1oles de Derecho'', available [http://portal.uc3m.es/portal/page/portal/instituto_figuerola/programas/phu/diccionariodecatedraticos/lcatedraticos/lopezrey here]</ref> Indeed, some scholars claim that early weeks of the war were marked by attempts to maintain \"bourgeoisie policing\",<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 71</ref> the pattern which was abandoned and gave way to a new type of security at the moment when CPIP was called into being. Its creation acknowledged actual new balance of power, certified by mushrooming party and trade union militias. Attempts to gauge the share of political influences among these units are based on presumed affiliations of checas, operating in Madrid, yet this yardstick is inconclusive. Analysis of some 300 points broadly classified as checas seems to suggest that the Anarchist [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]-[[Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica|FAI]] and the Communist [[Partido Comunista de Espana|PCE]] controlled some 25% of them each, with the rest distributed among PSOE, [[Unified Socialist Youth|JSU]], various Republican groupings and politically ambiguous units like [[:es:Un\u00edos Hermanos Proletarios|UHT]].<ref>see map in ''La Raz\u00f3n'', published [http://www.larazon.es/documents/10165/0/video_content_5602772_20161030003713.pdf here]</ref> Analysis of some 70 larger detention centers reveals a 34% domination of CNT-FAI, with PCE behind 19%, PSOE 13% and JSU behind 6% of the units.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 90</ref>\n\nThe CPIP itself was theoretically controlled by a 30-member board divided equally among a number of parties,<ref>Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional de Trabajadores (CNT), Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica (FAI), Federaci\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rica de Juventudes Libertarias (FIJL), Partido Sindicalista (PS), Partido Socialista Obrero Espa\u00f1ol (PSOE), Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores (UGT), Partido Comunista Espa\u00f1ol (PCE), Juventudes Socialistas Unificadas (JSU) Izquierda Republicana (IR) and Uni\u00f3n Republicana (UR), Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, p. 10</ref> yet its investigative squads reflected clear Anarchist domination: 40% were related to CNT-FAI, 19% to PSOE and 19% to PCE.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 102</ref> The end of \"bourgeoisie policing\" was marked also by transformation of CIV, the state plain clothes police; this formation was overtaken by the Socialists, as 31% of new recruits were from UGT, 17% from PSOE, 15% from IR, 5% from PCE and mere 3% - perhaps unsurprisingly, given the Anarchist position versus state structures in general and police in particular \u2013 from CNT-FAI.<ref>Ruiz 2014, pp. 90\u201391</ref> IGM, a body marginally involved in security system, was also in 64% dominated by PSOE with marginal Anarchist presence.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 101</ref> Definitely more important MVR was similarly the socialist fiefdom; its director Manzano was a PSOE man at the time<ref>later he changed colors and joined the Communists, Ruiz 2014, p. 243</ref> and 59% of militiamen registered were members of UGT; however, PCE affiliations marked 17% of those recorded and membership in Communist-dominated JSU was indicated by 14%.<ref>Ruiz 2014, pp. 180\u2013182</ref>\n\nPolitical control of state security structures in Madrid turned a corner with the government leaving the capital. Within JDM the public order department was seized by the Communists as reflected by appointments of Carillo and Cazorla,<ref>new Consejo de la Direcci\u00f3n General de Seguridad, presided by Poncela, was composed mostly of members of PCU and JSU, Ruiz 2014, pp. 293\u2013240</ref> especially that PSOE-dominated CPIP and IGM were soon disbanded, while MVR followed suit some time afterwards. However, late 1936 and early 1937 are marked by mounting conflict between the Anarchists and the Communists, which following a shootout<ref>in what looked like an accidental night control getting got out of hand anarchist militiamen wounded [[Pablo Yague]], a PCE member and head of JDM Supply Department. Cazorla and PCE demanded dissolution of military counter-intelligence brigades controlled by CNT and exemplary punishment for the culprits; however, the Anarchists opposed these demands and the militiamen were eventually released, Ruiz 2014, p. 289</ref> and a cabinet war in the government led to dissolution of JDM; nevertheless, the Communists at least for some time retained control over some CIV brigades and used some in their campaigns, as suggested by Valenti's role in the fate of [[Andreu Nin|Nin]].<ref>Ruiz 2014, pp. 289\u2013292</ref> The Anarchists retained a grade of control over military counter-intelligence, supervised by Salgado and Val. Of the new bodies emergent in mid-1937, the Madrid DEDIDE was controlled by PCE<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 299</ref> while the Madrid SIM fell mostly into hands of the Socialists, as certified by political affiliations of its head, Pedrero.<ref>Ruiz 2007, p. 114</ref> The new police force, Cuerpo de Seguridad, was in 70% composed of former CPIP<ref>for fate of dissolved CPIP members see Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, pp. 25\u201327</ref> and in 30% of former MVR members, which given structure of these two dissolved formations suggests that PSOE got the upper hand.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 296</ref> The Republicans remained visible only in juridical bodies, e.g. in Jurados de Urgencia they formed 34% of the members, with CNT-FAI coming second at 21%.<ref>Ruiz 2014, pp. 296\u2013297</ref>\n[[File:PSOE antiguo.svg|thumb|160px|[[PSOE]] symbol]]\nIt appears that throughout most of 1938 the Madrid public order system remained a politically balanced structure with Communists (DEDIDE), Anarchists (military counter-intelligence, militias) and Socialists (Seguridad, SIM) keeping each other in check. This shaky modus vivendi was demolished during the [[National Defence Council (Spain)|Casado coup]] in March 1939, when PSOE-led SIM and Anarchist-led military units crushed the Communist resistance. The showdown left some of PCE personalities executed, like it was the case of former IGM head [[Luis Barcel\u00f3|Barcel\u00f3]], and some imprisoned, like it was the case of former DSG Security Council head Cazorla. The last person who might be considered the top positioned man of Republican Madrid security, Girauta, was a professional policeman-detective and can hardly be put into any political rubric.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Causa General Manises.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[:es:Causa General|Causa General]] files]]\nFew protagonists of the Madrid policing units were captured by the Nationalists in course of the war; it was the case of Atadell, who in November 1936 was intercepted in [[Canary Islands]] when the French [[cruise liner]] he had boarded in [[St. Nazaire]] was about to set off for [[Cuba]].<ref>Ruiz 2007, pp. 111-113</ref> Some high officials who no longer held their posts \u2013 Galarza, Mu\u00f1oz, Carillo, Serrano Poncela, and Pozas \u2013 crossed the French border in [[Catalonia]] in early 1939. Most of these still involved left Madrid during final weeks of the war and headed for the [[Levante, Spain|Levantine]] coast, but few managed to leave Spain; Val secured a seat in an aircraft, while Duran and Salgado boarded a British warship. The rest found themselves trapped on the quays of [[Alicante]] in vain waiting for a ship to get them out. Many \u2013 like Girauta, Manzano, de Mora, Pedrero, Sandoval and Valenti \u2013 were apprehended there and identified already in April 1939. Some managed to slip through the Nationalist security net and tried to start a new life assuming a false identity. However, the Francoist hunters were determined in their pursuit; Mancebo and Cazorla<ref>Cazorla was arrested by the Casadistas when holding the post of civil governor of Guadalajara.

Madrid 1936'', Toledo 1994, {{ISBN|9788488787040}}, Cesar Vidal, ''Checas de Madrid'', Barcelona 2004, {{ISBN|9788497931687}}, Julius Ruiz, ''Red Terror and the Spanish Civil War'', Cambridge 2015, {{ISBN|9781107682931}}. A few works on wartime Madrid are not dedicated exclusively to terror, but dwell on it extensively, see e.g. Javier Cervera, ''Madrid en guerra'', Madrid 1998, {{ISBN|9788420629087}}, or [[Pedro Montoli\u00fa|Pedro Montoli\u00fa Camps]], ''Madrid en la guerra civil: La historia'', Madrid 1998, {{ISBN|9788477370727}}</ref> some specific issues, especially the Paracuellos killings, also earned a sizeable literature. However, these contributions are by no means ultimate pronouncement on the issue; most of the questions raised are still subject to historiographic debates, usually unrelated to Madrid specifics but referring to violence during the Civil War in general. In the early 21st century it was hoped that the discourse was approaching \"synthesis\"<ref>Francois Godicheau, ''La represi\u00f3n y la guerra civil espa\u00f1ola. Memoria y tratamiento hist\u00f3rico'', [in:] ''Prohistoria'' 5 (2001), p. 112</ref> and \"normalisaci\u00f3n\".<ref>Godicheau 2001, p. 117</ref> yet this judgment turned decisively premature; quite to the contrary, the debate grew \"more heated than ever before\".<ref>Maria Thomas, ''Political Violence in the Republican Zone of Spain during the Spanish Civil War: Evolving Historiographical Perspectives'', [in:] ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 52/1 (2017), p. 140</ref>\n\nThe central point of almost all debates is the role of state structures in repression behind the Republican lines. Most generally, the discussion is whether violence occurred despite of or because of the regime; some claim that terror was integral to the Republic's system<ref>Fernando del Rey Reguillo, ''Por tierras de la Mancha: Apuntos sobre la violencia revolucionaria en la Guerra Civil espa\u00f1ola (1936-1939)'', [in:] ''Alcores'' 11 (2011), pp. 261\u2013262, Ruiz 2014, p. 8</ref> and some maintain that it was fundamentally opposed by official structures.<ref>Thomas 2017, p. 145</ref> Most specific problems are part of this general dilemma. One of these questions is existence of a blueprint for extermination; some suggest that Republican violence resulted from a pre-meditated general strategy,<ref>the extermination thesis is perhaps most decisively presented in Cesar Vidal, ''Paracuellos \u2013 Katyn: un ensayo sobre el genocidio de la izquierda'', Madrid 2005, {{ISBN|9788496088320}}</ref> others claim that no such plan, strategy or intention has ever existed.<ref>Ruiz 2014, pp. 333-334</ref> Another question is whether violence might be perceived as a revolution; some scholars see the Civil War principally in revolutionary terms, others note that violence \"was not related to any revolutionary project\".<ref>Cervera 1995-1996, p. 67</ref> These who associate violence with revolution<ref>see e.g. [[Chris Ealham]], ''Class, Culture and Conflict in Barcelona, 1898-1937'', London 2004, {{ISBN|9781134423392}}, or Juli\u00e1n Casanova, ''Anarquismo y revoluci\u00f3n en la sociedad rural aragonesa, 1936-1938'', Madrid 1985, {{ISBN|9788432305122}}</ref> debate whether it was a Communist, multifold or \"leaderless\" one.<ref>Chris Ealham, ''\u2018Myths\u2019 and the Spanish Civil War: Some Old, Some Exploded, Some Clearly Borrowed and Some Almost \u2018Blue\u2019'', [in:] ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 42/2 (2007), p. 372</ref> Some suppose that the state was assuming a revolutionary format<ref>Payne 2007, p. 370</ref> and some disagree by claiming that it competed for power with revolutionary groupings.<ref>F. J. Jim\u00e9nez Herrera, ''\u2018El Terror Rojo\u2019.

Payne, referred after Gerald Blaney Jr, ''Violence, Continuity, and the Spanish State: Some Considerations'', [in:] ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 51/2 (2016), p. 415</ref> or by fragmentation of power.<ref>Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2017. Fragmentation of power is a theory advanced mostly by Ledesma, see Jos\u00e9 Luis Ledesma Vera, ''Total War behind the Frontlines. An Inquiry into the Violence on the Republican Side in the Spanish Civil War in the Age of Total War'', [in:] M. Baumeister, S. Schuler-Springorum, ''If you tolerate this: the Spanish Civil War in the Age of Total War'', Frankfurt a/M, 2008, {{ISBN|9783593386942}}</ref> A separate problem is \"autonomous violence\"<ref>Cervera 1995-1996, p. 67</ref> or the impact of criminal activity;<ref>see e.g. Paul Preston, ''The Spanish Holocaust'', London 2013, {{ISBN|9780006386957}}, p. xiii; \"opening of the prisons saw hundreds of common criminals released, among them sadists and psychopaths who were only too willing to use the political chaos as a shield for their activities\", Preston 2013, p. 259</ref> some consider it central and key for terror in the Republican rear, others apply the criminal tag to systemic nature of the Republic,<ref>Estado Espa\u00f1ol, ''Dictamen de la Comisi\u00f3n sobre ilegitimidad de poderes actuantes en 18 de julio de 1936'', Barcelona 1939, p. 104</ref> and some consider the criminal thread generally misleading. A related analytical concept is this of \"incontrolados\";<ref>key supporter of the thesis is Alberto Reig Tapia, see Alberto Reig Tapia, ''Ideolog\u00eda y historia: sobre la represi\u00f3n franquista y la guerra civil'', Madrid 1984, {{ISBN|9788476000144}}</ref> some approach them as key agents of violence,<ref>e.g. Atadell is presented as one of \"thieves and criminals that passed themselves off as radical or revolutionary socialists\", opinion of Juli\u00e1 1999, p. 132, and \"leading protagonist of uncontrollable murders in Madrid\", Javier Tusell, ''Historia de Espa\u00f1a en el siglo XX. II. La crisis de los a\u00f1os treinta. Rep\u00fablica y Guerra Civil'', Madrid 1998, {{ISBN|9788430606306}}, p. 315</ref> others claim that principal protagonists of terror were firmly mounted within political structures.<ref>one author notes that only 3 CPIP operatives had been earlier convicted of crimes, Jim\u00e9nez Herrera 2014, pp. 30\u201331. Another author claims that one of the best known cases of criminal incontrolados, Luis Bonilla, was executed by the Republicans not because he was a criminal, but because he lacked political sponsor, Julius Ruiz, ''\"Incontrolados\" en la Espa\u00f1a republicana durante la guerra civil el caso de Luis Bonilla Echevarr\u00eda'', [in:] ''Historia y pol\u00edtica: Ideas, procesos y movimientos sociales'' 21 (2009), pp. 191\u2013218</ref> The role of ideology remains disputed; some name the public order model adopted in the Republican zone a \"crusade\" against ideological enemies<ref>Blaney 2016, p. 419</ref> and underline importance of inflammatory, ideology-driven press,<ref>one Socialist daily claimed that \"the instigators [of rebellion] were all members of the old and rotten society...\" and went on listing its their sub-categories, ''El Socialista'' 21.07.1936; another called \"don\u2019t be sentimental\", ''CNT'' 31.07.1936; one more demanded \"death penalty\" to \"hidden enemies\", ''Claridad'' 09.10.1936; top Republican personalities like Ib\u00e1rruri or Nelken penned articles and delivered lectures by some scholars presented as inflammatory, Ruiz 2014, pp. 60, Julius Ruiz, ''Militant history and the Spanish Civil War. Paul Preston\u2019s The Spanish Holocaust'', [in:] Academia.edu service, pp. 26, 37\u201338, available [https://www.academia.edu/21410016/Militant_History_and_the_Spanish_Civil_War_Paul_Prestons_Spanish_Holocaust here]</ref> others claim that focus on ideology obscures a complex tangle of various factors.<ref>Anderson 2017, p. 133</ref> One more point is reactive nature of terror behind the Republican lines.<ref>\"in contrast, the repression in the Republican zone was hot-blooded and reactive\", Preston 2013, pp. xii-xiii, same opinion in Cathie Carmichael, ''The Need to Record the Past'', [in:] ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 51/2 (2016), p. 438</ref> There are scholars who discuss outbreaks of violence in relation to specific preceding events<ref>like Nationalist bombing raids, radio harrangues of Queipo de Llano or news aboud the Badajoz massacre; Preston 2013 titled his a chapter on Paracuellos killings \"the response of a terrorised city\"</ref> or to systemic features of Spanish society and politics.<ref>like decades of establishment-driven politics or omnipresence of Church and religion; one scholar notes that \"Spain\u2019s harshly repressive society had produced a brutalized underclass\", Preston 2013, p. 259</ref> Others either question factual sequences presented<ref>one scholar claims that Nationalist bombing raids, supposed to have led to outburst of violence in August 1936, have never taken place, Ruiz 2012, p. 190</ref> or the logic of structural links advanced and reject the \"reactive\" label. A related problem is this of continuity; some students see the wartime unrest as climax of violence mounting through previous decades,<ref>see e.g. claims that violence of the Civil War \"can be explained through reading of the early Republican period\", Fernando del Rey, ''The Spanish Second Republic Revisited: From Democratic Hopes to Civil War (1931-1936)'', London 2013, {{ISBN|9781845195922}}, pp. 432\u2013433</ref> others make it clear that these are two clearly distinct phenomena.<ref>Blaney 2016, p. 415, Roberto Villa Garc\u00eda, ''The Second Republic: Myths and Realities'', [in:] ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 51/2 (2016), p. 421</ref> One more and also related puzzle is about selective or sweeping nature of terror, namely whether it was directed against specific individuals, whether it was generally chaotic or whether it was aimed against particular sections of the population.<ref>see e.g. Cervera 1998, p. 153. The author inspected verdicts of popular tribunals and concluded that 50% of cases resulted in acquitttal and death penalties formed 8%</ref> Many authors claim that since there was no real threat of [[Fifth Column]],<ref>one author admits that anti-Republican conspiracy might have involved 3,000 individuals and further 30,000 \"collaborators\", yet notes they were engaged mostly in mutual assistance, evasion and psychological warfare, with cases of gathering intelligence and small-scale sabotage being rather marginal, Ruiz 2014, p. 287</ref> the Republican repressive measures were means of terrorizing the population; many others relate violence to anti-Republican conspiracy and consider it mostly means of fighting Nationalist subversion.<ref>\"in addition, there was the real military necessity of combating the enemy within\", Preston 2013, p. xiii, on nocturnal snipers, saboteurs and agents Preston 2013, p. 293; in his 536-page monograph on wartime Madrid one author dedicates 100 pages to the Fifth Column, Cervera 1998, pp. 235\u2013338</ref> The role of the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] remains another point of contention; some students consider it instrumental,<ref>Angel Vi\u00f1as, ''Aportaciones para una reescritura de la Guerra Civil espa\u00f1ola'', [in:] ''Revista de libros'' 59 (2010), pp. 9\u201312</ref> others tend to view it as of minor importance.<ref>Ruiz 2014, p. 257</ref>\n[[File:Julian Casanovas.jpg|thumb|[[Juli\u00e1n Casanova Ruiz|Julian Casanova]]]]\nMost if not all questions discussed in general translate also to specifics of Madrid; in case of the capital they might be anchored in issues related to 100-day period of central government institutions operating from the capital, genesis and role of CPIP, transformation of police force, relations between JDM and central authorities operating from [[Valencia]], mechanics of the Paracuellos executions, responsibility of single individuals like Carillo, [[Alexander Orlov (Soviet defector)|Orlov]] or Galarza, functioning of local branches of central institutions like DEDIDE, SIM or DSG, role of the Fifth Column, specifics related to proximity to the frontlines, local balance of power between key political groupings or Madrid dynamics of the Casado coup. However, local-scale analysis has not significantly contributed to reaching consensus in general debate and in most of the cases discussed agreement seems to be nowhere near; moreover, in terms of tension and vitriol historiographic debate has been recently brought to another level<ref>compare contributions of Blaney, Villa Garcia, Alvarez Tardio and del Rey in ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 51/2 (2016) and Vinas, Anderson, Thomas, Casanova and Marco in ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 52/1 (2017), all triggered by a review article of Ealham in ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 48/1 (2012); most authors suspect their adversaries of pursuing a hidden political or ideological agenda. Escalation of abuse seems to be ongoing, see the article ''\u201cCry babies\u201d or authoritarians?'', being prepared by Chris Ealham, available [https://www.academia.edu/20370846/_Cry_babies_or_authoritarians_An_examination_of_the_reasons_why_Spain_s_historical_revisionists_simply_cannot_take_criticism_from_their_contemporaries_while_they_are_more_than_willing_to_dish_it_out here]</ref> and some suggest that it is less of a historiography and more of a \"memory war\".<ref>Fernando del Rey, ''The Spanish Second Republic and Political Violence'', [in:] ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 51/2 (2016), p. 431</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Red Terror (Spain)]]\n* [[Paracuellos massacres]]\n* [[Madrid Defense Council]]\n* [[Revisionism (Spain)]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Rafael Casas de la Vega, ''El Terror.

The school has numerous [[alumni]] in the arts, politics, sports, science, and business.\n\n==History==\n\nBelvedere owes its origins to the scholastic apostolate of [[John Austin (Jesuit)|Fr. John Austin S.J.]] who opened primary and secondary schools off [[Fishamble Street]] in 1750. The [[Society of Jesus]] has been active in the area around Hardwicke Street since 1790. They founded [[St Francis Xavier|St Francis Xavier's College]] in a disused convent on Hardwicke Street with nine students in 1832, three years after [[Catholic emancipation]]. In 1841, the Jesuits purchased [[Belvedere House, Dublin|Belvedere House]] on neighbouring Great Denmark Street, which gave the school its name. [[George Augustus Rochfort]] (1738\u20131814), who became the second [[Earl of Belvedere]] in 1774, built Belvedere House, whose interior decoration was carried out by [[Michael Stapleton]], a leading stucco craftsman of his time.<ref name=history1>{{cite book|last= Lucey|first=Conor|year=2007|title=The Stapleton Collection: Designs for the Irish neoclassical interior|location=Tralee|publisher=Churchill Press|isbn=978-0-9550246-2-7}}</ref>\n\nBelvedere was caught up in the events of the [[1916 Rising]], when the British military opened fire at the Jesuit residence.<ref>John Bowman and Ronan O'Donoghue (eds.), ''Portraits : Belvedere College Dublin 1832-1982'', (Dublin, 1982)</ref><ref>Oliver Murphy, ''The cruel clouds of war : a book of the sixty-eight former pupils and teachers of Belvedere College S.J. who lost their lives in the military conflicts of the 20th century'', (Dublin, 2003)</ref> The Jesuits at Belvedere and the neighbouring Gardiner Street Community helped the wounded and distributed food across the locality.\n\nA school museum and archive were opened in 2002 by former teacher Oliver Murphy, dedicated to the history of the institution and its past pupils.<ref name=\"Irish Times, 2002\">{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/history-in-the-making-at-belvedere-college-1.1057182|title=History in the making at Belvedere College|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe school has always been fee-paying but provides a bursary scheme, independently funded, out of a desire to be socially just.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn February 2012 Chinese [[17th Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] member [[Xi Jinping]] visited the college as part of his visit to Ireland for a special reception in the O'Reilly theatre.

This system focuses on breadth with an emphasis on educating the whole student through developing their academic, sporting, creative, social and spiritual abilities based on the Roman system of education.\n\nIn recent decades there has been a particular focus on developing a sense of social justice in students with the unofficial phrase ''\"men for others\"'' often uttered by staff and in official school publications.\n\nBelvedere previously had a junior school (primary school) which offered boys education from 1st to 6th class however this closed in the mid-2000s due to the practicalities of bringing small children into the centre of the city.\n\n===Classics===\n\nThe school still offers Latin as both a Junior and Leaving Certificate subject and offers Ancient Greek as a Junior and Leaving Certificate subject when there is sufficient demand.

Most of the school's teaching staff are lay-persons, although a number of Jesuit priests and brothers assist with administration and chaplaincy.\n\nThe school motto is ''Per Vias Rectas'' \u2013 \"By Straight Paths\" \u2013 and the college aspires to produce \"Men for Others\". Students often write \"AMDG\" for ''[[Ad maiorem Dei gloriam]]'', \"For the greater glory of God\", the motto of the [[Jesuit|Society of Jesus]], on the top left of pages of their copybooks. They formerly  also wrote \"LDSetBVM\" or ''Laus Deo Semper et Beatae Virgini Mariae'' (\"Praise to God forever and to the Blessed Virgin Mary\") on the bottom right of the same page.\n\nThe students are assigned to one of six lines or houses, mainly named after Jesuits who were either famous or had an association with Belvedere: [[Ignatius of Loyola|Loyola]], [[Francis Xavier|Xavier]], [[Charles Aylmer|Aylmer]], [[Peter Kenney|Kenney]], [[Thomas A. Finlay|Finlay]] and Scully (previously named Dempsey after [[George Dempsey (teacher)|George Dempsey]]). Years are named after the progression in the Jesuit ''[[Ratio Studiorum]]'': Elements, Rudiments, Grammar, Syntax, Poetry, and Rhetoric. Each form except Rhetoric has a captain and vice-captain.\n\nThe unofficial school anthem, often heard at rugby matches, is \"Only In God\", based on [[Psalm 62]] in the Bible. The song was first sung at rugby matches during the 1995 and 1996 Senior Cup Campaigns after being popularised by religion teacher David O'Hanlon ('Dead-on Dave'). The official, less popular anthem, \"Belvedere, Oh Belvedere\", was composed by a past pupil and recorded by the school choir in 1997.\n\nThe school's yearbook is ''The Belvederian''. The term \"Belvederian\" is also sometimes used to refer to current students and \"Old Belvederian\" (OB) for alumni. Old Belvederians normally refer to their graduation by using \"OB\" followed by their final year in the college, for example, \"OB 1984\".\n\nBelvedere College is the backdrop for much of [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]''. It is a semi-autobiographical piece of work and the teacher, Mr Tate, was based on Joyce's own English teacher, [[George Dempsey (teacher)|George Dempsey]]. In the book Joyce mentions his involvement in the College Opera which continues today.<ref name=\"companion\">''Critical companion to James Joyce: a literary reference to his life and work'', by A.

According to Neil R.

The school has numerous [[alumni]] in the arts, politics, sports, science, and business.\n\n==History==\n\nBelvedere owes its origins to the scholastic apostolate of [[John Austin (Jesuit)|Fr. John Austin S.J.]] who opened primary and secondary schools off [[Fishamble Street]] in 1750. The [[Society of Jesus]] has been active in the area around Hardwicke Street since 1790. They founded [[St Francis Xavier|St Francis Xavier's College]] in a disused convent on Hardwicke Street with nine students in 1832, three years after [[Catholic emancipation]]. In 1841, the Jesuits purchased [[Belvedere House, Dublin|Belvedere House]] on neighbouring Great Denmark Street, which gave the school its name. [[George Augustus Rochfort]] (1738\u20131814), who became the second [[Earl of Belvedere]] in 1774, built Belvedere House, whose interior decoration was carried out by [[Michael Stapleton]], a leading stucco craftsman of his time.<ref name=history1>{{cite book|last= Lucey|first=Conor|year=2007|title=The Stapleton Collection: Designs for the Irish neoclassical interior|location=Tralee|publisher=Churchill Press|isbn=978-0-9550246-2-7}}</ref>\n\nBelvedere was caught up in the events of the [[1916 Rising]], when the British military opened fire at the Jesuit residence.<ref>John Bowman and Ronan O'Donoghue (eds.), ''Portraits : Belvedere College Dublin 1832-1982'', (Dublin, 1982)</ref><ref>Oliver Murphy, ''The cruel clouds of war : a book of the sixty-eight former pupils and teachers of Belvedere College S.J. who lost their lives in the military conflicts of the 20th century'', (Dublin, 2003)</ref> The Jesuits at Belvedere and the neighbouring Gardiner Street Community helped the wounded and distributed food across the locality.\n\nA school museum and archive were opened in 2002 by former teacher Oliver Murphy, dedicated to the history of the institution and its past pupils.<ref name=\"Irish Times, 2002\">{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/history-in-the-making-at-belvedere-college-1.1057182|title=History in the making at Belvedere College|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe school has always been fee-paying but provides a bursary scheme, independently funded, out of a desire to be socially just.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn February 2012 Chinese [[17th Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] member [[Xi Jinping]] visited the college as part of his visit to Ireland for a special reception in the O'Reilly theatre.

This system focuses on breadth with an emphasis on educating the whole student through developing their academic, sporting, creative, social and spiritual abilities based on the Roman system of education.\n\nIn recent decades there has been a particular focus on developing a sense of social justice in students with the unofficial phrase ''\"men for others\"'' often uttered by staff and in official school publications.\n\nBelvedere previously had a junior school (primary school) which offered boys education from 1st to 6th class however this closed in the mid-2000s due to the practicalities of bringing small children into the centre of the city.\n\n===Classics===\n\nThe school still offers Latin as both a Junior and Leaving Certificate subject and offers Ancient Greek as a Junior and Leaving Certificate subject when there is sufficient demand. Classical Studies is also offered at Leaving Certificate level.\n\n===Science===\nThe promotion of science has become a priority for Belvedere's Board of Management. Over \u20ac7 million has been invested in the Dargan-Maloney Science and Technology block.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} [[Garret A.

Some students travel with the annual Dublin Diocesan, Meath Diocesan and Oblate Pilgrimages to [[Lourdes]], France, to assist the elderly and the disabled. Belvedere's [[St. Vincent de Paul|St Vincent de Paul Society]] is one of the largest among secondary schools in Ireland, organising activities such as old-folks events and a weekly soup run in inner city Dublin.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Beginning in 1981, some students have undertaken a charity walk from Dublin to [[Galway]] each summer to raise funds for Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind, St Francis Hospice, and The [[Temple Street Children's University Hospital]], located very near the school.

The students fast for 24 hours during the Sleep-Out. The culmination is [[Christmas Eve]] midnight mass in the college chapel.

The play was written by a member of staff and was nominated for a Bord G\u00e1is Energy Student Theatre Award for Best Overall Play.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://bordgaisenergystudenttheatreawards.ie/shortlist-2017|title=Shortlist 2017 - Bord G\u00e1is Energy Student Theatre Awards|work=Bord G\u00e1is Energy Student Theatre Awards|access-date=2017-04-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409110810/https://bordgaisenergystudenttheatreawards.ie/shortlist-2017|archive-date=2017-04-09|url-status=dead}}</ref> The play was based on the book ''Children of The Rising'' by [[Joe Duffy]].\n\n==Other activities==\nThe school has debating societies in the English, Irish, Spanish, German, and French languages. Belvedere has won the all-Ireland schools debating competition (2005 among other years), the Denny Leinster Schools Senior Debating Championship in 2010, the L&H society Leinster Junior debating competition, and also the [[Alliance Fran\u00e7aise]] debating championship and Leinster Irish debating final.\n\nBelvedere was successful in the last ever series of ''Blackboard Jungle'', a popular television programme on [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]]. Some past pupils have also gone to take part in [[University Challenge]] while at University.\n\nThe school's longstanding [[Concert Choir]] hosts the Annual Christmas Carol Service in December, and the Annual Musical Evening in May. The choir have undertaken recordings in [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]], and has been successful at both the [[Feis Ceoil]] and the Wesley Feis. The College [[orchestra]] has won events at both the Wesley Feis and the [[Feis Ceoil]].\n\nThe school has an active urban farm, growing vegetables and housing bees. The farm won the Global High Schools Europe Category at the [[Zayed Future Energy Prize]] in 2017.\n\n==Culture of Belvedere==\n[[File:Belvedere College 2 Dublin.jpg|220px|right|thumb|Inner Yard Buildings]]\n[[File:Belevedere College, 6 Great Denmark Street Dublin.jpg|220px|right|thumb|New entrance]]\n\nBelvedere College is run by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] order. Most of the school's teaching staff are lay-persons, although a number of Jesuit priests and brothers assist with administration and chaplaincy.\n\nThe school motto is ''Per Vias Rectas'' \u2013 \"By Straight Paths\" \u2013 and the college aspires to produce \"Men for Others\". Students often write \"AMDG\" for ''[[Ad maiorem Dei gloriam]]'', \"For the greater glory of God\", the motto of the [[Jesuit|Society of Jesus]], on the top left of pages of their copybooks. They formerly  also wrote \"LDSetBVM\" or ''Laus Deo Semper et Beatae Virgini Mariae'' (\"Praise to God forever and to the Blessed Virgin Mary\") on the bottom right of the same page.\n\nThe students are assigned to one of six lines or houses, mainly named after Jesuits who were either famous or had an association with Belvedere: [[Ignatius of Loyola|Loyola]], [[Francis Xavier|Xavier]], [[Charles Aylmer|Aylmer]], [[Peter Kenney|Kenney]], [[Thomas A. Finlay|Finlay]] and Scully (previously named Dempsey after [[George Dempsey (teacher)|George Dempsey]]). Years are named after the progression in the Jesuit ''[[Ratio Studiorum]]'': Elements, Rudiments, Grammar, Syntax, Poetry, and Rhetoric. Each form except Rhetoric has a captain and vice-captain.\n\nThe unofficial school anthem, often heard at rugby matches, is \"Only In God\", based on [[Psalm 62]] in the Bible. The song was first sung at rugby matches during the 1995 and 1996 Senior Cup Campaigns after being popularised by religion teacher David O'Hanlon ('Dead-on Dave'). The official, less popular anthem, \"Belvedere, Oh Belvedere\", was composed by a past pupil and recorded by the school choir in 1997.\n\nThe school's yearbook is ''The Belvederian''. The term \"Belvederian\" is also sometimes used to refer to current students and \"Old Belvederian\" (OB) for alumni. Old Belvederians normally refer to their graduation by using \"OB\" followed by their final year in the college, for example, \"OB 1984\".\n\nBelvedere College is the backdrop for much of [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]''. It is a semi-autobiographical piece of work and the teacher, Mr Tate, was based on Joyce's own English teacher, [[George Dempsey (teacher)|George Dempsey]]. In the book Joyce mentions his involvement in the College Opera which continues today.<ref name=\"companion\">''Critical companion to James Joyce: a literary reference to his life and work'', by A.

James Aloysius Cullen S.J.]] was appointed spiritual father at Belvedere, a position he retained for twenty years while also engaged in other ministry. Cullen was founder and director of the Sodality of Our Lady at the college, which duties included counseling students. In 1896, [[James Joyce]] was elected Student Prefect of the Society. According to Neil R. Davison, the sermons in Chapter III of ''A Portrait of the Artist'' are modeled on those given by Cullen during a retreat held in 1897.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=s_eXYzdEmxcC&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=James+Cullen+S.J.&source=bl&ots=ZjVoQFcuxt&sig=ACfU3U3JniaioGkQj23RvnraS66WMqe31g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjp0Ir38dXiAhXymuAKHS0uC004FBDoATAAegQIBBAB#v=onepage&q=James%20Cullen%20S.J.&f=false Davison, Neil R.

Chikatilo was subsequently executed in February 1994.\n\nChikatilo was known as the \"Rostov Ripper\" and the \"Butcher of Rostov\" due to the fact he committed the majority of his murders in the [[Rostov Oblast]] of the Russian SFSR.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\nAndrei Chikatilo was born on 16 October 1936 in the village of [[:uk:\u042f\u0431\u043b\u0443\u0447\u043d\u0435 (\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d)|Yabluchne]] in the [[Sumy Oblast]] of the [[Ukrainian SSR]].

He would later be taken prisoner after being wounded in combat.<ref name=\":2\">''The Killer Department'', pp. 133\u2013134</ref> Between 1941 and 1944, Chikatilo witnessed some of the effects of the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Nazi occupation of Ukraine]], which he described as \"horrors\", adding he witnessed bombings, fires, and shootings from which he and his mother would hide in cellars and ditches.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 113</ref> On one occasion, Chikatilo and his mother were forced to watch their own hut burn to the ground.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 262\">''The Killer Department'', p. 262</ref> With his father at war, Chikatilo and his mother shared a single bed.

Because Chikatilo's father had been conscripted in 1941, he could not have fathered this child. As many Ukrainian women were raped by German soldiers during the war, it has been speculated Tatyana was conceived as a result of a rape committed by a German soldier. As Chikatilo and his mother lived in a one-room hut, this rape may have been committed in Chikatilo's presence.<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Kalman|title=Born to Kill in the USSR|publisher=Feisen Press|location=Victoria, British Columbia|date=2014|ISBN=978-1460227305|page=180}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1944,<ref name=\"Comrade Chikatilo, p. 143\"/> Chikatilo began his schooling. Although shy and ardently studious as a child, he was physically weak and regularly attended school in homespun clothing and, by 1946, with his stomach swollen from hunger resulting from the [[Soviet famine of 1946\u201347|post-war famine]] which plagued much of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Comrade Chikatilo, p. 143\"/> On several occasions, this hunger caused Chikatilo to faint both at home and at school,<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 262\"/> and he was consistently targeted by bullies<ref>''The Killer Department'', pp. 214\u2013215</ref> who regularly mocked him over his physical stature and timid nature. At home, Chikatilo and his sister were constantly berated by their mother. Tatyana later recalled that in spite of the hardships endured by her parents, their father was a kind man, whereas their mother was harsh and unforgiving toward her children.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nChikatilo developed a passion for reading and memorizing data, and often studied at home, both to increase his sense of self-worth and to compensate for his [[myopia]], which often prevented him from reading the classroom blackboard.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 261\">''The Killer Department'', p. 261</ref> To his teachers, Chikatilo was an excellent student upon whom they would regularly bestow praise and commendation.\n\n===Adolescence===\nBy his teens, Chikatilo was both a model student and an ardent [[communist]]. He was appointed editor of his school newspaper at age 14<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 146</ref> and chairman of the pupils' [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] committee two years later. An avid reader of communist literature, he was also delegated the task of organizing street marches.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 263\">''The Killer Department'', p. 263</ref> Although Chikatilo claimed learning did not come easy to him due to headaches and a poor memory, he was the only student from his collective farm to complete the final year of study, graduating with excellent grades in 1954.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 263\"/>\n\nAt the onset of [[puberty]], Chikatilo discovered that he suffered from chronic [[Erectile dysfunction|impotence]], worsening his social awkwardness and self-hatred.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 264\u2013265</ref> He was shy in the company of women;<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 264</ref> his first crush, at age 17, had been on a girl named Lilya Barysheva, with whom he had become acquainted through his school newspaper,<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 147</ref> yet he was chronically nervous in her company and never asked her for a date. The same year, Chikatilo jumped upon an 11-year-old friend of his younger sister and wrestled her to the ground, [[orgasm|ejaculating]] as the girl struggled in his grasp.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 216</ref>\n\nFollowing his graduation, Chikatilo applied for a scholarship at [[Moscow State University]]. Although he passed the entrance examination with good-to-excellent scores,<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 217\">''The Killer Department'', p. 217</ref> his grades were not deemed good enough for acceptance.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 217\"/> Chikatilo speculated his scholarship application was rejected due to his father's tainted war record (his father had been branded a traitor for being taken prisoner in 1943),<ref name=\"news.google.com\"/><ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 261\"/> but the truth was that other students had performed better in a highly competitive exam.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', pp. 18\u201319</ref> He did not attempt to enroll at another university; instead, he travelled to the city of [[Kursk]], where he worked as a labourer for three months before\u2014in 1955\u2014enrolling in a [[Vocational school#Central and Eastern Europe|vocational school]] with the aim of becoming a communications technician.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 217\"/> The same year, Chikatilo formed his first serious relationship, with a local girl two years his junior. On three separate occasions, the couple attempted intercourse, although on each occasion, Chikatilo was unable to sustain an erection.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 153</ref> After eighteen months, she broke off the relationship.\n\n===Army service===\nUpon completion of his two-year vocational training, Chikatilo relocated to the [[Ural Federal District|Urals]] city of [[Nizhny Tagil]]<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 19</ref> to work upon a long-term construction project. While living in Nizhny Tagil, he also undertook correspondence courses in engineering with the Moscow Electrotechnical Institute of Communication. He worked in the Urals for two years until he was drafted into the [[Soviet Army]] in 1957.\n\nChikatilo performed his compulsory military service between 1957 and 1960,<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 20</ref> assigned first to serve with [[Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|border guards]] in [[Central Asia]], then to a [[KGB]] communications unit in Berlin. Here, his work record was unblemished, and he joined the Communist Party in 1960, shortly before his military service ended.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 218</ref>\n\nUpon completing his service, Chikatilo returned to his native village to live with his parents. He soon became acquainted with a young divorc\u00e9e. Their three-month relationship ended after several unsuccessful attempts at intercourse, after which the woman innocently asked her friends for advice as to how Chikatilo might overcome his inability to maintain an erection.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 265\">''The Killer Department'', p. 265</ref> As a result, most of his peers discovered his impotence. In a 1993 interview regarding this incident, Chikatilo stated: \"Girls were going behind my back, whispering that I was impotent. I was so ashamed. I tried to hang myself. My mother and some young neighbours pulled me out of the noose. Well, I thought no one would want such a shamed man. So I had to run away from there, away from my homeland.\"<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 265\"/>\n\n==Move to Rostov-on-Don==\nAfter several months, Chikatilo found a job as a [[Telecommunications engineering|communications engineer]] in a town located north of [[Rostov-on-Don]]. He relocated to the [[Russian SFSR]] in 1961, renting a small apartment close to his workplace. The same year, his younger sister, Tatyana, finished her schooling and moved into his apartment (his parents would relocate to the Rostov region shortly thereafter).<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 157</ref> Tatyana lived with her brother for six months before marrying a local youth and moving into her in-laws' home; she noted nothing untoward with regard to her brother's lifestyle beyond his chronic shyness around women, and resolved to help her brother find a wife and start a family.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', pp. 24\u201325</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\nIn 1963 Chikatilo married a woman named Feodosia Odnacheva, to whom he had been introduced by his younger sister. According to Chikatilo, although he was attracted to Feodosia, his marriage was effectively an [[Arranged marriage|arranged]] one which occurred barely two weeks after they had met and in which the decisive roles were played by his sister and her husband.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 219\">''The Killer Department'', p. 219</ref>\n\nChikatilo later claimed that his marital sex life was minimal and that, after his wife understood he was unable to maintain an erection, they agreed she would conceive by him ejaculating externally and pushing his [[semen]] inside her vagina with his fingers.<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 266</ref> In 1965, Feodosia gave birth to a daughter, Lyudmila. Four years later, in 1969, a son named Yuri was born.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 219\"/>\n\n==Teaching career==\nChikatilo chose to enroll as a correspondence student at [[Southern Federal University|Rostov University]] in 1964,<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 29</ref> studying [[Russian literature]] and [[philology]];<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 231</ref> he obtained his degree in these subjects in 1970. Shortly before obtaining his degree, Chikatilo obtained a job managing regional sports activities.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 160</ref> He remained in this position for one year, before beginning his career as a teacher of Russian language and literature in [[Novoshakhtinsk]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Brian|last=Marriner|title=Cannibalism: The Last Taboo|publisher=[[Arrow Books]]|location=New York City|date=1992|ISBN=1-859-58495-0|page=242}}</ref>\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0439 \u211633 \u0433. \u0428\u0430\u0445\u0442\u044b.JPG|180px|right|thumb|Technical School No. 33, [[Shakhty]]. Chikatilo worked at this school at the time of his first murder<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 35</ref>]]\nChikatilo was largely ineffective as a teacher; although knowledgeable in the subjects he taught, he was seldom able to maintain discipline in his classes and was regularly subjected to mockery by his students who, he claimed, took advantage of his modest nature.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 30</ref>\n\n===Sexual assaults===\nIn May 1973, Chikatilo committed his first known sexual assault upon one of his pupils. In this incident, he swam towards a 15-year-old girl and groped her breasts and genitals, ejaculating as the girl struggled against his grasp. Months later, Chikatilo sexually assaulted another teenage girl whom he had locked in his classroom.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 187</ref> He was not disciplined for either of these incidents,<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 32</ref> nor for the occasions in which fellow teachers observed Chikatilo fondling himself in the presence of his students. One of Chikatilo's duties at this school was ensuring his students who boarded at the school were present in their dormitories in the evenings; on several occasions, he is known to have entered the girls' dormitory in the hope of seeing them undressed.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 163</ref>\n\nIn response to the increasing number of complaints lodged against him by his students, the director of the school summoned Chikatilo to a formal meeting and informed him he should either resign voluntarily, or be fired. Chikatilo left his employment discreetly and found another job as a teacher at another school in Novoshakhtinsk in January 1974. He lost this job as a result of staff cutbacks in September 1978, before finding another teaching position in [[Shakhty]], a coal-mining town close to Rostov-on-Don.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 223</ref>\n\nChikatilo's career as a teacher ended in March 1981 following several complaints of [[child molestation]] against pupils of both sexes.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 252</ref> The same month, he began a job as a supply clerk for a factory based in Rostov which produced construction materials.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 228</ref> This job required Chikatilo to travel extensively across much of the Soviet Union to either physically purchase the raw materials required to fulfill [[production quota]]s, or to negotiate supply contracts.\n\n==Initial murders==\n[[File:Yelena Zakotnova.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Yelena Zakotnova, aged 9.

The body of Yelena Zakotnova was found at this location on 24 December]]\nIn September 1978, Chikatilo moved to Shakhty, where he committed his first documented murder. On 22 December, Chikatilo lured a 9-year-old girl named Yelena Zakotnova to an old house which he had secretly purchased; he attempted to rape her but failed to achieve an erection. When the girl struggled, he choked her and stabbed her three times in the abdomen, ejaculating while stabbing the child. In an interview after his arrest, Chikatilo later recalled that immediately after stabbing Zakotnova, the girl had \"said something very [[Dysphonia|hoarsely]]\", whereupon he strangled her into unconsciousness before throwing her body into the nearby Grushevka River.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 43</ref> Her body was found two days later.\n\nNumerous pieces of evidence linked Chikatilo to Zakotnova's murder: spots of blood had been found in the snow near the house Chikatilo had purchased; neighbours had noted that Chikatilo had been present in the house on the evening of 22 December; Zakotnova's school rucksack had been found upon the opposite bank of the river at the end of the street (indicating the girl had been thrown into the river at this location); and a witness had given police a detailed description of a man closely resembling Chikatilo, whom she had seen talking with Zakotnova at the bus stop where the girl had last been seen alive.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 44</ref> Despite these facts, a 25-year-old labourer named Aleksandr Kravchenko (who had previously served a prison sentence for the rape and murder of a teenage girl)<ref>Murder in Mind issue 7 p. 3</ref> was arrested for the crime. A search of Kravchenko's home revealed spots of blood on his wife's jumper: the [[blood type]] was determined to match both Zakotnova and Kravchenko's wife.\n\nKravchenko had a watertight [[alibi]] for the afternoon of 22 December: he had been at home with his wife and a friend of hers the entire afternoon, and neighbours of the couple were able to verify this.<ref>''Murder in Mind'', issue 7, p. 3</ref> Nonetheless, the police, having threatened Kravchenko's wife with being an [[accomplice|accomplice to murder]] and her friend with [[perjury]], obtained new statements in which the women claimed Kravchenko had not returned home until late in the evening on the day of the murder.<ref name=Pristavkin>\"''Valley of Deadly Shadow''\" {{lang-ru|\u0414\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438}}, [[Anatoly Pristavkin]], Zebra, Moscow, pp. 30\u201333</ref> Confronted with these altered testimonies, Kravchenko confessed to the killing.<ref name=Pristavkin/> He was tried for the murder in 1979.

According to his subsequent confession, Chikatilo lured Tkachenko to a forest near the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] with the pretext of drinking vodka and \"relaxing\".<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 55\"/> When they reached a secluded area, he threw the girl to the ground before tearing off her clothes and attempting intercourse, as Tkachenko remonstrated against his actions.<ref>''Hunting The Devil'' p. 59</ref> When Chikatilo failed to achieve an erection, he forced mud inside her mouth to stifle her screams before battering and strangling her to death.

Murdered 12 June 1982. Biryuk was the first victim linked to a series of murders known to investigators as the ''Forest Strip Killings''<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 33</ref>]]\nNine months after the murder of Tkachenko, on 12 June 1982, Chikatilo travelled by bus to the [[Bagayevsky District]] of Rostov to purchase vegetables. Having to change buses in the village of [[Donskoy (inhabited locality)|Donskoi]], he decided to continue his journey on foot.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 199</ref> Walking away from the bus station, he encountered a 13-year-old girl, named Lyubov Biryuk, who was herself walking home from a shopping trip.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 4</ref> Once the path both were taking together was shielded from the view of potential witnesses by bushes, Chikatilo pounced upon Biryuk, dragged her into nearby undergrowth, tore off her dress, and killed her by stabbing and slashing her to death.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 60\">''The Red Ripper'', p. 60</ref> When her body was found on 27 June, the [[medical examiner]] discovered evidence of 22 knife wounds inflicted to the head, neck, chest, and pelvic region.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 89</ref> Further wounds found on the skull suggested the killer had attacked Biryuk from behind with the handle and blade of his knife. In addition, several striations were discovered upon Biryuk's [[Orbit (anatomy)|eye sockets]].\n\nFollowing Biryuk's murder, Chikatilo no longer attempted to resist his homicidal urges: between July and September 1982, he killed a further five victims between the ages of nine and 18. He established a pattern of approaching children, runaways, and young vagrants at bus or railway stations, enticing them to a nearby forest or other secluded area, and killing them, usually by stabbing, slashing and [[Disembowelment|eviscerating]] the victim with a knife; although some victims, in addition to receiving a multitude of knife wounds, were also strangled or battered to death.<ref>''Real Life Crimes'', issue 7, p. 150</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Murder and Violent Crime|last=Hickey|first=Eric|date=2003|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=|isbn=076192437X|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=70}}</ref>\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0418\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|165px|Memorial to Chikatilo's seventh victim, [[#Karabelnikova|Irina Karabelnikova]].

[[Forensic pathology|Pathologists]] concluded these injuries had been caused by a knife, leading investigators to the conclusion the killer had gouged out the eyes of his victims.<ref name=\"The Killer Department p. 30\">''The Killer Department'' p. 30</ref> Chikatilo's adult female victims were often [[prostitute]]s or homeless women whom he would lure to secluded areas with promises of alcohol or money. Chikatilo would typically attempt intercourse with these victims, but he would usually be unable to achieve or maintain an erection; this would send him into a murderous fury, particularly if the woman mocked his impotence. He would achieve orgasm only when he stabbed and slashed the victim to death. His child and adolescent victims were of both sexes; Chikatilo would lure these victims to secluded areas using a variety of ruses, usually formed in the initial conversation with the victim,<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 178</ref> such as promising them assistance or company, or offering to show them a shortcut,<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 98</ref> a chance to view rare stamps, films or coins, or with an offer of food or candy. He would usually overpower these victims once they were alone, often tying their hands behind their backs with a length of rope before stuffing mud or [[loam]] into the victims' mouth to silence their screams, and then proceed to kill them.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 202\">''The Killer Department'', p. 202</ref> After the killing, Chikatilo would make rudimentary\u2014though seldom serious\u2014efforts to conceal the body<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 146</ref> before leaving the crime scene.\n\nOn 11 December 1982 Chikatilo encountered a 10-year-old girl named Olga Stalmachenok riding a bus to her parents' home in Novoshakhtinsk and persuaded the child to leave the bus with him. She was last seen by a fellow passenger, who reported that a middle-aged man had led the girl away firmly by the hand.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 65</ref> Chikatilo lured the girl to a cornfield on the outskirts of Novoshakhtinsk, stabbed her in excess of 50 times around the head and body, ripped open her chest and excised her lower bowel and [[uterus]].<ref name=\"The Killer Department p. 30\"/>\n\n===Investigation===\nBy January 1983, four victims thus far killed had been tentatively linked to the same killer.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 24</ref> A [[Moscow]] police team, headed by Major Mikhail Fetisov, was sent to Rostov-on-Don to direct the investigation, which gradually became known among investigators as ''Operation Forest Path''.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 61</ref> Fetisov established a team of 10 investigators, based in Rostov, charged with solving all four cases. In March, Fetisov assigned a newly appointed specialist [[forensic science|forensic analyst]], Viktor Burakov, to head the investigation. The following month, Olga Stalmachenok's body was found. Burakov was summoned to the crime scene, where he examined the numerous knife wounds and eviscerations conducted upon the child, and the striations on her eye sockets. Burakov later stated that, as he noted the striations upon Stalmachenok's eye sockets, any doubts about the presence of a serial killer evaporated.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 30</ref>\n\nChikatilo did not kill again until June 1983, when he murdered a 15-year-old [[Armenians|Armenian]] girl named Laura Sarkisyan; her body was found close to an unmarked railway platform near Shakhty.<ref name=\"Comrade Chikatilo, p. 92\">''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 92</ref> By September, he had killed a further five victims.

While walking with the boy, Chikatilo was seen by several witnesses who were able to give investigators a detailed description of the killer. When Ptashnikov's body was found three days later, police also found a footprint of the killer and both semen and [[saliva]] samples on the victim's clothing.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/crime-files/andre-chikatilo-the-rostov-ripper# |title=''Andrei Chikatilo: The Rostov Ripper Crime Files'' |access-date=12 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519080735/http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/crime-files/andre-chikatilo-the-rostov-ripper# |archive-date=19 May 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 May, Chikatilo killed a young woman named Tatyana Petrosyan and her 10-year-old daughter, Svetlana, in a wooded area outside Shakhty; Petrosyan had known Chikatilo for several years prior to her murder.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', pp. 85\u201387</ref> By the end of July, he had killed three additional young women between the ages of 19 and 21, and a 13-year-old boy. In the summer of 1984, Chikatilo was fired from his work as a supply clerk for the theft of a roll of linoleum. The accusation had been filed against him the previous February, and he had been asked to resign quietly but had refused to do so, as he had denied the charges.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 79</ref> Chikatilo found another job as a supply clerk in Rostov on 1 August.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 254\"/>\n[[File:Natalya Golosovskaya.jpg|140px|right|thumb|Natalya Golosovskaya, aged 16. Murdered 2 August 1984]]\nOn 2 August, Chikatilo killed a 16-year-old girl, Natalya Golosovskaya, in Aviators' Park. On 7 August, he lured a 17-year-old girl, Lyudmila Alekseyeva, to the banks of the Don River on the pretense of showing her a shortcut to a bus terminal. Alekseyeva suffered 39 slash wounds to her body before Chikatilo mutilated and disemboweled her: intentionally inflicting wounds he knew would not be immediately fatal.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 94</ref> Her body was found in the following morning, her excised upper lip inside her mouth.<ref name=\"Comrade Chikatilo, p. 200\">''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 200</ref> Hours after Alekseyeva's murder, Chikatilo flew to the [[Uzbek SSR|Uzbekistan]] capital of [[Tashkent]] on a business trip. By the time he had returned to Rostov on 15 August, he had killed an unidentified young woman and a 10-year-old girl.<ref name=\"Comrade Chikatilo, p. 200\"/> Within two weeks, an 11-year-old boy named Aleksandr Chepel had been found on the banks of the Don River, strangled and castrated, with his eyes gouged out, just yards from where Alexeyeva's body had earlier been found.<ref name=\"Comrade Chikatilo, p. 200\"/> Chikatilo then killed a young librarian, Irina Luchinskaya, in Aviators' Park on 6 September.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 101\">''The Red Ripper'', p. 101</ref>\n\n==First arrest and release==\nOn 13 September 1984, Chikatilo was observed by two undercover detectives attempting to talk to young women at the Rostov bus station. The detectives followed him as he wandered through the city, trying to approach women and committing acts of [[frotteurism]] in public places.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 1</ref> Upon Chikatilo's arrival at the city's central market he was arrested and held. A search of his belongings revealed a knife with an eight-inch blade, several lengths of rope, and a jar of [[Vaseline]].<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 8</ref> He was also discovered to be under investigation for minor theft at one of his former employers, which gave the investigators the legal right to hold him for a prolonged period of time. Chikatilo's dubious background was uncovered, and his physical description matched the description of the man seen walking alongside Dmitry Ptashnikov prior to the boy's murder. A sample of Chikatilo's blood was taken; the results of which revealed his [[ABO blood group system|blood group]] to be type A,<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 87</ref> whereas semen samples found upon a total of six victims murdered by the unknown killer throughout the spring and summer of 1984<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 78\"/> had been classified by medical examiners to be type AB. Chikatilo's name was added to the card index file used by investigators, however, the results of his blood type analysis largely discounted him as being the unknown killer.{{refn|group=n|By Chikatilo's arrest, this index file had expanded to include over 25,000 individuals investigated in connection with the murders.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 100</ref>}}\n\nChikatilo was found guilty of theft of property from his previous employer<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 118\">''The Red Ripper'', p. 118</ref> and sentenced to one year in prison but was freed on 12 December 1984 after serving three months.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 118\"/>\n\nOn 8 October 1984 the head of the Russian Public Prosecutors Office formally linked 23 of Chikatilo's murders into one case and dropped all charges against the mentally handicapped youths who had previously confessed to the murders.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', pp. 112\u201313</ref>\n\n===Later murders===\nUpon his release from prison in December 1984, Chikatilo found new work at a locomotive factory in Novocherkassk and kept a low profile. He did not kill again until 1 August 1985<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 216</ref> when, on a business trip to Moscow, he encountered an 18-year-old woman, named Natalia Pokhlistova, at a railway platform near [[Domodedovo Airport]]. Pokhlistova was lured into a thicket of woods where she was bound, stabbed 38 times, then strangled to death.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 218</ref> Based upon the hypothesis that the killer had travelled from the [[Rostov Oblast]] to Moscow via air, investigators checked all [[Aeroflot]] flight records of passengers who had commuted between Moscow and the Rostov Oblast between late July and early August. On this occasion, however, Chikatilo had travelled to Moscow by train and, accordingly, no documentation existed for investigators to research. Four weeks later, on 27 August, Chikatilo killed another young woman, Irina Gulyaeva, in Shakhty. As had been the case with Pokhlistova, the wounds inflicted upon the victim linked her murder to the hunt for the serial killer.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 111</ref>\n\nIn November 1985, a special procurator, [[Issa Kostoyev]], was appointed to supervise the investigation, which had by this stage expanded to include 15 procurators and 29 detectives assigned to work exclusively upon the manhunt.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 120</ref> The known murders linked to the manhunt were carefully re-investigated, and police began another round of questioning of known sex offenders and homosexuals. The following month, the [[militsiya]] resumed the patrolling of railway stations around Rostov, and [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plain clothed]] female officers were ordered to loiter around bus and train stations. At the request of Viktor Burakov, police also took the step of consulting a [[psychiatrist]], Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, the first such consultation in a serial killer investigation in the Soviet Union. All crime scene and medical examiner's reports were made available to Bukhanovsky, upon the understanding he would produce a [[offender profiling|psychological profile]] of the unknown murderer for investigators.<ref>''The Killer Department''pp. 125\u2013126</ref>\n\nBukhanovsky's 65-page psychological profile described the killer as a reclusive man aged between 45 and 50 years old who had endured a painful and isolated childhood, and who was incapable of flirting or courtship with women. This individual was of average intelligence, likely to be married and to have fathered children, but also a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadist]] who suffered from impotence and could achieve sexual arousal only by seeing his victims suffer. The murders themselves were an analogue to the sexual intercourse this individual was incapable of performing, and his knife became a substitute for a penis which failed to function normally.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 127</ref> Because many of the killings had occurred on weekdays near mass transport hubs and across the entire Rostov Oblast, Bukhanovsky also argued that the killer's work required him to travel regularly, and based upon the actual days of the week when the killings had occurred, the killer was most likely tied to a production schedule.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 129</ref>\n\nChikatilo followed the investigation carefully, reading newspaper reports about the manhunt for the killer which had begun to appear in the news media,<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 233</ref> and keeping his homicidal urges under control. For almost a year following the August 1985 murder of Irina Gulyaeva, no further victims were found in either the Rostov or [[Moscow Oblast]]s whose bodies bore the signature mutilations of the unknown murderer. Investigators did tentatively link the murder of a 33-year-old woman named Lyubov Golovakha\u2014found stabbed to death in the [[Myasnikovsky District]] of Rostov on 23 July 1986\u2014to the investigation, although this was solely upon the basis that the killer's semen type matched that of the killer they were seeking, that the victim had been stripped naked prior to her murder, and that she had been stabbed in excess of 20 times.<ref name=\":2\" /> The victim had not been [[dismemberment|dismembered]] or otherwise mutilated, nor had she been seen near mass transportation. Because of these discrepancies, many investigators expressed serious doubts as to whether Golovakha's murder had been committed by the killer they were seeking.\n\nOn 18 August 1986 a victim was found buried in a depression of earth in the grounds of a collective farm in the city of [[Bataysk]]. The wounds inflicted on this victim bore the trademark mutilations of victims linked to the manhunt killed between 1982 and 1985. The victim was an 18-year-old secretary named Irina Pogoryelova. Pogoryelova's body bore all the trademark mutilations of the previous victims: her body had been slit open from the neck to the genitalia, with one breast removed and her eyes cut out. As the murderer had made serious efforts to bury the body,<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 136</ref> some investigators theorized that this explained the sudden dearth in the number of victims found.\n\nBy the autumn of 1986, investigators in Rostov theorized that the unknown killer may have moved to another part of the Soviet Union and continued killing there. As the three victims killed in the Rostov Oblast in 1985 and 1986 had died in August, some investigators gave credence to the possibility the perpetrator may have relocated to another part of the Soviet Union, and may only be returning to the Rostov Oblast in summer. The Rostov police compiled bulletins to be sent to all forces throughout the Soviet Union, describing the pattern of wounds their unknown killer inflicted upon his victims and requesting feedback from any police force who had discovered murder victims with wounds matching those upon the victims found in the Rostov Oblast. The response was negative.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 115</ref>{{refn|group=n|Uzbekistan investigators did not link the two murders committed by Chikatilo in Tashkent to the series because in one instance, the victim had been beheaded,<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 95\">''The Red Ripper'', p. 95</ref> and in the second instance, the mutilations upon the victim had been so extensive police had concluded the body had been caught in a [[mechanised agriculture|harvesting machine]].<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 225</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1290&dat=19921015&id=jeg0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=wYwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3807,7156775&hl=en/|title=Caged Russian Grandfather Guilty of 52 Grisly Murders|newspaper=The News|date=15 October 1992|access-date=18 July 2016}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1987 Chikatilo killed three times. On each occasion the murder took place while he was on a business trip far away from the Rostov Oblast, and none of these murders were linked to the manhunt in Rostov.<ref>''The Red Ripper'' p. 133</ref> Chikatilo's first murder in 1987 was committed on 16 May, when he encountered a 12-year-old boy, named Oleg Makarenkov, at a train station in the Urals town of [[Revda, Sverdlovsk Oblast|Revda]]. Makarenkov was lured from the station with the promise of sharing a meal with Chikatilo at his [[dacha]]; he was murdered in woodland close to the station, although his body would remain undiscovered until 1991.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 212</ref> In July, he killed a 12-year-old boy, named Ivan Bilovetsky, in the Ukrainian city of [[Zaporizhia]], and on 15 September, he killed a 16-year-old vocational school student, named Yuri Tereshonok, in woodland on the outskirts of [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]].<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 221</ref>\n\n===Definitive resurfacing===\nIn 1988 Chikatilo killed three times, murdering an unidentified woman in [[Krasny Sulin]] in April and two boys in May and July. His first murder victim was lured off a train at Krasny Sulin before Chikatilo bound her hands behind her back and stuffed her mouth with dirt, before severing her nose from her face<ref>''Hunting The Devil'' p. 153</ref> and inflicting numerous knife wounds to her neck. Chikatilo then bludgeoned her to death with a slab of concrete; her body was found on 6 April. Investigators noted that the knife wounds inflicted upon this victim were similar to those inflicted on the victims linked to the manhunt and killed between 1982 and 1985, but as the woman had been killed with a slab of concrete and had not been disemboweled, investigators were unsure whether to link this murder to the investigation.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 146\">''The Killer Department'', p. 146</ref> In May, Chikatilo killed a 9-year-old boy, named Aleksey Voronko, in [[Ilovaisk]], Ukraine. The boy's wounds left no doubt the killer had struck again, and this murder was linked to the manhunt.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, pp. 256\u201357\">''The Red Ripper'', pp. 256\u201357</ref> On 14 July, Chikatilo killed 15-year-old Yevgeny Muratov at Donleskhoz station near Shakhty. Muratov's murder was also linked to the investigation, although his body was not found until April 1989. Although his remains were largely skeletal, Muratov's autopsy revealed he had been emasculated, and suffered at least 30 knife wounds.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 152\">''The Killer Department'', p. 152</ref>\n[[File:Aleksey Khobotov.jpg|right|125px|thumb|Aleksey Khobotov, aged 10. Murdered 28 August 1989]]\nChikatilo did not kill again until 1 March 1989, when he killed a 16-year-old girl in his daughter's vacant apartment. He dismembered her body and hid the remains in a sewer. As the victim had been dismembered, police did not link her murder to the investigation. Between May and August, Chikatilo killed a further four victims, three of whom were killed in Rostov and Shakhty,<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, pp. 256\u201357\"/> although only two of these victims were linked to the killer. With the resurfacing of victims definitively linked to the manhunt and the fact the majority of these victims' bodies had been discovered close to railway stations, investigators assigned numerous plain clothed officers to discreetly film and photograph passengers on trains throughout the Rostov Oblast. Several trains were also fitted with hidden cameras with the intention of filming or photographing a victim in the company of his or her murderer.<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 163</ref>\n\nOn 14 January 1990 Chikatilo encountered 11-year-old Andrei Kravchenko standing outside a Shakhty theater. Kravchenko was lured from the theater on the pretext of being shown imported [[Western world|Western]] films Chikatilo claimed to have at his residence; his extensively stabbed, emasculated body was found in a secluded section of woodland the following month.<ref>''The Red Ripper'' p. 165</ref> Seven weeks after Kravchenko's murder, on 7 March, Chikatilo lured a 10-year-old boy, named Yaroslav Makarov, from a Rostov train station to Rostov's Botanical Gardens. His eviscerated body was found the following day.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 257\">''The Red Ripper'', p. 257</ref>\n\nOn 11 March, the leaders of the investigation, headed by Mikhail Fetisov, held a meeting to discuss progress made in the manhunt.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 159</ref> Fetisov was under intense pressure from the public, the press, and the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)#Russian Federation|Ministry of the Interior]] in Moscow to solve the case. The intensity of the manhunt in the years up to 1984 had receded to a degree between 1985 and 1987, when Chikatilo had committed only three murders investigators had conclusively linked to the killer\u2014all killed by 1986. However, by March 1990, a further six victims had been linked to the killer. In addition, following the introduction of greater media freedom as a result of [[Glasnost#Glasnost and Gorbachev|glasnost]], the Soviet news media was much less repressed than it had been in the early years of the manhunt and as such, devoted extensive publicity to the case. Fetisov had also noted laxity in some areas of the investigation and warned that people would be fired if the killer was not caught soon.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', pp. 158\u201359</ref>\n\nChikatilo had killed three further victims by August 1990: on 4 April, he lured a 31-year-old woman, named Lyubov Zuyeva, off a train and killed her in woodland near Donleskhoz station. Her body was not found until 24 August.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', pp. 165-166</ref> On 28 July, he lured a 13-year-old boy, named Viktor Petrov, away from a Rostov railway station and killed him in Rostov's Botanical Gardens;<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 167</ref> and on 14 August, he killed an 11-year-old boy, named Ivan Fomin, in the reeds near Novocherkassk beach.<ref>''Hunting The Devil'' p. 187</ref>\n\n==Snare==\nThe discovery of more victims sparked a massive police operation. Because several victims' bodies had been discovered at railway stations on one rail route through the Rostov Oblast,<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 164</ref> Viktor Burakov suggested a plan to saturate all larger stations in the Rostov Oblast with an obvious uniformed police presence which the killer could not fail to notice. The intention was to discourage the killer from attempting to strike at any of these locations, and to have undercover agents patrol smaller and less busy stations, where the murderer's activities would be more likely to be noticed. The plan was approved, and both the uniformed and undercover officers were instructed to question any adult man in the company of a young woman or child, and note his name and passport number.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 187\">''The Red Ripper'', p. 187</ref> Police deployed 360 men at all the stations in the Rostov Oblast, but only undercover officers were posted at the three smallest stations on the route through the oblast where the killer had struck most frequently\u2014Kirpichnaya, Donleskhoz, and Lesostep<ref>''The Killer Department'', pp. 163\u201365</ref>\u2014in an effort to force the killer to strike at one of those three stations. The operation was implemented on 27 October 1990.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Joe|last=Treen|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20108852,00.html|title=A Monster Caged at Last|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=19 October 1992|accessdate=25 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915012342/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20108852,00.html#|archive-date=15 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 October, police found the body of a 16-year-old boy, named Vadim Gromov, at Donleskhoz station. The wounds upon Gromov's body immediately linked his murder to the manhunt: the youth had been strangled, stabbed 27 times and castrated, with the tip of his tongue severed and his left eye stabbed.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 165\">''The Killer Department'', p. 165</ref> Gromov had been killed on 17 October; 10 days before the start of the initiative. The same day Gromov's body was found, Chikatilo lured another 16-year-old boy, Viktor Tishchenko, off a train at Kirpichnaya station, another station under surveillance from undercover police, and killed him in a nearby forest.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 166</ref> Tishchenko's body\u2014bearing 40 separate knife wounds\u2014was found on 3 November.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 242</ref>\n\n===Final murder and surveillance===\nOn 6 November 1990, Chikatilo killed and mutilated a 22-year-old woman, named Svetlana Korostik, in woodland near Donleskhoz station.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 169</ref> Returning to the railway platform, he was observed by an undercover officer named Igor Rybakov,<ref name=\"The Killer Department p. 171\">''The Killer Department'' p. 171</ref> who observed Chikatilo approach a well and wash his hands and face.<ref name=\"The Killer Department p. 171\"/> When he approached the station, Rybakov also noted that Chikatilo's coat had grass and soil stains on the elbows. Chikatilo also had a small red smear on his cheek and what appeared to be a severe wound on one of his fingers.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 186</ref> To Rybakov, he looked suspicious. The only reason people entered woodland near Donleskhoz station at that time of year was to gather wild mushrooms (a popular pastime in Russia), but Chikatilo was not dressed like a typical forest scavenger; he was wearing more formal attire. Moreover, he had a nylon sports bag, which was unsuitable for carrying mushrooms.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 243</ref> Rybakov stopped Chikatilo and checked his papers, but had no formal reason to arrest him.<ref name=\"The Killer Department p. 171\"/> When Rybakov returned to his office, he filed a routine report, containing the name of the person he had stopped at the station, and the possible blood smear observed upon his cheek.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 187\"/>\n\nOn 13 November, Korostik's body was found; she was the 36th known victim linked to the manhunt. Police summoned the officer in charge of surveillance at Donleskhoz station, and examined the reports of all men stopped and questioned in the previous week.<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 170</ref> Not only was Chikatilo's name among those reports, but it was familiar to several officers involved in the case, because he had been questioned in 1984 and had been placed upon a 1987 suspect list compiled and distributed throughout the Soviet Union.<ref>''The Killer Department'' pp. 170\u201371</ref> After checking with Chikatilo's present and previous employers, investigators were able to place him in various towns and cities at times when several victims linked to the investigation had been murdered.<ref name=\":3\"/> Questioning of former colleagues from Chikatilo's teaching days revealed that he had been forced to resign from two teaching positions due to repeated complaints of lewd behaviour and sexual assault made by his pupils.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 172</ref>\n\nPolice placed Chikatilo under surveillance on 14 November. In several instances, particularly on trains or buses, he was observed approaching lone young women or children, and engaging them in conversation. If the woman or child broke off the conversation, Chikatilo would wait a few minutes and then seek another conversation partner.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 192</ref> On 20 November, after six days of surveillance, Chikatilo left his house with a large jar, which he had filled with beer at a small kiosk in a local park<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 175</ref> before he wandered around Novocherkassk, attempting to make contact with children he met on his way. Upon exiting a cafe, Chikatilo was arrested by four plainclothes police officers.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 193</ref>\n\n==Second arrest==\nUpon his arrest, Chikatilo gave a statement claiming that the police were mistaken, and complained that he had also been arrested in 1984 for the same series of murders.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 181</ref> A strip-search of the suspect revealed a further piece of evidence: one of Chikatilo's fingers had a flesh wound. Medical examiners concluded the wound was from a human bite. Chikatilo's penultimate victim, Viktor Tishchenko, was a physically strong youth. At the crime scene, the police had found numerous signs of a ferocious physical struggle between the victim and his murderer. Although a finger bone was later found to be broken, and his fingernail had been bitten off, Chikatilo had never sought medical treatment for his injuries.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 177</ref>\n\nA search of Chikatilo's belongings revealed he had been in possession of a folding knife and two lengths of rope. A sample of Chikatilo's blood was taken,<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 198</ref> and he was placed in a cell inside the KGB headquarters in Rostov with a police informer, who was instructed to engage Chikatilo in conversation and elicit any information he could from him.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 179</ref> The next day, 21 November, formal questioning of Chikatilo began. The interrogation was performed by Issa Kostoyev. The strategy chosen by the police to elicit a confession was to lead Chikatilo to believe that he was a very sick individual in need of medical help. The intention was to give Chikatilo hope that if he confessed, he would not be prosecuted by [[insanity plea|reason of insanity]]. Police knew their case against Chikatilo was largely [[circumstantial evidence|circumstantial]], and under Soviet law, they had 10 days in which they could legally hold a suspect before either charging or releasing him.\n\n===Blood group analysis===\nOn 21 November, the results of Chikatilo's blood test again revealed his blood type to be type A and not type AB. Due to the amount of physical and circumstantial evidence investigators had thus far compiled, which indicated Chikatilo was indeed the murderer they had been pursuing, plus the fact that investigators had deduced the blood type of the murderer they had pursued using semen samples obtained from the clothing and bodies of 14 of the victims as opposed to actual blood samples, investigators obtained a sample of Chikatilo's semen to test his blood type, the results of which confirmed that Chikatilo's semen was type AB, whereas his blood and saliva were type A.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 190\">''The Killer Department'', p. 190</ref>{{refn|group=n|Investigators had received a circular in 1988 indicating that in extremely rare cases, a man's blood type may differ from his semen and saliva type.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 149-150</ref>}}\n\nThroughout the questioning, Chikatilo repeatedly denied that he had committed the murders, although he did confess to molesting his pupils during his career as a teacher.<ref>''The Killer Department'', pp. 187\u201388</ref> He also produced several written essays for Kostoyev which, although evasive regarding the actual murders, did reveal psychological symptoms consistent with those predicted by Dr. Bukhanovsky in the 1985 psychological profile he had written for the investigators. The interrogation tactics used by Kostoyev may also have caused Chikatilo to become defensive; the informer sharing a KGB cell with the suspect reported to police that Chikatilo had informed him that Kostoyev had repeatedly asked him direct questions regarding the mutilations inflicted upon the victims.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 190\"/>\n\n==Confession==\nOn 29 November, at the request of Burakov and Fetisov, Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky was invited to assist in the questioning of the suspect. Bukhanovsky read extracts from his 65-page psychological profile to Chikatilo.<ref>''The Killer Department'', pp. 193\u201396</ref> Within two hours, Chikatilo burst into tears<ref name=\"The Killer Department p. 268\">''The Killer Department'' p. 268</ref> and confessed to Bukhanovsky that he was indeed guilty of the crimes for which he had been arrested. After conversing into the evening, Bukhanovsky reported to Burakov and Fetisov that Chikatilo was ready to confess.<ref>{{cite news|first=James|last=Kent|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/aug/08/life1.lifemagazine|title=Darkness Visible|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=8 August 1999|accessdate=25 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826013420/https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/aug/08/life1.lifemagazine#|archive-date=26 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>{{refn|group=n|In 1993, Chikatilo would recount his initial encounter with Dr. Bukhanovsky by stating: \"He already knew me ... and when he recounted everything about my life\u2014how people had humiliated me, shot at me and trampled on me from infancy\u2014well, it was bitter of course.

According to the official protocol, Chikatilo confessed to 34 of the 36 murders police had linked to him, although he denied two additional murders committed in 1986 the police had initially believed he had committed: one of whom was Lyubov Golovakha,<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 135</ref> found stabbed to death on 23 July 1986 and whom investigators had had serious doubts about linking to the manhunt; the second was 18-year-old Irina Pogoryelova, found murdered in Bataysk on 18 August 1986 and whose mutilations closely matched those inflicted upon other victims linked to the manhunt.{{refn|group=n|Chikatilo would later specifically state in an outburst at his subsequent trial that he had indeed killed Pogoryelova, whom he referred to by name in this outburst.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 243\">''The Killer Department'', p. 243</ref>}}\n\nChikatilo gave a full, detailed description of each murder on the list of charges, all of which were consistent with known facts regarding each killing. When prompted, he could draw a rough sketch of various crime scenes, indicating the position of the victim's body and various [[landmark]]s in the vicinity of the crime scene. Additional details provided further proof of his guilt: one victim on the list of charges was a 19-year-old student named Anna Lemesheva, whom Chikatilo had killed on 19 July 1984 near Shakhty station. Chikatilo recalled that as he had fought to overpower her, she had stated that a man named \"[[wikt:\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0441#Russian|Bars]]\" (\"Leopard\") would retaliate for his attacking her.

In many instances, particularly (though not exclusively) with his male victims, Chikatilo stated he would bind the victims' hands behind their back with a length of rope before he would proceed to kill them.

Chikatilo recalled that he had killed Volobuyeva in a millet field, and that he had approached the girl as she sat in the waiting rooms at Krasnodar Airport. Volobuyeva, Chikatilo stated, had informed him she lived in the Siberian city of [[Novokuznetsk]], and was awaiting a connecting flight at the airport to visit relatives.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 187</ref>\n\nIn December 1990, Chikatilo led police to the body of Aleksey Khobotov,<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 204</ref> a boy he had confessed to killing in August 1989 and whom he had buried in woodland near a Shakhty cemetery, proving unequivocally that he was the killer.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 205\"/> He later led investigators to the bodies of two other victims he had confessed to killing. Three of the 56 victims Chikatilo confessed to killing could not be found or identified, but Chikatilo was charged with killing 53 women and children between 1978 and 1990.

Chikatilo was analysed by a senior psychiatrist, Dr. Andrei Tkachenko. Tkachenko did note Chikatilo suffered from various [[physiology|physiological]] problems which he attributed to prenatal brain damage,<ref name=SJG>{{cite book|first=S.J.|last=Giannangelo|title=Real-life Monsters: A Psychological Examination of the Serial Murderer|date=2012|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group|Praeger Publishing Group]]|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=978-0-31-339784-4|page=74}}</ref> but concluded on 18 October that, although suffering from [[borderline personality disorder]] with [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] features, he was fit to stand trial.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 224</ref> In December 1991, details of Chikatilo's arrest and a brief summary of his crimes were released to the newly corporate Russian media by police.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 235</ref>\n[[File:Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo Trial 1992.jpg|right|140px|thumb|Chikatilo, pictured at his trial in April 1992.]]\n\n==Trial==\nAndrei Chikatilo was brought to trial in Rostov on 14 April 1992, charged with 53 counts of murder in addition to five charges of sexual assault against minors committed when he had been a teacher.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 229</ref> He was tried in Courtroom Number 5 of the Rostov Provincial Court, before Judge Leonid Akubzhanov.<ref>''Cannibalism: The Last Taboo'', p. 243</ref>\n\nChikatilo's trial was the first major media event of liberalized post-Soviet Russia. Shortly after his psychiatric evaluation at the Serbsky Institute, investigators had conducted a press conference in which a full list of Chikatilo's crimes was released to the press, alongside a 1984 [[Facial composite|identikit]] of the individual charged, but not the full name or a photograph of the accused. The media first saw Chikatilo on the first day of his trial, as he entered an iron cage specifically constructed in a corner of the courtroom to protect him from attack by the enraged and often hysterical relatives of his victims. In the opening weeks of Chikatilo's trial, the Russian press regularly published [[exaggeration|exaggerated]] and often sensationalistic headlines about the murders, referring to Chikatilo being a \"cannibal\" or a \"maniac\" and to his physically resembling a shaven-skulled, demonic individual.{{refn|group=n|As a standard prison procedure to prevent the spread of lice, Chikatilo's head had been shaved.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 230</ref>}}\n\nThe first two days of the trial were devoted to Judge Akubzhanov reading the long lists of [[indictment]]s against Chikatilo. Each murder was discussed individually, and on several occasions, relatives present in the courtroom broke down in tears or fainted when details of their relatives' murder were revealed.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 231</ref> After reading the indictment, Judge Akubzhanov announced to the journalists present in the courtroom his intention to conduct an [[public trial|open trial]], stating: \"Let this trial at least teach us something, so that this will never happen anytime or anywhere again.\"<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 268</ref> Judge Akubzhanov then asked Chikatilo to stand, identify himself and provide his date and location of birth. Chikatilo complied, although this would prove to be one of the few civil exchanges between the judge and Chikatilo.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 238</ref>\n\nChikatilo was initially questioned in detail about each charge upon the indictment. Responding to specific questions regarding the murders, he often gave dismissive replies to questions, particularly when questioned as to the specific nature of the wounds he had inflicted upon his victims and the ruses he had used to entice his victims to the locations where he had killed them. He would become indignant only when accused of stealing personal possessions from the victims, or to his retaining organs excised from the victims missing from the crime scenes. On one occasion, when asked as to his seeming indifference as to the lifestyle and gender of those whom he had killed, Chikatilo replied: \"I did not need to look for them. Every step I took, they were there.\"<ref>''The Red Ripper'', pp. 230\u2013231</ref>{{refn|group=n|In a 1993 interview granted to a ''[[Newsweek]]'' reporter who had been based in the Soviet Union, Chikatilo would expound on this statement by claiming: \"It was all a matter of chance. Of who was riding or walking near me. Or at the station.\"<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 269</ref>}}\n\nIn what became a regular (though not continuous) occurrence throughout the trial, Judge Akubzhanov berated Chikatilo as he questioned him in detail as to the charges; ordering him to \"shut your mouth\", before adding, \"You're not crazy!\" as Chikatilo's responses to questions deviated into his discussing issues such as the repression his family had endured throughout his childhood, and his claiming that the charges filed against him were false. These verbal exchanges would occur whether Chikatilo was cooperative or uncooperative throughout proceedings, and the manner in which the judge questioned Chikatilo repeatedly led Chikatilo's defence lawyer, Marat Khabibulin, to protest against the accusatory nature of the court proceedings. In the instances in which Chikatilo was uncooperative throughout questioning, he would simply shout over the judge, denounce the court as a [[farce]], and launch into rambling, disjointed speeches. On occasion, Chikatilo would also [[Indecent exposure|expose himself]] to the court, or sing [[socialism|socialist]] movement anthems throughout proceedings. These antics regularly resulted in his being returned to his cell as court proceedings continued in his absence.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 277</ref>\n\nOn 21 April, Chikatilo's defence lawyer requested that Dr. Bukhanovsky be allowed to testify as to the contents of the 1985 psychological profile he had written, and his subsequent consultations with Chikatilo following his arrest, adding that Bukhanovsky could exert influence over Chikatilo and, by extension, might influence the court proceedings.<ref name=\"Comrade Chikatilo, p. 271\">''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 271</ref> This request was denied. The same day, Chikatilo began to refuse to answer any questions from the judge, the prosecutor or his own defence lawyer.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 234</ref> He refused to answer any questions for three consecutive days<ref name=\"Comrade Chikatilo, p. 271\"/> before stating his presumption of innocence had been irredeemably violated by the judge and that he intended to give no further testimony.<ref>''Hunting The Devil'' p. 264</ref> The following day, proceedings were [[Adjournment|adjourned]] for two weeks.\n\nChikatilo withdrew his confessions to six of the killings for which he had been charged on 13 May,<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 243\"/> and also claimed he had killed four further victims who were not included upon the indictment. The same day, his defence lawyer again submitted a request that his client be subjected to a second psychiatric evaluation. This motion was dismissed by the judge as being groundless. In response, Khabibulin rose from his seat, condemning the composition of the court, and arguing that the judge was unfit to continue presiding over the case. Chikatilo himself repeated his earlier remarks as to the judge making numerous rash remarks prejudging his guilt. The prosecutor, Nikolai Gerasimenko, vocally supported the defence's claim, stating that the judge had indeed made too many such comments and had committed numerous procedural violations in his lecturing and insulting the defendant.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 236</ref> Gerasimenko further contended that in his conducting an open trial, Chikatilo had already been effectively prejudged as being guilty by the press,<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 273</ref> before also requesting that the judge be replaced.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 274</ref>{{refn|group=n|Judge Akubzhanov would later rule that the prosecutor be replaced instead, briefly conducting the trial in the absence of a prosecutor until a replacement prosecutor, Anatoly Zadorozhny, could be found.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 239</ref>}}\n\nOn 3 July, Bukhanovsky was permitted to testify as to his analysis of Chikatilo, although solely in the [[capacity (law)|capacity]] as a witness. For three hours, Bukhanovsky testified as to his 1985 psychological profile of Chikatilo, and of the conversations he had held with Chikatilo following his arrest, which had culminated in Chikatilo's confession. Four psychiatric experts from the Serbsky Institute also testified as to the results of a [[Behaviorism|behavioral analysis]] they had conducted on Chikatilo in May, following the initial adjournment of the trial. All testified as to his behaviour in the courtroom being strikingly at contrast to his behaviour in his cell, and that they considered his antics to be a calculated attempt to obtain acquittal on the grounds of insanity.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', pp. 240-241</ref>\n\n===Closing arguments and conviction===\nOn 9 August, the defence delivered their [[closing argument]]s before the judge. Upon beginning his 90-minute closing argument, Marat Khabibulin first stated he had no confidence his voice would be heard above the \"general outcry\" for retribution against Chikatilo, before questioning the reliability of the forensic evidence presented at the trial, and describing areas of Chikatilo's confessions as being \"baseless\". Khabibulin also questioned the judge's [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], and harked back to the decision of the court not to allow the defence to present testimony from independent psychiatrists; emphasizing that crimes of this nature could not have been committed by an individual of sane mind. Khabibulin then formally requested the judge find his client not guilty.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 246</ref>\n\nThe following day, prosecutor Anatoly Zadorozhny delivered his closing argument before the judge. Harking towards the earlier testimony of psychiatrists at the trial, Zadorozhny argued that Chikatilo fully understood the criminality of his actions, was able to resist his homicidal impulses, and had made numerous conscious efforts to avoid detection. Moreover, Zadorozhny emphasized that in 19 of the charges, the material evidence of the crimes had been provided by Chikatilo himself. Zadorozhny then recited each of the charges before formally requesting the death penalty.{{refn|group=n|Chikatilo was not present in the courtroom throughout the prosecutor's closing argument, having again interrupted court proceedings.}}\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the prosecutor's closing argument, Judge Akubzhanov invited Chikatilo back into the courtroom, before formally asking him whether he would like to make a final statement on his own behalf. In response, Chikatilo simply sat mute.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 241\">''The Red Ripper'', p. 241</ref> Judge Akubzhanov then announced an initial date of 15 September for himself and the two official jurors to review the evidence and pass [[Sentence (law)|final sentence]] upon Chikatilo.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 242</ref> (This date was later postponed until 14 October.)<ref>''The Killer Department'', pp. 245\u201346</ref> As court announced recess, the brother of Lyudmila Alekseyeva, a 17-year-old girl killed by Chikatilo in August 1984, threw a heavy chunk of metal at Chikatilo, hitting him in the chest.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 241\"/> When security tried to arrest the young man, other victims' relatives shielded him.<ref>Murder in Mind issue 7 p. 36</ref>\n\nOn 14 October, the court reconvened to hear formal sentencing (this sentencing would not finish until the following day).

Akubzhanov also rejected the numerous claims Kostoyev had made to the media in the months prior to the trial that police had deliberately withheld documents pertaining to Chikatilo from the prosecutor's department as being provably baseless, adding that proof existed he had been in possession of all internal bulletins.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 247</ref>{{refn|group=n|Akubzhanov would subsequently write to both the Public Prosecutor of Russia and the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)#Russian Federation|Ministry of the Interior]], urging both bodies to adopt sufficient measures in order to prevent a repetition of such negligence and incompetence by the prosecutor's department.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', pp. 246-247</ref>}}\n\nOn 15 October, Judge Akubzhanov formally sentenced Chikatilo to death plus 86 years for the 52 murders and five counts of sexual assault for which he had been found guilty.

In his confessions to police, Chikatilo had stated he had killed an Armenian girl in the early summer of 1983 and that she had been killed in a stretch of woodland located near Kirpichnaya station. Although Chikatilo had been unable to identify Sarkisyan's picture when presented to him, the timing of Sarkisyan's disappearance and Chikatilo's physical description of the victim, her clothing, and where he had killed her did match scattered, partial skeletal remains and personal effects which, although determined as being those of a female in her early- to mid-teens, could not be precisely identified.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 249</ref>\n\nAlthough he had at one stage denied having committed six of the murders for which he had been brought to trial, Chikatilo never specifically disputed Sarkisyan as being a victim of his.\n\n===Suspected victims===\n* Chikatilo confessed to three additional murders which police were unable to verify.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/30/world/the-man-in-the-iron-cage-a-russian-horror-story.html/|title=The Man in the Iron Cage: A Russian Horror Story|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 July 1992|access-date=30 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829110611/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/30/world/the-man-in-the-iron-cage-a-russian-horror-story.html#|archive-date=29 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Chikatilo, these three murders were committed in and around the city of Shakhty between 1980 and 1982. Despite his confessions, police were unable to either match his descriptions of these victims to any missing persons reports,<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 205</ref> or locate any human remains, despite thoroughly searching the locations where Chikatilo stated he had committed these murders. Therefore, he was never charged with these three further killings he claimed to have committed.\n* Chikatilo is the prime suspect in the murder of 18-year-old Irina Pogoryelova, a court secretary from Bataysk who had disappeared on 11 August 1986 and whose body was found buried in the grounds of a collective farm on 18 August. Pogoryelova's body bore precisely the same mutilations found upon victims Chikatilo killed both before and after 1986. In his initial confession, Chikatilo had denied he had killed Pogoryelova, yet later insisted at his trial he had indeed killed her.\n* At his trial, Chikatilo claimed he had committed four further murders in addition to the 53 for which he was brought to trial. Presumably, three of these victims were the three he had initially confessed to having committed in 1990 and which the police were unable to either locate or match to any missing persons records, the fourth individual he specifically named as Irina Pogoryelova. If his claims of having killed four additional victims are true, the total number of victims Chikatilo claimed is 57.\n\n==Media==\n<!---\n PLEASE DO NOT ADD SONG REFERENCES, SONGS ABOUT HIM, DEPICTIONS ON TV SHOWS LIKE THE SIMPSONS OR OTHER TRIVIA HERE.

'''Butcher of Rostov''', the '''Red Ripper''', and the '''Rostov Ripper''', who [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]], murdered, and mutilated at least 52 women and children between 1978 and 1990 in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], and the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbek SSR]]. Chikatilo confessed to 56 murders and was tried for 53 of these killings in April 1992. He was convicted and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]] for 52 of these murders in October 1992, although the [[Supreme Court of Russia]] ruled in 1993 that [[Burden of proof (law)|insufficient evidence]] existed to prove Chikatilo's guilt in 9 of these murders. Chikatilo was subsequently executed in February 1994.\n\nChikatilo was known as the \"Rostov Ripper\" and the \"Butcher of Rostov\" due to the fact he committed the majority of his murders in the [[Rostov Oblast]] of the Russian SFSR.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\nAndrei Chikatilo was born on 16 October 1936 in the village of [[:uk:\u042f\u0431\u043b\u0443\u0447\u043d\u0435 (\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d)|Yabluchne]] in the [[Sumy Oblast]] of the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. At the time of his birth, Ukraine was in the grip of a [[Holodomor|famine]] caused by [[Joseph Stalin]]'s forced [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]] of agriculture.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 212\">''The Killer Department'', p. 212</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/crime-files/andre-chikatilo-the-rostov-ripper/biography.html|title=Andrei Chikatilo: The Rostov Ripper|website=crimeandinvestigation.co.uk|accessdate=April 19, 2019|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130063046/http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/crime-files/andre-chikatilo-the-rostov-ripper/biography.html#|archive-date=January 30, 2010 }}</ref> Chikatilo's parents were both [[Collective farming#Communist collectivization|collective farm]] labourers who lived in a one-room hut.<ref name=\":3\">''The Killer Department'' p. 207</ref> They received no wages for their work, but instead received the right to cultivate a plot of land behind the family hut. The family seldom had sufficient food; Chikatilo himself later claimed not to have eaten bread until the age of 12,<ref>{{cite book|first1=Mikhail|last1=Krivich|first2=Olgert|last2=Ol'Gin|first3=Mikhail|last3=Krivitch|title=Comrade Chikatilo|publisher=Barricade Books Inc.|location=Fort Lee, New Jersey|date=1993|ISBN=978-0942637908|page=[https://archive.org/details/comradechikatilo00kriv/page/141 141]|url=https://archive.org/details/comradechikatilo00kriv/page/141}}</ref> adding that he and his family often had to eat grass and leaves in an effort to stave off hunger.<ref name=\"Comrade Chikatilo, p. 143\">''Comrade Chiaktilo'', p. 143</ref> Throughout his childhood, Chikatilo was repeatedly told by his mother Anna that prior to his birth, an older brother of his named Stepan had, at age four, been kidnapped and [[cannibalism|cannibalized]] by starving neighbours, although it has never been established whether this incident actually occurred, or if a Stepan Chikatilo even existed.<ref name=\"news.google.com\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&dat=19920420&id=JMFUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=f5ADAAAAIBAJ&pg=4499,3916322|title=Russian Serial Killer 'Had a Disturbed Past'|newspaper=[[New Straits Times]]|publisher=New Straits Times Press|location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia|date=20 April 1992|accessdate=25 July 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 212\"/> Nonetheless, Chikatilo recalled his childhood as being blighted by poverty, ridicule, hunger, and war.<ref name=\"news.google.com\"/>\n\nWhen the [[Soviet Union]] entered the [[World War II|Second World War]], Chikatilo's father Roman was [[conscription|conscripted]] into the [[Red Army]]. He would later be taken prisoner after being wounded in combat.<ref name=\":2\">''The Killer Department'', pp. 133\u2013134</ref> Between 1941 and 1944, Chikatilo witnessed some of the effects of the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Nazi occupation of Ukraine]], which he described as \"horrors\", adding he witnessed bombings, fires, and shootings from which he and his mother would hide in cellars and ditches.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 113</ref> On one occasion, Chikatilo and his mother were forced to watch their own hut burn to the ground.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 262\">''The Killer Department'', p. 262</ref> With his father at war, Chikatilo and his mother shared a single bed. He was a [[Nocturnal enuresis|chronic bed wetter]], and his mother berated and beat him for each offence.<ref name=\":1\">''The Killer Department'', p. 213</ref>\n\nIn 1943 Chikatilo's mother gave birth to a baby girl, Tatyana. Because Chikatilo's father had been conscripted in 1941, he could not have fathered this child. As many Ukrainian women were raped by German soldiers during the war, it has been speculated Tatyana was conceived as a result of a rape committed by a German soldier. As Chikatilo and his mother lived in a one-room hut, this rape may have been committed in Chikatilo's presence.<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Kalman|title=Born to Kill in the USSR|publisher=Feisen Press|location=Victoria, British Columbia|date=2014|ISBN=978-1460227305|page=180}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1944,<ref name=\"Comrade Chikatilo, p. 143\"/> Chikatilo began his schooling. Although shy and ardently studious as a child, he was physically weak and regularly attended school in homespun clothing and, by 1946, with his stomach swollen from hunger resulting from the [[Soviet famine of 1946\u201347|post-war famine]] which plagued much of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Comrade Chikatilo, p. 143\"/> On several occasions, this hunger caused Chikatilo to faint both at home and at school,<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 262\"/> and he was consistently targeted by bullies<ref>''The Killer Department'', pp. 214\u2013215</ref> who regularly mocked him over his physical stature and timid nature. At home, Chikatilo and his sister were constantly berated by their mother. Tatyana later recalled that in spite of the hardships endured by her parents, their father was a kind man, whereas their mother was harsh and unforgiving toward her children.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nChikatilo developed a passion for reading and memorizing data, and often studied at home, both to increase his sense of self-worth and to compensate for his [[myopia]], which often prevented him from reading the classroom blackboard.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 261\">''The Killer Department'', p. 261</ref> To his teachers, Chikatilo was an excellent student upon whom they would regularly bestow praise and commendation.\n\n===Adolescence===\nBy his teens, Chikatilo was both a model student and an ardent [[communist]]. He was appointed editor of his school newspaper at age 14<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 146</ref> and chairman of the pupils' [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] committee two years later. An avid reader of communist literature, he was also delegated the task of organizing street marches.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 263\">''The Killer Department'', p. 263</ref> Although Chikatilo claimed learning did not come easy to him due to headaches and a poor memory, he was the only student from his collective farm to complete the final year of study, graduating with excellent grades in 1954.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 263\"/>\n\nAt the onset of [[puberty]], Chikatilo discovered that he suffered from chronic [[Erectile dysfunction|impotence]], worsening his social awkwardness and self-hatred.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 264\u2013265</ref> He was shy in the company of women;<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 264</ref> his first crush, at age 17, had been on a girl named Lilya Barysheva, with whom he had become acquainted through his school newspaper,<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 147</ref> yet he was chronically nervous in her company and never asked her for a date. The same year, Chikatilo jumped upon an 11-year-old friend of his younger sister and wrestled her to the ground, [[orgasm|ejaculating]] as the girl struggled in his grasp.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 216</ref>\n\nFollowing his graduation, Chikatilo applied for a scholarship at [[Moscow State University]]. Although he passed the entrance examination with good-to-excellent scores,<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 217\">''The Killer Department'', p. 217</ref> his grades were not deemed good enough for acceptance.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 217\"/> Chikatilo speculated his scholarship application was rejected due to his father's tainted war record (his father had been branded a traitor for being taken prisoner in 1943),<ref name=\"news.google.com\"/><ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 261\"/> but the truth was that other students had performed better in a highly competitive exam.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', pp. 18\u201319</ref> He did not attempt to enroll at another university; instead, he travelled to the city of [[Kursk]], where he worked as a labourer for three months before\u2014in 1955\u2014enrolling in a [[Vocational school#Central and Eastern Europe|vocational school]] with the aim of becoming a communications technician.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 217\"/> The same year, Chikatilo formed his first serious relationship, with a local girl two years his junior. On three separate occasions, the couple attempted intercourse, although on each occasion, Chikatilo was unable to sustain an erection.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 153</ref> After eighteen months, she broke off the relationship.\n\n===Army service===\nUpon completion of his two-year vocational training, Chikatilo relocated to the [[Ural Federal District|Urals]] city of [[Nizhny Tagil]]<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 19</ref> to work upon a long-term construction project. While living in Nizhny Tagil, he also undertook correspondence courses in engineering with the Moscow Electrotechnical Institute of Communication. He worked in the Urals for two years until he was drafted into the [[Soviet Army]] in 1957.\n\nChikatilo performed his compulsory military service between 1957 and 1960,<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 20</ref> assigned first to serve with [[Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|border guards]] in [[Central Asia]], then to a [[KGB]] communications unit in Berlin. Here, his work record was unblemished, and he joined the Communist Party in 1960, shortly before his military service ended.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 218</ref>\n\nUpon completing his service, Chikatilo returned to his native village to live with his parents. He soon became acquainted with a young divorc\u00e9e. Their three-month relationship ended after several unsuccessful attempts at intercourse, after which the woman innocently asked her friends for advice as to how Chikatilo might overcome his inability to maintain an erection.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 265\">''The Killer Department'', p. 265</ref> As a result, most of his peers discovered his impotence. In a 1993 interview regarding this incident, Chikatilo stated: \"Girls were going behind my back, whispering that I was impotent. I was so ashamed. I tried to hang myself. My mother and some young neighbours pulled me out of the noose. Well, I thought no one would want such a shamed man. So I had to run away from there, away from my homeland.\"<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 265\"/>\n\n==Move to Rostov-on-Don==\nAfter several months, Chikatilo found a job as a [[Telecommunications engineering|communications engineer]] in a town located north of [[Rostov-on-Don]]. He relocated to the [[Russian SFSR]] in 1961, renting a small apartment close to his workplace. The same year, his younger sister, Tatyana, finished her schooling and moved into his apartment (his parents would relocate to the Rostov region shortly thereafter).<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 157</ref> Tatyana lived with her brother for six months before marrying a local youth and moving into her in-laws' home; she noted nothing untoward with regard to her brother's lifestyle beyond his chronic shyness around women, and resolved to help her brother find a wife and start a family.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', pp. 24\u201325</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\nIn 1963 Chikatilo married a woman named Feodosia Odnacheva, to whom he had been introduced by his younger sister. According to Chikatilo, although he was attracted to Feodosia, his marriage was effectively an [[Arranged marriage|arranged]] one which occurred barely two weeks after they had met and in which the decisive roles were played by his sister and her husband.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 219\">''The Killer Department'', p. 219</ref>\n\nChikatilo later claimed that his marital sex life was minimal and that, after his wife understood he was unable to maintain an erection, they agreed she would conceive by him ejaculating externally and pushing his [[semen]] inside her vagina with his fingers.<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 266</ref> In 1965, Feodosia gave birth to a daughter, Lyudmila. Four years later, in 1969, a son named Yuri was born.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 219\"/>\n\n==Teaching career==\nChikatilo chose to enroll as a correspondence student at [[Southern Federal University|Rostov University]] in 1964,<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 29</ref> studying [[Russian literature]] and [[philology]];<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 231</ref> he obtained his degree in these subjects in 1970. Shortly before obtaining his degree, Chikatilo obtained a job managing regional sports activities.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 160</ref> He remained in this position for one year, before beginning his career as a teacher of Russian language and literature in [[Novoshakhtinsk]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Brian|last=Marriner|title=Cannibalism: The Last Taboo|publisher=[[Arrow Books]]|location=New York City|date=1992|ISBN=1-859-58495-0|page=242}}</ref>\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0439 \u211633 \u0433. \u0428\u0430\u0445\u0442\u044b.JPG|180px|right|thumb|Technical School No. 33, [[Shakhty]]. Chikatilo worked at this school at the time of his first murder<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 35</ref>]]\nChikatilo was largely ineffective as a teacher; although knowledgeable in the subjects he taught, he was seldom able to maintain discipline in his classes and was regularly subjected to mockery by his students who, he claimed, took advantage of his modest nature.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 30</ref>\n\n===Sexual assaults===\nIn May 1973, Chikatilo committed his first known sexual assault upon one of his pupils. In this incident, he swam towards a 15-year-old girl and groped her breasts and genitals, ejaculating as the girl struggled against his grasp. Months later, Chikatilo sexually assaulted another teenage girl whom he had locked in his classroom.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 187</ref> He was not disciplined for either of these incidents,<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 32</ref> nor for the occasions in which fellow teachers observed Chikatilo fondling himself in the presence of his students. One of Chikatilo's duties at this school was ensuring his students who boarded at the school were present in their dormitories in the evenings; on several occasions, he is known to have entered the girls' dormitory in the hope of seeing them undressed.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 163</ref>\n\nIn response to the increasing number of complaints lodged against him by his students, the director of the school summoned Chikatilo to a formal meeting and informed him he should either resign voluntarily, or be fired. Chikatilo left his employment discreetly and found another job as a teacher at another school in Novoshakhtinsk in January 1974. He lost this job as a result of staff cutbacks in September 1978, before finding another teaching position in [[Shakhty]], a coal-mining town close to Rostov-on-Don.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 223</ref>\n\nChikatilo's career as a teacher ended in March 1981 following several complaints of [[child molestation]] against pupils of both sexes.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 252</ref> The same month, he began a job as a supply clerk for a factory based in Rostov which produced construction materials.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 228</ref> This job required Chikatilo to travel extensively across much of the Soviet Union to either physically purchase the raw materials required to fulfill [[production quota]]s, or to negotiate supply contracts.\n\n==Initial murders==\n[[File:Yelena Zakotnova.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Yelena Zakotnova, aged 9.

The body of Yelena Zakotnova was found at this location on 24 December]]\nIn September 1978, Chikatilo moved to Shakhty, where he committed his first documented murder. On 22 December, Chikatilo lured a 9-year-old girl named Yelena Zakotnova to an old house which he had secretly purchased; he attempted to rape her but failed to achieve an erection. When the girl struggled, he choked her and stabbed her three times in the abdomen, ejaculating while stabbing the child. In an interview after his arrest, Chikatilo later recalled that immediately after stabbing Zakotnova, the girl had \"said something very [[Dysphonia|hoarsely]]\", whereupon he strangled her into unconsciousness before throwing her body into the nearby Grushevka River.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 43</ref> Her body was found two days later.\n\nNumerous pieces of evidence linked Chikatilo to Zakotnova's murder: spots of blood had been found in the snow near the house Chikatilo had purchased; neighbours had noted that Chikatilo had been present in the house on the evening of 22 December; Zakotnova's school rucksack had been found upon the opposite bank of the river at the end of the street (indicating the girl had been thrown into the river at this location); and a witness had given police a detailed description of a man closely resembling Chikatilo, whom she had seen talking with Zakotnova at the bus stop where the girl had last been seen alive.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 44</ref> Despite these facts, a 25-year-old labourer named Aleksandr Kravchenko (who had previously served a prison sentence for the rape and murder of a teenage girl)<ref>Murder in Mind issue 7 p. 3</ref> was arrested for the crime. A search of Kravchenko's home revealed spots of blood on his wife's jumper: the [[blood type]] was determined to match both Zakotnova and Kravchenko's wife.\n\nKravchenko had a watertight [[alibi]] for the afternoon of 22 December: he had been at home with his wife and a friend of hers the entire afternoon, and neighbours of the couple were able to verify this.<ref>''Murder in Mind'', issue 7, p. 3</ref> Nonetheless, the police, having threatened Kravchenko's wife with being an [[accomplice|accomplice to murder]] and her friend with [[perjury]], obtained new statements in which the women claimed Kravchenko had not returned home until late in the evening on the day of the murder.<ref name=Pristavkin>\"''Valley of Deadly Shadow''\" {{lang-ru|\u0414\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438}}, [[Anatoly Pristavkin]], Zebra, Moscow, pp. 30\u201333</ref> Confronted with these altered testimonies, Kravchenko confessed to the killing.<ref name=Pristavkin/> He was tried for the murder in 1979.

According to his subsequent confession, Chikatilo lured Tkachenko to a forest near the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] with the pretext of drinking vodka and \"relaxing\".<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 55\"/> When they reached a secluded area, he threw the girl to the ground before tearing off her clothes and attempting intercourse, as Tkachenko remonstrated against his actions.<ref>''Hunting The Devil'' p. 59</ref> When Chikatilo failed to achieve an erection, he forced mud inside her mouth to stifle her screams before battering and strangling her to death.

Murdered 12 June 1982. Biryuk was the first victim linked to a series of murders known to investigators as the ''Forest Strip Killings''<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 33</ref>]]\nNine months after the murder of Tkachenko, on 12 June 1982, Chikatilo travelled by bus to the [[Bagayevsky District]] of Rostov to purchase vegetables. Having to change buses in the village of [[Donskoy (inhabited locality)|Donskoi]], he decided to continue his journey on foot.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 199</ref> Walking away from the bus station, he encountered a 13-year-old girl, named Lyubov Biryuk, who was herself walking home from a shopping trip.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 4</ref> Once the path both were taking together was shielded from the view of potential witnesses by bushes, Chikatilo pounced upon Biryuk, dragged her into nearby undergrowth, tore off her dress, and killed her by stabbing and slashing her to death.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 60\">''The Red Ripper'', p. 60</ref> When her body was found on 27 June, the [[medical examiner]] discovered evidence of 22 knife wounds inflicted to the head, neck, chest, and pelvic region.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 89</ref> Further wounds found on the skull suggested the killer had attacked Biryuk from behind with the handle and blade of his knife. In addition, several striations were discovered upon Biryuk's [[Orbit (anatomy)|eye sockets]].\n\nFollowing Biryuk's murder, Chikatilo no longer attempted to resist his homicidal urges: between July and September 1982, he killed a further five victims between the ages of nine and 18. He established a pattern of approaching children, runaways, and young vagrants at bus or railway stations, enticing them to a nearby forest or other secluded area, and killing them, usually by stabbing, slashing and [[Disembowelment|eviscerating]] the victim with a knife; although some victims, in addition to receiving a multitude of knife wounds, were also strangled or battered to death.<ref>''Real Life Crimes'', issue 7, p. 150</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Murder and Violent Crime|last=Hickey|first=Eric|date=2003|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=|isbn=076192437X|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=70}}</ref>\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0418\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|165px|Memorial to Chikatilo's seventh victim, [[#Karabelnikova|Irina Karabelnikova]].

[[Forensic pathology|Pathologists]] concluded these injuries had been caused by a knife, leading investigators to the conclusion the killer had gouged out the eyes of his victims.<ref name=\"The Killer Department p. 30\">''The Killer Department'' p. 30</ref> Chikatilo's adult female victims were often [[prostitute]]s or homeless women whom he would lure to secluded areas with promises of alcohol or money. Chikatilo would typically attempt intercourse with these victims, but he would usually be unable to achieve or maintain an erection; this would send him into a murderous fury, particularly if the woman mocked his impotence. He would achieve orgasm only when he stabbed and slashed the victim to death. His child and adolescent victims were of both sexes; Chikatilo would lure these victims to secluded areas using a variety of ruses, usually formed in the initial conversation with the victim,<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 178</ref> such as promising them assistance or company, or offering to show them a shortcut,<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 98</ref> a chance to view rare stamps, films or coins, or with an offer of food or candy. He would usually overpower these victims once they were alone, often tying their hands behind their backs with a length of rope before stuffing mud or [[loam]] into the victims' mouth to silence their screams, and then proceed to kill them.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 202\">''The Killer Department'', p. 202</ref> After the killing, Chikatilo would make rudimentary\u2014though seldom serious\u2014efforts to conceal the body<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 146</ref> before leaving the crime scene.\n\nOn 11 December 1982 Chikatilo encountered a 10-year-old girl named Olga Stalmachenok riding a bus to her parents' home in Novoshakhtinsk and persuaded the child to leave the bus with him. She was last seen by a fellow passenger, who reported that a middle-aged man had led the girl away firmly by the hand.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 65</ref> Chikatilo lured the girl to a cornfield on the outskirts of Novoshakhtinsk, stabbed her in excess of 50 times around the head and body, ripped open her chest and excised her lower bowel and [[uterus]].<ref name=\"The Killer Department p. 30\"/>\n\n===Investigation===\nBy January 1983, four victims thus far killed had been tentatively linked to the same killer.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 24</ref> A [[Moscow]] police team, headed by Major Mikhail Fetisov, was sent to Rostov-on-Don to direct the investigation, which gradually became known among investigators as ''Operation Forest Path''.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 61</ref> Fetisov established a team of 10 investigators, based in Rostov, charged with solving all four cases. In March, Fetisov assigned a newly appointed specialist [[forensic science|forensic analyst]], Viktor Burakov, to head the investigation. The following month, Olga Stalmachenok's body was found. Burakov was summoned to the crime scene, where he examined the numerous knife wounds and eviscerations conducted upon the child, and the striations on her eye sockets. Burakov later stated that, as he noted the striations upon Stalmachenok's eye sockets, any doubts about the presence of a serial killer evaporated.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 30</ref>\n\nChikatilo did not kill again until June 1983, when he murdered a 15-year-old [[Armenians|Armenian]] girl named Laura Sarkisyan; her body was found close to an unmarked railway platform near Shakhty.<ref name=\"Comrade Chikatilo, p. 92\">''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 92</ref> By September, he had killed a further five victims.

On 24 March, he lured a 10-year-old boy, named Dmitry Ptashnikov, away from a stamp kiosk in Novoshakhtinsk. While walking with the boy, Chikatilo was seen by several witnesses who were able to give investigators a detailed description of the killer. When Ptashnikov's body was found three days later, police also found a footprint of the killer and both semen and [[saliva]] samples on the victim's clothing.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/crime-files/andre-chikatilo-the-rostov-ripper# |title=''Andrei Chikatilo: The Rostov Ripper Crime Files'' |access-date=12 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519080735/http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/crime-files/andre-chikatilo-the-rostov-ripper# |archive-date=19 May 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 May, Chikatilo killed a young woman named Tatyana Petrosyan and her 10-year-old daughter, Svetlana, in a wooded area outside Shakhty; Petrosyan had known Chikatilo for several years prior to her murder.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', pp. 85\u201387</ref> By the end of July, he had killed three additional young women between the ages of 19 and 21, and a 13-year-old boy. In the summer of 1984, Chikatilo was fired from his work as a supply clerk for the theft of a roll of linoleum. The accusation had been filed against him the previous February, and he had been asked to resign quietly but had refused to do so, as he had denied the charges.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 79</ref> Chikatilo found another job as a supply clerk in Rostov on 1 August.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 254\"/>\n[[File:Natalya Golosovskaya.jpg|140px|right|thumb|Natalya Golosovskaya, aged 16. Murdered 2 August 1984]]\nOn 2 August, Chikatilo killed a 16-year-old girl, Natalya Golosovskaya, in Aviators' Park. On 7 August, he lured a 17-year-old girl, Lyudmila Alekseyeva, to the banks of the Don River on the pretense of showing her a shortcut to a bus terminal. Alekseyeva suffered 39 slash wounds to her body before Chikatilo mutilated and disemboweled her: intentionally inflicting wounds he knew would not be immediately fatal.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 94</ref> Her body was found in the following morning, her excised upper lip inside her mouth.<ref name=\"Comrade Chikatilo, p. 200\">''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 200</ref> Hours after Alekseyeva's murder, Chikatilo flew to the [[Uzbek SSR|Uzbekistan]] capital of [[Tashkent]] on a business trip. By the time he had returned to Rostov on 15 August, he had killed an unidentified young woman and a 10-year-old girl.<ref name=\"Comrade Chikatilo, p. 200\"/> Within two weeks, an 11-year-old boy named Aleksandr Chepel had been found on the banks of the Don River, strangled and castrated, with his eyes gouged out, just yards from where Alexeyeva's body had earlier been found.<ref name=\"Comrade Chikatilo, p. 200\"/> Chikatilo then killed a young librarian, Irina Luchinskaya, in Aviators' Park on 6 September.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 101\">''The Red Ripper'', p. 101</ref>\n\n==First arrest and release==\nOn 13 September 1984, Chikatilo was observed by two undercover detectives attempting to talk to young women at the Rostov bus station. The detectives followed him as he wandered through the city, trying to approach women and committing acts of [[frotteurism]] in public places.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 1</ref> Upon Chikatilo's arrival at the city's central market he was arrested and held. A search of his belongings revealed a knife with an eight-inch blade, several lengths of rope, and a jar of [[Vaseline]].<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 8</ref> He was also discovered to be under investigation for minor theft at one of his former employers, which gave the investigators the legal right to hold him for a prolonged period of time. Chikatilo's dubious background was uncovered, and his physical description matched the description of the man seen walking alongside Dmitry Ptashnikov prior to the boy's murder. A sample of Chikatilo's blood was taken; the results of which revealed his [[ABO blood group system|blood group]] to be type A,<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 87</ref> whereas semen samples found upon a total of six victims murdered by the unknown killer throughout the spring and summer of 1984<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 78\"/> had been classified by medical examiners to be type AB. Chikatilo's name was added to the card index file used by investigators, however, the results of his blood type analysis largely discounted him as being the unknown killer.{{refn|group=n|By Chikatilo's arrest, this index file had expanded to include over 25,000 individuals investigated in connection with the murders.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 100</ref>}}\n\nChikatilo was found guilty of theft of property from his previous employer<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 118\">''The Red Ripper'', p. 118</ref> and sentenced to one year in prison but was freed on 12 December 1984 after serving three months.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 118\"/>\n\nOn 8 October 1984 the head of the Russian Public Prosecutors Office formally linked 23 of Chikatilo's murders into one case and dropped all charges against the mentally handicapped youths who had previously confessed to the murders.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', pp. 112\u201313</ref>\n\n===Later murders===\nUpon his release from prison in December 1984, Chikatilo found new work at a locomotive factory in Novocherkassk and kept a low profile. He did not kill again until 1 August 1985<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 216</ref> when, on a business trip to Moscow, he encountered an 18-year-old woman, named Natalia Pokhlistova, at a railway platform near [[Domodedovo Airport]]. Pokhlistova was lured into a thicket of woods where she was bound, stabbed 38 times, then strangled to death.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 218</ref> Based upon the hypothesis that the killer had travelled from the [[Rostov Oblast]] to Moscow via air, investigators checked all [[Aeroflot]] flight records of passengers who had commuted between Moscow and the Rostov Oblast between late July and early August. On this occasion, however, Chikatilo had travelled to Moscow by train and, accordingly, no documentation existed for investigators to research. Four weeks later, on 27 August, Chikatilo killed another young woman, Irina Gulyaeva, in Shakhty. As had been the case with Pokhlistova, the wounds inflicted upon the victim linked her murder to the hunt for the serial killer.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 111</ref>\n\nIn November 1985, a special procurator, [[Issa Kostoyev]], was appointed to supervise the investigation, which had by this stage expanded to include 15 procurators and 29 detectives assigned to work exclusively upon the manhunt.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 120</ref> The known murders linked to the manhunt were carefully re-investigated, and police began another round of questioning of known sex offenders and homosexuals. The following month, the [[militsiya]] resumed the patrolling of railway stations around Rostov, and [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plain clothed]] female officers were ordered to loiter around bus and train stations. At the request of Viktor Burakov, police also took the step of consulting a [[psychiatrist]], Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, the first such consultation in a serial killer investigation in the Soviet Union. All crime scene and medical examiner's reports were made available to Bukhanovsky, upon the understanding he would produce a [[offender profiling|psychological profile]] of the unknown murderer for investigators.<ref>''The Killer Department''pp. 125\u2013126</ref>\n\nBukhanovsky's 65-page psychological profile described the killer as a reclusive man aged between 45 and 50 years old who had endured a painful and isolated childhood, and who was incapable of flirting or courtship with women. This individual was of average intelligence, likely to be married and to have fathered children, but also a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadist]] who suffered from impotence and could achieve sexual arousal only by seeing his victims suffer. The murders themselves were an analogue to the sexual intercourse this individual was incapable of performing, and his knife became a substitute for a penis which failed to function normally.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 127</ref> Because many of the killings had occurred on weekdays near mass transport hubs and across the entire Rostov Oblast, Bukhanovsky also argued that the killer's work required him to travel regularly, and based upon the actual days of the week when the killings had occurred, the killer was most likely tied to a production schedule.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 129</ref>\n\nChikatilo followed the investigation carefully, reading newspaper reports about the manhunt for the killer which had begun to appear in the news media,<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 233</ref> and keeping his homicidal urges under control. For almost a year following the August 1985 murder of Irina Gulyaeva, no further victims were found in either the Rostov or [[Moscow Oblast]]s whose bodies bore the signature mutilations of the unknown murderer. Investigators did tentatively link the murder of a 33-year-old woman named Lyubov Golovakha\u2014found stabbed to death in the [[Myasnikovsky District]] of Rostov on 23 July 1986\u2014to the investigation, although this was solely upon the basis that the killer's semen type matched that of the killer they were seeking, that the victim had been stripped naked prior to her murder, and that she had been stabbed in excess of 20 times.<ref name=\":2\" /> The victim had not been [[dismemberment|dismembered]] or otherwise mutilated, nor had she been seen near mass transportation. Because of these discrepancies, many investigators expressed serious doubts as to whether Golovakha's murder had been committed by the killer they were seeking.\n\nOn 18 August 1986 a victim was found buried in a depression of earth in the grounds of a collective farm in the city of [[Bataysk]]. The wounds inflicted on this victim bore the trademark mutilations of victims linked to the manhunt killed between 1982 and 1985. The victim was an 18-year-old secretary named Irina Pogoryelova. Pogoryelova's body bore all the trademark mutilations of the previous victims: her body had been slit open from the neck to the genitalia, with one breast removed and her eyes cut out. As the murderer had made serious efforts to bury the body,<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 136</ref> some investigators theorized that this explained the sudden dearth in the number of victims found.\n\nBy the autumn of 1986, investigators in Rostov theorized that the unknown killer may have moved to another part of the Soviet Union and continued killing there. As the three victims killed in the Rostov Oblast in 1985 and 1986 had died in August, some investigators gave credence to the possibility the perpetrator may have relocated to another part of the Soviet Union, and may only be returning to the Rostov Oblast in summer. The Rostov police compiled bulletins to be sent to all forces throughout the Soviet Union, describing the pattern of wounds their unknown killer inflicted upon his victims and requesting feedback from any police force who had discovered murder victims with wounds matching those upon the victims found in the Rostov Oblast. The response was negative.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 115</ref>{{refn|group=n|Uzbekistan investigators did not link the two murders committed by Chikatilo in Tashkent to the series because in one instance, the victim had been beheaded,<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 95\">''The Red Ripper'', p. 95</ref> and in the second instance, the mutilations upon the victim had been so extensive police had concluded the body had been caught in a [[mechanised agriculture|harvesting machine]].<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 225</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1290&dat=19921015&id=jeg0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=wYwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3807,7156775&hl=en/|title=Caged Russian Grandfather Guilty of 52 Grisly Murders|newspaper=The News|date=15 October 1992|access-date=18 July 2016}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1987 Chikatilo killed three times. On each occasion the murder took place while he was on a business trip far away from the Rostov Oblast, and none of these murders were linked to the manhunt in Rostov.<ref>''The Red Ripper'' p. 133</ref> Chikatilo's first murder in 1987 was committed on 16 May, when he encountered a 12-year-old boy, named Oleg Makarenkov, at a train station in the Urals town of [[Revda, Sverdlovsk Oblast|Revda]]. Makarenkov was lured from the station with the promise of sharing a meal with Chikatilo at his [[dacha]]; he was murdered in woodland close to the station, although his body would remain undiscovered until 1991.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 212</ref> In July, he killed a 12-year-old boy, named Ivan Bilovetsky, in the Ukrainian city of [[Zaporizhia]], and on 15 September, he killed a 16-year-old vocational school student, named Yuri Tereshonok, in woodland on the outskirts of [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]].<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 221</ref>\n\n===Definitive resurfacing===\nIn 1988 Chikatilo killed three times, murdering an unidentified woman in [[Krasny Sulin]] in April and two boys in May and July. His first murder victim was lured off a train at Krasny Sulin before Chikatilo bound her hands behind her back and stuffed her mouth with dirt, before severing her nose from her face<ref>''Hunting The Devil'' p. 153</ref> and inflicting numerous knife wounds to her neck. Chikatilo then bludgeoned her to death with a slab of concrete; her body was found on 6 April. Investigators noted that the knife wounds inflicted upon this victim were similar to those inflicted on the victims linked to the manhunt and killed between 1982 and 1985, but as the woman had been killed with a slab of concrete and had not been disemboweled, investigators were unsure whether to link this murder to the investigation.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 146\">''The Killer Department'', p. 146</ref> In May, Chikatilo killed a 9-year-old boy, named Aleksey Voronko, in [[Ilovaisk]], Ukraine. The boy's wounds left no doubt the killer had struck again, and this murder was linked to the manhunt.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, pp. 256\u201357\">''The Red Ripper'', pp. 256\u201357</ref> On 14 July, Chikatilo killed 15-year-old Yevgeny Muratov at Donleskhoz station near Shakhty. Muratov's murder was also linked to the investigation, although his body was not found until April 1989. Although his remains were largely skeletal, Muratov's autopsy revealed he had been emasculated, and suffered at least 30 knife wounds.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 152\">''The Killer Department'', p. 152</ref>\n[[File:Aleksey Khobotov.jpg|right|125px|thumb|Aleksey Khobotov, aged 10. Murdered 28 August 1989]]\nChikatilo did not kill again until 1 March 1989, when he killed a 16-year-old girl in his daughter's vacant apartment. He dismembered her body and hid the remains in a sewer. As the victim had been dismembered, police did not link her murder to the investigation. Between May and August, Chikatilo killed a further four victims, three of whom were killed in Rostov and Shakhty,<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, pp. 256\u201357\"/> although only two of these victims were linked to the killer. With the resurfacing of victims definitively linked to the manhunt and the fact the majority of these victims' bodies had been discovered close to railway stations, investigators assigned numerous plain clothed officers to discreetly film and photograph passengers on trains throughout the Rostov Oblast. Several trains were also fitted with hidden cameras with the intention of filming or photographing a victim in the company of his or her murderer.<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 163</ref>\n\nOn 14 January 1990 Chikatilo encountered 11-year-old Andrei Kravchenko standing outside a Shakhty theater. Kravchenko was lured from the theater on the pretext of being shown imported [[Western world|Western]] films Chikatilo claimed to have at his residence; his extensively stabbed, emasculated body was found in a secluded section of woodland the following month.<ref>''The Red Ripper'' p. 165</ref> Seven weeks after Kravchenko's murder, on 7 March, Chikatilo lured a 10-year-old boy, named Yaroslav Makarov, from a Rostov train station to Rostov's Botanical Gardens. His eviscerated body was found the following day.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 257\">''The Red Ripper'', p. 257</ref>\n\nOn 11 March, the leaders of the investigation, headed by Mikhail Fetisov, held a meeting to discuss progress made in the manhunt.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 159</ref> Fetisov was under intense pressure from the public, the press, and the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)#Russian Federation|Ministry of the Interior]] in Moscow to solve the case. The intensity of the manhunt in the years up to 1984 had receded to a degree between 1985 and 1987, when Chikatilo had committed only three murders investigators had conclusively linked to the killer\u2014all killed by 1986. However, by March 1990, a further six victims had been linked to the killer. In addition, following the introduction of greater media freedom as a result of [[Glasnost#Glasnost and Gorbachev|glasnost]], the Soviet news media was much less repressed than it had been in the early years of the manhunt and as such, devoted extensive publicity to the case. Fetisov had also noted laxity in some areas of the investigation and warned that people would be fired if the killer was not caught soon.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', pp. 158\u201359</ref>\n\nChikatilo had killed three further victims by August 1990: on 4 April, he lured a 31-year-old woman, named Lyubov Zuyeva, off a train and killed her in woodland near Donleskhoz station. Her body was not found until 24 August.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', pp. 165-166</ref> On 28 July, he lured a 13-year-old boy, named Viktor Petrov, away from a Rostov railway station and killed him in Rostov's Botanical Gardens;<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 167</ref> and on 14 August, he killed an 11-year-old boy, named Ivan Fomin, in the reeds near Novocherkassk beach.<ref>''Hunting The Devil'' p. 187</ref>\n\n==Snare==\nThe discovery of more victims sparked a massive police operation. Because several victims' bodies had been discovered at railway stations on one rail route through the Rostov Oblast,<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 164</ref> Viktor Burakov suggested a plan to saturate all larger stations in the Rostov Oblast with an obvious uniformed police presence which the killer could not fail to notice. The intention was to discourage the killer from attempting to strike at any of these locations, and to have undercover agents patrol smaller and less busy stations, where the murderer's activities would be more likely to be noticed. The plan was approved, and both the uniformed and undercover officers were instructed to question any adult man in the company of a young woman or child, and note his name and passport number.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 187\">''The Red Ripper'', p. 187</ref> Police deployed 360 men at all the stations in the Rostov Oblast, but only undercover officers were posted at the three smallest stations on the route through the oblast where the killer had struck most frequently\u2014Kirpichnaya, Donleskhoz, and Lesostep<ref>''The Killer Department'', pp. 163\u201365</ref>\u2014in an effort to force the killer to strike at one of those three stations. The operation was implemented on 27 October 1990.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Joe|last=Treen|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20108852,00.html|title=A Monster Caged at Last|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=19 October 1992|accessdate=25 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915012342/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20108852,00.html#|archive-date=15 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 October, police found the body of a 16-year-old boy, named Vadim Gromov, at Donleskhoz station. The wounds upon Gromov's body immediately linked his murder to the manhunt: the youth had been strangled, stabbed 27 times and castrated, with the tip of his tongue severed and his left eye stabbed.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 165\">''The Killer Department'', p. 165</ref> Gromov had been killed on 17 October; 10 days before the start of the initiative. The same day Gromov's body was found, Chikatilo lured another 16-year-old boy, Viktor Tishchenko, off a train at Kirpichnaya station, another station under surveillance from undercover police, and killed him in a nearby forest.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 166</ref> Tishchenko's body\u2014bearing 40 separate knife wounds\u2014was found on 3 November.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 242</ref>\n\n===Final murder and surveillance===\nOn 6 November 1990, Chikatilo killed and mutilated a 22-year-old woman, named Svetlana Korostik, in woodland near Donleskhoz station.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 169</ref> Returning to the railway platform, he was observed by an undercover officer named Igor Rybakov,<ref name=\"The Killer Department p. 171\">''The Killer Department'' p. 171</ref> who observed Chikatilo approach a well and wash his hands and face.<ref name=\"The Killer Department p. 171\"/> When he approached the station, Rybakov also noted that Chikatilo's coat had grass and soil stains on the elbows. Chikatilo also had a small red smear on his cheek and what appeared to be a severe wound on one of his fingers.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 186</ref> To Rybakov, he looked suspicious. The only reason people entered woodland near Donleskhoz station at that time of year was to gather wild mushrooms (a popular pastime in Russia), but Chikatilo was not dressed like a typical forest scavenger; he was wearing more formal attire. Moreover, he had a nylon sports bag, which was unsuitable for carrying mushrooms.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 243</ref> Rybakov stopped Chikatilo and checked his papers, but had no formal reason to arrest him.<ref name=\"The Killer Department p. 171\"/> When Rybakov returned to his office, he filed a routine report, containing the name of the person he had stopped at the station, and the possible blood smear observed upon his cheek.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 187\"/>\n\nOn 13 November, Korostik's body was found; she was the 36th known victim linked to the manhunt. Police summoned the officer in charge of surveillance at Donleskhoz station, and examined the reports of all men stopped and questioned in the previous week.<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 170</ref> Not only was Chikatilo's name among those reports, but it was familiar to several officers involved in the case, because he had been questioned in 1984 and had been placed upon a 1987 suspect list compiled and distributed throughout the Soviet Union.<ref>''The Killer Department'' pp. 170\u201371</ref> After checking with Chikatilo's present and previous employers, investigators were able to place him in various towns and cities at times when several victims linked to the investigation had been murdered.<ref name=\":3\"/> Questioning of former colleagues from Chikatilo's teaching days revealed that he had been forced to resign from two teaching positions due to repeated complaints of lewd behaviour and sexual assault made by his pupils.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 172</ref>\n\nPolice placed Chikatilo under surveillance on 14 November. In several instances, particularly on trains or buses, he was observed approaching lone young women or children, and engaging them in conversation. If the woman or child broke off the conversation, Chikatilo would wait a few minutes and then seek another conversation partner.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 192</ref> On 20 November, after six days of surveillance, Chikatilo left his house with a large jar, which he had filled with beer at a small kiosk in a local park<ref>''The Killer Department'' p. 175</ref> before he wandered around Novocherkassk, attempting to make contact with children he met on his way. Upon exiting a cafe, Chikatilo was arrested by four plainclothes police officers.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 193</ref>\n\n==Second arrest==\nUpon his arrest, Chikatilo gave a statement claiming that the police were mistaken, and complained that he had also been arrested in 1984 for the same series of murders.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 181</ref> A strip-search of the suspect revealed a further piece of evidence: one of Chikatilo's fingers had a flesh wound. Medical examiners concluded the wound was from a human bite. Chikatilo's penultimate victim, Viktor Tishchenko, was a physically strong youth. At the crime scene, the police had found numerous signs of a ferocious physical struggle between the victim and his murderer. Although a finger bone was later found to be broken, and his fingernail had been bitten off, Chikatilo had never sought medical treatment for his injuries.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 177</ref>\n\nA search of Chikatilo's belongings revealed he had been in possession of a folding knife and two lengths of rope. A sample of Chikatilo's blood was taken,<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 198</ref> and he was placed in a cell inside the KGB headquarters in Rostov with a police informer, who was instructed to engage Chikatilo in conversation and elicit any information he could from him.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 179</ref> The next day, 21 November, formal questioning of Chikatilo began. The interrogation was performed by Issa Kostoyev. The strategy chosen by the police to elicit a confession was to lead Chikatilo to believe that he was a very sick individual in need of medical help. The intention was to give Chikatilo hope that if he confessed, he would not be prosecuted by [[insanity plea|reason of insanity]]. Police knew their case against Chikatilo was largely [[circumstantial evidence|circumstantial]], and under Soviet law, they had 10 days in which they could legally hold a suspect before either charging or releasing him.\n\n===Blood group analysis===\nOn 21 November, the results of Chikatilo's blood test again revealed his blood type to be type A and not type AB. Due to the amount of physical and circumstantial evidence investigators had thus far compiled, which indicated Chikatilo was indeed the murderer they had been pursuing, plus the fact that investigators had deduced the blood type of the murderer they had pursued using semen samples obtained from the clothing and bodies of 14 of the victims as opposed to actual blood samples, investigators obtained a sample of Chikatilo's semen to test his blood type, the results of which confirmed that Chikatilo's semen was type AB, whereas his blood and saliva were type A.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 190\">''The Killer Department'', p. 190</ref>{{refn|group=n|Investigators had received a circular in 1988 indicating that in extremely rare cases, a man's blood type may differ from his semen and saliva type.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 149-150</ref>}}\n\nThroughout the questioning, Chikatilo repeatedly denied that he had committed the murders, although he did confess to molesting his pupils during his career as a teacher.<ref>''The Killer Department'', pp. 187\u201388</ref> He also produced several written essays for Kostoyev which, although evasive regarding the actual murders, did reveal psychological symptoms consistent with those predicted by Dr. Bukhanovsky in the 1985 psychological profile he had written for the investigators. The interrogation tactics used by Kostoyev may also have caused Chikatilo to become defensive; the informer sharing a KGB cell with the suspect reported to police that Chikatilo had informed him that Kostoyev had repeatedly asked him direct questions regarding the mutilations inflicted upon the victims.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 190\"/>\n\n==Confession==\nOn 29 November, at the request of Burakov and Fetisov, Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky was invited to assist in the questioning of the suspect. Bukhanovsky read extracts from his 65-page psychological profile to Chikatilo.<ref>''The Killer Department'', pp. 193\u201396</ref> Within two hours, Chikatilo burst into tears<ref name=\"The Killer Department p. 268\">''The Killer Department'' p. 268</ref> and confessed to Bukhanovsky that he was indeed guilty of the crimes for which he had been arrested. After conversing into the evening, Bukhanovsky reported to Burakov and Fetisov that Chikatilo was ready to confess.<ref>{{cite news|first=James|last=Kent|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/aug/08/life1.lifemagazine|title=Darkness Visible|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=8 August 1999|accessdate=25 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826013420/https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/aug/08/life1.lifemagazine#|archive-date=26 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>{{refn|group=n|In 1993, Chikatilo would recount his initial encounter with Dr. Bukhanovsky by stating: \"He already knew me ... and when he recounted everything about my life\u2014how people had humiliated me, shot at me and trampled on me from infancy\u2014well, it was bitter of course. I cried in front of him. I said 'How do you know all this?' ... All my life, I had never had a friend ... no one. There was no one close to me. He is the person closest to me, even now.

I held back nothing.\"<ref name=\"The Killer Department p. 268\">''The Killer Department'' p. 268</ref>}}\n\nArmed with the handwritten notes Bukhanovsky had prepared, Issa Kostoyev prepared a formal accusation of murder dated 29 November\u2014the eve of the expiration of the 10-day time period during which Chikatilo could legally be held before being charged.\n\nThe following morning, Kostoyev resumed the interrogation. According to the official protocol, Chikatilo confessed to 34 of the 36 murders police had linked to him, although he denied two additional murders committed in 1986 the police had initially believed he had committed: one of whom was Lyubov Golovakha,<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 135</ref> found stabbed to death on 23 July 1986 and whom investigators had had serious doubts about linking to the manhunt; the second was 18-year-old Irina Pogoryelova, found murdered in Bataysk on 18 August 1986 and whose mutilations closely matched those inflicted upon other victims linked to the manhunt.{{refn|group=n|Chikatilo would later specifically state in an outburst at his subsequent trial that he had indeed killed Pogoryelova, whom he referred to by name in this outburst.<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 243\">''The Killer Department'', p. 243</ref>}}\n\nChikatilo gave a full, detailed description of each murder on the list of charges, all of which were consistent with known facts regarding each killing. When prompted, he could draw a rough sketch of various crime scenes, indicating the position of the victim's body and various [[landmark]]s in the vicinity of the crime scene. Additional details provided further proof of his guilt: one victim on the list of charges was a 19-year-old student named Anna Lemesheva, whom Chikatilo had killed on 19 July 1984 near Shakhty station. Chikatilo recalled that as he had fought to overpower her, she had stated that a man named \"[[wikt:\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0441#Russian|Bars]]\" (\"Leopard\") would retaliate for his attacking her.

In many instances, particularly (though not exclusively) with his male victims, Chikatilo stated he would bind the victims' hands behind their back with a length of rope before he would proceed to kill them. He would typically inflict a multitude of knife wounds upon the victim; initially inflicting shallow knife wounds to the chest area<ref>''Hunting The Devil'' p. 57</ref> before inflicting deeper stab and slash wounds\u2014usually 30 to 50 in total\u2014before proceeding to eviscerate<ref>{{cite news|title='Rostov Ripper' to be Shot |date=16 October 1992 |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/126949436 |accessdate=1 April 2019|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|location=Canberra, Australia}}</ref> the victim as he writhed atop his or her body until he achieved orgasm.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 31</ref> He had, he stated, become adept at avoiding the spurts of blood from his victims' bodies as he inflicted the knife wounds and eviscerations upon them,<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 205\"/> and would regularly sit or [[Squatting position|squat]] beside his victims until their hearts had stopped beating, adding that the victims' \"cries, the blood and the agony gave me relaxation and a certain pleasure.\"<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 205\">''The Killer Department'', p. 205</ref>\n\nWhen questioned as to why most of his later victims' eyes had been stabbed and/or slashed, but not [[Enucleation of the eye|enucleated]] as his earlier victims' eyes had been, Chikatilo stated that he had initially believed in an old Russian [[superstition]] that the image of a murderer is left imprinted upon the eyes of the victim.

Chikatilo recalled that he had killed Volobuyeva in a millet field, and that he had approached the girl as she sat in the waiting rooms at Krasnodar Airport.

Three of the 56 victims Chikatilo confessed to killing could not be found or identified, but Chikatilo was charged with killing 53 women and children between 1978 and 1990.

Shortly after his psychiatric evaluation at the Serbsky Institute, investigators had conducted a press conference in which a full list of Chikatilo's crimes was released to the press, alongside a 1984 [[Facial composite|identikit]] of the individual charged, but not the full name or a photograph of the accused. The media first saw Chikatilo on the first day of his trial, as he entered an iron cage specifically constructed in a corner of the courtroom to protect him from attack by the enraged and often hysterical relatives of his victims. In the opening weeks of Chikatilo's trial, the Russian press regularly published [[exaggeration|exaggerated]] and often sensationalistic headlines about the murders, referring to Chikatilo being a \"cannibal\" or a \"maniac\" and to his physically resembling a shaven-skulled, demonic individual.{{refn|group=n|As a standard prison procedure to prevent the spread of lice, Chikatilo's head had been shaved.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 230</ref>}}\n\nThe first two days of the trial were devoted to Judge Akubzhanov reading the long lists of [[indictment]]s against Chikatilo. Each murder was discussed individually, and on several occasions, relatives present in the courtroom broke down in tears or fainted when details of their relatives' murder were revealed.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 231</ref> After reading the indictment, Judge Akubzhanov announced to the journalists present in the courtroom his intention to conduct an [[public trial|open trial]], stating: \"Let this trial at least teach us something, so that this will never happen anytime or anywhere again.\"<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 268</ref> Judge Akubzhanov then asked Chikatilo to stand, identify himself and provide his date and location of birth. Chikatilo complied, although this would prove to be one of the few civil exchanges between the judge and Chikatilo.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 238</ref>\n\nChikatilo was initially questioned in detail about each charge upon the indictment. Responding to specific questions regarding the murders, he often gave dismissive replies to questions, particularly when questioned as to the specific nature of the wounds he had inflicted upon his victims and the ruses he had used to entice his victims to the locations where he had killed them. He would become indignant only when accused of stealing personal possessions from the victims, or to his retaining organs excised from the victims missing from the crime scenes. On one occasion, when asked as to his seeming indifference as to the lifestyle and gender of those whom he had killed, Chikatilo replied: \"I did not need to look for them. Every step I took, they were there.\"<ref>''The Red Ripper'', pp. 230\u2013231</ref>{{refn|group=n|In a 1993 interview granted to a ''[[Newsweek]]'' reporter who had been based in the Soviet Union, Chikatilo would expound on this statement by claiming: \"It was all a matter of chance. Of who was riding or walking near me. Or at the station.\"<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 269</ref>}}\n\nIn what became a regular (though not continuous) occurrence throughout the trial, Judge Akubzhanov berated Chikatilo as he questioned him in detail as to the charges; ordering him to \"shut your mouth\", before adding, \"You're not crazy!\" as Chikatilo's responses to questions deviated into his discussing issues such as the repression his family had endured throughout his childhood, and his claiming that the charges filed against him were false. These verbal exchanges would occur whether Chikatilo was cooperative or uncooperative throughout proceedings, and the manner in which the judge questioned Chikatilo repeatedly led Chikatilo's defence lawyer, Marat Khabibulin, to protest against the accusatory nature of the court proceedings. In the instances in which Chikatilo was uncooperative throughout questioning, he would simply shout over the judge, denounce the court as a [[farce]], and launch into rambling, disjointed speeches. On occasion, Chikatilo would also [[Indecent exposure|expose himself]] to the court, or sing [[socialism|socialist]] movement anthems throughout proceedings. These antics regularly resulted in his being returned to his cell as court proceedings continued in his absence.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 277</ref>\n\nOn 21 April, Chikatilo's defence lawyer requested that Dr. Bukhanovsky be allowed to testify as to the contents of the 1985 psychological profile he had written, and his subsequent consultations with Chikatilo following his arrest, adding that Bukhanovsky could exert influence over Chikatilo and, by extension, might influence the court proceedings.<ref name=\"Comrade Chikatilo, p. 271\">''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 271</ref> This request was denied. The same day, Chikatilo began to refuse to answer any questions from the judge, the prosecutor or his own defence lawyer.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 234</ref> He refused to answer any questions for three consecutive days<ref name=\"Comrade Chikatilo, p. 271\"/> before stating his presumption of innocence had been irredeemably violated by the judge and that he intended to give no further testimony.<ref>''Hunting The Devil'' p. 264</ref> The following day, proceedings were [[Adjournment|adjourned]] for two weeks.\n\nChikatilo withdrew his confessions to six of the killings for which he had been charged on 13 May,<ref name=\"The Killer Department, p. 243\"/> and also claimed he had killed four further victims who were not included upon the indictment. The same day, his defence lawyer again submitted a request that his client be subjected to a second psychiatric evaluation. This motion was dismissed by the judge as being groundless. In response, Khabibulin rose from his seat, condemning the composition of the court, and arguing that the judge was unfit to continue presiding over the case. Chikatilo himself repeated his earlier remarks as to the judge making numerous rash remarks prejudging his guilt. The prosecutor, Nikolai Gerasimenko, vocally supported the defence's claim, stating that the judge had indeed made too many such comments and had committed numerous procedural violations in his lecturing and insulting the defendant.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 236</ref> Gerasimenko further contended that in his conducting an open trial, Chikatilo had already been effectively prejudged as being guilty by the press,<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 273</ref> before also requesting that the judge be replaced.<ref>''Comrade Chikatilo'', p. 274</ref>{{refn|group=n|Judge Akubzhanov would later rule that the prosecutor be replaced instead, briefly conducting the trial in the absence of a prosecutor until a replacement prosecutor, Anatoly Zadorozhny, could be found.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 239</ref>}}\n\nOn 3 July, Bukhanovsky was permitted to testify as to his analysis of Chikatilo, although solely in the [[capacity (law)|capacity]] as a witness. For three hours, Bukhanovsky testified as to his 1985 psychological profile of Chikatilo, and of the conversations he had held with Chikatilo following his arrest, which had culminated in Chikatilo's confession. Four psychiatric experts from the Serbsky Institute also testified as to the results of a [[Behaviorism|behavioral analysis]] they had conducted on Chikatilo in May, following the initial adjournment of the trial. All testified as to his behaviour in the courtroom being strikingly at contrast to his behaviour in his cell, and that they considered his antics to be a calculated attempt to obtain acquittal on the grounds of insanity.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', pp. 240-241</ref>\n\n===Closing arguments and conviction===\nOn 9 August, the defence delivered their [[closing argument]]s before the judge. Upon beginning his 90-minute closing argument, Marat Khabibulin first stated he had no confidence his voice would be heard above the \"general outcry\" for retribution against Chikatilo, before questioning the reliability of the forensic evidence presented at the trial, and describing areas of Chikatilo's confessions as being \"baseless\". Khabibulin also questioned the judge's [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], and harked back to the decision of the court not to allow the defence to present testimony from independent psychiatrists; emphasizing that crimes of this nature could not have been committed by an individual of sane mind. Khabibulin then formally requested the judge find his client not guilty.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 246</ref>\n\nThe following day, prosecutor Anatoly Zadorozhny delivered his closing argument before the judge. Harking towards the earlier testimony of psychiatrists at the trial, Zadorozhny argued that Chikatilo fully understood the criminality of his actions, was able to resist his homicidal impulses, and had made numerous conscious efforts to avoid detection. Moreover, Zadorozhny emphasized that in 19 of the charges, the material evidence of the crimes had been provided by Chikatilo himself. Zadorozhny then recited each of the charges before formally requesting the death penalty.{{refn|group=n|Chikatilo was not present in the courtroom throughout the prosecutor's closing argument, having again interrupted court proceedings.}}\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the prosecutor's closing argument, Judge Akubzhanov invited Chikatilo back into the courtroom, before formally asking him whether he would like to make a final statement on his own behalf. In response, Chikatilo simply sat mute.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 241\">''The Red Ripper'', p. 241</ref> Judge Akubzhanov then announced an initial date of 15 September for himself and the two official jurors to review the evidence and pass [[Sentence (law)|final sentence]] upon Chikatilo.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 242</ref> (This date was later postponed until 14 October.)<ref>''The Killer Department'', pp. 245\u201346</ref> As court announced recess, the brother of Lyudmila Alekseyeva, a 17-year-old girl killed by Chikatilo in August 1984, threw a heavy chunk of metal at Chikatilo, hitting him in the chest.<ref name=\"The Red Ripper, p. 241\"/> When security tried to arrest the young man, other victims' relatives shielded him.<ref>Murder in Mind issue 7 p. 36</ref>\n\nOn 14 October, the court reconvened to hear formal sentencing (this sentencing would not finish until the following day). Judge Akubzhanov began sentencing by announcing Chikatilo guilty of 52 of the 53 murders for which he had been tried.<ref>{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Conradi|url=http://old.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/tmt/218388.html|title=A Short Path to Murder|access-date=28 September 2018|newspaper=[[The Moscow Times]]|publisher=Moscow Times LLC|location=Moscow, Russia|date=26 May 1993|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929075945/http://old.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/tmt/218388.html#|archive-date=29 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> He was sentenced to death for each offense. Chikatilo was also found guilty of five counts of sexual assault committed during the years he worked as a teacher in the 1970s. In reciting his findings, the judge read the list of murders again, before criticizing both the police and the prosecutor's department for various mistakes in the investigation which had allowed Chikatilo to remain free until 1990.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', pp. 244\u201348</ref> Particular criticism was directed towards not local police, but the prosecutor's department\u2014primarily procurator Issa Kostoyev\u2014whom Judge Akubzhanov scathed as \"negligent\", and who had been dismissive of Chikatilo's inclusion upon a 1987 suspect list compiled by police. Akubzhanov also rejected the numerous claims Kostoyev had made to the media in the months prior to the trial that police had deliberately withheld documents pertaining to Chikatilo from the prosecutor's department as being provably baseless, adding that proof existed he had been in possession of all internal bulletins.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 247</ref>{{refn|group=n|Akubzhanov would subsequently write to both the Public Prosecutor of Russia and the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)#Russian Federation|Ministry of the Interior]], urging both bodies to adopt sufficient measures in order to prevent a repetition of such negligence and incompetence by the prosecutor's department.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', pp. 246-247</ref>}}\n\nOn 15 October, Judge Akubzhanov formally sentenced Chikatilo to death plus 86 years for the 52 murders and five counts of sexual assault for which he had been found guilty. Chikatilo kicked his bench across his cage when he heard the verdict, and began shouting abuse.<ref>{{cite news|first=Wendy|last=Sloane|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=886&dat=19921015&id=rrE0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=qn0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4816,1957003&hl=en/|title=Soviet Serial Killer is Sentenced to Life Term|newspaper=[[The Prescott Courier]]|publisher=[[Western Newspapers]]|location=Prescott, Arizona|date=15 October 1992|access-date=18 July 2016}}</ref> However, when given an opportunity to make a speech in response to the verdict, he again remained silent.<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 249</ref> Upon passing final sentence, Judge Akubzhanov made the following remark:\n{{quote|Taking into consideration the horrible misdeeds of which he is guilty, this court has no alternative but to impose the only sentence that he deserves. I therefore sentence him to death.}}\nChikatilo was taken from the courtroom to his cell at Novocherkassk prison to await execution. He did lodge an [[appeal]] against his conviction with the [[Russian Supreme Court]], but this appeal was rejected in the summer of 1993.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 259</ref>{{refn|group=n|The decision of the [[Russian Supreme Court]] at this appeal was that Chikatilo's guilt of 9 of the 52 murders\u2014those of Zakotnova, Tkachenko, Pozhidaev, Stalmachenok, Shalopinina, Tsana, Bilovetsky, Voronko and Kravchenko\u2014was not sufficiently proven.

In his confessions to police, Chikatilo had stated he had killed an Armenian girl in the early summer of 1983 and that she had been killed in a stretch of woodland located near Kirpichnaya station. Although Chikatilo had been unable to identify Sarkisyan's picture when presented to him, the timing of Sarkisyan's disappearance and Chikatilo's physical description of the victim, her clothing, and where he had killed her did match scattered, partial skeletal remains and personal effects which, although determined as being those of a female in her early- to mid-teens, could not be precisely identified.<ref>''The Killer Department'', p. 249</ref>\n\nAlthough he had at one stage denied having committed six of the murders for which he had been brought to trial, Chikatilo never specifically disputed Sarkisyan as being a victim of his.\n\n===Suspected victims===\n* Chikatilo confessed to three additional murders which police were unable to verify.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/30/world/the-man-in-the-iron-cage-a-russian-horror-story.html/|title=The Man in the Iron Cage: A Russian Horror Story|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 July 1992|access-date=30 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829110611/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/30/world/the-man-in-the-iron-cage-a-russian-horror-story.html#|archive-date=29 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Chikatilo, these three murders were committed in and around the city of Shakhty between 1980 and 1982. Despite his confessions, police were unable to either match his descriptions of these victims to any missing persons reports,<ref>''The Red Ripper'', p. 205</ref> or locate any human remains, despite thoroughly searching the locations where Chikatilo stated he had committed these murders. Therefore, he was never charged with these three further killings he claimed to have committed.\n* Chikatilo is the prime suspect in the murder of 18-year-old Irina Pogoryelova, a court secretary from Bataysk who had disappeared on 11 August 1986 and whose body was found buried in the grounds of a collective farm on 18 August. Pogoryelova's body bore precisely the same mutilations found upon victims Chikatilo killed both before and after 1986. In his initial confession, Chikatilo had denied he had killed Pogoryelova, yet later insisted at his trial he had indeed killed her.\n* At his trial, Chikatilo claimed he had committed four further murders in addition to the 53 for which he was brought to trial. Presumably, three of these victims were the three he had initially confessed to having committed in 1990 and which the police were unable to either locate or match to any missing persons records, the fourth individual he specifically named as Irina Pogoryelova. If his claims of having killed four additional victims are true, the total number of victims Chikatilo claimed is 57.\n\n==Media==\n<!---\n PLEASE DO NOT ADD SONG REFERENCES, SONGS ABOUT HIM, DEPICTIONS ON TV SHOWS LIKE THE SIMPSONS OR OTHER TRIVIA HERE.

Inspired by Robert Cullen's non-fiction book ''[[The Killer Department]]'', ''Citizen X'' largely portrays the investigation of the \"Rostov Ripper\" murders through the experiences of Detective Viktor Burakov, in his efforts to ensnare the killer. This film casts [[Stephen Rea]] as Viktor Burakov, [[Jeffrey DeMunn]] as Andrei Chikatilo, [[Donald Sutherland]] as Colonel Mikhail Fetisov, and [[Max von Sydow]] as Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky. One of the film's central themes is the Soviet government's refusal to acknowledge the existence of a serial killer in USSR, until [[Perestroika]].<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/25/arts/television-review-a-soviet-serial-murderer.html</ref>\n* The film ''[[Evilenko]]'' (2004) is loosely based upon the murders committed by Andrei Chikatilo. This film casts [[Malcolm McDowell]] as Andrei Evilenko and [[Marton Csokas]] as Inspector Lesev.\n* The film ''[[Child 44 (film)|Child 44]]'' (2015) is based upon the fiction novel ''[[Child 44]]'' by [[Tom Rob Smith]], which was itself inspired by the Andrei Chikatilo case. The film was released in April 2015, and stars [[Tom Hardy]] as Leo Demidov, [[Joel Kinnaman]] as Vasili Nikitin, [[Noomi Rapace]] as Raisa Demidova, and [[Gary Oldman]] as General Timur Nesterov.\n\n===Books (factual)===\nFour non-fiction books have been written about the case of Andrei Chikatilo:\n* {{cite book|author=[[Peter Conradi|Conradi, Peter]] |date=1992|publisher=True Crime| title=The Red Ripper: Inside the Mind of Russia's Most Brutal Serial Killer|isbn= 0-86369-618-X}}\n* {{cite book|author=Cullen, Robert |date=1993|publisher=Orion Media| title=[[The Killer Department]]: Detective Viktor Burakov's Eight-Year Hunt for the Most Savage Serial Killer of Our Times|isbn= 1-85797-210-4}}\n* {{cite book|authors=Krivich, Mikhail & Olgin, Olgert|publisher=Barricade Books|date=1993|title=Comrade Chikatilo: The Psychopathology of Russia's Notorious Serial Killer|isbn=0-942-63790-9|url=https://archive.org/details/comradechikatilo00kriv}}\n* {{cite book|author=Lourie, Richard |date=1993| publisher=HarperCollins| title=Hunting The Devil: The Pursuit, Capture and Confession of the Most Savage Serial Killer in History|isbn= 0-586-21846-7}}\n\n===Television===\n* ''Criminal Russia: The Trail of Satan'' (1997).

She removed her claim of being certified in psychiatry and [[psychosomatic medicine]] from her website after Heimlich's research was made public.{{R|Beast1}}\n\nBrogan wrote about health on [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]'s [[Goop (company)|Goop]] retail website and was featured on expert panels at several Goop events.{{R|Ind1}}{{R|Forb1}}{{R|Jez1}}{{R|McL1}}\n\n==Alternative medicine controversies==\n\nBrogan promotes the belief that human diseases are caused not by [[Pathogen|infectious agents]], but rather by psychological factors. She mocks the well-established notion of \"little invisible pathogens, you know, that randomly jump around from person to person\".{{R|Ind1}}{{R|Beast1}}{{R|Forb1}}{{R|ES1}}\n\nIn March 2020, during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Brogan indicated at length that, in her opinion, the virus may not exist. According to her, it's rather the fear of a virus that makes people sick and die. She referred her followers to the [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] claims of [[Joseph Mercola]] and [[Ryke Geerd Hamer]] on the topic. [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[Vimeo]] and [[Instagram]] removed Brogan's videos, presumably as part of their efforts to limit the spread of misinformation during the epidemic, a move Brogan described as \"censorship\".{{R|Ind1}}{{R|Beast1}}{{R|ES1}}{{R|LA1}}\n\nBrogan's claims about the cause of diseases, as have Hamer's and Mercola's, have been debunked by medical experts as dangerous misconceptions.{{R|Beast1}}\n\nOn that occasion and others prior, she accused the government of being controlled by pro-vaccination \"elites\" with a sinister agenda. She suggested the pandemic was a ploy by the United States government to force vaccination on people and usher in totalitarian measures.{{R|Ind1}}{{R|Beast1}}{{R|ES1}} Investigator [[Benjamin Radford]] attributes Brogan's theories to a wider phenomenon of self-styled populist health experts inciting people to reject science and embrace their own theories.{{R|Beast1}}\n\nIn a similar vein, Brogan [[HIV/AIDS denialism|attributed the death of AIDS patients not to HIV]], but to treatments meant to fight it. Even though the link between HIV and AIDS is clearly established by medical research, she calls it an \"assumption\". She also defended the disproven belief that intestinal bacteria cause depression; Brogan invites people to stop taking [[antidepressant]]s and use the techniques and products from her website instead.{{R|Forb1}}{{R|Jez1}}{{R|McL1}}{{R|NW1}}{{R|SBM1}} Through her website, Brogan offers a subscription-only \"lifestyle medicine\" community space and access to self-improvement training resources.{{R|Brog1}}\n\nShe also promotes many of the usual [[Vaccine hesitancy|erroneous claims against vaccines]], notably that the immunity gained from surviving an infectious disease is superior to the one generated by being vaccinated. She also denies [[polio]] was eradicated by vaccination.{{R|Forb1}}{{R|Jez1}}{{R|ES1}}{{R|SBM1}}{{R|NW2}}\n\nDespite [[coffee enema]]s being long discredited as medical procedures, Brogan promotes them for depression.{{R|McL1}}{{R|coffee}}\n\n==Personal life==\n\nBrogan lives in Florida{{R|Beast1}} and has two children.{{R|Goop1}}\n\n==Books==\n\n* {{Cite book|last=Brogan|first=Kelly|title=Own

{{URL|kellybroganmd.com}} \n}}\n{{Alternative medical systems|fringe}}\n\n'''Kelly Brogan''' is an American [[psychiatrist]], author of books on [[alternative medicine]] and a promoter of discredited medical theories. \n\n==Background and credentials==\n\nBrogan graduated from [[Weill Cornell Medicine|Cornell University Medical College]] in Psychiatry, and has a B.S. in Systems Neuroscience from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].{{R|Goop1}} She uses the title of \"holistic psychiatrist\".{{R|Ind1}}\n\n[[Quackery|Medical fraud]] researcher Peter Heimlich points out Brogan appears to have failed to maintain certification with the [[American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology]], according to the association's database. She removed her claim of being certified in psychiatry and [[psychosomatic medicine]] from her website after Heimlich's research was made public.{{R|Beast1}}\n\nBrogan wrote about health on [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]'s [[Goop (company)|Goop]] retail website and was featured on expert panels at several Goop events.{{R|Ind1}}{{R|Forb1}}{{R|Jez1}}{{R|McL1}}\n\n==Alternative medicine controversies==\n\nBrogan promotes the belief that human diseases are caused not by [[Pathogen|infectious agents]], but rather by psychological factors. She mocks the well-established notion of \"little invisible pathogens, you know, that randomly jump around from person to person\".{{R|Ind1}}{{R|Beast1}}{{R|Forb1}}{{R|ES1}}\n\nIn March 2020, during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Brogan indicated at length that, in her opinion, the virus may not exist. According to her, it's rather the fear of a virus that makes people sick and die. She referred her followers to the [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] claims of [[Joseph Mercola]] and [[Ryke Geerd Hamer]] on the topic. [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[Vimeo]] and [[Instagram]] removed Brogan's videos, presumably as part of their efforts to limit the spread of misinformation during the epidemic, a move Brogan described as \"censorship\".{{R|Ind1}}{{R|Beast1}}{{R|ES1}}{{R|LA1}}\n\nBrogan's claims about the cause of diseases, as have Hamer's and Mercola's, have been debunked by medical experts as dangerous misconceptions.{{R|Beast1}}\n\nOn that occasion and others prior, she accused the government of being controlled by pro-vaccination \"elites\" with a sinister agenda. She suggested the pandemic was a ploy by the United States government to force vaccination on people and usher in totalitarian measures.{{R|Ind1}}{{R|Beast1}}{{R|ES1}} Investigator [[Benjamin Radford]] attributes Brogan's theories to a wider phenomenon of self-styled populist health experts inciting people to reject science and embrace their own theories.{{R|Beast1}}\n\nIn a similar vein, Brogan [[HIV/AIDS denialism|attributed the death of AIDS patients not to HIV]], but to treatments meant to fight it. Even though the link between HIV and AIDS is clearly established by medical research, she calls it an \"assumption\". She also defended the disproven belief that intestinal bacteria cause depression; Brogan invites people to stop taking [[antidepressant]]s and use the techniques and products from her website instead.{{R|Forb1}}{{R|Jez1}}{{R|McL1}}{{R|NW1}}{{R|SBM1}} Through her website, Brogan offers a subscription-only \"lifestyle medicine\" community space and access to self-improvement training resources.{{R|Brog1}}\n\nShe also promotes many of the usual [[Vaccine hesitancy|erroneous claims against vaccines]], notably that the immunity gained from surviving an infectious disease is superior to the one generated by being vaccinated. She also denies [[polio]] was eradicated by vaccination.{{R|Forb1}}{{R|Jez1}}{{R|ES1}}{{R|SBM1}}{{R|NW2}}\n\nDespite [[Coffee enema|coffee enemas]] being long discredited as medical procedures, Brogan promotes them for depression.{{R|McL1}}{{R|coffee}}\n\n==Personal life==\n\nBrogan lives in Florida{{R|Beast1}} and has two children.{{R|Goop1}}\n\n==Books==\n\n* {{Cite

innovate responses including diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines; use the evidence to inform the development of the most effective models of care\n*Mitigate: provide the best care possible for people who become ill, support hospitals to maintain essential services and ensure ongoing support for people ill in the community, to minimise the overall impact of the disease on society, public services and on the economy.<ref name=\"Plan2020\">Department of Health and Social Care, Emergency and Health Protection Directorate, [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/869827/Coronavirus_action_plan_-_a_guide_to_what_you_can_expect_across_the_UK.pdf Coronavirus: action plan: A guide to what you can expect across the UK] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304131952/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/869827/Coronavirus_action_plan_-_a_guide_to_what_you_can_expect_across_the_UK.pdf|date=4 March 2020}}, published 3 March, accessed 7 March 2020</ref>\n\nThe four UK CMOs raised the UK risk level from low to moderate on 30 January 2020, upon the WHO's announcement of the disease as a [[Public Health Emergency of International Concern]].<ref name=\"gov.uk2Update\" /><ref name=\"Russell13Feb2020\" /> As soon as cases appeared in the UK on 31 January 2020, a public health information campaign, similar to the previous \"[[Catch it, Bin it, Kill it]]\" campaign, was launched in the UK, to advise people how to lessen the risk of spreading the virus.<ref name=\"Russell13Feb2020\" /> Travellers from Hubei province in China, including the capital Wuhan were advised to self-isolate, \"stay at home, not go to work, school or public places, not use public transport or taxis, ask friends, family members or delivery services to do errands\",<ref name=\"NHS.ukCOVID\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/|title=Coronavirus (COVID-19)|last=|first=|date=24 January 2020|website=nhs.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302222456/https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/|archive-date=2 March 2020|access-date=4 March 2020}}</ref> and call [[NHS 111]] if they had arrived in the UK in previous 14 days, regardless of whether they were unwell or not.<ref name=\"Russell13Feb2020\" /> Further cases in early February prompted the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, to announce the [[Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020]].<ref name=\"gov.uk2Update\" /> Daily updates have been published by the DHSC.<ref name=\"gov.uk2Update\" /> [[NHS Digital]] in the meanwhile, have been collecting data.<ref name=\"RapsonHSJ\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/patient-safety/nhs-collecting-coronavirus-data-from-111-calls/7026999.article|title=NHS collecting coronavirus data from 111 calls|last=Rapson|first=Jasmine|date=|website=Health Service Journal|url-access=subscription|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 March 2020}}</ref>\n[[File:Catch it, Bin it, Kill it poster.jpg|thumb|upright|Poster for the \"Catch it, Bin it, Kill it\" slogan which has been revived in the fight against coronavirus]]\nOn 25 February 2020, the UK's CMOs advice for all travellers (unwell or not) who had returned to the UK from Hubei province in the previous 14 days, Iran, specific areas designated by the Italian government as quarantine areas in northern Italy and special care zones in South Korea since 19 February, to self-isolate and call NHS 111.<ref name=\"gov.uk15Feb2020\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-staff-in-the-transport-sector/covid-19-guidance-for-staff-in-the-transport-sector|title=COVID-19: guidance for staff in the transport sector|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220133756/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-staff-in-the-transport-sector/covid-19-guidance-for-staff-in-the-transport-sector|archive-date=20 February 2020|access-date=15 February 2020}}</ref> This advice was also advocated for any person who has flu-like symptoms with a history of travelling from Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and areas in Italy north of Pisa, Florence and Rimini, returning to the UK since 19 February.

Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point, government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modeling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self-isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that

Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that

He proposed that the Buddha likely sought insights because he was involved in \"making peace among tribes\".<ref name=\"Jacobsen2015p361\"/>\n\n;[[Four Noble Truths]]\nAmbedkar believed that this core doctrine of Buddhism was flawed because it denied hope to human beings. According to Ambedkar, the Four Noble Truths is a \"gospel of pessimism\", and may have been inserted into the Buddhist scriptures by wrong headed Buddhist monks of a later era.

In one instance Ambedkar presents a dialogue in which the Buddha teaches that the root of dukkha is class conflict and asserts elsewhere that \"the Buddha's conception of Dukkha is material.\" \nNibbana (Skt. [[nirvana]]) the state or process which describes enlightenment, is considered [by Ambedkar] a precursor for moral action in the world and explicitly associated with a non-monastic lifestyle. Nibbana \"means enough control over passion so as to enable one to walk on the path of righteousness.\" Ambedkar's interpretation of dukkha and nibbana implies that moral action, for which nibbana is preparation, will rectify the material suffering of inequality.\n|Anne Blackburn|''Religion, Kinship and Buddhism: Ambedkar's Vision of a Moral Community''<ref name=blackburn1/>}}\n\nAmbedkar considered all ideas in Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism that relate to an individual's merit and spiritual development as insertions into Buddhism, and something that \"cannot be accepted to be the word of the Buddha\". Buddhism, to Ambedkar, must have been a social reform movement.<ref name=blackburn1/><ref name=zelliot134/> Martin Fuchs states that Ambedkar's effort is to be admired as an attempt to seek a \"post-religious religion\" which transcends distinctions and as being driven by the \"reasonable principle of sociality\", not in the sense of spiritual doctrines, philosophical speculations and existentialist questions.<ref>Martin Fuchs (2001), \"A religion for civil society?

In one instance Ambedkar presents a dialogue in which the Buddha teaches that the root of dukkha is class conflict and asserts elsewhere that \"the Buddha's conception of Dukkha is material.\" \nNibbana (Skt. [[nirvana]]) the state or process which describes enlightenment, is considered [by Ambedkar] a precursor for moral action in the world and explicitly associated with a non-monastic lifestyle. Nibbana \"means enough control over passion so as to enable one to walk on the path of righteousness.\" Ambedkar's interpretation of dukkha and nibbana implies that moral action, for which nibbana is preparation, will rectify the material suffering of inequality.\n|Anne Blackburn|''Religion, Kinship and Buddhism: Ambedkar's Vision of a Moral Community''<ref name=blackburn1/>}}\n\nAmbedkar considered all ideas in Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism that relate to an individual's merit and spiritual development as insertions into Buddhism, and something that \"cannot be accepted to be the word of the Buddha\". Buddhism, to Ambedkar, must have been a social reform movement.<ref name=blackburn1/><ref name=zelliot134/> Martin Fuchs states that Ambedkar's effort is to be admired as an attempt to seek a \"post-religious religion\" which transcends distinctions and as being driven by the \"reasonable principle of sociality\", not in the sense of spiritual doctrines, philosophical speculations and existentialist questions.<ref>Martin Fuchs (2001), \"A religion for civil society?

It was subsequently replaced by a more modern twin choke 38 DGAS Weber carburetor which effectively solved the problems of the earlier carburetors, and was used for the 3-Litre V6 until the end of its production.<ref name=\"ford-capri.ch\"/> The 2.5-litre V6 used a single barrel Ford carburetor which was also used in the low compression variants of the 3.0-litre Essex V6 used in the Ford Transit. Unusually, the Essex V6 was designed so that the same block could serve in both [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] (compression ignition) and [[petrol]] applications, although the diesel version never reached production. Traces of its diesel design lie in the very heavy construction using [[Heron cylinder head]]s and the necessity for dished [[piston]]s to decrease [[compression ratio|compression]] for the petrol engine. The [[cast iron]] Essex V6 is a heavy engine due to its sturdy design weighing in at {{convert|170|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, {{convert|56|lb|kg|abbr=on}} more than the aluminum alloy [[Rover V8]], for example,<ref>http://www.gomog.com/allmorgan/engineweights.html</ref> the Essex V6 also has a very heavy yet sturdy four-main bearing crossplane crankshaft with large {{convert|63.52|mm|in|abbr=on}} main journals,<ref>http://www.burtonpower.com/main-bearing-set-std-with-std-od-housing-ford-essex-v6-vp91247-std.html</ref> and a heavy flywheel in order to smooth out the power delivery, sometimes Essex V6 engines are referred to as an \"Essex Lump\" referring to the weight of these engines. In spite of its heaviness, the Essex V6 was used as the main workhorse and a high performance option for medium to full-sized cars like the [[Ford Capri|Capri]] the [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Granada]] and [[Ford Transit|Transit]] vans supplied by Ford to the Police and Ambulance services in the UK throughout the late 1960s and 1970s and up until 1989 in the case of the [[Ford Transit|Transit]] where it was later replaced by more modern engines such as the fuel injected 2.8 and 2.9 L [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]] and was even used until April 2000 in South Africa.\n \n[[TVR]] contracted the company [[Broadspeed]] to develop a turbocharging system for their TVR 3000S Turbo. In lieu of [[fuel injection]], the carburettor was run inside a pressurized box atop the engine, and the turbocharger itself was mounted low and forward in the engine compartment, requiring the exhaust manifolds to exit forward. The compression ratio was lowered from 9.0:1 to 8.0:1 to reduce the engine's internal stresses. Turbocharging substantially increased horsepower, from {{convert|138|to|230|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} and torque from {{convert|182|to|273|lbft|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nBroadspeed also designed a turbocharging system For the Mk1 Ford Capri 3.0, available since early 1970<ref name=\"caprimk1register.com\">http://www.caprimk1register.com/history.stm</ref> these Capris were known as Broadspeed Bullett Capris, the engine was heavily modified and included modified cylinder heads, a high lift camshaft, a re jetted carburetor, a completely blueprinted rotating assembly, lowered 8.2:1 compression ratio, a modified inlet manifold and exhaust system using a single turbocharger.<ref>https://www.flickr.com/photos/134498023@N03/29317008125/in/photostream/</ref> Their power was substantially increased (by 63%) from {{convert|138|to|218|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}}. Similar to the TVR 3000S' turbocharging system, it used a \"Blow through Carburetor\" system in which the standard but re-jetted 38 DGAS Weber carburetor was run inside a pressurized box, performance figures further increased with the uprated post-October 1971 versions of the engine.<ref name=\"caprimk1register.com\"/> The company Janspeed, well known for their high performance exhaust systems also designed a turbocharging system for the Ford Essex 3.0 L and 1.6 - 2.0 L OHC engines, although these were much simpler than the turbocharging system offered by Broadspeed, Janspeed promised a 25% increase in horsepower boosting the engine's power output from {{convert|138|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} to around {{convert|172|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} using a single Roto-Master turbocharger mounted directly on top of the left bank of the engine providing {{convert|5|psi|bar|abbr=on}} of boost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capripower.co.uk/boardold/lofiversion/index.php?t4032.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119074035/http://www.capripower.co.uk/boardold/lofiversion/index.php?t4032.html |archivedate=2016-01-19 }}</ref>\n\nThe 2.5&nbsp;L and 3.0&nbsp;L engines share the same block, connecting rods and {{convert|93.66|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} bore, differing only in [[crankshaft|crank]] throw and pistons, 3.0 L pistons have a length of {{convert|95|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} and 2.5 L pistons have a length of {{convert|100|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} / {{convert|101|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}\n.<ref name=\"duttonowners.ning.com\"/>\n\nCompanies like Specialised Engines, Essex engines and Ric Wood have professionally built and developed large displacement 3.2 L, 3.4 L and even 4.0 L Conversions and forced induction conversions for the Essex V6 with power outputs reaching as high as {{convert|390|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n<ref>http://www.essexengines.com/ford%20essex%203.4%20litre%20v6%20engine.htm</ref>\n<ref>http://www.specialisedengines.co.uk/engine-services/3-0-essex-capri-consul-granada-zephyr-and-zodiac</ref>\n<ref>http://www.ricwood.com/essexv6.html</ref>\n\n==US emissions certification==\n\nIn 1977, Californian company Olson Engineering, Inc. was contracted by [[TVR]] to design modifications to the Essex V6 such that it could be emissions-certified for use in the [[United States]]. This allowed TVR to sell its Essex-engined [[TVR M Series|M Series]] cars in that market for the 1978 and 1979 model years. An owner's handbook supplement for US Federal models indicates that the emissions control system used a catalytic converter, [[exhaust gas recirculation]], and secondary air injection. A shipment of approximately twenty 3000Ss arrived in September 1979, and were marked by the import company as being emissions compliant without the Olson Engineering emissions kit actually having been fitted. Dealers were made aware of this fact, but were each apparently coerced into buying at least two of the non-compliant cars with the threat of withholding spare parts for other TVR models. One dealer explained the situation to a customer who happened to work for the US government in an emissions-regulation capacity, and he reported the violation to the authorities. The cars were then impounded. During the long period of time during which Martin Lilley attempted to communicate with US customs officials to resolve the situation, the cars were neglected and stored outside, where they deteriorated and were vandalized. The cars were eventually re-exported, repaired, and sold in Germany, but the short-term financial impact of the unsalable cars (worth over \u00a3100,000 in total) was damaging to the development of the M Series replacement, the Tasmin.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hayes |first=Russel |title=TVR: Ever the Extrovert |publisher=Haynes Publishing |date=August 2009 |isbn=978-1-84425-507-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Tipler |first=John |title=TVR: The Complete Story |publisher=The Crowood Press Ltd. |year=1994 |isbn=1-85223-796-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Filby |first=Peter |title=TVR: A Passion to Succeed |publisher=Autocraft Books |date=July 2012 |isbn=978-0-9545729-2-1}}</ref>\n\n==South Africa==\n\nIn South Africa, the engine continued in production from 1982 up to April 2000 for use in the Sapphire Saloon and Sierra vehicles, and Courier pick-ups.  Late in its production life it was fitted with Lucas controlled electronic [[fuel injection]] designed by SAMCOR (South African Motor Corporation - now Ford SA) in co-operation with the University of Pretoria's engineering department. This conversion resulted in a power increase from {{convert|103|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|110|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} of the standard 3.0 version, and {{convert|117|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} for the fuel injection version, plus a useful boost to [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]]. Only about 1,600 of the EFI variants were produced during 1992 and 1993. In October 1997, the 3.0L was enlarged to 3.4L by boring the cylinders {{convert|1|to|94.6|mm|abbr=on}} and a new crankshaft with a stroke of {{convert|80|mm|2|abbr=on}} giving a displacement of {{convert|3375|cc|L|1|order=flip|abbr=on}}, this was done for the engine to be better suited to 4x4 vehicles where torque is needed. The 3.4 version produced {{convert|108|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|260|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}. All 3.4 variants used the 38DGAS Weber carburetor with {{convert|29|mm|in|abbr=on}} venturis. Production tooling at the factory was scrapped and sold in 2000, to make way for the production of a new four cylinder OHC engine, the remaining old stock of 3.4 L Engines started to be sold as assembled crate engines, these engines had some differences from the 2.5 3.0 and 3.1 L Dagenham built engines such as: Ford Cologne 2.8 / 2.9 V6 forged connecting rods, German made pistons with moly coating, {{convert|1/4|in|abbr=on}} smaller crank journals which reduced bearing speed, more aggressive camshaft timing and higher lift, larger {{convert|43|mm|abbr=on}} inlet valves, shaft mounted rockers from Ford's Cologne 2.8 / 2.9 V6 engine, unique cylinder head castings with extra oil galleries, solid [[pushrod]]s with no oiling holes, unique exhaust manifold bolt pattern due to the head castings also being unique to the 3.4-litre engine and an improved inlet manifold with larger runners and an improved plenum chamber.<ref>http://www.scimitarweb.co.uk/sgwrs/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=10292&start=120</ref> From 1966 to 1998, the 3.0L was also used in industrial applications such as generator plants, airport vehicles, milk vans, jet boats (Hamilton jet) and even river barges.\n\n== Vehicles using the Essex V6 ==\n\nThe Essex V6 was fitted to a wide variety of cars, both from Ford and from smaller specialist manufacturers that used Ford engines.

It is closely related to the [[Ford Essex V4 engine]] produced in displacements of 1.7 L and 2.0 L. Both engines share many parts since the Essex V6 was directly derived from the Essex V4, the 2.0 L Essex V4 and the 3.0 L Essex V6 in fact have exactly the same bore and stroke and share various components.<ref>http://www.ford-capri.ch/technics/technical-data-I/2000gt-69-73-e.html</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Essex V4 and V6 were mainly designed to replace the outdated and aging inline-four and six-cylinder [[Ford Zephyr engine]]. It was produced in four [[engine displacement|capacities]]: {{convert|2495|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on|disp=flip}}, {{convert|2994|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on|disp=flip}}, {{convert|3098|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on|disp=flip}}, {{convert|3412|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on|disp=flip}}, with the 3.0-litre version being the most common and widely used. These engines were fitted to a wide range of vehicles, from [[Ford Transit]] vans to sedans, [[coup\u00e9]]s like the [[Ford Capri]] and sports cars like TVR and Marcos. The earlier versions of engine were rated at {{convert|128|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|173|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque, around October 1971 the engine was revised by modifying the camshaft and cylinder heads that improved the power and torque to produce {{convert|157|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} [[SAE International|SAE]] or {{convert|138|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} [[DIN]] at 5000&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|192|lbft|0|abbr=on}} SAE or {{convert|174|lbft|0|abbr=on}} DIN of torque at 3000&nbsp;rpm.<ref name=\"flickr.com\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/granada_turnier/5084386551/in/photolist-8KhNZ6-2T4z9y-9BFrV5-dGNgLj-ahpucX-6wzQUp-dnxMHb-9JnhkM-6aRZwq-6UsWAo-dQBdFV-8umqAa-9BCbYR-b6FdPv-hAEaFb-bbN9ck-duVwEG-ahseVJ-8neTwp-hAzLig-9bxWHb-jw6uD-9gNrJG-4cVjJY-dGH2cR-dGNmaN-e7natG-e7ndR9-ktfuXG-b6FdQk-dGNgwq-9gNrxC-hAAM7C-8bGuZ7-2UDdpo-6wzQUn-ce9a4A-9P1Acs-8nAeaj-4cVjuW-8YyDCo-9D2Xgs-97tM61-9qW3pU-4mzLse-9qTgq2-xen86E-4pirrD-74hnUY-9qTg4x</ref> At the same time, the oil dipstick was moved from the front of the engine to the side, the inlet manifold was improved from earlier models, and the compression ratio was raised slightly from 8.9:1 to 9.0:1 due to a change of the piston design.<ref name=\"duttonowners.ning.com\">http://duttonowners.ning.com/photo/red-block?test-locale=&exposeKeys=&xg_pw=&xgsi=&id=2398922%3APhoto%3A57164&groupId=&groupUrl=&xgi=&page=1#comments</ref> The shape of the inlet ports were also changed, from an O-port design to a D-port design which improved the flow characteristics of the heads, the old 40 DFAV [[Weber carburetor]] that was prone to over-fueling and resulting bore wash was replaced by the 38 DGAS Weber Carburetor, the air filter housing was also changed and later around 1976 and a hot [[air intake]] was added consisting of a metal pipe running from the top of a plate welded on the [[exhaust manifold]] or header to an opening in the air intake to prevent the carburetor from icing and making the engine warm up quicker, the carburetor was also modified again and a return style fuel system was adopted and a vacuum operated choke in the air filter housing were also added, this and a Positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system were also early forms of emissions control.<ref name=HansTVR>{{cite web | url = http://www.tubetvr.com/essex.html | title = The Essex engine | work = Hans Pages | accessdate = 2015-04-09 | first = Hans | last = Beijner }}</ref> The camshaft gear was also made slightly stronger by using steel with nylon teeth instead of being completely made from nylon as on previous ones.

It was subsequently replaced by a more modern twin choke 38 DGAS Weber carburetor which effectively solved the problems of the earlier carburetors, and was used for the 3-Litre V6 until the end of its production.<ref name=\"ford-capri.ch\"/> The 2.5-litre V6 used a single barrel Ford carburetor which was also used in the low compression variants of the 3.0-litre Essex V6 used in the Ford Transit. Unusually, the Essex V6 was designed so that the same block could serve in both [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] (compression ignition) and [[petrol]] applications, although the diesel version never reached production. Traces of its diesel design lie in the very heavy construction using [[Heron cylinder head]]s and the necessity for dished [[piston]]s to decrease [[compression ratio|compression]] for the petrol engine. The [[cast iron]] Essex V6 is a heavy engine due to its sturdy design weighing in at {{convert|170|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, {{convert|56|lb|kg|abbr=on}} more than the aluminum alloy [[Rover V8]], for example,<ref>http://www.gomog.com/allmorgan/engineweights.html</ref> the Essex V6 also has a very heavy yet sturdy four-main bearing crossplane crankshaft with large {{convert|63.52|mm|in|abbr=on}} main journals,<ref>http://www.burtonpower.com/main-bearing-set-std-with-std-od-housing-ford-essex-v6-vp91247-std.html</ref> and a heavy flywheel in order to smooth out the power delivery, sometimes Essex V6 engines are referred to as an \"Essex Lump\" referring to the weight of these engines. In spite of its heaviness, the Essex V6 was used as the main workhorse and a high performance option for medium to full-sized cars like the [[Ford Capri|Capri]] the [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Granada]] and [[Ford Transit|Transit]] vans supplied by Ford to the Police and Ambulance services in the UK throughout the late 1960s and 1970s and up until 1989 in the case of the [[Ford Transit|Transit]] where it was later replaced by more modern engines such as the fuel injected 2.8 and 2.9 L [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]] and was even used until April 2000 in South Africa.\n \n[[TVR]] contracted the company [[Broadspeed]] to develop a turbocharging system for their TVR 3000S Turbo. In lieu of [[fuel injection]], the carburettor was run inside a pressurized box atop the engine, and the turbocharger itself was mounted low and forward in the engine compartment, requiring the exhaust manifolds to exit forward. The compression ratio was lowered from 9.0:1 to 8.0:1 to reduce the engine's internal stresses. Turbocharging substantially increased horsepower, from {{convert|138|to|230|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} and torque from {{convert|182|to|273|lbft|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nBroadspeed also designed a turbocharging system For the Mk1 Ford Capri 3.0, available since early 1970<ref name=\"caprimk1register.com\">http://www.caprimk1register.com/history.stm</ref> these Capris were known as Broadspeed Bullett Capris, the engine was heavily modified and included modified cylinder heads, a high lift camshaft, a re jetted carburetor, a completely blueprinted rotating assembly, lowered 8.2:1 compression ratio, a modified inlet manifold and exhaust system using a single turbocharger.<ref>https://www.flickr.com/photos/134498023@N03/29317008125/in/photostream/</ref> Their power was substantially increased (by 63%) from {{convert|138|to|218|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}}. Similar to the TVR 3000S' turbocharging system, it used a \"Blow through Carburetor\" system in which the standard but re-jetted 38 DGAS Weber carburetor was run inside a pressurized box, performance figures further increased with the uprated post-October 1971 versions of the engine.<ref name=\"caprimk1register.com\"/> The company Janspeed, well known for their high performance exhaust systems also designed a turbocharging system for the Ford Essex 3.0 L and 1.6 - 2.0 L OHC engines, although these were much simpler than the turbocharging system offered by Broadspeed, Janspeed promised a 25% increase in horsepower boosting the engine's power output from {{convert|138|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} to around {{convert|172|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} using a single Roto-Master turbocharger mounted directly on top of the left bank of the engine providing {{convert|5|psi|bar|abbr=on}} of boost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capripower.co.uk/boardold/lofiversion/index.php?t4032.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119074035/http://www.capripower.co.uk/boardold/lofiversion/index.php?t4032.html |archivedate=2016-01-19 }}</ref>\n\nThe 2.5&nbsp;L and 3.0&nbsp;L engines share the same block, connecting rods and {{convert|93.66|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} bore, differing only in [[crankshaft|crank]] throw and pistons, 3.0 L pistons have a length of {{convert|95|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} and 2.5 L pistons have a length of {{convert|100|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} / {{convert|101|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}\n.<ref name=\"duttonowners.ning.com\"/>\n\nCompanies like Specialised Engines, Essex engines and Ric Wood have professionally built and developed large displacement 3.2 L, 3.4 L and even 4.0 L Conversions and forced induction conversions for the Essex V6 with power outputs reaching as high as {{convert|390|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n<ref>http://www.essexengines.com/ford%20essex%203.4%20litre%20v6%20engine.htm</ref>\n<ref>http://www.specialisedengines.co.uk/engine-services/3-0-essex-capri-consul-granada-zephyr-and-zodiac</ref>\n<ref>http://www.ricwood.com/essexv6.html</ref>\n\n==US emissions certification==\n\nIn 1977, Californian company Olson Engineering, Inc. was contracted by [[TVR]] to design modifications to the Essex V6 such that it could be emissions-certified for use in the [[United States]]. This allowed TVR to sell its Essex-engined [[TVR M Series|M Series]] cars in that market for the 1978 and 1979 model years. An owner's handbook supplement for US Federal models indicates that the emissions control system used a catalytic converter, [[exhaust gas recirculation]], and secondary air injection. A shipment of approximately twenty 3000Ss arrived in September 1979, and were marked by the import company as being emissions compliant without the Olson Engineering emissions kit actually having been fitted. Dealers were made aware of this fact, but were each apparently coerced into buying at least two of the non-compliant cars with the threat of withholding spare parts for other TVR models. One dealer explained the situation to a customer who happened to work for the US government in an emissions-regulation capacity, and he reported the violation to the authorities. The cars were then impounded. During the long period of time during which Martin Lilley attempted to communicate with US customs officials to resolve the situation, the cars were neglected and stored outside, where they deteriorated and were vandalized. The cars were eventually re-exported, repaired, and sold in Germany, but the short-term financial impact of the unsalable cars (worth over \u00a3100,000 in total) was damaging to the development of the M Series replacement, the Tasmin.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hayes |first=Russel |title=TVR: Ever the Extrovert |publisher=Haynes Publishing |date=August 2009 |isbn=978-1-84425-507-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Tipler |first=John |title=TVR: The Complete Story |publisher=The Crowood Press Ltd. |year=1994 |isbn=1-85223-796-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Filby |first=Peter |title=TVR: A Passion to Succeed |publisher=Autocraft Books |date=July 2012 |isbn=978-0-9545729-2-1}}</ref>\n\n==South Africa==\n\nIn South Africa, the engine continued in production from 1982 up to April 2000 for use in the Sapphire Saloon and Sierra vehicles, and Courier pick-ups.  Late in its production life it was fitted with Lucas controlled electronic [[fuel injection]] designed by SAMCOR (South African Motor Corporation - now Ford SA) in co-operation with the University of Pretoria's engineering department. This conversion resulted in a power increase from {{convert|103|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|110|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} of the standard 3.0 version, and {{convert|117|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} for the fuel injection version, plus a useful boost to [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]]. Only about 1,600 of the EFI variants were produced during 1992 and 1993. In October 1997, the 3.0L was enlarged to 3.4L by boring the cylinders {{convert|1|to|94.6|mm|abbr=on}} and a new crankshaft with a stroke of {{convert|80|mm|2|abbr=on}} giving a displacement of {{convert|3375|cc|L|1|order=flip|abbr=on}}, this was done for the engine to be better suited to 4x4 vehicles where torque is needed. The 3.4 version produced {{convert|108|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|260|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}. All 3.4 variants used the 38DGAS Weber carburetor with {{convert|29|mm|in|abbr=on}} venturis. Production tooling at the factory was scrapped and sold in 2000, to make way for the production of a new four cylinder OHC engine, the remaining old stock of 3.4 L Engines started to be sold as assembled crate engines, these engines had some differences from the 2.5 3.0 and 3.1 L Dagenham built engines such as: Ford Cologne 2.8 / 2.9 V6 forged connecting rods, German made pistons with moly coating, {{convert|1/4|in|abbr=on}} smaller crank journals which reduced bearing speed, more aggressive camshaft timing and higher lift, larger {{convert|43|mm|abbr=on}} inlet valves, shaft mounted rockers from Ford's Cologne 2.8 / 2.9 V6 engine, unique cylinder head castings with extra oil galleries, solid [[pushrod]]s with no oiling holes, unique exhaust manifold bolt pattern due to the head castings also being unique to the 3.4-litre engine and an improved inlet manifold with larger runners and an improved plenum chamber.<ref>http://www.scimitarweb.co.uk/sgwrs/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=10292&start=120</ref> From 1966 to 1998, the 3.0L was also used in industrial applications such as generator plants, airport vehicles, milk vans, jet boats (Hamilton jet) and even river barges.\n\n== Vehicles using the Essex V6 ==\n\nThe Essex V6 was fitted to a wide variety of cars, both from Ford and from smaller specialist manufacturers that used Ford engines.
