After heavy fighting, and proposals to abandon Liang Province, this First Great Qiang Rebellion was quelled in 118.<ref>de Crespigny, p. 10\u201311.</ref> Efforts were made to resettle the province from 129 to 144, although large parts of Liang remained without effective government.<ref>de Crespigny, p. 11\u201312.</ref> General [[Duan Jiong]] conducted another successful campaign against Qiang rebels in 167\u2013169, committing a massacre at Shoot-Tiger Valley.<ref>de Crespigny, p. 13.</ref>\n\n=== End of Han rule ===\nIn 184, concurrent with the outbreak of the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] in large parts of China, the [[Liang Province rebellion]] commenced.<ref>de Crespigny, p. 14.</ref> Han campaigns to retake the area remained inconclusive, and by 189 Liangzhou was a de facto independent warlord state ruled by [[Han Sui]] and [[Ma Teng]].

Located approximately 30 miles (50&nbsp;km) east of London, it falls within the [[Borough of Basildon]] along with the original town of [[Basildon]], [[Billericay]], [[Laindon]] and [[Pitsea]]. However, parts of Wickford fall under neighbouring districts such as Chelmsford and Rochford.\n\nWickford has become a [[commuter town]], serving the City of London through [[Wickford railway station|its railway station's]] direct connection to [[Liverpool Street station]] through the [[Shenfield to Southend Line|Southend Victoria line]], on which a train to London takes approximately 40 minutes. The town can also be easily reached via the road network by the [[A127 road|A127]] between London and [[Southend-on-Sea]] or by the [[A130 road|A130]] from [[Chelmsford]].\n\nWickford is a fairly small town with a main high street including a range of shops. It also has a swimming pool, library, open-air market and a community centre within the vicinity of the town centre.\n\nWickford also incorporates a small estate called [[Shotgate]], which is home to many residents. Shotgate features a row of village shops and a children's play area and park.\n\n== History ==\nWickford has a history going back over two thousand years. There is evidence that the area itself was inhabited in [[prehistoric]] times probably by a tribe of Britons called [[Trinovantes]]. There was a Roman military marching camp on the Beauchamps Farm site, which was succeeded by a Roman villa. This is now the site of [[Beauchamps High School]]. This area on higher ground was the historic core of Wickford, the site of the manor house and the parish church of St Catherine's. Over time the commercial centre of Wickford has migrated westwards, towards the modern High Street on the other side of the [[River Crouch]].<ref name=time>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VZaIAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT5|title=Wickford and Around Through Time\n|last=Rayment|first=David|date=17 October 2013|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|accessdate=18 November 2015|isbn=9781445632254\n}}</ref>\n\nThe place-name Wickford is first attested in a Saxon charter of 995, where it appears as ''Wicford''.

This included turning the river into a concrete channel through the centre of the town, although this may be removed in the coming years, depending on the scale of the Wickford Masterplan (see below).\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Wickford river crouch.jpg|thumb|right|The [[River Crouch]] flows through Wickford in a concrete bank designed to protect the town from flooding.]]\nFor the most part, Wickford is flat and {{convert|10|m|ft}} above sea level. The highest point, on the outskirts of the town, is {{convert|74|m|ft}} above sea level. The [[River Crouch]] flows through the town, from the west to the east. The River Wick flows into the River Crouch from the south.\n\n===Wick Country Park===\nThe Wick Country Park comprises {{convert|50|acre|ha}} of former agricultural land, with over 2&nbsp;km (1 1/4 miles) of easy access trails around the site. The trails leads visitors past old hedgerows, the {{convert|5|acre|ha|adj=on}} lake, ponds, World War II pillboxes and recent woodland plantings, with bridges and boardwalks that allow the trails to continue over the North Benfleet brook.\n\n===Neighbouring towns and villages===\n* [[South Hanningfield]]\n* [[West Hanningfield]]\n* [[Rettendon]]\n* [[Runwell]]\n* [[Battlesbridge]]\n* [[Ramsden Crays]] \n* [[Rawreth]]\n* [[Crays Hill]]\n* [[Ramsden Bellhouse]]\n* [[Ramsden Heath]]\n* [[Downham, Essex|Downham]]\n* [[Shotgate]]\n* [[South Woodham Ferrers]]\n* [[Billericay]]\n* [[Basildon]]\n* [[Rayleigh, Essex|Rayleigh]]\n\n==The Master Plan==\n[[File:Riverside Place Wickford.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Riverside Place Phase 1 complete]]\n\nThe Wickford Masterplan was first unveiled at the Wickford Community Centre in December 2004 and published in November 2005 by DTZ Pieda Consulting,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basildon.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=1203&p=0|title=Wickford Masterplan 2005|accessdate=30 December 2009|publisher=Basildon Council}}</ref> at a budget of \u00a3125&nbsp;million,<ref name=\"echo1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/4312054.Wickford_masterplan_comes_a_step_closer/|title=Basildon Council accepts sole bidder for Wickford masterplan tender|date=23 April 2009|accessdate=30 December 2009|publisher=Echo}}</ref> and many of the developments are currently in progress. At the heart of the proposals is the redevelopment of the High Street, which will be redesigned to be the town's premier meeting place. The Masterplan would create new public spaces, enhance the retail environment through the renewal of retail floor space and bring the market into the street scene, promoting urban living above shops and on the existing market site.\n\nAdjacent to the River Crouch, a number of high quality residential developments promoted as the \"Town Centre Riverside Living\" complex would revitalise the riverside as a public asset and promotion of new eating and drinking opportunities. In addition, a new residential development to the west of Market Avenue will be constructed.\n\nPromoting the station entrances on both sides of the railway line as key gateways to Wickford are also key areas of the plan, which would enhance transport interchange facilities and bring forward the car park site on Station Road for development as a new [[multi-storey car park]] and [[mixed-use development]]. As of present only the northern side of the station facing The Broadway is easily accessible, with the southern London-bound track only accessible from the outside though a small out-of-way footpath from Market Avenue as a courteous entrance for wheelchair-using passengers.\n\nPublic and health services would be improved under the scheme, with the re-organisation of existing health, library and community services into a new 'iconic' building to the east of Market Avenue as an integrated community service facility.\n\nThe Eastern Extension would create a better presence and new linkages to the east of the town centre by redeveloping the car park into a multi-storey development with residential and live-work uses and a new housing scheme to the east of Wickford Bypass. The Southern Gateway area, which surrounds London Road and the southern end of the High Street, are also planned to undergo a transition with a strong leisure and recreational theme, building on existing eating and drinking facilities and incorporating compatible residential uses.\n\nOverall 650 apartments are planned to be built as part of the Masterplan as officially stated by [[councillor]] Tony Ball,<ref name=\"echo1\"/> although other sources opposed to the project claim this figure is closer to 735.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrc-websites.co.uk/wickford/05_mp_tally.htm|title=Masterplan \u2013 the current total|accessdate=15 February 2010|publisher=Wickford Action Group}}</ref>\n\n===Opposition===\nThe Masterplan has met with resistance with many residents of Wickford, mainly due to overall cost, and also the fear from some older residents that raising the level of the river could see repeats of the floods in 1958 and 1960.\n\nThere have also been criticism over the number of developments being constructed, which some say threaten to overdevelop and cause environmental and aesthetic damage to the town centre whilst providing minimal improvements to public services; one such group is the Wickford Action Group who has campaigned against many of the revisions made prior to the public approval of the plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrc-websites.co.uk/wickford/05_mp.htm|title=Masterplan \u2013 the current total|accessdate=15 February 2010|publisher=Wickford action Group}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrc-websites.co.uk/wickford/05_mp.htm|title=Fears for Wickford|date=26 March 2007|accessdate=15 February 2010|publisher=Echo}}</ref>\n\n===Progress===\nConstruction began in earnest in February 2007, which saw the demolition of many of the buildings in Lower Southend Road to make way for a new residential area. As of December 2009 this development has been partially completed (Riverside Place phase 1 + Riverside Court), however the [[compulsory purchase order]] of the post sorting office has been withdrawn leaving the fate of Riverside Place Phase 2 in doubt.\n\nAs of April 2010, the whole of the Masterplan project is facing serious delays and construction has halted due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|global financial crisis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/4069123.Wickford_Masterplan_may_be_put_back_again/|title=Wickford Masterplan may be put back again|accessdate=12 March 2009|publisher=Echo News|date=23 January 2009}}</ref> In May 2009 the construction company Bradgate Developments released a statement assuring residents the project was still on track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/latestnews/WICKFORD-Builders-vow-flats-plan-ahead/article-984693-detail/article.html|title=WICKFORD: Builders vow flats plan will go ahead|accessdate=12 March 2009|publisher=This Is Total Essex.co.uk|date=12 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Proposed super-max prison==\nThe plans by the previous Labour government to build on land near the Runwell Hospital [[Psychiatric hospital|mental institute]] a prison capable of accommodating up to 1,500 inmates have since been shelved.

This included turning the river into a concrete channel through the centre of the town, although this may be removed in the coming years, depending on the scale of the Wickford Masterplan (see below).\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Wickford river crouch.jpg|thumb|right|The [[River Crouch]] flows through Wickford in a concrete bank designed to protect the town from flooding.]]\nFor the most part, Wickford is flat and {{convert|10|m|ft}} above sea level. The highest point, on the outskirts of the town, is {{convert|74|m|ft}} above sea level. The [[River Crouch]] flows through the town, from the west to the east. The River Wick flows into the River Crouch from the south.\n\n===Wick Country Park===\nThe Wick Country Park comprises {{convert|50|acre|ha}} of former agricultural land, with over 2&nbsp;km (1 1/4 miles) of easy access trails around the site. The trails leads visitors past old hedgerows, the {{convert|5|acre|ha|adj=on}} lake, ponds, World War II pillboxes and recent woodland plantings, with bridges and boardwalks that allow the trails to continue over the North Benfleet brook.\n\n===Neighbouring towns and villages===\n* [[South Hanningfield]]\n* [[West Hanningfield]]\n* [[Rettendon]]\n* [[Runwell]]\n* [[Battlesbridge]]\n* [[Ramsden Crays]] \n* [[Rawreth]]\n* [[Crays Hill]]\n* [[Ramsden Bellhouse]]\n* [[Ramsden Heath]]\n* [[Downham, Essex|Downham]]\n* [[Shotgate]]\n* [[South Woodham Ferrers]]\n* [[Billericay]]\n* [[Basildon]]\n* [[Rayleigh, Essex|Rayleigh]]\n\n==The Master Plan==\n[[File:Riverside Place Wickford.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Riverside Place Phase 1 complete]]\n\nThe Wickford Masterplan was first unveiled at the Wickford Community Centre in December 2004 and published in November 2005 by DTZ Pieda Consulting,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basildon.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=1203&p=0|title=Wickford Masterplan 2005|accessdate=30 December 2009|publisher=Basildon Council}}</ref> at a budget of \u00a3125&nbsp;million,<ref name=\"echo1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/4312054.Wickford_masterplan_comes_a_step_closer/|title=Basildon Council accepts sole bidder for Wickford masterplan tender|date=23 April 2009|accessdate=30 December 2009|publisher=Echo}}</ref> and many of the developments are currently in progress. At the heart of the proposals is the redevelopment of the High Street, which will be redesigned to be the town's premier meeting place. The Masterplan would create new public spaces, enhance the retail environment through the renewal of retail floor space and bring the market into the street scene, promoting urban living above shops and on the existing market site.\n\nAdjacent to the River Crouch, a number of high quality residential developments promoted as the \"Town Centre Riverside Living\" complex would revitalise the riverside as a public asset and promotion of new eating and drinking opportunities. In addition, a new residential development to the west of Market Avenue will be constructed.\n\nPromoting the station entrances on both sides of the railway line as key gateways to Wickford are also key areas of the plan, which would enhance transport interchange facilities and bring forward the car park site on Station Road for development as a new [[multi-storey car park]] and [[mixed-use development]]. As of present only the northern side of the station facing The Broadway is easily accessible, with the southern London-bound track only accessible from the outside though a small out-of-way footpath from Market Avenue as a courteous entrance for wheelchair-using passengers.\n\nPublic and health services would be improved under the scheme, with the re-organisation of existing health, library and community services into a new 'iconic' building to the east of Market Avenue as an integrated community service facility.\n\nThe Eastern Extension would create a better presence and new linkages to the east of the town centre by redeveloping the car park into a multi-storey development with residential and live-work uses and a new housing scheme to the east of Wickford Bypass. The Southern Gateway area, which surrounds London Road and the southern end of the High Street, are also planned to undergo a transition with a strong leisure and recreational theme, building on existing eating and drinking facilities and incorporating compatible residential uses.\n\nOverall 650 apartments are planned to be built as part of the Masterplan as officially stated by [[councillor]] Tony Ball,<ref name=\"echo1\"/> although other sources opposed to the project claim this figure is closer to 735.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrc-websites.co.uk/wickford/05_mp_tally.htm|title=Masterplan \u2013 the current total|accessdate=15 February 2010|publisher=Wickford Action Group}}</ref>\n\n===Opposition===\nThe Masterplan has met with resistance with many residents of Wickford, mainly due to overall cost, and also the fear from some older residents that raising the level of the river could see repeats of the floods in 1958 and 1960.\n\nThere have also been criticism over the number of developments being constructed, which some say threaten to overdevelop and cause environmental and aesthetic damage to the town centre whilst providing minimal improvements to public services; one such group is the Wickford Action Group who has campaigned against many of the revisions made prior to the public approval of the plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrc-websites.co.uk/wickford/05_mp.htm|title=Masterplan \u2013 the current total|accessdate=15 February 2010|publisher=Wickford action Group}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrc-websites.co.uk/wickford/05_mp.htm|title=Fears for Wickford|date=26 March 2007|accessdate=15 February 2010|publisher=Echo}}</ref>\n\n===Progress===\nConstruction began in earnest in February 2007, which saw the demolition of many of the buildings in Lower Southend Road to make way for a new residential area. As of December 2009 this development has been partially completed (Riverside Place phase 1 + Riverside Court), however the [[compulsory purchase order]] of the post sorting office has been withdrawn leaving the fate of Riverside Place Phase 2 in doubt.\n\nAs of April 2010, the whole of the Masterplan project is facing serious delays and construction has halted due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|global financial crisis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/4069123.Wickford_Masterplan_may_be_put_back_again/|title=Wickford Masterplan may be put back again|accessdate=12 March 2009|publisher=Echo News|date=23 January 2009}}</ref> In May 2009 the construction company Bradgate Developments released a statement assuring residents the project was still on track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/latestnews/WICKFORD-Builders-vow-flats-plan-ahead/article-984693-detail/article.html|title=WICKFORD: Builders vow flats plan will go ahead|accessdate=12 March 2009|publisher=This Is Total Essex.co.uk|date=12 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Proposed super-max prison==\nThe plans by the previous Labour government to build on land near the Runwell Hospital [[Psychiatric hospital|mental institute]] a prison capable of accommodating up to 1,500 inmates have since been shelved.

Their purpose was \"To provide the people of the county and the surrounding area with the opportunity to participate in and enjoy live theatre.\" For the first seasons, the plays and musicals were presented in various venues around the Greencastle. For the seasons of 1981 and 1982, plays and musicals were presented on an outdoor stage with bleacher seating. By 1983, the funds had been raised to convert a larger structure, a barn built in 1918, into an intimate 220-seat theater. The Hazel Day Longden Barn Theatre had its grand opening on June 4, 1983. Past performers presented a program of scenes and songs that had been produced by the PCP in its early years. In 1993, extensive work was done on the physical plant. A fly area was added and a new workshop and costume loft were constructed. The following year, a moderate cooling system was added and posts in the auditorium were removed. In April 2000, aluminum siding was added to the barn. Most recently, the seating system was completely replaced and the theater now seats 198 people.\n\nThe Putnam County Playhouse is active from June through September each year. It presents two musicals and two plays during those sixteen weeks. Every other year, a children's workshop play is also produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.putnamcountyplayhouse.com/about/history.html|title=Putnam County Playhouse - History of the Putnam County Playhouse|website=www.putnamcountyplayhouse.com}}</ref>\n\n==Covered Bridges==\n[[Image:Dunbar (Covered Bridge Greenfield).JPG|thumb|300 px|right|Dunbar Covered Bridge]]\n\nThe [[Dick Huffman Covered Bridge|Dick Huffman]] or '''Webster CB''' is the furthest south, just off [[Interstate 70 in Indiana|I-70]].

Their purpose was \"To provide the people of the county and the surrounding area with the opportunity to participate in and enjoy live theatre.\" For the first seasons, the plays and musicals were presented in various venues around the Greencastle. For the seasons of 1981 and 1982, plays and musicals were presented on an outdoor stage with bleacher seating. By 1983, the funds had been raised to convert a larger structure, a barn built in 1918, into an intimate 220-seat theater. The Hazel Day Longden Barn Theatre had its grand opening on June 4, 1983. Past performers presented a program of scenes and songs that had been produced by the PCP in its early years. In 1993, extensive work was done on the physical plant. A fly area was added and a new workshop and costume loft were constructed. The following year, a moderate cooling system was added and posts in the auditorium were removed. In April 2000, aluminum siding was added to the barn. Most recently, the seating system was completely replaced and the theater now seats 198 people.\n\nThe Putnam County Playhouse is active from June through September each year. It presents two musicals and two plays during those sixteen weeks. Every other year, a children's workshop play is also produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.putnamcountyplayhouse.com/about/history.html|title=Putnam County Playhouse - History of the Putnam County Playhouse|website=www.putnamcountyplayhouse.com}}</ref>\n\n==Covered Bridges==\n[[Image:Dunbar (Covered Bridge Greenfield).JPG|thumb|300 px|right|Dunbar Covered Bridge]]\n\nThe [[Dick Huffman Covered Bridge|Dick Huffman]] or '''Webster CB''' is the furthest south, just off [[Interstate 70 in Indiana|I-70]].

He consequently spends most of his teen years and a portion of his 20s in various prison facilities on the Moons of Mars and Earth. During his time behind bars, he falls in love with a female Public Defender named \"Mrs. Noon,\" with whom he has a strong but short love, as she is apparently killed because of him for an unknown reason. Daniel's memories of his past are mostly filled with pain and anger, of being shocked with tazer-prods in prison or murdering a Crater-Gang thug by smashing the face-mask of his spacesuit with a rock. At some point Daniel Llanso escapes from a lunar prison in a stolen freighter, but as the story points out, the cargo on board was 'Fetid' or, more likely, booby-trapped. Daniel Llanso dies as his spaceship burns up in the Earth's atmosphere; his space suit melts and his flesh burns. He screams as his soul falls burning into the darkness of damnation ending deep within the Twelfth Level of Hell.\n\nHaving died and resurrected as a [[Hellspawn (Spawn)|Hellspawn]], Daniel is at first lost in a blur of treacherous memory and whispers to do evil deeds and use his energy to violent ends. The Hellspawn rises from the barren earth just in time to stop a large demon from killing his sister and her son Matthew. Daniel instantly recognizes her, but not his nephew. She then fires her Energy rifle at the Hellspawn as Madrid and Matt escape. Spawn is left alone only to be 'found' by Abaddon who goads Spawn to kill the last humans on Earth. Spawn agrees. \n\nThe forces of evil, now gathered within Vatican City, are led by the \"Anti-Pope\", who summons a demon named Bune to attack a human stronghold, while Abaddon goads Spawn to kill human soldiers and become Hell's General. Daniel resists at every turn, remembering the promise he made the last time he saw his sister alive: to never give up on himself. Abaddon reveals to Spawn that the Anti-Pope has already sent Death to claim Madrid and Matt, Spawn removes his mask and sees what he has become in a pool of water. In a moment of anger, he is confronted by his master Phlegethonyarre who admits to Daniel that his fate was sealed from the beginning and using his new necro powers consumes a part of his soul. The hellspawn Daniel races against time to rescue Madrid and her son Matt from an army of 'Navkies'(undead children) under the command of Bune.

The white fillets are laid out at regular spacing, which does not always coincide with the rough spacing of the joints.]] \nProfessional \"tuckpointers\" use tuckpointing tools, which depending on country and local trade terminology sometimes may be termed \"jointers\", \"tuck irons\"<ref name=\":0\" /> or \"tuckpointing irons\" (primarily in London where the trade originated).\n\nTuckpointing tools were originally made from [[Wrought_iron|wrought iron]] by blacksmiths in England during the 18th century. Over time these tools have evolved, and are today constructed from hardened tool steel. Tuckpointing tools typically have a wooden or synthetic handle that is attached to the tool surface by a metal [[ferrule]]. The tool surface itself has a sharp-pointed front and a flat, beaded or grooved base; the sharp point aids the user in smoothing the tuckpointed line. This is similar in principle to the pointed floats used by concrete finishers to smooth out a surface.\n\nThe thickness and width of a tuckpointing tool is variable, with common measurements ranging from 1 mm to 14 mm. The thickness and width of these tools is heavily dependent upon the mason's personal preference and the type of brick or stonework that they are tuckpointing. Wider tools are often used when tuckpointing stonework.\n\nThere are many different types of tuckpointing tools now available:\n\"Standard Tuckpointing Tools (flat bottomed)\",\n\"Square Beaded Tuckpointing Tool\",\n\"Round Beaded Tuckpointing Tools\", \n\"Stubnose and Longnose Tuckpointing tools\", and also rarer\n\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\".\n\nStandard or flat bottomed tuckpointing tools were once the most commonly used tuckpointing tools, primarily because of the ease at which they could be manufactured by early blacksmiths. Standard tuckpointing tools are very versatile and can be used for a variety of different jobs ranging from very fine detail work up to wide stone tuckpointing work.\n\nTuckpointing tools are sometimes \"beaded\". First, beaded tuckpointing tools were crude instruments made by blacksmiths by hitting a rounded leading edged hammer against a red hot tuckpointing iron. This process has since been refined, and now a small rounded or square fillet is \"ground\" into the flat of the tuckpointing tool that comes into contact with the \"perps\" or \"lines\" in the brickwork. In bricklaying terms, the \"perps\" are the gaps between the bricks in which mortar runs in the vertical direction, perpendicular to the ends<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://irishtechnews.ie/robots-podcast-hadrian-bricklaying-robot-with-mark-pivac/|title=Robots podcast: Hadrian bricklaying robot, with Mark Pivac|last=Cocking|first=Simon|date=2017-03-23|website=Irishtechnews.ie|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>. \"Lines\" run in the horizontal direction.\n\nThe lengths of tools again vary based upon personal preferences, but the most common lengths are usually between 7.5 and 12.5 cm. However, masons and bricklayers sometimes need tuckpointing tools which are much shorter or much longer. Shorter tools help the worker access hard to reach spots, like under a window or in a corner. These shorter tuckpointing tools are referred to as \"stubnose\" tools, while their longer counterparts are known as \"longnose\" tools. They are available in many different beaded or grooved profiles.\n\nSquare beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, and 13 mm wide ground square profiles. Round beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, and 12 mm ground round profiles.\n\n\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\" are curved; instead of a flat bottom, the tool has a curved bottom surface which helps in applying lime putty to rounded bricks. \n\nThe process of tuckpointing requires that the excess lime putty is \"cut\" away from the fine tuckpointed line. This is performed using a Frenchmen<ref name=\":0\" /> knife or a double Frenchmen knife. A Frenchmen knife is a type of knife with a small sharp bent tip that allows the lime putty to be cut when guided along the tuckpointed line with a tuckpointer's straight edge. A double Frenchmen knife works by cutting both top and bottom tuckpointed fine lines in one pass, making the process quicker. Double Frenchmen knives can be adjusted to match the width of the fine tuckpointed lines.\n\nTuckpointing is a fairly rare but not forgotten trade. Many historic homes with classic [[Italianate architecture]] like the Werribee Mansion at [[Werribee Park]], in Victoria, Australia west of Melbourne, are great examples of recent tuckpointing which display the contrast between the tuckpointed white lines in the mortar between the bluestone architecture.\n\n==References==\n<references />\nhttps://www.masonrymagazine.com/blog/2008/09/01/tuckpointing-and-repointing-tools/\n{{Stonemasonry}}\n\n[[Category:Masonry]]\n[[Category:Bricks]]\n[[Category:Stonemasonry]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the process of renewing the external part of mortar joints|Repointing}}\n \n[[Image:Tuck pointing Westminster.jpg|thumb|Brickwork of [[10 Downing Street]], showing fine white fillets in carefully matched dark mortar]]'''Tuckpointing''' (also called tuck pointing or tuck-pointing) is a way of using two contrasting colours of [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] in the [[mortar joint]]s of [[brickwork]], with one colour matching the bricks themselves to give an artificial impression that very fine joints have been made. In some parts of the United States and Canada, some confusion may result as the term is often used interchangeably with ''[[wikt:pointing|pointing]]'' (to correct defects or finish off joints in newly laid masonry) and ''[[repointing]]'' (to place wet mortar into cut or raked joints to repair weathered joints in old masonry).\n\n==History==\nThe tuckpointing method was developed in [[England]] in the late eighteenth century<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/the-lost-art-of-tuckpointing-reborn-intoronto/article37802073/|title=The lost art of tuckpointing reborn in\u00a0Toronto\u200b|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> to imitate brickwork constructed using ''rubbed bricks'' (also ''rubbers'' and ''gauged bricks''), which were bricks of fine, red finish that were made slightly oversized, and, after firing, then were individually [[abrasive|abraded]] or cut, often by hand, to a precise size.<ref>{{cite book|last=Conway|first=Hazel |author2=Roenisch, Rowan  |title=Understanding architecture|publisher=Routledge|location=London|date=15 December 2004|page=119|isbn=978-0-415-32058-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=Roger|author2=Suhr, Marianne|authorlink2=Marianne Suhr|title=The Old House Handbook|publisher=Frances Lincoln|location=London|date=23 October 2008|page=[https://archive.org/details/oldhousehandbook0000hunt/page/51 51]|isbn=978-0-7112-2772-9|url=https://archive.org/details/oldhousehandbook0000hunt/page/51}}</ref> When laid with white [[lime mortar]], a neat finish of red brick contrasting with very fine white joints was obtained. Tuckpointing was a way of achieving a similar effect using cheap, unrubbed bricks: these were laid in a mortar of a matching colour (initially red, but later, blue-black bricks and mortar were occasionally used) and a fine [[wikt:fillet|fillet]] of white material, usually  pipeclay or putty, pushed into the joints before the mortar set.<ref>[http://www.defence-estates.mod.uk/publications/historic_buildings/historic_buildings/PDF_8111/Technical%204%2001.pdf Walls, repointing brickwork] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019225719/http://www.defence-estates.mod.uk/publications/historic_buildings/historic_buildings/PDF_8111/Technical%204%2001.pdf |date=2007-10-19 }} Ministry of Defence (Defence Estates), Sutton Coldfield, England, accessed 2007-10-17</ref> The term ''tuckpointing'' derives from an earlier, less sophisticated technique that was used with very uneven bricks: a thin line, called a ''[[wikt:tuck|tuck]]'', was drawn in the flush-faced mortar, but left unfilled, to give the impression of well-formed brickwork.{{citation needed|reason=The OED says protruding, not incised|date=July 2012}}\n<img src=\"https://www.thereciperebel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/mint-cream-cheese-brownies-www.thereciperebel.com-600-8-of-14.jpg\" alt=\"mint brownies piece\">\n\n==Tuckpointing tools==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\n{{copyedit|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Tuck pointing on The Elms, 18th Century house in Acton - geograph.org.uk - 251637.jpg|thumb|Here red mortar is used. The white fillets are laid out at regular spacing, which does not always coincide with the rough spacing of the joints.]] \nProfessional \"tuckpointers\" use tuckpointing tools, which depending on country and local trade terminology sometimes may be termed \"jointers\", \"tuck irons\"<ref name=\":0\" /> or \"tuckpointing irons\" (primarily in London where the trade originated).\n\nTuckpointing tools were originally made from [[Wrought_iron|wrought iron]] by blacksmiths in England during the 18th century. Over time these tools have evolved, and are today constructed from hardened tool steel. Tuckpointing tools typically have a wooden or synthetic handle that is attached to the tool surface by a metal [[ferrule]]. The tool surface itself has a sharp-pointed front and a flat, beaded or grooved base; the sharp point aids the user in smoothing the tuckpointed line. This is similar in principle to the pointed floats used by concrete finishers to smooth out a surface.\n\nThe thickness and width of a tuckpointing tool is variable, with common measurements ranging from 1 mm to 14 mm. The thickness and width of these tools is heavily dependent upon the mason's personal preference and the type of brick or stonework that they are tuckpointing. Wider tools are often used when tuckpointing stonework.\n\nThere are many different types of tuckpointing tools now available:\n\"Standard Tuckpointing Tools (flat bottomed)\",\n\"Square Beaded Tuckpointing Tool\",\n\"Round Beaded Tuckpointing Tools\", \n\"Stubnose and Longnose Tuckpointing tools\", and also rarer\n\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\".\n\nStandard or flat bottomed tuckpointing tools were once the most commonly used tuckpointing tools, primarily because of the ease at which they could be manufactured by early blacksmiths. Standard tuckpointing tools are very versatile and can be used for a variety of different jobs ranging from very fine detail work up to wide stone tuckpointing work.\n\nTuckpointing tools are sometimes \"beaded\". First, beaded tuckpointing tools were crude instruments made by blacksmiths by hitting a rounded leading edged hammer against a red hot tuckpointing iron. This process has since been refined, and now a small rounded or square fillet is \"ground\" into the flat of the tuckpointing tool that comes into contact with the \"perps\" or \"lines\" in the brickwork. In bricklaying terms, the \"perps\" are the gaps between the bricks in which mortar runs in the vertical direction, perpendicular to the ends<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://irishtechnews.ie/robots-podcast-hadrian-bricklaying-robot-with-mark-pivac/|title=Robots podcast: Hadrian bricklaying robot, with Mark Pivac|last=Cocking|first=Simon|date=2017-03-23|website=Irishtechnews.ie|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>. \"Lines\" run in the horizontal direction.\n\nThe lengths of tools again vary based upon personal preferences, but the most common lengths are usually between 7.5 and 12.5 cm. However, masons and bricklayers sometimes need tuckpointing tools which are much shorter or much longer. Shorter tools help the worker access hard to reach spots, like under a window or in a corner. These shorter tuckpointing tools are referred to as \"stubnose\" tools, while their longer counterparts are known as \"longnose\" tools. They are available in many different beaded or grooved profiles.\n\nSquare beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, and 13 mm wide ground square profiles. Round beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, and 12 mm ground round profiles.\n\n\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\" are curved; instead of a flat bottom, the tool has a curved bottom surface which helps in applying lime putty to rounded bricks. \n\nThe process of tuckpointing requires that the excess lime putty is \"cut\" away from the fine tuckpointed line. This is performed using a Frenchmen<ref name=\":0\" /> knife or a double Frenchmen knife. A Frenchmen knife is a type of knife with a small sharp bent tip that allows the lime putty to be cut when guided along the tuckpointed line with a tuckpointer's straight edge. A double Frenchmen knife works by cutting both top and bottom tuckpointed fine lines in one pass, making the process quicker. Double Frenchmen knives can be adjusted to match the width of the fine tuckpointed lines.\n\nTuckpointing is a fairly rare but not forgotten trade. Many historic homes with classic [[Italianate architecture]] like the Werribee Mansion at [[Werribee Park]], in Victoria, Australia west of Melbourne, are great examples of recent tuckpointing which display the contrast between the tuckpointed white lines in the mortar between the bluestone architecture.\n\n==References==\n<references />\nhttps://www.masonrymagazine.com/blog/2008/09/01/tuckpointing-and-repointing-tools/\n{{Stonemasonry}}\n\n[[Category:Masonry]]\n[[Category:Bricks]]\n[[Category:Stonemasonry]]\n", "name_user": "Joshuamcclary", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckpointing"}
