{"title_page": "Road signs in New Zealand", "text_new": "'''Road signs in New Zealand''' are similar to those set by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]]. While New Zealand is not a signatory to the convention, its [[road sign]]s are generally close in shape and function. New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

[[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway.

New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

[[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station.

Prior to the opening of the airport, the island was only reachable by sea, making it one of the most remote populated places on earth, measured as travel time from major cities. Sea journeys used to take five days from [[Cape Town]], with departures once every three weeks.\n\nThe first consideration of an airport on St Helena was made in 1943 by the [[South African Air Force]], which undertook a survey on [[Prosperous Bay Plain]] from October 1943 until January 1944, but concluded that, while technically feasible, an airport was not a practical proposition.<ref name=\"consultation_annex_a\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/documents/consultations/sthelena/consult-sthele-annexes-apr09.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202192044/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/consultations/sthelena/consult-sthele-annexes-apr09.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 February 2011 |title=DFID Consultation Document \u2013 Annex A \u2013 Summary of cost/benefit analysis and financial costs |publisher=DFID |date=16 April 2009 |page=12 }}</ref>\nFrom the 1960s, there was an idea{{by whom|date=April 2016}} to build an airport on the Island. In 1999, this was taken up by the island government.\n\nIt was suggested that an airport would extend the United Kingdom's capabilities to carry out airborne missions in the South Atlantic region, such as [[maritime patrol]]s in accordance with international fishing agreements (e.g., [[International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas]]), counter-piracy missions along important trade routes, and also [[airlift]] operations notably into Southern Africa.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAccording to analysts,{{who|date=May 2017}} the UK government's decision to finally go ahead with the airport, after long delays, seems to be driven in part by concerns over a continuing tense standoff with Argentina in the [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute]]. The island is about {{convert|3812|mi}} from the Falklands \u2013 seven hours and 40 minutes' flight time. But, analysts say that was nevertheless an improvement over the present state of isolation from the UK for both St Helena and the Falklands.<ref name=\"upi.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2011/11/07/St-Helena-airport-a-key-Falklands-link/UPI-78911320686806/ |title=St. Helena airport a key Falklands link |date=7 November 2011 |publisher=United Press International, Inc. |access-date=8 August 2012 |work=news article |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202081633/http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2011/11/07/St-Helena-airport-a-key-Falklands-link/UPI-78911320686806/ |archive-date=2 February 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe following possible benefits were also factors in the decision-making process:\n* Air access would allow St Helena to develop its tourism sector.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n* The new wharf in Rupert's Bay could allow regularly passing cruise ships to land passengers at the island and bring tourists if sized appropriately. The lack of a protected landing facility represents a limitation on the development of cruise tourism. In unfavourable sea conditions, landing is hazardous and potential revenue is lost as many cruise ships refuse to allow passengers to land in such circumstances. In addition, because there is no protected landing facility, many cruise companies do not incorporate St Helena into their itineraries.

Prior to the opening of the airport, the island was only reachable by sea, making it one of the most remote populated places on earth, measured as travel time from major cities. Sea journeys used to take five days from [[Cape Town]], with departures once every three weeks.\n\nThe first consideration of an airport on St Helena was made in 1943 by the [[South African Air Force]], which undertook a survey on [[Prosperous Bay Plain]] from October 1943 until January 1944, but concluded that, while technically feasible, an airport was not a practical proposition.<ref name=\"consultation_annex_a\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/documents/consultations/sthelena/consult-sthele-annexes-apr09.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202192044/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/consultations/sthelena/consult-sthele-annexes-apr09.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 February 2011 |title=DFID Consultation Document \u2013 Annex A \u2013 Summary of cost/benefit analysis and financial costs |publisher=DFID |date=16 April 2009 |page=12 }}</ref>\nFrom the 1960s, there was an idea{{by whom|date=April 2016}} to build an airport on the Island. In 1999, this was taken up by the island government.\n\nIt was suggested that an airport would extend the United Kingdom's capabilities to carry out airborne missions in the South Atlantic region, such as [[maritime patrol]]s in accordance with international fishing agreements (e.g., [[International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas]]), counter-piracy missions along important trade routes, and also [[airlift]] operations notably into Southern Africa.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAccording to analysts,{{who|date=May 2017}} the UK government's decision to finally go ahead with the airport, after long delays, seems to be driven in part by concerns over a continuing tense standoff with Argentina in the [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute]]. The island is about {{convert|3812|mi}} from the Falklands \u2013 seven hours and 40 minutes' flight time. But, analysts say that was nevertheless an improvement over the present state of isolation from the UK for both St Helena and the Falklands.<ref name=\"upi.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2011/11/07/St-Helena-airport-a-key-Falklands-link/UPI-78911320686806/ |title=St. Helena airport a key Falklands link |date=7 November 2011 |publisher=United Press International, Inc. |access-date=8 August 2012 |work=news article |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202081633/http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2011/11/07/St-Helena-airport-a-key-Falklands-link/UPI-78911320686806/ |archive-date=2 February 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe following possible benefits were also factors in the decision-making process:\n* Air access would allow St Helena to develop its tourism sector.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n* The new wharf in Rupert's Bay could allow regularly passing cruise ships to land passengers at the island and bring tourists if sized appropriately. The lack of a protected landing facility represents a limitation on the development of cruise tourism. In unfavourable sea conditions, landing is hazardous and potential revenue is lost as many cruise ships refuse to allow passengers to land in such circumstances. In addition, because there is no protected landing facility, many cruise companies do not incorporate St Helena into their itineraries.

[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) to support the [[Hebrew alphabet]].<ref name=\"Kennelly_1991_DEC\"/> It was derived from DEC's [[Multinational Character Set]] (MCS) by removing the existing definitions from code points 192 to 223 and 224 to 250 and replacing code points 251 to 256 by the Hebrew letters.<ref name=\"Kennelly_1991_DEC\"/> This range corresponds to the Hebrew range of [[SI 960|its 7-bit counterpart]], but with the high bit set. \n\nSince MCS is a predecessor of [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]], DEC Hebrew is similar to [[ISO/IEC 8859-8]] and the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[code page 1255]], that is, many characters in the range 160 to 191 are the same, and the Hebrew letters are at 192 to 250 in all three character sets.\n\n==Code page

The script was written by T\u00e9chin\u00e9 in collaboration with [[C\u00e9line Sciamma]]. The plot follows the romantic and sexual awakening of two seventeen-year-old boys as their initial animosity, expressed in violence, morphs into love. ''Being 17''  borrows its title from the second half-line of the first verse of  ''Roman'', (1870) by [[Arthur Rimbaud]]: ''On n'est pas s\u00e9rieux quand on a dix-sept ans''.<ref>{{cite news\n | last = Prot\n | first = B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte \n| title = Being 17: Film Focus\n | work =Cineuropa.org\n | date = 15 February 2016\n | url = http://www.cineuropa.org/ff.aspx?t=ffocusarticle&l=en&did=305334&tid=2941\n | accessdate = 17 October 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSmart and sensitive, Damien is a seventeen-year-old student who lives with his mother Marianne, a doctor. His father, Nathan, is a military pilot on a mission abroad. They enjoy a comfortable life in a small town located in a valley among the mountains of the [[Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]].\n\nIn high school, Damien gets picked on by Thomas, a classmate, who  trips him in the middle of class for no apparent reason. From then on there are constant altercations between them while playing sports and in the schoolyard. Both are outsiders at school chosen last for sports teams. In order to protect himself, Damien takes self-defense classes with Paulo, an ex-military family friend.\n\nMeanwhile, Thomas, who is the biracial adopted son of a couple of sheep and cattle farmers, faces his own set of problems. Every day, he has to walk and bus for 90 minutes to reach the school. Marianne makes a house call to Thomas's farm when his mother, Christine, has a pulmonary infection. Christine, who has a history of miscarriages, is pregnant and has to be hospitalized for some time. As the reserved Thomas worries about his mother and the birth of a biological child to his parents, his grades in school begin to fail. Wanting to help, Marianne invites Thomas to come and stay with her family so he can visit his mother in town at the hospital and spend more time studying and avoid the long trip to school every day. This coincides with a blissful return home for Nathan for leave between his tours of duty abroad. Nathan is lovingly welcomed by his wife and son and takes it upon himself, during his short visit, to personally invite Thomas to stay with his family. Pressed by his parents, Thomas reluctantly accepts.\n\nSharing the same household does not seem to improve the relationship between the two teenagers. Damien resents that his mother is charmed by Thomas and accuses him of getting sick so he can be examined by Marianne. Away from home, the two boys fight each other in the mountains, and have to stop when a heavy rain comes from nowhere. While waiting for the rain to stop, the two boys share a cigarette. Thomas then suggests they swim in the lake at the top of the mountain. When they reach there, Thomas strips himself naked and Damien stares. Several days later, Damien asks a reluctant Thomas to drive to see a man whom he has contacted online for a sexual experiment. When the man tries to kiss Damien, he backs down. On their way back home, Damien confesses his feelings to Thomas, saying, \"I need to know if I'm into guys or just you.\" Thomas does not welcome the revelation. He stops the car and gets out at the bank of a river. While trying to rebuff Damien, Thomas falls into a ditch and breaks his wrist. Realizing that the two boys have continued fighting, Marianne asks Thomas to return to his farm. The next day, Thomas gets late for the Spanish class, and smiles to Damien when taking the seat next to him. He even allows Damien to dry his unwounded hand with a handkerchief. Encouraged, Damien takes the first step and kisses Thomas, who initially seems to welcome  and return the affection, but then pushes Damien away and hits him in the face when Damien timidly follows him to the lockers. Thomas is expelled from school. Damien tells his mother why Thomas hit him, revealing his true feelings for Thomas. Marianne is sympathetic to her son.\n\nNathan is killed in a mission, shattering the lives of his wife and son. After the funeral, Thomas embraces Damien while consoling him. As Marianne falls into a deep depression, Thomas moves back to live with them to help look after Marianne. He keeps her company while Damien is away at school. The relationship between the two boys warms up. They work together, discussing a classroom project on desire. When Marianne finds the strength to go back to work, it is time for Thomas to return to his farm. Marianne goes to bed earlier that night. Damien tells Thomas that he still loves him and that he is not ashamed of his feelings. Thomas asks him to shut up and kisses him on the mouth. The two boys then make love and top each other. The next morning, Thomas leaves before Damien wakes up. Damien goes to Thomas's farm where they talk about the previous night and their feelings. Thomas is happy to have Damien on the farm, but each time Damien tries to kiss him, he says \"not here\", though he doesn't regret having sex with Damien. Several weeks or months later, a nervous Thomas is seen punching on the door to Damien's family house and asking Damien to stay with him as he gets a superstitious panic that he might bring bad luck when his foster mother is in labor. Marianne and Damien accompany him to the happy occasion. Marianne decides that it is better for her to take a job offer and move to [[Lyon]]. She tells her son that Thomas can come and visit, but Damien is doubtful. Marianne then tells him that he has to have more confidence in himself and in life. In the last scene, Thomas happily goes down to the slope to meet Damien and they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image | align = right | total_width = 400| image1 = Kacey Mottet Klein Cabourg 2016 2.jpg | width1 = 565 |height1 = 800 | image2 = Corentin Fila 2017.jpg | width2 = 565 |height2 = 800 | image3 = Sandrine Kiberlain at the 2009 Deauville American Film Festival-01.jpg | width3 = 511 | height3 = 681 | footer = The film stars [[Kacey Mottet Klein]], [[Corentin Fila]] and [[Sandrine Kiberlain]].}}\n* [[Sandrine Kiberlain]] : Dr. Marianne Delille\n* [[Kacey Mottet Klein]] : Damien Delille\n* [[Corentin Fila]] : Thomas Chardoul\n* [[Alexis Loret]] : Nathan Delille\n* Jean Corso : Paulo\n* Jean Fornerod : Jacques Chardoul\n* Mama Prassinos : Christine Chardoul\n\n==Production==\nFor his 21st feature film, director Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9 returned to the theme of adolescent life more than twenty years after his success with ''[[Wild Reeds]]''  (1994).

About their collaboration, T\u00e9chin\u00e9 explained: \"I had a lot of admiration for what she's brought to French film, the innovative side of her work on adolescence, and I knew that my film would revolve around two teenagers.

The [[Sega]] console versions (i.e. [[Sega Genesis]], [[Sega CD]], [[Master System]] and [[Game Gear]]) were published by Sega while the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] versions were developed and published by [[Konami]]. The [[MS-DOS]] version was published by Konami and developed by Spirit of Discovery. The Amiga version was developed by [[Denton Designs]], and also published by Konami. There is also an [[Atari Lynx]] version, published by [[Atari Corporation]]. Gabrielle breslin\n\n==Gameplay==\n===Sega versions===\nThe [[Sega Genesis]] and [[Sega CD]] versions of the game are more or less identical, as they are both two-dimensional platforming games similar in design to [[Batman (Sega Mega Drive video game)|Sega's previous movie-based Batman game]]. The Genesis version of the game was released on December 29, 1992, during the same time [[Ecco the Dolphin]] was released for the Sega Genesis as well. The CD version of the game features a number of 3D racing levels that took advantage of the graphics hardware provided by the Sega CD unit, plus improved music in the form of [[CD audio]] with a number of animations featuring original artwork (not film photos). While different versions follow the movie's plot from start to finish, the Sega versions start after [[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]] kills the Ice Princess and puts the blame on Batman for killing her, as shown in the game's introductions.\n\nThe [[Sega Master System]] and [[Sega Game Gear]] versions of the game are side-scrolling platform games. However, the titles were created independently of the 16-bit versions. This version featured a unique branched level system, allowing players to choose from an easy and difficult route. The latter typically forced players to use rope swinging to navigate over large floorless areas in these versions of levels.oswald cobblepot\n\n===Konami versions===\n[[File:Batman Returns (SNES) gameplay.png|thumb|left|An example of gameplay from the SNES version of ''Batman Returns''.]]\nThe SNES version of the game was released in 1993. It is fundamentally a left-to-right scrolling fighter [[beat 'em up]], a genre that was featured heavily on the console at the time. The gameplay and graphics are very similar to the ''[[Final Fight]]'' games. The game takes the player through seven scenes featured in the film. Each scene has a boss fight that Batman must win in order to proceed to the next scene. Scene 1 takes place in Gotham's Plaza, where Batman fights numerous Red Triangle Circus gangsters and saves [[Selina Kyle]] from the Stungun Clown who took her hostage. In Scene 2, Batman fights the Circus gang throughout Gotham City's Streets, facing the Tattooed Strongman as the boss. Climbing on the rooftops of Scene 3, Batman encounters Catwoman, who escapes to an abandoned building where Penguin's setting a trap for Batman, but he manages to take on Catwoman and Penguin on Scene 4. On Scene 5, Batman drives the Batmobile and uses a machine gun to destroy Penguin's Campaign Van. Moving to Scene 6, Batman goes to the Circus Train and defeats Penguin's right-hand man, the Organ Grinder. Penguin escapes to the abandoned Arctict World on Scene 7, where Batman destroys his Duck Vehicle and ultimately gains the upper hand on Penguin once and for all. Meanwhile, Catwoman escapes and watches as Batman gets called for another adventure. Various members of the Red Triangle Circus Gang attack Batman throughout the game. Batman has a number of weapons and moves at his disposal, including the [[batarang]]. A number of levels are two-dimensional platform levels as opposed to the majority of the pseudo-3D levels where freer movement is permitted.\n\nThe NES version of the game is also a beat 'em up game, but closer in style and gameplay to the ''[[Double Dragon]]'' series. The player only has one life bar (which can be expanded through health packs). It implements a password-save system. Of special note are the two side-scrolling racing levels in which the player controls the Batmobile and the Batskiboat.\n\nThe DOS version of the game, published by Konami, differs considerably from the other versions, in that it was not primarily an action game, rather an [[adventure game]].\n\nThe Amiga version of the game was a subject of considerable controversy. Gametek had, prior to the game's release, sent a number of screenshots derived from the PC title to market the game. As such, a number of computer magazines previewed the game as a direct conversion of the PC adventure. The reality, however, was very different. The game was, contrary to expectations, not a conversion of the PC title, but a side-scrolling platform game akin to the console games. It was plagued with bugs, including very inaccurate [[collision detection]].\n\n===Atari Lynx version===\n{{Main|Batman Returns (Atari Lynx game)}}\n\n==Development and release==\n{{Expand-section|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n<!-- Reviewers -->\n | EGM = 21/40 (Sega CD)<ref name=\"EGMSegaCDRev\"/>\n | GamePro = 20/20 (SNES)<ref name=\"GameProSNESRev\"/><br>16.5/20 (Game Gear)<ref name=\"GameProGameGearRev\"/><br>15.5/20 (Genesis)<ref name=\"GameProGenesisRev\"/><br>15/20 (NES)<ref name=\"GameProNESRev\"/><br>13.5/20 (Sega CD)<ref name=\"GameProSegaCDRev\"/>\n | rev1 = ''[[MegaTech]]''\n | rev1Score = 94%<ref>MegaTech rating, [[EMAP]], issue 19</ref>\n | rev2 = [[Sega Master Force]]\n | rev2Score = 54%<ref name=\"SMF-BatmanReturns\">{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=August 1993 |title=Sega Master Force Issue 1 |url=http://www.smspower.org/Scans/SegaMasterForce-Magazine-Issue1?gallerypage=25 |journal= |location= |author= |publisher= |issue=1 |page=25 |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}</ref>\n<!-- Awards -->\n | award1Pub = MegaTech\n | award1 = Hyper Game\n | award2Pub = [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]\n | award2 = Best Licensed Game of 1992<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\">{{cite journal |year=1993 |title=Electronic Gaming Monthly's Buyer's Guide}}</ref>\n}}\n\nIn his review of the Genesis version, Boy Blunder of ''GamePro'' described the controls as \"a tad cumbersome at first, but playable after practice\", and felt that they were \"a step down from [[Sunsoft]]'s [[Batman (Sega Genesis video game)|cart]]\".

Scene 1 takes place in Gotham's Plaza, where Batman fights numerous Red Triangle Circus gangsters and saves [[Selina Kyle]] from the Stungun Clown who took her hostage. In Scene 2, Batman fights the Circus gang throughout Gotham City's Streets, facing the Tattooed Strongman as the boss. Climbing on the rooftops of Scene 3, Batman encounters Catwoman, who escapes to an abandoned building where Penguin's setting a trap for Batman, but he manages to take on Catwoman and Penguin on Scene 4. On Scene 5, Batman drives the Batmobile and uses a machine gun to destroy Penguin's Campaign Van. Moving to Scene 6, Batman goes to the Circus Train and defeats Penguin's right-hand man, the Organ Grinder. Penguin escapes to the abandoned Arctict World on Scene 7, where Batman destroys his Duck Vehicle and ultimately gains the upper hand on Penguin once and for all. Meanwhile, Catwoman escapes and watches as Batman gets called for another adventure. Various members of the Red Triangle Circus Gang attack Batman throughout the game. Batman has a number of weapons and moves at his disposal, including the [[batarang]]. A number of levels are two-dimensional platform levels as opposed to the majority of the pseudo-3D levels where freer movement is permitted.\n\nThe NES version of the game is also a beat 'em up game, but closer in style and gameplay to the ''[[Double Dragon]]'' series. The player only has one life bar (which can be expanded through health packs). It implements a password-save system. Of special note are the two side-scrolling racing levels in which the player controls the Batmobile and the Batskiboat.\n\nThe DOS version of the game, published by Konami, differs considerably from the other versions, in that it was not primarily an action game, rather an [[adventure game]].\n\nThe Amiga version of the game was a subject of considerable controversy. Gametek had, prior to the game's release, sent a number of screenshots derived from the PC title to market the game. As such, a number of computer magazines previewed the game as a direct conversion of the PC adventure. The reality, however, was very different. The game was, contrary to expectations, not a conversion of the PC title, but a side-scrolling platform game akin to the console games. It was plagued with bugs, including very inaccurate [[collision detection]].\n\n===Atari Lynx version===\n{{Main|Batman Returns (Atari Lynx game)}}\n\n==Development and release==\n{{Expand-section|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n<!-- Reviewers -->\n | EGM = 21/40 (Sega CD)<ref name=\"EGMSegaCDRev\"/>\n | GamePro = 20/20 (SNES)<ref name=\"GameProSNESRev\"/><br>16.5/20 (Game Gear)<ref name=\"GameProGameGearRev\"/><br>15.5/20 (Genesis)<ref name=\"GameProGenesisRev\"/><br>15/20 (NES)<ref name=\"GameProNESRev\"/><br>13.5/20 (Sega CD)<ref name=\"GameProSegaCDRev\"/>\n | rev1 = ''[[MegaTech]]''\n | rev1Score = 94%<ref>MegaTech rating, [[EMAP]], issue 19</ref>\n | rev2 = [[Sega Master Force]]\n | rev2Score = 54%<ref name=\"SMF-BatmanReturns\">{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=August 1993 |title=Sega Master Force Issue 1 |url=http://www.smspower.org/Scans/SegaMasterForce-Magazine-Issue1?gallerypage=25 |journal= |location= |author= |publisher= |issue=1 |page=25 |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}</ref>\n<!-- Awards -->\n | award1Pub = MegaTech\n | award1 = Hyper Game\n | award2Pub = [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]\n | award2 = Best Licensed Game of 1992<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\">{{cite journal |year=1993 |title=Electronic Gaming Monthly's Buyer's Guide}}</ref>\n}}\n\nIn his review of the Genesis version, Boy Blunder of ''GamePro'' described the controls as \"a tad cumbersome at first, but playable after practice\", and felt that they were \"a step down from [[Sunsoft]]'s [[Batman (Sega Genesis video game)|cart]]\".

In [[Pakistan]], ruling Generals [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] (1977\u20131988) and [[Pervez Musharraf]] (1999\u20132008) have held [[referendums]] to elect themselves [[President of Pakistan]] for additional terms forbidden by the [[Constitution of Pakistan|constitution]].\n\n==Justification==\nIn the past, military juntas have justified their rule as a way of bringing political stability for the nation or rescuing it from the threat of \"dangerous ideologies\". For example, the threat of [[communism]], [[socialism]], and [[Islamism]] was often used. Military regimes tend to portray themselves as non-partisan, as a \"neutral\" party that can provide interim leadership in times of turmoil, and also tend to portray civilian politicians as corrupt and ineffective. One of the almost universal characteristics of a military government is the institution of [[martial law]] or a permanent [[state of emergency]].\n\nA military dictatorship is different from [[civilian dictatorship]] for a number of reasons: their motivations for seizing power, the institutions through which they organize their rule and the ways in which they leave power. Often viewing itself as saving the nation from the corrupt or myopic civilian politicians, a military dictatorship justifies its position as \"neutral\" arbiters on the basis of their membership within the armed forces. For example, many [[Junta (governing body)|juntas]] adopt titles such as \"Committee of National Restoration\", or \"National Liberation Committee\". Military leaders often rule as a junta, selecting one of themselves as a head.<ref name=\"Cheibub_etal_2010\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11127-009-9491-2|issn=0048-5829|volume=143|issue=1\u20132|pages=67\u2013101|last=Cheibub|first=Jos\u00e9 Antonio|author2=Jennifer Gandhi|author3=James Raymond Vreeland|title=Democracy and dictatorship revisited|journal=Public Choice|date=April 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Current cases==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In [[Pakistan]], ruling Generals [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] (1977\u20131988) and [[Pervez Musharraf]] (1999\u20132008) have held [[referendums]] to elect themselves [[President of Pakistan]] for additional terms forbidden by the [[Constitution of Pakistan|constitution]].\n\n==Justification==\nIn the past, military juntas have justified their rule as a way of bringing political stability for the nation or rescuing it from the threat of \"dangerous ideologies\". For example, the threat of [[communism]], [[socialism]], and [[Islamism]] was often used. Military regimes tend to portray themselves as non-partisan, as a \"neutral\" party that can provide interim leadership in times of turmoil, and also tend to portray civilian politicians as corrupt and ineffective. One of the almost universal characteristics of a military government is the institution of [[martial law]] or a permanent [[state of emergency]].\n\nA military dictatorship is different from [[civilian dictatorship]] for a number of reasons: their motivations for seizing power, the institutions through which they organize their rule and the ways in which they leave power. Often viewing itself as saving the nation from the corrupt or myopic civilian politicians, a military dictatorship justifies its position as \"neutral\" arbiters on the basis of their membership within the armed forces. For example, many [[Junta (governing body)|juntas]] adopt titles such as \"Committee of National Restoration\", or \"National Liberation Committee\". Military leaders often rule as a junta, selecting one of themselves as a head.<ref name=\"Cheibub_etal_2010\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11127-009-9491-2|issn=0048-5829|volume=143|issue=1\u20132|pages=67\u2013101|last=Cheibub|first=Jos\u00e9 Antonio|author2=Jennifer Gandhi|author3=James Raymond Vreeland|title=Democracy and dictatorship revisited|journal=Public Choice|date=April 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Current cases==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
