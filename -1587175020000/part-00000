Though Usagi manages to restore Endymion, he ends up being killed when he fatally wounds Beryl in her attempts to kill them both, the dying Beryl being possessed by Queen Metalia who turns her host into a giant monster that Sailor Moon fights in her Princess Serenity incarnation. With the spirits of the Inner Guardians by her side, Serenity defeats Beryl and destroys all traces of Metalia at the cost of her own life. But the crystal's resonates with Usagi's dying thoughts, reviving everyone with their memories altered so they all live normal lives.\n| LineColor       = FFCCFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Sailor Moon (season 1)\n| EpisodeNumber   = \u2014\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 40\n| Title           = Day of Destiny\n| DirectedBy      = \u2014\n| WrittenBy       = \u2014\n| Aux2            = \u2014\n| Aux3            = \u2014\n| OriginalAirDate = \u2014\n| AltDate         = October 24, 1995\n| ShortSummary    = Sailor Moon and the Sailor Scouts head to the North Pole to end the Negaverse. They are confronted by Queen Beryl\u2019s Doom and Gloom Girls who capture all the Sailor Scouts leaving Sailor Moon all alone. Afterwards, Beryl summons Sailor Moon to her where Sailor Moon battles with Darien, who is under a strong brainwashing spell by Beryl. Unwilling to hurt Darien, Sailor Moon uses their locket and convinces him to touch it, which breaks the spell. Upset at losing Darien, Beryl attacks them only to be thwarted by Darien\u2019s rose. Wounded by the rose, Beryl retreats and gets powered up by the Negaverse and turned into Super Beryl. Sailor Moon confronts Beryl and the two battle. Now as Princess Serena, she calls on the other Sailor Scouts to help her, who teleport to her side and together they defeat Beryl and the Negaverse. However, the power of Sailor Moon\u2019s attack causes her and the other Sailor Scouts to no longer remember they are Sailor Scouts, their battle with Beryl, each other or their past lives and they are living their lives as normal girls.\n\n'''Note:''' This episode is a combination of scenes from episodes 45 and 46. The deaths of the Sailor Guardians, Sailor Moon, Prince Endymion, the conversation with the spirits of the Sailor Guardians and Usagi\u2019s wish to be a normal girl and the revival of all the Guardians and Endymion, are edited out shorting the two episodes enough to combine them into one.\n| LineColor       = FFCCFF\n}}\n|}\n</onlyinclude>\n\n==Home media==\n===Japanese===\n\n====VHS====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Toei Video (Japan, VHS)\n|-\n!

Though Usagi manages to restore Endymion, he ends up being killed when he fatally wounds Beryl in her attempts to kill them both, the dying Beryl being possessed by Queen Metalia who turns her host into a giant monster that Sailor Moon fights in her Princess Serenity incarnation. With the spirits of the Inner Guardians by her side, Serenity defeats Beryl and destroys all traces of Metalia at the cost of her own life. But the crystal's resonates with Usagi's dying thoughts, reviving everyone with their memories altered so they all live normal lives.\n| LineColor       = FFCCFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Sailor Moon (season 1)\n| EpisodeNumber   = \u2014\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 40\n| Title           = Day of Destiny\n| DirectedBy      = \u2014\n| WrittenBy       = \u2014\n| Aux2            = \u2014\n| Aux3            = \u2014\n| OriginalAirDate = \u2014\n| AltDate         = October 24, 1995\n| ShortSummary    = Sailor Moon and the Sailor Scouts head to the North Pole to end the Negaverse. They are confronted by Queen Beryl\u2019s Doom and Gloom Girls who capture all the Sailor Scouts leaving Sailor Moon all alone. Afterwards, Beryl summons Sailor Moon to her where Sailor Moon battles with Darien, who is under a strong brainwashing spell by Beryl. Unwilling to hurt Darien, Sailor Moon uses their locket and convinces him to touch it, which breaks the spell. Upset at losing Darien, Beryl attacks them only to be thwarted by Darien\u2019s rose. Wounded by the rose, Beryl retreats and gets powered up by the Negaverse and turned into Super Beryl. Sailor Moon confronts Beryl and the two battle. Now as Princess Serena, she calls on the other Sailor Scouts to help her, who teleport to her side and together they defeat Beryl and the Negaverse. However, the power of Sailor Moon\u2019s attack causes her and the other Sailor Scouts to no longer remember they are Sailor Scouts, their battle with Beryl, each other or their past lives and they are living their lives as normal girls.\n\n'''Note:''' This episode is a combination of scenes from episodes 45 and 46. The deaths of the Sailor Guardians, Sailor Moon, Prince Endymion, the conversation with the spirits of the Sailor Guardians and Usagi\u2019s wish to be a normal girl and the revival of all the Guardians and Endymion, are edited out shorting the two episodes enough to combine them into one.\n| LineColor       = FFCCFF\n}}\n|}\n</onlyinclude>\n\n==Home media==\n===Japanese===\n\n====VHS====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Toei Video (Japan, VHS)\n|-\n!

In July 2013, the University moved to its new permanent campus in [[Riffa]] (Al-Hajiyat), [[Bahrain]]. The new campus provides a fresh and promising learning environment and study facilities. In 2016, the University has embarked on a major expansion at the campus which includes the development of a new six-storey Academic Building and Extension of Car Parks.\n\nThe university began in 2004 with approximately 67 students and has rapidly grown since then to reach more than 1800 alumni by the end of 2015 from the different Colleges (Law, Arts, Business Administration, IT, & Architectural Engineering & Design).\n\nCapitalizing on years of progressive achievements, Kingdom University is proud of gaining confidence recognition from the Quality Assurance Authority for Education and Training (QAAET) for almost all of its programs.
