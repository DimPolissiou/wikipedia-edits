Over fourteen million people (22.2 percent) lived within the surrounding [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]] at the 2010 census, making Bangkok the nation's [[primate city]], dwarfing Thailand's other urban centres in both size and importance to the national economy.\n\nBangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] in the 15th century, which eventually grew and became the site of two capital cities: [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] in 1768 and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Rattanakosin]] in 1782. Bangkok was at the heart of the modernization of Siam, later renamed Thailand, during the late-19th century, as the country faced pressures from the West. The city was at the centre of Thailand's political struggles throughout the 20th century, as the country abolished absolute monarchy, adopted constitutional rule, and underwent numerous coups and several uprisings. The city grew rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact on Thailand's politics, economy, education, media and modern society.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe [[Tiger Cub Economies|Asian investment boom]] in the 1980s and 1990s led many multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters in Bangkok. The city is now a regional force in finance and business. It is an international hub for transport and health care, and has emerged as a centre for the arts, fashion, and entertainment. The city is known for its street life and cultural landmarks, as well as its [[red-light district]]s. The [[Grand Palace]] and [[Buddhist temple]]s including [[Wat Arun]] and [[Wat Pho]] stand in contrast with other tourist attractions such as the nightlife scenes of [[Khaosan Road]] and [[Patpong]]. Bangkok is among the world's top tourist destinations, and has been named the world's most visited city consistently in several international rankings.\n\nBangkok's rapid growth coupled with little urban planning has resulted in a haphazard cityscape and inadequate infrastructure. An inadequate road network, despite an extensive [[Thai expressway system|expressway network]], together with substantial private car usage, have led to chronic and crippling traffic congestion, which caused severe air pollution in the 1990s. The city has since turned to public transport in an attempt to solve the problem. Five rapid transit lines are now in operation, with more systems under construction or planned by the national government and the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Bangkok}}\n[[File:La Loubere map of Bangkok (English).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An engraved map titled &quot;A Map of Bancock&quot;, showing a walled settlement on the west of a river, and a fort on the east|Map of 17th-century Bangkok, from [[Simon de la Loub\u00e8re]]'s ''Du Royaume de Siam'']]\n\nThe history of Bangkok dates at least back to the early 15th century, when it was a village on the west bank of the [[Chao Phraya River]], under the rule of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]].<ref name=\"Tipawan\"/> Because of its strategic location near the mouth of the river, the town gradually increased in importance. Bangkok initially served as a customs outpost with forts on both sides of the river, and was the site of [[Siege of Bangkok|a siege in 1688]] in which the French were expelled from Siam. After the fall of Ayutthaya to the [[Konbaung dynasty|Burmese Empire]] in 1767, the newly crowned King [[Taksin]] established his capital at the town, which became the base of the [[Thonburi Kingdom]]. In 1782, King [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok]] (Rama I) succeeded Taksin, moved the capital to the eastern bank's [[Rattanakosin Island]], thus founding the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]]. The [[City Pillar]] was erected on 21 April 1782, which is regarded as the date of foundation of the present city.<ref name=\"200 years\"/>\n\nBangkok's economy gradually expanded through international trade, first with China, then with Western merchants returning in the early-to-mid 19th century. As the capital, Bangkok was the centre of Siam's modernization as it faced pressure from Western powers in the late-19th century. The reigns of Kings [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV, 1851\u201368) and [[Chulalongkorn]] (Rama V, 1868\u20131910) saw the introduction of the steam engine, printing press, rail transport and utilities infrastructure in the city, as well as formal education and healthcare. Bangkok became the centre stage for power struggles between the military and political elite as the country [[Siamese revolution of 1932|abolished absolute monarchy in 1932]].\n\n[[File:View of the city of Bangkok 1822.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving of the city from British diplomat [[John Crawfurd]]'s embassy in 1822]]\nAs Thailand allied with Japan [[Thailand in World War II|in World War II]], Bangkok was subjected to [[Bombing of Bangkok in World War II|Allied bombing]], but rapidly grew in the post-war period as a result of US aid and government-sponsored investment. Bangkok's role as a US military [[R&R (military)|R&R]] destination boosted its tourism industry as well as firmly establishing it as a sex tourism destination. Disproportionate urban development led to increasing income inequalities and migration from rural areas into Bangkok; its population surged from 1.8&nbsp;million to 3&nbsp;million in the 1960s.\n\nFollowing the US withdrawal from Vietnam in 1973, Japanese businesses took over as leaders in investment, and the expansion of export-oriented manufacturing led to growth of the financial market in Bangkok.<ref>Baker & Pongpaichit 2005, pp. 37\u201341, 45, 52\u201371, 149\u2013150, 162, 199\u2013204.</ref> Rapid growth of the city continued through the 1980s and early 1990s, until it was stalled by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. By then, many public and social issues had emerged, among them the strain on infrastructure reflected in the city's notorious traffic jams. Bangkok's role as the nation's political stage continues to be seen in strings of popular protests, from the student uprisings in [[14 October 1973 uprising|1973]] and [[Thammasat University massacre|1976]], anti-military demonstrations [[Black May (1992)|in 1992]], and successive anti-government demonstrations by opposing groups from 2008 on.\n\nAdministration of the city was first formalized by King Chulalongkorn in 1906, with the establishment of [[Monthon]] Krung Thep Phra Maha Nakhon ({{lang|th|\u0e21\u0e13\u0e11\u0e25\u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23}}) as a national subdivision. In 1915 the ''monthon'' was split into several provinces, the administrative boundaries of which have since further changed. The city in its current form was created in 1972 with the formation of the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]] (BMA), following the merger of Phra Nakhon Province on the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya and Thonburi Province on the west during the previous year.<ref name=\"200 years\"/>\n\n==Name==\nThe origin of the name ''Bangkok'' ({{lang|th|\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e01}}, pronounced in Thai as {{IPA-th|b\u0101\u02d0\u014b k\u0254\u0300\u02d0k||Th-Bangkok.ogg}}), is unclear.

Although [[urban planning]] policies date back to the commission of the \"Litchfield Plan\" in 1960, which set out strategies for land use, transportation and general infrastructure improvements, zoning regulations were not fully implemented until 1992. As a result, the city grew organically throughout the period of its rapid expansion, both horizontally as [[ribbon development]]s extended along newly built roads, and vertically, with increasing numbers of high rises and skyscrapers being built in commercial areas.<ref>{{cite book|first=Medhi |last=Krongkaew |chapter=The changing urban system in a fast-growing city and economy: The case of Bangkok and Thailand |editor1-first=Fu-chen |editor1-last=Lo |editor2-first=Yue-man |editor2-last=Yeung |title=Emerging World Cities in Pacific Asia |publisher=United Nations University Press |year=1996|isbn=978-92-808-0907-7|page=322}}</ref> The city has grown from its original centre along the river into a sprawling metropolis surrounded by swaths of suburban residential development extending north and south into neighbouring provinces. The highly populated and growing cities of [[Nonthaburi (city)|Nonthaburi]], [[Pak Kret]], [[Rangsit (city)|Rangsit]] and [[Mueang Samut Prakan District|Samut Prakan]] are effectively now suburbs of Bangkok. Nevertheless, large agricultural areas remain within the city proper at its eastern and western fringes.

It is the site of the Grand Palace and the City Pillar Shrine, primary symbols of the city's founding, as well as important Buddhist temples. Phra Nakhon, along with the neighbouring Pom Prap Sattru Phai and Samphanthawong Districts, formed what was the city proper in the late 19th century. Many traditional neighbourhoods and markets are found here, including the Chinese settlement of Sampheng. The city was expanded toward Dusit District in the early 19th century, following King Chulalongkorn's relocation of the royal household to the new [[Dusit Palace]]. The buildings of the palace, including the neoclassical [[Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall]], as well as the [[Royal Plaza (Thailand)|Royal Plaza]] and [[Ratchadamnoen Avenue]] which leads to it from the Grand Palace, reflect the heavy influence of European architecture at the time. Major government offices line the avenue, as does the [[Democracy Monument]]. The area is the site of the country's seat of power as well as the city's most popular tourist landmarks.\n\n[[File:View from Baiyoke Sky Hotel, Bangkok (7053110333) cropped.jpg|thumb|alt=A lot of high-rise buildings|The [[Sukhumvit Road|Sukhumvit]] area appears as a sea of high-rise buildings from [[Baiyoke Tower II]], the third-tallest building in Bangkok.]]\n\nIn contrast with the low-rise historic areas, the business district on [[Si Lom Road|Si Lom]] and [[Sathon Road|Sathon]] Roads in Bang Rak and Sathon Districts teems with skyscrapers. It is the site of many of the country's major corporate headquarters, but also of some of the city's [[red-light district]]s. The [[Siam area|Siam]] and [[Ratchaprasong]] areas in Pathum Wan are home to some of the largest shopping malls in [[Southeast Asia]]. Numerous retail outlets and hotels also stretch along [[Sukhumvit Road]] leading southeast through Watthana and Khlong Toei Districts. More office towers line the streets branching off Sukhumvit, especially [[Asok Montri Road|Asok Montri]], while upmarket housing is found in many of its [[soi|''soi''s]] ('alley' or 'lane').\n\nBangkok lacks a single distinct [[central business district]]. Instead, the areas of Siam and Ratchaprasong serve as a \"central shopping district\" containing many of the bigger malls and commercial areas in the city, as well as [[Siam Station]], the only transfer point between the city's two elevated train lines.<ref name=\"McGrath CSD\">{{cite book |last1=McGrath |first1= Brian |editor1-last= Benites |editor1-first= Cecilia |editor2-last= Lyster |editor2-first= Clare |title= Regarding Public Space |date=2005 |publisher= Princeton Architectural Press |location= New York|isbn= 9781568985442 |pages=46\u201353 |chapter= Bangkok's CSD}}</ref> The [[Victory Monument (Bangkok)|Victory Monument]] in Ratchathewi District is among its most important road junctions, serving over 100 bus lines as well as an elevated train station.

Most of the high-density development areas are within the {{convert|113|km2|adj=on}} area encircled by the [[Ratchadaphisek Road|Ratchadaphisek]] inner ring road. Ratchadaphisek is lined with businesses and retail outlets, and office buildings also cluster around Ratchayothin Intersection in Chatuchak District to the north. Farther from the city centre, most areas are primarily mid- or low-density residential. The Thonburi side of the city is less developed, with fewer high rises. With the exception of a few secondary urban centres, Thonburi, in the same manner as the outlying eastern districts, consists mostly of residential and rural areas.\n\nWhile most of Bangkok's streets are fronted by vernacular [[shophouse]]s, the largely unrestricted building euphoria of the 1980s has transformed the city into an urban area of skyscrapers and high rises of contrasting and clashing styles.<ref>Hamilton 2000, pp.&nbsp;465\u2013466.</ref> There are 581 skyscrapers over {{convert|90|m|abbr=off}} tall in the city.

Royal palaces and temples as well as several museums constitute its major historical and cultural tourist attractions. Shopping and dining experiences offer a wide range of choices and prices. The city is also famous for its dynamic nightlife. Although Bangkok's [[sex tourism]] scene is well known to foreigners, it is usually not openly acknowledged by locals or the government.\n\n[[File:Khao San Road at night by kevinpoh.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Night scene on a pedestrian street, with many people and street vendors; shops along the street bearing brightly lit signs with names like &quot;99Fashion&quot;, &quot;Brick Bar&quot;, &quot;Mulligans Irish Bar&quot;, and Pepsi and McDonald&#39;s logos|[[Khao San Road]] is lined by budget accommodation, shops and bars catering to tourists.]]\nAmong Bangkok's well-known sights are the Grand Palace and major Buddhist temples, including [[Wat Phra Kaew]], [[Wat Pho]], and [[Wat Arun]]. The [[Giant Swing]] and [[Erawan Shrine]] demonstrate Hinduism's deep-rooted influence in Thai culture. [[Vimanmek Mansion]] in Dusit Palace is famous as the world's largest teak building, while the [[Jim Thompson House]] provides an example of traditional [[Thai architecture]]. Other major museums include the [[Bangkok National Museum]] and the [[Royal Barge National Museum]]. Cruises and boat trips on the Chao Phraya and Thonburi's canals offer views of some of the city's traditional architecture and ways of life on the waterfront.<ref>Thavisin et al. (eds) 2006, pp.&nbsp;63\u201369.</ref>\n\nShopping venues, many of which are popular with both tourists and locals, range from the shopping centres and department stores concentrated in Siam and Ratchaprasong to the sprawling [[Chatuchak Weekend Market]]. [[Taling Chan Floating Market]] is among the few such markets in Bangkok. Yaowarat is known for its shops as well as street-side food stalls and restaurants, which are also found throughout the city. [[Khao San Road]] has long been famous as a destination for [[backpacker tourism]], with its budget accommodation, shops and bars attracting visitors from all over the world.\n\nBangkok has a reputation overseas as a major destination in the sex industry. Although [[Prostitution in Thailand|prostitution is technically illegal]] and is rarely openly discussed in Thailand, it commonly takes place among massage parlours, saunas and hourly hotels, serving foreign tourists as well as locals. Bangkok has acquired the nickname \"Sin City of Asia\" for its level of sex tourism.<ref name=\"EmmonsEveland2011\">{{cite book|last1=Emmons|first1=Ron|last2=Eveland|first2=Jennifer|last3=White|first3=Daniel|title=Frommer's Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4OnMMOZhn54C&pg=PA79|accessdate=8 April 2012|date=28 June 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-00979-6|page=79}}</ref>\n\nIssues often encountered by foreign tourists include scams, overcharging and dual pricing.

The city has long been the portal of entry of Western concepts and material goods, which have been adopted and blended with Thai values to various degrees by its residents. This is most evident in the lifestyles of the expanding middle class. [[Conspicuous consumption]] serves as a display of economic and social status, and shopping centres are popular weekend hangouts.<ref>Hamilton 2000, p.&nbsp;468.</ref> Ownership of electronics and consumer products such as mobile phones is ubiquitous. This has been accompanied by a degree of secularism, as religion's role in everyday life has rather diminished. Although such trends have spread to other urban centres, and, to a degree, the countryside, Bangkok remains at the forefront of social change.\n\nA distinct feature of Bangkok is the ubiquity of [[street vendor]]s selling goods ranging from food items to clothing and accessories. It has been estimated that the city may have over 100,000 hawkers. While the BMA has authorised the practice in 287 sites, the majority of activity in another 407 sites takes place illegally. Although they take up pavement space and block pedestrian traffic, many of the city's residents depend on these vendors for their meals, and the BMA's efforts to curb their numbers have largely been unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Street Vendors in Asia: A Review|first=Sharit K |last=Bhowmik |journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=28 May \u2013 4 June 2005 |pages=2256\u20132264}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, however, the BMA, with support from the [[National Council for Peace and Order]] (Thailand's ruling military junta), began cracking down on street vendors in a bid to reclaim public space. Many famous market neighbourhoods were affected, including [[Khlong Thom, Bangkok|Khlong Thom]], [[Saphan Lek]], and the flower market at [[Pak Khlong Talat]]. Nearly 15,000 vendors were evicted from 39 public areas in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nualkhair|first1=Chawadee|title=Bangkok's street food under threat from gentrification|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/feb/12/bangkok-street-food-stalls-under-threat|accessdate=13 February 2017|work=The Guardian|date=12 February 2017}}</ref> While some applauded the efforts to focus on pedestrian rights, others have expressed concern that [[gentrification]] would lead to the loss of the city's character and adverse changes to people's way of life.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mokkhasen|first1=Sasiwan|title=Vanishing Bangkok: What is the Capital Being Remade Into, And For Whom?|url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/bangkok/2016/07/05/reorganization/|accessdate=3 February 2017|work=Khaosod English|date=5 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Sauers|first1=Craig|title=Bangkok's disappearing street food|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20160817-bangkoks-disappearing-street-food|accessdate=3 February 2017|work=BBC Travel|date=23 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Festivals and events===\n[[File:Ratchadamnoen King80 arch.jpg|thumb|right|alt=An elaborate double archway above a road, with pictures of King Bhumibol Adulyadej; trees decorated with lights|[[Ratchadamnoen Avenue]] is annually decorated with lights and displays in celebration of [[King Bhumibol]]'s birthday.]]\nThe residents of Bangkok celebrate many of Thailand's annual festivals. During [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]] on 13\u201315 April, traditional rituals as well as water fights take place throughout the city. [[Loi Krathong]], usually in November, is accompanied by the Golden Mount Fair. New Year celebrations take place at many venues, the most prominent being the plaza in front of [[CentralWorld]]. Observances related to the royal family are held primarily in Bangkok. Wreaths are laid at King Chulalongkorn's equestrian statue in the Royal Plaza on 23 October, which is King Chulalongkorn Memorial Day. The present king's and queen's birthdays, respectively on 5 December and 12 August, are marked as Thailand's national Father's Day and national Mother's Day. These national holidays are celebrated by royal audiences on the day's eve, in which the king or queen gives a speech, and public gatherings on the day of the observance. The king's birthday is also marked by the [[Thai Royal Guards parade|Royal Guards' parade]].\n\n[[Sanam Luang]] is the site of the Thai Kite, Sport and Music Festival, usually held in March, and the [[Royal Ploughing Ceremony]] which takes place in May. The Red Cross Fair at the beginning of April is held at Suan Amporn and the Royal Plaza, and features numerous booths offering goods, games and exhibits. The [[Chinese New Year]] (January\u2013February) and [[Vegetarian Festival]] (September\u2013October) are celebrated widely by the Chinese community, especially in Yaowarat.<ref>Thavisin et al.

All six national terrestrial channels, Channels [[Channel 3 (Thailand)|3]], [[Channel 5 (Thailand)|5]] and [[Channel 7 (Thailand)|7]], [[Modernine TV|Modernine]], [[National Broadcasting Services of Thailand Television|NBT]] and [[Thai PBS]], have headquarters and main studios in the capital. With the exception of local news segments broadcast by the NBT, all programming is done in Bangkok and repeated throughout the provinces. However, this centralised model is weakening with the rise of cable television, which has many local providers. There are numerous cable and satellite [[List of television stations in Bangkok|channels based in Bangkok]]. [[TrueVisions]] is the major subscription television provider in Bangkok and Thailand, and it also carries international programming. Bangkok was home to 40 of Thailand's 311 FM radio stations and 38 of its 212 AM stations in 2002.<ref name=\"Kavi\"/> Broadcast media reform stipulated by the [[1997 Constitution of Thailand|1997 Constitution]] has been progressing slowly, although many community radio stations have emerged in the city.\n\nLikewise, Bangkok has dominated the [[Thai film industry]] since its inception. Although film settings normally feature locations throughout the country, the city is home to all major film studios. Bangkok has dozens of [[List of cinemas in Thailand|cinemas and multiplexes]], and the city hosts two major film festivals annually, the [[Bangkok International Film Festival]] and the [[World Film Festival of Bangkok]].\n\n===Art===\n[[File:BKK Art and Culture Centre (II).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A modern-looking building with a smooth curved exterior on the corner of a road junction with several paintings on the wall|The [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]], the city's major public contemporary art venue, was opened in 2008 after many delays.]]\n\nTraditional [[Thai art]], long developed within religious and royal contexts, continues to be sponsored by various government agencies in Bangkok, including the [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]]' Office of Traditional Arts. The SUPPORT Foundation in Chitralada Palace sponsors traditional and folk handicrafts. Various communities throughout the city still practice their traditional crafts, including the production of ''[[khon]]'' masks, alms bowls, and classical musical instruments. The [[National Gallery of Thailand|National Gallery]] hosts permanent collection of traditional and modern art, with temporary contemporary exhibits. Bangkok's [[contemporary art]] scene has slowly grown from relative obscurity into the public sphere over the past two decades. Private galleries gradually emerged to provide exposure for new artists, including the [[Patravadi Theatre]] and [[H Gallery]]. The centrally located [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]], opened in 2008 following a fifteen-year lobbying campaign, is now the largest public exhibition space in the city.<ref>{{cite news|title=Center Stage|first=John|last=Krich |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123623705280938041|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref> There are also many other [[List of museums and art galleries in Bangkok|art galleries and museums]], including the privately owned [[Museum of Contemporary Art (Bangkok)|Museum of Contemporary Art]].\n\nThe city's performing arts scene features traditional theatre and dance as well as Western-style plays. ''Khon'' and other traditional dances are regularly performed at the [[National Theatre (Thailand)|National Theatre]] and [[Salachalermkrung Royal Theatre]], while the [[Thailand Cultural Centre]] is a newer multi-purpose venue which also hosts musicals, orchestras and other events. [[List of theatres in Bangkok|Numerous venues]] regularly feature a variety of performances throughout the city.\n<!-- Can't use this since it's pretty much unreferenced and not really the right tone. If someone could rework the paragraph please do so.\nThe arts in Bangkok have developed almost exclusively and anonymously in the services of Theravada Buddhism since the Ayutthaya period and continuing to the present day by incorporating Western elements which is called the [[Rattanakosin style|Rattanakosin]] or Bangkok style. Nowadays, the modern art scene is centred around Bangkok as the capital of [[contemporary art]] in the region, while traditional art can be found in many commercial areas in the old city as well as temples and palaces throughout the city. There are also a number of artists who prefer to live and work outside the metropolis. The number of artists is constantly on the rise, so an increasing variety of works are available on the art market. Many art galleries in Bangkok tend to sell work restricted to traditional rural motifs. The artists creating this type of art are often influenced by traditional Buddhist beliefs and motifs, and are popular among the general Thai public. Nevertheless, some Thai artists are breaking away from these norms by addressing more controversial issues in their work, for example the loss of traditional values and the obsession with money in today's society.\n-->\n\n==Sport==\n[[File:Sepak Takraw Bangkok.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Several men playing a ball game; two of them jumping mid-air on either side of a net about eye-level high, appearing to be kicking the ball over the net; graffiti on a wall in the background|Games of [[sepak takraw]] can be spotted throughout Bangkok's parks and streets.]]\n\nAs is the national trend, [[association football]] and [[Muay Thai]] dominate Bangkok's spectator sport scene.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0e28\u0e36\u0e01\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e17\u0e19\u0e15\u0e4c \u0e01\u0e35\u0e2c\u0e32\u0e1f\u0e35\u0e40\u0e27\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c \u0e2a\u0e19\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e17\u0e35\u0e27\u0e35 |url=https://positioningmag.com/60100 |accessdate=14 March 2020 |work=Positioning Magazine |date=16 April 2015 |language=th}}</ref> [[Muangthong United F.C.|Muangthong United]], [[Bangkok United F.C.|Bangkok United]], [[Port F.C.|Port]] and [[Police Tero F.C.|Police Tero]] are major [[Thai League (football)|Thai League]] clubs based in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/investigation/313608/blemishes-in-the-beautiful-game |title=Blemishes in the beautiful game |newspaper=Bangkok Post|last=Post reporters|date=23 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hassan |first1=Hanif |title=A year of unfulfilled expectations |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/sports/1557354/a-year-of-unfulfilled-expectations |work=Bangkok Post |date=13 October 2018}}</ref> while the [[Rajadamnern Stadium|Rajadamnern]] and [[Lumpini Stadium|Lumpini]] stadiums are the main kickboxing venues.\n\nWhile [[sepak takraw]] can be seen played in open spaces throughout the city, football and other modern sports are now the norm.

[[Charoen Krung Road]], the first to be built by Western techniques, was completed in 1864. Since then, the road network has vastly expanded to accommodate the sprawling city. A complex elevated [[Thai expressway system|expressway network]] helps bring traffic into and out of the city centre, but Bangkok's rapid growth has put a large strain on infrastructure, and traffic jams have plagued the city since the 1990s. Although rail transport was introduced in 1893 and electric trams served the city from 1894 to 1968, it was only in 1999 that Bangkok's first [[rapid transit]] system began operation. Older public transport systems include an extensive bus network and [[Water transport in Bangkok|boat services]] which still operate on the Chao Phraya and two canals. Taxis appear in the form of cars, motorcycles, and \"''[[tuk-tuk]]''\" auto rickshaws.\n\nBangkok is connected to the rest of the country through the [[Thai highway network|national highway]] and [[Rail transport in Thailand|rail networks]], as well as by domestic flights to and from the city's two international airports. Its centuries-old maritime transport of goods is still conducted through Khlong Toei Port.\n\nThe BMA is largely responsible for overseeing the construction and maintenance of the road network and transport systems through its Public Works Department and Traffic and Transportation Department. However, many separate government agencies are also in charge of the individual systems, and much of transport-related policy planning and funding is contributed to by the national government.\n\n===Roads===\nRoad-based transport is the primary mode of travel in Bangkok. Due to the city's organic development, its streets do not follow an organized grid structure. Forty-eight major roads link the different areas of the city, branching into smaller streets and lanes (''[[soi]]'') which serve local neighbourhoods. Eleven bridges over the Chao Phraya link the two sides of the city, while several expressway and [[Thai motorway network|motorway]] routes bring traffic into and out of the city centre and link with nearby provinces.\n\n[[File:TrafficInBangkok.jpg|thumb|left|Traffic jams, seen here on [[Ratchadamri Road]], are common in Bangkok.]]\n\nBangkok's rapid growth in the 1980s resulted in sharp increases in vehicle ownership and traffic demand, which have since continued\u2014in 2006 there were 3,943,211 in-use vehicles in Bangkok, of which 37.6 percent were private cars and 32.9 percent were motorcycles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Developing Integrated Emission Strategies for Existing Land-transport |url=http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/system/files/articles-72628_Ch3.pdf |publisher=Clean Air Initiative |accessdate=15 September 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603110642/http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/system/files/articles-72628_Ch3.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df= }}</ref> These increases, in the face of limited carrying capacity, caused severe traffic congestion evident by the early 1990s.

Over fourteen million people (22.2 percent) lived within the surrounding [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]] at the 2010 census, making Bangkok the nation's [[primate city]], dwarfing Thailand's other urban centres in both size and importance to the national economy.\n\nBangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] in the 15th century, which eventually grew and became the site of two capital cities: [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] in 1768 and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Rattanakosin]] in 1782. Bangkok was at the heart of the modernization of Siam, later renamed Thailand, during the late-19th century, as the country faced pressures from the West. The city was at the centre of Thailand's political struggles throughout the 20th century, as the country abolished absolute monarchy, adopted constitutional rule, and underwent numerous coups and several uprisings. The city grew rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact on Thailand's politics, economy, education, media and modern society.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe [[Tiger Cub Economies|Asian investment boom]] in the 1980s and 1990s led many multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters in Bangkok. The city is now a regional force in finance and business. It is an international hub for transport and health care, and has emerged as a centre for the arts, fashion, and entertainment. The city is known for its street life and cultural landmarks, as well as its [[red-light district]]s. The [[Grand Palace]] and [[Buddhist temple]]s including [[Wat Arun]] and [[Wat Pho]] stand in contrast with other tourist attractions such as the nightlife scenes of [[Khaosan Road]] and [[Patpong]]. Bangkok is among the world's top tourist destinations, and has been named the world's most visited city consistently in several international rankings.\n\nBangkok's rapid growth coupled with little urban planning has resulted in a haphazard cityscape and inadequate infrastructure. An inadequate road network, despite an extensive [[Thai expressway system|expressway network]], together with substantial private car usage, have led to chronic and crippling traffic congestion, which caused severe air pollution in the 1990s. The city has since turned to public transport in an attempt to solve the problem. Five rapid transit lines are now in operation, with more systems under construction or planned by the national government and the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Bangkok}}\n[[File:La Loubere map of Bangkok (English).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An engraved map titled &quot;A Map of Bancock&quot;, showing a walled settlement on the west of a river, and a fort on the east|Map of 17th-century Bangkok, from [[Simon de la Loub\u00e8re]]'s ''Du Royaume de Siam'']]\n\nThe history of Bangkok dates at least back to the early 15th century, when it was a village on the west bank of the [[Chao Phraya River]], under the rule of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]].<ref name=\"Tipawan\"/> Because of its strategic location near the mouth of the river, the town gradually increased in importance. Bangkok initially served as a customs outpost with forts on both sides of the river, and was the site of [[Siege of Bangkok|a siege in 1688]] in which the French were expelled from Siam. After the fall of Ayutthaya to the [[Konbaung dynasty|Burmese Empire]] in 1767, the newly crowned King [[Taksin]] established his capital at the town, which became the base of the [[Thonburi Kingdom]]. In 1782, King [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok]] (Rama I) succeeded Taksin, moved the capital to the eastern bank's [[Rattanakosin Island]], thus founding the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]]. The [[City Pillar]] was erected on 21 April 1782, which is regarded as the date of foundation of the present city.<ref name=\"200 years\"/>\n\nBangkok's economy gradually expanded through international trade, first with China, then with Western merchants returning in the early-to-mid 19th century. As the capital, Bangkok was the centre of Siam's modernization as it faced pressure from Western powers in the late-19th century. The reigns of Kings [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV, 1851\u201368) and [[Chulalongkorn]] (Rama V, 1868\u20131910) saw the introduction of the steam engine, printing press, rail transport and utilities infrastructure in the city, as well as formal education and healthcare.

Bangkok's role as a US military [[R&R (military)|R&R]] destination boosted its tourism industry as well as firmly establishing it as a sex tourism destination. Disproportionate urban development led to increasing income inequalities and migration from rural areas into Bangkok; its population surged from 1.8&nbsp;million to 3&nbsp;million in the 1960s.\n\nFollowing the US withdrawal from Vietnam in 1973, Japanese businesses took over as leaders in investment, and the expansion of export-oriented manufacturing led to growth of the financial market in Bangkok.<ref>Baker & Pongpaichit 2005, pp. 37\u201341, 45, 52\u201371, 149\u2013150, 162, 199\u2013204.</ref> Rapid growth of the city continued through the 1980s and early 1990s, until it was stalled by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]].

Although [[urban planning]] policies date back to the commission of the \"Litchfield Plan\" in 1960, which set out strategies for land use, transportation and general infrastructure improvements, zoning regulations were not fully implemented until 1992. As a result, the city grew organically throughout the period of its rapid expansion, both horizontally as [[ribbon development]]s extended along newly built roads, and vertically, with increasing numbers of high rises and skyscrapers being built in commercial areas.<ref>{{cite book|first=Medhi |last=Krongkaew |chapter=The changing urban system in a fast-growing city and economy: The case of Bangkok and Thailand |editor1-first=Fu-chen |editor1-last=Lo |editor2-first=Yue-man |editor2-last=Yeung |title=Emerging World Cities in Pacific Asia |publisher=United Nations University Press |year=1996|isbn=978-92-808-0907-7|page=322}}</ref> The city has grown from its original centre along the river into a sprawling metropolis surrounded by swaths of suburban residential development extending north and south into neighbouring provinces. The highly populated and growing cities of [[Nonthaburi (city)|Nonthaburi]], [[Pak Kret]], [[Rangsit (city)|Rangsit]] and [[Mueang Samut Prakan District|Samut Prakan]] are effectively now suburbs of Bangkok. Nevertheless, large agricultural areas remain within the city proper at its eastern and western fringes. Land use in the city consists of 23 percent residential use, 24 percent agriculture, and 30 percent used for commerce, industry, and government.<ref name=\"BMA geo\"/> The BMA's City Planning Department (CPD) is responsible for planning and shaping further development.

It is the site of the Grand Palace and the City Pillar Shrine, primary symbols of the city's founding, as well as important Buddhist temples. Phra Nakhon, along with the neighbouring Pom Prap Sattru Phai and Samphanthawong Districts, formed what was the city proper in the late 19th century. Many traditional neighbourhoods and markets are found here, including the Chinese settlement of Sampheng. The city was expanded toward Dusit District in the early 19th century, following King Chulalongkorn's relocation of the royal household to the new [[Dusit Palace]]. The buildings of the palace, including the neoclassical [[Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall]], as well as the [[Royal Plaza (Thailand)|Royal Plaza]] and [[Ratchadamnoen Avenue]] which leads to it from the Grand Palace, reflect the heavy influence of European architecture at the time. Major government offices line the avenue, as does the [[Democracy Monument]]. The area is the site of the country's seat of power as well as the city's most popular tourist landmarks.\n\n[[File:View from Baiyoke Sky Hotel, Bangkok (7053110333) cropped.jpg|thumb|alt=A lot of high-rise buildings|The [[Sukhumvit Road|Sukhumvit]] area appears as a sea of high-rise buildings from [[Baiyoke Tower II]], the third-tallest building in Bangkok.]]\n\nIn contrast with the low-rise historic areas, the business district on [[Si Lom Road|Si Lom]] and [[Sathon Road|Sathon]] Roads in Bang Rak and Sathon Districts teems with skyscrapers. It is the site of many of the country's major corporate headquarters, but also of some of the city's [[red-light district]]s. The [[Siam area|Siam]] and [[Ratchaprasong]] areas in Pathum Wan are home to some of the largest shopping malls in [[Southeast Asia]]. Numerous retail outlets and hotels also stretch along [[Sukhumvit Road]] leading southeast through Watthana and Khlong Toei Districts. More office towers line the streets branching off Sukhumvit, especially [[Asok Montri Road|Asok Montri]], while upmarket housing is found in many of its [[soi|''soi''s]] ('alley' or 'lane').\n\nBangkok lacks a single distinct [[central business district]]. Instead, the areas of Siam and Ratchaprasong serve as a \"central shopping district\" containing many of the bigger malls and commercial areas in the city, as well as [[Siam Station]], the only transfer point between the city's two elevated train lines.<ref name=\"McGrath CSD\">{{cite book |last1=McGrath |first1= Brian |editor1-last= Benites |editor1-first= Cecilia |editor2-last= Lyster |editor2-first= Clare |title= Regarding Public Space |date=2005 |publisher= Princeton Architectural Press |location= New York|isbn= 9781568985442 |pages=46\u201353 |chapter= Bangkok's CSD}}</ref> The [[Victory Monument (Bangkok)|Victory Monument]] in Ratchathewi District is among its most important road junctions, serving over 100 bus lines as well as an elevated train station. From the monument, [[Phahonyothin Road|Phahonyothin]] and [[Ratchawithi Road|Ratchawithi]]&nbsp;/ Din Daeng Roads respectively run north and east linking to major residential areas. Most of the high-density development areas are within the {{convert|113|km2|adj=on}} area encircled by the [[Ratchadaphisek Road|Ratchadaphisek]] inner ring road. Ratchadaphisek is lined with businesses and retail outlets, and office buildings also cluster around Ratchayothin Intersection in Chatuchak District to the north. Farther from the city centre, most areas are primarily mid- or low-density residential. The Thonburi side of the city is less developed, with fewer high rises. With the exception of a few secondary urban centres, Thonburi, in the same manner as the outlying eastern districts, consists mostly of residential and rural areas.\n\nWhile most of Bangkok's streets are fronted by vernacular [[shophouse]]s, the largely unrestricted building euphoria of the 1980s has transformed the city into an urban area of skyscrapers and high rises of contrasting and clashing styles.<ref>Hamilton 2000, pp.&nbsp;465\u2013466.</ref> There are 581 skyscrapers over {{convert|90|m|abbr=off}} tall in the city.

The city has long been the portal of entry of Western concepts and material goods, which have been adopted and blended with Thai values to various degrees by its residents. This is most evident in the lifestyles of the expanding middle class. [[Conspicuous consumption]] serves as a display of economic and social status, and shopping centres are popular weekend hangouts.<ref>Hamilton 2000, p.&nbsp;468.</ref> Ownership of electronics and consumer products such as mobile phones is ubiquitous. This has been accompanied by a degree of secularism, as religion's role in everyday life has rather diminished. Although such trends have spread to other urban centres, and, to a degree, the countryside, Bangkok remains at the forefront of social change.\n\nA distinct feature of Bangkok is the ubiquity of [[street vendor]]s selling goods ranging from food items to clothing and accessories. It has been estimated that the city may have over 100,000 hawkers. While the BMA has authorised the practice in 287 sites, the majority of activity in another 407 sites takes place illegally. Although they take up pavement space and block pedestrian traffic, many of the city's residents depend on these vendors for their meals, and the BMA's efforts to curb their numbers have largely been unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Street Vendors in Asia: A Review|first=Sharit K |last=Bhowmik |journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=28 May \u2013 4 June 2005 |pages=2256\u20132264}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, however, the BMA, with support from the [[National Council for Peace and Order]] (Thailand's ruling military junta), began cracking down on street vendors in a bid to reclaim public space. Many famous market neighbourhoods were affected, including [[Khlong Thom, Bangkok|Khlong Thom]], [[Saphan Lek]], and the flower market at [[Pak Khlong Talat]].

During [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]] on 13\u201315 April, traditional rituals as well as water fights take place throughout the city. [[Loi Krathong]], usually in November, is accompanied by the Golden Mount Fair. New Year celebrations take place at many venues, the most prominent being the plaza in front of [[CentralWorld]]. Observances related to the royal family are held primarily in Bangkok. Wreaths are laid at King Chulalongkorn's equestrian statue in the Royal Plaza on 23 October, which is King Chulalongkorn Memorial Day. The present king's and queen's birthdays, respectively on 5 December and 12 August, are marked as Thailand's national Father's Day and national Mother's Day. These national holidays are celebrated by royal audiences on the day's eve, in which the king or queen gives a speech, and public gatherings on the day of the observance. The king's birthday is also marked by the [[Thai Royal Guards parade|Royal Guards' parade]].\n\n[[Sanam Luang]] is the site of the Thai Kite, Sport and Music Festival, usually held in March, and the [[Royal Ploughing Ceremony]] which takes place in May. The Red Cross Fair at the beginning of April is held at Suan Amporn and the Royal Plaza, and features numerous booths offering goods, games and exhibits. The [[Chinese New Year]] (January\u2013February) and [[Vegetarian Festival]] (September\u2013October) are celebrated widely by the Chinese community, especially in Yaowarat.<ref>Thavisin et al.

With the exception of local news segments broadcast by the NBT, all programming is done in Bangkok and repeated throughout the provinces. However, this centralised model is weakening with the rise of cable television, which has many local providers. There are numerous cable and satellite [[List of television stations in Bangkok|channels based in Bangkok]]. [[TrueVisions]] is the major subscription television provider in Bangkok and Thailand, and it also carries international programming. Bangkok was home to 40 of Thailand's 311 FM radio stations and 38 of its 212 AM stations in 2002.<ref name=\"Kavi\"/> Broadcast media reform stipulated by the [[1997 Constitution of Thailand|1997 Constitution]] has been progressing slowly, although many community radio stations have emerged in the city.\n\nLikewise, Bangkok has dominated the [[Thai film industry]] since its inception. Although film settings normally feature locations throughout the country, the city is home to all major film studios. Bangkok has dozens of [[List of cinemas in Thailand|cinemas and multiplexes]], and the city hosts two major film festivals annually, the [[Bangkok International Film Festival]] and the [[World Film Festival of Bangkok]].\n\n===Art===\n[[File:BKK Art and Culture Centre (II).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A modern-looking building with a smooth curved exterior on the corner of a road junction with several paintings on the wall|The [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]], the city's major public contemporary art venue, was opened in 2008 after many delays.]]\n\nTraditional [[Thai art]], long developed within religious and royal contexts, continues to be sponsored by various government agencies in Bangkok, including the [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]]' Office of Traditional Arts. The SUPPORT Foundation in Chitralada Palace sponsors traditional and folk handicrafts. Various communities throughout the city still practice their traditional crafts, including the production of ''[[khon]]'' masks, alms bowls, and classical musical instruments. The [[National Gallery of Thailand|National Gallery]] hosts permanent collection of traditional and modern art, with temporary contemporary exhibits. Bangkok's [[contemporary art]] scene has slowly grown from relative obscurity into the public sphere over the past two decades. Private galleries gradually emerged to provide exposure for new artists, including the [[Patravadi Theatre]] and [[H Gallery]]. The centrally located [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]], opened in 2008 following a fifteen-year lobbying campaign, is now the largest public exhibition space in the city.<ref>{{cite news|title=Center Stage|first=John|last=Krich |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123623705280938041|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref> There are also many other [[List of museums and art galleries in Bangkok|art galleries and museums]], including the privately owned [[Museum of Contemporary Art (Bangkok)|Museum of Contemporary Art]].\n\nThe city's performing arts scene features traditional theatre and dance as well as Western-style plays.

Nowadays, the modern art scene is centred around Bangkok as the capital of [[contemporary art]] in the region, while traditional art can be found in many commercial areas in the old city as well as temples and palaces throughout the city. There are also a number of artists who prefer to live and work outside the metropolis. The number of artists is constantly on the rise, so an increasing variety of works are available on the art market. Many art galleries in Bangkok tend to sell work restricted to traditional rural motifs. The artists creating this type of art are often influenced by traditional Buddhist beliefs and motifs, and are popular among the general Thai public. Nevertheless, some Thai artists are breaking away from these norms by addressing more controversial issues in their work, for example the loss of traditional values and the obsession with money in today's society.\n-->\n\n==Sport==\n[[File:Sepak Takraw Bangkok.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Several men playing a ball game; two of them jumping mid-air on either side of a net about eye-level high, appearing to be kicking the ball over the net; graffiti on a wall in the background|Games of [[sepak takraw]] can be spotted throughout Bangkok's parks and streets.]]\n\nAs is the national trend, [[association football]] and [[Muay Thai]] dominate Bangkok's spectator sport scene.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0e28\u0e36\u0e01\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e17\u0e19\u0e15\u0e4c \u0e01\u0e35\u0e2c\u0e32\u0e1f\u0e35\u0e40\u0e27\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c \u0e2a\u0e19\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e17\u0e35\u0e27\u0e35 |url=https://positioningmag.com/60100 |accessdate=14 March 2020 |work=Positioning Magazine |date=16 April 2015 |language=th}}</ref> [[Muangthong United F.C.|Muangthong United]], [[Bangkok United F.C.|Bangkok United]], [[Port F.C.|Port]] and [[Police Tero F.C.|Police Tero]] are major [[Thai League (football)|Thai League]] clubs based in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/investigation/313608/blemishes-in-the-beautiful-game |title=Blemishes in the beautiful game |newspaper=Bangkok Post|last=Post reporters|date=23 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hassan |first1=Hanif |title=A year of unfulfilled expectations |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/sports/1557354/a-year-of-unfulfilled-expectations |work=Bangkok Post |date=13 October 2018}}</ref> while the [[Rajadamnern Stadium|Rajadamnern]] and [[Lumpini Stadium|Lumpini]] stadiums are the main kickboxing venues.\n\nWhile [[sepak takraw]] can be seen played in open spaces throughout the city, football and other modern sports are now the norm.

[[Charoen Krung Road]], the first to be built by Western techniques, was completed in 1864. Since then, the road network has vastly expanded to accommodate the sprawling city. A complex elevated [[Thai expressway system|expressway network]] helps bring traffic into and out of the city centre, but Bangkok's rapid growth has put a large strain on infrastructure, and traffic jams have plagued the city since the 1990s. Although rail transport was introduced in 1893 and electric trams served the city from 1894 to 1968, it was only in 1999 that Bangkok's first [[rapid transit]] system began operation. Older public transport systems include an extensive bus network and [[Water transport in Bangkok|boat services]] which still operate on the Chao Phraya and two canals. Taxis appear in the form of cars, motorcycles, and \"''[[tuk-tuk]]''\" auto rickshaws.\n\nBangkok is connected to the rest of the country through the [[Thai highway network|national highway]] and [[Rail transport in Thailand|rail networks]], as well as by domestic flights to and from the city's two international airports. Its centuries-old maritime transport of goods is still conducted through Khlong Toei Port.\n\nThe BMA is largely responsible for overseeing the construction and maintenance of the road network and transport systems through its Public Works Department and Traffic and Transportation Department. However, many separate government agencies are also in charge of the individual systems, and much of transport-related policy planning and funding is contributed to by the national government.\n\n===Roads===\nRoad-based transport is the primary mode of travel in Bangkok. Due to the city's organic development, its streets do not follow an organized grid structure. Forty-eight major roads link the different areas of the city, branching into smaller streets and lanes (''[[soi]]'') which serve local neighbourhoods. Eleven bridges over the Chao Phraya link the two sides of the city, while several expressway and [[Thai motorway network|motorway]] routes bring traffic into and out of the city centre and link with nearby provinces.\n\n[[File:TrafficInBangkok.jpg|thumb|left|Traffic jams, seen here on [[Ratchadamri Road]], are common in Bangkok.]]\n\nBangkok's rapid growth in the 1980s resulted in sharp increases in vehicle ownership and traffic demand, which have since continued\u2014in 2006 there were 3,943,211 in-use vehicles in Bangkok, of which 37.6 percent were private cars and 32.9 percent were motorcycles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Developing Integrated Emission Strategies for Existing Land-transport |url=http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/system/files/articles-72628_Ch3.pdf |publisher=Clean Air Initiative |accessdate=15 September 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603110642/http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/system/files/articles-72628_Ch3.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df= }}</ref> These increases, in the face of limited carrying capacity, caused severe traffic congestion evident by the early 1990s.

Bangkok became not only a place where immigrants and provincial Thais go for job opportunities, but also for a chance to receive a university degree. [[Ramkhamhaeng University]] emerged in 1971 as Thailand's first open university; it now has the highest enrolment in the country. The demand for higher education has led to the founding of many other universities and colleges, both public and private. While many universities have been established in major provinces, the Greater Bangkok region remains home to the greater majority of institutions, and the city's tertiary education scene remains over-populated with non-Bangkokians. The situation is not limited to higher education, either. In the 1960s, 60 to 70 percent of 10- to 19-year-olds who were in school had migrated to Bangkok for secondary education. This was due to both a lack of secondary schools in the provinces and perceived higher standards of education in the capital.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Sukanya|last=Nitungkorn |title=The problems of secondary education expansion in Thailand |journal=Southeast Asian Studies|volume=26|issue=1|date=June 1988 |url=http://kyoto-seas.org/pdf/26/1/260102.pdf|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref> Although this discrepancy has since largely abated, tens of thousands of students still compete for places in Bangkok's leading schools.

Mentioned by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres in 1845 and by Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, who were both convinced that it was a Leonardo original. According to the world's top Leonardo expert Professor Carlo Pedretti, this painting \"is wholly similar to the one in the Louvre\" (see http://www.italymagazine.com/italy/marche/virgin-rocks-smash-hit, Italy Magazine, \"Virgin of the rocks a smash hit,\" 9 November, 2005). Pedretti says the work - only recently recovered from another private collection - shows \"clear signs\" of the master's hand. Following detailed restoration of the work, Pedretti is convinced that it is an original Leonardo (Leonardo da Vinci : the \"Virgin of the rocks\" in the Cheramy version : its history & critical fortune, by Carlo Pedretti and Sara Taglialagamba, 2017).]]\n[[File:Giampietrino - St. John - Hermitage.jpg|thumbnail|''[[John the Evangelist|St. John]] in Hermitage'']]\n[[File:Giampietrino 01.jpg|thumbnail|File:Giampietrino 01.jpg|''Christ with the Symbol of the Trinity'']]\n[[File:Giampietrino - San Juan Bautista.jpg|thumbnail|''St. John the Baptist'']]\n[[File:Giampietrino 07.JPG|thumbnail|''Salome'']]\n[[File:Giampietrino 05.jpg|thumbnail|''Diana the Huntress'']]\n* '''Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum'''\n** Mary with the Child.

Many of his works are preserved in multiple versions of the same subject.\n\n==Selected works==\n[[File:Vergine delle Rocce cheramy.jpg|thumbnail| ''Vergine delle Rocce'' or ''Virgin of the Rocks Cheramy'', a meticulous copy of ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' in the Louvre painted by Leonardo da Vinci. Recently the subject of a new book (2017) and attributed to Leonardo and workshop by Professor Carlo Pedretti. Previously incorrectly attributed only to Giampetrino. Mentioned by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres in 1845 and by Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, who were both convinced that it was a Leonardo original. According to the world's top Leonardo expert Professor Carlo Pedretti, this painting \"is wholly similar to the one in the Louvre\" (see http://www.italymagazine.com/italy/marche/virgin-rocks-smash-hit, Italy Magazine, \"Virgin of the rocks a smash hit,\" 9 November, 2005). Pedretti says the work - only recently recovered from another private collection - shows \"clear signs\" of the master's hand. Following detailed restoration of the work, Pedretti is convinced that it is an original Leonardo (Leonardo da Vinci : the \"Virgin of the rocks\" in the Cheramy version : its history & critical fortune, by Carlo Pedretti and Sara Taglialagamba, 2017).]]\n[[File:Giampietrino - St. John - Hermitage.jpg|thumbnail|''[[John the Evangelist|St. John]] in Hermitage'']]\n[[File:Giampietrino 01.jpg|thumbnail|File:Giampietrino 01.jpg|''Christ with the Symbol of the Trinity'']]\n[[File:Giampietrino - San Juan Bautista.jpg|thumbnail|''St. John the Baptist'']]\n[[File:Giampietrino 07.JPG|thumbnail|''Salome'']]\n[[File:Giampietrino 05.jpg|thumbnail|''Diana the Huntress'']]\n* '''Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum'''\n** Mary with the Child.

It is the principal language of education and government and spoken throughout the country. The standard is based on the dialect of the central Thai people, and it is written in the [[Thai alphabet]].\n\nThai has undergone various historical sound changes.  Some of the most significant changes occurred during the evolution from Old Thai to modern Thai. The Thai writing system has an eight-century history and many of these changes, especially in consonants and tones, are evidenced in the modern [[Thai alphabet|orthography]].\n\n===Old Thai===\nOld Thai had a three-way tone distinction on live syllables (those not ending in a stop), with no possible distinction on dead syllables (those ending in a stop, i.e. either {{IPA|/p/, /t/, /k/}} or the [[glottal stop]] which automatically closes syllables otherwise ending in a short vowel).\n\nThere was a two-way voiced vs. voiceless distinction among all [[fricative]] and [[sonorant]] consonants, and up to a four-way distinction among [[stop consonant|stop]]s and [[affricate]]s.  The maximal four-way occurred in [[labial consonant|labial]]s ({{IPA|/p p\u02b0 b \u0294b/}}) and [[dental consonant|dental]]s ({{IPA|/t t\u02b0 d \u0294d/}}); the three-way distinction among [[velar consonant|velar]]s ({{IPA|/k k\u02b0 \u0261/}}) and [[palatal consonant|palatal]]s ({{IPA|/t\u0255 t\u0255\u02b0 d\u0291/}}), with the glottalized member of each set apparently missing.\n\nThe major change between old and modern Thai was due to voicing distinction losses and the concomitant [[tone split]].  This may have happened between about 1300 and 1600 CE, possibly occurring at different times in different parts of the Thai-speaking area.  All voiced\u2013voiceless pairs of consonants lost the voicing distinction:\n*Plain voiced stops ({{IPA|/b d \u0261 d\u0291/}}) became voiceless aspirated stops ({{IPA|/p\u02b0 t\u02b0 k\u02b0 t\u0255\u02b0/}}).<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"Explanation 4\">The glottalized stops {{IPA|/\u0294b \u0294d/}} were unaffected, as they were treated in every respect like voiceless unaspirated stops due to the initial glottal stop. These stops are often described in the modern language as phonemically plain stops {{IPA|/b d/}}, but the glottalization is still commonly heard.</ref>\n*Voiced fricatives became voiceless.\n*Voiceless sonorants became voiced.\nHowever, in the process of these mergers the former distinction of voice was transferred into a new set of tonal distinctions.  In essence, every tone in Old Thai split into two new tones, with a lower-pitched tone corresponding to a syllable that formerly began with a voiced consonant, and a higher-pitched tone corresponding to a syllable that formerly began with a voiceless consonant (including glottalized stops).  An additional complication is that formerly voiceless unaspirated stops/affricates (original {{IPA|/p t k t\u0255 \u0294b \u0294d/}}) also caused original tone 1 to lower, but had no such effect on original tones 2 or 3.\n\nThe above consonant mergers and tone splits account for the complex relationship between spelling and sound in modern Thai.  Modern \"low\"-class consonants were voiced in Old Thai, and the terminology \"low\" reflects the lower tone variants that resulted.  Modern \"mid\"-class consonants were voiceless unaspirated stops or affricates in Old Thai\u2014precisely the class that triggered lowering in original tone 1 but not tones 2 or 3.  Modern \"high\"-class consonants were the remaining voiceless consonants in Old Thai (voiceless fricatives, voiceless sonorants, voiceless aspirated stops).  The three most common tone \"marks\" (the lack of any tone mark, as well as the two marks termed ''mai ek'' and ''mai tho'') represent the three tones of Old Thai, and the complex relationship between tone mark and actual tone is due to the various tonal changes since then.  Since the tone split, the tones have changed in actual representation to the point that the former relationship between lower and higher tonal variants has been completely obscured.  Furthermore, the six tones that resulted after the three tones of Old Thai were split have since merged into five in standard Thai, with the lower variant of former tone 2 merging with the higher variant of former tone 3, becoming the modern \"falling\" tone.<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"Explanation 5\">Modern [[Lao language|Lao]] and [[Northern Thai language|northern Thai dialects]] are often described as having six tones, but these are not necessarily due to preservation of the original six tones resulting from the tone split.  For example, in standard Lao, both the high and low variants of Old Thai tone 2 merged; however, the mid-class variant of tone 1 became pronounced differently from either the high-class or low-class variants, and all three eventually became phonemic due to further changes, e.g. {{IPA|/kr/}} > {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}}.  For similar reasons, Lao has developed more than two tonal distinctions in \"dead\" syllables.</ref>\n\n====Early Old Thai====\n{{further information|Proto-Tai}}\nEarly Old Thai also apparently had velar fricatives {{IPA|/x \u0263/}} as distinct phonemes.  These were represented by the now-obsolete letters \u0e03 ''kho khuat'' and \u0e05 ''kho khon'', respectively.  During the Old Thai period, these sounds merged into the corresponding stops {{IPA|/k\u02b0 \u0261/}}, and as a result the use of these letters became unstable.\n\nAt some point in the history of Thai, a palatal nasal phoneme {{IPA|/\u0272/}} also existed, inherited from [[Proto-Tai]].  A letter \u0e0d ''yo ying'' also exists, which is used to represent a palatal nasal in words borrowed from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]], and is currently pronounced {{IPA|/j/}} at the beginning of a syllable but {{IPA|/n/}} at the end of a syllable.  Most native Thai words that are reconstructed as beginning with {{IPA|/\u0272/}} are also pronounced {{IPA|/j/}} in modern Thai, but generally spelled with \u0e22 ''yo yak'', which consistently represents {{IPA|/j/}}.  This suggests that {{IPA|/\u0272/}} > {{IPA|/j/}} in native words occurred in the pre-literary period.  It is unclear whether Sanskrit and Pali words beginning with {{IPA|/\u0272/}} were borrowed directly with a {{IPA|/j/}}, or whether a {{IPA|/\u0272/}} was re-introduced, followed by a second change {{IPA|/\u0272/}} > {{IPA|/j/}}.\n\nProto-Tai also had a glottalized palatal sound, reconstructed as {{IPA|/\u0294j/}} in Li Fang-Kuei (1977{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}).  Corresponding Thai words are generally spelled \u0e2b\u0e22, which implies an Old Thai pronunciation of {{IPA|/hj/}} (or {{IPA|/j\u030a/}}), but a few such words are spelled \u0e2d\u0e22, which implies a pronunciation of {{IPA|/\u0294j/}} and suggests that the glottalization may have persisted through to the early literary period.\n\n===Vowel developments===\nThe vowel system of modern Thai contains nine pure vowels and three centering diphthongs, each of which can occur short or long. According to Li (1977{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}), however, many Thai dialects have only one such short\u2013long pair ({{IPA|/a a\u02d0/}}), and in general it is difficult or impossible to find minimal short\u2013long pairs in Thai that involve vowels other than {{IPA|/a/}} and where both members have frequent correspondences throughout the Tai languages.  More specifically, he notes the following facts about Thai:\n*In [[open syllable]]s, only long vowels occur. (This assumes that all apparent cases of short open syllables are better described as ending in a glottal stop.  This makes sense from the lack of tonal distinctions in such syllables, and the glottal stop is also reconstructible across the Tai languages.)\n*In [[closed syllable]]s, the long high vowels {{IPA|/i\u02d0 \u026f\u02d0 u\u02d0/}} are rare, and cases that do exist typically have diphthongs in other Tai languages.\n*In closed syllables, both short and long mid {{IPA|/e e\u02d0 o o\u02d0/}} and low {{IPA|/\u025b \u025b\u02d0 \u0254 \u0254\u02d0/}} do occur.  However, generally, only words with short {{IPA|/e o/}} and long {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0 \u0254\u02d0/}} are reconstructible back to Proto-Tai.\n*Both of the mid back unrounded vowels {{IPA|/\u0264 \u0264\u02d0/}} are rare, and words with such sounds generally cannot be reconstructed back to Proto-Tai.\nFurthermore, the vowel that corresponds to short Thai {{IPA|/a/}} has a different and often higher quality in many of the Tai languages compared with the vowel corresponding to Thai {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}.\n\nThis leads Li to posit the following:\n#Proto-Tai had a system of nine pure vowels with no length distinction, and possessing approximately the same qualities as in modern Thai: high {{IPA|/i \u026f u/}}, mid {{IPA|/e \u0264 o/}}, low {{IPA|/\u025b a \u0254/}}.\n#All Proto-Tai vowels were lengthened in open syllables, and low vowels were also lengthened in closed syllables.\n#Modern Thai largely preserved the original lengths and qualities, but lowered {{IPA|/\u0264/}} to {{IPA|/a/}}, which became short {{IPA|/a/}} in closed syllables and created a phonemic length distinction {{IPA|/a a\u02d0/}}.  Eventually, length in all other vowels became phonemic as well and a new {{IPA|/\u0264/}} (both short and long) was introduced, through a combination of borrowing and sound change.  Li believes that the development of long {{IPA|/i\u02d0 \u026f\u02d0 u\u02d0/}} from diphthongs, and the lowering of {{IPA|/\u0264/}} to {{IPA|/a/}} to create a length distinction {{IPA|/a a\u02d0/}}, had occurred by the time of Proto-Southwestern-Tai, but the other missing modern Thai vowels had not yet developed.\n\nNote that not all researchers agree with Li.  Pittayaporn (2009{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}), for example, reconstructs a similar system for Proto-Southwestern-Tai, but believes that there was also a mid back unrounded vowel {{IPA|/\u0259/}} (which he describes as {{IPA|/\u0264/}}), occurring only before final velar {{IPA|/k \u014b/}}.  He also seems to believe that the Proto-Southwestern-Tai vowel length distinctions can be reconstructed back to similar distinctions in Proto-Tai.\n\n===Connection to ancient Yue language(s)===\n{{further|Baiyue#Language|Chu_(state)#Linguistic_influences}}\nThai descends from proto-Tai-Kadai, which has been hypothesized to originate in the Lower Yangtze valleys. Ancient Chinese texts refer to non-Sinitic languages spoken cross this substantial region and their speakers as ''\"[[Baiyue#Language|Yue]]\"''. Although those languages are extinct, traces of their existence could be found in unearthed inscriptional materials, ancient Chinese historical texts and non-Han substrata in various Southern Chinese dialects. Thai, as the most-spoken language in the [[Tai-Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai language family]], has been used extensively in historical-comparative linguistics to identify the origins of language(s) spoken in the ancient region of South China. One of the very few direct records of non-Sinitic speech in pre-Qin and Han times having been preserved so far is the ''\"[[Song of the Yue Boatman]]\"'' (Yueren Ge \u8d8a\u4eba\u6b4c), which was transcribed phonetically in Chinese characters in 528 BC, and found in the \u5584\u8bf4 Shanshuo chapter of the Shuoyuan \u8bf4\u82d1 or 'Garden of Persuasions'.  In the early 80's the [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] linguist Wei Qingwen using reconstructed Old Chinese for the characters discovered that the resulting vocabulary showed strong resemblance to [[Zhuang language|modern Zhuang]].{{sfn|Edmondson|2007|p= 16}} Later, Zhengzhang Shangfang (1991) followed Wei's insight but used [[Thai script]] for comparison, since this orthography dates from the 13th century and preserves archaisms vis-\u00e0-vis the modern pronunciation.{{sfn|Zhengzhang|1991|pp= 159\u2013168}} The following is a simplified interpretation of the ''\"[[Song of the Yue Boatman]]\"'' by Zhengzhang Shangfang quoted by David Holm (2013) with Thai script and Chinese glosses being omitted.{{sfn|Holm|2013|pp= 784-785}} The upper row represents the original text, the next row the Old Chinese pronunciation, the third a transcription of written Thai, and the fourth line English glosses.

Thais from both inside and outside the Isan region often simply call this variant \"Lao\" when speaking informally.\n*[[Northern Thai language|Northern Thai]] (Phasa Nuea, Lanna, Kam Mueang, or [[Thai Yuan]]), spoken by about 6&nbsp;million (1983) in the formerly independent kingdom of [[Lanna]] ([[Chiang Mai]]).

(See {{section link|Monarchy of Thailand|Rachasap}}.)\n\nMost Thais can speak and understand all of these contexts. Street and Elegant Thai are the basis of all conversations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.studycountry.com/guide/TH-language.htm|title=The Languages spoken in Thailand|website=Studycountry|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-26}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Rhetorical, religious, and royal Thai are taught in schools as part of the national curriculum.\n\n==Script==\n{{main|Thai script|Thai braille}}\n\nThai is written in the [[Thai script]], an [[abugida]] written from left to right. Many scholars believe{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} that it is derived from the [[Khmer script]]. Certainly the numbers were lifted directly from Khmer. The language and its script are closely related to the [[Lao language]] and [[Lao script|script]]. Most literate Lao are able to read and understand Thai, as more than half of the Thai vocabulary, grammar, intonation, vowels and so forth are common with the Lao language.\n\nMuch like the Burmese adopted the [[Mon alphabet|Mon script]] (which also has Indic origins), the Thais adopted and modified the Khmer script to create their own writing system. While in Thai the pronunciation can largely be inferred from the script, the orthography is complex, with silent letters to preserve original spellings and many letters representing the same sound. While the oldest known inscription in the [[Khmer language]] dates from 611 CE, inscriptions in Thai writing began to appear around 1292 CE. Notable features include:\n\n#It is an [[abugida]] script, in which the [[implicit vowel]] is a short {{IPA|/a/}} in a syllable without final [[consonant]] and a short {{IPA|/o/}} in a syllable with final consonant.\n#Tone markers, if present, are placed above the final [[Syllable onset#Onset|onset]] consonant of the syllable.\n#[[Vowel]]s sounding after an initial consonant can be located before, after, above or below the consonant, or in a combination of these positions.\n\n===Transcription===\n{{Main|Romanization of Thai}}\nThere is no universally applied method for transcribing Thai into the Latin alphabet. For example, the name of the main airport is transcribed variously as Suvarnabhumi, Suwannaphum, or Suwunnapoom. Guide books, textbooks and dictionaries may each follow different systems. For this reason, most language courses recommend that learners master the Thai script.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOfficial standards are the [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription]] (RTGS), published by the [[Royal Institute of Thailand]],<ref>[http://www.royin.go.th/ Royal Thai General System of Transcription], published by the Thai Royal Institute only in Thai</ref> and the almost identical {{nobreak|[[ISO 11940-2]]}} defined by the [[International Organization for Standardization]]. The RTGS system is increasingly used in Thailand by central and local governments, especially for road signs.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ooh5.go.th/book/CA/CA01.pdf|at=Appendix \u0e07|language=Thai|title=Handbook and standard for traffic signs}}</ref> Its main drawbacks are that it does not indicate tone or vowel length. As the system is based on pronunciation, not orthography, reconstruction of Thai spelling from RTGS romanisation is not possible.\n\n===Transliteration===\n{{Main|Thai transliteration}}\nThe [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] published an international standard for the [[Thai transliteration|transliteration of Thai]] into Roman script in September 2003 ([[ISO 11940]]).<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=29544 ISO Standard].</ref> By adding diacritics to the Latin letters it makes the transcription reversible, making it a true [[transliteration]]. Notably, this system is used by [[Google Translate]], although it does not seem to appear in many other contexts, such as textbooks and other instructional media.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{IPA notice}}\n\n===Consonants===\n\n====Initials====\nStandard Thai distinguishes three [[voice-onset time]]s among plosive and affricate consonants:\n*[[voiced consonant|voiced]]\n*[[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] (unvoiced, unaspirated)\n*[[aspirated consonant|aspirated]]\n\nWhere English makes a distinction between voiced {{IPA|/b/}} and unvoiced aspirated {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}}, Thai distinguishes a third sound - the unvoiced, unaspirated {{IPA|/p/}} that occurs in English only as an allophone of {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}}, for example after an {{IPA|/s/}} as in the sound of the ''p'' in \"spin\". There is similarly an alveolar  {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}} triplet in Thai. In the velar series there is a {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}} pair and in the postalveolar series a {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255/}}, {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255\u02b0/}} pair, but the language lacks the corresponding voiced sounds {{IPA|/\u0261/}} and {{IPA|/d\u0291/}}. (In loanwords from English, English {{IPA|/\u0261/}} and {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292/}} are borrowed as the tenuis stops {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255/}}.)\n\nIn each cell below, the first line indicates [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), the second indicates the Thai characters in initial position (several letters appearing in the same box have identical pronunciation).

For finals, only eight sounds, as well as no sound, called ''m\u0101tr\u0101'' ({{wiktth|\u0e21\u0e32\u0e15\u0e23\u0e32}}) are used. To demonstrate, at the end of a syllable, \u0e1a ({{IPA|/b/}}) and \u0e14 ({{IPA|/d/}}) are devoiced, becoming pronounced as {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/t/}} respectively. Additionally, all plosive sounds are [[Unreleased stop|unreleased]]. Hence, final {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, and {{IPA|/k/}} sounds are pronounced as {{IPA|[p\u031a]}}, {{IPA|[t\u031a]}}, and {{IPA|[k\u031a]}} respectively.\n\nOf the consonant letters, excluding the disused \u0e03 and \u0e05, six (\u0e09 \u0e1c \u0e1d \u0e2b \u0e2d \u0e2e) cannot be used as a final and the other 36 are grouped as following.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n!\n!

Thai has [[Phonotactics|phonotactical constraints]] that define permissible syllable structure, [[consonant cluster]]s, and vowel sequences. Original Thai vocabulary introduces only 11 combined consonantal patterns:\n* {{IPA|/kr/}} (\u0e01\u0e23), {{IPA|/kl/}} (\u0e01\u0e25), {{IPA|/kw/}} (\u0e01\u0e27)\n* {{IPA|/k\u02b0r/}} (\u0e02\u0e23,\u0e04\u0e23), {{IPA|/k\u02b0l/}} (\u0e02\u0e25,\u0e04\u0e25), {{IPA|/k\u02b0w/}} (\u0e02\u0e27,\u0e04\u0e27)\n* {{IPA|/pr/}} (\u0e1b\u0e23), {{IPA|/pl/}} (\u0e1b\u0e25)\n* {{IPA|/p\u02b0r/}} (\u0e1e\u0e23), {{IPA|/p\u02b0l/}} (\u0e1c\u0e25,\u0e1e\u0e25)\n* {{IPA|/tr/}} (\u0e15\u0e23)\n\nThe number of clusters increases when a few more combinations are presented in loanwords such as {{IPA|/t\u02b0r/}} (\u0e17\u0e23) in {{wiktth|\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e32}} ({{IPA|/int\u02b0ra\u02d0/}}, from Sanskrit ''indr\u0101'') or {{IPA|/fr/}} (\u0e1f\u0e23) in {{wiktth|\u0e1f\u0e23\u0e35}} ({{IPA|/fri\u02d0/}}, from English ''free''); however, it can be observed that Thai language supports only those in initial position, with either {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, or {{IPA|/w/}} as the second consonant sound and not more than two sounds at a time.\n\n===Vowels===\nThe vowel nuclei of the Thai language are given in the following table. The top entry in every cell is the symbol from the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]], the second entry gives the spelling in the [[Thai alphabet]], where a dash (\u2013) indicates the position of the initial consonant after which the vowel is pronounced. A second dash indicates that a final consonant must follow.\n[[File:Thai vowel chart (monophthongs).svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Monophthongs of Thai.

Because syllables analyzed as ending in a short vowel may have a final [[glottal stop]] (especially in slower speech), all \"dead syllables\" are phonetically [[Checked tone|checked]], and have the reduced tonal inventory characteristic of checked syllables.\n\n====Unchecked syllables====\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Tone!!Thai!!Example!!Phonemic!!Phonetic!!Gloss\n|-\n|mid||\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e21\u0e31\u0e0d|| \u0e04\u0e32 ||{{IPA|/k\u02b0\u0101\u02d0/}}||{{IPA|[k\u02b0a\u02d0\u02e7]}}||''stick''\n|-\n|low||\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e01|| \u0e02\u0e48\u0e32 ||{{IPA|/k\u02b0\u00e0\u02d0/}}||{{IPA|[k\u02b0a\u02d0\u02e8\u02e9]}} or {{IPA|[k\u02b0a\u02d0\u02e9]}}||''galangal''\n|-\n|falling||\u0e42\u0e17|| \u0e04\u0e48\u0e32 ||{{IPA|/k\u02b0\u00e2\u02d0/}}||{{IPA|[k\u02b0a\u02d0\u02e5\u02e9]}}|| ''value''\n|-\n|high||\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35|| \u0e04\u0e49\u0e32 ||{{IPA|/k\u02b0\u00e1\u02d0/}}||{{IPA|[k\u02b0a\u02d0\u02e6\u02e5]}} or {{IPA|[k\u02b0a\u02d0\u02e5]}}||''to trade''\n|-\n|rising||\u0e08\u0e31\u0e15\u0e27\u0e32|| \u0e02\u0e32 ||{{IPA|/k\u02b0\u01ce\u02d0/}}||{{IPA|[k\u02b0a\u02d0\u02e9\u02e9\u02e6]}} or {{IPA|[k\u02b0a\u02d0\u02e9\u02e6]}}||''leg''\n|}\n\n====Checked syllables====\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Tone!!Thai!!Example!!Phonemic!!Phonetic!!Gloss\n|-\n|low (short vowel)||\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e01|| \u0e2b\u0e21\u0e31\u0e01 ||{{IPA|/m\u00e0k/}}||{{IPA|[mak\u031a\u02e8\u02e9]}}||''marinate''\n|-\n|low (long vowel)||\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e01|| \u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01 ||{{IPA|/m\u00e0\u02d0k/}}||{{IPA|[ma\u02d0k\u031a\u02e8\u02e9]}}|| ''areca nut, areca palm, betel, fruit''\n|-\n|high||\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35|| \u0e21\u0e31\u0e01 ||{{IPA|/m\u00e1k/}}||{{IPA|[mak\u031a\u02e6\u02e5]}}||''habitually, likely to''\n|-\n|falling||\u0e42\u0e17|| \u0e21\u0e32\u0e01 ||{{IPA|/m\u00e2\u02d0k/}}||{{IPA|[ma\u02d0k\u031a\u02e5\u02e9]}}||''a lot, abundance, many''\n|}\nIn some English [[loanword]]s, closed syllables with long vowel ending in an obstruent sound, have high tone, and closed syllables with short vowel ending in an obstruent sound have falling tone.\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Tone!!Thai!!Example!!Phonemic!!Phonetic!!Gloss\n|-\n|high||\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35|| \u0e21\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e01 ||{{IPA|/m\u00e1\u02d0k/}}||{{IPA|[ma\u02d0k\u031a\u02e6\u02e5]}}||''Marc, Mark''\n|-\n|high||\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35|| \u0e2a\u0e15\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e15 ||{{IPA|/sa.t\u00e1\u02d0t/}}||{{IPA|[sa.ta\u02d0t\u031a\u02e6\u02e5]}}||''start''\n|-\n|high||\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35|| \u0e1a\u0e32\u0e2a(\u0e40\u0e01\u0e15\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e25) ||{{IPA|/b\u00e1\u02d0t(.k\u00eat.b\u0254\u0304n)/}}<sup>1</sup>||{{IPA|[ba\u02d0t\u031a\u02e6\u02e5(.ket\u031a\u02e5\u02e9.b\u0254n\u02e7)]}}||''basketball''\n|-\n|falling||\u0e42\u0e17|| \u0e40\u0e21\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e31\u0e1b ||{{IPA|/m\u00e9\u02d0k.\u0294\u00e2p/}}||{{IPA|[me\u02d0k\u031a\u02e6\u02e5.\u0294ap\u031a\u02e5]}}||''make-up''\n|}\n<sup>1</sup> May be {{IPA|/b\u00e1\u02d0s.k\u00eat.b\u0254\u0304l/}} in educated speech.\n\n==Grammar==\nFrom the perspective of [[linguistic typology]], Thai can be considered to be an [[analytic language]].

The word \u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01 (''phuak'', {{IPA|[p\u02b0\u00fbak]}}) may be used as a prefix of a noun or pronoun as a collective to pluralize or emphasise the following word.

While in English, such classifiers are usually absent (\"four chairs\") or optional (\"two bottles of beer\" ''or'' \"two beers\"), a classifier is almost always used in Thai (hence \"chair four item\" and \"beer two bottle\").\n\n[[Possessive case|Possession]] in Thai is indicated by adding the word \"khong\" in front of the [[noun]] or [[pronoun]], but it may often be omitted. For example:\n* \u0e25\u0e39\u0e01\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e41\u0e21\u0e48 (luk khong mae) = \"child belonging to mother\" English = mother's child\n* \u0e19\u0e32\u0e2d\u0e32 (na a) = \"field uncle\" English = uncle's field <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thailanguage.org/thai/grammar.asp|title= Thailanguage.org|accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Pronouns===\nSubject [[pronoun]]s are often omitted, with [[nickname]]s used where English would use a pronoun. See [[Thai names#Formal and informal names|informal and formal names]] for more details. Pronouns, when used, are ranked in [[Thai honorifics|honorific registers]], and may also make a [[T\u2013V distinction#Thai|T\u2013V distinction]] in relation to [[kinship terminology|kinship]] and [[social status]]. Specialised pronouns are used for those with [[Thai royal and noble titles|royal and noble titles]], and for [[Bhikkhu|clergy]]. The following are appropriate for [[conversation]]al use:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Word || [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription|RTGS]] || [[help:IPA|IPA]] || Meaning\n|-\n| \u0e1c\u0e21 || phom || {{IPA|[p\u02b0\u01d2m]}} || I/me (masculine; formal)\n|-\n| \u0e14\u0e34\u0e09\u0e31\u0e19 || dichan || {{IPA|[d\u00ec\u0294t\u0361\u0255\u02b0\u00e1n]}}) || I/me (feminine; formal)\n|-\n| \u0e09\u0e31\u0e19 || chan || {{IPA|[t\u0361\u0255\u02b0\u01cen]}} || I/me (mainly used by women; informal) Commonly pronounced as {{IPA|[t\u0361\u0255\u02b0\u00e1n]}}\n|-\n| \u0e40\u0e23\u0e32 || rao || {{IPA|[raw]}} || we/us, I/me (casual), you (sometimes used but only when older person speaks to younger person)\n|-\n| \u0e04\u0e38\u0e13 || khun || {{IPA|[k\u02b0un]}} || you (polite)\n|-\n| \u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19 || than || {{IPA|[t\u02b0\u00e2n]}} || you (highly [[honorific]])\n|-\n| \u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d || thoe || {{IPA|[t\u02b0\u0264\u02d0]}} || you (informal), she/her (informal)\n|-\n| \u0e1e\u0e35\u0e48 || phi || {{IPA|[p\u02b0\u00ee\u02d0]}} || older brother, sister (also used for older acquaintances)\n|-\n| \u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07 || nong || {{IPA|[n\u0254\u02d0\u014b]}} || younger brother, sister (also used for younger acquaintances)\n|-\n| \u0e40\u0e02\u0e32 || khao || {{IPA|[k\u02b0\u01cew]}} || he/him, she/her\n|-\n| \u0e21\u0e31\u0e19 || man || {{IPA|[man]}} || it, he/she (sometimes casual or offensive if used to refer to a person)\n|}\n\nThe reflexive pronoun is \u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e07 (tua eng), which can mean any of: myself, yourself, ourselves, himself, herself, themselves. This can be mixed with another pronoun to create an [[intensive pronoun]], such as \u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e1c\u0e21\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e07 (tua phom eng, lit: I myself) or \u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e07 (tua khun eng, lit: you yourself). Thai also does not have a separate [[possessive pronoun]]. Instead, possession is indicated by the particle \u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07 (khong).  For example, \"my mother\" is \u0e41\u0e21\u0e48\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1c\u0e21 (mae khong phom, lit: mother of I). This particle is often implicit, so the phrase is shortened to \u0e41\u0e21\u0e48\u0e1c\u0e21 (mae phom). Plural pronouns can be easily constructed by adding the word \u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01 (phuak) in front of a singular pronoun as in \u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01\u0e40\u0e02\u0e32 (phuak khao) meaning they or \u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01\u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d (phuak thoe) meaning the plural sense of you. The only exception to this is \u0e40\u0e23\u0e32 (rao), which can be used as singular (informal) or plural, but can also be used in the form of \u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32 (phuak rao), which is only plural.\n\nThai has many more pronouns than those listed above. Their usage is full of nuances. For example:\n\n* \"\u0e1c\u0e21 \u0e40\u0e23\u0e32 \u0e09\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e14\u0e34\u0e09\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e39 \u0e01\u0e39 \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32 \u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1c\u0e21 \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32 \u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e21 \u0e2d\u0e32\u0e15\u0e21\u0e32 \u0e01\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22 \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e38\u0e17\u0e18\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32 \u0e2d\u0e31\u0e4a\u0e27 \u0e40\u0e02\u0e32\" all translate to \"I\", but each expresses a different gender, age, politeness, status, or relationship between speaker and listener.\n* \u0e40\u0e23\u0e32 (rao) can be first person (I), second person (you), or both (we), depending on the context.\n* Children or younger female could use or being referred by word \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e39 (nu) when talking with older person. The word \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e39 could be both feminine first person (I) and feminine second person (you) and also neuter first and neuter second person for children.\n** \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e39 commonly means rat or mouse. It could refers to small creature in general\n* The second person pronoun \u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d (thoe) (lit: you) is semi-feminine. It is used only when the speaker or the listener (or both) are female. Males usually don't address each other by this pronoun.\n* Both \u0e04\u0e38\u0e13 (khun) and \u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d (thoe) are polite neuter second person pronouns.  However, \u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d (khun thoe) is a feminine derogative third person.\n* Instead of a second person pronoun such as \"\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\" (you), it is much more common for unrelated strangers to call each other \"\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e48 \u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07 \u0e25\u0e38\u0e07 \u0e1b\u0e49\u0e32 \u0e19\u0e49\u0e32 \u0e2d\u0e32 \u0e15\u0e32 \u0e22\u0e32\u0e22\" (brother/sister/aunt/uncle/granny).\n* To express deference, the second person pronoun is sometimes replaced by a profession, similar to how, in English, presiding judges are always addressed as \"your honor\" rather than \"you\".  In Thai, students always address their teachers by \"\u0e04\u0e23\u0e39\" or \"\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e04\u0e23\u0e39\" or \"\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e08\u0e32\u0e23\u0e22\u0e4c\" (each means \"teacher\") rather than \u0e04\u0e38\u0e13 (you).  Teachers, monks, and doctors are almost always addressed this way.\n\n===Particles===\nThe [[Grammatical particle|particle]]s are often untranslatable words added to the end of a sentence to indicate respect, a request, encouragement or other moods (similar to the use of [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] in English), as well as varying the level of formality. They are not used in elegant (written) Thai. The most common particles indicating respect are \u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a (''khrap'', {{IPA|[k\u02b0r\u00e1p]}}, with a high tone) when the speaker is male, and \u0e04\u0e48\u0e30 (''kha'', {{IPA|[k\u02b0\u00e2]}}, with a falling tone) when the speaker is female. Used in a question or a request, the particle \u0e04\u0e48\u0e30 (falling tone) is changed to a \u0e04\u0e30 (high tone).\n\nOther common particles are:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Word || [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription|RTGS]] || [[help:IPA|IPA]] || Meaning\n|-\n| \u0e08\u0e4a\u0e30 || cha/ja || {{IPA|[t\u0361\u0255\u00e1\u0294]}} || indicating a request\n|-\n| \u0e08\u0e49\u0e30, \u0e08\u0e49\u0e32 or \u0e08\u0e4b\u0e32 || cha/ja || {{IPA|[t\u0361\u0255\u00e2\u02d0]}} || indicating emphasis\n|-\n| \u0e25\u0e30 or \u0e25\u0e48\u0e30 || la || {{IPA|[l\u00e1\u0294]}} || indicating emphasis\n|-\n| \u0e2a\u0e34 || si || {{IPA|[s\u00ec\u0294]}} || indicating emphasis or an imperative\n|-\n| \u0e19\u0e30 || na || {{IPA|[n\u00e1\u0294]}} || softening; indicating a request\n|}\n\n== Register ==\nAs noted above, Thai has several registers, each having certain usages, such as colloquial, formal, literary, and poetic. Thus, the word \"eat\" can be \u0e01\u0e34\u0e19 (''kin''; common), \u0e41\u0e14\u0e01 (''daek''; vulgar), \u0e22\u0e31\u0e14 (''yat''; vulgar), \u0e1a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e42\u0e20\u0e04 (''boriphok''; formal), \u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e32\u0e19 (''rapprathan''; formal), \u0e09\u0e31\u0e19 (''chan''; religious), or \u0e40\u0e2a\u0e27\u0e22 (''sawoei''; royal), as illustrated below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \"to eat\" !!

However, the vocabulary of Thai retains many words borrowed from [[Middle Chinese]].<ref>Martin Haspelmath, Uri Tadmor ''Loanwords in the World's Languages: A Comparative Handbook'' 2009 -- Page 611 \"Thai is of special interest to lexical borrowing for various reasons. The copious borrowing of basic vocabulary from Middle Chinese and later from Khmer indicates that, given the right sociolinguistic context, such vocabulary is not at all immune ...\"</ref><ref>Harald Haarmann Language in Ethnicity: A View of Basic Ecological Relations 1986- Page 165 \"In Thailand, for instance, where the Chinese influence was strong until the Middle Ages, Chinese characters were abandoned in written Thai in the course of the thirteenth century.\"</ref><ref>Paul A. Leppert Doing Business With Thailand -1992 Page 13 \"At an early time the Thais used Chinese characters. But, under the influence of Indian traders and monks, they soon dropped Chinese characters in favor of Sanskrit and Pali scripts.\"</ref>\n\nLater most vocabulary was borrowed from [[Sanskrit]] and [[P\u0101li]]; [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] terminology is particularly indebted to these. Indic words have a more formal register, and may be compared to Latin and French borrowings in English. Old [[Khmer language|Khmer]] has also contributed its share, especially in regard to royal court terminology. Since the beginning of the 20th century, however, the [[English language]] has had the greatest influence, especially for scientific, technical, international, and other modern terms. Many [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] Chinese words are also used, some replacing existing Thai words (for example, the names of basic numbers; see also [[Sino-Xenic]]).{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These languages are written with slightly different scripts but are linguistically similar and effectively form a [[dialect continuum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/messeas/node3.html |title=Ausbau and Abstand languages |publisher=Ccat.sas.upenn.edu |date=1995-01-20 |accessdate=2012-07-08}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{further information|Baiyue#Language|Chu (state)#Language|Tai languages|Tai peoples}}\nThe Thai language is classified as a Tai language, closely related to other [[Southwestern Tai languages]] including Lao, [[Shan language|Shan]] in [[Myanma]]r, and numerous indigenous languages spoken in an arc from [[Hainan]] and [[Yunnan]] south through Laos and Northern Vietnam to the Cambodian border. It is the principal language of education and government and spoken throughout the country. The standard is based on the dialect of the central Thai people, and it is written in the [[Thai alphabet]].\n\nThai has undergone various historical sound changes.  Some of the most significant changes occurred during the evolution from Old Thai to modern Thai. The Thai writing system has an eight-century history and many of these changes, especially in consonants and tones, are evidenced in the modern [[Thai alphabet|orthography]].\n\n===Old Thai===\nOld Thai had a three-way tone distinction on live syllables (those not ending in a stop), with no possible distinction on dead syllables (those ending in a stop, i.e. either {{IPA|/p/, /t/, /k/}} or the [[glottal stop]] which automatically closes syllables otherwise ending in a short vowel).\n\nThere was a two-way voiced vs. voiceless distinction among all [[fricative]] and [[sonorant]] consonants, and up to a four-way distinction among [[stop consonant|stop]]s and [[affricate]]s.  The maximal four-way occurred in [[labial consonant|labial]]s ({{IPA|/p p\u02b0 b \u0294b/}}) and [[dental consonant|dental]]s ({{IPA|/t t\u02b0 d \u0294d/}}); the three-way distinction among [[velar consonant|velar]]s ({{IPA|/k k\u02b0 \u0261/}}) and [[palatal consonant|palatal]]s ({{IPA|/t\u0255 t\u0255\u02b0 d\u0291/}}), with the glottalized member of each set apparently missing.\n\nThe major change between old and modern Thai was due to voicing distinction losses and the concomitant [[tone split]].  This may have happened between about 1300 and 1600 CE, possibly occurring at different times in different parts of the Thai-speaking area.  All voiced\u2013voiceless pairs of consonants lost the voicing distinction:\n*Plain voiced stops ({{IPA|/b d \u0261 d\u0291/}}) became voiceless aspirated stops ({{IPA|/p\u02b0 t\u02b0 k\u02b0 t\u0255\u02b0/}}).<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"Explanation 4\">The glottalized stops {{IPA|/\u0294b \u0294d/}} were unaffected, as they were treated in every respect like voiceless unaspirated stops due to the initial glottal stop. These stops are often described in the modern language as phonemically plain stops {{IPA|/b d/}}, but the glottalization is still commonly heard.</ref>\n*Voiced fricatives became voiceless.\n*Voiceless sonorants became voiced.\nHowever, in the process of these mergers the former distinction of voice was transferred into a new set of tonal distinctions.  In essence, every tone in Old Thai split into two new tones, with a lower-pitched tone corresponding to a syllable that formerly began with a voiced consonant, and a higher-pitched tone corresponding to a syllable that formerly began with a voiceless consonant (including glottalized stops).  An additional complication is that formerly voiceless unaspirated stops/affricates (original {{IPA|/p t k t\u0255 \u0294b \u0294d/}}) also caused original tone 1 to lower, but had no such effect on original tones 2 or 3.\n\nThe above consonant mergers and tone splits account for the complex relationship between spelling and sound in modern Thai.  Modern \"low\"-class consonants were voiced in Old Thai, and the terminology \"low\" reflects the lower tone variants that resulted.  Modern \"mid\"-class consonants were voiceless unaspirated stops or affricates in Old Thai\u2014precisely the class that triggered lowering in original tone 1 but not tones 2 or 3.  Modern \"high\"-class consonants were the remaining voiceless consonants in Old Thai (voiceless fricatives, voiceless sonorants, voiceless aspirated stops).  The three most common tone \"marks\" (the lack of any tone mark, as well as the two marks termed ''mai ek'' and ''mai tho'') represent the three tones of Old Thai, and the complex relationship between tone mark and actual tone is due to the various tonal changes since then.  Since the tone split, the tones have changed in actual representation to the point that the former relationship between lower and higher tonal variants has been completely obscured.  Furthermore, the six tones that resulted after the three tones of Old Thai were split have since merged into five in standard Thai, with the lower variant of former tone 2 merging with the higher variant of former tone 3, becoming the modern \"falling\" tone.<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"Explanation 5\">Modern [[Lao language|Lao]] and [[Northern Thai language|northern Thai dialects]] are often described as having six tones, but these are not necessarily due to preservation of the original six tones resulting from the tone split.  For example, in standard Lao, both the high and low variants of Old Thai tone 2 merged; however, the mid-class variant of tone 1 became pronounced differently from either the high-class or low-class variants, and all three eventually became phonemic due to further changes, e.g. {{IPA|/kr/}} > {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}}.  For similar reasons, Lao has developed more than two tonal distinctions in \"dead\" syllables.</ref>\n\n====Early Old Thai====\n{{further information|Proto-Tai}}\nEarly Old Thai also apparently had velar fricatives {{IPA|/x \u0263/}} as distinct phonemes.  These were represented by the now-obsolete letters \u0e03 ''kho khuat'' and \u0e05 ''kho khon'', respectively.  During the Old Thai period, these sounds merged into the corresponding stops {{IPA|/k\u02b0 \u0261/}}, and as a result the use of these letters became unstable.\n\nAt some point in the history of Thai, a palatal nasal phoneme {{IPA|/\u0272/}} also existed, inherited from [[Proto-Tai]].  A letter \u0e0d ''yo ying'' also exists, which is used to represent a palatal nasal in words borrowed from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]], and is currently pronounced {{IPA|/j/}} at the beginning of a syllable but {{IPA|/n/}} at the end of a syllable.  Most native Thai words that are reconstructed as beginning with {{IPA|/\u0272/}} are also pronounced {{IPA|/j/}} in modern Thai, but generally spelled with \u0e22 ''yo yak'', which consistently represents {{IPA|/j/}}.  This suggests that {{IPA|/\u0272/}} > {{IPA|/j/}} in native words occurred in the pre-literary period.  It is unclear whether Sanskrit and Pali words beginning with {{IPA|/\u0272/}} were borrowed directly with a {{IPA|/j/}}, or whether a {{IPA|/\u0272/}} was re-introduced, followed by a second change {{IPA|/\u0272/}} > {{IPA|/j/}}.\n\nProto-Tai also had a glottalized palatal sound, reconstructed as {{IPA|/\u0294j/}} in Li Fang-Kuei (1977{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}).  Corresponding Thai words are generally spelled \u0e2b\u0e22, which implies an Old Thai pronunciation of {{IPA|/hj/}} (or {{IPA|/j\u030a/}}), but a few such words are spelled \u0e2d\u0e22, which implies a pronunciation of {{IPA|/\u0294j/}} and suggests that the glottalization may have persisted through to the early literary period.\n\n===Vowel developments===\nThe vowel system of modern Thai contains nine pure vowels and three centering diphthongs, each of which can occur short or long. According to Li (1977{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}), however, many Thai dialects have only one such short\u2013long pair ({{IPA|/a a\u02d0/}}), and in general it is difficult or impossible to find minimal short\u2013long pairs in Thai that involve vowels other than {{IPA|/a/}} and where both members have frequent correspondences throughout the Tai languages.  More specifically, he notes the following facts about Thai:\n*In [[open syllable]]s, only long vowels occur. (This assumes that all apparent cases of short open syllables are better described as ending in a glottal stop.  This makes sense from the lack of tonal distinctions in such syllables, and the glottal stop is also reconstructible across the Tai languages.)\n*In [[closed syllable]]s, the long high vowels {{IPA|/i\u02d0 \u026f\u02d0 u\u02d0/}} are rare, and cases that do exist typically have diphthongs in other Tai languages.\n*In closed syllables, both short and long mid {{IPA|/e e\u02d0 o o\u02d0/}} and low {{IPA|/\u025b \u025b\u02d0 \u0254 \u0254\u02d0/}} do occur.  However, generally, only words with short {{IPA|/e o/}} and long {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0 \u0254\u02d0/}} are reconstructible back to Proto-Tai.\n*Both of the mid back unrounded vowels {{IPA|/\u0264 \u0264\u02d0/}} are rare, and words with such sounds generally cannot be reconstructed back to Proto-Tai.\nFurthermore, the vowel that corresponds to short Thai {{IPA|/a/}} has a different and often higher quality in many of the Tai languages compared with the vowel corresponding to Thai {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}.\n\nThis leads Li to posit the following:\n#Proto-Tai had a system of nine pure vowels with no length distinction, and possessing approximately the same qualities as in modern Thai: high {{IPA|/i \u026f u/}}, mid {{IPA|/e \u0264 o/}}, low {{IPA|/\u025b a \u0254/}}.\n#All Proto-Tai vowels were lengthened in open syllables, and low vowels were also lengthened in closed syllables.\n#Modern Thai largely preserved the original lengths and qualities, but lowered {{IPA|/\u0264/}} to {{IPA|/a/}}, which became short {{IPA|/a/}} in closed syllables and created a phonemic length distinction {{IPA|/a a\u02d0/}}.  Eventually, length in all other vowels became phonemic as well and a new {{IPA|/\u0264/}} (both short and long) was introduced, through a combination of borrowing and sound change.  Li believes that the development of long {{IPA|/i\u02d0 \u026f\u02d0 u\u02d0/}} from diphthongs, and the lowering of {{IPA|/\u0264/}} to {{IPA|/a/}} to create a length distinction {{IPA|/a a\u02d0/}}, had occurred by the time of Proto-Southwestern-Tai, but the other missing modern Thai vowels had not yet developed.\n\nNote that not all researchers agree with Li.  Pittayaporn (2009{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}), for example, reconstructs a similar system for Proto-Southwestern-Tai, but believes that there was also a mid back unrounded vowel {{IPA|/\u0259/}} (which he describes as {{IPA|/\u0264/}}), occurring only before final velar {{IPA|/k \u014b/}}.  He also seems to believe that the Proto-Southwestern-Tai vowel length distinctions can be reconstructed back to similar distinctions in Proto-Tai.\n\n===Connection to ancient Yue language(s)===\n{{further|Baiyue#Language|Chu_(state)#Linguistic_influences}}\nThai descends from proto-Tai-Kadai, which has been hypothesized to originate in the Lower Yangtze valleys. Ancient Chinese texts refer to non-Sinitic languages spoken cross this substantial region and their speakers as ''\"[[Baiyue#Language|Yue]]\"''. Although those languages are extinct, traces of their existence could be found in unearthed inscriptional materials, ancient Chinese historical texts and non-Han substrata in various Southern Chinese dialects. Thai, as the most-spoken language in the [[Tai-Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai language family]], has been used extensively in historical-comparative linguistics to identify the origins of language(s) spoken in the ancient region of South China. One of the very few direct records of non-Sinitic speech in pre-Qin and Han times having been preserved so far is the ''\"[[Song of the Yue Boatman]]\"'' (Yueren Ge \u8d8a\u4eba\u6b4c), which was transcribed phonetically in Chinese characters in 528 BC, and found in the \u5584\u8bf4 Shanshuo chapter of the Shuoyuan \u8bf4\u82d1 or 'Garden of Persuasions'.  In the early 80's the [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] linguist Wei Qingwen using reconstructed Old Chinese for the characters discovered that the resulting vocabulary showed strong resemblance to [[Zhuang language|modern Zhuang]].{{sfn|Edmondson|2007|p= 16}} Later, Zhengzhang Shangfang (1991) followed Wei's insight but used [[Thai script]] for comparison, since this orthography dates from the 13th century and preserves archaisms vis-\u00e0-vis the modern pronunciation.{{sfn|Zhengzhang|1991|pp= 159\u2013168}} The following is a simplified interpretation of the ''\"[[Song of the Yue Boatman]]\"'' by Zhengzhang Shangfang quoted by David Holm (2013) with Thai script and Chinese glosses being omitted.{{sfn|Holm|2013|pp= 784-785}} The upper row represents the original text, the next row the Old Chinese pronunciation, the third a transcription of written Thai, and the fourth line English glosses. Finally, there is Zhengzhang's English translation.\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|- align=center\n| style=\"width:6%;\"| &nbsp;\n| style=\"width:6%;\"|\n| style=\"width:6%;\"|\n| style=\"width:6%;\"|\n| style=\"width:6%;\"|\n| style=\"width:6%;\"|\n| style=\"width:6%;\"|\n| style=\"width:6%;\"|\n| style=\"width:6%;\"|\n| style=\"width:6%;\"|\n| style=\"width:6%;\"|\n| style=\"width:6%;\"|\n| style=\"width:6%;\"|\n| style=\"width:6%;\"|\n| style=\"width:6%;\"|\n| style=\"width:6%;\"|\n\n|-\n|\n| \u6feb\n| colspan=2 align=center|\u516e\n| \u6283\n| colspan=2 align=center|\u8349\n| \u6feb\n| colspan=9 |\n\n|-\n| \n| \u0266graams\n| colspan=2 align=center|\u0266ee\n| brons\n| colspan=2 align=center|tshuu\u0294\n| \u0266graams\n| colspan=9 |\n\n|-\n| \n| glamx\n| colspan=2 align=center|\u0266ee\n| bl\u0264\u0264n\n| colspan=2 align=center|c\u0264\u0264, c\u0264\u0294\n| glamx\n| colspan=9 |\n\n|-\n|\n| evening\n| colspan=2 align=center|ptl.\n| joyful\n| colspan=2 align=center|to meet\n| evening\n| colspan=9 |\n\n|-\n|\n| colspan=15 |<span style=\"word-spacing: 10px;\">Oh, the fine night, we meet in happiness tonight!</span>\n\n|-\n| colspan=16 height=30|\n\n|-\n| \n| \u4e88\n| colspan=2 align=center|\u660c\n| align=center|\u6791\n| align=center|\u6fa4\n| align=center|\u4e88\n| align=center|\u660c\n| align=center|\u5dde\n| colspan=7|\n\n|-\n|\n| la\n| colspan=2 align=center|thjang < khljang\n| align=center|gaah\n| align=center|draag\n| align=center|la\n| align=center|thjang\n| align=center|tju < klju\n| colspan=7|\n\n|-\n|\n| raa\n| colspan=2 align=center|djaangh\n| align=center|kra\u0294 -\n| align=center|\u0294daak\n| align=center|raa\n| align=center|djaangh\n| align=center|c\u025b\u025bu\n| colspan=7|\n\n|-\n|\n| we, I\n| colspan=2 align=center|be apt to\n| colspan=2 align=center|shy, ashamed\n| align=center|we, I\n| align=center|be good at\n| align=center|to row\n| colspan=7|\n\n|-\n|\n| colspan=15 |<span style=\"word-spacing: 15px;\">I am so shy, ah!

Moreover, most Thais in the northern and the northeastern (Isaan) parts of the country today are bilingual speakers of Central Thai and their respective regional dialects due to the fact that (Central) Thai is the language of television, education, news reporting, and all forms of media.<ref name=bangkok>{{cite web\n|url= http://thaiarc.tu.ac.th/thai/peansiri.htm\n|title= Linguistic Perspectives of Thai Culture\n|accessdate= 26 April 2011\n|author= Peansiri Vongvipanond\n|date= Summer 1994\n|work= paper presented to a workshop of teachers of social science\n|publisher= University of New Orleans\n|page= 2\n|quote= The dialect one hears on radio and television is the Bangkok dialect, considered the standard dialect.\n}}</ref> A recent research found that the speakers of the [[Northern Thai language]] (or Kham Mueang) have become so few, as most people in northern Thailand now invariably speak standard Thai, such that they are now using mostly central Thai words and seasoning their speech only with \"kham mueang\" accent.<ref>{{cite article|first1=Pim|last1=Kemasingki|first2= Pariyakorn|last2= Prateepkoh|title= Kham Mueang: the slow death of a language|journal= Chiang Mai City Life|date= August 1, 2017|page=8|quote=there are still many people speaking kham mueang, but as an accent, not as a language.

It is spoken by about 20&nbsp;million people. Thais from both inside and outside the Isan region often simply call this variant \"Lao\" when speaking informally.\n*[[Northern Thai language|Northern Thai]] (Phasa Nuea, Lanna, Kam Mueang, or [[Thai Yuan]]), spoken by about 6&nbsp;million (1983) in the formerly independent kingdom of [[Lanna]] ([[Chiang Mai]]). Shares strong similarities with Lao to the point that in the past the Siamese Thais referred to it as Lao.\n*[[Southern Thai language|Southern Thai]] (Thai Tai, Pak Tai, or Dambro), spoken by about 4.5&nbsp;million (2006)\n*[[Phu Thai language|Phu Thai]], spoken by about half a million around [[Nakhon Phanom Province]], and 300,000 more in Laos and Vietnam (2006).\n*[[Phuan language|Phuan]], spoken by 200,000 in central Thailand and Isan, and 100,000 more in northern Laos (2006).\n*[[Shan language|Shan]] (Thai Luang, Tai Long, Thai Yai), spoken by about 100,000 in north-west Thailand along the border with the Shan States of Burma, and by 3.2&nbsp;million in Burma (2006).\n*[[Tai L\u00fc language|L\u00fc]] (Lue, Yong, [[Dai people|Dai]]), spoken by about 1,000,000 in northern Thailand, and 600,000 more in [[Xishuangbanna|Sipsong Panna]] of China, Burma, and Laos (1981\u20132000).\n*[[Nyaw language]], spoken by 50,000 in [[Nakhon Phanom Province]], [[Sakhon Nakhon Province]], [[Udon Thani Province]] of Northeast Thailand (1990).\n*[[Song language|Song]], spoken by about 30,000 in central and northern Thailand (2000).\n\n===Registers===\nCentral Thai is composed of several distinct [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]], forms for different social contexts:\n*Street or Common Thai ({{wiktth|\u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e39\u0e14}}, ''phasa phut'', spoken Thai): informal, without polite terms of address, as used between close relatives and friends.\n*Elegant or Formal Thai ({{wiktth|\u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e40\u0e02\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19}}, ''phasa khian'', written Thai): official and written version, includes respectful terms of address; used in simplified form in newspapers.\n*Rhetorical Thai: used for public speaking.\n*Religious Thai: (heavily influenced by [[Sanskrit]] and [[P\u0101li]]) used when discussing Buddhism or addressing monks.\n*Royal Thai (\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e28\u0e31\u0e1e\u0e17\u0e4c, ''racha sap''): influenced by [[Khmer language|Khmer]], this is used when addressing members of the [[Royal Family of Thailand|royal family]] or describing their activities. (See {{section link|Monarchy of Thailand|Rachasap}}.)\n\nMost Thais can speak and understand all of these contexts. Street and Elegant Thai are the basis of all conversations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.studycountry.com/guide/TH-language.htm|title=The Languages spoken in Thailand|website=Studycountry|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-26}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Rhetorical, religious, and royal Thai are taught in schools as part of the national curriculum.\n\n==Script==\n{{main|Thai script|Thai braille}}\n\nThai is written in the [[Thai script]], an [[abugida]] written from left to right. Many scholars believe{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} that it is derived from the [[Khmer script]]. Certainly the numbers were lifted directly from Khmer. The language and its script are closely related to the [[Lao language]] and [[Lao script|script]]. Most literate Lao are able to read and understand Thai, as more than half of the Thai vocabulary, grammar, intonation, vowels and so forth are common with the Lao language.\n\nMuch like the Burmese adopted the [[Mon alphabet|Mon script]] (which also has Indic origins), the Thais adopted and modified the Khmer script to create their own writing system. While in Thai the pronunciation can largely be inferred from the script, the orthography is complex, with silent letters to preserve original spellings and many letters representing the same sound. While the oldest known inscription in the [[Khmer language]] dates from 611 CE, inscriptions in Thai writing began to appear around 1292 CE. Notable features include:\n\n#It is an [[abugida]] script, in which the [[implicit vowel]] is a short {{IPA|/a/}} in a syllable without final [[consonant]] and a short {{IPA|/o/}} in a syllable with final consonant.\n#Tone markers, if present, are placed above the final [[Syllable onset#Onset|onset]] consonant of the syllable.\n#[[Vowel]]s sounding after an initial consonant can be located before, after, above or below the consonant, or in a combination of these positions.\n\n===Transcription===\n{{Main|Romanization of Thai}}\nThere is no universally applied method for transcribing Thai into the Latin alphabet. For example, the name of the main airport is transcribed variously as Suvarnabhumi, Suwannaphum, or Suwunnapoom. Guide books, textbooks and dictionaries may each follow different systems. For this reason, most language courses recommend that learners master the Thai script.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOfficial standards are the [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription]] (RTGS), published by the [[Royal Institute of Thailand]],<ref>[http://www.royin.go.th/ Royal Thai General System of Transcription], published by the Thai Royal Institute only in Thai</ref> and the almost identical {{nobreak|[[ISO 11940-2]]}} defined by the [[International Organization for Standardization]]. The RTGS system is increasingly used in Thailand by central and local governments, especially for road signs.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ooh5.go.th/book/CA/CA01.pdf|at=Appendix \u0e07|language=Thai|title=Handbook and standard for traffic signs}}</ref> Its main drawbacks are that it does not indicate tone or vowel length. As the system is based on pronunciation, not orthography, reconstruction of Thai spelling from RTGS romanisation is not possible.\n\n===Transliteration===\n{{Main|Thai transliteration}}\nThe [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] published an international standard for the [[Thai transliteration|transliteration of Thai]] into Roman script in September 2003 ([[ISO 11940]]).<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=29544 ISO Standard].</ref> By adding diacritics to the Latin letters it makes the transcription reversible, making it a true [[transliteration]]. Notably, this system is used by [[Google Translate]], although it does not seem to appear in many other contexts, such as textbooks and other instructional media.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{IPA notice}}\n\n===Consonants===\n\n====Initials====\nStandard Thai distinguishes three [[voice-onset time]]s among plosive and affricate consonants:\n*[[voiced consonant|voiced]]\n*[[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] (unvoiced, unaspirated)\n*[[aspirated consonant|aspirated]]\n\nWhere English makes a distinction between voiced {{IPA|/b/}} and unvoiced aspirated {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}}, Thai distinguishes a third sound - the unvoiced, unaspirated {{IPA|/p/}} that occurs in English only as an allophone of {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}}, for example after an {{IPA|/s/}} as in the sound of the ''p'' in \"spin\". There is similarly an alveolar  {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}} triplet in Thai. In the velar series there is a {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}} pair and in the postalveolar series a {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255/}}, {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255\u02b0/}} pair, but the language lacks the corresponding voiced sounds {{IPA|/\u0261/}} and {{IPA|/d\u0291/}}. (In loanwords from English, English {{IPA|/\u0261/}} and {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292/}} are borrowed as the tenuis stops {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255/}}.)\n\nIn each cell below, the first line indicates [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), the second indicates the Thai characters in initial position (several letters appearing in the same box have identical pronunciation). The letter \u0e2b, one of the two ''h'' letters, is also used to help write certain tones (described below).\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n! colspan=2| \n!

To demonstrate, at the end of a syllable, \u0e1a ({{IPA|/b/}}) and \u0e14 ({{IPA|/d/}}) are devoiced, becoming pronounced as {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/t/}} respectively. Additionally, all plosive sounds are [[Unreleased stop|unreleased]]. Hence, final {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, and {{IPA|/k/}} sounds are pronounced as {{IPA|[p\u031a]}}, {{IPA|[t\u031a]}}, and {{IPA|[k\u031a]}} respectively.\n\nOf the consonant letters, excluding the disused \u0e03 and \u0e05, six (\u0e09 \u0e1c \u0e1d \u0e2b \u0e2d \u0e2e) cannot be used as a final and the other 36 are grouped as following.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n!\n!

Thai has [[Phonotactics|phonotactical constraints]] that define permissible syllable structure, [[consonant cluster]]s, and vowel sequences. Original Thai vocabulary introduces only 11 combined consonantal patterns:\n* {{IPA|/kr/}} (\u0e01\u0e23), {{IPA|/kl/}} (\u0e01\u0e25), {{IPA|/kw/}} (\u0e01\u0e27)\n* {{IPA|/k\u02b0r/}} (\u0e02\u0e23,\u0e04\u0e23), {{IPA|/k\u02b0l/}} (\u0e02\u0e25,\u0e04\u0e25), {{IPA|/k\u02b0w/}} (\u0e02\u0e27,\u0e04\u0e27)\n* {{IPA|/pr/}} (\u0e1b\u0e23), {{IPA|/pl/}} (\u0e1b\u0e25)\n* {{IPA|/p\u02b0r/}} (\u0e1e\u0e23), {{IPA|/p\u02b0l/}} (\u0e1c\u0e25,\u0e1e\u0e25)\n* {{IPA|/tr/}} (\u0e15\u0e23)\n\nThe number of clusters increases when a few more combinations are presented in loanwords such as {{IPA|/t\u02b0r/}} (\u0e17\u0e23) in {{wiktth|\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e32}} ({{IPA|/int\u02b0ra\u02d0/}}, from Sanskrit ''indr\u0101'') or {{IPA|/fr/}} (\u0e1f\u0e23) in {{wiktth|\u0e1f\u0e23\u0e35}} ({{IPA|/fri\u02d0/}}, from English ''free''); however, it can be observed that Thai language supports only those in initial position, with either {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, or {{IPA|/w/}} as the second consonant sound and not more than two sounds at a time.\n\n===Vowels===\nThe vowel nuclei of the Thai language are given in the following table. The top entry in every cell is the symbol from the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]], the second entry gives the spelling in the [[Thai alphabet]], where a dash (\u2013) indicates the position of the initial consonant after which the vowel is pronounced. A second dash indicates that a final consonant must follow.\n[[File:Thai vowel chart (monophthongs).svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Monophthongs of Thai.

Some specific nouns are [[reduplication|reduplicated]] to form [[collective number|collective]]s: \u0e40\u0e14\u0e47\u0e01 (''dek'', child) is often repeated as \u0e40\u0e14\u0e47\u0e01 \u0e46 (''dek dek'') to refer to a group of children. The word \u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01 (''phuak'', {{IPA|[p\u02b0\u00fbak]}}) may be used as a prefix of a noun or pronoun as a collective to pluralize or emphasise the following word. (\u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01\u0e1c\u0e21, ''phuak phom'', {{IPA|[p\u02b0\u00fbak p\u02b0\u01d2m]}}, ''we'', masculine; \u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32 ''phuak rao'', {{IPA|[p\u02b0\u00fbak raw]}}, emphasised ''we''; \u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32 ''phuak ma'', ''(the) dogs'').

While in English, such classifiers are usually absent (\"four chairs\") or optional (\"two bottles of beer\" ''or'' \"two beers\"), a classifier is almost always used in Thai (hence \"chair four item\" and \"beer two bottle\").\n\n[[Possessive case|Possession]] in Thai is indicated by adding the word \"khong\" in front of the [[noun]] or [[pronoun]], but it may often be omitted.

This can be mixed with another pronoun to create an [[intensive pronoun]], such as \u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e1c\u0e21\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e07 (tua phom eng, lit: I myself) or \u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e07 (tua khun eng, lit: you yourself). Thai also does not have a separate [[possessive pronoun]]. Instead, possession is indicated by the particle \u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07 (khong).  For example, \"my mother\" is \u0e41\u0e21\u0e48\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1c\u0e21 (mae khong phom, lit: mother of I). This particle is often implicit, so the phrase is shortened to \u0e41\u0e21\u0e48\u0e1c\u0e21 (mae phom). Plural pronouns can be easily constructed by adding the word \u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01 (phuak) in front of a singular pronoun as in \u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01\u0e40\u0e02\u0e32 (phuak khao) meaning they or \u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01\u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d (phuak thoe) meaning the plural sense of you. The only exception to this is \u0e40\u0e23\u0e32 (rao), which can be used as singular (informal) or plural, but can also be used in the form of \u0e1e\u0e27\u0e01\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32 (phuak rao), which is only plural.\n\nThai has many more pronouns than those listed above. Their usage is full of nuances. For example:\n\n* \"\u0e1c\u0e21 \u0e40\u0e23\u0e32 \u0e09\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e14\u0e34\u0e09\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e39 \u0e01\u0e39 \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32 \u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1c\u0e21 \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32 \u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e21 \u0e2d\u0e32\u0e15\u0e21\u0e32 \u0e01\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22 \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e38\u0e17\u0e18\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32 \u0e2d\u0e31\u0e4a\u0e27 \u0e40\u0e02\u0e32\" all translate to \"I\", but each expresses a different gender, age, politeness, status, or relationship between speaker and listener.\n* \u0e40\u0e23\u0e32 (rao) can be first person (I), second person (you), or both (we), depending on the context.\n* Children or younger female could use or being referred by word \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e39 (nu) when talking with older person. The word \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e39 could be both feminine first person (I) and feminine second person (you) and also neuter first and neuter second person for children.\n** \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e39 commonly means rat or mouse. It could refers to small creature in general\n* The second person pronoun \u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d (thoe) (lit: you) is semi-feminine. It is used only when the speaker or the listener (or both) are female. Males usually don't address each other by this pronoun.\n* Both \u0e04\u0e38\u0e13 (khun) and \u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d (thoe) are polite neuter second person pronouns.  However, \u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d (khun thoe) is a feminine derogative third person.\n* Instead of a second person pronoun such as \"\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\" (you), it is much more common for unrelated strangers to call each other \"\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e48 \u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07 \u0e25\u0e38\u0e07 \u0e1b\u0e49\u0e32 \u0e19\u0e49\u0e32 \u0e2d\u0e32 \u0e15\u0e32 \u0e22\u0e32\u0e22\" (brother/sister/aunt/uncle/granny).\n* To express deference, the second person pronoun is sometimes replaced by a profession, similar to how, in English, presiding judges are always addressed as \"your honor\" rather than \"you\".  In Thai, students always address their teachers by \"\u0e04\u0e23\u0e39\" or \"\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e04\u0e23\u0e39\" or \"\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e08\u0e32\u0e23\u0e22\u0e4c\" (each means \"teacher\") rather than \u0e04\u0e38\u0e13 (you).  Teachers, monks, and doctors are almost always addressed this way.\n\n===Particles===\nThe [[Grammatical particle|particle]]s are often untranslatable words added to the end of a sentence to indicate respect, a request, encouragement or other moods (similar to the use of [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] in English), as well as varying the level of formality. They are not used in elegant (written) Thai. The most common particles indicating respect are \u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a (''khrap'', {{IPA|[k\u02b0r\u00e1p]}}, with a high tone) when the speaker is male, and \u0e04\u0e48\u0e30 (''kha'', {{IPA|[k\u02b0\u00e2]}}, with a falling tone) when the speaker is female. Used in a question or a request, the particle \u0e04\u0e48\u0e30 (falling tone) is changed to a \u0e04\u0e30 (high tone).\n\nOther common particles are:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Word || [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription|RTGS]] || [[help:IPA|IPA]] || Meaning\n|-\n| \u0e08\u0e4a\u0e30 || cha/ja || {{IPA|[t\u0361\u0255\u00e1\u0294]}} || indicating a request\n|-\n| \u0e08\u0e49\u0e30, \u0e08\u0e49\u0e32 or \u0e08\u0e4b\u0e32 || cha/ja || {{IPA|[t\u0361\u0255\u00e2\u02d0]}} || indicating emphasis\n|-\n| \u0e25\u0e30 or \u0e25\u0e48\u0e30 || la || {{IPA|[l\u00e1\u0294]}} || indicating emphasis\n|-\n| \u0e2a\u0e34 || si || {{IPA|[s\u00ec\u0294]}} || indicating emphasis or an imperative\n|-\n| \u0e19\u0e30 || na || {{IPA|[n\u00e1\u0294]}} || softening; indicating a request\n|}\n\n== Register ==\nAs noted above, Thai has several registers, each having certain usages, such as colloquial, formal, literary, and poetic. Thus, the word \"eat\" can be \u0e01\u0e34\u0e19 (''kin''; common), \u0e41\u0e14\u0e01 (''daek''; vulgar), \u0e22\u0e31\u0e14 (''yat''; vulgar), \u0e1a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e42\u0e20\u0e04 (''boriphok''; formal), \u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e32\u0e19 (''rapprathan''; formal), \u0e09\u0e31\u0e19 (''chan''; religious), or \u0e40\u0e2a\u0e27\u0e22 (''sawoei''; royal), as illustrated below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \"to eat\" !!

However, the vocabulary of Thai retains many words borrowed from [[Middle Chinese]].<ref>Martin Haspelmath, Uri Tadmor ''Loanwords in the World's Languages: A Comparative Handbook'' 2009 -- Page 611 \"Thai is of special interest to lexical borrowing for various reasons. The copious borrowing of basic vocabulary from Middle Chinese and later from Khmer indicates that, given the right sociolinguistic context, such vocabulary is not at all immune ...\"</ref><ref>Harald Haarmann Language in Ethnicity: A View of Basic Ecological Relations 1986- Page 165 \"In Thailand, for instance, where the Chinese influence was strong until the Middle Ages, Chinese characters were abandoned in written Thai in the course of the thirteenth century.\"</ref><ref>Paul A. Leppert Doing Business With Thailand -1992 Page 13 \"At an early time the Thais used Chinese characters. But, under the influence of Indian traders and monks, they soon dropped Chinese characters in favor of Sanskrit and Pali scripts.\"</ref>\n\nLater most vocabulary was borrowed from [[Sanskrit]] and [[P\u0101li]]; [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] terminology is particularly indebted to these. Indic words have a more formal register, and may be compared to Latin and French borrowings in English. Old [[Khmer language|Khmer]] has also contributed its share, especially in regard to royal court terminology. Since the beginning of the 20th century, however, the [[English language]] has had the greatest influence, especially for scientific, technical, international, and other modern terms. Many [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] Chinese words are also used, some replacing existing Thai words (for example, the names of basic numbers; see also [[Sino-Xenic]]).{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In addition, as a capital city, Bangkok cuisine is sometimes influenced by more dedicated royal cuisine. Tastes and looks of food in Bangkok have changed somewhat over time as they have been influenced by other cuisines such as Asian, European or Western countries.\n* [[Central Thailand|Central Thai]]: cuisine of the flat and wet central [[rice production in Thailand|rice-growing]] plains, site of the former Thai kingdoms of [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] and [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], and the [[Dvaravati]] culture of the [[Mon people]] from before the arrival of [[Thai people|Siamese]] in the area. [[Coconut milk]] is one of major ingredients used in Central Thai cuisine. \n* [[Isan]] or northeastern Thai: cuisine of the more arid [[Khorat Plateau]], similar in [[Culture of Laos|culture to Laos]] and also influenced by [[Khmer cuisine]]. The best-known ingredient is probably ''[[pla ra]]'' (fermented fish).\n* [[Northern Thailand|Northern Thai]]: cuisine of the cooler valleys and forested mountains of the [[Thai highlands]], once ruled by the former [[Lanna Kingdom]] and home of [[Northern Thai people|Lannaese]], the majority of [[northern Thailand]]. This cuisine shares a lot of ingredients with Isan.\n* [[Southern Thailand|Southern Thai]]: cuisine of the [[Kra Isthmus]] which is bordered on two sides by tropical seas, with its many islands and including the [[Malay people|ethnic Malay]], former [[Pattani Kingdom|Sultanate of Pattani]] in the deep south. Some food base on [[Hainan people|Hainanese]] and [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] influence.\n\n[[File:Red roast duck curry.jpg|thumb|left|''Kaeng phet pet yang'', a legacy of the palace cuisine of Ayutthaya]]\n\nThai cuisine and the culinary traditions and cuisines of Thailand's neighbors have mutually influenced one another over the course of many centuries. Regional variations tend to correlate to neighboring states (often sharing the same cultural background and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] on both sides of the border) as well as climate and geography. Northern Thai cuisine shares dishes with [[Shan State]] in Burma, northern [[Laos]], and also [[Yunnan cuisine|with Yunnan]] Province in China, whereas the cuisine of [[Isan]] (northeastern Thailand) is similar to [[Lao cuisine|that of southern Laos]], and is also influenced by [[Khmer cuisine]] from Cambodia to its south, and by [[Vietnamese cuisine]] to its east. Southern Thailand, with many dishes that contain liberal amounts of [[coconut milk]] and fresh [[turmeric]], has that in common with [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], [[Malaysian cuisine|Malaysian]], and [[Indonesian cuisine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.zomzaa.com |title=Home|website=Thai Cuisine!|accessdate=29 Oct 2013}}{{failed verification|date=May 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"shesimmers1\">{{cite web|author=|url=http://shesimmers.com/2011/02/southern-thai-rice-salad-khao-yam-%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%B3-and-a-chat-with-jitlada-restaurant-in-los-angeles.html |title=Southern Thai Rice Salad \u2013 Khao Yam (\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e22\u0e33) and a Chat with Jitlada Restaurant in Los Angeles |publisher=Shesimmers.com |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thaiso.com/thailand-a-z/thai-food.htm |title=Thai Food |publisher=thaiso.com |date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927135622/http://www.thaiso.com/thailand-a-z/thai-food.htm |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In addition to these regional cuisines, there is also Thai royal cuisine which can trace its history back to the [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]] palace cuisine of the [[Ayutthaya kingdom]] (1351\u20131767 CE).

Traditionally, the majority of ethnic [[Thai people]] ate with their hands like the people of India. Chopsticks are mainly used in Thailand for eating Chinese-style noodle soups, or at [[Chinese restaurant|Chinese]], [[Japanese restaurant|Japanese]], or [[Korean restaurant]]s. Stir fried noodle dishes such as ''[[pad Thai]]'', and curry-noodle dishes such as ''khanom chin [[nam ngiao]]'', are also eaten with a fork and spoon in the Thai fashion.\n\nThai meals typically consist of rice (''khao'' in Thai) with many complementary dishes shared by all. The dishes are all served at the same time, including the soups, and it is also customary to provide more dishes than there are guests at a table. A Thai family meal would normally consist of rice with several dishes which should form a harmonious contrast of flavors and textures as well as preparation methods. Traditionally, a meal would have at least five elements: a dip or relish for raw or cooked vegetables (''khrueang chim'') is the most crucial component of any Thai meal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodvirgin.com/columns/Thai.htm |title=First Time Eating New Food and International Cuisine at Restaurants |publisher=The Food Virgin |date= |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sawadee.com/thailand/food/ |title=Thai Food \u2013 Characteristics of Thai Food by |publisher=Sawadee.com |date= |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref> ''Khrueang chim'', considered a building block of Thai food by Chef McDang, may come in the form of a spicy [[Hot sauce|chili sauce or relish]] called ''[[nam phrik]]'' (made of raw or cooked chilies and other ingredients, which are then mashed together), or a type of dip enriched with coconut milk called ''lon''. The other elements would include a clear soup (perhaps a spicy ''tom yam'' or a mellow ''tom chuet''), a curry or stew (essentially any dish identified with the ''kaeng'' prefix), a deep-fried dish and a stir fried dish of meat, fish, seafood, or vegetables.\n\n[[File:Kaeng pla thu and tom mara.jpg|thumb|A plate of raw vegetables and herbs, together with ''[[nam phrik]] kapi'', is often served as a complimentary dish at [[southern Thailand|southern Thai]] eateries.]]\n\nIn most Thai restaurants, diners will have access to a selection of Thai sauces (''[[nam chim]]'') and condiments, either brought to the table by wait staff or present at the table in small containers. These may include: ''phrik nam pla/nam pla phrik'' (fish sauce, lime juice, chopped chilies and garlic), dried chili flakes, [[sweet chili sauce]], sliced chili peppers in rice vinegar, [[Sriracha sauce]], and even sugar. With certain dishes, such as ''khao kha mu'' (pork trotter stewed in soy sauce and served with rice), whole [[Bird's eye chili|Thai pepper]]s and raw [[garlic]] are served in addition to the sour chili sauce. Cucumber is sometimes eaten to cool the mouth with particularly spicy dishes. They often feature as a [[Garnish (food)|garnish]], especially with one-dish meals. The plain rice, sticky rice or the ''khanom chin'' (Thai rice noodles) served alongside a spicy [[Thai curry]] or stir fry, tends to counteract the spiciness.\n\nWhen time is limited or when eating alone, single dishes, such as fried rice or noodle soups, are quick and filling. An alternative is to have one or smaller helpings of curry, stir fries and other dishes served together on one plate with a portion of rice. This style of serving food is called ''khao rat kaeng'' (lit., \"rice covered with curry\"), or for short ''khao kaeng'' (lit., \"rice curry\"). Eateries and shops that specialize in pre-made food are the usual place to go to for having a meal this way. These venues have a large display showing the different dishes one can choose. When placing their order at these places, Thais will state if they want their food served as separate dishes, or together on one plate with rice (''rat khao''). Very often, regular restaurants will also feature a selection of freshly made \"rice curry\" dishes on their menu for single customers.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Ingredients==\n{{Main|List of Thai ingredients}}\n[[File:Green curry ingredients.jpg|thumb|Ingredients, green curry paste]]\n[[File:Thanin market platu.jpg|thumb|''[[Pla thu]]'' at a market]]\nThailand has about the same land area as Spain and a length of approximately 1,650 kilometers or 1,025 miles (Italy, in comparison, is about 1,250 kilometers or 775 miles long), with the [[Thai highlands|foothills of the Himalayas]] in the north, a high plateau in the northeast, a verdant river basin in the center, and tropical [[rainforest]]s and islands in the south. With over 40 distinct [[Ethnic groups in Thailand|ethnic groups]] each with its own culture and even more languages,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=TH|title=Thailand|work=Ethnologue}}</ref> it comes as no surprise that Thai cuisine, as a whole, features many different ingredients (''suan phasom''; {{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e48\u0e27\u0e19\u0e1c\u0e2a\u0e21}}), and ways of preparing food.\n\nThai food is known for its enthusiastic use of fresh (rather than dried) [[herb]]s and [[spice]]s. Common flavors in Thai food come from garlic, [[Alpinia galanga|galangal]], [[coriander]]/cilantro, [[Cymbopogon|lemon grass]], [[shallot]]s, [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[kaffir lime]] leaves, [[shrimp paste]], [[fish sauce]], and [[Chili pepper|chilies]]. [[Palm sugar]], made from the sap of certain ''[[Borassus]]'' palms, is used to sweeten dishes while [[lime (fruit)|lime]] and [[tamarind]] contribute sour notes.

According to Thai food expert McDang, rice is the first and most important part of any meal, and the words for rice and food are the same: ''khao''. As in many other rice eating cultures, to say \"eat rice\" (in Thai ''\"kin khao\"''; pronounced as \"keen cow\") means to eat food.\nRice is such an integral part of the diet that a common Thai greeting is \"''kin khao reu yang?\"'' which literally translates as \"Have you eaten rice yet?\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Elsinburg|first1=Andrea|title=Have You Eaten Rice Yet?|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2012/aug/24/travel-thailand-have-you-eaten-rice-yet/#|website=San Diego Reader|accessdate=2015-09-22}}</ref>\n{{check quotation}}\nThai farmers historically have cultivated tens of thousands of rice varieties. The traditional recipe for a rice dish could include as many as 30 varieties of rice.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kisner|first1=Connie|title=Climate Change in Thailand: Impacts and Adaptation Strategies|url=http://www.climate.org/topics/international-action/thailand.htm|website=Climate Institute|accessdate=2015-01-06|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109032338/http://www.climate.org/topics/international-action/thailand.htm|archivedate=9 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> That number has been drastically reduced due to genetic modifications.\n\nNon-glutinous rice (''[[Oryza sativa]]'') is called ''khao chao'' (lit., \"royal rice\"). One type, which is indigenous to Thailand, is the highly prized, sweet-smelling [[jasmine rice]] (''{{as written|khao hom mali}}''). This naturally aromatic long-grained rice grows in abundance in the [[Rice production in Thailand|patchwork of paddy fields]] that blanket Thailand's central plains. Once the [[steamed rice|rice is steamed]] or cooked, it is called ''khao suai'' (lit., \"beautiful rice\"). Non-glutinous rice is used for making fried rice dishes, and for [[congee]], of which there are three main varieties: ''khao tom'' (a thin rice soup, most often with minced pork or fish), ''khao tom kui'' (a thick, unflavored rice porridge that is served with side dishes), or ''chok'' (a thick rice porridge that is flavored with broth and minced meat).\n[[File:Som tam khao niao kai yang.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Glutinous rice|Khao niao]]'' (sticky rice), served with ''[[som tam]]'' (papaya salad) and ''[[kai yang]]'' (grilled chicken) as part of a typical [[Isan]] meal]]\nOther varieties of rice eaten in Thailand include: [[sticky rice]] (''khao niao''), a unique variety of rice which contains an unusual balance of the starches present in all rice, causing it to cook up to a sticky texture. Sticky rice, not jasmine rice, is a [[staple food]] in the local cuisines of [[northern Thailand]] and of [[Isan]] ([[northeastern Thailand]]), both regions of Thailand directly adjacent to [[Laos]] with which they share many cultural traits. Thai [[Red Cargo rice]], an unpolished long grain rice with an outer deep reddish-brown color and a white center, has a nutty taste and slightly chewy compared to the soft and gummy texture of jasmine rice. Only the husks of the red rice grains are removed which allows it to retain all its nutrients and vitamins, but unlike brown rice, its red color comes from antioxidants in the bran. Black sticky rice is a type of sticky rice with a deep purple-red color that may appear black. Another unpolished grain, black sticky rice has a rich nutty flavor that is most often used in desserts.\n\nNoodles are usually made from either rice flour, wheat flour or mung bean flour. ''[[Khanom chin]]'' is fresh rice vermicelli made from fermented rice, and eaten with spicy curries such as green chicken curry (''khanom chin kaeng khiao wan kai'') or with salads such as ''som tam''. Other rice noodles, adapted from Chinese cuisine to suit Thai taste, are called ''kuaitiao'' in Thailand and come in three varieties: ''sen yai'' are wide flat noodles, ''sen lek'' are thin flat rice noodles, and ''sen mi'' (also known as [[rice vermicelli]] in the West) are round and thin. ''Bami'' is made from egg and [[wheat]] flour and usually sold fresh. They are similar to the Teochew ''[[mee pok]]''. ''Wun sen'', called [[cellophane noodles]] in English, are extremely thin noodles made from [[mung bean]] flour which are sold dried. Thai noodle dishes, whether stir fried like ''[[phat Thai]]'' or in the form of a noodle soup, usually come as an individual serving and are not meant to be shared and eaten communally.\n\nRice flour (''paeng khao chao'') and [[tapioca]] flour (''paeng man sampalang'') are often used in desserts or as thickening agents.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Pastes and sauces===\n[[File:Phrik nam pla.jpg|thumb|right|''Nam pla phrik'', a table sauce most often eaten with rice dishes, is made from fish sauce and sliced chilies, and often also includes garlic and lime.]]\n\nAn ingredient found in many Thai dishes and used in every region of the country is ''nam pla'', a clear [[fish sauce]] that is very aromatic. Fish sauce is a staple ingredient in Thai cuisine and imparts a unique character to Thai food. Fish sauce is prepared with fermented fish that is made into a fragrant condiment and provides a salty flavor. There are many varieties of fish sauce and many variations in the way it is prepared. Some fish may be fermented with shrimp or spices. Another type of sauce made from fermented fish is ''[[pla ra]]''. It is more pungent than ''nam pla'', and, in contrast to ''nam pla'', which is a clear liquid, ''pla ra'' is opaque and often contains pieces of fish. To add this sauce to a ''som tam'' (spicy papaya salad) is a matter of choice. ''Kapi'', Thai [[shrimp paste]], is a combination of fermented ground shrimp and salt. It is used in the famous chili paste called ''nam phrik kapi'', in rice dishes such as ''khao khluk kapi'' and it is indispensable for making [[Thai curry]] pastes. ''[[Tai pla]]'' is a pungent sauce used in the [[Southern Thailand|southern Thai]] cuisine, that is made from the fermented innards of the [[Short mackerel#Thailand|short mackerel]] (''pla thu'').<ref>Akkasit Jongjareonrak, et al.

Each region has its own special versions. The words ''\"nam phrik\"'' are used by Thais to describe many pastes containing chilies used for dipping, although the more watery versions tend to be called ''[[nam chim]]''. [[Thai curry]] pastes are normally called ''phrik kaeng'' or ''khrueang kaeng'' (lit. curry ingredients), but some people also use the word ''nam phrik'' to designate a curry paste. Red curry paste, for instance, could be called ''phrik kaeng phet'' or ''khrueang kaeng phet'' in Thai, but also ''nam phrik kaeng phet''. Both ''nam phrik'' and ''phrik kaeng'' are prepared by crushing together chilies with various ingredients such as garlic and shrimp paste using a [[mortar and pestle]]. Some ''nam phrik'' are served as a dip with vegetables such as cucumbers, cabbage and yard-long beans, either raw or blanched. One such paste is ''nam phrik num'', a paste of pounded fresh green chilies, shallots, garlic and coriander leaves. The sweet roasted chili paste called ''nam phrik phao'' is often used as an ingredient in ''tom yam'' or when frying meat or seafood, and it is also popular as a spicy \"jam\" on bread, or served as a dip with [[prawn crackers]]. The dry ''nam phrik kung'', made with pounded [[dried shrimp]] (''kung haeng''), is often eaten plain with rice and a few slices of cucumber. French diplomat [[Simon de la Loub\u00e8re]] observed that chili pastes were vital for the way Thai people eat. He provides us with a recipe for ''nam phrik'' with ''[[pla ra]]'' and onions in ''Du Royaume de Siam'', an account of his mission to Thailand published in 1691.<ref>De la Loub\u00e8re, ''The Kingdom of Siam'', p.35</ref>\n\nThe soy sauces which are used in Thai cuisine are of Chinese origin, and the Thai names for them are (wholly or partially) [[loanword]]s from the [[Teochew dialect]]: ''si-io dam'' (black soy sauce), ''si-io khao'' (light soy sauce), ''si-io wan'' (sweet soy sauce), and ''[[Yellow bean paste|taochiao]]'' (fermented whole soy beans). ''Namman hoi'' ([[oyster sauce]]) is also of Chinese origin. It is used extensively in vegetable and meat stir fries.\n\nSatay<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satay#Thailand> is also common in Thailand, grilled or skewered meat served with a spicy peanut dipping sauce made from roasted or fried peanuts.\n\n\n===Vegetables, herbs and spices===\n[[File:Thai market vegetables 01.jpg|right|thumb|A vegetable stall, [[Chiang Mai]]]]\n[[File:Vegetable platter with nam phrik kapi.jpg|right|thumb|At southern Thai restaurants most often a vegetable and herbs platter with [[nam phrik kapi]] is served as a complementary dish]]\nThai dishes use a wide variety of herbs, spices and leaves rarely found in the West. The characteristic flavor of [[kaffir lime]] leaves (''bai makrut'') appears in many Thai soups (e.g., the hot and sour ''[[tom yam]]'') or curry from the southern and central areas of Thailand. The Thai [[Lime (Citrus aurantifolia)|lime]] (''manao'') is smaller, darker and sweeter than the kaffir lime, which has a rough looking skin with a stronger lime flavor. Kaffir lime leaves or rind is frequently combined with [[galangal]] (''kha'') and [[Cymbopogon|lemongrass]] (''takhrai''), either kept whole in simmered dishes or blended together with liberal amounts of chilies and other aromatics to make curry paste. Fresh [[Thai basil]], distinctively redolent of [[clove]]s, and with stems which are often tinged with a purple color, are used to add fragrance in certain dishes such as [[green curry]]. Other commonly used herbs in Thai cuisine include ''phak chi'', ([[coriander]] or cilantro leaves), ''rak phak chi'' (cilantro/coriander roots), [[Mentha spicata|spearmint]] (''saranae''), [[holy basil]] (''kraphao''), ginger (''khing''), [[turmeric]] (''khamin''), [[fingerroot]] (''krachai''), [[Eryngium foetidum|culantro]] (''phak chi farang''),  [[Pandanus amaryllifolius|pandanus]] leaves (''bai toei''), and [[Thai lemon basil]] (''maenglak''). Spices and spice mixtures used in Thai cuisine include ''phong phalo'' ([[five-spice powder]]), ''phong kari'' ([[curry powder]]), and fresh and dried [[Black pepper|peppercorn]]s (''phrik thai''). Northern Thai ''[[larb]]'' uses a very elaborate spice mix, called ''phrik lap'', which includes ingredients such as [[cumin]], [[cloves]], [[long pepper]], [[star anise]], [[Zanthoxylum|prickly ash seeds]] and [[cinnamon]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Phrik lap | url=http://library.cmu.ac.th/ntic/en_lannafood/detail_lannafood.php?id_food=182|website=Lanna Food |publisher=Northern Thai Information Center, Chiang Mai University Library|accessdate=2014-11-03}}</ref>\n[[File:Fish stuffed with Thai herbs.jpg|thumb|[[Channa striata|Snakehead fish]] packed with lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves ready for steaming]]\nBesides kaffir lime leaves, several other tree leaves are used in Thai cuisine such as ''[[cha-om]]'', the young feathery leaves of the ''[[Acacia pennata]]'' tree. These leaves can be cooked in omelettes, soups and curries or eaten raw in northern Thai salads.  [[Banana leaf|Banana leaves]] are often used as packaging for ready-made food or as steamer cups such as in ''[[ho mok]] pla'', a spicy steamed [[p\u00e2t\u00e9]] or [[souffl\u00e9]] made with fish and coconut milk. [[Banana]] flowers are also used in [[Thai salads]] or as a vegetable ingredient for certain curries. The leaves and flowers of the [[neem tree]] (''sadao'') are also eaten blanched. ''Phak lueat'' (leaves from the ''[[Ficus virens]]'') are cooked in curries, and ''bai makok'' (from the ''[[Spondias mombin]]'') can be eaten raw with a chili paste.\n\nFive main chilies are generally used as ingredients in Thai food. One chili is very small (about {{Convert|1.25|cm|in}}) and is known as the hottest chili: ''phrik khi nu suan'' (\"garden mouse-dropping chili\"). The slightly larger chili ''[[Bird's eye chili|phrik khi nu]]'' (\"mouse-dropping chili\") is the next hottest. The green or red ''phrik chi fa'' (\"sky pointing chili\") is slightly less spicy than the smaller chilies. The very large '' phrik yuak'', which is pale green in color, is the least spicy and used more as a vegetable. Lastly, the dried chilies: ''phrik haeng'' are spicier than the two largest chilies and dried to a dark red color.\n[[File:Phrik lap Chiang Rai.jpg|thumb|The elaborate spice mix needed for northern Thai ''[[larb]]'']]\nOther typical ingredients are the several types of [[eggplant]] (''makhuea'') used in Thai cuisine, such as the pea-sized ''[[Solanum torvum|makhuea phuang]]'' and the egg-sized [[Thai eggplant|''makhuea suai'']], often also eaten raw. Although [[broccoli]] is often used in Asian restaurants in the west in ''phat phak ruam'' (stir fried mixed vegetables) and ''rat na'' (rice noodles served in gravy), it was never used in any traditional Thai food in Thailand and was rarely seen in Thailand. Usually in Thailand, [[Kai-lan|khana]] is used, for which broccoli is a substitute. Other vegetables which are often eaten in Thailand are ''thua fak yao'' ([[yardlong bean]]s), ''thua ngok'' ([[bean sprout]]s), ''no mai'' ([[bamboo shoot]]s), tomatoes, [[cucumber]]s, ''phak tam lueng'' (''[[Coccinia grandis]]''), ''phak kha na'' ([[Kai-lan|Chinese kale]]), ''phak kwangtung'' ([[Choy sum#Chinensis|choy sum]]), [[sweet potato]]es (both the tuber and leaves), a few types of [[Squash (plant)|squash]], ''phak krathin'' (''[[Leucaena leucocephala]]''), ''sato'' (''[[Parkia speciosa]]''), ''tua ph\u016b'' ([[winged bean]]s) and ''khaophot'' ([[maize|corn]]).\n\nAmong the green, leafy vegetables and herbs that are usually eaten raw in a meal or as a side dish in Thailand, the most important are: ''phak bung'' ([[Ipomoea aquatica|morning glory]]), ''horapha'' ([[Thai basil]]), ''bai bua bok'' ([[Centella asiatica|Asian pennywort]]), ''phak kachet'' ([[Neptunia oleracea|water mimosa]]), ''phak kat khao'' ([[Napa cabbage|Chinese cabbage]]), ''phak phai'' ([[Persicaria odorata|praew leaves]]), ''phak kayang'' ([[Limnophila aromatica|rice paddy herb]]), ''phak chi farang'' ([[Eryngium foetidum|culantro]]), ''phak tiu'' (''[[Cratoxylum formosum]]''), ''phak \"phaai\"'' ([[Limnocharis flava|yellow burr head]]) and ''kalampl\u012b'' ([[cabbage]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/ac145e/AC145E02.htm |title=The Vegetable Sector in Thailand |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref> Some of these leaves are highly perishable and must be used within a couple of days.\n\nSeveral types of [[Edible mushroom|mushroom]] (''het'') also feature in Thai cuisine such as [[Volvariella volvacea|straw mushroom]]s (''het fang''), [[Lentinula edodes|shiitake]] (''het hom''), and [[Tremella fuciformis|white jelly fungus]] (''het hu nu khao'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://samui.sawadee.com/dining/food/vegetable.htm |title=Thai vegetables |publisher=Samui.sawadee.com |accessdate=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828062610/http://samui.sawadee.com/dining/food/vegetable.htm |archivedate=28 August 2013 }}</ref>\n\nFlowers are also commonly used ingredients in many Thai dishes, either as a vegetable, such as ''dok khae'' (''[[Sesbania grandiflora]]'') and ''huapli'' (the flower bud of the [[banana]]), or as a food coloring, such as with the blue-colored ''dok anchan'' (the flowers of the ''[[Clitoria ternatea]]'', which can also be eaten raw or fried).\n{{clear}}\n\n===Fruits===\n[[File:Durians Markt Thailand.JPG|thumb|left|Durians at a Thai market]]\n\nFresh fruit forms a large part of the Thai diet, and are customarily served after a meal as dessert.

First, ice cream in the palace was made of coconut juice with roasted tamarind on top. Second, ice cream for the public was coconut ice cream with the scent of the Nommaeo flower with a slight sweet taste. The ice cream \"tube\" was born during the reign of [[Rama VII]]. Its ingredients were contained inside a zinc tube which was shaken until it solidified, then skewered stick to serve as a handle. It was sold by mobile vendors using dry ice and salt to keep the ice cream cold.

The foods that are made to order, tend to be dishes that can be quickly prepared: quick stir fries with rice, such as ''phat kaphrao'' (spicy basil-fried minced pork, chicken, or seafood)<ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Richard|title=The world's best street food|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/feb/24/worlds-best-street-food-lonely-planet|accessdate=4 May 2018|work=The Guardian|date=2012-02-24}}</ref> or ''phat khana'' (stir fried [[gailan]]), and quick curries such as ''pladuk phat phet'' (catfish fried with red curry paste).\n[[File:Street food Yasothon.jpg|left|thumb|Street food during the [[Yasothon]] [[Rocket Festival]]]]\nNoodles are a popular street food item as they are mainly eaten as a single dish. Chinese-style noodle soups, fried noodles, and fermented Thai rice noodles (''[[khanom chin]]''), served with a choice of different Thai curries, are popular. Nearly everywhere in Thailand you will see ''som tam'' ([[green papaya salad]]) and sticky rice sold at stalls and roadside shops. This is popularly eaten together with grilled chicken; but if the shop doesn't sell any themselves, someone else nearby will. In most cities and towns there will be stalls selling sweet ''roti'', a thin, flat fried dough envelop, with fillings such as banana, egg, and chocolate. The ''roti'' is similar to the Malay ''[[roti canai]]'' and Singaporean ''[[roti prata]]'', and the stalls are often operated by [[Islam in Thailand|Thai Muslims]]. Sweets snacks, collectively called ''khanom'', such as ''tako'' (coconut cream jelly), ''khanom man'' (coconut [[cassava]] cake), and ''khanom wun'' (flavored jellies), can be seen displayed on large trays in glass covered push-carts. Other sweets, such as ''[[khanom bueang]]'' and ''khanom khrok'' (somewhat similar to Dutch ''[[poffertjes]]''), are made to order.\n\nIn the evenings, mobile street stalls, often only a scooter with a side car, drive by and temporarily set up shop outside bars in Thailand, selling ''kap klaem'' (\"drinking food\"). Popular ''kap klaem'' dishes sold by mobile vendors are grilled items such as sun-dried squid, meats on skewers, or grilled sour sausages, and deep-fried snacks such as fried insects or fried sausages. Peeled and sliced fruits are also sold from street carts, laid out on a bed of crushed ice to preserve their freshness. ''Salapao'', steamed buns filled with meat or sweet beans and the Thai version of the Chinese steamed ''[[baozi]]'', are also commonly sold by mobile vendors.\n[[File:Tuk-tuk fastfood grill 1.jpg|thumb|A motorcycle with a side car selling grilled fast food snacks]]\nFood markets in Thailand, large open air halls with permanent stalls, tend to operate as a collection of street stalls, each vendor with their own set of tables and providing (limited) service, although some resemble the regular food courts at shopping malls and large supermarkets, with service counters and the communal use of tables. Food courts and food markets offer many of the same foods as street stalls, both pre-cooked as well as made to order. Night food markets, in the form of a collection of street stalls and mobile vendors, spring up in parking lots, along busy streets, and at temple fairs and local festivals in the evenings, when the temperatures are more agreeable and people have finished work.\n\nThe dishes sold at [[wet markets]] in Thailand tend to be offered pre-cooked. Many people go there, and also to street vendors, to buy food for at work, or to take back home. It is a common sight to see Thais carrying whole communal meals consisting of several dishes, cooked rice, sweets, and fruit, all neatly packaged in plastic bags and [[foam food container]]s, to be shared with colleagues at work or at home with friends and family. Due to the fact that many dishes are similar to those that people would cook at home, it is a good place to find regional, and seasonal, foods.\n\n==Vegetarianism in Thailand==\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Thai \"che\" sign.jpg\n| width1 = 170\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Ah-han-jay.png\n| width2 = 105\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Traditional Thai vegetarian restaurants will carry yellow signs with ''che'' ({{lang-th|[[:wikt:\u0e40\u0e08|\u0e40\u0e08]]}}) (left) or ''ahan che'' ({{lang-th|[[:wikt:\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23|\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23]][[:wikt:\u0e40\u0e08|\u0e40\u0e08]]}}) (right) written in red in [[Thai alphabet|Thai script]].\n}}\nAlthough the [[Nine Emperor Gods Festival|Vegetarian Festival]] is celebrated each year by a portion of Thailand's population, and many restaurants in Thailand will offer vegetarian food during this festival period, pure vegetarian food is usually difficult to find in normal restaurants and eateries in Thailand.

Thai royal cuisine has become very well known from the [[Rattanakosin Era]] onwards.\n\nTypically, Thai royal cuisine has basic characteristics that are close to the basic food prepared by general people. However, Thai royal cuisine focuses on the freshness of seasonal products. Other than that, it is crucial that the way in which Thai royal food is cooked, should be complex and delicate.\n\nLa Loub\u00e8re, an envoy from France during the reign of King Narai the Great, recorded that the food at the court was generally similar to villager food. Ways that make Thai Royal cuisine different food was the beautiful presentation. For example, they served fish and chicken with the bones removed, and the vegetables were served in bite-sized portions. In addition, if beef is used, it should be tenderloin only.\n\nThere are many types of Thai royal cuisine such as ''ranchuan'' curry, ''nam phrik long rue'', ''matsaman'' curry,<!--Curry Rum, (what is this?)--> rice in jasmine-flavored iced water or ''[[khao chae]]'', spicy salad, fruit, and carved vegetable.\n\nThai Chef McDang, himself descended from the royal family, asserts that the difference between royal Thai cuisine and regular Thai cuisine is fiction.

In addition, as a capital city, Bangkok cuisine is sometimes influenced by more dedicated royal cuisine. Tastes and looks of food in Bangkok have changed somewhat over time as they have been influenced by other cuisines such as Asian, European or Western countries.\n* [[Central Thailand|Central Thai]]: cuisine of the flat and wet central [[rice production in Thailand|rice-growing]] plains, site of the former Thai kingdoms of [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] and [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], and the [[Dvaravati]] culture of the [[Mon people]] from before the arrival of [[Thai people|Siamese]] in the area. [[Coconut milk]] is one of major ingredients used in Central Thai cuisine. \n* [[Isan]] or northeastern Thai: cuisine of the more arid [[Khorat Plateau]], similar in [[Culture of Laos|culture to Laos]] and also influenced by [[Khmer cuisine]]. The best-known ingredient is probably ''[[pla ra]]'' (fermented fish).\n* [[Northern Thailand|Northern Thai]]: cuisine of the cooler valleys and forested mountains of the [[Thai highlands]], once ruled by the former [[Lanna Kingdom]] and home of [[Northern Thai people|Lannaese]], the majority of [[northern Thailand]]. This cuisine shares a lot of ingredients with Isan.\n* [[Southern Thailand|Southern Thai]]: cuisine of the [[Kra Isthmus]] which is bordered on two sides by tropical seas, with its many islands and including the [[Malay people|ethnic Malay]], former [[Pattani Kingdom|Sultanate of Pattani]] in the deep south. Some food base on [[Hainan people|Hainanese]] and [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] influence.\n\n[[File:Red roast duck curry.jpg|thumb|left|''Kaeng phet pet yang'', a legacy of the palace cuisine of Ayutthaya]]\n\nThai cuisine and the culinary traditions and cuisines of Thailand's neighbors have mutually influenced one another over the course of many centuries. Regional variations tend to correlate to neighboring states (often sharing the same cultural background and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] on both sides of the border) as well as climate and geography. Northern Thai cuisine shares dishes with [[Shan State]] in Burma, northern [[Laos]], and also [[Yunnan cuisine|with Yunnan]] Province in China, whereas the cuisine of [[Isan]] (northeastern Thailand) is similar to [[Lao cuisine|that of southern Laos]], and is also influenced by [[Khmer cuisine]] from Cambodia to its south, and by [[Vietnamese cuisine]] to its east. Southern Thailand, with many dishes that contain liberal amounts of [[coconut milk]] and fresh [[turmeric]], has that in common with [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], [[Malaysian cuisine|Malaysian]], and [[Indonesian cuisine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.zomzaa.com |title=Home|website=Thai Cuisine!|accessdate=29 Oct 2013}}{{failed verification|date=May 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"shesimmers1\">{{cite web|author=|url=http://shesimmers.com/2011/02/southern-thai-rice-salad-khao-yam-%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%B3-and-a-chat-with-jitlada-restaurant-in-los-angeles.html |title=Southern Thai Rice Salad \u2013 Khao Yam (\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e22\u0e33) and a Chat with Jitlada Restaurant in Los Angeles |publisher=Shesimmers.com |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thaiso.com/thailand-a-z/thai-food.htm |title=Thai Food |publisher=thaiso.com |date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927135622/http://www.thaiso.com/thailand-a-z/thai-food.htm |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In addition to these regional cuisines, there is also Thai royal cuisine which can trace its history back to the [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]] palace cuisine of the [[Ayutthaya kingdom]] (1351\u20131767 CE).

The food is pushed by the fork, held in the left hand, into the spoon held in the right hand, which is then brought to the mouth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shesimmers.com/2012/11/how-to-eat-thai-chilirelishes.html|title=How to Eat Thai Chili Relishes \u0e01\u0e34\u0e19\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e34\u0e01(\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e08\u0e4a\u0e30\u0e16\u0e36\u0e07\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e2a\u0e30\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e2a\u0e27\u0e22)|publisher=}}</ref> A traditional ceramic spoon is sometimes used for soup, and knives are not generally used at the table.<ref name=\"McDang-2010\"/> It is common practice for both the Thais and the [[Ethnic groups in Thailand|hill tribe peoples]] who live in [[Lanna]] and [[Isan]] to use sticky rice as an edible implement by shaping it into small, and sometimes flattened, balls by hand (and only the right hand by custom) which are then dipped into side dishes and eaten.\n[[File:Ban Huahat07.jpg|thumb|Thai meal in a village temple]]\n[[Chopstick]]s were foreign utensils to most [[ethnic groups in Thailand]] with the exception of the [[Thai Chinese]], and a few other cultures such as the [[Akha people]], who are recent arrivals from [[Yunnan]] Province, [[China]]. Traditionally, the majority of ethnic [[Thai people]] ate with their hands like the people of India. Chopsticks are mainly used in Thailand for eating Chinese-style noodle soups, or at [[Chinese restaurant|Chinese]], [[Japanese restaurant|Japanese]], or [[Korean restaurant]]s. Stir fried noodle dishes such as ''[[pad Thai]]'', and curry-noodle dishes such as ''khanom chin [[nam ngiao]]'', are also eaten with a fork and spoon in the Thai fashion.\n\nThai meals typically consist of rice (''khao'' in Thai) with many complementary dishes shared by all. The dishes are all served at the same time, including the soups, and it is also customary to provide more dishes than there are guests at a table. A Thai family meal would normally consist of rice with several dishes which should form a harmonious contrast of flavors and textures as well as preparation methods. Traditionally, a meal would have at least five elements: a dip or relish for raw or cooked vegetables (''khrueang chim'') is the most crucial component of any Thai meal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodvirgin.com/columns/Thai.htm |title=First Time Eating New Food and International Cuisine at Restaurants |publisher=The Food Virgin |date= |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sawadee.com/thailand/food/ |title=Thai Food \u2013 Characteristics of Thai Food by |publisher=Sawadee.com |date= |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref> ''Khrueang chim'', considered a building block of Thai food by Chef McDang, may come in the form of a spicy [[Hot sauce|chili sauce or relish]] called ''[[nam phrik]]'' (made of raw or cooked chilies and other ingredients, which are then mashed together), or a type of dip enriched with coconut milk called ''lon''. The other elements would include a clear soup (perhaps a spicy ''tom yam'' or a mellow ''tom chuet''), a curry or stew (essentially any dish identified with the ''kaeng'' prefix), a deep-fried dish and a stir fried dish of meat, fish, seafood, or vegetables.\n\n[[File:Kaeng pla thu and tom mara.jpg|thumb|A plate of raw vegetables and herbs, together with ''[[nam phrik]] kapi'', is often served as a complimentary dish at [[southern Thailand|southern Thai]] eateries.]]\n\nIn most Thai restaurants, diners will have access to a selection of Thai sauces (''[[nam chim]]'') and condiments, either brought to the table by wait staff or present at the table in small containers. These may include: ''phrik nam pla/nam pla phrik'' (fish sauce, lime juice, chopped chilies and garlic), dried chili flakes, [[sweet chili sauce]], sliced chili peppers in rice vinegar, [[Sriracha sauce]], and even sugar. With certain dishes, such as ''khao kha mu'' (pork trotter stewed in soy sauce and served with rice), whole [[Bird's eye chili|Thai pepper]]s and raw [[garlic]] are served in addition to the sour chili sauce. Cucumber is sometimes eaten to cool the mouth with particularly spicy dishes. They often feature as a [[Garnish (food)|garnish]], especially with one-dish meals. The plain rice, sticky rice or the ''khanom chin'' (Thai rice noodles) served alongside a spicy [[Thai curry]] or stir fry, tends to counteract the spiciness.\n\nWhen time is limited or when eating alone, single dishes, such as fried rice or noodle soups, are quick and filling. An alternative is to have one or smaller helpings of curry, stir fries and other dishes served together on one plate with a portion of rice. This style of serving food is called ''khao rat kaeng'' (lit., \"rice covered with curry\"), or for short ''khao kaeng'' (lit., \"rice curry\"). Eateries and shops that specialize in pre-made food are the usual place to go to for having a meal this way. These venues have a large display showing the different dishes one can choose. When placing their order at these places, Thais will state if they want their food served as separate dishes, or together on one plate with rice (''rat khao''). Very often, regular restaurants will also feature a selection of freshly made \"rice curry\" dishes on their menu for single customers.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Ingredients==\n{{Main|List of Thai ingredients}}\n[[File:Green curry ingredients.jpg|thumb|Ingredients, green curry paste]]\n[[File:Thanin market platu.jpg|thumb|''[[Pla thu]]'' at a market]]\nThailand has about the same land area as Spain and a length of approximately 1,650 kilometers or 1,025 miles (Italy, in comparison, is about 1,250 kilometers or 775 miles long), with the [[Thai highlands|foothills of the Himalayas]] in the north, a high plateau in the northeast, a verdant river basin in the center, and tropical [[rainforest]]s and islands in the south.

Common flavors in Thai food come from garlic, [[Alpinia galanga|galangal]], [[coriander]]/cilantro, [[Cymbopogon|lemon grass]], [[shallot]]s, [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[kaffir lime]] leaves, [[shrimp paste]], [[fish sauce]], and [[Chili pepper|chilies]]. [[Palm sugar]], made from the sap of certain ''[[Borassus]]'' palms, is used to sweeten dishes while [[lime (fruit)|lime]] and [[tamarind]] contribute sour notes.

According to Thai food expert McDang, rice is the first and most important part of any meal, and the words for rice and food are the same: ''khao''. As in many other rice eating cultures, to say \"eat rice\" (in Thai ''\"kin khao\"''; pronounced as \"keen cow\") means to eat food.\nRice is such an integral part of the diet that a common Thai greeting is \"''kin khao reu yang?\"'' which literally translates as \"Have you eaten rice yet?\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Elsinburg|first1=Andrea|title=Have You Eaten Rice Yet?|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2012/aug/24/travel-thailand-have-you-eaten-rice-yet/#|website=San Diego Reader|accessdate=2015-09-22}}</ref>\n{{check quotation}}\nThai farmers historically have cultivated tens of thousands of rice varieties. The traditional recipe for a rice dish could include as many as 30 varieties of rice.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kisner|first1=Connie|title=Climate Change in Thailand: Impacts and Adaptation Strategies|url=http://www.climate.org/topics/international-action/thailand.htm|website=Climate Institute|accessdate=2015-01-06|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109032338/http://www.climate.org/topics/international-action/thailand.htm|archivedate=9 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> That number has been drastically reduced due to genetic modifications.\n\nNon-glutinous rice (''[[Oryza sativa]]'') is called ''khao chao'' (lit., \"royal rice\"). One type, which is indigenous to Thailand, is the highly prized, sweet-smelling [[jasmine rice]] (''{{as written|khao hom mali}}''). This naturally aromatic long-grained rice grows in abundance in the [[Rice production in Thailand|patchwork of paddy fields]] that blanket Thailand's central plains. Once the [[steamed rice|rice is steamed]] or cooked, it is called ''khao suai'' (lit., \"beautiful rice\"). Non-glutinous rice is used for making fried rice dishes, and for [[congee]], of which there are three main varieties: ''khao tom'' (a thin rice soup, most often with minced pork or fish), ''khao tom kui'' (a thick, unflavored rice porridge that is served with side dishes), or ''chok'' (a thick rice porridge that is flavored with broth and minced meat).\n[[File:Som tam khao niao kai yang.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Glutinous rice|Khao niao]]'' (sticky rice), served with ''[[som tam]]'' (papaya salad) and ''[[kai yang]]'' (grilled chicken) as part of a typical [[Isan]] meal]]\nOther varieties of rice eaten in Thailand include: [[sticky rice]] (''khao niao''), a unique variety of rice which contains an unusual balance of the starches present in all rice, causing it to cook up to a sticky texture. Sticky rice, not jasmine rice, is a [[staple food]] in the local cuisines of [[northern Thailand]] and of [[Isan]] ([[northeastern Thailand]]), both regions of Thailand directly adjacent to [[Laos]] with which they share many cultural traits. Thai [[Red Cargo rice]], an unpolished long grain rice with an outer deep reddish-brown color and a white center, has a nutty taste and slightly chewy compared to the soft and gummy texture of jasmine rice. Only the husks of the red rice grains are removed which allows it to retain all its nutrients and vitamins, but unlike brown rice, its red color comes from antioxidants in the bran. Black sticky rice is a type of sticky rice with a deep purple-red color that may appear black. Another unpolished grain, black sticky rice has a rich nutty flavor that is most often used in desserts.\n\nNoodles are usually made from either rice flour, wheat flour or mung bean flour. ''[[Khanom chin]]'' is fresh rice vermicelli made from fermented rice, and eaten with spicy curries such as green chicken curry (''khanom chin kaeng khiao wan kai'') or with salads such as ''som tam''. Other rice noodles, adapted from Chinese cuisine to suit Thai taste, are called ''kuaitiao'' in Thailand and come in three varieties: ''sen yai'' are wide flat noodles, ''sen lek'' are thin flat rice noodles, and ''sen mi'' (also known as [[rice vermicelli]] in the West) are round and thin. ''Bami'' is made from egg and [[wheat]] flour and usually sold fresh. They are similar to the Teochew ''[[mee pok]]''. ''Wun sen'', called [[cellophane noodles]] in English, are extremely thin noodles made from [[mung bean]] flour which are sold dried. Thai noodle dishes, whether stir fried like ''[[phat Thai]]'' or in the form of a noodle soup, usually come as an individual serving and are not meant to be shared and eaten communally.\n\nRice flour (''paeng khao chao'') and [[tapioca]] flour (''paeng man sampalang'') are often used in desserts or as thickening agents.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Pastes and sauces===\n[[File:Phrik nam pla.jpg|thumb|right|''Nam pla phrik'', a table sauce most often eaten with rice dishes, is made from fish sauce and sliced chilies, and often also includes garlic and lime.]]\n\nAn ingredient found in many Thai dishes and used in every region of the country is ''nam pla'', a clear [[fish sauce]] that is very aromatic. Fish sauce is a staple ingredient in Thai cuisine and imparts a unique character to Thai food. Fish sauce is prepared with fermented fish that is made into a fragrant condiment and provides a salty flavor. There are many varieties of fish sauce and many variations in the way it is prepared. Some fish may be fermented with shrimp or spices. Another type of sauce made from fermented fish is ''[[pla ra]]''. It is more pungent than ''nam pla'', and, in contrast to ''nam pla'', which is a clear liquid, ''pla ra'' is opaque and often contains pieces of fish. To add this sauce to a ''som tam'' (spicy papaya salad) is a matter of choice. ''Kapi'', Thai [[shrimp paste]], is a combination of fermented ground shrimp and salt. It is used in the famous chili paste called ''nam phrik kapi'', in rice dishes such as ''khao khluk kapi'' and it is indispensable for making [[Thai curry]] pastes. ''[[Tai pla]]'' is a pungent sauce used in the [[Southern Thailand|southern Thai]] cuisine, that is made from the fermented innards of the [[Short mackerel#Thailand|short mackerel]] (''pla thu'').<ref>Akkasit Jongjareonrak, et al.

Each region has its own special versions. The words ''\"nam phrik\"'' are used by Thais to describe many pastes containing chilies used for dipping, although the more watery versions tend to be called ''[[nam chim]]''. [[Thai curry]] pastes are normally called ''phrik kaeng'' or ''khrueang kaeng'' (lit. curry ingredients), but some people also use the word ''nam phrik'' to designate a curry paste. Red curry paste, for instance, could be called ''phrik kaeng phet'' or ''khrueang kaeng phet'' in Thai, but also ''nam phrik kaeng phet''. Both ''nam phrik'' and ''phrik kaeng'' are prepared by crushing together chilies with various ingredients such as garlic and shrimp paste using a [[mortar and pestle]]. Some ''nam phrik'' are served as a dip with vegetables such as cucumbers, cabbage and yard-long beans, either raw or blanched. One such paste is ''nam phrik num'', a paste of pounded fresh green chilies, shallots, garlic and coriander leaves. The sweet roasted chili paste called ''nam phrik phao'' is often used as an ingredient in ''tom yam'' or when frying meat or seafood, and it is also popular as a spicy \"jam\" on bread, or served as a dip with [[prawn crackers]]. The dry ''nam phrik kung'', made with pounded [[dried shrimp]] (''kung haeng''), is often eaten plain with rice and a few slices of cucumber. French diplomat [[Simon de la Loub\u00e8re]] observed that chili pastes were vital for the way Thai people eat. He provides us with a recipe for ''nam phrik'' with ''[[pla ra]]'' and onions in ''Du Royaume de Siam'', an account of his mission to Thailand published in 1691.<ref>De la Loub\u00e8re, ''The Kingdom of Siam'', p.35</ref>\n\nThe soy sauces which are used in Thai cuisine are of Chinese origin, and the Thai names for them are (wholly or partially) [[loanword]]s from the [[Teochew dialect]]: ''si-io dam'' (black soy sauce), ''si-io khao'' (light soy sauce), ''si-io wan'' (sweet soy sauce), and ''[[Yellow bean paste|taochiao]]'' (fermented whole soy beans). ''Namman hoi'' ([[oyster sauce]]) is also of Chinese origin. It is used extensively in vegetable and meat stir fries.\n\nSatay<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satay#Thailand> is also common in Thailand, grilled or skewered meat served with a spicy peanut dipping sauce made from roasted or fried peanuts.\n\n\n===Vegetables, herbs and spices===\n[[File:Thai market vegetables 01.jpg|right|thumb|A vegetable stall, [[Chiang Mai]]]]\n[[File:Vegetable platter with nam phrik kapi.jpg|right|thumb|At southern Thai restaurants most often a vegetable and herbs platter with [[nam phrik kapi]] is served as a complementary dish]]\nThai dishes use a wide variety of herbs, spices and leaves rarely found in the West. The characteristic flavor of [[kaffir lime]] leaves (''bai makrut'') appears in many Thai soups (e.g., the hot and sour ''[[tom yam]]'') or curry from the southern and central areas of Thailand. The Thai [[Lime (Citrus aurantifolia)|lime]] (''manao'') is smaller, darker and sweeter than the kaffir lime, which has a rough looking skin with a stronger lime flavor. Kaffir lime leaves or rind is frequently combined with [[galangal]] (''kha'') and [[Cymbopogon|lemongrass]] (''takhrai''), either kept whole in simmered dishes or blended together with liberal amounts of chilies and other aromatics to make curry paste. Fresh [[Thai basil]], distinctively redolent of [[clove]]s, and with stems which are often tinged with a purple color, are used to add fragrance in certain dishes such as [[green curry]]. Other commonly used herbs in Thai cuisine include ''phak chi'', ([[coriander]] or cilantro leaves), ''rak phak chi'' (cilantro/coriander roots), [[Mentha spicata|spearmint]] (''saranae''), [[holy basil]] (''kraphao''), ginger (''khing''), [[turmeric]] (''khamin''), [[fingerroot]] (''krachai''), [[Eryngium foetidum|culantro]] (''phak chi farang''),  [[Pandanus amaryllifolius|pandanus]] leaves (''bai toei''), and [[Thai lemon basil]] (''maenglak''). Spices and spice mixtures used in Thai cuisine include ''phong phalo'' ([[five-spice powder]]), ''phong kari'' ([[curry powder]]), and fresh and dried [[Black pepper|peppercorn]]s (''phrik thai''). Northern Thai ''[[larb]]'' uses a very elaborate spice mix, called ''phrik lap'', which includes ingredients such as [[cumin]], [[cloves]], [[long pepper]], [[star anise]], [[Zanthoxylum|prickly ash seeds]] and [[cinnamon]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Phrik lap | url=http://library.cmu.ac.th/ntic/en_lannafood/detail_lannafood.php?id_food=182|website=Lanna Food |publisher=Northern Thai Information Center, Chiang Mai University Library|accessdate=2014-11-03}}</ref>\n[[File:Fish stuffed with Thai herbs.jpg|thumb|[[Channa striata|Snakehead fish]] packed with lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves ready for steaming]]\nBesides kaffir lime leaves, several other tree leaves are used in Thai cuisine such as ''[[cha-om]]'', the young feathery leaves of the ''[[Acacia pennata]]'' tree. These leaves can be cooked in omelettes, soups and curries or eaten raw in northern Thai salads.  [[Banana leaf|Banana leaves]] are often used as packaging for ready-made food or as steamer cups such as in ''[[ho mok]] pla'', a spicy steamed [[p\u00e2t\u00e9]] or [[souffl\u00e9]] made with fish and coconut milk. [[Banana]] flowers are also used in [[Thai salads]] or as a vegetable ingredient for certain curries. The leaves and flowers of the [[neem tree]] (''sadao'') are also eaten blanched. ''Phak lueat'' (leaves from the ''[[Ficus virens]]'') are cooked in curries, and ''bai makok'' (from the ''[[Spondias mombin]]'') can be eaten raw with a chili paste.\n\nFive main chilies are generally used as ingredients in Thai food. One chili is very small (about {{Convert|1.25|cm|in}}) and is known as the hottest chili: ''phrik khi nu suan'' (\"garden mouse-dropping chili\"). The slightly larger chili ''[[Bird's eye chili|phrik khi nu]]'' (\"mouse-dropping chili\") is the next hottest. The green or red ''phrik chi fa'' (\"sky pointing chili\") is slightly less spicy than the smaller chilies. The very large '' phrik yuak'', which is pale green in color, is the least spicy and used more as a vegetable. Lastly, the dried chilies: ''phrik haeng'' are spicier than the two largest chilies and dried to a dark red color.\n[[File:Phrik lap Chiang Rai.jpg|thumb|The elaborate spice mix needed for northern Thai ''[[larb]]'']]\nOther typical ingredients are the several types of [[eggplant]] (''makhuea'') used in Thai cuisine, such as the pea-sized ''[[Solanum torvum|makhuea phuang]]'' and the egg-sized [[Thai eggplant|''makhuea suai'']], often also eaten raw. Although [[broccoli]] is often used in Asian restaurants in the west in ''phat phak ruam'' (stir fried mixed vegetables) and ''rat na'' (rice noodles served in gravy), it was never used in any traditional Thai food in Thailand and was rarely seen in Thailand.

First, ice cream in the palace was made of coconut juice with roasted tamarind on top. Second, ice cream for the public was coconut ice cream with the scent of the Nommaeo flower with a slight sweet taste. The ice cream \"tube\" was born during the reign of [[Rama VII]]. Its ingredients were contained inside a zinc tube which was shaken until it solidified, then skewered stick to serve as a handle.

Chinese-style noodle soups, fried noodles, and fermented Thai rice noodles (''[[khanom chin]]''), served with a choice of different Thai curries, are popular. Nearly everywhere in Thailand you will see ''som tam'' ([[green papaya salad]]) and sticky rice sold at stalls and roadside shops. This is popularly eaten together with grilled chicken; but if the shop doesn't sell any themselves, someone else nearby will. In most cities and towns there will be stalls selling sweet ''roti'', a thin, flat fried dough envelop, with fillings such as banana, egg, and chocolate. The ''roti'' is similar to the Malay ''[[roti canai]]'' and Singaporean ''[[roti prata]]'', and the stalls are often operated by [[Islam in Thailand|Thai Muslims]]. Sweets snacks, collectively called ''khanom'', such as ''tako'' (coconut cream jelly), ''khanom man'' (coconut [[cassava]] cake), and ''khanom wun'' (flavored jellies), can be seen displayed on large trays in glass covered push-carts. Other sweets, such as ''[[khanom bueang]]'' and ''khanom khrok'' (somewhat similar to Dutch ''[[poffertjes]]''), are made to order.\n\nIn the evenings, mobile street stalls, often only a scooter with a side car, drive by and temporarily set up shop outside bars in Thailand, selling ''kap klaem'' (\"drinking food\"). Popular ''kap klaem'' dishes sold by mobile vendors are grilled items such as sun-dried squid, meats on skewers, or grilled sour sausages, and deep-fried snacks such as fried insects or fried sausages. Peeled and sliced fruits are also sold from street carts, laid out on a bed of crushed ice to preserve their freshness. ''Salapao'', steamed buns filled with meat or sweet beans and the Thai version of the Chinese steamed ''[[baozi]]'', are also commonly sold by mobile vendors.\n[[File:Tuk-tuk fastfood grill 1.jpg|thumb|A motorcycle with a side car selling grilled fast food snacks]]\nFood markets in Thailand, large open air halls with permanent stalls, tend to operate as a collection of street stalls, each vendor with their own set of tables and providing (limited) service, although some resemble the regular food courts at shopping malls and large supermarkets, with service counters and the communal use of tables. Food courts and food markets offer many of the same foods as street stalls, both pre-cooked as well as made to order. Night food markets, in the form of a collection of street stalls and mobile vendors, spring up in parking lots, along busy streets, and at temple fairs and local festivals in the evenings, when the temperatures are more agreeable and people have finished work.\n\nThe dishes sold at [[wet markets]] in Thailand tend to be offered pre-cooked. Many people go there, and also to street vendors, to buy food for at work, or to take back home. It is a common sight to see Thais carrying whole communal meals consisting of several dishes, cooked rice, sweets, and fruit, all neatly packaged in plastic bags and [[foam food container]]s, to be shared with colleagues at work or at home with friends and family. Due to the fact that many dishes are similar to those that people would cook at home, it is a good place to find regional, and seasonal, foods.\n\n==Vegetarianism in Thailand==\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Thai \"che\" sign.jpg\n| width1 = 170\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Ah-han-jay.png\n| width2 = 105\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Traditional Thai vegetarian restaurants will carry yellow signs with ''che'' ({{lang-th|[[:wikt:\u0e40\u0e08|\u0e40\u0e08]]}}) (left) or ''ahan che'' ({{lang-th|[[:wikt:\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23|\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23]][[:wikt:\u0e40\u0e08|\u0e40\u0e08]]}}) (right) written in red in [[Thai alphabet|Thai script]].\n}}\nAlthough the [[Nine Emperor Gods Festival|Vegetarian Festival]] is celebrated each year by a portion of Thailand's population, and many restaurants in Thailand will offer vegetarian food during this festival period, pure vegetarian food is usually difficult to find in normal restaurants and eateries in Thailand.

Thai royal cuisine has become very well known from the [[Rattanakosin Era]] onwards.\n\nTypically, Thai royal cuisine has basic characteristics that are close to the basic food prepared by general people. However, Thai royal cuisine focuses on the freshness of seasonal products. Other than that, it is crucial that the way in which Thai royal food is cooked, should be complex and delicate.\n\nLa Loub\u00e8re, an envoy from France during the reign of King Narai the Great, recorded that the food at the court was generally similar to villager food. Ways that make Thai Royal cuisine different food was the beautiful presentation. For example, they served fish and chicken with the bones removed, and the vegetables were served in bite-sized portions. In addition, if beef is used, it should be tenderloin only.\n\nThere are many types of Thai royal cuisine such as ''ranchuan'' curry, ''nam phrik long rue'', ''matsaman'' curry,<!--Curry Rum, (what is this?)--> rice in jasmine-flavored iced water or ''[[khao chae]]'', spicy salad, fruit, and carved vegetable.\n\nThai Chef McDang, himself descended from the royal family, asserts that the difference between royal Thai cuisine and regular Thai cuisine is fiction.
