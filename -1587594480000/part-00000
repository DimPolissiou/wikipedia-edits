During the roughly two weeks after she left [[Santiago, Cape Verde|St Jago]], a fever broke out that killed seven seamen, 18 soldiers, four soldiers' wives, five soldiers' children, 16 convicts, and two convicts' children. Manning had to free some convicts so that they could help man the vessel. ''Pitt'' arrived at [[Rio de Janeiro]] on 1 October, and stayed there more than three weeks, leaving on 25 October. While she was there, four convicts took advantage of their freedom to escape; another escaped when ''Pit'' stopped at [[Cape colony|the Cape]]. ''Pitt'' arrived at [[Port Jackson]], New South Wales on 14 February 1792. Twenty male and nine female convicts died during the voyage. Total deaths, not including children, numbered 49.

(One of the Royal Navy vessels involved appears to have been [[French frigate Sybille (1792)|HMS ''Sybille'']].) The EIC held eight regular ships, and three \"dismantled ships\" in India to support the expedition. None of the three went to Penang, but instead went to the [[Coromandel Coast]] with stores and back to Bengal.

Manning had to free some convicts so that they could help man the vessel. ''Pitt'' arrived at [[Rio de Janeiro]] on 1 October, and stayed there more than three weeks, leaving on 25 October. While she was there, four convicts took advantage of their freedom to escape; another escaped when ''Pit'' stopped at [[Cape colony|the Cape]]. ''Pitt'' arrived at [[Port Jackson]], New South Wales on 14 February 1792. Twenty male and nine female convicts died during the voyage. Total deaths, not including children, numbered 49. Five male convicts escaped during the voyage,<ref name=FSOF>[http://www.jenwilletts.com/convict_ship_pitt_1792.htm ''Free Settler or Felon?

(''Pitt'', ''Royal Admiral'', and [[Kitty (1787 ship)|''Kitty'']], the three convict transports that arrived in Australia in 1792, are often referred to as the [[Fourth Fleet (Australia)|Fourth Fleet]].)\n\n''Pitt'' brought with her what would be the [[Francis (1793)|''Francis'']].

In sailing north from Port Jackson, Manning sailed through the Solomon Islands into [[New Georgia Sound]], and then north in the passage to the Pacific between [[Choiseul Island]] and [[Santa Isabel Island]].

The EIC held eight regular ships, and three \"dismantled ships\" in India to support the expedition. None of the three went to Penang, but instead went to the [[Coromandel Coast]] with stores and back to Bengal.

Established in 1876, it was Florida's only state mental institution until 1947. It currently has a capacity of 1,042 patients. The hospital's current Administration Building is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com\">{{cite web\n|year=\n|url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/FL/Gadsden/state.html\n|title=National Register of Historic Places - Gadsden County, Florida\n|publisher=\n|accessdate=2007-10-03 \n}}</ref>\n\nThe facility's property previously served as a military [[arsenal]] during the [[Seminole Wars]] and the [[American Civil War]], and later became the site of Florida's first state [[prison]]. It was subsequently refurbished as a mental hospital, originally known as '''Florida State Hospital for the Insane''', which opened in 1876. It gained notoriety over the course of its long history. It was sued in ''[[O'Connor v. Donaldson]]'', a case that went to the US Supreme Court, which ruled that the hospital had illegally confined one of its patients. The decision contributed to the [[deinstitutionalization]] movement, which resulted in changes to state laws and the closure of many public mental institutions in the country. The hospital today treats patients with severe mental disabilities who have been civilly or forensically committed to the institution.\n\n==Early history==\nThe hospital campus was originally the site of the '''Apalachicola Arsenal''', built in the 1830s and named after the nearby [[Apalachicola River]]. The hospital's current Administration Building was adapted from the [[U.S. Arsenal-Officers Quarters|original Officers' Quarters]] of the [[Arsenal]] and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com\"/> The Arsenal facility served as a supply depot during the [[Seminole Wars]]. The first engagement of the [[American Civil War]] in [[Florida]] took place here on January 6, 1861 when a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] militia unit from [[Quincy, Florida|Quincy]] overcame [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldiers at the Arsenal.<ref>{{cite web|year=|url=http://www.exploresouthernhistory.com/FLArsenal1.html|title=Apalachicola Arsenal - Chattahoochee|publisher=|accessdate=2007-10-03 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1868, Florida Governor [[Harrison Reed (politician)|Harrison Reed]] converted the arsenal property at Chattahoochee into Florida's first [[Prison|penitentiary]]. Florida's first recorded inmate was Calvin Williams, incarcerated in Chattahoochee in November 1868 for the crime of [[larceny]] and sentenced to one year. By 1869 there were 42 inmates and 14 guards.\n\nIn 1871, the prison was put under civilian jurisdiction. [[Malachi Martin (politician)|Malachi Martin]] was appointed as warden, gaining a reputation for cruelty and [[Political corruption|corruption]]. He used prison labor for his personal benefit to build houses and tend his personal [[vineyard]]s, amassing a huge fortune. The book ''The American Siberia'', written in 1891, portrayed the Chattahoochee prison as a place of relentless barbarity. After the prisoners were relocated in 1876 to a prison at [[Raiford, Florida]], the facility was adapted as a state hospital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.floridamemory.com/Timeline/ |title=http://www.floridamemory.com/Timeline/ |publisher=The Florida Memory Project |accessdate=2007-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404222720/http://www.floridamemory.com/Timeline/ |archivedate=2007-04-04 }}</ref>\n\n==Hospital==\nIn 1876, the prison was refurbished and established by the [[Reconstruction era]] legislature as the Florida State Hospital for the Insane, the state's first [[mental institution]]. It was an effort by the legislature to establish some public welfare institutions to assist residents in the state.\n\nOver time, the hospital was investigated for allegations of [[mistreatment]] of patients, especially as treatment standards changed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe hospital was sued in ''[[O'Connor v. Donaldson]]'' (1975), a case that reached the [[United States Supreme Court]]. [[Kenneth Donaldson]], a patient held there, sued the hospital and staff for confining him for fifteen years against his will. The court ruled that he had been illegally held.\n\nThe decision, as interpreted by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), means that it is unconstitutional to commit for treatment persons who are not imminently a danger to themselves or others and who are capable to a minimal degree of surviving on their own. This interpretation has hampered efforts to implement changes in commitment laws throughout the United States, as most states insist the person meet the \"imminent danger\" standard, accepting the ACLU's interpretation of the O'Connor v. Donaldson case.<ref>{{cite web\n|year=\n|url=http://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/LegalResources/CaseLaws/Case1.htm\n|title=O'Connor v.

Two categories of patients are treated at the hospital; those civilly committed under Statute 394, who represent a small portion of the hospital's residents; and those forensically committed under Statute 916. The Civil portion of the hospital houses adult and elderly individuals who have been [[Civil procedure|civilly committed]] to the hospital, and forensic residents who have been \"stepped down\" to the civil unit. The civil units are also known as Forensic Transition units.\n\nFlorida State Hospital also maintains a forensic wing for the [[Florida Department of Corrections]] to care for [[Prison|inmates]] who have been adjudicated through the [[criminal justice system]] to be incompetent to proceed to trial, or not guilty by reason of insanity. The current maximum housing capacity is 491 residents in civil units and 646 residents in forensic units.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.dcf.state.fl.us/institutions/fsh/services.shtml\n |title       = Florida State Hospital services Florida State Hospital has a Security Staff of Unarmed State certified Officers specially trained for the care and custody of Hospital residents, and safety of staff employees.\n |accessdate  = 2007-10-05\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070812183525/http://www.dcf.state.fl.us/institutions/fsh/services.shtml\n |archivedate = 2007-08-12\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe goal of the hospital's efforts is recovery. The hospital works to restore competency to residents adjudicated incompetent to proceed to trial. Residents receive competency training in both forensic and civil units. The amount of time needed to restore competency varies from a month or two, to up to five years. However, by statute, a patient cannot be committed for more than five years as incompetent to proceed. Upon five years of commitment that patient will be returned to court to have his/her charges dropped or commuted in some way. For residents adjudicated not guilty by reason of insanity, the hospital works to assist the resident in transitioning back into community living by learning appropriate activities for daily living, and social cues. Hospital staff ensure the resident is no longer at risk of reoffending before recommending to the judge that the patient is ready for a conditional release to the community. Unlike patients committed as \"Incompetent to Proceed,\" those committed as \"Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity\" have no time limit on their commitment. They can remain committed by their presiding judge until their recovery is complete.<ref>{{cite web\n|date=June 26, 2007\n|url=http://www.nwfdailynews.com/article/6874\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194447/http://www.nwfdailynews.com/article/6874\n|url-status=dead\n|archive-date=March 3, 2016\n|title= Walton murder case reopens after 10 years\n|publisher=Fort Walton Daily News\n|accessdate=2007-10-09\n}} \n</ref>\n\n==Competency to be executed==\nOne of the tasks of the [[Forensic psychology|forensic psychologists]] in the forensic wing is to evaluate an inmate's [[Competency evaluation (law)|competency]] to be executed, as common law holds that the insane cannot be executed.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S-B-iky44zEC&pg=PA164&lpg=PA164&dq=chattahoochee+hospital#PPA164,M1\n|title=Executing the Mentally Ill: The Criminal Justice System and the Case of Alvin Ford\n|publisher=Sage\n|accessdate=2007-10-03 \n|isbn = 9780803951501|date = 1993-06-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|date=April 22, 1986\n|url=http://www.sagepub.com/booksProdDesc.nav?prodId=Book4133\n|title= Executing the Mentally Ill\n|publisher=Sage\n|accessdate=2007-10-03 \n}}</ref>\nThis is a result of ''[[Ford v.

Established in 1876, it was Florida's only state mental institution until 1947. It currently has a capacity of 1,042 patients. The hospital's current Administration Building is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com\">{{cite web\n|year=\n|url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/FL/Gadsden/state.html\n|title=National Register of Historic Places - Gadsden County, Florida\n|publisher=\n|accessdate=2007-10-03 \n}}</ref>\n\nThe facility's property previously served as a military [[arsenal]] during the [[Seminole Wars]] and the [[American Civil War]], and later became the site of Florida's first state [[prison]]. It was subsequently refurbished as a mental hospital, originally known as '''Florida State Hospital for the Insane''', which opened in 1876. It gained notoriety over the course of its long history. It was sued in ''[[O'Connor v. Donaldson]]'', a case that went to the US Supreme Court, which ruled that the hospital had illegally confined one of its patients. The decision contributed to the [[deinstitutionalization]] movement, which resulted in changes to state laws and the closure of many public mental institutions in the country. The hospital today treats patients with severe mental disabilities who have been civilly or forensically committed to the institution.\n\n==Early history==\nThe hospital campus was originally the site of the '''Apalachicola Arsenal''', built in the 1830s and named after the nearby [[Apalachicola River]]. The hospital's current Administration Building was adapted from the [[U.S. Arsenal-Officers Quarters|original Officers' Quarters]] of the [[Arsenal]] and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com\"/> The Arsenal facility served as a supply depot during the [[Seminole Wars]]. The first engagement of the [[American Civil War]] in [[Florida]] took place here on January 6, 1861 when a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] militia unit from [[Quincy, Florida|Quincy]] overcame [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldiers at the Arsenal.<ref>{{cite web|year=|url=http://www.exploresouthernhistory.com/FLArsenal1.html|title=Apalachicola Arsenal - Chattahoochee|publisher=|accessdate=2007-10-03 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1868, Florida Governor [[Harrison Reed (politician)|Harrison Reed]] converted the arsenal property at Chattahoochee into Florida's first [[Prison|penitentiary]]. Florida's first recorded inmate was Calvin Williams, incarcerated in Chattahoochee in November 1868 for the crime of [[larceny]] and sentenced to one year. By 1869 there were 42 inmates and 14 guards.\n\nIn 1871, the prison was put under civilian jurisdiction. [[Malachi Martin (politician)|Malachi Martin]] was appointed as warden, gaining a reputation for cruelty and [[Political corruption|corruption]]. He used prison labor for his personal benefit to build houses and tend his personal [[vineyard]]s, amassing a huge fortune. The book ''The American Siberia'', written in 1891, portrayed the Chattahoochee prison as a place of relentless barbarity. After the prisoners were relocated in 1876 to a prison at [[Raiford, Florida]], the facility was adapted as a state hospital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.floridamemory.com/Timeline/ |title=http://www.floridamemory.com/Timeline/ |publisher=The Florida Memory Project |accessdate=2007-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404222720/http://www.floridamemory.com/Timeline/ |archivedate=2007-04-04 }}</ref>\n\n==Hospital==\nIn 1876, the prison was refurbished and established by the [[Reconstruction era]] legislature as the Florida State Hospital for the Insane, the state's first [[mental institution]]. It was an effort by the legislature to establish some public welfare institutions to assist residents in the state.\n\nOver time, the hospital was investigated for allegations of [[mistreatment]] of patients, especially as treatment standards changed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe hospital was sued in ''[[O'Connor v. Donaldson]]'' (1975), a case that reached the [[United States Supreme Court]]. [[Kenneth Donaldson]], a patient held there, sued the hospital and staff for confining him for fifteen years against his will. The court ruled that he had been illegally held.\n\nThe decision, as interpreted by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), means that it is unconstitutional to commit for treatment persons who are not imminently a danger to themselves or others and who are capable to a minimal degree of surviving on their own. This interpretation has hampered efforts to implement changes in commitment laws throughout the United States, as most states insist the person meet the \"imminent danger\" standard, accepting the ACLU's interpretation of the O'Connor v. Donaldson case.<ref>{{cite web\n|year=\n|url=http://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/LegalResources/CaseLaws/Case1.htm\n|title=O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563 (1975)\n|publisher=\n|accessdate=2007-10-03 \n}}</ref> The ruling contributed to the [[deinstitutionalization]] movement in the United States, resulting in the shutting down of many large, public psychiatric hospitals.\n\n==Current Population==\nThe hospital treats individuals with severe and persistent major mental illnesses. Two categories of patients are treated at the hospital; those civilly committed under Statute 394, who represent a small portion of the hospital's residents; and those forensically committed under Statute 916. The Civil portion of the hospital houses adult and elderly individuals who have been [[Civil procedure|civilly committed]] to the hospital, and forensic residents who have been \"stepped down\" to the civil unit. The civil units are also known as Forensic Transition units.\n\nFlorida State Hospital also maintains a forensic wing for the [[Florida Department of Corrections]] to care for [[Prison|inmates]] who have been adjudicated through the [[criminal justice system]] to be incompetent to proceed to trial, or not guilty by reason of insanity. The current maximum housing capacity is 491 residents in civil units and 646 residents in forensic units.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.dcf.state.fl.us/institutions/fsh/services.shtml\n |title       = Florida State Hospital services Florida State Hospital has a Security Staff of Unarmed State certified Officers specially trained for the care and custody of Hospital residents, and safety of staff employees.\n |accessdate  = 2007-10-05\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070812183525/http://www.dcf.state.fl.us/institutions/fsh/services.shtml\n |archivedate = 2007-08-12\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe goal of the hospital's efforts is recovery. The hospital works to restore competency to residents adjudicated incompetent to proceed to trial. Residents receive competency training in both forensic and civil units. The amount of time needed to restore competency varies from a month or two, to up to five years. However, by statute, a patient cannot be committed for more than five years as incompetent to proceed. Upon five years of commitment that patient will be returned to court to have his/her charges dropped or commuted in some way. For residents adjudicated not guilty by reason of insanity, the hospital works to assist the resident in transitioning back into community living by learning appropriate activities for daily living, and social cues. Hospital staff ensure the resident is no longer at risk of reoffending before recommending to the judge that the patient is ready for a conditional release to the community. Unlike patients committed as \"Incompetent to Proceed,\" those committed as \"Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity\" have no time limit on their commitment. They can remain committed by their presiding judge until their recovery is complete.<ref>{{cite web\n|date=June 26, 2007\n|url=http://www.nwfdailynews.com/article/6874\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194447/http://www.nwfdailynews.com/article/6874\n|url-status=dead\n|archive-date=March 3, 2016\n|title= Walton murder case reopens after 10 years\n|publisher=Fort Walton Daily News\n|accessdate=2007-10-09\n}} \n</ref>\n\n==Competency to be executed==\nOne of the tasks of the [[Forensic psychology|forensic psychologists]] in the forensic wing is to evaluate an inmate's [[Competency evaluation (law)|competency]] to be executed, as common law holds that the insane cannot be executed.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S-B-iky44zEC&pg=PA164&lpg=PA164&dq=chattahoochee+hospital#PPA164,M1\n|title=Executing the Mentally Ill: The Criminal Justice System and the Case of Alvin Ford\n|publisher=Sage\n|accessdate=2007-10-03 \n|isbn = 9780803951501|date = 1993-06-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|date=April 22, 1986\n|url=http://www.sagepub.com/booksProdDesc.nav?prodId=Book4133\n|title= Executing the Mentally Ill\n|publisher=Sage\n|accessdate=2007-10-03 \n}}</ref>\nThis is a result of ''[[Ford v.
