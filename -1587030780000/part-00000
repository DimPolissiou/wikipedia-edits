Brainiac is Superman's second-deadliest [[archenemy]] after [[Lex Luthor]], and also a frequent enemy of the  [[Justice League]].\n\nBrainiac is typically depicted as an [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] [[cyborg]] or [[Android (robot)|android]]. He is responsible for shrinking and stealing [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]], the [[capital city]] of Superman's home planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. In some continuities, he is also responsible for Krypton's destruction. Due to multiple revisions of DC's [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], several variations of Brainiac have appeared. Most incarnations of Brainiac depict him as a green-skinned being in [[humanoid]] form. He is bald, with a set of linked electrode-like objects (sometimes glowing) protruding from his skull.\n\nHis name is a portmanteau of the words ''brain'' and ''maniac''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.word-detective.com/2007/07/brainiac/ | title=Brainiac | work=The Word Detective | date=July 31, 2007}}</ref> In 2009, Brainiac was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 17th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/17.html | title=Top 100 Comic Book Villains | work=[[IGN]]}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nBrainiac first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #242 (July 1958), and was created by [[Otto Binder]] and [[Al Plastino]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=55}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Silver Age===\n[[File:Action Comics 242.png|thumb|upright|Brainiac's first appearance in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #242 (July 1958); art by [[Curt Swan]] and Stan Kaye]]\nFirst appearing in ''Action Comics'' #242 (July 1958), Brainiac is a bald, green-skinned [[humanoid]] who arrives on [[Earth]] and shrinks various cities, including [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], storing them in bottles with the intent of using them to restore the then-unnamed planet he ruled. He was originally notable only for having shrunk the bottle city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] with his shrinking ray and for using a force field.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleisher |first1=Michael L. |title=The Original Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume Three: Superman |date=2007 |publisher=DC Comics |isbn=1-4012-1389-8 |pages=29-35}}</ref>\n\nIn subsequent appearances in this early period, Brainiac was used mostly as a plot device rather than as a featured villain of the month. Brainiac's next appearance was mostly behind the scenes, when he tried to kill [[Lois Lane]] and [[Lana Lang]], prompting Superman to give Lois and Lana superpowers. But the villain remained unseen except as a plot twist at the end of the story. Brainiac's next appearance was in \"Superman's Return to Krypton\" in ''Superman'' #141 (November 1960), in which the villain stole the bottle city of Kandor, the only city on Krypton that believes Jor-El's warning of doom for the planet, and which had already built a space ark within the city to save the population. Brainiac's next present-day appearance was in ''Action Comics'' #275 (April 1961), which showed the villain planning to defeat Superman by exposing him to both red and green [[kryptonite]], giving Superman a third eye on the back of his head, forcing him to wear various hats to hide it. Superman soon defeated Brainiac and sent him off into the distant past. This was the first in-story appearance of Brainiac's iconic red diode/electrode-like objects atop his head, which had previously appeared on the cover of his first appearance in ''Action Comics'' #242 (July 1958), but were not shown in the actual story. In \"Superboy\" #106 (July 1963), an infant Superman meets Brainiac, and it is explained that Brainiac looks the same due to his 200-year life span. In superman issue #93, Brainiac regenerates himself. It is revealed that he came from a planet called Bryak and, after a voyage in space, he returned to find everybody dead from a plague. He intended to get people from other planets (in shrunken cities to be enlarged with his growth ray) to repopulate Bryak, where he would rule them.\n\nBrainiac's legacy was revealed in ''Action Comics'' #276 (May 1961), in a ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' back-up story. This story introduced a green-skinned, blond-haired teenager named Querl Dox, or '''[[Brainiac 5]]''', who claimed to be Brainiac's 30th-century descendant. Unlike his ancestor, Brainiac 5 used his \"twelfth-level intellect\" for the forces of good and joined the Legion alongside [[Supergirl]], with whom he fell in love. His home planet was given variously as Bryak,<ref>{{Cite comic |story=The Lair of Brainiac |title=[[Superboy]] |issue=#106 |date=July 1963 |publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> Yod or [[Colu]].\n\nIn ''Superman'' #167 (February 1964), it was [[retcon]]ned that Brainiac was a machine created by the Computer Tyrants of Colu as a spy for them to invade other worlds, for which he was given a non-computer appearance. Brainiac's distinctive gridwork of red diodes across his head are also explained. He was created with visible \"electric terminals of his sensory 'nerves'\" that he required to function. Luthor discovers that the Computers could have given him a twelfth-level intellect, but gave him a tenth-level, the same as them, so he would not try to dominate them. Luthor frees Brainiac from a prison on another world and increases his intelligence; however, he implants a timer that will make Brainiac black out so the computer does not betray him, as only Luthor can reset the timer and if Brainiac tries to tamper with it, one touch will cause an explosion. However, Brainiac tricks Luthor by making a device that hypnotizes Luthor, who removes the timer and forgets Brainiac is a computer. Explaining the 1961 introduction of Brainiac's descendant Brainiac 5, his biological disguise included an adopted \"son\", a young Coluan boy who was given the name \"[[Brainiac 2]]\". In the same issue, the [[comic book letter column|letter column]] contained a \"special announcement\" explaining that the change in the characterization of Brainiac was being made \"in deference\" to the \"Brainiac Computer Kit\", a toy computer created by [[Edmund Berkeley]] and based on the [[Geniac]] that predated the creation of the comic book character.<ref>{{Cite comic | story=Metropolis Mailbag (column) | title=[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] | issue=#167 | date=February 1964 | publisher=DC Comics | location=New York | url=http://www.vintagecomputer.net/brainiac/superman_Feb_number167_mailbag.jpg}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Engblom | first=Mark | title=Which Came First?

Brainiac sees a monument to this when he returns to Colu.\n\n====30th century (Pre-''Crisis'')====\nAt some indeterminate point in time, Brainiac fled into the 30th century. Developing the ability to absorb and manipulate massive amounts of stellar energy, he remade himself as \"Pulsar Stargrave\".<ref>As revealed in ''Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes'' #226-227 (April\u2013May 1977)</ref> He became a powerful enemy of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], and once masqueraded as Brainiac 5's biological father.<ref>''Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes'' #224, #226 (February/April 1977)</ref> In current continuity, Brainiac's connection to Pulsar Stargrave remains an open question, one even Brainiac 5 has yet to resolve.<ref>''[[Adventure Comics#Revival|Adventure Comics]]'' (vol. 2) #9 (late May 2010)</ref>\n\n===Bronze Age===\n[[File:Brainiac544.PNG|thumb|upright|Brainiac's robotic incarnation in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #544; art by [[Ed Hannigan]]]]\n\nIn the 1980s, [[DC Comics]] attempted to re-define several aspects of its ''Superman'' series in order to boost sagging sales. At the same time as [[Lex Luthor]] acquired his green-and-purple Lexorian battlesuit, Brainiac was re-envisioned (under the auspices of writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[Gil Kane]]). In ''Action Comics'' #544-546 (June-August 1983), Brainiac had constructed a giant, artificial, computer-controlled planet and used it in his latest attempt to destroy Superman. His defeat at the hands of the Man of Steel left him trapped at the center of the planet, unable to escape. He was forced to make a nearby star, Epsilon 4, go [[nova]] in order to destroy the machine-world. It, however, also dissolved Brainiac's humanoid body into a stream of sentient molecules that, after a fantastic voyage through time and space, returned to the present and reinstated as a living computer with no trace of human emotions and a mind steeped in logic. His new body (designed by [[Ed Hannigan]]) had the appearance of a [[skeleton]] of living metal with a grey (sometimes iridescent), [[honeycomb]]-patterned \"braincase.\"<ref>''Who's Who in the DC Universe'' #3 (May 1985)</ref> He also created a [[starship]] to house his new body which was actually an extension of himself; the ship was shaped like his own skull, with metal tentacles dangling from it that he could manipulate at will. Brainiac retained this appearance until after the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' miniseries.\n\nThe Silver/Bronze Age Brainiac met his final end in the \"[[Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]\" storyline that closed out the Pre-''Crisis'' Superman chronology. [[Lex Luthor]] found Brainiac's robotic head and was fused with it, making him immortal to everything. Brainiac took control of Luthor's body, mind and vocal cords and sought to destroy Superman once and for all, teaming up with the [[Legion of Super-Villains]]. Fighting Brainiac's control, Luthor begged a superpowered [[Lana Lang]] to kill him; she complied by breaking his neck. Though Luthor died, Brainiac was able to retain control of the body for a little while before [[rigor mortis]] set in and his brain was forced to leave it. \"Propelled by sheer malice\", the head crawled a few inches before finally running down.\n\n===Modern Age===\nIn the Post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' [[DC Universe]], Brainiac's history was completely rewritten. The Post-''Crisis'' version of Brainiac was now a radical Coluan scientist called Vril Dox who, having attempted to overthrow the Computer Tyrants of Colu, was sentenced to death. In his last moments before disintegration, his consciousness was attracted light years away to '''Milton Moses Fine''', a human sideshow mentalist who worked under the alias \"The Amazing Brainiac\".<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Cite book | last=Greenberger | first=Robert | author-link=Robert Greenberger | contribution=Brainiac | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=61 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=[[London]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5}}</ref> Needing cranial fluid to maintain his possession of Fine, Dox went on a murder spree. He discovered that Fine had genuine [[psychic]] powers and was thus a [[metahuman]], which he frequently wielded against Superman.<ref>''[[Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #438 (March 1988)</ref>\n\n====\"Panic in the Sky\"====\nIn the early 1990s, Brainiac returned in the \"Panic in the Sky\" storyline. He seized control of [[Warworld]] and manipulated [[Maxima (comics)|Maxima]] into assisting him. Then he brainwashed [[Supergirl (Matrix)|Supergirl]] and the alien warrior [[Draaga]] before capturing [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] and setting off for Earth.<ref>''Action Comics'' #674 (February 1992)</ref><ref>''Superman: The Man of Steel'' #9 (March 1992)</ref> [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] and [[Lightray (DC Comics)|Lightray]] of [[New Genesis]] attacked Warworld, but they were quickly taken down by Maxima and Supergirl. Brainiac sent the mental image of the [[New Gods]] captured to Superman in order to taunt him, and he also sent his \"headship\" (a green-hued variant of the Pre-''Crisis'' skull-like ship) to Earth in a [[punitive expedition]].<ref name=super65>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #65 (March 1992)</ref>\n\nThese acts prompted Superman to go on the offense, rather than wait for the inevitable invasion. He gathered a coalition of most of the world's superheroes and launched a preemptive strike at Warworld before it could arrive on Earth.<ref name=super65/> A small, elite force was left behind for any scouting forces that would be sent ahead. Superman led the attack on Warworld, where Supergirl and Draaga managed to shrug off their brainwashing and rally to Superman (although Draaga was killed in the fighting).<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #488 (March 1992)</ref><ref>''Superman: The Man of Steel'' #10 (April 1992)</ref> Brainiac briefly took control of some of Earth's heroes, but it was not enough to turn the tide.<ref>''Action Comics'' #675 (March 1992)</ref> Maxima would shortly switch sides in the fighting too, perceiving Brainiac as the true villain at last. [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], Maxima, and the [[Metal Men]] attacked him in his lair, where Maxima managed to [[lobotomy|lobotomize]] him (but was stopped short of killing him).<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #66 (April 1992)</ref> His vegetative body was taken back to New Genesis for observation.<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #489 (April 1992)</ref>\n\n====Dead again====\nBrainiac would next emerge about a year after the death and return of Superman. After a dead body appeared in Superman's tomb, prompting the world to wonder if the Superman who was flying around was the original or a fake,<ref>''Superman the Man of Steel'' #38 (November 1994)</ref> Superman began to track down all of his foes who might be capable of such a hoax.<ref>''Action Comics'' #704 (November 1994)</ref> While Brainiac was initially eliminated as a suspect,<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #95 (December 1994)</ref> he soon turned out to be the true culprit, creating the illusion even in his comatose state on [[New Genesis]]. He managed to revive himself there and returned to Earth in secret. While hidden, he created even more delusions, causing Superman to question his very sanity before realizing who was really at fault.<ref>''Action Comics'' #705 (December 1994)</ref><ref>''Superman the Man of Steel'' #40 (January 1995)</ref> Superman and Brainiac squared off in Metropolis, where Superman taunted the evil villain, claiming that at heart he was really just Milton Moses Fine, a cheap entertainer. This caused some break in Brainiac's mind where Fine's personality reasserted himself, burying Brainiac's. Fine was then escorted off to a psychiatric facility.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #96 (January 1995)</ref>\n\n====The Doomsday Wars====\nDuring a later skirmish with Superman in Metropolis, Milton Moses Fine's body was irreparably damaged, leaving Brainiac with only a short time to live. In order to preserve his life, he concocted an elaborate scheme by having an agent of his, a Coluan named Prin Vnok, use a [[time travel|time machine]] to travel to the End of Time itself and retrieve [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], who had been left there by Superman and [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]] to ensure that he would never be a threat again, and use Doomsday as a new host body.<ref name=doomswar2>''Superman: The Doomsday Wars'' #2 (1998)</ref>\n\nSeconds before the forces of [[entropy]] destroyed him forever, Doomsday was taken to safety by Vnok and returned to Colu. There, a terminally-wounded Brainiac transferred his consciousness into Doomsday's body, temporarily becoming the most powerful being in the universe; a [[genius]] [[psychic]] mind inside an unstoppable, indestructible titan. However, Doomsday's own raging mind would eventually overwhelm Brainiac's will, and he reacted too quickly for Brainiac and Vnok to erase his mind using chemical or psionic treatments, forcing Brainiac to find another body. While still lodged in Doomsday's head, Brainiac decided to acquire a sample of human DNA that he could modify with Doomsday's DNA to create a new version of Doomsday that did not possess the creature's mind. Brainiac chose to use [[Pete Ross]] and [[Lana Lang]]'s newborn baby, born eight weeks premature and at that moment being transported by Superman to the best Neo-Natal Intensive Care Unit in the country-as the template for his new body. He intercepted Superman during the trip to the hospital and stole the baby to hurt his long-time foe, correctly deducing that it was the child of someone close to Superman.<ref name=doomswar2/> Superman thwarted Brainiac's plot by driving him out of Doomsday's body with the use of a [[telepathy]]-blocking 'psi-blocker' that he had used in his last battle, forcing Brainiac out of Doomsday and leaving him with no other option but to adopt a recently designed robotic body, dubbed '''Brainiac 2.5''', where he himself believed would be forever trapped, as he could not abandon it.<ref name=doomswar3>''Superman: The Doomsday Wars'' #3 (1998)</ref>\n\n====Brainiac 13====\n[[File:Brainiac 13.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Brainiac 13. Art by [[Ed McGuinness]], Steve Kim, and Tommy Yune.]]\nAt the turn of the [[millennium]], Brainiac 2.5 revealed that he had placed a sleeper [[computer virus|virus]] in [[LexCorp]]'s [[Y2K bug]] safeguards. This virus was intended to dramatically boost his abilities. However, the virus instead allowed his upgraded future self, '''Brainiac 13''' (or \"'''B-13'''\"), to travel from the 64th century to the present day and take control of Brainiac 2.5's body.\n\nBrainiac 13 then began transforming Metropolis into the 64th-century version of the city, which he controlled, and also began upgrading [[Metallo]] into a giant-sized version of himself. Brainiac 13 then took control of several android superheroes, such as the [[Red Tornado]] and [[Hourman (android)|Hourman]], and used them against Superman. The [[Metal Men]]'s responsometers were able to protect them from his programming, and allowed them to help defeat Metallo.\n\nDuring a fight with the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]] (who was attempting to 'hijack' the B13 virus and use it for its own ends), Superman discovered that Brainiac 13 could not cope with Kryptonian technology, due to incompatibility issues. This gave Superman a plan to stop Brainiac 13's scheme. With the aid of the rebuilt [[Kelex]], Superman tricked Luthor into connecting a Kryptonian battlesuit to one of Brainiac 13's power conduits. Kelex then reactivated the Red Tornado to help Superman break Brainiac 13 down into his respective nanobots and trap him in the suit.\n\nBrainiac 13 was able to work with Brainiac 2.5\u2014now transferred into the aged body of [[Lena Luthor]]\u2014and prepared a tactic against [[Imperiex]] for the upcoming [[Our Worlds at War|Imperiex War]]. The Brainiacs successfully engineered Imperiex's defeat, allowing Brainiac 13 to absorb Imperiex's power and use it to overpower the combined heroes and villains of the universe while simultaneously devastating both Earth and Apokolips. Brainiac 13 planned to use the power he stole from Imperiex to conquer the universe and reshape it in his image, and is made so powerful by the absorption that none of the heroes, not even Superman, can hope to damage him.<ref>''Superman the Man of Steel'' #117 (October 2001).</ref> However, with help from Lex's temporal displacement technology and Darkseid's Boom Tube technology boosted by magic supplied by Tempest and the Amazons, Superman was able to destroy Brainiac 13 and Imperiex by sending them through a temporal [[Boom tube]] where they were annihilated in the Big Bang. Brainiac 13 had his body disintegrated and the remnants of his mind scattered across sixty trillion light years, finally killing the chronologically last known version of Brainiac.<ref>''Action Comics'' #782 (October 2001).</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Brainiac 13, Superman discovered that the version of Krypton he previously visited via the [[Phantom Zone]] was, in fact, a trap created by Brainiac 13. Having been defeated by Kryptonian technology, Brainiac 13 had traveled back in time to the real Krypton prior to its destruction. There, he stole the Eradicator matrix and [[Jor-El]]'s diaries, and created a false Krypton based on Jor-El's favorite period in history.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=[[Jeph Loeb|Loeb, Jeph]] | cowriters=[[Joe Casey]], [[Mark Schultz (comics)|Mark Schultz]], ''et al.'' | penciller=[[Ed McGuinness|McGuinness, Ed]] | copencillers=[[Duncan Rouleau]], [[Pasqual Ferry|Pascual Ferry]], ''et al.'' | inker=[[Cam Smith|Smith, Cam]] | coinkers=Marlo Alquiza, Tom Nguyen, ''et al.'' | title=Superman: Return to Krypton | date=March 2004 | publisher=DC Comics | location=New York | id={{ISBN|978-1840237986}}}}</ref>\n\nSometime later, Superman traveled into the future and battled '''Brainiac 12'''. He learned that everything Brainiac 13 did in the past was designed to ensure things reached the point where Brainiac 13 would be created. Brainiac 12's defeat before his upgrade apparently reversed the advances Brainiac 13 had made to Metropolis.<ref name=\"superman200\">''Superman'' (vol. 2) #200 (February 2004)</ref>\n\n====The Insiders====\n{{Main|Indigo (comics)}}\n[[File:Brainiacs.jpg|thumb|right|Brainiac with his descendant [[Brainiac 8]], as they discuss his use of organics; art by Matthew Clark]]\nAround the time of the ''[[Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day|Graduation Day]]'' event, a future version of Brainiac, called '''Brainiac 6''', used his \"granddaughter\", '''Brainiac 8''' (also known as [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]]), to kill [[Donna Troy]] in order to ensure the fate of Colu. Indigo then infiltrated the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] until she attacked the team, along with Brainiac 6 and his allies, Lex Luthor, and a brainwashed [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], who had attacked the [[Teen Titans]]. In the ensuing battle, Indigo died and Superboy broke away from the brainwashing, while Luthor escaped. While his ship was destroyed, Brainiac's condition and whereabouts after the battle are unknown.<ref>''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) #24-25 (July- August 2005)</ref><ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #24-25 (July - August 2005)</ref>\n\n====Silver Age Brainiac in the Post-''Crisis'' universe====\nLater stories revealed that elements of Brainiac's Pre-''Crisis'' history occurred in the Post-''Crisis'' character's history prior to his possession of Milton Moses Fine and his first encounter with Superman. The citizens of Kandor recall that Brainiac stole their city from Krypton, and not the alien wizard Tolos.<ref name=\"superman200\"/>\n\n''[[History of the DC Universe]]'' mentions his defeat by the [[Omega Men]], although this is not seen in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' itself, and noted a second Brainiac was created in a laboratory on Earth two years later. In the ''[[Silver Age (DC Comics)|Silver Age: JLA]]'' one-shot, the [[Injustice League]] discovered numerous shrunken alien cities found in Brainiac's abandoned spaceship.\n\n====Brainiac's updated mechanical form====\n[[File:SupermanCv219.jpg|thumb|right|Brainiac battles [[Superman]] during the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' event. Cover of ''[[Superman vol. 2|Superman]]'' (vol. 2) #219 (September 2005). Art by [[Ed Benes]].]]\nBrainiac later reappeared as a [[Swarm intelligence|swarm of interlinked nanotechnological units]]. Its operation was to sabotage a [[Waynetech#Wayne Technologies|Waynetech research facility]] accomplished by infecting [[Metallo]] with a [[computer virus]] and controlling him from orbit. Superman and [[Batman]] tracked Brainiac's signal to an orbital facility and attacked. Brainiac's nanoswarm body was destroyed, though he had infected the [[Metal Men]] during their previous encounter with Metallo. Brainiac proceeded to use them to acquire a prototype [[OMAC (comics)|OMAC unit]], which Bruce Wayne had developed through the use of Brainiac 13 nanotechnology. Superman and Batman destroyed the OMAC body with the aid of the Metal Men, after the Metal Men overcame Brainiac's control.<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #34-36 (May\u2013August 2007)</ref>\n\n====Return====\n{{Main|Brainiac (story arc)}}\nFollowing revisions to Superman's continuity in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' and ''Action Comics'' #850, Brainiac reappeared in a self-titled five-part story arc in ''Action Comics''. In ''Action Comics'' #866 (August 2008), a Brainiac robot probe (resembling his skeleton-esque Pre-''Crisis'' incarnation, and mistaken for the real Brainiac by Clark) arrives on Earth and battles Superman. After the probe is defeated, information about Superman's blood is sent to the original Brainiac. As Brainiac wakes up, his computer announces \"Attempt #242 in progress\", a reference to Brainiac's first appearance in ''Action Comics'' #242, and to the many encounters between Brainiac and Superman. In the following issue, [[Kara Zor-El|Supergirl]] reveals to Superman that Brainiac shrunk the Kryptonian city of Kandor and placed it in a bottle, and that all previous incarnations of Brainiac that Superman has encountered were just probes, clones, and nanite-controlled bodies. She notes that no one has ever actually seen Brainiac. Inspired by Supergirl's story, Superman attempts to find Brainiac and stop him. He heads to a world under attack by Brainiac just in time to be caught in a supernova as Brainiac destroys the system's star and the populated world along with. The supernova knocks Superman out, and he is caught and brought onto Brainiac's ship.\n\nSuperman escapes from his imprisonment and sees Brainiac emerging from his \"bio-shell\". This version of Brainiac resembles a much larger and more muscular version of the original, Pre-''Crisis'' Brainiac, and has motives similar to the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' incarnation of the character in that he travels the universe and steals the knowledge of various alien cultures, abducting and shrinking cities from each planet as samples, and then destroys the planet so that the value of the destroyed civilization's knowledge is increased. Superman attacks Brainiac, but Brainiac manages to overpower the Man of Steel before restraining him with the help of his ship's internal systems. Brainiac inserts the subdued Superman into a machine that allows him to read the Kryptonian's mind, with the intent of assimilating his brain. Brainiac's ship then travels to Earth and prepares to abduct the city of Metropolis.\n\nBrainiac successfully steals Metropolis, and prepares to fire a missile that will destroy the Sun and the Earth itself. Supergirl ends up captured along with the rest of Metropolis, but Superman breaks out of his restraints again and frees her. Supergirl stops the missile, while Superman battles Brainiac. Brainiac appears to have the advantage in physical combat yet again, but Superman knocks Brainiac out of his ship and into a swamp, where Brainiac is overwhelmed by the microscopic organisms covering his body. Superman uses this distraction to defeat Brainiac. While Superman frees the cities of Metropolis and Kandor, the villain launches a missile to the Kent farm in an act of spite. The farm is destroyed, and Jonathan Kent suffers a fatal heart attack because of it.<ref>''Action Comics'' #866-870 (June\u2013October 2008)</ref> Brainiac is brought to a top-secret military base, where the imprisoned Lex Luthor is assigned to discover his secrets. Luthor eventually manages to use Brainiac's connection to his ship to kill the soldiers assigned to watch him. Brainiac manages to free himself from Luthor's control, forcing him on board the ship, and the two make their escape.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #0 (April 2009)</ref>\n\nNotably, upon learning of Brainiac's modus operandi of destroying planets by destabilizing nearby stars when he is done collecting cities and knowledge from said planets, Superman openly speculates that Brainiac destroyed Krypton, which was destroyed when its sun went nova soon after Brainiac abducted Kandor and Argo. He also asks the alien what he did to Krypton's sun.<ref name=\"Action Comics #868 October 2008\">''Action Comics'' #868 (October 2008).</ref> Brainiac ignores the query, neither confirming or denying his responsibility, though he does heavily imply it (\"In fifty-seven minutes, my solar aggressor will reach your sun. It will flare up, and the Earth will be incinerated. Just like Krypton.\"). Superman still believes Brainiac had a part in Krypton's destruction after the end of this story arc.<ref>''Superman Secret Files and Origins 2009''</ref>\n\n====New Krypton====\n{{Main|Superman: Last Stand of New Krypton|Superman: War of the Supermen}}\n\nFollowing this, Brainiac, now in possession of his ship again, unleashes his robot army against the newly created planet of [[New Krypton]], and the Kryptonian citizens rise up to fight the drones. General Zod's army proves totally unable to fend them off, as the Brainiac's ship's force fields are seemingly invulnerable and his drones are equipped with red sunray guns, allowing them to kill tens of thousands of Kryptonians. Superman, being the only one who knows how to penetrate his force fields (having learned the trick in the previous story arc), manages to enter Brainiac's ship. Supergirl leads the Kryptonians against the drones, but is attacked by an anti-Kryptonian Brainiac probe. [[Superboy]], [[Mon-El]], and the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] join the fight and save Supergirl.\n\nAfter this, Brainiac shrinks Kandor again and re-bottles it, including a miniature red sun to de-power all the Kryptonians inside. The Legion, Supergirl, Superboy, Zod, and Superman all make it on to Brainiac's ship, thanks to Brainiac 5 hacking his ancestor's force fields and allowing them entry. The Legion explains to Zod that, just as Krypton's city of Kandor is held in a bottle onboard Brainiac's ship, other planets' cities are also imprisoned, and, therefore, Zod cannot destroy Brainiac's ship until the cities can be rescued. Zod sends Supergirl off and then arrests the Legionnaires, branding them terrorists. Meanwhile, Superman is about to face off against Brainiac when he is knocked down by a kryptonite energy blast fired by Lex Luthor and subsequently captured. Brainiac locks him in captivity with the intent to experiment on him, but Superman escapes and meets up with the rest of the superheroes and Zod on a separate section of the ship. Zod enters the scene and engages Brainiac in combat while Supergirl, Superboy, and the Legion recover the bottled cities on Brainiac's ship, including Kandor. Zod seems to be losing his fight with Brainiac, when suddenly Superman gets up and tackles Brainiac from behind. Before the battle between the two Kryptonians and the villain can continue, Brainiac's ship starts to destabilize and descend towards the planet. It is revealed that Lex Luthor sabotaged the ship and re-sized one of the cities while inside.\n\nLuthor's intervention causes the ship to crash into New Krypton, destroying it while Supergirl and the Legion re-size Kandor. However, the city that Luthor expanded is still growing, now putting Kandor at risk. As [[Brainiac 5]] works on the problem, Supergirl is shocked to discover Superman impaled by pieces of Brainiac's ship as a result of the explosion. Superman appears to have been fatally stricken. Luthor, though reeling from the explosion, is pleased with all the destruction he has caused. Brainiac confronts Luthor in the ruins of the ship and is furious that Lex sabotaged his ship. Luthor mocks him and spits in his eye before Brainiac angrily snaps Luthor's neck, killing him.\n\nNow deprived of his ship and technology, and seemingly depowered by his ship's destruction, Brainiac finds himself faced by an entire city of angry, solar-powered Kryptonians. Zod is eager for a final showdown with Brainiac, who calls Zod a coward for confronting Brainiac with his powers intact and an army of super-powered Kryptonians at his back. In response, Zod fires the red sun radiation from an Archer rifle at himself, to remove his powers and thus supposedly level the playing field as he prepares to take Brainiac down. Brainiac 5 gives Superman a transfusion of Conner's blood and exposes him to a very large dose of concentrated synthesized yellow sun rays. Using these techniques, Brainiac 5 is able to revive Superman.\n\nDespite the loss of his powers, Zod is able to get the upper hand on the similarly-powerless Brainiac and force him to his knees. Zod is about to shoot Brainiac when Superman intervenes. This causes a heated argument between Superman and Zod. Zod commands his soldiers to restrain Kal-El so Zod can proceed with the execution of Brainiac. Brainiac 5, sensing that this is his moment of destiny, steps in and teleports himself and Brainiac off of New Krypton.\n\nIt is revealed that Lex used a Luthor robot, supplied by the [[Toyman]], to accomplish his mission on New Krypton, and that Brainiac killed the robot instead. Lex is very much alive and discussing with General Lane how his objective, to bring chaos to New Krypton, was achieved. Lex has been working as an agent of General Lane all along. The disarray that Lex caused provides Lane with a window of opportunity as he prepares for the impending war with New Krypton. Lex receives a Presidential pardon for his efforts. The story ends with Zod rallying his people as he declares war on the planet Earth. The story concludes in the next miniseries, ''[[Superman: War of the Supermen]]''.\n\nMon-El plants the many bottled cities that Brainiac has captured over the years on various planets across the galaxy. These cities will one day become the United Planets by the 31st century, the same planets that will produce the members of the Legion of Super-Heroes.\n\nBrainiac 5 takes Brainiac to their homeworld of [[Colu]] where he hands him over to [[Vril Dox]] II, a.k.a. Brainiac 2. Vril Dox happily turns his \"father\" over to his people for his crimes. However [[Lyrl Dox]], a.k.a. Brainiac 3, releases his \"grandfather\" with a weapon called Pulsar Stargrave. What then occurs is an all-out battle for Colu between all three present-day Brainiacs. Vril Dox even calls in [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] for help. Brainac breaks out of his prison and, after causing much damage on Colu, escapes with Pulsar Stargrave in tow for parts unknown.<ref>''R.E.B.E.L.S.'' (vol. 2) #15-20 (May\u2013September 2010)</ref>\n\n====''The New 52''====\nBrainiac's origin in ''[[The New 52]]'' is revealed in ''Superman'' #23.2. Vril Dox was acknowledged as the greatest scientist on his homeworld, Yod-Colu, given his advances in force field technology and miniaturization. He developed an artificial intelligence, C.O.M.P.U.T.O., allowing him to discover the fifth dimension. Dox discovered the fifth dimension was in a state of war, and a group of its inhabitants, the Multitude, had entered their dimension and destroyed over a hundred planets. Realizing Yod-Colu was next in the Multitude's path, Dox tried to find a way to save his planet, even performing experiments on his son. The magistrates of Yod-Colu sentenced Dox to exile, but Dox used C.O.M.P.U.T.O. to take control of Yod-Colu's computer networks. Copying the planet's database, Dox constructed an army of robot servants called Terminauts and miniaturized the city his wife and son lived on and bottled it in a force field, while the rest of Yod-Colu was destroyed by the Multitude.\n\nAfter the destruction of Yod-Colu, Dox constructed an army of starships and distributed his consciousness across a series of robots that would each travel the universe in order to preserve planets from the Multitude, becoming known as the Collector of Worlds. One of these robots attacked Krypton. Dox became fascinated by Jor-El, a Kryptonian scientist who actually saved his homeworld from the Multitude. Upon returning to Krypton, however, Brainiac discovered Krypton had been destroyed.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 3) #23.2 (September 2013)</ref>\n\nReferred to at first as 'The Collector of Worlds', Brainiac is first seen as the mysterious informant that supplies Lex Luthor information of Superman and his alien nature.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 2) #2 (October 2011)</ref> Clark is having a dream of Krypton's final moments in which an artificial intelligence that controls the planet wakes up robots in an attempt to preserve the Kryptonian culture. Later, while Clark conducts an interview in a robotic factory, the same harvester robots appear.\n\nJohn Corben (the soon-to-be supervillain [[Metallo]]) is suddenly possessed by the artificial intelligence. It demands Superman.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 2) #3 (November 2011)</ref> The robots create havoc throughout Metropolis, but Superman soon realizes that they are really after him. Superman fights the possessed Corben with the help of [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|John Henry Irons]].\n\nAlthough they managed to defeat him, the alien sentience had already miniaturized and bottled the city of Metropolis and took it to his ship in space.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 2) #4 (December 2011)</ref> Superman travels to the ship to find many alien bottled cities, Kandor included. The alien identifies himself as a being from the planet Colu where he was known as C.O.M.P.U.T.O and on Krypton he was called Brainiac 1.0. He claims that, without Superman and the ship that brought him to Earth, his Kryptonian collection is incomplete. The alien intelligence demands Superman make a choice: the intelligence will disable life support in both the Kandor and Metropolis bottles, and Superman must choose which city to save using indestructible Kryptonian armor found on the ship.\n\nSuperman decides on neither and wears the armor (which changes instantly into the current Superman costume design). Brainiac sends Metallo to attack Superman, but due to Superman reasoning with him over his feelings for Lois Lane, he breaks free of Brainiac's control and joins Superman in his attack. Superman then uses his rocket from Krypton that had also been miniaturized with Metropolis to attack Brainiac's mind, which the rocket was able to do since its primary mission was to protect Kal-El. In doing so, Metropolis was returned to Earth and Superman took possession of Brainiac's ship and made it his new super citadel.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 2) #8 (April 2012)</ref>\n\nNotably, the ship Clark was placed into as a child was described as having \"Brainiac AI\", leaving the identity of the Collector of Worlds in doubt.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 2) #5 (January 2012)</ref> The Colony of the Collector of Worlds told Superman that its AI technology went by different names, beginning on Yod-Colu as [[Computo (comics)|C.O.M.P.U.T.O.]] On Noma, he was called Pneumenoid; on Bryak it was Mind2; on Krypton he was called Brainiac 1.0; and, finally on Earth, he is the Internet.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 2) #7 (March 2012)</ref>\n\nAfter this defeat, Brainiac retreated to deeper parts of the cosmos, and eventually came across the planet Tolerance, the setting of a bounty hunting glimmernet game show called ''The Hunted''. Striking a deal with [[Lady Styx]], overlord of the Tenebrian Dominion, he bottles a portion of the Sh'diki Borough of Tolerance to add to his collection. He encounters Jediah Caul, a former member of the Green Lantern Corps, who combats and infects Brainiac's ship. Ultimately, Brainiac abandons his plans with the Sh'diki Borough and ejects Caul and the bottled city before leaving for parts unknown.<ref>''Threshold'' #5-6 (July\u2013August 2013)</ref>\n\n====''Convergence''====\n{{Main|Superman: Doomed|Convergence (comics)}}\nBack on Earth, during an investigation of 20 kidnapped people who developed metahuman powers after being kidnapped by Brainiac, one of these 20 infects Lois Lane, thereby giving Brainiac control over a close ally of Superman.<ref>''Action Comics Annual'' (vol. 2) #2 (August 2013)</ref> Brainiac plots his return to Earth, using Lane to infiltrate Earth's defense systems to allow an easier path for his physical return.<ref>''Superman/Wonder Woman'' #8 (July 2014)</ref> and even upgrading her body to contain his 12th level intelligence. His minion Cyborg-Superman (a reconstructed [[Zor-El]], father of [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]])<ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 6) #21 (August 2013)</ref> constructs a portal to allow Brainiac's command ship and \"daughter ships\" to travel to Earth from throughout the galaxy.<ref>''Superman/Wonder Woman Annual'' #1 (September 2014)</ref>\n\nSuperman, whom Brainiac had conspired to 'infect' with the monster Doomsday in order to drive him away from Earth, uses his augmented power to attack Brainiac's gigantic mothership and break through to its core and, finally, Vril Dox himself. The Coluan appears still-humanoid, and explains his reasoning for stealing minds from throughout the universe: he has concluded that if he can 'unite' the minds of a certain critical number of people, he will be able to change reality itself. His motivation for this appears a desire to right the wrongs he feels responsible for: the loss of his wife and child back on Colu. His plan is undone when Superman drags him, mothership and all, into a black hole. But then, Vril Dox is snatched away to safety, it seems, by a being who appears to be the true Brainiac: an immensely powerful entity from outside the universe itself.<ref>''Superman: Doomed''</ref>\n\nThis version of Brainiac, a composite of Brainiac from around the Multiverse, is revealed to be the pre-''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' era Brainiac who, having found his way into the Source Wall and into the Multiverse, was thrown back in the timestream and mutated by the effects of \"crisis\" events such as ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', ''Zero Hour'', and ''52'', creating a godlike being.<ref>''Convergence'' #0</ref> He then uncovered the location of Vanishing Point from nearly killing New 52 Earth-0's [[Michelle Carter (comics)|Michelle Carter]], from which he could roam the complete history of the Multiverse, collecting doomed cities from defunct timelines, alternative futures, and parallel worlds to add to his collection, in ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'', leaving behind an agent, Telos, to rule a planet of the same name containing the cities. Brainiac's attempt to do this to a future timeline of Earth-0 was narrowly averted by the heroes in the story ''[[The New 52: Futures End]]''; Brainiac was contained in a T-sphere, leaving Telos stranded without his master, prompting the events of ''Convergence'' in which the planets are bid to fight each other. When the events of ''Convergence'' nearly end in an irreversible destruction of the Multiverse, the time traveller [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]], formerly the pre-''Flashpoint'' Booster Gold, frees Brainiac, who reveals he is sick from his mutations and only wishes to return to normal, to being Brainiac of Colu. He sends most of the heroes home, and with help from the ''Zero Hour'' [[Hal Jordan|Parallax]] and the pre-''Flashpoint'' Superman, averts the collapse of the Multiverse from ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', and is returned to the normal Brainiac. His actions also allow various parallel universes and alternate timelines to exist as the new Multiverse.<ref>''Convergence'' #1-8</ref>\n\n====Green Lantern Corps====\nBrainiac's name is first referenced in an issue of ''Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps''. The entirety of the Green and Yellow Lanterns (including [[Hal Jordan]], [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], and [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]]), along with [[Starro the Conqueror]], are lured into a trap and subsequently hit with a shrink ray while on the planet Xudar, leaving them tiny and helpless. In the next issue, they are trapped in a bottle, and their jailer is revealed to be a robot claiming to run on \"Brainiac 2.0\" software. The robot heavily resembles both Brainiac's 1983 skeleton-esque incarnation and the robotic drones utilized by the post-2008 version of Brainiac. It has a collection of shrunken bottled planets, and travels in a ship resembling Brainiac's skullship. At the time it was not clear if this was the true Brainiac after ''Rebirth'' or yet another one of his drones.<ref>''Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps'' #8-9 (2016).</ref>\n\nThe machine's victory is short-lived, however, as it is revealed that [[Larfleeze]] was able to reprogram it to his side using an Orange Lantern ring, having rebooted its life systems after finding it inactive on his homeworld with its ship. Larfleeze is impressed that the machine was able to capture the Green Lanterns and Starro, and even more impressed with the machine's shrinking technology, and plans to hijack its technology to put together his own collection. He takes the ship and collection to his homeworld of Okaara. However, upon being informed that the Yellow and Green Lanterns are still fighting inside the bottle and trying to kill each other, Larfleeze's own greed for having everything gets the best of him and he ends up breaking the container. This frees the Lanterns, and somehow restores them to their normal size and strength, after which they immediately start rampaging inside the ship and trashing Brainiac/Larfleeze's collection. Hal, Kyle, John and Guy go on to lead the attack on the Orange Lantern Corps. With everyone fighting together, the Orange Lantern Corps are quickly overwhelmed. Larfleeze accuses the robot of playing him; when it responds that it simply did what he programmed it to do, Larfleeze destroys it in a rage.<ref>''Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps'' #10-12 (2016).</ref>\n\nThe Superman storyline \"New World\" later confirmed via a flashback cameo that the Post-''Crisis'', post-2008 version of Brainiac (the tall, muscular, green-skinned cybernetic alien scientist) still exists in the post-''Rebirth'' continuity, and has encountered Superman in the past. Thus, the robot that defeated Starro, the Green Lantern Corps, and the Yellow Lantern Corps before subsequently being dispatched by Larfleeze was, in fact, one of his drones.<ref>''Action Comics'' #978 (June 2017)</ref>\n\n====No Justice====\nBrainiac later arrived on Earth again and battled the Justice League, who proved no match for him and his ship, until Superman arrived. However, he did not come to destroy the Earth, but to deliver a warning: that there is a cosmic-level threat in the universe coming to Earth, one that the heroes of Earth are woefully ill-prepared for. Brainiac thinks he can defeat the threat, but it means teaming up with Superman and the Justice League and combining members of the League with some of the most dangerous supervillains in the DC Universe and sending them into battle against this extinction-level menace. Four teams outfitted with Brainiac's technology are formed (including among other members, Lex Luthor, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Sinestro), with Brainiac himself working directly alongside his nemesis, Superman.<ref>[http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2018/01/26/scott-snyder-joins-forces-with-james-tynion-iv-and-joshua-williamson Scott Snyder Joins Forces With James Tynion IV and Joshua Williamson.]</ref>\n\nThe ''No Justice'' miniseries begins with the Omega Titans, the aforementioned threat, attacking Colu, Brainiac's homeworld, which explains Brainiac's kidnapping of Earth's superheroes and supervillains. Brainiac claims to have developed a plan to defeat the Omega Titans and the superheroes only need to follow his orders to win, but [[Amanda Waller]] uses the hidden Protocol XI, which involves kidnapping the world's most dangerous psychics, to probe Brainiac's mind and find out what he knows. The strain of the psychic attack causes Brainiac's head to explode, apparently killing him.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Scott Snyder|Snyder, Scott]]|Title = Justice League: No Justice|Volume = 1|Issue = #1|Date = May 2018|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nIn Scott Snyder's ''Justice League'' run, in order to fill in the gap left by Black Manta and the Joker, Lex Luthor sets Professor Ivo to work reconstructing Brainiac, with the intention of him joining the Legion of Doom. Despite teaming up with them, Brainiac does have his own motivations, including planning his revenge against Waller.\n\n====Brainiac 6====\nHe is the gang version of Brainiac and first appears in ''[[Adventures of the Super Sons]]'' #1.<ref>{{cite web | last=Cardona | first=Ian | title=Adventures of the Super Sons Introduces the Li'l Legion of Doom | website=CBR | date=August 8, 2018 | url=https://www.cbr.com/super-sons-lil-legion-of-doom/ | access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBrainiac's most consistent power (endemic to all versions) is his \"twelfth-level intellect\", allowing calculation abilities, enhanced memory and advanced understanding of mechanical engineering, bio-engineering, [[physics]], and other theoretical and applied sciences, as well as extensive knowledge of various alien technologies.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=38-44}}</ref> For comparison, the population of 20th century Earth as a whole constitutes a sixth-level intelligence and the population of 31st century Earth as a whole is a ninth-level intelligence. His Post-''Crisis'' incarnation claims that his brain can process and sort the knowledge of over four hundred ninety octodecillion beings (490 \u00d7 10<sup>57</sup>),<ref name=\"Action Comics #868 October 2008\"/> which is an enormous number, about five billion times the estimated number of atoms of the Earth. The character has created devices such as a [[force shield|force field]] belt capable of withstanding Superman's most powerful blows,<ref name=\"action242\">''Action Comics'' #242 (July 1958)</ref> and a shrinking ray capable of reducing cities.<ref name=\"action242\"/>\n\nBrainiac's advanced mental powers have shown him capable of [[Spirit possession|possessing]] others, absorbing information from other beings, transferring his consciousness,<ref>''Action Comics'' #544-546 (June\u2013August 1983)</ref> creating and manipulating computer systems, replicating multiple versions of himself, and exerting powers to traverse or control space and time. Among organic beings, Brainiac views only his frequent partner Lex Luthor as a peer intellect. Brainiac is usually depicted with an incredibly high degree of super strength and durability; the exact level varies, but usually hovers at around Superman's strength. Brainiac's exact abilities vary drastically throughout his various incarnations.\n\n===Pre-''Crisis''===\nOriginally, Brainiac was a scientist with no superhuman abilities aside from his intellect. He fought Superman via the use of his advanced technology and cunning, similar to [[Lex Luthor]]. Among these were a forcefield belt which projected a shield that made him immune to all harm (even Superman's blows), a shrinking ray, and a headpiece consisting of a cluster of diode/electrode-like objects. His cybernetic headpiece lets him interface with technology and project energy blasts from his head, which were powerful enough to significantly harm Superman. Superman described the blasts as \"blindingly painful... almost unbearable\" and as a threat to his life.<ref>''Superman'' #338 (August 1979)</ref> The Pre-''Crisis'' Brainiac was referred to by an omniscient narrator as \"the super-computer space pirate-- Superman's most powerful nemesis.\"<ref>''Action Comics'' #443 (January 1975)</ref>\n\nBrainiac being unpowered and reliant on external weaponry was largely still the case even when he was [[retconned]] as an android, but in the 1980s, this changed and he gained the abilities that would stick to all subsequent incarnations: superstrength and durability, technopathy, and super longevity. His technopathic abilities extend to control of his ship, with which he shares a symbiotic relationship. The android version of Brainiac was capable of downloading his consciousness to spare, robotic bodies in the event that his original was destroyed or damaged. He could also possess organic beings in certain circumstances, as he did to Luthor during ''[[Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]''.\n\nThe final body utilized by the Pre-''Crisis'' Brainiac (resembling a robotic skeleton) was technopathic, had superstrength and durability, could discharge energy blasts capable of hurting Superman, and knew of how to \"spin\" the psychokinetic energies he generated into a web-like net which could hold Superman at bay. Among the knowledge he absorbed was extensive information on hand-to-hand combat techniques, making him a very skilled combatant. Despite this, he saw physical confrontation as beneath him, and preferred to defeat foes with his mind.<ref>''Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe'' #3</ref>\n\n===Post-''Crisis''===\n\n====Probes====\n[[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s re-imagining of the character possessed [[telepathy]] and [[telekinesis]], as well as the ability to discharge energy blasts. He was an alien consciousness who had possessed the body of a powerful human psychic and awakened his powers, further augmenting them with an implanted electrode head-piece. His vast psychic powers allowed him to seriously challenge Superman, and defeat multiple members of the [[New Gods]] (including [[Orion (comics)|Orion]]) with a single psionic energy blast,<ref>[http://i.imgur.com/FMTvCli.jpg ''Action Comics'']</ref> but the body's lack of Superman-level durability was a major liability and eventually led to it being rendered useless in a gasoline explosion. After this organic body was destroyed, Brainiac's consciousness built and possessed various robotic bodies and occasionally hijacked other organic bodies (such as Doomsday's). His abilities were dependent on the body he was inhabiting at the time, which could vary from as weak as a normal human to far stronger than Superman. His nanoswarm incarnation, for instance, could shapeshift, regenerate, project energy blasts and force fields, and match Superman blow for blow; Superman stated Brainiac to have physical strength on par with Doomsday's in this form.<ref>[https://i.imgur.com/4qiydhA.jpg ''Superman/Batman'' #36] (August 2007).</ref> His strongest incarnation was Brainiac 13, who, even prior to absorbing Imperiex, was so physically formidable that Superman could not remotely affect, much less damage, him. By contrast, Brainiac was easily able to kill Superman, and would have done so in a short time had he not been devoted to torturing the Man of Steel.<ref>''Action Comics'' #763 (March 2000)</ref>\n\n====True form====\nIt was later revealed that this version of Brainiac (like the previous ones) was merely a mentally-controlled probe of the real Brainiac, who was a living Coluan that had genetically and cybernetically enhanced himself. The true Brainiac lacked psychic powers, but still possessed super physical attributes, intelligence, and technopathy. He possesses a level of strength vastly surpassing that of a full-powered Superman; capable of easily overpowering the Kryptonian in a grapple and flooring him with a single punch, breaking his near-invulnerable skin by squeezing Superman's head with his fingers,<ref>''Action Comics'' #868 (October 2008)</ref> and catching one of Superman's punches and crushing his hand until it bled, forcing Superman to his knees.<ref name=\"Action Comics #870 December 2008\">''Action Comics'' #870 (December 2008)</ref> His durability is also far greater than Superman's, shown when he absorbs several consecutive blows to the face from the Man of Steel without visible harm and later claims that Superman's punches did not hurt him at all.<ref>''Superman: Last Stand Of New Krypton'' #3 (April 2010).</ref> Even a concentrated and sustained burst of heat vision directly to Brainiac's eyes did not seriously debilitate him, though it inflicted noticeable damage.<ref name=\"Action Comics #870 December 2008\"/> At one point [[Brainiac 5]] warns that Superman would most likely die against Brainiac in a straight fight.<ref name=\"Superman #699 June 2010\">''Superman'' #699 (June 2010)</ref> ''Superman Secret Files and Origins 2009'' further state that Brainiac is \"as strong and invulnerable as a Kryptonian.\"<ref>''Superman: Secret Files and Origins 2009'' (October 2009)</ref>\n\nDespite his enormous physical enhancements, Brainiac had several weaknesses. Like the Pre-''Crisis'' Brainiac, he is mentally connected to his ship in such a way that he can be disabled for a short period if separated without warning. Initially, he had the weakness of being disabled by his [[mysophobia]] and sensory overload when dumped into Earth's atmosphere,<ref name=\"Action Comics #870 December 2008\"/> though he does not seem to have this defect in his later battles on Earth, such as when he defeated [[Superboy]],<ref>''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #6 (March 2010).</ref> suggesting that he had fixed it, or that he is only overloaded in particularly dirty environments. Finally, being separated from his ship for prolonged periods causes him to physically deteriorate and become far less powerful, as Lex Luthor observed while studying his unconscious body over the course of several days when it was in the custody of the U.S. government.\n\nThis Brainiac is an incredibly powerful physical fighter, but like his Pre-''Crisis'' counterpart is most dangerous due to the advanced technology he wields, much of it of his own invention. These include his classic shrinking ray and force fields, as well as other gadgets such as missiles capable of causing stars to go [[supernova]].<ref>''Action Comics'' #867 (September 2008)</ref> His force fields are so impregnable that a direct hit from an energy weapon that kills several fully powered Kryptonians as collateral damage did not leave so much as a single scratch on his ship.<ref>''Superman: Last Stand of New Krypton'' #1 (May 2010)</ref> Brainiac also possesses an army of at least tens of thousands of humanoid robotic \"probes\". These probes are strong enough to draw blood from Superman<ref>''Action Comics'' #866 (August 2008)</ref> and tough enough to survive some of his powerful blows. During the New Krypton story arc, Brainiac upgraded his probes with red-sun ray guns for the purpose of fighting Kryptonians. When Brainiac orders these drones to attack New Krypton, they quickly kill over eleven thousand solar-powered Kryptonians.<ref name=\"Superman #699 June 2010\"/>\n\nHe is a biological creature that has altered his body to acquire more knowledge to become \"better\". With his ship, his vast knowledge, and his powerful technology, Brainiac has captured thousands of cities and has assimilated and destroyed just as many civilizations, making him the worst mass murderer in the history of the Milky Way<ref>''R.E.B.E.L.S.'' (vol. 2) #19 (August 2010)</ref> and one of the most feared beings in the known universe. He is considered one of the most powerful villains Superman has ever faced.\n\n===''The New 52''===\nBrainiac, in ''[[The New 52]]'', seems to have kept most of the powers and equipment of his Post-''Crisis'' incarnation (including his shrinking ray, force fields, and robot army), with notable additions. Brainiac's ship has been massively upgraded in this incarnation; it is now larger than the entire Earth & Moon planet system,<ref>Pak, Greg (w).

He still appears to possess the physical strength and near-invulnerability of his Post-''Crisis'' counterpart, as shown when he easily defeats the [[Zor-El|Cyborg Superman]].<ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 6) #24 (December 2013).</ref> By the ''[[Superman: Doomed]]'' story arc, Brainiac has used his twelfth-level intellect to become an enormously powerful psychic and telepath, augmented by the minds that he has stolen and digitized from across the galaxy, and capable of taking control of all seven billion minds on Earth at the same time. He also demonstrates considerable reality-warping abilities; he claims that the combined psionic power of all the minds he has captured throughout the universe can allow him to change reality to his will, and plans to use this power to remake the universe in his image. However, this plan is prematurely ended when Superman battles him telepathically and crashes his ship into a black hole.\n\nFollowing the ''Doomed'' story arc, it is further revealed that the Pre-''Crisis'' Brainiac somehow escaped the Crisis on Infinite Earths itself, and mutated from the various crises since, becoming a godly being. This version of Brainiac is nigh-omnipotent and [[omniscient]], with the ability to warp universes and time travel. Using this newfound power he either recreated or interacted with all the different iterations of himself throughout the multiverse, using his New 52 incarnation as yet another one of his many probes. He has grown so much in power that now he can collect cities from other universes at will. At the end of the ''Convergence'' story arc, Brainiac recreates the DC Multiverse.<ref>(27 May 2015). \"Decoding Convergence With Jeff King: The Finale\". ComicBook.com.

He first appears working with Luthor in 1978 to undermine Superman, eventually shrinking and bottling the city of Stalingrad. Superman defeats Brainiac soon after, but his inability to restore Stalingrad becomes his one failure and a recurring source of guilt. After his defeat, Superman has Brainiac reprogrammed in order to serve him and the Earth, and help run Superman's Global Soviet Union, a task he takes to for the next four decades. While serving Superman, Brainiac repeatedly advises him to take more drastic courses of action to resolve his problems, such as suggesting he merely invade Luthor's United States, though Superman always rebuffs his most extreme suggestions.\n\nAt the climax of the story, in 2001, Superman eventually does decide to attack the United States, and Luthor deploys a futuristic U.S. Pacific Fleet and an army of superbeings (including Wonder Woman and Doomsday) in an attempt to stop him. They are either incapacitated by Superman or cut to shreds by Brainiac's ship, and Luthor himself is yanked down deep into the recesses of the Fortress by Brainiac to be converted surgically into a Superman robot. Brainiac and Superman storm the White House after defeating all the U.S.'s defenders. They are greeted by Lois Luthor with the last weapon, a small note written by President Lex Luthor that reads, \"Why don't you just put the whole world in a bottle, Superman?\". Superman, realizing the error of his ways, is horrified by the revelation that he has essentially become another Brainiac- \"an alien bullying a less-developed species.\" He calls off the invasion, but Brainiac objects; he reveals that his twelfth-level intellect let him easily subvert any attempts at reprogramming him, and that he has never been under Superman's control. He attacks Superman with a kryptonite beam weapon, nearly killing him while boasting about how he will conquer the entire universe after finishing off all his foes on Earth. However, he is finally defeated when Luthor (having escaped surgery through undisclosed means) hacks and shuts off Brainiac from the inside. His body is promptly destroyed by Superman.\n\nIn one last act of spite, Brainiac's death automatically triggers his ship's self-destruct, which, according to Luthor, would eradicate the entire Earth and everything within a 15,000,000 mile radius. As the gravitational singularities powering Brainiac's ship threaten to explode, Superman rockets it into outer space, where it blows up. The Earth is saved, but Superman is thought to have been caught in an explosion and killed. In the epilogue at Lex Luthor's funeral a thousand years in the future, it is revealed that unbeknownst to the rest of the Earth, Superman survived the destruction of Brainiac's ship. He walks quietly away from the ceremony, planning to live among humans rather than ruling over them.\n\n===''JLA: Earth-2''===\nIn the ''[[JLA: Earth 2]]'' one-shot, the Justice League are drawn to the anti-matter universe to defeat the [[Crime Syndicate of America]], their villainous anti-matter counterparts, with Brainiac apparently acting as the robotic servant of Ultraman. However, after the Syndicate travel to the League's universe, it is revealed that the true mastermind of the scheme was Brainiac, who is revealed to be an organic life form trapped in a tank acting as Ultraman's servant, having manipulated both teams into a position where they will be trapped in each other's worlds and thus unable to win, as the nature of each world means that 'good' and 'evil' will always win in each world. However, Brainiac is defeated when the League deliberately walks away so that the Syndicate can return in time to stop him.\n\n===''Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again''===\nIn ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', set in a world where heroes have been publicly 'retired' for years as Lex Luthor took over and blackmailed assorted heroes into acting as his discreet 'servants', Brainiac is working with Luthor to keep the city of Kandor contained, the two destroying one Kryptonian family each time Superman defies them. He is eventually destroyed by Lara, the daughter of Superman and Wonder Woman, who claims to be surrendering to him only to allow [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|the Atom]] to break the bottle from inside and allow the Kryptonians within to access their powers, decimating Brainiac with their heat vision.<ref>''Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again'' #1-3 (November 2001-July 2002)</ref>\n\n===Bizarro Brainiac===\n[[Bizarro]] #1 created this doppelganger of Brainiac to live on Bizarro World. Since Brainiac shrunk the city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]], his Bizarro counterpart felt compelled to do the opposite, and expanded a city in [[Antarctica]], creating Big City.<ref>''Supergirl and the Legion of Super-Heroes'' #20 (September 2006)</ref>\n\n===''Flashpoint''===\nIn the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Brainiac is the ruler of 31st century Earth, and has captured [[Bart Allen|Kid Flash]], whom he then placed in stasis, but [[Speed Force|Hot Pursuit]] managed to rescue the young speedster.<ref>''Flashpoint: Kid Flash Lost'' #1 (June 2011)</ref> Escaping from Brainiac's base, Kid Flash and Hot Pursuit formulate a plan to return to the 21st century. Kid Flash then allows himself to be recaptured by Brainiac and put into stasis. Kid Flash uses his super-speed in the virtual reality access port to shut down the security program and Hot Pursuit then blasts Brainiac from behind. While they used his orb energy to return to the past, Brainiac impaled Hot Pursuit and attacked Kid Flash. Hot Pursuit breaks the orb energy projector to allow Kid Flash's super-speed to return. Kid Flash then returns to the 21st century, promising to rescue Hot Pursuit from Brainiac.<ref>''Flashpoint: Kid Flash Lost'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>\n\n===''Justice League/Power Rangers''===\nBrainiac is one of the villains in the ''Justice League/[[Power Rangers]]'' crossover, when the Power Rangers and [[Lord Zedd]] accidentally travel to the DC Universe through a teleportation accident, with the Rangers arriving in Gotham City,<ref>''Justice League/Power Rangers'' #1</ref> while Zedd finds himself in one of the trapped cities on Brainiac's ship. Escaping from the bottle, Zedd proposes an alliance with Brainiac in exchange for providing Brainiac with a city from his Earth, Zedd releasing a wave of monsters across the world to distract the Justice League.<ref>''Justice League/Power Rangers'' #2</ref> Using the distraction of Zedd's monsters, Brainiac dispatches his drones to take control of the Rangers' zords, stealing their powers and fleeing back to their world, forcing the Rangers and the Justice League to 'borrow' the [[Hadron Collider]] to create a temporary dimensional transporter that will allow them all to get back to the Rangers' world.<ref>''Justice League/Power Rangers'' #3</ref> Back in the Rangers' world, Brainiac nearly takes control of Cyborg, but [[Billy Cranston]] is able to regain his powers in time to take Cyborg down<ref>''Justice League/Power Rangers'' #4</ref> so that Batman can reboot him. Brainiac has captured Alpha 5, officially to question him as the only other example of independent artificial sentience he has ever met, but Alpha, although speculating that Brainiac abducted him because the villain is lonely, rejects the idea that the two are similar, arguing that Brainiac's actions show a selfishness and an inability to grow where true sentience relies on making oneself open to working with others. After regaining their powers, the Rangers are able to rescue Alpha and force Brainiac into retreat.<ref>''Justice League/Power Rangers'' #5</ref>\n\n===''Adventures of Supergirl''===\nIn the ''Adventures of Supergirl'' comic, which takes place in the universe of the ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' TV series, a very different version of Vril Dox appears as a recurring villain. In this series, he is a greedy, green-skinned alien hacker from the planet Yod who was hired by an as-yet-unknown individual to frame Supergirl's ally Winn Schott for funding and aiding terrorism. When Supergirl accesses Winn's computer, he presents himself falsely as an A.I. system called V.R.I.L., and pretends to be a creation of Schott's. He figures out Supergirl's real identity and plans to expose her, then he electrocutes her ally [[Jimmy Olsen|James Olsen]] from through Winn's computer. Eventually, Vril is tracked down by Supergirl with the aid of Winn and an expert hacker he knew, and Supergirl easily defeated him, after which he was arrested.<ref>''Adventures of Supergirl'' #2 (print) (or ''Adventures of Supergirl'' #4-5 (digital))</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n====Live-action====\n* [[James Marsters]] primarily played Brainiac in  ''[[Smallville]]'', while additional portrayals have also been done by [[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]] ([[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Jonathan Kent]] in season five), [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]] ([[Lionel Luthor]] in season seven), [[Laura Vandervoort]] (Kara Zor-El in season seven) and [[Allison Mack]] (Chloe Sullivan in season eight). Acting as a central antagonist for seasons five and seven and a supporting villain for season eight, Brainiac is mostly referred to by his assumed name of \"'''Milton Fine'''\", but [[Jor-El]] refers to him as the '''BRAIN InterActive Construct'''. The ''Smallville'' interpretation is similar to the [[DC animated universe]] version; a self-aware computer in humanoid form with a Kryptonian origin who had a part in the planet's destruction (having destabilized Krypton's core alongside Zod) but is portrayed as a [[shapeshifting]] AI created by [[Jax-Ur|Dax-Ur]] (who abandoned the project) and completed by Jor-El but corrupted by [[General Zod|Zod]]. Introduced in season five (though alluded in the season four finale where he was part of the Ship carrying the Disciples of Zod), he first appears under the Milton Fine name, posing as a history professor at (fictional) Central Kansas A&M University and presenting himself as a Kryptonian ally to trick [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] into releasing Zod. Proclaiming Jor-El was a murderer and the one who infected Mrs. Kent with a virus while Zod was the hero of all Krypton. But after Clark learns the truth, Brainiac fights off with his own Kryptonian-esque powers and then manipulates [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] into creating a 'vaccine' that will make Luthor's body suitable to act as Zod's new host after temporarily shutting down all of Earth's electronics with a virus. Although apparently destroyed, Brainiac is restored in season seven. The weakened humanoid manipulated Clark into helping regain his full power by locating Dax-Ur, to which he killed by downloading his creator's memories before convincing Luthor that Clark is a threat by impersonating [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]] and revealing Clark's secret identity to Luthor, but is defeated in battle by Clark and seemingly killed. However, Brainiac returns in season eight, possessing [[Chloe Sullivan]] to use as a means of unleashing [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] through [[Davis Bloome]] on Earth, as part of Zod's contingency plan. The [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] assist Clark in extracting Brainiac from Chloe and taking him to the future, but are too late to stop him from releasing Doomsday. A [[Brainiac 5|reprogrammed version]] of Brainiac returns in season ten from the future, offering Clark advice on his future growth as a superhero. \n** An alternate version of Brainiac/Milton Fine appears in the season seven episode \"Apocalypse\". Living in a universe, where Kal-El never arrived on Earth, Brainiac became [[Chief of Staff]], under President Lex Luthor (whom he secretly prepared to become the vessel for Zod) and alongside Kara Zor-El (under the name \"Agent Danvers\"). When the appearance of Kal-El from another universe exposed Brainiac to those around him, Lex shot him and Kara and activated a [[Nuclear football]] to destroy most of the planet to remake it. With his directives of destroying humanity and with Lex becoming the vessel for Zod, Brainiac was about to kill Clark, when Jor-El brought Clark back to his native reality.\n\n* In ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', there is a villainess called [[Brainiac 8|Indigo]], who comes from the planet [[Colu]], debuting in episode \"Solitude\". While the original Brainiac does not appear in the series, his name is mentioned, as stated that she is \"a member of the Brainiac clan\" implying a possible existence of Superman's enemy in the show. Also, another Coluan named [[Brainiac 5]] is a member of a superhero team from the 31st century called the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. In the episode, \"Battles Lost and Won\", Brainiac 5 reveals that, in preventing the Blight from spreading its virus in the future, it has restored the original Brainiac in the future, who now seeks to destroy all AIs, forcing Brainiac 5 to remain in the 21st Century while [[Mon-El]] and Winn Schott return to the future to battle Brainiac. \n\n* Brainiac appears as the main antagonist of the first season and supporting antagonist of ''[[Krypton (TV series)|Krypton]]'', portrayed by [[Blake Ritson]] (as well as Krypton's religious figure the \"Voice of Rao\", which Brainiac corrupted). <ref name=\"November2017Casting\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1721259/syfys-krypton-just-cast-classic-superman-villain-brainiac-and-more|title=Syfy's ''Krypton'' Just Cast Classic Superman Villain Brainiac And More|date=November 19, 2017|first=Nick|last=Venable|website=Cinema Blend|accessdate=May 5, 2018}}</ref> Throughout Season 1, Brainiac, known by the Kryptonians as the \"Collector of Worlds\", finds Krypton and seeks to destroy it thus ensuring Superman never exist. This resulted in his grandfather [[Seg-El]] and a resistance to fight against Brainiac along with the appearance of a time-displaced General Dru-Zod and the result of an exiled Val-El. After Seg and others failed to ensure Kandor and Krypton's survival, Zod makes a bargain with him to hand over Val-El whose use of the Phantom Zone is able to glimpse the future. As Brainiac and Dru-Zod enter Val-El's secret lab, Brainiac approaches Val to demonstrate that \"Val\" was actually a hologram by waving his hand through him, indicating that he was not tricked. To do so however, he had to step onto the portal to the Phantom Zone, which Seg-El then triggered, banishing Brainiac into the Phantom Zone and saving all of Krypton, though Seg himself is drawn into the portal with Brainiac which results in Seg hearing Brainiac in his mind. The character, sporting a look similar to his post-2008 incarnation, was created via a combination of extensive makeup/prosthetics (which took four to seven hours to apply) and CGI.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/02/21/heres-your-first-look-superman-villain-brainiac-syfy-prequel-series-krypton/357351002/ Here's your first look at Superman villain Brainiac on the Syfy prequel series 'Krypton'.] USA News.</ref>\n\n====Animation====\n* Brainiac made his first television appearance in six episodes of the [[Filmation]] [[animated series]] ''[[The New Adventures of Superman (TV series)|The New Adventures of Superman]]'', voiced by Cliff Owens. In this series, Brainiac was from the planet Mega whose entire population had perished in a series of atomic wars with the exception of one survivor, Professor Hecla. Hecla created Brainiac and sent him to Earth to use his shrinking ray to create a sort of \"cosmic [[Noah's Ark]]\", by shrinking a male and female of each Earth species to take back to repopulate Mega. Brainiac appeared in several episodes of this series, which began in 1966.\n\n* Brainiac would resurface as a member of the [[Legion of Doom]] in ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'' [[cartoon]] voiced by [[Ted Cassidy]].\n** Brainiac also appeared in a ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'' short episode \"Superclones\". He ended up making clones of [[Aquaman]] and [[El Dorado (Super Friends)|El Dorado]]. He was voiced by [[Stanley Ralph Ross]], who took over for the late Cassidy in 1980.\n** The mechanical version of Brainiac appeared in ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' in the episodes \"The Wrath of Brainiac\" and \"The Village of Lost Souls\" again voiced by [[Stanley Ralph Ross]]. In \"The Wrath of Brainiac\", Brainiac reveals that he shed his earlier appearance when he worked alongside Darkseid.\n** Brainiac next appeared in ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' episode called \"Brain Child\", once again voiced by [[Stanley Ralph Ross]].\n\n* Brainiac appears in the DC Animated Universe, voiced primarily by [[Corey Burton]].[[File:Brainiac(STAS).jpg|thumb|upright|Brainiac as depicted in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''.]]\n** In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Brainiac is first depicted as the supercomputer that runs most of the day-to-day operations on the planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. He heeds [[Jor-El]]'s warning about Krypton's imminent destruction. But rather than validate Jor-El's claims, he dismisses them as false while secretly working to save himself. As he contains Krypton's collective knowledge, Brainiac reasons that should he inform the government, they would put him to work to stop the inevitable and ultimately doom both parties. Brainiac survives Krypton's destruction after downloading his programming into a satellite and creating an android body for himself. He then traveled to other planets and assimilated their information before destroying them, claiming that the fewer beings who possess the knowledge, the more precious it becomes. In \"Stolen Memories\", Brainiac makes his way to Earth under the pretense of a peaceful exchange of knowledge with [[Lex Luthor]]. Superman, however, discovers Brainiac's true intentions to betray Luthor and destroy Earth, and eventually seemingly kills Brainiac by destroying his ship. In \"Ghost in the Machine\", it is revealed that Brainiac downloaded his programming into [[LexCorp]]'s computers during his last encounter with Superman. He then forces Luthor to build him a new android body. When Superman arrives to save Luthor, Brainiac is ultimately defeated when the Man of Steel magnetises his body so that the attracted metal would overwhelm him. In \"Knight Time\", Brainiac used nanites to control Bruce Wayne, having Bruce use [[Wayne Enterprises]]' technology to construct a ship that can leave Earth. However, Brainiac's plan was once again foiled after Superman destroyed both Brainiac and his ship. In \"New Kids in Town\", a futuristic era version of Brainiac traveled back to the past from the year 2979 to kill a teenage version of Clark Kent before the youth's future. But due to the efforts of [[Cosmic Boy]], [[Chameleon Boy]] and [[Saturn Girl]], Clark defeated Brainiac and teleported him into the Sun, incinerating the supercomputer.\n** Brainiac returns in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series. In the episode \"Twilight\", he and [[Darkseid]] harass Superman. He first appears attacking after [[Apokolips]] had suffered a major defeat by New Genesis, prompting Darkseid to head to ask the [[Justice League]] for help. The story was a ruse, however, one intended to lure the League, Superman in particular, to Brainiac's headquarters. Brainiac's full plan was to extract Superman's DNA so that he could create a mighty organic body for himself, however, Darkseid betrayed Brainiac. During the subsequent battle, [[Batman]]'s attempts lead to both the artificial intelligence and the Lord of Apokolips being destroyed.\n** Brainiac also appears in ''[[Static Shock]]''. In the [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] episode \"A League of Their Own\", Brainiac is reduced to a single circuit board kept in stasis but escaped confinement following a [[power failure]] at the Justice League's [[Justice League Watchtower|Watchtower]]. [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] and Gear had been recruited by the League to help recharge the Watchtower's generators. During that time, Brainiac slowly began gaining control of the Watchtower. He sent the League a fake distress call to lure them away, then attempted to dispose of Static and Gear before turning the Watchtower into his new body. The two teen superheroes discovered his plan and alerted the League to return. Brainiac had managed to download his mind into Gear's Backpack, taking control of [[Rick Stone (comics)|Richie Foley]] (voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]) to once more recreate his body and his mission. Static and the Justice League were able to fry Brainiac's hardware temporarily, allowing Richie to be freed and for Brainiac's base to self-destruct. Brainiac's voice here sounds quite different; the producers of ''Static Shock'' decided to pitch Corey Burton's voice significantly lower for their show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jl.toonzone.net/brainiac/brainiac.htm |title=Brainiac |publisher=Jl.toonzone.net |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}</ref> [[File:Lexiac.jpg|thumb|upright|Brainiac combined with [[Lex Luthor]] as seen in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]\n** Brainiac also appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. The android is briefly seen in the animated adaptation of \"For The Man Who Has Everything\" as a household robot (voiced by [[Mike Farrell]]). The season one finale revealed a major plot twist where a nanotech piece of Brainiac had been integrated with Lex Luthor (call-back to the Superman episode \"Ghost in the Machine\"), subtly influencing Luthor's decisions, curing his host's kryptonite cancer and giving him superhuman strength. He intended to put his mind into Luthor's duplicate of [[A.M.A.Z.O.]] made from [[Project Cadmus|Cadmus]] [[nanotechnology]], revealing himself only after being thwarted by [[Amanda Waller]] and the seven founding Justice League members. Brainiac tries to digitize the League, but the [[Martian Manhunter]] escapes and stops this. As the two escape, Brainiac's goal to record all knowledge in the universe and destroy all of creation is undermined by Luthor, pointing out his lack of imagination. Lex offers to show him a purpose beyond the mere fulfillment of his programming, to remake the universe to their preferences. Using alien nanotechnology, Brainiac turns into an exosuit that merges with Luthor; the fused character's appearance (also voiced by [[Clancy Brown]]) is inspired by the Silver Age Brainiac. He also creates duplicates modeled after the [[Justice Lords]] to distract the League. Though he defeats the League, the two are taken down when the [[Wally West|Flash]] then taps into the [[Speed Force]] and purges Brainiac from Luthor's body, leaving nothing left. However, the final season reveals Brainiac's consciousness survives and is able to communicate with Luthor as a sort of [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]]; it is never made clear if the hallucination is actually Brainiac or merely a figment of Lex's imagination. Obsessed with regaining their lost \"godhood\", Luthor joins the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] in order to obtain a piece of Brainiac in [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s possession, subsequently usurping Grodd's place as the Secret Society's leader, and even sacrifices various Secret Society supervillains during an internal showdown, all to bring Brainiac's fragment back online. Returning to the task of resurrecting Brainiac, Luthor hooks [[Tala (comics)|Tala]] up to a machine to gather Brainiac's essence from the remains of Brainiac's ship with Darkseid, killing Tala in the process, but ends up reviving Darkseid fused with Brainiac technology, and Brainiac's presence is removed from Luthor's mind.\n\n*Brainiac 1.0 appears in the second season of ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'', voiced again by [[Corey Burton]]. [[Brainiac 5]] is a descendant of him who is an unwanted robot on his home planet. In the second-season episode \"Message in a Bottle\", Brainiac 5 reveals the past atrocities caused by his predecessor, one such atrocity being the shrinking and abduction of the Kryptonian city of Kandor; in this version, Kandor was also the location of a device that kept Krypton's planet core stable, and thus by abducting the city, Brainiac ensured the demise of Krypton. In the two-part finale of the series \"Dark Victory\", Brainiac 1.0's programming takes control of Brainiac 5. He turns against his team, destroys [[Imperiex]], and has a grand plan to bring order to the universe. To do this, he uses forbidden Coluan technology that transforms matter, living beings, and entire worlds into digital information to be stored inside his database. With help from Superman and Kell-El merged inside his mind, he is ultimately destroyed by Brainiac 5, but in the end, he survives and starts rebuilding himself as Brainiac 6. While the ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' television series does not share the same continuity as the [[DC Animated Universe]], this version of Brainiac is also voiced by Corey Burton and shares the same musical [[leitmotif]] from his DCAU appearances.\n\n* Brainiac is featured in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Richard McGonagle]]. Brainiac's earliest outfit (albeit with slight modification) as a Coluan is seen in the episode \"The Siege of Starro!\" Pt. 2 as a trophy in the spaceship of the [[Faceless Hunters|Faceless Hunter]] (the minion/herald of [[Starro]]). In \"Battle of the Superheroes!\", Brainiac shows up at the end of the episode, following Lex Luthor's defeat, plotting to shrink Metropolis in order to repopulate his destroyed planet, causing Batman and Superman to spring into action.\n\n* Brainiac makes a cameo appearance in the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' animated series. In the episode \"Laundry Day\", [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] heads to his room to get a new body while the current one is in the wash; Brainiac's body is one of the choices, but Cyborg dismisses it, saying that it is \"too brainy\".\n\n* In ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'' episode \"SuperRabbit\", [[Marvin the Martian]] portrays Brainiac.\n\n* Brainiac appears in ''[[Justice League Action]]'', voiced by [[John de Lancie]].<ref>{{cite tweet|user=johndelancie|author=John de Lancie|number=783185537574199296|date=4 October 2016|title=@DaChangeling Yes that is true.}}</ref> He is mostly similar to the early Silver Age version of the character, being an alien scientist who shrinks and bottles cities for his collection; he also wears an outfit similar to his post-2008 counterpart, though he lacks other aspects of that version such as stoicism and superhuman strength/durability. Unique to JLA, this version is shown to have a wider top part of his head. In \"Plastic Man Saves The World\", Brainiac attempted to take Metropolis to add to his collection, adapting his drones to the Justice League's attacks. However, he failed to consider Plastic Man being able to sneak aboard his ship multiple times and destroy his ship before it could fire its shrinking ray. After the ray was destroyed, Brainiac updated his data banks to make Plastic Man a higher-level threat to him and swore vengeance. In \"Battle for the Bottled City\", Brainiac returned in a hover tank, roving around the Fortress of Solitude to regain the bottle city of Kandor. As Superman traveled inside the bottle city, Atom and Cyborg were left to protect the Fortress, which Brainiac easily infiltrates. He incapacitated Cyborg, destroyed several [[Superman robots]], and seemingly kills the Atom, but Atom revealed that he merely shrank and commandeered one of the remaining Superman robots, using it to pick up and toss Brainiac's tank. Though Brainiac defeated the Atom, their battle uncorked the bottle of Kandor, allowing Superman (still small-sized) to beat up Brainiac and defeat him once again.\n\n===Film===\n\n====Live action====\n* During the early development of ''[[Superman III]]'', [[Ilya Salkind]] wrote a script in that Brainiac was featured as the main antagonist.<ref>{{cite web| title=s3_original_idea.pdf| format=PDF| date=| url= http://meatfighter.com/superman3/part4/s3_original_idea.pdf |accessdate=2012-05-05}}</ref> However, when [[Leslie Newman]] and [[David Newman (screenwriter)|David Newman]] rewrote the script, Brainiac was cut from the film.

Most notably, the villain was featured with Doomsday in [[Kevin Smith]]'s version of the script, which was later discarded by director [[Tim Burton]]. Burton's own script included Brainiac's intellect bonding with Lex Luthor, as would later happen in ''Justice League Unlimited'' (and which had previously been seen in the comic book story ''[[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]'')<ref>{{Cite book | last=Hughes | first=David | title=The Greatest Sci-Fi Films Never Made | publisher=Titan Books | isbn=1-84023-428-8 | pages=176\u2013179 | chapter=The Death of Superman Lives | year=2002}}</ref>\n* In 2007, film director [[Bryan Singer]] reported that he wanted to use Brainiac, along with [[Bizarro (comics)|Bizarro]], as an antagonist in the cancelled ''[[Superman Returns#Unproduced sequel|Superman: The Man of Steel]]'', the planned sequel to ''[[Superman Returns]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=by Steve 'Frosty' Weintraub |url=http://collider.com/bryan-singer-exclusive-video-interviews-at-the-2007-saturn-awards/ |title=Bryan Singer \u2013 Exclusive Video Interviews at the 2007 Saturn Awards |publisher=Collider |date=2007-05-11 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}</ref> However, the project was finally scrapped by [[Warner Bros.]]\n* Brainiac has been suggested as \"definitely down the road\" as a villain in the [[DC Extended Universe]] and future ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' sequels by director [[Zack Snyder]].

The movie begins with Brainiac landing on Earth in a [[meteor]]. Brainiac goes around absorbing information until Superman destroys him with his Arctic-breath. However, Lex Luthor is able to save a piece of Brainiac and forms an alliance with the Kryptonian robot. Luthor gives Brainiac a new body, made from his satellite weapon. Brainiac is also equipped with a kryptonite beam and the ability to track Superman by his Kryptonian [[DNA]]. Luthor and Brainiac's bargain revolves around Brainiac using his new body to destroy Superman, and afterwards, Brainiac would allow himself to be \"defeated\" by Luthor and leave for another planet so that Luthor would appear as a hero. However, Brainiac betrayed Luthor after he believed Superman was destroyed, but in the end, Superman returned to defeat Brainiac after a lengthy battle. This time, Superman made sure that this copy of Brainiac was completely destroyed.\n* Brainiac appears as the main antagonist in the animated film ''[[Superman: Unbound]]'', based on the story arc [[Brainiac (story arc)|''Superman: Brainiac'']] by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank. Brainiac is voiced by [[John Noble]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Molly-Quinn-Supergirl-1050007.aspx |title=Castle's Molly Quinn Gets Animated as Supergirl |work=TV Guide |date=July 16, 2012 |accessdate=July 20, 2012}}</ref> Originally a scientist on his home world of Colu, Vril Dox became obsessed with learning everything there was to know in the universe. He subjected himself to extensive genetic and cybernetic enhancements, transforming his Coluan body into the towering cyborg the universe would come to know as Brainiac. He constructed a ship, designed to interface with his cybernetic implants and become an extension of his own body and will, and began to travel through space, absorbing information on other planets and civilizations. A flaw in his cybernetic brain made Brainiac incapable of accepting that, since living planets were always changing and civilizations evolving, learning everything was impossible. To remedy this, Brainiac created an army of robotic soldiers he would use to attack cities on inhabited planets, killing anyone they deemed redundant, before using a special force field projector to shrink the cities down to the size of a model he would keep stored on his ship. After capturing a city from a planet, Brainiac would launch a missile he called a Solar Aggressor into the planet's sun, causing it to go supernova and consume the rest of the planet, preventing any new data from ever entering the universe. To prevent his prisoners from trying to escape, Brainiac used his robots to maintain the cities and quell any signs of rebellion. After capturing the city of Kandor on the planet Krypton, Brainiac detected activity in the planet's core that showed the world was about to explode on its own, and thus saved himself the trouble of using a Solar Aggressor. This would ultimately prove to be his undoing.\n* Brainiac makes a cameo appearance in the animated film ''[[Lego Batman: The Movie - DC Super Heroes Unite]]'', an adaptation of the video game of the [[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes|same name]], with Troy Baker reprising his role.\n* Brainiac appears in ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Cosmic Clash]]'', voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]. This version miniaturizes, bottles and collects entire planets, rather than cities. He plans to do so to Earth in order to complete his collection. He uses a weapon to scatter Superman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern throughout time to support his plans. Although Batman and Flash succeed in sending their fellow Justice Leaguers to the present and Cyborg and Supergirl manage to slow down Brainiac's forces, Brainiac succeeds in shrinking and bottling Earth. However, the League use a massive mech to release Earth and restore it to its normal size. Feeling he has no purpose, Brainiac sets himself to self-destruct. Due to the large blast radius, Batman convinces Brainiac to collect coins to avoid Brainiac from detonating. Brainiac is then arrested and put in prison.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/nycc-lego-heroes-return-in-justice-league-cosmic-clash |title=NYCC: LEGO Heroes Return in \"Justice League: Cosmic Clash\" |publisher=Comicbookresources.com |date=October 11, 2015 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}</ref>\n* Brainiac appears as the final villain in ''[[DC Super Hero Girls: Intergalactic Games]]'', voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. He appears as the mastermind behind [[Lena Luthor]]. After she fails to kill the heroes, Brainiac leave her to drown and use the robots (including Platinum, one of the [[Metal Men]]) she used to build himself a giant body with all weapons needed to counter the superheroes' powers. His robotic body is destroyed with the combined efforts of the heroes through Platinum, who sacrifices herself to destroy him. However at the end, he is still alive and takes off to places unknown.\n* Brainiac appears as the main antagonist of the animated film ''[[Superman: Red Son (film)|Superman: Red Son]]'', based on the graphic novel of the same name. Brainiac is voiced by [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]].\n\n===Video games===\n* Brainiac served as the final boss in the ''[[Superman (arcade game)|Superman]]'' arcade game published by [[Taito Corporation]] in 1988.\n* Brainiac was the final boss in the 1992 Sunsoft game ''[[Superman (Sunsoft game)|Superman]]''.\n* In ''[[Superman 64]]'', Brainiac from the [[DCAU]] appears not only as a level boss, but also as a playable character in multiplayer. However, when the player faces Brainiac in the game's final level, Brainiac simply stands in place unless the player attempts to use heat vision on him.\n* Superman was forced to stop Brainiac and save the world after Brainiac kidnapped [[Lois Lane]] in the [[Sega Master System]] and [[Sega Genesis]] video game ''Superman: Man of Steel''.\n* In the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] video game ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel (2002 video game)|Superman: Man of Steel]]'', Brainiac 13 is the game's final boss. Players must compete against B13 drones throughout the game, before facing the android on the final level.\n* Brainiac was featured in the concept art in the console versions and as a main boss in the Nintendo DS version of  ''[[Superman Returns (video game)|Superman Returns]]'', looking vastly different from other incarnations.\n* Brainiac is a featured in the video game ''[[Justice League Heroes]]'' voiced by [[Peter Jessop]]. In the game, Brainiac first invaded [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] and ordered a huge legion of robots to seal off the area. Batman and Superman head for S.T.A.R. Labs, destroy Brainiac's robots, and battle Brainiac. Later the League infiltrates his underground fortress on earth and engages Brainiac in combat. Brainiac, defeated, is later resurrected/possessed by the villain [[Darkseid]].\n* [[Corey Burton]] reprises his role as Brainiac in ''[[DC Universe Online]]''. Here, Brainiac returns to Earth and both superheroes and other supervillains of the DC universe appeal to a truce to combat Brainiac. He is also (indirectly) the source of the player characters' powers, as a future version of Lex Luthor used his technology to create \"exobytes\", highly advanced [[nanorobots]] with the ability to infuse an organic host with superpowers. Brainiac also appears to be able to create Avatars and Sub-Avatars from the digitized information on superhuman powers, enormous robots that use technological, meta- or magical abilities.\n* In the video game ''[[Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure]]'', Brainiac is the secret leader of the supervillains and the main antagonist. With the help of the Scribblenauts' Doppelg\u00e4nger, he wants to use the Starites and Lily's globe to summon and merge with the other 51 Brainiacs and become a \"perfect\" being. He unites with other DC Comics villains to obtain the Starites, each failing to do so. When the Justice League arrives, he hacks Cyborg and uses [[Lex Luthor]], the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], [[Harley Quinn]], the [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]], [[Professor Zoom]], the [[Ocean Master]] and the [[Sinestro Corps]] to fight their respective nemeses, again, each failing. When the Justice League reach Brainiac, he steals Lily's globe, adds the last Starite, teleports the Justice League away and puts his plan into action. After betraying Doppelganger, Brainiac and his clones begin to merge. Maxwell manages to summon alternate versions of the Justice League to defeat him and retrieve the globe.\n\n====''Injustice'' series====\n* Brainiac makes a cameo appearance in the IOS/Android versions of ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' as a support card.\n* Brainiac appears as the central antagonist and a playable character in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', voiced by [[Jeffrey Combs]].<ref name=Brainiac>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/injustice_2/b/playstation4/archive/2017/01/17/latest-trailer-reveals-brainiac-robin-and-darkseid.aspx|date=2017-01-17|accessdate=2017-01-17|last=Vazquez|first=Suriel|work=[[Game Informer]]|title=Injustice 2: Latest Trailer Reveals Brainiac, Robin, And Darkseid}}</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/jeffreycombs/status/855197894730756099]</ref> This version of Brainiac has destroyed billions of populated worlds, including Krypton\u2014a departure from most versions, where he merely collects Kandor and moves on, leaving the planet to die a natural death. Before destroying Krypton, he manages to add both Kandor and Argo City to his collection (as revealed in Supergirl's ending). Alerted to Earth and the existence of Superman, whom he believes is the last Kryptonian, after Superman's Regime kills many members of the Green Lantern Corps, Brainiac arrives on Earth to collect its cities, putting him in conflict with both the Regime and Batman's Insurgency. He conspires with Gorilla Grodd and the Society, who assist Brainiac in his invasion, though once it becomes apparent that Brainiac plans to destroy Earth the Society disbands. Gorilla Grodd continues to serve Brainiac, plotting to overthrow and kill Brainiac and take control of his ship, but is killed by [[Aquaman]] and [[Black Adam]] during the invasion of Kahndaq before he can do so. He is surprised to learn that [[Kara Zor-El]] survived the attack on Krypton alongside her cousin\u2014her ship was knocked off course and she was put into suspended animation, to later be found by Black Adam and taken in by the surviving remnants of the Regime\u2014and seeks to add her to his collection as well. The superheroes and supervillains of the Insurgency and Regime are all forced to band together in order to have a chance at stopping him. After Superman defeats Batman and the Insurgency and restores the Regime's rule over Earth, he kills Brainiac, and frees all of the warriors trapped in Brainiac's collection, giving him an army of billions of Kryptonian, Daxamite, and Czarnian soldiers to use to maintain his control over Earth. Superman also bonds with Brainiac's ship, and uses its technology to turn Batman into a mindless slave. Superman then confronts an imprisoned Supergirl, and, to her horror, threatens to do the same thing to her if she does not join the Regime. In Brainiac's own ending, the version that defeated Brainiac will turn out to be his [[Brainiac 5|descendant]]. The other characters' endings will either have Brainiac killed or handed over to the authorities. The ''Injustice'' version of Brainiac is mostly based on the post-2008 version of the character, being a genetically and cybernetically enhanced Coluan scientist with a twelfth-level intellect, his signature skull ship, an army of robotic probes, a fleet of mentally-controlled smaller ships, and the strength/durability to physically match Superman. In addition to Brainiac 5, Brainiac 6 is referenced in his pre-battle dialogue if Brainiac fights Brainiac, with one of them revealing he is the other's descendant and the other challenging him to prove his worth as an heir.\n\n====''Lego'' series====\n* Brainiac makes an appearance in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Troy Baker]]. He is seen briefly in the final scene of the main story watching Earth from an orbiting spaceship, and after witnessing [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] shoot a green beam summoning others to the planet, Brainiac mutters \"I have located it.\" Brainiac is also a boss fight and unlockable character, found in Gotham Park.\n* Brainiac appears in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'' as the main antagonist, now voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. He summons representatives of all known Lantern Corps (such as [[Sinestro]], [[Atrocitus]], [[Carol Ferris|Star Sapphire]], and [[Hal Jordan]]) in order to claim their energies, which will power a crystal that will shrink Earth. According to him, he has lost his appetite for simple cities and plans to claim entire worlds. The Justice League and the [[Legion of Doom]] defeat him on his ship, but the villain escapes as his ship crashes in Gotham. Brainiac returns once Earth is returned to normal size, mind-controlling a giant-sized Superman, but is eventually defeated and shrunk himself, placed next to Lex Luthor and the Joker in [[Arkham Asylum]]. However, Luthor inadvertently breaks the bottle holding him, freeing him once again, after which Brainiac, as shown with a clenched fist, prepares to vengefully attack them.\n* Dee Bradley Baker reprises his role for a brief cameo in ''[[Lego Dimensions]]''. Brainiac is summoned to [[Middle-Earth]] by the [[Riddler]] to battle the heroes with mind-controlled Orcs.\n<!--* Brainiac will appear as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]''.-->\n* Brainiac appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', with Corey Burton reprising his role from the [[DC Animated Universe]]. When [[Gorilla Grodd]], [[Killer Frost]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], and the Rookie travel to [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], they look for something to get into [[Outer space|space]] suggesting Brainiac's ship. Brainiac's unlocked by collecting his token in the final level, \"[[Darkseid]] of the Moon.\"\n\n===Web series===\nBrainiac appears in the second episode of ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters Chronicles]]'' (a companion to ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]''), voiced by [[Tara Strong]]. This version is depicted as a contingency plan set by [[Doctor Sivana]] to take down [[Chris Kent (comics)|Superman]]. Brainiac is shown to have lost control over his immeasurable psychic powers, creating an energy dome around himself in Metropolis. The effects are shown to take down attack helicopters and send cars flying. As stated by his creator, only a small nuclear warhead could stop him, or Superman. Superman shows up and penetrates the dome, seeing Brainiac for who he is: a crying, blue-skinned child with three diodes on his head, missing his left arm. Despite his attempts to reason with him and talk Brainiac into controlling his powers, Superman reluctantly kills Brainiac with his heat vision to put him out of his misery, much to his regret.\n\n===Books===\n* Brainiac appears in ''The Last Days of Krypton'', a novel by [[Kevin J. Anderson]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> This version of Brainiac is known as the Brain InterActive Construct, later renamed Brainiac by Commissioner Zod. Brainiac had admired the beauty and architecture of Kandor, and wanted to preserve the city from destruction should disaster strike [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] as it did on his home planet of Colu. Zod permitted Brainiac's taking of Kandor, stating that Brainiac could have the city, as the rest of Krypton belonged to him. Brainiac's ship fired three lasers that pummeled the surrounding crust around Kandor and literally upheaved the city from Krypton's surface. A [[force shield|force field]] was then erected around the city which contracted, shrinking the city and its inhabitants. Brainiac departed without causing further destruction or seizing other Kryptonian cities.\n* Brainiac (referred to again as \"The Collector of Worlds\") is introduced in issue #20 of the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' comic series, based off the show.<ref>''Young Justice'' (vol. 2) #20 (November 2012)</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{DCDP|Brainiac}}\n* {{Dcauw|Brainiac}}\n\n{{Superman characters}}\n{{Justice League}}\n{{Supergirl}}\n{{Superfriends series}}\n{{Legion of Super-Heroes}}\n{{Justice League characters}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brainiac (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Animated series villains]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1958]]\n[[Category:DC Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:DC Comics robots]]\n[[Category:DC Comics telepaths]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional androids]]\n[[Category:Fictional artificial intelligences]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can duplicate themselves]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with spirit possession or body swapping abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional computers]]\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional robots]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Fictional shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Fictional technopaths]]\n[[Category:Kryptonians]]\n[[Category:Robot supervillains]]\n[[Category:Robots in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional amorphous creatures]]\n[[Category:Fictional professors]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Otto Binder]]\n[[Category:Fictional cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the DC Comics villain|the other DC Comics characters|Vril Dox|and|Brainiac 5|and|Brainiac 8|other things called Brainiac|Brainiac (disambiguation){{!}}Brainiac}}\n{{short description|Recurring antagonist of DC Comics}}\n\n{{Infobox comics character <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| character_name = Brainiac\n| image = Brainiac (DC Comics).png\n| imagesize =201\n| converted = y\n| caption =Brainiac in ''Superman: Secret Files and Origins 2009''<br/>(October 2009).

Brainiac is Superman's second-deadliest [[archenemy]] after [[Lex Luthor]], and also a frequent enemy of the  [[Justice League]].\n\nBrainiac is typically depicted as an [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] [[cyborg]] or [[Android (robot)|android]]. He is responsible for shrinking and stealing [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]], the [[capital city]] of Superman's home planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. In some continuities, he is also responsible for Krypton's destruction. Due to multiple revisions of DC's [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], several variations of Brainiac have appeared. Most incarnations of Brainiac depict him as a green-skinned being in [[humanoid]] form. He is bald, with a set of linked electrode-like objects (sometimes glowing) protruding from his skull.\n\nHis name is a portmanteau of the words ''brain'' and ''maniac''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.word-detective.com/2007/07/brainiac/ | title=Brainiac | work=The Word Detective | date=July 31, 2007}}</ref> In 2009, Brainiac was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 17th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/17.html | title=Top 100 Comic Book Villains | work=[[IGN]]}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nBrainiac first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #242 (July 1958), and was created by [[Otto Binder]] and [[Al Plastino]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=55}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Silver Age===\n[[File:Action Comics 242.png|thumb|upright|Brainiac's first appearance in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #242 (July 1958); art by [[Curt Swan]] and Stan Kaye]]\nFirst appearing in ''Action Comics'' #242 (July 1958), Brainiac is a bald, green-skinned [[humanoid]] who arrives on [[Earth]] and shrinks various cities, including [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], storing them in bottles with the intent of using them to restore the then-unnamed planet he ruled. He was originally notable only for having shrunk the bottle city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] with his shrinking ray and for using a force field.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleisher |first1=Michael L. |title=The Original Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume Three: Superman |date=2007 |publisher=DC Comics |isbn=1-4012-1389-8 |pages=29-35}}</ref>\n\nIn subsequent appearances in this early period, Brainiac was used mostly as a plot device rather than as a featured villain of the month. Brainiac's next appearance was mostly behind the scenes, when he tried to kill [[Lois Lane]] and [[Lana Lang]], prompting Superman to give Lois and Lana superpowers. But the villain remained unseen except as a plot twist at the end of the story. Brainiac's next appearance was in \"Superman's Return to Krypton\" in ''Superman'' #141 (November 1960), in which the villain stole the bottle city of Kandor, the only city on Krypton that believes Jor-El's warning of doom for the planet, and which had already built a space ark within the city to save the population. Brainiac's next present-day appearance was in ''Action Comics'' #275 (April 1961), which showed the villain planning to defeat Superman by exposing him to both red and green [[kryptonite]], giving Superman a third eye on the back of his head, forcing him to wear various hats to hide it. Superman soon defeated Brainiac and sent him off into the distant past. This was the first in-story appearance of Brainiac's iconic red diode/electrode-like objects atop his head, which had previously appeared on the cover of his first appearance in ''Action Comics'' #242 (July 1958), but were not shown in the actual story. In \"Superboy\" #106 (July 1963), an infant Superman meets Brainiac, and it is explained that Brainiac looks the same due to his 200-year life span. In superman issue #93, Brainiac regenerates himself. It is revealed that he came from a planet called Bryak and, after a voyage in space, he returned to find everybody dead from a plague. He intended to get people from other planets (in shrunken cities to be enlarged with his growth ray) to repopulate Bryak, where he would rule them.\n\nBrainiac's legacy was revealed in ''Action Comics'' #276 (May 1961), in a ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' back-up story. This story introduced a green-skinned, blond-haired teenager named Querl Dox, or '''[[Brainiac 5]]''', who claimed to be Brainiac's 30th-century descendant. Unlike his ancestor, Brainiac 5 used his \"twelfth-level intellect\" for the forces of good and joined the Legion alongside [[Supergirl]], with whom he fell in love. His home planet was given variously as Bryak,<ref>{{Cite comic |story=The Lair of Brainiac |title=[[Superboy]] |issue=#106 |date=July 1963 |publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> Yod or [[Colu]].\n\nIn ''Superman'' #167 (February 1964), it was [[retcon]]ned that Brainiac was a machine created by the Computer Tyrants of Colu as a spy for them to invade other worlds, for which he was given a non-computer appearance. Brainiac's distinctive gridwork of red diodes across his head are also explained. He was created with visible \"electric terminals of his sensory 'nerves'\" that he required to function. Luthor discovers that the Computers could have given him a twelfth-level intellect, but gave him a tenth-level, the same as them, so he would not try to dominate them. Luthor frees Brainiac from a prison on another world and increases his intelligence; however, he implants a timer that will make Brainiac black out so the computer does not betray him, as only Luthor can reset the timer and if Brainiac tries to tamper with it, one touch will cause an explosion. However, Brainiac tricks Luthor by making a device that hypnotizes Luthor, who removes the timer and forgets Brainiac is a computer. Explaining the 1961 introduction of Brainiac's descendant Brainiac 5, his biological disguise included an adopted \"son\", a young Coluan boy who was given the name \"[[Brainiac 2]]\". In the same issue, the [[comic book letter column|letter column]] contained a \"special announcement\" explaining that the change in the characterization of Brainiac was being made \"in deference\" to the \"Brainiac Computer Kit\", a toy computer created by [[Edmund Berkeley]] and based on the [[Geniac]] that predated the creation of the comic book character.<ref>{{Cite comic | story=Metropolis Mailbag (column) | title=[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] | issue=#167 | date=February 1964 | publisher=DC Comics | location=New York | url=http://www.vintagecomputer.net/brainiac/superman_Feb_number167_mailbag.jpg}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Engblom | first=Mark | title=Which Came First?

At the same time as [[Lex Luthor]] acquired his green-and-purple Lexorian battlesuit, Brainiac was re-envisioned (under the auspices of writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[Gil Kane]]). In ''Action Comics'' #544-546 (June-August 1983), Brainiac had constructed a giant, artificial, computer-controlled planet and used it in his latest attempt to destroy Superman. His defeat at the hands of the Man of Steel left him trapped at the center of the planet, unable to escape. He was forced to make a nearby star, Epsilon 4, go [[nova]] in order to destroy the machine-world. It, however, also dissolved Brainiac's humanoid body into a stream of sentient molecules that, after a fantastic voyage through time and space, returned to the present and reinstated as a living computer with no trace of human emotions and a mind steeped in logic. His new body (designed by [[Ed Hannigan]]) had the appearance of a [[skeleton]] of living metal with a grey (sometimes iridescent), [[honeycomb]]-patterned \"braincase.\"<ref>''Who's Who in the DC Universe'' #3 (May 1985)</ref> He also created a [[starship]] to house his new body which was actually an extension of himself; the ship was shaped like his own skull, with metal tentacles dangling from it that he could manipulate at will. Brainiac retained this appearance until after the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' miniseries.\n\nThe Silver/Bronze Age Brainiac met his final end in the \"[[Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]\" storyline that closed out the Pre-''Crisis'' Superman chronology. [[Lex Luthor]] found Brainiac's robotic head and was fused with it, making him immortal to everything. Brainiac took control of Luthor's body, mind and vocal cords and sought to destroy Superman once and for all, teaming up with the [[Legion of Super-Villains]]. Fighting Brainiac's control, Luthor begged a superpowered [[Lana Lang]] to kill him; she complied by breaking his neck. Though Luthor died, Brainiac was able to retain control of the body for a little while before [[rigor mortis]] set in and his brain was forced to leave it. \"Propelled by sheer malice\", the head crawled a few inches before finally running down.\n\n===Modern Age===\nIn the Post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' [[DC Universe]], Brainiac's history was completely rewritten. The Post-''Crisis'' version of Brainiac was now a radical Coluan scientist called Vril Dox who, having attempted to overthrow the Computer Tyrants of Colu, was sentenced to death. In his last moments before disintegration, his consciousness was attracted light years away to '''Milton Moses Fine''', a human sideshow mentalist who worked under the alias \"The Amazing Brainiac\".<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Cite book | last=Greenberger | first=Robert | author-link=Robert Greenberger | contribution=Brainiac | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=61 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=[[London]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5}}</ref> Needing cranial fluid to maintain his possession of Fine, Dox went on a murder spree. He discovered that Fine had genuine [[psychic]] powers and was thus a [[metahuman]], which he frequently wielded against Superman.<ref>''[[Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #438 (March 1988)</ref>\n\n====\"Panic in the Sky\"====\nIn the early 1990s, Brainiac returned in the \"Panic in the Sky\" storyline. He seized control of [[Warworld]] and manipulated [[Maxima (comics)|Maxima]] into assisting him. Then he brainwashed [[Supergirl (Matrix)|Supergirl]] and the alien warrior [[Draaga]] before capturing [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] and setting off for Earth.<ref>''Action Comics'' #674 (February 1992)</ref><ref>''Superman: The Man of Steel'' #9 (March 1992)</ref> [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] and [[Lightray (DC Comics)|Lightray]] of [[New Genesis]] attacked Warworld, but they were quickly taken down by Maxima and Supergirl. Brainiac sent the mental image of the [[New Gods]] captured to Superman in order to taunt him, and he also sent his \"headship\" (a green-hued variant of the Pre-''Crisis'' skull-like ship) to Earth in a [[punitive expedition]].<ref name=super65>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #65 (March 1992)</ref>\n\nThese acts prompted Superman to go on the offense, rather than wait for the inevitable invasion. He gathered a coalition of most of the world's superheroes and launched a preemptive strike at Warworld before it could arrive on Earth.<ref name=super65/> A small, elite force was left behind for any scouting forces that would be sent ahead. Superman led the attack on Warworld, where Supergirl and Draaga managed to shrug off their brainwashing and rally to Superman (although Draaga was killed in the fighting).<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #488 (March 1992)</ref><ref>''Superman: The Man of Steel'' #10 (April 1992)</ref> Brainiac briefly took control of some of Earth's heroes, but it was not enough to turn the tide.<ref>''Action Comics'' #675 (March 1992)</ref> Maxima would shortly switch sides in the fighting too, perceiving Brainiac as the true villain at last. [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], Maxima, and the [[Metal Men]] attacked him in his lair, where Maxima managed to [[lobotomy|lobotomize]] him (but was stopped short of killing him).<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #66 (April 1992)</ref> His vegetative body was taken back to New Genesis for observation.<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #489 (April 1992)</ref>\n\n====Dead again====\nBrainiac would next emerge about a year after the death and return of Superman. After a dead body appeared in Superman's tomb, prompting the world to wonder if the Superman who was flying around was the original or a fake,<ref>''Superman the Man of Steel'' #38 (November 1994)</ref> Superman began to track down all of his foes who might be capable of such a hoax.<ref>''Action Comics'' #704 (November 1994)</ref> While Brainiac was initially eliminated as a suspect,<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #95 (December 1994)</ref> he soon turned out to be the true culprit, creating the illusion even in his comatose state on [[New Genesis]]. He managed to revive himself there and returned to Earth in secret. While hidden, he created even more delusions, causing Superman to question his very sanity before realizing who was really at fault.<ref>''Action Comics'' #705 (December 1994)</ref><ref>''Superman the Man of Steel'' #40 (January 1995)</ref> Superman and Brainiac squared off in Metropolis, where Superman taunted the evil villain, claiming that at heart he was really just Milton Moses Fine, a cheap entertainer. This caused some break in Brainiac's mind where Fine's personality reasserted himself, burying Brainiac's. Fine was then escorted off to a psychiatric facility.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #96 (January 1995)</ref>\n\n====The Doomsday Wars====\nDuring a later skirmish with Superman in Metropolis, Milton Moses Fine's body was irreparably damaged, leaving Brainiac with only a short time to live. In order to preserve his life, he concocted an elaborate scheme by having an agent of his, a Coluan named Prin Vnok, use a [[time travel|time machine]] to travel to the End of Time itself and retrieve [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], who had been left there by Superman and [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]] to ensure that he would never be a threat again, and use Doomsday as a new host body.<ref name=doomswar2>''Superman: The Doomsday Wars'' #2 (1998)</ref>\n\nSeconds before the forces of [[entropy]] destroyed him forever, Doomsday was taken to safety by Vnok and returned to Colu. There, a terminally-wounded Brainiac transferred his consciousness into Doomsday's body, temporarily becoming the most powerful being in the universe; a [[genius]] [[psychic]] mind inside an unstoppable, indestructible titan. However, Doomsday's own raging mind would eventually overwhelm Brainiac's will, and he reacted too quickly for Brainiac and Vnok to erase his mind using chemical or psionic treatments, forcing Brainiac to find another body. While still lodged in Doomsday's head, Brainiac decided to acquire a sample of human DNA that he could modify with Doomsday's DNA to create a new version of Doomsday that did not possess the creature's mind. Brainiac chose to use [[Pete Ross]] and [[Lana Lang]]'s newborn baby, born eight weeks premature and at that moment being transported by Superman to the best Neo-Natal Intensive Care Unit in the country-as the template for his new body. He intercepted Superman during the trip to the hospital and stole the baby to hurt his long-time foe, correctly deducing that it was the child of someone close to Superman.<ref name=doomswar2/> Superman thwarted Brainiac's plot by driving him out of Doomsday's body with the use of a [[telepathy]]-blocking 'psi-blocker' that he had used in his last battle, forcing Brainiac out of Doomsday and leaving him with no other option but to adopt a recently designed robotic body, dubbed '''Brainiac 2.5''', where he himself believed would be forever trapped, as he could not abandon it.<ref name=doomswar3>''Superman: The Doomsday Wars'' #3 (1998)</ref>\n\n====Brainiac 13====\n[[File:Brainiac 13.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Brainiac 13. Art by [[Ed McGuinness]], Steve Kim, and Tommy Yune.]]\nAt the turn of the [[millennium]], Brainiac 2.5 revealed that he had placed a sleeper [[computer virus|virus]] in [[LexCorp]]'s [[Y2K bug]] safeguards. This virus was intended to dramatically boost his abilities. However, the virus instead allowed his upgraded future self, '''Brainiac 13''' (or \"'''B-13'''\"), to travel from the 64th century to the present day and take control of Brainiac 2.5's body.\n\nBrainiac 13 then began transforming Metropolis into the 64th-century version of the city, which he controlled, and also began upgrading [[Metallo]] into a giant-sized version of himself. Brainiac 13 then took control of several android superheroes, such as the [[Red Tornado]] and [[Hourman (android)|Hourman]], and used them against Superman. The [[Metal Men]]'s responsometers were able to protect them from his programming, and allowed them to help defeat Metallo.\n\nDuring a fight with the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]] (who was attempting to 'hijack' the B13 virus and use it for its own ends), Superman discovered that Brainiac 13 could not cope with Kryptonian technology, due to incompatibility issues. This gave Superman a plan to stop Brainiac 13's scheme. With the aid of the rebuilt [[Kelex]], Superman tricked Luthor into connecting a Kryptonian battlesuit to one of Brainiac 13's power conduits. Kelex then reactivated the Red Tornado to help Superman break Brainiac 13 down into his respective nanobots and trap him in the suit.\n\nBrainiac 13 was able to work with Brainiac 2.5\u2014now transferred into the aged body of [[Lena Luthor]]\u2014and prepared a tactic against [[Imperiex]] for the upcoming [[Our Worlds at War|Imperiex War]]. The Brainiacs successfully engineered Imperiex's defeat, allowing Brainiac 13 to absorb Imperiex's power and use it to overpower the combined heroes and villains of the universe while simultaneously devastating both Earth and Apokolips. Brainiac 13 planned to use the power he stole from Imperiex to conquer the universe and reshape it in his image, and is made so powerful by the absorption that none of the heroes, not even Superman, can hope to damage him.<ref>''Superman the Man of Steel'' #117 (October 2001).</ref> However, with help from Lex's temporal displacement technology and Darkseid's Boom Tube technology boosted by magic supplied by Tempest and the Amazons, Superman was able to destroy Brainiac 13 and Imperiex by sending them through a temporal [[Boom tube]] where they were annihilated in the Big Bang. Brainiac 13 had his body disintegrated and the remnants of his mind scattered across sixty trillion light years, finally killing the chronologically last known version of Brainiac.<ref>''Action Comics'' #782 (October 2001).</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Brainiac 13, Superman discovered that the version of Krypton he previously visited via the [[Phantom Zone]] was, in fact, a trap created by Brainiac 13. Having been defeated by Kryptonian technology, Brainiac 13 had traveled back in time to the real Krypton prior to its destruction. There, he stole the Eradicator matrix and [[Jor-El]]'s diaries, and created a false Krypton based on Jor-El's favorite period in history.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=[[Jeph Loeb|Loeb, Jeph]] | cowriters=[[Joe Casey]], [[Mark Schultz (comics)|Mark Schultz]], ''et al.'' | penciller=[[Ed McGuinness|McGuinness, Ed]] | copencillers=[[Duncan Rouleau]], [[Pasqual Ferry|Pascual Ferry]], ''et al.'' | inker=[[Cam Smith|Smith, Cam]] | coinkers=Marlo Alquiza, Tom Nguyen, ''et al.'' | title=Superman: Return to Krypton | date=March 2004 | publisher=DC Comics | location=New York | id={{ISBN|978-1840237986}}}}</ref>\n\nSometime later, Superman traveled into the future and battled '''Brainiac 12'''. He learned that everything Brainiac 13 did in the past was designed to ensure things reached the point where Brainiac 13 would be created. Brainiac 12's defeat before his upgrade apparently reversed the advances Brainiac 13 had made to Metropolis.<ref name=\"superman200\">''Superman'' (vol. 2) #200 (February 2004)</ref>\n\n====The Insiders====\n{{Main|Indigo (comics)}}\n[[File:Brainiacs.jpg|thumb|right|Brainiac with his descendant [[Brainiac 8]], as they discuss his use of organics; art by Matthew Clark]]\nAround the time of the ''[[Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day|Graduation Day]]'' event, a future version of Brainiac, called '''Brainiac 6''', used his \"granddaughter\", '''Brainiac 8''' (also known as [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]]), to kill [[Donna Troy]] in order to ensure the fate of Colu. Indigo then infiltrated the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] until she attacked the team, along with Brainiac 6 and his allies, Lex Luthor, and a brainwashed [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], who had attacked the [[Teen Titans]]. In the ensuing battle, Indigo died and Superboy broke away from the brainwashing, while Luthor escaped. While his ship was destroyed, Brainiac's condition and whereabouts after the battle are unknown.<ref>''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) #24-25 (July- August 2005)</ref><ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #24-25 (July - August 2005)</ref>\n\n====Silver Age Brainiac in the Post-''Crisis'' universe====\nLater stories revealed that elements of Brainiac's Pre-''Crisis'' history occurred in the Post-''Crisis'' character's history prior to his possession of Milton Moses Fine and his first encounter with Superman. The citizens of Kandor recall that Brainiac stole their city from Krypton, and not the alien wizard Tolos.<ref name=\"superman200\"/>\n\n''[[History of the DC Universe]]'' mentions his defeat by the [[Omega Men]], although this is not seen in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' itself, and noted a second Brainiac was created in a laboratory on Earth two years later. In the ''[[Silver Age (DC Comics)|Silver Age: JLA]]'' one-shot, the [[Injustice League]] discovered numerous shrunken alien cities found in Brainiac's abandoned spaceship.\n\n====Brainiac's updated mechanical form====\n[[File:SupermanCv219.jpg|thumb|right|Brainiac battles [[Superman]] during the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' event. Cover of ''[[Superman vol. 2|Superman]]'' (vol. 2) #219 (September 2005). Art by [[Ed Benes]].]]\nBrainiac later reappeared as a [[Swarm intelligence|swarm of interlinked nanotechnological units]]. Its operation was to sabotage a [[Waynetech#Wayne Technologies|Waynetech research facility]] accomplished by infecting [[Metallo]] with a [[computer virus]] and controlling him from orbit. Superman and [[Batman]] tracked Brainiac's signal to an orbital facility and attacked. Brainiac's nanoswarm body was destroyed, though he had infected the [[Metal Men]] during their previous encounter with Metallo. Brainiac proceeded to use them to acquire a prototype [[OMAC (comics)|OMAC unit]], which Bruce Wayne had developed through the use of Brainiac 13 nanotechnology. Superman and Batman destroyed the OMAC body with the aid of the Metal Men, after the Metal Men overcame Brainiac's control.<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #34-36 (May\u2013August 2007)</ref>\n\n====Return====\n{{Main|Brainiac (story arc)}}\nFollowing revisions to Superman's continuity in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' and ''Action Comics'' #850, Brainiac reappeared in a self-titled five-part story arc in ''Action Comics''. In ''Action Comics'' #866 (August 2008), a Brainiac robot probe (resembling his skeleton-esque Pre-''Crisis'' incarnation, and mistaken for the real Brainiac by Clark) arrives on Earth and battles Superman. After the probe is defeated, information about Superman's blood is sent to the original Brainiac. As Brainiac wakes up, his computer announces \"Attempt #242 in progress\", a reference to Brainiac's first appearance in ''Action Comics'' #242, and to the many encounters between Brainiac and Superman. In the following issue, [[Kara Zor-El|Supergirl]] reveals to Superman that Brainiac shrunk the Kryptonian city of Kandor and placed it in a bottle, and that all previous incarnations of Brainiac that Superman has encountered were just probes, clones, and nanite-controlled bodies. She notes that no one has ever actually seen Brainiac. Inspired by Supergirl's story, Superman attempts to find Brainiac and stop him. He heads to a world under attack by Brainiac just in time to be caught in a supernova as Brainiac destroys the system's star and the populated world along with. The supernova knocks Superman out, and he is caught and brought onto Brainiac's ship.\n\nSuperman escapes from his imprisonment and sees Brainiac emerging from his \"bio-shell\". This version of Brainiac resembles a much larger and more muscular version of the original, Pre-''Crisis'' Brainiac, and has motives similar to the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' incarnation of the character in that he travels the universe and steals the knowledge of various alien cultures, abducting and shrinking cities from each planet as samples, and then destroys the planet so that the value of the destroyed civilization's knowledge is increased. Superman attacks Brainiac, but Brainiac manages to overpower the Man of Steel before restraining him with the help of his ship's internal systems. Brainiac inserts the subdued Superman into a machine that allows him to read the Kryptonian's mind, with the intent of assimilating his brain. Brainiac's ship then travels to Earth and prepares to abduct the city of Metropolis.\n\nBrainiac successfully steals Metropolis, and prepares to fire a missile that will destroy the Sun and the Earth itself. Supergirl ends up captured along with the rest of Metropolis, but Superman breaks out of his restraints again and frees her. Supergirl stops the missile, while Superman battles Brainiac. Brainiac appears to have the advantage in physical combat yet again, but Superman knocks Brainiac out of his ship and into a swamp, where Brainiac is overwhelmed by the microscopic organisms covering his body. Superman uses this distraction to defeat Brainiac. While Superman frees the cities of Metropolis and Kandor, the villain launches a missile to the Kent farm in an act of spite. The farm is destroyed, and Jonathan Kent suffers a fatal heart attack because of it.<ref>''Action Comics'' #866-870 (June\u2013October 2008)</ref> Brainiac is brought to a top-secret military base, where the imprisoned Lex Luthor is assigned to discover his secrets. Luthor eventually manages to use Brainiac's connection to his ship to kill the soldiers assigned to watch him. Brainiac manages to free himself from Luthor's control, forcing him on board the ship, and the two make their escape.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #0 (April 2009)</ref>\n\nNotably, upon learning of Brainiac's modus operandi of destroying planets by destabilizing nearby stars when he is done collecting cities and knowledge from said planets, Superman openly speculates that Brainiac destroyed Krypton, which was destroyed when its sun went nova soon after Brainiac abducted Kandor and Argo. He also asks the alien what he did to Krypton's sun.<ref name=\"Action Comics #868 October 2008\">''Action Comics'' #868 (October 2008).</ref> Brainiac ignores the query, neither confirming or denying his responsibility, though he does heavily imply it (\"In fifty-seven minutes, my solar aggressor will reach your sun. It will flare up, and the Earth will be incinerated. Just like Krypton.\"). Superman still believes Brainiac had a part in Krypton's destruction after the end of this story arc.<ref>''Superman Secret Files and Origins 2009''</ref>\n\n====New Krypton====\n{{Main|Superman: Last Stand of New Krypton|Superman: War of the Supermen}}\n\nFollowing this Brainiac, now in possession of his ship again, unleashes his robot army against the newly created planet of [[New Krypton]], and the Kryptonian citizens rise up to fight the drones. General Zod's army proves totally unable to fend them off, as the Brainiac's ship's force fields are seemingly invulnerable and his drones are equipped with red sunray guns, allowing them to kill tens of thousands of Kryptonians. Superman, being the only one who knows how to penetrate his force fields (having learned the trick in the previous story arc), manages to enter Brainiac's ship. Supergirl leads the Kryptonians against the drones, but is attacked by an anti-Kryptonian Brainiac probe. [[Superboy]], [[Mon-El]], and the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] join the fight and save Supergirl.\n\nAfter this, Brainiac shrinks Kandor again and re-bottles it, including a miniature red sun to de-power all the Kryptonians inside. The Legion, Supergirl, Superboy, Zod, and Superman all make it on to Brainiac's ship, thanks to Brainiac 5 hacking his ancestor's force fields and allowing them entry. The Legion explains to Zod that, just as Krypton's city of Kandor is held in a bottle onboard Brainiac's ship, other planets' cities are also imprisoned, and, therefore, Zod cannot destroy Brainiac's ship until the cities can be rescued. Zod sends Supergirl off and then arrests the Legionnaires, branding them terrorists. Meanwhile, Superman is about to face off against Brainiac when he is knocked down by a kryptonite energy blast fired by Lex Luthor and subsequently captured. Brainiac locks him in captivity with the intent to experiment on him, but Superman escapes and meets up with the rest of the superheroes and Zod on a separate section of the ship. Zod enters the scene and engages Brainiac in combat while Supergirl, Superboy, and the Legion recover the bottled cities on Brainiac's ship, including Kandor. Zod seems to be losing his fight with Brainiac, when suddenly Superman gets up and tackles Brainiac from behind. Before the battle between the two Kryptonians and the villain can continue, Brainiac's ship starts to destabilize and descend towards the planet. It is revealed that Lex Luthor sabotaged the ship and re-sized one of the cities while inside.\n\nLuthor's intervention causes the ship to crash into New Krypton, destroying it while Supergirl and the Legion re-size Kandor. However, the city that Luthor expanded is still growing, now putting Kandor at risk. As [[Brainiac 5]] works on the problem, Supergirl is shocked to discover Superman impaled by pieces of Brainiac's ship as a result of the explosion. Superman appears to have been fatally stricken. Luthor, though reeling from the explosion, is pleased with all the destruction he has caused. Brainiac confronts Luthor in the ruins of the ship and is furious that Lex sabotaged his ship. Luthor mocks him and spits in his eye before Brainiac angrily snaps Luthor's neck, killing him.\n\nNow deprived of his ship and technology, and seemingly depowered by his ship's destruction, Brainiac finds himself faced by an entire city of angry, solar-powered Kryptonians. Zod is eager for a final showdown with Brainiac, who calls Zod a coward for confronting Brainiac with his powers intact and an army of super-powered Kryptonians at his back. In response, Zod fires the red sun radiation from an Archer rifle at himself, to remove his powers and thus supposedly level the playing field as he prepares to take Brainiac down. Brainiac 5 gives Superman a transfusion of Conner's blood and exposes him to a very large dose of concentrated synthesized yellow sun rays. Using these techniques, Brainiac 5 is able to revive Superman.\n\nDespite the loss of his powers, Zod is able to get the upper hand on the similarly-powerless Brainiac and force him to his knees. Zod is about to shoot Brainiac when Superman intervenes. This causes a heated argument between Superman and Zod. Zod commands his soldiers to restrain Kal-El so Zod can proceed with the execution of Brainiac. Brainiac 5, sensing that this is his moment of destiny, steps in and teleports himself and Brainiac off of New Krypton.\n\nIt is revealed that Lex used a Luthor robot, supplied by the [[Toyman]], to accomplish his mission on New Krypton, and that Brainiac killed the robot instead. Lex is very much alive and discussing with General Lane how his objective, to bring chaos to New Krypton, was achieved. Lex has been working as an agent of General Lane all along. The disarray that Lex caused provides Lane with a window of opportunity as he prepares for the impending war with New Krypton. Lex receives a Presidential pardon for his efforts. The story ends with Zod rallying his people as he declares war on the planet Earth. The story concludes in the next miniseries, ''[[Superman: War of the Supermen]]''.\n\nMon-El plants the many bottled cities that Brainiac has captured over the years on various planets across the galaxy. These cities will one day become the United Planets by the 31st century, the same planets that will produce the members of the Legion of Super-Heroes.\n\nBrainiac 5 takes Brainiac to their homeworld of [[Colu]] where he hands him over to [[Vril Dox]] II, a.k.a. Brainiac 2. Vril Dox happily turns his \"father\" over to his people for his crimes. However [[Lyrl Dox]], a.k.a. Brainiac 3, releases his \"grandfather\" with a weapon called Pulsar Stargrave. What then occurs is an all-out battle for Colu between all three present-day Brainiacs. Vril Dox even calls in [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] for help. Brainac breaks out of his prison and, after causing much damage on Colu, escapes with Pulsar Stargrave in tow for parts unknown.<ref>''R.E.B.E.L.S.'' (vol. 2) #15-20 (May\u2013September 2010)</ref>\n\n====''The New 52''====\nBrainiac's origin in ''[[The New 52]]'' is revealed in ''Superman'' #23.2. Vril Dox was acknowledged as the greatest scientist on his homeworld, Yod-Colu, given his advances in force field technology and miniaturization. He developed an artificial intelligence, C.O.M.P.U.T.O., allowing him to discover the fifth dimension. Dox discovered the fifth dimension was in a state of war, and a group of its inhabitants, the Multitude, had entered their dimension and destroyed over a hundred planets. Realizing Yod-Colu was next in the Multitude's path, Dox tried to find a way to save his planet, even performing experiments on his son. The magistrates of Yod-Colu sentenced Dox to exile, but Dox used C.O.M.P.U.T.O. to take control of Yod-Colu's computer networks. Copying the planet's database, Dox constructed an army of robot servants called Terminauts and miniaturized the city his wife and son lived on and bottled it in a force field, while the rest of Yod-Colu was destroyed by the Multitude.\n\nAfter the destruction of Yod-Colu, Dox constructed an army of starships and distributed his consciousness across a series of robots that would each travel the universe in order to preserve planets from the Multitude, becoming known as the Collector of Worlds. One of these robots attacked Krypton. Dox became fascinated by Jor-El, a Kryptonian scientist who actually saved his homeworld from the Multitude. Upon returning to Krypton, however, Brainiac discovered Krypton had been destroyed.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 3) #23.2 (September 2013)</ref>\n\nReferred to at first as 'The Collector of Worlds', Brainiac is first seen as the mysterious informant that supplies Lex Luthor information of Superman and his alien nature.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 2) #2 (October 2011)</ref> Clark is having a dream of Krypton's final moments in which an artificial intelligence that controls the planet wakes up robots in an attempt to preserve the Kryptonian culture. Later, while Clark conducts an interview in a robotic factory, the same harvester robots appear.\n\nJohn Corben (the soon-to-be supervillain [[Metallo]]) is suddenly possessed by the artificial intelligence. It demands Superman.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 2) #3 (November 2011)</ref> The robots create havoc throughout Metropolis, but Superman soon realizes that they are really after him. Superman fights the possessed Corben with the help of [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|John Henry Irons]].\n\nAlthough they managed to defeat him, the alien sentience had already miniaturized and bottled the city of Metropolis and took it to his ship in space.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 2) #4 (December 2011)</ref> Superman travels to the ship to find many alien bottled cities, Kandor included. The alien identifies himself as a being from the planet Colu where he was known as C.O.M.P.U.T.O and on Krypton he was called Brainiac 1.0. He claims that, without Superman and the ship that brought him to Earth, his Kryptonian collection is incomplete. The alien intelligence demands Superman make a choice: the intelligence will disable life support in both the Kandor and Metropolis bottles, and Superman must choose which city to save using indestructible Kryptonian armor found on the ship.\n\nSuperman decides on neither and wears the armor (which changes instantly into the current Superman costume design). Brainiac sends Metallo to attack Superman, but due to Superman reasoning with him over his feelings for Lois Lane, he breaks free of Brainiac's control and joins Superman in his attack. Superman then uses his rocket from Krypton that had also been miniaturized with Metropolis to attack Brainiac's mind, which the rocket was able to do since its primary mission was to protect Kal-El. In doing so, Metropolis was returned to Earth and Superman took possession of Brainiac's ship and made it his new super citadel.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 2) #8 (April 2012)</ref>\n\nNotably, the ship Clark was placed into as a child was described as having \"Brainiac AI\", leaving the identity of the Collector of Worlds in doubt.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 2) #5 (January 2012)</ref> The Colony of the Collector of Worlds told Superman that its AI technology went by different names, beginning on Yod-Colu as [[Computo (comics)|C.O.M.P.U.T.O.]] On Noma, he was called Pneumenoid; on Bryak it was Mind2; on Krypton he was called Brainiac 1.0; and, finally on Earth, he is the Internet.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 2) #7 (March 2012)</ref>\n\nAfter this defeat, Brainiac retreated to deeper parts of the cosmos, and eventually came across the planet Tolerance, the setting of a bounty hunting glimmernet game show called ''The Hunted''. Striking a deal with [[Lady Styx]], overlord of the Tenebrian Dominion, he bottles a portion of the Sh'diki Borough of Tolerance to add to his collection. He encounters Jediah Caul, a former member of the Green Lantern Corps, who combats and infects Brainiac's ship. Ultimately, Brainiac abandons his plans with the Sh'diki Borough and ejects Caul and the bottled city before leaving for parts unknown.<ref>''Threshold'' #5-6 (July\u2013August 2013)</ref>\n\n====''Convergence''====\n{{Main|Superman: Doomed|Convergence (comics)}}\nBack on Earth, during an investigation of 20 kidnapped people who developed metahuman powers after being kidnapped by Brainiac, one of these 20 infects Lois Lane, thereby giving Brainiac control over a close ally of Superman.<ref>''Action Comics Annual'' (vol. 2) #2 (August 2013)</ref> Brainiac plots his return to Earth, using Lane to infiltrate Earth's defense systems to allow an easier path for his physical return.<ref>''Superman/Wonder Woman'' #8 (July 2014)</ref> and even upgrading her body to contain his 12th level intelligence. His minion Cyborg-Superman (a reconstructed [[Zor-El]], father of [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]])<ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 6) #21 (August 2013)</ref> constructs a portal to allow Brainiac's command ship and \"daughter ships\" to travel to Earth from throughout the galaxy.<ref>''Superman/Wonder Woman Annual'' #1 (September 2014)</ref>\n\nSuperman, whom Brainiac had conspired to 'infect' with the monster Doomsday in order to drive him away from Earth, uses his augmented power to attack Brainiac's gigantic mothership and break through to its core and, finally, Vril Dox himself. The Coluan appears still-humanoid, and explains his reasoning for stealing minds from throughout the universe: he has concluded that if he can 'unite' the minds of a certain critical number of people, he will be able to change reality itself. His motivation for this appears a desire to right the wrongs he feels responsible for: the loss of his wife and child back on Colu. His plan is undone when Superman drags him, mothership and all, into a black hole. But then, Vril Dox is snatched away to safety, it seems, by a being who appears to be the true Brainiac: an immensely powerful entity from outside the universe itself.<ref>''Superman: Doomed''</ref>\n\nThis version of Brainiac, a composite of Brainiac from around the Multiverse, is revealed to be the pre-''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' era Brainiac who, having found his way into the Source Wall and into the Multiverse, was thrown back in the timestream and mutated by the effects of \"crisis\" events such as ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', ''Zero Hour'', and ''52'', creating a godlike being.<ref>''Convergence'' #0</ref> He then uncovered the location of Vanishing Point from nearly killing New 52 Earth-0's [[Michelle Carter (comics)|Michelle Carter]], from which he could roam the complete history of the Multiverse, collecting doomed cities from defunct timelines, alternative futures, and parallel worlds to add to his collection, in ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'', leaving behind an agent, Telos, to rule a planet of the same name containing the cities. Brainiac's attempt to do this to a future timeline of Earth-0 was narrowly averted by the heroes in the story ''[[The New 52: Futures End]]''; Brainiac was contained in a T-sphere, leaving Telos stranded without his master, prompting the events of ''Convergence'' in which the planets are bid to fight each other. When the events of ''Convergence'' nearly end in an irreversible destruction of the Multiverse, the time traveller [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]], formerly the pre-''Flashpoint'' Booster Gold, frees Brainiac, who reveals he is sick from his mutations and only wishes to return to normal, to being Brainiac of Colu. He sends most of the heroes home, and with help from the ''Zero Hour'' [[Hal Jordan|Parallax]] and the pre-''Flashpoint'' Superman, averts the collapse of the Multiverse from ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', and is returned to the normal Brainiac. His actions also allow various parallel universes and alternate timelines to exist as the new Multiverse.<ref>''Convergence'' #1-8</ref>\n\n====Green Lantern Corps====\nBrainiac's name is first referenced in an issue of ''Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps''. The entirety of the Green and Yellow Lanterns (including [[Hal Jordan]], [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], and [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]]), along with [[Starro the Conqueror]], are lured into a trap and subsequently hit with a shrink ray while on the planet Xudar, leaving them tiny and helpless. In the next issue, they are trapped in a bottle, and their jailer is revealed to be a robot claiming to run on \"Brainiac 2.0\" software. The robot heavily resembles both Brainiac's 1983 skeleton-esque incarnation and the robotic drones utilized by the post-2008 version of Brainiac. It has a collection of shrunken bottled planets, and travels in a ship resembling Brainiac's skullship. At the time it was not clear if this was the true Brainiac after ''Rebirth'' or yet another one of his drones.<ref>''Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps'' #8-9 (2016).</ref>\n\nThe machine's victory is short-lived, however, as it is revealed that [[Larfleeze]] was able to reprogram it to his side using an Orange Lantern ring, having rebooted its life systems after finding it inactive on his homeworld with its ship. Larfleeze is impressed that the machine was able to capture the Green Lanterns and Starro, and even more impressed with the machine's shrinking technology, and plans to hijack its technology to put together his own collection. He takes the ship and collection to his homeworld of Okaara. However, upon being informed that the Yellow and Green Lanterns are still fighting inside the bottle and trying to kill each other, Larfleeze's own greed for having everything gets the best of him and he ends up breaking the container. This frees the Lanterns, and somehow restores them to their normal size and strength, after which they immediately start rampaging inside the ship and trashing Brainiac/Larfleeze's collection. Hal, Kyle, John and Guy go on to lead the attack on the Orange Lantern Corps. With everyone fighting together, the Orange Lantern Corps are quickly overwhelmed. Larfleeze accuses the robot of playing him; when it responds that it simply did what he programmed it to do, Larfleeze destroys it in a rage.<ref>''Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps'' #10-12 (2016).</ref>\n\nThe Superman storyline \"New World\" later confirmed via a flashback cameo that the Post-''Crisis'', post-2008 version of Brainiac (the tall, muscular, green-skinned cybernetic alien scientist) still exists in the post-''Rebirth'' continuity, and has encountered Superman in the past. Thus, the robot that defeated Starro, the Green Lantern Corps, and the Yellow Lantern Corps before subsequently being dispatched by Larfleeze was, in fact, one of his drones.<ref>''Action Comics'' #978 (June 2017)</ref>\n\n====No Justice====\nBrainiac later arrived on Earth again and battled the Justice League, who proved no match for him and his ship, until Superman arrived. However, he did not come to destroy the Earth, but to deliver a warning: that there is a cosmic-level threat in the universe coming to Earth, one that the heroes of Earth are woefully ill-prepared for. Brainiac thinks he can defeat the threat, but it means teaming up with Superman and the Justice League and combining members of the League with some of the most dangerous supervillains in the DC Universe and sending them into battle against this extinction-level menace. Four teams outfitted with Brainiac's technology are formed (including among other members, Lex Luthor, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Sinestro), with Brainiac himself working directly alongside his nemesis, Superman.<ref>[http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2018/01/26/scott-snyder-joins-forces-with-james-tynion-iv-and-joshua-williamson Scott Snyder Joins Forces With James Tynion IV and Joshua Williamson.]</ref>\n\nThe ''No Justice'' miniseries begins with the Omega Titans, the aforementioned threat, attacking Colu, Brainiac's homeworld, which explains Brainiac's kidnapping of Earth's superheroes and supervillains. Brainiac claims to have developed a plan to defeat the Omega Titans and the superheroes only need to follow his orders to win, but [[Amanda Waller]] uses the hidden Protocol XI, which involves kidnapping the world's most dangerous psychics, to probe Brainiac's mind and find out what he knows. The strain of the psychic attack causes Brainiac's head to explode, apparently killing him.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Scott Snyder|Snyder, Scott]]|Title = Justice League: No Justice|Volume = 1|Issue = #1|Date = May 2018|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nIn Scott Snyder's ''Justice League'' run, in order to fill in the gap left by Black Manta and the Joker, Lex Luthor sets Professor Ivo to work reconstructing Brainiac, with the intention of him joining the Legion of Doom. Despite teaming up with them, Brainiac does have his own motivations, including planning his revenge against Waller.\n\n====Brainiac 6====\nHe is the gang version of Brainiac and first appears in ''[[Adventures of the Super Sons]]'' #1.<ref>{{cite web | last=Cardona | first=Ian | title=Adventures of the Super Sons Introduces the Li'l Legion of Doom | website=CBR | date=August 8, 2018 | url=https://www.cbr.com/super-sons-lil-legion-of-doom/ | access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBrainiac's most consistent power (endemic to all versions) is his \"twelfth-level intellect\", allowing calculation abilities, enhanced memory and advanced understanding of mechanical engineering, bio-engineering, [[physics]], and other theoretical and applied sciences, as well as extensive knowledge of various alien technologies.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=38-44}}</ref> For comparison, the population of 20th century Earth as a whole constitutes a sixth-level intelligence and the population of 31st century Earth as a whole is a ninth-level intelligence. His Post-''Crisis'' incarnation claims that his brain can process and sort the knowledge of over four hundred ninety octodecillion beings (490 \u00d7 10<sup>57</sup>),<ref name=\"Action Comics #868 October 2008\"/> which is an enormous number, about five billion times the estimated number of atoms of the Earth. The character has created devices such as a [[force shield|force field]] belt capable of withstanding Superman's most powerful blows,<ref name=\"action242\">''Action Comics'' #242 (July 1958)</ref> and a shrinking ray capable of reducing cities.<ref name=\"action242\"/>\n\nBrainiac's advanced mental powers have shown him capable of [[Spirit possession|possessing]] others, absorbing information from other beings, transferring his consciousness,<ref>''Action Comics'' #544-546 (June\u2013August 1983)</ref> creating and manipulating computer systems, replicating multiple versions of himself, and exerting powers to traverse or control space and time. Among organic beings, Brainiac views only his frequent partner Lex Luthor as a peer intellect. Brainiac is usually depicted with an incredibly high degree of super strength and durability; the exact level varies, but usually hovers at around Superman's strength. Brainiac's exact abilities vary drastically throughout his various incarnations.\n\n===Pre-''Crisis''===\nOriginally, Brainiac was a scientist with no superhuman abilities aside from his intellect. He fought Superman via the use of his advanced technology and cunning, similar to [[Lex Luthor]]. Among these were a forcefield belt which projected a shield that made him immune to all harm (even Superman's blows), a shrinking ray, and a headpiece consisting of a cluster of diode/electrode-like objects. His cybernetic headpiece lets him interface with technology and project energy blasts from his head, which were powerful enough to significantly harm Superman. Superman described the blasts as \"blindingly painful... almost unbearable\" and as a threat to his life.<ref>''Superman'' #338 (August 1979)</ref> The Pre-''Crisis'' Brainiac was referred to by an omniscient narrator as \"the super-computer space pirate-- Superman's most powerful nemesis.\"<ref>''Action Comics'' #443 (January 1975)</ref>\n\nBrainiac being unpowered and reliant on external weaponry was largely still the case even when he was [[retconned]] as an android, but in the 1980s, this changed and he gained the abilities that would stick to all subsequent incarnations: superstrength and durability, technopathy, and super longevity. His technopathic abilities extend to control of his ship, with which he shares a symbiotic relationship. The android version of Brainiac was capable of downloading his consciousness to spare, robotic bodies in the event that his original was destroyed or damaged. He could also possess organic beings in certain circumstances, as he did to Luthor during ''[[Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]''.\n\nThe final body utilized by the Pre-''Crisis'' Brainiac (resembling a robotic skeleton) was technopathic, had superstrength and durability, could discharge energy blasts capable of hurting Superman, and knew of how to \"spin\" the psychokinetic energies he generated into a web-like net which could hold Superman at bay. Among the knowledge he absorbed was extensive information on hand-to-hand combat techniques, making him a very skilled combatant. Despite this, he saw physical confrontation as beneath him, and preferred to defeat foes with his mind.<ref>''Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe'' #3</ref>\n\n===Post-''Crisis''===\n\n====Probes====\n[[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s re-imagining of the character possessed [[telepathy]] and [[telekinesis]], as well as the ability to discharge energy blasts. He was an alien consciousness who had possessed the body of a powerful human psychic and awakened his powers, further augmenting them with an implanted electrode head-piece. His vast psychic powers allowed him to seriously challenge Superman, and defeat multiple members of the [[New Gods]] (including [[Orion (comics)|Orion]]) with a single psionic energy blast,<ref>[http://i.imgur.com/FMTvCli.jpg ''Action Comics'']</ref> but the body's lack of Superman-level durability was a major liability and eventually led to it being rendered useless in a gasoline explosion. After this organic body was destroyed, Brainiac's consciousness built and possessed various robotic bodies and occasionally hijacked other organic bodies (such as Doomsday's). His abilities were dependent on the body he was inhabiting at the time, which could vary from as weak as a normal human to far stronger than Superman. His nanoswarm incarnation, for instance, could shapeshift, regenerate, project energy blasts and force fields, and match Superman blow for blow; Superman stated Brainiac to have physical strength on par with Doomsday's in this form.<ref>[https://i.imgur.com/4qiydhA.jpg ''Superman/Batman'' #36] (August 2007).</ref> His strongest incarnation was Brainiac 13, who, even prior to absorbing Imperiex, was so physically formidable that Superman could not remotely affect, much less damage, him. By contrast, Brainiac was easily able to kill Superman, and would have done so in a short time had he not been devoted to torturing the Man of Steel.<ref>''Action Comics'' #763 (March 2000)</ref>\n\n====True form====\nIt was later revealed that this version of Brainiac (like the previous ones) was merely a mentally-controlled probe of the real Brainiac, who was a living Coluan that had genetically and cybernetically enhanced himself. The true Brainiac lacked psychic powers, but still possessed super physical attributes, intelligence, and technopathy. He possesses a level of strength vastly surpassing that of a full-powered Superman; capable of easily overpowering the Kryptonian in a grapple and flooring him with a single punch, breaking his near-invulnerable skin by squeezing Superman's head with his fingers,<ref>''Action Comics'' #868 (October 2008)</ref> and catching one of Superman's punches and crushing his hand until it bled, forcing Superman to his knees.<ref name=\"Action Comics #870 December 2008\">''Action Comics'' #870 (December 2008)</ref> His durability is also far greater than Superman's, shown when he absorbs several consecutive blows to the face from the Man of Steel without visible harm and later claims that Superman's punches did not hurt him at all.<ref>''Superman: Last Stand Of New Krypton'' #3 (April 2010).</ref> Even a concentrated and sustained burst of heat vision directly to Brainiac's eyes did not seriously debilitate him, though it inflicted noticeable damage.<ref name=\"Action Comics #870 December 2008\"/> At one point [[Brainiac 5]] warns that Superman would most likely die against Brainiac in a straight fight.<ref name=\"Superman #699 June 2010\">''Superman'' #699 (June 2010)</ref> ''Superman Secret Files and Origins 2009'' further state that Brainiac is \"as strong and invulnerable as a Kryptonian.\"<ref>''Superman: Secret Files and Origins 2009'' (October 2009)</ref>\n\nDespite his enormous physical enhancements, Brainiac had several weaknesses. Like the Pre-''Crisis'' Brainiac, he is mentally connected to his ship in such a way that he can be disabled for a short period if separated without warning. Initially, he had the weakness of being disabled by his [[mysophobia]] and sensory overload when dumped into Earth's atmosphere,<ref name=\"Action Comics #870 December 2008\"/> though he does not seem to have this defect in his later battles on Earth, such as when he defeated [[Superboy]],<ref>''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #6 (March 2010).</ref> suggesting that he had fixed it, or that he is only overloaded in particularly dirty environments. Finally, being separated from his ship for prolonged periods causes him to physically deteriorate and become far less powerful, as Lex Luthor observed while studying his unconscious body over the course of several days when it was in the custody of the U.S. government.\n\nThis Brainiac is an incredibly powerful physical fighter, but like his Pre-''Crisis'' counterpart is most dangerous due to the advanced technology he wields, much of it of his own invention. These include his classic shrinking ray and force fields, as well as other gadgets such as missiles capable of causing stars to go [[supernova]].<ref>''Action Comics'' #867 (September 2008)</ref> His force fields are so impregnable that a direct hit from an energy weapon that kills several fully powered Kryptonians as collateral damage did not leave so much as a single scratch on his ship.<ref>''Superman: Last Stand of New Krypton'' #1 (May 2010)</ref> Brainiac also possesses an army of at least tens of thousands of humanoid robotic \"probes\". These probes are strong enough to draw blood from Superman<ref>''Action Comics'' #866 (August 2008)</ref> and tough enough to survive some of his powerful blows. During the New Krypton story arc, Brainiac upgraded his probes with red-sun ray guns for the purpose of fighting Kryptonians. When Brainiac orders these drones to attack New Krypton, they quickly kill over eleven thousand solar-powered Kryptonians.<ref name=\"Superman #699 June 2010\"/>\n\nHe is a biological creature that has altered his body to acquire more knowledge to become \"better\". With his ship, his vast knowledge, and his powerful technology, Brainiac has captured thousands of cities and has assimilated and destroyed just as many civilizations, making him the worst mass murderer in the history of the Milky Way<ref>''R.E.B.E.L.S.'' (vol. 2) #19 (August 2010)</ref> and one of the most feared beings in the known universe. He is considered one of the most powerful villains Superman has ever faced.\n\n===''The New 52''===\nBrainiac, in ''[[The New 52]]'', seems to have kept most of the powers and equipment of his Post-''Crisis'' incarnation (including his shrinking ray, force fields, and robot army), with notable additions. Brainiac's ship has been massively upgraded in this incarnation; it is now larger than the entire Earth & Moon planet system,<ref>Pak, Greg (w). ''Action Comics Annual'' vol. 2 #3 (August 2014), DC Comics</ref> and carries within it a massive invasion fleet of many types of smaller ships. He still appears to possess the physical strength and near-invulnerability of his Post-''Crisis'' counterpart, as shown when he easily defeats the [[Zor-El|Cyborg Superman]].<ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 6) #24 (December 2013).</ref> By the ''[[Superman: Doomed]]'' story arc, Brainiac has used his twelfth-level intellect to become an enormously powerful psychic and telepath, augmented by the minds that he has stolen and digitized from across the galaxy, and capable of taking control of all seven billion minds on Earth at the same time. He also demonstrates considerable reality-warping abilities; he claims that the combined psionic power of all the minds he has captured throughout the universe can allow him to change reality to his will, and plans to use this power to remake the universe in his image. However, this plan is prematurely ended when Superman battles him telepathically and crashes his ship into a black hole.\n\nFollowing the ''Doomed'' story arc, it is further revealed that the Pre-''Crisis'' Brainiac somehow escaped the Crisis on Infinite Earths itself, and mutated from the various crises since, becoming a godly being. This version of Brainiac is nigh-omnipotent and [[omniscient]], with the ability to warp universes and time travel. Using this newfound power he either recreated or interacted with all the different iterations of himself throughout the multiverse, using his New 52 incarnation as yet another one of his many probes. He has grown so much in power that now he can collect cities from other universes at will. At the end of the ''Convergence'' story arc, Brainiac recreates the DC Multiverse.<ref>(27 May 2015). \"Decoding Convergence With Jeff King: The Finale\". ComicBook.com. Retrieved 29 May 2015.</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\nThe character has been depicted in various [[Continuity (fiction)|out-of-continuity]] stories. In the [[Amalgam Comics]] line, which was a joint venture between DC and [[Marvel Comics]], readers are introduced to [[Galactiac]], a combination of Brainiac and Marvel Comics antagonist [[Galactus]].<ref>''Challengers of the Fantastic'' #1 (June 1997)</ref> Brainiac also appears in ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'',<ref>''Superman: Red Son'' #1-3 (June\u2013August 2003)</ref> ''JLA: Shogun of Steel'',<ref>''JLA: Shogun of Steel'' (2002)</ref> and the novel ''The Last Days of Krypton'' by author [[Kevin J.

He first appears working with Luthor in 1978 to undermine Superman, eventually shrinking and bottling the city of Stalingrad. Superman defeats Brainiac soon after, but his inability to restore Stalingrad becomes his one failure and a recurring source of guilt. After his defeat, Superman has Brainiac reprogrammed in order to serve him and the Earth, and help run Superman's Global Soviet Union, a task he takes to for the next four decades. While serving Superman, Brainiac repeatedly advises him to take more drastic courses of action to resolve his problems, such as suggesting he merely invade Luthor's United States, though Superman always rebuffs his most extreme suggestions.\n\nAt the climax of the story, in 2001, Superman eventually does decide to attack the United States, and Luthor deploys a futuristic U.S. Pacific Fleet and an army of superbeings (including Wonder Woman and Doomsday) in an attempt to stop him. They are either incapacitated by Superman or cut to shreds by Brainiac's ship, and Luthor himself is yanked down deep into the recesses of the Fortress by Brainiac to be converted surgically into a Superman robot. Brainiac and Superman storm the White House after defeating all the U.S.'s defenders. They are greeted by Lois Luthor with the last weapon, a small note written by President Lex Luthor that reads, \"Why don't you just put the whole world in a bottle, Superman?\". Superman, realizing the error of his ways, is horrified by the revelation that he has essentially become another Brainiac- \"an alien bullying a less-developed species.\" He calls off the invasion, but Brainiac objects; he reveals that his twelfth-level intellect let him easily subvert any attempts at reprogramming him, and that he has never been under Superman's control. He attacks Superman with a kryptonite beam weapon, nearly killing him while boasting about how he will conquer the entire universe after finishing off all his foes on Earth. However, he is finally defeated when Luthor (having escaped surgery through undisclosed means) hacks and shuts off Brainiac from the inside. His body is promptly destroyed by Superman.\n\nIn one last act of spite, Brainiac's death automatically triggers his ship's self-destruct, which, according to Luthor, would eradicate the entire Earth and everything within a 15,000,000 mile radius. As the gravitational singularities powering Brainiac's ship threaten to explode, Superman rockets it into outer space, where it blows up. The Earth is saved, but Superman is thought to have been caught in an explosion and killed. In the epilogue at Lex Luthor's funeral a thousand years in the future, it is revealed that unbeknownst to the rest of the Earth, Superman survived the destruction of Brainiac's ship. He walks quietly away from the ceremony, planning to live among humans rather than ruling over them.\n\n===''JLA: Earth-2''===\nIn the ''[[JLA: Earth 2]]'' one-shot, the Justice League are drawn to the anti-matter universe to defeat the [[Crime Syndicate of America]], their villainous anti-matter counterparts, with Brainiac apparently acting as the robotic servant of Ultraman. However, after the Syndicate travel to the League's universe, it is revealed that the true mastermind of the scheme was Brainiac, who is revealed to be an organic life form trapped in a tank acting as Ultraman's servant, having manipulated both teams into a position where they will be trapped in each other's worlds and thus unable to win, as the nature of each world means that 'good' and 'evil' will always win in each world. However, Brainiac is defeated when the League deliberately walks away so that the Syndicate can return in time to stop him.\n\n===''Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again''===\nIn ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', set in a world where heroes have been publicly 'retired' for years as Lex Luthor took over and blackmailed assorted heroes into acting as his discreet 'servants', Brainiac is working with Luthor to keep the city of Kandor contained, the two destroying one Kryptonian family each time Superman defies them. He is eventually destroyed by Lara, the daughter of Superman and Wonder Woman, who claims to be surrendering to him only to allow [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|the Atom]] to break the bottle from inside and allow the Kryptonians within to access their powers, decimating Brainiac with their heat vision.<ref>''Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again'' #1-3 (November 2001-July 2002)</ref>\n\n===Bizarro Brainiac===\n[[Bizarro]] #1 created this doppelganger of Brainiac to live on Bizarro World.

Kid Flash then allows himself to be recaptured by Brainiac and put into stasis. Kid Flash uses his super-speed in the virtual reality access port to shut down the security program and Hot Pursuit then blasts Brainiac from behind. While they used his orb energy to return to the past, Brainiac impaled Hot Pursuit and attacked Kid Flash. Hot Pursuit breaks the orb energy projector to allow Kid Flash's super-speed to return. Kid Flash then returns to the 21st century, promising to rescue Hot Pursuit from Brainiac.<ref>''Flashpoint: Kid Flash Lost'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>\n\n===''Justice League/Power Rangers''===\nBrainiac is one of the villains in the ''Justice League/[[Power Rangers]]'' crossover, when the Power Rangers and [[Lord Zedd]] accidentally travel to the DC Universe through a teleportation accident, with the Rangers arriving in Gotham City,<ref>''Justice League/Power Rangers'' #1</ref> while Zedd finds himself in one of the trapped cities on Brainiac's ship. Escaping from the bottle, Zedd proposes an alliance with Brainiac in exchange for providing Brainiac with a city from his Earth, Zedd releasing a wave of monsters across the world to distract the Justice League.<ref>''Justice League/Power Rangers'' #2</ref> Using the distraction of Zedd's monsters, Brainiac dispatches his drones to take control of the Rangers' zords, stealing their powers and fleeing back to their world, forcing the Rangers and the Justice League to 'borrow' the [[Hadron Collider]] to create a temporary dimensional transporter that will allow them all to get back to the Rangers' world.<ref>''Justice League/Power Rangers'' #3</ref> Back in the Rangers' world, Brainiac nearly takes control of Cyborg, but [[Billy Cranston]] is able to regain his powers in time to take Cyborg down<ref>''Justice League/Power Rangers'' #4</ref> so that Batman can reboot him. Brainiac has captured Alpha 5, officially to question him as the only other example of independent artificial sentience he has ever met, but Alpha, although speculating that Brainiac abducted him because the villain is lonely, rejects the idea that the two are similar, arguing that Brainiac's actions show a selfishness and an inability to grow where true sentience relies on making oneself open to working with others. After regaining their powers, the Rangers are able to rescue Alpha and force Brainiac into retreat.<ref>''Justice League/Power Rangers'' #5</ref>\n\n===''Adventures of Supergirl''===\nIn the ''Adventures of Supergirl'' comic, which takes place in the universe of the ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' TV series, a very different version of Vril Dox appears as a recurring villain. In this series, he is a greedy, green-skinned alien hacker from the planet Yod who was hired by an as-yet-unknown individual to frame Supergirl's ally Winn Schott for funding and aiding terrorism. When Supergirl accesses Winn's computer, he presents himself falsely as an A.I. system called V.R.I.L., and pretends to be a creation of Schott's. He figures out Supergirl's real identity and plans to expose her, then he electrocutes her ally [[Jimmy Olsen|James Olsen]] from through Winn's computer. Eventually, Vril is tracked down by Supergirl with the aid of Winn and an expert hacker he knew, and Supergirl easily defeated him, after which he was arrested.<ref>''Adventures of Supergirl'' #2 (print) (or ''Adventures of Supergirl'' #4-5 (digital))</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n====Live-action====\n* [[James Marsters]] primarily played Brainiac in  ''[[Smallville]]'', while additional portrayals have also been done by [[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]] ([[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Jonathan Kent]] in season five), [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]] ([[Lionel Luthor]] in season seven), [[Laura Vandervoort]] (Kara Zor-El in season seven) and [[Allison Mack]] (Chloe Sullivan in season eight). Acting as a central antagonist for seasons five and seven and a supporting villain for season eight, Brainiac is mostly referred to by his assumed name of \"'''Milton Fine'''\", but [[Jor-El]] refers to him as the '''BRAIN InterActive Construct'''. The ''Smallville'' interpretation is similar to the [[DC animated universe]] version; a self-aware computer in humanoid form with a Kryptonian origin who had a part in the planet's destruction (having destabilized Krypton's core alongside Zod) but is portrayed as a [[shapeshifting]] AI created by [[Jax-Ur|Dax-Ur]] (who abandoned the project) and completed by Jor-El but corrupted by [[General Zod|Zod]]. Introduced in season five (though alluded in the season four finale where he was part of the Ship carrying the Disciples of Zod), he first appears under the Milton Fine name, posing as a history professor at (fictional) Central Kansas A&M University and presenting himself as a Kryptonian ally to trick [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] into releasing Zod. Proclaiming Jor-El was a murderer and the one who infected Mrs. Kent with a virus while Zod was the hero of all Krypton. But after Clark learns the truth, Brainiac fights off with his own Kryptonian-esque powers and then manipulates [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] into creating a 'vaccine' that will make Luthor's body suitable to act as Zod's new host after temporarily shutting down all of Earth's electronics with a virus. Although apparently destroyed, Brainiac is restored in season seven. The weakened humanoid manipulated Clark into helping regain his full power by locating Dax-Ur, to which he killed by downloading his creator's memories before convincing Luthor that Clark is a threat by impersonating [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]] and revealing Clark's secret identity to Luthor, but is defeated in battle by Clark and seemingly killed. However, Brainiac returns in season eight, possessing [[Chloe Sullivan]] to use as a means of unleashing [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] through [[Davis Bloome]] on Earth, as part of Zod's contingency plan. The [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] assist Clark in extracting Brainiac from Chloe and taking him to the future, but are too late to stop him from releasing Doomsday. A [[Brainiac 5|reprogrammed version]] of Brainiac returns in season ten from the future, offering Clark advice on his future growth as a superhero. \n** An alternate version of Brainiac/Milton Fine appears in the season seven episode \"Apocalypse\". Living in a universe, where Kal-El never arrived on Earth, Brainiac became [[Chief of Staff]], under President Lex Luthor (whom he secretly prepared to become the vessel for Zod) and alongside Kara Zor-El (under the name \"Agent Danvers\"). When the appearance of Kal-El from another universe exposed Brainiac to those around him, Lex shot him and Kara and activated a [[Nuclear football]] to destroy most of the planet to remake it. With his directives of destroying humanity and with Lex becoming the vessel for Zod, Brainiac was about to kill Clark, when Jor-El brought Clark back to his native reality.\n\n* In ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', there is a villainess called [[Brainiac 8|Indigo]], who comes from the planet [[Colu]], debuting in episode \"Solitude\". While the original Brainiac does not appear in the series, his name is mentioned, as stated that she is \"a member of the Brainiac clan\" implying a possible existence of Superman's enemy in the show. Also, another Coluan named [[Brainiac 5]] is a member of a superhero team from the 31st century called the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. In the episode, \"Battles Lost and Won\", Brainiac 5 reveals that, in preventing the Blight from spreading its virus in the future, it has restored the original Brainiac in the future, who now seeks to destroy all AIs, forcing Brainiac 5 to remain in the 21st Century while [[Mon-El]] and Winn Schott return to the future to battle Brainiac. \n\n* Brainiac appears as the main antagonist of the first season and supporting antagonist of ''[[Krypton (TV series)|Krypton]]'', portrayed by [[Blake Ritson]] (as well as Krypton's religious figure the \"Voice of Rao\", which Brainiac corrupted). <ref name=\"November2017Casting\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1721259/syfys-krypton-just-cast-classic-superman-villain-brainiac-and-more|title=Syfy's ''Krypton'' Just Cast Classic Superman Villain Brainiac And More|date=November 19, 2017|first=Nick|last=Venable|website=Cinema Blend|accessdate=May 5, 2018}}</ref> Throughout Season 1, Brainiac, known by the Kryptonians as the \"Collector of Worlds\", finds Krypton and seeks to destroy it thus ensuring Superman never exist. This resulted in his grandfather [[Seg-El]] and a resistance to fight against Brainiac along with the appearance of a time-displaced General Dru-Zod and the result of an exiled Val-El. After Seg and others failed to ensure Kandor and Krypton's survival, Zod makes a bargain with him to hand over Val-El whose use of the Phantom Zone is able to glimpse the future. As Brainiac and Dru-Zod enter Val-El's secret lab, Brainiac approaches Val to demonstrate that \"Val\" was actually a hologram by waving his hand through him, indicating that he was not tricked. To do so however, he had to step onto the portal to the Phantom Zone, which Seg-El then triggered, banishing Brainiac into the Phantom Zone and saving all of Krypton, though Seg himself is drawn into the portal with Brainiac which results in Seg hearing Brainiac in his mind. The character, sporting a look similar to his post-2008 incarnation, was created via a combination of extensive makeup/prosthetics (which took four to seven hours to apply) and CGI.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/02/21/heres-your-first-look-superman-villain-brainiac-syfy-prequel-series-krypton/357351002/ Here's your first look at Superman villain Brainiac on the Syfy prequel series 'Krypton'.] USA News.</ref>\n\n====Animation====\n* Brainiac made his first television appearance in six episodes of the [[Filmation]] [[animated series]] ''[[The New Adventures of Superman (TV series)|The New Adventures of Superman]]'', voiced by Cliff Owens. In this series, Brainiac was from the planet Mega whose entire population had perished in a series of atomic wars with the exception of one survivor, Professor Hecla. Hecla created Brainiac and sent him to Earth to use his shrinking ray to create a sort of \"cosmic [[Noah's Ark]]\", by shrinking a male and female of each Earth species to take back to repopulate Mega. Brainiac appeared in several episodes of this series, which began in 1966.\n\n* Brainiac would resurface as a member of the [[Legion of Doom]] in ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'' [[cartoon]] voiced by [[Ted Cassidy]].\n** Brainiac also appeared in a ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'' short episode \"Superclones\". He ended up making clones of [[Aquaman]] and [[El Dorado (Super Friends)|El Dorado]]. He was voiced by [[Stanley Ralph Ross]], who took over for the late Cassidy in 1980.\n** The mechanical version of Brainiac appeared in ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' in the episodes \"The Wrath of Brainiac\" and \"The Village of Lost Souls\" again voiced by [[Stanley Ralph Ross]]. In \"The Wrath of Brainiac\", Brainiac reveals that he shed his earlier appearance when he worked alongside Darkseid.\n** Brainiac next appeared in ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' episode called \"Brain Child\", once again voiced by [[Stanley Ralph Ross]].\n\n* Brainiac appears in the DC Animated Universe, voiced primarily by [[Corey Burton]].[[File:Brainiac(STAS).jpg|thumb|upright|Brainiac as depicted in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''.]]\n** In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Brainiac is first depicted as the supercomputer that runs most of the day-to-day operations on the planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. He heeds [[Jor-El]]'s warning about Krypton's imminent destruction. But rather than validate Jor-El's claims, he dismisses them as false while secretly working to save himself. As he contains Krypton's collective knowledge, Brainiac reasons that should he inform the government, they would put him to work to stop the inevitable and ultimately doom both parties. Brainiac survives Krypton's destruction after downloading his programming into a satellite and creating an android body for himself. He then traveled to other planets and assimilated their information before destroying them, claiming that the fewer beings who possess the knowledge, the more precious it becomes. In \"Stolen Memories\", Brainiac makes his way to Earth under the pretense of a peaceful exchange of knowledge with [[Lex Luthor]]. Superman, however, discovers Brainiac's true intentions to betray Luthor and destroy Earth, and eventually seemingly kills Brainiac by destroying his ship. In \"Ghost in the Machine\", it is revealed that Brainiac downloaded his programming into [[LexCorp]]'s computers during his last encounter with Superman. He then forces Luthor to build him a new android body. When Superman arrives to save Luthor, Brainiac is ultimately defeated when the Man of Steel magnetises his body so that the attracted metal would overwhelm him. In \"Knight Time\", Brainiac used nanites to control Bruce Wayne, having Bruce use [[Wayne Enterprises]]' technology to construct a ship that can leave Earth. However, Brainiac's plan was once again foiled after Superman destroyed both Brainiac and his ship. In \"New Kids in Town\", a futuristic era version of Brainiac traveled back to the past from the year 2979 to kill a teenage version of Clark Kent before the youth's future. But due to the efforts of [[Cosmic Boy]], [[Chameleon Boy]] and [[Saturn Girl]], Clark defeated Brainiac and teleported him into the Sun, incinerating the supercomputer.\n** Brainiac returns in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series. In the episode \"Twilight\", he and [[Darkseid]] harass Superman. He first appears attacking after [[Apokolips]] had suffered a major defeat by New Genesis, prompting Darkseid to head to ask the [[Justice League]] for help. The story was a ruse, however, one intended to lure the League, Superman in particular, to Brainiac's headquarters. Brainiac's full plan was to extract Superman's DNA so that he could create a mighty organic body for himself, however, Darkseid betrayed Brainiac. During the subsequent battle, [[Batman]]'s attempts lead to both the artificial intelligence and the Lord of Apokolips being destroyed.\n** Brainiac also appears in ''[[Static Shock]]''. In the [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] episode \"A League of Their Own\", Brainiac is reduced to a single circuit board kept in stasis but escaped confinement following a [[power failure]] at the Justice League's [[Justice League Watchtower|Watchtower]]. [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] and Gear had been recruited by the League to help recharge the Watchtower's generators. During that time, Brainiac slowly began gaining control of the Watchtower. He sent the League a fake distress call to lure them away, then attempted to dispose of Static and Gear before turning the Watchtower into his new body. The two teen superheroes discovered his plan and alerted the League to return. Brainiac had managed to download his mind into Gear's Backpack, taking control of [[Rick Stone (comics)|Richie Foley]] (voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]) to once more recreate his body and his mission. Static and the Justice League were able to fry Brainiac's hardware temporarily, allowing Richie to be freed and for Brainiac's base to self-destruct. Brainiac's voice here sounds quite different; the producers of ''Static Shock'' decided to pitch Corey Burton's voice significantly lower for their show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jl.toonzone.net/brainiac/brainiac.htm |title=Brainiac |publisher=Jl.toonzone.net |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}</ref> [[File:Lexiac.jpg|thumb|upright|Brainiac combined with [[Lex Luthor]] as seen in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]\n** Brainiac also appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. The android is briefly seen in the animated adaptation of \"For The Man Who Has Everything\" as a household robot (voiced by [[Mike Farrell]]). The season one finale revealed a major plot twist where a nanotech piece of Brainiac had been integrated with Lex Luthor (call-back to the Superman episode \"Ghost in the Machine\"), subtly influencing Luthor's decisions, curing his host's kryptonite cancer and giving him superhuman strength. He intended to put his mind into Luthor's duplicate of [[A.M.A.Z.O.]] made from [[Project Cadmus|Cadmus]] [[nanotechnology]], revealing himself only after being thwarted by [[Amanda Waller]] and the seven founding Justice League members. Brainiac tries to digitize the League, but the [[Martian Manhunter]] escapes and stops this. As the two escape, Brainiac's goal to record all knowledge in the universe and destroy all of creation is undermined by Luthor, pointing out his lack of imagination. Lex offers to show him a purpose beyond the mere fulfillment of his programming, to remake the universe to their preferences. Using alien nanotechnology, Brainiac turns into an exosuit that merges with Luthor; the fused character's appearance (also voiced by [[Clancy Brown]]) is inspired by the Silver Age Brainiac. He also creates duplicates modeled after the [[Justice Lords]] to distract the League. Though he defeats the League, the two are taken down when the [[Wally West|Flash]] then taps into the [[Speed Force]] and purges Brainiac from Luthor's body, leaving nothing left. However, the final season reveals Brainiac's consciousness survives and is able to communicate with Luthor as a sort of [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]]; it is never made clear if the hallucination is actually Brainiac or merely a figment of Lex's imagination. Obsessed with regaining their lost \"godhood\", Luthor joins the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] in order to obtain a piece of Brainiac in [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s possession, subsequently usurping Grodd's place as the Secret Society's leader, and even sacrifices various Secret Society supervillains during an internal showdown, all to bring Brainiac's fragment back online. Returning to the task of resurrecting Brainiac, Luthor hooks [[Tala (comics)|Tala]] up to a machine to gather Brainiac's essence from the remains of Brainiac's ship with Darkseid, killing Tala in the process, but ends up reviving Darkseid fused with Brainiac technology, and Brainiac's presence is removed from Luthor's mind.\n\n*Brainiac 1.0 appears in the second season of ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'', voiced again by [[Corey Burton]]. [[Brainiac 5]] is a descendant of him who is an unwanted robot on his home planet. In the second-season episode \"Message in a Bottle\", Brainiac 5 reveals the past atrocities caused by his predecessor, one such atrocity being the shrinking and abduction of the Kryptonian city of Kandor; in this version, Kandor was also the location of a device that kept Krypton's planet core stable, and thus by abducting the city, Brainiac ensured the demise of Krypton. In the two-part finale of the series \"Dark Victory\", Brainiac 1.0's programming takes control of Brainiac 5. He turns against his team, destroys [[Imperiex]], and has a grand plan to bring order to the universe. To do this, he uses forbidden Coluan technology that transforms matter, living beings, and entire worlds into digital information to be stored inside his database. With help from Superman and Kell-El merged inside his mind, he is ultimately destroyed by Brainiac 5, but in the end, he survives and starts rebuilding himself as Brainiac 6. While the ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' television series does not share the same continuity as the [[DC Animated Universe]], this version of Brainiac is also voiced by Corey Burton and shares the same musical [[leitmotif]] from his DCAU appearances.\n\n* Brainiac is featured in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Richard McGonagle]]. Brainiac's earliest outfit (albeit with slight modification) as a Coluan is seen in the episode \"The Siege of Starro!\" Pt. 2 as a trophy in the spaceship of the [[Faceless Hunters|Faceless Hunter]] (the minion/herald of [[Starro]]). In \"Battle of the Superheroes!\", Brainiac shows up at the end of the episode, following Lex Luthor's defeat, plotting to shrink Metropolis in order to repopulate his destroyed planet, causing Batman and Superman to spring into action.\n\n* Brainiac makes a cameo appearance in the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' animated series. In the episode \"Laundry Day\", [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] heads to his room to get a new body while the current one is in the wash; Brainiac's body is one of the choices, but Cyborg dismisses it, saying that it is \"too brainy\".\n\n* In ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'' episode \"SuperRabbit\", [[Marvin the Martian]] portrays Brainiac.\n\n* Brainiac appears in ''[[Justice League Action]]'', voiced by [[John de Lancie]].<ref>{{cite tweet|user=johndelancie|author=John de Lancie|number=783185537574199296|date=4 October 2016|title=@DaChangeling Yes that is true.}}</ref> He is mostly similar to the early Silver Age version of the character, being an alien scientist who shrinks and bottles cities for his collection; he also wears an outfit similar to his post-2008 counterpart, though he lacks other aspects of that version such as stoicism and superhuman strength/durability. Unique to JLA, this version is shown to have a wider top part of his head. In \"Plastic Man Saves The World\", Brainiac attempted to take Metropolis to add to his collection, adapting his drones to the Justice League's attacks. However, he failed to consider Plastic Man being able to sneak aboard his ship multiple times and destroy his ship before it could fire its shrinking ray. After the ray was destroyed, Brainiac updated his data banks to make Plastic Man a higher-level threat to him and swore vengeance. In \"Battle for the Bottled City\", Brainiac returned in a hover tank, roving around the Fortress of Solitude to regain the bottle city of Kandor. As Superman traveled inside the bottle city, Atom and Cyborg were left to protect the Fortress, which Brainiac easily infiltrates. He incapacitated Cyborg, destroyed several [[Superman robots]], and seemingly kills the Atom, but Atom revealed that he merely shrank and commandeered one of the remaining Superman robots, using it to pick up and toss Brainiac's tank. Though Brainiac defeated the Atom, their battle uncorked the bottle of Kandor, allowing Superman (still small-sized) to beat up Brainiac and defeat him once again.\n\n===Film===\n\n====Live action====\n* During the early development of ''[[Superman III]]'', [[Ilya Salkind]] wrote a script in that Brainiac was featured as the main antagonist.<ref>{{cite web| title=s3_original_idea.pdf| format=PDF| date=| url= http://meatfighter.com/superman3/part4/s3_original_idea.pdf |accessdate=2012-05-05}}</ref> However, when [[Leslie Newman]] and [[David Newman (screenwriter)|David Newman]] rewrote the script, Brainiac was cut from the film.

Most notably, the villain was featured with Doomsday in [[Kevin Smith]]'s version of the script, which was later discarded by director [[Tim Burton]]. Burton's own script included Brainiac's intellect bonding with Lex Luthor, as would later happen in ''Justice League Unlimited'' (and which had previously been seen in the comic book story ''[[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]'')<ref>{{Cite book | last=Hughes | first=David | title=The Greatest Sci-Fi Films Never Made | publisher=Titan Books | isbn=1-84023-428-8 | pages=176\u2013179 | chapter=The Death of Superman Lives | year=2002}}</ref>\n* In 2007, film director [[Bryan Singer]] reported that he wanted to use Brainiac, along with [[Bizarro (comics)|Bizarro]], as an antagonist in the cancelled ''[[Superman Returns#Unproduced sequel|Superman: The Man of Steel]]'', the planned sequel to ''[[Superman Returns]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=by Steve 'Frosty' Weintraub |url=http://collider.com/bryan-singer-exclusive-video-interviews-at-the-2007-saturn-awards/ |title=Bryan Singer \u2013 Exclusive Video Interviews at the 2007 Saturn Awards |publisher=Collider |date=2007-05-11 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}</ref> However, the project was finally scrapped by [[Warner Bros.]]\n* Brainiac has been suggested as \"definitely down the road\" as a villain in the [[DC Extended Universe]] and future ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' sequels by director [[Zack Snyder]]. There are nods to Brainiac in ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' such as the skull shape of the codex, the tentacles attached to the World Engine, and [[General Zod]] experiencing sensory overloads when exposed to Earth's atmosphere, similar to Brainiac's weakness.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jay Jayson |url=http://comicbook.com/2015/07/03/metallo-was-originally-planned-as-villain-in-man-of-steel-sequel/ |title=Metallo Was Originally Planned As Villain In Man Of Steel Sequel |publisher=Comicbook.com |date=2016-03-25 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}</ref>\n\n====Animation====\n* Brainiac appears as the titular antagonist in the 2006 [[direct-to-video]] animated feature ''[[Superman: Brainiac Attacks]]'' voiced by [[Lance Henriksen]]. The movie begins with Brainiac landing on Earth in a [[meteor]]. Brainiac goes around absorbing information until Superman destroys him with his Arctic-breath. However, Lex Luthor is able to save a piece of Brainiac and forms an alliance with the Kryptonian robot. Luthor gives Brainiac a new body, made from his satellite weapon. Brainiac is also equipped with a kryptonite beam and the ability to track Superman by his Kryptonian [[DNA]]. Luthor and Brainiac's bargain revolves around Brainiac using his new body to destroy Superman, and afterwards, Brainiac would allow himself to be \"defeated\" by Luthor and leave for another planet so that Luthor would appear as a hero. However, Brainiac betrayed Luthor after he believed Superman was destroyed, but in the end, Superman returned to defeat Brainiac after a lengthy battle. This time, Superman made sure that this copy of Brainiac was completely destroyed.\n* Brainiac appears as the main antagonist in the animated film ''[[Superman: Unbound]]'', based on the story arc [[Brainiac (story arc)|''Superman: Brainiac'']] by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank. Brainiac is voiced by [[John Noble]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Molly-Quinn-Supergirl-1050007.aspx |title=Castle's Molly Quinn Gets Animated as Supergirl |work=TV Guide |date=July 16, 2012 |accessdate=July 20, 2012}}</ref> Originally a scientist on his home world of Colu, Vril Dox became obsessed with learning everything there was to know in the universe. He subjected himself to extensive genetic and cybernetic enhancements, transforming his Coluan body into the towering cyborg the universe would come to know as Brainiac. He constructed a ship, designed to interface with his cybernetic implants and become an extension of his own body and will, and began to travel through space, absorbing information on other planets and civilizations. A flaw in his cybernetic brain made Brainiac incapable of accepting that, since living planets were always changing and civilizations evolving, learning everything was impossible. To remedy this, Brainiac created an army of robotic soldiers he would use to attack cities on inhabited planets, killing anyone they deemed redundant, before using a special force field projector to shrink the cities down to the size of a model he would keep stored on his ship. After capturing a city from a planet, Brainiac would launch a missile he called a Solar Aggressor into the planet's sun, causing it to go supernova and consume the rest of the planet, preventing any new data from ever entering the universe. To prevent his prisoners from trying to escape, Brainiac used his robots to maintain the cities and quell any signs of rebellion. After capturing the city of Kandor on the planet Krypton, Brainiac detected activity in the planet's core that showed the world was about to explode on its own, and thus saved himself the trouble of using a Solar Aggressor. This would ultimately prove to be his undoing.\n* Brainiac makes a cameo appearance in the animated film ''[[Lego Batman: The Movie - DC Super Heroes Unite]]'', an adaptation of the video game of the [[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes|same name]], with Troy Baker reprising his role.\n* Brainiac appears in ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Cosmic Clash]]'', voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]. This version miniaturizes, bottles and collects entire planets, rather than cities. He plans to do so to Earth in order to complete his collection. He uses a weapon to scatter Superman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern throughout time to support his plans. Although Batman and Flash succeed in sending their fellow Justice Leaguers to the present and Cyborg and Supergirl manage to slow down Brainiac's forces, Brainiac succeeds in shrinking and bottling Earth. However, the League use a massive mech to release Earth and restore it to its normal size. Feeling he has no purpose, Brainiac sets himself to self-destruct. Due to the large blast radius, Batman convinces Brainiac to collect coins to avoid Brainiac from detonating. Brainiac is then arrested and put in prison.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/nycc-lego-heroes-return-in-justice-league-cosmic-clash |title=NYCC: LEGO Heroes Return in \"Justice League: Cosmic Clash\" |publisher=Comicbookresources.com |date=October 11, 2015 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}</ref>\n* Brainiac appears as the final villain in ''[[DC Super Hero Girls: Intergalactic Games]]'', voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. He appears as the mastermind behind [[Lena Luthor]]. After she fails to kill the heroes, Brainiac leave her to drown and use the robots (including Platinum, one of the [[Metal Men]]) she used to build himself a giant body with all weapons needed to counter the superheroes' powers. His robotic body is destroyed with the combined efforts of the heroes through Platinum, who sacrifices herself to destroy him. However at the end, he is still alive and takes off to places unknown.\n* Brainiac appears as the main antagonist of the animated film ''[[Superman: Red Son (film)|Superman: Red Son]]'', based on the graphic novel of the same name. Brainiac is voiced by [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]].\n\n===Video games===\n* Brainiac served as the final boss in the ''[[Superman (arcade game)|Superman]]'' arcade game published by [[Taito Corporation]] in 1988.\n* Brainiac was the final boss in the 1992 Sunsoft game ''[[Superman (Sunsoft game)|Superman]]''.\n* In ''[[Superman 64]]'', Brainiac from the [[DCAU]] appears not only as a level boss, but also as a playable character in multiplayer. However, when the player faces Brainiac in the game's final level, Brainiac simply stands in place unless the player attempts to use heat vision on him.\n* Superman was forced to stop Brainiac and save the world after Brainiac kidnapped [[Lois Lane]] in the [[Sega Master System]] and [[Sega Genesis]] video game ''Superman: Man of Steel''.\n* In the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] video game ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel (2002 video game)|Superman: Man of Steel]]'', Brainiac 13 is the game's final boss. Players must compete against B13 drones throughout the game, before facing the android on the final level.\n* Brainiac was featured in the concept art in the console versions and as a main boss in the Nintendo DS version of  ''[[Superman Returns (video game)|Superman Returns]]'', looking vastly different from other incarnations.\n* Brainiac is a featured in the video game ''[[Justice League Heroes]]'' voiced by [[Peter Jessop]]. In the game, Brainiac first invaded [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] and ordered a huge legion of robots to seal off the area. Batman and Superman head for S.T.A.R. Labs, destroy Brainiac's robots, and battle Brainiac. Later the League infiltrates his underground fortress on earth and engages Brainiac in combat. Brainiac, defeated, is later resurrected/possessed by the villain [[Darkseid]].\n* [[Corey Burton]] reprises his role as Brainiac in ''[[DC Universe Online]]''. Here, Brainiac returns to Earth and both superheroes and other supervillains of the DC universe appeal to a truce to combat Brainiac. He is also (indirectly) the source of the player characters' powers, as a future version of Lex Luthor used his technology to create \"exobytes\", highly advanced [[nanorobots]] with the ability to infuse an organic host with superpowers. Brainiac also appears to be able to create Avatars and Sub-Avatars from the digitized information on superhuman powers, enormous robots that use technological, meta- or magical abilities.\n* In the video game ''[[Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure]]'', Brainiac is the secret leader of the supervillains and the main antagonist. With the help of the Scribblenauts' Doppelg\u00e4nger, he wants to use the Starites and Lily's globe to summon and merge with the other 51 Brainiacs and become a \"perfect\" being. He unites with other DC Comics villains to obtain the Starites, each failing to do so. When the Justice League arrives, he hacks Cyborg and uses [[Lex Luthor]], the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], [[Harley Quinn]], the [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]], [[Professor Zoom]], the [[Ocean Master]] and the [[Sinestro Corps]] to fight their respective nemeses, again, each failing. When the Justice League reach Brainiac, he steals Lily's globe, adds the last Starite, teleports the Justice League away and puts his plan into action. After betraying Doppelganger, Brainiac and his clones begin to merge. Maxwell manages to summon alternate versions of the Justice League to defeat him and retrieve the globe.\n\n====''Injustice'' series====\n* Brainiac makes a cameo appearance in the IOS/Android versions of ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' as a support card.\n* Brainiac appears as the central antagonist and a playable character in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', voiced by [[Jeffrey Combs]].<ref name=Brainiac>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/injustice_2/b/playstation4/archive/2017/01/17/latest-trailer-reveals-brainiac-robin-and-darkseid.aspx|date=2017-01-17|accessdate=2017-01-17|last=Vazquez|first=Suriel|work=[[Game Informer]]|title=Injustice 2: Latest Trailer Reveals Brainiac, Robin, And Darkseid}}</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/jeffreycombs/status/855197894730756099]</ref> This version of Brainiac has destroyed billions of populated worlds, including Krypton\u2014a departure from most versions, where he merely collects Kandor and moves on, leaving the planet to die a natural death.

Alerted to Earth and the existence of Superman, whom he believes is the last Kryptonian, after Superman's Regime kills many members of the Green Lantern Corps, Brainiac arrives on Earth to collect its cities, putting him in conflict with both the Regime and Batman's Insurgency. He conspires with Gorilla Grodd and the Society, who assist Brainiac in his invasion, though once it becomes apparent that Brainiac plans to destroy Earth the Society disbands. Gorilla Grodd continues to serve Brainiac, plotting to overthrow and kill Brainiac and take control of his ship, but is killed by [[Aquaman]] and [[Black Adam]] during the invasion of Kahndaq before he can do so. He is surprised to learn that [[Kara Zor-El]] survived the attack on Krypton alongside her cousin\u2014her ship was knocked off course and she was put into suspended animation, to later be found by Black Adam and taken in by the surviving remnants of the Regime\u2014and seeks to add her to his collection as well. The superheroes and supervillains of the Insurgency and Regime are all forced to band together in order to have a chance at stopping him. After Superman defeats Batman and the Insurgency and restores the Regime's rule over Earth, he kills Brainiac, and frees all of the warriors trapped in Brainiac's collection, giving him an army of billions of Kryptonian, Daxamite, and Czarnian soldiers to use to maintain his control over Earth. Superman also bonds with Brainiac's ship, and uses its technology to turn Batman into a mindless slave. Superman then confronts an imprisoned Supergirl, and, to her horror, threatens to do the same thing to her if she does not join the Regime. In Brainiac's own ending, the version that defeated Brainiac will turn out to be his [[Brainiac 5|descendant]]. The other characters' endings will either have Brainiac killed or handed over to the authorities. The ''Injustice'' version of Brainiac is mostly based on the post-2008 version of the character, being a genetically and cybernetically enhanced Coluan scientist with a twelfth-level intellect, his signature skull ship, an army of robotic probes, a fleet of mentally-controlled smaller ships, and the strength/durability to physically match Superman. In addition to Brainiac 5, Brainiac 6 is referenced in his pre-battle dialogue if Brainiac fights Brainiac, with one of them revealing he is the other's descendant and the other challenging him to prove his worth as an heir.\n\n====''Lego'' series====\n* Brainiac makes an appearance in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Troy Baker]]. He is seen briefly in the final scene of the main story watching Earth from an orbiting spaceship, and after witnessing [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] shoot a green beam summoning others to the planet, Brainiac mutters \"I have located it.\" Brainiac is also a boss fight and unlockable character, found in Gotham Park.\n* Brainiac appears in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'' as the main antagonist, now voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. He summons representatives of all known Lantern Corps (such as [[Sinestro]], [[Atrocitus]], [[Carol Ferris|Star Sapphire]], and [[Hal Jordan]]) in order to claim their energies, which will power a crystal that will shrink Earth. According to him, he has lost his appetite for simple cities and plans to claim entire worlds. The Justice League and the [[Legion of Doom]] defeat him on his ship, but the villain escapes as his ship crashes in Gotham. Brainiac returns once Earth is returned to normal size, mind-controlling a giant-sized Superman, but is eventually defeated and shrunk himself, placed next to Lex Luthor and the Joker in [[Arkham Asylum]]. However, Luthor inadvertently breaks the bottle holding him, freeing him once again, after which Brainiac, as shown with a clenched fist, prepares to vengefully attack them.\n* Dee Bradley Baker reprises his role for a brief cameo in ''[[Lego Dimensions]]''. Brainiac is summoned to [[Middle-Earth]] by the [[Riddler]] to battle the heroes with mind-controlled Orcs.\n<!--* Brainiac will appear as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]''.-->\n* Brainiac appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', with Corey Burton reprising his role from the [[DC Animated Universe]]. When [[Gorilla Grodd]], [[Killer Frost]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], and the Rookie travel to [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], they look for something to get into [[Outer space|space]] suggesting Brainiac's ship. Brainiac's unlocked by collecting his token in the final level, \"[[Darkseid]] of the Moon.\"\n\n===Web series===\nBrainiac appears in the second episode of ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters Chronicles]]'' (a companion to ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]''), voiced by [[Tara Strong]]. This version is depicted as a contingency plan set by [[Doctor Sivana]] to take down [[Chris Kent (comics)|Superman]]. Brainiac is shown to have lost control over his immeasurable psychic powers, creating an energy dome around himself in Metropolis. The effects are shown to take down attack helicopters and send cars flying. As stated by his creator, only a small nuclear warhead could stop him, or Superman. Superman shows up and penetrates the dome, seeing Brainiac for who he is: a crying, blue-skinned child with three diodes on his head, missing his left arm. Despite his attempts to reason with him and talk Brainiac into controlling his powers, Superman reluctantly kills Brainiac with his heat vision to put him out of his misery, much to his regret.\n\n===Books===\n* Brainiac appears in ''The Last Days of Krypton'', a novel by [[Kevin J. Anderson]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> This version of Brainiac is known as the Brain InterActive Construct, later renamed Brainiac by Commissioner Zod. Brainiac had admired the beauty and architecture of Kandor, and wanted to preserve the city from destruction should disaster strike [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] as it did on his home planet of Colu. Zod permitted Brainiac's taking of Kandor, stating that Brainiac could have the city, as the rest of Krypton belonged to him. Brainiac's ship fired three lasers that pummeled the surrounding crust around Kandor and literally upheaved the city from Krypton's surface. A [[force shield|force field]] was then erected around the city which contracted, shrinking the city and its inhabitants. Brainiac departed without causing further destruction or seizing other Kryptonian cities.\n* Brainiac (referred to again as \"The Collector of Worlds\") is introduced in issue #20 of the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' comic series, based off the show.<ref>''Young Justice'' (vol. 2) #20 (November 2012)</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{DCDP|Brainiac}}\n* {{Dcauw|Brainiac}}\n\n{{Superman characters}}\n{{Justice League}}\n{{Supergirl}}\n{{Superfriends series}}\n{{Legion of Super-Heroes}}\n{{Justice League characters}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brainiac (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Animated series villains]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1958]]\n[[Category:DC Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:DC Comics robots]]\n[[Category:DC Comics telepaths]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional androids]]\n[[Category:Fictional artificial intelligences]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can duplicate themselves]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with spirit possession or body swapping abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional computers]]\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional robots]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Fictional shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Fictional technopaths]]\n[[Category:Kryptonians]]\n[[Category:Robot supervillains]]\n[[Category:Robots in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional amorphous creatures]]\n[[Category:Fictional professors]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Otto Binder]]\n[[Category:Fictional cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n", "name_user": "Red dwarf", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNew Krypton", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainiac_(character)"}

Agham also reported that at least 670 kilograms worth of fish and other local marine products will be affected for each hectare of mangrove forests that will be destroyed.

ADS-B data can be recorded and downloaded for post-flight analysis. ADS-B also provides the data infrastructure for inexpensive flight tracking, planning, and dispatch.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nUsing \"ADS-B Out\", each aircraft periodically broadcasts information about itself, such as identification, current position, altitude and velocity, through an onboard transmitter.

This information includes altitude, heading, speed, and distance to aircraft. In addition to receiving position reports from ADS-B out participants, TIS-B [USA-only] can provide position reports on non ADS-B out-equipped aircraft if suitable ground equipment and ground radar exist. ADS-R re-transmits ADS-B position reports between UAT and 1090&nbsp;MHz frequency bands.\n# Weather&nbsp;\u2014 Aircraft equipped with universal access transceiver (UAT) ''ADS-B In'' technology will be able to receive weather reports, and weather radar through flight information service-broadcast (FIS-B). [USA-only]\n# Flight information&nbsp;\u2014 Flight information service-broadcast (FIS-B) also transmits readable flight information such as [[temporary flight restrictions]] (TFRs) and [[NOTAM]]s to aircraft equipped with UAT. [USA-only]\n# Expense&nbsp;\u2014 ADS-B ground stations are significantly cheaper to install and operate compared to primary and secondary radar systems used by ATC for aircraft separation and control.\n\nUnlike some alternative in-flight weather services currently being offered commercially, there will be no subscription fees to use ADS-B services or its various benefits in the US. The aircraft owner will pay for the equipment and installation, while the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) will pay for administering and broadcasting all the services related to the technology.\n\n===Safety===\n;Situational awareness\nADS-B makes flying significantly safer for the aviation community by providing pilots with improved [[situational awareness]]. Pilots in an ADS-B In equipped cockpit will have the ability to see, on their in-cockpit flight display, other traffic operating in the airspace as well as access to clear and detailed weather information. They will also be able to receive pertinent updates ranging from temporary flight restrictions to runway closings.\n\n;Improved visibility\nEven aircraft only equipped with ADS-B Out will benefit from air traffic controllers' ability to more accurately and reliably monitor their position. When using this system both pilots and controllers will see the same radar picture. Other fully equipped aircraft using the airspace around them will be able to more easily identify and avoid conflict with an aircraft equipped with ADS-B Out. With past systems such as the traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS) aircraft could only see other aircraft equipped with the same technology. With ADS-B, information is sent to aircraft using ADS-B In, which displays all aircraft in the area, if they are equipped with ADS-B Out. ADS-B provides better surveillance in fringe areas of radar coverage. ADS-B does not have the siting limitations of radar. Its accuracy is consistent throughout the range.<ref>{{Citation | first = Randy | last = Babbitt | title = Speech | publisher = Aero Club of Metro Atlanta | date = 5 May 2011}} (FAA Administrator).</ref> In both forms of ADS-B (1090ES & 978&nbsp;MHz UAT), the position report is updated once per second.

The 1090ES system transmits two different kinds of position reports (even/odd) randomly.

UAT will allow aircraft equipped with \"out\" broadcast capabilities to be seen by any other aircraft using ADS-B&nbsp;In technology as well as by FAA ground stations. Aircraft equipped with ADS-B In technology will be able to see detailed altitude and vector information from other ADS-B Out equipped aircraft as well as FIS-B and TIS-B broadcasts. The FIS-B broadcast will allow receiving aircraft to view weather and flight service information including [[Airmen's Meteorological Information|AIRMET]]s, [[Significant Meteorological Information|SIGMET]]s, [[Meteorological Aerodrome Report|METAR]]s, SPECI, national [[NEXRAD]], regional NEXRAD, D-NOTAMs, FDC-NOTAMs, [[Pilot report|PIREP]]s, special use airspace status, terminal area forecasts, amended [[terminal aerodrome forecast]]s (TAFs), and [[Winds aloft|winds and temperatures aloft forecast]]s.<ref name = \"ReferenceA\">{{Citation | publisher = ITT | title = FIS-B Product Summary | date = 25 January 2011}}</ref> These broadcasts serve to provide early adopters of the technology with benefits as an incentive for more pilots to use the technology before 2020. Aircraft receiving traffic information through the TIS-B service will see other aircraft in a manner that is similar to how all aircraft will be seen after they have equipped by 2020. The availability of a non-subscription weather information service, FIS-B, provides general aviation users with a useful alternative to other monthly or annual fee-based services.\n\nThe UAT system is specifically designed for ADS-B operation. UAT is also the first link to be certified for \"radar-like\" ATC services in the United States. Since 2001 it has been providing {{convert|5|nmi|abbr=on}} en-route separation (the same as mosaic radar but not {{convert|3|nmi|abbr=on}} of single-site sensors) in Alaska. UAT is the only ADS-B link standard that is truly bidirectional: UAT users have access to ground-based aeronautical data (FIS-B) and can receive reports from proximate traffic (TIS-B) through a multilink gateway service that provides ADS-B reports for 1090ES-equipped aircraft and non-ADS-B equipped radar traffic. UAT equipped aircraft can also observe each other directly with high accuracy and minimal latency. Viable ADS-B UAT networks are being installed as part of the United States' NextGen air traffic system.\n\n====1090 MHz extended squitter====\n[[File:Homemade 1090 MHz ADS-B dipole antenna.jpg|thumbnail|right|A simple homemade antenna can receive 1090 MHz signals.]]\nIn 2002 the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) announced a dual link decision using the 1090&nbsp;MHz [[Secondary surveillance radar#Extended squitter|extended squitter]] (1090&nbsp;ES) link for air carrier and private or commercial operators of high-performance aircraft, and universal access transceiver link for the typical general aviation user.<ref name=\"APA 27-02\" /> In November 2012, the [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] confirmed that the European Union would also use 1090&nbsp;ES for interoperability.<ref>{{cite web|title=Approval requirements for Air&nbsp;\u2014 Ground Data Link and ADS&nbsp;\u2014 B in support of Interoperability requirements|url=http://www.easa.europa.eu/rulemaking/docs/crd/2012/CRD%202012-19.pdf|publisher=[[European Aviation Safety Agency]]|date=21 November 2012}}</ref> The format of extended [[squitter]] messages has been codified by the ICAO.<ref name=\"icao9871b\" />\n\nWith 1090&nbsp;ES, the existing [[Air traffic control radar beacon system#Mode S|Mode S]] transponder ([[Technical Standard Order|TSO]] C-112 or a standalone 1090&nbsp;MHz [[transmitter]]) supports a message type known as the extended squitter message. It is a periodic message that provides position, velocity, time, and, in the future, intent. The basic ES does not offer intent since current flight management systems do not provide such data (called trajectory change points). To enable an aircraft to send an extended squitter message, the transponder is modified (TSO C-166A<ref>{{Citation | title = Regulatory & guidance library | contribution = TSO C\u2010166A | publisher = [[FAA]] | location = [[United States of America|US]] | url = http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgtso.nsf/0/3039f623d71c99f186257261006959e9/$FILE/TSO-C166A.pdf | format = PDF}}</ref>) and aircraft position and other status information is routed to the transponder. ATC ground stations and aircraft equipped with [[traffic collision avoidance system]] (TCAS) already have the necessary 1090&nbsp;MHz (Mode S) receivers to receive these signals, and would only require enhancements to accept and process the additional extended squitter information. As per the FAA ADS-B link decision, and the technical link standards, 1090&nbsp;ES does not support FIS-B service.<ref name=\"APA 27-02\" />\n\n===Relationship to surveillance radar===\nRadar directly measures the range and bearing of an aircraft from a ground-based [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]. The primary surveillance radar is usually a pulse radar. It continuously transmits high power radio frequency (RF) pulses. Bearing is measured by the position of the rotating radar antenna when it receives the RF pulses that are reflected from the aircraft skin. Range is measured by measuring the time it takes for the RF energy to travel to and from the aircraft.\n\n[[Radar configurations and types|Primary surveillance radar]] does not require any cooperation from the aircraft. It is robust in the sense that surveillance outage failure modes are limited to those associated with the ground radar system. [[Secondary surveillance radar]] depends on active replies from the aircraft. Its failure modes include the [[Transponder (aviation)|transponder]] aboard the aircraft. Typical ADS-B aircraft installations use the output of the navigation unit for navigation and for cooperative surveillance, introducing a common [[failure mode]] that must be accommodated in air traffic surveillance systems.<ref name=\"do-242a\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Type !! Independent? !!

Additionally, detecting changes in aircraft velocity requires several radar sweeps that are spaced several seconds apart. In contrast, a system using ADS-B creates and listens for periodic position and intent reports from aircraft. These reports are generated based on the aircraft's navigation system, and distributed via one or more of the ADS-B data links. The accuracy of the data is no longer susceptible to the position of the aircraft or the length of time between radar sweeps.<ref name=\"APA 27-02\">{{cite press release|title=FAA Announces Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Architecture |publisher=FAA Office of Public Affairs |date=1 July 2002 |url=http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=5520&print=go |id=APA 27-02 |access-date=21 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022201516/http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=5520&print=go |archivedate=22 October 2012 }}</ref> (However, the signal strength of the signal received from the aircraft at the ground station is still dependent on the range from the aircraft to the receiver, and interference, obstacles, or weather could degrade the integrity of the received signal enough to prevent the digital data from being decoded without errors. When the aircraft is farther away, the weaker received signal will tend to be more affected by the aforementioned adverse factors and is less likely to be received without errors. Error detection will allow errors to be recognized, so the system maintains full accuracy regardless of aircraft position when the signal can be received and decoded correctly. This advantage does not equate to total indifference to the range of an aircraft from the ground station.)\n\nToday's [[air traffic control]] (ATC) systems do not rely on coverage by a single radar. Instead a multiradar picture is presented via the ATC system's display to the [[Air traffic controller|controller]]. This improves the quality of the reported position of the aircraft, provides a measure of redundancy, and makes it possible to verify the output of the different radars against others. This verification can also use sensor data from other technologies, such as ADS-B and [[multilateration]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Relationship to ADS-A/ADS-C===\nThere are two commonly recognized types of ADS for aircraft applications:\n* ADS-addressed (ADS-A), also known as ADS-Contract (ADS-C)\n* ADS-broadcast (ADS-B)\n\nADS-A is based on a negotiated one-to-one peer relationship between an aircraft providing ADS information and a ground facility requiring receipt of ADS messages. For example, ADS-A reports are employed in the [[Future Air Navigation System]] (FANS) using the [[Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System]] (ACARS) as the communication protocol. During flight over areas without radar coverage, ''e.g.'', oceanic and polar, reports are periodically sent by an aircraft to the controlling air traffic region.<ref name=\"do-242a\" />\n\nThe transmission delay caused by protocol or satellites is significant enough that significant aircraft separations are required. The cost of using the satellite channel leads to less frequent updates. Another drawback is that no other aircraft can benefit from the transmitted information as ACARS information is not re-broadcast from ground facilities to other aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Traffic information service \u2013 broadcast (TIS\u2013B)===\n{{main|Traffic information service \u2013 broadcast}}\nTraffic information service \u2013 broadcast (TIS\u2013B) supplements ADS-B's air-to-air services to provide complete situational awareness in the cockpit of all traffic known to the ATC system. TIS\u2013B is an important service for an ADS-B link in airspace where not all aircraft are transmitting ADS-B information.

In terminal areas, where both types of ADS-B link are in use, ADS-B/TIS-B ground stations use ground-to-air broadcasts to relay ADS-B reports received on one link to aircraft using the other link.<ref name=\"scardina\" />\n\nAlthough multilink \"solves\" the issue of heavy airliners working on one frequency vs. light aircraft, the dual frequency nature of the system has several potential issues:\n\n* Since two aircraft on two different ADS-B frequencies must use a ground station to talk to each other, this introduces the ground station as a point of failure, although to be fair, the 1090 signal is dependent secondary radar scans in any case (and thus cannot operate without a ground station).\n* The time taken to traverse the full path from one aircraft, to the ground station, then to the second aircraft adds delay to the signal. This contrasts with two autonomous ADS-B transceivers on UAT, which have a shorter and shorter delay as they converge.\n* Aircraft are frequently out of the range of ground based radar due to altitude. Radar can be blocked by mountains, and typically is not useful for coverage near an airport unless that airport has radar. Thus, approach, departure, and especially taxi/ground based operations are compromised (a major selling point of the system).\n\nBecause of the issues with multilink, many ADS-B manufacturers are designing ADS-B systems as dual-frequency capable.\n\n==={{Visible anchor|Flight information services-broadcast (FIS-B)}}===\nFIS-B provides weather text, weather graphics, NOTAMs, [[Automatic terminal information service|ATIS]], and similar information. FIS-B is inherently different from ADS-B in that it requires sources of data external to the aircraft or broadcasting unit, and has different performance requirements such as periodicity of broadcast.<ref name=\"do-242a\" />\n\nIn the United States, FIS-B services will be provided over the UAT link in areas that have a ground surveillance infrastructure.<ref name = \"scardina\" />\n\nAnother potential aircraft-based broadcast capability is to transmit aircraft measurements of meteorological data.{{Citation needed | date = January 2011}}\n\n== In the United States ==\nAlthough the aviation industry is subject to variations in demand as economic conditions fluctuate, the long-term trend is a steady increase in traffic and as a result delay and congestion continue to build in the United States' busiest airports and the surrounding [[airspace]]. The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] must not only address current congestion, but also be poised to handle future demand that will surely return as the nation's economy improves. The FAA has been developing the Next-Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) for the purpose of changing the way the [[National Airspace System]] (NAS) operates. NextGen will allow the NAS to expand to meet future demand and support the economic viability of the system. In addition, NextGen will improve safety and support environmental initiatives such as reducing congestion, noise, emissions, and fuel consumption through increased energy efficiency.<ref name = \"freeflightsystems.com\">{{Citation | title = Final Rule for ADS\u2010B Out | format = PDF | publisher = [[Federal Aviation Administration]] | date = 28 May 2010 | url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-05-28/pdf/2010-12645.pdf}}</ref>\n\nADS-B is an essential part of the planned NextGen airspace upgrade and will create better [[Instrument flight rules#Separation and clearance|aircraft visibility]] at a lower overall cost than before. ADS-B equipment is built to meet one of two sets of US government standards, DO-260B and DO-282B.\n\nBy 2020, all aircraft operating in the US airspaces listed below will be required to carry equipment that produces an ADS-B Out broadcast.\n\nThe FAA has published a rule requiring ADS-B transmitters in many types of airspace (ADS-B Out) to take effect on 1 January 2020, but there is no mandate for ADS-B In, which receives data and provides it to in-cockpit displays.<ref>{{Citation | title = Flight planning | contribution = Next gen to guide you gate to gate | date = 2 November 2011 | publisher = AOPA | url = http://www.aopa.org/flightplanning/articles/2011/110228nextgen_to_guide_you_gate_to_gate.html | type = article}}</ref> The FAA airspace requirements intentionally exclude some airspace that is frequently used by general aviation.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Companies have already begun selling and developing aircraft hardware systems to allow general aviation aircraft owners to equip at an affordable cost.\n\nSince the FAA has passed its final ruling on ADS-B, the uncertainty that prevented companies from producing hardware has been removed. The industry is seeing products being developed for all price points, low to high, and competitively priced equipment is nearing approval. As the technology matures more features are also becoming available creating even greater benefits for general aviation users.\n\n===Summary of final rule===\nThis final rule will add equipage requirements and performance standards for ADS-B Out avionics. ADS-B Out broadcasts information about an aircraft through an onboard transmitter to a ground receiver. Use of ADS-B Out will move air traffic control from a radar-based system to a satellite-derived aircraft location system. Operators will have two options for equipage under this rule\u2014the 1090&nbsp;megahertz extended squitter broadcast link or the universal access transceiver broadcast link. Generally, this equipment will be required for aircraft operating in Classes A, B, and C airspace, certain Class E airspace, and other specified airspace.\n\nThe FAA has concluded that this rule will require only the performance requirements necessary for ADS-B Out. While certain requirements adopted in this rule will support some ADS-B In applications, the FAA is not adopting the higher performance standards that would enable all of the initial ADS-B In applications. Pilots should be aware that in accepting the FAA's positions regarding antenna diversity and position source accuracy, compliance with this rule alone may not enable operators to take full advantage of certain ADS-B In applications. Operators may voluntarily choose equipment that meets the higher performance standards in order to enable the use of these applications.<ref name=\"freeflightsystems.com\" />\n\nIt is claimed this system will make radar based ATC obsolete, moving the nation to a [[satellite]] derived aircraft location system.<ref name = \"freeflightsystems.com\" />\n\nThis will make ADS-B the backbone of the NextGen ATC system coming online in 2020.\n\n===Equipping aircraft===\nFleet: 250,000 GA aircraft that will need ADS-B by 2020 of which 165,000 aircraft subject to ADS-B Out (Class I and Class II aircraft that generally fly below 18 000&nbsp;feet).<ref>{{Citation | first = Timothy 'Tim' | last = Shaver | contribution = FAA Avionics Maintenance Branch Manager | title = Dealers delight in new avionics at AEA'11 | editor-first = Mett | editor-last = Thurber | date = 29 April 2011 | publisher = Avionics}}</ref> FAA forecasts an increase in the GA&nbsp;fleet from 224,172 aircraft in 2010 to 270,920 aircraft in 2031, growing an average of 0.9% per year.<ref>{{Citation|publisher=FAA |title=Forecast |type=fact sheet |date=15 February 2011 |url=http://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsId=12440%20(FAA%20Forecast%20Fact%20Sheet%20-%20Fiscal%20Years%202011-31) |contribution=Fiscal Years 2011\u201331 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922122634/http://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsId=12440%20%28FAA%20Forecast%20Fact%20Sheet%20-%20Fiscal%20Years%202011-31%29 |archivedate=22 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n;Funding resources\nRecent (April 2011) US federal legislation via House Bill for FAA re-authorization permits<ref>{{USBill|112|HR|658}} section 221 (c)</ref> an \"equipping fund\" that includes a portion for some general aviation aircraft.

[[Ground segment]] implementation and deployment is expected to begin in 2009 and be completed by 2013 throughout the [[National Airspace System]] (NAS). Airborne equipment is user-driven and is expected to be completed both voluntarily based on perceived benefits and through regulatory actions (Rulemaking) by the FAA. The cost to equip with ADS-B Out capability is relatively small and would benefit the airspace with surveillance in areas not currently served by radar. The FAA intends to provide similar service within the NAS to what radar is currently providing (5&nbsp;[[nautical mile|nmi]] en route and 3&nbsp;nmi terminal radar standards) as a first step to implementation. However, ADS-B In capability is viewed as the most likely way to improve NAS throughput and enhance capacity.{{Citation needed | date = January 2011}}\n\nIn December 2008, Acting FAA Administrator [[Robert A.

The south Florida installation, which consists of 11 ground stations and supporting equipment, is the first commissioned in the United States, although developmental systems have been online in Alaska, Arizona, and along the East Coast since 2004. The completed system will consist of 794 ground station transceivers. The December 2008 action is in compliance with a late-term [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] from [[George W.

This demands the transponder technology be scalable from the smallest aircraft to the largest aircraft to allow for 100% equipage for any given airspace. Current transponder technology is capable of equipping the larger, traditional aircraft but a new type of transponder is required for equipping into aircraft that are smaller and lighter or don't have electrical systems like the large traditionally transponder equipped aircraft. The requirements for these smaller and lighter aircraft are mainly size, weight, and power (SWAP) and transponder technology must allow for equipage of these types of aircraft to enable saturation of ADS-B for total visibility in any given airspace.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nA historical overview of FAA decision on the ADS-B link architecture for use in the [[National Airspace System]] (NAS).<ref>{{Citation|last=Scardina |first=John |title=The FAA ADS-B Link Decision |date=7 June 2002 |url=http://www.icao.int/anb/panels/acp/wg/m/M5wp/Wgm5wp/WGM510.pdf |type=overview |publisher=ICAO |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516101000/http://www.icao.int/anb/panels/acp/wg/m/M5wp/Wgm5wp/WGM510.pdf |archivedate=16 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Technical and regulatory documents==\n* ''Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards'' (MASPS)\n* ''Minimum Operational Performance Standards'' (MOPS)\n* [[DO-242A]]&nbsp;\u2014 ADS-B MASPS.

[[Aireon]] is also working on space-based ADS-B with the [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium]] satellite network, a LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellite network that was originally created to deliver phone and data service anywhere on the planet. By capturing ADS-B position data from aircraft flying below the satellite, the network will give the following capabilities:\n\n* Air traffic control using surveillance based separation standards will be possible over water, in areas that radar does not currently cover. Currently, air traffic control uses the larger procedural separation standard in oceanic and remote areas.\n* As is currently possible in radar covered areas, a position history will be available for lost aircraft, as in the case of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]].\n\nThe system only receives ADS-B on aircraft broadcasting on the 1090&nbsp;MHz frequency. This limits the system generally to airliners and business aircraft, despite the fact that small aircraft are frequently off radar due to mountains blocking the signal at low altitudes. The system could be compromised by smaller, private aircraft with exclusively belly mounted ADS-B antennas, due to the aircraft hull blocking the signal.\n\nThe rationale for using the Iridium satellite network for this new capability was due to:\n* The Iridium satellites fly very low, and thus can receive the ADS-B out signals more reliably (transponders and ADS-B were designed for ground reception).\n* Iridium satellites are replaced relatively frequently due to the increased air friction at their lower altitude, and thus lower lifespan. Thus the system would be deployed on iridium faster.\n* Iridium provides worldwide coverage, including the poles.\n\nIn September 2016, [[Aireon]] and [[FlightAware]] announced a partnership<ref name=\"aireon_flightaware\">{{cite web|url=http://aireon.com/2016/09/21/aireon-flightaware-globalbeacon/|title=Aireon and FlightAware Partner to Launch GlobalBeacon Airline Solution for ICAO Airline Flight Tracking Compliance| access-date=21 September 2016}}</ref> to provide this global space-based ADS-B data to airlines for flight tracking of their fleets and, in response to [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]], for compliance with the [[ICAO]] Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System (GADSS) requirement for airlines to track their fleets.<ref name=\"icao_gadss\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icao.int/safety/globaltracking/Pages/GADSS-Update.aspx|title= Update on GADSS-Related Global Aircraft Tracking Initiatives |access-date=21 September 2016}}</ref> In December 2016, Flightradar24, entered an agreement with Gomspace for space-based tracking in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |title=Satellite flight tracking \u2013 Flightradar24 Blog |url=https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/tag/satellite-flight-tracking/ |website=www.flightradar24.com}}</ref>\n\nSpaceX subsequently placed 66 operational and 9 spare Iridium satellites in orbit over the course of 8 launches between 14 January 2017 and 11 January 2019.

This information includes altitude, heading, speed, and distance to aircraft. In addition to receiving position reports from ADS-B out participants, TIS-B [USA-only] can provide position reports on non ADS-B out-equipped aircraft if suitable ground equipment and ground radar exist. ADS-R re-transmits ADS-B position reports between UAT and 1090&nbsp;MHz frequency bands.\n# Weather&nbsp;\u2014 Aircraft equipped with universal access transceiver (UAT) ''ADS-B In'' technology will be able to receive weather reports, and weather radar through flight information service-broadcast (FIS-B). [USA-only]\n# Flight information&nbsp;\u2014 Flight information service-broadcast (FIS-B) also transmits readable flight information such as [[temporary flight restrictions]] (TFRs) and [[NOTAM]]s to aircraft equipped with UAT. [USA-only]\n# Expense&nbsp;\u2014 ADS-B ground stations are significantly cheaper to install and operate compared to primary and secondary radar systems used by ATC for aircraft separation and control.\n\nUnlike some alternative in-flight weather services currently being offered commercially, there will be no subscription fees to use ADS-B services or its various benefits in the US. The aircraft owner will pay for the equipment and installation, while the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) will pay for administering and broadcasting all the services related to the technology.\n\n===Safety===\n;Situational awareness\nADS-B makes flying significantly safer for the aviation community by providing pilots with improved [[situational awareness]]. Pilots in an ADS-B In equipped cockpit will have the ability to see, on their in-cockpit flight display, other traffic operating in the airspace as well as access to clear and detailed weather information. They will also be able to receive pertinent updates ranging from temporary flight restrictions to runway closings.\n\n;Improved visibility\nEven aircraft only equipped with ADS-B Out will benefit from air traffic controllers' ability to more accurately and reliably monitor their position. When using this system both pilots and controllers will see the same radar picture. Other fully equipped aircraft using the airspace around them will be able to more easily identify and avoid conflict with an aircraft equipped with ADS-B Out. With past systems such as the traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS) aircraft could only see other aircraft equipped with the same technology. With ADS-B, information is sent to aircraft using ADS-B In, which displays all aircraft in the area, if they are equipped with ADS-B Out. ADS-B provides better surveillance in fringe areas of radar coverage. ADS-B does not have the siting limitations of radar. Its accuracy is consistent throughout the range.<ref>{{Citation | first = Randy | last = Babbitt | title = Speech | publisher = Aero Club of Metro Atlanta | date = 5 May 2011}} (FAA Administrator).</ref> In both forms of ADS-B (1090ES & 978&nbsp;MHz UAT), the position report is updated once per second.

UAT is intended to support not only ADS-B, but also [[Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast#Flight information services-broadcast (FIS-B)|flight information service \u2013 broadcast]] (FIS-B), [[Traffic Information Service \u2013 Broadcast|traffic information service \u2013 broadcast]] (TIS-B), and, if required in the future, supplementary ranging and positioning capabilities.<ref name = \"ads-bforga.blogspot.com\">{{Citation\n | first = Fabrice | last = Kunzi \n | url = http://ads-bforga.blogspot.com/2010/08/ads-b-avionics-architecture-1090es-and.html\n | date = 30 August 2010 | work = ADS\u2010B forga\n | title = ADS-B Avionics Architecture: 1090ES and UAT\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708022006/http://ads-bforga.blogspot.com/2010/08/ads-b-avionics-architecture-1090es-and.html\n | archivedate = 8 July 2011\n}}</ref> Due to the set of standards required for this rule, it is seen as the most effective application for general aviation users. UAT will allow aircraft equipped with \"out\" broadcast capabilities to be seen by any other aircraft using ADS-B&nbsp;In technology as well as by FAA ground stations. Aircraft equipped with ADS-B In technology will be able to see detailed altitude and vector information from other ADS-B Out equipped aircraft as well as FIS-B and TIS-B broadcasts. The FIS-B broadcast will allow receiving aircraft to view weather and flight service information including [[Airmen's Meteorological Information|AIRMET]]s, [[Significant Meteorological Information|SIGMET]]s, [[Meteorological Aerodrome Report|METAR]]s, SPECI, national [[NEXRAD]], regional NEXRAD, D-NOTAMs, FDC-NOTAMs, [[Pilot report|PIREP]]s, special use airspace status, terminal area forecasts, amended [[terminal aerodrome forecast]]s (TAFs), and [[Winds aloft|winds and temperatures aloft forecast]]s.<ref name = \"ReferenceA\">{{Citation | publisher = ITT | title = FIS-B Product Summary | date = 25 January 2011}}</ref> These broadcasts serve to provide early adopters of the technology with benefits as an incentive for more pilots to use the technology before 2020. Aircraft receiving traffic information through the TIS-B service will see other aircraft in a manner that is similar to how all aircraft will be seen after they have equipped by 2020. The availability of a non-subscription weather information service, FIS-B, provides general aviation users with a useful alternative to other monthly or annual fee-based services.\n\nThe UAT system is specifically designed for ADS-B operation. UAT is also the first link to be certified for \"radar-like\" ATC services in the United States. Since 2001 it has been providing {{convert|5|nmi|abbr=on}} en-route separation (the same as mosaic radar but not {{convert|3|nmi|abbr=on}} of single-site sensors) in Alaska. UAT is the only ADS-B link standard that is truly bidirectional: UAT users have access to ground-based aeronautical data (FIS-B) and can receive reports from proximate traffic (TIS-B) through a multilink gateway service that provides ADS-B reports for 1090ES-equipped aircraft and non-ADS-B equipped radar traffic. UAT equipped aircraft can also observe each other directly with high accuracy and minimal latency. Viable ADS-B UAT networks are being installed as part of the United States' NextGen air traffic system.\n\n====1090 MHz extended squitter====\n[[File:Homemade 1090 MHz ADS-B dipole antenna.jpg|thumbnail|right|A simple homemade antenna can receive 1090 MHz signals.]]\nIn 2002 the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) announced a dual link decision using the 1090&nbsp;MHz [[Secondary surveillance radar#Extended squitter|extended squitter]] (1090&nbsp;ES) link for air carrier and private or commercial operators of high-performance aircraft, and universal access transceiver link for the typical general aviation user.<ref name=\"APA 27-02\" /> In November 2012, the [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] confirmed that the European Union would also use 1090&nbsp;ES for interoperability.<ref>{{cite web|title=Approval requirements for Air&nbsp;\u2014 Ground Data Link and ADS&nbsp;\u2014 B in support of Interoperability requirements|url=http://www.easa.europa.eu/rulemaking/docs/crd/2012/CRD%202012-19.pdf|publisher=[[European Aviation Safety Agency]]|date=21 November 2012}}</ref> The format of extended [[squitter]] messages has been codified by the ICAO.<ref name=\"icao9871b\" />\n\nWith 1090&nbsp;ES, the existing [[Air traffic control radar beacon system#Mode S|Mode S]] transponder ([[Technical Standard Order|TSO]] C-112 or a standalone 1090&nbsp;MHz [[transmitter]]) supports a message type known as the extended squitter message. It is a periodic message that provides position, velocity, time, and, in the future, intent. The basic ES does not offer intent since current flight management systems do not provide such data (called trajectory change points). To enable an aircraft to send an extended squitter message, the transponder is modified (TSO C-166A<ref>{{Citation | title = Regulatory & guidance library | contribution = TSO C\u2010166A | publisher = [[FAA]] | location = [[United States of America|US]] | url = http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgtso.nsf/0/3039f623d71c99f186257261006959e9/$FILE/TSO-C166A.pdf | format = PDF}}</ref>) and aircraft position and other status information is routed to the transponder. ATC ground stations and aircraft equipped with [[traffic collision avoidance system]] (TCAS) already have the necessary 1090&nbsp;MHz (Mode S) receivers to receive these signals, and would only require enhancements to accept and process the additional extended squitter information. As per the FAA ADS-B link decision, and the technical link standards, 1090&nbsp;ES does not support FIS-B service.<ref name=\"APA 27-02\" />\n\n===Relationship to surveillance radar===\nRadar directly measures the range and bearing of an aircraft from a ground-based [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]. The primary surveillance radar is usually a pulse radar. It continuously transmits high power radio frequency (RF) pulses. Bearing is measured by the position of the rotating radar antenna when it receives the RF pulses that are reflected from the aircraft skin. Range is measured by measuring the time it takes for the RF energy to travel to and from the aircraft.\n\n[[Radar configurations and types|Primary surveillance radar]] does not require any cooperation from the aircraft. It is robust in the sense that surveillance outage failure modes are limited to those associated with the ground radar system. [[Secondary surveillance radar]] depends on active replies from the aircraft. Its failure modes include the [[Transponder (aviation)|transponder]] aboard the aircraft. Typical ADS-B aircraft installations use the output of the navigation unit for navigation and for cooperative surveillance, introducing a common [[failure mode]] that must be accommodated in air traffic surveillance systems.<ref name=\"do-242a\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Type !! Independent? !! Cooperative?\n|-\n| [[Radar configurations and types|Primary surveillance radar]] (PSR)\n| Yes: surveillance data derived by radar\n| No: does not depend on aircraft equipment\n|-\n| [[Secondary surveillance radar]] (SSR)\n| No: surveillance data provided by aircraft transponder\n| Yes: requires aircraft to have a working [[Air traffic control radar beacon system|ATCRBS]] transponder\n|-\n| Automatic dependent surveillance (ADS-B)\n| No: surveillance data provided by aircraft\n| Yes: requires aircraft to have working ADS-B function\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\"|Source: DO-242A<ref name=\"do-242a\" />\n|}\n\nThe radiated beam becomes wider as the distance between the antenna and aircraft becomes greater, making the position information less accurate. Additionally, detecting changes in aircraft velocity requires several radar sweeps that are spaced several seconds apart. In contrast, a system using ADS-B creates and listens for periodic position and intent reports from aircraft. These reports are generated based on the aircraft's navigation system, and distributed via one or more of the ADS-B data links. The accuracy of the data is no longer susceptible to the position of the aircraft or the length of time between radar sweeps.<ref name=\"APA 27-02\">{{cite press release|title=FAA Announces Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Architecture |publisher=FAA Office of Public Affairs |date=1 July 2002 |url=http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=5520&print=go |id=APA 27-02 |access-date=21 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022201516/http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=5520&print=go |archivedate=22 October 2012 }}</ref> (However, the signal strength of the signal received from the aircraft at the ground station is still dependent on the range from the aircraft to the receiver, and interference, obstacles, or weather could degrade the integrity of the received signal enough to prevent the digital data from being decoded without errors. When the aircraft is farther away, the weaker received signal will tend to be more affected by the aforementioned adverse factors and is less likely to be received without errors. Error detection will allow errors to be recognized, so the system maintains full accuracy regardless of aircraft position when the signal can be received and decoded correctly. This advantage does not equate to total indifference to the range of an aircraft from the ground station.)\n\nToday's [[air traffic control]] (ATC) systems do not rely on coverage by a single radar. Instead a multiradar picture is presented via the ATC system's display to the [[Air traffic controller|controller]]. This improves the quality of the reported position of the aircraft, provides a measure of redundancy, and makes it possible to verify the output of the different radars against others. This verification can also use sensor data from other technologies, such as ADS-B and [[multilateration]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Relationship to ADS-A/ADS-C===\nThere are two commonly recognized types of ADS for aircraft applications:\n* ADS-addressed (ADS-A), also known as ADS-Contract (ADS-C)\n* ADS-broadcast (ADS-B)\n\nADS-A is based on a negotiated one-to-one peer relationship between an aircraft providing ADS information and a ground facility requiring receipt of ADS messages. For example, ADS-A reports are employed in the [[Future Air Navigation System]] (FANS) using the [[Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System]] (ACARS) as the communication protocol. During flight over areas without radar coverage, ''e.g.'', oceanic and polar, reports are periodically sent by an aircraft to the controlling air traffic region.<ref name=\"do-242a\" />\n\nThe transmission delay caused by protocol or satellites is significant enough that significant aircraft separations are required. The cost of using the satellite channel leads to less frequent updates. Another drawback is that no other aircraft can benefit from the transmitted information as ACARS information is not re-broadcast from ground facilities to other aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Traffic information service \u2013 broadcast (TIS\u2013B)===\n{{main|Traffic information service \u2013 broadcast}}\nTraffic information service \u2013 broadcast (TIS\u2013B) supplements ADS-B's air-to-air services to provide complete situational awareness in the cockpit of all traffic known to the ATC system. TIS\u2013B is an important service for an ADS-B link in airspace where not all aircraft are transmitting ADS-B information. The ground TIS\u2013B station transmits surveillance target information on the ADS-B data link for unequipped targets or targets transmitting only on another ADS-B link.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nTIS\u2013B uplinks are derived from the best available ground surveillance sources:\n* ground radars for primary and secondary targets{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n* multilateration systems for targets on the airport surface<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.multilateration.com/applications/surface.html |title=Multilateration: Airport Surface |publisher=ERA a.s..|access-date=30 April 2013}}</ref>\n* ADS-B systems for targets equipped with a different ADS-B link<ref name=\"scardina\" />\n\n===Multilink gateway service===\nThe multilink gateway service is a companion to TIS-B for achieving interoperability between different aircraft equipped with 1090ES or UAT by using ground-based relay stations. These aircraft cannot directly share air-to-air ADS-B data due to the different communication frequencies. In terminal areas, where both types of ADS-B link are in use, ADS-B/TIS-B ground stations use ground-to-air broadcasts to relay ADS-B reports received on one link to aircraft using the other link.<ref name=\"scardina\" />\n\nAlthough multilink \"solves\" the issue of heavy airliners working on one frequency vs. light aircraft, the dual frequency nature of the system has several potential issues:\n\n* Since two aircraft on two different ADS-B frequencies must use a ground station to talk to each other, this introduces the ground station as a point of failure, although to be fair, the 1090 signal is dependent secondary radar scans in any case (and thus cannot operate without a ground station).\n* The time taken to traverse the full path from one aircraft, to the ground station, then to the second aircraft adds delay to the signal. This contrasts with two autonomous ADS-B transceivers on UAT, which have a shorter and shorter delay as they converge.\n* Aircraft are frequently out of the range of ground based radar due to altitude. Radar can be blocked by mountains, and typically is not useful for coverage near an airport unless that airport has radar. Thus, approach, departure, and especially taxi/ground based operations are compromised (a major selling point of the system).\n\nBecause of the issues with multilink, many ADS-B manufacturers are designing ADS-B systems as dual-frequency capable.\n\n==={{Visible anchor|Flight information services-broadcast (FIS-B)}}===\nFIS-B provides weather text, weather graphics, NOTAMs, [[Automatic terminal information service|ATIS]], and similar information. FIS-B is inherently different from ADS-B in that it requires sources of data external to the aircraft or broadcasting unit, and has different performance requirements such as periodicity of broadcast.<ref name=\"do-242a\" />\n\nIn the United States, FIS-B services will be provided over the UAT link in areas that have a ground surveillance infrastructure.<ref name = \"scardina\" />\n\nAnother potential aircraft-based broadcast capability is to transmit aircraft measurements of meteorological data.{{Citation needed | date = January 2011}}\n\n== In the United States ==\nAlthough the aviation industry is subject to variations in demand as economic conditions fluctuate, the long-term trend is a steady increase in traffic and as a result delay and congestion continue to build in the United States' busiest airports and the surrounding [[airspace]]. The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] must not only address current congestion, but also be poised to handle future demand that will surely return as the nation's economy improves. The FAA has been developing the Next-Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) for the purpose of changing the way the [[National Airspace System]] (NAS) operates. NextGen will allow the NAS to expand to meet future demand and support the economic viability of the system. In addition, NextGen will improve safety and support environmental initiatives such as reducing congestion, noise, emissions, and fuel consumption through increased energy efficiency.<ref name = \"freeflightsystems.com\">{{Citation | title = Final Rule for ADS\u2010B Out | format = PDF | publisher = [[Federal Aviation Administration]] | date = 28 May 2010 | url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-05-28/pdf/2010-12645.pdf}}</ref>\n\nADS-B is an essential part of the planned NextGen airspace upgrade and will create better [[Instrument flight rules#Separation and clearance|aircraft visibility]] at a lower overall cost than before.

Companies have already begun selling and developing aircraft hardware systems to allow general aviation aircraft owners to equip at an affordable cost.\n\nSince the FAA has passed its final ruling on ADS-B, the uncertainty that prevented companies from producing hardware has been removed. The industry is seeing products being developed for all price points, low to high, and competitively priced equipment is nearing approval. As the technology matures more features are also becoming available creating even greater benefits for general aviation users.\n\n===Summary of final rule===\nThis final rule will add equipage requirements and performance standards for ADS-B Out avionics. ADS-B Out broadcasts information about an aircraft through an onboard transmitter to a ground receiver. Use of ADS-B Out will move air traffic control from a radar-based system to a satellite-derived aircraft location system. Operators will have two options for equipage under this rule\u2014the 1090&nbsp;megahertz extended squitter broadcast link or the universal access transceiver broadcast link. Generally, this equipment will be required for aircraft operating in Classes A, B, and C airspace, certain Class E airspace, and other specified airspace.\n\nThe FAA has concluded that this rule will require only the performance requirements necessary for ADS-B Out. While certain requirements adopted in this rule will support some ADS-B In applications, the FAA is not adopting the higher performance standards that would enable all of the initial ADS-B In applications. Pilots should be aware that in accepting the FAA's positions regarding antenna diversity and position source accuracy, compliance with this rule alone may not enable operators to take full advantage of certain ADS-B In applications. Operators may voluntarily choose equipment that meets the higher performance standards in order to enable the use of these applications.<ref name=\"freeflightsystems.com\" />\n\nIt is claimed this system will make radar based ATC obsolete, moving the nation to a [[satellite]] derived aircraft location system.<ref name = \"freeflightsystems.com\" />\n\nThis will make ADS-B the backbone of the NextGen ATC system coming online in 2020.\n\n===Equipping aircraft===\nFleet: 250,000 GA aircraft that will need ADS-B by 2020 of which 165,000 aircraft subject to ADS-B Out (Class I and Class II aircraft that generally fly below 18 000&nbsp;feet).<ref>{{Citation | first = Timothy 'Tim' | last = Shaver | contribution = FAA Avionics Maintenance Branch Manager | title = Dealers delight in new avionics at AEA'11 | editor-first = Mett | editor-last = Thurber | date = 29 April 2011 | publisher = Avionics}}</ref> FAA forecasts an increase in the GA&nbsp;fleet from 224,172 aircraft in 2010 to 270,920 aircraft in 2031, growing an average of 0.9% per year.<ref>{{Citation|publisher=FAA |title=Forecast |type=fact sheet |date=15 February 2011 |url=http://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsId=12440%20(FAA%20Forecast%20Fact%20Sheet%20-%20Fiscal%20Years%202011-31) |contribution=Fiscal Years 2011\u201331 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922122634/http://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsId=12440%20%28FAA%20Forecast%20Fact%20Sheet%20-%20Fiscal%20Years%202011-31%29 |archivedate=22 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n;Funding resources\nRecent (April 2011) US federal legislation via House Bill for FAA re-authorization permits<ref>{{USBill|112|HR|658}} section 221 (c)</ref> an \"equipping fund\" that includes a portion for some general aviation aircraft.

[[Ground segment]] implementation and deployment is expected to begin in 2009 and be completed by 2013 throughout the [[National Airspace System]] (NAS). Airborne equipment is user-driven and is expected to be completed both voluntarily based on perceived benefits and through regulatory actions (Rulemaking) by the FAA. The cost to equip with ADS-B Out capability is relatively small and would benefit the airspace with surveillance in areas not currently served by radar. The FAA intends to provide similar service within the NAS to what radar is currently providing (5&nbsp;[[nautical mile|nmi]] en route and 3&nbsp;nmi terminal radar standards) as a first step to implementation. However, ADS-B In capability is viewed as the most likely way to improve NAS throughput and enhance capacity.{{Citation needed | date = January 2011}}\n\nIn December 2008, Acting FAA Administrator [[Robert A.

For 1090&nbsp;ES, both [[TCAS]] and [[ATCRBS]]/[[Secondary surveillance radar|MSSR]] are existing users of the channel. 1090&nbsp;ES ADS-B must not reduce capacity of these existing systems.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe FAA national program office and other international aviation regulators are addressing concerns about ADS-B<ref name=\"Airsport\">{{cite web | publisher = AirSport Corporation | url = http://www.airsport-corp.com/adsb2.htm | title = Will ADS-B increase safety and security for aviation? | date = August 2000 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070209222607/http://www.airsport-corp.com/adsb2.htm | archivedate = 9 February 2007 | df = dmy-all}}</ref> non-secure nature of ADS-B transmissions. ADS-B messages can be used to know the location of an aircraft, and there is no means to guarantee that this information is not used inappropriately. Additionally, there are some concerns about the integrity of ADS-B transmissions. ADS-B messages can be produced, with simple, low-cost measures, which spoof the locations of multiple phantom aircraft to disrupt safe air travel. There is no foolproof means to guarantee integrity, but there are means to monitor for this type of activity. This problem is however similar to the usage of ATCRBS/MSSR where false signals also are potentially dangerous (uncorrelated secondary tracks).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThere are some concerns about ADS-B dependence on [[Global navigation satellite system|satellite navigation systems]] to generate state vector information,<ref>{{cite web |website=USCG Navigation Center |title=Vulnerability assessment of the transportation infrastructure relying on GPS |url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/ppt/Volpe%20Slides.ppt |format=[[PPT format|PPT]] |publisher=United States Coast Guard |date=5 October 2001 |access-date=16 September 2008}}</ref> although the risks can be mitigated by using redundant sources of state vector information; e.g., [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[GLONASS]], [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] or [[multilateration]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThere are some general aviation concerns that ADS-B removes anonymity of the VFR aircraft operations.<ref name = \"Airsport\" /> The [[ICAO]] 24-bit [[Transponder (aviation)|transponder]] code specifically assigned to each aircraft will allow monitoring of that aircraft when within the service volumes of the Mode-S/ADS-B system.

This demands the transponder technology be scalable from the smallest aircraft to the largest aircraft to allow for 100% equipage for any given airspace. Current transponder technology is capable of equipping the larger, traditional aircraft but a new type of transponder is required for equipping into aircraft that are smaller and lighter or don't have electrical systems like the large traditionally transponder equipped aircraft. The requirements for these smaller and lighter aircraft are mainly size, weight, and power (SWAP) and transponder technology must allow for equipage of these types of aircraft to enable saturation of ADS-B for total visibility in any given airspace.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nA historical overview of FAA decision on the ADS-B link architecture for use in the [[National Airspace System]] (NAS).<ref>{{Citation|last=Scardina |first=John |title=The FAA ADS-B Link Decision |date=7 June 2002 |url=http://www.icao.int/anb/panels/acp/wg/m/M5wp/Wgm5wp/WGM510.pdf |type=overview |publisher=ICAO |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516101000/http://www.icao.int/anb/panels/acp/wg/m/M5wp/Wgm5wp/WGM510.pdf |archivedate=16 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Technical and regulatory documents==\n* ''Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards'' (MASPS)\n* ''Minimum Operational Performance Standards'' (MOPS)\n* [[DO-242A]]&nbsp;\u2014 ADS-B MASPS.

[[Aireon]] is also working on space-based ADS-B with the [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium]] satellite network, a LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellite network that was originally created to deliver phone and data service anywhere on the planet. By capturing ADS-B position data from aircraft flying below the satellite, the network will give the following capabilities:\n\n* Air traffic control using surveillance based separation standards will be possible over water, in areas that radar does not currently cover. Currently, air traffic control uses the larger procedural separation standard in oceanic and remote areas.\n* As is currently possible in radar covered areas, a position history will be available for lost aircraft, as in the case of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]].\n\nThe system only receives ADS-B on aircraft broadcasting on the 1090&nbsp;MHz frequency. This limits the system generally to airliners and business aircraft, despite the fact that small aircraft are frequently off radar due to mountains blocking the signal at low altitudes. The system could be compromised by smaller, private aircraft with exclusively belly mounted ADS-B antennas, due to the aircraft hull blocking the signal.\n\nThe rationale for using the Iridium satellite network for this new capability was due to:\n* The Iridium satellites fly very low, and thus can receive the ADS-B out signals more reliably (transponders and ADS-B were designed for ground reception).\n* Iridium satellites are replaced relatively frequently due to the increased air friction at their lower altitude, and thus lower lifespan. Thus the system would be deployed on iridium faster.\n* Iridium provides worldwide coverage, including the poles.\n\nIn September 2016, [[Aireon]] and [[FlightAware]] announced a partnership<ref name=\"aireon_flightaware\">{{cite web|url=http://aireon.com/2016/09/21/aireon-flightaware-globalbeacon/|title=Aireon and FlightAware Partner to Launch GlobalBeacon Airline Solution for ICAO Airline Flight Tracking Compliance| access-date=21 September 2016}}</ref> to provide this global space-based ADS-B data to airlines for flight tracking of their fleets and, in response to [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]], for compliance with the [[ICAO]] Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System (GADSS) requirement for airlines to track their fleets.<ref name=\"icao_gadss\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icao.int/safety/globaltracking/Pages/GADSS-Update.aspx|title= Update on GADSS-Related Global Aircraft Tracking Initiatives |access-date=21 September 2016}}</ref> In December 2016, Flightradar24, entered an agreement with Gomspace for space-based tracking in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |title=Satellite flight tracking \u2013 Flightradar24 Blog |url=https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/tag/satellite-flight-tracking/ |website=www.flightradar24.com}}</ref>\n\nSpaceX subsequently placed 66 operational and 9 spare Iridium satellites in orbit over the course of 8 launches between 14 January 2017 and 11 January 2019.

{"title_page": "Expert", "text_new": "{{Other uses}}\n{{short description|Person with broad and profound competence is a particular field}}\n{{more footnotes|date=March 2017|}}\n[[File:Experts Expect the Unexpected. Nubra.jpg|thumb|\"Experts Expect the Unexpected.\" Roadsign in [[Nubra Valley]], northern [[Ladakh]], India.]]\n\nAn '''expert''' is someone who has a broad and deep [[Competence (human resources)|competence]] in terms of [[knowledge]], [[skill]] and [[experience]] through practice and education in a particular field. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a [[reliabilism|reliable]] source of [[wikt:technique|technique]] or [[skill]] whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by [[Peer group|peer]]s or the [[General public|public]] in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive [[knowledge]] or [[Aptitude|ability]] based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of [[credential]]s, [[training]], [[education]], [[profession]], [[publication]] or [[experience]], to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may [[official]]ly (and [[expert witness|legally]]) rely upon the individual's [[opinion]] on that topic. Historically, an expert was referred to as a [[Wise old man|sage]] ([[Sage (Sophos)|Sophos]]). The individual was usually a profound [[Intellectual|thinker]] distinguished for [[wisdom]] and sound [[judgment]].\n\nIn specific fields, the definition of expert is well established by consensus and therefore it is not always necessary for individuals to have a professional or academic [[wikt:qualification|qualification]] for them to be accepted as an expert. In this respect, a shepherd with 50 years of experience tending flocks would be widely recognized as having complete expertise in the use and training of sheep dogs and the care of sheep. Another example from [[computer science]] is that an [[expert system]] may be taught by a human and thereafter considered an expert, often outperforming human beings at particular tasks. In [[law]], an [[expert witness]] must be recognized by [[Logical argument|argument]] and [[authority]].\n\nResearch in this area attempts to understand the relation between expert knowledge, skills and personal characteristics and exceptional performance. Some researchers have investigated the cognitive structures and processes of experts. The fundamental aim of this research is to describe what it is that experts know and how they use their knowledge to achieve performance that most people assume requires extreme or extraordinary ability. Studies have investigated the factors that enable experts to be fast and accurate.<ref name='Ericsson1989'>{{Harv|Ericsson|Stasewski|1989}}</ref>\n\n==Expertise==\nExpertise characteristics, skills and knowledge of a person (that is, expert) or of a system, which distinguish experts from novices and less experienced people. In many domains there are objective measures of performance capable of distinguishing experts from novices: expert chess players will almost always win games against recreational chess players; expert [[medical specialist]]s are more likely to diagnose a disease correctly; etc.\n\nThe word expertise is used to refer also to Expert Determination, where an expert is invited to decide a disputed issue. The decision may be binding or advisory, according to the agreement between the parties in dispute.\n\n===Academic views===\nThere are two academic approaches to the understanding and study of expertise. The first understands expertise as an emergent property of [[communities of practice]]. In this view expertise is socially constructed; tools for thinking and scripts for action are jointly constructed within social groups enabling that group jointly to define and acquire expertise in some domain.\n\nIn the second view expertise is a characteristic of individuals and is a consequence of the human capacity for extensive adaptation to physical and social environments. Many accounts of the development of expertise emphasize that it comes about through long periods of deliberate practice. In many domains of expertise estimates of 10 years' experience<ref name=\"Ericsson 2006\">{{Harv|Ericsson|Charness|Feltovich|Hoffman|2006}}</ref> deliberate practice are common. Recent research on expertise emphasizes the nurture side of the [[nature and nurture]] argument.<ref name=\"Ericsson 2006\"/> Some factors not fitting the nature-nurture dichotomy are biological but not genetic, such as starting age, handedness, and season of birth.<ref>{{Harv|Gobet|2008}}</ref><ref>{{Harv|Gobet|Chassy|2008}}</ref><ref>{{Harv|Gobet|Campitelli|2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the field of education there is a potential \"expert blind spot\" (see also [[Dunning\u2013Kruger effect]]) in newly practicing educators who are experts in their content area. This is based on the \"expert blind spot hypothesis\" researched by [[Mitchell J. Nathan|Mitchell Nathan]] and Andrew Petrosino (2003: 906). Newly practicing educators with advanced subject-area expertise of an educational content area tend to use the formalities and analysis methods of their particular area of expertise as a major guiding factor of student instruction and knowledge development, rather than being guided by student learning and developmental needs that are prevalent among novice learners.\n\nThe blind spot metaphor refers to the physiological blind spot in human vision in which perceptions of surroundings and circumstances are strongly impacted by their expectations. Beginning practicing educators tend to overlook the importance of novice levels of prior knowledge and other factors involved in adjusting and adapting pedagogy for learner understanding. This expert blind spot is in part due to an assumption that novices\u2019 cognitive schemata are less elaborate, interconnected, and accessible than experts\u2019 and that their pedagogical reasoning skills are less well developed (Borko & Livingston, 1989: 474). Essential knowledge of subject matter for practicing educators consists of overlapping knowledge domains: subject matter knowledge and pedagogical content matter (Borko, Eisenhart, Brown, Underhill, Jones, & Agard, 1992: 195). Pedagogical content matter consists of an understanding of how to represent certain concepts in ways appropriate to the learner contexts, including abilities and interests. The expert blind spot is a pedagogical phenomenon that is typically overcome through educators\u2019 experience with instructing learners over time.\n{{sfn|Borko|Livingston|1989}}{{sfn|Nathan|Petrosino|2003}}\n\n===Historical views===\nIn line with the socially constructed view of expertise, expertise can also be understood as a form of [[power (sociology)|power]]; that is, experts have the ability to influence others as a result of their defined social status. By a similar token, a fear of experts can arise from fear of an intellectual elite's power. In earlier periods of history, simply being able to read made one part of an intellectual elite. The introduction of the [[printing press]] in Europe during the fifteenth century and the diffusion of printed matter contributed to higher literacy rates and wider access to the once-rarefied knowledge of academia. The subsequent spread of education and learning changed society, and initiated an era of widespread education whose elite would now instead be those who produced the written content itself for consumption, in education and all other spheres.\n\nPlato's \"[[Noble Lie]]\", concerns expertise. Plato did not believe most people were clever enough to look after their own and society's best interest, so the few clever people of the world needed to lead the rest of the flock. Therefore, the idea was born that only the elite should know the truth in its complete form and the rulers, Plato said, must tell the people of the city \"the noble lie\" to keep them passive and content, without the risk of upheaval and unrest.\n\nIn contemporary society, doctors and scientists, for example, are considered to be experts in that they hold a body of dominant knowledge that is, on the whole, inaccessible to the layman.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Intellectual|last=Fuller|first=Steve|publisher=Icon Books|year=2005|isbn=9781840467215|location=|pages=141}}</ref> However, this inaccessibility and perhaps even mystery that surrounds expertise does not cause the layman to disregard the opinion of the experts on account of the unknown. Instead, the complete opposite occurs whereby members of the public believe in and highly value the opinion of medical professionals or of scientific discoveries,<ref name=\":0\" /> despite not understanding it.\n\n===Related research===\nA number of computational models have been developed in [[cognitive science]] to explain the development from novice to expert. In particular, [[Herbert A. Simon]] and Kevin Gilmartin proposed a model of learning in chess called MAPP (Memory-Aided Pattern Recognizer).<ref>Simon and Gilmartin (1973)</ref> Based on simulations, they estimated that about 50,000 [[chunking (psychology)#Chunking as the learning of long-term memory structures|chunks]] (units of memory) are necessary to become an expert, and hence the many years needed to reach this level. More recently, the [[CHREST|CHREST model]] (Chunk Hierarchy and REtrieval STructures) has simulated in detail a number of phenomena in chess expertise (eye movements, performance in a variety of memory tasks, development from novice to expert) and in other domains.<ref>{{Harv|Gobet|Simon|2000}}</ref><ref>{{Harv|Gobet|de Voogt|Retschitzki|2004}}</ref>\n\nAn important feature of expert performance seems to be the way in which experts are able to rapidly retrieve complex configurations of information from long-term memory. They recognize situations because they have meaning. It is perhaps this central concern with meaning and how it attaches to situations which provides an important link between the individual and social approaches to the development of expertise. Work on \"Skilled Memory and Expertise\" by [[Anders Ericsson]] and [[James J. Staszewski]] confronts the paradox of expertise and claims that people not only acquire content knowledge as they practice cognitive skills, they also develop mechanisms that enable them to use a large and familiar knowledge base efficiently.<ref name=\"Ericsson1989\" />\n\nWork on [[expert systems]] (computer software designed to provide an answer to a problem, or clarify uncertainties where normally one or more human experts would need to be consulted) typically is grounded on the premise that expertise is based on acquired repertoires of rules and frameworks for decision making which can be elicited as the basis for computer supported judgment and decision-making. However, there is increasing evidence that expertise does not work in this fashion. Rather, experts recognize situations based on experience of many prior situations. They are in consequence able to make rapid decisions in complex and dynamic situations.\n\nIn a critique of the expert systems literature {{Harvtxt|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|2005}} suggest:\n<blockquote> If one asks an expert for the rules he or she is using, one will, in effect, force the expert to regress to the level of a beginner and state the rules learned in school. Thus, instead of using rules they no longer remember, as knowledge engineers suppose, the expert is forced to remember rules they no longer use. \u2026 No amount of rules and facts can capture the knowledge an expert has when he or she has stored experience of the actual outcomes of tens of thousands of situations.<ref>{{Harv|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|2005|p=788}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Skilled memory theory====\n<ref name=\"Ericsson1989\" />\nThe role of long term memory in the skilled memory effect was first articulated by Chase and Simon in their classic studies of chess expertise. They asserted that organized patterns of information stored in long term memory (chunks) mediated experts' rapid encoding and superior retention. Their study revealed that all subjects retrieved about the same number of chunks, but the size of the chunks varied with subjects' prior experience. Experts' chunks contained more individual pieces than those of novices. This research did not investigate how experts find, distinguish, and retrieve the right chunks from the vast number they hold without a lengthy search of long term memory.\n\nSkilled memory enables experts to rapidly encode, store, and retrieve information within the domain of their expertise and thereby circumvent the capacity limitations that typically constrain novice performance. For example, it explains experts' ability to recall large amounts of material displayed for only brief study intervals, provided that the material comes from their domain of expertise. When unfamiliar material (not from their domain of expertise) is presented to experts, their recall is no better than that of novices.\n\nThe first principle of skilled memory, the ''meaningful encoding principle,'' states that experts exploit prior knowledge to durably encode information needed to perform a familiar task successfully. Experts form more elaborate and accessible memory representations than novices. The elaborate semantic memory network creates meaningful memory codes that create multiple potential cues and avenues for retrieval.\n\nThe second principle, the ''retrieval structure principle'' states that experts develop memory mechanisms called retrieval structures to facilitate the retrieval of information stored in long term memory. These mechanisms operate in a fashion consistent with the meaningful encoding principle to provide cues that can later be regenerated to retrieve the stored information efficiently without a lengthy search.\n\nThe third principle, the ''speed up principle'' states that long term memory encoding and retrieval operations speed up with practice, so that their speed and accuracy approach the speed and accuracy of short term memory storage and retrieval.\n\nExamples of skilled memory research described within the Ericsson and Stasewski study include:\n* a '''waiter''' who can accurately remember up to 20 complete dinner orders in an actual restaurant setting by using mnemonic strategy, patterns, and spatial relations (position of the person ordering). At the time of recall all items of a category (e.g., all salad dressings, then all meat temperatures, then all steak types, then all starch type) would be recalled in clockwise for all customers.\n* a '''running enthusiast''' who grouped together short random sequences of digits and encoded the groups in terms of their meaning as running times, dates, and ages. He was thus able to recall over 84% of all digit groups presented in a session totaling 200-300 digits. His expertise was limited to digits; when a switch from digits to letters of the alphabet was made he exhibited no transfer\u2014his memory span dropped back to about six consonants.\n* '''math enthusiasts''' who can in less than 25 seconds mentally solve 2 x 5 digit multiplication problems (e.g., 23 x 48,856) that have been presented orally by the researcher.\n\n====In problem solving====\nMuch of the research regarding expertise involves the studies of how experts and novices differ in solving problems (Chi, M. T. H., Glasser R., & Rees, E.,1982). Mathematics (Sweller, J., Mawer, R. F., & Ward, M. R., 1983) and physics (Chi, Feltovich, & Glaser, 1981) are common domains for these studies.\n\nOne of the most cited works in this area, Chi et al. (1981), examines how experts (PhD students in physics) and novices (undergraduate students that completed one semester of mechanics) categorize and represent physics problems. They found that novices sort problems into categories based upon surface features (e.g., keywords in the problem statement or visual configurations of the objects depicted). Experts, however, categorize problems based upon their deep structures (i.e., the main physics principle used to solve the problem).\n\nTheir findings also suggest that while the schemas of both novices and experts are activated by the same features of a problem statement, the experts\u2019 schemas contain more procedural knowledge which aid in determining which principle to apply, and novices\u2019 schemas contain mostly declarative knowledge which do not aid in determining methods for solution.\n\n====Germain's scale====\nRelative to a specific field, an expert has:\n* Specific education, training, and knowledge\n* Required qualifications\n* Ability to assess importance in work-related situations\n* Capability to improve themselves\n* Intuition\n* Self-assurance and confidence in their knowledge\n\nMarie-Line Germain (Germain, 2006) developed a psychometric measure of perception of employee expertise called the Generalized Expertise Measure (GEM). She defined a behavioral dimension in experts, in addition to the dimensions suggested by Swanson and Holton (2001). Her 16-item scale contains objective expertise items and subjective expertise items. Objective items were named Evidence-Based items. Subjective items (the remaining 11 items from the measure below) were named Self-Enhancement items because of their behavioral component.\n\n* This person has knowledge specific to a field of work.\n* This person shows they have the education necessary to be an expert in the field.\n* This person has the qualifications required to be an expert in the field.\n* This person has been trained in their area of expertise.\n* This person is ambitious about their work in the company.\n* This person can assess whether a work-related situation is important or not.\n* This person is capable of improving themselves.\n* This person is charismatic.\n* This person can deduce things from work-related situations easily.\n* This person is intuitive in the job.\n* This person is able to judge what things are important in their job.\n* This person has the drive to become what they are capable of becoming in their field.\n* This person is self-assured.\n* This person has self-confidence.\n* This person is outgoing.\n(Condensed from Germain, 2006).\n\n; References\n* Germain, M.-L.

Considered an appeal to ethos or \"the personal character of the speaker\",<ref>Aristotle. \"Rhetoric.\" Trans. W. Rhys Roberts. The Basic Works of Aristotle. Ed. Richard McKeon. New York: Modern Library, 2001. Print.</ref> established expertise allows a speaker to make statements regarding special topics of which the audience may be ignorant. In other words, the expert enjoys the deference of the audience's judgment and can appeal to authority where a non-expert cannot.\n\nIn The Rhetoric of Expertise, E. Johanna Hartelius defines two basic modes of expertise: autonomous and attributed expertise. While an autonomous expert can \"possess expert knowledge without recognition from other people,\" attributed expertise is \"a performance that may or may not indicate genuine knowledge.\" With these two categories, Hartelius isolates the rhetorical problems faced by experts: just as someone with autonomous expertise may not possess the skill to persuade people to hold their points of view, someone with merely attributed expertise may be persuasive but lack the actual knowledge pertaining to a given subject. The problem faced by audiences follows from the problem facing experts: when faced with competing claims of expertise, what resources do non-experts have to evaluate claims put before them?<ref>Hartelius, E. Johanna. The Rhetoric of Expertise. Lanham: Lexington, 2011. Print.</ref>\n\n===Dialogic Expertise===\nHartelius and other scholars have also noted the challenges that projects such as Wikipedia pose to how experts have traditionally constructed their authority. In \"Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise\", she highlights Wikipedia as an example of the \"dialogic expertise\" made possible by collaborative digital spaces. Predicated upon the notion that \"truth emerges from dialogue\", Wikipedia challenges traditional expertise both because anyone can edit it and because no single person, regardless of their credentials, can end a discussion by fiat. In other words, the community, rather than single individuals, direct the course of discussion. The production of knowledge, then, as a process of dialogue and argumentation, becomes an inherently rhetorical activity.<ref>Hartelus, E. Johanna. \"Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise.\" Southern Communication Journal 75.5 (2010). Web.</ref>\n\nHartelius calls attention to two competing norm systems of expertise: \u201cnetwork norms of dialogic collaboration\u201d and \u201cdeferential norms of socially sanctioned professionalism\u201d; Wikipedia being evidence of the first.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\">Hartelius, E. Johanna. (2011). Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise. Southern Communication Journal, Vol. 75, No. 5, Nov\u2013Dec 2010, pp. 505\u2013526.</ref> Drawing on a [[Mikhail Bakhtin|Bakhtinian framework]], Hartelius posits that Wikipedia is an example of an epistemic network that is driven by the view that individuals\u2019 ideas clash with one another so as to generate expertise collaboratively.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Hartelius compares Wikipedia's methodology of open-ended discussions of topics to that of [[Mikhail Bakhtin|Bakhtin's theory of speech communication]], where genuine [[dialogue]] is considered a live event, which is continuously open to new additions and participants.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Hartelius acknowledges that [[knowledge]], [[experience]], [[training]], [[skill]], and [[wikt:qualification|qualification]] are important dimensions of expertise but posits that the concept is more complex than sociologists and psychologists suggest.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Arguing that expertise is rhetorical, then, Hartelius explains that expertise: \u201c(...) is not simply about one person\u2019s skills being different from another\u2019s. It is also fundamentally contingent on a struggle for ownership and legitimacy.\u201d.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Effective communication is an inherent element in expertise in the same style as knowledge is. Rather than leaving each other out, substance and communicative style are complementary.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Hartelius further suggests that Wikipedia's dialogic construction of expertise illustrates both the instrumental and the constitutive dimensions of rhetoric; instrumentally as it challenges [[Encyclopedia|traditional encyclopedias]] and constitutively as a function of its knowledge production.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Going over the historical development of the encyclopedic project, Hartelius argues that changes in traditional encyclopedias have led to changes in traditional expertise. Wikipedia's use of [[hyperlink]]s to connect one topic to another depends on, and develops, electronic interactivity meaning that Wikipedia's way of knowing is dialogic.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Dialogic expertise then, emerges from multiple interactions between utterances within the [[discourse community]].<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> The ongoing dialogue between contributors on Wikipedia not only results in the emergence of truth; it also explicates the topics one can be an expert of. As Hartelius explains: \u201cThe very act of presenting information about topics that are not included in traditional encyclopedias is a construction of new expertise.\u201d.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> While Wikipedia insists that contributors must only publish preexisting knowledge, the dynamics behind dialogic expertise creates new information nonetheless. Knowledge production is created as a function of dialogue.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> According to Hartelius, dialogic expertise has emerged on Wikipedia not only because of its interactive structure but also because of the site's hortative discourse which is not found in traditional encyclopedias.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> By Wikipedia's hortative discourse, Hartelius means various encouragements to edit certain topics and instructions on how to do so that appear on the site.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> One further reason to the emergence of dialogic expertise on Wikipedia is the site's [[Wikipedia:Community portal|community pages]], which function as a techne; explicating Wikipedia's expert methodology.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/>\n\n===Networked Expertise===\n{{See also|Wisdom of the crowd}}\nBuilding on Hartelius, Damien Pfister developed the concept of \"networked expertise\". Noting that Wikipedia employs a [[Many-to-many|\"many to many\"]] rather than a \"one to one\" model of communication, he notes how expertise likewise shifts to become a quality of a group rather than an individual. With the information traditionally associated with individual experts now stored within a text produced by a collective, knowing about something is less important than knowing how to find something. As he puts it, \"With the internet, the historical power of subject matter expertise is eroded: the archival nature of the Web means that what and how to information is readily available.\" The rhetorical authority previously afforded to subject matter expertise, then, is given to those with the procedural knowledge of how to find information called for by a situation.<ref>Pfister, Damien. \"Networked Expertise in the Era of Many-to-many Communication: On Wikipedia and Invention.\" Social Epistemology: A Journal of Knowledge, Culture, and Policy 25.3 (2011). Web.</ref>\n\n==Contrasts and comparisons==\n\n===Associated terms===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}\nAn expert differs from the specialist in that a specialist has to ''be able to solve'' a [[problem]] and an expert has to ''know its solution''. The opposite of an expert is generally known as a [[layperson]], while someone who occupies a middle grade of understanding is generally known as a [[technician]] and often employed to assist experts. A person may well be an expert in one field and a layperson in many other fields. The concepts of experts and expertise are debated within the field of [[epistemology]] under the general heading of expert knowledge. In contrast, the opposite of a specialist would be a [[wikt:generalist|generalist]] or [[polymath]].\n\nThe term is widely used informally, with people being described as 'experts' in order to bolster the relative value of their opinion, when no [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] criteria for their expertise is available. The term [[crank (person)|crank]] is likewise used to disparage opinions. [[Academic elitism]] arises when experts become convinced that only their opinion is useful, sometimes on matters beyond their personal expertise.\n\nIn contrast to an expert, a [[novice]] (known [[colloquially]] as a [[newbie]] or 'greenhorn') is any person that is new to any science or field of study or activity or social cause and who is undergoing training in order to meet normal requirements of being regarded a mature and equal participant.\n\n\"Expert\" is also being mistakenly interchanged with the term \"[[authority]]\" in new media. An expert can be an authority if through relationships to people and technology, that expert is allowed to control access to his expertise. However, a person who merely wields authority is not by right an expert. In new media, users are being misled by the term \"authority\". Many sites and search engines such as Google and Technorati use the term \"authority\" to denote the link value and traffic to a particular topic. However, this authority only measures populist information. It in no way assures that the author of that site or blog is an expert.\n\n===Developmental characteristics===\nSome characteristics of the development of an expert have been found to include\n* A characterization of this practice as \"deliberate practice\", which forces the practitioner to come up with new ways to encourage and enable themselves to reach new levels of performance<ref name=\":1\" />\n* An early phase of learning which is characterized by enjoyment, excitement, and participation without outcome-related goals<ref>Janet L. Starkes, K Anders Ericsson (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=gl8nqUjyXWUC&pg=PA91 Expert Performance in Sports] Advances in Research on Sport Expertise. p. 91</ref>\n* The ability to rearrange or construct a higher dimension of creativity. Due to such familiarity or advanced knowledge experts can develop more abstract perspectives of their concepts and/or performances.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/expert|title=Definition of EXPERT|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref>\n\n==Use in literature==\n[[Mark Twain]] defined an expert as \"an ordinary fellow from another town\".<ref>[needs quotation reference]{{Citation needed|reason=Is this the right template to use?|date=November 2016}}</ref> [[Will Rogers]] described an expert as \"A man fifty miles from home with a briefcase.\" Danish scientist and Nobel laureate [[Niels Bohr]] defined an expert as \"A person that has made every possible mistake within his or her field.\"<ref name=\"Life Magazine\">{{cite magazine|last1=Robert Coughlan|first1=Quoted by Dr Edward Teller|title=Dr. Edward Teller's Magnificent Obsession|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I1QEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62#v=onepage&q&f=false|magazine=Life Magazine|accessdate=13 February 2017|date=1954-09-06}}</ref>\n[[Malcolm Gladwell]] describes expertise as a matter of practicing the correct way for a total of around 10,000 hours.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Education}}\n* {{annotated link|Perceptual learning}}\n* {{annotated link|Consultant}}\n* {{annotated link|Polymath}}\n\n===General===\n* {{annotated link|Scholar}}\n* {{annotated link|Know-how}}\n* {{annotated link|Skill}}\n* {{annotated link|Competence (human resources)|Competence}}\n* {{annotated link|Excellence}}\n* {{annotated link|Technocracy}}\n* {{annotated link|Insider}}\n* {{annotated link|Tutor expertise in adult education}}\n\n===Criticism===\n* {{annotated link|Anti-intellectualism}}\n* {{annotated link|Denialism}}\n* {{annotated link|The Death of Expertise}}\n* {{annotated link|Gibson's law}}\n\n===Psychology===\n* {{annotated link|Dreyfus model of skill acquisition}}\n* {{annotated link|Dunning\u2013Kruger effect}}\n* {{annotated link|Pygmalion effect}}\n* {{annotated link|Rational skepticism}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |ref=harv |last=Borko |first=Hilda |last2=Livingston |first2=Carol |year=1989 |title=Cognition and Improvisation: Differences in Mathematics Instruction by Expert and Novice Teachers |jstor=1162861 |journal=American Educational Research Journal |volume=Winter 1989, Vol. 26, No. 4 |issue=4 |pages=473\u2013498|doi=10.3102/00028312026004473 }}\n* {{cite book | ref=harv | last=Chase | first=W.G. | last2=Simon | first2=Herbert A. | author2-link=Herbert A.

Nubra.jpg|thumb|\"Experts Expect the Unexpected.\" Roadsign in [[Nubra Valley]], northern [[Ladakh]], India.]]\n\nAn '''expert''' is someone who has a broad and deep [[Competence (human resources)|competence]] in terms of [[knowledge]], [[skill]] and [[experience]] through practice and education in a particular field. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a [[reliabilism|reliable]] source of [[wikt:technique|technique]] or [[skill]] whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by [[Peer group|peer]]s or the [[General public|public]] in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive [[knowledge]] or [[Aptitude|ability]] based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of [[credential]]s, [[training]], [[education]], [[profession]], [[publication]] or [[experience]], to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may [[official]]ly (and [[expert witness|legally]]) rely upon the individual's [[opinion]] on that topic. Historically, an expert was referred to as a [[Wise old man|sage]] ([[Sage (Sophos)|Sophos]]). The individual was usually a profound [[Intellectual|thinker]] distinguished for [[wisdom]] and sound [[judgment]].\n\nIn specific fields, the definition of expert is well established by consensus and therefore it is not always necessary for individuals to have a professional or academic [[wikt:qualification|qualification]] for them to be accepted as an expert. In this respect, a shepherd with 50 years of experience tending flocks would be widely recognized as having complete expertise in the use and training of sheep dogs and the care of sheep. Another example from [[computer science]] is that an [[expert system]] may be taught by a human and thereafter considered an expert, often outperforming human beings at particular tasks. In [[law]], an [[expert witness]] must be recognized by [[Logical argument|argument]] and [[authority]].\n\nResearch in this area attempts to understand the relation between expert knowledge, skills and personal characteristics and exceptional performance. Some researchers have investigated the cognitive structures and processes of experts. The fundamental aim of this research is to describe what it is that experts know and how they use their knowledge to achieve performance that most people assume requires extreme or extraordinary ability. Studies have investigated the factors that enable experts to be fast and accurate.<ref name='Ericsson1989'>{{Harv|Ericsson|Stasewski|1989}}</ref>\n\n==Expertise==\nExpertise characteristics, skills and knowledge of a person (that is, expert) or of a system, which distinguish experts from novices and less experienced people. In many domains there are objective measures of performance capable of distinguishing experts from novices: expert chess players will almost always win games against recreational chess players; expert [[medical specialist]]s are more likely to diagnose a disease correctly; etc.\n\nThe word expertise is used to refer also to Expert Determination, where an expert is invited to decide a disputed issue. The decision may be binding or advisory, according to the agreement between the parties in dispute.\n\n===Academic views===\nThere are two academic approaches to the understanding and study of expertise. The first understands expertise as an emergent property of [[communities of practice]]. In this view expertise is socially constructed; tools for thinking and scripts for action are jointly constructed within social groups enabling that group jointly to define and acquire expertise in some domain.\n\nIn the second view expertise is a characteristic of individuals and is a consequence of the human capacity for extensive adaptation to physical and social environments. Many accounts of the development of expertise emphasize that it comes about through long periods of deliberate practice. In many domains of expertise estimates of 10 years' experience<ref name=\"Ericsson 2006\">{{Harv|Ericsson|Charness|Feltovich|Hoffman|2006}}</ref> deliberate practice are common. Recent research on expertise emphasizes the nurture side of the [[nature and nurture]] argument.<ref name=\"Ericsson 2006\"/> Some factors not fitting the nature-nurture dichotomy are biological but not genetic, such as starting age, handedness, and season of birth.<ref>{{Harv|Gobet|2008}}</ref><ref>{{Harv|Gobet|Chassy|2008}}</ref><ref>{{Harv|Gobet|Campitelli|2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the field of education there is a potential \"expert blind spot\" (see also [[Dunning\u2013Kruger effect]]) in newly practicing educators who are experts in their content area. This is based on the \"expert blind spot hypothesis\" researched by [[Mitchell J. Nathan|Mitchell Nathan]] and Andrew Petrosino (2003: 906). Newly practicing educators with advanced subject-area expertise of an educational content area tend to use the formalities and analysis methods of their particular area of expertise as a major guiding factor of student instruction and knowledge development, rather than being guided by student learning and developmental needs that are prevalent among novice learners.\n\nThe blind spot metaphor refers to the physiological blind spot in human vision in which perceptions of surroundings and circumstances are strongly impacted by their expectations. Beginning practicing educators tend to overlook the importance of novice levels of prior knowledge and other factors involved in adjusting and adapting pedagogy for learner understanding. This expert blind spot is in part due to an assumption that novices\u2019 cognitive schemata are less elaborate, interconnected, and accessible than experts\u2019 and that their pedagogical reasoning skills are less well developed (Borko & Livingston, 1989: 474). Essential knowledge of subject matter for practicing educators consists of overlapping knowledge domains: subject matter knowledge and pedagogical content matter (Borko, Eisenhart, Brown, Underhill, Jones, & Agard, 1992: 195). Pedagogical content matter consists of an understanding of how to represent certain concepts in ways appropriate to the learner contexts, including abilities and interests. The expert blind spot is a pedagogical phenomenon that is typically overcome through educators\u2019 experience with instructing learners over time.\n{{sfn|Borko|Livingston|1989}}{{sfn|Nathan|Petrosino|2003}}\n\n===Historical views===\nIn line with the socially constructed view of expertise, expertise can also be understood as a form of [[power (sociology)|power]]; that is, experts have the ability to influence others as a result of their defined social status. By a similar token, a fear of experts can arise from fear of an intellectual elite's power. In earlier periods of history, simply being able to read made one part of an intellectual elite. The introduction of the [[printing press]] in Europe during the fifteenth century and the diffusion of printed matter contributed to higher literacy rates and wider access to the once-rarefied knowledge of academia. The subsequent spread of education and learning changed society, and initiated an era of widespread education whose elite would now instead be those who produced the written content itself for consumption, in education and all other spheres.\n\nPlato's \"[[Noble Lie]]\", concerns expertise. Plato did not believe most people were clever enough to look after their own and society's best interest, so the few clever people of the world needed to lead the rest of the flock. Therefore, the idea was born that only the elite should know the truth in its complete form and the rulers, Plato said, must tell the people of the city \"the noble lie\" to keep them passive and content, without the risk of upheaval and unrest.\n\nIn contemporary society, doctors and scientists, for example, are considered to be experts in that they hold a body of dominant knowledge that is, on the whole, inaccessible to the layman.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Intellectual|last=Fuller|first=Steve|publisher=Icon Books|year=2005|isbn=9781840467215|location=|pages=141}}</ref> However, this inaccessibility and perhaps even mystery that surrounds expertise does not cause the layman to disregard the opinion of the experts on account of the unknown. Instead, the complete opposite occurs whereby members of the public believe in and highly value the opinion of medical professionals or of scientific discoveries,<ref name=\":0\" /> despite not understanding it.\n\n===Related research===\nA number of computational models have been developed in [[cognitive science]] to explain the development from novice to expert. In particular, [[Herbert A. Simon]] and Kevin Gilmartin proposed a model of learning in chess called MAPP (Memory-Aided Pattern Recognizer).<ref>Simon and Gilmartin (1973)</ref> Based on simulations, they estimated that about 50,000 [[chunking (psychology)#Chunking as the learning of long-term memory structures|chunks]] (units of memory) are necessary to become an expert, and hence the many years needed to reach this level. More recently, the [[CHREST|CHREST model]] (Chunk Hierarchy and REtrieval STructures) has simulated in detail a number of phenomena in chess expertise (eye movements, performance in a variety of memory tasks, development from novice to expert) and in other domains.<ref>{{Harv|Gobet|Simon|2000}}</ref><ref>{{Harv|Gobet|de Voogt|Retschitzki|2004}}</ref>\n\nAn important feature of expert performance seems to be the way in which experts are able to rapidly retrieve complex configurations of information from long-term memory. They recognize situations because they have meaning. It is perhaps this central concern with meaning and how it attaches to situations which provides an important link between the individual and social approaches to the development of expertise. Work on \"Skilled Memory and Expertise\" by [[Anders Ericsson]] and [[James J. Staszewski]] confronts the paradox of expertise and claims that people not only acquire content knowledge as they practice cognitive skills, they also develop mechanisms that enable them to use a large and familiar knowledge base efficiently.<ref name=\"Ericsson1989\" />\n\nWork on [[expert systems]] (computer software designed to provide an answer to a problem, or clarify uncertainties where normally one or more human experts would need to be consulted) typically is grounded on the premise that expertise is based on acquired repertoires of rules and frameworks for decision making which can be elicited as the basis for computer supported judgment and decision-making. However, there is increasing evidence that expertise does not work in this fashion. Rather, experts recognize situations based on experience of many prior situations. They are in consequence able to make rapid decisions in complex and dynamic situations.\n\nIn a critique of the expert systems literature {{Harvtxt|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|2005}} suggest:\n<blockquote> If one asks an expert for the rules he or she is using, one will, in effect, force the expert to regress to the level of a beginner and state the rules learned in school. Thus, instead of using rules they no longer remember, as knowledge engineers suppose, the expert is forced to remember rules they no longer use. \u2026 No amount of rules and facts can capture the knowledge an expert has when he or she has stored experience of the actual outcomes of tens of thousands of situations.<ref>{{Harv|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|2005|p=788}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Skilled memory theory====\n<ref name=\"Ericsson1989\" />\nThe role of long term memory in the skilled memory effect was first articulated by Chase and Simon in their classic studies of chess expertise. They asserted that organized patterns of information stored in long term memory (chunks) mediated experts' rapid encoding and superior retention. Their study revealed that all subjects retrieved about the same number of chunks, but the size of the chunks varied with subjects' prior experience. Experts' chunks contained more individual pieces than those of novices. This research did not investigate how experts find, distinguish, and retrieve the right chunks from the vast number they hold without a lengthy search of long term memory.\n\nSkilled memory enables experts to rapidly encode, store, and retrieve information within the domain of their expertise and thereby circumvent the capacity limitations that typically constrain novice performance. For example, it explains experts' ability to recall large amounts of material displayed for only brief study intervals, provided that the material comes from their domain of expertise. When unfamiliar material (not from their domain of expertise) is presented to experts, their recall is no better than that of novices.\n\nThe first principle of skilled memory, the ''meaningful encoding principle,'' states that experts exploit prior knowledge to durably encode information needed to perform a familiar task successfully. Experts form more elaborate and accessible memory representations than novices. The elaborate semantic memory network creates meaningful memory codes that create multiple potential cues and avenues for retrieval.\n\nThe second principle, the ''retrieval structure principle'' states that experts develop memory mechanisms called retrieval structures to facilitate the retrieval of information stored in long term memory. These mechanisms operate in a fashion consistent with the meaningful encoding principle to provide cues that can later be regenerated to retrieve the stored information efficiently without a lengthy search.\n\nThe third principle, the ''speed up principle'' states that long term memory encoding and retrieval operations speed up with practice, so that their speed and accuracy approach the speed and accuracy of short term memory storage and retrieval.\n\nExamples of skilled memory research described within the Ericsson and Stasewski study include:\n* a '''waiter''' who can accurately remember up to 20 complete dinner orders in an actual restaurant setting by using mnemonic strategy, patterns, and spatial relations (position of the person ordering). At the time of recall all items of a category (e.g., all salad dressings, then all meat temperatures, then all steak types, then all starch type) would be recalled in clockwise for all customers.\n* a '''running enthusiast''' who grouped together short random sequences of digits and encoded the groups in terms of their meaning as running times, dates, and ages. He was thus able to recall over 84% of all digit groups presented in a session totaling 200-300 digits. His expertise was limited to digits; when a switch from digits to letters of the alphabet was made he exhibited no transfer\u2014his memory span dropped back to about six consonants.\n* '''math enthusiasts''' who can in less than 25 seconds mentally solve 2 x 5 digit multiplication problems (e.g., 23 x 48,856) that have been presented orally by the researcher.\n\n====In problem solving====\nMuch of the research regarding expertise involves the studies of how experts and novices differ in solving problems (Chi, M. T. H., Glasser R., & Rees, E.,1982). Mathematics (Sweller, J., Mawer, R. F., & Ward, M. R., 1983) and physics (Chi, Feltovich, & Glaser, 1981) are common domains for these studies.\n\nOne of the most cited works in this area, Chi et al. (1981), examines how experts (PhD students in physics) and novices (undergraduate students that completed one semester of mechanics) categorize and represent physics problems. They found that novices sort problems into categories based upon surface features (e.g., keywords in the problem statement or visual configurations of the objects depicted). Experts, however, categorize problems based upon their deep structures (i.e., the main physics principle used to solve the problem).\n\nTheir findings also suggest that while the schemas of both novices and experts are activated by the same features of a problem statement, the experts\u2019 schemas contain more procedural knowledge which aid in determining which principle to apply, and novices\u2019 schemas contain mostly declarative knowledge which do not aid in determining methods for solution.\n\n====Germain's scale====\nRelative to a specific field, an expert has:\n* Specific education, training, and knowledge\n* Required qualifications\n* Ability to assess importance in work-related situations\n* Capability to improve themselves\n* Intuition\n* Self-assurance and confidence in their knowledge\n\nMarie-Line Germain (Germain, 2006) developed a psychometric measure of perception of employee expertise called the Generalized Expertise Measure (GEM). She defined a behavioral dimension in experts, in addition to the dimensions suggested by Swanson and Holton (2001). Her 16-item scale contains objective expertise items and subjective expertise items. Objective items were named Evidence-Based items. Subjective items (the remaining 11 items from the measure below) were named Self-Enhancement items because of their behavioral component.\n\n* This person has knowledge specific to a field of work.\n* This person shows they have the education necessary to be an expert in the field.\n* This person has the qualifications required to be an expert in the field.\n* This person has been trained in their area of expertise.\n* This person is ambitious about their work in the company.\n* This person can assess whether a work-related situation is important or not.\n* This person is capable of improving themselves.\n* This person is charismatic.\n* This person can deduce things from work-related situations easily.\n* This person is intuitive in the job.\n* This person is able to judge what things are important in their job.\n* This person has the drive to become what they are capable of becoming in their field.\n* This person is self-assured.\n* This person has self-confidence.\n* This person is outgoing.\n(Condensed from Germain, 2006).\n\n; References\n* Germain, M.-L.

Considered an appeal to ethos or \"the personal character of the speaker\",<ref>Aristotle. \"Rhetoric.\" Trans. W. Rhys Roberts. The Basic Works of Aristotle. Ed. Richard McKeon. New York: Modern Library, 2001. Print.</ref> established expertise allows a speaker to make statements regarding special topics of which the audience may be ignorant. In other words, the expert enjoys the deference of the audience's judgment and can appeal to authority where a non-expert cannot.\n\nIn The Rhetoric of Expertise, E. Johanna Hartelius defines two basic modes of expertise: autonomous and attributed expertise. While an autonomous expert can \"possess expert knowledge without recognition from other people,\" attributed expertise is \"a performance that may or may not indicate genuine knowledge.\" With these two categories, Hartelius isolates the rhetorical problems faced by experts: just as someone with autonomous expertise may not possess the skill to persuade people to hold their points of view, someone with merely attributed expertise may be persuasive but lack the actual knowledge pertaining to a given subject. The problem faced by audiences follows from the problem facing experts: when faced with competing claims of expertise, what resources do non-experts have to evaluate claims put before them?<ref>Hartelius, E. Johanna. The Rhetoric of Expertise. Lanham: Lexington, 2011. Print.</ref>\n\n===Dialogic Expertise===\nHartelius and other scholars have also noted the challenges that projects such as Wikipedia pose to how experts have traditionally constructed their authority. In \"Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise\", she highlights Wikipedia as an example of the \"dialogic expertise\" made possible by collaborative digital spaces. Predicated upon the notion that \"truth emerges from dialogue\", Wikipedia challenges traditional expertise both because anyone can edit it and because no single person, regardless of their credentials, can end a discussion by fiat. In other words, the community, rather than single individuals, direct the course of discussion. The production of knowledge, then, as a process of dialogue and argumentation, becomes an inherently rhetorical activity.<ref>Hartelus, E. Johanna. \"Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise.\" Southern Communication Journal 75.5 (2010). Web.</ref>\n\nHartelius calls attention to two competing norm systems of expertise: \u201cnetwork norms of dialogic collaboration\u201d and \u201cdeferential norms of socially sanctioned professionalism\u201d; Wikipedia being evidence of the first.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\">Hartelius, E. Johanna. (2011). Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise. Southern Communication Journal, Vol. 75, No. 5, Nov\u2013Dec 2010, pp. 505\u2013526.</ref> Drawing on a [[Mikhail Bakhtin|Bakhtinian framework]], Hartelius posits that Wikipedia is an example of an epistemic network that is driven by the view that individuals\u2019 ideas clash with one another so as to generate expertise collaboratively.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Hartelius compares Wikipedia's methodology of open-ended discussions of topics to that of [[Mikhail Bakhtin|Bakhtin's theory of speech communication]], where genuine [[dialogue]] is considered a live event, which is continuously open to new additions and participants.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Hartelius acknowledges that [[knowledge]], [[experience]], [[training]], [[skill]], and [[wikt:qualification|qualification]] are important dimensions of expertise but posits that the concept is more complex than sociologists and psychologists suggest.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Arguing that expertise is rhetorical, then, Hartelius explains that expertise: \u201c(...) is not simply about one person\u2019s skills being different from another\u2019s. It is also fundamentally contingent on a struggle for ownership and legitimacy.\u201d.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Effective communication is an inherent element in expertise in the same style as knowledge is. Rather than leaving each other out, substance and communicative style are complementary.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Hartelius further suggests that Wikipedia's dialogic construction of expertise illustrates both the instrumental and the constitutive dimensions of rhetoric; instrumentally as it challenges [[Encyclopedia|traditional encyclopedias]] and constitutively as a function of its knowledge production.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Going over the historical development of the encyclopedic project, Hartelius argues that changes in traditional encyclopedias have led to changes in traditional expertise. Wikipedia's use of [[hyperlink]]s to connect one topic to another depends on, and develops, electronic interactivity meaning that Wikipedia's way of knowing is dialogic.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> Dialogic expertise then, emerges from multiple interactions between utterances within the [[discourse community]].<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> The ongoing dialogue between contributors on Wikipedia not only results in the emergence of truth; it also explicates the topics one can be an expert of. As Hartelius explains: \u201cThe very act of presenting information about topics that are not included in traditional encyclopedias is a construction of new expertise.\u201d.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> While Wikipedia insists that contributors must only publish preexisting knowledge, the dynamics behind dialogic expertise creates new information nonetheless. Knowledge production is created as a function of dialogue.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> According to Hartelius, dialogic expertise has emerged on Wikipedia not only because of its interactive structure but also because of the site's hortative discourse which is not found in traditional encyclopedias.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> By Wikipedia's hortative discourse, Hartelius means various encouragements to edit certain topics and instructions on how to do so that appear on the site.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/> One further reason to the emergence of dialogic expertise on Wikipedia is the site's [[Wikipedia:Community portal|community pages]], which function as a techne; explicating Wikipedia's expert methodology.<ref name=\"Hartelius, E. Johanna 2011 pp. 505\"/>\n\n===Networked Expertise===\n{{See also|Wisdom of the crowd}}\nBuilding on Hartelius, Damien Pfister developed the concept of \"networked expertise\". Noting that Wikipedia employs a [[Many-to-many|\"many to many\"]] rather than a \"one to one\" model of communication, he notes how expertise likewise shifts to become a quality of a group rather than an individual. With the information traditionally associated with individual experts now stored within a text produced by a collective, knowing about something is less important than knowing how to find something. As he puts it, \"With the internet, the historical power of subject matter expertise is eroded: the archival nature of the Web means that what and how to information is readily available.\" The rhetorical authority previously afforded to subject matter expertise, then, is given to those with the procedural knowledge of how to find information called for by a situation.<ref>Pfister, Damien. \"Networked Expertise in the Era of Many-to-many Communication: On Wikipedia and Invention.\" Social Epistemology: A Journal of Knowledge, Culture, and Policy 25.3 (2011). Web.</ref>\n\n==Contrasts and comparisons==\n\n===Associated terms===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}\nAn expert differs from the specialist in that a specialist has to ''be able to solve'' a [[problem]] and an expert has to ''know its solution''. The opposite of an expert is generally known as a [[layperson]], while someone who occupies a middle grade of understanding is generally known as a [[technician]] and often employed to assist experts. A person may well be an expert in one field and a layperson in many other fields. The concepts of experts and expertise are debated within the field of [[epistemology]] under the general heading of expert knowledge. In contrast, the opposite of a specialist would be a [[wikt:generalist|generalist]] or [[polymath]].\n\nThe term is widely used informally, with people being described as 'experts' in order to bolster the relative value of their opinion, when no [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] criteria for their expertise is available. The term [[crank (person)|crank]] is likewise used to disparage opinions. [[Academic elitism]] arises when experts become convinced that only their opinion is useful, sometimes on matters beyond their personal expertise.\n\nIn contrast to an expert, a [[novice]] (known [[colloquially]] as a [[newbie]] or 'greenhorn') is any person that is new to any science or field of study or activity or social cause and who is undergoing training in order to meet normal requirements of being regarded a mature and equal participant.\n\n\"Expert\" is also being mistakenly interchanged with the term \"[[authority]]\" in new media. An expert can be an authority if through relationships to people and technology, that expert is allowed to control access to his expertise. However, a person who merely wields authority is not by right an expert. In new media, users are being misled by the term \"authority\". Many sites and search engines such as Google and Technorati use the term \"authority\" to denote the link value and traffic to a particular topic. However, this authority only measures populist information. It in no way assures that the author of that site or blog is an expert.\n\n===Developmental characteristics===\nSome characteristics of the development of an expert have been found to include\n* A characterization of this practice as \"deliberate practice\", which forces the practitioner to come up with new ways to encourage and enable themselves to reach new levels of performance<ref name=\":1\" />\n* An early phase of learning which is characterized by enjoyment, excitement, and participation without outcome-related goals<ref>Janet L. Starkes, K Anders Ericsson (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=gl8nqUjyXWUC&pg=PA91 Expert Performance in Sports] Advances in Research on Sport Expertise. p. 91</ref>\n* The ability to rearrange or construct a higher dimension of creativity. Due to such familiarity or advanced knowledge experts can develop more abstract perspectives of their concepts and/or performances.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/expert|title=Definition of EXPERT|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref>\n\n==Use in literature==\n[[Mark Twain]] defined an expert as \"an ordinary fellow from another town\".<ref>[needs quotation reference]{{Citation needed|reason=Is this the right template to use?|date=November 2016}}</ref> [[Will Rogers]] described an expert as \"A man fifty miles from home with a briefcase.\" Danish scientist and Nobel laureate [[Niels Bohr]] defined an expert as \"A person that has made every possible mistake within his or her field.\"<ref name=\"Life Magazine\">{{cite magazine|last1=Robert Coughlan|first1=Quoted by Dr Edward Teller|title=Dr. Edward Teller's Magnificent Obsession|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I1QEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62#v=onepage&q&f=false|magazine=Life Magazine|accessdate=13 February 2017|date=1954-09-06}}</ref>\n[[Malcolm Gladwell]] describes expertise as a matter of practicing the correct way for a total of around 10,000 hours.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Education}}\n* {{annotated link|Perceptual learning}}\n* {{annotated link|Consultant}}\n* {{annotated link|Polymath}}\n\n===General===\n* {{annotated link|Scholar}}\n* {{annotated link|Know-how}}\n* {{annotated link|Skill}}\n* {{annotated link|Competence (human resources)|Competence}}\n* {{annotated link|Excellence}}\n* {{annotated link|Technocracy}}\n* {{annotated link|Insider}}\n* {{annotated link|Tutor expertise in adult education}}\n\n===Criticism===\n* {{annotated link|Anti-intellectualism}}\n* {{annotated link|Denialism}}\n* {{annotated link|The Death of Expertise}}\n* {{annotated link|Gibson's law}}\n\n===Psychology===\n* {{annotated link|Dreyfus model of skill acquisition}}\n* {{annotated link|Dunning\u2013Kruger effect}}\n* {{annotated link|Pygmalion effect}}\n* {{annotated link|Rational skepticism}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |ref=harv |last=Borko |first=Hilda |last2=Livingston |first2=Carol |year=1989 |title=Cognition and Improvisation: Differences in Mathematics Instruction by Expert and Novice Teachers |jstor=1162861 |journal=American Educational Research Journal |volume=Winter 1989, Vol. 26, No. 4 |issue=4 |pages=473\u2013498|doi=10.3102/00028312026004473 }}\n* {{cite book | ref=harv | last=Chase | first=W.G. | last2=Simon | first2=Herbert A. | author2-link=Herbert A.
