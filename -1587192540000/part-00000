In short, controlled vocabularies reduce ambiguity inherent in normal human languages where the same concept can be given different names and ensure consistency.\n\nFor example, in the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/librarians/controlled-vocabularies/|title=Controlled Vocabularies {{!}} Librarians {{!}} Library of Congress|work=The Library of Congress|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en}}</ref> (a subject heading system that uses a controlled vocabulary), authorized terms\u2014subject headings in this case\u2014have to be chosen to handle choices between variant spellings of the same word (American versus British), choice among scientific and popular terms (''cockroach'' versus ''Periplaneta americana''), and choices between synonyms (''automobile'' versus ''car''), among other difficult issues.\n\nChoices of authorized terms are based on the principles of ''user warrant'' (what terms users are likely to use), ''literary warrant'' (what terms are generally used in the literature and documents), and ''structural warrant'' (terms chosen by considering the structure, scope of the controlled vocabulary).\n\nControlled vocabularies also typically handle the problem of [[homographs]] with qualifiers. For example, the term ''pool'' has to be qualified to refer to either ''swimming pool'' or the game ''pool'' to ensure that each authorized term or heading refers to only one concept.\n\n=== Types used in libraries ===\nThere are two main kinds of controlled vocabulary tools used in libraries: subject headings and thesauri. While the differences between the two are diminishing, there are still some minor differences.\n\nHistorically subject headings were designed to describe books in library catalogs by catalogers while thesauri were used by indexers to apply index terms to documents and articles. Subject headings tend to be broader in scope describing whole books, while thesauri tend to be more specialized covering very specific disciplines. Also because of the card catalog system, subject headings tend to have terms that are in indirect order (though with the rise of automated systems this is being removed), while thesaurus terms are always in direct order. Subject headings also tend to use more pre-coordination of terms such that the designer of the controlled vocabulary will combine various concepts together to form one authorized subject heading. (e.g., children and terrorism) while thesauri tend to use singular direct terms. Lastly thesauri list not only equivalent terms but also narrower, broader terms and related terms among various authorized and non-authorized terms, while historically most subject headings did not.\n\nFor example, the [[Library of Congress Subject Heading]] itself did not have much syndetic structure until 1943, and it was not until 1985 when it began to adopt the thesauri type term \"[[Hypernym|Broader term]]\" and \"[[Hyponym|Narrow term]]\".\n\nThe [[terminology|terms]] are chosen and organized by trained professionals (including librarians and information scientists) who possess expertise in the subject area. Controlled vocabulary terms can accurately describe what a given document is actually about, even if the terms themselves do not occur within the document's text. Well known subject heading systems include the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings|Library of Congress system]], [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]], and [[Sears Subject Headings|Sears]]. Well known thesauri include the [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus]] and the [[Education Resources Information Center|ERIC]] Thesaurus.\n\nChoosing authorized terms to be used is a tricky business, besides the areas already considered above, the designer has to consider the specificity of the term chosen, whether to use direct entry, inter consistency and stability of the language. Lastly the amount of pre-co-ordinate (in which case the degree of enumeration versus synthesis becomes an issue) and post co-ordinate in the system is another important issue.\n\nControlled vocabulary elements (terms/phrases) employed as [[Tag (metadata)|tags]], to aid in the content identification process of documents, or other information system entities (e.g. DBMS, Web Services) qualifies as [[metadata]].\n\n== Indexing languages ==\n\nThere are three main types of indexing languages.\n\n* Controlled indexing language \u2013 only approved terms can be used by the indexer to describe the document\n* [[Natural language]] indexing language \u2013 any term from the document in question can be used to describe the document\n* Free indexing language \u2013 any term (not only from the document) can be used to describe the document\n\nWhen indexing a document, the indexer also has to choose the level of indexing exhaustivity, the level of detail in which the document is described. For example, using low indexing exhaustivity, minor aspects of the work will not be described with index terms. In general the higher the indexing exhaustivity, the more terms indexed for each document.\n\nIn recent years [[free text search]] as a means of access to documents has become popular. This involves using natural language indexing with an indexing exhaustively set to maximum (every word in the text is ''indexed''). Many studies have been done to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of free text searches against documents that have been indexed by experts using a few well chosen controlled vocabulary descriptors.\n\n=== Advantages ===\n\nControlled vocabularies are often claimed to improve the accuracy of free text searching, such as to reduce [[Relevance (Information Retrieval)|irrelevant]] items in the retrieval list. These irrelevant items ([[false positives]]) are often caused by the inherent ambiguity of [[natural language]]. Take the English word [[football (word)|''football'']] for example. ''Football'' is the name given to a number of different [[team sport]]s. Worldwide the most popular of these team sports is [[Football (soccer)|association football]], which also happens to be called ''[[soccer]]'' in several countries. The word ''football'' is also applied to [[rugby football]] ([[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]]), [[American football]], [[Australian rules football]], [[Gaelic football]], and [[Canadian football]]. A search for ''football'' therefore will retrieve documents that are about several completely different sports. Controlled vocabulary solves this problem by [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]] the documents in such a way that the ambiguities are eliminated.\n\nCompared to free text searching, the use of a controlled vocabulary can dramatically increase the performance of an information retrieval system, if performance is measured by precision (the percentage of documents in the retrieval list that are actually [[relevance|relevant]] to the search topic).\n\nIn some cases controlled vocabulary can enhance recall as well, because unlike natural language schemes, once the correct authorized term is searched, there is no need to search for other terms that might be synonyms of that term.\n\n=== Problems ===\n\nA controlled vocabulary search may lead to unsatisfactory [[Recall (information retrieval)|recall]], in that it will fail to retrieve some documents that are actually relevant to the search question.\n\nThis is particularly problematic when the search question involves terms that are sufficiently tangential to the subject area such that the indexer might have decided to tag it using a different term (but the searcher might consider the same). Essentially, this can be avoided only by an experienced user of controlled vocabulary whose understanding of the vocabulary coincides with that of the indexer.\n\nAnother possibility is that the article is just not tagged by the indexer because indexing exhaustivity is low. For example, an article might mention football as a secondary focus, and the indexer might decide not to tag it with \"football\" because it is not important enough compared to the main focus. But it turns out that for the searcher that article is relevant and hence recall fails. A free text search would automatically pick up that article regardless.\n\nOn the other hand, free text searches have high exhaustivity (every word is searched) so although it has much lower precision, it has potential for high recall as long as the searcher overcome the problem of synonyms by entering every combination.\n\nControlled vocabularies may become outdated rapidly in fast developing fields of knowledge, unless the authorized terms are updated regularly. Even in an ideal scenario, a controlled vocabulary is often less specific than the words of the text itself. Indexers trying to choose the appropriate index terms might misinterpret the author, while this precise problem is not a factor in a free text, as it uses the author's own words.\n\nThe use of controlled vocabularies can be costly compared to free text searches because human experts  or expensive automated systems are necessary to index each entry.  Furthermore, the user has to be familiar with the controlled vocabulary scheme to make best use of the system. But as already mentioned, the control of synonyms, homographs can help increase precision.\n\nNumerous methodologies have been developed to assist in the creation of controlled vocabularies, including [[faceted classification]], which enables a given data record or document to be described in multiple ways.\n\n==Applications==\nControlled vocabularies, such as the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]], are an essential component of [[bibliography]], the study and classification of books. They were initially developed in [[library and information science]]. In the 1950s, government agencies  began to develop controlled vocabularies for the burgeoning journal literature in specialized fields; an example is the [[Medical Subject Headings]] (MeSH) developed by the [[United States National Library of Medicine|U.S. National Library of Medicine]]. Subsequently, for-profit firms (called Abstracting and indexing services) emerged to index the fast-growing literature in every field of knowledge. In the 1960s, an online bibliographic database industry developed based on dialup [[X.25]] networking. These services were seldom made available to the public because they were difficult to use; specialist librarians called search intermediaries handled the searching job. In the 1980s, the first [[full text]] databases appeared; these databases contain the full text of the index articles as well as the bibliographic information. Online bibliographic databases have migrated to the Internet and are now publicly available; however, most are proprietary and can be expensive to use. Students enrolled in colleges and universities may be able to access some of these services without charge; some of these services may be accessible without charge at a public library.\n\n=== Technical communication ===\n\nIn large organizations, controlled vocabularies may be introduced to improve [[technical communication]]. The use of controlled vocabulary ensures that everyone is using the same word to mean the same thing.  This consistency of terms is one of the most important concepts in [[technical writing]] and [[knowledge management]], where effort is expended to use the same word throughout a [[document]] or [[organization]] instead of slightly different ones to refer to the same thing.\n\n=== Semantic web and structured data ===\n\nWeb searching could be dramatically improved by the development of a controlled vocabulary for describing Web pages; the use of such a vocabulary could culminate in a [[Semantic Web]], in which the content of Web pages is described using a machine-readable [[metadata]] scheme. One of the first proposals for such a scheme is the [[Dublin Core]] Initiative. An example of a controlled vocabulary which is usable for [[Web indexing|indexing web pages]] is [[Polythematic Structured Subject Heading System|PSH]].\n\nIt is unlikely that a single metadata scheme will ever succeed in describing the content of the entire Web.<ref>Cory Doctorow, [http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm Metacrap].</ref> To create a Semantic Web, it may be necessary to draw from two or more metadata systems to describe a Web page's contents. The eXchangeable Faceted Metadata Language (XFML) is designed to enable controlled vocabulary creators to publish and share metadata systems. XFML is designed on [[faceted classification]] principles.<ref>Mark Pilgrim, [http://petervandijck.com/xfml/ eXchangeable Faceted Metadata Language].</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=July 2018}}\n\nControlled vocabularies of the [[Semantic Web]] define the concepts and relationships (terms) used to describe a field of interest or area of concern. For instance, to declare a person in a machine-readable format, a vocabulary is needed that has the formal definition of \"Person\", such as the Friend of a Friend ([[FOAF]]) vocabulary, which has a Person class that defines typical properties of a person including, but not limited to, name, honorific prefix, affiliation, email address, and homepage, or the Person vocabulary of [[Schema.org]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://schema.org/Person |title=The Person vocabulary of Schema.org |accessdate=13 March 2015}}</ref> Similarly, a book can be described using the Book vocabulary of [[Schema.org]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://schema.org/Book |title=The Book vocabulary of Schema.org |accessdate=13 March 2015}}</ref> and general publication terms from the [[Dublin Core]] vocabulary,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/ |title=Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1 |accessdate=13 March 2015}}</ref> an event with the Event vocabulary of [[Schema.org]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://schema.org/Event |title=The Event vocabulary of Schema.org |accessdate=13 March 2015}}</ref> and so on.\n\nTo use machine-readable terms from any controlled vocabulary, web designers can choose from a variety of annotation formats, including RDFa, [[Microdata (HTML)|HTML5 Microdata]], or [[JSON-LD]] in the markup, or [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] serializations (RDF/XML, Turtle, N3, TriG, TriX) in external files.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Authority control]]\n*[[Controlled natural language]]\n*[[IMS VDEX|IMS Vocabulary Definition Exchange]]\n*[[Named-entity recognition]]\n*[[Nomenclature]]\n*[[Ontology (computer science)]]\n*[[Terminology]]\n*[[Universal Data Element Framework]]\n*[[Vocabulary-based transformation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Controlled vocabularies| ]]\n[[Category:Information retrieval techniques]]\n[[Category:Library cataloging and classification]]\n[[Category:Knowledge representation]]\n[[Category:Technical communication]]\n[[Category:Semantic Web]]\n[[Category:Ontology (information science)]]\n[[Category:Information science]]\n[[Category:Identifiers]]\n\n==External Links==\n* [https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/ Directory of Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV)]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=June 2012}}\n\n'''Controlled vocabularies''' provide a way to organize knowledge for subsequent retrieval.

The Secretary of Commerce delegated this authority to the Director of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) ([http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/FRN_Vol_73_No_96_16May2008_SI_Interpretation.pdf Turner, 2008]).

The Director of the NIST officially recognized this publication, together with [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf Taylor and Thompson (2008b)], as the \"legal interpretation\" of the SI for the United States ([http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/FRN_Vol_73_No_96_16May2008_SI_Interpretation.pdf Turner, 2008]).}}\n\nOne litre of liquid water has a [[mass]] of almost exactly one [[kilogram]], because the kilogram was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one cubic decimetre of water at the temperature of melting ice ({{val|0|u=degC}}). Subsequent redefinitions of the metre and kilogram mean that this relationship is no longer exact.<ref name=decree />\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Masskrug.jpg|thumb|upright|One-litre beer mugs ({{lang-de|Ma\u00dfkr\u00fcge}}) at the 2006 [[Oktoberfest]] in Germany]]\n\nA litre is a cubic [[decimetre]], or 10 centimetres \u00d7 10 centimetres \u00d7 10 centimetres, (1&nbsp;L \u2261 1&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup> \u2261 1000&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>). Hence 1&nbsp;L \u2261 0.001&nbsp;[[Cubic metre|m<sup>3</sup>]] \u2261 1000&nbsp;[[cubic centimetre|cm<sup>3</sup>]], and 1&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> (i.e. a cubic metre, which is the [[SI]] unit for volume) is exactly 1000&nbsp;L.\n\nFrom 1901 to 1964, the litre was defined as the volume of one kilogram of pure water at maximum density (+4&nbsp;\u00b0C) and standard pressure. The kilogram was in turn specified as the mass of the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram]] (a specific platinum/iridium cylinder) and was intended to be of the same mass as the 1&nbsp;litre of water referred to above. It was subsequently discovered that the cylinder was around 28 parts per million too large and thus, during this time, a litre was about 1.000028&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup>. Additionally, the mass\u2013volume relationship of water (as with any fluid) depends on temperature, pressure, purity and isotopic uniformity. In 1964, the definition relating the litre to mass was superseded by the current one. Although the litre is not an SI unit, it is accepted by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] (the standards body that defines the SI) for use with the SI. CGPM defines the litre and its acceptable symbols.\n\nA litre is equal in volume to the [[stere|millistere]], an obsolete non-SI [[Metric system|metric]] unit customarily used for [[dry measure]].\n\n==Explanation==\nLitres are most commonly used for items (such as [[fluid]]s and solids that can be poured), which are measured by the capacity or size of their container, whereas cubic metres (and derived units) are most commonly used for items measured either by their dimensions or their displacements. The litre is often also used in some calculated measurements, such as density (kg/L), allowing an easy comparison with the density of water.\n\nOne litre of water has a [[mass]] of almost exactly one [[kilogram]] when measured at its maximal density, which occurs at about 4&nbsp;\u00b0C. It follows, therefore, that 1000th of a litre, known as one millilitre (1 mL) of water has a mass of about 1&nbsp;g; 1000&nbsp;litres of water has a mass of about 1000&nbsp;kg (1&nbsp;[[tonne]]). This relationship holds because the gram was originally defined as the mass of 1&nbsp;mL of water; however, this definition was abandoned in 1799 because the density of water changes with temperature and, very slightly, with pressure.\n\nIt is now known that the density of water also depends on the isotopic ratios of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in a particular sample. Modern measurements of [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]], which is pure distilled water with an [[Isotope|isotopic]] composition representative of the average of the world's oceans, show that it has a density of {{val|0.999975|0.000001|u=kg/L}} at its point of maximum density (3.984&nbsp;\u00b0C) under one standard atmosphere (760&nbsp;[[Torr]] = 101.325&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]) of pressure.<ref>Isotopic composition and temperature per London South Bank University\u2019s [http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/data.html \"List of physicochemical data concerning water\"], density and uncertainty per [http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/ NIST Standard Reference Database Number 69] (Retrieved: 2010-04-05).</ref>\n\n== SI prefixes applied to the litre==\n\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Glucose]] and from some prefixed units-->\nThe litre, though not an official SI unit, may be used with [[SI prefix]]es. The most commonly used derived unit is the millilitre, defined as one-thousandth of a litre, and also often referred to by the SI derived unit name \"cubic centimetre\". It is a commonly used measure, especially in medicine, cooking and automotive engineering. Other units may be found in the table below, where the more often used terms are in bold. However, some authorities advise against some of them; for example, in the United States, [[NIST]] advocates using the millilitre or litre instead of the centilitre.<ref>Kenneth Butcher, Linda Crown, Elizabeth J.

One cubic foot would contain exactly 27 such cubes (four inches on each side), making one cubic foot approximately equal to 27 litres. One cubic foot has an exact volume of 28.316846592 litres, which is 4.88% higher than the 27 litre approximation.\n\nA litre of liquid water has a mass almost exactly equal to one [[kilogram]]. An early definition of the kilogram was set as the mass of one litre of water. Because volume changes with temperature and pressure, and pressure uses units of mass, the definition of a kilogram was changed. At [[standard pressure]], one litre of water has a mass of 0.999975&nbsp;kg at {{nowrap|4&nbsp;\u00b0C}}, and 0.997&nbsp;kg at {{nowrap|25&nbsp;\u00b0C}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/javascript/water-density.html |title=Online water density calculator |publisher=Antoine.frostburg.edu |accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==Symbol==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[International System of Units]] -->\nOriginally, the only symbol for the litre was '''l''' (lowercase letter L), following the [[SI]] convention that only those unit symbols that abbreviate the name of a person start with a capital letter. In many English-speaking countries, however, the most common shape of a handwritten [[Arabic digit]] 1 is just a [[Regional handwriting variation|vertical stroke]]; that is, it lacks the upstroke added in many other cultures. Therefore, the digit \"1\" may easily be confused with the letter \"l\". In some computer typefaces, the two characters are barely distinguishable. This caused some concern, especially in the medical community.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAs a result, '''L''' (uppercase letter L) was adopted as an alternative symbol for litre in 1979.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The [[United States]] [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] now recommends the use of the uppercase letter L,<ref>[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec05.html#table6 Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI by the CIPM] \u2013 [[NIST]]</ref> a practice that is also widely followed in [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]. In these countries, the symbol L is also used with prefixes, as in mL and \u03bcL, instead of the traditional ml and \u03bcl used in Europe. In [[United Kingdom|the UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] as well as the rest of Europe, lowercase ''l'' is used with prefixes, though whole litres are often written in full (so, \"750&nbsp;ml\" on a wine bottle, but often \"1 litre\" on a juice carton).

The Secretary of Commerce delegated this authority to the Director of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) ([http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/FRN_Vol_73_No_96_16May2008_SI_Interpretation.pdf Turner, 2008]).

Subsequent redefinitions of the metre and kilogram mean that this relationship is no longer exact.<ref name=decree />\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Masskrug.jpg|thumb|upright|One-litre beer mugs ({{lang-de|Ma\u00dfkr\u00fcge}}) at the 2006 [[Oktoberfest]] in Germany]]\n\nA litre is a cubic [[decimetre]], or 10 centimetres \u00d7 10 centimetres \u00d7 10 centimetres, (1&nbsp;L \u2261 1&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup> \u2261 1000&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>). Hence 1&nbsp;L \u2261 0.001&nbsp;[[Cubic metre|m<sup>3</sup>]] \u2261 1000&nbsp;[[cubic centimetre|cm<sup>3</sup>]], and 1&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> (i.e. a cubic metre, which is the [[SI]] unit for volume) is exactly 1000&nbsp;L.\n\nFrom 1901 to 1964, the litre was defined as the volume of one kilogram of pure water at maximum density (+4&nbsp;\u00b0C) and standard pressure. The kilogram was in turn specified as the mass of the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram]] (a specific platinum/iridium cylinder) and was intended to be of the same mass as the 1&nbsp;litre of water referred to above. It was subsequently discovered that the cylinder was around 28 parts per million too large and thus, during this time, a litre was about 1.000028&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup>. Additionally, the mass\u2013volume relationship of water (as with any fluid) depends on temperature, pressure, purity and isotopic uniformity. In 1964, the definition relating the litre to mass was superseded by the current one. Although the litre is not an SI unit, it is accepted by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] (the standards body that defines the SI) for use with the SI. CGPM defines the litre and its acceptable symbols.\n\nA litre is equal in volume to the [[stere|millistere]], an obsolete non-SI [[Metric system|metric]] unit customarily used for [[dry measure]].\n\n==Explanation==\nLitres are most commonly used for items (such as [[fluid]]s and solids that can be poured), which are measured by the capacity or size of their container, whereas cubic metres (and derived units) are most commonly used for items measured either by their dimensions or their displacements. The litre is often also used in some calculated measurements, such as density (kg/L), allowing an easy comparison with the density of water.\n\nOne litre of water has a [[mass]] of almost exactly one [[kilogram]] when measured at its maximal density, which occurs at about 4&nbsp;\u00b0C. It follows, therefore, that 1,000th of a litre, known as one millilitre (1 mL) of water has a mass of about 1&nbsp;g; 1,000 litres of water has a mass of about 1,000&nbsp;kg (1&nbsp;[[tonne]]). This relationship holds because the gram was originally defined as the mass of 1&nbsp;mL of water; however, this definition was abandoned in 1799 because the density of water changes with temperature and, very slightly, with pressure.\n\nIt is now known that the density of water also depends on the isotopic ratios of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in a particular sample. Modern measurements of [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]], which is pure distilled water with an [[Isotope|isotopic]] composition representative of the average of the world's oceans, show it has a density of {{nowrap|{{val|fmt=commas|0.999975}} \u00b1{{val|fmt=commas|0.000001}}&nbsp;kg/L}} at its point of maximum density (3.984&nbsp;\u00b0C) under one standard atmosphere (760&nbsp;[[Torr]], 101.325&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]) of pressure.<ref>Isotopic composition and temperature per London South Bank University\u2019s [http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/data.html \"List of physicochemical data concerning water\"], density and uncertainty per [http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/ NIST Standard Reference Database Number 69] (Retrieved: 2010-04-05)</ref>\n\n== SI prefixes applied to the litre==\n\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Glucose]] and from some prefixed units-->\nThe litre, though not an official SI unit, may be used with [[SI prefix]]es. The most commonly used derived unit is the millilitre, defined as one-thousandth of a litre, and also often referred to by the SI derived unit name \"cubic centimetre\". It is a commonly used measure, especially in medicine, cooking and automotive engineering. Other units may be found in the table below, where the more often used terms are in bold. However, some authorities advise against some of them; for example, in the United States, [[NIST]] advocates using the millilitre or litre instead of the centilitre.<ref>Kenneth Butcher, Linda Crown, Elizabeth J.

In many English-speaking countries, however, the most common shape of a handwritten [[Arabic digit]] 1 is just a [[Regional handwriting variation|vertical stroke]]; that is, it lacks the upstroke added in many other cultures. Therefore, the digit \"1\" may easily be confused with the letter \"l\". In some computer typefaces, the two characters are barely distinguishable. This caused some concern, especially in the medical community.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAs a result, '''L''' (uppercase letter L) was adopted as an alternative symbol for litre in 1979.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The [[United States]] [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] now recommends the use of the uppercase letter L,<ref>[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec05.html#table6 Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI by the CIPM] \u2013 [[NIST]]</ref> a practice that is also widely followed in [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]. In these countries, the symbol L is also used with prefixes, as in mL and \u03bcL, instead of the traditional ml and \u03bcl used in Europe. In [[United Kingdom|the UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] as well as the rest of Europe, lowercase ''l'' is used with prefixes, though whole litres are often written in full (so, \"750&nbsp;ml\" on a wine bottle, but often \"1 litre\" on a juice carton).

A [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] is anything that communicates a meaning, that is not the sign itself, to the interpreter of the sign. The meaning can be intentional such as a word uttered with a specific meaning, or unintentional, such as a symptom being a sign of a particular medical condition. Signs can communicate through any of the senses, [[Visual system|visual]], [[Hearing|auditory]], [[Somatosensory system|tactile]], [[Olfaction|olfactory]], or [[taste|gustatory]].\n\nThe semiotic tradition explores the study of signs and symbols as a significant part of communications. Unlike linguistics, semiotics also studies non-linguistic [[sign system]]s. Semiotics includes the study of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and sign processes, indication, designation, likeness, [[analogy]], [[allegory]], [[metonymy]], [[metaphor]], [[symbol]]ism, signification, and communication. \n\nSemiotics is frequently seen as having important [[anthropology|anthropological]] and [[sociology|sociological]] dimensions; for example, the Italian semiotician and novelist [[Umberto Eco]] proposed that every cultural phenomenon may be studied as communication.<ref name=caesar>{{cite book |last= Caesar |first= Michael |title= ''Umberto Eco: Philosophy, Semiotics, and the Work of Fiction'' |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |year= 1999 |isbn= 978-0-7456-0850-1 |page= 55}}</ref> Some semioticians focus on the [[logic]]al dimensions of the science, however. They examine areas belonging also to the [[life sciences]]\u2014such as how organisms make predictions about, and adapt to, their semiotic [[ecological niche|niche]] in the world (see [[semiosis]]). In general, semiotic theories take ''signs'' or sign systems as their object of study: the communication of information in living organisms is covered in [[biosemiotics]] (including [[zoosemiotics]] and [[phytosemiotics]]).\n\nSemiotics is not to be confused with the [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] tradition called [[Ferdinand de Saussure#Semiology|semiology]], which is a subset of semiotics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.joensuu.fi/~whamalai/skc/semiology.html |title=Semiology vs. semiotics|website=University of Eastern Finland |access-date=23 April 2019}}</ref><ref>\"The science of communication studied through the interpretation of signs and symbols as they operate in various fields, esp. language\", ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2003)</ref>\n\n==History and terminology==\nThe importance of signs and signification has been recognized throughout much of the history of [[philosophy]], and in psychology as well.

In Chapter XX, titled \"Division of the Sciences,\" which concludes the 1st edition of Locke's ''Essay'' (1689/1690), Locke introduces \"\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\"  in \u00a74 as his proposed name synonymous with \"''the Doctrine of Signs''\" for the development of the future study of the ubiquitous role of signs within human awareness. In the 4th edition of Locke's ''Essay'' (1700), a new Chapter XIX, titled \"Of Enthusiasm,\" is inserted into Book IV. As result, Chapter XX of the 1st edition becomes Chapter XXI for all subsequent editions. It is an important fact that Locke's proposal for the development of semiotics, with three passing exceptions as \"asides\" in the writings of [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Leibniz]], and [[\u00c9tienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], \"is met with a resounding silence that lasts as long as modernity itself.

The Peircean semiotic addresses not only the external communication mechanism, as per Saussure, but  the internal representation machine, investigating sign processes, and modes of inference, as well as the whole inquiry process in general.\n\nPeircean semiotic is triadic, including sign, object, interpretant, as opposed to the dyadic [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurian]] tradition (signifier, signified). Peircean semiotics further subdivides each of the three triadic elements into three sub-types, positing the existence of signs that are symbols; semblances (\"icons\"); and \"indices,\" i.e., signs that are such through a factual connection to their objects.<ref>{{Citation|title=Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography|date=2020-03-22|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Sanders_Peirce_bibliography&oldid=946853243|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\nPeircean scholar and editor Max H.

The two faucets (taps) probably were sold as a coded set, but the code is unusable (and ignored), as there is a single water supply.]]\nSemioticians classify signs or sign systems in relation to the way they are transmitted (see [[modality (semiotics)|modality]]). This process of carrying meaning depends on the use of [[code (semiotics)|codes]] that may be the individual sounds or letters that humans use to form words, the body movements they make to show attitude or emotion, or even something as general as the clothes they wear. To [[neologism|coin]] a word to refer to a ''thing'' (see [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] words), the [[community]] must agree on a simple meaning (a [[denotation (semiotics)|denotative]] meaning) within their language, but that word can transmit that meaning only within the language's grammatical structures and codes (see [[syntax]] and [[semantics]]). Codes also represent the [[value (semiotics)|values]] of the [[culture]], and are able to add new shades of [[connotation (semiotics)|connotation]] to every aspect of life.\n\nTo explain the relationship between semiotics and [[communication studies]], [[communication]] is defined as the process of transferring data and-or meaning from a source to a receiver. Hence, communication theorists construct models based on codes, media, and [[context (language use)|context]]s to explain the [[biology]], [[psychology]], and [[mechanics]] involved. Both disciplines recognize that the technical process cannot be separated from the fact that the receiver must [[decode (semiotics)|decode]] the data, i.e., be able to distinguish the data as [[Salience (semiotics)|salient]], and make meaning out of it. This implies that there is a necessary overlap between semiotics and communication. Indeed, many of the concepts are shared, although in each field the emphasis is different. In ''Messages and Meanings: An Introduction to Semiotics'', [[Marcel Danesi]] (1994) suggested that semioticians' priorities were to study [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]] first, and communication second. A more extreme view is offered by [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] (1987; trans. 1990: 16){{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=Name and year provided with no proper citation or inclusion of work in bibliography}}, who, as a [[musicology|musicologist]], considered the theoretical study of communication irrelevant to his application of semiotics.\n\n=== Syntactics ===\n{{anchor|Syntactics|syntactics}}\nSemiotics differs from [[linguistics]] in that it generalizes the definition of a sign to encompass signs in any medium or sensory modality. Thus it broadens the range of sign systems and sign relations, and extends the definition of language in what amounts to its widest analogical or metaphorical sense. The branch of semiotics that deals with such formal relations between signs or expressions in abstraction from their signification and their interpreters,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/syntactics |title=Definition of Syntactics by Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster Inc. |access-date=May 29, 2019}}</ref> or\u2014more generally\u2014with formal properties of symbol systems<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/syntactics |title=Syntactics definition and meaning|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |access-date=May 29, 2019}}</ref> (specifically, with reference to linguistic signs, [[syntax]])<ref>{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|Syntactics}}</ref> is referred to as '''syntactics'''.\n\nPeirce's definition of the term \"semiotic\" as the study of necessary features of signs also has the effect of distinguishing the discipline from linguistics as the study of contingent features that the world's languages happen to have acquired in the course of their evolutions. From a subjective standpoint, perhaps more difficult is the distinction between semiotics and the [[philosophy of language]]. In a sense, the difference lies between separate traditions rather than subjects. Different authors have called themselves \"philosopher of language\" or \"semiotician\". This difference does ''not'' match the separation between [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]. On a closer look, there may be found some differences regarding subjects. Philosophy of language pays more attention to [[natural language]]s or to languages in general, while semiotics is deeply concerned with non-linguistic signification. Philosophy of language also bears connections to linguistics, while semiotics might appear closer to some of the [[humanities]] (including [[literary theory]]) and to [[cultural anthropology]].\n\n=== Cognitive semiotics ===\nSemiosis or ''semeiosis'' is the process that forms meaning from any organism's apprehension of the world through signs. Scholars who have talked about semiosis in their subtheories of semiotics include [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.&nbsp;S. Peirce]], [[John Deely]], and [[Umberto Eco]]. Cognitive semiotics is combining methods and theories developed in the disciplines of cognitive methods and theories developed in semiotics and the humanities, with providing new information into human signification and its manifestation in cultural practices. The research on cognitive semiotics brings together semiotics from linguistics, cognitive science, and related disciplines on a common meta-theoretical platform of concepts, methods, and shared data.\n\n[[Cognitive semiotics]] may also be seen as the study of meaning-making by employing and integrating methods and theories developed in the cognitive sciences. This involves conceptual and textual analysis as well as experimental investigations. Cognitive semiotics initially was developed at the Center for Semiotics at [[Aarhus University]] ([[Denmark]]), with an important connection with the Center of Functionally Integrated Neuroscience (CFIN) at Aarhus Hospital. Amongst the prominent cognitive semioticians are [[Per Aage Brandt]], Svend \u00d8stergaard, Peer Bundg\u00e5rd, Frederik Stjernfelt, Mikkel Wallentin, Kristian Tyl\u00e9n, Riccardo Fusaroli, and Jordan Zlatev.

While [[art history]] has limited its visual analysis to a small number of pictures that qualify as \"works of art\", pictorial semiotics focuses on the properties of pictures in a general sense, and on how the artistic conventions of images can be interpreted through pictorial codes. Pictorial codes are the way in which viewers of pictorial representations seem automatically to decipher the artistic conventions of images by being unconsciously familiar with them.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Pictorial Codes|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100326343?rskey=TyYRDS&result=6|publisher=Oxford University Press, n.d.

Some influences have been drawn from phenomenological analysis, cognitive psychology, structuralist, and cognitivist linguistics, and visual anthropology and sociology.\n\n===Globalization===\nStudies have shown that semiotics may be used to make or break a [[brand]]. [[Culture code]]s strongly influence whether a population likes or dislikes a brand's marketing, especially internationally. If the company is unaware of a culture's codes, it runs the risk of failing in its marketing. [[Globalization]] has caused the development of a global consumer culture where products have similar associations, whether positive or negative, across numerous markets.<ref name=\"Alden\">{{cite journal|last1=Alden|first1=Dana L|last2=Steenkamp|first2=Jan-Benedict E.

Disney fits well with [[Japan]]'s cultural code because the Japanese value \"cuteness\", politeness, and gift giving as part of their culture code; [[Tokyo Disneyland]] sells the most souvenirs of any Disney theme park. In contrast, [[Disneyland Paris]] failed when it launched as [[Euro Disney S.C.A.|Euro Disney]] because the company did not research the codes underlying European culture. Its storybook retelling of European folktales was taken as [[Elitism|elitist]] and insulting, and the strict appearance standards that it had for employees resulted in discrimination lawsuits in France. Disney souvenirs were perceived as cheap trinkets.

[[Sigmund Freud]]<ref>Freud, Sigmund. 1900 [1899]. ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]].'' London: [[Hogarth Press|Hogarth]]</ref> spelled out how meaning in dreams rests on a blend of images, affects, sounds, words, and kinesthetic sensations. In his chapter on \"The Means of Representation,\" he showed how the most abstract sorts of meaning and logical relations can be represented by spatial relations. Two images in sequence may indicate \"if this, then that\" or \"despite this, that\". Freud thought the dream started with \"dream thoughts\" which were like logical, verbal sentences. He believed that the dream thought was in the nature of a taboo wish that would awaken the dreamer. In order to safeguard sleep, the mindbrain converts and disguises the verbal dream thought into an imagistic form, through processes he called the \"dream-work.\n\n=== List of subfields ===\nSubfields that have sprouted out of semiotics include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n*'''[[Biosemiotics]]''': the study of semiotic processes at all levels of biology, or a semiotic study of living systems (e.g., [[Copenhagen\u2013Tartu School]]).

The interpretant may be \"immediate\" to the sign, all that the sign immediately expresses, such as a word's usual meaning; or \"dynamic\", such as a state of agitation; or \"final\" or \"normal\", the ultimate ramifications of the sign about its object, to which inquiry taken far enough would be destined and with which any interpretant, at most, may coincide.<ref>See Peirce, excerpt from a letter to William James, March 14, 1909, ''Collected Papers'' v. 8, paragraph 314.

He came c.&nbsp;1903<ref>Peirce, ''Collected Papers'' v. 2, paragraphs 243\u2013263, written c.&nbsp;1903.</ref> to [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)|classify any sign]] by three interdependent trichotomies, intersecting to form ten (rather than 27) classes of sign.<ref>He worked on but did not perfect a finer-grained system of ten trichotomies, to be combined into 66 ([[Triangular number|''T''<sub>''n''+1</sub>]]) classes of sign. That raised for Peirce 59,049 classificatory questions (59,049 = 3<SUP>10</SUP>, or 3 to the 10th power). See p. 482 in \"Excerpts from Letters to Lady Welby\", ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2.</ref> Signs also enter into various kinds of meaningful combinations; Peirce covered both semantic and syntactical issues in his speculative grammar. He regarded formal semiotic as logic ''per se'' and part of philosophy; as also encompassing study of arguments ([[Abductive reasoning|hypothetical]], [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]]) and inquiry's methods including pragmatism; and as allied to, but distinct from logic's pure mathematics. In addition to pragmatism, Peirce provided a definition of \"sign\" as a ''representamen'', in order to bring out the fact that a sign is something that \"represents\" something else in order to suggest it (that is, \"re-present\" it) in some way:<ref name=\"CREDO Reference\">{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Michael|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/wileylitcul/semiotics|title=The Encyclopedia of Literary and Cultural Theory|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-8312-3|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref>{{Ref|NoteH|[H]}} <blockquote>\"A sign, or representamen, is something which stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity. It addresses somebody, that is, creates in the mind of that person an equivalent sign. That sign which it creates I call the interpretant of the first sign. The sign stands for something, its object not in all respects, but in reference to a sort of idea.\" </blockquote>[[Ferdinand de Saussure|'''Ferdinand de Saussure''']] (1857\u20131913), the \"father\" of modern [[linguistics]], proposed a dualistic notion of signs, relating the ''signifier'' as the form of the word or phrase uttered, to the ''signified'' as the mental concept. According to Saussure, the sign is completely arbitrary\u2014i.e., there is no necessary connection between the sign and its meaning. This sets him apart from previous philosophers, such as [[Plato]] or the [[Scholasticism|scholastics]], who thought that there must be some connection between a signifier and the object it signifies. In his ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'', Saussure credits the American linguist [[William Dwight Whitney]] (1827\u20131894) with insisting on the arbitrary nature of the sign. Saussure's insistence on the arbitrariness of the sign also has influenced later philosophers and theorists such as [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Roland Barthes]], and [[Jean Baudrillard]]. Ferdinand de Saussure coined the term ''s\u00e9miologie'' while teaching his landmark \"Course on General Linguistics\" at the [[University of Geneva]] from 1906 to 1911. Saussure posited that no word is inherently meaningful. Rather a word is only a \"signifier.\" i.e., the representation of something, and it must be combined in the brain with the \"signified\", or the thing itself, in order to form a meaning-imbued \"sign.\" Saussure believed that dismantling signs was a real science, for in doing so we come to an empirical understanding of how humans synthesize physical stimuli into words and other abstract concepts.\n\n[[Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll|'''Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll''']] (1864\u20131944) studied the [[sign process]]es in animals. He used the German word ''[[umwelt]]'', \"environment,\" to describe the individual's subjective world, and he invented the concept of functional circle (''funktionskreis'') as a general model of sign processes. In his ''Theory of Meaning'' (''Bedeutungslehre'', 1940), he described the semiotic approach to [[biology]], thus establishing the field that now is called [[biosemiotics]].\n\n[[Valentin Voloshinov|'''Valentin Voloshinov''']] (1895\u20131936) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-Russian linguist, whose work has been influential in the field of [[literary theory]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Ideology|theory of ideology]]. Written in the late 1920s in the USSR, Voloshinov's ''Marxism and the Philosophy of Language'' ({{Lang-ru|Marksizm i Filosofiya Yazyka}}) developed a counter-Saussurean linguistics, which situated language use in social process rather than in an entirely decontextualized Saussurean ''langue''.\n\n[[Louis Hjelmslev|'''Louis Hjelmslev''']] (1899\u20131965) developed a formalist approach to Saussure's structuralist theories. His best known work is ''Prolegomena to a Theory of Language'', which was expanded in ''R\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the Theory of Language'', a formal development of ''glossematics'', his scientific calculus of language.\n\n[[Charles W. Morris|'''Charles W. Morris''']] (1901\u20131979): Unlike his mentor [[George Herbert Mead]], Morris was a behaviorist and sympathetic to the [[Vienna Circle]] [[positivism]] of his colleague, [[Rudolf Carnap]]. Morris was accused by [[John Dewey]] of misreading Peirce.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dewey|first1=John|year=1946|title=Peirce's Theory of Linguistic Signs, Thought, and Meaning|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=43|issue=4|pages=85\u201395|doi=10.2307/2019493|jstor=2019493}}</ref>\n\nIn his 1938 ''Foundations of the Theory of Signs'', he defined semiotics as grouped into three branches:\n\n# '''Semantics''': deals with the formal properties and interrelation of signs and symbols, without regard to meaning.\n# '''Syntactics'''/'''Syntax''': deals with the formal structures of signs, particularly the relation between signs and the objects to which they apply (i.e. signs to their designata, and the objects that they may or do denote).\n# '''Pragmatics''': deals with the biotic aspects of semiosis, including all the psychological, biological, and sociological phenomena that occur in the functioning of signs. Pragmatics is concerned with the relation between the sign system and sign-using agents or interpreters (i.e., the human or animal users). \n\n[[Thure von Uexk\u00fcll|'''Thure von Uexk\u00fcll''']] (1908\u20132004), the \"father\" of modern [[psychosomatic medicine]], developed a diagnostic method based on semiotic and biosemiotic analyses.\n\n[[Roland Barthes|'''Roland Barthes''']] (1915\u20131980) was a French literary theorist and semiotician. He often would critique pieces of cultural material to expose how bourgeois society used them to impose its values upon others. For instance, the portrayal of wine drinking in French society as a robust and healthy habit would be a bourgeois ideal perception contradicted by certain realities (i.e. that wine can be unhealthy and inebriating). He found semiotics useful in conducting these critiques. Barthes explained that these bourgeois cultural myths were second-order signs, or connotations. A picture of a full, dark bottle is a sign, a signifier relating to a signified: a fermented, alcoholic beverage\u2014wine. However, the bourgeois take this signified and apply their own emphasis to it, making \"wine\" a new signifier, this time relating to a new signified: the idea of healthy, robust, relaxing wine. Motivations for such manipulations vary from a desire to sell products to a simple desire to maintain the status quo. These insights brought Barthes very much in line with similar Marxist theory.[[File:Exemple de signalement visuel du statut social chez un Cichlid\u00e9.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Signaling and communication between the ''[[Astatotilapia burtoni]]'']][[Algirdas Julien Greimas|'''Algirdas Julien Greimas''']] (1917\u20131992) developed a structural version of semiotics named, \"generative semiotics\", trying to shift the focus of discipline from signs to systems of signification.

Sebeok''']] (1920\u20132001), a student of Charles W. Morris, was a prolific and wide-ranging American semiotician. Although he insisted that animals are not capable of language, he expanded the purview of semiotics to include non-human signaling and communication systems, thus raising some of the issues addressed by [[philosophy of mind]] and coining the term [[zoosemiotics]]. Sebeok insisted that all communication was made possible by the relationship between an organism and the environment in which it lives. He also posed the equation between ''semiosis'' (the activity of interpreting signs) and ''life''\u2014a view that the [[Copenhagen-Tartu biosemiotic school]] has further developed.\n\n[[Yuri Lotman|'''Yuri Lotman''']] (1922\u20131993) was the founding member of the [[Tartu]] (or Tartu-Moscow) [[Tartu-Moscow Semiotic School|Semiotic School]].

Among his Moscow colleagues were [[Vladimir Toporov]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and [[Boris Uspensky]].\n\n[[Christian Metz (critic)|'''Christian Metz''']] (1931\u20131993) pioneered the application of Saussurean semiotics to [[film theory]], applying [[syntagmatic analysis]] to scenes of films and grounding [[film semiotics]] in greater context.\n\n[[Eliseo Ver\u00f3n|'''Eliseo Ver\u00f3n''']] (1935\u20132014) developed his \"Social Discourse Theory\" inspired in the Peircian conception of \"Semiosis\".\n\n'''The M\u00b5 Group''' ([[Groupe \u00b5]]) (founded 1967) developed a structural version of [[rhetorics]], and the [[visual semiotics]].\n\n[[Umberto Eco|'''Umberto Eco''']] (1932\u20132016) was an [[Italy|Italian]] novelist, semiotician and academic. He made a wider audience aware of semiotics by various publications, most notably ''A Theory of Semiotics'' and his novel, ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', which includes (second to its plot) applied semiotic operations. His most important contributions to the field bear on interpretation, encyclopedia, and model reader. He also criticized in several works (''A theory of semiotics'', ''La struttura assente'', ''Le signe'', ''La production de signes'') the \"iconism\" or \"iconic signs\" (taken from Peirce's most famous triadic relation, based on indexes, icons, and symbols), to which he proposed four modes of sign production: recognition, ostension, replica, and invention.\n\n'''Paul Bouissac''' (1934\u2013) A world renowned expert of circus studies, Bouissac is known for developing a range of semiotic interpretations of circus performances.

She uses psychoanalytical concepts together with the semiotics, distinguishing the two components in the signification, the symbolic and the semiotic''.'' Kristeva also studies the representation of women and women's bodies in popular culture, such as [[Misogyny in horror films|slasher films]] and has had a remarkable influence on feminism and feminist literary studies.\n\n==Current applications==\n[[File:Chart Semiotics of Social Networking.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Chart [[semiotics of social networking]]]]\nSome applications of semiotics include:\n*Representation of a [[methodology]] for the analysis of \"texts\" regardless of [[modality (Semiotics)|the medium in which it is presented]]. For these purposes, \"text\" is any message preserved in a form whose existence is independent of both sender and receiver;\n*By scholars and professional researchers as a method to interpret meanings behind symbols and how the meanings are created;\n*Potential improvement of [[ergonomic]] design in situations where it is important to ensure that human beings are able to interact more effectively with their environments, whether it be on a large scale, as in [[architecture]], or on a small scale, such as the configuration of instrumentation for human use; and\n*[[Marketing communications|Marketing]]: Epure, Eisenstat, and Dinu (2014) express that \"semiotics allows for the practical distinction of persuasion from manipulation in marketing communication.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Epure|first1=M.|last2=Eisenstat|first2=E.|last3=Dinu|first3=C.|year=2014|title=Semiotics And Persuasion In Marketing Communication|url=https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=30143|journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations|volume=13|pages=592\u2013605}}</ref>{{Rp|592}} Semiotics are used in marketing as a [[Marketing strategy|persuasive device]] to influence buyers to change their attitudes and behaviors in the market place. There are two ways that Epure, Eisenstat, and Dinu (2014) state in which semiotics are used:\n*#'''Surface''': signs are used to create personality for the product; creativity plays its foremost role at this level.\n*#'''Underlying''': the concealed meaning of the text, imagery, sounds, etc.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn some countries, the role of semiotics is limited to [[literary criticism]] and an appreciation of audio and visual media. This narrow focus may inhibit a more general study of the social and political forces shaping how different media are used and their dynamic status within modern culture. Issues of technological [[determinism]] in the choice of media and the design of communication strategies assume new importance in this age of mass media.\n\n===Main institutions===\n\nA world organisation of semioticians, the [[International Association for Semiotic Studies]], and its journal ''[[Semiotica]]'', was established in 1969. The larger research centers together with teaching program include the semiotics departments at the [[University of Tartu]], [[University of Limoges]], [[Aarhus University]], and [[Bologna University]].\n\n=== Publications ===\nPublication of research is both in dedicated journals such as ''[[Sign Systems Studies]]'', established by [[Yuri Lotman]] and published by [[Tartu University Press]]; ''[[Semiotica]]'', founded by [[Thomas A. Sebeok]] and published by [[Mouton de Gruyter]]; ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Semiotik''; ''European Journal of Semiotics''; ''[[Versus (journal)|Versus]]'' (founded and directed by [[Umberto Eco]]), et al.; ''[[The American Journal of Semiotics]]''; and as articles accepted in periodicals of other disciplines, especially journals oriented toward philosophy and cultural criticism.\n\nThe major semiotic book series ''Semiotics, Communication, Cognition'', published by [[De Gruyter Mouton]] (series editors Paul Cobley and [[Kalevi Kull]]) replaces the former \"Approaches to Semiotics\" (more than 120 volumes) and \"Approaches to Applied Semiotics\" (series editor [[Thomas A. Sebeok]]).

A [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] is anything that communicates a meaning, that is not the sign itself, to the interpreter of the sign. The meaning can be intentional such as a word uttered with a specific meaning, or unintentional, such as a symptom being a sign of a particular medical condition. Signs can communicate through any of the senses, [[Visual system|visual]], [[Hearing|auditory]], [[Somatosensory system|tactile]], [[Olfaction|olfactory]], or [[taste|gustatory]].\n\nThe semiotic tradition explores the study of signs and symbols as a significant part of communications. Unlike linguistics, semiotics also studies non-linguistic [[sign system]]s. Semiotics includes the study of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and sign processes, indication, designation, likeness, [[analogy]], [[allegory]], [[metonymy]], [[metaphor]], [[symbol]]ism, signification, and communication. \n\nSemiotics is frequently seen as having important [[anthropology|anthropological]] and [[sociology|sociological]] dimensions; for example, the Italian semiotician and novelist [[Umberto Eco]] proposed that every cultural phenomenon may be studied as communication.<ref name=caesar>{{cite book |last= Caesar |first= Michael |title= ''Umberto Eco: Philosophy, Semiotics, and the Work of Fiction'' |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |year= 1999 |isbn= 978-0-7456-0850-1 |page= 55}}</ref> Some semioticians focus on the [[logic]]al dimensions of the science, however. They examine areas belonging also to the [[life sciences]]\u2014such as how organisms make predictions about, and adapt to, their semiotic [[ecological niche|niche]] in the world (see [[semiosis]]). In general, semiotic theories take ''signs'' or sign systems as their object of study: the communication of information in living organisms is covered in [[biosemiotics]] (including [[zoosemiotics]] and [[phytosemiotics]]).\n\nSemiotics is not to be confused with the [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] tradition called [[Ferdinand de Saussure#Semiology|semiology]], which is a subset of semiotics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.joensuu.fi/~whamalai/skc/semiology.html |title=Semiology vs. semiotics|website=University of Eastern Finland |access-date=23 April 2019}}</ref><ref>\"The science of communication studied through the interpretation of signs and symbols as they operate in various fields, esp. language\", ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2003)</ref>\n\n==History and terminology==\nThe importance of signs and signification has been recognized throughout much of the history of [[philosophy]], and in psychology as well.

In his personal library were two editions of Scapula's 1579 abridgement of [[Henri Estienne|Henricus Stephanus]]' ''Thesaurus Graecae Linguae'', which listed ''\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae'' as the name for \"diagnostics,\"<ref>\"Semiotics.\" ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (1989). [\"The branch of medical science relating to the interpretation of symptoms.\"]</ref> the branch of medicine concerned with interpreting symptoms of disease (\"[[symptomatology]]\").

In the 4th edition of Locke's ''Essay'' (1700), a new Chapter XIX, titled \"Of Enthusiasm,\" is inserted into Book IV. As result, Chapter XX of the 1st edition becomes Chapter XXI for all subsequent editions.

The two faucets (taps) probably were sold as a coded set, but the code is unusable (and ignored), as there is a single water supply.]]\nSemioticians classify signs or sign systems in relation to the way they are transmitted (see [[modality (semiotics)|modality]]). This process of carrying meaning depends on the use of [[code (semiotics)|codes]] that may be the individual sounds or letters that humans use to form words, the body movements they make to show attitude or emotion, or even something as general as the clothes they wear. To [[neologism|coin]] a word to refer to a ''thing'' (see [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] words), the [[community]] must agree on a simple meaning (a [[denotation (semiotics)|denotative]] meaning) within their language, but that word can transmit that meaning only within the language's grammatical structures and codes (see [[syntax]] and [[semantics]]). Codes also represent the [[value (semiotics)|values]] of the [[culture]], and are able to add new shades of [[connotation (semiotics)|connotation]] to every aspect of life.\n\nTo explain the relationship between semiotics and [[communication studies]], [[communication]] is defined as the process of transferring data and-or meaning from a source to a receiver. Hence, communication theorists construct models based on codes, media, and [[context (language use)|context]]s to explain the [[biology]], [[psychology]], and [[mechanics]] involved. Both disciplines recognize that the technical process cannot be separated from the fact that the receiver must [[decode (semiotics)|decode]] the data, i.e., be able to distinguish the data as [[Salience (semiotics)|salient]], and make meaning out of it. This implies that there is a necessary overlap between semiotics and communication. Indeed, many of the concepts are shared, although in each field the emphasis is different. In ''Messages and Meanings: An Introduction to Semiotics'', [[Marcel Danesi]] (1994) suggested that semioticians' priorities were to study [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]] first, and communication second. A more extreme view is offered by [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] (1987; trans. 1990: 16){{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=Name and year provided with no proper citation or inclusion of work in bibliography}}, who, as a [[musicology|musicologist]], considered the theoretical study of communication irrelevant to his application of semiotics.\n\n=== Syntactics ===\n{{anchor|Syntactics|syntactics}}\nSemiotics differs from [[linguistics]] in that it generalizes the definition of a sign to encompass signs in any medium or sensory modality. Thus it broadens the range of sign systems and sign relations, and extends the definition of language in what amounts to its widest analogical or metaphorical sense. The branch of semiotics that deals with such formal relations between signs or expressions in abstraction from their signification and their interpreters,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/syntactics |title=Definition of Syntactics by Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster Inc. |access-date=May 29, 2019}}</ref> or\u2014more generally\u2014with formal properties of symbol systems<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/syntactics |title=Syntactics definition and meaning|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |access-date=May 29, 2019}}</ref> (specifically, with reference to linguistic signs, [[syntax]])<ref>{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|Syntactics}}</ref> is referred to as '''syntactics'''.\n\nPeirce's definition of the term \"semiotic\" as the study of necessary features of signs also has the effect of distinguishing the discipline from linguistics as the study of contingent features that the world's languages happen to have acquired in the course of their evolutions. From a subjective standpoint, perhaps more difficult is the distinction between semiotics and the [[philosophy of language]]. In a sense, the difference lies between separate traditions rather than subjects. Different authors have called themselves \"philosopher of language\" or \"semiotician\". This difference does ''not'' match the separation between [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]. On a closer look, there may be found some differences regarding subjects. Philosophy of language pays more attention to [[natural language]]s or to languages in general, while semiotics is deeply concerned with non-linguistic signification. Philosophy of language also bears connections to linguistics, while semiotics might appear closer to some of the [[humanities]] (including [[literary theory]]) and to [[cultural anthropology]].\n\n=== Cognitive semiotics ===\nSemiosis or ''semeiosis'' is the process that forms meaning from any organism's apprehension of the world through signs. Scholars who have talked about semiosis in their subtheories of semiotics include [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.&nbsp;S. Peirce]], [[John Deely]], and [[Umberto Eco]]. Cognitive semiotics is combining methods and theories developed in the disciplines of cognitive methods and theories developed in semiotics and the humanities, with providing new information into human signification and its manifestation in cultural practices. The research on cognitive semiotics brings together semiotics from linguistics, cognitive science, and related disciplines on a common meta-theoretical platform of concepts, methods, and shared data.\n\n[[Cognitive semiotics]] may also be seen as the study of meaning-making by employing and integrating methods and theories developed in the cognitive sciences. This involves conceptual and textual analysis as well as experimental investigations. Cognitive semiotics initially was developed at the Center for Semiotics at [[Aarhus University]] ([[Denmark]]), with an important connection with the Center of Functionally Integrated Neuroscience (CFIN) at Aarhus Hospital. Amongst the prominent cognitive semioticians are [[Per Aage Brandt]], Svend \u00d8stergaard, Peer Bundg\u00e5rd, Frederik Stjernfelt, Mikkel Wallentin, Kristian Tyl\u00e9n, Riccardo Fusaroli, and Jordan Zlatev.

The theory contends that the levels of reproduction that technology is bringing to human environments demands this reprioritisation if semiotics is to remain relevant in the face of effectively infinite signs.

While [[art history]] has limited its visual analysis to a small number of pictures that qualify as \"works of art\", pictorial semiotics focuses on the properties of pictures in a general sense, and on how the artistic conventions of images can be interpreted through pictorial codes. Pictorial codes are the way in which viewers of pictorial representations seem automatically to decipher the artistic conventions of images by being unconsciously familiar with them.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Pictorial Codes|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100326343?rskey=TyYRDS&result=6|publisher=Oxford University Press, n.d.

Some influences have been drawn from phenomenological analysis, cognitive psychology, structuralist, and cognitivist linguistics, and visual anthropology and sociology.\n\n===Globalization===\nStudies have shown that semiotics may be used to make or break a [[brand]]. [[Culture code]]s strongly influence whether a population likes or dislikes a brand's marketing, especially internationally. If the company is unaware of a culture's codes, it runs the risk of failing in its marketing. [[Globalization]] has caused the development of a global consumer culture where products have similar associations, whether positive or negative, across numerous markets.<ref name=\"Alden\">{{cite journal|last1=Alden|first1=Dana L|last2=Steenkamp|first2=Jan-Benedict E.

In contrast, [[Disneyland Paris]] failed when it launched as [[Euro Disney S.C.A.|Euro Disney]] because the company did not research the codes underlying European culture. Its storybook retelling of European folktales was taken as [[Elitism|elitist]] and insulting, and the strict appearance standards that it had for employees resulted in discrimination lawsuits in France. Disney souvenirs were perceived as cheap trinkets.

[[Sigmund Freud]]<ref>Freud, Sigmund. 1900 [1899]. ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]].'' London: [[Hogarth Press|Hogarth]]</ref> spelled out how meaning in dreams rests on a blend of images, affects, sounds, words, and kinesthetic sensations. In his chapter on \"The Means of Representation,\" he showed how the most abstract sorts of meaning and logical relations can be represented by spatial relations. Two images in sequence may indicate \"if this, then that\" or \"despite this, that\". Freud thought the dream started with \"dream thoughts\" which were like logical, verbal sentences. He believed that the dream thought was in the nature of a taboo wish that would awaken the dreamer. In order to safeguard sleep, the mindbrain converts and disguises the verbal dream thought into an imagistic form, through processes he called the \"dream-work.\n\n=== List of subfields ===\nSubfields that have sprouted out of semiotics include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n*'''[[Biosemiotics]]''': the study of semiotic processes at all levels of biology, or a semiotic study of living systems (e.g., [[Copenhagen\u2013Tartu School]]).

The interpretant may be \"immediate\" to the sign, all that the sign immediately expresses, such as a word's usual meaning; or \"dynamic\", such as a state of agitation; or \"final\" or \"normal\", the ultimate ramifications of the sign about its object, to which inquiry taken far enough would be destined and with which any interpretant, at most, may coincide.<ref>See Peirce, excerpt from a letter to William James, March 14, 1909, ''Collected Papers'' v. 8, paragraph 314.

He came c.&nbsp;1903<ref>Peirce, ''Collected Papers'' v. 2, paragraphs 243\u2013263, written c.&nbsp;1903.</ref> to [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)|classify any sign]] by three interdependent trichotomies, intersecting to form ten (rather than 27) classes of sign.<ref>He worked on but did not perfect a finer-grained system of ten trichotomies, to be combined into 66 ([[Triangular number|''T''<sub>''n''+1</sub>]]) classes of sign. That raised for Peirce 59,049 classificatory questions (59,049 = 3<SUP>10</SUP>, or 3 to the 10th power). See p. 482 in \"Excerpts from Letters to Lady Welby\", ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2.</ref> Signs also enter into various kinds of meaningful combinations; Peirce covered both semantic and syntactical issues in his speculative grammar. He regarded formal semiotic as logic ''per se'' and part of philosophy; as also encompassing study of arguments ([[Abductive reasoning|hypothetical]], [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]]) and inquiry's methods including pragmatism; and as allied to, but distinct from logic's pure mathematics. In addition to pragmatism, Peirce provided a definition of \"sign\" as a ''representamen'', in order to bring out the fact that a sign is something that \"represents\" something else in order to suggest it (that is, \"re-present\" it) in some way:<ref name=\"CREDO Reference\">{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Michael|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/wileylitcul/semiotics|title=The Encyclopedia of Literary and Cultural Theory|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-8312-3|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref>{{Ref|NoteH|[H]}} <blockquote>\"A sign, or representamen, is something which stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity. It addresses somebody, that is, creates in the mind of that person an equivalent sign. That sign which it creates I call the interpretant of the first sign. The sign stands for something, its object not in all respects, but in reference to a sort of idea.\" </blockquote>[[Ferdinand de Saussure|'''Ferdinand de Saussure''']] (1857\u20131913), the \"father\" of modern [[linguistics]], proposed a dualistic notion of signs, relating the ''signifier'' as the form of the word or phrase uttered, to the ''signified'' as the mental concept. According to Saussure, the sign is completely arbitrary\u2014i.e., there is no necessary connection between the sign and its meaning. This sets him apart from previous philosophers, such as [[Plato]] or the [[Scholasticism|scholastics]], who thought that there must be some connection between a signifier and the object it signifies. In his ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'', Saussure credits the American linguist [[William Dwight Whitney]] (1827\u20131894) with insisting on the arbitrary nature of the sign. Saussure's insistence on the arbitrariness of the sign also has influenced later philosophers and theorists such as [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Roland Barthes]], and [[Jean Baudrillard]]. Ferdinand de Saussure coined the term ''s\u00e9miologie'' while teaching his landmark \"Course on General Linguistics\" at the [[University of Geneva]] from 1906 to 1911. Saussure posited that no word is inherently meaningful. Rather a word is only a \"signifier.\" i.e., the representation of something, and it must be combined in the brain with the \"signified\", or the thing itself, in order to form a meaning-imbued \"sign.\" Saussure believed that dismantling signs was a real science, for in doing so we come to an empirical understanding of how humans synthesize physical stimuli into words and other abstract concepts.\n\n[[Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll|'''Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll''']] (1864\u20131944) studied the [[sign process]]es in animals. He used the German word ''[[umwelt]]'', \"environment,\" to describe the individual's subjective world, and he invented the concept of functional circle (''funktionskreis'') as a general model of sign processes. In his ''Theory of Meaning'' (''Bedeutungslehre'', 1940), he described the semiotic approach to [[biology]], thus establishing the field that now is called [[biosemiotics]].\n\n[[Valentin Voloshinov|'''Valentin Voloshinov''']] (1895\u20131936) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-Russian linguist, whose work has been influential in the field of [[literary theory]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Ideology|theory of ideology]]. Written in the late 1920s in the USSR, Voloshinov's ''Marxism and the Philosophy of Language'' ({{Lang-ru|Marksizm i Filosofiya Yazyka}}) developed a counter-Saussurean linguistics, which situated language use in social process rather than in an entirely decontextualized Saussurean ''langue''.\n\n[[Louis Hjelmslev|'''Louis Hjelmslev''']] (1899\u20131965) developed a formalist approach to Saussure's structuralist theories. His best known work is ''Prolegomena to a Theory of Language'', which was expanded in ''R\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the Theory of Language'', a formal development of ''glossematics'', his scientific calculus of language.\n\n[[Charles W. Morris|'''Charles W. Morris''']] (1901\u20131979): Unlike his mentor [[George Herbert Mead]], Morris was a behaviorist and sympathetic to the [[Vienna Circle]] [[positivism]] of his colleague, [[Rudolf Carnap]]. Morris was accused by [[John Dewey]] of misreading Peirce.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dewey|first1=John|year=1946|title=Peirce's Theory of Linguistic Signs, Thought, and Meaning|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=43|issue=4|pages=85\u201395|doi=10.2307/2019493|jstor=2019493}}</ref>\n\nIn his 1938 ''Foundations of the Theory of Signs'', he defined semiotics as grouped into three branches:\n\n# '''Semantics''': deals with the formal properties and interrelation of signs and symbols, without regard to meaning.\n# '''Syntactics'''/'''Syntax''': deals with the formal structures of signs, particularly the relation between signs and the objects to which they apply (i.e. signs to their designata, and the objects that they may or do denote).\n# '''Pragmatics''': deals with the biotic aspects of semiosis, including all the psychological, biological, and sociological phenomena that occur in the functioning of signs. Pragmatics is concerned with the relation between the sign system and sign-using agents or interpreters (i.e., the human or animal users). \n\n[[Thure von Uexk\u00fcll|'''Thure von Uexk\u00fcll''']] (1908\u20132004), the \"father\" of modern [[psychosomatic medicine]], developed a diagnostic method based on semiotic and biosemiotic analyses.\n\n[[Roland Barthes|'''Roland Barthes''']] (1915\u20131980) was a French literary theorist and semiotician. He often would critique pieces of cultural material to expose how bourgeois society used them to impose its values upon others. For instance, the portrayal of wine drinking in French society as a robust and healthy habit would be a bourgeois ideal perception contradicted by certain realities (i.e. that wine can be unhealthy and inebriating). He found semiotics useful in conducting these critiques. Barthes explained that these bourgeois cultural myths were second-order signs, or connotations. A picture of a full, dark bottle is a sign, a signifier relating to a signified: a fermented, alcoholic beverage\u2014wine. However, the bourgeois take this signified and apply their own emphasis to it, making \"wine\" a new signifier, this time relating to a new signified: the idea of healthy, robust, relaxing wine. Motivations for such manipulations vary from a desire to sell products to a simple desire to maintain the status quo. These insights brought Barthes very much in line with similar Marxist theory.[[File:Exemple de signalement visuel du statut social chez un Cichlid\u00e9.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Signaling and communication between the ''[[Astatotilapia burtoni]]'']][[Algirdas Julien Greimas|'''Algirdas Julien Greimas''']] (1917\u20131992) developed a structural version of semiotics named, \"generative semiotics\", trying to shift the focus of discipline from signs to systems of signification. His theories develop the ideas of Saussure, Hjelmslev, [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]], and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]].\n\n[[Thomas A. Sebeok|'''Thomas A. Sebeok''']] (1920\u20132001), a student of Charles W. Morris, was a prolific and wide-ranging American semiotician. Although he insisted that animals are not capable of language, he expanded the purview of semiotics to include non-human signaling and communication systems, thus raising some of the issues addressed by [[philosophy of mind]] and coining the term [[zoosemiotics]]. Sebeok insisted that all communication was made possible by the relationship between an organism and the environment in which it lives. He also posed the equation between ''semiosis'' (the activity of interpreting signs) and ''life''\u2014a view that the [[Copenhagen-Tartu biosemiotic school]] has further developed.\n\n[[Yuri Lotman|'''Yuri Lotman''']] (1922\u20131993) was the founding member of the [[Tartu]] (or Tartu-Moscow) [[Tartu-Moscow Semiotic School|Semiotic School]].

He also introduced the concept of the [[semiosphere]]. Among his Moscow colleagues were [[Vladimir Toporov]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and [[Boris Uspensky]].\n\n[[Christian Metz (critic)|'''Christian Metz''']] (1931\u20131993) pioneered the application of Saussurean semiotics to [[film theory]], applying [[syntagmatic analysis]] to scenes of films and grounding [[film semiotics]] in greater context.\n\n[[Eliseo Ver\u00f3n|'''Eliseo Ver\u00f3n''']] (1935\u20132014) developed his \"Social Discourse Theory\" inspired in the Peircian conception of \"Semiosis\".\n\n'''The M\u00b5 Group''' ([[Groupe \u00b5]]) (founded 1967) developed a structural version of [[rhetorics]], and the [[visual semiotics]].\n\n[[Umberto Eco|'''Umberto Eco''']] (1932\u20132016) was an [[Italy|Italian]] novelist, semiotician and academic. He made a wider audience aware of semiotics by various publications, most notably ''A Theory of Semiotics'' and his novel, ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', which includes (second to its plot) applied semiotic operations. His most important contributions to the field bear on interpretation, encyclopedia, and model reader. He also criticized in several works (''A theory of semiotics'', ''La struttura assente'', ''Le signe'', ''La production de signes'') the \"iconism\" or \"iconic signs\" (taken from Peirce's most famous triadic relation, based on indexes, icons, and symbols), to which he proposed four modes of sign production: recognition, ostension, replica, and invention.\n\n'''Paul Bouissac''' (1934\u2013) A world renowned expert of circus studies, Bouissac is known for developing a range of semiotic interpretations of circus performances.

The personal, professional, and intellectual life of Bouissac is recounted in the book, ''The Pleasures of Time: Two Men, A Life'', by his life-long partner, the sociologist Stephen Harold Riggins.\n\n[[Julia Kristeva|'''Julia Kristeva''']] (1941\u2013), a student of [[Lucien Goldmann]] and [[Roland Barthes]], Bulgarian-French semiotician, [[literary critic]], [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], [[French feminist|feminist]], and [[novelist]]. She uses psychoanalytical concepts together with the semiotics, distinguishing the two components in the signification, the symbolic and the semiotic''.'' Kristeva also studies the representation of women and women's bodies in popular culture, such as [[Misogyny in horror films|slasher films]] and has had a remarkable influence on feminism and feminist literary studies.\n\n==Current applications==\n[[File:Chart Semiotics of Social Networking.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Chart [[semiotics of social networking]]]]\nSome applications of semiotics include:\n*Representation of a [[methodology]] for the analysis of \"texts\" regardless of [[modality (Semiotics)|the medium in which it is presented]]. For these purposes, \"text\" is any message preserved in a form whose existence is independent of both sender and receiver;\n*By scholars and professional researchers as a method to interpret meanings behind symbols and how the meanings are created;\n*Potential improvement of [[ergonomic]] design in situations where it is important to ensure that human beings are able to interact more effectively with their environments, whether it be on a large scale, as in [[architecture]], or on a small scale, such as the configuration of instrumentation for human use; and\n*[[Marketing communications|Marketing]]: Epure, Eisenstat, and Dinu (2014) express that \"semiotics allows for the practical distinction of persuasion from manipulation in marketing communication.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Epure|first1=M.|last2=Eisenstat|first2=E.|last3=Dinu|first3=C.|year=2014|title=Semiotics And Persuasion In Marketing Communication|url=https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=30143|journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations|volume=13|pages=592\u2013605}}</ref>{{Rp|592}} Semiotics are used in marketing as a [[Marketing strategy|persuasive device]] to influence buyers to change their attitudes and behaviors in the market place. There are two ways that Epure, Eisenstat, and Dinu (2014) state in which semiotics are used:\n*#'''Surface''': signs are used to create personality for the product; creativity plays its foremost role at this level.\n*#'''Underlying''': the concealed meaning of the text, imagery, sounds, etc.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn some countries, the role of semiotics is limited to [[literary criticism]] and an appreciation of audio and visual media. This narrow focus may inhibit a more general study of the social and political forces shaping how different media are used and their dynamic status within modern culture. Issues of technological [[determinism]] in the choice of media and the design of communication strategies assume new importance in this age of mass media.\n\n===Main institutions===\n\nA world organisation of semioticians, the [[International Association for Semiotic Studies]], and its journal ''[[Semiotica]]'', was established in 1969. The larger research centers together with teaching program include the semiotics departments at the [[University of Tartu]], [[University of Limoges]], [[Aarhus University]], and [[Bologna University]].\n\n=== Publications ===\nPublication of research is both in dedicated journals such as ''[[Sign Systems Studies]]'', established by [[Yuri Lotman]] and published by [[Tartu University Press]]; ''[[Semiotica]]'', founded by [[Thomas A. Sebeok]] and published by [[Mouton de Gruyter]]; ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Semiotik''; ''European Journal of Semiotics''; ''[[Versus (journal)|Versus]]'' (founded and directed by [[Umberto Eco]]), et al.; ''[[The American Journal of Semiotics]]''; and as articles accepted in periodicals of other disciplines, especially journals oriented toward philosophy and cultural criticism.\n\nThe major semiotic book series ''Semiotics, Communication, Cognition'', published by [[De Gruyter Mouton]] (series editors Paul Cobley and [[Kalevi Kull]]) replaces the former \"Approaches to Semiotics\" (more than 120 volumes) and \"Approaches to Applied Semiotics\" (series editor [[Thomas A. Sebeok]]). Since 1980 the [[Semiotic Society of America]] has produced an annual conference series: ''[[Semiotics: The Proceedings of the Semiotic Society of America]]''.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ethnosemiotics]]\n* [[Index of semiotics articles]]\n* [[Language-game (philosophy)]]\n* [[Medical sign]]\n* [[Outline of semiotics]]\n* [[Private language argument]]\n* [[Semiofest]]\n* [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs]]\n* [[Structuralist semiotics]]\n* [[Universal language]]\n* [[Social semiotics]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* Atkin, Albert.

The most important of these were the [[House of Courtenay|Courtenay]] [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]]. Bonville's grandfather had been a [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]] of the 11th Earl, [[Edward de Courtenay, 3rd/11th Earl of Devon|Edward]]. The historian [[Christine Carpenter (historian)|Christine Carpenter]] comments, on the family's social position, that they were of sufficiently \"landed and official status to be regarded as what might be termed 'super-knights'{{tsp}}\";{{Sfn|Carpenter|2012|p=76}} she echoed the medievalist [[K. B. McFarlane]], who had previously described the family as \"a powerful and respected element in Devon...there was no need for them to stand in dread of the great, for they were not small themselves\".{{Sfn|McFarlane|1981|p=16}}\n[[File:OldShuteHouseGreatHallFromWest.jpg|upright=1.2|alt=Late fourteenth-century section of Bonville's birthplace.|left|thumb|Very little of the original medieval manor house remains of Bonville's birthplace; the section shown here is from the late fourteenth century.]]\nWilliam Bonville was born on either 12 or 31 August 1392{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} or 1393 in [[Shute, Devon]], to John Bonville (d. 1396) and Elizabeth Fitzroger (c. 1370\u2013c. 1414).{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} William Bonville's grandfather was his namesake Sir William Bonville, who had been [[member of Parliament]] for [[Somerset]] and Devon on multiple occasions{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993a}} and has been described by a historian as one of \"the most prominent west-country gentry in the late fourteenth century\".{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} On hearing of the birth of his grandson, a contemporary reports, Sir William \"raised his hands to heaven and praised God\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Along with the [[Newenham Abbey|Abbot of Newenham]], he stood [[godparent]] to the young William.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} The younger William was heir to both his father and grandfather; the latter\u2014who had married twice\u2014had substantially expanded the family [[Inheritance|patrimony]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} He has been described by the scholar [[Ralph A. Griffiths|Ralph Griffiths]] as a \"capable, energetic and well-connected man\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}}\n\nBonville's father died when his son was four,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} and young William probably grew up in his grandfather's household.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Grandfather Bonville died in 1408,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} while Bonville was still legally a [[Minor (law)|minor]].{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} As was customary, [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]] took both Bonville's [[Ward (law)|wardship]] and marriage into his own hands. This was valuable [[Royal Patronage|royal patronage]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} which the King granted firstly to Sir [[John Tiptoft, 1st Baron Tiptoft|John Tiptoft]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1983|p=111}} and then to [[Edward, Duke of York]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} Bonville had a younger brother, Thomas, who, by the time William came of age, had already married a cousin of [[Robert Poynings|Robert, Baron Poynings]]. This connection to the Poynings family, the historian [[J. S. Roskell]] has suggested, was instrumental in Bonville's own marriage.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\n\n=== Marriages and children ===\nBonville married twice. In 1414 he married Margaret Grey, daughter of [[Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn|Reginald, Baron Grey of Ruthin]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}} Lord Grey promised to pay 200 marks{{Refn|A medieval English mark was an [[Unit of account|accounting unit]] equivalent to two-thirds of a pound.{{sfn|Harding|2002|p=xiv}}|group=note}} to Bonville on the wedding day, and Bonville likewise contracted to settle estates to the value of \u00a3100 on himself and his wife, [[Jointure|jointly]]. Grey also paid another 200 marks in instalments over the following four years.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Sometime between April 1426 and October 1427{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\u2014when Bonville received a [[papal dispensation]] to marry again\u2014Margaret Grey died. Bonville made his next marriage to Elizabeth Courtenay, widow of [[John Harington, 4th Baron Harington|John, Baron Harington]].

He was, therefore, unable to carry out his royal duties. The Lancastrian regime, already weakened by factionalism, was paralysed,{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=715}} and the national political scene became increasingly tense. Bonville attended a council at Westminster in early 1454. This, a [[Paston Letters|Paston]] correspondent reported, was only after he had \"maken all the puissance they can and may to come hider [to Westminster] with theym\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=723}} It was rumoured that Bonville was planning to join up with other lords\u2014those of Beaumont, Poynings, Clifford and Egremont\u2014and march on London itself, although in the event this did not occur.{{Sfn|Jacob|1993|p=508}}{{Refn|In other words, it was rumoured that Bonville ordered the gathering of the largest force of men (a ''puissaunce''{{sfn|MED|2014a}}) that he could, and that having done so, he brought them (''hider''{{sfn|MED|2014b}}) to Westminster with him; from a letter of 19 January 1454 from John Studley to John Paston.{{sfn|Gairdner|1986|p=299}}|group=note}} Everyone, including Bonville, was preparing for war on a national scale.{{Sfn|Tuck|1999|p=271}}\n\nThe [[House of Lords]] eventually appointed the Duke of York as [[Lord Protector|protector]] of the realm during the King's incapacitation, and York appointed Salisbury [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]]. Although Courtenay was nominally York's ally, the Earl did not see any major benefits from this relationship. (York's other allies, argues John Watts, the Nevilles, received York's assistance in their on-going feud with the Percies in Yorkshire.) Bonville experienced no lessening of his position during the protectorate;{{Sfn|Watts|1996|pp=324 + n.274, 338 n.328}} indeed, he had committed flagrant acts of piracy against foreign shipping off the southwest coast, which went unpunished. The most prominent victims of Bonville's actions were the Duke of Burgundy's merchants; Burgundy was England's ally on the continent, a position which Bonville's ships endangered.{{Sfn|Johnson|1988|p=151}}\n\n=== Battle of St Albans and Bonville's ascendency ===\nIn early 1455 King Henry made a sudden recovery. York and Salisbury were removed from their positions in government and retired to their estates. National politics, already heavily partisan, was tense. The King summoned a great council to be held in Leicester in May. Several chroniclers of the day suggest that Somerset was poisoning the King's mind against York.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=740}} He and the Nevilles may have feared imminent arrest. In any case, they reacted swiftly and with violence. They ambushed the King's small army at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] on the 22nd in a [[pre-emptive strike]]. Courtenay fought for the King and was wounded.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} Bonville may also have been sympathetic to the royal cause, as one of his [[pursuivant]]s was used as a messenger by the King's councillors. He did not join the royal army, however.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Michael Hicks has suggested that both Bonville and Courtenay were more interested in prosecuting their own feud than the national one.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=94}} King Henry had been captured by the Yorkists after the battle: once again they controlled the government.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although clearly unwilling to turn against his King at this point,{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=59}} Bonville did attend the Yorkist parliament of September 1455, where he voted in favour of the Duke of York's appointment as protector.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1984|p=78}} Bonville was appointed to the parliamentary committee set up to improve naval defence.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} He also used his local influence to ensure that the vacant [[Bishop of Exeter|Bishopric of Exeter]] was reserved for the Earl of Salisbury's youngest son, [[George Neville (Archbishop)|George Neville]],{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=149}} and in November Bonville received a general [[Royal pardon|pardon]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=770 n.202}}\n\nIn the southwest, Bonville and his ally, [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire]] (also at this time very close to the court) were recruiting heavily.{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=36}} They caused a proclamation \"to be cryed at Taunton in Somersetshire that every man that is likely and wole go with theym and serve theym shalle have ''vjd.'' [sixpence] every day as long as he abideth with theym\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Bonville's dominance in the southwest forced the Earl of Devon to respond drastically,{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=166}} and at the end of April 1454 Devon brought an armed force of hundreds of men into Exeter in a planned [[ambush]]. The plan failed, but Bonville was prevented from carrying out his duty as a collector of a royal loan.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although in the following June both Bonville and Courtenay were instructed by the King to keep the peace\u2014and each bound over for \u00a34,000 to do so\u2014they appear to have continued their war of attrition. Such was the \"anarchic state of affairs\"{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} in Devon following St Albans that the [[Michaelmas term]] judicial sessions that were due to be held in Exeter had to be cancelled. Courtenay went on to terrorise the county with his army and ransacked Bonville's houses.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} This culminated on 23 October 1455 with what has been described as the \"most notorious private crime of the century\",{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=167}} when Courtenay's son\u2014also [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon|Thomas]]\u2014and a small force of men attacked and brutally murdered one of Bonville's close councillors, the prominent local lawyer [[Nicholas Radford]].{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=168}} Carpenter comments: \"there were other enormities, principally directed against Lord Bonville.

Bonville's father died before Bonville reached adulthood. As a result, he grew up in the household of his grandfather and namesake, who was a prominent member of the Devon gentry. Both Bonville's father and grandfather had been successful in politics and land acquisition, and when Bonville came of age, he gained control of a large estate. He augmented this further by a series of lawsuits against his mother's second husband. Bonville undertook royal service, which then meant fighting in France in the later years of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In 1415, he joined the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|English invasion of France]] in the retinue of [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]], [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s brother, and fought on the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]]. Throughout his life, Bonville was despatched on further operations in France, but increasingly events in the southwest of England took up more of his time and energy, as he became [[Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud|involved in a feud]] with his powerful neighbour [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]].\n\nIn 1437, King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] granted Bonville the profitable office of steward of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. This had traditionally been a hereditary office of the earls of Devon, and the Earl was enraged at its loss. The dispute soon descended into violence, and Bonville and Courtenay ravaged each other's properties. The situation was exacerbated in 1442 when the Crown appointed Courtenay to effectively the same stewardship it had appointed Bonville, which inflamed the situation even more. The feud between them continued intermittently for the next decade. Generally, Henry and his government failed to intervene between the two parties; when it did, its efforts were ineffectual. On one occasion Bonville was persuaded to undertake further service in France\u2014primarily to get Bonville out of the region\u2014but the mission was poorly funded, a military failure, and when Bonville returned the feud reignited. In 1453, King Henry became ill and entered a [[catatonic state]] for eighteen months, heightening the political factionalism that had riven the reign.\n\nBonville generally seems to have remained loyal to the king, although his guiding motivation was to support whoever would aid him in his struggle against Courtenay. Their feud was part of a broader breakdown in law and order which eventually evolved into the [[Wars of the Roses]] in 1455. Bonville seems to have managed to avoid implication in the variable swings in political fortune which followed until 1460. At this point, he threw in his lot with the rebellious [[Richard, Duke of York]]. His new allegiance brought him little profit; his son was killed alongside York at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460, while Bonville himself took part in the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] two months later on the losing side; with [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|the new Earl of Devon]] watching, he was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] on 18 February 1461.\n\n== Background and early life ==\nThe Bonvilles were one of the major [[gentry]] families of late-fourteenth-century Devon, often working in close co-operation with their neighbours. The most important of these were the [[House of Courtenay|Courtenay]] [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]]. Bonville's grandfather had been a [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]] of the 11th Earl, [[Edward de Courtenay, 3rd/11th Earl of Devon|Edward]]. The historian [[Christine Carpenter (historian)|Christine Carpenter]] comments, on the family's social position, that they were of sufficiently \"landed and official status to be regarded as what might be termed 'super-knights'{{tsp}}\";{{Sfn|Carpenter|2012|p=76}} she echoed the medievalist [[K.

Stucley based his claim on the tradition of [[Courtesy of England|courtesy]]. On reaching his legal majority, Bonville sued his stepfather for his maternal inheritance. This struggle took over six years, but he succeeded in establishing his rights to the estates by 1422. Bonville's grandmother survived until 1426; by then Bonville had also inherited substantial estates from other relatives, including a cousin and an aunt.

Tailboys was involved in a long-running and increasingly violent feud with Lord Cromwell throughout the 1440s and 1450s, and, Virgoe suggests, probably found Bonville and the latter's connections at court of particular assistance against Cromwell.{{sfn|Virgoe|1997|p=295}}|group=note}} Suffolk's policy was one of trying to keep both Bonville and Courtenay happy.{{Sfn|Watts|1996|p=239}} Bonville's newly-acquired political proximity to Suffolk brought benefits. In 1444 Bonville joined the duke's retinue to France, where Bonville played a central role in the [[Betrothal|betrothal ceremony]] between King Henry and his bride-to-be, [[Margaret of Anjou]]. By a [[writ]] of 10 March the following year{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=353}} Bonville was elevated to the peerage.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} This was both in recognition of his successes in France{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}}\u2014it had been a \"turbulent period\" in Gascony{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=356}}\u2014but also a reflection of the esteem Suffolk held him in.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}} As Baron Bonville of Chewton; he was summoned to every parliament until the end of his life as ''Willelmo Bonville domino Bonville et de Chuton''.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} In 1446 Bonville suppressed a revolt in Somerset, in which [[Wells Cathedral]] was attacked by \"insurgents against the peace of the Church and the King\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nBonville's association with Suffolk was not to last. In early 1450, the duke was [[Impeachment|impeached in the]] House of Lords and [[exile]]d as a result. Suffolk was subsequently murdered ''en route'' to the continent. Roskell notes that, although Bonville is known to have attended this parliament, it remains unknown what position he took\u2014if he took any\u2014on Suffolk's impeachment.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}} One of the most powerful critics of Suffolk's government had been [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], and the Earl of Devon soon allied himself with the duke as a means of furthering his position in the [[West Country]]. Courtenay saw his newly-reinforced position as sufficiently secure to allow him to reignite the feud with Bonville,{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=254}} who in Taunton was recruiting men to his banner at [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]] a day.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=93}} To this end he launched a series of raids onto Bonville properties, which culminated in Courtenay's [[Besiege|besieging]] of Bonville's [[Taunton Castle]]{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=254}} with a force of over 5,000 men{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}}\u2014a crisis that the contemporary [[chronicle]]r [[William Worcester]] described as \"''maxima perturbatio''\".{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}}{{Refn|Translated to English, Worcester described it as \"the greatest disturbance\".{{sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}}|group=note}} Fighting alongside Courtenay was [[Edward Brooke, 6th Baron Cobham|Edward Brooke, Lord Cobham]], son of the Thomas Brooke whom Bonville had feuded with over a decade previously.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Courtenay's alliance with York was not as strong as the Earl believed, and when York arrived in Devon to restore order, he promptly cast both Bonville and Courtenay, with many of their retainers, into prison{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} for a month.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=692}} Bonville was forced to put Taunton Castle into the duke's custody.{{Sfn|Gillingham|1993|p=72}} This particular phase of the feud was suspended by the holding of a [[Loveday (arbitration)|loveday]] (''dies amoris'') between Bonville and Courtenay at [[Colcombe Castle|Colcombe]] in 1451. This was an important enough political event for it to warrant the attendance of [[Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers|Richard, Lord Rivers]] and his wife [[Jacquetta of Luxembourg|Jacquetta, Lady Rivers]] as the King's representatives.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=596}}\n\nThe Earl of Devon's continuing alliance with York brought Courtenay further problems in 1452. By then, York felt excluded from the government as the King had a new favourite, [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Edmund, Duke of Somerset]]. In February that year York rebelled and marched on London with a large force. He faced the King's army at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], southeast of London. Courtenay stood alongside him. Somerset and much of the rest of the nobility faced York and Courtenay down: they surrendered without a fight.{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=255}} Bonville had raised a body of men to join the King's army,{{Sfn|Goodman|1981|p=20}} and subsequently profited from Courtenay's disfavour with the King.{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=128}} The historian [[A. J. Pollard]] suggests that Bonville was given \"a free hand\" in the region as a result of York's and Devon's eclipse{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=136}} and according to Cherry, this allowed Bonville to become the predominant figure in county politics.{{Sfn|Cherry|1981b|p=132}} He was commissioned to oversee the arrest and prosecution of the Earl of Devon's men after Blackheath, and the following year King Henry demonstrated the esteem Bonville stood in when, during Henry's [[royal progress]] through the southwest, he stayed at Bonville's [[Caput baroniae|''caput'']] of Shute.{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=259}} Bonville received further offices and responsibilities. He was confirmed as steward of the Duchy of Cornwall, reappointed seneschal of Gascony and also made [[lieutenant of Aquitaine]]). Bonville has been described by historians connected to ''The [[Gascon Rolls]] Project'' as being \"an excellent choice for lieutenant\"{{sfn|Gascon Rolls|2014}}{{refn|The office of lieutenant of Aquitaine went back to at least 1278,{{sfn|Gascon Rolls|2014}} and since the [[Duke of Aquitaine]] was also King of England, the lieutenant ruled directly on the King's behalf. It was a royal appointment, usually to a close relative of the King, although it was a sporadic one, being mostly filled during periods of war or civil disturbance.{{sfn|Gribit|2016|p=13}} It was not a particularly profitable office, notes the economist [[Michael Postan]], and indeed was \"as likely to be a source of loss as gain\" for the appointee, and the King was regularly forced to provide financial inducements to those he wished to take up the post.{{sfn|Postan|1973|p=74}}|group=note}} and received the constableship of [[Exeter Castle]].{{Sfn|Storey|1999|p=165}} He also received grants of lands and estates in [[South Teign River|South Teign]], the [[Lydford Castle|castle]], borough and [[manor]] of Lydford, the [[conservancy]] of the [[River Exe]], and [[forestry rights]] in [[Dartmoor]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}} making him, wrote the historian [[Bertram Wolffe]], \"exalted in the west country\".{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=262}} Bonville never took up his seneschalcy as what remained of England's territorial possessions in France were lost at the [[Battle of Castillon]] in July 1453.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} King Henry\u2014now in Exeter\u2014appointed Bonville to a large commission of [[oyer and terminer]] to investigate sympathy for York's rebellion in the area, and the King made him a gift of \u00a350.{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|pp=259\u2013260}}\n\n=== Henry's illness and Yorkist government ===\n[[File:MapBattleOfClystHeath1455.PNG|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=map showing location of the Clyst battlefield in Devon|Map of the location of the Clyst engagement, 1455]]In August 1453, King Henry suffered a period of illness and mental collapse during which he was unable to respond to people or stimulus. He was, therefore, unable to carry out his royal duties. The Lancastrian regime, already weakened by factionalism, was paralysed,{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=715}} and the national political scene became increasingly tense. Bonville attended a council at Westminster in early 1454. This, a [[Paston Letters|Paston]] correspondent reported, was only after he had \"maken all the puissance they can and may to come hider [to Westminster] with theym\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=723}} It was rumoured that Bonville was planning to join up with other lords\u2014those of Beaumont, Poynings, Clifford and Egremont\u2014and march on London itself, although in the event this did not occur.{{Sfn|Jacob|1993|p=508}}{{Refn|In other words, it was rumoured that Bonville ordered the gathering of the largest force of men (a ''puissaunce''{{sfn|MED|2014a}}) that he could, and that having done so, he brought them (''hider''{{sfn|MED|2014b}}) to Westminster with him; from a letter of 19 January 1454 from John Studley to John Paston.{{sfn|Gairdner|1986|p=299}}|group=note}} Everyone, including Bonville, was preparing for war on a national scale.{{Sfn|Tuck|1999|p=271}}\n\nThe [[House of Lords]] eventually appointed the Duke of York as [[Lord Protector|protector]] of the realm during the King's incapacitation, and York appointed Salisbury [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]]. Although Courtenay was nominally York's ally, the Earl did not see any major benefits from this relationship. (York's other allies, argues John Watts, the Nevilles, received York's assistance in their on-going feud with the Percies in Yorkshire.) Bonville experienced no lessening of his position during the protectorate;{{Sfn|Watts|1996|pp=324 + n.274, 338 n.328}} indeed, he had committed flagrant acts of piracy against foreign shipping off the southwest coast, which went unpunished. The most prominent victims of Bonville's actions were the Duke of Burgundy's merchants; Burgundy was England's ally on the continent, a position which Bonville's ships endangered.{{Sfn|Johnson|1988|p=151}}\n\n=== Battle of St Albans and Bonville's ascendency ===\nIn early 1455 King Henry made a sudden recovery. York and Salisbury were removed from their positions in government and retired to their estates. National politics, already heavily partisan, was tense. The King summoned a great council to be held in Leicester in May. Several chroniclers of the day suggest that Somerset was poisoning the King's mind against York.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=740}} He and the Nevilles may have feared imminent arrest. In any case, they reacted swiftly and with violence. They ambushed the King's small army at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] on the 22nd in a [[pre-emptive strike]]. Courtenay fought for the King and was wounded.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} Bonville may also have been sympathetic to the royal cause, as one of his [[pursuivant]]s was used as a messenger by the King's councillors. He did not join the royal army, however.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Michael Hicks has suggested that both Bonville and Courtenay were more interested in prosecuting their own feud than the national one.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=94}} King Henry had been captured by the Yorkists after the battle: once again they controlled the government.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although clearly unwilling to turn against his King at this point,{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=59}} Bonville did attend the Yorkist parliament of September 1455, where he voted in favour of the Duke of York's appointment as protector.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1984|p=78}} Bonville was appointed to the parliamentary committee set up to improve naval defence.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} He also used his local influence to ensure that the vacant [[Bishop of Exeter|Bishopric of Exeter]] was reserved for the Earl of Salisbury's youngest son, [[George Neville (Archbishop)|George Neville]],{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=149}} and in November Bonville received a general [[Royal pardon|pardon]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=770 n.202}}\n\nIn the southwest, Bonville and his ally, [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire]] (also at this time very close to the court) were recruiting heavily.{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=36}} They caused a proclamation \"to be cryed at Taunton in Somersetshire that every man that is likely and wole go with theym and serve theym shalle have ''vjd.'' [sixpence] every day as long as he abideth with theym\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Bonville's dominance in the southwest forced the Earl of Devon to respond drastically,{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=166}} and at the end of April 1454 Devon brought an armed force of hundreds of men into Exeter in a planned [[ambush]]. The plan failed, but Bonville was prevented from carrying out his duty as a collector of a royal loan.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although in the following June both Bonville and Courtenay were instructed by the King to keep the peace\u2014and each bound over for \u00a34,000 to do so\u2014they appear to have continued their war of attrition. Such was the \"anarchic state of affairs\"{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} in Devon following St Albans that the [[Michaelmas term]] judicial sessions that were due to be held in Exeter had to be cancelled. Courtenay went on to terrorise the county with his army and ransacked Bonville's houses.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} This culminated on 23 October 1455 with what has been described as the \"most notorious private crime of the century\",{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=167}} when Courtenay's son\u2014also [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon|Thomas]]\u2014and a small force of men attacked and brutally murdered one of Bonville's close councillors, the prominent local lawyer [[Nicholas Radford]].{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=168}} Carpenter comments: \"there were other enormities, principally directed against Lord Bonville.
