A false imprisonment claim may be made based upon private acts, or upon wrongful governmental detention. For detention by the police, proof of false imprisonment provides a basis to obtain a writ of [[habeas corpus]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Overview: False Imprisonment |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095809472|website=Oxford Reference|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=6 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107043936/http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095809472|archive-date=2017-11-07|url-status=live|df=}}</ref>\n\nUnder [[common law]], false imprisonment is both a [[crime]] and a [[tort]].\n\n==Imprisonment==\n{{main|Imprisonment}}\nWithin the context of false imprisonment, an imprisonment occurs when a person is restrained from moving from a location or bounded area, as a result of a wrongful intentional act, such as the use of force, threat, coercion, or [[abuse of authority]].<ref name=\"wexfp\"/>\np just tell me where yowant me to do it ha\nThe following are examples of false imprisonment.\n* The taking hostage of a bank's customersl* The detention of a customer by a  owner (e.g., hotel operator, apartment owner, credit card company) for the failure to pay a bill.\n* A robber in a home invasion ties hostages up and takes them to a separate room.\n\n==Detention that is not false imprisonment==\nEven when a person is involuntarily detained, not all acts of detention amount to false imprisonment. The law may privilege a person to detain somebody else against their will. A legally authorized detention does not constitute false imprisonment. For example, if a parent/guardian of a child denies the child's request to leave their house, and prevents them from doing so, this would not constitute false imprisonment unless the child feels they are in danger of death or great bodily harm. False imprisonment requires an intentional act, and an accidental detention will not support a claim of false imprisonment.<ref name=\"larson\">{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=False Imprisonment and Unlawful Detention|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal-injury-and-torts/false-imprisonment-and-unlawful-detention|website=ExpertLaw|access-date=6 November 2017|date=12 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107014150/https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal-injury-and-torts/false-imprisonment-and-unlawful-detention|archive-date=2017-11-07|url-status=live|df=}}</ref>\n\n==By country==\n===United States===\n\nUnder [[United States law]], police officers have the right to detain individuals based on [[probable cause]] that a crime has been committed and the individual was involved, or based on [[reasonable suspicion]] that the individual has been, is, or is about to be engaged in a criminal activity.\n\n====Elements====\nTo prevail under a false imprisonment claim, a plaintiff must prove: (1) willful detention in a bounded area; (2) without consent; and (3) without authority of lawful arrest.(Restatement of the Law, Second, Torts)\n\n====Shopkeeper's privilege====\n{{main|Shopkeeper's privilege}}\n\nMany jurisdictions in the [[United States]] recognize the common law known as [[shopkeeper's privilege]] under which a person is allowed to detain a suspected shoplifter on store property for a reasonable period of time. The shopkeeper has cause to believe that the detainee in fact committed, or attempted to commit, theft of store property. The shopkeeper is allowed to ask the suspect to demonstrate that they have not been [[shoplifting]]. The purpose of the shopkeeper's privilege is to discover if the suspect is shoplifting and, if so, whether the shoplifted item can be reclaimed.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Business Law Today: The Essentials|last = LeRoy Miller|first = Roger|publisher = South-Western Cengage Learning|year = 2011|isbn = 1-133-19135-5|location = United States|pages = 102}}</ref> The shopkeeper's privilege, although recognized in most jurisdictions, is not as broad a privilege as that of a police officer's. Therefore, one must pay special attention to the temporal element: the shopkeeper may only detain the suspected criminal for a relatively short period of time. This is similar to a general right in many jurisdictions, and in limited circumstances, of [[citizen's arrest]] of suspected criminals by private citizens. In those jurisdictions without the privilege, detaining someone who has not committed a crime, even if done in good faith, is false imprisonment and can result in [[punitive damages]] for the unlawful detention.\n\n=====Rationale=====\nThis privilege has been justified by the very practical need for some degree of protection for shopkeepers in their dealings with suspected shoplifters. Absent such privilege, a shopkeeper would be faced with the dilemma of either allowing suspects to leave without challenge or acting upon their suspicion and risk making a [[false arrest]].\n\n=====Requirement=====\nIn order for a customer to be detained, the shopkeeper must:<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://definitions.uslegal.com/s/shopkeepers-privilege/|title = Shopkeepers Privilege Law & Legal Definition|date = |access-date = 12 September 2014|website = USLegal|publisher = |last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150109141707/http://definitions.uslegal.com/s/shopkeepers-privilege/|archive-date = 2015-01-09|url-status = live|df = }}</ref>\n# Conduct the investigation on the store premises, or immediately near the premises.\n# Have reasonable cause to believe the person detained was shoplifting.\n# Use reasonable (non-excessive) force to detain the suspected individual.\n# Not prolong the detention longer than a reasonable amount of time needed to gather all the facts.\n\nThe test of liability is not based on the store patron's guilt or innocence, but instead on the reasonableness of the store's action under the circumstances; the trier of fact usually determines whether reasonable belief is established. A guilty shoplifter can still sue for false imprisonment then if the detention was unreasonable.\n\n=====Purpose=====\nThe privilege for the most part is to be able to return the stolen goods. The shopkeeper may not force a confession. They do have a right to conduct a contemporaneous search of the person and the objects within that person's control.\n\n====Examples====\n=====Colorado=====\nIn ''Enright v. Groves'', a woman sued a police officer for false imprisonment after being arrested for not producing her [[driver's license]]. The plaintiff was in her car when she was approached by the officer for not leashing her dog; she was arrested after being asked to produce her driver's license and failing to do so.  She won her claim, despite having lost the case of not leashing her dog.  The court reasoned that the officer did not have proper legal authority in arresting her, because he arrested her for not producing her driver's license (which itself was not a crime) as opposed to the dog leash violation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Enright v.

While the patient was in jail, the police verified with her doctor that the prescription was authentic and that it was meant for her.  After this incident, the patient sued the pharmacy and its employees. She received $20,000 damages.

As a general rule, to be lawful an arrest must be supported by [[reasonable suspicion]]. An arrest may also occur if the police have a reasonable suspicion that an offence has occurred or will occur for which the arrested person is responsible. An arrest may also occur if the identity of the person arrested is in question, such that any investigation will be frustrated. Also,  arrest may be lawful if the police have reason to believe that the person arrested poses an imminent risk of harm to themselves or others.\n\nThe police may also detain a person under principles of prompt investigation, for such purposes as gaining evidence or taking statements. However, the taking of fingerprints is not deemed necessary for prompt investigation except when taking fingerprints from persons present at a crime scene.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a case was brought to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] concerning the alleged unlawful detention of hundreds of members of the public during the [[International Workers' Day#United Kingdom|May Day riots of 2001]] in London, England. The police, using the tactic of \"[[kettling]]\", held a large crowd in [[Oxford Circus]] for several hours without allowing anyone to leave.

A false imprisonment claim may be made based upon private acts, or upon wrongful governmental detention. For detention by the police, proof of false imprisonment provides a basis to obtain a writ of [[habeas corpus]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Overview: False Imprisonment |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095809472|website=Oxford Reference|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=6 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107043936/http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095809472|archive-date=2017-11-07|url-status=live|df=}}</ref>\n\nUnder [[common law]], false imprisonment is both a [[crime]] and a [[tort]].\n\n==Imprisonment==\n{{main|Imprisonment}}\nWithin the context of false imprisonment, an imprisonment occurs when a person is restrained from moving from a location or bounded area, as a result of a wrongful intentional act, such as the use of force, threat, coercion, or [[abuse of authority]].<ref name=\"wexfp\"/>\n\nThe following are examples of false imprisonment.\n* The taking hostage of a bank's customers and employees by bank robbers.\n* The detention of a customer by a business owner (e.g., hotel operator, apartment owner, credit card company) for the failure to pay a bill.\n* A robber in a home invasion ties hostages up and takes them to a separate room.\n\n==Detention that is not false imprisonment==\nEven when a person is involuntarily detained, not all acts of detention amount to false imprisonment. The law may privilege a person to detain somebody else against their will. A legally authorized detention does not constitute false imprisonment. For example, if a parent/guardian of a child denies the child's request to leave their house, and prevents them from doing so, this would not constitute false imprisonment unless the child feels they are in danger of death or great bodily harm. False imprisonment requires an intentional act, and an accidental detention will not support a claim of false imprisonment.<ref name=\"larson\">{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=False Imprisonment and Unlawful Detention|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal-injury-and-torts/false-imprisonment-and-unlawful-detention|website=ExpertLaw|access-date=6 November 2017|date=12 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107014150/https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal-injury-and-torts/false-imprisonment-and-unlawful-detention|archive-date=2017-11-07|url-status=live|df=}}</ref>\n\n==By country==\n===United States===\n\nUnder [[United States law]], police officers have the right to detain individuals based on [[probable cause]] that a crime has been committed and the individual was involved, or based on [[reasonable suspicion]] that the individual has been, is, or is about to be engaged in a criminal activity.\n\n====Elements====\nTo prevail under a false imprisonment claim, a plaintiff must prove: (1) willful detention in a bounded area; (2) without consent; and (3) without authority of lawful arrest.(Restatement of the Law, Second, Torts)\n\n====Shopkeeper's privilege====\n{{main|Shopkeeper's privilege}}\n\nMany jurisdictions in the [[United States]] recognize the common law known as [[shopkeeper's privilege]] under which a person is allowed to detain a suspected shoplifter on store property for a reasonable period of time. The shopkeeper has cause to believe that the detainee in fact committed, or attempted to commit, theft of store property. The shopkeeper is allowed to ask the suspect to demonstrate that they have not been [[shoplifting]]. The purpose of the shopkeeper's privilege is to discover if the suspect is shoplifting and, if so, whether the shoplifted item can be reclaimed.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Business Law Today: The Essentials|last = LeRoy Miller|first = Roger|publisher = South-Western Cengage Learning|year = 2011|isbn = 1-133-19135-5|location = United States|pages = 102}}</ref> The shopkeeper's privilege, although recognized in most jurisdictions, is not as broad a privilege as that of a police officer's. Therefore, one must pay special attention to the temporal element: the shopkeeper may only detain the suspected criminal for a relatively short period of time. This is similar to a general right in many jurisdictions, and in limited circumstances, of [[citizen's arrest]] of suspected criminals by private citizens. In those jurisdictions without the privilege, detaining someone who has not committed a crime, even if done in good faith, is false imprisonment and can result in [[punitive damages]] for the unlawful detention.\n\n=====Rationale=====\nThis privilege has been justified by the very practical need for some degree of protection for shopkeepers in their dealings with suspected shoplifters. Absent such privilege, a shopkeeper would be faced with the dilemma of either allowing suspects to leave without challenge or acting upon their suspicion and risk making a [[false arrest]].\n\n=====Requirement=====\nIn order for a customer to be detained, the shopkeeper must:<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://definitions.uslegal.com/s/shopkeepers-privilege/|title = Shopkeepers Privilege Law & Legal Definition|date = |access-date = 12 September 2014|website = USLegal|publisher = |last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150109141707/http://definitions.uslegal.com/s/shopkeepers-privilege/|archive-date = 2015-01-09|url-status = live|df = }}</ref>\n# Conduct the investigation on the store premises, or immediately near the premises.\n# Have reasonable cause to believe the person detained was shoplifting.\n# Use reasonable (non-excessive) force to detain the suspected individual.\n# Not prolong the detention longer than a reasonable amount of time needed to gather all the facts.\n\nThe test of liability is not based on the store patron's guilt or innocence, but instead on the reasonableness of the store's action under the circumstances; the trier of fact usually determines whether reasonable belief is established. A guilty shoplifter can still sue for false imprisonment then if the detention was unreasonable.\n\n=====Purpose=====\nThe privilege for the most part is to be able to return the stolen goods. The shopkeeper may not force a confession. They do have a right to conduct a contemporaneous search of the person and the objects within that person's control.\n\n====Examples====\n=====Colorado=====\nIn ''Enright v. Groves'', a woman sued a police officer for false imprisonment after being arrested for not producing her [[driver's license]]. The plaintiff was in her car when she was approached by the officer for not leashing her dog; she was arrested after being asked to produce her driver's license and failing to do so.  She won her claim, despite having lost the case of not leashing her dog.  The court reasoned that the officer did not have proper legal authority in arresting her, because he arrested her for not producing her driver's license (which itself was not a crime) as opposed to the dog leash violation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Enright v.

While the patient was in jail, the police verified with her doctor that the prescription was authentic and that it was meant for her.

As a general rule, to be lawful an arrest must be supported by [[reasonable suspicion]]. An arrest may also occur if the police have a reasonable suspicion that an offence has occurred or will occur for which the arrested person is responsible. An arrest may also occur if the identity of the person arrested is in question, such that any investigation will be frustrated. Also,  arrest may be lawful if the police have reason to believe that the person arrested poses an imminent risk of harm to themselves or others.\n\nThe police may also detain a person under principles of prompt investigation, for such purposes as gaining evidence or taking statements. However, the taking of fingerprints is not deemed necessary for prompt investigation except when taking fingerprints from persons present at a crime scene.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a case was brought to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] concerning the alleged unlawful detention of hundreds of members of the public during the [[International Workers' Day#United Kingdom|May Day riots of 2001]] in London, England.

There are 22 levels divided into seven parts in all.\n\nBefore ''Vectorman 2'' was released, [[Sega Channel]] held a contest that allowed artists to draw a morph of Vectorman.

Vectorman escapes, parachuting down to the planet to battle with the Earth's multitudinous enemy; [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[Insect|insects]]. Now it is up to Vectorman to fight through the mutant bugs and find the most fearsome source infestation; the evil [[Latrodectus|Black Widow]] [[Gyne|Queen]].\n\n====Graphics and gameplay====\nThe gameplay is similar to the previous game.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Vectorman 2: So Much Trash, So Little Time |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=88 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 1996 |pages=256\u20137}}</ref> Vectorman has a different set of weapons, including a pulse beam, energy shot, and super shot guns. Vectorman can also now transform into animal forms such as a fire ant, a rhino, and a \"shield bug\" that repels attacks. Unlike the original ''Vectorman'', the full-level transformations featured in this game are not used to combat bosses as that is left to the human-form Vectorman. There are 22 levels divided into seven parts in all.\n\nBefore ''Vectorman 2'' was released, [[Sega Channel]] held a contest that allowed artists to draw a morph of Vectorman. Judges then chose the best one to be transformed in Genesis art, as well as being put on the Sega Channel. Ten runner-up submitters won a copy of ''Vectorman 2''.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Sega Channel Memories pt2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bvC6RwA88Y|date=2007-06-10|accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref>\n\n====Reception====\n''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' gave ''Vectorman 2'' a 7.25 out of 10. Shawn Smith, Dan Hsu, and Crispin Boyer applauded its traditional side-scrolling gameplay, huge levels, graphics, and animation, especially on the bosses. Sushi-X, in contrast, said that the levels are surprisingly small, making it a disappointment compared to the first game.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Vectorman 2|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=88 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 1996 |page=90}}</ref> Scary Larry gave it a 4.5/5 in graphics and a 5/5 in every other category. He said that compared to the first game, it \"has cleaner graphics, more sound and voice effects, and faster, smoother gameplay.

One of the projects they created was a demo for a new 3D Vectorman game which would have featured the character on an alien planet with new transformations.

It took two years of shopping the song around Nashville before [[Bobby Bare]] recorded it on his album ''Bare'' at the urging of [[Shel Silverstein]]. Bare's version did not catch on and was never released as a single, so Schlitz recorded it himself, but this version failed to chart higher than No. 65. However, other musicians took notice and recorded the song in 1978, including [[Johnny Cash]], who put it on his album ''[[Gone Girl (album)|Gone Girl]]''. However, it was [[Kenny Rogers]] who made the song a mainstream success. His version was a No. 1 country hit and made its way to the Pop charts at a time when country songs rarely crossed over. It was released in November 1978 as the title track from his album ''[[The Gambler (album)|The Gambler]]'' which won him the [[Grammy]] award for best male country vocal performance in 1980.<ref>{{citation |title=Reader's digest almanac and yearbook |page=274 |year=1981}}</ref> In 2006 Don Schlitz appeared in the Kenny Rogers career retrospective documentary \"The Journey\", where he praised both Rogers' and producer Larry Butler's contributions to the song, stating \"they added several ideas that were not mine, including the new guitar intro\".\n\nIt was one of five consecutive songs by Rogers to hit No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' country music charts.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944-2006, Second edition|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=298}}</ref> On the [[Billboard Hot 100|pop chart]], the song made it No. 16 and No. 3 on the [[Adult Contemporary|Easy Listening]] chart.<ref>{{cite book |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961-2001|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2002 |publisher=Record Research |page=207}}</ref> It has become one of Rogers's most enduring hits and a signature song.

The gambler tells the narrator that he can tell he is down on his luck (\"out of aces\") by the look in his eyes and offers him advice in exchange for his last swallow of [[whisky]]. After the gambler takes the drink (and a [[cigarette]]), he gives the following advice:\n\n{{cquote|You've got to know when to [[Call (poker)|hold 'em]], know when to [[Fold (poker)|fold 'em]],<br>\nKnow when to walk away, know when to run.<br>\nYou never count your money when you're sittin' at the table,<br>\nThere'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.}}\n\nThe gambler then mentions that the \"secret to survivin' is knowing what to throw away, and knowing what to keep\" and that \"the best you can hope for is to die in your sleep\". At this point, the gambler puts out the cigarette and goes to sleep.\n\nAt the end of the song we are told that \"somewhere in the darkness, the gambler, he broke even\", and that the narrator finds \"an ace that I could keep\", in his final words. Rogers' rendition in an appearance on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' indicates the gambler actually dies in his sleep when he \"broke even\", thus really making those his \"final words\" ever spoken.\n\n==Chart performance==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1978\u201379)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Australia [[Kent Music Report|KMR]]<ref name=\"austchartbook1970\">{{cite web|url=http://www.austchartbook.com.au/ |title=Australian Chart Book |website=Austchartbook.com.au |date= |accessdate=2016-10-13}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|25\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Canada Adult Contemporary Tracks (''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'')\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Canada Country Tracks (''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'')\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Canada Top Singles (''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'')\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n{{Singlechart|New Zealand|29|artist=Kenny Rogers|song=The Gambler}}\n|- \n|Spain ([[Productores de M\u00fasica de Espa\u00f1a|AFYVE]])<ref>{{cite book |last=Salaverri|first=Fernando|title=S\u00f3lo \u00e9xitos: a\u00f1o a a\u00f1o, 1959\u20132002|edition=1st |date=September 2005|publisher=Fundaci\u00f3n Autor-SGAE|location=Spain|isbn=84-8048-639-2}}</ref> \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|UK Singles ([[The Official Charts Company]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/kenny%20rogers/ |title=KENNY ROGERS &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company |website=Theofficialcharts.com |accessdate=2016-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224154054/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/kenny%20rogers/ |archive-date=2011-12-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|22\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardcountrysongs|1|artist=Kenny Rogers}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|16|artist=Kenny Rogers}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardadultcontemporary|3|artist=Kenny Rogers}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|US ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' Top 100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19790310.html |title=Cash Box Top 100 3/10/79 |website=Tropicalglen.com |date=1979-03-10 |accessdate=2016-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318182852/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19790310.html |archive-date=2016-03-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|13\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1979)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Canada Top Singles (''RPM'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.6855a&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.6855a.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.6855a |title=Image : RPM Weekly - Library and Archives Canada |website=Bac-lac.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-10-13}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|65\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1979.htm |title=Top 100 Hits of 1979/Top 100 Songs of 1979 |website=Musicoutfitters.com |accessdate=2016-10-13}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|40\n|-\n|US ''Cash Box''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/1979YESP.html |title=Cash Box YE Pop Singles - 1979 |website=Tropicalglen.com |date=1979-12-29 |accessdate=2016-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713094315/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/1979YESP.html |archive-date=2014-07-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|94\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Certifications ==\n{{Certification Table Top}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=New Zealand|artist=Kenny Rogers|title=The Gambler|award=Platinum|number=2|type=single|relyear=1978|relmonth=11|recent=website|id=4838|accessdate=March 28, 2020}}\n{{Certification Table Bottom}}\n\n== Cover versions ==\n*[[Alvin and the Chipmunks]] on their album [[Urban Chipmunk]] (1981)\n* [[Johnny Cash]] on ''[[Gone Girl (album)|Gone Girl]]'' (1978)\n* [[Blake Shelton]] on ''Cracker Barrel: Songs of the Year Concert'' (2007)\n* [[Brian Posehn]] with [[Jamey Jasta]] on ''[[Fart and Wiener Jokes]]'' (2010)\n* [[Outlaw (Terry Pugh)]] on ''Old Friends'' (2012)        \n* [[Joey Sontz]] on Chasing The Dream (2012)\n* [[The R Team]] on ''The Gambler'' (Single) (2017)\n* [[Slightly Stoopid]] on ''The Gambler'' (Single) (2020)\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{trivia|date=March 2020}}\n* In 1979, when Rogers guest-starred in a season 4 episode of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', he performed this song with a [[Muppet]] character. Rogers is shown seated on a train with three muppets, one of them The Gambler (portrayed by [[Jerry Nelson]]). Rogers sings the opening verse, while Nelson sings most of \"The Gambler's\" dialog, then falls asleep just as Rogers concludes the song's story. After he dies, The Gambler's spirit rises from his Muppet body, singing backup and dances to the song's last two choruses, and lets a deck of cards fly from his hand before fading away.\n* The [[USFL]] team [[Houston Gamblers]] was named after this song. Kenny Rogers was born and raised in Houston, Texas.\n* A caricature parody of Kenny Rogers singing the song appeared in the 1993 [[List of Animaniacs episodes|Pinky and the Brain]] short \"Bubba Bo Bob Brain\" (season 1, episode 34). The lyrics to this version were changed to refer to [[Go Fish]]: \"You gotta know how to cut 'em, know how to shuffle, know how to deal the cards before you play fish with me.\"\n* [[Country Yossi]] parodied the song in the 1980s on his \u2018\u2019\u2019Wanted\u2019\u2019\u2019 album as \u2018\u2019The Rabbi.\u2019\u2019[https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/coffeeroom/topic/does-anyone-know-the-lyrics-for]\n* The song was used in the movie, [[George of the Jungle 2]], while playing a card game.\n*In a 1996 episode of the sitcom ''[[NewsRadio]]'', Matthew ([[Andy Dick]]) comically misquotes the chorus of the song. (season 2 episode 13, \"In Through The Out Door\")\n* On an episode of [[Monday Night Raw]] on November 12, 2001 at the [[TD Garden|FleetCenter]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], wrestler [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] sang the chorus to the then heel character of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] in a sing off after Austin sang \"[[Delta Dawn]]\" off key to jeers, The Rock sang the chorus of \"The Gambler\" to cheers.\n* The song became a dressing room anthem for the England players in the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], which led to it becoming a pop [[UK top 40]] hit.\n* On May 10, 2007, the cast of ''[[The_Office_(American_TV_series)|The Office]]'' sings the chorus of the song on the bus in the episode, \"Beach Games.\" \n* On July 21, 2009, the song was released for the music game ''[[Rock Band]]'' as a playable track as part of the \"[[Rock Band Country Track Pack]]\" compilation disc. It was then made available via digital download on Dec 29, 2009.\n* A 2014 [[Geico]] television commercial features Rogers singing part of the song a cappella during a card game, to the displeasure of the other players.\n* The song was ranked number 18 out of the top 76 songs of the 1970s by [[Internet radio]] station WDDF Radio in their 2016 countdown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wddfradio.com/ |title=Best of the 70's & 80's |publisher=WDDF Radio |date= |accessdate=2016-10-13}}</ref>\n* The song plays during a montage scene in an episode of [[Supernatural (U.S. TV series) | Supernatural]] titled \"Weekend at Bobby's\" and in another episode titled \"Inside Man\".\n*The song was played during a 2019 MLB World Series commercial showing Houston Astros players playing poker.\n*The song appears briefly in the 2019 Clint Eastwood film [[Richard Jewell (film)|Richard Jewell]].<ref> {{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3513548/soundtrack?ref_=tt_ql_trv_7 | title=IMDB Page | accessdate=March 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Kenny Rogers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gambler (song), The}}\n[[Category:1978 singles]]\n[[Category:1978 songs]]\n[[Category:Billboard Hot Country Songs number-one singles]]\n[[Category:Bobby Bare songs]]\n[[Category:Johnny Cash songs]]\n[[Category:Kenny Rogers songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Don Schlitz]]\n[[Category:Song recordings produced by Larry Butler (producer)]]\n[[Category:United Artists Records singles]]\n[[Category:United States National Recording Registry recordings]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1978 single by Kenny Rogers}}\n{{Other uses|The Gambler (disambiguation){{!}}The Gambler}}\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = The Gambler\n| cover      = The_Gambler_-_Kenny_Rogers.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Kenny Rogers]]\n| album      = [[The Gambler (album)|The Gambler]]\n| B-side     = Momma's Waiting\n| released   = November 15, 1978\n| format     = [[Vinyl record|Vinyl]]\n| recorded   =\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[Country music|Country]]\n| length     = 3:34\n| label      = [[United Artists Records|United Artists]]\n| writer     = [[Don Schlitz]]\n| producer   = [[Larry Butler (producer)|Larry Butler]]\n| prev_title = [[Anyone Who Isn't Me Tonight]]\n| prev_year  = 1978\n| next_title = [[All I Ever Need Is You (song)|All I Ever Need Is You]]\n| next_year  = 1979\n}}\n\"'''The Gambler'''\" is a song written by [[Don Schlitz]] and recorded by several artists, most famously by American [[country music]] singer [[Kenny Rogers]].\n\nDon Schlitz wrote this song in August 1976 when he was 23 years old.

The gambler tells the narrator that he can tell he is down on his luck (\"out of aces\") by the look in his eyes and offers him advice in exchange for his last swallow of [[whisky]]. After the gambler takes the drink (and a [[cigarette]]), he gives the following advice:\n\n{{cquote|You've got to know when to [[Call (poker)|hold 'em]], know when to [[Fold (poker)|fold 'em]],<br>\nKnow when to walk away, know when to run.<br>\nYou never count your money when you're sittin' at the table,<br>\nThere'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.}}\n\nThe gambler then mentions that the \"secret to survivin' is knowing what to throw away, and knowing what to keep\" and that \"the best you can hope for is to die in your sleep\". At this point, the gambler puts out the cigarette and goes to sleep.\n\nAt the end of the song we are told that \"somewhere in the darkness, the gambler, he broke even\", and that the narrator finds \"an ace that I could keep\", in his final words. Rogers' rendition in an appearance on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' indicates the gambler actually dies in his sleep when he \"broke even\", thus really making those his \"final words\" ever spoken.\n\n==Chart performance==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1978\u201379)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Australia [[Kent Music Report|KMR]]<ref name=\"austchartbook1970\">{{cite web|url=http://www.austchartbook.com.au/ |title=Australian Chart Book |website=Austchartbook.com.au |date= |accessdate=2016-10-13}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|25\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Canada Adult Contemporary Tracks (''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'')\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Canada Country Tracks (''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'')\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Canada Top Singles (''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'')\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n{{Singlechart|New Zealand|29|artist=Kenny Rogers|song=The Gambler}}\n|- \n|Spain ([[Productores de M\u00fasica de Espa\u00f1a|AFYVE]])<ref>{{cite book |last=Salaverri|first=Fernando|title=S\u00f3lo \u00e9xitos: a\u00f1o a a\u00f1o, 1959\u20132002|edition=1st |date=September 2005|publisher=Fundaci\u00f3n Autor-SGAE|location=Spain|isbn=84-8048-639-2}}</ref> \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|UK Singles ([[The Official Charts Company]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/kenny%20rogers/ |title=KENNY ROGERS &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company |website=Theofficialcharts.com |accessdate=2016-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224154054/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/kenny%20rogers/ |archive-date=2011-12-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|22\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardcountrysongs|1|artist=Kenny Rogers}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|16|artist=Kenny Rogers}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardadultcontemporary|3|artist=Kenny Rogers}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|US ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' Top 100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19790310.html |title=Cash Box Top 100 3/10/79 |website=Tropicalglen.com |date=1979-03-10 |accessdate=2016-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318182852/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19790310.html |archive-date=2016-03-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|13\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1979)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Canada Top Singles (''RPM'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.6855a&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.6855a.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.6855a |title=Image : RPM Weekly - Library and Archives Canada |website=Bac-lac.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-10-13}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|65\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1979.htm |title=Top 100 Hits of 1979/Top 100 Songs of 1979 |website=Musicoutfitters.com |accessdate=2016-10-13}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|40\n|-\n|US ''Cash Box''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/1979YESP.html |title=Cash Box YE Pop Singles - 1979 |website=Tropicalglen.com |date=1979-12-29 |accessdate=2016-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713094315/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/1979YESP.html |archive-date=2014-07-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|94\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Certifications ==\n{{Certification Table Top}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=New Zealand|artist=Kenny Rogers|title=The Gambler|award=Platinum|number=2|type=single|relyear=1978|relmonth=11|recent=website|id=4838|accessdate=March 28, 2020}}\n{{Certification Table Bottom}}\n\n== Cover versions ==\n*[[Alvin and the Chipmunks]] on their album [[Urban Chipmunk]] (1981)\n* [[Johnny Cash]] on ''[[Gone Girl (album)|Gone Girl]]'' (1978)\n* [[Blake Shelton]] on ''Cracker Barrel: Songs of the Year Concert'' (2007)\n* [[Brian Posehn]] with [[Jamey Jasta]] on ''[[Fart and Wiener Jokes]]'' (2010)\n* [[Outlaw (Terry Pugh)]] on ''Old Friends'' (2012)        \n* [[Joey Sontz]] on Chasing The Dream (2012)\n* [[The R Team]] on ''The Gambler'' (Single) (2017)\n* [[Slightly Stoopid]] on ''The Gambler'' (Single) (2020)\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{trivia|date=March 2020}}\n* In 1979, when Rogers guest-starred in a season 4 episode of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', he performed this song with a [[Muppet]] character. Rogers is shown seated on a train with three muppets, one of them The Gambler (portrayed by [[Jerry Nelson]]). Rogers sings the opening verse, while Nelson sings most of \"The Gambler's\" dialog, then falls asleep just as Rogers concludes the song's story. After he dies, The Gambler's spirit rises from his Muppet body, singing backup and dances to the song's last two choruses, and lets a deck of cards fly from his hand before fading away.\n* The [[USFL]] team [[Houston Gamblers]] was named after this song. Kenny Rogers was born and raised in Houston, Texas.\n* A caricature parody of Kenny Rogers singing the song appeared in the 1993 [[List of Animaniacs episodes|Pinky and the Brain]] short \"Bubba Bo Bob Brain\" (season 1, episode 34). The lyrics to this version were changed to refer to [[Go Fish]]: \"You gotta know how to cut 'em, know how to shuffle, know how to deal the cards before you play fish with me.\"\n* [[Country Yossi]] parodied the song in the 1980s on his \u2018\u2019\u2019Wanted\u2019\u2019\u2019 album as \u2018\u2019The Rabbi.\u2019\u2019[https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/coffeeroom/topic/does-anyone-know-the-lyrics-for]\n* The song was used in the movie, [[George of the Jungle 2]], while playing a card game.\n*In a 1996 episode of the sitcom ''[[NewsRadio]]'', Matthew ([[Andy Dick]]) comically misquotes the chorus of the song. (season 2 episode 13, \"In Through The Out Door\")\n* On an episode of [[Monday Night Raw]] on November 12, 2001 at the [[TD Garden|FleetCenter]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], wrestler [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] sang the chorus to the then heel character of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] in a sing off after Austin sang \"[[Delta Dawn]]\" off key to jeers, The Rock sang the chorus of \"The Gambler\" to cheers.\n* The song became a dressing room anthem for the England players in the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], which led to it becoming a pop [[UK top 40]] hit.\n* On May 10, 2007, the cast of ''[[The_Office_(American_TV_series)|The Office]]'' sings the chorus of the song on the bus in the episode, \"Beach Games.\" \n* On July 21, 2009, the song was released for the music game ''[[Rock Band]]'' as a playable track as part of the \"[[Rock Band Country Track Pack]]\" compilation disc. It was then made available via digital download on Dec 29, 2009.\n* A 2014 [[Geico]] television commercial features Rogers singing part of the song a cappella during a card game, to the displeasure of the other players.\n* The song was ranked number 18 out of the top 76 songs of the 1970s by [[Internet radio]] station WDDF Radio in their 2016 countdown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wddfradio.com/ |title=Best of the 70's & 80's |publisher=WDDF Radio |date= |accessdate=2016-10-13}}</ref>\n* The song plays during a montage scene in an episode of [[Supernatural (U.S. TV series) | Supernatural]] titled \"Weekend at Bobby's\" and in another episode titled \"Inside Man\".\n*The song was played during a 2019 MLB World Series commercial showing Houston Astros players playing poker.\n*The song appears briefly in the 2019 Clint Eastwood film [[Richard Jewell (film)|Richard Jewell]].<ref> {{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3513548/soundtrack?ref_=tt_ql_trv_7 | title=IMDB Page | accessdate=March 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Kenny Rogers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gambler (song), The}}\n[[Category:1978 singles]]\n[[Category:1978 songs]]\n[[Category:Billboard Hot Country Songs number-one singles]]\n[[Category:Bobby Bare songs]]\n[[Category:Johnny Cash songs]]\n[[Category:Kenny Rogers songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Don Schlitz]]\n[[Category:Song recordings produced by Larry Butler (producer)]]\n[[Category:United Artists Records singles]]\n[[Category:United States National Recording Registry recordings]]\n", "name_user": "Bmcgowan89", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed a typo from \"Clcountry\" to \"country\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gambler_(song)"}

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\n[[File:SoG 1.jpg|thumb|upright=2|City defences during the siege in 1643]]\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\n===First ten days===\n\n[[File:SoG 2.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Royalist dispositions during the siege]]\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref>\n\n===Shift of focus to mining===\n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it become necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\n===Approach of the relief army===\n\nBy the end of 3 September Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Meanwhile Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester and, having rendezvoused with Wilmot, ended the day with some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref> The next day the two forces clashed. Although Rupert enjoyed superior numbers, he was dissuaded from pressing his advantage by the appearance of [[Edmund Harvey]] with a regiment of Parliamentarian cavalry and two of infantry. When Essex arrived with the rest of the Parliamentarian army, Rupert was forced into a steady retreat to the area of [[Andoversford]] and [[Compton Abdale]], while Essex's army ended the day around [[Naunton]]. Rupert had been surprised by the size of Essex's force and the skill with which it was handled, and had completely failed in his mission to delay it.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 144\u2013147, 148</ref>\n\nIn Gloucester the Parliamentarians could see the evacuation of some 400 sick or wounded Royalists and the dispatch of some artillery away from the siege, but also the arrival of 2,000 infantry and 500 mounted reinforcements from Bristol. The defender's countermine reached outside the east gate, where they discovered and began boring down on the deeper Royalist mine, while inside the gate an earthwork was completed across the road and the buildings either side were turned into [[blockhouse]]s. They were critically low on gunpowder, but buoyed by the sight of fires lit on nearby Wainlode Hill signalling the approach of Essex. The Royalists, meanwhile, were readying the heavy guns to move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 147\u2013148</ref>\n\nOn 5 September Essex took the quickest way off the open country of the Cotswold hills down into the relative safety of the Severn valley. This meant descending the steep escarpment at Prestbury Hill towards [[Cheltenham]], rather heading directly to Gloucester. His lead elements began the difficult descent at dusk, but the baggage train and rearguard were forced to spend the night in worsening weather in the hills. Rupert, who appears to have expected a more direct march on Gloucester, could do little to harass the Parliamentarians, and returned to Gloucester. There he covered the Royalist army as it lifted the siege and withdrew to Matson, {{convert|2|mi|km}} south-east of the city. Charles had already departed his headquarters there and ridden ahead to [[Painswick]]. The defenders inside the city did not know how close Essex was and, not quite believing the siege was over, did not harry the retreating Royalists but remained vigilant behind their defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 148\u2013151</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Royalists marched towards London. They clashed Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]].

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\n[[File:SoG 1.jpg|thumb|upright=2|City defences during the siege in 1643]]\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\n===First ten days===\n\n[[File:SoG 2.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Royalist dispositions during the siege]]\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref>\n\n===Shift of focus to mining===\n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it become necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\n===Approach of the relief army===\n\nBy the end of 3 September Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Meanwhile Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester and, having rendezvoused with Wilmot, ended the day with some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref> The next day the two forces clashed. Dissuaded by the appearance of [[Edmund Harvey]] with a regiment of cavalry and two of infantry, Rupert failed to take advantage of his initial superiority in numbers to overwhelm the London brigade. When Essex arrived with the rest of the Parliamentarian army, Rupert was forced into a steady retreat to the area of [[Andoversford]] and [[Compton Abdale]], while Essex's army spent the night around [[Naunton]]. Rupert had been surprised by the size of Essex's force and the skill with which it was handled, and had completely failed in his mission to delay it.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 144\u2013147, 148</ref>\n\nIn Gloucester the Parliamentarians could see the evacuation of some 400 sick or wounded Royalists and the dispatch of some artillery away from the siege, but also the arrival of 2,000 infantry and 500 mounted reinforcements from Bristol. The defender's countermine reached outside the east gate, where they discovered and began boring down on the deeper Royalist mine, while inside the gate an earthwork was completed across the road and the buildings either side were turned into [[blockhouse]]s. They were critically low on gunpowder, but buoyed by the sight of fires lit on nearby Wainlode Hill signalling the approach of Essex. The Royalists, meanwhile, were readying the heavy guns to move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 147\u2013148</ref>\n\nOn 5 September Essex took the quickest way off the open country of the Cotswold hills down into the relative safety of the Severn valley. This meant descending the steep escarpment at Prestbury Hill towards [[Cheltenham]], rather heading directly to Gloucester. His lead elements began the difficult descent at dusk, but the baggage train and rearguard were forced to spend the night in worsening weather in the hills. Rupert, who appears to have expected a more direct march on Gloucester, could do little to harass the Parliamentarians, and returned to Gloucester. There he covered the Royalist army as it lifted the siege and withdrew to Matson, {{convert|2|mi|km}} south-east of the city. Charles had already departed his headquarters there and ridden ahead to [[Painswick]]. The defenders inside the city did not know how close Essex was and, not quite believing the siege was over, did not harry the retreating Royalists but remained vigilant behind their defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 148\u2013151</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Royalists marched towards London. They clashed Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.
