He initially fought as a [[Middleweight (MMA)|middleweight]], where he made his debut at ''[[UFC Fight Night 6]]'' as a late replacement for [[Kalib Starnes]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=news.detail&gid=3011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219000829/http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=news.detail&gid=3011 |archivedate=2007-12-19 }}</ref> In his debut fight with the UFC, Kampmann defeated [[Crafton Wallace]] by first-round submission.

At ''[[UFC 68]]'', after being rocked and knocked down numerous times, Kampmann showed his toughness and resilience by defeating [[Drew McFedries]] via arm-triangle choke late in the first round.\n\nHis next UFC fight was scheduled for ''[[UFC 72]]'' against former [[UFC Middleweight Championship|UFC Middleweight Champion]] [[Rich Franklin]], but he was forced to withdraw due to a knee injury. Kampmann returned from his injury at ''[[UFC 85]]'', where he defeated the heavy-handed [[Jorge Rivera (fighter)|Jorge Rivera]] by guillotine choke at 2:44 in the first round.\n\nAfter a first-round TKO defeat to [[Nate Marquardt]] at ''[[UFC 88]]'', Kampmann announced that he would drop down to the [[Welterweight (MMA)|Welterweight]] division.

He was the fourth son of ''Ras'' [[Kassa Haile Darge]], and his wife Princess (''Le'ilt'') Tsige Mariam Beshah. Prince Aserate Kassa was married to (''Le'ilt'') Zuriashwork Gebre-Igziabiher, daughter of ''Jantirar'' Gebre-Igziabiher, and granddaughter of Empress [[Menen Asfaw]], consort of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] I. Prince Aserate Kassa was the head of the Selalle sub-branch of the Shewan branch of Ethiopia's Imperial [[Solomonic dynasty]].\n\n== Life ==\n\nOver the years [[Haile Selassie I]] ruled Ethiopia, Aserate held several positions including Governor of [[Arsi Province|Arsi]], and of [[Shewa]]. In 1964, he was appointed [[Viceroy]] of [[Eritrea]]. His chief rival was Prime Minister [[Aklilu Habte-Wold]].  The rivalry between the two prominent figures was caused by the suspicions between the conservative court faction made up largely but not exclusively of the nobility and church hierarchy, and led by Prince Aserate, and the faction of reformers led by the commoner technocrats led by the Prime Minister and officials largely of humble birth that owed their education and appointment to positions of power to the Emperor.  \n\nIn 1966, Aserate Kassa was raised from ''[[Dejazmach]]'' to ''Ras''.<ref>Paul B.

One part of his response was to create two armed groups under his direct control and funding: a commando force made primarily of Christian Eritreans and trained by the [[Ethiopia-Israel relations|Israelis]], and an Eritrean security force. The other part was to engage in discrete negotiations in hope of reconciling most of the populace based on appeals to shared highland Christian heritage. However, growing violence by the rebels enabled Aklilu Habte-Wold to undercut his authority and encourage the [[Ethiopian National Defense Force|army]] to take harsher measures. By 1968 the rebels were fighting pitched battles against Ethiopian military forces. Israeli advisors failed to effectively control the tendency of Ethiopian commanders to use brutal tactics, which drove civilians to seek protection from the rebels. Only with difficulty did ''Ras'' Asrate dissuade Emperor Haile Selassie from listening to Aklilu and his generals and declare [[martial law]] in Eritrea in early 1970. Nevertheless, the Emperor authorized major military campaigns, which not only failed to defeat the insurgents but caused the death of the commanding general. Aklilu's faction was able to convince the Emperor to recall ''Ras'' Aserate, declare martial law in Eritrea, and appoint General [[Debebe Haile Mariam]] military governor.<ref>Henze, ''Layers of Time'', pp. 277\u20139.</ref>\n\nDespite this loss of prestige, Haile Selassie selected ''Ras'' Aserate in July 1971 as President of the [[Crown Council of Ethiopia|Crown Council]], to rejuvenate that body and oversee an orderly transfer of power on Haile Selassie's death to his designated successor, Crown Prince [[Amha Selassie of Ethiopia|Asfaw Wossen]].<ref>Henze, ''Layers of Time'', p. 282.</ref> When the Emperor was deposed and the [[Derg]] took power, Aserate Kassa was imprisoned and later executed along with [[The Sixty|60 other imperial officials]] on 23 November 1974.

Various cultures define the number and nature of seasons based on regional variations.\n\nDuring May, June, and July, the [[Northern Hemisphere]] is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the [[Southern Hemisphere]] in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer [[month]]s, which increases the [[solar flux]]. However, due to [[seasonal lag]], June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nSeasons often held special significance for agrarian societies, whose lives revolved around [[planting]] and [[harvest]] times, and the change of seasons was often attended by [[ritual]]. In [[temperate]] and [[Subpolar climate|sub-polar]] regions, four seasons based on the [[Gregorian calendar]] are generally recognized: ''[[Spring (season)|spring]]'', ''[[summer]]'', ''[[autumn]]'' or ''fall'', and ''[[winter]]''. The definition of seasons is also cultural. In India from the ancient times, six seasons or [[Ritu (Indian season)|Ritu]] based on south Asian religious or cultural calendars are recognised and identified even today for the purposes such as agriculture and trade. Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate [[climate]] regions which are not tied to any fixed calendar dates: ''prevernal'', ''vernal'', ''estival'', ''serotinal'', ''autumnal'', and ''hibernal''. Many tropical regions have two seasons: the ''[[wet season|rainy]]'', ''[[wet season|wet]]'', or ''[[monsoon]] season'' and the ''[[dry season]]''. Some have a third ''cool'', ''mild'', or ''[[harmattan]] season''. \n\nIn some parts of the world, some other \"seasons\" capture the timing of important ecological events such as ''[[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]]'', ''[[tornado season]]'', and ''[[wildfire]] season''.{{citation needed|reason=This content does not appear anywhere in the article body.|date=June 2016}} The most historically important of these are the three seasons\u2014''[[Akhet (season)|flood]]'', ''[[Season of the Emergence|growth]]'', and ''[[Shemu|low water]]''\u2014which were previously defined by the [[flooding of the Nile|former annual flooding]] of the [[Nile]] in [[Egypt]].[[File:MatheranPanoramaPointDrySeason.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Tropical dry season in [[Maharashtra]], India]]\n[[File:MatheranPanoramaPointMonsoon.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Tropical wet season/monsoon in [[Maharashtra]], India]]\n\n==Causes and effects==\n{{main|Effect of sun angle on climate}} \n\n===Axial tilt===\n[[File:Seasonearth.png|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Illumination of Earth at each change of astronomical season]]\n\n[[File:seasons.svg|frame|right|'''Fig. 1'''<br />This diagram shows how the tilt of [[Earth's axis]] aligns with incoming [[sunlight]] around the [[winter solstice]] of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Regardless of the time of day (i.e. the [[Earth's rotation]] on its axis), the [[North Pole]] will be dark and the [[South Pole]] will be illuminated; see also [[arctic winter]]. In addition to the density of [[angle of incidence (optics)|incident]] light, the [[dissipation]] of light in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is greater when it falls at a shallow angle.]]\n\nThe seasons result from the Earth's [[axis of rotation]] being [[axial tilt#Earth|tilted]] with respect to its [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] by an angle of approximately 23.4 [[degree (angle)|degrees]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cain|first=Fraiser|title=Tilt of the Earth|url=http://www.universetoday.com/26778/tilt-of-the-earth/|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> (This tilt is also known as \"obliquity of the [[ecliptic]]\".)\n\nRegardless of the time of year, the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere]]s always experience opposite seasons. This is because during [[summer]] or [[winter]], one part of the planet is more directly exposed to the rays of the Sun (see ''Fig. 1'') than the other, and this exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. For approximately half of the year (from around March 20 to around September 22), the Northern Hemisphere tips toward the Sun, with the maximum amount occurring on about June 21. For the other half of the year, the same happens, but in the Southern Hemisphere instead of the Northern, with the maximum around December 21. The two instants when the Sun is directly overhead at the [[Equator]] are the [[equinox]]es. Also at that moment, both the [[North Pole]] and the [[South Pole]] of the Earth are just on the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]], and hence day and night are equally divided between the two hemispheres. Around the [[March equinox]], the Northern Hemisphere will be experiencing [[Spring (season)|spring]] as the hours of [[daylight]] increase, and the Southern Hemisphere is experiencing [[autumn]] as daylight hours shorten.\n\nThe effect of axial tilt is observable as the change in [[day length]] and [[altitude (astronomy)|altitude]] of the Sun at solar [[noon]] (the Sun's [[culmination]]) during the [[year]]. The low angle of Sun during the winter months means that incoming rays of solar radiation are [[effect of sun angle on climate|spread over a larger area]] of the Earth's surface, so the light received is more indirect and of lower intensity. Between this effect and the shorter daylight hours, the axial tilt of the Earth accounts for most of the seasonal variation in climate in both hemispheres.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Earth-lighting-summer-solstice EN - corrected.png|Illumination of Earth by Sun at the northern solstice.\nFile:Earth-lighting-winter-solstice EN.png|Illumination of Earth by Sun at the southern solstice.\nFile:North season.jpg|Diagram of the Earth's seasons as seen from the north.

Throughout the year, different parts of Earth receive the Sun's most direct rays. So, when the North Pole tilts toward the Sun, it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere. And when the South Pole tilts toward the Sun, it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n</gallery>\n\n===Elliptical Earth orbit===\nCompared to axial tilt, other factors contribute little to seasonal temperature changes. The seasons are not the result of the variation in Earth's distance to the Sun because of its [[elliptical orbit]].<ref>\"Fundamentals of physical geography\", ''PhysicalGeography.net'', Ch. 6: Energy and Matter:(h) Earth-Sun Geometry, [http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/6h.html]</ref> In fact, Earth reaches [[perihelion]] (the point in its orbit closest to the Sun) in January, and it reaches [[aphelion]] (the point farthest from the Sun) in July, so the slight contribution of [[orbital eccentricity]] opposes the temperature trends of the seasons in the Northern Hemisphere.<ref name=\"Science@NASA\">Phillips, Tony, \"[https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2002/02jul_aphelion.htm The Distant Sun (Strange but True: the Sun is far away on the 4th of July)],\" [https://science.nasa.gov/default.htm Science@NASA], downloaded 24 June 2006</ref> In general, the effect of orbital eccentricity on Earth's seasons is a 7% variation in sunlight received.\n\nOrbital eccentricity can influence temperatures, but on Earth, this effect is small and is more than counteracted by other factors; research shows that the Earth as a whole is actually slightly warmer when ''farther'' from the sun. This is because the Northern Hemisphere has more land than the Southern, and land warms more readily than sea.<ref name=\"Science@NASA\"/>\nAny noticeable intensification of southern winters and summers due to Earth's elliptical orbit is mitigated by the abundance of water in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Tony|title=Earth at Perihelion|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast04jan_1/|work=Science News|publisher=NASA|accessdate=14 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Maritime and hemispheric===\nSeasonal weather fluctuations (changes) also depend on factors such as proximity to [[ocean]]s or other large bodies of water, [[ocean current|currents]] in those oceans, [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation|El Ni\u00f1o]]/ENSO and other oceanic cycles, and prevailing [[wind]]s.\n\nIn the [[temperate]] and [[polar regions of Earth|polar regions]], seasons are marked by changes in the amount of [[sunlight]], which in turn often causes [[biological life cycle|cycles]] of dormancy in plants and [[hibernation]] in animals. These effects vary with [[latitude]] and with proximity to bodies of water. For example, the [[South Pole]] is in the middle of the continent of [[Antarctica]] and therefore a considerable distance from the moderating influence of the southern oceans. The [[North Pole]] is in the [[Arctic Ocean]], and thus its temperature extremes are buffered by the water. The result is that the South Pole is consistently colder during the southern winter than the North Pole during the northern winter.\n\nThe seasonal cycle in the polar and temperate zones of one hemisphere is opposite to that of the other. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern, and vice versa.\n\n===Tropics===\n[[Image:BlueMarble monthlies animation.gif|thumb|right|Animation of seasonal differences especially [[snow]] cover through the year]]\nThe [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions see little annual fluctuation of sunlight.  However, seasonal shifts occur along a rainy, low-pressure belt called the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ICZ). As a result, the amount of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] tends to vary more dramatically than the average temperature. When the Zone is north of the Equator, the northern tropics experience their wet season while the southern tropics have their dry season. This pattern reverses when the Zone migrates to a position south of the Equator.\n\n===Mid-latitude thermal lag===\n\nIn meteorological terms, the [[solstice]]s (the maximum and minimum [[insolation]]) do not fall in the middles of summer and winter. The heights of these seasons occur up to 7 weeks later because of [[seasonal lag]]. Seasons, though, are not always defined in meteorological terms.\n\nIn [[astronomy|astronomical]] reckoning by hours of [[daylight]] alone, the solstices and [[equinox]]es are in the ''middle'' of the respective seasons. Because of seasonal lag due to [[thermal absorption]] and release by the oceans, regions with a [[continental climate]], which predominate in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], often consider these four dates to be the ''start'' of the seasons as in the diagram, with the [[cross-quarter day]]s considered seasonal midpoints. The length of these seasons is not uniform because of Earth's [[elliptical orbit]] and its [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|different speeds along that orbit]].<ref>\"[http://www.astro.uu.nl/~strous/AA/en/antwoorden/seizoenen.html#v466 Astronomy Answers AstronomyAnswerBook: Seasons],\" Astronomical Institute, Utrecht University, downloaded 1 August 2008</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Reckoning}}Four-season calendar reckoning==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

Accordingly, if floral activity is regularly observed during the coolest quarter of the year in a particular area, it is still considered winter despite the traditional association of flowers with spring and summer.  Additionally, the seasons are considered to change on the same dates everywhere that uses a particular calendar method regardless of variations in climate from one area to another.  \n\n===''Official'' seasons===\nAs noted, a variety of dates and even exact times are used in different countries or regions to mark changes of the calendar seasons.

In 1780 the Societas Meteorologica Palatina (which became defunct in 1795), an early international organization for meteorology, defined seasons as groupings of three whole months as identified by the Gregorian calendar.

The year's coldest months are December and January, when temperatures average around {{Convert|10|\u2013|15|C|F}} in the northwest; temperatures rise as one proceeds towards the equator, peaking around {{Convert|20|\u2013|25|C|F}} in mainland India's southeast.\n* '''Summer''' or '''pre-monsoon''' season, lasting from March to May. In western and southern regions, the hottest month is April; for northern regions of India, May is the hottest month. Temperatures average around {{Convert|32|\u2013|40|C|F}} in most of the interior.\n* '''Monsoon''' or '''rainy''' season, lasting from June to September. The season is dominated by the humid southwest summer monsoon, which slowly sweeps across the country beginning in late May or early June. Monsoon rains begin to recede from North India at the beginning of October. South India typically receives more rainfall.\n* '''Post-monsoon''' or '''autumn''' season, lasting from October to November. In the northwest of India, October and November are usually cloudless. Tamil Nadu receives most of its annual precipitation in the northeast monsoon season.\n\n===Astronomical===\n{{solstice-equinox}}\nAstronomical timing as the basis for designating the temperate seasons dates back at least to the [[Julian calendar]] used by the ancient Romans.  It continues to be used on many modern Gregorian calendars worldwide, although some countries like Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan and Russia prefer to use meteorological reckoning. The precise timing of the seasons is determined by the exact times of transit of the sun over the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn for the [[solstice]]s and the times of the sun's transit over the equator for the [[equinox]]es, or a traditional date close to these times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/EarthSeasons.php|title=Earth's Seasons|publisher=The United States Naval Observatory (USNO)|date=September 21, 2015|website=Astronomical Applications Department|access-date=June 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe following diagram shows the relation between the line of solstice and the line of [[apsides]] of Earth's elliptical orbit.  The orbital ellipse (with eccentricity exaggerated for effect) goes through each of the six Earth images, which are sequentially the [[apsis#Earth's perihelion and aphelion|perihelion]] (periapsis\u2014nearest point to the sun) on anywhere from 2 January to 5 January, the point of March equinox on 19, 20 or 21 March, the point of June solstice on 20 or 21 June, the [[apsis#Earth's perihelion and aphelion|aphelion]] (apoapsis\u2014farthest point from the sun) on anywhere from 4 July to 7 July, the September equinox on 22 or 23 September, and the December solstice on 21 or 22 December.\n\n[[File:Seasons1.svg|thumb|center|middle|upright=3|alt=Illustration of seasonal distances from Earth to the Sun|Note: Distances are exaggerated and not to scale]]\n\nThese \"astronomical\" seasons are not of equal length, because of the [[ellipse|elliptical nature]] of the orbit of the Earth, as discovered by [[Johannes Kepler]].  From the March equinox it currently takes 92.75 days until the June solstice, then 93.65 days until the September equinox, 89.85 days until the December solstice and finally 88.99 days until the March equinox.\n\n====Variation due to calendar misalignment====\n\nThe times of the equinoxes and solstices are not fixed with respect to the modern Gregorian calendar, but fall about six hours later every year, amounting to one full day in four years. They are reset by the occurrence of a leap year. The Gregorian calendar is designed to keep the March equinox no later than 21 March as accurately as is practical. ''Also see: [[Gregorian calendar#Calendar seasonal error|Gregorian calendar seasonal error]].''\n\nThe calendar equinox (used in the calculation of Easter) is 21 March, the same date as in the Easter tables current at the time of the Council of Nicaea in AD 325.   The calendar is therefore framed to prevent the astronomical equinox wandering onto 22 March.   From Nicaea to the date of the reform, the years 500, 600, 700, 900, 1000, 1100, 1300, 1400 and 1500, which would not have been leap years in the Gregorian calendar, amount to nine days, but astronomers directed that ten days be removed.\n\nCurrently, the most common equinox and solstice dates are March 20, June 21, September 22 or 23 and December 21; the four-year average slowly shifts to earlier times as the century progresses.   This shift is a full day in about 128 years (compensated mainly by the century \"leap year\" rules of the Gregorian calendar) and as 2000 was a leap year the current shift has been progressing since the beginning of the last century, when equinoxes and solstices were relatively late.   This also means that in many years of the twentieth century, the dates of March 21, June 22, September 23 and December 22 were much more common, so older books teach (and older people may still remember) these dates.\n\nNote that all the times are given in [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] (roughly speaking, the time at [[Greenwich]], ignoring [[British Summer Time]]). People living farther to the east (Asia and Australia), whose local times are in advance, will see the astronomical seasons apparently start later; for example, in [[Tonga]] (UTC+13), an equinox occurred on September 24, 1999, a date which will not crop up again until 2103. On the other hand, people living far to the west (America) whose clocks run behind UTC may experience an equinox as early as March 19.\n\n====Change over time====\nOver thousands of years, the Earth's [[axial tilt]] and orbital eccentricity vary (see [[Milankovitch cycles]]).   The equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars while the perihelion and aphelion move eastward.   Thus, ten thousand years from now Earth's northern winter will occur at aphelion and northern summer at perihelion. The severity of seasonal change \u2014 the average temperature difference between summer and winter in location \u2014 will also change over time because the Earth's axial tilt fluctuates between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees.\n\nSmaller irregularities in the times are caused by perturbations of the Moon and the other planets.\n\n===Solar===\n[[File:Phases of the Sun (NHemi).png|thumb|right|The annual cycle of insolation (Sun energy, shown in blue) with key points for seasons (middle), [[quarter days]] (top) and [[cross-quarter days]] (bottom) along with months (lower) and Zodiac houses (upper).  The cycle of temperature (shown in pink) is delayed by [[seasonal lag]].]]\n\nSolar timing is based on insolation in which the solstices and equinoxes are seen as the midpoints of the seasons.  It was the method for reckoning seasons in medieval Europe, especially by the [[Celts]], and is still ceremonially observed in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and some East Asian countries. Summer is defined as the quarter of the year with the greatest insolation and winter as the quarter with the least.\n\nThe solar seasons change at the cross-quarter days, which are about 3\u20134 weeks earlier than the meteorological seasons and 6\u20137 weeks earlier than seasons starting at equinoxes and solstices.  Thus, the day of greatest insolation is designated \"midsummer\" as noted in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', which is set on the summer solstice.  On the [[Celtic calendar]], the start of the seasons corresponds to four [[Pagan]] agricultural festivals - the traditional first day of winter is 1 November ([[Samhain]], the Celtic origin of [[Halloween]]); spring starts 1 February ([[Imbolc]], the Celtic origin of [[Groundhog Day]]); summer begins 1 May ([[Beltane]], the Celtic origin of [[May Day]]); the first day of autumn is 1 August (Celtic [[Lughnasadh]]).\n\n==Other season calendar reckoning==\n===Six Seasons===\n\nSome calendars in south Asia use a six-season method where the number of seasons between summer and winter can number from one to three. The dates are fixed at even intervals of months.\n\nIn the [[Hindu calendar]] of tropical and subtropical India, there are six seasons or [[Ritu (Indian season)|Ritu]] that are calendar-based in the sense of having fixed dates: [[Vasanta (Ritu)|Vasanta]] (spring), Greeshma (summer), [[Ritu (Indian season)|Varsha]] ([[monsoon]]), [[Sharad]] (autumn), Hemanta (early winter), and Shishira (prevernal or late winter). The six seasons are ascribed to two months each of the twelve months in the Hindu calendar. The rough correspondences are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Hindu season\n! Start\n! End\n!

Astronomically, the seasons are said to begin on Lichun ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7acb\u6625}}}}, {{abbr|lit.|Literally}} \"standing spring\") on about 4 February, Lixia ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7acb\u590f}}}}) on about 6 May, Liqiu ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7acb\u79cb}}}}) on about 8 August, and Lidong ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7acb\u51ac}}}}) on about 7 November.

So, if we can observe a change in daily floral/animal events, the season is changing.  In this sense, ecological seasons are defined in absolute terms, unlike calendar-based methods in which the seasons are relative.  If specific conditions associated with a particular ecological season don't normally occur in a particular region, then that area cannot be said to experience that season on a regular basis. In Great Britain, the onset of spring used to be defined as when the maximum daily temperature reached 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) in a defined sequence of days.   This almost always occurred in March.   However, with global warming this temperature is now not uncommon in the winter.\n\n===Modern mid-latitude ecological===\nSix ecological seasons can be distinguished which do not have fixed calendar-based dates like the meteorological and astronomical seasons.<ref>{{cite web | author = Michael Allaby | title = A Dictionary of Zoology | year = 1999 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | accessdate= 2012-05-30}}</ref> [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic]] regions tend to experience the beginning of the hibernal season up to a month later than [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#Group D: Continental/microthermal climates|continental climates]]. Conversely, prevernal and vernal seasons begin up to a month earlier near oceanic and coastal areas. For example, prevernal [[crocus]] blooms typically appear as early as February in coastal areas of [[British Columbia]], the [[British Isles]], but generally don't appear until March or April in locations like the [[Midwest]] USA or parts of eastern [[Europe]]. The actual dates for each season vary by climate region and can shift from one year to the next.  Average dates listed here are for mild and cool temperate climate zones in the Northern Hemisphere:\n* '''Prevernal''' (early or pre-spring): Begins February (mild temperate), to March (cool temperate). Deciduous tree buds begin to swell. Some types of migrating birds fly from winter to summer habitats.\n* '''Vernal''' (spring): Begins mid March (mild temperate), to late April (cool temperate). Tree buds burst into leaves. Birds establish territories and begin mating and nesting.\n* '''Estival''' (high summer): Begins June in most temperate climates. Trees in full leaf. Birds hatch and raise offspring.\n* '''Serotinal''' (late summer): Generally begins mid to late August. Deciduous leaves begin to change color in higher latitude locations (above 45 north). Young birds reach maturity and join other adult birds preparing for autumn migration.  The traditional \"harvest season\" begins by early September.\n* '''Autumnal''' (autumn): Generally begins mid to late September. Tree leaves in full color then turn brown and fall to the ground. Birds migrate back to wintering areas.\n* '''Hibernal''' (winter): Begins December (mild temperate), November (cool temperate). Deciduous trees are bare and fallen leaves begin to decay. Migrating birds settled in winter habitats.\n\n===Indigenous ecological===\n{{See also|Indigenous Australian seasons}}\nIndigenous people in polar, temperate and tropical climates of northern Eurasia, the Americas, Africa, Oceania, and Australia have traditionally defined the seasons ecologically by observing the activity of the plants, animals and weather around them. Each separate tribal group traditionally observes different seasons determined according to local criteria that can vary from the hibernation of polar bears on the arctic tundras to the [[growing season]]s of plants in the tropical rainforests.  In Australia, some tribes have up to eight seasons in a year,<ref name=\"Australian weather and the seasons\"/> as do the Sami people in Scandinavia. Many indigenous people who no longer live directly off the land in traditional often nomadic styles, now observe modern methods of seasonal reckoning according to what is customary in their particular country or region.\n\nThe [[Noongar]] people of South-West Western Australia recognise maar-keyen bonar,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:CurtinX+CAS1x+2T2018/8eac4c85693d418e9edc2a39081723de/ |title=Noongar Glossary |publisher=Courses.edx.org |date= |accessdate=2019-03-21}}</ref> or six seasons.

The seasons also correlate to aspects of the human condition, intrinsically linking the lives of the people to the world that surrounds them and also dictating their movements, as with each season, various parts of country would be visited which were particularly abundant or safe from the elements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.noongarculture.org.au/food/ |title=Kaartdijin Noongar |work=Noongarculture.org.au |date= |accessdate=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Noongar season\n!Approximate Months\n!Cultural Parallel\n|-\n|Birak (First Summer)\n|December to January\n|Season of the Young\n|-\n|Bunuru (Second Summer)\n|February to March\n|Season of Adolescence\n|-\n|Djeran (Autumn)\n|April to May\n|Season of Adulthood\n|-\n|Makuru (The First Rains)\n|June to July\n|Fertility Season\n|-\n|Djilba (The Second Rains)\n|August to September\n|Season of Conception\n|-\n|Kambarang (Wildflower Season)\n|October to November\n|Season of Birth\n|}\n\n===Tropical===\n[[File:Diamond Head Hike - Wet & Dry Seasons.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Wet and dry seasons]]\nIn the tropics, where seasonal dates also vary, it is more common to speak of the [[wet season|rainy]] (or wet, or [[monsoon]]) season versus the [[dry season]]. For example, in [[Nicaragua]] the dry season (November to April) is called \"summer\" and the rainy season (May to October) is called \"winter\", even though it is located in the northern hemisphere. There is no noticeable change in the amount of sunlight at different times of the year. However, many regions (such as the northern [[Indian ocean]]) are subject to [[monsoon]] [[rain]] and wind cycles.\n\nFloral and animal activity variation near the equator depends more on wet/dry cycles than seasonal temperature variations, with different species flowering (or emerging from cocoons) at specific times before, during, or after the monsoon season. Thus, the tropics are characterized by numerous \"mini-seasons\" within the larger seasonal blocks of time.\n\n\n===Polar===\nAny point north of the [[Arctic Circle]] or south of the [[Antarctic Circle]] will have one period in the summer called \"polar day\" when the sun does not set, and one period in the winter called 'polar night' when the sun does not rise. At progressively higher latitudes, the maximum periods of \"[[midnight sun]]\" and \"[[polar night]]\" are progressively longer.\n\nFor example, at the military and weather station [[Alert, Nunavut|Alert]] located at 82\u00b030\u203205\u2033N and 62\u00b020\u203220\u2033W, on the northern tip of [[Ellesmere Island]], [[Canada]] (about 450 [[nautical mile]]s or 830 km from the North Pole), the sun begins to peek above the horizon for minutes per day at the end of February and each day it climbs higher and stays up longer; by 21 March, the sun is up for over 12 hours. On 6 April the sun rises at 0522 [[UTC]] and remains above the horizon until it sets below the horizon again on 6 September at 0335 UTC.  By October 13 the sun is above the horizon for only 1 hour 30 minutes, and on October 14 it does not rise above the horizon at all and remains below the horizon until it rises again on 27 February.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/|title=U.S. Naval Observatory|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2018}}\n</ref>\n\nFirst light comes in late January because the sky has [[twilight]], being a glow on the horizon, for increasing hours each day, for more than a month before the sun first appears with its disc above the horizon. From mid-November to mid-January, there is no twilight.\n\nIn the weeks surrounding 21 June, in the northern polar region, the sun is at its highest elevation, appearing to circle the sky there without going below the horizon. Eventually, it does go below the horizon, for progressively longer periods each day until around the middle of October, when it disappears for the last time until the following February. For a few more weeks, \"day\" is marked by decreasing periods of twilight. Eventually, from mid-November to mid-January, there is no twilight and it is continuously dark. In mid January the first faint wash of twilight briefly touches the horizon (for just minutes per day), and then twilight increases in duration with increasing brightness each day until sunrise at end of February, then on 6 April the sun remains above the horizon until mid October.\n\n===Military campaigning seasons===\nSeasonal weather and climate conditions can become important in the context of military operations.\n\nFor navies, the presence of accessible ports and bases can allow naval operations during certain (variable) seasons of the year.

Various cultures define the number and nature of seasons based on regional variations.\n\nDuring May, June, and July, the [[Northern Hemisphere]] is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the [[Southern Hemisphere]] in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer [[month]]s, which increases the [[solar flux]]. However, due to [[seasonal lag]], June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nSeasons often held special significance for agrarian societies, whose lives revolved around [[planting]] and [[harvest]] times, and the change of seasons was often attended by [[ritual]]. In [[temperate]] and [[Subpolar climate|sub-polar]] regions, four seasons based on the [[Gregorian calendar]] are generally recognized: ''[[Spring (season)|spring]]'', ''[[summer]]'', ''[[autumn]]'' or ''fall'', and ''[[winter]]''. The definition of seasons is also cultural. In India from the ancient times, six seasons or [[Ritu (Indian season)|Ritu]] based on south Asian religious or cultural calendars are recognised and identified even today for the purposes such as agriculture and trade. Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate [[climate]] regions which are not tied to any fixed calendar dates: ''prevernal'', ''vernal'', ''estival'', ''serotinal'', ''autumnal'', and ''hibernal''. Many tropical regions have two seasons: the ''[[wet season|rainy]]'', ''[[wet season|wet]]'', or ''[[monsoon]] season'' and the ''[[dry season]]''. Some have a third ''cool'', ''mild'', or ''[[harmattan]] season''. \n\nIn some parts of the world, some other \"seasons\" capture the timing of important ecological events such as ''[[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]]'', ''[[tornado season]]'', and ''[[wildfire]] season''.{{citation needed|reason=This content does not appear anywhere in the article body.|date=June 2016}} The most historically important of these are the three seasons\u2014''[[Akhet (season)|flood]]'', ''[[Season of the Emergence|growth]]'', and ''[[Shemu|low water]]''\u2014which were previously defined by the [[flooding of the Nile|former annual flooding]] of the [[Nile]] in [[Egypt]].[[File:MatheranPanoramaPointDrySeason.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Tropical dry season in [[Maharashtra]], India]]\n[[File:MatheranPanoramaPointMonsoon.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Tropical wet season/monsoon in [[Maharashtra]], India]]\n\n==Causes and effects==\n{{main|Effect of sun angle on climate}}\n\n===Axial tilt===\n[[File:Seasonearth.png|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Illumination of Earth at each change of astronomical season]]\n\n[[File:seasons.svg|frame|right|'''Fig. 1'''<br />This diagram shows how the tilt of [[Earth's axis]] aligns with incoming [[sunlight]] around the [[winter solstice]] of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Regardless of the time of day (i.e. the [[Earth's rotation]] on its axis), the [[North Pole]] will be dark and the [[South Pole]] will be illuminated; see also [[arctic winter]]. In addition to the density of [[angle of incidence (optics)|incident]] light, the [[dissipation]] of light in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is greater when it falls at a shallow angle.]]\n\nThe seasons result from the Earth's [[axis of rotation]] being [[axial tilt#Earth|tilted]] with respect to its [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] by an angle of approximately 23.4 [[degree (angle)|degrees]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cain|first=Fraiser|title=Tilt of the Earth|url=http://www.universetoday.com/26778/tilt-of-the-earth/|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> (This tilt is also known as \"obliquity of the [[ecliptic]]\".)\n\nRegardless of the time of year, the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere]]s always experience opposite seasons. This is because during [[summer]] or [[winter]], one part of the planet is more directly exposed to the rays of the Sun (see ''Fig. 1'') than the other, and this exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. For approximately half of the year (from around March 20 to around September 22), the Northern Hemisphere tips toward the Sun, with the maximum amount occurring on about June 21. For the other half of the year, the same happens, but in the Southern Hemisphere instead of the Northern, with the maximum around December 21. The two instants when the Sun is directly overhead at the [[Equator]] are the [[equinox]]es. Also at that moment, both the [[North Pole]] and the [[South Pole]] of the Earth are just on the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]], and hence day and night are equally divided between the two hemispheres. Around the [[March equinox]], the Northern Hemisphere will be experiencing [[Spring (season)|spring]] as the hours of [[daylight]] increase, and the Southern Hemisphere is experiencing [[autumn]] as daylight hours shorten.\n\nThe effect of axial tilt is observable as the change in [[day length]] and [[altitude (astronomy)|altitude]] of the Sun at solar [[noon]] (the Sun's [[culmination]]) during the [[year]]. The low angle of Sun during the winter months means that incoming rays of solar radiation are [[effect of sun angle on climate|spread over a larger area]] of the Earth's surface, so the light received is more indirect and of lower intensity. Between this effect and the shorter daylight hours, the axial tilt of the Earth accounts for most of the seasonal variation in climate in both hemispheres.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Earth-lighting-summer-solstice EN - corrected.png|Illumination of Earth by Sun at the northern solstice.\nFile:Earth-lighting-winter-solstice EN.png|Illumination of Earth by Sun at the southern solstice.\nFile:North season.jpg|Diagram of the Earth's seasons as seen from the north.

The seasons are not the result of the variation in Earth's distance to the Sun because of its [[elliptical orbit]].<ref>\"Fundamentals of physical geography\", ''PhysicalGeography.net'', Ch. 6: Energy and Matter:(h) Earth-Sun Geometry, [http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/6h.html]</ref> In fact, Earth reaches [[perihelion]] (the point in its orbit closest to the Sun) in January, and it reaches [[aphelion]] (the point farthest from the Sun) in July, so the slight contribution of [[orbital eccentricity]] opposes the temperature trends of the seasons in the Northern Hemisphere.<ref name=\"Science@NASA\">Phillips, Tony, \"[https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2002/02jul_aphelion.htm The Distant Sun (Strange but True: the Sun is far away on the 4th of July)],\" [https://science.nasa.gov/default.htm Science@NASA], downloaded 24 June 2006</ref> In general, the effect of orbital eccentricity on Earth's seasons is a 7% variation in sunlight received.\n\nOrbital eccentricity can influence temperatures, but on Earth, this effect is small and is more than counteracted by other factors; research shows that the Earth as a whole is actually slightly warmer when ''farther'' from the sun. This is because the Northern Hemisphere has more land than the Southern, and land warms more readily than sea.<ref name=\"Science@NASA\"/>\nAny noticeable intensification of southern winters and summers due to Earth's elliptical orbit is mitigated by the abundance of water in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Tony|title=Earth at Perihelion|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast04jan_1/|work=Science News|publisher=NASA|accessdate=14 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Maritime and hemispheric===\nSeasonal weather fluctuations (changes) also depend on factors such as proximity to [[ocean]]s or other large bodies of water, [[ocean current|currents]] in those oceans, [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation|El Ni\u00f1o]]/ENSO and other oceanic cycles, and prevailing [[wind]]s.\n\nIn the [[temperate]] and [[polar regions of Earth|polar regions]], seasons are marked by changes in the amount of [[sunlight]], which in turn often causes [[biological life cycle|cycles]] of dormancy in plants and [[hibernation]] in animals. These effects vary with [[latitude]] and with proximity to bodies of water. For example, the [[South Pole]] is in the middle of the continent of [[Antarctica]] and therefore a considerable distance from the moderating influence of the southern oceans. The [[North Pole]] is in the [[Arctic Ocean]], and thus its temperature extremes are buffered by the water. The result is that the South Pole is consistently colder during the southern winter than the North Pole during the northern winter.\n\nThe seasonal cycle in the polar and temperate zones of one hemisphere is opposite to that of the other. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern, and vice versa.\n\n===Tropics===\n[[Image:BlueMarble monthlies animation.gif|thumb|right|Animation of seasonal differences especially [[snow]] cover through the year]]\nThe [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions see little annual fluctuation of sunlight.  However, seasonal shifts occur along a rainy, low-pressure belt called the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ICZ). As a result, the amount of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] tends to vary more dramatically than the average temperature. When the Zone is north of the Equator, the northern tropics experience their wet season while the southern tropics have their dry season. This pattern reverses when the Zone migrates to a position south of the Equator.\n\n===Mid-latitude thermal lag===\n\nIn meteorological terms, the [[solstice]]s (the maximum and minimum [[insolation]]) do not fall in the middles of summer and winter. The heights of these seasons occur up to 7 weeks later because of [[seasonal lag]]. Seasons, though, are not always defined in meteorological terms.\n\nIn [[astronomy|astronomical]] reckoning by hours of [[daylight]] alone, the solstices and [[equinox]]es are in the ''middle'' of the respective seasons. Because of seasonal lag due to [[thermal absorption]] and release by the oceans, regions with a [[continental climate]], which predominate in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], often consider these four dates to be the ''start'' of the seasons as in the diagram, with the [[cross-quarter day]]s considered seasonal midpoints. The length of these seasons is not uniform because of Earth's [[elliptical orbit]] and its [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|different speeds along that orbit]].<ref>\"[http://www.astro.uu.nl/~strous/AA/en/antwoorden/seizoenen.html#v466 Astronomy Answers AstronomyAnswerBook: Seasons],\" Astronomical Institute, Utrecht University, downloaded 1 August 2008</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Reckoning}}Four-season calendar reckoning==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

Accordingly, if floral activity is regularly observed during the coolest quarter of the year in a particular area, it is still considered winter despite the traditional association of flowers with spring and summer.  Additionally, the seasons are considered to change on the same dates everywhere that uses a particular calendar method regardless of variations in climate from one area to another.  \n\n===''Official'' seasons===\nAs noted, a variety of dates and even exact times are used in different countries or regions to mark changes of the calendar seasons.

In 1780 the Societas Meteorologica Palatina (which became defunct in 1795), an early international organization for meteorology, defined seasons as groupings of three whole months as identified by the Gregorian calendar.

In western and southern regions, the hottest month is April; for northern regions of India, May is the hottest month. Temperatures average around {{Convert|32|\u2013|40|C|F}} in most of the interior.\n* '''Monsoon''' or '''rainy''' season, lasting from June to September. The season is dominated by the humid southwest summer monsoon, which slowly sweeps across the country beginning in late May or early June. Monsoon rains begin to recede from North India at the beginning of October. South India typically receives more rainfall.\n* '''Post-monsoon''' or '''autumn''' season, lasting from October to November. In the northwest of India, October and November are usually cloudless. Tamil Nadu receives most of its annual precipitation in the northeast monsoon season.\n\n===Astronomical===\n{{solstice-equinox}}\nAstronomical timing as the basis for designating the temperate seasons dates back at least to the [[Julian calendar]] used by the ancient Romans.  It continues to be used on many modern Gregorian calendars worldwide, although some countries like Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan and Russia prefer to use meteorological reckoning. The precise timing of the seasons is determined by the exact times of transit of the sun over the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn for the [[solstice]]s and the times of the sun's transit over the equator for the [[equinox]]es, or a traditional date close to these times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/EarthSeasons.php|title=Earth's Seasons|publisher=The United States Naval Observatory (USNO)|date=September 21, 2015|website=Astronomical Applications Department|access-date=June 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe following diagram shows the relation between the line of solstice and the line of [[apsides]] of Earth's elliptical orbit.  The orbital ellipse (with eccentricity exaggerated for effect) goes through each of the six Earth images, which are sequentially the [[apsis#Earth's perihelion and aphelion|perihelion]] (periapsis\u2014nearest point to the sun) on anywhere from 2 January to 5 January, the point of March equinox on 19, 20 or 21 March, the point of June solstice on 20 or 21 June, the [[apsis#Earth's perihelion and aphelion|aphelion]] (apoapsis\u2014farthest point from the sun) on anywhere from 4 July to 7 July, the September equinox on 22 or 23 September, and the December solstice on 21 or 22 December.\n\n[[File:Seasons1.svg|thumb|center|middle|upright=3|alt=Illustration of seasonal distances from Earth to the Sun|Note: Distances are exaggerated and not to scale]]\n\nThese \"astronomical\" seasons are not of equal length, because of the [[ellipse|elliptical nature]] of the orbit of the Earth, as discovered by [[Johannes Kepler]].  From the March equinox it currently takes 92.75 days until the June solstice, then 93.65 days until the September equinox, 89.85 days until the December solstice and finally 88.99 days until the March equinox.\n\n====Variation due to calendar misalignment====\n\nThe times of the equinoxes and solstices are not fixed with respect to the modern Gregorian calendar, but fall about six hours later every year, amounting to one full day in four years. They are reset by the occurrence of a leap year. The Gregorian calendar is designed to keep the March equinox no later than 21 March as accurately as is practical. ''Also see: [[Gregorian calendar#Calendar seasonal error|Gregorian calendar seasonal error]].''\n\nThe calendar equinox (used in the calculation of Easter) is 21 March, the same date as in the Easter tables current at the time of the Council of Nicaea in AD 325.   The calendar is therefore framed to prevent the astronomical equinox wandering onto 22 March.   From Nicaea to the date of the reform, the years 500, 600, 700, 900, 1000, 1100, 1300, 1400 and 1500, which would not have been leap years in the Gregorian calendar, amount to nine days, but astronomers directed that ten days be removed.\n\nCurrently, the most common equinox and solstice dates are March 20, June 21, September 22 or 23 and December 21; the four-year average slowly shifts to earlier times as the century progresses.   This shift is a full day in about 128 years (compensated mainly by the century \"leap year\" rules of the Gregorian calendar) and as 2000 was a leap year the current shift has been progressing since the beginning of the last century, when equinoxes and solstices were relatively late.   This also means that in many years of the twentieth century, the dates of March 21, June 22, September 23 and December 22 were much more common, so older books teach (and older people may still remember) these dates.\n\nNote that all the times are given in [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] (roughly speaking, the time at [[Greenwich]], ignoring [[British Summer Time]]). People living farther to the east (Asia and Australia), whose local times are in advance, will see the astronomical seasons apparently start later; for example, in [[Tonga]] (UTC+13), an equinox occurred on September 24, 1999, a date which will not crop up again until 2103. On the other hand, people living far to the west (America) whose clocks run behind UTC may experience an equinox as early as March 19.\n\n====Change over time====\nOver thousands of years, the Earth's [[axial tilt]] and orbital eccentricity vary (see [[Milankovitch cycles]]).   The equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars while the perihelion and aphelion move eastward.   Thus, ten thousand years from now Earth's northern winter will occur at aphelion and northern summer at perihelion. The severity of seasonal change \u2014 the average temperature difference between summer and winter in location \u2014 will also change over time because the Earth's axial tilt fluctuates between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees.\n\nSmaller irregularities in the times are caused by perturbations of the Moon and the other planets.\n\n===Solar===\n[[File:Phases of the Sun (NHemi).png|thumb|right|The annual cycle of insolation (Sun energy, shown in blue) with key points for seasons (middle), [[quarter days]] (top) and [[cross-quarter days]] (bottom) along with months (lower) and Zodiac houses (upper).  The cycle of temperature (shown in pink) is delayed by [[seasonal lag]].]]\n\nSolar timing is based on insolation in which the solstices and equinoxes are seen as the midpoints of the seasons.  It was the method for reckoning seasons in medieval Europe, especially by the [[Celts]], and is still ceremonially observed in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and some East Asian countries. Summer is defined as the quarter of the year with the greatest insolation and winter as the quarter with the least.\n\nThe solar seasons change at the cross-quarter days, which are about 3\u20134 weeks earlier than the meteorological seasons and 6\u20137 weeks earlier than seasons starting at equinoxes and solstices.  Thus, the day of greatest insolation is designated \"midsummer\" as noted in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', which is set on the summer solstice.  On the [[Celtic calendar]], the start of the seasons corresponds to four [[Pagan]] agricultural festivals - the traditional first day of winter is 1 November ([[Samhain]], the Celtic origin of [[Halloween]]); spring starts 1 February ([[Imbolc]], the Celtic origin of [[Groundhog Day]]); summer begins 1 May ([[Beltane]], the Celtic origin of [[May Day]]); the first day of autumn is 1 August (Celtic [[Lughnasadh]]).\n\n==Other season calendar reckoning==\n===Six Seasons===\n\nSome calendars in south Asia use a six-season method where the number of seasons between summer and winter can number from one to three. The dates are fixed at even intervals of months.\n\nIn the [[Hindu calendar]] of tropical and subtropical India, there are six seasons or [[Ritu (Indian season)|Ritu]] that are calendar-based in the sense of having fixed dates: [[Vasanta (Ritu)|Vasanta]] (spring), Greeshma (summer), [[Ritu (Indian season)|Varsha]] ([[monsoon]]), [[Sharad]] (autumn), Hemanta (early winter), and Shishira (prevernal or late winter). The six seasons are ascribed to two months each of the twelve months in the Hindu calendar. The rough correspondences are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Hindu season\n! Start\n! End\n!

Astronomically, the seasons are said to begin on Lichun ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7acb\u6625}}}}, {{abbr|lit.|Literally}} \"standing spring\") on about 4 February, Lixia ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7acb\u590f}}}}) on about 6 May, Liqiu ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7acb\u79cb}}}}) on about 8 August, and Lidong ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7acb\u51ac}}}}) on about 7 November.

So, if we can observe a change in daily floral/animal events, the season is changing.  In this sense, ecological seasons are defined in absolute terms, unlike calendar-based methods in which the seasons are relative.  If specific conditions associated with a particular ecological season don't normally occur in a particular region, then that area cannot be said to experience that season on a regular basis. In Great Britain, the onset of spring used to be defined as when the maximum daily temperature reached 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) in a defined sequence of days.   This almost always occurred in March.   However, with global warming this temperature is now not uncommon in the winter.\n\n===Modern mid-latitude ecological===\nSix ecological seasons can be distinguished which do not have fixed calendar-based dates like the meteorological and astronomical seasons.<ref>{{cite web | author = Michael Allaby | title = A Dictionary of Zoology | year = 1999 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | accessdate= 2012-05-30}}</ref> [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic]] regions tend to experience the beginning of the hibernal season up to a month later than [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#Group D: Continental/microthermal climates|continental climates]]. Conversely, prevernal and vernal seasons begin up to a month earlier near oceanic and coastal areas. For example, prevernal [[crocus]] blooms typically appear as early as February in coastal areas of [[British Columbia]], the [[British Isles]], but generally don't appear until March or April in locations like the [[Midwest]] USA or parts of eastern [[Europe]]. The actual dates for each season vary by climate region and can shift from one year to the next.  Average dates listed here are for mild and cool temperate climate zones in the Northern Hemisphere:\n* '''Prevernal''' (early or pre-spring): Begins February (mild temperate), to March (cool temperate). Deciduous tree buds begin to swell. Some types of migrating birds fly from winter to summer habitats.\n* '''Vernal''' (spring): Begins mid March (mild temperate), to late April (cool temperate). Tree buds burst into leaves. Birds establish territories and begin mating and nesting.\n* '''Estival''' (high summer): Begins June in most temperate climates. Trees in full leaf. Birds hatch and raise offspring.\n* '''Serotinal''' (late summer): Generally begins mid to late August. Deciduous leaves begin to change color in higher latitude locations (above 45 north). Young birds reach maturity and join other adult birds preparing for autumn migration.  The traditional \"harvest season\" begins by early September.\n* '''Autumnal''' (autumn): Generally begins mid to late September. Tree leaves in full color then turn brown and fall to the ground. Birds migrate back to wintering areas.\n* '''Hibernal''' (winter): Begins December (mild temperate), November (cool temperate). Deciduous trees are bare and fallen leaves begin to decay. Migrating birds settled in winter habitats.\n\n===Indigenous ecological===\n{{See also|Indigenous Australian seasons}}\nIndigenous people in polar, temperate and tropical climates of northern Eurasia, the Americas, Africa, Oceania, and Australia have traditionally defined the seasons ecologically by observing the activity of the plants, animals and weather around them. Each separate tribal group traditionally observes different seasons determined according to local criteria that can vary from the hibernation of polar bears on the arctic tundras to the [[growing season]]s of plants in the tropical rainforests.  In Australia, some tribes have up to eight seasons in a year,<ref name=\"Australian weather and the seasons\"/> as do the Sami people in Scandinavia. Many indigenous people who no longer live directly off the land in traditional often nomadic styles, now observe modern methods of seasonal reckoning according to what is customary in their particular country or region.\n\nThe [[Noongar]] people of South-West Western Australia recognise maar-keyen bonar,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:CurtinX+CAS1x+2T2018/8eac4c85693d418e9edc2a39081723de/ |title=Noongar Glossary |publisher=Courses.edx.org |date= |accessdate=2019-03-21}}</ref> or six seasons.

For example, in [[Nicaragua]] the dry season (November to April) is called \"summer\" and the rainy season (May to October) is called \"winter\", even though it is located in the northern hemisphere. There is no noticeable change in the amount of sunlight at different times of the year. However, many regions (such as the northern [[Indian ocean]]) are subject to [[monsoon]] [[rain]] and wind cycles.\n\nFloral and animal activity variation near the equator depends more on wet/dry cycles than seasonal temperature variations, with different species flowering (or emerging from cocoons) at specific times before, during, or after the monsoon season. Thus, the tropics are characterized by numerous \"mini-seasons\" within the larger seasonal blocks of time.\n\n\n===Polar===\nAny point north of the [[Arctic Circle]] or south of the [[Antarctic Circle]] will have one period in the summer called \"polar day\" when the sun does not set, and one period in the winter called 'polar night' when the sun does not rise. At progressively higher latitudes, the maximum periods of \"[[midnight sun]]\" and \"[[polar night]]\" are progressively longer.\n\nFor example, at the military and weather station [[Alert, Nunavut|Alert]] located at 82\u00b030\u203205\u2033N and 62\u00b020\u203220\u2033W, on the northern tip of [[Ellesmere Island]], [[Canada]] (about 450 [[nautical mile]]s or 830 km from the North Pole), the sun begins to peek above the horizon for minutes per day at the end of February and each day it climbs higher and stays up longer; by 21 March, the sun is up for over 12 hours. On 6 April the sun rises at 0522 [[UTC]] and remains above the horizon until it sets below the horizon again on 6 September at 0335 UTC.  By October 13 the sun is above the horizon for only 1 hour 30 minutes, and on October 14 it does not rise above the horizon at all and remains below the horizon until it rises again on 27 February.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/|title=U.S. Naval Observatory|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2018}}\n</ref>\n\nFirst light comes in late January because the sky has [[twilight]], being a glow on the horizon, for increasing hours each day, for more than a month before the sun first appears with its disc above the horizon. From mid-November to mid-January, there is no twilight.\n\nIn the weeks surrounding 21 June, in the northern polar region, the sun is at its highest elevation, appearing to circle the sky there without going below the horizon. Eventually, it does go below the horizon, for progressively longer periods each day until around the middle of October, when it disappears for the last time until the following February. For a few more weeks, \"day\" is marked by decreasing periods of twilight. Eventually, from mid-November to mid-January, there is no twilight and it is continuously dark. In mid January the first faint wash of twilight briefly touches the horizon (for just minutes per day), and then twilight increases in duration with increasing brightness each day until sunrise at end of February, then on 6 April the sun remains above the horizon until mid October.\n\n===Military campaigning seasons===\nSeasonal weather and climate conditions can become important in the context of military operations.\n\nFor navies, the presence of accessible ports and bases can allow naval operations during certain (variable) seasons of the year. The availability of [[ice-free harbor | ice-free]] or [[warm-water port]]s can make navies much more effective. Thus [[Russia]], historically navally constrained when confined to using [[Arkhangelsk]] (before the 18th century) and even [[Kronstadt]], has particular interests in maintaining and in preserving access to [[Baltiysk]], [[Vladivostok]], and [[Sevastopol]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n | editor1-last = Stokke\n | editor1-first = Olav Schram\n | editor2-last = Tunander\n | editor2-first = Ola\n | editor2-link = Ola Tunander\n | editor3-last = Nansen\n | editor3-first = Fridtjof\n | editor3-link = Fridtjof Nansen\n | title = The Barents region: cooperation in Arctic Europe\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KZ9mAAAAMAAJ\n | series = International Peace Research Institute, Oslo Prio Series\n | volume = 10\n | publisher = SAGE\n | date = 1994\n | page = 98\n | edition = reprint\n | access-date = 21 August 2019\n | quote = Witte wanted the main base of the Russian Navy to be situated at a location where waters were ice-free the whole year round [...].\n| isbn = 9780803978973\n }}\n</ref>\nStorm seasons or polar winter-weather conditions can inhibit surface warships at sea.\n\nPre-modern armies, especially in Europe, tended to campaign in the summer months - peasant [[conscription | conscripts]] tended to melt away at [[harvest time]], nor did it make economic sense in an agricultural society to neglect the [[sowing]] season.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | chapter = Games and war in Ancient Greece: Discussion\n | editor1-last = Cornell\n | editor1-first = Tim J.\n | editor1-link = Tim Cornell\n | editor2-last = Allen\n | editor2-first = Thomas B.\n | title = War and Games\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nQAXzSJsqKcC\n | series = Studies on the nature of war\n | volume = 3\n | location = Woodbridge, Suffolk\n | publisher = Boydell Press\n | date = 2002\n | page = 34\n | isbn = 9780851158709\n | access-date = 21 August 2019\n | quote = The warriors are farmers and the farmers are warriors, so you have to time your war in relation to the harvest and to other agricultural events.
