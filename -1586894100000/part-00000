If one decided to re-couple and the other did not, then the one that didn't would be single but still remain on the island.

It was then down to the only single Islanders Georgia and Wes to couple up with one of them, and therefore save them from being dumped. Georgia chose to couple up with Sam, and Wes chose Megan.\n* {{note|4|Note 4}}: After being chosen by their fellow Islanders, Georgia and Sam were given the choice to leave as a couple or remain in the villa but stay single. They decided to stay, meaning they were not permitted to couple up during the next recoupling. However, during the recoupling both refused to couple with anybody else meaning they had to leave the villa.\n</small>\n\n==Casa Amor==\nOn 27 June 2017, it was confirmed that \u2018Casa Amor\u2019 would be reintroduced following its success during the previous series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/new-love-island-boys-girls-12803716|title=Meet the 12 new Love Island boys and girls|first=Rose|last=Hill|date=5 July 2018}}</ref> It is a second villa featuring new Islanders in a twist designed to put the couples to the ultimate test.

The new Islanders for the twist included six girls; Charlie, Darylle, Ellie, Grace, Kazimir and Savanna, as well as six boys; Alex, Charlie, Dean, Frankie, Jack and Jordan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/reality-tv/news/g25316/love-island-2018-meet-new-islanders-second-villa/|title=Meet all the NEW singletons moving into Love Island|date=27 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe twist came to its conclusion four days later when the original Islanders were given the choice of remaining with their current partner in the opposite villa or couple up with one of the new Islanders. However, as they were living in separate villas, they were not aware of each other's choice. If one decided to re-couple and the other did not, then the one that didn't would be single but still remain on the island. If both re-coupled then they would both remain in the villa with their new partner, and any remaining single new islanders would be dumped. At the end of this, Georgia and Wes became the only single original Islanders, and Charlie W, Dean, Jordan and Savanna were dumped.<ref name=\"digitalspy.com1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/love-island/news/a860799/love-island-2018-catch-up-dumped-evicted-islanders-casa-amor-recoupling/|title=FOUR dumped from Love Island villa in Casa Amor twist|date=2 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Weekly summary==\nThe main events in the ''Love Island'' villa are summarised in the table below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 96%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" style=\"width: 6%;\" | Week 1\n| '''Entrances''' ||\n* On Day 1, Adam, Alex G, Dani, Eyal, Hayley, Jack Fi, Kendall, Laura A, Niall, Samira and Wes entered the villa.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hegarty |first1=Tasha |last2=Hutchinson |first2=Emily |title=See the Love Island girls and boys arriving at the villa in first-look pictures |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/reality-tv/news/g25276/love-island-contestants-girls-boys-villa-first-look-pictures/ |accessdate=6 June 2018 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]] |date=4 June 2018}}</ref>\n* On Day 4, Georgia and Rosie entered the villa.<ref name=\"Harp\"/>\n|-\n| '''Coupling''' ||\n* On Day 1, the Islanders coupled up for the first time.

It is on the old main highway leading from [[Amman]] to [[Jerusalem]]. Situated in the Balqa highland, about 790\u20131,100 metres above sea level, the town is built in the crook of three hills, close to the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]]. One of the three hills, Jabal al-Qal'a, is the site of a 13th-century ruined fortress. It is the capital of [[Balqa Governorate]].\n\nThe [[Salt Municipality|Greater Salt Municipality]] has about 97,000 inhabitants (2006) \n\n==History==\nIt is not known when the city was first inhabited, but it is believed that it was built by the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] army during the reign of [[Alexander the Great]]. The town was known as ''Saltus'' in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times and was the seat of a [[Diocese|bishopric]]. At this time, the town was considered to be the principal settlement on the [[Transjordan (region)|East Bank]] of the [[Jordan River]]. The settlement was destroyed by the [[Mongols]] and then rebuilt during the reign of the [[Mamluk]] sultan [[Baibars]] (1260\u20131277) and became a regional capital once more during the time of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In the early 1830s, Salt was again attacked, this time being blown up during a raid by the Egyptian viceroy [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] in his campaigns against the Ottomans in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].\n\nSalt's heyday was in the late 19th century when traders arrived from [[Nablus]] to expand their trading network eastwards beyond the [[Jordan River]]. As a result of the influx of newcomers this period saw the rapid expansion of Salt from a simple village into a town with many architecturally elegant buildings, many built in the ''Nablusi'' style from the attractive honey-coloured local stone. A large number of buildings from this era survive {{As of|2009|lc=y}}.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], the town was the site which [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], British High Commissioner of Palestine, chose to make his announcement that the British favoured a Hejazi [[Hashemites|Hashemite]] ruled entity on the East Bank of the Mandatory Palestine (current Jordan). This wish became reality in 1921 when [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah I]] became Emir of Transjordan. Salt seemed to be the city that would be chosen as the capital of the new emirate since most of the industry and commerce flowed through Salt. During this period Salt had no high schools. Even so, Abdullah picked the city as the capital of his emerging emirate but later changed his mind and moved his compound and entourage to Amman when he and the notables of Salt had a disagreement. Amman at that time was a small city of only 20,000 people which experienced rapid growth.\n\n==Municipal Districts==\nThe Greater Salt Municipality is divided into nine districts:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \n!

Indeed, it is speculated that the town's name provided the root for [[Sultana (grape)|sultana]], a certain type of [[raisin]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}<!--  ?? [[Sultana (grape)|Sultana]] is from \"Sultan\" -->\n\nIt is thought that the name Salt was derived from the city Saltos of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\n[[Wadi Shu'aib]] (Valley of Jethro) is one of the largest agricultural sites in Salt city, a valley with large agricultural areas. It is named after one of the prophets in [[Islam]] (as well as [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]]), [[Shoaib]] ([[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]]), who was the father-in-law of [[Moses]] and one of the descendants of Ibrahim ([[Abraham]]). Most privately owned farms are located in this valley; the primary crops are grapes, olives and fruit-bearing trees.\n\n==Education==\nSalt contains many schools, including the public first secondary school of Jordan dating back to 1918, as well as many private schools that date back to the 1800s, such as the Latin School and the Catholic School. It is also the home of the [[Holy Land Institute for the Deaf]], a non-profit educational center for people with hearing impairment. The city has two universities surrounding it: [[Al-Balqa` Applied University]] established in 1997 and [[Al-Ahliyya Amman University]] (Amman National University) located on the highway connecting [[Amman]] to Salt.\n\n==Tourism==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nAn ancient town, Salt was once the most important settlement in the area between the Jordan Valley and the eastern desert. Because of its history as an important trading link between the eastern desert and the west, it was a significant place for the region's many rulers.\n\nThe Romans, Byzantines and Mameluks all contributed to the growth of the town but it was at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, during Ottoman rule, when Salt enjoyed its most prosperous period.\n\nIt was at that time that the Ottomans established a regional administrative base in Salt and encouraged settlement from other parts of their empire. As the town's status increased, many merchants arrived and, with their newly acquired wealth, built the fine houses that can still be admired in Salt today.\n\nThese splendid yellow sandstone buildings incorporate a variety of styles. Typically, they have domed roofs, interior courtyards and characteristic tall, arched windows. Perhaps the most beautiful is the Abu Jaber mansion, built between 1892 and 1906, which has frescoed ceilings, painted by Italian artists, and is reputed to be the finest example of a 19th-century merchant house in the region.\n\nTightly built on a cluster of three hills, Salt has several other places of interest, including Roman tombs on the outskirts of town and the citadel and site of the town's early 13th century [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] fortress which was built by al- Ma\u2019azzam Isa, the nephew of [[Saladin]] soon after 1198 AD. There is also a small museum and a handicraft school where the traditional skills of ceramics, weaving, silk-screen printing and dyeing are shown.\n\nSalt's Archaeological & Folklore Museum displays artifacts dating back to the [[Chalcolithic]] period to the Islamic era as well as other items relating to the history of the area. In the folklore museum there is presentation of Bedouin and traditional costumes and everyday folkloric items.\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Jordan}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"220px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Salt, Jordan.jpg|The city of Salt is located on hilly plateaus\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Commonscat|As-Salt|Al-Salt}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Largest cities of Jordan}}\n\n{{coord|32|02|N|35|44|E|region:JO_type:city|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Salt}}\n[[Category:Populated places in Balqa Governorate]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=May 2018}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n<!--See the Table at Infobox Settlement for all fields and descriptions of usage-->\n<!-- Basic info  ---------------->\n|name                   = Al-Salt\n|native_name            = {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637}}\n|other_name             =Saltus\n|settlement_type        = City\n|image_skyline          = AS-SALT 2.png\n|imagesize              =\n|image_caption          = Clockwise from the left top: As-Salt's skyline, Great Mosque of As-Salt, St. George Church, Latin Church, As-Salt Castle, As-Salt Archaeological Museum, Al-Hammam Road and As-Salt Small Mosque .\n|image_flag             = \n|flag_size              =\n|image_seal             =\n|seal_size              = 100px\n|image_shield           = \n|shield_size            =\n|nickname               = Saltus (Ancient Greek)\n|motto                  =\n<!-- images and maps  ----------->\n|image_map              = \n|mapsize                =\n|map_caption            = \n|pushpin_map            = Jordan\n|pushpin_label_position = bottom\n|pushpin_mapsize        = \n|pushpin_map_caption    = Location in Jordan\n<!-- Location ------------------>\n|coordinates            = {{coord|32|02|N|35|44|E|region:JO|display=inline}}\n|subdivision_type       = Country\n|subdivision_name       = {{flag|Jordan}}\n|subdivision_type1      = [[Governorates of Jordan|Governorate]]\n|subdivision_type2      =\n|subdivision_type3      =\n|subdivision_name1      = [[Balqa Governorate]]\n|subdivision_name2      = \n|subdivision_name3      = \n|established_title      = Founded <!-- Settled -->\n|established_date       = 300 B.C.\n|established_title2     = Municipality <!-- Settled -->\n|established_date2      = 1887\n<!-- Area    --------------------->\n|government_footnotes   =\n|government_type        = Municipality\n|leader_title           = Mayor\n|leader_name            = Khalid Khashman\n|leader_title1          =  <!-- for places with, say, both a mayor and a city manager -->\n|leader_name1           =\n|unit_pref              =metric <!--Enter: Imperial, if Imperial (metric) is desired-->\n|area_footnotes         = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salt.gov.jo/ar/inside/About_Manicipality/Areas/SALT.htm|title=Salt Greater Municipality|accessdate=25 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029013420/http://www.salt.gov.jo/ar/inside/About_Manicipality/Areas/SALT.htm|archive-date=2010-10-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|area_magnitude         = \n|area_total_km2         = 48 <!-- ALL fields dealing with a measurements are subject to automatic unit conversion-->\n|area_land_km2          = <!--See table @ Template:Infobox Settlement for details on automatic unit conversion-->\n<!-- Population   ----------------------->\n|area_metro_km2         = 79\n|elevation_footnotes    =  <!--for references: use <ref> </ref> tags-->\n|elevation_m            = 820\n|elevation_ft           =\n<!-- Area/postal codes & others -------->\n|population_total               = 88,900  \n|population_as_of               =2011\n|population_footnotes           =\n|population_density_km2         = 1479\n|population_density_sq_mi       =\n|population_density_metro_km2   =\n|population_density_metro_sq_mi =\n|population_blank1_title        = Ethnicities\n|population_blank1              =\n|population_density_blank1_km2 =   \n|population_density_blank1_sq_mi =\n<!-- General information  --------------->\n|population_note                =\n|postal_code_type       =  <!-- enter ZIP code, Postcode, Post code, Postal code... -->\n|postal_code            =\n|area_code              = +(962)5\n|website                = http://www.salt.gov.jo/ar\n|footnotes              = \n|<!-- Politics ----------------->\n|timezone               =[[UTC]]+2\n|utc_offset             = +2\n|timezone_DST           =[[UTC]]+3\n|utc_offset_DST         = +3\n|blank_name             =\n|blank_info             =\n|blank1_name            =\n|blank1_info            =\n}}\n\n'''Al-Salt''' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637}} ''As-Salt'' <small>\u2014 pronounced Es-Sult or Es-Salt</small>) is an ancient agricultural town and administrative centre in west-central [[Jordan]]. It is on the old main highway leading from [[Amman]] to [[Jerusalem]]. Situated in the Balqa highland, about 790\u20131,100 metres above sea level, the town is built in the crook of three hills, close to the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]]. One of the three hills, Jabal al-Qal'a, is the site of a 13th-century ruined fortress. It is the capital of [[Balqa Governorate]].\n\nThe [[Salt Municipality|Greater Salt Municipality]] has about 97,000 inhabitants (2006) \n\n==History==\nIt is not known when the city was first inhabited, but it is believed that it was built by the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] army during the reign of [[Alexander the Great]]. The town was known as ''Saltus'' in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times and was the seat of a [[Diocese|bishopric]]. At this time, the town was considered to be the principal settlement on the [[Transjordan (region)|East Bank]] of the [[Jordan River]]. The settlement was destroyed by the [[Mongols]] and then rebuilt during the reign of the [[Mamluk]] sultan [[Baibars]] (1260\u20131277) and became a regional capital once more during the time of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In the early 1830s, Salt was again attacked, this time being blown up during a raid by the Egyptian viceroy [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] in his campaigns against the Ottomans in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].\n\nSalt's heyday was in the late 19th century when traders arrived from [[Nablus]] to expand their trading network eastwards beyond the [[Jordan River]]. As a result of the influx of newcomers this period saw the rapid expansion of Salt from a simple village into a town with many architecturally elegant buildings, many built in the ''Nablusi'' style from the attractive honey-coloured local stone. A large number of buildings from this era survive {{As of|2009|lc=y}}.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], the town was the site which [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], British High Commissioner of Palestine, chose to make his announcement that the British favoured a Hejazi [[Hashemites|Hashemite]] ruled entity on the East Bank of the Mandatory Palestine (current Jordan). This wish became reality in 1921 when [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah I]] became Emir of Transjordan. Salt seemed to be the city that would be chosen as the capital of the new emirate since most of the industry and commerce flowed through Salt. During this period Salt had no high schools. Even so, Abdullah picked the city as the capital of his emerging emirate but later changed his mind and moved his compound and entourage to Amman when he and the notables of Salt had a disagreement. Amman at that time was a small city of only 20,000 people which experienced rapid growth.\n\n==Municipal Districts==\nThe Greater Salt Municipality is divided into nine districts:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \n!

With Henry now operating in Dystopia, Captain Man and Schwoz open up the Swellview Academy of the Gifted where they get Chapa, Miles, Mika, and Bose as their students ever since they were exposed to the energies of the Omega Weapon. Schwoz has been teaching the kids the L.I.E. (short for Lying is Everything) to conceal their secret identity. After a comical drill, the Danger Force learns that Swellview is in the middle of a crime drought. When Captain Man is called somewhere, he claims that he is visiting them as a way to fight crime. Later that night, Captain Man zaps the different news people to keep the Danger Force about stopping the theft of a goat who says \"but.\" The Danger Force figures out that Captain Man has been lying about the crime drought. Due to the accusations of lying, Captain Man does another cover-up as he goes to prevent a kid named Crank and his two followers from freeing their grandfather from Swellview Prison so that he can get the monkey he owes Crank. The Danger Force teleports to Swellview Prison where they try to help fight the bad guys.

[[Kadima (youth group)|Kadima]] (Hebrew for \"Forward\") is USY's program for pre-teens grades 5-8 (varies by region).\n\n==History==\n'''The First USY Chapter'''\n\nUnder the leadership of both Rabbi David Aronson and Rabbi Kassel Abelson, the first USY chapter was founded at Beth El Synagogue in Minneapolis in 1948 to provide for the social and spiritual needs of its teens. Soon, other synagogues began following suit.\n\n'''Founding the National Organization'''\n\n\u201c''The Youth Commission unanimously agrees that the teenage groups come under the general supervision of the Youth Commission. Teenage groups should include boys and girls of high school level, 13 to 17 years inclusive\u2026The Youth Commission shall concern itself with non-scholastic group work for teenagers''.\u201d\n\nWith these words, on March 19, 1951, USY was formed nationally at its first convention, bringing together delegates from synagogues and other youth groups across the country, along with lay and professional youth workers of USCJ.\n\nAll told, more than 500 people, representing 65 communities from 14 states and Canada attended the first official meeting of USY.\n\nAt that convening, under the leadership of the newly elected national president, Paul Freedman, the two basic documents of the organization, Aims and Objectives and the USY Constitution, were adopted.\n\n'''USY's Tzedakah Program'''\n\nIn 1956, the Two-o-Nine ''tzedakah'' (charity) project began (later revamped to become ''Tikun Olam'' (Repairing the World), the social action/charity project that all contemporary USYers recognize).\n\n'''Summer Travel for Teens'''\n\nThat same summer, twelve USYers went on the first organization sponsored trip to Israel. Known as the USY Israel Summer Pilgrimage, it became the first of the USY summer programs.\n\nTwo years later, Pilgrimage enrollment had already increased to 100 teens. In 1961, USY further expanded its summer programs when two staff members took four USYers on their \u201c''Schlep'' and Pray Across the USA,\u201d the first USY on Wheels trip.\n\n'''PreTeen Programming'''\n\nIn 1969, the Youth Commission created [[Kadima (youth group)|Kadima]], the youth group for middle school and junior high students.\n\n'''USY Today'''\n\nToday USY has 350 local chapters in 15 regions across North America.\n\n==Structure==\nUSY has three main levels of entry into the organization, the chapter level, the regional level, and the international level. The HaNegev and METNY regions are also split into sub-regions and divisions, respectively.\n\n===Chapter===\nChapters, typically run out of local USCJ congregations, provide programming on the local level. This includes social, religious, educational, and community service-based programming. Social programming ranges from lounge and movie nights to pool parties and paintballing. Religious, educational, and community service-based programming include mock-seders, Israel education, and volunteering. \n\nAll programming is planned by the Chapter Board with the assistance of a professional advisor. Typically, a given chapter's name is an acronym of the synagogue or city in which the chapter is based followed by the letters \"USY\". For example, the  \"Congregation '''B'''eth '''J'''udea in Long Grove is shortened to '''BJ'''USY\". Chapters are associated with a USCJ-affiliated synagogue.\n\n===Regional===\nRegions consist of chapters in the same geographical area. Regions gather for bi-monthly, quarterly, and annual regional events, such as weekend-long ''kinnusim'' (conventions) and week-long encampments. There are 15 USY regions.\n\n===Sub-Regional/Divisional===\nLarger USY regions are occasionally split into sub-regions or divisions. The sub-regions and divisions act much like regions, overseeing their respective chapters, and holding their own conventions and elections. Currently, there are two regions, HaNegev and METNY, with sub-regions or divisions. HaNegev's sub-regions are each led by a three-person executive board, and METNY's divisions are each led by a six-person executive board.  HaNegev's three sub-regions are Arvot (South Florida), Mercaz (North and Central Florida), and Ein Gedi (Florida Panhandle, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina). METNY's three (previously four) divisions are Emek (Hudson Valley), Sababa (Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn), and Ruach (Long Island).\n\n===International===\nOn the international level, USY holds an International Convention, the largest gathering of Conservative Jewish teens in North America, and runs summer trips across the United States, Canada, Israel, and Europe. \n\nThe International Board is composed of the six-person International Executive Board (IEB), comprising the President and five Vice-Presidents and the committees of the International General Board (IGB), overseen by the IEB. The IEB is elected at the International Convention, which takes place every December, and the members serve for one calendar year, unlike chapter and regional boards, which are elected at regional Spring Conventions in mid- to late spring.\n\n==Programs==\nInternational USY provides the following programming:\n\n===USY Summer Experience<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://usy.org/escape/|title=Jewish Summer Teen Travel Programs {{!}} USY|website=usy.org|access-date=2016-12-19}}</ref>===\nUSY runs simultaneous four-to-seven-week summer programs across [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. The trips through Europe culminate in [[Israel]].\n\n''USY on Wheels'' is a six-week bus tour throughout the continental [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Alaska]]. Participants spend the summer visiting America's greatest landmarks, including the [[Grand Canyon]] and [[Pier 39]], as well as the country's more obscure destinations including the [[Corn Palace]] and [[Wall Drug]]. The program's goal is giving teens the opportunity to understand what it means to live Jewishly no matter where you go. Participants stay in both hotels and home hospitality. Participants keep Kosher and pause to celebrate [[Shabbat]] throughout the summer. In addition to the \"Classic\" Wheels trip, other travel options include:\n* Wheels East, a four-week [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] trip exclusively for 7th and 8th grades\n* Wheels West, a four-week [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]] trip exclusively for 7th and 8th graders\n* Pacific Northwest, a three-week trip that includes two-weeks on the West Coast and a one-week Alaskan cruise\nUSY's trips to Israel, ''USY Israel Pilgrimage'', consist of an optional week in [[Poland]] or [[Eastern Europe]] followed by a month in Israel, learning about Jewish communities and the ''[[Shoah]]'' (Holocaust). Pilgrimage trips visit every major city and region, including [[Jerusalem]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Haifa]], [[Tiberias]], [[Beersheba]], and [[Eilat]]. In addition to city life, the program incorporates many hiking opportunities and outdoor experiences, in areas including the [[Golan Heights]], the [[Jordan River]], the [[Galilee]] the [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[Masada]], the [[Dead Sea]], the [[Negev]], the [[Red Sea]], and archaeological digs of ancient Jewish civilization, all led by professional tour guides. Another option for Israel Pilgrimage is L'Takayn Olam, a program that blends social action and volunteering with sightseeing.\n\nUSY also partners with the DREAM Project for DREAM USY, a two-week social action trip in the [[Dominican Republic]].\n\n===International Convention===\n[[File:Hatikvah 6 Frontman Omri Glickman .png|thumb|Hatikvah 6 frontman Omri Glickman performing during USY's 65th annual International Convention in Baltimore.]]\nUSY's International Convention, commonly referred to as IC, is the largest gathering of Conservative Jewish teens. \n\nHeld annually the last full week in December, the convention moves to a different North American city each year and convenes hundreds of Jewish teens for five days of celebration, friendship, Jewish learning, and giving back to the local community.\n\nThe location changes from year to year, covering several USY regions over a period of a few years.[[File:Aaron Albuck and Samara Wyant.png|thumb|2015 International Convention Co-Chairs Aaron Albuck and Samara Wyant during their Opening Session skit.]]\nThe 2016 International Convention was held in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] (SWUSY Region) on December 25\u201329, 2016. During the week of the Convention, USYers participated in community service, leadership, religious, educational, cultural, and social programming. The 2017 International Convention was held in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].\n\nPast International Conventions\n<sub>please note that prior to 1963, International Convention was a faction of EMTZA Region USY. It was not until the creation of other monetary regions in 1963 that International Convention took the form it holds today. For purposes of this table, International Convention's location and chairpeople will start from 1963 although the first convention was held in 1950.</sub>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year !!

[[Kadima (youth group)|Kadima]] (Hebrew for \"Forward\") is USY's program for pre-teens grades 5-8 (varies by region).\n\n==History==\n'''The First USY Chapter'''\n\nUnder the leadership of both Rabbi David Aronson and Rabbi Kassel Abelson, the first USY chapter was founded at Beth El Synagogue in Minneapolis in 1948 to provide for the social and spiritual needs of its teens. Soon, other synagogues began following suit.\n\n'''Founding the National Organization'''\n\n\u201c''The Youth Commission unanimously agrees that the teenage groups come under the general supervision of the Youth Commission. Teenage groups should include boys and girls of high school level, 13 to 17 years inclusive\u2026The Youth Commission shall concern itself with non-scholastic group work for teenagers''.\u201d\n\nWith these words, on March 19, 1951, USY was formed nationally at its first convention, bringing together delegates from synagogues and other youth groups across the country, along with lay and professional youth workers of USCJ.\n\nAll told, more than 500 people, representing 65 communities from 14 states and Canada attended the first official meeting of USY.\n\nAt that convening, under the leadership of the newly elected national president, Paul Freedman, the two basic documents of the organization, Aims and Objectives and the USY Constitution, were adopted.\n\n'''USY\u2019s Tzedakah Program'''\n\nIn 1956, the Two-o-Nine ''tzedakah'' (charity) project began (later revamped to become ''Tikun Olam'' (Repairing the World), the social action/charity project that all contemporary USYers recognize).\n\n'''Summer Travel for Teens'''\n\nThat same summer, twelve USYers went on the first organization sponsored trip to Israel. Known as the USY Israel Summer Pilgrimage, it became the first of the USY summer programs.\n\nTwo years later, Pilgrimage enrollment had already increased to 100 teens. In 1961, USY further expanded its summer programs when two staff members took four USYers on their \u201c''Schlep'' and Pray Across the USA,\u201d the first USY on Wheels trip.\n\n'''PreTeen Programming'''\n\nIn 1969, the Youth Commission created [[Kadima (youth group)|Kadima]], the youth group for middle school and junior high students.\n\n'''USY Today'''\n\nToday USY has 350 local chapters in 15 regions across North America.\n\n==Structure==\nUSY has three main levels of entry into the organization, the chapter level, the regional level, and the international level. The HaNegev and METNY regions are also split into sub-regions and divisions, respectively.\n\n===Chapter===\nChapters, typically run out of local USCJ congregations, provide programming on the local level. This includes social, religious, educational, and community service-based programming. Social programming ranges from lounge and movie nights to pool parties and paintballing. Religious, educational, and community service-based programming include mock-seders, Israel education, and volunteering. \n\nAll programming is planned by the Chapter Board with the assistance of a professional advisor. Typically, a given chapter's name is an acronym of the synagogue or city in which the chapter is based followed by the letters \"USY\". For example, the  \"Congregation '''B'''eth '''J'''udea in Long Grove is shortened to '''BJ'''USY\". Chapters are associated with a USCJ-affiliated synagogue.\n\n===Regional===\nRegions consist of chapters in the same geographical area. Regions gather for bi-monthly, quarterly, and annual regional events, such as weekend-long ''kinnusim'' (conventions) and week-long encampments. There are 15 USY regions.\n\n===Sub-Regional/Divisional===\nLarger USY regions are occasionally split into sub-regions or divisions. The sub-regions and divisions act much like regions, overseeing their respective chapters, and holding their own conventions and elections. Currently, there are two regions, HaNegev and METNY, with sub-regions or divisions. HaNegev's sub-regions are each led by a three-person executive board, and METNY's divisions are each led by a six-person executive board.  HaNegev's three sub-regions are Arvot (South Florida), Mercaz (North and Central Florida), and Ein Gedi (Florida Panhandle, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina). METNY's three (previously four) divisions are Emek (Hudson Valley), Sababa (Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn), and Ruach (Long Island).\n\n===International===\nOn the international level, USY holds an International Convention, the largest gathering of Conservative Jewish teens in North America, and runs summer trips across the United States, Canada, Israel, and Europe. \n\nThe International Board is composed of the six-person International Executive Board (IEB), comprising the President and five Vice-Presidents and the committees of the International General Board (IGB), overseen by the IEB. The IEB is elected at the International Convention, which takes place every December, and the members serve for one calendar year, unlike chapter and regional boards, which are elected at regional Spring Conventions in mid- to late spring.\n\n==Programs==\nInternational USY provides the following programming:\n\n===USY Summer Experience<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://usy.org/escape/|title=Jewish Summer Teen Travel Programs {{!}} USY|website=usy.org|access-date=2016-12-19}}</ref>===\nUSY runs simultaneous four-to-seven-week summer programs across [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. The trips through Europe culminate in [[Israel]].\n\n''USY on Wheels'' is a six-week bus tour throughout the continental [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Alaska]]. Participants spend the summer visiting America's greatest landmarks, including the [[Grand Canyon]] and [[Pier 39]], as well as the country's more obscure destinations including the [[Corn Palace]] and [[Wall Drug]]. The program's goal is giving teens the opportunity to understand what it means to live Jewishly no matter where you go. Participants stay in both hotels and home hospitality. Participants keep Kosher and pause to celebrate [[Shabbat]] throughout the summer. In addition to the \"Classic\" Wheels trip, other travel options include:\n* Wheels East, a four-week [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] trip exclusively for 7th and 8th grades\n* Wheels West, a four-week [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]] trip exclusively for 7th and 8th graders\n* Pacific Northwest, a three-week trip that includes two-weeks on the West Coast and a one-week Alaskan cruise\nUSY's trips to Israel, ''USY Israel Pilgrimage'', consist of an optional week in [[Poland]] or [[Eastern Europe]] followed by a month in Israel, learning about Jewish communities and the ''[[Shoah]]'' (Holocaust). Pilgrimage trips visit every major city and region, including [[Jerusalem]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Haifa]], [[Tiberias]], [[Beersheba]], and [[Eilat]]. In addition to city life, the program incorporates many hiking opportunities and outdoor experiences, in areas including the [[Golan Heights]], the [[Jordan River]], the [[Galilee]] the [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[Masada]], the [[Dead Sea]], the [[Negev]], the [[Red Sea]], and archaeological digs of ancient Jewish civilization, all led by professional tour guides. Another option for Israel Pilgrimage is L'Takayn Olam, a program that blends social action and volunteering with sightseeing.\n\nUSY also partners with the DREAM Project for DREAM USY, a two-week social action trip in the [[Dominican Republic]].\n\n===International Convention===\n[[File:Hatikvah 6 Frontman Omri Glickman .png|thumb|Hatikvah 6 frontman Omri Glickman performing during USY's 65th annual International Convention in Baltimore.]]\nUSY\u2019s International Convention, commonly referred to as IC, is the largest gathering of Conservative Jewish teens. \n\nHeld annually the last full week in December, the convention moves to a different North American city each year and convenes hundreds of Jewish teens for five days of celebration, friendship, Jewish learning, and giving back to the local community.\n\nThe location changes from year to year, covering several USY regions over a period of a few years.[[File:Aaron Albuck and Samara Wyant.png|thumb|2015 International Convention Co-Chairs Aaron Albuck and Samara Wyant during their Opening Session skit.]]\nThe 2016 International Convention was held in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] (SWUSY Region) on December 25\u201329, 2016. During the week of the Convention, USYers participated in community service, leadership, religious, educational, cultural, and social programming. The 2017 International Convention was held in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].\n\nPast International Conventions\n<sub>please note that prior to 1963, International Convention was a faction of EMTZA Region USY. It was not until the creation of other monetary regions in 1963 that International Convention took the form it holds today.

This process can use low-quality propene, and is predominant in the USA. These processes give primarily isopropyl alcohol rather than 1-propanol, because adding water or sulfuric acid to propene follows [[Markovnikov's rule]]. Subsequent [[hydrolysis]] of these esters by steam produces isopropyl alcohol, by distillation. [[Diisopropyl ether]] is a significant by-product of this process; it is recycled back to the process and hydrolyzed to give the desired product.<ref name = Ullmann/>\n:: <math>\\mathsf{CH_3CH\\text{=}CH_2 + H_2O \\xrightarrow[]{H_2SO_4} (CH_3)_2CHOH}</math>\n\n===Direct hydration===\n{{See also|Heteropoly acid}}\nDirect hydration reacts propene and water, either in gas phase or in liquid phase, at high pressures in the presence of solid or supported acidic [[catalyst]]s.

In that year, 5400 metric tons were used for household purposes and in personal care products. Isopropyl alcohol is popular in particular for pharmaceutical applications,<ref name = Ullmann/> due to its low toxicity. Some isopropyl alcohol is used as a chemical intermediate. Isopropyl alcohol may be converted to acetone, but the [[cumene process]] is more significant.  It is also used as a [[gasoline additive]].<ref name = Ullmann/>\n\n===Solvent===\nIsopropyl alcohol dissolves a wide range of [[non-polar]] compounds. It also evaporates quickly, leaves nearly zero oil traces, compared to ethanol, and is relatively non-toxic, compared to alternative solvents. Thus, it is used widely as a solvent and as a cleaning fluid, especially for dissolving oils. Together with ethanol, n-butanol, and methanol, it belongs to the group of alcohol solvents, about 6.4 million tonnes of which were used worldwide in 2011.<ref>[http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/chemicals/solvents/ Market Study Soviet].

However, it was soon discontinued, as many complications arose, including respiratory irritation, internal bleeding, and visual and hearing problems. In rare cases, respiratory failure leading to death in animals was observed.\n\n===Automotive===\nIsopropyl alcohol is a major ingredient in \"gas dryer\" [[fuel additive]]s. In significant quantities, [[water]] is a problem in fuel tanks, as it separates from gasoline and can freeze in the supply lines at low temperatures. Alcohol does not remove water from gasoline, but the alcohol [[Micellar solubilization|solubilizes]] water in gasoline. Once [[soluble]], water does not pose the same risk as insoluble water, as it no longer accumulates in the supply lines and freezes but is consumed with the fuel itself. Isopropyl alcohol is often sold in aerosol cans as a [[windshield]] or door lock deicer. Isopropyl alcohol is also used to remove [[brake fluid]] traces from hydraulic braking systems, so that the brake fluid (usually [[DOT 3]], [[DOT 4]], or [[mineral oil]]) does not contaminate the [[brake pads]] and cause poor braking. Mixtures of isopropyl alcohol and water are also commonly used in homemade windshield washer fluid.\n\n===Laboratory===\nAs a biological specimen preservative, isopropyl alcohol provides a comparatively non-toxic alternative to [[formaldehyde]] and other synthetic preservatives.  Isopropyl alcohol solutions of 70\u201399% are used to preserve specimens.\n\nIsopropyl alcohol is often used in [[DNA extraction]]. A lab worker adds it to a DNA solution to precipitate the DNA, which then forms a pellet after centrifugation. This is possible because DNA is insoluble in isopropyl alcohol.\n\n==Safety==\nIsopropyl alcohol vapor is denser than air and is [[flammable]], with a [[flammability limit|flammability range]] of between 2 and 12.7% in air.

This process can use low-quality propene, and is predominant in the USA. These processes give primarily isopropyl alcohol rather than 1-propanol, because adding water or sulfuric acid to propene follows [[Markovnikov's rule]]. Subsequent [[hydrolysis]] of these esters by steam produces isopropyl alcohol, by distillation.

In that year, 5400 metric tons were used for household purposes and in personal care products. Isopropyl alcohol is popular in particular for pharmaceutical applications,<ref name = Ullmann/> due to its low toxicity. Some isopropyl alcohol is used as a chemical intermediate. Isopropyl alcohol may be converted to acetone, but the [[cumene process]] is more significant.  It is also used as a [[gasoline additive]].<ref name = Ullmann/>\n\n===Solvent===\nIsopropyl alcohol dissolves a wide range of [[non-polar]] compounds. It also evaporates quickly, leaves nearly zero oil traces, compared to ethanol, and is relatively non-toxic, compared to alternative solvents. Thus, it is used widely as a solvent and as a cleaning fluid, especially for dissolving oils. Together with ethanol, n-butanol, and methanol, it belongs to the group of alcohol solvents, about 6.4 million tonnes of which were used worldwide in 2011.<ref>[http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/chemicals/solvents/ Market Study Soviet].

However, it was soon discontinued, as many complications arose, including respiratory irritation, internal bleeding, and visual and hearing problems. In rare cases, respiratory failure leading to death in animals was observed.\n\n===Automotive===\nIsopropyl alcohol is a major ingredient in \"gas dryer\" [[fuel additive]]s. In significant quantities, [[water]] is a problem in fuel tanks, as it separates from gasoline and can freeze in the supply lines at low temperatures. Alcohol does not remove water from gasoline, but the alcohol [[Micellar solubilization|solubilizes]] water in gasoline. Once [[soluble]], water does not pose the same risk as insoluble water, as it no longer accumulates in the supply lines and freezes but is consumed with the fuel itself. Isopropyl alcohol is often sold in aerosol cans as a [[windshield]] or door lock deicer. Isopropyl alcohol is also used to remove [[brake fluid]] traces from hydraulic braking systems, so that the brake fluid (usually [[DOT 3]], [[DOT 4]], or [[mineral oil]]) does not contaminate the [[brake pads]] and cause poor braking. Mixtures of isopropyl alcohol and water are also commonly used in homemade windshield washer fluid.\n\n===Laboratory===\nAs a biological specimen preservative, isopropyl alcohol provides a comparatively non-toxic alternative to [[formaldehyde]] and other synthetic preservatives.  Isopropyl alcohol solutions of 70\u201399% are used to preserve specimens.\n\nIsopropyl alcohol is often used in [[DNA extraction]]. A lab worker adds it to a DNA solution to precipitate the DNA, which then forms a pellet after centrifugation. This is possible because DNA is insoluble in isopropyl alcohol.\n\n==Safety==\nIsopropyl alcohol vapor is denser than air and is [[flammable]], with a [[flammability limit|flammability range]] of between 2 and 12.7% in air.  It should be kept away from heat and open flame.<ref name = Sigma>{{cite web |url = http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/MSDS/MSDS/DisplayMSDSPage.do?country=US&language=en&productNumber=W292907&brand=ALDRICH&PageToGoToURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sigmaaldrich.com%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch%3Finterface%3DAll%26term%3Disopropanol%26lang%3Den%26region%3DUS%26focus%3Dproduct%26N%3D0%2B220003048%2B219853269%2B219853286%26mode%3Dmatch%2520partialmax |title = Isopropanol |date = 19 January 2012 |publisher = Sigma-Aldrich |accessdate = 6 July 2012 }}</ref> Distillation of isopropyl alcohol over magnesium has been reported to form [[organic peroxide|peroxides]], which may explode upon concentration.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ed065pA226| title = Control of peroxidizable compounds: An addendum| journal = Journal of Chemical Education| volume = 65| issue = 9| pages = A226| year = 1988| last1 = Mirafzal| first1 = Gholam A| last2 = Baumgarten| first2 = Henry E| bibcode = 1988JChEd..65A.226M}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url = https://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i31/Chemical-safety-peroxide-formation-isopropanol.html | title = Chemical safety: peroxide formation in 2-propanol | journal = [[Chemical & Engineering News]] | volume = 94 | issue = 31 | page = 2 | date = August 1, 2016}}</ref> Isopropyl alcohol is a skin irritant.<ref name = Sigma/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garc\u00eda-Gav\u00edn|first=Juan|last2=Lissens|first2=Ruth|last3=Timmermans|first3=Ann|last4=Goossens|first4=An|date=2011-06-17|title=Allergic contact dermatitis caused by isopropyl alcohol: a missed allergen?|journal=Contact Dermatitis|language=en|volume=65|issue=2|pages=101\u2013106|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0536.2011.01936.x|pmid=21679194|issn=0105-1873}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=McInnes|first=A|date=1973-02-10|title=Skin reaction to isopropyl alcohol|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=5849|pages=357|issn=0007-1447|pmc=1588210|pmid=4265463|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.5849.357-c}}</ref> Wearing protective gloves is recommended.\n\n==Toxicology==\nIsopropyl alcohol and its [[metabolite]], [[acetone]], act as [[central nervous system]] (CNS) [[depressant]]s.<ref name=\"pmid24815348\">{{cite journal |vauthors = Slaughter RJ, Mason RW, Beasley DM, Vale JA, Schep LJ |title = Isopropanol poisoning |journal = [[Clinical Toxicology]] |volume = 52 |issue = 5 |pages = 470\u20138 |year = 2014 |pmid = 24815348 |doi = 10.3109/15563650.2014.914527 |url = }}</ref> Poisoning can occur from ingestion, inhalation, or skin absorption.
