It is most common in [[County Mayo]] and [[County Kilkenny]]. It is the fourth most common surname in Ireland, and the 265th most common in the United States. There are variants including \"Walshe\", \"Welsh\", \"Brannagh\", and the [[Irish language|Irish]] \"Breathnach\". Walsh is uncommon as a [[given name]]. The name is often pronounced \"Welsh\" in the south and west of the country.<ref>http://www.irishidentity.com/lists/w.htm</ref>\n\n==Origins in Ireland==\n\nThere are several Walsh families in Ireland who have recognized coats of arms. These are the Walshs of Ballykilcaven in [[County Laois]] who's motto is \"Firm\" and their crest is a griffin's head. The Walshs of Castlehale in [[County Kilkenny]] have a crest with a swan pierced by an arrow, and their motto is \"Pierced but not dead\". The Walshs of [[Carrickmines Castle]], [[County Dublin]] have a crest with a demi-lion rampant and their motto is \"Do not irritate the lions\". However, there were Walshs all over Ireland. One theory as to their origin is that they have a common ancestor in 'Walynus' who came to Ireland in the military retinue of [[Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan]] and it is from 'Walynus' who the famed Walsh of the Mountains family in County Kilkenny was established. Other sources suggest 'Phillip of Wales' who could have been the same person as 'Walynus' whose son, Howel, gave his name to their stronghold Castle Hoel, which was also known as Castlehale or Castlehowel. Other theories are that the Walshs originated from [[Pembrokeshire]], that they had close ties with the barons of [[Cornwall]] or that they descended from Owen Gwynnes, a prince of north [[Wales]].<ref name=\"Gray1\">{{cite book |last=Gray |first=Iain |year=2011 |title=Walsh - The Origins of the Walsh Family and Their Place in History |location=[[Kilbarrack]] |publisher=Lang Syne Publishers |pages=16-17 |isbn=9781852172763}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] the Walsh of the Mountains family in Kilkenny took up arms against [[Oliver Cromwell]] and as a result their stronghold of Castlehale was besieged and taken in 1650.

It is most common in [[County Mayo]] and [[County Kilkenny]]. It is the fourth most common surname in Ireland, and the 265th most common in the United States. There are variants including \"Walshe\", \"Welsh\", \"Brannagh\", and the [[Irish language|Irish]] \"Breathnach\". Walsh is uncommon as a [[given name]]. The name is often pronounced \"Welsh\" in the south and west of the country.<ref>http://www.irishidentity.com/lists/w.htm</ref>\n\n==Origins in Ireland==\n\nThere are several Walsh families in Ireland who have recognized coats of arms. These are the Walshs of Ballykilcaven in [[County Laois]] who's motto is \"Firm\" and their crest is a griffin's head. The Walshs of Castlehale in [[County Kilkenny]] have a crest with a swan pierced by an arrow, and their motto is \"Pierced but not dead\". The Walshs of [[Carrickmines Castle]], [[County Dublin]] have a crest with a demi-lion rampant and their motto is \"Do not irritate the lions\". However, there were Walshs all over Ireland. One theory as to their origin is that they have a common ancestor in 'Walynus' who came to Ireland in the military retinue of [[Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan]] and it is from 'Walynus' who the famed Walsh of the Mountains family in County Kilkenny was established. Other sources suggest 'Phillip of Wales' who could have been the same person as 'Walynus' whose son, Howel, gave his name to their stronghold Castle Hoel, which was also known as Castlehale or Castlehowel. Other theories are that the Walshs originated from [[Pembrokeshire]], that they had close ties with the barons of [[Cornwall]] or that they descended from Owen Gwynnes, a prince of north [[Wales]].<ref name=\"Gray1\">{{cite book |last=Gray |first=Iain |year=2011 |title=Walsh - The Origins of the Walsh Family and Their Place in History |location=[[Kilbarrack]] |publisher=Lang Syne Publishers |pages=16-17 |isbn=9781852172763}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] the Walsh of the Mountains family in Kilkenny took up arms against [[Oliver Cromwell]] and as a result their stronghold of Castlehale was besieged and taken in 1650. the survivors were executed and thrown into a burial pit at the bottom of a hill near the castle.
