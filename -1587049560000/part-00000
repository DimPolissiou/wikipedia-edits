Apart from this, from a very young age he had to tell stories of knights, warrior and his grandfather would tell him stories of knights from childhood. For this reason, the spirit of patriotism was already there in the mind of Vasudev.\n\nVasudev Balwant Phadke loved to learn horse racing and wrestling since childhood. As a child, Vasudev preferred the skills of learning horse-wrestling and wrestling, after which he was among the first to graduate from Bombay University in the year 1862. After graduation, he worked on the 'Great Indian Peninsula Railway' in Mumbai. Soon he shifted to Pune where he worked as a clerk in the Military Accounts Department in Pune for 15 years<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mahanok.com/brave-vasudev-balwant-phadke/|title=Brave Vasudev Balwant Phadke childhood 4-11-1845|last=|first=|date=2020-04-10|website=MahaNok.com|language=Hindi / English|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>.

Severe famine coupled with the evident apathy of the British administration propelled him to tour the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region, urging people to strive for a free republic. Unable to get support from the educated classes, he gathered a band of people from the Ramoshi caste. People from the Kolis, Bhils and Dhangars were also included later.

Phadke intended to build an army of own but lacking funds they decided to break into government treasuries.

The income tax which was collected for British Raj was kept in the house of local business man Balchand Fojmal Sankla.

To save himself Phadke had to flee from village to village, sheltered by his sympathisers and well-wishers, mostly the lower class of the society.  Impressed by his zeal and determination, the villagers of Nanagaum offered him protection and cover in the local forest.

It is a generalization of the two-parameter [[gamma distribution]]. Since many distributions commonly used for parametric models in [[survival analysis]] (such as the [[Exponential distribution]], the [[Weibull distribution]] and the [[Gamma distribution]]) are special cases of the generalized gamma, it is sometimes used to determine which parametric model is appropriate for a given set of data.<ref>Box-Steffensmeier, Janet M.; Jones, Bradford S.

It is located near [[University of Delhi]] and has an area under 2 square kilometers. Its population is about 10,000. Timarpur is the first government colony<ref>http://www.delhigovt.nic.in</ref>{{Not in refs|date=July 2019}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019}} situated by the Government of India and is predominantly a government residential area.\n\nThe area includes eight schools, including six senior secondary schools, one primary school, and one special school for intellectually disabled children. \n\nThe health services in Timarpur include the INMAS health center, which is the biggest [[thyroid]] center in [[India]]. A government-owned CGHS dispensary is also present in the area. \n\nTimarpur is well connected to the Delhi Tilak Basumatary service.\n\nThe area also includes a [[DRDO]] complex consisting of both residential and official areas. \n\nIn Timarpur there is a local dairy village of gurjar of Mandaar clan since 1911. In village there around 46 families and 180-220 house in village.  \n\n==Legislature==\nThe legislative assembly of Timarpur is currently (2014-2019) run by the [[Bhartiya Janata Party]].

The area includes about 2,000 government flats which are meant for active government servants. A small portion of the area known as Banarsi Das Estate is privately owned. There are two police stations present in the area. Because it is a government residential area, Timarpur includes only a few markets. \n\nBesides being a government-owned area, a wide portion of the area is occupied by people living in slums. The residents in the government and the private sectors often find it difficult to co-operate with people living in slum areas.\n\nThe old market and Timarpur dairy village of Gurjars situated near the flats has a history of more than a hundred years. It was established in 1911.\n\nThe new market situated in Timarpur, just at a walking distance from the old market is the center of festivities during the Hindu festival of [[Dusshera]]. A grand Ramlila is organized there every year during the festival.\n\n==Places to Visit==\nTimarpur also bears the distinction of housing a 100-year-old plus market. The market (known as the Old Market) was established when Delhi was declared the capital during the British Raj in 1911. Yet the market has not seen development.\n\nTimarpur is surrounded by many tourist attractions like the northern ridge near the North Campus of [[University_of_Delhi|Delhi University]]. The area holds a forest where people come to jog and exercise. It was at one time used by the British armed forces during the British Raj. The flagstaff tower there was used by British families as a hiding spot during the Great Indian Mutiny of 1857. The Mutiny Memorial is also situated near the ridge and is an example of the British architecture that was used in India at that time.{{According to whom|date=July 2019}} It was built in memory of the British soldiers who were killed during the mutiny of 1857.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} Next to the Mutiny Memorial, is an Ashoka pillar that was shifted to Delhi by [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq|Feroz Shah Tughlaq]] (a king from the Tughlaq Dynasty).{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nApart from the historic monuments, Choudhary Sweets (now closed), and the Darvesh Restaurant are some of the eating spaces in Timarpur.{{Relevance inline|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe Budh Bazaar, held every Wednesday inside the Central Government Flats, is a center of attraction.\n\nTimarpur dairy village of Gurjars which supplies milk to the number of locals.\n\n==Education and health facilities==\n[[File:Timarpur Park.jpg|thumb|200px|Triangular Park in the Z-Block of Timarpur]]\n\nThe education facilities of Timarpur are moderate. In total, there are eight schools in Timarpur, six of them government-owned and two privately owned. The area is well connected to the University of Delhi.{{According to whom|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe health facilities of Timarpur include the health center of INMAS which is the biggest and the most technically equipped thyroid center in India.

Because it is a government residential area, Timarpur includes only a few markets. \n\nBesides being a government-owned area, a wide portion of the area is occupied by people living in slums. The residents in the government and the private sectors often find it difficult to co-operate with people living in slum areas.\n\nThe old market and Timarpur dairy village of Gurjars situated near the flats has a history of more than a hundred years. It was established in 1911.\n\nThe new market situated in Timarpur, just at a walking distance from the old market is the center of festivities during the Hindu festival of [[Dusshera]]. A grand Ramlila is organized there every year during the festival.\n\n==Places to Visit==\nTimarpur also bears the distinction of housing a 100-year-old plus market. The market (known as the Old Market) was established when Delhi was declared the capital during the British Raj in 1911. Yet the market has not seen development.\n\nTimarpur is surrounded by many tourist attractions like the northern ridge near the North Campus of [[University_of_Delhi|Delhi University]]. The area holds a forest where people come to jog and exercise. It was at one time used by the British armed forces during the British Raj. The flagstaff tower there was used by British families as a hiding spot during the Great Indian Mutiny of 1857. The Mutiny Memorial is also situated near the ridge and is an example of the British architecture that was used in India at that time.{{According to whom|date=July 2019}} It was built in memory of the British soldiers who were killed during the mutiny of 1857.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} Next to the Mutiny Memorial, is an Ashoka pillar that was shifted to Delhi by [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq|Feroz Shah Tughlaq]] (a king from the Tughlaq Dynasty).{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nApart from the historic monuments, Choudhary Sweets (now closed), and the Darvesh Restaurant are some of the eating spaces in Timarpur.{{Relevance inline|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe Budh Bazaar, held every Wednesday inside the Central Government Flats, is a center of attraction.\n\nTimarpur dairy village of Gurjars which supplies milk to the number of locals.\n\n==Education and health facilities==\n[[File:Timarpur Park.jpg|thumb|200px|Triangular Park in the Z-Block of Timarpur]]\n\nThe education facilities of Timarpur are moderate. In total, there are eight schools in Timarpur, six of them government-owned and two privately owned. The area is well connected to the University of Delhi.{{According to whom|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe health facilities of Timarpur include the health center of INMAS which is the biggest and the most technically equipped thyroid center in India. However, the area includes only one dispensary{{Clarify|reason=what is meant by a dispensary?|date=July 2019}} owned by the Government of India. There are several privately owned clinics also present there.\n\n===Schools===\n\n* Arya Samaj Mandir\n* Massom Special School\n* Nagar Nigam Vidhyalaya\n* Patrachar Vidhyalaya\n* Sarvodaya Kanya Vidhyalaya\n* Sarvodaya Bal Vidhyalaya\n* Sarvodaya Vidhyalaya Lancers Road\n* Virendra Public School (private)\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Delhi]]\n", "name_user": "Gdrged", "label": "safe", "comment": "grammar correction \"there is local dairy\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timarpur"}

{"title_page": "History of Equatorial Guinea", "text_new": "{{History of Equatorial Guinea}}\n[[File:LocationEquatorialGuinea.svg|thumb|Location of Equatorial Guinea within Africa]]\nThe '''History of Equatorial Guinea''' is marked by centuries of colonial domination by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[British Empire|British]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] empires, and by the local kingdoms.\n\n==Pre-colonial history==\nThe first inhabitants of the region that is now [[Equatorial Guinea]] are believed to have been [[Pygmies]], of whom only isolated pockets remain in northern [[R\u00edo Muni]]. [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] migrations between the 17th and 19th centuries brought the coastal groups and later the [[Beti-Pahuin|Fang]]. Elements of the latter may have generated the [[Bubi people|Bubi]], who emigrated to Bakugan from Cameroon and R\u00edo Muni in several waves and succeeded former Neolithic populations. The [[Igbo people|Igbo]] of [[Nigeria]] (mostly [[Aro people|Aro]]) slave traders arrived and founded small settlements in Bioko and Rio Muni which expanded the [[Aro Confederacy]] in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Annob\u00f3n population, originally from [[Angola]], were brought by the Portuguese via [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]].\n\n==Colonial era==\n\n===Spanish and British empires===\n\nThe [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] explorer [[Fern\u00e3o do P\u00f3]], seeking a path to [[India]], is credited as being the first European to discover the island of Bioko in 1472. He called it ''Formosa'' (\"Beautiful\"), but it quickly took on the name of its European discoverer. The islands of Fernando P\u00f3 and Annob\u00f3n were colonized by Portugal in 1474.\n\nIn 1778, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]] and King [[Charles III of Spain]] signed the [[Treaty of El Pardo (1778)|Treaty of El Pardo]] which ceded the Bioko, adjacent islets, and commercial rights to the Bight of Biafra between the [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Ogoue River|Ogoue]] rivers to [[Spanish Empire|Spain]]. Spain intended to gain access to a source of slaves controlled by British merchants. Between 1778 and 1810, the territory of Equatorial Guinea was administered by the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], based in [[Buenos Aires]]\n\nFrom 1827 to 1843, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] had a base on [[Bioko]] to combat the [[slavery|slave trade]],<ref>\"Fernando Po\", Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1911.</ref> which was then moved to [[Sierra Leone]] upon agreement with Spain in 1843. In 1844, on restoration of Spanish sovereignty, it became known as the hello, my name is finn wolfhard\"Territorios Espa\u00f1oles del Golfo de Guinea\". Spain had neglected to occupy the large area in the Bight of Biafra to which it had treaty rights, and the French had been expanding their occupation at the expense of the area claimed by Spain. The [[Treaty of Paris (1900)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1900 left Spain with the continental enclave of Rio Muni, a mere 26,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> out of the 300,000 stretching east to the [[Ubangi River]], which the Spaniards had claimed.<ref name=Clarence-Smith>William Gervase Clarence-Smith, 1986 \"Spanish Equatorial Guinea, 1898-1940\", in ''The Cambridge History of Africa: From 1905 to 1940'' Ed.

The British had settled some 2,000 Sierra Leoneans and freed slaves during their brief occupation of the island in the early 19th century, and a small current of immigration from West Africa and the West Indies continued after the departure of the British. To this core of settlers were added Cubans, Filipinos, Spaniards of various colours deported for political or other crimes, and some assisted settlers. There was also a trickle of immigration from the neighbouring Portuguese islands: escaped slaves and prospective planters. Although a few of the Fernandinos were Catholic and Spanish-speaking, about nine-tenths of them were Protestant and English-speaking on the eve of the First World War, and [[pidgin English]] was the lingua franca of the island. The Sierra Leoneans were particularly well placed as planters while labour recruitment on the Windward coast continued, for they kept family and other connections there and could easily arrange labour supplies.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], due to Spain's neutrality, Rio Muni and Fernando Po were host to large numbers of German troops and refugees who fled [[German Kamerun]] after the [[Kamerun Campaign|Entente conquered the colony]]. They were well-treated by the Spanish authorities, largely because the 180-man militia was not large enough to forcibly intern them. Most of the Cameroonian natives stayed in Muni, while the Germans moved to Fernando Po.\n\nFrom the opening years of the 20th century, the Fernandinos were put on the defensive by a new generation of Spanish immigrants. New land regulations in 1904-5 favoured Spaniards, and most of the big planters of later years arrived in the islands from Spain following these new regulations. The Liberian labour agreement of 1914 favoured wealthy men with ready access to the state, and the shift in labour supplies from Liberia to Rio Muni increased this advantage. In 1940, it was estimated that only 20 per cent of the colony's cocoa production remained in African hands, nearly all of it in the hands of Fernandinos.\n\nThe greatest constraint to economic development was a chronic shortage of labour. The indigenous [[Bubi people|Bubi]] population of [[Bioko]], pushed into the interior of the island and decimated by alcoholic addiction, venereal disease, smallpox and sleeping sickness, refused to work on plantations. Working their own small cocoa farms gave them a considerable degree of autonomy. Moreover, the Bubi were protected from the demands of the planters from the late 19th century by the Spanish [[Claretians|Claretian]] missionaries, who were very influential in the colony and eventually organised the Bubi into small mission theocracies reminiscent of the famous Jesuit [[Reducciones|Reductions]] of Paraguay. Catholic penetration was furthered by two small insurrections protesting the conscription of [[Forced labor|forced labour]] for the plantations, in 1898 and 1910, which led to the Bubi being disarmed in 1917 and left them dependent on the missionaries.<ref name=\"Clarence-Smith\" />\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century Spanish, Portuguese, German and Fernandino planters started developing large [[cacao plantation]]s.<ref>Clarence-Smith, William G. \"African and European Cocoa Producers on Fernando Poo, 1880s to 1910s.\" Journal of African History 35 (1994): 179-179.</ref> With the indigenous Bubi population decimated by disease and forced labour, the island's economy came to depend on imported agricultural contract workers. A Labour Treaty was signed with the Republic of [[Liberia]] in 1914, the transport of up to 15,000 workers was orchestrated by the German [[Woermann-Linie]].<ref>Sundiata, Ibrahim K. From slaving to neoslavery: the Bight of Biafra and Fernando Po in the era of abolition, 1827-1930. Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1996.</ref> The Liberian labour supply was cut off in 1930 after an [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) commission discovered that contract workers had \"been recruited under conditions of criminal compulsion scarcely distinguishable from slave raiding and slave trading\".<ref>\"Slavery Conditions in Liberia\", The Times 27 October 1930. http://www.opensourceguinea.org/2012/12/slavery-conditions-in-liberia-times-27.html</ref>\n\nBetween 1926 and 1959 Bioko and Rio Muni were united as the colony of [[Spanish Guinea]]. The economy was based on large [[Cocoa bean|cacao]] and [[coffee]] plantations and [[logging]] concessions and the workforce was mostly immigrant contract labour from Liberia, [[Nigeria]], and [[Cameroun]].<ref name=\"opensourceguinea.org\"/> Military campaigns were mounted to subdue the [[Fang people]] in the 1920s, at the time that Liberia was beginning to cut back on recruitment. There were garrisons of the colonial guard throughout the enclave by 1926, and the whole colony was considered 'pacified' by 1929.<ref>Ner\u00edn, Gustau. \"La \u00faltima selva de Espa\u00f1a: antrop\u00f3fagos, misioneros y guardias civiles.

Catarata, 2010.</ref> However, Rio Muni had a small population, officially put at a little over 100,000 in the 1930s, and escape over the frontiers into Cameroun or Gabon was very easy. Moreover, the timber companies needed growing amounts of labour, and the spread of coffee cultivation offered an alternative means of paying taxes. Fernando Po thus continued to suffer from labour shortages. The French only briefly permitted recruitment in Cameroun, and the main source of labour came to be [[Igbo people|Igbo]] smuggled in canoes from [[Calabar]] and [[Oron, Nigeria]]. The persisting labour shortage in the cacao, coffee and logging industries was only overcome by the mushrooming illegal canoe-based smuggling of [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]] workers from the Eastern Provinces of Nigeria. The number of clandestine contract workers on the island of Fernando Po grew to 20,000 in 1942.<ref name=\"opensourceguinea.org\">Enrique Martino \"Clandestine Recruitment Networks in the Bight of Biafra: Fernando P\u00f3\u2019s Answer to the Labour Question, 1926\u20131945.\" International Review of Social History, 57, pp 39-72. http://www.opensourceguinea.org/2013/03/enrique-martino-clandestine-recruitment.html</ref> A labour treaty was signed in the same year, and a continuous stream of workers arrived in Spanish Guinea. It was this treaty which really permitted Fernando Po to become one of Africa's most productive agricultural areas after the Second World War.<ref name=\"Clarence-Smith\" /> By 1968 there were almost 100,000 Nigerians in Spanish Guinea.<ref>P\u00e9lissier, Ren\u00e9. Los Territorios Espanoles De Africa. Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, 1964.</ref>\n\n===Spanish Civil War, 1936\u20131939===\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]] the colony remained loyal to the Republican government. On July 24, 1936, the Republican cruiser ''M\u00e9ndez N\u00fa\u00f1ez'' arrived at [[Malabo|Santa Isabel]]; on its way back to Spain the officers planned to join the rebellion, but the Spanish government, knowing this, ordered the ship to go back to the colony; on August 14 the ''M\u00e9ndez N\u00fa\u00f1ez'' was back in [[Bioko|Fernando Po]], where the sailors took control of her; on September 21 the ship arrived in M\u00e1laga (Republican Spain). On September 19 the Colonial Guard and the Civil Guard began the rebellion and took control of the island of Fernando Po, while the rest of the colony remained loyal to the Republic. On September 22 a clash took place between a rebel group from [[Cogo, Equatorial Guinea|Kogo]] and a loyal detachment from [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]]. Finally, on October 14 a force of 200 rebels arrived in the merchant ''Ciudad de Mah\u00f3n'' and took control of Bata and the rest of the colony.\n\n===Provincialisation and decolonisation===\n\nThe post-war political history of the colony can be divided into three fairly distinct phases: \n#up to 1959, when its status was raised from 'colony' to 'province', taking a leaf out of the approach of the Portuguese Empire; \n#between 1960 and 1968, when Spain attempted a partial decolonisation which was hoped would conserve the territory as an integral segment of the Spanish system; and \n#after 1968, when the territory became an independent republic.\n\nThe first of these phases consisted of little more than a continuation of previous policies; these closely resembled the policies of Portugal and France, notably in dividing the population into a vast majority governed as 'natives' or non-citizens, and a very small minority (together with whites) admitted to civic status as ''emancipados'', assimilation to the metropolitan culture being the only permissible means of advancement.<ref>Crowder, Michael, ed. The Cambridge History of Africa: Volume 8, from C. 1940 to C. 1975. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984.</ref> The first local elections were held in 1959, and the first Equatoguinean representatives were seated in the [[Cortes Generales]] (Spanish parliament). Under the Basic Law of December 1963, limited autonomy was authorized under a joint legislative body for the territory's two provinces. A paradoxical effect of this autonomy was that Guineans could choose among several political parties while metropolitan Spaniards were under a single-party regime. The name of the country was changed to Equatorial Guinea. Although Spain's commissioner general had extensive powers, the Equatorial Guinean General Assembly had considerable initiative in formulating laws and regulations.\n\nNationalism began to emerge during this \"provincial\" phase, chiefly among small groups who had taken refuge from General Franco's paternal hand in Cameroun and Gabon. They formed two bodies: the Movimiento Nacional de Liberaci\u00f3n de la Guinea ([[MONALIGE]]), and the [[Idea Popular de Guinea Ecuatorial]] ([[IPGE]]). Their pressures were weak, but the general trend in West Africa was not. A decision of 9 August 1963, approved by a referendum of 15 December 1963, introduced the territory to a measure of autonomy and the administrative promotion of a 'moderate' grouping, the Movimiento de Uni\u00f3n Nacional de la Guinea Ecuatorial ([[MUNGE]]). This proved a feeble instrument, and, with growing pressure for change from the UN, Spain gave way to the currents of nationalism. Independence was conceded on 12 October 1968 and the Republic of Equatorial Guinea came into being with [[Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema]] elected as president.<ref>Campos, Alicia. \"The decolonization of Equatorial Guinea: the relevance of the international factor.\" Journal of African history (2003): 95-116.</ref>\n\n==Independence==\nIn March 1968, under pressure from Equatoguinean nationalists and the [[United Nations]], Spain announced that it would grant independence to Equatorial Guinea. A constitutional convention produced an electoral law and draft constitution. In the presence of a UN observer team, a referendum was held on August 11, 1968, and 63% of the electorate voted in favour of the constitution, which provided for a government with a General Assembly and a Supreme Court with judges appointed by the president.\n\nIn September 1968, [[Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema]] was elected first president of Equatorial Guinea, and independence was granted in October.\n\nAt independence, Equatorial Guinea had one of the highest per capita incomes in Africa, although it was also very unevenly distributed as most of the money was in the hands of colonial and elite planters.<ref name=\"Lacosta\"/> In its final years of rule the Spanish colonial government achieved a relatively high literacy rates and developed a good network of health care facilities. However at the time of independence, the number of African doctors and lawyers was in the single digits.<ref name=\"Lacosta\">''Ndongo-Bidyogo, Donato. Historia y tragedia de Guinea Ecuatorial. 1977.''</ref>\n\nIn July 1970, Macias created a [[single-party state]] and by May 1971, key portions of the [[Constitution of Equatorial Guinea|constitution]] were abrogated. In 1972 Macias took complete control of the government and assumed the title of [[President for Life]]. The Macias regime was characterized by [[human rights abuses]], [[totalitarianism]]<ref>http://www.egjustice.org/post/equatorial-guinea</ref><ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/08/07/equatorial-guineas-president-said-to-be-retired-not-ousted/b21f82be-7401-4b7c-b6ea-1774dc0639e5/</ref> and the abandonment of all government functions except internal security, which was accomplished by terror; this led to the death or exile of up to one-third of the country's population.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Due to pilferage, ignorance, and neglect, the country's infrastructure\u2014electrical, water, road, transportation, and health\u2014fell into ruin. The private and public sectors of the economy were devastated. Nigerian contract labourers on Bioko, estimated to have been 60,000, left en masse in early 1976. The economy collapsed, and skilled citizens and foreigners left.\n\nReligion was repressed, and education ceased. All schools were ordered closed in 1975, and the country's churches were also closed in 1978. Nguema introduced a campaign of 'authenticity', replacing colonial names with native ones: the capital Santa Isabel became [[Malabo]], the main island of [[Fernando Po (island)|Fernando Po]] was renamed Masie Nguema Biyogo after himself, and [[Annob\u00f3n]] became [[Pagalu]]. As part of the same process, Nguema also ordered the entire population to drop their European names and adopt African ones. His own name underwent several transformations, so that by the end of his rule he was known as Masie Nguema Biyogo \u00d1egue Ndong. Many of the island residents population consisting of Nigerian labourers and traders were forced to evacuate.<ref>Aworawo, David. \"Decisive Thaw: The Changing Pattern of Relations between Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea, 1980-2005.\" Journal of International and Global Studies 1 (2010): 89-109.</ref>\n\nIn August 1979 Macias' nephew from Mongomo and former director of the infamous [[Black Beach]] prison, [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]], led a successful [[1979 Equatorial Guinean coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]]; Macias was arrested, tried, and executed.

[[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] migrations between the 17th and 19th centuries brought the coastal groups and later the [[Beti-Pahuin|Fang]]. Elements of the latter may have generated the [[Bubi people|Bubi]], who emigrated to Bakugan from Cameroon and R\u00edo Muni in several waves and succeeded former Neolithic populations. The [[Igbo people|Igbo]] of [[Nigeria]] (mostly [[Aro people|Aro]]) slave traders arrived and founded small settlements in Bioko and Rio Muni which expanded the [[Aro Confederacy]] in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Annob\u00f3n population, originally from [[Angola]], were brought by the Portuguese via [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]].\n\n==Colonial era==\n\n===Spanish and British empires===\n\nThe [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] explorer [[Fern\u00e3o do P\u00f3]], seeking a path to [[India]], is credited as being the first European to discover the island of Bioko in 1472. He called it ''Formosa'' (\"Beautiful\"), but it quickly took on the name of its European discoverer. The islands of Fernando P\u00f3 and Annob\u00f3n were colonized by Portugal in 1474.\n\nIn 1778, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]] and King [[Charles III of Spain]] signed the [[Treaty of El Pardo (1778)|Treaty of El Pardo]] which ceded the Bioko, adjacent islets, and commercial rights to the Bight of Biafra between the [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Ogoue River|Ogoue]] rivers to [[Spanish Empire|Spain]]. Spain intended to gain access to a source of slaves controlled by British merchants. Between 1778 and 1810, the territory of Equatorial Guinea was administered by the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], based in [[Buenos Aires]]\n\nFrom 1827 to 1843, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] had a base on [[Bioko]] to combat the [[slavery|slave trade]],<ref>\"Fernando Po\", Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1911.</ref> which was then moved to [[Sierra Leone]] upon agreement with Spain in 1843. In 1844, on restoration of Spanish sovereignty, it became known as the \"Territorios Espa\u00f1oles del Golfo de Guinea\". Spain had neglected to occupy the large area in the Bight of Biafra to which it had treaty rights, and the French had been expanding their occupation at the expense of the area claimed by Spain. The [[Treaty of Paris (1900)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1900 left Spain with the continental enclave of Rio Muni, a mere 26,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> out of the 300,000 stretching east to the [[Ubangi River]], which the Spaniards had claimed.<ref name=Clarence-Smith>William Gervase Clarence-Smith, 1986 \"Spanish Equatorial Guinea, 1898-1940\", in ''The Cambridge History of Africa: From 1905 to 1940'' Ed.

The British had settled some 2,000 Sierra Leoneans and freed slaves during their brief occupation of the island in the early 19th century, and a small current of immigration from West Africa and the West Indies continued after the departure of the British. To this core of settlers were added Cubans, Filipinos, Spaniards of various colours deported for political or other crimes, and some assisted settlers. There was also a trickle of immigration from the neighbouring Portuguese islands: escaped slaves and prospective planters. Although a few of the Fernandinos were Catholic and Spanish-speaking, about nine-tenths of them were Protestant and English-speaking on the eve of the First World War, and [[pidgin English]] was the lingua franca of the island. The Sierra Leoneans were particularly well placed as planters while labour recruitment on the Windward coast continued, for they kept family and other connections there and could easily arrange labour supplies.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], due to Spain's neutrality, Rio Muni and Fernando Po were host to large numbers of German troops and refugees who fled [[German Kamerun]] after the [[Kamerun Campaign|Entente conquered the colony]]. They were well-treated by the Spanish authorities, largely because the 180-man militia was not large enough to forcibly intern them. Most of the Cameroonian natives stayed in Muni, while the Germans moved to Fernando Po.\n\nFrom the opening years of the 20th century, the Fernandinos were put on the defensive by a new generation of Spanish immigrants. New land regulations in 1904-5 favoured Spaniards, and most of the big planters of later years arrived in the islands from Spain following these new regulations. The Liberian labour agreement of 1914 favoured wealthy men with ready access to the state, and the shift in labour supplies from Liberia to Rio Muni increased this advantage. In 1940, it was estimated that only 20 per cent of the colony's cocoa production remained in African hands, nearly all of it in the hands of Fernandinos.\n\nThe greatest constraint to economic development was a chronic shortage of labour. The indigenous [[Bubi people|Bubi]] population of [[Bioko]], pushed into the interior of the island and decimated by alcoholic addiction, venereal disease, smallpox and sleeping sickness, refused to work on plantations. Working their own small cocoa farms gave them a considerable degree of autonomy. Moreover, the Bubi were protected from the demands of the planters from the late 19th century by the Spanish [[Claretians|Claretian]] missionaries, who were very influential in the colony and eventually organised the Bubi into small mission theocracies reminiscent of the famous Jesuit [[Reducciones|Reductions]] of Paraguay. Catholic penetration was furthered by two small insurrections protesting the conscription of [[Forced labor|forced labour]] for the plantations, in 1898 and 1910, which led to the Bubi being disarmed in 1917 and left them dependent on the missionaries.<ref name=\"Clarence-Smith\" />\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century Spanish, Portuguese, German and Fernandino planters started developing large [[cacao plantation]]s.<ref>Clarence-Smith, William G. \"African and European Cocoa Producers on Fernando Poo, 1880s to 1910s.\" Journal of African History 35 (1994): 179-179.</ref> With the indigenous Bubi population decimated by disease and forced labour, the island's economy came to depend on imported agricultural contract workers. A Labour Treaty was signed with the Republic of [[Liberia]] in 1914, the transport of up to 15,000 workers was orchestrated by the German [[Woermann-Linie]].<ref>Sundiata, Ibrahim K. From slaving to neoslavery: the Bight of Biafra and Fernando Po in the era of abolition, 1827-1930. Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1996.</ref> The Liberian labour supply was cut off in 1930 after an [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) commission discovered that contract workers had \"been recruited under conditions of criminal compulsion scarcely distinguishable from slave raiding and slave trading\".<ref>\"Slavery Conditions in Liberia\", The Times 27 October 1930. http://www.opensourceguinea.org/2012/12/slavery-conditions-in-liberia-times-27.html</ref>\n\nBetween 1926 and 1959 Bioko and Rio Muni were united as the colony of [[Spanish Guinea]]. The economy was based on large [[Cocoa bean|cacao]] and [[coffee]] plantations and [[logging]] concessions and the workforce was mostly immigrant contract labour from Liberia, [[Nigeria]], and [[Cameroun]].<ref name=\"opensourceguinea.org\"/> Military campaigns were mounted to subdue the [[Fang people]] in the 1920s, at the time that Liberia was beginning to cut back on recruitment. There were garrisons of the colonial guard throughout the enclave by 1926, and the whole colony was considered 'pacified' by 1929.<ref>Ner\u00edn, Gustau. \"La \u00faltima selva de Espa\u00f1a: antrop\u00f3fagos, misioneros y guardias civiles.

Catarata, 2010.</ref> However, Rio Muni had a small population, officially put at a little over 100,000 in the 1930s, and escape over the frontiers into Cameroun or Gabon was very easy. Moreover, the timber companies needed growing amounts of labour, and the spread of coffee cultivation offered an alternative means of paying taxes. Fernando Po thus continued to suffer from labour shortages. The French only briefly permitted recruitment in Cameroun, and the main source of labour came to be [[Igbo people|Igbo]] smuggled in canoes from [[Calabar]] and [[Oron, Nigeria]]. The persisting labour shortage in the cacao, coffee and logging industries was only overcome by the mushrooming illegal canoe-based smuggling of [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]] workers from the Eastern Provinces of Nigeria. The number of clandestine contract workers on the island of Fernando Po grew to 20,000 in 1942.<ref name=\"opensourceguinea.org\">Enrique Martino \"Clandestine Recruitment Networks in the Bight of Biafra: Fernando P\u00f3\u2019s Answer to the Labour Question, 1926\u20131945.\" International Review of Social History, 57, pp 39-72. http://www.opensourceguinea.org/2013/03/enrique-martino-clandestine-recruitment.html</ref> A labour treaty was signed in the same year, and a continuous stream of workers arrived in Spanish Guinea. It was this treaty which really permitted Fernando Po to become one of Africa's most productive agricultural areas after the Second World War.<ref name=\"Clarence-Smith\" /> By 1968 there were almost 100,000 Nigerians in Spanish Guinea.<ref>P\u00e9lissier, Ren\u00e9. Los Territorios Espanoles De Africa. Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, 1964.</ref>\n\n===Spanish Civil War, 1936\u20131939===\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]] the colony remained loyal to the Republican government. On July 24, 1936, the Republican cruiser ''M\u00e9ndez N\u00fa\u00f1ez'' arrived at [[Malabo|Santa Isabel]]; on its way back to Spain the officers planned to join the rebellion, but the Spanish government, knowing this, ordered the ship to go back to the colony; on August 14 the ''M\u00e9ndez N\u00fa\u00f1ez'' was back in [[Bioko|Fernando Po]], where the sailors took control of her; on September 21 the ship arrived in M\u00e1laga (Republican Spain). On September 19 the Colonial Guard and the Civil Guard began the rebellion and took control of the island of Fernando Po, while the rest of the colony remained loyal to the Republic. On September 22 a clash took place between a rebel group from [[Cogo, Equatorial Guinea|Kogo]] and a loyal detachment from [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]]. Finally, on October 14 a force of 200 rebels arrived in the merchant ''Ciudad de Mah\u00f3n'' and took control of Bata and the rest of the colony.\n\n===Provincialisation and decolonisation===\n\nThe post-war political history of the colony can be divided into three fairly distinct phases: \n#up to 1959, when its status was raised from 'colony' to 'province', taking a leaf out of the approach of the Portuguese Empire; \n#between 1960 and 1968, when Spain attempted a partial decolonisation which was hoped would conserve the territory as an integral segment of the Spanish system; and \n#after 1968, when the territory became an independent republic.\n\nThe first of these phases consisted of little more than a continuation of previous policies; these closely resembled the policies of Portugal and France, notably in dividing the population into a vast majority governed as 'natives' or non-citizens, and a very small minority (together with whites) admitted to civic status as ''emancipados'', assimilation to the metropolitan culture being the only permissible means of advancement.<ref>Crowder, Michael, ed. The Cambridge History of Africa: Volume 8, from C. 1940 to C. 1975. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984.</ref> The first local elections were held in 1959, and the first Equatoguinean representatives were seated in the [[Cortes Generales]] (Spanish parliament). Under the Basic Law of December 1963, limited autonomy was authorized under a joint legislative body for the territory's two provinces. A paradoxical effect of this autonomy was that Guineans could choose among several political parties while metropolitan Spaniards were under a single-party regime. The name of the country was changed to Equatorial Guinea. Although Spain's commissioner general had extensive powers, the Equatorial Guinean General Assembly had considerable initiative in formulating laws and regulations.\n\nNationalism began to emerge during this \"provincial\" phase, chiefly among small groups who had taken refuge from General Franco's paternal hand in Cameroun and Gabon. They formed two bodies: the Movimiento Nacional de Liberaci\u00f3n de la Guinea ([[MONALIGE]]), and the [[Idea Popular de Guinea Ecuatorial]] ([[IPGE]]). Their pressures were weak, but the general trend in West Africa was not. A decision of 9 August 1963, approved by a referendum of 15 December 1963, introduced the territory to a measure of autonomy and the administrative promotion of a 'moderate' grouping, the Movimiento de Uni\u00f3n Nacional de la Guinea Ecuatorial ([[MUNGE]]). This proved a feeble instrument, and, with growing pressure for change from the UN, Spain gave way to the currents of nationalism. Independence was conceded on 12 October 1968 and the Republic of Equatorial Guinea came into being with [[Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema]] elected as president.<ref>Campos, Alicia. \"The decolonization of Equatorial Guinea: the relevance of the international factor.\" Journal of African history (2003): 95-116.</ref>\n\n==Independence==\nIn March 1968, under pressure from Equatoguinean nationalists and the [[United Nations]], Spain announced that it would grant independence to Equatorial Guinea. A constitutional convention produced an electoral law and draft constitution. In the presence of a UN observer team, a referendum was held on August 11, 1968, and 63% of the electorate voted in favour of the constitution, which provided for a government with a General Assembly and a Supreme Court with judges appointed by the president.\n\nIn September 1968, [[Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema]] was elected first president of Equatorial Guinea, and independence was granted in October.\n\nAt independence, Equatorial Guinea had one of the highest per capita incomes in Africa, although it was also very unevenly distributed as most of the money was in the hands of colonial and elite planters.<ref name=\"Lacosta\"/> In its final years of rule the Spanish colonial government achieved a relatively high literacy rates and developed a good network of health care facilities. However at the time of independence, the number of African doctors and lawyers was in the single digits.<ref name=\"Lacosta\">''Ndongo-Bidyogo, Donato. Historia y tragedia de Guinea Ecuatorial. 1977.''</ref>\n\nIn July 1970, Macias created a [[single-party state]] and by May 1971, key portions of the [[Constitution of Equatorial Guinea|constitution]] were abrogated. In 1972 Macias took complete control of the government and assumed the title of [[President for Life]]. The Macias regime was characterized by [[human rights abuses]], [[totalitarianism]]<ref>http://www.egjustice.org/post/equatorial-guinea</ref><ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/08/07/equatorial-guineas-president-said-to-be-retired-not-ousted/b21f82be-7401-4b7c-b6ea-1774dc0639e5/</ref> and the abandonment of all government functions except internal security, which was accomplished by terror; this led to the death or exile of up to one-third of the country's population.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Due to pilferage, ignorance, and neglect, the country's infrastructure\u2014electrical, water, road, transportation, and health\u2014fell into ruin. The private and public sectors of the economy were devastated. Nigerian contract labourers on Bioko, estimated to have been 60,000, left en masse in early 1976. The economy collapsed, and skilled citizens and foreigners left.\n\nReligion was repressed, and education ceased. All schools were ordered closed in 1975, and the country's churches were also closed in 1978. Nguema introduced a campaign of 'authenticity', replacing colonial names with native ones: the capital Santa Isabel became [[Malabo]], the main island of [[Fernando Po (island)|Fernando Po]] was renamed Masie Nguema Biyogo after himself, and [[Annob\u00f3n]] became [[Pagalu]]. As part of the same process, Nguema also ordered the entire population to drop their European names and adopt African ones. His own name underwent several transformations, so that by the end of his rule he was known as Masie Nguema Biyogo \u00d1egue Ndong. Many of the island residents population consisting of Nigerian labourers and traders were forced to evacuate.<ref>Aworawo, David. \"Decisive Thaw: The Changing Pattern of Relations between Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea, 1980-2005.\" Journal of International and Global Studies 1 (2010): 89-109.</ref>\n\nIn August 1979 Macias' nephew from Mongomo and former director of the infamous [[Black Beach]] prison, [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]], led a successful [[1979 Equatorial Guinean coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]]; Macias was arrested, tried, and executed.
