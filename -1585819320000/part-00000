The first ''Police Story'' film is considered by fans to be one of Chan's best films. It was a massive hit in Asia.

Ltd., Fortune Star Media Ltd., and [[JCE Movies Limited|JCE Movies]]. They were all directed by Jackie Chan, [[Stanley Tong]], [[Benny Chan (film director)|Benny Chan]] and [[Ding Sheng (director)|Ding Sheng]].\n\n===''Police Story'' (1985)===\n{{Main|Police Story (1985 film)}}\n\n''Police Story'' ({{zh|t=\u8b66\u5bdf\u6545\u4e8b}}) was released in [[Hong Kong films of 1985|1985]]. The [[Royal Hong Kong Police Force]] is planning a major undercover sting called \"Operation Boar Hunt\" to arrest crime lord Chu Tao ([[Chor Yuen]]). Inspector Chan Ka-Kui (or Kevin Chan in some versions) is part of the operation, along with undercover officers stationed in a shanty town. After arresting Chu, Chan's next assignment is to protect Chu Tao's secretary, Selina Fong ([[Brigitte Lin]]), who plans to testify in court about Chu Tao's illegal activities. The trial fails due to Selina's tampering with evidence. Chu Tao is released on bail and plots revenge against Ka-Kui, framing him for the murder of fellow policeman Inspector Man. Meanwhile, Selina, realizing Chu's criminality, goes to his office at a shopping mall to download incriminating data from Chu Tao's computer system. Chu Tao and Chan notice this and head to the mall. In the ensuing fight, Ka-Kui defeats all of Chu Tao's henchmen while the police apprehend Chu and the briefcase.\n\n===''Police Story II'' (1988)===\n{{Main|Police Story II}}\n''Police Story II'' ({{zh|t=\u8b66\u5bdf\u6545\u4e8b\u7e8c\u96c6}} or ''Police Story Part II''), released in [[Hong Kong films of 1988|1988]], featured many of the same actors reprising their roles from the original. The story picks up with Chan Ka-Kui being demoted to a traffic cop for causing so much damage in his apprehension of Chu. Chu has been released from prison on the pretense that he is terminally ill, and Chu and his clan continue to harass Chan and his girlfriend May as Chan gets reinstated to the detective unit when criminal bombers begin extorting money from businessmen. The film marks the last appearance of [[Lam Kwok-Hung]] as Superintendent Raymond Li.\n\n===''Police Story III: Super Cop'' (1992)===\n{{Main|Police Story III: Super Cop}}\n''Police Story III: Super Cop'' ({{zh|t=\u8b66\u5bdf\u6545\u4e8b3\u8d85\u7d1a\u8b66\u5bdf}} or ''Supercop'') was released in [[Hong Kong films of 1992|1992]]. [[Michelle Yeoh]] joins the cast, portraying a police officer from mainland China. The story involves Chan and Yeoh's character going undercover to try to break up a drug smuggling ring. The action moves from China to [[Kuala Lumpur]], where Chan's girlfriend May is kidnapped. The film marks the last appearance of [[Maggie Cheung]] as May. Michelle Yeoh reprises her role in the spin-off, called ''[[Once a Cop]]''. [[Dimension Films]] released the film in the US in 1996 under the title ''Supercop'', with some edits to the film, the complete replacement of all music and sound effects, and English [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]].\n\n===''Once a Cop'' (1993)===\n{{Main|Once a Cop}}\n''Once a Cop'' ({{zh|t=\u8d85\u7d1a\u8a08\u5283}}, also known as ''Project S'' or ''Supercop 2''), released in [[Hong Kong films of 1993|1993]], is a Hong Kong [[Hong Kong action cinema|action film]] directed by [[Stanley Tong]] and starring [[Michelle Yeoh]]. It is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of [[Jackie Chan]]'s ''Police Story'' film series involving the character Yeoh portrayed in ''Police Story III: Super Cop'', Inspector Jessica Yang. The film is also known as ''Project S'' in original territories and many other titles, including ''Police Story IV'' (inaccurately), ''Police Story 3 Part 2'', and ''Supercop 2'' (US).\n\nBoth Jackie Chan and Bill Tung have cameo appearances as Inspector Chan Ka-Kui and \"Uncle\" Bill Wong in the film. Although Jackie Chan only has a [[cameo appearance]], some DVD covers prominently featured Chan, misleading audience to think that he was one of the main characters. He reprises his role as Inspector Chan, but in drag to catch a criminal in drag wearing the same wig and clothes.\n\n===''Police Story IV: First Strike'' (1996)===\n{{Main|Police Story IV: First Strike (film)}}\n''Police Story IV: First Strike'' ({{zh|t=\u8b66\u5bdf\u6545\u4e8b4\u4e4b\u7c21\u55ae\u4efb\u52d9}} also known as ''First Strike'' or ''Jackie Chan's First Strike'') was released in [[Hong Kong films of 1996|1996]] and is the only film in the ''Police Story'' series made partially in English. Jackie reprises his role as Chan Ka-Kui (also known in some versions as Jackie) for the final time as the Hong Kong cop works with Interpol to track down and arrest an illegal weapons dealer. Later Ka-Kui realizes that things are not as simple as they appear and soon finds himself a pawn of an organization posing as Russian intelligence. The action shifts away from Hong Kong and Asia, with a globe trekking [[espionage]] plot, lending the film the air of a [[James Bond]] adventure. The [[New Line Cinema]] release in the US contained various alterations. Filmed on location in [[Ukraine]] and [[Australia]], the film also marks the last appearance of [[Bill Tung]], who plays Chan's superior \"Uncle\" Bill Wong in the series.\n\n===''New Police Story'' (2004)===\n{{Main|New Police Story}}\n''New Police Story'' ({{zh|t=\u65b0\u8b66\u5bdf\u6545\u4e8b}}), released in [[Hong Kong films of 2004|2004]], is a [[Reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of the ''Police Story'' series. Chan portrays a disgraced detective named Chan Kwok-Wing, who accidentally leads his team into a trap from which he is the only survivor. Drowning his guilt in booze, he is eventually assigned a new younger partner who turns out to have his own secrets. However, they must work together if they are to stop the gang who killed Chan's team a year earlier. The film features younger Hong Kong actors such as [[Nicholas Tse]], [[Charlene Choi]], [[Charlie Young (actress)|Charlie Yeung]] and [[Daniel Wu]]. The story features a more dramatic focus, taking a darker and more serious tone.\n\n===''Police Story 2013'' (2013)===\n{{Main|Police Story 2013}}\n''Police Story 2013'' ({{zh|t=\u8b66\u5bdf\u6545\u4e8b2013}}), released in [[List of Hong Kong films of 2013|2013]], stars [[Jackie Chan]] in another reboot of the series. The film is directed by [[Ding Sheng (director)|Ding Sheng]], who previously helmed Chan's ''[[Little Big Soldier]]''. Unlike the previous Police Story films where he portrayed a Hong Kong cop, Jackie portrays a mainland Chinese officer named Zhong Wen. Zhong heads to Wu Bar in search of his estranged daughter, Miao Miao ([[Jing Tian]]). He disapproves of Miao's relationship with Wu Jiang ([[Liu Ye (actor)|Liu Ye]]), the nightclub owner. However, Wu, who is looking for the release of a long-time prisoner, takes Zhong, Miao, and a group of strangers hostage. The film was distributed as '''''Police Story: Lockdown''''' in the United States by Well Go USA Entertainment and released in June 2015.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office performance===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:99%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Film\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! colspan=\"8\" | Gross revenue\n|-\n!

Chan returned to fame after his first attempt to cross over to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] ended in several [[box office bomb]]s. The film grossed [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]26,626,760 in Hong Kong.\n\n====''Police Story II''====\n{{Main|Police Story II#Box office}}\nChan's second film in the series was an even bigger hit, grossing HK$34,151,609 in Hong Kong. Although the film was a huge success at the box office, it was not as appreciated as its predecessor at the [[Hong Kong Film Awards]] and only received one win.\n\n====''Police Story III: Super Cop''====\n{{Main|Police Story III: Super Cop#Box office}}\n''Police Story III: Super Cop'' is the first in the ''Police Story'' series not to be directed by Chan, with [[Stanley Tong]] taking over the helm. It is also the last appearance in the series for [[Maggie Cheung]] as Ka-Kui's girlfriend, May. The film grossed HK$32,609,783 in its Hong Kong theatrical run.  After Chan's North American breakthrough in ''[[Rumble in the Bronx]]'', the film was released in North America on 25 July 1996, under the title ''Supercop''. Opening at 1,406 theatres, it grossed [[US Dollar|US$]]5,503,176 ($3,914 per screen), on its way to a total gross of US$16,270,600. The North American release by [[Dimension Films|Dimension]] was well received.\n\n[[James Berardinelli]] of website [http://www.reelviews.net/ ReelViews] wrote: \"As is usual in a Chan film, the end credits (which show out-takes of failed stunts) are one of ''Supercop'''s highlights. There are more laughs in this hilarious three-minute sequence than in the whole of ''[[Kingpin (1996 film)|Kingpin]]''. I can't think of a better reason to stay through the entire movie. Ultimately, the closing montage points out one of the chief differences between Chan's stylized, fast-paced films and those of his American counterparts: this is action with a smile, not a grimace.\"<ref>http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/s/supercop.html</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Washington Post]]'', Richard Harrington said: \"Chan seems to have met his soul mate in Khan [Michelle Yeoh], Asia's top female action star. Like Chan, Khan does her own fighting and stunts. Unlike the Hollywood action contingent, Chan and Khan don't rely on cinematic trickery. Theirs are not special effects, just spectacular ones. Connoisseurs will find Chan's helicopter-train chase far riskier, more exciting and more believable than its mates in ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'' and ''[[The Living Daylights]]''.\"<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/review96/supercopharr.htm</ref>\n\n====''Once a Cop''====\n{{Main|Once a Cop#Box office}}\n''Once a Cop'' was released in Hong Kong on 21 October 1993. In Hong Kong, the film managed to gross HK$9,337,853 (as of 8 November 1993). The film was released to the US nearly three years later and it managed to gross US$16,270,600.\n\nAlmar Haflidason of ''[[BBC Films]]'' said: While not original, it's a good set-up for an action film. Conflicts of loyalty, moments of terrible realisation, and the facing up to of terrible choices are on offer here, but a muddy script structure and some very weak attempts at comedy hamper the flow of the film as Yeoh is partnered with muppet-like partners.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/02/20/supercop_1993_review.shtml</ref>\n\n====''Police Story IV: First Strike''====\n{{Main|Police Story IV: First Strike (film)#Box office}}\n''Police Story IV: First Strike'' was an enormous box office success in Hong Kong, grossing HK$57,518,794 during its theatrical run. It remains Jackie Chan's highest-grossing film in Hong Kong.\n\nThe film was released on 10 January 1997 in 1,344 North American theatres, grossing US$5,778,933 ($4,299 per screen) in its opening weekend. Its total North American box office gross was US$15,318,863.\n\nThe version of the film released in North American cinemas by [[New Line Cinema|New Line]] was met with mixed critical response. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] it has an approval rating of 52% based on reviews from 23 critics.<ref>http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jackie_chans_first_strike/</ref>\n\nMike LaSalle of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' was among the most enthusiastic of the reviewers: One of the pleasures of being alive at this period of history is Jackie Chan. There are other pleasures, of course, and other movie pleasures, too. But few things in film today are as reliable as a Jackie Chan movie.\nEven if the picture is weak, Chan is never disappointing. Watching him in ''Jackie Chan's First Strike,'' a brand-new effort opening today, there's no doubt that this is a lovable original and a great popular artist.\n\nSo this time Chan swims with sharks. He climbs from balcony to balcony on the top floor of a tall hotel building. He even\u2014get this\u2014drops 100 feet from a helicopter into a frozen lake, just as the helicopter explodes.<ref>http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/01/10/DD61481.DTL</ref>\n\n====''New Police Story''====\n{{Main|New Police Story#Box office}}\n''New Police Story'' opened in Hong Kong on 23 September 2004, where it made HK$5,625,746 in its first three days. It ended its run with HK$21 million, making it the fourth highest-grossing domestic release of the year.\n\nOn 13 October 2006, the film received a limited release in the United Kingdom. In its opening weekend the film grossed [[GBP]] $19,332 having been shown in 16 theatres.

The [[Royal Hong Kong Police Force]] is planning a major undercover sting called \"Operation Boar Hunt\" to arrest crime lord Chu Tao ([[Chor Yuen]]). Inspector Chan Ka-Kui (or Kevin Chan in some versions) is part of the operation, along with undercover officers stationed in a shanty town. After arresting Chu, Chan's next assignment is to protect Chu Tao's secretary, Selina Fong ([[Brigitte Lin]]), who plans to testify in court about Chu Tao's illegal activities. The trial fails due to Selina's tampering with evidence. Chu Tao is released on bail and plots revenge against Ka-Kui, framing him for the murder of fellow policeman Inspector Man. Meanwhile, Selina, realizing Chu's criminality, goes to his office at a shopping mall to download incriminating data from Chu Tao's computer system. Chu Tao and Chan notice this and head to the mall. In the ensuing fight, Ka-Kui defeats all of Chu Tao's henchmen while the police apprehend Chu and the briefcase.\n\n===''Police Story II'' (1988)===\n{{Main|Police Story II}}\n''Police Story II'' ({{zh|t=\u8b66\u5bdf\u6545\u4e8b\u7e8c\u96c6}} or ''Police Story Part II''), released in [[Hong Kong films of 1988|1988]], featured many of the same actors reprising their roles from the original.

The film is also known as ''Project S'' in original territories and many other titles, including ''Police Story IV'' (inaccurately), ''Police Story 3 Part 2'', and ''Supercop 2'' (US).\n\nBoth Jackie Chan and Bill Tung have cameo appearances as Inspector Chan Ka-Kui and \"Uncle\" Bill Wong in the film. Although Jackie Chan only has a [[cameo appearance]], some DVD covers prominently featured Chan, misleading audience to think that he was one of the main characters. He reprises his role as Inspector Chan, but in drag to catch a criminal in drag wearing the same wig and clothes.\n\n===''Police Story IV: First Strike'' (1996)===\n{{Main|Police Story IV: First Strike (film)}}\n''Police Story IV: First Strike'' ({{zh|t=\u8b66\u5bdf\u6545\u4e8b4\u4e4b\u7c21\u55ae\u4efb\u52d9}} also known as ''First Strike'' or ''Jackie Chan's First Strike'') was released in [[Hong Kong films of 1996|1996]] and is the only film in the ''Police Story'' series made partially in English. Jackie reprises his role as Chan Ka-Kui (also known in some versions as Jackie) for the final time as the Hong Kong cop works with Interpol to track down and arrest an illegal weapons dealer. Later Ka-Kui realizes that things are not as simple as they appear and soon finds himself a pawn of an organization posing as Russian intelligence. The action shifts away from Hong Kong and Asia, with a globe trekking [[espionage]] plot, lending the film the air of a [[James Bond]] adventure. The [[New Line Cinema]] release in the US contained various alterations. Filmed on location in [[Ukraine]] and [[Australia]], the film also marks the last appearance of [[Bill Tung]], who plays Chan's superior \"Uncle\" Bill Wong in the series.\n\n===''New Police Story'' (2004)===\n{{Main|New Police Story}}\n''New Police Story'' ({{zh|t=\u65b0\u8b66\u5bdf\u6545\u4e8b}}), released in [[Hong Kong films of 2004|2004]], is a [[Reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of the ''Police Story'' series. Chan portrays a disgraced detective named Chan Kwok-Wing, who accidentally leads his team into a trap from which he is the only survivor. Drowning his guilt in booze, he is eventually assigned a new younger partner who turns out to have his own secrets. However, they must work together if they are to stop the gang who killed Chan's team a year earlier. The film features younger Hong Kong actors such as [[Nicholas Tse]], [[Charlene Choi]], [[Charlie Young (actress)|Charlie Yeung]] and [[Daniel Wu]]. The story features a more dramatic focus, taking a darker and more serious tone.\n\n===''Police Story 2013'' (2013)===\n{{Main|Police Story 2013}}\n''Police Story 2013'' ({{zh|t=\u8b66\u5bdf\u6545\u4e8b2013}}), released in [[List of Hong Kong films of 2013|2013]], stars [[Jackie Chan]] in another reboot of the series. The film is directed by [[Ding Sheng (director)|Ding Sheng]], who previously helmed Chan's ''[[Little Big Soldier]]''. Unlike the previous Police Story films where he portrayed a Hong Kong cop, Jackie portrays a mainland Chinese officer named Zhong Wen. Zhong heads to Wu Bar in search of his estranged daughter, Miao Miao ([[Jing Tian]]). He disapproves of Miao's relationship with Wu Jiang ([[Liu Ye (actor)|Liu Ye]]), the nightclub owner. However, Wu, who is looking for the release of a long-time prisoner, takes Zhong, Miao, and a group of strangers hostage. The film was distributed as '''''Police Story: Lockdown''''' in the United States by Well Go USA Entertainment and released in June 2015.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office performance===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:99%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Film\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! colspan=\"8\" | Gross revenue\n|-\n!

Chan returned to fame after his first attempt to cross over to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] ended in several [[box office bomb]]s. The film grossed [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]26,626,760 in Hong Kong.\n\n====''Police Story II''====\n{{Main|Police Story II#Box office}}\nChan's second film in the series was an even bigger hit, grossing HK$34,151,609 in Hong Kong. Although the film was a huge success at the box office, it was not as appreciated as its predecessor at the [[Hong Kong Film Awards]] and only received one win.\n\n====''Police Story III: Super Cop''====\n{{Main|Police Story III: Super Cop#Box office}}\n''Police Story III: Super Cop'' is the first in the ''Police Story'' series not to be directed by Chan, with [[Stanley Tong]] taking over the helm. It is also the last appearance in the series for [[Maggie Cheung]] as Ka-Kui's girlfriend, May. The film grossed HK$32,609,783 in its Hong Kong theatrical run.  After Chan's North American breakthrough in ''[[Rumble in the Bronx]]'', the film was released in North America on 25 July 1996, under the title ''Supercop''. Opening at 1,406 theatres, it grossed [[US Dollar|US$]]5,503,176 ($3,914 per screen), on its way to a total gross of US$16,270,600. The North American release by [[Dimension Films|Dimension]] was well received.\n\n[[James Berardinelli]] of website [http://www.reelviews.net/ ReelViews] wrote: \"As is usual in a Chan film, the end credits (which show out-takes of failed stunts) are one of ''Supercop'''s highlights. There are more laughs in this hilarious three-minute sequence than in the whole of ''[[Kingpin (1996 film)|Kingpin]]''. I can't think of a better reason to stay through the entire movie. Ultimately, the closing montage points out one of the chief differences between Chan's stylized, fast-paced films and those of his American counterparts: this is action with a smile, not a grimace.\"<ref>http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/s/supercop.html</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Washington Post]]'', Richard Harrington said: \"Chan seems to have met his soul mate in Khan [Michelle Yeoh], Asia's top female action star. Like Chan, Khan does her own fighting and stunts. Unlike the Hollywood action contingent, Chan and Khan don't rely on cinematic trickery. Theirs are not special effects, just spectacular ones. Connoisseurs will find Chan's helicopter-train chase far riskier, more exciting and more believable than its mates in ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'' and ''[[The Living Daylights]]''.\"<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/review96/supercopharr.htm</ref>\n\n====''Once a Cop''====\n{{Main|Once a Cop#Box office}}\n''Supercop 2'' was released in Hong Kong on 21 October 1993. In Hong Kong, the film managed to gross HK$9,337,853 (as of 8 November 1993). The film was released to the US nearly three years later and it managed to gross US$16,270,600.\n\nAlmar Haflidason of ''[[BBC Films]]'' said: While not original, it's a good set-up for an action film. Conflicts of loyalty, moments of terrible realisation, and the facing up to of terrible choices are on offer here, but a muddy script structure and some very weak attempts at comedy hamper the flow of the film as Yeoh is partnered with muppet-like partners.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/02/20/supercop_1993_review.shtml</ref>\n\n====''Police Story IV: First Strike''====\n{{Main|Police Story IV: First Strike (film)#Box office}}\n''Police Story IV: First Strike'' was an enormous box office success in Hong Kong, grossing HK$57,518,794 during its theatrical run. It remains Jackie Chan's highest-grossing film in Hong Kong.\n\nThe film was released on 10 January 1997 in 1,344 North American theatres, grossing US$5,778,933 ($4,299 per screen) in its opening weekend. Its total North American box office gross was US$15,318,863.\n\nThe version of the film released in North American cinemas by [[New Line Cinema|New Line]] was met with mixed critical response. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] it has an approval rating of 52% based on reviews from 23 critics.<ref>http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jackie_chans_first_strike/</ref>\n\nMike LaSalle of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' was among the most enthusiastic of the reviewers: One of the pleasures of being alive at this period of history is Jackie Chan. There are other pleasures, of course, and other movie pleasures, too. But few things in film today are as reliable as a Jackie Chan movie.\nEven if the picture is weak, Chan is never disappointing. Watching him in ''Jackie Chan's First Strike,'' a brand-new effort opening today, there's no doubt that this is a lovable original and a great popular artist.\n\nSo this time Chan swims with sharks. He climbs from balcony to balcony on the top floor of a tall hotel building. He even\u2014get this\u2014drops 100 feet from a helicopter into a frozen lake, just as the helicopter explodes.<ref>http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/01/10/DD61481.DTL</ref>\n\n====''New Police Story''====\n{{Main|New Police Story#Box office}}\n''New Police Story'' opened in Hong Kong on 23 September 2004, where it made HK$5,625,746 in its first three days.

Ayyub succeeded his father as governor of Tikrit when Shadhi died soon after.\n\nIn 1132 Ayyub was in the service of [[Imad ad-Din Zengi]]. He participated in a battle against the  [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Sultan]] near Tikrit and saved Zengi's life when he assisted his retreat across the [[Tigris]]. In 1136, Shirkuh killed a Christian with whom he was quarrelling in Tikrit, and the brothers were exiled (Ayyub's son Yusuf, later known as [[Saladin]], was supposedly born the night they left). Zengi later appointed Ayyub governor of [[Baalbek]], and when the town was besieged in 1146 by [[Mu'in ad-Din Unur]], the [[atabeg]] of the [[Burid dynasty|Burid]] emir of [[Damascus]], Ayyub surrendered it and retired to Damascus. Shirkuh, meanwhile, entered the service of Zengi's son [[Nur ad-Din Zengi]], who had designs on Damascus; when the [[Second Crusade]] [[Siege of Damascus (1148)|besieged the city]] in 1148, Nur ad-Din forced Mu'in ad-Din and the Burids into a reluctant alliance. Soon Nur ad-Din demanded the city be handed over to him, and Ayyub and Shirkuh negotiated its surrender in 1154. Ayyub remained governor of Damascus under Nur ad-Din's rule. He was held in such honour that he was the only one of Nur ad-Din's officials allowed to remain seated in his presence.\n\nAyyub's son Saladin also took up service with Nur ad-Din, and he was sent to [[Egypt]] to take control in Nur ad-Din's name during the period of joint [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|crusader]]-[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] invasions. In 1170 Ayyub joined him there, either summoned by Saladin himself, or sent by Nur ad-Din to convince Saladin to depose the last [[Fatimid]] caliph. Saladin offered the vizierate to him, but he refused, and instead was granted [[Alexandria]], [[Damietta]], and [[Beheira Governorate|Al Buhayrah]] as personal fiefs. Many of Saladin's other relatives also joined him in Egypt. Nur ad-Din did not trust Saladin and his family, correctly assuming that they were consolidating power against him; Ayyub publicly supported Nur ad-Din, but privately warned his son that Nur ad-Din should never be allowed to take Egypt from him.\n\n==Death==\n\nNajm ad-Din Ayyub was injured in a horse riding accident on July 31, 1173, and died on August 9. His death exacerbated the tension between Saladin and Nur ad-Din; the latter had summoned the former to assist in an expedition against the Kingdom of Jerusalem, but Saladin returned home when he heard of his father's death. However the expected confrontation between Nur ad-Din and Saladin did not occur, as Nur ad-Din died the next year, and Saladin eventually took control of the whole of Egypt and Syria.\n\nAccording to [[Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad]], Ayyub was \"a noble, generous man, mild and of excellent character.\" He was also \"passionately fond of [[polo]]\". [[Ibn al-Qalanisi]] calls him \"a man of resolution, intelligence and knowledge of affairs\", who prudently handed over Baalbek to a superior force in return for rewards and honours.\n\nHis given name was Ayyub ([[Job (Bible)|Job]]), from which comes the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] of Saladin and his successors.

His death exacerbated the tension between Saladin and Nur ad-Din; the latter had summoned the former to assist in an expedition against the Kingdom of Jerusalem, but Saladin returned home when he heard of his father's death. However the expected confrontation between Nur ad-Din and Saladin did not occur, as Nur ad-Din died the next year, and Saladin eventually took control of the whole of Egypt and Syria.\n\nAccording to [[Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad]], Ayyub was \"a noble, generous man, mild and of excellent character.\" He was also \"passionately fond of [[polo]]\". [[Ibn al-Qalanisi]] calls him \"a man of resolution, intelligence and knowledge of affairs\", who prudently handed over Baalbek to a superior force in return for rewards and honours.\n\nHis given name was Ayyub ([[Job (Bible)|Job]]), from which comes the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] of Saladin and his successors. Najm ad-Din is an honorific meaning \"star of the faith\".\n\n==Family and children==\nAyyub had several children:\n*Nur ad-Din Shahanshah (died 1148)\n*[[Saladin|Salah ad-Din Yusuf]] (Saladin) (1137\u20131193)\n*[[al-Adil I|al-Malik al-Adil Sayf ad-Din Abu Bakr Ahmad]] (Saphadin) (1145\u20131218)\n*[[Turan-Shah|al-Malik al-Mu'azzam Shams ad-Dawla Turan-Shah]] (died 1181)\n*Taj al-Muluk Abu Sa'id Buri (died 1184)\n*[[Tughtakin ibn Ayyub|al-Malik al-'Aziz Sayf al-Islam Tughtekin]] (died 1197)\n* [[Rabi'a Khatun]] (daughter, d. 1246), married (1) Amir Sa'd al-Din Mas'ud b.

It was designed by [[Percy Allan]] and built in 1899 by [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]] contractor, S. McGill. The property is owned by [[Roads and Maritime Services]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1467>{{cite NSW SHR|5051369|Dunmore Bridge over the Paterson River|hr=01467|fn=H00/00322|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n===Timber truss bridges and Allan trusses===\nTimber [[Truss bridge|truss road bridges]] have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n[[Truss bridge#Allan truss|Allan trusses]] were the first truly scientifically engineered timber truss bridges, and incorporate American design ideas for the first time. This is a reflection of the changing mindset of the NSW people, who were slowly accepting that American ideas could be as good as or better than European ones. The high quality and low cost of the Allan truss design entrenched the dominance of timber truss bridges for NSW roads for the next 30 years.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n[[Percy Allan]], the designer of Allan truss and other bridges, was a senior engineer of the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in late 19th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n===Dunmore Bridge===\nThe bridge was built in 1899 by S. McGill at a cost of [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]12,433, with J. Ferguson as inspector in charge of the work, under principal assistant engineer of bridges [[Ernest de Burgh]].

The timber truss spans were replaced in 2013 with the same design, except replacing the wrought iron vertical tension members with steel and using blackbutt timber instead of grey ironbark.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n== Description ==\nDunmore Bridge is an overhead braced Allan type timber truss road bridge. It has three timber truss [[Span (architecture)|spans]], each of {{convert|34.2|m|ft|0}}, {{convert|34.4|m|ft|0}}, and {{convert|33.8|m|ft|0}}. It has an internal steel truss [[Vertical-lift bridge|lift span]] of {{convert|17.8|m|ft|0}}. There is a single approach span at each end giving the bridge an overall length of {{convert|130.5|m|ft|0}}. The bridge has a height restriction of {{convert|4.6|m|ft|0}} because of the overhead bracing between the tops of the trusses.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\nThe main spans of the superstructure are supported by twin cast iron cylinder [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. The bridge provides a single lane carriage way with a minimum width of {{convert|4.3|m|ft|0}} and a footpath. An Armco guardrail protects vehicular traffic, and a timber post and rail fence is provided on the footpath. The lifting mechanism is no longer in service following the removal of the lifting ropes and counter weights.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\nThe bridge was reported to be in good condition as at 13 September 2005. It has been well maintained by the RTA.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nCompleted in 1899, the Dunmore bridge is a representative example of an Allan truss road bridge, and is one of three surviving overhead braced timber truss road bridges in NSW. The bridge also has a lift span to allow river traffic under it, which is a rare feature that also contains much technical significance and information about engineering technology of the late 19th century. Most of its engineering details are intact, and the bridge is in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\nAllan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were 20% cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50% more load, and were easier to maintain. The people who live in the area around the bridge (Woodville and the Hunter region) value the bridge highly, and as such it has social significance. Dunmore Bridge is located in the Hunter region, which has 15 historic bridges each constructed before 1905, and it gains heritage significance from its proximity to the high concentration of other historic bridges in the area. In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Dunmore bridge is a rare and representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being Nationally significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\nDunmore Bridge over the Paterson River was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible.

It was designed by [[Percy Allan]] and built in 1899 by [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]] contractor, S. McGill. The property is owned by [[Roads and Maritime Services]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1467>{{cite NSW SHR|5051369|Dunmore Bridge over the Paterson River|hr=01467|fn=H00/00322|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n===Timber truss bridges and Allan trusses===\nTimber [[Truss bridge|truss road bridges]] have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n[[Truss bridge#Allan truss|Allan trusses]] were the first truly scientifically engineered timber truss bridges, and incorporate American design ideas for the first time. This is a reflection of the changing mindset of the NSW people, who were slowly accepting that American ideas could be as good as or better than European ones. The high quality and low cost of the Allan truss design entrenched the dominance of timber truss bridges for NSW roads for the next 30 years.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n[[Percy Allan]], the designer of Allan truss and other bridges, was a senior engineer of the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in late 19th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1467/>\n\n===Dunmore Bridge===\nThe bridge was built in 1899 by S. McGill at a cost of [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]12,433, with J. Ferguson as inspector in charge of the work, under principal assistant engineer of bridges [[Ernest de Burgh]]. It replaced the 1863 Dunmore Bridge, which had been damaged in a flood in January 1895, and by 1896 was reported to be so suffering from the \"ravages of cobra, white ant and rot\" that a new bridge was required. Contractor McGill also built the [[Morpeth Bridge]] and the Hinton Bridge nearby. The new bridge was opened on 15 December 1899 by [[Walter Bennett (politician)|Walter Bennett]] MP, the Member for [[Electoral district of Durham|Durham]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article137526393 |title=The New Bridge at Dunmore. |newspaper=[[Dungog Chronicle : Durham and Gloucester Advertiser]] |volume=VI |issue=1255 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=19 December 1899 |accessdate=26 July 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article237185128 |title=BRIDGE OVER THE PATERSON RIVER. |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |issue=6400 |location=Sydney |date=15 December 1899 |accessdate=26 July 2018 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe lifting mechanism for the lift span has since been removed.

Accidents -->\n<section begin=\"summary\" />In March 2019, [[National aviation authority|aviation authorities]] around the world [[Aircraft on ground|grounded]] the [[Boeing 737 MAX]] passenger [[airliner]] after two new MAX aircraft crashed within five months, killing all 346 people aboard the two flights, [[Lion Air Flight 610]] on October 29, 2018 and [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302]] on March 10, 2019. <!-- 2. MCAS -->A week after the first accident, Boeing and the [[U.S. Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) sent airlines urgent messages regarding a new flight control feature, the [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System]] (MCAS), which Boeing had intentionally omitted from MAX crew manuals and training, that could cause unintended [[Descent (aeronautics)#Dives|nosedives]] and may be disabled with an existing [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Runaway stabilizer and manual trim|procedure]]. In a private analysis, the FAA predicted more accidents if MCAS was not revised, but believed the [[emergency airworthiness directive]] it issued would suffice until Boeing delivered a permanent solution.\n\n<!-- 3. Groundings -->\nEthiopian Airlines grounded its remaining MAX fleet on March 10, day of the crash. On March 11, the [[Civil Aviation Administration of China]] ordered the first nationwide grounding, followed by most other regulators in quick succession. The FAA publicly asserted the MAX's [[Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community|continued airworthiness]] on March 11, then grounded the airplane on March 13 after receiving evidence of  accident similarities. By March 18, all 387 airplanes, which served 8,600 flights each week for 59 airlines, were grounded worldwide. Boeing suspended deliveries to airlines, but produced another 400 aircraft before halting manufacturing in January 2020.\n\n<!-- 4.  Aftermath: inquiries -->\nAfter the groundings, the [[U.S. Congress]], FBI and ad hoc panels began investigating FAA [[Boeing 737 MAX certification|certification]] of the MAX, particularly the [[Organization Designation Authorization|delegation of authority]] that allowed Boeing to act on behalf of the FAA. Several [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Supporting systems|system and manufacturing defects]] were uncovered, in addition to problems with MCAS. Boeing eventually reversed its policy and recommended flight simulator training for all MAX pilots. The longest ever grounding for a U.S. airliner was estimated to cost Boeing $18.6 billion by March 2020.<!--ref name=Flight13mar2020-->\n\n<!-- 5.  Aftermath: final reports -->\nInvestigators published their findings on the first anniversaries of the accidents in October 2019 and March 2020. The Indonesian [[National Transportation Safety Committee|NTSC]] faulted airplane design, certification, maintenance, and flight crew actions.

Accidents -->\n<section begin=\"summary\" />In March 2019, [[National aviation authority|aviation authorities]] around the world [[Aircraft on ground|grounded]] the [[Boeing 737 MAX]] passenger [[airliner]] after two new MAX aircraft crashed within five months, killing all 346 people aboard the two flights, [[Lion Air Flight 610]] on October 29, 2018 and [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302]] on March 10, 2019. \n<!-- 2. MCAS -->A week after the first accident, Boeing and the [[U.S. Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) sent airlines urgent messages regarding a new flight control feature, the [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System]] (MCAS), which Boeing had intentionally omitted from MAX crew manuals and training, that could cause unintended [[Descent (aeronautics)#Dives|nosedives]] and may be disabled with an existing [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Runaway stabilizer and manual trim|procedure]]. In a private analysis, the FAA predicted more accidents if MCAS was not revised, but believed the [[emergency airworthiness directive]] it issued would suffice until Boeing delivered a permanent solution.\n\n<!-- 3. Groundings -->\nEthiopian Airlines grounded its remaining MAX fleet on March 10, day of the crash. On March 11, the [[Civil Aviation Administration of China]] ordered the first nationwide grounding, followed by most other regulators in quick succession. The FAA publicly asserted the MAX's [[Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community|continued airworthiness]] on March 11, then grounded the airplane on March 13 after receiving evidence of  accident similarities. By March 18, all 387 airplanes, which served 8,600 flights each week for 59 airlines, were grounded worldwide. Boeing suspended deliveries to airlines, but produced another 400 aircraft before halting manufacturing in January 2020.\n\n<!-- 4.  Aftermath: inquiries -->\nAfter the groundings, the [[U.S. Congress]], FBI and ad hoc panels began investigating FAA [[Boeing 737 MAX certification|certification]] of the MAX, particularly the [[Organization Designation Authorization|delegation of authority]] that allowed Boeing to act on behalf of the FAA. Several [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Supporting systems|system and manufacturing defects]] were uncovered, in addition to problems with MCAS. Boeing eventually reversed its policy and recommended flight simulator training for all MAX pilots. The longest ever grounding for a U.S. airliner was estimated to cost Boeing $18.6 billion by March 2020.<!--ref name=Flight13mar2020-->\n\n<!-- 5.  Aftermath: final reports -->\nInvestigators published their findings on the first anniversaries of the accidents in October 2019 and March 2020. The Indonesian [[National Transportation Safety Committee|NTSC]] faulted airplane design, certification, maintenance, and flight crew actions. The Ethiopian [[Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority|ECAA]], which determined that the flight crew had attempted the recovery procedure, assigned blame to the aircraft's software design. The U.S. [[NTSB]] concluded that  malfunctions resulted in multiple cockpit alerts that likely confused the flight crews. The [[U.S. House of Representatives]] criticized Boeing's \"culture of concealment\" during certification and in the aftermath of both accidents.<section end=\"summary\" />\n<!-- THE SECTION TAGS ARE PLACED HERE TO ALLOW TRANSCLUSION OF THIS INTRODUCTION into Boeing 737 MAX EDITS BETWEEN THE TAGS APPEAR IN THAT ARTICLE -->\n<!-- The tags must stay in these locations next to the notes. -->\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n* On October 29, 2018, a 737 MAX 8 operating [[Lion Air Flight 610]] crashed after take-off from Jakarta, killing 189 people, leading Boeing to publicly unveil the [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System|MCAS]], a new automated flight control on the MAX that could cause unintended [[Descent (aeronautics)#Dives|nosedives]], but was omitted from crew manuals and training.<ref name=Flight13mar2020/>\n* On November 6, 2018, Boeing issued a [[service bulletin]] warning that with \"erroneous {{abbr|AOA|angle of attack}} data, the pitch trim system can trim the stabilizer nose down in increments lasting up to 10 seconds\" which \"can be stopped and reversed with the use of the electric stabilizer trim switches but may restart 5 seconds after\" and instructed pilots to counteract it by running the [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Runaway stabilizer and manual trim|Runaway stabilizer and manual trim]] procedure.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-safety/boeing-nearing-737-max-fleet-bulletin-on-aoa-warning-after-lion-air-crash/ |title= Boeing nearing 737 Max fleet bulletin on AoA warning after Lion Air crash |date= November 7, 2018 |work= The Air Current |author= Jon Ostrower}}</ref> \n* On November 7, the FAA issued an [[Emergency airworthiness directive]] requiring revising \"the {{abbr|AFM|aircraft flight manual}} to provide the flight crew with runaway horizontal stabilizer trim procedures\" when \"repeated nose-down trim commands\" are caused by \"an erroneously high single AOA sensor\".<ref>{{cite web| url= https://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgad.nsf/0/83ec7f95f3e5bfbd8625833e0070a070/$FILE/2018-23-51_Emergency.pdf |title= Emergency Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-23-51 |date= November 7, 2018 |publisher= FAA}}</ref>\n* On December 3, the FAA conducted an unpublished \"Transport Aircraft Risk Assessment Methodology\u201d (TARAM) [[Boeing 737 MAX certification#Boeing 737 safety analysis|analysis]] that concluded, \"if left uncorrected, the MCAS design flaw in the 737 Max could result in as many as 15 future fatal crashes over the life of the fleet\u201d;

Child abuse may include any act or failure to act by a parent or a caregiver that results in actual or potential harm  to a child, and can occur in a child's home, or in the organizations, schools or communities the child interacts with.\n\nThe terms ''child abuse'' and ''child maltreatment'' are often used interchangeably, although some researchers make a distinction between them, treating ''child maltreatment'' as an [[umbrella term]] to cover neglect, exploitation, and [[Human trafficking|trafficking]].\n\nDifferent [[jurisdictions]] have developed their own definitions of what constitutes child abuse for the purposes of removing children from their families or prosecuting a [[criminal charge]].\n\n==History==\nThe whole of recorded history contains references to acts that can be described as child abuse or child maltreatment, but professional inquiry into the topic is generally considered to have begun in the 1960s.<ref name=McCoyIntro /> The July 1962 publication of the paper \"The Battered Child-Syndrome\" authored principally to pediatric psychiatrist [[C. Henry Kempe]] and published in ''[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' represents the moment that child maltreatment entered mainstream awareness. Before the article's publication, injuries to children\u2014even repeated bone fractures\u2014were not commonly recognized as the results of intentional trauma. Instead, physicians often looked for undiagnosed [[bone disease]]s or accepted parents' accounts of accidental mishaps such as falls or assaults by neighborhood bullies.<ref name=Childism/>{{rp|100&ndash;103}}\n\nThe study of child abuse and neglect emerged as an academic discipline in the early 1970s in the United States. [[Elisabeth Young-Bruehl]] maintains that despite the growing numbers of child advocates and interest in protecting children which took place, the grouping of children into \"the abused\" and the \"non-abused\" created an artificial distinction that narrowed the concept of [[children's rights]] to simply protection from maltreatment, and blocked investigation of the ways in which children are discriminated against in society generally. Another effect of the way child abuse and neglect have been studied, according to Young-Bruehl, was to close off consideration of how children themselves perceive maltreatment and the importance they place on adults' attitudes toward them. Young-Bruehl writes that when the belief in children's inherent inferiority to adults is present in society, all children suffer whether or not their treatment is labeled as \"abuse\".<ref name=Childism/>{{rp|15&ndash;16}}\n\n== Definitions ==\nDefinitions of what constitutes child abuse vary among professionals, between social and cultural groups, and across time.<ref name=\"Coghill\">{{cite book|author1=Coghill, D. |author2=Bonnar, S. |author3=Duke, S. |author4=Graham, J. |author5=Seth, S. |title=Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-923499-8|year=2009|page=412|accessdate=8 March 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pcUeLW9O0ZgC&pg=PA412|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224005130/https://books.google.com/books?id=pcUeLW9O0ZgC&pg=PA412|archivedate=24 February 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Hersen\">{{cite book|author=Wise, Deborah|chapter=Child Abuse Assessment|editor=Hersen, Michel|title=Clinician's Handbook of Child Behavioral Assessment|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=978-0-08-049067-0|year=2011|page=550|accessdate=8 March 2016|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dyhRU_dOqAoC&pg=PA550|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223175700/https://books.google.com/books?id=dyhRU_dOqAoC&pg=PA550|archivedate=23 February 2017}}</ref> The terms ''abuse'' and ''maltreatment'' are often used interchangeably in the literature.<ref name=Surveillance>{{cite book |url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cm_surveillance-a.pdf |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control |location=Atlanta, Georgia |title=Child Maltreatment Surveillance: Uniform Definitions for Public Health and Recommended Data Elements, Version 1.0 |date=January 2008 |author1=Leeb, R.T. |author2=Paulozzi, L.J. |author3=Melanson, C. |author4=Simon, T.R. |author5=Arias, I. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829063410/https://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/CM_Surveillance-a.pdf |archivedate=29 August 2017  }}</ref>{{rp|11}} ''Child maltreatment'' can also be an [[umbrella term]] covering all forms of child abuse and [[child neglect]].<ref name=McCoyIntro>{{cite book |author1=McCoy, M.L. |author2=Keen, S.M. |chapter=Introduction |title=Child Abuse and Neglect |edition=2 |date=2013 |accessdate=4 February 2016 |location=New York |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-1-84872-529-4 |oclc=863824493 |pages=3\u201322 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCkVAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA3 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223162013/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCkVAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA3 |archivedate=23 February 2017  }}</ref> Defining child maltreatment depends on prevailing cultural values as they relate to children, [[child development]], and [[parenting]].<ref name=\"Midgley\">{{cite book|author=Conley, Amy|editor1=Midgley, James|editor2=Conley, Amy|chapter=2.

According to [[Georges Menahem]], the French sociologist who found out these correlations by studying health inequalities, these relationships show that inequalities in illness and suffering are not only social. [[Health inequality]] also has its origins in the family, where it is associated with the degrees of lasting affective problems (lack of affection, parental discord, the prolonged absence of a parent, or a serious illness affecting either the mother or father) that individuals report having experienced in childhood.<ref>\"Study of Living Conditions 1986\u20131987\" INSEE survey with a sample of 13\u2013154 individuals, cf.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the [[International Society for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect]] (ISPCAN) identify multiple factors at the level of the individual, their relationships, their local community, and their society at large, that combine to influence the occurrence of child maltreatment. At the individual level, such factors include age, sex, and personal history, while at the level of society, factors contributing to child maltreatment include cultural norms encouraging harsh physical punishment of children, [[economic inequality]], and the lack of [[social safety net]]s.<ref name=\"Nature&Consequences\" /> WHO and ISPCAN state that understanding the complex interplay of various risk factors is vital for dealing with the problem of child maltreatment.<ref name=\"Nature&Consequences\" />\n\nThe American psychoanalyst [[Elisabeth Young-Bruehl]] maintains that harm to children is justified and made acceptable by widely held beliefs in children's inherent subservience to adults, resulting in a largely unacknowledged prejudice against children she terms ''childism''.

These steps fall into one of three theoretical orientations (i.e., rational or solution focused, cognitive emotive, and behavioral) and are intended to provide abused children and their adoptive parents with positive behavior change, corrective interpersonal skills, and greater control over themselves and their relationships. They are: 1) determining and normalizing thinking and behaving, 2) evaluating language, 3) shifting attention away from problem talk 4) describing times when the attachment problem isn't happening, 5) focusing on how family members \"successfully\" solve problematic attachment behavior; 6) acknowledging \"unpleasant emotions\" (i.e., angry, sad, scared) underlying negative interactional patterns, 7) identifying antecedents (controlling conditions) and associated negative cognitive emotive connections in behavior (reciprocal role of thought and emotion in behavioral causation), 8) encouraging previously abused children to experience or \"own\" negative thoughts and associated aversive emotional feelings, 9) modeling and rewarding positive behavior change (with themselves and in relationships), and 10) encouraging and rewarding thinking and behaving differently. This type of therapy shifts victims thoughts away from the bad and changes their behavior.<ref name=\"Golden, J.A. 2009\" />\n\n[[Parent\u2013child interaction therapy]] was designed to improve the child-parent relationship following the experience of domestic violence.

Each of these types of treatment can be used to better assist the client, depending on the form of abuse they have experienced. Play therapy and art therapy are ways to get children more comfortable with therapy by working on something that they enjoy (coloring, drawing, painting, etc.). The design of a child's artwork can be a symbolic representation of what they are feeling, relationships with friends or family, and more. Being able to discuss and analyze a child's artwork can allow a professional to get a better insight of the child.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schechter DS, Zygmunt A, Trabka KA, Davies M, Colon E, Kolodji A, McCaw JE | title = Child mental representations of attachment when mothers are traumatized: The relationship of family-drawings to story-stem completion | journal = Journal of Early Childhood and Infant Psychology | volume = 3 | pages = 119\u2013141 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18347736 | pmc = 2268110 }}</ref>\n\n== Prevalence ==\n\nChild abuse is complex and difficult to study.

Accordingly, many jurisdictions and professional bodies have made exceptions to standard requirements for confidentiality and [[Privilege (evidence)|legal privileges]] in instances of child abuse. Medical professionals, including doctors, therapists, and other mental health workers typically owe a duty of confidentiality to their patients and clients, either by law or the standards of [[professional ethics]], and cannot disclose personal information without the [[consent]] of the individual concerned. This duty conflicts with an ethical obligation to protect children from preventable harm. Accordingly, confidentiality is often waived when these professionals have a good faith suspicion that child abuse or neglect has occurred or is likely to occur and make a report to local [[child protection]] authorities. This exception allows professionals to breach confidentiality and make a report even when children or their parents or guardians have specifically instructed to the contrary. Child abuse is also a common exception to [[physician\u2013patient privilege]]: a medical professional may be called upon to testify in court as to otherwise privileged evidence about suspected child abuse despite the wishes of children or their families.<ref name=\"confidentiality\">{{cite web|last=National Center for Youth Law |title=Minor Consent, Confidentiality, and Child Abuse Reporting |url=http://www.youthlaw.org/publications/minor_consent/ |accessdate=29 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215152122/http://www.youthlaw.org/publications/minor_consent |archivedate=15 December 2010  }}</ref> Some child abuse policies in Western countries have been criticized both by some conservatives, who claim such policies unduly interfere in the privacy of the family, and by some feminists of the left wing, who claim such policies disproportionally target and punish disadvantaged women who are often themselves in vulnerable positions.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/3555098 |title=Marxist and feminist critiques of child protection: To protect children or to change society? |journal=Children Australia |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=27\u201331 |accessdate=24 August 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106031622/http://www.academia.edu/3555098/Marxist_and_Feminist_critiques_of_Child_Protection_To_Protect_Children_or_to_Change_Society_By_Philip_Mendes_published_in_Children_Australia_24_2_1999_27-31 |archivedate=6 November 2017  |last1=Mendes |first1=Philip |doi=10.1017/S103507720000910X |year=1999 }}</ref> There has also been concern that ethnic minority families are disproportionally targeted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/role-drugs-child-removal-cases-new-jersey/|title=When Race and Drugs Intersect, Children More Likely to Enter Foster Care}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/a-lost-tribe-child-welfare-system-accused-of-repeating-residential-school-history-sapping-aboriginal-kids-from-their-homes|title='A lost tribe': Child welfare system accused of repeating residential school history|date=15 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Organizations ==\n{{third-party|section|date=March 2016}}\n\n===United States of America===\nThere are organizations at national, state, and county levels in the United States that provide community leadership in preventing child abuse and neglect.

Child abuse may include any act or failure to act by a parent or a caregiver that results in actual or potential harm  to a child, and can occur in a child's home, or in the organizations, schools or communities the child interacts with.\n\nThe terms ''child abuse'' and ''child maltreatment'' are often used interchangeably, although some researchers make a distinction between them, treating ''child maltreatment'' as an [[umbrella term]] to cover neglect, exploitation, and [[Human trafficking|trafficking]].\n\nDifferent [[jurisdictions]] have developed their own definitions of what constitutes child abuse for the purposes of removing children from their families or prosecuting a [[criminal charge]].\n\n==History==\nThe whole of recorded history contains references to acts that can be described as child abuse or child maltreatment, but professional inquiry into the topic is generally considered to have begun in the 1960s.<ref name=McCoyIntro /> The July 1962 publication of the paper \"The Battered Child-Syndrome\" authored principally to pediatric psychiatrist [[C. Henry Kempe]] and published in ''[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' represents the moment that child maltreatment entered mainstream awareness. Before the article's publication, injuries to children\u2014even repeated bone fractures\u2014were not commonly recognized as the results of intentional trauma. Instead, physicians often looked for undiagnosed [[bone disease]]s or accepted parents' accounts of accidental mishaps such as falls or assaults by neighborhood bullies.<ref name=Childism/>{{rp|100&ndash;103}}\n\nThe study of child abuse and neglect emerged as an academic discipline in the early 1970s in the United States. [[Elisabeth Young-Bruehl]] maintains that despite the growing numbers of child advocates and interest in protecting children which took place, the grouping of children into \"the abused\" and the \"non-abused\" created an artificial distinction that narrowed the concept of [[children's rights]] to simply protection from maltreatment, and blocked investigation of the ways in which children are discriminated against in society generally. Another effect of the way child abuse and neglect have been studied, according to Young-Bruehl, was to close off consideration of how children themselves perceive maltreatment and the importance they place on adults' attitudes toward them. Young-Bruehl writes that when the belief in children's inherent inferiority to adults is present in society, all children suffer whether or not their treatment is labeled as \"abuse\".<ref name=Childism/>{{rp|15&ndash;16}}\n\n== Definitions ==\nDefinitions of what constitutes child abuse vary among professionals, between social and cultural groups, and across time.<ref name=\"Coghill\">{{cite book|author1=Coghill, D. |author2=Bonnar, S. |author3=Duke, S. |author4=Graham, J. |author5=Seth, S. |title=Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-923499-8|year=2009|page=412|accessdate=8 March 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pcUeLW9O0ZgC&pg=PA412|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224005130/https://books.google.com/books?id=pcUeLW9O0ZgC&pg=PA412|archivedate=24 February 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Hersen\">{{cite book|author=Wise, Deborah|chapter=Child Abuse Assessment|editor=Hersen, Michel|title=Clinician's Handbook of Child Behavioral Assessment|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=978-0-08-049067-0|year=2011|page=550|accessdate=8 March 2016|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dyhRU_dOqAoC&pg=PA550|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223175700/https://books.google.com/books?id=dyhRU_dOqAoC&pg=PA550|archivedate=23 February 2017}}</ref> The terms ''abuse'' and ''maltreatment'' are often used interchangeably in the literature.<ref name=Surveillance>{{cite book |url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cm_surveillance-a.pdf |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control |location=Atlanta, Georgia |title=Child Maltreatment Surveillance: Uniform Definitions for Public Health and Recommended Data Elements, Version 1.0 |date=January 2008 |author1=Leeb, R.T. |author2=Paulozzi, L.J. |author3=Melanson, C. |author4=Simon, T.R. |author5=Arias, I. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829063410/https://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/CM_Surveillance-a.pdf |archivedate=29 August 2017  }}</ref>{{rp|11}} ''Child maltreatment'' can also be an [[umbrella term]] covering all forms of child abuse and [[child neglect]].<ref name=McCoyIntro>{{cite book |author1=McCoy, M.L. |author2=Keen, S.M. |chapter=Introduction |title=Child Abuse and Neglect |edition=2 |date=2013 |accessdate=4 February 2016 |location=New York |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-1-84872-529-4 |oclc=863824493 |pages=3\u201322 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCkVAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA3 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223162013/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCkVAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA3 |archivedate=23 February 2017  }}</ref> Defining child maltreatment depends on prevailing cultural values as they relate to children, [[child development]], and [[parenting]].<ref name=\"Midgley\">{{cite book|author=Conley, Amy|editor1=Midgley, James|editor2=Conley, Amy|chapter=2.

According to [[Georges Menahem]], the French sociologist who found out these correlations by studying health inequalities, these relationships show that inequalities in illness and suffering are not only social. [[Health inequality]] also has its origins in the family, where it is associated with the degrees of lasting affective problems (lack of affection, parental discord, the prolonged absence of a parent, or a serious illness affecting either the mother or father) that individuals report having experienced in childhood.<ref>\"Study of Living Conditions 1986\u20131987\" INSEE survey with a sample of 13\u2013154 individuals, cf.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the [[International Society for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect]] (ISPCAN) identify multiple factors at the level of the individual, their relationships, their local community, and their society at large, that combine to influence the occurrence of child maltreatment. At the individual level, such factors include age, sex, and personal history, while at the level of society, factors contributing to child maltreatment include cultural norms encouraging harsh physical punishment of children, [[economic inequality]], and the lack of [[social safety net]]s.<ref name=\"Nature&Consequences\" /> WHO and ISPCAN state that understanding the complex interplay of various risk factors is vital for dealing with the problem of child maltreatment.<ref name=\"Nature&Consequences\" />\n\nThe American psychoanalyst [[Elisabeth Young-Bruehl]] maintains that harm to children is justified and made acceptable by widely held beliefs in children's inherent subservience to adults, resulting in a largely unacknowledged prejudice against children she terms ''childism''.

These steps fall into one of three theoretical orientations (i.e., rational or solution focused, cognitive emotive, and behavioral) and are intended to provide abused children and their adoptive parents with positive behavior change, corrective interpersonal skills, and greater control over themselves and their relationships. They are: 1) determining and normalizing thinking and behaving, 2) evaluating language, 3) shifting attention away from problem talk 4) describing times when the attachment problem isn't happening, 5) focusing on how family members \"successfully\" solve problematic attachment behavior; 6) acknowledging \"unpleasant emotions\" (i.e., angry, sad, scared) underlying negative interactional patterns, 7) identifying antecedents (controlling conditions) and associated negative cognitive emotive connections in behavior (reciprocal role of thought and emotion in behavioral causation), 8) encouraging previously abused children to experience or \"own\" negative thoughts and associated aversive emotional feelings, 9) modeling and rewarding positive behavior change (with themselves and in relationships), and 10) encouraging and rewarding thinking and behaving differently. This type of therapy shifts victims thoughts away from the bad and changes their behavior.<ref name=\"Golden, J.A. 2009\" />\n\n[[Parent\u2013child interaction therapy]] was designed to improve the child-parent relationship following the experience of domestic violence.

Each of these types of treatment can be used to better assist the client, depending on the form of abuse they have experienced. Play therapy and art therapy are ways to get children more comfortable with therapy by working on something that they enjoy (coloring, drawing, painting, etc.). The design of a child's artwork can be a symbolic representation of what they are feeling, relationships with friends or family, and more. Being able to discuss and analyze a child's artwork can allow a professional to get a better insight of the child.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schechter DS, Zygmunt A, Trabka KA, Davies M, Colon E, Kolodji A, McCaw JE | title = Child mental representations of attachment when mothers are traumatized: The relationship of family-drawings to story-stem completion | journal = Journal of Early Childhood and Infant Psychology | volume = 3 | pages = 119\u2013141 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18347736 | pmc = 2268110 }}</ref>\n\n== Prevalence ==\n\nChild abuse is complex and difficult to study.

Accordingly, many jurisdictions and professional bodies have made exceptions to standard requirements for confidentiality and [[Privilege (evidence)|legal privileges]] in instances of child abuse. Medical professionals, including doctors, therapists, and other mental health workers typically owe a duty of confidentiality to their patients and clients, either by law or the standards of [[professional ethics]], and cannot disclose personal information without the [[consent]] of the individual concerned. This duty conflicts with an ethical obligation to protect children from preventable harm. Accordingly, confidentiality is often waived when these professionals have a good faith suspicion that child abuse or neglect has occurred or is likely to occur and make a report to local [[child protection]] authorities. This exception allows professionals to breach confidentiality and make a report even when children or their parents or guardians have specifically instructed to the contrary. Child abuse is also a common exception to [[physician\u2013patient privilege]]: a medical professional may be called upon to testify in court as to otherwise privileged evidence about suspected child abuse despite the wishes of children or their families.<ref name=\"confidentiality\">{{cite web|last=National Center for Youth Law |title=Minor Consent, Confidentiality, and Child Abuse Reporting |url=http://www.youthlaw.org/publications/minor_consent/ |accessdate=29 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215152122/http://www.youthlaw.org/publications/minor_consent |archivedate=15 December 2010  }}</ref> Some child abuse policies in Western countries have been criticized both by some conservatives, who claim such policies unduly interfere in the privacy of the family, and by some feminists of the left wing, who claim such policies disproportionally target and punish disadvantaged women who are often themselves in vulnerable positions.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/3555098 |title=Marxist and feminist critiques of child protection: To protect children or to change society? |journal=Children Australia |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=27\u201331 |accessdate=24 August 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106031622/http://www.academia.edu/3555098/Marxist_and_Feminist_critiques_of_Child_Protection_To_Protect_Children_or_to_Change_Society_By_Philip_Mendes_published_in_Children_Australia_24_2_1999_27-31 |archivedate=6 November 2017  |last1=Mendes |first1=Philip |doi=10.1017/S103507720000910X |year=1999 }}</ref> There has also been concern that ethnic minority families are disproportionally targeted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/role-drugs-child-removal-cases-new-jersey/|title=When Race and Drugs Intersect, Children More Likely to Enter Foster Care}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/a-lost-tribe-child-welfare-system-accused-of-repeating-residential-school-history-sapping-aboriginal-kids-from-their-homes|title='A lost tribe': Child welfare system accused of repeating residential school history|date=15 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Organizations ==\n{{third-party|section|date=March 2016}}\n\n===United States of America===\nThere are organizations at national, state, and county levels in the United States that provide community leadership in preventing child abuse and neglect.
