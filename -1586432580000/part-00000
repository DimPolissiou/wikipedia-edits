The setting for the sermon is given in [[Matthew 5:1]]-[[Matthew 5:2|2]]. Jesus sees the multitudes, goes up into the mountain, is followed by his disciples, and begins to preach. The Sermon is brought to its close by {{bibleverse||Matthew|8:1|NKJV}}, which reports that Jesus \"came down from the mountain followed by great multitudes\".\n\n==Components==\n{{See also|Beatitudes|Salt and Light|Light of the World|Lamp under a bushel|The Mote and the Beam|Wise and Foolish Builders}}\nWhile the issue of the exact theological structure and composition of the Sermon on the Mount is subject to debate among scholars, specific components within it, each associated with particular teachings, can be identified.<ref name=Talbert21 /><ref name=WCarter >''What are they saying about Matthew's Sermon on the mount?'', Warren Carter 1994 {{ISBN|0-8091-3473-X}} pp.&nbsp;35\u201347.</ref>\n\n[[File:Meister des Lehrbuchs Kaiser Maximilians I. 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Lord's Prayer]], in [[Matthew 6:9]], 1500, Vienna]]\n{{bibleref2|Matthew|5:3-12|9|Matthew 5:3\u201312}} discusses the [[Beatitudes]].

The discourse goes on to condemn the superficiality of [[economic materialism|materialism]] and call the disciples not to worry about material needs, but to \"seek\" [[Kingdom of God|God's kingdom]] first. Within the discourse on ostentation, Matthew presents an example of correct prayer. Luke places this in a different context.

He hoped for a form of [[stenography]] that could record the whole of a conversation without any omissions.

These gummy bears balance the heavy dark background.  He enjoyed working in New York because of the environment and the competitiveness and pressure. New York to him represents ideas but he had a chance to go back to Colorado each summer for mountain biking, fishing and camping with his son.<ref name=\"AprilJ\" /> He has since gone to live in California to continue his surfing which comes through in his most recent paintings in painting tattoos of surfers on portraits. \n\nWhile painting he puts on audio books and podcasts in the background.<ref name=\"AprilJ\" /> What he plays depends on the state of mind of what he wants to paint.<ref name=\"AprilJ\" /> His listening tastes are very eclectic from country, to classical opera to rap. He has a playlist that shuffles [[Anya]] and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]].<ref name=\"AprilJ\" /> His preference in podcasts is for comedy. Van Minnen is a hard worker who doesn't wait for inspiration to paint but just shows up every day.<ref name=\"AprilJ\" /> He has a routine and works a regular work week.<ref name=\"AprilJ\" />\n\nFilm directors such as [[David Lynch]] (especially his 1990s series [[Twin Peaks]]).<ref name=\"AprilJ\" /> [[Werner Herzog]] and [[David Cronenberg]] have influenced van Minnen. But the greatest cinematic influence was the film series [[Alien (film)|Alien]] especially [[Alien 2]]. Van Minnen saw this when he was young and the character [[Ellen Ripley]] to him represents his mother trying to save the kids from the parasites of anger, addiction and the environment.

He uses a dynamic color mixing which allows them to paint in layers and allows the light to mix with the color instead of mixing on the pallet. Self-taught, he studied intensively a book called ''Methods and Materials of the Great Schools and Masters'' by Sir [[Charles Lock Eastlake]].<ref name=\"Interview\"/>\n\nThe underpaintings are monotypes he works on at home and then continues the over painting at his studio. This allows a quick production of monotypes where he can get a couple done per week and allows him to balance the months of painting and layers that have to go on top. In this way he can get ideas out quickly and not worry about capturing every single idea and painting at first.<ref name=\"Interview\"/>\n\nVan Minnen does not describe his work as macabre which would have to do with death and injury but rather about life and the absurd.<ref name=\"beinart\"/>  His work has also been called Super-Realism because his figures and gummy bears leap off the canvas.<ref name=\"male\">{{cite news |last1=Pagel |first1=David |title=Christian Rex van Minnen's modern tales of male domination, painted like an old master |agency=Los Angeles Times |date=Nov 25, 2017}}</ref> Another series of decapitated heads on top of jelly bears project power and language.

These gummy bears balance the heavy dark background.  He enjoyed working in New York because of the environment and the competitiveness and pressure. New York to him represents ideas but he had a chance to go back to Colorado each summer for mountain biking, fishing and camping with his son.<ref name=\"AprilJ\" /> He has since gone to live in California to continue his surfing which comes through in his most recent paintings in painting tattoos of surfers on portraits. \n\nWhile painting he puts on audio books and podcasts in the background.<ref name=\"AprilJ\" /> What he plays depends on the state of mind of what he wants to paint.<ref name=\"AprilJ\" /> His listening tastes are very eclectic from country, to classical opera to rap. He has a playlist that shuffles [[Anya]] and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]].<ref name=\"AprilJ\" /> His preference in podcasts is for comedy. Van Minnen is a hard worker who doesn't wait for inspiration to paint but just shows up every day.<ref name=\"AprilJ\" /> He has a routine and works a regular work week.<ref name=\"AprilJ\" />\n\nFilm directors such as [[David Lynch]] (especially his 1990s series [[Twin Peaks]]).<ref name=\"AprilJ\" /> [[Werner Herzog]] and [[David Cronenberg]] have influenced van Minnen. But the greatest cinematic influence was the film series [[Alien (film)|Alien]] especially [[Alien 2]]. Van Minnen saw this when he was young and the character [[Ellen Ripley]] to him represents his mother trying to save the kids from the parasites of anger, addiction and the environment.

He uses a dynamic color mixing which allows them to paint in layers and allows the light to mix with the color instead of mixing on the pallet. Self-taught, he studied intensively a book called ''Methods and Materials of the Great Schools and Masters'' by Sir [[Charles Lock Eastlake]].<ref name=\"Interview\"/>\n\nThe underpaintings are monotypes he works on at home and then continues the over painting at his studio. This allows a quick production of monotypes where he can get a couple done per week and allows him to balance the months of painting and layers that have to go on top. In this way he can get ideas out quickly and not worry about capturing every single idea and painting at first.<ref name=\"Interview\"/>\n\nVan Minnen does not describe his work as macabre which would have to do with death and injury but rather about life and the absurd.<ref name=\"beinart\"/>  His work has also been called Super-Realism because his figures and gummy bears leap off the canvas.<ref name=\"male\">{{cite news |last1=Pagel |first1=David |title=Christian Rex van Minnen's modern tales of male domination, painted like an old master |agency=Los Angeles Times |date=Nov 25, 2017}}</ref> Another series of decapitated heads on top of jelly bears project power and language.

Having previously unsuccessfully contested [[Hampstead and Highgate (UK Parliament constituency)|Hampstead and Highgate]] in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]], McDonnell fought for his home constituency of Hayes and Harlington at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], but lost by 53 votes, after three recounts, to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] incumbent, [[Terry Dicks]].

{"title_page": "Mass suicide in Demmin", "text_new": "{{Coord|53.905|13.049|display=title}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\nOn 1 May 1945, hundreds of people [[mass suicide|killed themselves]] in the town of [[Demmin]], in the [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Province of Pomerania]] (now in [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]), [[Germany]]. The suicides occurred during a mass panic that was provoked by atrocities committed by soldiers of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]], who had sacked the town the day before. Although death toll estimates vary, it is acknowledged to be the largest mass suicide ever recorded in Germany. The suicide was part of a [[Mass suicides in 1945 Nazi Germany|mass suicide wave]] amongst the population of Nazi Germany.\n\n[[Nazi Party|Nazi officials]], the police, the [[Wehrmacht]] and many citizens had left the town before the arrival of the Red Army, while thousands of [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|refugees from the East]] had also taken refuge in Demmin. Three Soviet negotiators were shot prior to the Soviet advance into Demmin and [[Hitler Youth]], amongst others, fired on Soviet soldiers once inside the town. The retreating Wehrmacht had blown up the bridges over the [[Peene]] and [[Tollense]] rivers, which enclosed the town to the north, west and south, thus blocking the Red Army's advance and trapping the remaining civilians. The Soviet units looted and burned down the town, and committed rapes and executions.\n\nNumerous inhabitants and refugees then killed themselves, with many families doing so together. Methods of suicides included drowning in the rivers, hanging, wrist-cutting, and shooting. Most bodies were buried in mass graves, and after the war, discussion of the mass suicide was taboo under the [[East Germany|East German]] [[Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands|Communist government]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Demmin Stadtplan.PNG|thumb|325px|[[Demmin]], enclosed by the [[Peene]] river in the north and west, and the [[Tollense]] river in the south.

Before 1933 there were boycotts of Jewish businesses, which drove away most of the Jews. The synagogue was sold in June 1938 to a furniture company, which is why it survives as a building today.

The suicides occurred during a mass panic that was provoked by atrocities committed by soldiers of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]], who had sacked the town the day before. Although death toll estimates vary, it is acknowledged to be the largest mass suicide ever recorded in Germany. The suicide was part of a [[Mass suicides in 1945 Nazi Germany|mass suicide wave]] amongst the population of Nazi Germany.\n\n[[Nazi Party|Nazi officials]], the police, the [[Wehrmacht]] and many citizens had left the town before the arrival of the Red Army, while thousands of [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|refugees from the East]] had also taken refuge in Demmin. Three Soviet negotiators were shot prior to the Soviet advance into Demmin and [[Hitler Youth]], amongst others, fired on Soviet soldiers once inside the town. The retreating Wehrmacht had blown up the bridges over the [[Peene]] and [[Tollense]] rivers, which enclosed the town to the north, west and south, thus blocking the Red Army's advance and trapping the remaining civilians. The Soviet units looted and burned down the town, and committed rapes and executions.\n\nNumerous inhabitants and refugees then killed themselves, with many families doing so together. Methods of suicides included drowning in the rivers, hanging, wrist-cutting, and shooting. Most bodies were buried in mass graves, and after the war, discussion of the mass suicide was taboo under the [[East Germany|East German]] [[Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands|Communist government]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Demmin Stadtplan.PNG|thumb|325px|[[Demmin]], enclosed by the [[Peene]] river in the north and west, and the [[Tollense]] river in the south.

It was released as a [[Single (music)|single]] on May 21, 2000, after an unfinished version leaked to radio. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, placing her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single reached number five in the United Kingdom, and peaked within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark, eventually attaining a silver certification in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture.

[[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer.

It was released as a [[Single (music)|single]] on May 21, 2000, after an unfinished version leaked to radio. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, placing her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single reached number five in the United Kingdom, and peaked within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark, eventually attaining a silver certification in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.

''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware.

Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star.

In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]].

Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The Space Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a vehicle which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in LEO in the early 1990s. The U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed. As a result, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.

''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983.

From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider. Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

During the development program, Rocketdyne determined that the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104% of the originally specified thrust. To keep the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA kept the original specified thrust as 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher thrust. RS-25 upgrade versions were denoted as Block I and Block II. 109% thrust level was achieved with the Block II engines in 2001.

The station is owned by [[Standard Media]]. WLNE's studios are located in the Orms Building in downtown Providence, and its transmitter is based in [[Rehoboth, Massachusetts]].\n\n==History==\n===Early years (1963\u20131977)===\nThe station began broadcasting on January 1, 1963, as '''WTEV''' from studios on 430 County Street in New Bedford.<ref>http://menujoy.com/wtev/</ref> Its transmitter was located in [[Little Compton, Rhode Island]], with the antenna mounted on a {{convert|500|ft|m|sp=us|adj=on}} tower; a few years later, WTEV moved to a {{convert|950|ft|m|sp=us|adj=on}} tower in [[Tiverton, Rhode Island|Tiverton]]. The Tiverton transmitter was still {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} away from the transmitter sites in Rehoboth used by the existing stations in the Providence market, [[WJAR|WJAR-TV]] (channel 10) and WPRO-TV (channel 12, now [[WPRI-TV]]). However, WTEV could not build a tower in Rehoboth due to the risk of interference with [[WRGB]] in [[Schenectady, New York]], [[WCSH|WCSH-TV]] in [[Portland, Maine]], and [[WPVI-TV|WFIL-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]], which all broadcast on channel 6 in the analog era. Before cable arrived in Rhode Island in the early 1970s, viewers experienced reception problems with WTEV. This was because for its first four decades on air, its transmitter was located in [[Newport County, Rhode Island|Newport County]], resulting in its signal being sent from a different direction than WJAR-TV and WPRO-TV/WPRI-TV. This forced viewers to mount their outdoor antennas on rotators to get a passable signal from the station. The ensuing signal problems would be the bane of channel 6's existence for 45 years.\n\nABC had a curious history in Rhode Island prior to WTEV's sign-on. In the earliest years of television in Providence, all four networks (including [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]]) were shoehorned on primary [[NBC]] affiliate WJAR-TV, at that time the market's only television station (WJAR carried about half of NBC's and [[CBS]]' programming, but very few ABC or DuMont shows). WNET launched on channel 16 in 1953 as an ABC affiliate. However, it was forced off the air in 1956 due to the difficulties faced by UHF startups at the time. Since television manufacturers were not required to include UHF tuning capability on television sets prior to 1964, viewers needed an expensive converter (or an all-channel set, the latter being very rare at the time) to watch WNET, and the picture was marginal at best even with one. For the seven years prior to channel 6's sign-on, WJAR and CBS affiliate WPRO-TV cherry-picked ABC programming, usually airing it in off-hours but occasionally preempting their primary network's schedule. Much of Rhode Island could access the full ABC schedule from [[Boston]] stations\u2014[[WHDH-TV (defunct)|WHDH-TV]] (channel 5, now occupied by [[WCVB-TV]]) prior to January 1, 1961, and [[WNAC-TV (defunct)|WNAC-TV]] (channel 7, presently occupied by the present-day [[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]] [not to be confused with the now-defunct WHDH on channel 5]) from 1961 to 1963.\n\nEven though Providence was big enough to support three full network affiliates, it soon became apparent that channel 16 would not be resurrected in the near future. The owners of the future WTEV decided to seek a waiver of FCC technical regulations to allow VHF channel 6 to be added to the FCC's ''Table of Allocations''.<ref>http://www.fcc.gov/spectrum</ref> The channel 6 license had originally been allocated to the island of [[Nantucket, Massachusetts|Nantucket]] off [[Cape Cod]], in the Boston market. However, at the time, [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) rules required that a station have its studios and offices located in its community of license, and numerous FCC filings argued that it was not practical to operate a full-service television station from Nantucket. Since a channel 6 allocation in the Providence area would have been short-spaced to WCSH-TV and WRGB, the FCC allocation was modified to New Bedford\u2014the nearest city on the Massachusetts side of the market where a transmitter could be built that could decently cover Providence while protecting WCSH-TV and WRGB from interference.\n\nNew Bedford and [[Bristol County, Massachusetts|Bristol County]] are part of the Rhode Island market due to Rhode Island's small geographic size, even though the rest of southern Massachusetts is in the Boston market (counties were assigned by [[Arbitron]] and [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]] to a particular television market based upon their viewing patterns). The advent of satellite television made this an irritation to some Massachusetts subscribers of services such as [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] who are unable to receive Massachusetts news and sports from Boston stations. The FCC allows network affiliates to prevent satellite subscribers from receiving network stations from outside the station's designated market. Bristol County is the only part of Massachusetts associated with Rhode Island for television purposes.\n\nWTEV was founded by WTEV Television, Inc.,<ref>http://www.tv-signoffs.com/audio/1964signoffs/WTEV-signoff-1964.mp3</ref> a group that was 55-percent owned by E. Anthony and Sons, publisher of the New Bedford ''[[The Standard-Times (New Bedford)|Standard-Times]]'' and owner of WNBH radio ([[WNBH|1340 AM]] and 98.1 FM, now [[WCTK]]); the remaining 45 percent was held by New England Television, the holder of the license for the old WNET.<ref name=\"by1964\">{{cite book|title=Broadcasting Yearbook 1964|year=1964|pages=A-25\u20136|url=http://www.davidgleason.com/Archive%20BC-YB/1964/Section%20A%20%20TV%20Broadcasting%20Yearbook%201964.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 1966, shortly after E.

At the time, ABC was aggressively pursuing strong NBC and CBS affiliates to switch as their ratings rose during the late 1970s, and succeeded in persuading some longtime NBC and CBS stations to switch (as an example, [[KSTP-TV]] in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]] and [[WSB-TV]] in [[Atlanta]], both longtime NBC affiliates, switched to ABC during that period).\n\nIn 1979, the Steinmans sold WTEV and their flagship station, [[WGAL|WGAL-TV]] in Lancaster, to [[Pulitzer, Inc.|Pulitzer Publishing]]. This sale reunited them with [[KOAT-TV]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], which had been sold to Pulitzer in 1969. Pulitzer changed channel 6's call letters to the present-day '''WLNE-TV''' on September 8, 1980. The new call letters were used as a promotional acronym: \"<u>W</u>e <u>L</u>ove <u>N</u>ew <u>E</u>ngland.\"  The WTEV call sign was later used on the CBS affiliate in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], from March 1996 until September 2014, when that station changed its call sign to [[WJAX-TV]]. Under Pulitzer, the station acquired studio space in the Orms Building in downtown Providence. Within a few years, most of the station's main operations were moved to Providence. The original New Bedford facility was used as a [[news bureau]], secondary studio, and sales office through the late 1980s.\n\nIn 1983, Pulitzer sold WLNE to [[Freedom Communications]]. This sale was necessary because Pulitzer had acquired WFBC-TV (now [[WYFF]]) in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], and [[WXII-TV]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]], that same year, leaving the company one VHF station over the FCC's ownership limit of the time.\n\n===Return to ABC (1995\u2013present)===\nWPRI was sold to CBS in the spring of 1995, making it a CBS [[owned-and-operated station]] and one of the last such acquisitions prior to the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]]'s [[Westinghouse Broadcasting#Merger with CBS|purchase of the network]] in August of that year. This resulted in the sale of WPRI to [[Clear Channel Communications]] due to a significant signal overlap with [[WBZ-TV]], which had [[1994 United States broadcast television realignment|joined CBS]] back in January of that year as a result of an affiliation agreement that also affected its sister stations, [[KYW-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]] and [[WJZ-TV]] in [[Baltimore]]. As a result, at midnight on September 10, 1995, WPRI reversed the 1977 swap with WLNE and officially rejoined CBS. WLNE then became an ABC affiliate again, and began calling itself '''ABC6'''.<ref name=projo-wlneabc6>{{cite news|last1=O'Brien|first1=Jerry|last2=Katz|first2=Celeste|title=Newport teachers get 10 days to deal|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/projo/access/580919401.html?dids=580919401:580919401&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+09%2C+1995&author=O+Brien%2C+Jerry%3B+Katz%2C+Celeste&pub=The+Providence+Journal&desc=Newport+teachers+get+10+days+to+deal&pqatl=google|accessdate=January 1, 2013|newspaper=[[The Providence Journal]]|date=September 9, 1995}}</ref> CBS sold WPRI to [[Clear Channel Communications]] seven months after Westinghouse's acquisition of CBS was finalized.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of May 4, 2005, WLNE's analog transmitter was knocked off the air due to a faulty section of transmission line on the tower. The transmitter had been running at 80% power due to another unrelated technical problem that occurred approximately two weeks earlier. Although Dish Network [[satellite television|satellite]] and some [[cable television|cable]] systems continued to receive broadcasts through fiber optic connections, [[Terrestrial television|over-the-air]] and DirecTV satellite subscribers were left without a local ABC affiliate (DirecTV gets its signal via antenna).  Some cable providers made special temporary arrangements to carry Boston ABC station WCVB during this outage. The WLNE transmitter was operational again late Thursday evening after 32 hours off the air.<ref>Paul Grimaldi and Timothy C. Barmann (May 7, 2005). \"Channel 6 off air for over a day\". ''[[The Providence Journal]]'', pp. B1\u20132.</ref>\n\n===Sale to Global Broadcasting===\nIn August 2006, ''[[The Providence Journal]]'' reported that WLNE was put up for sale.<ref>Timothy C. Barmann (August 17, 2006). \"Longtime owners say Channel 6 is for sale\". ''[[The Providence Journal]]'', pp. F1</ref> The key reason for the decision was the lack of a second station for Freedom to operate in the market that would improve synergies for the Providence operation. On March 12, 2007, Freedom announced it was selling WLNE to [[Global Broadcasting]], a [[Delaware corporation]] headed by Robinson Ewert and Kevin O'Brien.<ref>Lynn Arditi (March 13, 2007). \"Deal reached on sale of WLNE \u2013 A private company plans to purchase the ABC affiliate\". ''[[The Providence Journal]]'', pp. E1</ref> The FCC granted approval of this sale in mid-September and ownership was officially transferred on October 9.<ref>Paul Edward Parker (October 12, 2007). \"Cryan retires as Channel 6 is sold\". ''[[The Providence Journal]]'', pp. B1.</ref> Freedom continued to operate WLNE's website until November 30, 2007, when control was shifted to Broadcast Interactive Media, and later WorldNow in April 2010. Global Broadcasting was not related to a Canadian network, the [[Global Television Network]], or its then-parent, [[Canwest Global Communications]].\n\n=== Financial struggles, bankruptcy===\nOn June 23, NewsBlues reported that Global Broadcasting co-owner Robinson Ewert had left the company amidst a dispute with CBS over licensing fees for programs originating from [[CBS Television Distribution|its syndication unit]]. He was replaced by Rob Holtzer, general sales manager at Sunrise Sports and Entertainment, owner of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Florida Panthers]] and the [[BankAtlantic Center]] in [[Sunrise, Florida]]. He is also a former national sales manager at the [[YES Network]] in New York City.

Still, due to the fact it operates from Rehoboth with the other major Rhode Island stations, it now has a signal comparable to WJAR and WPRI for the first time ever.\n\n==Programming==\nAs an ABC affiliate, WLNE runs virtually the entire ABC programming schedule. Effective with the 1995 affiliation switch, Saturday morning [[infomercial]]s were replaced with ABC's Saturday morning program block (currently known as [[Litton's Weekend Adventure]]; that block replaced [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]] in 2011). [[broadcast syndication|Syndicated]] programming on WLNE includes ''[[Access Hollywood]]'', ''[[Inside Edition]]'', ''[[Hot Bench]]'', ''[[Judge Jerry]]'', ''[[25 Words or Less (game show)|25 Words or Less]]'' and ''[[The 700 Club]]'', among others.\n\n===Past programming preemptions and deferrals===\nAs WTEV, the station moderately preempted ABC shows, in most every case a low-rated program. This did not pose as much of a problem, since most viewers could still get the full ABC schedule on Boston's WNAC until 1972, and on WCVB afterward. During afternoon hours, WTEV ran [[animated cartoon|cartoons]] and classic sitcoms, with late nights being devoted to movies.\n\nBeginning in 1980, WLNE ran an afternoon movie from 4:00 to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. By 1982, the station was also running a movie weekdays from 9:00 to 11:00&nbsp;a.m. These movies were run under the ''[[Dialing For Dollars]]'' promotion and were hosted by George Allen for a decade. WLNE also continued to preempt moderate amounts of programming, particularly whatever game show CBS ran at 10:00&nbsp;a.m. (to accommodate the morning movie), as well as [[The CBS Late Movie|late night programming]]. As a result of the preemptions, ''[[Child's Play (game show)|Child's Play]]'', the 1983 version of ''[[Press Your Luck]]'', and ''[[Blackout (game show)|Blackout]]'' never aired on WLNE; the 1986 version of ''[[Card Sharks]]'' did not air on the station until late in the show's run. Other shows, such as ''[[Tattletales]]'' and ''[[Body Language (game show)|Body Language]]'' were tape-delayed and aired in the noon slot, since WLNE did not have a noon news broadcast at that time. Providence area viewers could also watch the preempted shows via WNEV, which was available over-the-air on the Massachusetts side of the market. Throughout much of the 1980s, WLNE was known for running two movies a day.\n\nBy the fall of 1988, WLNE was only running an afternoon movie weekdays and began clearing CBS' 10:00&nbsp;a.m. hour. In the fall of 1989, WLNE dropped CBS' ''[[Guiding Light]]'', moving the movie to 3:00&nbsp;p.m. and adding more syndicated programming in the 5:00&nbsp;p.m. hour; by mid-1990, the afternoon movie was dropped in favor of additional syndicated programming. In the fall of 1990, WLNE dropped the CBS [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s in favor of several movies in that time slot. In 1991, ''Guiding Light'' was reinstated. By 1993, the Saturday morning movies were replaced with educational children's programs and infomercials.\n\nFor many years, WLNE carried the syndicated shows ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'', ''[[Rachael Ray (talk show)|Rachael Ray]]'', ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', ''[[The Insider (TV program)|The Insider]]'', and ''Inside Edition'' from CBS Television Distribution. However, in mid-2009, the station was unable to reach a carriage agreement with the syndicator, successor to [[King World Productions]] and [[Paramount Domestic Television]]. At that time, the station was carrying ''Dr. Phil'', ''Entertainment Tonight'', and ''Inside Edition''. As a result of the situation, the shows were dropped on June 5 and quickly moved to [[WNAC-TV]] (channel 64, and the legal successor to the former WNET).<ref>[[WNAC-TV|WNAC]] (June 29, 2009). \"'Phil', ET, Inside Edition get new home\". {{cite web |url=http://www.foxprovidence.com/dpp/entertainment/television/foxprovidence_dr_phil_et_inside_edition_move_20090629 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 17, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217171613/http://www.foxprovidence.com/dpp/entertainment/television/foxprovidence_dr_phil_et_inside_edition_move_20090629 |archivedate=February 17, 2012  }}</ref> Temporarily put in their place were ''[[Cristina's Court]]'', ''[[Family Court with Judge Penny]]'', a 7:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast, and ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''.<ref>[http://www.tvnewsday.com TVNEWSDAY] (June 5, 2009). \"WLNE Providence Dropping CTD Syndies\".

In early 2006, ''ABC6 News On the Record'' replaced ''Truman Taylor'', with Jim Hummel hosting the program until his departure from the station in July 2008. Following his departure, ''On the Record'' was temporarily taken off-the-air and replaced with infomercials.\n\nOn June 19, 2016, WLNE debuted ''In the Arena'', with former Providence mayor Joe Paolino, Jr. as host.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Donnis|first1=Ian|title=Paolino To Host New Sunday Morning Show On ABC6|url=http://ripr.org/post/paolino-host-new-sunday-morning-show-abc6|accessdate=June 17, 2016|work=[[Rhode Island Public Radio]]|date=June 16, 2016}}</ref> The show initially consisted of a [[Round table (discussion)|round table]] discussion with guest political analysts and Paolino as moderator.

As WTEV, it was one of the first affiliates of the \"Love Network\" when it was formed in 1968. Local segments had been broadcast from the [[Warwick Mall]] for several years. In 2007, the telethon relocated to the [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel in downtown Providence. In 2008, the telethon was broadcast from [[Twin River Casino]] in [[Lincoln, Rhode Island|Lincoln]]. Local segments continued to be broadcast from Twin River until 2012, when the telethon became the ''MDA Show of Strength''. The following year, the show began being televised over one national network (ABC) and the local segments were discontinued. The final ''Show of Strength'' was broadcast in 2014.\n\nWLNE became the first station in Rhode Island to broadcast a local program in high-definition when it aired [[Bristol's 4th of July Parade]] in 2008 live with production facilities provided by Comcast.

Operated by WLNE (until 2012) and Cox Communications, it was the first and only 24-hour local news channel in the state. It provided non-stop news 24 hours a day, seven days a week, mainly consisting of rebroadcasts of news that aired on WLNE. The station could only be found on Cox Cable channel 5 in Rhode Island. NewsChannel 5 also provided live, continuing coverage of breaking news and other events. When severe weather struck, the WLNE weather team provided up to the minute forecasts.\n\nPrior to Citadel Communications' acquisition of WLNE, there were three live newscasts that aired exclusively on NewsChannel 5. From its launch, a weekend morning newscast was seen exclusively on the station. As of May 2011, this newscast was also broadcast on the main channel. On September 29, 2008, WLNE began offering an extra hour of local news on weekday mornings at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. An extended hour of ''Good Morning Providence'' was one of two 7 o'clock local newscasts in the market, the other being an extended hour of WPRI's ''Eyewitness News This Morning'' on WNAC-TV. This newscast was no longer broadcast as of May 2011. WLNE occasionally aired a 10 o'clock newscast during major news events or when sports programming preempted the 10 o'clock news on competitor WNAC. As of May 2011, this newscast no longer aired.\n\nFor a brief period in September 2009, an audio feed of NewsChannel 5 was broadcast on radio station [[WALE (Rhode Island)|WALE]] in various timeslots; this included a start-to-finish simulcast of the ''Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon''. On February 1, 2012, WLNE's affiliation with Cox channel 5 ended, and its programming on the channel was replaced with WJAR programming and is now [[Ocean State Networks]] (OSN).<ref name=wlne-rinewschannel5>{{cite web|title=Cox No Longer Airing ABC6 News on Rhode Island News Channel 5|url=http://www.abc6.com/story/16652841/cox-no-longer-airing-abc6-news-on-rhode-island-news-channel-5|work=abc6.com|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==News operation==\n[[File:Super Bowl LII experience reporters.jpg|thumb|right|WLNE reporters at the [[NFL Experience|Super Bowl Experience]] in [[Minnesota]] for [[Super Bowl LII]].]]\nWLNE presently broadcasts 27\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5\u00bd hours each weekday and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays).\n\nFor most of its history, WLNE has placed a distant third in the market, behind WJAR and WPRI. The station has been known for numerous turnovers in format, talent and management over the years for the purpose of increasing its newscast ratings and sales revenue, all having little or no effect. Under Global Broadcasting's ownership, changes in image and news coverage resulted in a marginal ratings increase and for a time, ''ABC6 News'' was promoted as \"New England's Fastest Growing News\". The ratings surge did not last for long. However, on March 29, 2011, WLNE scored its first late news victory in years, finishing number one at 11:00&nbsp;p.m. following the series premiere of network medical drama ''[[Body of Proof]]'', which was filmed entirely in Rhode Island for its first season.\n\nOn October 24, 2007, WLNE announced that infamous former [[List of mayors of Providence, Rhode Island|Providence mayor]] and [[WPRO (AM)|WPRO]] personality Vincent \"Buddy\" Cianci would join the station as chief political analyst and contributing editor starting on November 1.<ref>[http://www.abc6.com abc6.com] (October 24, 2007). \"ABC6 names \"Buddy\" Cianci Chief Political Analyst & Contributing Editor\".</ref> Cianci was a political analyst at WLNE in the late 1980s. As part of his duties at the station, he moderated a daily segment on ''ABC6 News''. It was first entitled ''Your Attention Please'' and was co-moderated in-studio by former Chief Reporter Jim Hummel. Following Hummel's departure from the station in July 2008, it was changed to ''Buddy TV'' and weeknight anchor John DeLuca became co-moderator. The segment aired live during the former ''ABC6 News First At Four'' with Cianci first appearing in-studio and then from the [[East Providence, Rhode Island|East Providence]] studios of WPRO, where the segment was simulcast during his weekday show that aired from 2:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. In October 2008, he started co-hosting the Sunday morning public affairs program ''ABC6 News On the Record'' with DeLuca. With the change in station ownership in May 2011, the segment name was changed to ''The World According to Buddy'' with a solo Cianci in the ABC6 studios. The segment was taped live during the noon newscasts and re-aired during the 5 o'clock news. He also became a solo host of ''On the Record''. On June 25, 2014, Cianci announced that he would be seeking a third term as mayor of Providence as an Independent candidate. As a result, he had to step down from his position at WLNE as well as WPRO for the duration of the campaign. Former chief political reporter [[Mark Curtis (broadcaster)|Mark Curtis]] took over as host of the program while Cianci campaigned for office. He lost the bid to Democrat [[Jorge Elorza]] and returned to his previous positions shortly after the 2014 general elections. On January 27, 2016, Cianci was taken from the WLNE studios to [[Miriam Hospital]] after falling ill during the taping of ''On the Record'' and was pronounced dead on January 28 at age 74..<ref name=wlne-ciancidead>{{cite web|title=Vincent \"Buddy\" Cianci dies at 74|url=http://ww.abc6.com/story/31075183/breaking-vincent-buddy-cianci-has-died|website=abc6.com|accessdate=January 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131201824/http://ww.abc6.com/story/31075183/breaking-vincent-buddy-cianci-has-died|archive-date=January 31, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The episode did not make air, with a special on Cianci airing in its timeslot on January 31.<ref name=projo-wlnecianci>{{cite news|last1=Catanzaro|first1=Mikki|title=WLNE-TV to air Cianci special Sunday in late mayor's timeslot|url=http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20160128/wlne-tv-to-air-cianci-special-sunday-in-late-mayors-timeslot|accessdate=January 28, 2016|work=Providence Journal|date=January 28, 2016}}</ref> The Sunday morning public affairs program was then put on hiatus.\n\nOn December 17, 2007, WLNE announced it would launch ''ABC6 News First At Four'', the [[media market|market]]'s first-ever 4 o'clock news on January 14, 2008. Described as a \"hard newscast\" and not morning-show style fluff, ''First At Four'' gave WLNE a head start in coverage of weather and politics. This newscast aired for just over three years and competed head to head with ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' airing on WJAR. ''First At Four'' last aired in April 2011 prior to the transfer of station ownership. In May 2009, WLNE launched a 10 o'clock newscast on Sunday mornings. Previously, it had only produced weekend morning newscasts for ''NewsChannel 5''. It was the only Providence station with a local news broadcast airing at that time. In May 2011, the new owners moved the newscast to 7:30&nbsp;a.m. and added Saturday morning broadcasts in addition to Sunday mornings. The weekend morning newscasts were cancelled in 2012. In June 2009, the station launched the market's first (since the 1980s) 7 o'clock newscast on weeknights, filling the spot vacated by ''Entertainment Tonight'', which was taken off the schedule due to the station's dispute with CBS Television Distribution. In March 2011, this newscast was replaced with infomercials, with the newscast airing only in the event they could not sell the time slot on a given day.<ref name=wlne7pmbrainfomercial>{{cite news|last=Gauthier|first=Andrew|title=Providence\u2019s WLNE Airs Bra Infomercial in Place of 7:00&nbsp;pm Newscast|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvspy/providences-wlne-airs-bra-infomercial-in-place-of-7-p-m-newscast_b7751|accessdate=May 5, 2011|newspaper=TVSpy|date=March 16, 2011}}</ref> After the station's sale to Citadel, this newscast was officially replaced with syndicated programming the following month.\n\nOn April 5, 2011, WLNE announced a new programming lineup that included the addition of a 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast on April 25.<ref name=WLNE040511/> On September 13, WLNE became the second station in the market to broadcast news in high-definition, behind WJAR and just a week ahead of WPRI/WNAC.<ref name=tvspy-wlnehd>{{cite news|last=Gauthier|first=Andrew|title=WLNE Now Broadcasting News in HD|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvspy/wlne-now-broadcasting-news-in-hd_b23426|accessdate=September 29, 2011|newspaper=TVSpy|date=September 28, 2011}}</ref> Along with the transition came a standardized graphics package used by other Citadel stations. The station received the company's standardized news set in August 2012. In January 2013, the station began streaming its newscasts to mobile devices via the Syncbak<ref>http://www.syncbak.com</ref> app for a 1-year period. Also, all reporters in the field work as [[Video journalism|multimedia journalists]] who shoot and edit their stories in addition to writing and presenting them. They also manage their own live shots through the use of mobile streaming \"backpacks\" manufactured by [[TVUnetworks]].\n\nIn weather segments, WLNE uses live regional radar from the [[National Weather Service]] local office in [[Taunton, Massachusetts]], along with high-resolution satellite. The segments are presented on-air under the Stormtracker label. From 2012 to 2017, the Stormtracker Weather Team was certified as providing Southern New England's most accurate forecast by  WeatheRate], an independent weather research firm.<ref>[http://www.weatherate.com/</ref> On July 19, 2012, WLNE became the first station in Southern New England to be recognized as [[StormReady]] by the National Weather Service.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC6/WLNE-TV  RECOGNIZED BY THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE|url=http://ww.abc6.com/story/19066733/abc6-recognized-by-the-national-weather-service|accessdate=July 19, 2012|newspaper=abc6.com|date=July 19, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714202218/http://ww.abc6.com/story/19066733/abc6-recognized-by-the-national-weather-service|archive-date=July 14, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWLNE won the Massachusetts/Rhode Island [[Associated Press]] News Station of the Year award four years in a row from 1997 to 2000 and again in 2002.

The station is owned by [[Standard Media]]. WLNE's studios are located in the Orms Building in downtown Providence, and its transmitter is based in [[Rehoboth, Massachusetts]].\n\n==History==\n===Early years (1963\u20131977)===\nThe station began broadcasting on January 1, 1963, as '''WTEV''' from studios on 430 County Street in New Bedford.<ref>http://menujoy.com/wtev/</ref> Its transmitter was located in [[Little Compton, Rhode Island]], with the antenna mounted on a {{convert|500|ft|m|sp=us|adj=on}} tower; a few years later, WTEV moved to a {{convert|950|ft|m|sp=us|adj=on}} tower in [[Tiverton, Rhode Island|Tiverton]]. The Tiverton transmitter was still {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} away from the transmitter sites in Rehoboth used by the existing stations in the Providence market, [[WJAR|WJAR-TV]] (channel 10) and WPRO-TV (channel 12, now [[WPRI-TV]]). However, WTEV could not build a tower in Rehoboth due to the risk of interference with [[WRGB]] in [[Schenectady, New York]], [[WCSH|WCSH-TV]] in [[Portland, Maine]], and [[WPVI-TV|WFIL-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]], which all broadcast on channel 6 in the analog era. Before cable arrived in Rhode Island in the early 1970s, viewers experienced reception problems with WTEV. This was because for its first four decades on air, its transmitter was located in [[Newport County, Rhode Island|Newport County]], resulting in its signal being sent from a different direction than WJAR-TV and WPRO-TV/WPRI-TV. This forced viewers to mount their outdoor antennas on rotators to get a passable signal from the station. The ensuing signal problems would be the bane of channel 6's existence for 45 years.\n\nABC had a curious history in Rhode Island prior to WTEV's sign-on. In the earliest years of television in Providence, all four networks (including [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]]) were shoehorned on primary [[NBC]] affiliate WJAR-TV, at that time the market's only television station (WJAR carried about half of NBC's and [[CBS]]' programming, but very few ABC or DuMont shows). WNET launched on channel 16 in 1953 as an ABC affiliate. However, it was forced off the air in 1956 due to the difficulties faced by UHF startups at the time. Since television manufacturers were not required to include UHF tuning capability on television sets prior to 1964, viewers needed an expensive converter (or an all-channel set, the latter being very rare at the time) to watch WNET, and the picture was marginal at best even with one. For the seven years prior to channel 6's sign-on, WJAR and CBS affiliate WPRO-TV cherry-picked ABC programming, usually airing it in off-hours but occasionally preempting their primary network's schedule. Much of Rhode Island could access the full ABC schedule from [[Boston]] stations\u2014[[WHDH-TV (defunct)|WHDH-TV]] (channel 5, now occupied by [[WCVB-TV]]) prior to January 1, 1961, and [[WNAC-TV (defunct)|WNAC-TV]] (channel 7, presently occupied by the present-day [[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]] [not to be confused with the now-defunct WHDH on channel 5]) from 1961 to 1963.\n\nEven though Providence was big enough to support three full network affiliates, it soon became apparent that channel 16 would not be resurrected in the near future. The owners of the future WTEV decided to seek a waiver of FCC technical regulations to allow VHF channel 6 to be added to the FCC's ''Table of Allocations''.<ref>http://www.fcc.gov/spectrum</ref> The channel 6 license had originally been allocated to the island of [[Nantucket, Massachusetts|Nantucket]] off [[Cape Cod]], in the Boston market. However, at the time, [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) rules required that a station have its studios and offices located in its community of license, and numerous FCC filings argued that it was not practical to operate a full-service television station from Nantucket. Since a channel 6 allocation in the Providence area would have been short-spaced to WCSH-TV and WRGB, the FCC allocation was modified to New Bedford\u2014the nearest city on the Massachusetts side of the market where a transmitter could be built that could decently cover Providence while protecting WCSH-TV and WRGB from interference.\n\nNew Bedford and [[Bristol County, Massachusetts|Bristol County]] are part of the Rhode Island market due to Rhode Island's small geographic size, even though the rest of southern Massachusetts is in the Boston market (counties were assigned by [[Arbitron]] and [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]] to a particular television market based upon their viewing patterns). The advent of satellite television made this an irritation to some Massachusetts subscribers of services such as [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] who are unable to receive Massachusetts news and sports from Boston stations. The FCC allows network affiliates to prevent satellite subscribers from receiving network stations from outside the station's designated market. Bristol County is the only part of Massachusetts associated with Rhode Island for television purposes.\n\nWTEV was founded by WTEV Television, Inc.,<ref>http://www.tv-signoffs.com/audio/1964signoffs/WTEV-signoff-1964.mp3</ref> a group that was 55-percent owned by E. Anthony and Sons, publisher of the New Bedford ''[[The Standard-Times (New Bedford)|Standard-Times]]'' and owner of WNBH radio ([[WNBH|1340 AM]] and 98.1 FM, now [[WCTK]]); the remaining 45 percent was held by New England Television, the holder of the license for the old WNET.<ref name=\"by1964\">{{cite book|title=Broadcasting Yearbook 1964|year=1964|pages=A-25\u20136|url=http://www.davidgleason.com/Archive%20BC-YB/1964/Section%20A%20%20TV%20Broadcasting%20Yearbook%201964.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 1966, shortly after E.

At the time, ABC was aggressively pursuing strong NBC and CBS affiliates to switch as their ratings rose during the late 1970s, and succeeded in persuading some longtime NBC and CBS stations to switch (as an example, [[KSTP-TV]] in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]] and [[WSB-TV]] in [[Atlanta]], both longtime NBC affiliates, switched to ABC during that period).\n\nIn 1979, the Steinmans sold WTEV and their flagship station, [[WGAL|WGAL-TV]] in Lancaster, to [[Pulitzer, Inc.|Pulitzer Publishing]]. This sale reunited them with [[KOAT-TV]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], which had been sold to Pulitzer in 1969. Pulitzer changed channel 6's call letters to the present-day '''WLNE-TV''' on September 8, 1980. The new call letters were used as a promotional acronym: \"<u>W</u>e <u>L</u>ove <u>N</u>ew <u>E</u>ngland.\"  The WTEV call sign was later used on the CBS affiliate in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], from March 1996 until September 2014, when that station changed its call sign to [[WJAX-TV]]. Under Pulitzer, the station acquired studio space in the Orms Building in downtown Providence. Within a few years, most of the station's main operations were moved to Providence. The original New Bedford facility was used as a [[news bureau]], secondary studio, and sales office through the late 1980s.\n\nIn 1983, Pulitzer sold WLNE to [[Freedom Communications]]. This sale was necessary because Pulitzer had acquired WFBC-TV (now [[WYFF]]) in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], and [[WXII-TV]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]], that same year, leaving the company one VHF station over the FCC's ownership limit of the time.\n\n===Return to ABC (1995\u2013present)===\nWPRI was sold to CBS in the spring of 1995, making it a CBS [[owned-and-operated station]] and one of the last such acquisitions prior to the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]]'s [[Westinghouse Broadcasting#Merger with CBS|purchase of the network]] in August of that year. This resulted in the sale of WPRI to [[Clear Channel Communications]] due to a significant signal overlap with [[WBZ-TV]], which had [[1994 United States broadcast television realignment|joined CBS]] back in January of that year as a result of an affiliation agreement that also affected its sister stations, [[KYW-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]] and [[WJZ-TV]] in [[Baltimore]]. As a result, at midnight on September 10, 1995, WPRI reversed the 1977 swap with WLNE and officially rejoined CBS. WLNE then became an ABC affiliate again, and began calling itself '''ABC6'''.<ref name=projo-wlneabc6>{{cite news|last1=O'Brien|first1=Jerry|last2=Katz|first2=Celeste|title=Newport teachers get 10 days to deal|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/projo/access/580919401.html?dids=580919401:580919401&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+09%2C+1995&author=O+Brien%2C+Jerry%3B+Katz%2C+Celeste&pub=The+Providence+Journal&desc=Newport+teachers+get+10+days+to+deal&pqatl=google|accessdate=January 1, 2013|newspaper=[[The Providence Journal]]|date=September 9, 1995}}</ref> CBS sold WPRI to [[Clear Channel Communications]] seven months after Westinghouse's acquisition of CBS was finalized.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of May 4, 2005, WLNE's analog transmitter was knocked off the air due to a faulty section of transmission line on the tower. The transmitter had been running at 80% power due to another unrelated technical problem that occurred approximately two weeks earlier. Although Dish Network [[satellite television|satellite]] and some [[cable television|cable]] systems continued to receive broadcasts through fiber optic connections, [[Terrestrial television|over-the-air]] and DirecTV satellite subscribers were left without a local ABC affiliate (DirecTV gets its signal via antenna).  Some cable providers made special temporary arrangements to carry Boston ABC station WCVB during this outage.

Still, due to the fact it operates from Rehoboth with the other major Rhode Island stations, it now has a signal comparable to WJAR and WPRI for the first time ever.\n\n==Programming==\nAs an ABC affiliate, WLNE runs virtually the entire ABC programming schedule. Effective with the 1995 affiliation switch, Saturday morning [[infomercial]]s were replaced with ABC's Saturday morning program block (currently known as [[Litton's Weekend Adventure]]; that block replaced [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]] in 2011). [[broadcast syndication|Syndicated]] programming on WLNE includes ''[[Access Hollywood]]'', ''[[Inside Edition]]'', ''[[Hot Bench]]'', ''[[Judge Jerry]]'', ''[[25 Words or Less (game show)|25 Words or Less]]'' and ''[[The 700 Club]]'', among others.\n\n===Past programming preemptions and deferrals===\nAs WTEV, the station moderately preempted ABC shows, in most every case a low-rated program. This did not pose as much of a problem, since most viewers could still get the full ABC schedule on Boston's WNAC until 1972, and on WCVB afterward. During afternoon hours, WTEV ran [[animated cartoon|cartoons]] and classic sitcoms, with late nights being devoted to movies.\n\nBeginning in 1980, WLNE ran an afternoon movie from 4:00 to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. By 1982, the station was also running a movie weekdays from 9:00 to 11:00&nbsp;a.m. These movies were run under the ''[[Dialing For Dollars]]'' promotion and were hosted by George Allen for a decade. WLNE also continued to preempt moderate amounts of programming, particularly whatever game show CBS ran at 10:00&nbsp;a.m. (to accommodate the morning movie), as well as [[The CBS Late Movie|late night programming]]. As a result of the preemptions, ''[[Child's Play (game show)|Child's Play]]'', the 1983 version of ''[[Press Your Luck]]'', and ''[[Blackout (game show)|Blackout]]'' never aired on WLNE; the 1986 version of ''[[Card Sharks]]'' did not air on the station until late in the show's run. Other shows, such as ''[[Tattletales]]'' and ''[[Body Language (game show)|Body Language]]'' were tape-delayed and aired in the noon slot, since WLNE did not have a noon news broadcast at that time. Providence area viewers could also watch the preempted shows via WNEV, which was available over-the-air on the Massachusetts side of the market. Throughout much of the 1980s, WLNE was known for running two movies a day.\n\nBy the fall of 1988, WLNE was only running an afternoon movie weekdays and began clearing CBS' 10:00&nbsp;a.m. hour. In the fall of 1989, WLNE dropped CBS' ''[[Guiding Light]]'', moving the movie to 3:00&nbsp;p.m. and adding more syndicated programming in the 5:00&nbsp;p.m. hour; by mid-1990, the afternoon movie was dropped in favor of additional syndicated programming. In the fall of 1990, WLNE dropped the CBS [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s in favor of several movies in that time slot. In 1991, ''Guiding Light'' was reinstated. By 1993, the Saturday morning movies were replaced with educational children's programs and infomercials.\n\nFor many years, WLNE carried the syndicated shows ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'', ''[[Rachael Ray (talk show)|Rachael Ray]]'', ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', ''[[The Insider (TV program)|The Insider]]'', and ''Inside Edition'' from CBS Television Distribution. However, in mid-2009, the station was unable to reach a carriage agreement with the syndicator, successor to [[King World Productions]] and [[Paramount Domestic Television]]. At that time, the station was carrying ''Dr. Phil'', ''Entertainment Tonight'', and ''Inside Edition''. As a result of the situation, the shows were dropped on June 5 and quickly moved to [[WNAC-TV]] (channel 64, and the legal successor to the former WNET).<ref>[[WNAC-TV|WNAC]] (June 29, 2009). \"'Phil', ET, Inside Edition get new home\". {{cite web |url=http://www.foxprovidence.com/dpp/entertainment/television/foxprovidence_dr_phil_et_inside_edition_move_20090629 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 17, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217171613/http://www.foxprovidence.com/dpp/entertainment/television/foxprovidence_dr_phil_et_inside_edition_move_20090629 |archivedate=February 17, 2012  }}</ref> Temporarily put in their place were ''[[Cristina's Court]]'', ''[[Family Court with Judge Penny]]'', a 7:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast, and ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''.<ref>[http://www.tvnewsday.com TVNEWSDAY] (June 5, 2009). \"WLNE Providence Dropping CTD Syndies\".

The Sunday morning public affairs program debuted very early in 1963. Numerous politicians appeared on the show, including two [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]]. In late 2005, [[Truman Taylor]] taped his final show. He is now a featured op-ed columnist for the ''[[Providence Journal]]''. In early 2006, ''ABC6 News On the Record'' replaced ''Truman Taylor'', with Jim Hummel hosting the program until his departure from the station in July 2008. Following his departure, ''On the Record'' was temporarily taken off-the-air and replaced with infomercials.\n\nOn June 19, 2016, WLNE debuted ''In the Arena'', with former Providence mayor Joe Paolino, Jr. as host.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Donnis|first1=Ian|title=Paolino To Host New Sunday Morning Show On ABC6|url=http://ripr.org/post/paolino-host-new-sunday-morning-show-abc6|accessdate=June 17, 2016|work=[[Rhode Island Public Radio]]|date=June 16, 2016}}</ref> A single episode may consist of a traditional one-on-one interview with Paolino and a political figure, or a [[Round table (discussion)|round table]] of political analysts moderated by Paolino.

As WTEV, it was one of the first affiliates of the \"Love Network\" when it was formed in 1968. Local segments had been broadcast from the [[Warwick Mall]] for several years. In 2007, the telethon relocated to the [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel in downtown Providence. In 2008, the telethon was broadcast from [[Twin River Casino]] in [[Lincoln, Rhode Island|Lincoln]]. This is where the current pledge record for the station was established. In total, $755,705 in local donations was raised. Local segments continued to be broadcast from Twin River until 2012, when the telethon became the ''MDA Show of Strength''. The following year, the show began being televised over one national network (ABC, but because of channel 6's ABC affiliation, the new-format show still aired there) and the local segments were discontinued. The final ''Show of Strength'' was broadcast in 2014.\n\nWLNE became the first station in Rhode Island to broadcast a local program in high-definition when it aired [[Bristol's 4th of July Parade]] in 2008 live with production facilities provided by Comcast. In 2009, the station won an [[Emmy Award]] for its pre-parade special, ''Reflections of the Fourth: Celebrating Bristol'', from the Boston/New England chapter of the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]].<ref> [http://www.newenglandemmy.org</ref> The 2009 parade was also broadcast in high-definition, simulcast on NewsChannel 5 and [[streaming media|streamed live]] on abc6.com.<ref>[http://www.abc6.com</ref> The parade was not broadcast in 2011 amidst the change in station ownership, but it returned in 2012.

Operated by WLNE (until 2012) and Cox Communications, it was the first and only 24-hour local news channel in the state. It provided non-stop news 24 hours a day, seven days a week, mainly consisting of rebroadcasts of news that aired on WLNE. The station could only be found on Cox Cable channel 5 in Rhode Island. NewsChannel 5 also provided live, continuing coverage of breaking news and other events. When severe weather struck, the WLNE weather team provided up to the minute forecasts.\n\nPrior to Citadel Communications' acquisition of WLNE, there were three live newscasts that aired exclusively on NewsChannel 5. From its launch, a weekend morning newscast was seen exclusively on the station. As of May 2011, this newscast was also broadcast on the main channel. On September 29, 2008, WLNE began offering an extra hour of local news on weekday mornings at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. An extended hour of ''Good Morning Providence'' was one of two 7 o'clock local newscasts in the market, the other being an extended hour of WPRI's ''Eyewitness News This Morning'' on WNAC-TV. This newscast was no longer broadcast as of May 2011. WLNE occasionally aired a 10 o'clock newscast during major news events or when sports programming preempted the 10 o'clock news on competitor WNAC. As of May 2011, this newscast no longer aired.\n\nFor a brief period in September 2009, an audio feed of NewsChannel 5 was broadcast on radio station [[WALE (Rhode Island)|WALE]] in various timeslots; this included a start-to-finish simulcast of the ''Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon''. On February 1, 2012, WLNE's affiliation with Cox channel 5 ended, and its programming on the channel was replaced with WJAR programming and is now [[Ocean State Networks]] (OSN).<ref name=wlne-rinewschannel5>{{cite web|title=Cox No Longer Airing ABC6 News on Rhode Island News Channel 5|url=http://www.abc6.com/story/16652841/cox-no-longer-airing-abc6-news-on-rhode-island-news-channel-5|work=abc6.com|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==News operation==\n[[File:Super Bowl LII experience reporters.jpg|thumb|right|WLNE reporters at the [[NFL Experience|Super Bowl Experience]] in [[Minnesota]] for [[Super Bowl LII]].]]\nWLNE presently broadcasts 27\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5\u00bd hours each weekday and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays).\n\nFor most of its history, WLNE has placed a distant third in the market, behind WJAR and WPRI. The station has been known for numerous turnovers in format, talent and management over the years for the purpose of increasing its newscast ratings and sales revenue, all having little or no effect. Under Global Broadcasting's ownership, changes in image and news coverage resulted in a marginal ratings increase and for a time, ''ABC6 News'' was promoted as \"New England's Fastest Growing News\". The ratings surge did not last for long. However, on March 29, 2011, WLNE scored its first late news victory in years, finishing number one at 11:00&nbsp;p.m. following the series premiere of network medical drama ''[[Body of Proof]]'', which was filmed entirely in Rhode Island for its first season.\n\nOn October 24, 2007, WLNE announced that infamous former [[List of mayors of Providence, Rhode Island|Providence mayor]] and [[WPRO (AM)|WPRO]] personality Vincent \"Buddy\" Cianci would join the station as chief political analyst and contributing editor starting on November 1.<ref>[http://www.abc6.com abc6.com] (October 24, 2007). \"ABC6 names \"Buddy\" Cianci Chief Political Analyst & Contributing Editor\".</ref> Cianci was a political analyst at WLNE in the late 1980s. As part of his duties at the station, he moderated a daily segment on ''ABC6 News''. It was first entitled ''Your Attention Please'' and was co-moderated in-studio by former Chief Reporter Jim Hummel. Following Hummel's departure from the station in July 2008, it was changed to ''Buddy TV'' and weeknight anchor John DeLuca became co-moderator. The segment aired live during the former ''ABC6 News First At Four'' with Cianci first appearing in-studio and then from the [[East Providence, Rhode Island|East Providence]] studios of WPRO, where the segment was simulcast during his weekday show that aired from 2:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. In October 2008, he started co-hosting the Sunday morning public affairs program ''ABC6 News On the Record'' with DeLuca. With the change in station ownership in May 2011, the segment name was changed to ''The World According to Buddy'' with a solo Cianci in the ABC6 studios. The segment was taped live during the noon newscasts and re-aired during the 5 o'clock news. He also became a solo host of ''On the Record''. On June 25, 2014, Cianci announced that he would be seeking a third term as mayor of Providence as an Independent candidate. As a result, he had to step down from his position at WLNE as well as WPRO for the duration of the campaign. Former chief political reporter [[Mark Curtis (broadcaster)|Mark Curtis]] took over as host of the program while Cianci campaigned for office. He lost the bid to Democrat [[Jorge Elorza]] and returned to his previous positions shortly after the 2014 general elections. On January 27, 2016, Cianci was taken from the WLNE studios to [[Miriam Hospital]] after falling ill during the taping of ''On the Record'' and was pronounced dead on January 28 at age 74..<ref name=wlne-ciancidead>{{cite web|title=Vincent \"Buddy\" Cianci dies at 74|url=http://ww.abc6.com/story/31075183/breaking-vincent-buddy-cianci-has-died|website=abc6.com|accessdate=January 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131201824/http://ww.abc6.com/story/31075183/breaking-vincent-buddy-cianci-has-died|archive-date=January 31, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The episode did not make air, with a special on Cianci airing in its timeslot on January 31.<ref name=projo-wlnecianci>{{cite news|last1=Catanzaro|first1=Mikki|title=WLNE-TV to air Cianci special Sunday in late mayor's timeslot|url=http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20160128/wlne-tv-to-air-cianci-special-sunday-in-late-mayors-timeslot|accessdate=January 28, 2016|work=Providence Journal|date=January 28, 2016}}</ref> The Sunday morning public affairs program was then put on hiatus.\n\nOn December 17, 2007, WLNE announced it would launch ''ABC6 News First At Four'', the [[media market|market]]'s first-ever 4 o'clock news on January 14, 2008. Described as a \"hard newscast\" and not morning-show style fluff, ''First At Four'' gave WLNE a head start in coverage of weather and politics. This newscast aired for just over three years and competed head to head with ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' airing on WJAR. ''First At Four'' last aired in April 2011 prior to the transfer of station ownership. In May 2009, WLNE launched a 10 o'clock newscast on Sunday mornings. Previously, it had only produced weekend morning newscasts for ''NewsChannel 5''. It was the only Providence station with a local news broadcast airing at that time. In May 2011, the new owners moved the newscast to 7:30&nbsp;a.m. and added Saturday morning broadcasts in addition to Sunday mornings. The weekend morning newscasts were cancelled in 2012. In June 2009, the station launched the market's first (since the 1980s) 7 o'clock newscast on weeknights, filling the spot vacated by ''Entertainment Tonight'', which was taken off the schedule due to the station's dispute with CBS Television Distribution. In March 2011, this newscast was replaced with infomercials, with the newscast airing only in the event they could not sell the time slot on a given day.<ref name=wlne7pmbrainfomercial>{{cite news|last=Gauthier|first=Andrew|title=Providence\u2019s WLNE Airs Bra Infomercial in Place of 7:00&nbsp;pm Newscast|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvspy/providences-wlne-airs-bra-infomercial-in-place-of-7-p-m-newscast_b7751|accessdate=May 5, 2011|newspaper=TVSpy|date=March 16, 2011}}</ref> After the station's sale to Citadel, this newscast was officially replaced with syndicated programming the following month.\n\nOn April 5, 2011, WLNE announced a new programming lineup that included the addition of a 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast on April 25.<ref name=WLNE040511/> On September 13, WLNE became the second station in the market to broadcast news in high-definition, behind WJAR and just a week ahead of WPRI/WNAC.<ref name=tvspy-wlnehd>{{cite news|last=Gauthier|first=Andrew|title=WLNE Now Broadcasting News in HD|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvspy/wlne-now-broadcasting-news-in-hd_b23426|accessdate=September 29, 2011|newspaper=TVSpy|date=September 28, 2011}}</ref> Along with the transition came a standardized graphics package used by other Citadel stations. The station received the company's standardized news set in August 2012. In January 2013, the station began streaming its newscasts to mobile devices via the Syncbak<ref>http://www.syncbak.com</ref> app for a 1-year period. Also, all reporters in the field work as [[Video journalism|multimedia journalists]] who shoot and edit their stories in addition to writing and presenting them. They also manage their own live shots through the use of mobile streaming \"backpacks\" manufactured by [[TVUnetworks]].\n\nIn weather segments, WLNE uses live regional radar from the [[National Weather Service]] local office in [[Taunton, Massachusetts]], along with high-resolution satellite. The segments are presented on-air under the Stormtracker label. From 2012 to 2017, the Stormtracker Weather Team was certified as providing Southern New England's most accurate forecast by  WeatheRate], an independent weather research firm.<ref>[http://www.weatherate.com/</ref> On July 19, 2012, WLNE became the first station in Southern New England to be recognized as [[StormReady]] by the National Weather Service.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC6/WLNE-TV  RECOGNIZED BY THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE|url=http://ww.abc6.com/story/19066733/abc6-recognized-by-the-national-weather-service|accessdate=July 19, 2012|newspaper=abc6.com|date=July 19, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714202218/http://ww.abc6.com/story/19066733/abc6-recognized-by-the-national-weather-service|archive-date=July 14, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWLNE won the Massachusetts/Rhode Island [[Associated Press]] News Station of the Year award four years in a row from 1997 to 2000 and again in 2002.

The Romans built a bath at the location of the main thermal spring. In the late 17th-century Cornelius White operated bathing facilities at the hot spring at the site of the [[Old Hall Hotel|Buxton Old Hall]]. In 1695 he discovered an ancient smooth stone bath (20m long by 7m wide) as well as a lead cistern (2m square) on an oak timber frame. When the [[Buxton Crescent|Crescent]] hotel was built on the site in 1780, a Roman bath was identified and described as \u2018a leaden cistern'. The bath is now buried beneath the Crescent, next to the Natural Mineral Baths building that was constructed next to the hotel. Near to the site of the main spring, excavations in 2005 revealed the entry passage and doorways to the Roman baths. During this construction work, a wall believed to be the side of a [[palaestra]] (exercise hall) was also uncovered. Between 2009 and 2012 further underground cisterns and a large iron cauldron were revealed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitedragon.org.uk/articles/amemetiae.htm|title=The chequered history of a holy well|website=www.whitedragon.org.uk|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Shepherd|first=Brian|title=Roman Buxton - A tourist guide to the town and spa baths|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780956185570|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wondersofthepeak.org.uk/facts/roman-buxton-enchanted-springs-and-hot-baths/|title=Roman Buxton \u2013 Enchanted Springs and Hot Baths|website=www.wondersofthepeak.org.uk|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nThe main spring was excavated in the 1970s and a hoard of 232 Roman coins was found, spanning 300 years of the Roman occupation of Britain.

At the same time Rooke also documented details of the base of a temple in the same area, overlooking the site of the baths and springs. The temple was dedicated to the water deity Arnemetia. It had a shrine room set on a rectangular podium, with a columned [[portico]] at the front. The Roman floor plan of a [[macellum]] (covered market with a central atrium) and floor mosaics were documented in 1860, on the west side of Buxton's market place near Fountain Street.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://buxtonmuseumandartgallery.wordpress.com/2019/03/15/sacred-waters-and-altars/|title=Sacred Waters and Altars|last=|first=|date=15 March 2019|website=Buxton Museum and Art Gallery|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAn ancient Celtic temple, at the site of the Bath Gardens, was described in 1755 as having an octagonal base and a feint inscription appearing as 'Aeona'.

The Street is still the name of the road in the Upper Goyt Valley that would have connected Buxton with [[Condate (Britain)|Condate]] (Roman [[Northwich]]). There is plaque in a stone wall by The Street road near Arbor Low (at OS map location SK 1649 6232).

[[Arnemetia]] was the [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] goddess of the sacred grove (the name Arnemetia was derived from the Celtic for beside the sacred grove).<ref>Miranda J. Green.

The Romans built a bath at the location of the main thermal spring. In the late 17th-century Cornelius White operated bathing facilities at the hot spring at the site of the [[Old Hall Hotel|Buxton Old Hall]]. In 1695 he discovered an ancient smooth stone bath (20m long by 7m wide) as well as a lead cistern (2m square) on an oak timber frame. When the [[Buxton Crescent|Crescent]] hotel was built on the site in 1780, a Roman bath was identified and described as \u2018a leaden cistern'. The bath is now buried beneath the Crescent, next to the Natural Mineral Baths building that was constructed next to the hotel. Near to the site of the main spring, excavations in 2005 revealed the entry passage and doorways to the Roman baths. During this construction work, a wall believed to be the side of a [[palaestra]] (exercise hall) was also uncovered. Between 2009 and 2012 further underground cisterns and a large iron cauldron were revealed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitedragon.org.uk/articles/amemetiae.htm|title=The chequered history of a holy well|website=www.whitedragon.org.uk|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Shepherd|first=Brian|title=Roman Buxton - A tourist guide to the town and spa baths|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780956185570|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wondersofthepeak.org.uk/facts/roman-buxton-enchanted-springs-and-hot-baths/|title=Roman Buxton \u2013 Enchanted Springs and Hot Baths|website=www.wondersofthepeak.org.uk|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nThe main spring was excavated in the 1970s and a hoard of Roman coins was found, spanning 300 years of the Roman occupation of Britain.

At the same time Rooke also documented details of the base of a temple in the same area, overlooking the site of the baths and springs. The temple was dedicated to the water deity Arnemetia. It had a shrine room set on a rectangular podium, with a columned [[portico]] at the front. The Roman floor plan of a [[macellum]] (covered market with a central atrium) and floor mosaics were documented in 1860, on the west side of Buxton's market place near Fountain Street.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://buxtonmuseumandartgallery.wordpress.com/2019/03/15/sacred-waters-and-altars/|title=Sacred Waters and Altars|last=|first=|date=15 March 2019|website=Buxton Museum and Art Gallery|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAn ancient Celtic temple, at the site of the Bath Gardens, was described in 1755 as having an octagonal base and a feint inscription appearing as 'Aeona'.
