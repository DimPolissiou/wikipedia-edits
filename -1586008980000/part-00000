She decides the best way to figure it out is to use the Public Security Maintenance Bureau's super computer. The next day, Sherry and Elsworth set off a dummy bomb at HQ, causing everyone to evacuate. When they lock the building down, Yusei and Bruno are left inside, and they soon discover the two. As Bruno follows after Sherry, Elsworth blocks Yusei off, and challenges him to a duel. Elsworth summons his Driven Daredevil, which does great damage to Yusei during his counterattack. Sherry reaches the main computer, hoping to find out the meaning behind her card, but starts fighting Bruno when he shows up. Just then, Bruno's eyes start glowing red and he overpowers Sherry. Noticing her card, he stops attacking and helps her to analyze it. Yusei summons Stardust Dragon and beats Elsworth with a counter trap, and the two catch up to Sherry and Bruno. As the card is scanned, purple clouds form in the sky and Sherry, Bruno, and Yusei are caught in the blast. They find themselves in a strange white room where they are scanned painfully by Z-ONE, and then pass out from the pain. Afterwards, the computer room self destructs. As Sector Security find the super computer destroyed, the others wake up on the docks, minus Sherry.

Crow is later approached by Trudge and Mina, who believe Pearson's death was caused by a duelist using a card called, Crimson Mephist, that dealt real damage, and sent people to the Netherworld. Crow goes to see another of his old friends, Bolton, to ask about the accident. Bolton agrees to talk, but only if Crow duels him, wanting the Black-Winged Dragon card he needs for a loan should he win, even though Crow doesn't know where it is.

They discuss things about Yliaster, and how recent events have been related to them. Sherry reveals they are being targeted by Yliaster, due to them being Signers (not including Sherry). She also talks about the strange experience that she, Yusei, and Bruno had experienced back at Sector Security. After Sherry leaves, Bruno feels weird, and goes to the beach where he washed up upon.

After studying a video Carly gave them, the Signers believe it to be linked to a monster called Hidden Knight Hook. Akiza gets hit by the same phenomenon, and her psychic powers fail, as she loses it, to save her from getting injured. (And, Akiza's psychic powers don't return until ''Episode 140'', after the Ark Cradle appears.) Despite his arm not being fully healed, Crow decides to take her place in their match against Team Catastrophe. The first round sees Crow against Hermann, who instantly summons Hidden Knight Hook.

His arm at the peak of his pain, Crow passes the duel on to Jack, who begins the next round against Nicholas. Nicholas uses another Card of Darkness, a trap intended to knock both of them out, however it hurts both of them, as Primo has no more use for Nicholas, and allowed his protection against the Card of Darkness to expire. Jack escapes defeat, thanks to his monster's special ability, and rescues Nicholas before he crashes. With Nicholas' Duel Runner destroyed, Team 5D's automatically qualifies for the quarterfinals.

Primo becomes agitated and joins the duel himself. Bruno teaches Yusei about Accel Synchro, about how Ener-D powers through people's hearts and the Clear Mind that can control it. Taking these things into account, Yusei accelerates to top speed and is able to see a new monster. Bruno, who had lost his memory after previously battling Primo, stays behind to duel him again. Meanwhile, Yusei arrives at a crater, where another stone tablet has landed. Upon touching it, he is transported to the white room he had gone to before, and receives an Accel Synchro card. Upon seeing that Yusei had received a tablet from Z-ONE, Lester panics and tells Jakob that since the tablet didn't belong to any one of them, he asks him what is going on. Lester also becomes jealous and upset, because only the Emperors of Yliaster were supposed to receive tablets, but Yusei was only a \"puny human,\" and Lester refuses to believe that Yusei was as special as they were. But Jakob remains silent and continues watching the duel. Primo brings out his Machine Emperor Wisel Infinity, and Bruno summons the materials for his Accel Synchro, but is hindered by the arrival of the Ghosts. After learning that Yusei had received a tablet, Jakob warns Primo not to duel Yusei, as he cannot guarantee him victory this time, with Lester presaging evidence. Then, Jakob demands Primo to return at once. Having been fed up by his partners bossing him around, Primo bangs his hand against his viewscreen, and cuts of the communication, which causes Jakob to shout, \"But, Primo--!\" Seeing that Primo had disobeyed orders again, Jakob tells Lester that the outcome of this duel \"''is the will of God''.\" Yusei arrives and challenges Primo who is revealed to be a cyborg, transforms and combines with his Duel Runner.

Remembering the destruction caused by the original Ener-D reactor spun in reverse, Yusei screams, \"Stop,\" and rams Primo's duel runner. Startled, he loses concentration and the destruction stops. Frustrated, he calls Yusei \"inferior.\" When Yusei demands Primo to resume the duel, Primo rides up besides Yusei, and then activates his own battle Royale Mode. Yusei begins his duel with Primo by summoning out Junk Destroyer and manages to deal some damage. Primo becomes furious, and gets his Machine Emperor Wisel to create another field of energy, which results in lightning bolts striking everywhere in New Domino City, causing electrical devices to fail. Yusei manages to stop Primo absorbing Junk Destroyer by replacing it with Stardust Dragon, before sacrificing it to deal more damage. Primo then replaces one of his Wisel parts with Skiel parts stolen from Lester. When Lester realizes that Primo stole 2 of his cards, by watching the duel, he becomes furious, and curses Primo for taking his cards without his permission. Yusei tries to perform an Accel Synchro with Stardust Dragon and a Synchro Tuner, but Primo's words breaks his concentration, making him unable to perform it, allowing Wisel to absorb Stardust Dragon.\n| LineColor       = 015E80\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (season 4)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 109\n| Title           = Primo's Plan, Part 4 / Accel Synchro!

Primo uses his Machine Emperor to start a tornado to affect the city, also putting a child named Haruka in danger, but Akiza manages to save her without using her psychic powers. Then, Primo has Wisel create another field of energy, this one to torture Yusei, panting, and in pain, the marks of the other Signers reflect the pain that Yusei is feeling. Regaining his determination and clearing his mind, Yusei finally manages to perform an Accel Synchro, and summons Shooting Star Dragon, which flies into the tornado, and disperses it, and then flies up into the sky to shine its light on New Domino City.

Yusei uses Shooting Star Dragon's special ability, which allows him to once-per turn, draw the top 5 cards of his deck, and Shooting Star Dragon can attack the number of times equal to the number of tuner monster cards drawn. Yusei then takes the marks of the Signers, which allows him to draw 5 tuner monster cards, one per mark (including his own). Yusei then gains the Seal of the Crimson Dragon, with the result of Yusei's lucky draws shocking Primo. When Yusei attacks, Primo manages to block the first 2 attacks by sacrificing Wisel Guard, but the remaining 3 attacks causes him to lose. Primo is unable to believe it, and questions if he was being done in by a human. Then, the rest of Machine Emperor Wisel collapse onto Primo and explode, causing Primo to scream as he loses the rest of his life points. Having been defeated, Primo crashes into the wall on the dueling lane, and his body splits off his duel runner, and he falls into a coma. Jack, Crow, Yusei and Vizor find themselves facing Lester and Jakob, who reveal themselves to be the emperors of Yliaster, who have come to pick up Primo, in order to have him repaired by Z-ONE.

Meanwhile, Greiger comes to a conclusion that the actions of him and Max were those of the Crimson Devil. Jack, seemingly in a trance, goes into a temple that Greiger had built, leading him to where the Familiar challenges him to a duel. Yusei and company try to follow but are stopped from interfering by the Familiar, who reveals that if Jack loses, his body will become a host to the Crimson Devil, and cuts them off from Jack by creating a very narrow platform, and seals off the only exit. The Familiar announces that he, Greiger, and Max will all become sacrifices to the Crimson Devil.

The legendary Signer used the power of Blazing Soul alongside the Crimson Dragon and defeated Scar-Red Nova; Greiger believes Jack to be his descendant. Jack starts to play more strategically and deals more damage to the Familiar. The Familiar becomes angry and summons a powerful monster, bringing the release of Scar-Red Nova closer. Just then, Jack produces a Blazing Soul and, with the help of the Crimson Dragon, also known as Quetzalcoatl, uses a blank card to seal the Crimson Devil forever into Red Dragon Archfiend, and he performs a \"Double Tuning\" on Red Dragon Archfiend to summon a new monster, Scar-Red Nova Dragon. Then, Jack uses Scar-Red Nova Dragon's \"Blazing Soul\" attack to defeat the Familiar, who is later killed by a collapsing wall during the destruction of the temple, due to the power of the dragon's attack. With the help of the Crimson Dragon, everyone manages to escape the temple safely, and Jack and Yusei return home with their new powers of Clear Mind, and Blazing Soul.\n| LineColor       = 015E80\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (season 4)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 114\n| Title           = Operation Capture Lazar II\n| TranslitTitle   = Y\u0113g\u0101 Hokaku Sakusen Ts\u016b\n| NativeTitle     = \u30a4\u30a7\u30fc\u30ac\u30fc\u6355\u7372\u4f5c\u6226II\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| WrittenBy       = Toshifumi Kawase\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|6|16}}\n| AltDate         = N/A\n| ShortSummary    = Yusei and the others catch Lazar in disguise stealing some instant noodles.

Wanting to learn more, they sneak into Clark's office to obtain an access key for Level 10 clearance. When Clark returns, Yusei holds him off by challenging him to a duel with some new rules Clark throws in whilst Sherry and Bruno head for the restricted area. Clark's duel requires players to declare the type of card they want and successfully pick the right one in order to use it. However, Clark gains an advantage by cheating using his glasses. Realizing this, Yusei manages to summon Stardust Dragon and defeats him. However, Clark had already figured out their identities and sets off the alarm.

He sends Yusei, Sherry and Bruno into a wormhole, in which they are doomed to break up and crash. Sherry uses her card to regain control of the shuttle, but ends up getting sucked out. Yusei and Bruno enter a \"warped\" dimension in the future, and pass by a strange island (a gigantic, floating, upside-down \"metallic fortress\", the ''Ark Cradle''), where Yusei is briefly visited again by his father, who warns him of an Ener-D that will destroy mankind, before returning him and Bruno to their homeworld (the Present). Unhappy with Clark's actions, Yliaster erases Clark from existence, which spreads a blast of white light across New Domino City. Another WRGP team, Team Ragnarok, also notices the blast, but were protected by their Nordic God cards. Yusei and Bruno regroup with the other Signers, who were defended from the blast by their Signer marks. They also spot the strange metallic island, the Ark Cradle, coming through an interdimensional \"hole\" in the sky, which only Signers and people from Team Ragnarok can see, along with people that come into physical contact with them. When they try returning to the Ener-D Express, they discover that it has disappeared (as Yliaster's actions have also erased that company from existence). They later return to find the Yliaster trio joining the WRGP, and that Sherry's team had vanished from the roster (in other words, Sherry was \"kicked out\" of the WRGP, with Yliaster replacing her team), coming to the conclusion that Yliaster had managed to alter history. When Trudge and Mina inform the others that the WRGP may be cancelled following the recent incidents, Lazar decides to take the position of director in order to overturn the situation. Meanwhile, Sherry wakes up in a strange dimension where she meets a strange being in the form of her father, who is really Z-ONE who has taken the form of her father, offers to show her the future of the world. Z-ONE warns Sherry that seeing the future would change her destiny forever (because the vision would convince her to join Z-ONE), but Sherry replies that she doesn't care, and that she still wants to see the future, as she states that knowing the future ahead of time would benefit her, and her friends. Then, Z-ONE proceeds to show her the future.\n| LineColor       = 015E80\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (season 4)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 118\n| Title           = The New Rivals\n| TranslitTitle   = Aratanaru Raibaru\n| NativeTitle     = \u65b0\u305f\u306a\u308b\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30eb\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| WrittenBy       = Yoshifumi Fukushima\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|7|14}}\n| AltDate         = N/A\n| ShortSummary    = After reading up on Team Ragnarok, Leo runs into another WRGP team, Team Taiyo, and injures his knee.

Now that all 3 of the Aesirs Cards have been removed from play, Yusei then has Shooting Star Dragon attack Halldor directly, allowing Yusei to win.\n| LineColor       = 015E80\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (season 4)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 130\n| Title           = Bound To The Future, Bonds To Our Companions\n| TranslitTitle   = Mirai he Tsunagu, Nakama tono Kizuna\n| NativeTitle     = \u672a\u6765\u3078\u3064\u306a\u3050\u3001\u4ef2\u9593\u3068\u306e\u7d46\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| WrittenBy       = Shin Yoshida\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|10|6}}\n| AltDate         = N/A\n| ShortSummary    = Team 5D's have finally beaten Team Ragnarok after an exhausting battle. With this result, the World Racing Grand Prix (WRGP)'s finals will be Team 5D's Vs. Team New World (the 3 emperors of Yliaster). With the finals looming, Carly ponders the possible outcomes of the upcoming battle, while she writes up her special feature article about Team 5D's. While performing the interview, Akiza and company accidentally reconfirm their bonds. Noticing Carly's struggle to write up an article about Team 5D's, not helped by Mina's interference, Akiza, Luna and Leo decide to help her write profiles for each member, recalling on their past adventures. In addition, when Carly talks to Akiza, they discuss the relation of their new opponents, Team New World, to the organization of Yliaster, and the trio's schemes, causing Carly to gain unthinkable information. When Carly was finished typing all of the information down, Stephanie comes in with a teapot full of hot coffee. She trips on a wire and the coffee spills all over the computer, erasing all of the files, which ruins Carly's report.\n| LineColor       = 015E80\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (season 4)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 131\n| Title           = The Beginning of the End / Fight for the Future!

Then, Z-ONE brings Sherry into the Ark Cradle, which is already emerging into the [[Yu-Gi-Oh!]] dimension. That night, the Signers are messaged by the Three Emperors of Yliaster, who tell them about the floating metallic island, the Ark Cradle, where a God called Yliadus (Z-ONE's real name) supposedly sleeps, stating that if they win the WRGP, then Yliadus will awaken and have New Domino City destroyed, but will rebuild it the way the trio wants it to be, which is without the existence of Ener-D and Synchro Monsters. During the next morning, the WRGP finals begin with Jack facing off against Lester, who both bring out their ace monsters, Red Nova Dragon and Machine Emperor Skiel Infinity. But then, Lester activates the continuous trap, Infinite Spirit Machine, which gains a Spirit Machine Counter for every 100 points of damage he takes. Jack manages to defeat Skiel and beat Lester, though he leaves behind some traps cards, and the strange continuous trap, Infinite Spirit Machine, for both Primo, and Jakob to use. But before Lester loses, he activates another continuous trap, Infinite Prison, which allows him to send a card in his hand to the Graveyard, to treat Sky Core as a spell card from the Graveyard, and set it face-down in the face-down zone.\n| LineColor       = 015E80\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (season 4)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 132\n| Title           = Dawn of the Machines / A Violent Assault!!

Seeing that Primo was acting on his own again, when Primo activates 2 traps he left for Jakob, Lester get agitated, but when Jakob reminded Primo of their plan, Primo decided to try something different. Yusei realizes their tactic is based on the continuous trap that Lester left behind, but when Jack tries to destroy it, Primo protects it with a trap card, and gets beaten by Jack. But before he loses, Primo then activates another of Lester's continuous traps, Infinite Prison. By sending Wisel Attack 3 to the Graveyard, he can then treat Wise Core as a spell card from the Graveyard, and set it face-down in the face-down zone. Jack then faces Jakob, who brings out Machine Emperor Grannel Infinity, and uses a trap to destroy Infinite Spirit Machine, in order to give himself a total of 12,000 life points, which in turn becomes Grannel's attack points, due to Grannel's special ability. Then, Jakob has Machine Emperor Grannel Infinity destroy and absorb Red Nova Dragon from the Graveyard, which raises Grannel's attack points to 15,500, with the attack knocking Jack off a bridge.\n| LineColor       = 015E80\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (season 4)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 133\n| Title           = Against All Odds / The Looming Threat!

Jakob then activates a trap, which brings out Grannel Attack 3, while reducing Yusei's life points to 2,800. Jakob shows Yusei and the others a twisted future where New Domino City is completely destroyed. Due to Synchro Monsters and Ener-D evolving the world at an incredible rate, a war broke out and the Ener-D reactor eventually exploded, destroying most of the world. The Yliaster trio also unveil their memories of despair. 200 into the future, they see everybody Synchro Summoning, and as a result of them using Synchro Monsters to achieve their own greedy desires, the Machine Emperors show up one day, and begin killing humans. In the vision, as Lester was running with his parents to safety, a Grannel shot his parents down. Lester in the vision, then wails at the death of his parents, the ones who loved him. Then, Primo reveals that he joined the Freedom Fighters, a group of military people who destroy Machine Emperors, to restore freedom to mankind. He also reveals that he fell in love with one of their number, Eurea Pastel, and they often fought together. When they ambush another Grannel, it retaliates, by shooting down the building, killing his girlfriend in the process. Primo then cries over her death, and when the Grannel comes to kill him, he angrily shoots it down. Jakob then reveals that he was the \"last survivor\" of the Machine Emperor attack. He then says that he tried for years to find other humans, but to no avail. In the future, Jakob then sheds some tears over the destruction of humankind. Back in the duel, although the Yliaster trio said that the events the Signers just saw were their memories of humanity's destruction, Yusei refuses to believe that any of it was true. Yusei then brings out Shooting Star Dragon, and manages to destroy Machine Emperor Grannel Infinity, which reduces Jakob's life points from 12,000 down to 3,900. Just then, Jakob activates the Yliaster trio's infinity patches, and then the sky glows red, and a huge green infinity symbol appears in the sky. Jakob, Primo, and Lester then get launched into the sky, towards the huge green infinity. Then, they fuse together to form the true Emperor of Yliaster, Aporia, who is the true form of the Yliaster trio, and then the green infinity disappears. As Yusei questions what is going on in disbelief, Aporia answers, \"''I am Aporia''.\"\n(Lester is Aporia's childhood counterpart, Primo his late teenage one, and Jakob his form during his old age. \"Aporia\" is the mid-age adult counterpart, who appears at the peak of his life, formed only by the 3 other counterparts fusing.)\n| LineColor       = 015E80\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Yu-Gi-Oh!}}\n\n[[Category:2010 Japanese television seasons]]\n[[Category:2011 Japanese television seasons]]\n[[Category:Yu-Gi-Oh! seasons|5D's (season 4)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2019}}\n{{Infobox television season\n| season_name   = ''Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (season 4):<br> Road to Destiny''\n| season_number = 4\n| bgcolour      = #015E80\n| image         = Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Box Set 11.jpg\n| image_upright = 1.2\n| caption       = \n| country       = [[Japan]]\n| network       = [[TV Tokyo]]\n| first_aired   = {{Start date|2010|1|20}}\n| last_aired    = {{End date|2010|11|10}}\n| num_episodes  = 42 (only 29 dubbed)\n| episode_list  = List of Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's episodes\n}}\nThe fourth season of '''''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]''''' lasts from episodes 93 to 134 (with the title '''''Road to Destiny''''', in the English dub). As the WRGP begins (known as the \"''World Racing Grand Prix''\" in the English dub, while known as the \"''World Riding Duel Grand Prix''\" in the Japanese version), the 3 Emperors of Yliaster begin to make their move. The show uses seven pieces of theme music. For episodes 93 through 103, the opening theme is \"Freedom\" by La Vie, while the ending theme is 'O-Zone' by [[Vistlip]].

She decides the best way to figure it out is to use the Public Security Maintenance Bureau's super computer. The next day, Sherry and Elsworth set off a dummy bomb at HQ, causing everyone to evacuate. When they lock the building down, Yusei and Bruno are left inside, and they soon discover the two. As Bruno follows after Sherry, Elsworth blocks Yusei off, and challenges him to a duel. Elsworth summons his Driven Daredevil, which does great damage to Yusei during his counterattack. Sherry reaches the main computer, hoping to find out the meaning behind her card, but starts fighting Bruno when he shows up. Just then, Bruno's eyes start glowing red and he overpowers Sherry. Noticing her card, he stops attacking and helps her to analyze it. Yusei summons Stardust Dragon and beats Elsworth with a counter trap, and the two catch up to Sherry and Bruno. As the card is scanned, purple clouds form in the sky and Sherry, Bruno, and Yusei are caught in the blast. They find themselves in a strange white room where they are scanned painfully by Z-ONE, and then pass out from the pain. Afterwards, the computer room self destructs. As Sector Security find the super computer destroyed, the others wake up on the docks, minus Sherry. Yusei suspects that this may be the work of Yliaster.\n| LineColor       = 015E80\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (season 4)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 94\n| Title           = Keeping a Promise, Part 1 / Recollections: Entrusted with a Friend's Dying Wish\n| TranslitTitle   = Tsuioku H\u014dy\u016b ga Takushita Ishi\n| NativeTitle     = \u8ffd\u61b6\u3000\u670b\u53cb\u304c\u8a17\u3057\u305f\u907a\u5fd7\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| WrittenBy       = Yoshifumi Fukushima\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|1|27}}\n| AltDate         = February 26, 2011\n| ShortSummary    = Crow goes to visit the grave of Robert Pearson, the original owner of Crow's Blackwing Deck and the Blackbird (Crow's duel runner), who died in an unusual purple fire three years ago.

Crow is later approached by Trudge and Mina, who believe Pearson's death was caused by a duelist using a card called, Crimson Mephist, that dealt real damage, and sent people to the Netherworld. Crow goes to see another of his old friends, Bolton, to ask about the accident. Bolton agrees to talk, but only if Crow duels him, wanting the Black-Winged Dragon card he needs for a loan should he win, even though Crow doesn't know where it is.

They discuss things about Yliaster, and how recent events have been related to them. Sherry reveals they are being targeted by Yliaster, due to them being Signers (not including Sherry). She also talks about the strange experience that she, Yusei, and Bruno had experienced back at Sector Security. After Sherry leaves, Bruno feels weird, and goes to the beach where he washed up upon.

After studying a video Carly gave them, the Signers believe it to be linked to a monster called Hidden Knight Hook. Akiza gets hit by the same phenomenon, and her psychic powers fail, as she loses it, to save her from getting injured. (And, Akiza's psychic powers don't return until ''Episode 140'', after the Ark Cradle appears.) Despite his arm not being fully healed, Crow decides to take her place in their match against Team Catastrophe. The first round sees Crow against Hermann, who instantly summons Hidden Knight Hook.

His arm at the peak of his pain, Crow passes the duel on to Jack, who begins the next round against Nicholas. Nicholas uses another Card of Darkness, a trap intended to knock both of them out, however it hurts both of them, as Primo has no more use for Nicholas, and allowed his protection against the Card of Darkness to expire. Jack escapes defeat, thanks to his monster's special ability, and rescues Nicholas before he crashes. With Nicholas' Duel Runner destroyed, Team 5D's automatically qualifies for the quarterfinals.

Primo becomes agitated and joins the duel himself. Bruno teaches Yusei about Accel Synchro, about how Ener-D powers through people's hearts and the Clear Mind that can control it. Taking these things into account, Yusei accelerates to top speed and is able to see a new monster. Bruno, who had lost his memory after previously battling Primo, stays behind to duel him again. Meanwhile, Yusei arrives at a crater, where another stone tablet has landed. Upon touching it, he is transported to the white room he had gone to before, and receives an Accel Synchro card. Upon seeing that Yusei had received a tablet from Z-ONE, Lester panics and tells Jakob that since the tablet didn't belong to any one of them, he asks him what is going on. Lester also becomes jealous and upset, because only the Emperors of Yliaster were supposed to receive tablets, but Yusei was only a \"puny human,\" and Lester refuses to believe that Yusei was as special as they were. But Jakob remains silent and continues watching the duel. Primo brings out his Machine Emperor Wisel Infinity, and Bruno summons the materials for his Accel Synchro, but is hindered by the arrival of the Ghosts. After learning that Yusei had received a tablet, Jakob warns Primo not to duel Yusei, as he cannot guarantee him victory this time, with Lester presaging evidence. Then, Jakob demands Primo to return at once. Having been fed up by his partners bossing him around, Primo bangs his hand against his viewscreen, and cuts of the communication, which causes Jakob to shout, \"But, Primo--!\" Seeing that Primo had disobeyed orders again, Jakob tells Lester that the outcome of this duel \"''is the will of God''.\" Yusei arrives and challenges Primo who is revealed to be a cyborg, transforms and combines with his Duel Runner.

Remembering the destruction caused by the original Ener-D reactor spun in reverse, Yusei screams, \"Stop,\" and rams Primo's duel runner. Startled, he loses concentration and the destruction stops. Frustrated, he calls Yusei \"inferior.\" When Yusei demands Primo to resume the duel, Primo rides up besides Yusei, and then activates his own battle Royale Mode. Yusei begins his duel with Primo by summoning out Junk Destroyer and manages to deal some damage. Primo becomes furious, and gets his Machine Emperor Wisel to create another field of energy, which results in lightning bolts striking everywhere in New Domino City, causing electrical devices to fail. Yusei manages to stop Primo absorbing Junk Destroyer by replacing it with Stardust Dragon, before sacrificing it to deal more damage. Primo then replaces one of his Wisel parts with Skiel parts stolen from Lester. When Lester realizes that Primo stole 2 of his cards, by watching the duel, he becomes furious, and curses Primo for taking his cards without his permission. Yusei tries to perform an Accel Synchro with Stardust Dragon and a Synchro Tuner, but Primo's words breaks his concentration, making him unable to perform it, allowing Wisel to absorb Stardust Dragon.\n| LineColor       = 015E80\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (season 4)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 109\n| Title           = Primo's Plan, Part 4 / Accel Synchro!

Primo uses his Machine Emperor to start a tornado to affect the city, also putting a child named Haruka in danger, but Akiza manages to save her without using her psychic powers. Then, Primo has Wisel create another field of energy, this one to torture Yusei, panting, and in pain, the marks of the other Signers reflect the pain that Yusei is feeling. Regaining his determination and clearing his mind, Yusei finally manages to perform an Accel Synchro, and summons Shooting Star Dragon, which flies into the tornado, and disperses it, and then flies up into the sky to shine its light on New Domino City.

Yusei uses Shooting Star Dragon's special ability, which allows him to once-per turn, draw the top 5 cards of his deck, and Shooting Star Dragon can attack the number of times equal to the number of tuner monster cards drawn. Yusei then takes the marks of the Signers, which allows him to draw 5 tuner monster cards, one per mark (including his own). Yusei then gains the Seal of the Crimson Dragon, with the result of Yusei's lucky draws shocking Primo. When Yusei attacks, Primo manages to block the first 2 attacks by sacrificing Wisel Guard, but the remaining 3 attacks causes him to lose. Primo is unable to believe it, and questions if he was being done in by a human. Then, the rest of Machine Emperor Wisel collapse onto Primo and explode, causing Primo to scream as he loses the rest of his life points. Having been defeated, Primo crashes into the wall on the dueling lane, and his body splits off his duel runner, and he falls into a coma. Jack, Crow, Yusei and Vizor find themselves facing Lester and Jakob, who reveal themselves to be the emperors of Yliaster, who have come to pick up Primo, in order to have him repaired by Z-ONE.

Meanwhile, Greiger comes to a conclusion that the actions of him and Max were those of the Crimson Devil. Jack, seemingly in a trance, goes into a temple that Greiger had built, leading him to where the Familiar challenges him to a duel. Yusei and company try to follow but are stopped from interfering by the Familiar, who reveals that if Jack loses, his body will become a host to the Crimson Devil, and cuts them off from Jack by creating a very narrow platform, and seals off the only exit. The Familiar announces that he, Greiger, and Max will all become sacrifices to the Crimson Devil.

The legendary Signer used the power of Blazing Soul alongside the Crimson Dragon and defeated Scar-Red Nova; Greiger believes Jack to be his descendant. Jack starts to play more strategically and deals more damage to the Familiar. The Familiar becomes angry and summons a powerful monster, bringing the release of Scar-Red Nova closer. Just then, Jack produces a Blazing Soul and, with the help of the Crimson Dragon, also known as Quetzalcoatl, uses a blank card to seal the Crimson Devil forever into Red Dragon Archfiend, and he performs a \"Double Tuning\" on Red Dragon Archfiend to summon a new monster, Scar-Red Nova Dragon. Then, Jack uses Scar-Red Nova Dragon's \"Blazing Soul\" attack to defeat the Familiar, who is later killed by a collapsing wall during the destruction of the temple, due to the power of the dragon's attack. With the help of the Crimson Dragon, everyone manages to escape the temple safely, and Jack and Yusei return home with their new powers of Clear Mind, and Blazing Soul.\n| LineColor       = 015E80\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (season 4)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 114\n| Title           = Operation Capture Lazar II\n| TranslitTitle   = Y\u0113g\u0101 Hokaku Sakusen Ts\u016b\n| NativeTitle     = \u30a4\u30a7\u30fc\u30ac\u30fc\u6355\u7372\u4f5c\u6226II\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| WrittenBy       = Toshifumi Kawase\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|6|16}}\n| AltDate         = N/A\n| ShortSummary    = Yusei and the others catch Lazar in disguise stealing some instant noodles.

Wanting to learn more, they sneak into Clark's office to obtain an access key for Level 10 clearance. When Clark returns, Yusei holds him off by challenging him to a duel with some new rules Clark throws in whilst Sherry and Bruno head for the restricted area. Clark's duel requires players to declare the type of card they want and successfully pick the right one in order to use it. However, Clark gains an advantage by cheating using his glasses. Realizing this, Yusei manages to summon Stardust Dragon and defeats him. However, Clark had already figured out their identities and sets off the alarm.

He sends Yusei, Sherry and Bruno into a wormhole, in which they are doomed to break up and crash. Sherry uses her card to regain control of the shuttle, but ends up getting sucked out. Yusei and Bruno enter a \"warped\" dimension in the future, and pass by a strange island (a gigantic, floating, upside-down \"metallic fortress\", the ''Ark Cradle''), where Yusei is briefly visited again by his father, who warns him of an Ener-D that will destroy mankind, before returning him and Bruno to their homeworld (the Present). Unhappy with Clark's actions, Yliaster erases Clark from existence, which spreads a blast of white light across New Domino City. Another WRGP team, Team Ragnarok, also notices the blast, but were protected by their Nordic God cards. Yusei and Bruno regroup with the other Signers, who were defended from the blast by their Signer marks. They also spot the strange metallic island, the Ark Cradle, coming through an interdimensional \"hole\" in the sky, which only Signers and people from Team Ragnarok can see, along with people that come into physical contact with them. When they try returning to the Ener-D Express, they discover that it has disappeared (as Yliaster's actions have also erased that company from existence). They later return to find the Yliaster trio joining the WRGP, and that Sherry's team had vanished from the roster (in other words, Sherry was \"kicked out\" of the WRGP, with Yliaster replacing her team), coming to the conclusion that Yliaster had managed to alter history. When Trudge and Mina inform the others that the WRGP may be cancelled following the recent incidents, Lazar decides to take the position of director in order to overturn the situation. Meanwhile, Sherry wakes up in a strange dimension where she meets a strange being in the form of her father, who is really Z-ONE who has taken the form of her father, offers to show her the future of the world. Z-ONE warns Sherry that seeing the future would change her destiny forever (because the vision would convince her to join Z-ONE), but Sherry replies that she doesn't care, and that she still wants to see the future, as she states that knowing the future ahead of time would benefit her, and her friends. Then, Z-ONE proceeds to show her the future.\n| LineColor       = 015E80\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (season 4)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 118\n| Title           = The New Rivals\n| TranslitTitle   = Aratanaru Raibaru\n| NativeTitle     = \u65b0\u305f\u306a\u308b\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30eb\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| WrittenBy       = Yoshifumi Fukushima\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|7|14}}\n| AltDate         = N/A\n| ShortSummary    = After reading up on Team Ragnarok, Leo runs into another WRGP team, Team Taiyo, and injures his knee.

With this result, the World Racing Grand Prix (WRGP)'s finals will be Team 5D's Vs. Team New World (the 3 emperors of Yliaster). With the finals looming, Carly ponders the possible outcomes of the upcoming battle, while she writes up her special feature article about Team 5D's. While performing the interview, Akiza and company accidentally reconfirm their bonds. Noticing Carly's struggle to write up an article about Team 5D's, not helped by Mina's interference, Akiza, Luna and Leo decide to help her write profiles for each member, recalling on their past adventures. In addition, when Carly talks to Akiza, they discuss the relation of their new opponents, Team New World, to the organization of Yliaster, and the trio's schemes, causing Carly to gain unthinkable information. When Carly was finished typing all of the information down, Stephanie comes in with a teapot full of hot coffee. She trips on a wire and the coffee spills all over the computer, erasing all of the files, which ruins Carly's report.\n| LineColor       = 015E80\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (season 4)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 131\n| Title           = The Beginning of the End / Fight for the Future!

Then, Z-ONE brings Sherry into the Ark Cradle, which is already emerging into the [[Yu-Gi-Oh!]] dimension. That night, the Signers are messaged by the Three Emperors of Yliaster, who tell them about the floating metallic island, the Ark Cradle, where a God called Yliadus (Z-ONE's real name) supposedly sleeps, stating that if they win the WRGP, then Yliadus will awaken and have New Domino City destroyed, but will rebuild it the way the trio wants it to be, which is without the existence of Ener-D and Synchro Monsters. During the next morning, the WRGP finals begin with Jack facing off against Lester, who both bring out their ace monsters, Red Nova Dragon and Machine Emperor Skiel Infinity. But then, Lester activates the continuous trap, Infinite Spirit Machine, which gains a Spirit Machine Counter for every 100 points of damage he takes. Jack manages to defeat Skiel and beat Lester, though he leaves behind some traps cards, and the strange continuous trap, Infinite Spirit Machine, for both Primo, and Jakob to use.

Seeing that Primo was acting on his own again, when Primo activates 2 traps he left for Jakob, Lester get agitated, but when Jakob reminded Primo of their plan, Primo decided to try something different. Yusei realizes their tactic is based on the continuous trap that Lester left behind, but when Jack tries to destroy it, Primo protects it with a trap card, and gets beaten by Jack.

Jakob then activates a trap, which brings out Grannel Attack 3, while reducing Yusei's life points to 2,800. Jakob shows Yusei and the others a twisted future where New Domino City is completely destroyed. Due to Synchro Monsters and Ener-D evolving the world at an incredible rate, a war broke out and the Ener-D reactor eventually exploded, destroying most of the world. The Yliaster trio also unveil their memories of despair. 200 into the future, they see everybody Synchro Summoning, and as a result of them using Synchro Monsters to achieve their own greedy desires, the Machine Emperors show up one day, and begin killing humans. In the vision, as Lester was running with his parents to safety, a Grannel shot his parents down. Lester in the vision, then wails at the death of his parents, the ones who loved him. Then, Primo reveals that he joined the Freedom Fighters, a group of military people who destroy Machine Emperors, to restore freedom to mankind. He also reveals that he fell in love with one of their number, Eurea Pastel, and they often fought together. When they ambush another Grannel, it retaliates, by shooting down the building, killing his girlfriend in the process. Primo then cries over her death, and when the Grannel comes to kill him, he angrily shoots it down. Jakob then reveals that he was the \"last survivor\" of the Machine Emperor attack. He then says that he tried for years to find other humans, but to no avail. In the future, Jakob then sheds some tears over the destruction of humankind. Back in the duel, although the Yliaster trio said that the events the Signers just saw were their memories of humanity's destruction, Yusei refuses to believe that any of it was true. Yusei then brings out Shooting Star Dragon, and manages to destroy Machine Emperor Grannel Infinity, which reduces Jakob's life points from 12,000 down to 3,900. Just then, Jakob activates the Yliaster trio's infinity patches, and then the sky glows red, and a huge green infinity symbol appears in the sky. Jakob, Primo, and Lester then get launched into the sky, towards the huge green infinity. Then, they fuse together to form the true Emperor of Yliaster, Aporia, who is the true form of the Yliaster trio, and then the green infinity disappears. As Yusei questions what is going on in disbelief, Aporia answers, \"''I am Aporia''.\"\n(Lester is Aporia's childhood counterpart, Primo his late teenage one, and Jakob his form during his old age. \"Aporia\" is the mid-age adult counterpart, who appears at the peak of his life, formed only by the 3 other counterparts fusing.)\n| LineColor       = 015E80\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Yu-Gi-Oh!}}\n\n[[Category:2010 Japanese television seasons]]\n[[Category:2011 Japanese television seasons]]\n[[Category:Yu-Gi-Oh! seasons|5D's (season 4)]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_5D%27s_(season_4)"}

In humans, dietary [[proteins]] are broken down by digestion into [[amino acids]], which serve as metabolic fuel for other functional roles in the body. A key process in amino acid degradation is [[transamination]], in which the amino group of an amino acid is transferred to an \u03b1-ketoacid, typically catalysed by a [[transaminase]]. The reaction can be generalised as such:\n\n: R<sub>1</sub>-amino acid + R<sub>2</sub>-\u03b1-[[Keto acid|ketoacid]] \u21cc R<sub>1</sub>-\u03b1-ketoacid + R<sub>2</sub>-amino acid\n\nA very common \u03b1-keto acid is \u03b1-ketoglutarate, an intermediate in the [[citric acid cycle]]. Transamination of \u03b1-ketoglutarate gives glutamate. The resulting \u03b1-ketoacid product is often a useful one as well, which can contribute as fuel or as a substrate for further metabolism processes. Examples are as follows:\n\n: [[Alanine]] + \u03b1-ketoglutarate \u21cc [[pyruvate]] + glutamate\n\n: [[Aspartate]] + \u03b1-ketoglutarate \u21cc [[oxaloacetate]] + glutamate\n\nBoth pyruvate and oxaloacetate are key components of cellular metabolism, contributing as substrates or intermediates in fundamental processes such as [[glycolysis]], [[gluconeogenesis]], and the [[citric acid cycle]].\n\nGlutamate also plays an important role in the body's disposal of excess or waste [[nitrogen]]. Glutamate undergoes [[deamination]], an oxidative reaction catalysed by [[glutamate dehydrogenase]],<ref name=\"springerlink\" /> as follows:\n\n: glutamate + H<sub>2</sub>O + [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADP]]<sup>+</sup> \u2192 \u03b1-ketoglutarate + [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]] + NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sup>+</sup>\n\nAmmonia (as [[ammonium]]) is then excreted predominantly as [[urea]], synthesised in the [[liver]]. Transamination can thus be linked to deamination, effectively allowing nitrogen from the amine groups of amino acids to be removed, via glutamate as an intermediate, and finally excreted from the body in the form of urea.\n\nGlutamate is also a [[neurotransmitter]] (see below), which makes it one of the most abundant molecules in the brain. Malignant brain tumors known as [[glioma]] or [[glioblastoma]] exploit this phenomenon by using glutamate as an energy source, especially when these tumors become more dependent on glutamate due to mutations in the gene ''IDH1''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=van Lith|first1=SA|last2=Navis|first2=AC|last3=Verrijp|first3=K|last4=Niclou|first4=SP|last5=Bjerkvig|first5=R|last6=Wesseling|first6=P|last7=Tops|first7=B|last8=Molenaar|first8=R|last9=van Noorden|first9=CJ|last10=Leenders|first10=WP|title=Glutamate as chemotactic fuel for diffuse glioma cells: are they glutamate suckers?|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|date=August 2014|volume=1846|issue=1|pages=66\u201374|pmid=24747768|doi=10.1016/j.bbcan.2014.04.004}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=van Lith|first1=SA|last2=Molenaar|first2=R|last3=van Noorden|first3=CJ|last4=Leenders|first4=WP|title=Tumor cells in search for glutamate: an alternative explanation for increased invasiveness of IDH1 mutant gliomas|journal=Neuro-oncology|date=December 2014|volume=16|issue=12|pages=1669\u20131670|pmid=25074540|doi=10.1093/neuonc/nou152|pmc=4232089}}</ref>\n\n{{see also|Glutamate\u2013glutamine cycle}}\n\n=== Neurotransmitter ===\n{{main|Glutamate (neurotransmitter)}}\n\nGlutamate is the most abundant excitatory [[neurotransmitter]] in the vertebrate [[nervous system]].<ref name=\"pmid10736372\">{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Meldrum | first1 = B.

In humans, dietary [[proteins]] are broken down by digestion into [[amino acids]], which serve as metabolic fuel for other functional roles in the body. A key process in amino acid degradation is [[transamination]], in which the amino group of an amino acid is transferred to an \u03b1-ketoacid, typically catalysed by a [[transaminase]]. The reaction can be generalised as such:\n\n: R<sub>1</sub>-amino acid + R<sub>2</sub>-\u03b1-[[Keto acid|ketoacid]] \u21cc R<sub>1</sub>-\u03b1-ketoacid + R<sub>2</sub>-amino acid\n\nA very common \u03b1-keto acid is \u03b1-ketoglutarate, an intermediate in the [[citric acid cycle]]. Transamination of \u03b1-ketoglutarate gives glutamate. The resulting \u03b1-ketoacid product is often a useful one as well, which can contribute as fuel or as a substrate for further metabolism processes. Examples are as follows:\n\n: [[Alanine]] + \u03b1-ketoglutarate \u21cc [[pyruvate]] + glutamate\n\n: [[Aspartate]] + \u03b1-ketoglutarate \u21cc [[oxaloacetate]] + glutamate\n\nBoth pyruvate and oxaloacetate are key components of cellular metabolism, contributing as substrates or intermediates in fundamental processes such as [[glycolysis]], [[gluconeogenesis]], and the [[citric acid cycle]].\n\nGlutamate also plays an important role in the body's disposal of excess or waste [[nitrogen]]. Glutamate undergoes [[deamination]], an oxidative reaction catalysed by [[glutamate dehydrogenase]],<ref name=\"springerlink\" /> as follows:\n\n: glutamate + H<sub>2</sub>O + [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADP]]<sup>+</sup> \u2192 \u03b1-ketoglutarate + [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]] + NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sup>+</sup>\n\nAmmonia (as [[ammonium]]) is then excreted predominantly as [[urea]], synthesised in the [[liver]]. Transamination can thus be linked to deamination, effectively allowing nitrogen from the amine groups of amino acids to be removed, via glutamate as an intermediate, and finally excreted from the body in the form of urea.\n\nGlutamate is also a [[neurotransmitter]] (see below), which makes it one of the most abundant molecules in the brain. Malignant brain tumors known as [[glioma]] or [[glioblastoma]] exploit this phenomenon by using glutamate as an energy source, especially when these tumors become more dependent on glutamate due to mutations in the gene ''IDH1''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=van Lith|first1=SA|last2=Navis|first2=AC|last3=Verrijp|first3=K|last4=Niclou|first4=SP|last5=Bjerkvig|first5=R|last6=Wesseling|first6=P|last7=Tops|first7=B|last8=Molenaar|first8=R|last9=van Noorden|first9=CJ|last10=Leenders|first10=WP|title=Glutamate as chemotactic fuel for diffuse glioma cells: are they glutamate suckers?|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|date=August 2014|volume=1846|issue=1|pages=66\u201374|pmid=24747768|doi=10.1016/j.bbcan.2014.04.004}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=van Lith|first1=SA|last2=Molenaar|first2=R|last3=van Noorden|first3=CJ|last4=Leenders|first4=WP|title=Tumor cells in search for glutamate: an alternative explanation for increased invasiveness of IDH1 mutant gliomas|journal=Neuro-oncology|date=December 2014|volume=16|issue=12|pages=1669\u20131670|pmid=25074540|doi=10.1093/neuonc/nou152|pmc=4232089}}</ref>\n\n{{see also|Glutamate\u2013glutamine cycle}}\n\n=== Neurotransmitter ===\n{{main|Glutamate (neurotransmitter)}}\n\nGlutamate is the most abundant excitatory [[neurotransmitter]] in the vertebrate [[nervous system]].<ref name=\"pmid10736372\">{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Meldrum | first1 = B.

However, these include short pamphlets, and [[fatwa|legal opinions]].<ref name=Meri2005/>\n\nHe wrote his first book, ''Sharh Al-Isti'aadha wal-Basmalah'' in 866 AH, at the age of seventeen.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n[[Ibn al-\u02bfIm\u0101d]] writes: \"Most of his works become world famous in his lifetime.\" Renowned as a prolific writer, his student Dawudi said: \"I was with the Shaykh Suyuti once, and he wrote three volumes on that day. He could dictate annotations on [[hadith|\u0125ad\u012bth]], and answer my objections at the same time. In his time he was the foremost scholar of the \u0125ad\u012bth and associated sciences, of the narrators including the uncommon ones, the hadith [[matn]] (text), [[isnad]] (chain of narrators), the derivation of hadith rulings.

As with [[Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi]] in his medicinal works, he writes almost exclusively on prophetic medicine, rather than the Islamic-Greek synthesis of medicinal tradition found in the works of [[Al-Dhahabi]]. He focuses on diet and natural remedies for serious ailments such as [[rabies]] and [[smallpox]], and for simple conditions such as headaches and nosebleeds, and mentions the cosmology behind the principles of medical ethics.<ref>Emilie Savage-Smith, \"Medicine.\" Taken from ''Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, Volume 3: Technology, Alchemy and Life Sciences'', pg. 928.

This caused friction with scholars and ruling officials, and after a quarrel over the finances of the Sufi lodge, he retreated to the [[Rhoda Island|island of Rawda]] in 1501.
