Association for Computational Linguistics, 1985.</ref>\n\n===Semantic definition===\n[[Leonard Bloomfield]] introduced the concept of \"Minimal Free Forms\" in 1928. Words are thought of as the smallest meaningful unit of [[speech]] that can stand by themselves.<ref>Katamba 11</ref> This correlates phonemes (units of sound) to [[lexeme]]s (units of meaning). However, some written words are not minimal free forms as they make no sense by themselves (for example, ''the'' and ''of'').<ref>Fleming 77</ref>\n\nSome semanticists have put forward a theory of so-called semantic primitives or [[semantic primes]], indefinable words representing fundamental concepts that are intuitively meaningful. According to this theory, semantic primes serve as the basis for describing the meaning, without circularity, of other words and their associated conceptual denotations.<ref name=wierzbicka96>Wierzbicka 1996; Goddard 2002</ref>\n\n===Features===\nIn the [[Minimalist program|Minimalist]] school of [[theoretical syntax]], words (also called ''lexical items'' in the literature) are construed as \"bundles\" of [[feature (linguistics)|linguistic features]] that are united into a structure with form and meaning.<ref>Adger (2003), pp. 36\u201337.</ref> For example, the word \"koalas\" has semantic features (it denotes real-world objects, [[koala]]s), [[Lexical category|category]] features (it is a noun), [[Grammatical number|number]] features (it is plural and must agree with verbs, pronouns, and demonstratives in its domain), [[phonology|phonological]] features (it is pronounced a certain way), etc.\n\n===Word boundaries===\nThe task of defining what constitutes a \"word\" involves determining where one word ends and another word begins\u2014in other words, identifying word boundaries. There are several ways to determine where the word boundaries of spoken language should be placed:<ref name=hasp2011/>\n* '''Potential pause''': A speaker is told to repeat a given sentence slowly, allowing for pauses. The speaker will tend to insert pauses at the word boundaries. However, this method is not foolproof: the speaker could easily break up polysyllabic words, or fail to separate two or more closely linked words (e.g. \"to a\" in \"He went to a house\").\n* '''Indivisibility''': A speaker is told to say a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] out loud, and then is told to say the sentence again with extra words added to it. Thus, ''I have lived in this village for ten years'' might become ''My family and I have lived in this little village for about ten or so years''. These extra words will tend to be added in the word boundaries of the original sentence. However, some languages have [[infix]]es, which are put inside a word. Similarly, some have [[separable affix]]es; in the [[German language|German]] sentence \"Ich '''komme''' gut zu Hause '''an'''\", the verb ''ankommen'' is separated.\n* '''Phonetic boundaries''': Some languages have particular rules of [[pronunciation]] that make it easy to spot where a word boundary should be. For example, in a language that regularly [[lexical stress|stresses]] the last syllable of a word, a word boundary is likely to fall after each stressed syllable. Another example can be seen in a language that has [[vowel harmony]] (like [[Turkish language|Turkish]]):<ref>Bauer 9</ref> the vowels within a given word share the same ''quality'', so a word boundary is likely to occur whenever the vowel quality changes. Nevertheless, not all languages have such convenient phonetic rules, and even those that do present the occasional exceptions.\n* '''Orthographic boundaries''': See below.\n\n====Orthography====\nIn languages with a [[writing|literary tradition]], there is interrelation between [[orthography]] and the question of what is considered a single word. [[Word separator]]s (typically [[space (punctuation)|spaces]]) are common in modern orthography of languages using [[alphabetic script]]s, but these are (excepting isolated precedents) a relatively modern development (see also [[history of writing]]).\n\nIn [[English orthography]], [[compound (linguistics)|compound expressions]] may contain spaces. For example, ''ice cream'', ''air raid shelter'' and ''get up'' each are generally considered to consist of more than one word (as each of the components are free forms, with the possible exception of ''get'').\n\nNot all languages delimit words expressly. [[Mandarin Chinese]] is a very [[analytic language]] (with few inflectional affixes), making it unnecessary to delimit words orthographically. However, there are many multiple-morpheme compounds in Mandarin, as well as a variety of bound morphemes that make it difficult to clearly determine what constitutes a word.\n\nSometimes, languages which are extremely close grammatically will consider the same order of words in different ways. For example, [[reflexive verb]]s in the [[French language|French]] infinitive are separate from their respective particle, e.g. ''se laver'' (\"to wash oneself\"), whereas in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] they are hyphenated, e.g. ''lavar-se'', and in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] they are joined, e.g. ''lavarse''.<ref>Note that the convention also depends on the tense or mood\u2014the examples given here are in the infinitive, whereas French imperatives, for example, are hyphenated, e.g. ''lavez-vous'', whereas the Spanish present tense is completely separate, e.g. ''me lavo''.</ref>\n\n[[Japanese language|Japanese]] uses orthographic cues to delimit words such as switching between [[kanji]] (Chinese characters) and the two [[kana]] syllabaries. This is a fairly soft rule, because [[content word]]s can also be written in [[hiragana]] for effect (though if done extensively spaces are typically added to maintain legibility).\n\n[[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] orthography, although using the [[Latin alphabet]], delimits monosyllabic morphemes rather than words.\n\nIn [[character encoding]], [[text segmentation#Word segmentation|word segmentation]] depends on which [[character (computing)|characters]] are defined as word dividers.\n\n==Morphology==\n{{main|Morphology (linguistics)}}\n{{further|Inflection}}\n[[File:Happy Valentines Day.jpg|thumbnail|Letters and words]]\nMorphology is the study of word formation and structure. In [[synthetic language]]s, a single [[word stem]] (for example, ''love'') may have a number of different forms (for example, ''loves'', ''loving'', and ''loved''). However, for some purposes these are not usually considered to be different words, but rather different forms of the same word. In these languages, words may be considered to be constructed from a number of [[morpheme]]s.\n\nIn [[Indo-European languages]] in particular, the morphemes distinguished are:\n* The [[root (linguistics)|root]].\n* Optional [[suffixes]].\n* A inflectional [[suffix]].\nThus, the Proto-Indo-European ''{{PIE|*wr\u0325dhom}}'' would be analyzed as consisting of\n# ''{{PIE|*wr\u0325-}}'', the [[zero grade]] of the root ''{{PIE|*wer-}}''.\n# A root-extension ''{{PIE|*-dh-}}'' (diachronically a suffix), resulting in a complex root ''{{PIE|*wr\u0325dh-}}''.\n# The [[thematic suffix]] ''{{PIE|*-o-}}''.\n# The [[neuter gender]] nominative or accusative singular suffix ''{{PIE|*-m}}''.\n\n{{also|Homonym}}\n\n==Philosophy==\nPhilosophers have found words objects of fascination since at least the 5th century BC, with the foundation of the [[philosophy of language]]. [[Plato]] analyzed words in terms of their origins and the sounds making them up, concluding that there was some connection between sound and meaning, though words change a great deal over time. [[John Locke]] wrote that the use of words \"is to be sensible marks of ideas\", though they are chosen \"not by any natural connexion that there is between particular articulate sounds and certain ideas, for then there would be but one language amongst all men; but by a voluntary imposition, whereby such a word is made arbitrarily the mark of such an idea\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/philos/classics/locke/ctb3c02.htm |title=Locke ECHU BOOK III Chapter II Of the Signification of Words |publisher=Rbjones.com |date= |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> [[Wittgenstein]]'s thought transitioned from a word as representation of meaning to \"the meaning of a word is its use in the language.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein |title=Ludwig Wittgenstein (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nArchaeology shows that even for centuries prior to this fascination by philosophers in the 5th century BC, many languages had various ways of expressing this verbal unit, which in turn diversified and evolved into a range of expressions with wide philosophical significance.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Ancient manuscripts of the [[Gospel of John]] reveal in its 5th chapter Jesus chastising the pharisees expecting to find life in writings instead of himself. This perhaps could have led to John's introduction in chapter of a description in the Greek translation as \"the logos\".{{clarify|date=February 2015}}  A famous early scientist, scholar and priest, [[Thomas Aquinas]], influenced [[Cartesian philosophy]] and mathematics by interpreting such passages consistently with his philosophy of logic.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==Classes==\n{{main|Lexical category}}\n[[Grammar]] classifies a language's lexicon into several groups of words. The basic bipartite division possible for virtually every [[natural language]] is that of [[noun]]s vs. [[verb]]s.\n\nThe classification into such classes is in the tradition of [[Dionysius Thrax]], who distinguished eight categories: [[noun]], [[verb]], [[adjective]], [[pronoun]], [[preposition]], [[adverb]], [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] and [[interjection]].\n\nIn Indian grammatical tradition, [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]] introduced a similar fundamental classification into a nominal (n\u0101ma, suP) and a verbal (\u0101khy\u0101ta, tiN) class, based on the set of [[suffixes]] taken by the word. Some words can be controversial such as slang in formal contexts, misnomers due to them not meaning what they would imply or polysemous words due to the potential confusion of its multiple senses.<ref>De Soto, Clinton B., Margaret M.

For example, ''ice cream'', ''air raid shelter'' and ''get up'' each are generally considered to consist of more than one word (as each of the components are free forms, with the possible exception of ''get'').\n\nNot all languages delimit words expressly. [[Mandarin Chinese]] is a very [[analytic language]] (with few inflectional affixes), making it unnecessary to delimit words orthographically. However, there are many multiple-morpheme compounds in Mandarin, as well as a variety of bound morphemes that make it difficult to clearly determine what constitutes a word.\n\nSometimes, languages which are extremely close grammatically will consider the same order of words in different ways. For example, [[reflexive verb]]s in the [[French language|French]] infinitive are separate from their respective particle, e.g. ''se laver'' (\"to wash oneself\"), whereas in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] they are hyphenated, e.g. ''lavar-se'', and in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] they are joined, e.g. ''lavarse''.<ref>Note that the convention also depends on the tense or mood\u2014the examples given here are in the infinitive, whereas French imperatives, for example, are hyphenated, e.g. ''lavez-vous'', whereas the Spanish present tense is completely separate, e.g. ''me lavo''.</ref>\n\n[[Japanese language|Japanese]] uses orthographic cues to delimit words such as switching between [[kanji]] (Chinese characters) and the two [[kana]] syllabaries. This is a fairly soft rule, because [[content word]]s can also be written in [[hiragana]] for effect (though if done extensively spaces are typically added to maintain legibility).\n\n[[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] orthography, although using the [[Latin alphabet]], delimits monosyllabic morphemes rather than words.\n\nIn [[character encoding]], [[text segmentation#Word segmentation|word segmentation]] depends on which [[character (computing)|characters]] are defined as word dividers.\n\n==Morphology==\n{{main|Morphology (linguistics)}}\n{{further|Inflection}}\n[[File:Happy Valentines Day.jpg|thumbnail|Letters and words]]\nMorphology is the study of word formation and structure. In [[synthetic language]]s, a single [[word stem]] (for example, ''love'') may have a number of different forms (for example, ''loves'', ''loving'', and ''loved''). However, for some purposes these are not usually considered to be different words, but rather different forms of the same word. In these languages, words may be considered to be constructed from a number of [[morpheme]]s.\n\nIn [[Indo-European languages]] in particular, the morphemes distinguished are:\n* The [[root (linguistics)|root]].\n* Optional [[suffixes]].\n* A inflectional [[suffix]].\nThus, the Proto-Indo-European ''{{PIE|*wr\u0325dhom}}'' would be analyzed as consisting of\n# ''{{PIE|*wr\u0325-}}'', the [[zero grade]] of the root ''{{PIE|*wer-}}''.\n# A root-extension ''{{PIE|*-dh-}}'' (diachronically a suffix), resulting in a complex root ''{{PIE|*wr\u0325dh-}}''.\n# The [[thematic suffix]] ''{{PIE|*-o-}}''.\n# The [[neuter gender]] nominative or accusative singular suffix ''{{PIE|*-m}}''.\n\n{{also|Homonym}}\n\n==Philosophy==\nPhilosophers have found words objects of fascination since at least the 5th century BC, with the foundation of the [[philosophy of language]]. [[Plato]] analyzed words in terms of their origins and the sounds making them up, concluding that there was some connection between sound and meaning, though words change a great deal over time. [[John Locke]] wrote that the use of words \"is to be sensible marks of ideas\", though they are chosen \"not by any natural connexion that there is between particular articulate sounds and certain ideas, for then there would be but one language amongst all men; but by a voluntary imposition, whereby such a word is made arbitrarily the mark of such an idea\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/philos/classics/locke/ctb3c02.htm |title=Locke ECHU BOOK III Chapter II Of the Signification of Words |publisher=Rbjones.com |date= |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> [[Wittgenstein]]'s thought transitioned from a word as representation of meaning to \"the meaning of a word is its use in the language.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein |title=Ludwig Wittgenstein (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nArchaeology shows that even for centuries prior to this fascination by philosophers in the 5th century BC, many languages had various ways of expressing this verbal unit, which in turn diversified and evolved into a range of expressions with wide philosophical significance.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Ancient manuscripts of the [[Gospel of John]] reveal in its 5th chapter Jesus chastising the pharisees expecting to find life in writings instead of himself. This perhaps could have led to John's introduction in chapter of a description in the Greek translation as \"the logos\".{{clarify|date=February 2015}}  A famous early scientist, scholar and priest, [[Thomas Aquinas]], influenced [[Cartesian philosophy]] and mathematics by interpreting such passages consistently with his philosophy of logic.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==Classes==\n{{main|Lexical category}}\n[[Grammar]] classifies a language's lexicon into several groups of words. The basic bipartite division possible for virtually every [[natural language]] is that of [[noun]]s vs. [[verb]]s.\n\nThe classification into such classes is in the tradition of [[Dionysius Thrax]], who distinguished eight categories: [[noun]], [[verb]], [[adjective]], [[pronoun]], [[preposition]], [[adverb]], [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] and [[interjection]].\n\nIn Indian grammatical tradition, [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]] introduced a similar fundamental classification into a nominal (n\u0101ma, suP) and a verbal (\u0101khy\u0101ta, tiN) class, based on the set of [[suffixes]] taken by the word. Some words can be controversial such as slang in formal contexts, misnomers due to them not meaning what they would imply or polysemous words due to the potential confusion of its multiple senses.<ref>De Soto, Clinton B., Margaret M.

Kalamazoo was chosen as the new school's location on August 28, 1903.  Other locations considered included [[Allegan, Michigan|Allegan]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Decatur, Michigan|Decatur]], [[Three Oaks, Michigan|Three Oaks]], and [[Hastings, Michigan|Hastings]].  The first building, then known as the Administration Building, and now known as East Hall, was constructed in 1904.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cf.wmich.edu/planning/WebSites/1903/1903CampusDesign.htm |title=1903 Campus Plan &#124; Campus Planning &#124; Western Michigan University |publisher=Cf.wmich.edu |date= |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe University was first officially known as '''Western State Normal School''', and originally offered a two-year training program.  The first principal and president was [[Dwight B. Waldo]], who served from 1904 until 1936.  The school was renamed several times throughout its early history, beginning with '''Western State Teachers College''' in 1927, '''Michigan College of Education''' in 1941, and '''Western Michigan College''' in 1955. On February 26, 1957, Governor [[G. Mennen Williams]] signed a bill into law that made Western Michigan College the state's fourth public university and gave the school its current name of '''Western Michigan University'''.\n\nMost of the oldest and original WMU buildings and \"classrooms\" are collectively known as [[East Campus (Western Michigan University)|East Campus]], directly East from the more central \"West Campus\".\n\nAccess to the East Campus site was an issue because of the steep grade elevating it above the city. The [[Western State Normal Railroad]] was established in 1907 to carry students and staff up and down the hill via a [[funicular]]. It operated until 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cf.wmich.edu/planning/WebSites/Specialties/TrolleyCommemoration.htm |title=Western Trolley Commemoration &#124; Photos Images Trivia &#124; Western Michigan University |publisher=Cf.wmich.edu |date= |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\nWMU's campuses encompass more than {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} and roughly 150 buildings.

Many of the [[residence halls]] are found scattered throughout West Campus, while other [[dormitories]] (affectionately referred to as \"The Valleys\") are adjacent to West Campus in Goldsworth Valley.\n\nThe Bernhard Center is a centrally located multi-purpose student union that provides student and community groups with meeting space. Located within the Bernhard Center is the Bronco Mall, a one-stop-shop for students which includes a large 24-hour computer lab, a [[food court]] featuring [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Biggby Coffee]], [[K-zoo Coney]], numerous tables and chairs for eating and socializing, a [[PNC Bank]], and one of two school [[bookstore]]s.  Waldo Library and the attached University Computing Center are on West Campus, as is the Dalton Musical Center. Recently constructed buildings on West Campus include the Western Heights [[dormitory]] and the Chemistry Building, which replaces aging McCracken Hall.\n\nWest Campus is also the site of [[Miller Auditorium]]. A large entertainment venue seating nearly 3500 people, it is Michigan's fourth largest auditorium. Miller Auditorium hosts events ranging from popular [[musicals]] and [[concerts]] to graduation commencements and film screenings. The Gilmore Theater Complex, featuring three performance stages and faculty offices, is directly next to Miller Auditorium. The [[Richmond Center for Visual Arts]] was added to the Fine Arts Complex in 2007, followed by South Kohrman Hall being renovated into the Kohrman Hall Studios in 2008. Both buildings house the [[Gwen Frostic]] School of Art.\n\n===East Campus===\n{{Main|East Campus (Western Michigan University)}}\n\nEast Campus is the original development dating from the university's founding in 1903. It contains many of the university's historical buildings including, East Hall, West Hall, North Hall, Walwood Hall, Spindler Hall, Vandercook Hall, and The Little Theater. Many of these buildings are on a hill overlooking the city of [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]]. Walwood Hall, renovated in 1992, is home to the Graduate College, the Graduate Student Advisory Committee, the Medieval Institute, the WMU Office of Research and several other academic and administrative offices.\n\nIn December 2012, WMU announced plans to renovate its birthplace, historic East Hall, for use as an alumni center.

Students are welcomed to school each year with \"Bronco Bash\", an event with live entertainment performances and booths sponsored by student and community organizations.\n\nOn-campus housing provides 23 residence halls and special interest housing for students in programs such as the honors college, aviation, business community, engineering and applied sciences, science scholars, education, fine arts, health and human services, second year students, transfer students, magellan housing, wellness housing.\n\n=== Entertainment ===\nThe Campus Activities Board is the main student organization responsible for bringing entertainment events for students. The organization sponsors concerts, comedians, special events, and \"Miller Movies,\" presented at the school's main theater, Miller Auditorium. CAB sponsors both Bronco Bash and WMU's student Homecoming activities, in addition to many registered student organization events and activities.\n\nThere are also many concerts available to the public through WMU's College of Fine Arts.

This includes faith and spiritual development, the Office of [[LBGT]] Student Services, [[Greek Life]], services for International Students, Multicultural Affairs, Off-Campus Life, and Sponsored Student Organizations. WMU also has around 400 student organizations registered through the university that are available to any student.\n\n=== Student activism ===\nPlacement of the Chemistry Building generated much controversy from student groups because it displaced a large portion of greenery in the center of West Campus. A temporary outdoor plaza was constructed outside of Sangren Hall in 2007 to replace the greenery. However, this also generated controversy and protests among students and faculty because of its aesthetic characteristics and costs. One such protest by a student group involved requesting the financial records of the construction and using chalk to depict the costs of each item on the plaza.<ref>{{cite web |author=Michigan Set your local edition &raquo; |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/kzgazette/index.ssf?/base/news-25/1190214082159280.xml&coll=7 |title=Michigan |publisher=Mlive.com |date=November 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222041300/http://www.mlive.com/news/kzgazette/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews-25%2F1190214082159280.xml&coll=7 |archive-date=February 22, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n=== Fraternities and sororities ===\nSome of the fraternities established on campus include [[Alpha Kappa Psi]], [[Alpha Eta Rho]], [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Alpha Sigma Phi]], [[Alpha Tau Omega]], [[Delta Sigma Pi]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], [[Kappa Kappa Psi]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Omega Delta Epsilon]], [[Omega Psi Phi]], [[Phi Beta Sigma]], [[Phi Chi Theta]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]], [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]], [[Phi Sigma Pi]], [[Phi Sigma Kappa]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Pi Kappa Phi]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Omega Delta Phi]], [[Sigma Gamma Rho]] [[Sigma Lambda Beta]], [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], and [[Sigma Tau Gamma]] .\n\nSome of the sororities established on WMU's campus are, [[Alpha Omicron Pi]], [[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], [[Alpha Phi]], [[Alpha Xi Delta]], [[Chi Omega]], [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Delta Xi Nu]], [[Delta Zeta]], [[Lambda Theta Alpha]], [[Pi Beta Phi]], [[Sigma Alpha Iota]], [[Sigma Gamma Rho]], [[Sigma Kappa]], [[Sigma Lambda Gamma]] and [[Zeta Phi Beta]].\n\n=== Health services ===\nWestern Michigan University students and faculty are served by Sindecuse Health Center.

Kalamazoo was chosen as the new school's location on August 28, 1903.  Other locations considered included [[Allegan, Michigan|Allegan]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Decatur, Michigan|Decatur]], [[Three Oaks, Michigan|Three Oaks]], and [[Hastings, Michigan|Hastings]].  The first building, then known as the Administration Building, and now known as East Hall, was constructed in 1904.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cf.wmich.edu/planning/WebSites/1903/1903CampusDesign.htm |title=1903 Campus Plan &#124; Campus Planning &#124; Western Michigan University |publisher=Cf.wmich.edu |date= |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe University was first officially known as '''Western State Normal School''', and originally offered a two-year training program.  The first principal and president was [[Dwight B. Waldo]], who served from 1904 until 1936.  The school was renamed several times throughout its early history, beginning with '''Western State Teachers College''' in 1927, '''Michigan College of Education''' in 1941, and '''Western Michigan College''' in 1955. On February 26, 1957, Governor [[G. Mennen Williams]] signed a bill into law that made Western Michigan College the state's fourth public university and gave the school its current name of '''Western Michigan University'''.\n\nMost of the oldest and original WMU buildings and \"classrooms\" are collectively known as [[East Campus (Western Michigan University)|East Campus]], directly East from the more central \"West Campus\".\n\nAccess to the East Campus site was an issue because of the steep grade elevating it above the city. The [[Western State Normal Railroad]] was established in 1907 to carry students and staff up and down the hill via a [[funicular]]. It operated until 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cf.wmich.edu/planning/WebSites/Specialties/TrolleyCommemoration.htm |title=Western Trolley Commemoration &#124; Photos Images Trivia &#124; Western Michigan University |publisher=Cf.wmich.edu |date= |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\nWMU's campuses encompass more than {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} and roughly 150 buildings.

Many of the [[residence halls]] are found scattered throughout West Campus, while other [[dormitories]] (affectionately referred to as \"The Valleys\") are adjacent to West Campus in Goldsworth Valley.\n\nThe Bernhard Center is a centrally located multi-purpose student union that provides student and community groups with meeting space. Located within the Bernhard Center is the Bronco Mall, a one-stop-shop for students which includes a large 24-hour computer lab, a [[food court]] featuring [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Biggby Coffee]], [[K-zoo Coney]], numerous tables and chairs for eating and socializing, a [[PNC Bank]], and one of two school [[bookstore]]s.  Waldo Library and the attached University Computing Center are on West Campus, as is the Dalton Musical Center. Recently constructed buildings on West Campus include the Western Heights [[dormitory]] and the Chemistry Building, which replaces aging McCracken Hall.\n\nWest Campus is also the site of [[Miller Auditorium]]. A large entertainment venue seating nearly 3500 people, it is Michigan's fourth largest auditorium. Miller Auditorium hosts events ranging from popular [[musicals]] and [[concerts]] to graduation commencements and film screenings. The Gilmore Theater Complex, featuring three performance stages and faculty offices, is directly next to Miller Auditorium. The [[Richmond Center for Visual Arts]] was added to the Fine Arts Complex in 2007, followed by South Kohrman Hall being renovated into the Kohrman Hall Studios in 2008. Both buildings house the [[Gwen Frostic]] School of Art.\n\n===East Campus===\n{{Main|East Campus (Western Michigan University)}}\n\nEast Campus is the original development dating from the university's founding in 1903.

A temporary outdoor plaza was constructed outside of Sangren Hall in 2007 to replace the greenery.

One such protest by a student group involved requesting the financial records of the construction and using chalk to depict the costs of each item on the plaza.<ref>{{cite web |author=Michigan Set your local edition &raquo; |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/kzgazette/index.ssf?/base/news-25/1190214082159280.xml&coll=7 |title=Michigan |publisher=Mlive.com |date=November 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222041300/http://www.mlive.com/news/kzgazette/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews-25%2F1190214082159280.xml&coll=7 |archive-date=February 22, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n=== Fraternities and sororities ===\nSome of the fraternities established on campus include [[Alpha Kappa Psi]], [[Alpha Eta Rho]], [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Alpha Sigma Phi]], [[Alpha Tau Omega]], [[Delta Sigma Pi]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], [[Kappa Kappa Psi]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Omega Delta Epsilon]], [[Omega Psi Phi]], [[Phi Beta Sigma]], [[Phi Chi Theta]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]], [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]], [[Phi Sigma Pi]], [[Phi Sigma Kappa]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Pi Kappa Phi]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Omega Delta Phi]], [[Sigma Gamma Rho]] [[Sigma Lambda Beta]], [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], and [[Sigma Tau Gamma]] .\n\nSome of the sororities established on WMU's campus are, [[Alpha Omicron Pi]], [[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], [[Alpha Phi]], [[Alpha Xi Delta]], [[Chi Omega]], [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Delta Xi Nu]], [[Delta Zeta]], [[Lambda Theta Alpha]], [[Pi Beta Phi]], [[Sigma Alpha Iota]], [[Sigma Gamma Rho]], [[Sigma Kappa]], [[Sigma Lambda Gamma]] and [[Zeta Phi Beta]].\n\n=== Health services ===\nWestern Michigan University students and faculty are served by Sindecuse Health Center.
