However, operations actually began in 1871. By the end of the 19th century, it had expanded to [[Central America|Central]] and South America, the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[West Indies]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[India]], [[North Africa]] and other international markets. During the next five decades, the company grew and prospered, surviving the difficulties of [[World War I]] and the large drain on its finances through policy claims arising from the large number of deaths caused by the [[Great Flu Epidemic]] of 1918.\n\nThe company's original [[Dominion Square]] building in Montreal was built in 1918. Capping a Montreal construction boom that began in the 1920s, the company completed construction of the expansion of its headquarters with its new 26-storey headquarters north tower in 1933. Although the [[Tour de la Banque Royale|head office of the Royal Bank of Canada on St. James Street]] was taller by several floors, the [[Sun Life Building]] was at the time the largest building in terms of square footage anywhere in the [[British Empire]].\n\nChartered in 1865, its traditional base business worldwide remains life insurance. However, it now also has significant asset management operations. In 1919, it was the first Canadian company to offer group life insurance. Having begun its first US operations in 1895, the company sold its first group life plan in the U.S. in 1924.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:One York, Toronto, South view 20170417 1.jpg|alt=|thumb|Sun Life Global Headquarters at One York Street in Toronto, Canada]]\nIn [[World War II]], the [[gold reserves]] and [[Security (finance)|securities]] of several European countries were secretly moved to the Sun Life Building for safekeeping. A persistent rumour that the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom]] were illegally shipped out of the United Kingdom during WWII and stored there was deliberately spread in Montreal to account for increased activity at the building.<ref name=\"Draper1979\">{{cite book|author=Alfred Draper|title=Operation Fish: The Race to Save Europe's Wealth, 1939\u20131945|url=https://archive.org/details/operationfishrac0000drap|url-access=registration|year=1979|publisher=Cassell|isbn=978-0-304-30068-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/operationfishrac0000drap/page/255 255]\u2013257}}</ref>\n\n===Post-World War II===\nDuring the post-war period, the company's successful business strategies made it one of Montreal's largest white-collar employers, one of the top corporations in Canada, as well as a global player in the life insurance field. For the first half of the 20th century, the city of Montreal had been the economic hub of Canada, but it was losing ground to [[Toronto]]. As early as 1950, Toronto's economic activity surpassed Montreal's with regards to stock market trading and capitalization. The advent, in the 1960s, of political and [[terrorism|terrorist]] movements demanding the independence of Quebec from Canada cast a pallor of uncertainty over the business community.\n\n===1977-1980===\nIn 1977, the newly elected [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereigntist]] Quebec government passed the [[Charter of the French Language]] (known as Bill 101), making the use of [[French language]] mandatory for medium- and large-scale companies when communicating with French-speaking staff. The law was received negatively by the English-speaking business community, many of whom perceived that the historical rights of the English-speaking minority should be respected. The new government also promised a referendum on Quebec sovereignty, injecting instability into the Montreal business community.<ref name=\"Guardian\">https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/06/40-year-hangover-1976-olympic-games-broke-montreal-canada</ref> On January 6, 1978, Sun Life became the first large company to leave Quebec post-election, announcing that it would move its head office to rented space in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]].<ref name=\"Guardian\"/><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2011/03/21/la-financiere-sun-life-veut-repartir-a-zero-avec-le-quebec |title = La Financi\u00e8re Sun Life veut repartir \u00e0 z\u00e9ro avec le Qu\u00e9bec}}</ref><ref name=\"Gazette\">{{Cite web | url=https://montrealgazette.com/business/sun-life-now-remembers-yes-we-left-quebec-in-1978 |title = Sun Life Financial now remembers: Yes, we left Quebec in 1978 &#124; Montreal Gazette|date = 2012-02-09}}</ref> Officially, Sun Life said it was motivated by the political instability and economic uncertainty of Quebec's future, but skeptics said it was the company's unwillingness to comply with the requirements of Bill 101.<ref name=\"Gazette\"/> In a reaction the next day, the province's finance minister [[Jacques Parizeau]] called Sun Life \"one of the worst exporters of Quebec capital\",<ref name=\"banq-leDevoir\">{{Cite web | url=http://numerique.banq.qc.ca/patrimoine/details/52327/2775856?docsearchtext=sun%20life%20levesque | title=BAnQ num\u00e9rique}}</ref> and threatened to freeze some $400 million CAD in assets.<ref name=\"banq-leDevoir\"/><ref name=\"Mans1978\">{{cite book|author=Rowland Mans|title=Canada's Constitutional Crisis: Separatism and Subversion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oM2IAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Institute for the Study of Conflict}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the company acquired a property at University Avenue and King Street in downtown Toronto and constructed a new office complex, the [[Sun Life Centre]], which was completed in 1984.<ref name=\"Filey1997\">{{cite book|author=Mike Filey|title=Toronto Sketches 5: The Way We Were|url=https://archive.org/details/torontosketches50000file|url-access=registration|date=1 October 1997|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-4597-1330-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/torontosketches50000file/page/137 137]\u2013}}</ref>\n\nBill 101 required more than French communications with French-speaking staff. It made French the official language of the workplace. It also provided that present and prospective employees who could not speak English not be discriminated against because of their inability to speak English.\n[[File:Dean A Connor Headshot.jpg|alt=|thumb|Dean A. Connor, President and CEO of Sun Life, since 2011]]\nFor the largest employer of English-speaking people in Montreal, this would make things very difficult. Many, if not most, of Sun Life's Head Office employees in 1979 were not fluent in French. Sun Life was quite clear that this was the reason for its move when it made the announcement. The PQ government was quick to label Sun Life \"bad corporate citizens\" and claimed that if ''\"they had only warned us, we could have worked something out.\"''<ref name=CBC1>{{cite episode |title=CBC reports on Sun Life leaving Montreal in 1978 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/language-culture/fighting-words-bill-101/sun-life-packs-up.html |accessdate=2014-08-18 |date=January 6, 1978 |series=The World At Six |credits=Reporters: Karen Birchard, Richard Inwood |work=[[CBC Radio]]}}</ref>\n\nThe downsizing of Sun Life's Montreal office did not take place overnight. Transfers and moves occurred on a departmental basis and did not commence until several months after the announcement. By 1980, 300 head office employees were located in Toronto.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1076086/sun-life-demenagement-montreal-toronto-pq-archives |title = Il y a 40 ans : Le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement surprise de la Sun Life}}</ref>\n\nThere were several other key activities in the post-war years. This included a decision by Sun Life to leave many markets, including China and India, because of economic and political changes. In 1962, Sun Life became a mutual company and repurchased its shares for $65 million in total. In 1973, Sun Life opened its American subsidiary's new headquarters in Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts, located outside [[Boston]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===1980s \u2013 1990s===\nSun Life continued to expand its wealth management business with the 1982 acquisition of [[MFS Investment Management|Massachusetts Financial Services]] (MFS), the Boston-based investment management and mutual fund company. It entered the mutual fund business in Canada by forming Spectrum Mutual Fund Services in 1987 (subsequently sold to CI Financial) and a decade later, acquired McLean Budden, a Canadian investment management firm (subsequently folded into MFS).\nInternational expansion continued in the 1990s. In 1995, Sun Life entered the Indonesia market through local company PT Asuransi Modern Sun Life, now called PT Sun Life Financial Indonesia and opened a Representative Office in Beijing in preparation to enter China. A year later, Sun Life opened a services centre in Waterford, Ireland, to provide technology and business processing support for Sun Life business units.\n\nIn 1999, Sun Life officially returned to [[India]] and [[China]] when it established two joint ventures \u2013 Birla Sun Life in India with local partner [[Aditya Birla Group]], and Sun Life Everbright in China with partner [[China Everbright Group]]. Over the next decade, both operations grew rapidly \u2013 by September 2008, there were 132,460 Birla Sun Life advisors working in 600 branches across India while Sun Life Everbright opened its sixth branch in Guangzhou, bringing its presence to 18 cities in [[China]].\n\n[[Image:Sun-Life-Building-June-2007.jpg|thumb|right|The Sun Life building in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]]]\n\n=== 2000's ===\nIn early 1998, Sun Life announced its intention to [[demutualize]]. In March 2000, its Initial Public Offering (IPO) started the trading of Sun Life Financial Inc. shares on the Toronto (TSX), New York (NYSE) and Philippine (PSE) stock exchanges.\n\nIn 2002, Sun Life combined its operations with [[Clarica Life Insurance]] of [[Waterloo, Ontario]]. Founded in 1870 as ''Mutual Life of Canada'', Clarica was known as The Mutual Group before it went public in 1999. The former head office for Mutual Life Assurance Company at 227 King Street South in Waterloo became the home to Sun Life's Canadian operations, while a regional office and Sun Life's corporate headquarters remained in Toronto. The company also maintains regional offices in [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]], [[Edmonton]], [[Vancouver]], [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] and [[Calgary]]. After it integrated operations, the company used the Clarica brand name for certain products and activities until 2007.\n\nIn 2005, Sun Life opened a service centre in Gurgaon, [[India]] to provide business processing and technology support for Sun Life Financial business units around the world. That same year, Sun Life purchased CMG Asia and CommServe Financial, the Hong Kong insurance and pension operations of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, tripling its customer base and adding group insurance and pensions to its business lines.\n\nIn 2007, Sun Life purchased the U.S. employee benefits business of Genworth Financial, placing itself in the top 10 in the U.S. group benefits market.\n\nIn 2008, Sun Life sold its 37% interest in CI Financial Income Fund to [[Scotiabank]]. Sun Life had originally acquired a significant [[ownership interest]] in the firm by selling its Canadian mutual fund subsidiaries to CI Financial in 2002.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2002/05/22/cifund020522.html |title= CBC News - CI Fund acquires Sun Life mutual fund business |accessdate=2008-12-28 |date=22 May 2002}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Sun Life began an aggressive nationwide ad campaign in the [[United States]] touting its strength and the fact that it did not accept any [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|bailout]] money.\n\n=== 2010's ===\nIn 2013, Sun Life acquired 49% [[Aviva|Aviva PLC's]] Malaysian insurance joint venture with lender [[CIMB Group]]. Sun Life acquired the business along with Malaysian state investor [[Khazanah Nasional]], which also purchased 49%. They each paid approximately CDN$300 million. CIMB retains 2% interest.\n\nIn 2015, Sun Life acquired the Employee Benefits business of Assurant Inc. The transaction closed in March 2016, creating the sixth-largest group benefits business in the U.S.\n\nIn 2017, the [[Toronto Raptors]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] announced that Sun Life will become their jersey sponsor beginning with the 2017-18 NBA season. This deal continues through the 2019/2020 season.\n\nIn June 2019, Sun Life re-branded its Sun Life Investment Management unit to SLC Management and fully merged its fixed income businesses, Ryan Labs Asset Management Inc. and Prime Advisors, Inc. with Sun Life Capital Management (U.S.)\n\nIn addition, in July 2019, SLC's real estate division was merged under the name BentallGreenOak Real Estate.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://insurance-journal.ca/article/sun-life-completes-bentallgreenoaks-acquisition/|title=Sun Life completes BentallGreenOaks acquisition|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Sun Life in North America ==\n\n=== Canada ===\nSun Life's Canadian headquarters are based out of the [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo]], [[Ontario]].\n\nSun Life contributes to the local economy as one of the top 5 major employers in the region, with approximately 3,500 employees \u2014 more than 40% of Sun Life's employee base in Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://canadastop100.com/waterloo/|title=Waterloo Top|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSun Life is an Observing Organization in the Regional Carbon Initiative (run by the Sustainable Waterloo Region) and a member of TravelWise, a joint program of Sustainable Waterloo Region and the Region of Waterloo.\n\nSun Life roots in Canada go back over 150 years and is estimated that the company provides financial products and advice to 1 in 5 Canadians.\n\nIn 2012, Sun Life celebrated the 100th anniversary of its Canadian head office building, located on King Street, right on the border of the Cities of Kitchener and Waterloo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sunlife.ca/ca/About+us/Newsroom/Canadian+head+office?vgnLocale=en_CA|title=Canadian head office|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== United States of America ===\nSun Life's U.S. Headquarters are based out of [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]], a [[New England town|town]] in [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]], [[Massachusetts]] and considered a part of [[Greater Boston]].\n\nSun Life Financial U.S. has the sixth-largest group benefits business in the United States and serves more than 60,000 employers in small, medium and large workplaces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdn.sunlife.com/static/Unitedstates/Updates/Assurant_Employee_Benefits_Acquisition/Sun_Life_Financial_U.S._Group_Benefits_Fact_Sheet_8.1.16.pdf|title=Sun Life Financial U.S. \u2013 Group Benefits key facts and figures|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSun Life\u2019s portfolio of insurance products and services in the U.S. includes disability, absence management, life, dental, vision, voluntary and medical stop-loss.\n\nIn 2018, Sun Life Financial U.S. was named one of the Top Places to Work in Massachusetts for 2018 by ''The Boston Globe''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/specials/top-places-to-work/2018/11/15/greater-boston-top-largest-employers/EUZk8XwaVOGr7XcE9UvMpJ/story.html?event=event12|title=Greater Boston Top Employers|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Sun Life Asset Management ==\nSun Life\u2019s asset management operation includes subsidiaries:\n\n* MFS Investment Management, which serves individual and institutional investors around the world;\n* SLC Management, which provides investment solutions{{Buzzword inline|date=August 2019}} for defined benefit pension plans, insurance companies and other institutional investors globally.

However, operations actually began in 1871. By the end of the 19th century, it had expanded to [[Central America|Central]] and South America, the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[West Indies]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[India]], [[North Africa]] and other international markets. During the next five decades, the company grew and prospered, surviving the difficulties of [[World War I]] and the large drain on its finances through policy claims arising from the large number of deaths caused by the [[Great Flu Epidemic]] of 1918.\n\nThe company's original [[Dominion Square]] building in Montreal was built in 1918. Capping a Montreal construction boom that began in the 1920s, the company completed construction of the expansion of its headquarters with its new 26-storey headquarters north tower in 1933. Although the [[Tour de la Banque Royale|head office of the Royal Bank of Canada on St. James Street]] was taller by several floors, the [[Sun Life Building]] was at the time the largest building in terms of square footage anywhere in the [[British Empire]].\n\nChartered in 1865, its traditional base business worldwide remains life insurance. However, it now also has significant asset management operations. In 1919, it was the first Canadian company to offer group life insurance. Having begun its first US operations in 1895, the company sold its first group life plan in the U.S. in 1924.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:One York, Toronto, South view 20170417 1.jpg|alt=|thumb|Sun Life Global Headquarters at One York Street in Toronto, Canada]]\nIn [[World War II]], the [[gold reserves]] and [[Security (finance)|securities]] of several European countries were secretly moved to the Sun Life Building for safekeeping. A persistent rumour that the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom]] were illegally shipped out of the United Kingdom during WWII and stored there was deliberately spread in Montreal to account for increased activity at the building.<ref name=\"Draper1979\">{{cite book|author=Alfred Draper|title=Operation Fish: The Race to Save Europe's Wealth, 1939\u20131945|url=https://archive.org/details/operationfishrac0000drap|url-access=registration|year=1979|publisher=Cassell|isbn=978-0-304-30068-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/operationfishrac0000drap/page/255 255]\u2013257}}</ref>\n\n===Post-World War II===\nDuring the post-war period, the company's successful business strategies made it one of Montreal's largest white-collar employers, one of the top corporations in Canada, as well as a global player in the life insurance field. For the first half of the 20th century, the city of Montreal had been the economic hub of Canada, but it was losing ground to [[Toronto]]. As early as 1950, Toronto's economic activity surpassed Montreal's with regards to stock market trading and capitalization. The advent, in the 1960s, of political and [[terrorism|terrorist]] movements demanding the independence of Quebec from Canada cast a pallor of uncertainty over the business community.\n\n===1977-1980===\nIn 1977, the newly elected [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereigntist]] Quebec government passed the [[Charter of the French Language]] (known as Bill 101), making the use of [[French language]] mandatory for medium- and large-scale companies when communicating with French-speaking staff. The law was received negatively by the English-speaking business community, many of whom perceived that the historical rights of the English-speaking minority should be respected. The new government also promised a referendum on Quebec sovereignty, injecting instability into the Montreal business community.<ref name=\"Guardian\">https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/06/40-year-hangover-1976-olympic-games-broke-montreal-canada</ref> On January 6, 1978, Sun Life became the first large company to leave Quebec post-election, announcing that it would move its head office to rented space in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]].<ref name=\"Guardian\"/><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2011/03/21/la-financiere-sun-life-veut-repartir-a-zero-avec-le-quebec |title = La Financi\u00e8re Sun Life veut repartir \u00e0 z\u00e9ro avec le Qu\u00e9bec}}</ref><ref name=\"Gazette\">{{Cite web | url=https://montrealgazette.com/business/sun-life-now-remembers-yes-we-left-quebec-in-1978 |title = Sun Life Financial now remembers: Yes, we left Quebec in 1978 &#124; Montreal Gazette|date = 2012-02-09}}</ref> Officially, Sun Life said it was motivated by the political instability and economic uncertainty of Quebec's future, but skeptics said it was the company's unwillingness to comply with the requirements of Bill 101.<ref name=\"Gazette\"/> In a reaction the next day, the province's finance minister [[Jacques Parizeau]] called Sun Life \"one of the worst exporters of Quebec capital\",<ref name=\"banq-leDevoir\">{{Cite web | url=http://numerique.banq.qc.ca/patrimoine/details/52327/2775856?docsearchtext=sun%20life%20levesque | title=BAnQ num\u00e9rique}}</ref> and threatened to freeze some $400 million CAD in assets.<ref name=\"banq-leDevoir\"/><ref name=\"Mans1978\">{{cite book|author=Rowland Mans|title=Canada's Constitutional Crisis: Separatism and Subversion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oM2IAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Institute for the Study of Conflict}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the company acquired a property at University Avenue and King Street in downtown Toronto and constructed a new office complex, the [[Sun Life Centre]], which was completed in 1984.<ref name=\"Filey1997\">{{cite book|author=Mike Filey|title=Toronto Sketches 5: The Way We Were|url=https://archive.org/details/torontosketches50000file|url-access=registration|date=1 October 1997|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-4597-1330-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/torontosketches50000file/page/137 137]\u2013}}</ref>\n\nBill 101 required more than French communications with French-speaking staff. It made French the official language of the workplace. It also provided that present and prospective employees who could not speak English not be discriminated against because of their inability to speak English.\n[[File:Dean A Connor Headshot.jpg|alt=|thumb|Dean A. Connor, President and CEO of Sun Life, since 2011]]\nFor the largest employer of English-speaking people in Montreal, this would make things very difficult. Many, if not most, of Sun Life's Head Office employees in 1979 were not fluent in French. Sun Life was quite clear that this was the reason for its move when it made the announcement. The PQ government was quick to label Sun Life \"bad corporate citizens\" and claimed that if ''\"they had only warned us, we could have worked something out.\"''<ref name=CBC1>{{cite episode |title=CBC reports on Sun Life leaving Montreal in 1978 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/language-culture/fighting-words-bill-101/sun-life-packs-up.html |accessdate=2014-08-18 |date=January 6, 1978 |series=The World At Six |credits=Reporters: Karen Birchard, Richard Inwood |work=[[CBC Radio]]}}</ref>\n\nThe downsizing of Sun Life's Montreal office did not take place overnight. Transfers and moves occurred on a departmental basis and did not commence until several months after the announcement. By 1980, 300 head office employees were located in Toronto.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1076086/sun-life-demenagement-montreal-toronto-pq-archives |title = Il y a 40 ans : Le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement surprise de la Sun Life}}</ref>\n\nThere were several other key activities in the post-war years. This included a decision by Sun Life to leave many markets, including China and India, because of economic and political changes. In 1962, Sun Life became a mutual company and repurchased its shares for $65 million in total. In 1973, Sun Life opened its American subsidiary's new headquarters in Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts, located outside [[Boston]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===1980s \u2013 1990s===\nSun Life continued to expand its wealth management business with the 1982 acquisition of [[MFS Investment Management|Massachusetts Financial Services]] (MFS), the Boston-based investment management and mutual fund company. It entered the mutual fund business in Canada by forming Spectrum Mutual Fund Services in 1987 (subsequently sold to CI Financial) and a decade later, acquired McLean Budden, a Canadian investment management firm (subsequently folded into MFS).\nInternational expansion continued in the 1990s. In 1995, Sun Life entered the Indonesia market through local company PT Asuransi Modern Sun Life, now called PT Sun Life Financial Indonesia and opened a Representative Office in Beijing in preparation to enter China. A year later, Sun Life opened a services centre in Waterford, Ireland, to provide technology and business processing support for Sun Life business units.\n\nIn 1999, Sun Life officially returned to [[India]] and [[China]] when it established two joint ventures \u2013 Birla Sun Life in India with local partner [[Aditya Birla Group]], and Sun Life Everbright in China with partner [[China Everbright Group]]. Over the next decade, both operations grew rapidly \u2013 by September 2008, there were 132,460 Birla Sun Life advisors working in 600 branches across India while Sun Life Everbright opened its sixth branch in Guangzhou, bringing its presence to 18 cities in [[China]].\n\n[[Image:Sun-Life-Building-June-2007.jpg|thumb|right|The Sun Life building in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]]]\n\n=== 2000's ===\nIn early 1998, Sun Life announced its intention to [[demutualize]]. In March 2000, its Initial Public Offering (IPO) started the trading of Sun Life Financial Inc. shares on the Toronto (TSX), New York (NYSE) and Philippine (PSE) stock exchanges.\n\nIn 2002, Sun Life combined its operations with [[Clarica Life Insurance]] of [[Waterloo, Ontario]]. Founded in 1870 as ''Mutual Life of Canada'', Clarica was known as The Mutual Group before it went public in 1999. The former head office for Mutual Life Assurance Company at 227 King Street South in Waterloo became the home to Sun Life's Canadian operations, while a regional office and Sun Life's corporate headquarters remained in Toronto. The company also maintains regional offices in [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]], [[Edmonton]], [[Vancouver]], [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] and [[Calgary]]. After it integrated operations, the company used the Clarica brand name for certain products and activities until 2007.\n\nIn 2005, Sun Life opened a service centre in Gurgaon, [[India]] to provide business processing and technology support for Sun Life Financial business units around the world. That same year, Sun Life purchased CMG Asia and CommServe Financial, the Hong Kong insurance and pension operations of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, tripling its customer base and adding group insurance and pensions to its business lines.\n\nIn 2007, Sun Life purchased the U.S. employee benefits business of Genworth Financial, placing itself in the top 10 in the U.S. group benefits market.\n\nIn 2008, Sun Life sold its 37% interest in CI Financial Income Fund to [[Scotiabank]]. Sun Life had originally acquired a significant [[ownership interest]] in the firm by selling its Canadian mutual fund subsidiaries to CI Financial in 2002.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2002/05/22/cifund020522.html |title= CBC News - CI Fund acquires Sun Life mutual fund business |accessdate=2008-12-28 |date=22 May 2002}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Sun Life began an aggressive nationwide ad campaign in the [[United States]] touting its strength and the fact that it did not accept any [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|bailout]] money.\n\n=== 2010's ===\nIn 2013, Sun Life acquired 49% [[Aviva|Aviva PLC's]] Malaysian insurance joint venture with lender [[CIMB Group]]. Sun Life acquired the business along with Malaysian state investor [[Khazanah Nasional]], which also purchased 49%. They each paid approximately CDN$300 million. CIMB retains 2% interest.\n\nIn 2015, Sun Life acquired the Employee Benefits business of Assurant Inc. The transaction closed in March 2016, creating the sixth-largest group benefits business in the U.S.\n\nIn 2017, the [[Toronto Raptors]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] announced that Sun Life will become their jersey sponsor beginning with the 2017-18 NBA season.

The series revolves around seventeen-year-old high school student [[Clay Jensen]] and his deceased friend [[Hannah Baker]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/13-reasons-why/1032508|title=13 Reasons Why |website=TVGuide.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> who takes her own life after having to face a culture of gossip, bullying and sexual assault at her high school and a lack of support from her friends, her family and her school. A box of [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]] recorded by Hannah in the weeks preceding her suicide detail why she chose to end her life. The series is produced by July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, [[Anonymous Content]] and [[Paramount Television]], with Yorkey and [[Diana Son]] serving as [[showrunners]].\n\n[[Dylan Minnette]] stars as Clay Jensen, while [[Katherine Langford]] plays [[Hannah Baker]].

A film from [[Universal Pictures]] based on ''Thirteen Reasons Why'' began development in February 2011, with [[Selena Gomez]] set to star as Hannah, before being shelved in favor of a television series and Netflix ordering an adaptation as a limited series in October 2015, with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/selena-gomez-13-reasons-why-netflix-1201620194/ |title=Netflix Adapting '13 Reasons Why' Into Selena Gomez Series (Exclusive) |last=Wagmeister |first=Elizabeth |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=October 29, 2015 |accessdate=June 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first season was released on Netflix on March 31, 2017.

Inside he discovers thirteen [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] tapes recorded by [[Hannah Baker]], his deceased classmate who killed herself two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is an implication that he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide (mostly referring to both her friends and enemies).<ref>[https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Differences-Between-13-Reasons-Why-Book-TV-Show-4340472519 Big Differences Between the Book and TV Show Versions of 13 Reasons Why|POPSUGAR Entertainment]</ref>\n\nIn season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who were present in court at the trial.\n\nClay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavors to expose the corrupted culture of the high school and its favor of wealthy [[Jock (stereotype)|jocks]] over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah.\n\nSeason three is set eight months after the end of season two. Clay and his friends are struggling to cope with the cover-up of Tyler's attempted massacre at the Spring Fling, while helping him towards recovery. However, acrimonious tensions reach a boiling point during Liberty High's Homecoming game, which results in the murder of Bryce Walker. The students of Liberty High are once again forced under the microscope as the investigation into Bryce's death threatens to expose their darkest secrets. <!-- , while the factual basis of the dramatic portrayals of the various events increasingly blur between actual portrayal and the desired perception of the various characters who present before the court during the trial. --> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/node/43405054|title=4 Reasons There Should Not Be Another Season of 13 Reasons Why|last=Robson|first=Shannon Vestal|date=April 28, 2017|website=POPSUGAR Entertainment|language=en-US|access-date=October 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align  = right\n| footer = [[Dylan Minnette]] and [[Katherine Langford]]\n| image1 = Dylan Minnette in 2018.jpg\n| width1 = 136\n| image2 = Katherine Langford in 2018.jpg\n| width2 = 120\n}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Dylan Minnette]] as [[Clay Jensen]], a close friend of Hannah who becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Katherine Langford]] as [[Hannah Baker]] (seasons 1\u20132), a teenager whose suicide and recorded audio cassettes spark the events of the series<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Christian Navarro]] as Tony Padilla, Clay's best friend at Liberty High who tries to help him deal with Hannah's death\n* [[Alisha Boe]] as Jessica Davis, a student who starts attending Liberty High at the same time as Hannah<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Brandon Flynn]] as Justin Foley,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/241936/who-is-13-reasons-why-brandon-flynn-dating-now|title=Is Brandon Flynn Of 13 Reasons Why Dating Anyone After His Last Big Breakup?| first=Alexis|last=Reliford|date=September 1, 2019|accessdate=February 24, 2020|work=[[Refinery29]]}}</ref> a student at Liberty High who comes from an abusive family and is in a relationship with Jessica.<ref name=\"S1Cast\" /> He is responsible for setting the events of the series into motion by being the first person to humiliate Hannah after their first date.

Schedeen of [[IGN]] praised the cast, particularly Minnette and Langford, stating: \"Langford shines in the lead role{{nbsp}}... [and] embodies that optimism and that profound sadness [of Hannah's] as well. Minnette's Clay is, by design, a much more stoic and reserved character{{nbsp}}... and does a fine job in what's often a difficult role.\"<ref name=\"IGNresponse\" /> Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the chemistry of Langford and Minnette, saying that \"watching these two young actors together is pure pleasure\", while Schedeen of IGN also agreed, saying that they are \"often at their best together, channeling just the right sort of warm but awkward chemistry you'd expect from two teens who can't quite admit to their feelings for one another\". Feinberg of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' also praises both actors: \"Langford's heartbreaking openness makes you root for a fate you know isn't possible. The actress' performance is full of dynamic range, setting it against Minnette's often more complicated task in differentiating between moods that mostly go from uncomfortable to gloomy to red-eyed, hygiene-starved despair.\"<ref name=\"THRresponse\" />\n\nRyan of ''Variety'' also gave praise to not only the two leads, but also the supporting cast of actors, particularly Kate Walsh's performance as Hannah's mother, which Ryan describes as \"career-best work\".<ref name=\"Varietyresponse\" /> Positive mentions from various critics, such as Ryan, Feinberg and Schedeen, were also given to the supporting cast of actors (most particularly Alisha Boe, Miles Heizer and Christian Navarro's respective performances of Jessica, Alex and Tony).

Feinberg highlighted the series' directors, saying: \"A Sundance-friendly gallery of directors including Tom McCarthy, Gregg Araki and Carl Franklin keeps the performances grounded and the extremes from feeling exploitative\",<ref name=\"Indiewireresponse\" /> while Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the storytelling: \"The storytelling techniques are powerful{{nbsp}}... [as it] builds on the world established in the previous hour, as we continually encounter new facets of Hannah's life and new characters. The background on the show keeps getting deeper, richer.\"<ref name=\"BGresponse\" />\n\nConversely, the series has also received criticism over its portrayal of teen angst. Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a critical review, writing, \"the show doesn't make [Hannah's] downward progress convincing. It too often feels artificial, like a very long public service announcement.\" He also criticized the plot device that has Clay listening to the tapes one by one instead of all in one sitting like the other teens did, which Hale felt was unbelievable: \"It makes no sense as anything but a plot device, and you'll find yourself, like Clay's antagonists, yelling at him to listen to the rest of tapes already.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hale |first1=Mike |title=Review: '13 Reasons Why' She Killed Herself, Drawn Out on Netflix |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |accessdate=April 10, 2017 |work=The New York Times |date=March 30, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410165508/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |archivedate=April 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Rebecca Nicholson praised some aspects of the series, including the performances from Minnette and Walsh, but was troubled by much of the plot, writing, \"a storyline that suggests the love of a sweet boy might have sorted all this out added to an uneasy feeling that stayed with me\". Nicholson was skeptical that the series would appeal to older viewers, unlike other series set in high school such as ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' and ''[[My So-Called Life]]'': \"It lacks the crossover wit of its forebears{{nbsp}}... It's too tied up in conveying the message that terrible behaviour can have horrible consequences to deal in any subtleties or shades of feeling.

Each warning voice over is read by a different cast member at the end of the episode, with Katherine Langford reading in her native Australian accent in her voice-overs. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.communitynews.com.au/cockburn-gazette/news/13-reasons-headspace-issues-warning-new-netflix-show/ |title=13 Reasons Why: Headspace issues warning over new Netflix show |date=April 18, 2017 |publisher=[[Community Newspaper Group]] |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419101534/http://www.communitynews.com.au/cockburn-gazette/news/13-reasons-headspace-issues-warning-new-netflix-show/ |archivedate=April 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/headspace-issues-warning-against-netflix-show-13-reasons-why/news-story/02014de19bd8daee573224c0c714eeae |title=Netflix series 13 Reasons Why under fire from mental health experts |work=news.com.au |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418233845/http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/headspace-issues-warning-against-netflix-show-13-reasons-why/news-story/02014de19bd8daee573224c0c714eeae |archivedate=April 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.headspace.org.au/news/dangerous-content-in-13-reasons-why/ |title=headspace: dangerous content in 13 Reasons Why |work=headspace.org.au |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419104903/https://www.headspace.org.au/news/dangerous-content-in-13-reasons-why/ |archivedate=April 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the graphic nature of the series and New Zealand's high youth suicide rate, which was the highest among the 34{{efn|name=OECD note|The 2009\u20132012 data exclude Latvia, which became the 35th OECD member country on July 1, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/document/58/0,3746,en_2649_201185_1889402_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=List of OECD Member countries \u2013 Ratification of the Convention on the OECD |website=Oecd.org |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123031730/http://www.oecd.org/document/58/0%2C3746%2Cen_2649_201185_1889402_1_1_1_1%2C00.html |archivedate=November 23, 2015}}</ref>}} [[OECD]] countries during 2009 to 2012,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Social Report 2016 \u2013 Te p\u016brongo oranga tangata |url=http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/health/suicide.html |publisher=Ministry of Social Development \u2013 New Zealand Government |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406215234/http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/health/suicide.html |archivedate=April 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Mconnell |first1=Glenn |title=The highest rate of teen suicide in the developed world |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/85305366/the-highest-rate-of-teen-suicide-in-the-developed-world |website=Stuff.co.nz |accessdate=April 28, 2017}}</ref> the [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (New Zealand)|Office of Film & Literature Classification]] in the country created a new rating, \"RP18\", allowing individuals aged 18 and over to watch the series alone and those below having to watch it with supervision from a parent or guardian.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Zealand teens can only watch Netflix show 13 Reasons Why with their parents |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39732715/new-zealand-teens-can-only-watch-netflix-show-13-reasons-why-with-their-parents |website=BBC |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427212208/http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39732715/new-zealand-teens-can-only-watch-netflix-show-13-reasons-why-with-their-parents |archivedate=April 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=13 Reasons Why: Censors make new RP18 rating for controversial Netflix show |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/91956245/13-reasons-why-censors-make-new-rp18-rating-for-controversial-netflix-show |website=stuff.co.nz |accessdate=April 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=We stayed very true to the book and that's initially what [author] [[Jay Asher]] created was a beautifully tragic, complicated yet suspenseful story and I think that's what we wanted to do{{nbsp}}...

Alex Moen, a [[school counselor]] in Minneapolis, took issue with the series' entire plotline as \"essentially a fantasy of what someone who is considering suicide might have\u2014that once you commit suicide, you can still communicate with your loved ones, and people will suddenly realize everything that you were going through and the depth of your pain{{nbsp}}... That the cute, sensitive boy will fall in love with you and seek justice for you, and you'll be able to orchestrate it, and in so doing kind of still be able to live.\"<ref name=\"Slate piece\" /> Other counselors criticized the depiction of Hannah's attempt to reach out to Mr. Porter as dangerously misleading, since not only does he miss obvious signs of her suicidal ideations, but says he cannot report her sexual assault to the police without her identifying the assailant. School counselors are often portrayed as ineffective or clueless in popular culture, Moen says, but Porter's behavior in the series goes beyond that, to being unethical and possibly illegal. \"It's ridiculous! Counselors are not police. We don't have to launch an investigation. We bring whatever information we do have to the police\", she told ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]''.<ref name=\"Slate piece\" />\n\nIn May 2017, the [[Canadian Mental Health Association]] (CMHA) along with the Centre for Suicide Prevention (CSP) released a statement with similar concerns to the ones raised by NASP. CMHA believed that the series may glamorize suicide, and that some content may lead to distress in viewers, particularly in younger viewers. Furthermore, the portrayal of Hannah's suicide does not follow the media guidelines as set out by the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention (CASP) and the [[American Association of Suicidology]]. CMHA and CASP did praise the series for raising awareness about \"[[suicide|this preventable health concern]],\" adding that, \"Raising awareness needs to be done in a safe and responsible manner. A large and growing body of Canadian and international research has found clear links between increases in suicide rates and harmful media portrayals of suicide.\" Ways in which the portrayals of suicide may cause harm, according to CMHA and CASP, include the following: \"They may simplify suicide, such as, by suggesting that bullying alone is the cause; they may make suicide seem romantic, such as, by putting it in the context of a Hollywood plot line; they may portray suicide as a logical or viable option; they may display graphic representations of suicide which may be harmful to viewers, especially young ones; and/or they may advance the false notion that suicides are a way to teach others a lesson.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |title=CMHA National Statement Responding to Netflix Series: 13 Reasons Why \u2013 Canadian Mental Health Association |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504044326/http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |archivedate=May 4, 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nasponline.org/assets/documents/Resources%20and%20Publications/Resources/Crisis/13%20Reasons%20Why%20Guidance_FINAL.pdf National Association of School Psychologists.

On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is an implication that he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide (mostly referring to both her friends and enemies).<ref>[https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Differences-Between-13-Reasons-Why-Book-TV-Show-4340472519 Big Differences Between the Book and TV Show Versions of 13 Reasons Why|POPSUGAR Entertainment]</ref>\n\nIn season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who were present in court at the trial.\n\nClay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavors to expose the corrupted culture of the high school and its favor of wealthy [[Jock (stereotype)|jocks]] over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah.\n\nSeason three is set eight months after the end of season two. Clay and his friends are struggling to cope with the cover-up of Tyler's attempted massacre at the Spring Fling, while helping him towards recovery. However, acrimonious tensions reach a boiling point during Liberty High's Homecoming game, which results in the murder of Bryce Walker. The students of Liberty High are once again forced under the microscope as the investigation into Bryce's death threatens to expose their darkest secrets. <!-- , while the factual basis of the dramatic portrayals of the various events increasingly blur between actual portrayal and the desired perception of the various characters who present before the court during the trial. --> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/node/43405054|title=4 Reasons There Should Not Be Another Season of 13 Reasons Why|last=Robson|first=Shannon Vestal|date=April 28, 2017|website=POPSUGAR Entertainment|language=en-US|access-date=October 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align  = right\n| footer = [[Dylan Minnette]] and [[Katherine Langford]]\n| image1 = Dylan Minnette in 2018.jpg\n| width1 = 136\n| image2 = Katherine Langford in 2018.jpg\n| width2 = 120\n}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Dylan Minnette]] as [[Clay Jensen]], a close friend of Hannah who becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Katherine Langford]] as [[Hannah Baker]] (seasons 1\u20132), a teenager whose suicide and recorded audio cassettes spark the events of the series<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Christian Navarro]] as Tony Padilla, Clay's best friend at Liberty High who tries to help him deal with Hannah's death\n* [[Alisha Boe]] as Jessica Davis, a student who starts attending Liberty High at the same time as Hannah<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Brandon Flynn]] as Justin Foley,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/241936/who-is-13-reasons-why-brandon-flynn-dating-now|title=Is Brandon Flynn Of 13 Reasons Why Dating Anyone After His Last Big Breakup?| first=Alexis|last=Reliford|date=September 1, 2019|accessdate=February 24, 2020|work=[[Refinery29]]}}</ref> a student at Liberty High who comes from an abusive family and is in a relationship with Jessica.<ref name=\"S1Cast\" /> He is responsible for setting the events of the series into motion by being the first person to humiliate Hannah after their first date.

While Hannah is on her way to find a phone to call the authorities, the downed stop sign causes a serious accident at that intersection, resulting in the death of Clay's friend Jeff Atkins, which was incorrectly considered a drunk driving accident. When Hannah tries to tell Clay about the stop sign, he pushes her away, thinking she is being unnecessarily dramatic. In the present, Jessica's behavior becomes more erratic.

In the present, everyone on Hannah's list is subpoenaed to testify in the lawsuit between the Bakers and the school. The subjects of the tapes disagree over what to do. Tyler eventually suggests they pin everything on Bryce, but Alex refuses and says they should tell the truth. Sheri turns herself in. Clay goes to Bryce's house, on the pretext of buying marijuana, to confront him about the events of the night he raped Hannah. Clay provokes Bryce to attack him and is badly beaten.

In the present, Clay gives Tony the tape of his conversation with Bryce to copy before confronting Mr. Porter about meeting with Hannah on her last day. As the depositions begin, Marcus and Courtney deny their involvement in Hannah's death as much as possible while Zach and Jessica admit their mistakes.

When the customers notice Justin is keeping some of the drugs for personal use, Seth threatens Justin and demands the money. Shortly afterward, the police arrive. Seth escapes while Justin is arrested. Justin calls Bryce to bail him out, and asks him to not tell Clay. Bryce pays off Seth, and gives Justin some oxycodone to feed the addiction, and prevent him from overdosing. Despite this, they do not resume their friendship.

At home, Justin admits he stole the watch, not the pills, on the day of the funeral, and traded it to Seth for the pills. He also admits that on the night of Homecoming, he was getting high.

Schedeen of [[IGN]] praised the cast, particularly Minnette and Langford, stating: \"Langford shines in the lead role{{nbsp}}... [and] embodies that optimism and that profound sadness [of Hannah's] as well. Minnette's Clay is, by design, a much more stoic and reserved character{{nbsp}}... and does a fine job in what's often a difficult role.\"<ref name=\"IGNresponse\" /> Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the chemistry of Langford and Minnette, saying that \"watching these two young actors together is pure pleasure\", while Schedeen of IGN also agreed, saying that they are \"often at their best together, channeling just the right sort of warm but awkward chemistry you'd expect from two teens who can't quite admit to their feelings for one another\". Feinberg of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' also praises both actors: \"Langford's heartbreaking openness makes you root for a fate you know isn't possible. The actress' performance is full of dynamic range, setting it against Minnette's often more complicated task in differentiating between moods that mostly go from uncomfortable to gloomy to red-eyed, hygiene-starved despair.\"<ref name=\"THRresponse\" />\n\nRyan of ''Variety'' also gave praise to not only the two leads, but also the supporting cast of actors, particularly Kate Walsh's performance as Hannah's mother, which Ryan describes as \"career-best work\".<ref name=\"Varietyresponse\" /> Positive mentions from various critics, such as Ryan, Feinberg and Schedeen, were also given to the supporting cast of actors (most particularly Alisha Boe, Miles Heizer and Christian Navarro's respective performances of Jessica, Alex and Tony). Liz Shannon Miller of ''[[Indiewire]]'', who enjoyed the series and gave it a positive score of B+, gave praise to the racial, gender and complex diversity of its supporting cast of teens.<ref name=\"Varietyresponse\" /><ref name=\"IGNresponse\" /><ref name=\"THRresponse\" /><ref name=\"Indiewireresponse\" />\n\nAnother aspect frequently mentioned within reviews was the series's mature and emotional approach to its dark and adult subject matter.

Feinberg highlighted the series' directors, saying: \"A Sundance-friendly gallery of directors including Tom McCarthy, Gregg Araki and Carl Franklin keeps the performances grounded and the extremes from feeling exploitative\",<ref name=\"Indiewireresponse\" /> while Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the storytelling: \"The storytelling techniques are powerful{{nbsp}}... [as it] builds on the world established in the previous hour, as we continually encounter new facets of Hannah's life and new characters.

Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a critical review, writing, \"the show doesn't make [Hannah's] downward progress convincing. It too often feels artificial, like a very long public service announcement.\" He also criticized the plot device that has Clay listening to the tapes one by one instead of all in one sitting like the other teens did, which Hale felt was unbelievable: \"It makes no sense as anything but a plot device, and you'll find yourself, like Clay's antagonists, yelling at him to listen to the rest of tapes already.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hale |first1=Mike |title=Review: '13 Reasons Why' She Killed Herself, Drawn Out on Netflix |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |accessdate=April 10, 2017 |work=The New York Times |date=March 30, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410165508/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |archivedate=April 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Rebecca Nicholson praised some aspects of the series, including the performances from Minnette and Walsh, but was troubled by much of the plot, writing, \"a storyline that suggests the love of a sweet boy might have sorted all this out added to an uneasy feeling that stayed with me\". Nicholson was skeptical that the series would appeal to older viewers, unlike other series set in high school such as ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' and ''[[My So-Called Life]]'': \"It lacks the crossover wit of its forebears{{nbsp}}... It's too tied up in conveying the message that terrible behaviour can have horrible consequences to deal in any subtleties or shades of feeling. It's largely one-note \u2013 and that note is horrifying.

He praised Langford's \"stunning performance\" but noted, \"There are times when we simply don't believe the characters, when what they do or say isn't consistent with who we've been led to believe they are{{nbsp}}... At times, [Hannah] is self-possessed and indifferent at best to the behavior of the popular kids. At other times, though, relatively minor misperceived slights seem to send her into an emotional tailspin.

Alex Moen, a [[school counselor]] in Minneapolis, took issue with the series' entire plotline as \"essentially a fantasy of what someone who is considering suicide might have\u2014that once you commit suicide, you can still communicate with your loved ones, and people will suddenly realize everything that you were going through and the depth of your pain{{nbsp}}... That the cute, sensitive boy will fall in love with you and seek justice for you, and you'll be able to orchestrate it, and in so doing kind of still be able to live.\"<ref name=\"Slate piece\" /> Other counselors criticized the depiction of Hannah's attempt to reach out to Mr. Porter as dangerously misleading, since not only does he miss obvious signs of her suicidal ideations, but says he cannot report her sexual assault to the police without her identifying the assailant. School counselors are often portrayed as ineffective or clueless in popular culture, Moen says, but Porter's behavior in the series goes beyond that, to being unethical and possibly illegal. \"It's ridiculous! Counselors are not police. We don't have to launch an investigation. We bring whatever information we do have to the police\", she told ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]''.<ref name=\"Slate piece\" />\n\nIn May 2017, the [[Canadian Mental Health Association]] (CMHA) along with the Centre for Suicide Prevention (CSP) released a statement with similar concerns to the ones raised by NASP. CMHA believed that the series may glamorize suicide, and that some content may lead to distress in viewers, particularly in younger viewers. Furthermore, the portrayal of Hannah's suicide does not follow the media guidelines as set out by the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention (CASP) and the [[American Association of Suicidology]]. CMHA and CASP did praise the series for raising awareness about \"[[suicide|this preventable health concern]],\" adding that, \"Raising awareness needs to be done in a safe and responsible manner. A large and growing body of Canadian and international research has found clear links between increases in suicide rates and harmful media portrayals of suicide.\" Ways in which the portrayals of suicide may cause harm, according to CMHA and CASP, include the following: \"They may simplify suicide, such as, by suggesting that bullying alone is the cause; they may make suicide seem romantic, such as, by putting it in the context of a Hollywood plot line; they may portray suicide as a logical or viable option; they may display graphic representations of suicide which may be harmful to viewers, especially young ones; and/or they may advance the false notion that suicides are a way to teach others a lesson.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |title=CMHA National Statement Responding to Netflix Series: 13 Reasons Why \u2013 Canadian Mental Health Association |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504044326/http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |archivedate=May 4, 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nasponline.org/assets/documents/Resources%20and%20Publications/Resources/Crisis/13%20Reasons%20Why%20Guidance_FINAL.pdf National Association of School Psychologists.

Four years after the events with Tui, Robin tries to adjust back to life in Sydney while dealing with residual [[PTSD]] from shooting Al Parker. Parker turned witness in the case of the paedophile ring in exchange for immunity, but has now filed a civil suit against Robin, claiming the shooting was personally motivated. Robin's daughter, Mary, is now nearly 18 and exhibiting signs of mental instability that her adoptive parents worry is more than teen angst. Unbeknownst to her parents, Mary is dating a 42-year-old German, Alexander, nicknamed \"Puss\", who lives above a brothel, Silk 41. Mary is enamoured with Puss, who claims to be \"empowering\" the young Asian prostitutes by teaching them English and other life lessons. Mary is aggressively rebelling and openly hostile against her adoptive parents, Pyke and Julia, who are getting a divorce after Julia came out as a lesbian. Pyke and Julia are appalled after meeting Puss, who informs them he plans to marry Mary. Robin's new boss, Detective Sergeant Adrian Butler, brings a large stuffed panda to a young Asian woman. Brett, a socially awkward university student who frequents brothels, worries because he can't find a prostitute named Cinnamon, whom he believes is his girlfriend. Meanwhile, the suitcase washes up on [[Bondi Beach]] and it contains the decomposing body of a woman. Robin and a rookie constable, the awkward Miranda, are assigned to the case.\n| LineColor       = 764E4E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 8\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = The Loved One\n| DirectedBy      = [[Ariel Kleiman]]\n| WrittenBy       = Jane Campion & Gerard Lee\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|08|03|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 2.38\n| ShortSummary    = A flashback reveals that four weeks earlier, Johnno was arrested on their wedding day after his pot farm was raided, and Robin left him after discovering he had cheated on her as well. Meanwhile, Tui is now raising her son at the women's commune. In the present, Robin, who had three miscarriages while with Johnno, has nightmares about babies. Robin is obsessed with the case of the Asian Jane Doe found in the suitcase, dubbed \"China Girl,\" whose cause of death was possibly strangulation. With no matching reports from missing persons, they suspect she was working as a prostitute, possibly entering the country with a false passport. Robin and Miranda observe the autopsy, where the coroner learns that China Girl was about 17 weeks pregnant. An emotional Miranda leaves the autopsy when she sees the tiny foetus, and she later reveals she is 18 weeks pregnant. Robin is irritated by Miranda, but Adrian insists they work together, because nobody else will work with either of them. They visit brothels, which are [[Prostitution in Australia#New South Wales|legal in Sydney]]. Robin notices a large stuffed panda at one, Silk 41, and asks Adrian what happened to the one he had in his office. He claims he gave it to his son. Brett goes to Silk 41 to find Cinnamon, and is eventually told she went to [[Canberra]]. He refuses to believe she would without telling him. Robin finally works up the courage to contact Mary, leaving a letter at the Edwards' home. She first meets with Pyke and Julia at his office, and Julia angrily informs her that Mary's behavioural problems began four years earlier, after she never received a reply to the letter she sent Robin. She chastises her for not having the decency to respond, and that Mary agonised over whether she had said something wrong in the letter. Julia storms off, but Pyke is more patient and listen as Robin explains she was just 16 years old when Mary was born. Robin is able to meet Mary, who behaves oddly and exhibits very low self-esteem. Mary reveals she assumed that she was the product of rape, which Robin confirms. Mary volunteers to murder her mother's rapist, and Robin confesses that she never knew who the father was, being a victim of a gang rape. A DNA test on the male foetus reveals China Girl was not his biological mother, mystifying the pathologist. Robin, though, realises the dead girl was acting as a surrogate mother, changing the course of the investigation.\n| LineColor       = 764E4E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 9\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Surrogate\n| DirectedBy      = Ariel Kleiman\n| WrittenBy       = Jane Campion & Gerard Lee\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|08|10|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 1.97\n| ShortSummary    = Robin believes that China Girl was acting as an illegal surrogate, as the law states surrogates must be over 25 and have already had a child of their own, and thus the biological parents were working outside the normal system. She and Miranda visit a fertility clinic, where a doctor tells Robin that although many parents may be desperate enough to try illegal surrogacy, that would bring great risk as the law would side with the surrogate mother, who could decide to keep the child. Robin comes out to see Miranda arguing with the receptionist. Robin gets a lead after potentially finding the biological parents for whom China Girl was a surrogate, after a mentally unstable woman is wandering in traffic, crying about her missing baby. Robin visits the woman, Felicity, and her husband, Mike, in the psychiatric ward. Mike, who has a criminal record for cocaine possession, eventually agrees to take a DNA test. Robin is irritated by Miranda, who smokes and drinks despite her pregnancy, and who is now sleeping with Robin's brother on top of having an affair with the married Adrian. Another detective, Stally, continues to make unwanted advances on Robin. After some investigating, Pyke and Julia confront Puss with the fact that he is already married, causing him to have a bizarre outburst in a restaurant and a further rift between them and Mary. Puss locks himself in his apartment and refuses to see Mary or any of the prostitutes in to see him. After being called by Pyke, Robin takes Mary to her apartment, where Mary breaks down because of Puss refusing to see her. Robin's mediation with Al, now confined to a wheelchair, does not go as planned when he tries to kill her before it begins.\n| LineColor       = 764E4E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 10\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = Birthday\n| DirectedBy      = Ariel Kleiman\n| WrittenBy       = Jane Campion & Gerard Lee\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|08|17|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 1.92\n| ShortSummary    = Puss manipulates Mary to start working as a prostitute when she turns 18, mocking her for her privileged upbringing and implying she thinks she is better than her friends at the brothel. Pyke and Mary attend her school's Daddy/Daughter dance, which he has been looking forward to. Mary at first stops to check on Puss, who talks his way into attending, claiming he is her \"Daddy.\" At the dance, he interrupts Pyke and Mary's waltz and causes outrage when he begins dancing sexually with Mary, and is thrown out. Brett, who has seen the news about the Asian Jane Doe, contacts the police and gives them a photo of Cinnamon. Upset that the police consider him a suspect, Brett tells them about the creepy guy at the brothel. As he describes him, Robin fears he is talking about Mary's boyfriend. Mary takes some of the prostitutes (whom she claims are students) to the beach with her, Pyke and Robin, to teach them how to swim. Puss comes along and, after noticing Robin's air of hostility towards him, he brings up her rape, makes sexually suggestive remarks and then violently attacks her, biting her on the nose. Mary, screaming and hitting herself in the head, convinces Robin not to press charges. The DNA test reveals that Felicity and Mike are not the biological parents, but Robin is shocked to find out they have three young Asian women as surrogate mothers. Mary asks Dang to start working there, and Dang refuses. On Mary's 18th birthday, Puss takes Mary to a hookers' strip. She says she is afraid and he hits her in the face. He tells her that is worse than what any John will do to her, and now she doesn't have to be afraid, and then leaves her there. Unable to complete the act, she is thrown out of a car by a John, and phones Robin for help. In Robin's car, Mary sees the photo of Cinnamon, whom she recognises.  Robin hints that Mary is in great danger. At Robin's apartment, Mary breaks down crying, saying she doesn't know how to leave him.\n| LineColor       = 764E4E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 11\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n| Title           = Who's Your Daddy\n| DirectedBy      = Jane Campion\n| WrittenBy       = Jane Campion & Gerard Lee\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|08|24|df=y}}<ref name=\"airdate\"/>\n| Viewers         = 1.69\n| ShortSummary    = Mary leaves the safety of Robin's home to reconnect with Puss, who learns from her that Robin is looking into the murder of Cinnamon. Robin tells Pyke about picking Mary up from under the overpass. Pyke wants to kill Puss, and Robin says that even if she arrests him, she knows he won't be held long. Brett becomes further unhinged after identifying Cinnamon's body and begins suffering from hallucinations. Miranda has another crying spell at work and admits she fears her baby has died. They return to the same fertility clinic where Miranda shows the receptionist the photo of Cinnamon, and demands to know if she recognises her. Miranda informs her that the girl in the photo was not a student, but a sex worker, and then starts screaming that she wants an ultrasound. Robin takes her out to the beach to calm down, where Miranda reveals she is not actually pregnant and that her pregnancy is being done via surrogacy because of her own fertility issues. Miranda says their surrogate is pregnant with a daughter but has gone missing, and she fears it is because of a miscarriage. Miranda still insists that their surrogate was a student, but Robin asks if Adrian gave her a stuffed panda, because she saw one at Silk 41. A doctor at the fertility clinic, unaware that the girls were sex workers, connects Robin with a couple who identify Cinnamon as their surrogate mother, whose real name was Pathma. With the assistance of Mary's schoolfriend Michaela, Puss directs some sort of \"art film\" with the prostitutes and Caucasian babies, set in a Thai village. Mary becomes worried when Caramel, another pregnant girl from Silk 41, is taken away by Puss and Dang. Connected by concern over Mary and Puss, Robin and Pyke grow closer, much to Julia's annoyance and jealousy. Brett, armed with a rifle, shows up at the brothel and demands to see Puss. Puss pushes Mary in front of him and escapes in the elevator as Brett fires the gun.\n| LineColor       = 764E4E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 12\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n| Title           = The Battle of the Mothers\n\n\n| DirectedBy      = Ariel Kleiman\n| WrittenBy       = Jane Campion & Gerard Lee\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|08|31|df=y}}<ref name=\"airdate\">{{cite web|title=Next on (2)|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p057mh5s/broadcasts/upcoming|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref>\n| Viewers         = 1.84\n| ShortSummary    =Robin and Pyke make love when she receives a late-night call from Mary. Nobody speaks, but Robin hears people arguing about a taxi fare and Mary screams before the phone is disconnected. Miranda calls and tells her there was a shooting at Silk 41, and that the suspect is Brett Iles, who took Mary hostage. The taxi is found at Bondi Beach, with the taxi driver shot dead. Security footage from the brothel shows Puss escaping as Brett shot Bootie, before leaving with Mary. The security footage also shows another room, in which Miranda spots her surrogate. That room is not at the brothel, and none of the sex workers know its location. The next day, Pyke and Julia go to Mary's school to appeal to her classmates for any information. Michaela tells them about a place on [[Liverpool Street, Sydney|Liverpool Street]] called Stasi Cafe, where Mary first met Puss. The manhunt for Brett intensifies, but Robin is convinced he's still on Bondi Beach, now packed with people. She notices an empty case of beer that was there the previous night. She and Miranda move in and try to quietly move beachgoers away from the box. One group refuses to move and distracts Robin while Miranda discovers a shoe sticking out from the sand. She kicks the box away to find Brett's face peeking out, his eyes closed. Miranda moves in to check his pulse. Robin yells at Miranda to draw her weapon but she freezes. Brett suddenly pulls the rifle out of the sand and shoots Miranda in the abdomen. Robin jumps on him, her gun to his head, demanding to know where Mary is. Meanwhile, Mary shows up at home, unharmed. Crying, Julia begs her to stay, promising that she will change and try to understand her, but Mary leaves. Robin visits the hospital, where Miranda is in a coma, her outlook grim. Adrian vows to tell everyone he loves her, and begs Robin to find their surrogate. Robin finds Pyke at Stasi Cafe, where they kiss and embrace. He leaves after getting a text from Julia informing him that Mary's passport is missing. Robin then finds Puss in the kitchen, where she cuts him with a kitchen knife. He claims that Cinnamon hanged herself. Robin puts her gun to his head and he discloses the address of the missing surrogates, giving her the key. She shows up to find not only Adrian but the other expectant couples, including Felicia and Mike, all of whom received calls from their surrogates. They find the apartment empty, with a DVD left behind. Meanwhile, Mary escorts the dozen or so surrogates through the airport. Puss shows up as they board the plane, and Mary, upset, tells him that she could have been shot while he fled. He lies and tells her the elevator doors closed and he couldn't do anything. She asks what will happen to the babies and who will love them, and he tells them the \"people who made them\" will buy them back. She pulls away and he slaps her. She hits him back, over and over. Caramel calls for Mary, but she refuses to board and watches him leave. At the apartment, Adrian plays the DVD, which shows the video shot at the brothel of the Thai women with the babies. Puss narrates, mocking the parents, and accusing the West of exploiting the bodies of oppressed Asian women through prostitution and now surrogacy. He declares that their babies have flown away but each one will bring enough money to feed an entire poor village, as the video shows Bootie handing a bundle of cash in exchange for a white baby. Robin rushes to the airport, while the couples become hysterical, begging Adrian to call the airport and detain the women who are kidnapping their children. Adrian, stunned, tells them there is nothing that can be done legally, as the women can do whatever they want, even while pregnant with another mother's child. Robin arrives at the airport and finds an empty gate, with just the stuffed panda. Mary, however, is safe with her parents. Robin arrives at the Edwards' home, where Julia says she and Pyke are going to give it another try as a couple. Before she leaves, Robin asks if she can borrow the DVD Pyke told her about, showing Mary growing up. Julia protests and says it is their only copy, so Pyke says he will come pick it up as soon as Robin has finished watching it, which Robin says she will do that evening. Julia looks concerned, but says nothing. Later that night, Robin watches the video, crying happy tears, then looks up as she hears a knock on her door \u2013 presumably from Pyke.\n| LineColor       = 764E4E\n\nEpisodeNumber     = 13\nEpisodeNumber2    = 7\nNo Title\nShortSummary from Netflix site app!\nThe terrifying news sends Robin and Miranda on a desperate search through the crowd at Bondi beach.

Robin tells Jamies mom and her coworkers that she wants to help their kids and they tell her not to take on Matt. Johnno warns Robin against bringing a case against Matt, as Matt's drug business provides much of the town with a livelihood. Robin tries to have Matt and his fellow hunters DNA tested and Matt refuses for all of them saying he's going to find his daughter. Tui and Jamie go to Paradise to ask GJ how Tui can give birth then flee at her brothers unexpected arrival.

Four years after the events with Tui, Robin tries to adjust back to life in Sydney while dealing with residual [[PTSD]] from shooting Al Parker. Parker turned witness in the case of the paedophile ring in exchange for immunity, but has now filed a civil suit against Robin, claiming the shooting was personally motivated. Robin's daughter, Mary, is now nearly 18 and exhibiting signs of mental instability that her adoptive parents worry is more than teen angst. Unbeknownst to her parents, Mary is dating a 42-year-old German, Alexander, nicknamed \"Puss\", who lives above a brothel, Silk 41. Mary is enamoured with Puss, who claims to be \"empowering\" the young Asian prostitutes by teaching them English and other life lessons. Mary is aggressively rebelling and openly hostile against her adoptive parents, Pyke and Julia, who are getting a divorce after Julia came out as a lesbian. Pyke and Julia are appalled after meeting Puss, who informs them he plans to marry Mary. Robin's new boss, Detective Sergeant Adrian Butler, brings a large stuffed panda to a young Asian woman. Brett, a socially awkward university student who frequents brothels, worries because he can't find a prostitute named Cinnamon, whom he believes is his girlfriend. Meanwhile, the suitcase washes up on [[Bondi Beach]] and it contains the decomposing body of a woman. Robin and a rookie constable, the awkward Miranda, are assigned to the case.\n| LineColor       = 764E4E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 8\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = The Loved One\n| DirectedBy      = [[Ariel Kleiman]]\n| WrittenBy       = Jane Campion & Gerard Lee\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|08|03|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 2.38\n| ShortSummary    = A flashback reveals that four weeks earlier, Johnno was arrested on their wedding day after his pot farm was raided, and Robin left him after discovering he had cheated on her as well. Meanwhile, Tui is now raising her son at the women's commune. In the present, Robin, who had three miscarriages while with Johnno, has nightmares about babies. Robin is obsessed with the case of the Asian Jane Doe found in the suitcase, dubbed \"China Girl,\" whose cause of death was possibly strangulation. With no matching reports from missing persons, they suspect she was working as a prostitute, possibly entering the country with a false passport. Robin and Miranda observe the autopsy, where the coroner learns that China Girl was about 17 weeks pregnant. An emotional Miranda leaves the autopsy when she sees the tiny foetus, and she later reveals she is 18 weeks pregnant. Robin is irritated by Miranda, but Adrian insists they work together, because nobody else will work with either of them. They visit brothels, which are [[Prostitution in Australia#New South Wales|legal in Sydney]]. Robin notices a large stuffed panda at one, Silk 41, and asks Adrian what happened to the one he had in his office. He claims he gave it to his son. Brett goes to Silk 41 to find Cinnamon, and is eventually told she went to [[Canberra]]. He refuses to believe she would without telling him. Robin finally works up the courage to contact Mary, leaving a letter at the Edwards' home. She first meets with Pyke and Julia at his office, and Julia angrily informs her that Mary's behavioural problems began four years earlier, after she never received a reply to the letter she sent Robin. She chastises her for not having the decency to respond, and that Mary agonised over whether she had said something wrong in the letter. Julia storms off, but Pyke is more patient and listen as Robin explains she was just 16 years old when Mary was born. Robin is able to meet Mary, who behaves oddly and exhibits very low self-esteem. Mary reveals she assumed that she was the product of rape, which Robin confirms. Mary volunteers to murder her mother's rapist, and Robin confesses that she never knew who the father was, being a victim of a gang rape. A DNA test on the male foetus reveals China Girl was not his biological mother, mystifying the pathologist. Robin, though, realises the dead girl was acting as a surrogate mother, changing the course of the investigation.\n| LineColor       = 764E4E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 9\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Surrogate\n| DirectedBy      = Ariel Kleiman\n| WrittenBy       = Jane Campion & Gerard Lee\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|08|10|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 1.97\n| ShortSummary    = Robin believes that China Girl was acting as an illegal surrogate, as the law states surrogates must be over 25 and have already had a child of their own, and thus the biological parents were working outside the normal system. She and Miranda visit a fertility clinic, where a doctor tells Robin that although many parents may be desperate enough to try illegal surrogacy, that would bring great risk as the law would side with the surrogate mother, who could decide to keep the child. Robin comes out to see Miranda arguing with the receptionist. Robin gets a lead after potentially finding the biological parents for whom China Girl was a surrogate, after a mentally unstable woman is wandering in traffic, crying about her missing baby. Robin visits the woman, Felicity, and her husband, Mike, in the psychiatric ward. Mike, who has a criminal record for cocaine possession, eventually agrees to take a DNA test. Robin is irritated by Miranda, who smokes and drinks despite her pregnancy, and who is now sleeping with Robin's brother on top of having an affair with the married Adrian. Another detective, Stally, continues to make unwanted advances on Robin. After some investigating, Pyke and Julia confront Puss with the fact that he is already married, causing him to have a bizarre outburst in a restaurant and a further rift between them and Mary. Puss locks himself in his apartment and refuses to see Mary or any of the prostitutes in to see him. After being called by Pyke, Robin takes Mary to her apartment, where Mary breaks down because of Puss refusing to see her.

Pyke and Mary attend her school's Daddy/Daughter dance, which he has been looking forward to. Mary at first stops to check on Puss, who talks his way into attending, claiming he is her \"Daddy.\" At the dance, he interrupts Pyke and Mary's waltz and causes outrage when he begins dancing sexually with Mary, and is thrown out. Brett, who has seen the news about the Asian Jane Doe, contacts the police and gives them a photo of Cinnamon. Upset that the police consider him a suspect, Brett tells them about the creepy guy at the brothel. As he describes him, Robin fears he is talking about Mary's boyfriend. Mary takes some of the prostitutes (whom she claims are students) to the beach with her, Pyke and Robin, to teach them how to swim. Puss comes along and, after noticing Robin's air of hostility towards him, he brings up her rape, makes sexually suggestive remarks and then violently attacks her, biting her on the nose. Mary, screaming and hitting herself in the head, convinces Robin not to press charges. The DNA test reveals that Felicity and Mike are not the biological parents, but Robin is shocked to find out they have three young Asian women as surrogate mothers. Mary asks Dang to start working there, and Dang refuses. On Mary's 18th birthday, Puss takes Mary to a hookers' strip. She says she is afraid and he hits her in the face. He tells her that is worse than what any John will do to her, and now she doesn't have to be afraid, and then leaves her there. Unable to complete the act, she is thrown out of a car by a John, and phones Robin for help. In Robin's car, Mary sees the photo of Cinnamon, whom she recognises.  Robin hints that Mary is in great danger.

Robin tells Pyke about picking Mary up from under the overpass. Pyke wants to kill Puss, and Robin says that even if she arrests him, she knows he won't be held long. Brett becomes further unhinged after identifying Cinnamon's body and begins suffering from hallucinations. Miranda has another crying spell at work and admits she fears her baby has died. They return to the same fertility clinic where Miranda shows the receptionist the photo of Cinnamon, and demands to know if she recognises her. Miranda informs her that the girl in the photo was not a student, but a sex worker, and then starts screaming that she wants an ultrasound. Robin takes her out to the beach to calm down, where Miranda reveals she is not actually pregnant and that her pregnancy is being done via surrogacy because of her own fertility issues. Miranda says their surrogate is pregnant with a daughter but has gone missing, and she fears it is because of a miscarriage. Miranda still insists that their surrogate was a student, but Robin asks if Adrian gave her a stuffed panda, because she saw one at Silk 41. A doctor at the fertility clinic, unaware that the girls were sex workers, connects Robin with a couple who identify Cinnamon as their surrogate mother, whose real name was Pathma. With the assistance of Mary's schoolfriend Michaela, Puss directs some sort of \"art film\" with the prostitutes and Caucasian babies, set in a Thai village. Mary becomes worried when Caramel, another pregnant girl from Silk 41, is taken away by Puss and Dang. Connected by concern over Mary and Puss, Robin and Pyke grow closer, much to Julia's annoyance and jealousy. Brett, armed with a rifle, shows up at the brothel and demands to see Puss. Puss pushes Mary in front of him and escapes in the elevator as Brett fires the gun.\n| LineColor       = 764E4E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 12\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n| Title           = The Battle of the Mothers\n\n\n| DirectedBy      = Ariel Kleiman\n| WrittenBy       = Jane Campion & Gerard Lee\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|08|31|df=y}}<ref name=\"airdate\">{{cite web|title=Next on (2)|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p057mh5s/broadcasts/upcoming|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref>\n| Viewers         = 1.84\n| ShortSummary    =Robin and Pyke make love when she receives a late-night call from Mary.

Miranda calls and tells her there was a shooting at Silk 41, and that the suspect is Brett Iles, who took Mary hostage. The taxi is found at Bondi Beach, with the taxi driver shot dead. Security footage from the brothel shows Puss escaping as Brett shot Bootie, before leaving with Mary. The security footage also shows another room, in which Miranda spots her surrogate. That room is not at the brothel, and none of the sex workers know its location. The next day, Pyke and Julia go to Mary's school to appeal to her classmates for any information. Michaela tells them about a place on [[Liverpool Street, Sydney|Liverpool Street]] called Stasi Cafe, where Mary first met Puss. The manhunt for Brett intensifies, but Robin is convinced he's still on Bondi Beach, now packed with people. She notices an empty case of beer that was there the previous night. She and Miranda move in and try to quietly move beachgoers away from the box. One group refuses to move and distracts Robin while Miranda discovers a shoe sticking out from the sand. She kicks the box away to find Brett's face peeking out, his eyes closed. Miranda moves in to check his pulse. Robin yells at Miranda to draw her weapon but she freezes. Brett suddenly pulls the rifle out of the sand and shoots Miranda in the abdomen. Robin jumps on him, her gun to his head, demanding to know where Mary is. Meanwhile, Mary shows up at home, unharmed. Crying, Julia begs her to stay, promising that she will change and try to understand her, but Mary leaves. Robin visits the hospital, where Miranda is in a coma, her outlook grim. Adrian vows to tell everyone he loves her, and begs Robin to find their surrogate. Robin finds Pyke at Stasi Cafe, where they kiss and embrace. He leaves after getting a text from Julia informing him that Mary's passport is missing. Robin then finds Puss in the kitchen, where she cuts him with a kitchen knife. He claims that Cinnamon hanged herself. Robin puts her gun to his head and he discloses the address of the missing surrogates, giving her the key. She shows up to find not only Adrian but the other expectant couples, including Felicia and Mike, all of whom received calls from their surrogates. They find the apartment empty, with a DVD left behind. Meanwhile, Mary escorts the dozen or so surrogates through the airport. Puss shows up as they board the plane, and Mary, upset, tells him that she could have been shot while he fled. He lies and tells her the elevator doors closed and he couldn't do anything. She asks what will happen to the babies and who will love them, and he tells them the \"people who made them\" will buy them back. She pulls away and he slaps her. She hits him back, over and over. Caramel calls for Mary, but she refuses to board and watches him leave. At the apartment, Adrian plays the DVD, which shows the video shot at the brothel of the Thai women with the babies. Puss narrates, mocking the parents, and accusing the West of exploiting the bodies of oppressed Asian women through prostitution and now surrogacy. He declares that their babies have flown away but each one will bring enough money to feed an entire poor village, as the video shows Bootie handing a bundle of cash in exchange for a white baby. Robin rushes to the airport, while the couples become hysterical, begging Adrian to call the airport and detain the women who are kidnapping their children. Adrian, stunned, tells them there is nothing that can be done legally, as the women can do whatever they want, even while pregnant with another mother's child. Robin arrives at the airport and finds an empty gate, with just the stuffed panda. Mary, however, is safe with her parents. Robin arrives at the Edwards' home, where Julia says she and Pyke are going to give it another try as a couple. Before she leaves, Robin asks if she can borrow the DVD Pyke told her about, showing Mary growing up. Julia protests and says it is their only copy, so Pyke says he will come pick it up as soon as Robin has finished watching it, which Robin says she will do that evening. Julia looks concerned, but says nothing. Later that night, Robin watches the video, crying happy tears, then looks up as she hears a knock on her door \u2013 presumably from Pyke.\n| LineColor       = 764E4E\n\nEpisodeNumber     = 13\nEpisodeNumber2    = 7\nNo Title\nShortSummary from Netflix site app!\nThe terrifying news sends Robin and Miranda on a desperate search through the crowd at Bondi beach.
