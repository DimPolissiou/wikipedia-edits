{"title_page": "Dioceses of the Church of the East to 1318", "text_new": "{{Eastern Christianity}}\n[[Image:DebateBetweenCatholicsAndOrientalChristiansInThe13thCenturyAcre1290.jpg|thumb|260px|Syrian, Armenian and Latin bishops debate Christian doctrine in the Crusader city of Acre, late 13th century]]\nAt the height of its power, in the 10th century AD, the '''[[dioceses]] of the [[Church of the East]]''' numbered well over a hundred and stretched from [[Egypt]] to [[China]]. These dioceses were organised into six interior provinces in [[Mesopotamia]], in the Church's [[Iraq]]i heartland, and a dozen or more second-rank exterior provinces. Most of the exterior provinces were located in [[Iran]], [[Central Asia]], [[India]] and China, testifying to the Church's remarkable eastern expansion in the Middle Ages. A number of [[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] dioceses were also established in the towns of the eastern Mediterranean, in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Syria]], [[Cilicia]] and [[Egypt]].\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Maps of the Armenian Empire of Tigranes.gif|thumb|300px|The western provinces of the Parthian empire]]\nThere are few sources for the ecclesiastical organisation of the Church of the East before the [[Sassanian]] (Persian) period, and the information provided in martyr acts and local histories such as the ''Chronicle of Erbil'' may not always be genuine.  The ''Chronicle of Erbil'', for example, provides a list of East Syriac dioceses supposedly in existence by 225.  References to bishops in other sources confirm the existence of many of these dioceses, but it is impossible to be sure that all of them had been founded at this early period.  Diocesan history was a subject particularly susceptible to later alteration, as bishops sought to gain prestige by exaggerating the antiquity of their dioceses, and such evidence for an early diocesan structure in the Church of the East must be treated with great caution.  Firmer ground is only reached with the 4th-century narratives of the martyrdoms of bishops during the persecution of [[Shapur II]], which name several bishops and dioceses in Mesopotamia and elsewhere.\n\nThe ecclesiastical organisation of the Church of the East in the Sassanian period, at least in the interior provinces and from the 5th century onwards, is known in some detail from the records of [[synod]]s convened by the patriarchs [[Isaac (patriarch)|Isaac]] in 410, [[Yahballaha I]] in 420, Dadisho\u02bf in 424, [[Acacius (Nestorian Patriarch)|Acacius]] in 486, [[Babai (Nestorian patriarch)|Baba\u00ef]] in 497, [[Aba I]] in 540 and 544, [[Joseph (Nestorian Patriarch)|Joseph]] in 554, Ezekiel in 576, [[Ishoyahb I|Isho\u02bfyahb I]] in 585 and [[Gregory (Nestorian Patriarch)|Gregory]] in 605.<ref>Chabot, 274\u20135, 283\u20134, 285, 306\u20137 and 318\u201351</ref>  These documents record the names of the bishops who were either present at these gatherings, or who adhered to their acts by proxy or later signature.  These synods also dealt with diocesan discipline, and throw interesting light on the problems which the leaders of the church faced in trying to maintain high standards of conduct among their widely dispersed episcopate.\n\nAfter the [[Expansion of Islam|Arab conquest in the 7th century]], the sources for the ecclesiastical organisation of the Church of the East are of a slightly different nature from the synodical acts and historical narratives of the Sassanian period.  As far as its patriarchs are concerned, reign-dates and other dry but interesting details have often been meticulously preserved, giving the historian a far better chronological framework for the [[Ummayad]] and \u02bf[[Abbasid]] periods than for the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] and post-Mongol periods.  The 11th-century ''Chronography'' of [[Elijah of Nisibis]], edited in 1910 by E. W. Brooks and translated into Latin (''Eliae Metropolitae Nisibeni Opus Chronologicum''), recorded the date of consecration, length of reign and date of death of all the patriarchs from [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] (780\u2013823) to [[Yohannan V]] (1001\u201311), and also supplied important information on some of Timothy's predecessors.\n\nValuable additional information on the careers of the East Syriac patriarchs is supplied in histories of the Church of the East since its foundation written by the 12th-century East Syriac author [[Mari ibn Sulaiman]] and the 14th-century authors [[\u02bfAmr ibn Mattai]] and [[Sliba ibn Yuhanna]].  Mari's history, written in the second half of the 12th century, ends with the reign of the patriarch [[Abdisho III|\u02bfAbdisho\u02bf III]] (1139\u201348).  The 14th-century writer \u02bfAmr ibn Mattai, bishop of Tirhan, abridged Mari's history but also provided a number of new details and brought it up to the reign of the patriarch [[Yahballaha III]] (1281\u20131317).  Sliba, in turn, continued \u02bfAmr's text into the reign of the patriarch Timothy II (1318 \u2013 c. 1332).  Unfortunately, no English translation has yet been made of these important sources.  They remain available only in their original Arabic and in a Latin translation (''Maris, Amri, et Salibae: De Patriarchis Nestorianorum Commentaria'') made between 1896 and 1899 by Enrico Gismondi.\n\nThere are also a number of valuable references to the Church of the East and its bishops in the ''Chronicon Ecclesiasticum'' of the 13th-century West Syriac writer [[Bar Hebraeus]].  Although principally a history of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], the ''Chronicon Ecclesiasticum'' frequently mentions developments in the East Syriac church that affected the West Syriacs.  Like its East Syriac counterparts, the ''Chronicon Ecclesiasticum'' has not yet been translated into English, and remains available only in its Syriac original and in a Latin translation (''Bar Hebraeus Chronicon Ecclesiasticum'') made in 1877 by its editors, [[Jean Baptiste Abbeloos]] and [[Thomas Joseph Lamy]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nRather less is known about the diocesan organisation of the Church of the East under the caliphate than during the Sassanian period.   Although the acts of several synods held between the 7th and 13th centuries were recorded (the 14th-century author \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf of [[Nisibis]] mentions the acts of the synods of Isho\u02bf Bar Nun and [[Eliya I]], for example), most have not survived.  The synod of the patriarch Gregory in 605 was the last ecumenical synod of the Church of the East whose acts have survived in full, though the records of local synods convened at Dairin in Beth Qatraye by the patriarch Giwargis in 676 and in [[Adiabene]] in 790 by [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] have also survived by chance.<ref>Chabot, 318\u201351, 482 and 608</ref>  The main sources for the episcopal organisation of the Church of the East during the [[Ummayad]] and \u02bfAbbasid periods are the histories of Mari, \u02bfAmr and Sliba, which frequently record the names and dioceses of the metropolitans and bishops present at the consecration of a patriarch or appointed by him during his reign.  These records tend to be patchy before the 11th century, and the chance survival of a list of bishops present at the consecration of the patriarch [[Yohannan IV]] in 900 helps to fill one of the many gaps in our knowledge.<ref name=\"MS Paris BN Syr 354, folio 147\">MS Paris BN Syr 354, folio 147</ref>  The records of attendance at patriarchal consecrations must be used with caution, however, as they can give a misleading impression.  They inevitably gave prominence to the bishops of Mesopotamia and overlooked those of the more remote dioceses who were unable to be present.   These bishops were often recorded in the acts of the Sassanian synods, because they adhered to their acts by letter.\n\nTwo lists in Arabic of East Syriac metropolitan provinces and their constituent dioceses during the \u02bfAbbasid period have survived.  The first, reproduced in Assemani's ''Bibliotheca Orientalis'', was made in 893 by the historian [[Eliya of Damascus]].<ref name=\"Assemani, BO, ii. 485\u20139\">Assemani, ''BO'', ii. 485\u20139</ref>  The second, a summary ecclesiastical history of the Church of the East known as the ''Mukhtasar al-akhbar al-bi\u02bfiya'', was compiled in 1007/8.  This history, published by B. Haddad (Baghdad, 2000), survives in an Arabic manuscript in the possession of the Chaldean Church, and the French ecclesiastical historian [[J. M. Fiey]] made selective use of it in ''Pour un Oriens Christianus Novus'' (Beirut, 1993), a study of the dioceses of the West and East Syriac churches.\n\nA number of local histories of monasteries in northern Mesopotamia were also written at this period (in particular Thomas of Marga\u2019s ''Book of Governors'', the ''History of Rabban Bar \u02bfIdta'', the ''History of Rabban Hormizd the Persian'', the ''History of Mar Sabrisho\u02bf of Beth Qoqa'' and the ''Life of Rabban Joseph Busnaya'') and these histories, together with a number of hagiographical accounts of the lives of notable holy men, occasionally mention bishops of the northern Mesopotamian dioceses.\n\n[[Thomas of Marga]] is a particularly important source for the second half of the 8th century and the first half of the 9th century, a period for which little synodical information has survived and also few references to the attendance of bishops at patriarchal consecrations.  As a monk of the important monastery of Beth \u02bfAbe, and later the secretary of the patriarch [[Abraham II (Nestorian patriarch)|Abraham II]] (832\u201350), he had access to a wide range of written sources, including the correspondence of the patriarch Timothy I, and could also draw on the traditions of his old monastery and the long memories of its monks.  Thirty or forty otherwise unattested bishops of this period are mentioned in the ''Book of Governors'', and it is the prime source for the existence of the northern Mesopotamian diocese of Salakh.  A particularly important passage mentions the prophecy of the monastery\u2019s superior [[Quriaqos]], who flourished around the middle of the 8th century, that forty-two of the monks under his care would later become bishops, metropolitans, or even patriarchs.   Thomas was able to name, and supply interesting information about, thirty-one of these bishops.<ref>Wallis Budge, ''Book of Governors'', ii. 444\u20139</ref>\n\nNevertheless, references to bishops beyond Mesopotamia are infrequent and capricious.  Furthermore, many of the relevant sources are in Arabic rather than Syriac, and often use a different Arabic name for a diocese previously attested only in the familiar Syriac form of the synodical acts and other early sources.  Most of the Mesopotamian dioceses can be readily identified in their new Arabic guise, but on occasion the use of Arabic presents difficulties of identification.\n\n==Parthian period==\nBy the middle of the 4th century, when many of its bishops were martyred during the persecution of [[Shapur II]], the Church of the East probably had twenty or more dioceses within the borders of the Sassanian empire, in [[Beth Aramaye]] ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0710\u072a\u0721\u071d\u0710}}), Beth Huzaye ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0717\u0718\u0719\u071d\u0710}}), Maishan ({{lang|syr|\u0721\u071d\u072b\u0722}}), Adiabene (Hdyab, {{lang|syr|\u071a\u0715\u071d\u0710\u0712}}) and Beth Garma\u00ef ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c\u0713\u072a\u0721\u071d}}), and possibly also in Khorasan.  Some of these dioceses may have been at least a century old, and it is possible that many of them were founded before the Sassanian period.  According to the ''Chronicle of Erbil'' there were several dioceses in Adiabene and elsewhere in the Parthian empire as early as the end of the 1st century, and more than twenty dioceses in 225 in Mesopotamia and northern Arabia, including the following seventeen named dioceses: [[Beth Zabdai|B\u0113\u1e6f Za\u1e07dai]] ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0719\u0712\u0715\u071d}}), [[Kirkuk|Karkh\u0101 d-B\u0113\u1e6f Sl\u014dkh]] ({{lang|syr|\u071f\u072a\u071f\u0710 \u0715\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0723\u0720\u0718\u071f}}), [[Kashkar|Ka\u0161kar]] ({{lang|syr|\u071f\u072b\u071f\u072a}}), [[Gundeshapur|B\u0113\u1e6f Lapa\u1e6d]] ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0720\u0726\u071b}}), [[Ahvaz|Horm\u012bzd Arda\u0161\u012br]] ({{lang|syr|\u0717\u0718\u072a\u0721\u071d\u0719\u0715 \u0710\u072a\u0715\u072b\u071d\u072a}}), [[Basra|Pr\u0101\u1e6f d-Mai\u0161\u0101n]] ({{lang|syr|\u0726\u072a\u072c \u0715\u0721\u071d\u072b\u0722}}), \u1e24n\u012b\u1e6f\u0101 ({{lang|syr|\u071a\u0722\u071d\u072c\u0710}}), \u1e24r\u1e07a\u1e6f Gl\u0101l ({{lang|syr|\u071a\u072a\u0712\u072c \u0713\u0720\u0720}}), Arzun ({{lang|syr|\u0710\u072a\u0719\u0718\u0722}}), Beth Niqator (apparently a district in Beth Garma\u00ef), Shahrgard, Beth Meskene (possibly Piroz Shabur, later an East Syriac diocese), Hulwan ({{lang|syr|\u071a\u0718\u0720\u0718\u0710\u0722}}), Beth Qatraye ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0729\u071b\u072a\u071d\u0710}}), Hazza (probably the village of that name near Erbil, though the reading is disputed), Dailam and Shigar (Sinjar).   The cities of Nisibis ({{lang|syr|\u0722\u0728\u071d\u0712\u071d\u0722}}) and Seleucia-Ctesiphon, it was said, did not have bishops at this period because of the hostility of the pagans towards an overt Christian presence in the towns.  The list is plausible, though it is perhaps surprising to find dioceses for Hulwan, Beth Qatraye, Dailam and Shigar so early, and it is not clear whether Beth Niqator was ever an East Syriac diocese.\n\n==Sassanid period==\n[[File:Dioceses of the Church of the East.svg|thumb|400px|Metropolitan provinces of the Church of the East.<br>\n{{legend|#800000|Mesopotamia}}\n{{legend|#008000|Persia}}\n{{legend|#000080|Later expansions.}}\n{{legend|#cd87de|Area of missionary activities}}\n]]\nDuring the 4th century the dioceses of the Church of the East began to group themselves into regional clusters, looking for leadership to the bishop of the chief city of the region.  This process was formalised at the [[synod of Isaac]] in 410, which first asserted the priority of the 'grand metropolitan' of [[Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] and then grouped most of the Mesopotamian dioceses into five geographically-based provinces (by order of precedence, [[Beth Huzaye (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Beth Huzaye]], [[Nisibis (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Nisibis]], [[Maishan (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Maishan]], [[Adiabene (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Adiabene]] and [[Beth Garma\u00ef (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Beth Garma\u00ef]]), each headed by a metropolitan bishop with jurisdiction over several suffragan bishops.  Canon XXI of the synod foreshadowed the extension of this metropolitan principle to a number of more remote dioceses in Fars, Media, Tabaristan, Khorasan and elsewhere.<ref name=\"Chabot, 273\">Chabot, 273</ref>  In the second half of the 6th century the bishops of Rev Ardashir and Merv (and possibly Herat) also became metropolitans.  The new status of the bishops of [[Fars (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Rev Ardashir]] and [[Merv (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Merv]] was recognised at the synod of Joseph in 554, and henceforth they took sixth and seventh place in precedence respectively after the metropolitan of Beth Garma\u00ef.  The bishop of [[Hulwan (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Hulwan]] became a metropolitan during the reign of Isho\u02bfyahb II (628\u201345).  The system established at this synod survived unchanged in its essentials for nearly a millennium.  Although during this period the number of metropolitan provinces increased as the church\u2019s horizons expanded, and although some suffragan dioceses within the original six metropolitan provinces died out and others took their place, all the metropolitan provinces created or recognised in 410 were still in existence in 1318.\n\n===Interior provinces===\n\n==== Province of the Patriarch ====\n{{main|Patriarchal Province of Seleucia-Ctesiphon}}\nThe patriarch himself sat at [[Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] or, more precisely, the Sassanian foundation of [[Veh-Ardashir]] on the west bank of the [[Tigris]], built in the 3rd century adjacent to the old city of [[Seleucia on the Tigris|Seleucia]], which was thereafter abandoned. The city of [[Ctesiphon]], founded by the Parthians, was nearby on the east bank of the Tigris, and the double city was always known by its early name Seleucia-Ctesiphon to the East Syriacs.  It was not normal for the head of an eastern church to administer an ecclesiastical province in addition to his many other duties, but circumstances made it necessary for Yahballaha I to assume responsibility for a number of dioceses in Beth Aramaye.\n\nThe dioceses of Kashkar, Zabe, Hirta ([[Al-Hirah|al-Hira]]), Beth Daraye and Dasqarta d'Malka (the Sassanian winter capital [[Dastagird]]), doubtless because of their antiquity or their proximity to the capital Seleucia-Ctesiphon, were reluctant to be placed under the jurisdiction of a metropolitan, and it was felt necessary to treat them tactfully.  A special relationship between the diocese of Kashkar, believed to have been an apostolic foundation, and the diocese of Seleucia-Ctesiphon was defined in Canon XXI of the synod of 410:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe first and chief seat is that of Seleucia and Ctesiphon; the bishop who occupies it is the grand metropolitan and chief of all the bishops.  The bishop of Kashkar is placed under the jurisdiction of this metropolitan; he is his right arm and minister, and he governs the diocese after his death.<ref>Chabot, 272</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAlthough the bishops of Beth Aramaye were admonished in the acts of these synods, they persisted in their intransigence, and in 420 Yahballaha I placed them under his direct supervision.  This ''ad hoc'' arrangement was later formalised by the creation of a 'province of the patriarch'.  As foreshadowed in the synod of Isaac in 410, Kashkar was the highest ranking diocese in this province, and the bishop of Kaskar became the 'guardian of the throne' (''natar kursya'') during the interregnum between one patriarch's death and the election of his successor.  The diocese of Dasqarta d'Malka is not mentioned again after 424, but bishops of the other dioceses were present at most of the 5th- and 6th-century synods.  Three more dioceses in Beth Aramaye are mentioned in the acts of the later synods:  Piroz Shabur (first mentioned in 486); Tirhan (first mentioned in 544); and Shenna d'Beth Ramman or Qardaliabad (first mentioned in 576).  All three dioceses were to have a long history.\n\n====Province of Beth Huzaye (Elam)====\n{{main|Beth Huzaye (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nThe metropolitan of Beth Huzaye (\u02bfIlam or Elam), who resided in the town of Beth Lapat (Veh az Andiokh Shapur), enjoyed the right of consecrating a new patriarch.   In 410 it was not possible to appoint a metropolitan for Beth Huzaye, as several bishops of Beth Lapat were competing for precedence and the synod declined to choose between them.<ref name=\"Chabot, 272\u20133\">Chabot, 272\u20133</ref>  Instead, it merely laid down that once it became possible to appoint a metropolitan, he would have jurisdiction over the dioceses of Karka d'Ledan, Hormizd Ardashir, Shushter (Shushtra, {{lang|syr|\u072b\u0718\u072b\u071b\u072a\u0710}}) and Susa (Shush, {{lang|syr|\u072b\u0718\u072b}}).  These dioceses were all founded at least a century earlier, and their bishops were present at most of the synods of the 5th and 6th centuries.  A bishop of Ispahan was present at the synod of Dadisho\u02bf in 424, and by 576 there were also dioceses for [[Mihraganqadaq]] (probably the 'Beth Mihraqaye' included in the title of the diocese of Ispahan in 497) and Ram Hormizd (Ramiz).\n\n====Province of Nisibis====\n{{main|Nisibis (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nIn 363 the Roman emperor [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] was obliged to cede Nisibis and five neighbouring districts to Persia to extricate the defeated army of his predecessor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] from Persian territory.   The Nisibis region, after nearly fifty years of rule by [[Constantine I|Constantine]] and his Christian successors, may well have contained more Christians than the entire [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian empire]], and this Christian population was absorbed into the Church of the East in a single generation.  The impact of the cession of Nisibis on the demography of the Church of the East was so marked that the province of Nisibis was ranked second among the five metropolitan provinces established at the synod of Isaac in 410, a precedence apparently conceded without dispute by the bishops of the three older Persian provinces relegated to a lower rank.\n\nThe bishop of Nisibis was recognised in 410 as the metropolitan of Arzun ({{lang|syr|\u0710\u072a\u0719\u0718\u0722}}), Qardu ({{lang|syr|\u0729\u072a\u0715\u0718}}), Beth Zabda\u00ef ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0719\u0712\u0715\u071d}}), Beth Rahima\u00ef ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u072a\u071a\u0721\u071d}}) and Beth Moksaye ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0721\u0718\u071f\u0723\u071d\u0710}}).  These were the Syriac names for Arzanene, Corduene, Zabdicene, Rehimene and Moxoene, the five districts ceded by Rome to Persia in 363.<ref name=\"Chabot, 272\u20133\"/>  The metropolitan diocese of Nisibis ({{lang|syr|\u0722\u0728\u071d\u0712\u071d\u0722}}) and the suffragan dioceses of Arzun, Qardu and Beth Zabda\u00ef were to enjoy a long history, but Beth Rahima\u00ef is not mentioned again, while Beth Moksaye is not mentioned after 424, when its bishop Atticus (probably, from his name, a Roman) subscribed to the acts of the synod of Dadisho\u02bf.  Besides the bishop of Arzun, a bishop of 'Aoustan d\u2019Arzun' (plausibly identified with the district of Ingilene) also attended these two synods, and his diocese was also assigned to the province of Nisibis.  The diocese of Aoustan d'Arzun survived into the 6th century, but is not mentioned after 554.\n\nDuring the 5th and 6th centuries three new dioceses in the province of Nisibis were founded in Persian territory, in Beth \u02bfArabaye (the hinterland of Nisibis, between Mosul and the Tigris and Khabur rivers) and in the hill country to the northeast of Arzun.  By 497 a diocese had been established at Balad (the modern Eski Mosul) on the Tigris, which persisted into the 14th century.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 57\u20138</ref>  By 563 there was also a diocese for Shigar (Sinjar), deep inside Beth \u02bfArabaye, and by 585 a diocese for Kartwaye, the country to the west of Lake Van inhabited by the Kartaw Kurds.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 134</ref>\n\nThe famous [[School of Nisibis]] was an important seminary and theological academy of the Church of the East during the late Sassanian period, and in the last two centuries of Sassanian rule generated a remarkable outpouring of East Syriac theological scholarship.\n\n====Province of Maishan====\n{{main|Maishan (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nIn southern Mesopotamia, the bishop of Prath d'Maishan ({{lang|syr|\u0726\u072a\u072c \u0715\u0721\u071d\u072b\u0722}}) became metropolitan of [[Maishan (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Maishan]] ({{lang|syr|\u0721\u071d\u072b\u0722}}) in 410, responsible also for the three suffragan dioceses of Karka d'Maishan ({{lang|syr|\u071f\u072a\u071f\u0710 \u0715\u0721\u071d\u072b\u0722}}), Rima ({{lang|syr|\u072a\u071d\u0721\u0710}}) and Nahargur ({{lang|syr|\u0722\u0717\u072a\u0713\u0718\u072a}}).  The bishops of these four dioceses attended most of the synods of the 5th and 6th centuries.<ref>Chabot, 272\u20133; Fiey, ''POCN'', 59\u201360, 100, 114 and 125\u20136</ref>\n\n====Province of Adiabene====\n{{main|Adiabene (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\n[[Image:Citadel (old city) of Hewl\u00ear (Erbil).jpg|thumb|right|230px| The [[citadel of Erbil]], chief town in the East Syriac metropolitan province of Adiabene]]\nThe bishop of Erbil became metropolitan of Adiabene in 410, responsible also for the six suffragan dioceses of Beth Nuhadra ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0722\u0718\u0717\u0715\u072a\u0710}}), Beth Bgash, Beth Dasen, Ramonin, Beth Mahqart and Dabarin.<ref name=\"Chabot, 272\u20133\"/>  Bishops of the dioceses of Beth Nuhadra, Beth Bgash and Beth Dasen, which covered the modern \u02bfAmadiya and Hakkari regions, were present at most of the early synods, and these three dioceses continued without interruption into the 13th century.  The other three dioceses are not mentioned again, and have been tentatively identified with three dioceses better known under other names:  Ramonin with Shenna d'Beth Ramman in Beth Aramaye, on the Tigris near its junction with the [[Great Zab]]; Beth Mahrqart with Beth Qardu in the Nisibis region, across the Tigris from the district of Beth Zabda\u00ef; and Dabarin with Tirhan, a district of Beth Aramaye which lay between the Tigris and the Jabal \u1e24amrin, to the southwest of Beth Garma\u00ef.\n\nBy the middle of the 6th century there were also dioceses in the province of Adiabene for Ma\u02bfaltha ({{lang|syr|\u0721\u0725\u0720\u072c\u0710}}) or Ma\u02bfalthaya ({{lang|syr|\u0721\u0725\u0720\u072c\u071d\u0710}}), a town in the Hnitha ({{lang|syr|\u071a\u0722\u071d\u072c\u0710}}) or Zibar district to the east of \u02bfAqra, and for Nineveh.  The diocese of Ma\u02bfaltha is first mentioned in 497, and the diocese of Nineveh in 554, and bishops of both dioceses attended most of the later synods.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 106 and 115\u201316</ref>\n\n====Province of Beth Garma\u00ef====\n{{main|Beth Garma\u00ef (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nThe bishop of Karka d'Beth Slokh ({{lang|syr|\u071f\u072a\u071f\u0710 \u0715\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0723\u0720\u0718\u071f}}, modern Kirkuk) became metropolitan of Beth Garma\u00ef, responsible also for the five suffragan dioceses of Shahrgard, Lashom ({{lang|syr|\u0720\u072b\u0718\u0721}}), Mahoze d'Arewan ({{lang|syr|\u0721\u071a\u0718\u0719\u0710 \u0715\u0710\u072a\u071d\u0718\u0722}}), Radani and Hrbath Glal ({{lang|syr|\u071a\u072a\u0712\u072c\u0713\u0720\u0720}}).  Bishops from these five dioceses are found at most of the synods in the 5th and 6th centuries.<ref name=\"Chabot, 272\u20133\"/>  Two other dioceses also existed in the Beth Garma\u00ef district in the 5th century which do not appear to have been under the jurisdiction of its metropolitan.  A diocese existed at Tahal as early as 420, which seems to have been an independent diocese until just before the end of the 6th century, and bishops of the Karme district on the west bank of the Tigris around Tagrit, in later centuries a West Syrian stronghold, were present at the synods  of 486 and 554.\n\n====Unlocalised dioceses====\nSeveral dioceses mentioned in the acts of the early synods cannot be convincingly localised.  A bishop Ardaq of 'Mashkena d'Qurdu' was present at the synod of Dadisho\u02bf in 424, a bishop Mushe of 'Hamir' at the synod of Acacius in 486, bishops of 'Barhis' at the synods of 544, 576 and 605, and a bishop of \u02bfA\u00efn Sipne at the synod of Ezekiel in 576.  Given the personal attendance of their bishops at these synods, these dioceses were probably in Mesopotamia rather than the exterior provinces.<ref>Chabot, 285, 344\u20135, 368 and 479</ref>\n\n===Exterior provinces===\nCanon XXI of the synod of 410 provided that 'the bishops of the more remote dioceses of Fars, the Islands, Beth Madaye [Media], Beth Raziqaye [Rai] and also the country of Abrashahr [Nishapur], must later accept the definition established in this council'.<ref name=\"Chabot, 273\"/>  This reference demonstrates that the influence of the Church of the East in the 5th century had extended beyond the non-Iranian fringes of the Sassanian empire to include several districts within Iran itself, and had also spread southwards to the islands off the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf, which were under Sassanian control at this period.  By the middle of the 6th century the Church's reach seems to have spread well beyond the frontiers of the Sassanian empire, as a passage in the acts of the synod of Aba I in 544 refers to East Syriac communities 'in every district and every town throughout the territory of the Persian empire, in the rest of the East, and in the neighbouring countries'.<ref>Chabot, 320\u20131</ref>\n\n====Fars and Arabia====\n{{main|Fars (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nThere were at least eight dioceses in Fars and the islands of the Persian Gulf in the 5th century, and probably eleven or more by the end of the Sassanian period.  In Fars the diocese of Rev Ardashir is first mentioned in 420, the dioceses of Ardashir Khurrah (Shiraf), Darabgard, Istakhr, and Kazrun (Shapur or Bih Shapur) in 424, and a diocese of Qish in 540.  On the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf dioceses are first mentioned for Dairin and Mashmahig in 410 and for Beth Mazunaye (Oman) in 424.  By 540 the bishop of Rev Ardashir had become a metropolitan, responsible for the dioceses of both Fars and Arabia.  A fourth Arabian diocese, Hagar, is first mentioned in 576, and a fifth diocese, Hatta (previously part of the diocese of Hagar), is first mentioned in the acts of a regional synod held on the Persian Gulf island of Dairin in 676 by the patriarch Giwargis to determine the episcopal succession in Beth Qatraye, but may have been created before the Arab conquest.\n\n====Khorasan and Segestan====\n{{main|Merv (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nAn East Syriac diocese for Abrashahr (Nishapur) evidently existed by the beginning of the 5th century, though it was not assigned to a metropolitan province in 410.<ref name=\"Chabot, 273\"/>  Three more East Syriac dioceses in Khorasan and Segestan are attested a few years later.  The bishops Bar Shaba of [[Merv]], David of Abrashahr, Yazdo\u00ef of Herat and Aphrid of Segestan were present at the synod of Dadisho\u02bf in 424.<ref>Chabot, 285</ref>  The uncommon name of the bishop of Merv, Bar Shaba, means 'son of the deportation', suggesting that [[Merv]]'s Christian community may have been deported from Roman territory.\n\nThe diocese of Segestan, whose bishop probably sat at Zarang, was disputed during the schism of Narsa\u00ef and Elisha\u02bf in the 520s.  The patriarch Aba I resolved the dispute in 544 by temporarily dividing the diocese, assigning Zarang, Farah and Qash to the bishop Yazdaphrid and Bist and Rukut to the bishop Sargis.  He ordered that the diocese should be reunited as soon as one of these bishops died.<ref>Chabot, 339-45</ref>\n\nThe Christian population of the Merv region seems to have increased during the 6th century, as the bishop of [[Merv]] was recognised as a metropolitan at the synod of Joseph in 554 and Herat also became a metropolitan diocese shortly afterwards.  The first known metropolitan of Herat was present at the synod of Isho\u02bfyahb I in 585.  The growing importance of the Merv region for the Church of the East is also attested by the appearance of several more Christian centres during the late 5th and 6th century.  By the end of the 5th century the diocese of Abrashahr (Nishapur) also included the city of Tus, whose name featured in 497 in the title of the bishop Yohannis of 'Tus and Abrashahr'.  Four more dioceses seem also to have been created in the 6th century.  The bishops Yohannan of 'Abiward and Shahr Peroz' and Theodore of Merw-i Rud accepted the acts of the synod of Joseph in 554, the latter by letter, while the bishops Habib of Pusang and Gabriel of 'Badisi and Qadistan' adhered by proxy to the decisions of the synod of Isho\u02bfyahb I in 585, sending deacons to represent them.<ref>Chabot, 366 and 423</ref>  None of these four dioceses is mentioned again, and it is not clear when they lapsed.\n\n====Media====\n{{main|Hulwan (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nBy the end of the 5th century there were at least three East Syriac dioceses in the Sassanian province of Media in western Iran.  Canon XXI of the synod of Isaac in 410 foreshadowed the extension of the metropolitan principle to the bishops of Beth Madaye and other relatively remote regions.<ref name=\"Chabot, 273\"/>  [[Hamadan]] (ancient Ecbatana) was the chief city of Media, and the Syriac name Beth Madaye (Media) was regularly used to refer to the East Syriac diocese of Hamadan as well as to the region as a whole.  Although no East Syriac bishops of Beth Madaye are attested before 457, this reference probably indicates that the diocese of Hamadan was already in existence in 410.  Bishops of Beth Madaye were present at most of the synods held between 486 and 605.<ref>Chabot, 306, 316, 366 and 479</ref>  Two other dioceses in western Iran, Beth Lashpar (Hulwan) and Masabadan, seem also to have been established in the 5th century.  A bishop of 'the deportation of Beth Lashpar' was present at the synod of Dadisho\u02bf in 424, and bishops of Beth Lashpar also attended the later synods of the 5th and 6th centuries.<ref>Chabot, 285, 287, 307, 315, 366, 368, 423 and 479</ref>  Bishops of the nearby locality of Masabadan were present at the synod of Joseph in 554 and the synod of Ezekiel in 576.<ref>Chabot, 366 and 368</ref>\n\n====Rai and Tabaristan====\n{{main|Rai (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nIn Tabaristan (northern Iran), the diocese of Rai (Beth Raziqaye) is first mentioned in 410, and seems to have had a fairly uninterrupted succession of bishops for the next six and a half centuries.  Bishops of Rai are first attested in 424 and last mentioned towards the end of the 11th century.<ref>Fiey, ''M\u00e9die chr\u00e9tienne'', 378\u201382; ''POCN'', 124</ref>\n\nAn East Syriac diocese was established in the Sassanian province of Gurgan (Hyrcania) to the southeast of the Caspian Sea in the 5th century for a community of Christians deported from Roman territory.<ref>Fiey, POCN, 85\u20136</ref>  The bishop Domitian 'of the deportation of Gurgan', evidently from his name a Roman, was present at the synod of Dadisho\u02bf in 424, and three other 5th- and 6th-century bishops of Gurgan attended the later synods, the last of whom, Za\u02bfura, was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Ezekiel in 576.<ref>Chabot, 285, 315, 328 and 368</ref>  The bishops of Gurgan probably sat in the provincial capital [[Astarabad]].<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 85\u20136</ref>\n\n====Adarbaigan and Gilan====\nBishops of the diocese of 'Adarbaigan' were present at most of the synods between 486 and 605.  The diocese of Adarbaigan appears to have covered the territory included within the Sassanian province of Atropatene.  It was bounded on the west by the Salmas and Urmi plains to the west of Lake Urmi and to the south by the diocese of Salakh in the province of Adiabene.  Its centre seems to have been the town of [[Ganzak]].  The diocese of Adarbaigan was not assigned to a metropolitan province in 410, and may have remained independent throughout the Sassanian period.  By the end of the 8th century, however, Adarbaigan was a suffragan diocese in the province of Adiabene.<ref>Fiey, POCN, 81\u20132</ref>\n\nAn East Syriac diocese for Paidangaran (modern [[Beylagan (city)|Baylaqan]]) is attested during the 6th century, but only two of its bishops are known.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 119</ref>  The bishop Yohannan of Paidangaran, first mentioned in 540, adhered to the acts of the synod of Mar Aba I in 544.<ref>Chabot, 328 and 344\u20135</ref>  The bishop Ya\u02bfqob of Paidangaran was present at the synod of Joseph in 544.<ref>Chabot, 366</ref>\n\nThe bishop Surin of 'Amol and Gilan' was present at the synod of Joseph in 554.<ref>Fiey, POCN, 82\u20133</ref>\n\n==Umayyad and Abbasid periods==\n[[Image:ES Exterior Provinces.jpg|thumb|300px|The mission field of the Church of the East, c. 800]]\nA good starting point for a discussion of the diocesan organisation of the Church of the East after the Arab conquest is a list of fifteen contemporary East Syriac 'eparchies' or ecclesiastical provinces compiled in 893 by the metropolitan Eliya of Damascus.   The list (in Arabic) included the province of the patriarch and fourteen metropolitan provinces:  Jundishabur (Beth Huzaye), Nisibin (Nisibis), al-Basra (Maishan), al-Mawsil ([[Mosul]]), Bajarmi (Beth Garma\u00ef), al-Sham (Damascus), al-Ray (Rai), Hara (Herat), Maru ([[Merv]]), Armenia, Qand (Samarqand), Fars, Barda\u02bfa and Hulwan.<ref name=\"Assemani, BO, ii. 485\u20139\"/>\n\nAn important source for the ecclesiastical organisation of the Church of the East in the 12th century is a collection of canons, attributed to the patriarch Eliya III (1176\u201390), for the consecration of bishops, metropolitans and patriarchs.   Included in the canons is what appears to be a contemporary list of twenty-five East Syriac dioceses, in the following order:  (a) Nisibis; (b) Mardin; (c) Amid and [[Maiperqat]]; (d) [[Singara]]; (e) [[Beth Zabda\u00ef]]; (f) Erbil; (g) Beth Waziq; (h) Athor [Mosul]; (i) Balad; (j) Marga; (k) Kfar Zamre; (l) Fars and Kirman; (m) Hindaye and Qatraye (India and northern Arabia); (n) [[Arzun]] and Beth Dlish ([[Bidlis]]); (o) [[Hamadan]]; (p) Halah; (q) [[Urmia|Urmi]]; (r) Halat, Van and Wastan; (s) Najran; (t) Kashkar; (u) Shenna d'Beth Ramman; (v) Nevaketh; (w) Soqotra; (x) Pushtadar; and (y) the Islands of the Sea.<ref>MS Cambridge Add. 1988</ref>\n\nThere are some obvious omissions from this list, notably a number of dioceses in the province of Mosul, but it is probably legitimate to conclude that all the dioceses mentioned in the list were still in existence in the last quarter of the 12th century.  If so, the list has some interesting surprises, such as the survival of dioceses for Fars and Kirman and for Najran at this late date.  The mention of the diocese of Kfar Zamre near Balad, attested only once before, in 790, is another surprise, as is the mention of a diocese for Pushtadar in Persia.  However, there is no need to doubt the authenticity of the list.  Its mention of dioceses for Nevaketh and the Islands of the Sea have a convincing topicality.\n\n===Interior provinces===\n\n====Province of the Patriarch====\n{{main|Province of the Patriarch}}\n[[File:Church of the East provinces 10 c.svg|thumb|500px|Ecclesiastical provinces of the Church of the East in the 10th century]]\nAccording to Eliya of Damascus, there were thirteen dioceses in the province of the patriarch in 893:  Kashkar, al-Tirhan, Dair Hazql (an alternative name for al-Nu\u02bfmaniya, the chief town in the diocese of Zabe), al-Hira (Hirta), al-Anbar (Piroz Shabur), al-Sin (Shenna d\u2019Beth Ramman), \u02bfUkbara, [[R\u0101dh\u0101n|al-Radhan]], Nifr, al-Qasra, 'Ba Daraya and Ba Kusaya' (Beth Daraye), \u02bfAbdasi (Nahargur), and al-Buwazikh (Konishabur or Beth Waziq).   Eight of these dioceses already existed in the Sassanian period, but the diocese of Beth Waziq is first mentioned in the second half of the 7th century, and the dioceses of \u02bfUkbara, al-Radhan, Nifr, and al-Qasra were probably founded in the 9th century.  The first bishop of \u02bfUkbara whose name has been recorded, Hakima, was consecrated by the patriarch Sargis around 870, and bishops of al-Qasra, al-Radhan and Nifr are first mentioned in the 10th century.  A bishop of 'al-Qasr and Nahrawan' became patriarch in 963, and then consecrated bishops for al-Radhan and for 'Nifr and al-Nil'.  Eliya's list helps to confirm the impression given by the literary sources, that the East Syriac communities in Beth Aramaye were at their most prosperous in the 10th century.\n\nA partial list of bishops present at the consecration of the patriarch Yohannan IV in 900 included several bishops from the province of the patriarch, including the bishops of Zabe and Beth Daraye and also the bishops Isho\u02bfzkha of 'the Gubeans', Hnanisho\u02bf of Delasar, Quriaqos of Meskene and Yohannan 'of the Jews'.  The last four dioceses are not mentioned elsewhere and cannot be satisfactorily localised.<ref name=\"MS Paris BN Syr 354, folio 147\"/>\n\nIn the 11th century decline began to set in.  The diocese of Hirta (al-Hira) came to an end, and four other dioceses were combined into two:  Nifr and al-Nil with Zabe (al-Zawabi and al-Nu\u02bfmaniya), and Beth Waziq (al-Buwazikh) with Shenna d'Beth Ramman (al-Sin).  Three more dioceses ceased to exist in the 12th century.  The dioceses of Piroz Shabur (al-Anbar) and Qasr and Nahrawan are last mentioned in 1111, and the senior diocese of [[Kashkar (East Syrian Diocese)|Kashkar]] in 1176.  By the patriarchal election of 1222 the guardianship of the vacant patriarchal throne, the traditional privilege of the bishop of Kashkar, had passed to the metropolitans of \u02bfIlam.  The trend of decline continued in the 13th century.  The diocese of Zabe and Nil is last mentioned during the reign of Yahballaha II (1190\u20131222), and the diocese of \u02bfUkbara in 1222.  Only three dioceses are known to have been still in existence at the end of the 13th century: Beth Waziq and Shenna, Beth Daron (Ba Daron), and (perhaps due to its sheltered position between the Tigris and the Jabal Hamrin) Tirhan.  However, East Syriac communities may also have persisted in districts which no longer had bishops: a manuscript of 1276 was copied by a monk named Giwargis at the monastery of Mar Yonan 'on the Euphrates, near Piroz Shabur which is Anbar', nearly a century and a half after the last mention of a bishop of Anbar.<ref>MS Harvard Syr 27</ref>\n\n====Province of Elam====\n{{main|Beth Huzaye (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nOf the seven suffragan dioceses attested in the province of Beth Huzaye in 576, only four were still in existence at the end of the 9th century.  The diocese of Ram Hormizd seems to have lapsed, and the dioceses of Karka d'Ledan and Mihrganqadaq had been combined with the dioceses of Susa and Ispahan respectively.  In 893 Eliya of Damascus listed four suffragan dioceses in the 'eparchy of Jundishapur', in the following order:    Karkh Ladan and al-Sus (Susa and Karha d'Ledan), al-Ahwaz (Hormizd Ardashir), Tesr (Shushter) and Mihrganqadaq (Ispahan and Mihraganqadaq).<ref name=\"Assemani, BO, ii. 485\u20139\"/>  It is doubtful whether any of these dioceses survived into the 14th century.  The diocese of Shushter is last mentioned in 1007/8, Hormizd Ardashir in 1012, Ispahan in 1111 and Susa in 1281.  Only the metropolitan diocese of Jundishapur certainly survived into the 14th century, and with additional prestige.  \u02bfIlam had for centuries ranked first among the metropolitan provinces of the Church of the East, and its metropolitan enjoyed the privilege of consecrating a new patriarch and sitting on his right hand at synods.  By 1222, in consequence of the demise of the diocese of Kashkar in the province of the patriarch, he had also acquired the privilege of guarding the vacant patriarchal throne.\n\nThe East Syriac author \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf of Nisibis, writing around the end of the 13th century, mentions the bishop Gabriel of Shahpur Khwast (modern Hurremabad), who perhaps flourished during the 10th century.  From its geographical location, Shahpur Khwast might have been a diocese in the province of \u02bfIlam, but it is not mentioned in any other source.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 131</ref>\n\n====Province of Nisibis====\n{{main|Nisibis (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nThe metropolitan province of Nisibis had a number of suffragan dioceses at different periods, including the dioceses of Arzun, Beth Rahima\u00ef, Beth Qardu (later renamed Tamanon), Beth Zabda\u00ef, Qube d\u2019Arzun, Balad, Shigar (Sinjar), Armenia, Harran and Callinicus (Raqqa), Maiperqat (with Amid and Mardin), Resh\u02bfa\u00efna, and Qarta and Adarma.\n\nProbably during the Ummayad period, the East Syriac diocese of Armenia was attached to the province of Nisibis.  The bishop Artashahr of Armenia was present at the synod of Dadisho\u02bf in 424, but the diocese was not assigned to a metropolitan province.  In the late 13th century Armenia was certainly a suffragan diocese of the province of Nisibis, and its dependency probably went back to the 7th or 8th century.  The bishops of Armenia appear to have sat at the town of Halat (Ahlat) on the northern shore of [[Lake Van]].\n\nThe Arab conquest allowed the East Syriacs to move into western Mesopotamia and establish communities in Damascus and other towns that had formerly been in Roman territory, where they lived alongside much larger Syrian Orthodox, Armenian and Melkite communities.  Some of these western communities were placed under the jurisdiction of the East Syriac metropolitans of Damascus, but others were attached to the province of Nisibis.   The latter included a diocese for Harran and Callinicus (Raqqa), first attested in the 8th century and last mentioned towards the end of the 11th century, and a diocese at Maiperqat, first mentioned at the end of the 11th century, whose bishops were also responsible for the East Syriac communities in Amid and Mardin.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 49\u201350 and 88</ref>  Lists of dioceses in the province of Nisibis during the 11th and 13th centuries also mention a diocese for the Syrian town of Resh\u02bfa\u00efna (Ra\u02bfs al-{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Ain).  Resh\u02bfa\u00efna is a plausible location for an East Syriac diocese at this period, but none of its bishops are known.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 124</ref>\n\n====Province of Maishan====\n{{main|Maishan (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nThe province of Maishan seems to have come to an end in the 13th century.   The metropolitan diocese of Prath d\u2019Maishan is last mentioned in 1222, and the suffragan dioceses of Nahargur (\u02bfAbdasi), Karka d'Maishan (Dastumisan), and Rima (Nahr al-Dayr) probably ceased to exist rather earlier.  The diocese of Nahargur is last mentioned at the end of the 9th century, in the list of Eliya of Damascus.  The last-known bishop of Karka d'Maishan, Abraham, was present at the synod held by the patriarch Yohannan IV shortly after his election in 900, and an unnamed bishop of Rima attended the consecration of [[Eliya I]] in Baghdad in 1028.<ref name=\"Fiey, AC, iii. 272\u201382\">Fiey, ''AC'', iii. 272\u201382</ref>\n\n====Provinces of Mosul and Erbil====\n{{see also|Adiabene (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nErbil, the chief town of Adiabene, lost much of its former importance with the growth of the city of Mosul, and during the reign of the patriarch Timothy I (780\u2013823) the seat of the metropolitans of Adiabene was moved to Mosul.  The dioceses of Adiabene were governed by a 'metropolitan of Mosul and Erbil' for the next four and a half centuries.  Around 1200, Mosul and Erbil became separate metropolitan provinces.  The last known metropolitan of Mosul and Erbil was Tittos, who was appointed by Eliya III (1175\u201389).  Thereafter separate metropolitan bishops for Mosul and for Erbil are recorded in a fairly complete series from 1210 to 1318.\n\nFive new dioceses in the province of Mosul and Erbil were established during the Ummayad and \u02bfAbbasid periods: Marga, Salakh, Haditha, Taimana and Hebton.  The dioceses of Marga and Salakh, covering the districts around \u02bfAmadiya and \u02bfAqra, are first mentioned in the 8th century but may have been created earlier, perhaps in response to West Syrian competition in the Mosul region in the 7th century.   The diocese of Marga persisted into the 14th century, but the diocese of Salakh is last mentioned in the 9th century.  By the 8th century there was also an East Syriac diocese for the town of [[Hdatta]] (Haditha) on the Tigris, which persisted into the 14th century.  The diocese of Taimana, which embraced the district south of the Tigris in the vicinity of Mosul and included the monastery of Mar Mikha'il, is attested between the 8th and 10th centuries, but does not seem to have persisted into the 13th century.<ref>Fiey, ''AC'', ii. 336\u20137; and ''POCN'', 137</ref>\n\nA number of East Syriac bishops are attested between the 8th and 13th centuries for the diocese of Hebton, a region of northwest Adiabene to the south of the Great Zab, adjacent to the district of Marga.  It is not clear when the diocese was created, but it is first mentioned under the name 'Hnitha and Hebton' in 790.  Hnitha was another name for the diocese of Ma\u02bfaltha, and the patriarch Timothy I is said to have united the dioceses of Hebton and \u1e24nitha in order to punish the presumption of the bishop Rustam of Hnitha, who had opposed his election.  The union was not permanent, and by the 11th century Hebton and Ma\u02bfaltha were again separate dioceses.\n\nBy the middle of the 8th century the diocese of [[Adarbaigan (East Syrian Diocese)|Adarbaigan]], formerly independent, was a suffragan diocese of the province of Adiabene.<ref>Wallis Budge, ''Book of Governors'', ii. 315\u201316</ref>\n\n====Province of Beth Garma\u00ef====\n{{main|Beth Garma\u00ef (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nIn its heyday, at the end of the 6th century, there were at least nine dioceses in the province of Beth Garma\u00ef.   As in Beth Aramaye, the Christian population of Beth Garma\u00ef began to fall in the first centuries of Moslem rule, and the province's decline is reflected in the forced relocation of the metropolis from Karka d'Beth Slokh (Kirkuk) in the 9th century and the gradual disappearance of all of the province's suffragan dioceses between the 7th and 12th centuries.  The dioceses of Hrbath Glal and Barhis are last mentioned in 605; Mahoze d\u2019Arewan around 650; Karka d\u2019Beth Slokh around 830; Khanijar in 893; Lashom around 895; Tahal around 900; Shahrgard in 1019; and Shahrzur around 1134.  By the beginning of the 14th century the metropolitan of Beth Garma\u00ef, who now sat at Daquqa, was the only remaining bishop in this once-flourishing province.\n\n===Exterior provinces===\n\n==== Fars and Arabia ====\n{{see also|Fars (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nAt the beginning of the 7th century there were  several dioceses in the province of Fars and its dependencies in northern Arabia (Beth Qatraye).  Fars was marked out by its Arab conquerors for a thoroughgoing process of islamicisation, and Christianity declined more rapidly in this region than in any other part of the former Sassanian empire.  The last-known bishop of the metropolitan see of Rev Ardashir was \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf, who was present at the enthronement of the patriarch \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf III in 1138.  In 890 Eliya of Damascus listed the suffragan sees of Fars, in order of seniority, as Shiraz, Istakhr, Shapur (probably to be identified with Bih Shapur, i.e. Kazrun), Karman, Darabgard, Shiraf (Ardashir Khurrah), Marmadit, and the island of Soqotra.  Only two bishops are known from the mainland dioceses:  Melek of Darabgard, who was deposed in the 560s, and Gabriel of Bih Shapur, who was present at the enthronement of \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf I in 963.  Fars was spared by the Mongols for its timely submission in the 1220s, but by then there seem to have been few Christians left, although an East Syriac community (probably without bishops) survived at Hormuz.  This community is last mentioned in the 16th century.\n\nOf the northern Arabian dioceses, Mashmahig is last mentioned around 650, and Dairin, Oman (Beth Mazunaye), Hajar and Hatta in 676.  [[Socotra|Soqotra]] remained an isolated outpost of Christianity in the Arabian sea, and its bishop attended the enthronement of the patriarch [[Yaballaha III|Yahballaha III]] in 1281.  Marco Polo visited the island in the 1280s, and claimed that it had an East Syriac archbishop, with a suffragan bishop on the nearby 'Island of Males'.  In a casual testimony to the impressive geographical extension of the Church of the East in the \u02bfAbbasid period, [[Thomas of Marga]] mentions that Yemen and Sana\u02bfa had a bishop named Peter during the reign of the patriarch Abraham II (837\u201350) who had earlier served in China.  This diocese is not mentioned again.\n\n====Khorasan and Segestan====\n{{see also|Merv (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nTimothy I consecrated a metropolitan named Hnanisho\u02bf for Sarbaz in the 790s.  This diocese is not mentioned again.  In 893 Eliya of Damascus recorded that the metropolitan province of Merv had suffragan sees at 'Dair Hans', 'Damadut', and 'Da\u02bfbar Sanai', three districts whose locations are entirely unknown.\n\nBy the 11th century East Syriac Christianity was in decline in Khorasan and Segestan.  The last-known metropolitan of Merv was \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf, who was consecrated by the patriarch Mari (987\u20131000).  The last-known metropolitan of Herat was Giwargis, who flourished in the reign of Sabrisho\u02bf III (1064\u201372).  If any of the suffragan dioceses were still in existence at this period, they are not mentioned.  The surviving urban Christian communities in Khorasan suffered a heavy blow at the start of the 13th century, when the cities of Merv, Nishapur and Herat were stormed by Genghis Khan in 1220.  Their inhabitants were massacred, and although all three cities were refounded shortly afterwards, it is likely that they had only small East Syriac communities thereafter.  Nevertheless, at least one diocese survived into the 13th century.  In 1279 an unnamed bishop of Tus entertained the monks Bar Sawma and Marqos in the monastery of Mar Sehyon near Tus during their pilgrimage from China to Jerusalem.\n\n====Media====\n{{see also|Hulwan (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nIn 893 Eliya of Damascus listed Hulwan as a metropolitan province, with suffragan dioceses for Dinawar (al-Dinur), Hamadan, Nihawand and al-Kuj.<ref name=\"Assemani, BO, ii. 485\u20139\"/>  'Al-Kuj' cannot be readily localised, and has been tentatively identified with Karaj d'Abu Dulaf.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 99</ref>  Little is known about these suffragan dioceses, except for isolated references to bishops of Dinawar and Nihawand, and by the end of the 12th century Hulwan and Hamadan were probably the only surviving centres of East Syriac Christianity in Media.  Around the beginning of the 13th century the metropolitan see of Hulwan was transferred to Hamadan, in consequence of the decline in Hulwan's importance.  The last-known bishop of Hulwan and Hamadan, Yohannan, flourished during the reign of Eliya III (1176\u201390).  Hamadan was sacked in 1220, and during the reign of Yahballaha III was also on more than one occasion the scene of anti-Christian riots.  It is possible that its Christian population at the end of the 13th century was small indeed, and it is not known whether it was still the seat of a metropolitan bishop.\n\n====Rai and Tabaristan====\n{{See also|Rai (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nThe diocese of Rai was raised to metropolitan status in 790 by the patriarch Timothy I.  According to Eliya of Damascus, Gurgan was a suffragan diocese of the province of Rai in 893.  It is doubtful whether either diocese still existed at the end of the 13th century.  The last-known bishop of Rai, {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abd al-Masih, was present at the consecration of {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} II in 1075 as 'metropolitan of Hulwan and Rai', suggesting that the episcopal seat of the bishops of Rai had been transferred to Hulwan.  According to the ''Mukhtasar'' of 1007/08, the diocese of 'Gurgan, Bilad al-Jibal and Dailam' had been suppressed, 'owing to the disappearance of Christianity in the region'.<ref>Fiey ''POCN'', 86</ref>\n\n====Little Armenia====\nThe Arran or Little Armenia district in modern Azerbaijan, with its chief town Barda\u02bfa, was an East Syriac metropolitan province in the 10th and 11th centuries, and represented the northernmost extension of the Church of the East.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 58\u20139</ref>  A manuscript note of 1137 mentions that the diocese of Barda\u02bfa and Armenia no longer existed, and that the responsibilities of its metropolitans had been undertaken by the bishop of Halat.\n\n====Dailam, Gilan and Muqan====\nA major missionary drive was undertaken by the Church of the East in Dailam and Gilan towards the end of the 8th century on the initiative of the patriarch Timothy I (780\u2013823), led by three metropolitans and several suffragan bishops from the monastery of Beth \u02bfAbe.  [[Thomas of Marga]], who gave a detailed account of this mission in the ''Book of Governors'', preserved the names of the East Syriac bishops sent to Dailam:\n\n<blockquote>\nMar Qardagh, Mar [[Shubhalisho\u02bf]] and Mar Yahballaha were elected metropolitans of Gilan and of Dailam; and Thomas of Hdod, Zakkai of Beth Mule, Shem Bar Arlaye, Ephrem, Shem\u02bfon, Hnanya and David, who went with them from this monastery, were elected and consecrated bishops of those countries.<ref>Wallis Budge, ''Book of Governors'', ii. 447\u20138</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe metropolitan province of Dailam and Gilan created by Timothy I was transitory.  Moslem missionaries began to convert the Dailam region to Islam in the 9th century, and by the beginning of the 11th century the East Syriac diocese of Dailam, by then united with Gurgan as a suffragan diocese of Rai, no longer existed.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 82\u20133</ref>\n\nTimothy I also consecrated a bishop named Eliya for the Caspian district of Muqan, a diocese not mentioned elsewhere and probably also short-lived.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 113</ref>\n\n====Turkestan====\nIn Central Asia, the patriarch [[Sliba-zkha]] (714\u201328) created a metropolitan province for Samarqand, and a metropolitan of Samarqand is attested in 1018.<ref>[[Elijah of Nisibis]], ''Chronography'' (ed. Brooks), i. 35</ref>  Samarqand surrendered to Genghis Khan in 1220, and although many of its citizens were killed, the city was not destroyed.  Marco Polo mentions an East Syriac community in Samarqand in the 1270s.  [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] (780\u2013823) consecrated a metropolitan for Beth Turkaye, 'the country of the Turks'.  Beth Turkaye has been distinguished from Samarqand by the French scholar Dauvillier, who noted that {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Amr listed the two provinces separately, but may well have been another name for the same province.  Eliya III (1176\u201390) created a metropolitan province for Kashgar and Nevaketh.<ref>Dauvillier, ''Provinces chald\u00e9ennes'', 283\u201391; Fiey, ''POCN'', 128</ref>\n\n====India====\n{{main|India (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\n[[India]], which boasted a substantion East Syriac community at least as early as the 3rd century (the [[Saint Thomas Christians]]), became a metropolitan province of the Church of the East in the 7th century. Although few references to its clergy have survived, the colophon of a manuscript copied in 1301 in the church of Mar Quriaqos in [[Cranganore]] mentions the metropolitan Ya{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}qob of India. The metropolitan seat for India at this period was probably Cranganore, described in this manuscript as 'the royal city', and the main strength of the East Syriac church in India was along the [[Malabar Coast]], where it was when the Portuguese arrived in India at the beginning of the 16th century. There were also East Syriac communities on the east coast, around [[Madras]] and the shrine of Saint Thomas at [[Meliapur]].\n\n====Islands of the Sea====\nAn East Syrian metropolitan province in the \"Islands of the Sea\" existed at some point between the 11th and 14th centuries; this may be a reference to the [[East Indies]]. The patriarch Sabrisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} III (1064\u201372) despatched the metropolitan Hnanisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} of Jerusalem on a visitation to 'the Islands of the Sea'.<ref name=\"Mari, 125 Arabic, 110 Latin\">Mari, 125 (Arabic), 110 (Latin)</ref> These 'Islands of the Sea' may well have been the East Indies, as a list of metropolitan provinces compiled by the East Syriac writer {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} of Nisibis at the beginning of the 14th century includes the province 'of the Islands of the Sea between Dabag, Sin and Masin'.  Sin and Masin appear to refer to northern and southern China respectively, and Dabag to Java, implying that the province covered at least some of the islands of the East Indies.  The memory of this province persisted into the 16th century.  In 1503 the patriarch [[Eliya V]], in response to the request of a delegation from the East Syriac Christians of [[Saint Thomas Christians|Malabar]], also consecrated a number of bishops 'for India and the Islands of the Sea between Dabag, Sin and Masin'.<ref>Dauvillier, ''Provinces chald\u00e9ennes'', 314\u201316</ref>\n\n====China and Tibet====\n{{See also|Church of the East in China}}\n[[File:Nestorians-1-.jpg|thumb|150px|The headpiece of the [[Nestorian Stele]], erected in 781: 'The tablet of the spread of the brilliant teaching of Ta-ch'in [Syria] in China']]\nThe Church of the East is perhaps best known nowadays for its missionary work in [[China]] during the [[Tang Dynasty]]. The first recorded Christian mission to China was led by a Nestorian Christian with the Chinese name [[Alopen]], who arrived in the Chinese capital [[Chang'an]] in 635.<ref>Moule, ''Christians in China before the Year 1550'', 38</ref> In 781 a tablet (commonly known as the [[Nestorian Stele]]) was erected in the grounds of a Christian monastery in the Chinese capital Chang'an by the city's Christian community, displaying a long inscription in Chinese with occasional glosses in Syriac. The inscription described the eventful progress of the Nestorian mission in China since Alopen's arrival.\n\nChina became a [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] province of the Church of the East, under the name [[Beth Sinaye]], in the first quarter of the 8th century. According to the 14th-century writer \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf of Nisibis, the province was established by the patriarch [[Sliba-zkha]] (714\u201328).<ref>Mai, ''Scriptorum Veterum Nova Collectio'', x. 141</ref> Arguing from its position in the list of exterior provinces, which implied an 8th-century foundation, and on grounds of general historical probability, \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf refuted alternative claims that the province of Beth Sinaye had been founded either by the 5th-century patriarch [[Ahha]] (410\u201314) or the 6th-century patriarch [[Shila (Nestorian Patriarch)|Shila]] (503\u201323).<ref>Wilmshurst, ''The Martyred Church'', 123\u20134</ref>\n\nThe [[Nestorian Stele]] inscription was composed in 781 by Adam, 'priest, bishop and ''papash'' of Sinistan', probably the metropolitan of Beth Sinaye, and the inscription also mentions the archdeacons Gigoi of Khumdan [Chang'an] and Gabriel of Sarag [Lo-yang]; Yazdbuzid, 'priest and country-bishop of Khumdan'; Sargis, 'priest and country-bishop'; and the bishop Yohannan. These references confirm that the Church of the East in China had a well-developed hierarchy at the end of the 8th century, with bishops in both northern capitals, and there were probably other dioceses besides Chang'an and Lo-yang. Shortly afterwards Thomas of Marga mentions the monk David of Beth \u02bfAbe, who was metropolitan of Beth Sinaye during the reign of [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] (780\u2013823).  Timothy I is said also to have consecrated a metropolitan for Tibet (Beth Tuptaye), a province not again mentioned. The province of Beth Sinaye is last mentioned in 987 by the Arab writer Abu'l Faraj, who met a Nestorian monk who had recently returned from China, who informed him that 'Christianity was just extinct in China; the native Christians had perished in one way or another; the church which they had used had been destroyed; and there was only one Christian left in the land'.<ref>Wilmshurst, ''The Martyred Church'', 222</ref>\n\n====Syria, Palestine, Cilicia and Egypt====\nAlthough the main East Syriac missionary impetus was eastwards, the Arab conquests paved the way for the establishment of East Syriac communities to the west of the Church's northern Mesopotamian heartland, in Syria, Palestine, Cilicia and Egypt.  [[Damascus]] became the seat of an East Syriac metropolitan around the end of the 8th century, and the province had five suffragan dioceses in 893:  Aleppo, Jerusalem, Mambeg, Mopsuestia, and Tarsus and Malatya.<ref name=\"Assemani, BO, ii. 485\u20139\"/>\n\nAccording to Thomas of Marga, the diocese of Damascus was established in the 7th century as a suffragan diocese in the province of Nisibis.  The earliest known bishop of Damascus, Yohannan, is attested in 630.  His title was 'bishop of the scattered of Damascus', presumably a population of East Syriac refugees displaced by the Roman-Persian Wars.  Damascus was raised to metropolitan status by the patriarch Timothy I (780\u2013823).  In 790 the bishop Shallita of Damascus was still a suffragan bishop.<ref>Chabot, 608.</ref>  Some time after 790 Timothy consecrated the future patriarch Sabrisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} II (831\u20135) as the city's first metropolitan.<ref>Mari, 76 (Arabic), 67\u20138 (Latin)</ref>  Several metropolitans of Damascus are attested between the 9th and 11th centuries, including [[Eliya ibn \u02bfUbaid]], who was consecrated in 893 by the patriarch Yohannan III and bore the title 'metropolitan of Damascus, Jerusalem and the Shore (probably a reference to the East Syriac communities in Cilicia)'.<ref name=\"Sliba, 80 Arabic\">Sliba, 80 (Arabic)</ref>  The last known metropolitan of Damascus, Marqos, was consecrated during the reign of the patriarch {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} II (1074\u201390).<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 72</ref>  It is not clear whether the diocese of Damascus survived into the 12th century.\n\nAlthough little is known about its episcopal succession, the East Syriac diocese of Jerusalem seems to have remained a suffragan diocese in the province of Damascus throughout the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 97\u20138</ref>  The earliest known bishop of Jerusalem was Eliya Ibn {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Ubaid, who was appointed metropolitan of Damascus in 893 by the patriarch Yohannan III.<ref name=\"Sliba, 80 Arabic\"/>  Nearly two centuries later a bishop named Hnanisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} was consecrated for Jerusalem by the patriarch [[Sabrisho III|Sabrisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} III]] (1064\u201372).<ref name=\"Mari, 125 Arabic, 110 Latin\"/>\n\nLittle is known about the diocese of Aleppo, and even less about the dioceses of Mambeg, Mopsuestia, and Tarsus and Malatya.  The literary sources have preserved the name of only one bishop from these regions, Ibn Tubah, who was consecrated for Aleppo by the patriarch [[Sabrisho III|Sabrisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} III]] in 1064.<ref name=\"Mari, 125 Arabic, 110 Latin\"/>\n\nA number of East Syriac bishops of Egypt are attested between the 8th and 11th centuries.  The earliest known bishop, Yohannan, is attested around the beginning of the 8th century.  His successors included Sulaiman, consecrated in error by the patriarch {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} I (983\u20136) and recalled when it was discovered that the diocese already had a bishop; Joseph al-Shirazi, injured during a riot in 996 in which Christian churches in Egypt were attacked; Yohannan of Haditha, consecrated by the patriarch Sabrisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} III in 1064; and Marqos, present at the consecration of the patriarch Makkikha I in 1092.  It is doubtful whether the East Syriac diocese of Egypt survived into the 13th century.<ref>Meinardus, 116\u201321; Fiey, ''POCN'', 78</ref>\n\n==Mongol period==\n{{See also|Christianity among the Mongols}}\nAt the end of the 13th century the Church of the East still extended across Asia to China.  Twenty-two bishops were present at the consecration of [[Yaballaha III|Yahballaha III]] in 1281, and while most of them were from the dioceses of northern Mesopotamia, the metropolitans of Jerusalem, {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Ilam, and Tangut (northwest China), and the bishops of Susa and the island of Soqotra were also present.  During their journey from China to Baghdad in 1279, Yahballaha and Bar Sawma were offered hospitality by an unnamed bishop of Tus in northeastern Persia, confirming that there was still a Christian community in Khorasan, however reduced.  India had a metropolitan named Ya{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}qob at the beginning of the 14th century, mentioned together with the patriarch [[Yaballaha III|Yahballaha]] 'the fifth (''sic''), the Turk' in a colophon of 1301.   In the 1320s [[Yaballaha III|Yahballaha]]'s biographer praised the progress made by the Church of the East in converting the 'Indians, Chinese and Turks', without suggesting that this achievement was under threat.<ref>Wallis Budge, ''The Monks of Kublai Khan'', 122\u20133</ref>  In 1348 {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Amr listed twenty-seven metropolitan provinces stretching from Jerusalem to China, and although his list may be anachronistic in several respects, he was surely accurate in portraying a church whose horizons still stretched far beyond Kurdistan.    The provincial structure of the church in 1318 was much the same as it had been when it was established in 410 at the synod of Isaac, and many of the 14th-century dioceses had existed, though perhaps under a different name, nine hundred years earlier.\n\n===Interior provinces===\nAt the same time, however, significant changes had taken place which were only partially reflected in the organisational structure of the church.  Between the 7th and 14th centuries Christianity gradually disappeared in southern and central Iraq (the ecclesiastical provinces of Maishan, Beth Aramaye and Beth Garma\u00ef).  There were twelve dioceses in the patriarchal province of Beth Aramaye at the beginning of the 11th century, only three of which (Beth Waziq, Beth Daron, and Tirhan, all well to the north of Baghdad) survived into the 14th century.<ref>Fiey, ''AC'', iii. 151\u2013262</ref>  There were four dioceses in Maishan (the Basra district) at the end of the 9th century, only one of which (the metropolitan diocese of Prath d\u2019Maishan) survived into the 13th century, to be mentioned for the last time in 1222.<ref name=\"Fiey, AC, iii. 272\u201382\"/>  There were at least nine dioceses in the province of Beth Garma\u00ef in the 7th century, only one of which (the metropolitan diocese of Daquqa) survived into the 14th century.<ref>Fiey, ''AC'', iii. 54\u2013146</ref>  The disappearance of these dioceses was a slow and apparently peaceful process (which can be traced in some detail in Beth Aramaye, where dioceses were repeatedly amalgamated over a period of two centuries), and it is probable that the consolidation of Islam in these districts was accompanied by a gradual migration of East Syriac Christians to northern Iraq, whose Christian population was larger and more deeply rooted, not only in the towns but in hundreds of long-established Christian villages.\n\nBy the end of the 13th century, although isolated East Syriac outposts persisted to the southeast of the Great Zab, the districts of northern Mesopotamia included in the metropolitan provinces of Mosul and Nisibis were clearly regarded as the heartland of the Church of the East.  When the monks Bar Sawma and Marqos (the future patriarch Yahballaha III) arrived in Mesopotamia from China in the late 1270s, they visited several East Syriac monasteries and churches:\n\n<blockquote>\nThey arrived in Baghdad, and from there they went to the great church of Kokhe, and to the monastery of Mar Mari the apostle, and received a blessing from the relics of that country.  And from there they turned back and came to the country of Beth Garma\u00ef, and they received blessings from the shrine of Mar Ezekiel, which was full of helps and healings.  And from there they went to Erbil, and from there to Mosul.  And they went to Shigar, and Nisibis and Mardin, and were blessed by the shrine containing the bones of Mar Awgin, the second Christ.  And from there they went to [[Gazarta]] d'Beth Zabda\u00ef, and they were blessed by all the shrines and monasteries, and the religious houses, and the monks, and the fathers in their dioceses.<ref>Wallis Budge, ''The Monks of Kublai Khan'', 142\u20133</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWith the exception of the patriarchal church of Kokhe in Baghdad and the nearby monastery of Mar Mari, all these sites were well to the north of Baghdad, in the districts of northern Mesopotamia where historic East Syriac Christianity survived into the 20th century.\n\nA similar pattern is evident several years later.  Eleven bishops were present at the consecration of the patriarch [[Timothy II (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy II]] in 1318:  the metropolitans Joseph of {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Ilam, {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} of Nisibis and Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}on of Mosul, and the bishops Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}on of Beth Garma\u00ef, Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}on of [[Tirhan (East Syrian Diocese)|Tirhan]], Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}on of Balad, Yohannan of Beth Waziq, Yohannan of [[Shigar (East Syrian Diocese)|Shigar]], {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} of Hnitha, Isaac of Beth Daron and Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}yahb of Tella and Barbelli (Marga).  Timothy himself had been metropolitan of Erbil before his election as patriarch.  Again, with the exception of {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Ilam (whose metropolitan, Joseph, was present in his capacity of 'guardian of the throne' (''natar kursya'') all the dioceses represented were in northern Mesopotamia.<ref>Assemani, ''BO'', iii. i. 567\u201380</ref>\n\n====Provinces of Mosul and Erbil====\n{{See also|Adiabene (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nAt the beginning of the 13th century there were at least eight suffragan dioceses in the provinces of Mosul and Erbil:  Haditha, Ma{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}altha, Hebton, Beth Bgash, Dasen, Beth Nuhadra, Marga and Urmi.  The diocese of Hebton is last mentioned in 1257, when its bishop Gabriel attended the consecration of the patriarch [[Makkikha II]].<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 89\u201390</ref>  The diocese of Dasen definitely persisted into the 14th century, as did the diocese of Marga, though it was renamed Tella and Barbelli in the second half of the 13th century.  It is possible that the dioceses of Beth Nuhadra, Beth Bgash and Haditha also survived into the 14th century.  Haditha, indeed, is mentioned as a diocese at the beginning of the 14th century by {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} of Nisibis.<ref>Fiey, POCN, 86\u20137</ref>  Urmi too, although none of its bishops are known, may also have persisted as a diocese into the 16th century, when it again appears as the seat of an East Syriac bishop.<ref name=\"Fiey, POCN, 141\u20132\">Fiey, ''POCN'', 141\u20132</ref>  The diocese of Ma{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}altha is last mentioned in 1281, but probably persisted into the 14th century under the name Hnitha.  The bishop {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} 'of Hnitha', attested in 1310 and 1318, was almost certainly a bishop of the diocese formerly known as Ma{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}altha.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 91\u20132 and 106</ref>\n\n====Province of Nisibis====\n{{See also|Nisibis (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nThe celebrated East Syriac writer {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} of Nisibis, himself metropolitan of Nisibis and Armenia, listed thirteen suffragan dioceses in the province 'of Soba (Nisibis) and Mediterranean Syria' at the end of the 13th century, in the following order:  Arzun, Qube, Beth Rahima\u00ef, Balad, Shigar, Qardu, Tamanon, Beth Zabda\u00ef, Halat, Harran, Amid, Resh{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}a\u00efna and 'Adormiah' (Qarta and Adarma).<ref>Chabot, 619\u201320</ref>  It has been convincingly argued that {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} was giving a conspectus of dioceses in the province of Nisibis at various periods in its history rather than an authentic list of late 13th-century dioceses, and it is most unlikely that dioceses of Qube, Beth Rahima\u00ef, Harran and Resh{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}a\u00efna still existed at this period.\n\nA diocese was founded around the middle of the 13th century to the north of the Tur {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdin for the town of Hesna d'Kifa, perhaps in response to East Syriac immigration to the towns of the Tigris plain during the Mongol period.  At the same time, a number of older dioceses may have ceased to exist.  The dioceses of Qaimar and Qarta and Adarma are last mentioned towards the end of the 12th century, and the diocese of Tamanon in 1265, and it is not clear whether they persisted into the 14th century.  The only dioceses in the province of Nisibis definitely in existence at the end of the 13th century were Armenia (whose bishops sat at Halat on the northern shore of Lake Van), Shigar, Balad, Arzun and Maiperqat.\n\n===Exterior provinces===\n\n==== Arabia, Persia and Central Asia ====\n[[Image:NestorianTombstoneIssykKul1312.jpg|thumb|right|120px|East Syriac tombstone of 1312 from Issyk Kul, with Uighur inscription]]\nBy the end of the 13th century Christianity was also declining in the exterior provinces.  Between the 7th and 14th centuries Christianity gradually disappeared in Arabia and Persia.  There were at least five dioceses in northern Arabia in the 7th century and nine in Fars at the end of the 9th century, only one of which (the isolated island of [[Socotra|Soqotra]]) survived into the 14th century.<ref>Fiey, ''Communaut\u00e9s syriaques'', 177\u2013219</ref>  There were perhaps twenty East Syriac dioceses in Media, Tabaristan, Khorasan and Segestan at the end of the 9th century, only one of which (Tus in Khorasan) survived into the 13th century.<ref>Fiey, ''Communaut\u00e9s syriaques'', 75\u2013104 and 357\u201384</ref>\n\nThe East Syriac communities in Central Asia disappeared during the 14th century.  Continual warfare eventually made it impossible for the Church of the East to send bishops to minister to its far-flung congregations.  The blame for the destruction of the Christian communities east of [[Iraq]] has often been thrown upon the [[Turco-Mongol]] leader [[Timur]], whose campaigns during the 1390s spread havoc throughout Persia and Central Asia.  There is no reason to doubt that Timur was responsible for the destruction of certain Christian communities, but in much of central Asia Christianity had died out decades earlier.  The surviving evidence, including a large number of dated graves, indicates that the crisis for the Church of the East occurred in the 1340s rather than the 1390s.  Few Christian graves have been found later than the 1340s, indicating that the isolated East Syriac communities in Central Asia, weakened by warfare, plague and lack of leadership, converted to Islam around the middle of the 14th century.\n\n====Adarbaigan====\nAlthough the Church of the East was losing ground to Islam in Iran and Central Asia, it was making gains elsewhere.  The migration of Christians from southern Mesopotamia led to a revival of Christianity in the province of Adarbaigan, where Christians could practice their religion freely under Mongol protection.  An East Syriac diocese is mentioned as early as 1074 at Urmi,<ref name=\"Fiey, POCN, 141\u20132\"/> and three others were created before the end of the 13th century, one a new metropolitan see for the province of Adarbaigan (possibly replacing the old metropolitan province of Arran, and with its seat at [[Tabriz]]), and three others for Eshnuq, [[Salmas]] and al-Rustaq (probably to be identified with the Shemsdin district of Hakkari).<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 126, 127 and 142\u20133</ref> The metropolitan of Adarbaigan was present at the consecration of the patriarch [[Mar Denha I|Denha I]] in 1265, while bishops of Eshnuq, [[Salmas]] and al-Rustaq attended the consecration of [[Yaballaha III|Yahballaha III]] in 1281.  The foundation of these four dioceses probably reflected a migration of East Syriac Christians to the shores of Lake Urmi after the lakeside towns became Mongol cantonments in the 1240s.  According to the Armenian historian [[Kirakos of Gandzak]], the Mongol occupation of Adarbaigan enabled churches to be built in Tabriz and Nakichevan for the first time in those cities\u2019 history.  Substantial Christian communities are attested in both towns at the end of the 13th century, and also in Maragha, Hamadan and Sultaniyyeh.\n\n====China====\n[[Image:HulaguAndDokuzKathun.JPG|thumb|right|The Mongol khan [[Hulagu Khan|Hulagu]] and his Christian queen [[Doquz Khatun]]]]\n{{see also|Christianity among the Mongols|Church of the East in China}}\nThere were also temporary Christian gains further afield.  The Mongol conquest of China in the second half of the 13th century allowed the East Syriac church to return to China, and by the end of the century two new metropolitan provinces had been created for China, Tangut and 'Katai and Ong'.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 48\u20139, 103\u20134 and 137\u20138</ref>  \n\nThe province of Tangut covered northwestern China, and its metropolitan seems to have sat at [[Almaliq, Xinjiang|Almaliq]].  The province evidently had several dioceses, even though they cannot now be localised, as the metropolitan Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}on Bar Qaligh of Tangut was arrested by the patriarch [[Mar Denha I|Denha I]] shortly before his death in 1281 'together with a number of his bishops'.<ref>Bar Hebraeus, ''Ecclesiastical Chronicle'', ii. 450</ref>  \n\nThe province of Katai [Cathay] and Ong, which seems to have replaced the old T'ang dynasty province of Beth Sinaye, covered northern China and the country of the Christian [[Ongud|Ongut]] tribe around the great bend of the Yellow River.  The metropolitans of Katai and Ong probably sat at the Mongol capital Khanbaliq.  The patriarch Yahballaha III grew up in a monastery in northern China in the 1270s, and the metropolitans Giwargis and Nestoris are mentioned in his biography.<ref>Wallis Budge, ''The Monks of Kublai Khan'', 127 and 132</ref>  [[Yaballaha III|Yahballaha]] himself was consecrated metropolitan of Katai and Ong by the patriarch [[Mar Denha I|Denha I]] shortly before his death in 1281.<ref>Bar Hebraeus, ''Ecclesiastical Chronicle'', ii. 452</ref> \n\nDuring the first half of the 14th century there were East Syriac Christian communities in many cities in China, and the province of Katai and Ong probably had several suffragan dioceses.  In 1253 William of Rubruck mentioned a Nestorian bishop in the town of 'Segin' (Xijing, modern [[Datong]] in [[Shanxi]] province).  The tomb of a Nestorian bishop named Shlemun, who died in 1313, has recently been discovered at [[Quanzhou]] in [[Fujian]] province.  Shlemun's epitaph described him as 'administrator of the Christians and Manicheans of Manzi (south China)'.  Marco Polo had earlier reported the existence of a Manichean community in Fujian, at first thought to be Christian, and it is not surprising to find this small religious minority represented officially by a Christian bishop.<ref>Lieu, S., ''Manichaeism in Central Asia and China'', 180</ref>\n\nThe 14th-century Nestorian communities in China existed under Mongol protection, and were dispersed when the Mongol Yuan dynasty was overthrown in 1368.\n\n====Palestine and Cyprus====\nThere were East Syriac communities at Antioch, Tripolis and Acre in the 1240s.  The metropolitan Abraham 'of Jerusalem and Tripolis' was present at the consecration of the patriarch [[Yaballaha III]] in 1281.<ref>Sliba, 124 (Arabic)</ref>  Abraham probably sat in the coastal city of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripolis]] (still in Crusader hands until 1289) rather than Jerusalem, which had fallen definitively to the [[Mameluks]] in 1241.\n\nThe Crusader stronghold of [[Acre (Israel)|Acre]], the last city in the Holy Land under Christian control, fell to the [[Mameluks]] in 1291.  Most of the city's Christians, unwilling to live under Moslem rule, abandoned their homes and resettled in Christian Cyprus.  Cyprus had an East Syriac bishop in 1445, Timothy, who made a Catholic profession of faith at the [[Council of Florence]], and was probably already the seat of an East Syriac bishop or metropolitan by the end of the 13th century.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dioceses of the Church of the East, 1318\u20131552]]\n* [[Dioceses of the Church of the East after 1552]]\n* [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* Abbeloos, J.

These dioceses were organised into six interior provinces in [[Mesopotamia]], in the Church's [[Iraq]]i heartland, and a dozen or more second-rank exterior provinces. Most of the exterior provinces were located in [[Iran]], [[Central Asia]], [[India]] and China, testifying to the Church's remarkable eastern expansion in the Middle Ages. A number of [[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] dioceses were also established in the towns of the eastern Mediterranean, in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Syria]], [[Cilicia]] and [[Egypt]].\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Maps of the Armenian Empire of Tigranes.gif|thumb|300px|The western provinces of the Parthian empire]]\nThere are few sources for the ecclesiastical organisation of the Church of the East before the [[Sassanian]] (Persian) period, and the information provided in martyr acts and local histories such as the ''Chronicle of Erbil'' may not always be genuine.  The ''Chronicle of Erbil'', for example, provides a list of East Syriac dioceses supposedly in existence by 225.  References to bishops in other sources confirm the existence of many of these dioceses, but it is impossible to be sure that all of them had been founded at this early period.  Diocesan history was a subject particularly susceptible to later alteration, as bishops sought to gain prestige by exaggerating the antiquity of their dioceses, and such evidence for an early diocesan structure in the Church of the East must be treated with great caution.  Firmer ground is only reached with the 4th-century narratives of the martyrdoms of bishops during the persecution of [[Shapur II]], which name several bishops and dioceses in Mesopotamia and elsewhere.\n\nThe ecclesiastical organisation of the Church of the East in the Sassanian period, at least in the interior provinces and from the 5th century onwards, is known in some detail from the records of [[synod]]s convened by the patriarchs [[Isaac (patriarch)|Isaac]] in 410, [[Yahballaha I]] in 420, Dadisho\u02bf in 424, [[Acacius (Nestorian Patriarch)|Acacius]] in 486, [[Babai (Nestorian patriarch)|Baba\u00ef]] in 497, [[Aba I]] in 540 and 544, [[Joseph (Nestorian Patriarch)|Joseph]] in 554, Ezekiel in 576, [[Ishoyahb I|Isho\u02bfyahb I]] in 585 and [[Gregory (Nestorian Patriarch)|Gregory]] in 605.<ref>Chabot, 274\u20135, 283\u20134, 285, 306\u20137 and 318\u201351</ref>  These documents record the names of the bishops who were either present at these gatherings, or who adhered to their acts by proxy or later signature.  These synods also dealt with diocesan discipline, and throw interesting light on the problems which the leaders of the church faced in trying to maintain high standards of conduct among their widely dispersed episcopate.\n\nAfter the [[Expansion of Islam|Arab conquest in the 7th century]], the sources for the ecclesiastical organisation of the Church of the East are of a slightly different nature from the synodical acts and historical narratives of the Sassanian period.  As far as its patriarchs are concerned, reign-dates and other dry but interesting details have often been meticulously preserved, giving the historian a far better chronological framework for the [[Ummayad]] and \u02bf[[Abbasid]] periods than for the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] and post-Mongol periods.  The 11th-century ''Chronography'' of [[Elijah of Nisibis]], edited in 1910 by E. W. Brooks and translated into Latin (''Eliae Metropolitae Nisibeni Opus Chronologicum''), recorded the date of consecration, length of reign and date of death of all the patriarchs from [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] (780\u2013823) to [[Yohannan V]] (1001\u201311), and also supplied important information on some of Timothy's predecessors.\n\nValuable additional information on the careers of the East Syriac patriarchs is supplied in histories of the Church of the East since its foundation written by the 12th-century East Syriac author [[Mari ibn Sulaiman]] and the 14th-century authors [[\u02bfAmr ibn Mattai]] and [[Sliba ibn Yuhanna]].  Mari's history, written in the second half of the 12th century, ends with the reign of the patriarch [[Abdisho III|\u02bfAbdisho\u02bf III]] (1139\u201348).  The 14th-century writer \u02bfAmr ibn Mattai, bishop of Tirhan, abridged Mari's history but also provided a number of new details and brought it up to the reign of the patriarch [[Yahballaha III]] (1281\u20131317).  Sliba, in turn, continued \u02bfAmr's text into the reign of the patriarch Timothy II (1318 \u2013 c. 1332).  Unfortunately, no English translation has yet been made of these important sources.  They remain available only in their original Arabic and in a Latin translation (''Maris, Amri, et Salibae: De Patriarchis Nestorianorum Commentaria'') made between 1896 and 1899 by Enrico Gismondi.\n\nThere are also a number of valuable references to the Church of the East and its bishops in the ''Chronicon Ecclesiasticum'' of the 13th-century West Syriac writer [[Bar Hebraeus]].  Although principally a history of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], the ''Chronicon Ecclesiasticum'' frequently mentions developments in the East Syriac church that affected the West Syriacs.  Like its East Syriac counterparts, the ''Chronicon Ecclesiasticum'' has not yet been translated into English, and remains available only in its Syriac original and in a Latin translation (''Bar Hebraeus Chronicon Ecclesiasticum'') made in 1877 by its editors, [[Jean Baptiste Abbeloos]] and [[Thomas Joseph Lamy]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nRather less is known about the diocesan organisation of the Church of the East under the caliphate than during the Sassanian period.   Although the acts of several synods held between the 7th and 13th centuries were recorded (the 14th-century author \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf of [[Nisibis]] mentions the acts of the synods of Isho\u02bf Bar Nun and [[Eliya I]], for example), most have not survived.  The synod of the patriarch Gregory in 605 was the last ecumenical synod of the Church of the East whose acts have survived in full, though the records of local synods convened at Dairin in Beth Qatraye by the patriarch Giwargis in 676 and in [[Adiabene]] in 790 by [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] have also survived by chance.<ref>Chabot, 318\u201351, 482 and 608</ref>  The main sources for the episcopal organisation of the Church of the East during the [[Ummayad]] and \u02bfAbbasid periods are the histories of Mari, \u02bfAmr and Sliba, which frequently record the names and dioceses of the metropolitans and bishops present at the consecration of a patriarch or appointed by him during his reign.  These records tend to be patchy before the 11th century, and the chance survival of a list of bishops present at the consecration of the patriarch [[Yohannan IV]] in 900 helps to fill one of the many gaps in our knowledge.<ref name=\"MS Paris BN Syr 354, folio 147\">MS Paris BN Syr 354, folio 147</ref>  The records of attendance at patriarchal consecrations must be used with caution, however, as they can give a misleading impression.  They inevitably gave prominence to the bishops of Mesopotamia and overlooked those of the more remote dioceses who were unable to be present.   These bishops were often recorded in the acts of the Sassanian synods, because they adhered to their acts by letter.\n\nTwo lists in Arabic of East Syriac metropolitan provinces and their constituent dioceses during the \u02bfAbbasid period have survived.  The first, reproduced in Assemani's ''Bibliotheca Orientalis'', was made in 893 by the historian [[Eliya of Damascus]].<ref name=\"Assemani, BO, ii. 485\u20139\">Assemani, ''BO'', ii. 485\u20139</ref>  The second, a summary ecclesiastical history of the Church of the East known as the ''Mukhtasar al-akhbar al-bi\u02bfiya'', was compiled in 1007/8.  This history, published by B. Haddad (Baghdad, 2000), survives in an Arabic manuscript in the possession of the Chaldean Church, and the French ecclesiastical historian [[J. M. Fiey]] made selective use of it in ''Pour un Oriens Christianus Novus'' (Beirut, 1993), a study of the dioceses of the West and East Syriac churches.\n\nA number of local histories of monasteries in northern Mesopotamia were also written at this period (in particular Thomas of Marga\u2019s ''Book of Governors'', the ''History of Rabban Bar \u02bfIdta'', the ''History of Rabban Hormizd the Persian'', the ''History of Mar Sabrisho\u02bf of Beth Qoqa'' and the ''Life of Rabban Joseph Busnaya'') and these histories, together with a number of hagiographical accounts of the lives of notable holy men, occasionally mention bishops of the northern Mesopotamian dioceses.\n\n[[Thomas of Marga]] is a particularly important source for the second half of the 8th century and the first half of the 9th century, a period for which little synodical information has survived and also few references to the attendance of bishops at patriarchal consecrations.  As a monk of the important monastery of Beth \u02bfAbe, and later the secretary of the patriarch [[Abraham II (Nestorian patriarch)|Abraham II]] (832\u201350), he had access to a wide range of written sources, including the correspondence of the patriarch Timothy I, and could also draw on the traditions of his old monastery and the long memories of its monks.  Thirty or forty otherwise unattested bishops of this period are mentioned in the ''Book of Governors'', and it is the prime source for the existence of the northern Mesopotamian diocese of Salakh.  A particularly important passage mentions the prophecy of the monastery\u2019s superior [[Quriaqos]], who flourished around the middle of the 8th century, that forty-two of the monks under his care would later become bishops, metropolitans, or even patriarchs.   Thomas was able to name, and supply interesting information about, thirty-one of these bishops.<ref>Wallis Budge, ''Book of Governors'', ii. 444\u20139</ref>\n\nNevertheless, references to bishops beyond Mesopotamia are infrequent and capricious.  Furthermore, many of the relevant sources are in Arabic rather than Syriac, and often use a different Arabic name for a diocese previously attested only in the familiar Syriac form of the synodical acts and other early sources.  Most of the Mesopotamian dioceses can be readily identified in their new Arabic guise, but on occasion the use of Arabic presents difficulties of identification.\n\n==Parthian period==\nBy the middle of the 4th century, when many of its bishops were martyred during the persecution of [[Shapur II]], the Church of the East probably had twenty or more dioceses within the borders of the Sassanian empire, in [[Beth Aramaye]] ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0710\u072a\u0721\u071d\u0710}}), Beth Huzaye ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0717\u0718\u0719\u071d\u0710}}), Maishan ({{lang|syr|\u0721\u071d\u072b\u0722}}), Adiabene (Hdyab, {{lang|syr|\u071a\u0715\u071d\u0710\u0712}}) and Beth Garma\u00ef ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c\u0713\u072a\u0721\u071d}}), and possibly also in Khorasan.  Some of these dioceses may have been at least a century old, and it is possible that many of them were founded before the Sassanian period.  According to the ''Chronicle of Erbil'' there were several dioceses in Adiabene and elsewhere in the Parthian empire as early as the end of the 1st century, and more than twenty dioceses in 225 in Mesopotamia and northern Arabia, including the following seventeen named dioceses: [[Beth Zabdai|B\u0113\u1e6f Za\u1e07dai]] ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0719\u0712\u0715\u071d}}), [[Kirkuk|Karkh\u0101 d-B\u0113\u1e6f Sl\u014dkh]] ({{lang|syr|\u071f\u072a\u071f\u0710 \u0715\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0723\u0720\u0718\u071f}}), [[Kashkar|Ka\u0161kar]] ({{lang|syr|\u071f\u072b\u071f\u072a}}), [[Gundeshapur|B\u0113\u1e6f Lapa\u1e6d]] ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0720\u0726\u071b}}), [[Ahvaz|Horm\u012bzd Arda\u0161\u012br]] ({{lang|syr|\u0717\u0718\u072a\u0721\u071d\u0719\u0715 \u0710\u072a\u0715\u072b\u071d\u072a}}), [[Basra|Pr\u0101\u1e6f d-Mai\u0161\u0101n]] ({{lang|syr|\u0726\u072a\u072c \u0715\u0721\u071d\u072b\u0722}}), \u1e24n\u012b\u1e6f\u0101 ({{lang|syr|\u071a\u0722\u071d\u072c\u0710}}), \u1e24r\u1e07a\u1e6f Gl\u0101l ({{lang|syr|\u071a\u072a\u0712\u072c \u0713\u0720\u0720}}), Arzun ({{lang|syr|\u0710\u072a\u0719\u0718\u0722}}), Beth Niqator (apparently a district in Beth Garma\u00ef), Shahrgard, Beth Meskene (possibly Piroz Shabur, later an East Syriac diocese), Hulwan ({{lang|syr|\u071a\u0718\u0720\u0718\u0710\u0722}}), Beth Qatraye ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0729\u071b\u072a\u071d\u0710}}), Hazza (probably the village of that name near Erbil, though the reading is disputed), Dailam and Shigar (Sinjar).   The cities of Nisibis ({{lang|syr|\u0722\u0728\u071d\u0712\u071d\u0722}}) and Seleucia-Ctesiphon, it was said, did not have bishops at this period because of the hostility of the pagans towards an overt Christian presence in the towns.  The list is plausible, though it is perhaps surprising to find dioceses for Hulwan, Beth Qatraye, Dailam and Shigar so early, and it is not clear whether Beth Niqator was ever an East Syriac diocese.\n\n==Sassanid period==\n[[File:Dioceses of the Church of the East.svg|thumb|400px|Metropolitan provinces of the Church of the East.<br>\n{{legend|#800000|Mesopotamia}}\n{{legend|#008000|Persia}}\n{{legend|#000080|Later expansions.}}\n{{legend|#cd87de|Area of missionary activities}}\n]]\nDuring the 4th century the dioceses of the Church of the East began to group themselves into regional clusters, looking for leadership to the bishop of the chief city of the region.  This process was formalised at the [[synod of Isaac]] in 410, which first asserted the priority of the 'grand metropolitan' of [[Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] and then grouped most of the Mesopotamian dioceses into five geographically-based provinces (by order of precedence, [[Beth Huzaye (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Beth Huzaye]], [[Nisibis (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Nisibis]], [[Maishan (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Maishan]], [[Adiabene (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Adiabene]] and [[Beth Garma\u00ef (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Beth Garma\u00ef]]), each headed by a metropolitan bishop with jurisdiction over several suffragan bishops.  Canon XXI of the synod foreshadowed the extension of this metropolitan principle to a number of more remote dioceses in Fars, Media, Tabaristan, Khorasan and elsewhere.<ref name=\"Chabot, 273\">Chabot, 273</ref>  In the second half of the 6th century the bishops of Rev Ardashir and Merv (and possibly Herat) also became metropolitans.  The new status of the bishops of [[Fars (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Rev Ardashir]] and [[Merv (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Merv]] was recognised at the synod of Joseph in 554, and henceforth they took sixth and seventh place in precedence respectively after the metropolitan of Beth Garma\u00ef.  The bishop of [[Hulwan (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Hulwan]] became a metropolitan during the reign of Isho\u02bfyahb II (628\u201345).  The system established at this synod survived unchanged in its essentials for nearly a millennium.  Although during this period the number of metropolitan provinces increased as the church\u2019s horizons expanded, and although some suffragan dioceses within the original six metropolitan provinces died out and others took their place, all the metropolitan provinces created or recognised in 410 were still in existence in 1318.\n\n===Interior provinces===\n\n==== Province of the Patriarch ====\n{{main|Patriarchal Province of Seleucia-Ctesiphon}}\nThe patriarch himself sat at [[Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] or, more precisely, the Sassanian foundation of [[Veh-Ardashir]] on the west bank of the [[Tigris]], built in the 3rd century adjacent to the old city of [[Seleucia on the Tigris|Seleucia]], which was thereafter abandoned. The city of [[Ctesiphon]], founded by the Parthians, was nearby on the east bank of the Tigris, and the double city was always known by its early name Seleucia-Ctesiphon to the East Syriacs.  It was not normal for the head of an eastern church to administer an ecclesiastical province in addition to his many other duties, but circumstances made it necessary for Yahballaha I to assume responsibility for a number of dioceses in Beth Aramaye.\n\nThe dioceses of Kashkar, Zabe, Hirta ([[Al-Hirah|al-Hira]]), Beth Daraye and Dasqarta d'Malka (the Sassanian winter capital [[Dastagird]]), doubtless because of their antiquity or their proximity to the capital Seleucia-Ctesiphon, were reluctant to be placed under the jurisdiction of a metropolitan, and it was felt necessary to treat them tactfully.  A special relationship between the diocese of Kashkar, believed to have been an apostolic foundation, and the diocese of Seleucia-Ctesiphon was defined in Canon XXI of the synod of 410:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe first and chief seat is that of Seleucia and Ctesiphon; the bishop who occupies it is the grand metropolitan and chief of all the bishops.  The bishop of Kashkar is placed under the jurisdiction of this metropolitan; he is his right arm and minister, and he governs the diocese after his death.<ref>Chabot, 272</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAlthough the bishops of Beth Aramaye were admonished in the acts of these synods, they persisted in their intransigence, and in 420 Yahballaha I placed them under his direct supervision.  This ''ad hoc'' arrangement was later formalised by the creation of a 'province of the patriarch'.  As foreshadowed in the synod of Isaac in 410, Kashkar was the highest ranking diocese in this province, and the bishop of Kaskar became the 'guardian of the throne' (''natar kursya'') during the interregnum between one patriarch's death and the election of his successor.  The diocese of Dasqarta d'Malka is not mentioned again after 424, but bishops of the other dioceses were present at most of the 5th- and 6th-century synods.  Three more dioceses in Beth Aramaye are mentioned in the acts of the later synods:  Piroz Shabur (first mentioned in 486); Tirhan (first mentioned in 544); and Shenna d'Beth Ramman or Qardaliabad (first mentioned in 576).  All three dioceses were to have a long history.\n\n====Province of Beth Huzaye (Elam)====\n{{main|Beth Huzaye (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nThe metropolitan of Beth Huzaye (\u02bfIlam or Elam), who resided in the town of Beth Lapat (Veh az Andiokh Shapur), enjoyed the right of consecrating a new patriarch.   In 410 it was not possible to appoint a metropolitan for Beth Huzaye, as several bishops of Beth Lapat were competing for precedence and the synod declined to choose between them.<ref name=\"Chabot, 272\u20133\">Chabot, 272\u20133</ref>  Instead, it merely laid down that once it became possible to appoint a metropolitan, he would have jurisdiction over the dioceses of Karka d'Ledan, Hormizd Ardashir, Shushter (Shushtra, {{lang|syr|\u072b\u0718\u072b\u071b\u072a\u0710}}) and Susa (Shush, {{lang|syr|\u072b\u0718\u072b}}).  These dioceses were all founded at least a century earlier, and their bishops were present at most of the synods of the 5th and 6th centuries.  A bishop of Ispahan was present at the synod of Dadisho\u02bf in 424, and by 576 there were also dioceses for [[Mihraganqadaq]] (probably the 'Beth Mihraqaye' included in the title of the diocese of Ispahan in 497) and Ram Hormizd (Ramiz).\n\n====Province of Nisibis====\n{{main|Nisibis (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nIn 363 the Roman emperor [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] was obliged to cede Nisibis and five neighbouring districts to Persia to extricate the defeated army of his predecessor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] from Persian territory.   The Nisibis region, after nearly fifty years of rule by [[Constantine I|Constantine]] and his Christian successors, may well have contained more Christians than the entire [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian empire]], and this Christian population was absorbed into the Church of the East in a single generation.  The impact of the cession of Nisibis on the demography of the Church of the East was so marked that the province of Nisibis was ranked second among the five metropolitan provinces established at the synod of Isaac in 410, a precedence apparently conceded without dispute by the bishops of the three older Persian provinces relegated to a lower rank.\n\nThe bishop of Nisibis was recognised in 410 as the metropolitan of Arzun ({{lang|syr|\u0710\u072a\u0719\u0718\u0722}}), Qardu ({{lang|syr|\u0729\u072a\u0715\u0718}}), Beth Zabda\u00ef ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0719\u0712\u0715\u071d}}), Beth Rahima\u00ef ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u072a\u071a\u0721\u071d}}) and Beth Moksaye ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0721\u0718\u071f\u0723\u071d\u0710}}).  These were the Syriac names for Arzanene, Corduene, Zabdicene, Rehimene and Moxoene, the five districts ceded by Rome to Persia in 363.<ref name=\"Chabot, 272\u20133\"/>  The metropolitan diocese of Nisibis ({{lang|syr|\u0722\u0728\u071d\u0712\u071d\u0722}}) and the suffragan dioceses of Arzun, Qardu and Beth Zabda\u00ef were to enjoy a long history, but Beth Rahima\u00ef is not mentioned again, while Beth Moksaye is not mentioned after 424, when its bishop Atticus (probably, from his name, a Roman) subscribed to the acts of the synod of Dadisho\u02bf.  Besides the bishop of Arzun, a bishop of 'Aoustan d\u2019Arzun' (plausibly identified with the district of Ingilene) also attended these two synods, and his diocese was also assigned to the province of Nisibis.  The diocese of Aoustan d'Arzun survived into the 6th century, but is not mentioned after 554.\n\nDuring the 5th and 6th centuries three new dioceses in the province of Nisibis were founded in Persian territory, in Beth \u02bfArabaye (the hinterland of Nisibis, between Mosul and the Tigris and Khabur rivers) and in the hill country to the northeast of Arzun.  By 497 a diocese had been established at Balad (the modern Eski Mosul) on the Tigris, which persisted into the 14th century.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 57\u20138</ref>  By 563 there was also a diocese for Shigar (Sinjar), deep inside Beth \u02bfArabaye, and by 585 a diocese for Kartwaye, the country to the west of Lake Van inhabited by the Kartaw Kurds.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 134</ref>\n\nThe famous [[School of Nisibis]] was an important seminary and theological academy of the Church of the East during the late Sassanian period, and in the last two centuries of Sassanian rule generated a remarkable outpouring of East Syriac theological scholarship.\n\n====Province of Maishan====\n{{main|Maishan (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nIn southern Mesopotamia, the bishop of Prath d'Maishan ({{lang|syr|\u0726\u072a\u072c \u0715\u0721\u071d\u072b\u0722}}) became metropolitan of [[Maishan (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Maishan]] ({{lang|syr|\u0721\u071d\u072b\u0722}}) in 410, responsible also for the three suffragan dioceses of Karka d'Maishan ({{lang|syr|\u071f\u072a\u071f\u0710 \u0715\u0721\u071d\u072b\u0722}}), Rima ({{lang|syr|\u072a\u071d\u0721\u0710}}) and Nahargur ({{lang|syr|\u0722\u0717\u072a\u0713\u0718\u072a}}).  The bishops of these four dioceses attended most of the synods of the 5th and 6th centuries.<ref>Chabot, 272\u20133; Fiey, ''POCN'', 59\u201360, 100, 114 and 125\u20136</ref>\n\n====Province of Adiabene====\n{{main|Adiabene (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\n[[Image:Citadel (old city) of Hewl\u00ear (Erbil).jpg|thumb|right|230px| The [[citadel of Erbil]], chief town in the East Syriac metropolitan province of Adiabene]]\nThe bishop of Erbil became metropolitan of Adiabene in 410, responsible also for the six suffragan dioceses of Beth Nuhadra ({{lang|syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0722\u0718\u0717\u0715\u072a\u0710}}), Beth Bgash, Beth Dasen, Ramonin, Beth Mahqart and Dabarin.<ref name=\"Chabot, 272\u20133\"/>  Bishops of the dioceses of Beth Nuhadra, Beth Bgash and Beth Dasen, which covered the modern \u02bfAmadiya and Hakkari regions, were present at most of the early synods, and these three dioceses continued without interruption into the 13th century.  The other three dioceses are not mentioned again, and have been tentatively identified with three dioceses better known under other names:  Ramonin with Shenna d'Beth Ramman in Beth Aramaye, on the Tigris near its junction with the [[Great Zab]]; Beth Mahrqart with Beth Qardu in the Nisibis region, across the Tigris from the district of Beth Zabda\u00ef; and Dabarin with Tirhan, a district of Beth Aramaye which lay between the Tigris and the Jabal \u1e24amrin, to the southwest of Beth Garma\u00ef.\n\nBy the middle of the 6th century there were also dioceses in the province of Adiabene for Ma\u02bfaltha ({{lang|syr|\u0721\u0725\u0720\u072c\u0710}}) or Ma\u02bfalthaya ({{lang|syr|\u0721\u0725\u0720\u072c\u071d\u0710}}), a town in the Hnitha ({{lang|syr|\u071a\u0722\u071d\u072c\u0710}}) or Zibar district to the east of \u02bfAqra, and for Nineveh.  The diocese of Ma\u02bfaltha is first mentioned in 497, and the diocese of Nineveh in 554, and bishops of both dioceses attended most of the later synods.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 106 and 115\u201316</ref>\n\n====Province of Beth Garma\u00ef====\n{{main|Beth Garma\u00ef (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nThe bishop of Karka d'Beth Slokh ({{lang|syr|\u071f\u072a\u071f\u0710 \u0715\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0723\u0720\u0718\u071f}}, modern Kirkuk) became metropolitan of Beth Garma\u00ef, responsible also for the five suffragan dioceses of Shahrgard, Lashom ({{lang|syr|\u0720\u072b\u0718\u0721}}), Mahoze d'Arewan ({{lang|syr|\u0721\u071a\u0718\u0719\u0710 \u0715\u0710\u072a\u071d\u0718\u0722}}), Radani and Hrbath Glal ({{lang|syr|\u071a\u072a\u0712\u072c\u0713\u0720\u0720}}).  Bishops from these five dioceses are found at most of the synods in the 5th and 6th centuries.<ref name=\"Chabot, 272\u20133\"/>  Two other dioceses also existed in the Beth Garma\u00ef district in the 5th century which do not appear to have been under the jurisdiction of its metropolitan.  A diocese existed at Tahal as early as 420, which seems to have been an independent diocese until just before the end of the 6th century, and bishops of the Karme district on the west bank of the Tigris around Tagrit, in later centuries a West Syrian stronghold, were present at the synods  of 486 and 554.\n\n====Unlocalised dioceses====\nSeveral dioceses mentioned in the acts of the early synods cannot be convincingly localised.  A bishop Ardaq of 'Mashkena d'Qurdu' was present at the synod of Dadisho\u02bf in 424, a bishop Mushe of 'Hamir' at the synod of Acacius in 486, bishops of 'Barhis' at the synods of 544, 576 and 605, and a bishop of \u02bfA\u00efn Sipne at the synod of Ezekiel in 576.  Given the personal attendance of their bishops at these synods, these dioceses were probably in Mesopotamia rather than the exterior provinces.<ref>Chabot, 285, 344\u20135, 368 and 479</ref>\n\n===Exterior provinces===\nCanon XXI of the synod of 410 provided that 'the bishops of the more remote dioceses of Fars, the Islands, Beth Madaye [Media], Beth Raziqaye [Rai] and also the country of Abrashahr [Nishapur], must later accept the definition established in this council'.<ref name=\"Chabot, 273\"/>  This reference demonstrates that the influence of the Church of the East in the 5th century had extended beyond the non-Iranian fringes of the Sassanian empire to include several districts within Iran itself, and had also spread southwards to the islands off the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf, which were under Sassanian control at this period.  By the middle of the 6th century the Church's reach seems to have spread well beyond the frontiers of the Sassanian empire, as a passage in the acts of the synod of Aba I in 544 refers to East Syriac communities 'in every district and every town throughout the territory of the Persian empire, in the rest of the East, and in the neighbouring countries'.<ref>Chabot, 320\u20131</ref>\n\n====Fars and Arabia====\n{{main|Fars (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nThere were at least eight dioceses in Fars and the islands of the Persian Gulf in the 5th century, and probably eleven or more by the end of the Sassanian period.  In Fars the diocese of Rev Ardashir is first mentioned in 420, the dioceses of Ardashir Khurrah (Shiraf), Darabgard, Istakhr, and Kazrun (Shapur or Bih Shapur) in 424, and a diocese of Qish in 540.  On the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf dioceses are first mentioned for Dairin and Mashmahig in 410 and for Beth Mazunaye (Oman) in 424.  By 540 the bishop of Rev Ardashir had become a metropolitan, responsible for the dioceses of both Fars and Arabia.  A fourth Arabian diocese, Hagar, is first mentioned in 576, and a fifth diocese, Hatta (previously part of the diocese of Hagar), is first mentioned in the acts of a regional synod held on the Persian Gulf island of Dairin in 676 by the patriarch Giwargis to determine the episcopal succession in Beth Qatraye, but may have been created before the Arab conquest.\n\n====Khorasan and Segestan====\n{{main|Merv (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nAn East Syriac diocese for Abrashahr (Nishapur) evidently existed by the beginning of the 5th century, though it was not assigned to a metropolitan province in 410.<ref name=\"Chabot, 273\"/>  Three more East Syriac dioceses in Khorasan and Segestan are attested a few years later.  The bishops Bar Shaba of [[Merv]], David of Abrashahr, Yazdo\u00ef of Herat and Aphrid of Segestan were present at the synod of Dadisho\u02bf in 424.<ref>Chabot, 285</ref>  The uncommon name of the bishop of Merv, Bar Shaba, means 'son of the deportation', suggesting that [[Merv]]'s Christian community may have been deported from Roman territory.\n\nThe diocese of Segestan, whose bishop probably sat at Zarang, was disputed during the schism of Narsa\u00ef and Elisha\u02bf in the 520s.  The patriarch Aba I resolved the dispute in 544 by temporarily dividing the diocese, assigning Zarang, Farah and Qash to the bishop Yazdaphrid and Bist and Rukut to the bishop Sargis.  He ordered that the diocese should be reunited as soon as one of these bishops died.<ref>Chabot, 339-45</ref>\n\nThe Christian population of the Merv region seems to have increased during the 6th century, as the bishop of [[Merv]] was recognised as a metropolitan at the synod of Joseph in 554 and Herat also became a metropolitan diocese shortly afterwards.  The first known metropolitan of Herat was present at the synod of Isho\u02bfyahb I in 585.  The growing importance of the Merv region for the Church of the East is also attested by the appearance of several more Christian centres during the late 5th and 6th century.  By the end of the 5th century the diocese of Abrashahr (Nishapur) also included the city of Tus, whose name featured in 497 in the title of the bishop Yohannis of 'Tus and Abrashahr'.  Four more dioceses seem also to have been created in the 6th century.  The bishops Yohannan of 'Abiward and Shahr Peroz' and Theodore of Merw-i Rud accepted the acts of the synod of Joseph in 554, the latter by letter, while the bishops Habib of Pusang and Gabriel of 'Badisi and Qadistan' adhered by proxy to the decisions of the synod of Isho\u02bfyahb I in 585, sending deacons to represent them.<ref>Chabot, 366 and 423</ref>  None of these four dioceses is mentioned again, and it is not clear when they lapsed.\n\n====Media====\n{{main|Hulwan (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nBy the end of the 5th century there were at least three East Syriac dioceses in the Sassanian province of Media in western Iran.  Canon XXI of the synod of Isaac in 410 foreshadowed the extension of the metropolitan principle to the bishops of Beth Madaye and other relatively remote regions.<ref name=\"Chabot, 273\"/>  [[Hamadan]] (ancient Ecbatana) was the chief city of Media, and the Syriac name Beth Madaye (Media) was regularly used to refer to the East Syriac diocese of Hamadan as well as to the region as a whole.  Although no East Syriac bishops of Beth Madaye are attested before 457, this reference probably indicates that the diocese of Hamadan was already in existence in 410.  Bishops of Beth Madaye were present at most of the synods held between 486 and 605.<ref>Chabot, 306, 316, 366 and 479</ref>  Two other dioceses in western Iran, Beth Lashpar (Hulwan) and Masabadan, seem also to have been established in the 5th century.  A bishop of 'the deportation of Beth Lashpar' was present at the synod of Dadisho\u02bf in 424, and bishops of Beth Lashpar also attended the later synods of the 5th and 6th centuries.<ref>Chabot, 285, 287, 307, 315, 366, 368, 423 and 479</ref>  Bishops of the nearby locality of Masabadan were present at the synod of Joseph in 554 and the synod of Ezekiel in 576.<ref>Chabot, 366 and 368</ref>\n\n====Rai and Tabaristan====\n{{main|Rai (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nIn Tabaristan (northern Iran), the diocese of Rai (Beth Raziqaye) is first mentioned in 410, and seems to have had a fairly uninterrupted succession of bishops for the next six and a half centuries.  Bishops of Rai are first attested in 424 and last mentioned towards the end of the 11th century.<ref>Fiey, ''M\u00e9die chr\u00e9tienne'', 378\u201382; ''POCN'', 124</ref>\n\nAn East Syriac diocese was established in the Sassanian province of Gurgan (Hyrcania) to the southeast of the Caspian Sea in the 5th century for a community of Christians deported from Roman territory.<ref>Fiey, POCN, 85\u20136</ref>  The bishop Domitian 'of the deportation of Gurgan', evidently from his name a Roman, was present at the synod of Dadisho\u02bf in 424, and three other 5th- and 6th-century bishops of Gurgan attended the later synods, the last of whom, Za\u02bfura, was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Ezekiel in 576.<ref>Chabot, 285, 315, 328 and 368</ref>  The bishops of Gurgan probably sat in the provincial capital [[Astarabad]].<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 85\u20136</ref>\n\n====Adarbaigan and Gilan====\nBishops of the diocese of 'Adarbaigan' were present at most of the synods between 486 and 605.  The diocese of Adarbaigan appears to have covered the territory included within the Sassanian province of Atropatene.  It was bounded on the west by the Salmas and Urmi plains to the west of Lake Urmi and to the south by the diocese of Salakh in the province of Adiabene.  Its centre seems to have been the town of [[Ganzak]].  The diocese of Adarbaigan was not assigned to a metropolitan province in 410, and may have remained independent throughout the Sassanian period.  By the end of the 8th century, however, Adarbaigan was a suffragan diocese in the province of Adiabene.<ref>Fiey, POCN, 81\u20132</ref>\n\nAn East Syriac diocese for Paidangaran (modern [[Beylagan (city)|Baylaqan]]) is attested during the 6th century, but only two of its bishops are known.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 119</ref>  The bishop Yohannan of Paidangaran, first mentioned in 540, adhered to the acts of the synod of Mar Aba I in 544.<ref>Chabot, 328 and 344\u20135</ref>  The bishop Ya\u02bfqob of Paidangaran was present at the synod of Joseph in 544.<ref>Chabot, 366</ref>\n\nThe bishop Surin of 'Amol and Gilan' was present at the synod of Joseph in 554.<ref>Fiey, POCN, 82\u20133</ref>\n\n==Umayyad and Abbasid periods==\n[[Image:ES Exterior Provinces.jpg|thumb|300px|The mission field of the Church of the East, c. 800]]\nA good starting point for a discussion of the diocesan organisation of the Church of the East after the Arab conquest is a list of fifteen contemporary East Syriac 'eparchies' or ecclesiastical provinces compiled in 893 by the metropolitan Eliya of Damascus.   The list (in Arabic) included the province of the patriarch and fourteen metropolitan provinces:  Jundishabur (Beth Huzaye), Nisibin (Nisibis), al-Basra (Maishan), al-Mawsil ([[Mosul]]), Bajarmi (Beth Garma\u00ef), al-Sham (Damascus), al-Ray (Rai), Hara (Herat), Maru ([[Merv]]), Armenia, Qand (Samarqand), Fars, Barda\u02bfa and Hulwan.<ref name=\"Assemani, BO, ii. 485\u20139\"/>\n\nAn important source for the ecclesiastical organisation of the Church of the East in the 12th century is a collection of canons, attributed to the patriarch Eliya III (1176\u201390), for the consecration of bishops, metropolitans and patriarchs.   Included in the canons is what appears to be a contemporary list of twenty-five East Syriac dioceses, in the following order:  (a) Nisibis; (b) Mardin; (c) Amid and [[Maiperqat]]; (d) [[Singara]]; (e) [[Beth Zabda\u00ef]]; (f) Erbil; (g) Beth Waziq; (h) Athor [Mosul]; (i) Balad; (j) Marga; (k) Kfar Zamre; (l) Fars and Kirman; (m) Hindaye and Qatraye (India and northern Arabia); (n) [[Arzun]] and Beth Dlish ([[Bidlis]]); (o) [[Hamadan]]; (p) Halah; (q) [[Urmia|Urmi]]; (r) Halat, Van and Wastan; (s) Najran; (t) Kashkar; (u) Shenna d'Beth Ramman; (v) Nevaketh; (w) Soqotra; (x) Pushtadar; and (y) the Islands of the Sea.<ref>MS Cambridge Add. 1988</ref>\n\nThere are some obvious omissions from this list, notably a number of dioceses in the province of Mosul, but it is probably legitimate to conclude that all the dioceses mentioned in the list were still in existence in the last quarter of the 12th century.  If so, the list has some interesting surprises, such as the survival of dioceses for Fars and Kirman and for Najran at this late date.  The mention of the diocese of Kfar Zamre near Balad, attested only once before, in 790, is another surprise, as is the mention of a diocese for Pushtadar in Persia.  However, there is no need to doubt the authenticity of the list.  Its mention of dioceses for Nevaketh and the Islands of the Sea have a convincing topicality.\n\n===Interior provinces===\n\n====Province of the Patriarch====\n{{main|Province of the Patriarch}}\n[[File:Church of the East provinces 10 c.svg|thumb|500px|Ecclesiastical provinces of the Church of the East in the 10th century]]\nAccording to Eliya of Damascus, there were thirteen dioceses in the province of the patriarch in 893:  Kashkar, al-Tirhan, Dair Hazql (an alternative name for al-Nu\u02bfmaniya, the chief town in the diocese of Zabe), al-Hira (Hirta), al-Anbar (Piroz Shabur), al-Sin (Shenna d\u2019Beth Ramman), \u02bfUkbara, [[R\u0101dh\u0101n|al-Radhan]], Nifr, al-Qasra, 'Ba Daraya and Ba Kusaya' (Beth Daraye), \u02bfAbdasi (Nahargur), and al-Buwazikh (Konishabur or Beth Waziq).   Eight of these dioceses already existed in the Sassanian period, but the diocese of Beth Waziq is first mentioned in the second half of the 7th century, and the dioceses of \u02bfUkbara, al-Radhan, Nifr, and al-Qasra were probably founded in the 9th century.  The first bishop of \u02bfUkbara whose name has been recorded, Hakima, was consecrated by the patriarch Sargis around 870, and bishops of al-Qasra, al-Radhan and Nifr are first mentioned in the 10th century.  A bishop of 'al-Qasr and Nahrawan' became patriarch in 963, and then consecrated bishops for al-Radhan and for 'Nifr and al-Nil'.  Eliya's list helps to confirm the impression given by the literary sources, that the East Syriac communities in Beth Aramaye were at their most prosperous in the 10th century.\n\nA partial list of bishops present at the consecration of the patriarch Yohannan IV in 900 included several bishops from the province of the patriarch, including the bishops of Zabe and Beth Daraye and also the bishops Isho\u02bfzkha of 'the Gubeans', Hnanisho\u02bf of Delasar, Quriaqos of Meskene and Yohannan 'of the Jews'.  The last four dioceses are not mentioned elsewhere and cannot be satisfactorily localised.<ref name=\"MS Paris BN Syr 354, folio 147\"/>\n\nIn the 11th century decline began to set in.  The diocese of Hirta (al-Hira) came to an end, and four other dioceses were combined into two:  Nifr and al-Nil with Zabe (al-Zawabi and al-Nu\u02bfmaniya), and Beth Waziq (al-Buwazikh) with Shenna d'Beth Ramman (al-Sin).  Three more dioceses ceased to exist in the 12th century.  The dioceses of Piroz Shabur (al-Anbar) and Qasr and Nahrawan are last mentioned in 1111, and the senior diocese of [[Kashkar (East Syrian Diocese)|Kashkar]] in 1176.  By the patriarchal election of 1222 the guardianship of the vacant patriarchal throne, the traditional privilege of the bishop of Kashkar, had passed to the metropolitans of \u02bfIlam.  The trend of decline continued in the 13th century.  The diocese of Zabe and Nil is last mentioned during the reign of Yahballaha II (1190\u20131222), and the diocese of \u02bfUkbara in 1222.  Only three dioceses are known to have been still in existence at the end of the 13th century: Beth Waziq and Shenna, Beth Daron (Ba Daron), and (perhaps due to its sheltered position between the Tigris and the Jabal Hamrin) Tirhan.  However, East Syriac communities may also have persisted in districts which no longer had bishops: a manuscript of 1276 was copied by a monk named Giwargis at the monastery of Mar Yonan 'on the Euphrates, near Piroz Shabur which is Anbar', nearly a century and a half after the last mention of a bishop of Anbar.<ref>MS Harvard Syr 27</ref>\n\n====Province of Elam====\n{{main|Beth Huzaye (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nOf the seven suffragan dioceses attested in the province of Beth Huzaye in 576, only four were still in existence at the end of the 9th century.  The diocese of Ram Hormizd seems to have lapsed, and the dioceses of Karka d'Ledan and Mihrganqadaq had been combined with the dioceses of Susa and Ispahan respectively.  In 893 Eliya of Damascus listed four suffragan dioceses in the 'eparchy of Jundishapur', in the following order:    Karkh Ladan and al-Sus (Susa and Karha d'Ledan), al-Ahwaz (Hormizd Ardashir), Tesr (Shushter) and Mihrganqadaq (Ispahan and Mihraganqadaq).<ref name=\"Assemani, BO, ii. 485\u20139\"/>  It is doubtful whether any of these dioceses survived into the 14th century.  The diocese of Shushter is last mentioned in 1007/8, Hormizd Ardashir in 1012, Ispahan in 1111 and Susa in 1281.  Only the metropolitan diocese of Jundishapur certainly survived into the 14th century, and with additional prestige.  \u02bfIlam had for centuries ranked first among the metropolitan provinces of the Church of the East, and its metropolitan enjoyed the privilege of consecrating a new patriarch and sitting on his right hand at synods.  By 1222, in consequence of the demise of the diocese of Kashkar in the province of the patriarch, he had also acquired the privilege of guarding the vacant patriarchal throne.\n\nThe East Syriac author \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf of Nisibis, writing around the end of the 13th century, mentions the bishop Gabriel of Shahpur Khwast (modern Hurremabad), who perhaps flourished during the 10th century.  From its geographical location, Shahpur Khwast might have been a diocese in the province of \u02bfIlam, but it is not mentioned in any other source.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 131</ref>\n\n====Province of Nisibis====\n{{main|Nisibis (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nThe metropolitan province of Nisibis had a number of suffragan dioceses at different periods, including the dioceses of Arzun, Beth Rahima\u00ef, Beth Qardu (later renamed Tamanon), Beth Zabda\u00ef, Qube d\u2019Arzun, Balad, Shigar (Sinjar), Armenia, Harran and Callinicus (Raqqa), Maiperqat (with Amid and Mardin), Resh\u02bfa\u00efna, and Qarta and Adarma.\n\nProbably during the Ummayad period, the East Syriac diocese of Armenia was attached to the province of Nisibis.  The bishop Artashahr of Armenia was present at the synod of Dadisho\u02bf in 424, but the diocese was not assigned to a metropolitan province.  In the late 13th century Armenia was certainly a suffragan diocese of the province of Nisibis, and its dependency probably went back to the 7th or 8th century.  The bishops of Armenia appear to have sat at the town of Halat (Ahlat) on the northern shore of [[Lake Van]].\n\nThe Arab conquest allowed the East Syriacs to move into western Mesopotamia and establish communities in Damascus and other towns that had formerly been in Roman territory, where they lived alongside much larger Syrian Orthodox, Armenian and Melkite communities.  Some of these western communities were placed under the jurisdiction of the East Syriac metropolitans of Damascus, but others were attached to the province of Nisibis.   The latter included a diocese for Harran and Callinicus (Raqqa), first attested in the 8th century and last mentioned towards the end of the 11th century, and a diocese at Maiperqat, first mentioned at the end of the 11th century, whose bishops were also responsible for the East Syriac communities in Amid and Mardin.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 49\u201350 and 88</ref>  Lists of dioceses in the province of Nisibis during the 11th and 13th centuries also mention a diocese for the Syrian town of Resh\u02bfa\u00efna (Ra\u02bfs al-{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Ain).  Resh\u02bfa\u00efna is a plausible location for an East Syriac diocese at this period, but none of its bishops are known.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 124</ref>\n\n====Province of Maishan====\n{{main|Maishan (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nThe province of Maishan seems to have come to an end in the 13th century.   The metropolitan diocese of Prath d\u2019Maishan is last mentioned in 1222, and the suffragan dioceses of Nahargur (\u02bfAbdasi), Karka d'Maishan (Dastumisan), and Rima (Nahr al-Dayr) probably ceased to exist rather earlier.  The diocese of Nahargur is last mentioned at the end of the 9th century, in the list of Eliya of Damascus.  The last-known bishop of Karka d'Maishan, Abraham, was present at the synod held by the patriarch Yohannan IV shortly after his election in 900, and an unnamed bishop of Rima attended the consecration of [[Eliya I]] in Baghdad in 1028.<ref name=\"Fiey, AC, iii. 272\u201382\">Fiey, ''AC'', iii. 272\u201382</ref>\n\n====Provinces of Mosul and Erbil====\n{{see also|Adiabene (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nErbil, the chief town of Adiabene, lost much of its former importance with the growth of the city of Mosul, and during the reign of the patriarch Timothy I (780\u2013823) the seat of the metropolitans of Adiabene was moved to Mosul.  The dioceses of Adiabene were governed by a 'metropolitan of Mosul and Erbil' for the next four and a half centuries.  Around 1200, Mosul and Erbil became separate metropolitan provinces.  The last known metropolitan of Mosul and Erbil was Tittos, who was appointed by Eliya III (1175\u201389).  Thereafter separate metropolitan bishops for Mosul and for Erbil are recorded in a fairly complete series from 1210 to 1318.\n\nFive new dioceses in the province of Mosul and Erbil were established during the Ummayad and \u02bfAbbasid periods: Marga, Salakh, Haditha, Taimana and Hebton.  The dioceses of Marga and Salakh, covering the districts around \u02bfAmadiya and \u02bfAqra, are first mentioned in the 8th century but may have been created earlier, perhaps in response to West Syrian competition in the Mosul region in the 7th century.   The diocese of Marga persisted into the 14th century, but the diocese of Salakh is last mentioned in the 9th century.  By the 8th century there was also an East Syriac diocese for the town of [[Hdatta]] (Haditha) on the Tigris, which persisted into the 14th century.  The diocese of Taimana, which embraced the district south of the Tigris in the vicinity of Mosul and included the monastery of Mar Mikha'il, is attested between the 8th and 10th centuries, but does not seem to have persisted into the 13th century.<ref>Fiey, ''AC'', ii. 336\u20137; and ''POCN'', 137</ref>\n\nA number of East Syriac bishops are attested between the 8th and 13th centuries for the diocese of Hebton, a region of northwest Adiabene to the south of the Great Zab, adjacent to the district of Marga.  It is not clear when the diocese was created, but it is first mentioned under the name 'Hnitha and Hebton' in 790.  Hnitha was another name for the diocese of Ma\u02bfaltha, and the patriarch Timothy I is said to have united the dioceses of Hebton and \u1e24nitha in order to punish the presumption of the bishop Rustam of Hnitha, who had opposed his election.  The union was not permanent, and by the 11th century Hebton and Ma\u02bfaltha were again separate dioceses.\n\nBy the middle of the 8th century the diocese of [[Adarbaigan (East Syrian Diocese)|Adarbaigan]], formerly independent, was a suffragan diocese of the province of Adiabene.<ref>Wallis Budge, ''Book of Governors'', ii. 315\u201316</ref>\n\n====Province of Beth Garma\u00ef====\n{{main|Beth Garma\u00ef (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nIn its heyday, at the end of the 6th century, there were at least nine dioceses in the province of Beth Garma\u00ef.   As in Beth Aramaye, the Christian population of Beth Garma\u00ef began to fall in the first centuries of Moslem rule, and the province's decline is reflected in the forced relocation of the metropolis from Karka d'Beth Slokh (Kirkuk) in the 9th century and the gradual disappearance of all of the province's suffragan dioceses between the 7th and 12th centuries.  The dioceses of Hrbath Glal and Barhis are last mentioned in 605; Mahoze d\u2019Arewan around 650; Karka d\u2019Beth Slokh around 830; Khanijar in 893; Lashom around 895; Tahal around 900; Shahrgard in 1019; and Shahrzur around 1134.  By the beginning of the 14th century the metropolitan of Beth Garma\u00ef, who now sat at Daquqa, was the only remaining bishop in this once-flourishing province.\n\n===Exterior provinces===\n\n==== Fars and Arabia ====\n{{see also|Fars (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nAt the beginning of the 7th century there were  several dioceses in the province of Fars and its dependencies in northern Arabia (Beth Qatraye).  Fars was marked out by its Arab conquerors for a thoroughgoing process of islamicisation, and Christianity declined more rapidly in this region than in any other part of the former Sassanian empire.  The last-known bishop of the metropolitan see of Rev Ardashir was \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf, who was present at the enthronement of the patriarch \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf III in 1138.  In 890 Eliya of Damascus listed the suffragan sees of Fars, in order of seniority, as Shiraz, Istakhr, Shapur (probably to be identified with Bih Shapur, i.e. Kazrun), Karman, Darabgard, Shiraf (Ardashir Khurrah), Marmadit, and the island of Soqotra.  Only two bishops are known from the mainland dioceses:  Melek of Darabgard, who was deposed in the 560s, and Gabriel of Bih Shapur, who was present at the enthronement of \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf I in 963.  Fars was spared by the Mongols for its timely submission in the 1220s, but by then there seem to have been few Christians left, although an East Syriac community (probably without bishops) survived at Hormuz.  This community is last mentioned in the 16th century.\n\nOf the northern Arabian dioceses, Mashmahig is last mentioned around 650, and Dairin, Oman (Beth Mazunaye), Hajar and Hatta in 676.  [[Socotra|Soqotra]] remained an isolated outpost of Christianity in the Arabian sea, and its bishop attended the enthronement of the patriarch [[Yaballaha III|Yahballaha III]] in 1281.  Marco Polo visited the island in the 1280s, and claimed that it had an East Syriac archbishop, with a suffragan bishop on the nearby 'Island of Males'.  In a casual testimony to the impressive geographical extension of the Church of the East in the \u02bfAbbasid period, [[Thomas of Marga]] mentions that Yemen and Sana\u02bfa had a bishop named Peter during the reign of the patriarch Abraham II (837\u201350) who had earlier served in China.  This diocese is not mentioned again.\n\n====Khorasan and Segestan====\n{{see also|Merv (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nTimothy I consecrated a metropolitan named Hnanisho\u02bf for Sarbaz in the 790s.  This diocese is not mentioned again.  In 893 Eliya of Damascus recorded that the metropolitan province of Merv had suffragan sees at 'Dair Hans', 'Damadut', and 'Da\u02bfbar Sanai', three districts whose locations are entirely unknown.\n\nBy the 11th century East Syriac Christianity was in decline in Khorasan and Segestan.  The last-known metropolitan of Merv was \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf, who was consecrated by the patriarch Mari (987\u20131000).  The last-known metropolitan of Herat was Giwargis, who flourished in the reign of Sabrisho\u02bf III (1064\u201372).  If any of the suffragan dioceses were still in existence at this period, they are not mentioned.  The surviving urban Christian communities in Khorasan suffered a heavy blow at the start of the 13th century, when the cities of Merv, Nishapur and Herat were stormed by Genghis Khan in 1220.  Their inhabitants were massacred, and although all three cities were refounded shortly afterwards, it is likely that they had only small East Syriac communities thereafter.  Nevertheless, at least one diocese survived into the 13th century.  In 1279 an unnamed bishop of Tus entertained the monks Bar Sawma and Marqos in the monastery of Mar Sehyon near Tus during their pilgrimage from China to Jerusalem.\n\n====Media====\n{{see also|Hulwan (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nIn 893 Eliya of Damascus listed Hulwan as a metropolitan province, with suffragan dioceses for Dinawar (al-Dinur), Hamadan, Nihawand and al-Kuj.<ref name=\"Assemani, BO, ii. 485\u20139\"/>  'Al-Kuj' cannot be readily localised, and has been tentatively identified with Karaj d'Abu Dulaf.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 99</ref>  Little is known about these suffragan dioceses, except for isolated references to bishops of Dinawar and Nihawand, and by the end of the 12th century Hulwan and Hamadan were probably the only surviving centres of East Syriac Christianity in Media.  Around the beginning of the 13th century the metropolitan see of Hulwan was transferred to Hamadan, in consequence of the decline in Hulwan's importance.  The last-known bishop of Hulwan and Hamadan, Yohannan, flourished during the reign of Eliya III (1176\u201390).  Hamadan was sacked in 1220, and during the reign of Yahballaha III was also on more than one occasion the scene of anti-Christian riots.  It is possible that its Christian population at the end of the 13th century was small indeed, and it is not known whether it was still the seat of a metropolitan bishop.\n\n====Rai and Tabaristan====\n{{See also|Rai (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nThe diocese of Rai was raised to metropolitan status in 790 by the patriarch Timothy I.  According to Eliya of Damascus, Gurgan was a suffragan diocese of the province of Rai in 893.  It is doubtful whether either diocese still existed at the end of the 13th century.  The last-known bishop of Rai, {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abd al-Masih, was present at the consecration of {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} II in 1075 as 'metropolitan of Hulwan and Rai', suggesting that the episcopal seat of the bishops of Rai had been transferred to Hulwan.  According to the ''Mukhtasar'' of 1007/08, the diocese of 'Gurgan, Bilad al-Jibal and Dailam' had been suppressed, 'owing to the disappearance of Christianity in the region'.<ref>Fiey ''POCN'', 86</ref>\n\n====Little Armenia====\nThe Arran or Little Armenia district in modern Azerbaijan, with its chief town Barda\u02bfa, was an East Syriac metropolitan province in the 10th and 11th centuries, and represented the northernmost extension of the Church of the East.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 58\u20139</ref>  A manuscript note of 1137 mentions that the diocese of Barda\u02bfa and Armenia no longer existed, and that the responsibilities of its metropolitans had been undertaken by the bishop of Halat.\n\n====Dailam, Gilan and Muqan====\nA major missionary drive was undertaken by the Church of the East in Dailam and Gilan towards the end of the 8th century on the initiative of the patriarch Timothy I (780\u2013823), led by three metropolitans and several suffragan bishops from the monastery of Beth \u02bfAbe.  [[Thomas of Marga]], who gave a detailed account of this mission in the ''Book of Governors'', preserved the names of the East Syriac bishops sent to Dailam:\n\n<blockquote>\nMar Qardagh, Mar Shubhalisho\u02bf and Mar Yahballaha were elected metropolitans of Gilan and of Dailam; and Thomas of Hdod, Zakkai of Beth Mule, Shem Bar Arlaye, Ephrem, Shem\u02bfon, Hnanya and David, who went with them from this monastery, were elected and consecrated bishops of those countries.<ref>Wallis Budge, ''Book of Governors'', ii. 447\u20138</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe metropolitan province of Dailam and Gilan created by Timothy I was transitory.  Moslem missionaries began to convert the Dailam region to Islam in the 9th century, and by the beginning of the 11th century the East Syriac diocese of Dailam, by then united with Gurgan as a suffragan diocese of Rai, no longer existed.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 82\u20133</ref>\n\nTimothy I also consecrated a bishop named Eliya for the Caspian district of Muqan, a diocese not mentioned elsewhere and probably also short-lived.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 113</ref>\n\n====Turkestan====\nIn Central Asia, the patriarch [[Sliba-zkha]] (714\u201328) created a metropolitan province for Samarqand, and a metropolitan of Samarqand is attested in 1018.<ref>[[Elijah of Nisibis]], ''Chronography'' (ed. Brooks), i. 35</ref>  Samarqand surrendered to Genghis Khan in 1220, and although many of its citizens were killed, the city was not destroyed.  Marco Polo mentions an East Syriac community in Samarqand in the 1270s.  [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] (780\u2013823) consecrated a metropolitan for Beth Turkaye, 'the country of the Turks'.  Beth Turkaye has been distinguished from Samarqand by the French scholar Dauvillier, who noted that {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Amr listed the two provinces separately, but may well have been another name for the same province.  Eliya III (1176\u201390) created a metropolitan province for Kashgar and Nevaketh.<ref>Dauvillier, ''Provinces chald\u00e9ennes'', 283\u201391; Fiey, ''POCN'', 128</ref>\n\n====India====\n{{main|India (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\n[[India]], which boasted a substantion East Syriac community at least as early as the 3rd century (the [[Saint Thomas Christians]]), became a metropolitan province of the Church of the East in the 7th century. Although few references to its clergy have survived, the colophon of a manuscript copied in 1301 in the church of Mar Quriaqos in [[Cranganore]] mentions the metropolitan Ya{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}qob of India. The metropolitan seat for India at this period was probably Cranganore, described in this manuscript as 'the royal city', and the main strength of the East Syriac church in India was along the [[Malabar Coast]], where it was when the Portuguese arrived in India at the beginning of the 16th century. There were also East Syriac communities on the east coast, around [[Madras]] and the shrine of Saint Thomas at [[Meliapur]].\n\n====Islands of the Sea====\nAn East Syrian metropolitan province in the \"Islands of the Sea\" existed at some point between the 11th and 14th centuries; this may be a reference to the [[East Indies]]. The patriarch Sabrisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} III (1064\u201372) despatched the metropolitan Hnanisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} of Jerusalem on a visitation to 'the Islands of the Sea'.<ref name=\"Mari, 125 Arabic, 110 Latin\">Mari, 125 (Arabic), 110 (Latin)</ref> These 'Islands of the Sea' may well have been the East Indies, as a list of metropolitan provinces compiled by the East Syriac writer {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} of Nisibis at the beginning of the 14th century includes the province 'of the Islands of the Sea between Dabag, Sin and Masin'.  Sin and Masin appear to refer to northern and southern China respectively, and Dabag to Java, implying that the province covered at least some of the islands of the East Indies.  The memory of this province persisted into the 16th century.  In 1503 the patriarch [[Eliya V]], in response to the request of a delegation from the East Syriac Christians of [[Saint Thomas Christians|Malabar]], also consecrated a number of bishops 'for India and the Islands of the Sea between Dabag, Sin and Masin'.<ref>Dauvillier, ''Provinces chald\u00e9ennes'', 314\u201316</ref>\n\n====China and Tibet====\n{{See also|Church of the East in China}}\n[[File:Nestorians-1-.jpg|thumb|150px|The headpiece of the [[Nestorian Stele]], erected in 781: 'The tablet of the spread of the brilliant teaching of Ta-ch'in [Syria] in China']]\nThe Church of the East is perhaps best known nowadays for its missionary work in [[China]] during the [[Tang Dynasty]]. The first recorded Christian mission to China was led by a Nestorian Christian with the Chinese name [[Alopen]], who arrived in the Chinese capital [[Chang'an]] in 635.<ref>Moule, ''Christians in China before the Year 1550'', 38</ref> In 781 a tablet (commonly known as the [[Nestorian Stele]]) was erected in the grounds of a Christian monastery in the Chinese capital Chang'an by the city's Christian community, displaying a long inscription in Chinese with occasional glosses in Syriac. The inscription described the eventful progress of the Nestorian mission in China since Alopen's arrival.\n\nChina became a [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] province of the Church of the East, under the name [[Beth Sinaye]], in the first quarter of the 8th century. According to the 14th-century writer \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf of Nisibis, the province was established by the patriarch [[Sliba-zkha]] (714\u201328).<ref>Mai, ''Scriptorum Veterum Nova Collectio'', x. 141</ref> Arguing from its position in the list of exterior provinces, which implied an 8th-century foundation, and on grounds of general historical probability, \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf refuted alternative claims that the province of Beth Sinaye had been founded either by the 5th-century patriarch [[Ahha]] (410\u201314) or the 6th-century patriarch [[Shila (Nestorian Patriarch)|Shila]] (503\u201323).<ref>Wilmshurst, ''The Martyred Church'', 123\u20134</ref>\n\nThe [[Nestorian Stele]] inscription was composed in 781 by Adam, 'priest, bishop and ''papash'' of Sinistan', probably the metropolitan of Beth Sinaye, and the inscription also mentions the archdeacons Gigoi of Khumdan [Chang'an] and Gabriel of Sarag [Lo-yang]; Yazdbuzid, 'priest and country-bishop of Khumdan'; Sargis, 'priest and country-bishop'; and the bishop Yohannan. These references confirm that the Church of the East in China had a well-developed hierarchy at the end of the 8th century, with bishops in both northern capitals, and there were probably other dioceses besides Chang'an and Lo-yang. Shortly afterwards Thomas of Marga mentions the monk David of Beth \u02bfAbe, who was metropolitan of Beth Sinaye during the reign of [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] (780\u2013823).  Timothy I is said also to have consecrated a metropolitan for Tibet (Beth Tuptaye), a province not again mentioned. The province of Beth Sinaye is last mentioned in 987 by the Arab writer Abu'l Faraj, who met a Nestorian monk who had recently returned from China, who informed him that 'Christianity was just extinct in China; the native Christians had perished in one way or another; the church which they had used had been destroyed; and there was only one Christian left in the land'.<ref>Wilmshurst, ''The Martyred Church'', 222</ref>\n\n====Syria, Palestine, Cilicia and Egypt====\nAlthough the main East Syriac missionary impetus was eastwards, the Arab conquests paved the way for the establishment of East Syriac communities to the west of the Church's northern Mesopotamian heartland, in Syria, Palestine, Cilicia and Egypt.  [[Damascus]] became the seat of an East Syriac metropolitan around the end of the 8th century, and the province had five suffragan dioceses in 893:  Aleppo, Jerusalem, Mambeg, Mopsuestia, and Tarsus and Malatya.<ref name=\"Assemani, BO, ii. 485\u20139\"/>\n\nAccording to Thomas of Marga, the diocese of Damascus was established in the 7th century as a suffragan diocese in the province of Nisibis.  The earliest known bishop of Damascus, Yohannan, is attested in 630.  His title was 'bishop of the scattered of Damascus', presumably a population of East Syriac refugees displaced by the Roman-Persian Wars.  Damascus was raised to metropolitan status by the patriarch Timothy I (780\u2013823).  In 790 the bishop Shallita of Damascus was still a suffragan bishop.<ref>Chabot, 608.</ref>  Some time after 790 Timothy consecrated the future patriarch Sabrisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} II (831\u20135) as the city's first metropolitan.<ref>Mari, 76 (Arabic), 67\u20138 (Latin)</ref>  Several metropolitans of Damascus are attested between the 9th and 11th centuries, including [[Eliya ibn \u02bfUbaid]], who was consecrated in 893 by the patriarch Yohannan III and bore the title 'metropolitan of Damascus, Jerusalem and the Shore (probably a reference to the East Syriac communities in Cilicia)'.<ref name=\"Sliba, 80 Arabic\">Sliba, 80 (Arabic)</ref>  The last known metropolitan of Damascus, Marqos, was consecrated during the reign of the patriarch {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} II (1074\u201390).<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 72</ref>  It is not clear whether the diocese of Damascus survived into the 12th century.\n\nAlthough little is known about its episcopal succession, the East Syriac diocese of Jerusalem seems to have remained a suffragan diocese in the province of Damascus throughout the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 97\u20138</ref>  The earliest known bishop of Jerusalem was Eliya Ibn {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Ubaid, who was appointed metropolitan of Damascus in 893 by the patriarch Yohannan III.<ref name=\"Sliba, 80 Arabic\"/>  Nearly two centuries later a bishop named Hnanisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} was consecrated for Jerusalem by the patriarch [[Sabrisho III|Sabrisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} III]] (1064\u201372).<ref name=\"Mari, 125 Arabic, 110 Latin\"/>\n\nLittle is known about the diocese of Aleppo, and even less about the dioceses of Mambeg, Mopsuestia, and Tarsus and Malatya.  The literary sources have preserved the name of only one bishop from these regions, Ibn Tubah, who was consecrated for Aleppo by the patriarch [[Sabrisho III|Sabrisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} III]] in 1064.<ref name=\"Mari, 125 Arabic, 110 Latin\"/>\n\nA number of East Syriac bishops of Egypt are attested between the 8th and 11th centuries.  The earliest known bishop, Yohannan, is attested around the beginning of the 8th century.  His successors included Sulaiman, consecrated in error by the patriarch {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} I (983\u20136) and recalled when it was discovered that the diocese already had a bishop; Joseph al-Shirazi, injured during a riot in 996 in which Christian churches in Egypt were attacked; Yohannan of Haditha, consecrated by the patriarch Sabrisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} III in 1064; and Marqos, present at the consecration of the patriarch Makkikha I in 1092.  It is doubtful whether the East Syriac diocese of Egypt survived into the 13th century.<ref>Meinardus, 116\u201321; Fiey, ''POCN'', 78</ref>\n\n==Mongol period==\n{{See also|Christianity among the Mongols}}\nAt the end of the 13th century the Church of the East still extended across Asia to China.  Twenty-two bishops were present at the consecration of [[Yaballaha III|Yahballaha III]] in 1281, and while most of them were from the dioceses of northern Mesopotamia, the metropolitans of Jerusalem, {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Ilam, and Tangut (northwest China), and the bishops of Susa and the island of Soqotra were also present.  During their journey from China to Baghdad in 1279, Yahballaha and Bar Sawma were offered hospitality by an unnamed bishop of Tus in northeastern Persia, confirming that there was still a Christian community in Khorasan, however reduced.  India had a metropolitan named Ya{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}qob at the beginning of the 14th century, mentioned together with the patriarch [[Yaballaha III|Yahballaha]] 'the fifth (''sic''), the Turk' in a colophon of 1301.   In the 1320s [[Yaballaha III|Yahballaha]]'s biographer praised the progress made by the Church of the East in converting the 'Indians, Chinese and Turks', without suggesting that this achievement was under threat.<ref>Wallis Budge, ''The Monks of Kublai Khan'', 122\u20133</ref>  In 1348 {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Amr listed twenty-seven metropolitan provinces stretching from Jerusalem to China, and although his list may be anachronistic in several respects, he was surely accurate in portraying a church whose horizons still stretched far beyond Kurdistan.    The provincial structure of the church in 1318 was much the same as it had been when it was established in 410 at the synod of Isaac, and many of the 14th-century dioceses had existed, though perhaps under a different name, nine hundred years earlier.\n\n===Interior provinces===\nAt the same time, however, significant changes had taken place which were only partially reflected in the organisational structure of the church.  Between the 7th and 14th centuries Christianity gradually disappeared in southern and central Iraq (the ecclesiastical provinces of Maishan, Beth Aramaye and Beth Garma\u00ef).  There were twelve dioceses in the patriarchal province of Beth Aramaye at the beginning of the 11th century, only three of which (Beth Waziq, Beth Daron, and Tirhan, all well to the north of Baghdad) survived into the 14th century.<ref>Fiey, ''AC'', iii. 151\u2013262</ref>  There were four dioceses in Maishan (the Basra district) at the end of the 9th century, only one of which (the metropolitan diocese of Prath d\u2019Maishan) survived into the 13th century, to be mentioned for the last time in 1222.<ref name=\"Fiey, AC, iii. 272\u201382\"/>  There were at least nine dioceses in the province of Beth Garma\u00ef in the 7th century, only one of which (the metropolitan diocese of Daquqa) survived into the 14th century.<ref>Fiey, ''AC'', iii. 54\u2013146</ref>  The disappearance of these dioceses was a slow and apparently peaceful process (which can be traced in some detail in Beth Aramaye, where dioceses were repeatedly amalgamated over a period of two centuries), and it is probable that the consolidation of Islam in these districts was accompanied by a gradual migration of East Syriac Christians to northern Iraq, whose Christian population was larger and more deeply rooted, not only in the towns but in hundreds of long-established Christian villages.\n\nBy the end of the 13th century, although isolated East Syriac outposts persisted to the southeast of the Great Zab, the districts of northern Mesopotamia included in the metropolitan provinces of Mosul and Nisibis were clearly regarded as the heartland of the Church of the East.  When the monks Bar Sawma and Marqos (the future patriarch Yahballaha III) arrived in Mesopotamia from China in the late 1270s, they visited several East Syriac monasteries and churches:\n\n<blockquote>\nThey arrived in Baghdad, and from there they went to the great church of Kokhe, and to the monastery of Mar Mari the apostle, and received a blessing from the relics of that country.  And from there they turned back and came to the country of Beth Garma\u00ef, and they received blessings from the shrine of Mar Ezekiel, which was full of helps and healings.  And from there they went to Erbil, and from there to Mosul.  And they went to Shigar, and Nisibis and Mardin, and were blessed by the shrine containing the bones of Mar Awgin, the second Christ.  And from there they went to [[Gazarta]] d'Beth Zabda\u00ef, and they were blessed by all the shrines and monasteries, and the religious houses, and the monks, and the fathers in their dioceses.<ref>Wallis Budge, ''The Monks of Kublai Khan'', 142\u20133</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWith the exception of the patriarchal church of Kokhe in Baghdad and the nearby monastery of Mar Mari, all these sites were well to the north of Baghdad, in the districts of northern Mesopotamia where historic East Syriac Christianity survived into the 20th century.\n\nA similar pattern is evident several years later.  Eleven bishops were present at the consecration of the patriarch [[Timothy II (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy II]] in 1318:  the metropolitans Joseph of {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Ilam, {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} of Nisibis and Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}on of Mosul, and the bishops Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}on of Beth Garma\u00ef, Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}on of [[Tirhan (East Syrian Diocese)|Tirhan]], Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}on of Balad, Yohannan of Beth Waziq, Yohannan of [[Shigar (East Syrian Diocese)|Shigar]], {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} of Hnitha, Isaac of Beth Daron and Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}yahb of Tella and Barbelli (Marga).  Timothy himself had been metropolitan of Erbil before his election as patriarch.  Again, with the exception of {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Ilam (whose metropolitan, Joseph, was present in his capacity of 'guardian of the throne' (''natar kursya'') all the dioceses represented were in northern Mesopotamia.<ref>Assemani, ''BO'', iii. i. 567\u201380</ref>\n\n====Provinces of Mosul and Erbil====\n{{See also|Adiabene (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nAt the beginning of the 13th century there were at least eight suffragan dioceses in the provinces of Mosul and Erbil:  Haditha, Ma{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}altha, Hebton, Beth Bgash, Dasen, Beth Nuhadra, Marga and Urmi.  The diocese of Hebton is last mentioned in 1257, when its bishop Gabriel attended the consecration of the patriarch [[Makkikha II]].<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 89\u201390</ref>  The diocese of Dasen definitely persisted into the 14th century, as did the diocese of Marga, though it was renamed Tella and Barbelli in the second half of the 13th century.  It is possible that the dioceses of Beth Nuhadra, Beth Bgash and Haditha also survived into the 14th century.  Haditha, indeed, is mentioned as a diocese at the beginning of the 14th century by {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} of Nisibis.<ref>Fiey, POCN, 86\u20137</ref>  Urmi too, although none of its bishops are known, may also have persisted as a diocese into the 16th century, when it again appears as the seat of an East Syriac bishop.<ref name=\"Fiey, POCN, 141\u20132\">Fiey, ''POCN'', 141\u20132</ref>  The diocese of Ma{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}altha is last mentioned in 1281, but probably persisted into the 14th century under the name Hnitha.  The bishop {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} 'of Hnitha', attested in 1310 and 1318, was almost certainly a bishop of the diocese formerly known as Ma{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}altha.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 91\u20132 and 106</ref>\n\n====Province of Nisibis====\n{{See also|Nisibis (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)}}\nThe celebrated East Syriac writer {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} of Nisibis, himself metropolitan of Nisibis and Armenia, listed thirteen suffragan dioceses in the province 'of Soba (Nisibis) and Mediterranean Syria' at the end of the 13th century, in the following order:  Arzun, Qube, Beth Rahima\u00ef, Balad, Shigar, Qardu, Tamanon, Beth Zabda\u00ef, Halat, Harran, Amid, Resh{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}a\u00efna and 'Adormiah' (Qarta and Adarma).<ref>Chabot, 619\u201320</ref>  It has been convincingly argued that {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} was giving a conspectus of dioceses in the province of Nisibis at various periods in its history rather than an authentic list of late 13th-century dioceses, and it is most unlikely that dioceses of Qube, Beth Rahima\u00ef, Harran and Resh{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}a\u00efna still existed at this period.\n\nA diocese was founded around the middle of the 13th century to the north of the Tur {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abdin for the town of Hesna d'Kifa, perhaps in response to East Syriac immigration to the towns of the Tigris plain during the Mongol period.  At the same time, a number of older dioceses may have ceased to exist.  The dioceses of Qaimar and Qarta and Adarma are last mentioned towards the end of the 12th century, and the diocese of Tamanon in 1265, and it is not clear whether they persisted into the 14th century.  The only dioceses in the province of Nisibis definitely in existence at the end of the 13th century were Armenia (whose bishops sat at Halat on the northern shore of Lake Van), Shigar, Balad, Arzun and Maiperqat.\n\n===Exterior provinces===\n\n==== Arabia, Persia and Central Asia ====\n[[Image:NestorianTombstoneIssykKul1312.jpg|thumb|right|120px|East Syriac tombstone of 1312 from Issyk Kul, with Uighur inscription]]\nBy the end of the 13th century Christianity was also declining in the exterior provinces.  Between the 7th and 14th centuries Christianity gradually disappeared in Arabia and Persia.  There were at least five dioceses in northern Arabia in the 7th century and nine in Fars at the end of the 9th century, only one of which (the isolated island of [[Socotra|Soqotra]]) survived into the 14th century.<ref>Fiey, ''Communaut\u00e9s syriaques'', 177\u2013219</ref>  There were perhaps twenty East Syriac dioceses in Media, Tabaristan, Khorasan and Segestan at the end of the 9th century, only one of which (Tus in Khorasan) survived into the 13th century.<ref>Fiey, ''Communaut\u00e9s syriaques'', 75\u2013104 and 357\u201384</ref>\n\nThe East Syriac communities in Central Asia disappeared during the 14th century.  Continual warfare eventually made it impossible for the Church of the East to send bishops to minister to its far-flung congregations.  The blame for the destruction of the Christian communities east of [[Iraq]] has often been thrown upon the [[Turco-Mongol]] leader [[Timur]], whose campaigns during the 1390s spread havoc throughout Persia and Central Asia.  There is no reason to doubt that Timur was responsible for the destruction of certain Christian communities, but in much of central Asia Christianity had died out decades earlier.  The surviving evidence, including a large number of dated graves, indicates that the crisis for the Church of the East occurred in the 1340s rather than the 1390s.  Few Christian graves have been found later than the 1340s, indicating that the isolated East Syriac communities in Central Asia, weakened by warfare, plague and lack of leadership, converted to Islam around the middle of the 14th century.\n\n====Adarbaigan====\nAlthough the Church of the East was losing ground to Islam in Iran and Central Asia, it was making gains elsewhere.  The migration of Christians from southern Mesopotamia led to a revival of Christianity in the province of Adarbaigan, where Christians could practice their religion freely under Mongol protection.  An East Syriac diocese is mentioned as early as 1074 at Urmi,<ref name=\"Fiey, POCN, 141\u20132\"/> and three others were created before the end of the 13th century, one a new metropolitan see for the province of Adarbaigan (possibly replacing the old metropolitan province of Arran, and with its seat at [[Tabriz]]), and three others for Eshnuq, [[Salmas]] and al-Rustaq (probably to be identified with the Shemsdin district of Hakkari).<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 126, 127 and 142\u20133</ref> The metropolitan of Adarbaigan was present at the consecration of the patriarch [[Mar Denha I|Denha I]] in 1265, while bishops of Eshnuq, [[Salmas]] and al-Rustaq attended the consecration of [[Yaballaha III|Yahballaha III]] in 1281.  The foundation of these four dioceses probably reflected a migration of East Syriac Christians to the shores of Lake Urmi after the lakeside towns became Mongol cantonments in the 1240s.  According to the Armenian historian [[Kirakos of Gandzak]], the Mongol occupation of Adarbaigan enabled churches to be built in Tabriz and Nakichevan for the first time in those cities\u2019 history.  Substantial Christian communities are attested in both towns at the end of the 13th century, and also in Maragha, Hamadan and Sultaniyyeh.\n\n====China====\n[[Image:HulaguAndDokuzKathun.JPG|thumb|right|The Mongol khan [[Hulagu Khan|Hulagu]] and his Christian queen [[Doquz Khatun]]]]\n{{see also|Christianity among the Mongols|Church of the East in China}}\nThere were also temporary Christian gains further afield.  The Mongol conquest of China in the second half of the 13th century allowed the East Syriac church to return to China, and by the end of the century two new metropolitan provinces had been created for China, Tangut and 'Katai and Ong'.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 48\u20139, 103\u20134 and 137\u20138</ref>  \n\nThe province of Tangut covered northwestern China, and its metropolitan seems to have sat at [[Almaliq, Xinjiang|Almaliq]].  The province evidently had several dioceses, even though they cannot now be localised, as the metropolitan Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}on Bar Qaligh of Tangut was arrested by the patriarch [[Mar Denha I|Denha I]] shortly before his death in 1281 'together with a number of his bishops'.<ref>Bar Hebraeus, ''Ecclesiastical Chronicle'', ii. 450</ref>  \n\nThe province of Katai [Cathay] and Ong, which seems to have replaced the old T'ang dynasty province of Beth Sinaye, covered northern China and the country of the Christian [[Ongud|Ongut]] tribe around the great bend of the Yellow River.  The metropolitans of Katai and Ong probably sat at the Mongol capital Khanbaliq.  The patriarch Yahballaha III grew up in a monastery in northern China in the 1270s, and the metropolitans Giwargis and Nestoris are mentioned in his biography.<ref>Wallis Budge, ''The Monks of Kublai Khan'', 127 and 132</ref>  [[Yaballaha III|Yahballaha]] himself was consecrated metropolitan of Katai and Ong by the patriarch [[Mar Denha I|Denha I]] shortly before his death in 1281.<ref>Bar Hebraeus, ''Ecclesiastical Chronicle'', ii. 452</ref> \n\nDuring the first half of the 14th century there were East Syriac Christian communities in many cities in China, and the province of Katai and Ong probably had several suffragan dioceses.  In 1253 William of Rubruck mentioned a Nestorian bishop in the town of 'Segin' (Xijing, modern [[Datong]] in [[Shanxi]] province).  The tomb of a Nestorian bishop named Shlemun, who died in 1313, has recently been discovered at [[Quanzhou]] in [[Fujian]] province.  Shlemun's epitaph described him as 'administrator of the Christians and Manicheans of Manzi (south China)'.  Marco Polo had earlier reported the existence of a Manichean community in Fujian, at first thought to be Christian, and it is not surprising to find this small religious minority represented officially by a Christian bishop.<ref>Lieu, S., ''Manichaeism in Central Asia and China'', 180</ref>\n\nThe 14th-century Nestorian communities in China existed under Mongol protection, and were dispersed when the Mongol Yuan dynasty was overthrown in 1368.\n\n====Palestine and Cyprus====\nThere were East Syriac communities at Antioch, Tripolis and Acre in the 1240s.  The metropolitan Abraham 'of Jerusalem and Tripolis' was present at the consecration of the patriarch [[Yaballaha III]] in 1281.<ref>Sliba, 124 (Arabic)</ref>  Abraham probably sat in the coastal city of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripolis]] (still in Crusader hands until 1289) rather than Jerusalem, which had fallen definitively to the [[Mameluks]] in 1241.\n\nThe Crusader stronghold of [[Acre (Israel)|Acre]], the last city in the Holy Land under Christian control, fell to the [[Mameluks]] in 1291.  Most of the city's Christians, unwilling to live under Moslem rule, abandoned their homes and resettled in Christian Cyprus.  Cyprus had an East Syriac bishop in 1445, Timothy, who made a Catholic profession of faith at the [[Council of Florence]], and was probably already the seat of an East Syriac bishop or metropolitan by the end of the 13th century.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dioceses of the Church of the East, 1318\u20131552]]\n* [[Dioceses of the Church of the East after 1552]]\n* [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* Abbeloos, J.

It was re-formed in 1976, playing in the [[South of Scotland Football League|South of Scotland League]].\n\nIn 2001 Dalbeattie joined the [[East of Scotland Football League|East of Scotland League]], playing in the league for eight seasons and finishing as runners-up in 2008\u201309, before returning to the South of Scotland League. \n\nThey reached the third round of the [[2008\u201309 Scottish Cup]], before losing to [[Highland Football League|Highland League]] side [[Forres Mechanics F.C.|Forres Mechanics]] 2\u22124 after extra time, following a very creditable 2\u20132 draw at [[Mosset Park, Forres|Mosset Park]].\n\nThe Star finished runners-up behind [[Threave Rovers F.C.|Threave Rovers]] in their first season back in the South of Scotland League,\nand the [[Castle Douglas]] side prevailed again in 2010\u201311. Although pushed all the way, a 0\u20132 home defeat by Threave in the penultimate game of the season tipped the title race in favour of the champions. \n\nIn 2011\u201312, Dalbettie won the [[South of Scotland Football League|South of Scotland League]] for the first time since [[1988\u201389 in Scottish football|1988\u201389]], finishing the league season unbeaten having won 21 of the 24 matches. The title was clinched with a 1\u20131 draw away to Threave Rovers, the defending champions. As well as the league, the Star also won four cups - the Challenge Cup, League Cup, Potts Cup and the Haig Gordon Cup, meaning the 2011\u201312 season was one of the best ever in the club's history. \n\nThe following season, 2012\u201313, Star retained the league title with a couple of games to spare, though their long unbeaten league was ended (41 games). The South of Scotland Challenge Cup and the League Cup were also retained with wins over [[Nithsdale Wanderers F.C.|Nithsdale Wanderers]] and [[Threave Rovers F.C.|Threave Rovers]], and the Tweedie Cup was won with another victory over Threave. \n\nIn the summer of 2013 Star joined the newly formed [[Lowland League]]. In the inaugural season of the league Star finished a creditable third and though [[2013\u201314 Lowland Football League|2013\u201314]] was not trophy laden like the previous two seasons, significant progress was made on the park with some excellent results and performances.

Club''' is a Scottish [[association football]] club based in [[Dalbeattie]], [[Dumfries and Galloway]] that currently competes in the [[Lowland Football League]]. \n\nThe club had previously played in the [[South of Scotland Football League]]. \n\nHome matches are played at [[Islecroft Stadium]] in Dalbeattie and as a senior team in Scotland they are eligible to play in the [[Scottish Cup]].\n\n== History ==\nThe club was founded in 1905 but folded in 1948. It was re-formed in 1976, playing in the [[South of Scotland Football League|South of Scotland League]].\n\nIn 2001 Dalbeattie joined the [[East of Scotland Football League|East of Scotland League]], playing in the league for eight seasons and finishing as runners-up in 2008\u201309, before returning to the South of Scotland League. \n\nThey reached the third round of the [[2008\u201309 Scottish Cup]], before losing to [[Highland Football League|Highland League]] side [[Forres Mechanics F.C.|Forres Mechanics]] 2\u22124 after extra time, following a very creditable 2\u20132 draw at [[Mosset Park, Forres|Mosset Park]].\n\nThe Star finished runners-up behind [[Threave Rovers F.C.|Threave Rovers]] in their first season back in the South of Scotland League,\nand the [[Castle Douglas]] side prevailed again in 2010\u201311. Although pushed all the way, a 0\u20132 home defeat by Threave in the penultimate game of the season tipped the title race in favour of the champions. \n\nIn 2011\u201312, Dalbettie won the [[South of Scotland Football League|South of Scotland League]] for the first time since [[1988\u201389 in Scottish football|1988\u201389]], finishing the league season unbeaten having won 21 of the 24 matches. The title was clinched with a 1\u20131 draw away to Threave Rovers, the defending champions. As well as the league, the Star also won four cups - the Challenge Cup, League Cup, Potts Cup and the Haig Gordon Cup, meaning the 2011\u201312 season was one of the best ever in the club's history. \n\nThe following season, 2012\u201313, Star retained the league title with a couple of games to spare, though their long unbeaten league was ended (41 games). The South of Scotland Challenge Cup and the League Cup were also retained with wins over [[Nithsdale Wanderers F.C.|Nithsdale Wanderers]] and [[Threave Rovers F.C.|Threave Rovers]], and the Tweedie Cup was won with another victory over Threave. \n\nIn the summer of 2013 Star joined the newly formed [[Lowland League]]. In the inaugural season of the league Star finished a creditable third and though [[2013\u201314 Lowland Football League|2013\u201314]] was not trophy laden like the previous two seasons, significant progress was made on the park with some excellent results and performances. There were big disappointments as well, none more so than a second SFA South Region Challenge Cup final defeat in a row, this time to East Kilbride (0\u20132) at Palmerston.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://slfl.co.uk/east-kilbride-lift-south-challenge-cup/|title=East Kilbride lift South Challenge Cup|last=Park|first=Michael|date=2014-05-24|website=Scottish Lowland League|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref> The following season the club finished fourth in the league but again missed out on silverware in the cups.

Wenger followed in the footsteps of [[Alex Ferguson]] and [[Kenny Dalglish]] and, while both Ferguson and Dalglish were [[Scotland|Scottish]], Wenger was the first manager from outside the British Isles to win a league title in England.\n\n==Season summary==\nAt the end of the 1997\u201398 FA Premier League season, a record total of nine English teams qualified for European competition.\n\nPremiership champions Arsenal and runners-up Manchester United qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], while [[UEFA Cup]] places went to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. Qualifying for the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] were [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] (as defending champions) and FA Cup runners-up [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], while finishing bottom, qualified for the Intertoto Cup.<ref name=\"1997-98 tables\">[http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/eng98.html League tables and results for English football leagues, 1997\u201398 season]. Retrieved 21 September 2006.</ref>\n\nThe gap between the Premier League and Division One of [[the Football League]] was highlighted at the end of 1997\u201398 when all three newly promoted teams were relegated. [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] were confined to bottom place in the final table having won just two home games all season. [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]'s first season in the top division ended in relegation, although they did reach the [[FA Cup]] quarter finals and knock out Manchester United in the Fifth Round. [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] went down on goal difference, with 17th place being occupied by Everton: despite preserving top flight football there for the 45th season running, [[Howard Kendall]] quit as manager at [[Goodison Park]] after his third spell in charge.\n\nAnother mark of the gap was that the three relegated teams in the previous season took the top three places in the [[1997\u201398 Football League]]. Had [[Sunderland A.F.C|Sunderland]] not lost the play-off final to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on penalty shootout, the 20 teams from [[1998\u201399 FA Premier League|1998\u201399 Premier League]] would have been exactly the same as those in the [[1996\u201397 FA Premier League|1996\u201397 Premier League]].\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[1996\u201397 Football League First Division|First Division]]. The promoted teams were [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] (returning to the top flight after a season's absence), [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] (playing in the top flight for the first time) and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] (playing in the top flight again after a two-year absence). They replaced [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], who were relegated after top flight spells of one, two and three years respectively.\n\n===Stadiums and Locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 1997\u201398 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England |lat=51.5155|long=-0.0922|label_size=80|label=London|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.509103 |long=-1.884786 |label_size=80|label=[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.552308 |long=-1.467617 |label_size=80|label=[[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.728569 |long=-2.489206 |label_size=80|label=[[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|{{nowrap|Blackburn Rovers}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.580578 |long=-2.535644 |label_size=80|label=[[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|{{nowrap|Bolton Wanderers}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.448111 |long=-1.495611 |label_size=80|label=[[Coventry City F.C.|{{nowrap|Coventry City}}]]|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.914911 |long=-1.447233 |label_size=80|label=[[Derby County F.C.|{{nowrap|Derby County}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.438846 |long=-2.966285 |label_size=80|label=[[Everton F.C.|Everton]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.704069 |long=-1.341731 |label_size=80|label=[[Leeds United F.C.|{{nowrap|Leeds United}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.611402 |long=-1.082508 |label_size=80|label=[[Leicester City F.C.|{{nowrap|Leicester City}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.430845 |long=-2.960823 |label_size=80|label=[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.47     |long=-2.25     |label_size=80|label=[[Manchester United F.C.|{{nowrap|Manchester&nbsp;United}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=54.974    |long=-1.614    |label_size=80|label=[[Newcastle United F.C.|{{nowrap|Newcastle United}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.370342 |long=-1.470853 |label_size=80|label=[[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|{{nowrap|Sheffield Wednesday}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=50.905826 |long=-1.390975 |label_size=80|label=[[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]|position=left}}\n\n<!--DISPLAY OF LONDON TEAMS IN UPPER RIGHT CORNER-->\n{{Location map~ |England |mark=TransparentPlaceholder.png |marksize=1 |lat=55.7 |long=-0.2 |label_size=80|label='''[[Football in London|London]]&nbsp;teams:'''<br />\n[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]<br />\n[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]<br />\n[[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]<br />\n[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham&nbsp;Hotspur]]<br/>\n[[West Ham United F.C.|{{nowrap|West Ham United}}]]<br/>\n[[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]\n|position=right}}\n}}\n\n{{Location map+|Greater London\n |width=300\n |float=right\n |caption=Greater London Premier League football clubs\n |alt=Greater London Premier League football clubs\n |places =\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.552 |long=-0.097 |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=left}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.481667 |long=-0.191111 |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.398333 |long=-0.085556|mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Crystal Palace F.C.|{{nowrap|Crystal Palace}}]]<br>[[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.5974   |long=-0.0716   |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|{{nowrap|Tottenham<br />Hotspur}}]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.531944 |long=0.039444|mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[West Ham United F.C.|{{nowrap|West Ham United}}]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

FA Premier League|1998\u201399]]\n}}\n\nThe '''1997\u201398 FA Premier League''' (known as the '''FA [[Carling]] Premiership''' for sponsorship reasons) was the sixth season of the FA Premier League. It saw [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] lift their first league title since 1991<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.arsenal.com/first-team/honours|title=Honours|publisher=[[Arsenal]]|accessdate=2 February 2020}}</ref> and, in so doing, became only the second team to win '[[Double (association football)#England|The Double]]' for the second time. \n\nIt was Arsenal's first full season under French manager [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]], who became the third manager to win the Premier League. Wenger followed in the footsteps of [[Alex Ferguson]] and [[Kenny Dalglish]] and, while both Ferguson and Dalglish were [[Scotland|Scottish]], Wenger was the first manager from outside the British Isles to win a league title in England.\n\n==Season summary==\nAt the end of the 1997\u201398 FA Premier League season, a record total of nine English teams qualified for European competition.\n\nPremiership champions Arsenal and runners-up Manchester United qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], while [[UEFA Cup]] places went to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. Qualifying for the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] were [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] (as defending champions) and FA Cup runners-up [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], while finishing bottom, qualified for the Intertoto Cup.<ref name=\"1997-98 tables\">[http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/eng98.html League tables and results for English football leagues, 1997\u201398 season]. Retrieved 21 September 2006.</ref>\n\nThe gap between the Premier League and Division One of [[the Football League]] was highlighted at the end of 1997\u201398 when all three newly promoted teams were relegated. [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] were confined to bottom place in the final table having won just two home games all season. [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]'s first season in the top division ended in relegation, although they did reach the [[FA Cup]] quarter finals and knock out Manchester United in the Fifth Round. [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] went down on goal difference, with 17th place being occupied by Everton: despite preserving top flight football there for the 45th season running, [[Howard Kendall]] quit as manager at [[Goodison Park]] after his third spell in charge.\n\nAnother mark of the gap was that the three relegated teams in the previous season took the top three places in the [[1997\u201398 Football League]]. Had [[Sunderland A.F.C|Sunderland]] not lost the play-off final to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on penalty shootout, the 20 teams from [[1998\u201399 FA Premier League|1998\u201399 Premier League]] would have been exactly the same as those in the [[1996\u201397 FA Premier League|1996\u201397 Premier League]].\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[1996\u201397 Football League First Division|First Division]]. The promoted teams were [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] (returning to the top flight after a season's absence), [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] (playing in the top flight for the first time) and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] (playing in the top flight again after a two-year absence). They replaced [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], who were relegated after top flight spells of one, two and three years respectively.\n\n===Stadiums and Locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 1997\u201398 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England |lat=51.5155|long=-0.0922|label_size=80|label=London|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.509103 |long=-1.884786 |label_size=80|label=[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.552308 |long=-1.467617 |label_size=80|label=[[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.728569 |long=-2.489206 |label_size=80|label=[[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|{{nowrap|Blackburn Rovers}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.580578 |long=-2.535644 |label_size=80|label=[[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|{{nowrap|Bolton Wanderers}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.448111 |long=-1.495611 |label_size=80|label=[[Coventry City F.C.|{{nowrap|Coventry City}}]]|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.914911 |long=-1.447233 |label_size=80|label=[[Derby County F.C.|{{nowrap|Derby County}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.438846 |long=-2.966285 |label_size=80|label=[[Everton F.C.|Everton]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.704069 |long=-1.341731 |label_size=80|label=[[Leeds United F.C.|{{nowrap|Leeds United}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.611402 |long=-1.082508 |label_size=80|label=[[Leicester City F.C.|{{nowrap|Leicester City}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.430845 |long=-2.960823 |label_size=80|label=[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.47     |long=-2.25     |label_size=80|label=[[Manchester United F.C.|{{nowrap|Manchester&nbsp;United}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=54.974    |long=-1.614    |label_size=80|label=[[Newcastle United F.C.|{{nowrap|Newcastle United}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.370342 |long=-1.470853 |label_size=80|label=[[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|{{nowrap|Sheffield Wednesday}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=50.905826 |long=-1.390975 |label_size=80|label=[[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]|position=left}}\n\n<!--DISPLAY OF LONDON TEAMS IN UPPER RIGHT CORNER-->\n{{Location map~ |England |mark=TransparentPlaceholder.png |marksize=1 |lat=55.7 |long=-0.2 |label_size=80|label='''[[Football in London|London]]&nbsp;teams:'''<br />\n[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]<br />\n[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]<br />\n[[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]<br />\n[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham&nbsp;Hotspur]]<br/>\n[[West Ham United F.C.|{{nowrap|West Ham United}}]]<br/>\n[[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]\n|position=right}}\n}}\n\n{{Location map+|Greater London\n |width=300\n |float=right\n |caption=Greater London Premier League football clubs\n |alt=Greater London Premier League football clubs\n |places =\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.552 |long=-0.097 |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=left}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.481667 |long=-0.191111 |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.398333 |long=-0.085556|mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Crystal Palace F.C.|{{nowrap|Crystal Palace}}]]<br>[[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.5974   |long=-0.0716   |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|{{nowrap|Tottenham<br />Hotspur}}]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.531944 |long=0.039444|mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[West Ham United F.C.|{{nowrap|West Ham United}}]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Since they harbour an aragonitic shell, they could be very sensitive to ocean acidification driven by the increase of anthropogenic CO\u2082 emissions.Laboratory tests showed that calcification exhibits a 28% decrease of the pH value of the Arctic ocean expected for the year 2100, compared to the present pH value. This 28% decline of calcification in the lower pH condition is within the range reported for other calcifying organisms such as corals.<ref name=\"ref 5\" /> In contrast with sea urchin and bivalve larvae, corals and marine shrimps are more severely impacted by ocean acidification after settlement, while they developed into the polyp stage. From laboratory tests, the morphology of the CO\u2082-treated polyp endoskeleton of corals was disturbed and malformed compared to the radial pattern of control polyps.<ref name=\"ref 10\" />\n\nThis variability in the impact of ocean acidification on different life cycle stages of different organisms can be partially explained by the fact that most echinoderms and mollusks start shell and skeleton synthesis at their larval stage, while corals start at the settlement stage.<ref name=\"ref 10\" />  Hence, these stages are highly susceptible to the potential effects of ocean acidification.Most calcifiers, such as corals, echinoderms, bivalves and crustaceans, play important roles in coastal ecosystems as keystone species, bioturbators and ecosystem engineers.<ref name=\"ref 10\" /> The [[food web]] in the arctic ocean is somewhat truncated, meaning it is short and simple. Any impacts to key species in the food web can cause exponentially devastating effects on the rest of the food chain as a whole, as they will no longer have a reliable food source. If these larger organisms no longer have any source of nutrients, they too will eventually die off, and the entire Arctic ocean ecosystem will be affected. This would have a huge impact on the arctic people who catch arctic fish for a living, as well as the economic repercussions which would follow such a major shortage of food and living income for these families.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{improve categories|date=January 2019}}\n\n[[Category:Arctic Ocean]]\n[[Category:Effects of global warming]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|}}\n\n[[File:Arctic ocean drift ice, the realm of the polar bear.jpg|thumb|249x249px|Arctic drift ice, with a popular arctic organism, the polar bear]]\nThe [[Arctic ocean]] covers an area of 14,056,000 squared kilometers, and supports a diverse and important socioeconomic food web of organisms, despite its average water temperature being 32 degrees Fahrenheit.<ref name=\":0\" /> Over the last three decades, the Arctic Ocean has experienced drastic changes due to climate change.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Lisa L.|last2=Yates|first2=Kimberly K.|last3=Feely|first3=Richard|last4=Fabry|first4=Victoria|date=2010|title=Monitoring and assessment of ocean acidification in the Arctic Ocean-A scoping paper|url=http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20101227}}</ref> One of the changes is in the acidity levels of the ocean, which have been consistently increasing at twice the rate of the [[Pacific]] and [[Atlantic ocean]]s.<ref name=\"Ref 1\">{{cite journal |last1=Qi |first1=Di |last2=Chen |first2=Liqi |last3=Chen |first3=Baoshan |last4=Gao |first4=Zhongyong |last5=Zhong |first5=Wenli |last6=Feely |first6=Richard A. |last7=Anderson |first7=Leif G. |last8=Sun |first8=Heng |last9=Chen |first9=Jianfang |last10=Chen |first10=Min |last11=Zhan |first11=Liyang |last12=Zhang |first12=Yuanhui |last13=Cai |first13=Wei-Jun |title=Increase in acidifying water in the western Arctic Ocean |journal=Nature Climate Change |date=27 February 2017 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=195\u2013199 |doi=10.1038/nclimate3228 |issn=1758-678X}}</ref> Arctic Ocean acidification is a result of feedback from climate system mechanisms, and is having negative impacts on Arctic Ocean ecosystems and the organisms that live within them.\n\n=== Ocean Acidification Process ===\n[[Ocean acidification]] is caused by the equilibration of the atmosphere with the ocean, a process that occurs worldwide.

Since they harbour an aragonitic shell, they could be very sensitive to ocean acidification driven by the increase of anthropogenic CO\u2082 emissions.Laboratory tests showed that calcification exhibits a 28% decrease of the pH value of the Arctic ocean expected for the year 2100, compared to the present pH value. This 28% decline of calcification in the lower pH condition is within the range reported for other calcifying organisms such as corals.<ref name=\"ref 5\" /> In contrast with sea urchin and bivalve larvae, corals and marine shrimps are more severely impacted by ocean acidification after settlement, while they developed into the polyp stage. From laboratory tests, the morphology of the CO\u2082-treated polyp endoskeleton of corals was disturbed and malformed compared to the radial pattern of control polyps.<ref name=\"ref 10\" />\n\nThis variability in the impact of ocean acidification on different life cycle stages of different organisms can be partially explained by the fact that most echinoderms and mollusks start shell and skeleton synthesis at their larval stage, while corals start at the settlement stage.<ref name=\"ref 10\" />  Hence, these stages are highly susceptible to the potential effects of ocean acidification.Most calcifiers, such as corals, echinoderms, bivalves and crustaceans, play important roles in coastal ecosystems as keystone species, bioturbators and ecosystem engineers.<ref name=\"ref 10\" /> The [[food web]] in the arctic ocean is somewhat truncated, meaning it is short and simple. Any impacts to key species in the food web can cause exponentially devastating effects on the rest of the food chain as a whole, as they will no longer have a reliable food source. If these larger organisms no longer have any source of nutrients, they too will eventually die off, and the entire Arctic ocean ecosystem will be affected. This would have a huge impact on the arctic people who catch arctic fish for a living, as well as the economic repercussions which would follow such a major shortage of food and living income for these families.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{improve categories|date=January 2019}}\n\n[[Category:Arctic Ocean]]\n[[Category:Effects of global warming]]\n", "name_user": "Shanell.lovelace", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification_in_the_Arctic_Ocean"}
