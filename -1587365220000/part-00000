The Metropolis includes all of the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Massachusetts]], [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Vermont]], as well as the [[Connecticut]] towns of [[Danielson, Connecticut|Danielson]], [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] and [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]]. The Metropolis, whose offices are located in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], consists of 63 parishes which minister to the needs of approximately 200,000 [[Greek Orthodox]] faithful.\n\nMethodios was enthroned as Bishop of Boston on April 8, 1984 and was elevated to a Metropolitan in 1997. During his tenure, he founded the [[Philoxenia House]] and also oversaw the purchase and building of the [[St. Methodios Faith and Heritage Center]] in [[Contoocook, New Hampshire]]. On May 11, 2019, he was appointed to serve as the acting Archbishop of the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]] before the new Archbishop was enthroned on June 22, 2019.<ref name=locumtenens>https://www.thenationalherald.com/243788/metropolitan-elpidophoros-new-archbishop-of-america/</ref><ref name=installednow>https://www.goarch.org/-/enthronement-address-archbishop-elpidophoros</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nMetropolitan Methodios was born George Tournas on November 19, 1946 in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and was the third child of Stavroula and Vasilios Tournas. He graduated from the Greek Orthodox Cathedral Parochial School in New York City and the McBurney School in [[Manhattan]]. Methodios received the Bachelor of Arts degree from [[Hellenic College]] in [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] in 1968 and the Bachelor of Divinity Degree from [[Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology]] in 1971. In 1972 he earned the Master of Sacred Theology from [[Boston University]] and in 1975 the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki|University of Thessaloniki]], awarded him Theological Accreditation upon completion of further studies there. Boston University awarded Methodios the Honorary Doctor of Divinity Degree in May 1985. In June 1995 the [[American International College]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], awarded Methodios the Honorary Degree of Humane Letters. His Alma Mater, Hellenic College-Holy Cross, awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Divinity Degree on May 19, 2001.\n\n==Episcopacy==\nMetropolitan Methodios served as a member of the National Orthodox-Roman Catholic Consultations Board. As a member of the [[Appeal of Conscience Foundation]], an Organization devoted to the cause of worldwide religious freedom for all denominations, Metropolitan Methodios traveled to [[Hungary]] in 1981, and, in the fall of 1982 he was a member of a three-man religious delegation that visited the [[Soviet Union]]. A second visit to the Soviet Union was made in September 1984. Metropolitan Methodios is a member of the [[Holy Synod]] of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] in the United States, served on the Executive Board of the [[National Council of Churches]] and is a member of the [[Massachusetts Commission on Christian Unity]] and the [[New England Consultation of Church Leaders]]. He is listed in ''Who is Who in Religion'', is a member of the [[SCOBA|Standing Conference of Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas]] and serves on various other religious boards and organizations.\n\nMethodios was enthroned as the Bishop of Boston on April 8, 1984, following his election to that post by the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in [[Phanar]], [[Constantinople]], [[Turkey]]. In July 1989, Bishop Methodios assumed the presidency of [[Hellenic College]] and [[Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology]] in Brookline, Massachusetts, a position he held until 1995. In November 1997, the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate elevated Bishop Methodios to the office of Metropolitan along with the other bishops of the Archdiocese of America.<ref>{{Citation | last =Ribadeneira  | first =Diego | title = Venerable Heston Still Goes By The Book  | newspaper =[[The Boston Globe]] | date =November 29, 1997 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&p_theme=bg&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADDCE04ECCBA46&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |accessdate=May 1, 2009}}</ref> His [[episcopal see|see]], however, remained a diocese until December 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wfn.org/2003/01/msg00192.html|title=New Charter for the Archdiocese Granted by the Ecumenical|last=Morrow|first=Rev.

Groundbreaking for the project took place on September 14, 1985. It was completed a year later, on September 14, 1986. From this Center, which serves as the headquarters of the Metropolis, many programs emanate which serve and enlighten the faithful and share [[Orthodoxy]] with the public-at-large. These programs include the Marriage Preparation Seminars, instituted by Metropolitan Methodios in 1987, for all couples who are getting married in the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston.\n\nIn 1986 Metropolitan Methodios established the [[Philoxenia House]] which offers hospitality to patients and those who accompany them who come to Boston for medical reasons and cannot afford to stay in hotels. Guests to the Philoxenia House have come from [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], [[South America]], [[South Africa]], [[Egypt]], [[Russia]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Bulgaria]] and from throughout the [[United States]]. Metropolitan Methodios is assisted by the [[Philoptochos]] Women and the faithful throughout the Metropolis in this ministry. \n[[File:Methodios (Tournas).jpg|thumb|Metropolitan Methodios (2012)]]\nIn the summer of 1998, the Diocese of Boston acquired [[Camp Merrimac]] in [[Contoocook, New Hampshire]], a large former summer camp which became the [[St. Methodios Faith and Heritage Center]], offering programs for youth and families.\n\nThe Bishop, who walks at the annual [[Walk for Hunger]] sponsored by [[Project Bread]], is a frequent visitor to area soup kitchens where he serves food to those who are in need.

The Metropolis includes all of the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Massachusetts]], [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Vermont]], as well as the [[Connecticut]] towns of [[Danielson, Connecticut|Danielson]], [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] and [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]]. The Metropolis, whose offices are located in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], consists of 63 parishes which minister to the needs of approximately 200,000 [[Greek Orthodox]] faithful.\n\nMethodios was enthroned as Bishop of Boston on April 8, 1984 and was elevated to a Metropolitan in 1997. During his tenure, he founded the [[Philoxenia House]] and also oversaw the purchase and building of the [[St. Methodios Faith and Heritage Center]] in [[Contoocook, New Hampshire]]. On May 11, 2019, he was appointed to serve as the acting Archbishop of the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]] before the new Archbishop was enthroned on June 22, 2019.<ref name=locumtenens>https://www.thenationalherald.com/243788/metropolitan-elpidophoros-new-archbishop-of-america/</ref><ref name=installednow>https://www.goarch.org/-/enthronement-address-archbishop-elpidophoros</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nMetropolitan Methodios was born George Tournas on November 19, 1946 in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and was the third child of Stavroula and Vasilios Tournas. He graduated from the Greek Orthodox Cathedral Parochial School in New York City and the McBurney School in [[Manhattan]]. Methodios received the Bachelor of Arts degree from [[Hellenic College]] in [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] in 1968 and the Bachelor of Divinity Degree from [[Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology]] in 1971. In 1972 he earned the Master of Sacred Theology from [[Boston University]] and in 1975 the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki|University of Thessaloniki]], awarded him Theological Accreditation upon completion of further studies there. Boston University awarded Methodios the Honorary Doctor of Divinity Degree in May 1985. In June 1995 the [[American International College]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], awarded Methodios the Honorary Degree of Humane Letters. His Alma Mater, Hellenic College-Holy Cross, awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Divinity Degree on May 19, 2001.\n\n==Episcopacy==\nMetropolitan Methodios served as a member of the National Orthodox-Roman Catholic Consultations Board. As a member of the [[Appeal of Conscience Foundation]], an Organization devoted to the cause of worldwide religious freedom for all denominations, Metropolitan Methodios traveled to [[Hungary]] in 1981, and, in the fall of 1982 he was a member of a three-man religious delegation that visited the [[Soviet Union]]. A second visit to the Soviet Union was made in September 1984. Metropolitan Methodios is a member of the [[Holy Synod]] of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] in the United States, served on the Executive Board of the [[National Council of Churches]] and is a member of the [[Massachusetts Commission on Christian Unity]] and the [[New England Consultation of Church Leaders]]. He is listed in ''Who is Who in Religion'', is a member of the [[SCOBA|Standing Conference of Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas]] and serves on various other religious boards and organizations.\n\nMethodios was enthroned as the Bishop of Boston on April 8, 1984, following his election to that post by the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in [[Phanar]], [[Constantinople]], [[Turkey]]. In July 1989, Bishop Methodios assumed the presidency of [[Hellenic College]] and [[Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology]] in Brookline, Massachusetts, a position he held until 1995. In November 1997, the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate elevated Bishop Methodios to the office of Metropolitan along with the other bishops of the Archdiocese of America.<ref>{{Citation | last =Ribadeneira  | first =Diego | title = Venerable Heston Still Goes By The Book  | newspaper =[[The Boston Globe]] | date =November 29, 1997 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&p_theme=bg&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADDCE04ECCBA46&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |accessdate=May 1, 2009}}</ref> His [[episcopal see|see]], however, remained a diocese until December 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wfn.org/2003/01/msg00192.html|title=New Charter for the Archdiocese Granted by the Ecumenical|last=Morrow|first=Rev.

Groundbreaking for the project took place on September 14, 1985. It was completed a year later, on September 14, 1986. From this Center, which serves as the headquarters of the Metropolis, many programs emanate which serve and enlighten the faithful and share [[Orthodoxy]] with the public-at-large. These programs include the Marriage Preparation Seminars, instituted by Metropolitan Methodios in 1987, for all couples who are getting married in the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston.\n\nIn 1986 Metropolitan Methodios established the [[Philoxenia House]] which offers hospitality to patients and those who accompany them who come to Boston for medical reasons and cannot afford to stay in hotels. Guests to the Philoxenia House have come from [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], [[South America]], [[South Africa]], [[Egypt]], [[Russia]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Bulgaria]] and from throughout the [[United States]]. Metropolitan Methodios is assisted by the [[Philoptochos]] Women and the faithful throughout the Metropolis in this ministry. \n[[File:Methodios (Tournas).jpg|thumb|Metropolitan Methodios (2012)]]\nIn the summer of 1998, the Diocese of Boston acquired [[Camp Merrimac]] in [[Contoocook, New Hampshire]], a large former summer camp which became the [[St. Methodios Faith and Heritage Center]], offering programs for youth and families.\n\nThe Bishop, who walks at the annual [[Walk for Hunger]] sponsored by [[Project Bread]], is a frequent visitor to area soup kitchens where he serves food to those who are in need. For his \"unique contribution in the crusade against hunger and homelessness,\" Metropolitan Methodios has been honored by the Quincy Community Action Organization Inc, in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]]. He has also been awarded the \"Good Neighbor\" Award by the [[Brotherhood Mishkan Tefila]] in Chestnut Hill.\n\nIn late July 2017, Methodios gained local media attention after firing longtime priest Father Nicholas Kastanas of the St Athanasius the Great Greek Orthodox Church in [[Arlington, Massachusetts]].
