[[Defender (association football)|defender]]. He signed for [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] in 1997 after a successful trial with the club, and played in the [[English Football League|Football League]] and later the [[National League (English football)|Football Conference]]. After making over 100 appearances for City, and winning the [[Conference League Cup]] in 2001, he was allowed to leave in early 2003. After 18 months with [[Leigh Genesis F.C.|Leigh RMI]], he played for a host of [[Non-League football|non-league]] clubs including [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]], [[Stalybridge Celtic F.C.|Stalybridge Celtic]], and [[Southport F.C.|Southport]].\n\nLancaster moved to the United States in 2005, initially to coach at a high school, but soon got the chance to play competitively again. After an unsuccessful trial with the [[Atlanta Silverbacks FC|Atlanta Silverbacks]], he signed for [[USL Second Division]] club [[Wilmington Hammerheads FC|Wilmington Hammerheads]] in 2006. He impressed in his season with Wilmington and moved up a division to sign for the Atlanta Silverbacks in 2007. He had two successful seasons with Atlanta, including being runner-up in the [[USL First Division]] in his debut season, but the club went on hiatus in late 2008 so he was forced to move on. He moved back to the United Kingdom in early 2009 to join [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]] club [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]]. He spent six months with Queens before being released at the end of the season. He signed for Swedish club [[Ljungskile SK|Ljungskile]] in the summer of 2009, and despite winning the DM Cup, his tenure was short with the [[Superettan]] side.\n\nIn 2010, Lancaster moved back to the United States, signing for [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (2006\u20132016)|Miami FC]] who later change their name to the [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (2006\u20132016)|Fort Lauderdale Strikers]] in 2011. He spent two years with Fort Lauderdale, being runner-up in [[Soccer Bowl 2011]], in what were his final appearances for the club. He returned to the Atlanta Silverbacks in 2012, who were now competing in the [[North American Soccer League]]. He was a key player in his second spell with Atlanta, becoming club captain, and leading the club to [[Soccer Bowl 2013]] despite not playing in the championship game itself. After a short spell with [[National Premier Soccer League]] club [[Georgia Revolution FC|Georgia Revolution]] in 2014, he retired from competitive football.\n\n==Early life==\n\nLancaster was born in [[Higher End|Billinge]] in [[Metropolitan Borough of Wigan|Wigan]], Greater Manchester.

Only adult males have the distinctive small rusty brown throat patch which gives the species its common name and the absence of which makes the identification of females and juveniles more difficult. The upper part of the head, body, wings, and tail are a dark-brownish grey, particularly dark on the rump and tail. While the underbody is predominantly whitish-grey, with a more whitish belly and pale buff colour blending into the flanks and undertail-coverts. The tail is dark-brownish grey with prominent white patches on the tips of the outer tail feathers, which can be seen during flight and with the tail folded. Fine off-white scalloping is visible on the forehead, with off-white eye rings and lores merging into the lighter underparts of the body. May be confused with some [[Acanthiza|thornbill]] species, which are more compact with a shorter tail than the redthroat. Unlikely to be mistaken for fieldwrens or heathwrens, which have a more strongly upturned tail at rest.<ref name=HANZAB>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic birds.

Species is vocal whilst foraging and will also sing while perched atop shrubs and taller trees.<ref name=HANZAB/>\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe redthroat is endemic to mainland Australia, occurring in all states and territories except the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] and Tasmania. The species is most prevalent in Western Australia and South Australia. It has a widespread but scattered distribution throughout most of South Australia. In Western Australia, the species is not present in the far north or the south-east but is prevalent throughout the mid-latitudes of the state. In the Northern Territory, the species is restricted to the south of the state, around the Simpson Desert and the MacDonnell Ranges. In Queensland the species is restricted to inland south-western regions. In Victoria, the species is restricted to the mallee regions in the north west of the state.<ref name=HANZAB/> In New South Wales the species is only known to occur in the far west, in several core populations including Broken Hill, Tibooburra, Penarie and Nearie Lake Nature Reserve.<ref name=NSWOEH>{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedSpeciesApp/profile.aspx?id=10721|title=Redthroat - profile|last=|first= |date=|website=NSW Government, Office of Environment and Heritage|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe species is thought to be mostly sedentary, with no evidence to suggest seasonal migration. Individuals recaptured after banding have all been found within <10&nbsp;km of the banding site.<ref name=HANZAB/>\n\n== Habitat ==\nThe habitat of the redthroat consists primarily of arid and semi-arid regions of inland Australia, but it also occupies some coastal areas, as well as plains and rangelands. Communities it favours are most often acacia and chenopod shrublands. These communities are usually characterised by an overstory of mulga (''[[Acacia aneura]]''), red mulga (''[[Acacia cyperophylla|A. cyperophylla]]'') or lacewood (''A. shirleyi'') with an understory of saltbush (''[[Atriplex]] sp''.), bluebush (''[[Chenopodium]] sp.)'' or emu bush (''[[Eremophila (plant)|Eremophila]] sp.)''.<ref name=HANZAB/> However, in some areas the species is known to occur in [[Mallee (habit)|mallee]] with a diverse understory, semi-arid woodlands, [[banksia]] and [[Leptospermum|tea tree]] thickets and shrublands with an overstory of [[Callitris glaucophylla|white cypress]].<ref name=NSWOEH/> The consistent feature among these habitats appears to be the presence of a complex understory which provides suitable foraging and nesting resources for this shy, mostly ground-dwelling species.\n\n== Diet and foraging behaviour ==\nRedthroats are [[omnivore]]s with a diet consisting of seeds from grasses and shrubs as well as a broad variety of invertebrates such as spiders, molluscs and insects.<ref name=HANZAB/> Observations of redthroat foraging behaviour found that the species predominantly forages at heights of less than 1m (73% of observations) and was not observed foraging at heights greater than 3m.<ref name=Morris>{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=WJ|last2=Wooler|first2=RD|date=2001|title=The structure and dynamics of an assemblage of small birds in a semi-arid eucalypt woodland in south-western Australia|journal=Emu |volume=101 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1071/MU00062}}</ref> This study found that redthroats feed mostly by pouncing on prey from the ground or [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] in low vegetation, with very few instances of hunting on the wing.<ref name=Morris /> Another study of foraging behaviour found that all observations of foraging occurred on the ground (<0.1 m), using a combination of gleaning and probing.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Recher |first=HF|last2=Davis |first2=WD |date=2002 |title=Foraging profile of a Salmon Gum woodland avifauna in Western Australia|url= http://www.rswa.org.au/publications/Journal/85(2)/recher85(2).pdf |journal= Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia |volume=85 |pages=103\u2013111}}</ref>\n\n== Breeding and nesting ==\nBreeding mostly occurs between June\u2013December with some geographic variation in timing. Little is known about sexual behaviour, although the species appears to breed in pairs. Nests are relatively large for a bird of its size (9\u201314&nbsp;cm), often domed, spherical or domed with a round entrance near the top (2.5\u20134&nbsp;cm). Usually constructed of bark strips and bark fibre, often lined with feathers, fur or soft plant material. Nests are located on or close to the ground among shrubs, grass tussocks, at the base of trees, in fallen logs or in small depressions. Two to four eggs are laid and the female is solely responsible for incubating the eggs. The redthroat and the closely related speckled warbler are the only members of the acanthizids which have a solid coloured chocolate brown egg.<ref name=Gardner/> Furthermore, the redthroat (and the speckled warbler) are the primary host species of some [[brood parasite]]s such as the [[black-eared cuckoo]] and [[fan-tailed cuckoo]] which remove redthroat eggs from the nest and lay their own similar looking eggs.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=hhhRGJNqQhIC&pg=PA244 |title=The Avian Brood Parasites: Deception at the Nest|last=Johnsgard |first=Paul A.|date=1997-11-06 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195354997 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=HANZAB/>\n\n==Conservation status==\nPopulations of redthroats have declined in many areas throughout Australia and the species is subject to many threatening processes.

The ongoing impacts of land clearing, noxious weeds, introduced herbivore and introduced predators are likely to cause further declines throughout the species range, which may warrant further environmental protection measures.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* Del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Christie D.

Only adult males have the distinctive small rusty brown throat patch which gives the species its common name and the absence of which makes the identification of females and juveniles more difficult. The upper part of the head, body, wings, and tail are a dark-brownish grey, particularly dark on the rump and tail. While the underbody is predominantly whitish-grey, with a more whitish belly and pale buff colour blending into the flanks and undertail-coverts. The tail is dark-brownish grey with prominent white patches on the tips of the outer tail feathers, which can be seen during flight and with the tail folded. Fine off-white scalloping is visible on the forehead, with off-white eye rings and lores merging into the lighter underparts of the body. May be confused with some [[Acanthiza|thornbill]] species, which are more compact with a shorter tail than the redthroat. Unlikely to be mistaken for fieldwrens or heathwrens, which have a more strongly upturned tail at rest.<ref name=HANZAB>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic birds.

Species is vocal whilst foraging and will also sing while perched atop shrubs and taller trees.<ref name=HANZAB/>\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe redthroat is endemic to mainland Australia, occurring in all states and territories except the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] and Tasmania. The species is most prevalent in Western Australia and South Australia. It has a widespread but scattered distribution throughout most of South Australia. In Western Australia, the species is not present in the far north or the south-east but is prevalent throughout the mid-latitudes of the state. In the Northern Territory, the species is restricted to the south of the state, around the Simpson Desert and the MacDonnell Ranges. In Queensland the species is restricted to inland south-western regions. In Victoria, the species is restricted to the mallee regions in the north west of the state.<ref name=HANZAB/> In New South Wales the species is only known to occur in the far west, in several core populations including Broken Hill, Tibooburra, Penarie and Nearie Lake Nature Reserve.<ref name=NSWOEH>{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedSpeciesApp/profile.aspx?id=10721|title=Redthroat - profile|last=|first= |date=|website=NSW Government, Office of Environment and Heritage|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe species is thought to be mostly sedentary, with no evidence to suggest seasonal migration. Individuals recaptured after banding have all been found within <10&nbsp;km of the banding site.<ref name=HANZAB/>\n\n== Habitat ==\nThe habitat of the redthroat consists primarily of arid and semi-arid regions of inland Australia, but it also occupies some coastal areas, as well as plains and rangelands. Communities it favours are most often acacia and chenopod shrublands. These communities are usually characterised by an overstory of mulga (''[[Acacia aneura]]''), red mulga (''[[Acacia cyperophylla|A. cyperophylla]]'') or lacewood (''A. shirleyi'') with an understory of saltbush (''[[Atriplex]] sp''.), bluebush (''[[Chenopodium]] sp.)'' or emu bush (''[[Eremophila (plant)|Eremophila]] sp.)''.<ref name=HANZAB/> However, in some areas the species is known to occur in [[Mallee (habit)|mallee]] with a diverse understory, semi-arid woodlands, [[banksia]] and [[Leptospermum|tea tree]] thickets and shrublands with an overstory of [[Callitris glaucophylla|white cypress]].<ref name=NSWOEH/> The consistent feature among these habitats appears to be the presence of a complex understory which provides suitable foraging and nesting resources for this shy, mostly ground-dwelling species.\n\n== Diet and foraging behaviour ==\nRedthroats are [[omnivore]]s with a diet consisting of seeds from grasses and shrubs as well as a broad variety of invertebrates such as spiders, molluscs and insects.<ref name=HANZAB/> Observations of redthroat foraging behaviour found that the species predominantly forages at heights of less than 1m (73% of observations) and was not observed foraging at heights greater than 3m.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=WJ|last2=Wooler|first2=RD|date=2001|title=The structure and dynamics of an assemblage of small birds in a semi-arid eucalypt woodland in south-western Australia|journal=Emu |volume=101 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1071/MU00062}}</ref> This study found that redthroats feed mostly by pouncing on prey from the ground or [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] in low vegetation, with very few instances of hunting on the wing.<ref name=\":3\" /> Another study of foraging behaviour found that all observations of foraging occurred on the ground (<0.1 m), using a combination of gleaning and probing.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Recher |first=HF|last2=Davis |first2=WD |date=2002 |title=Foraging profile of a Salmon Gum woodland avifauna in Western Australia|url= http://www.rswa.org.au/publications/Journal/85(2)/recher85(2).pdf |journal= Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia |volume=85 |pages=103\u2013111}}</ref>\n\n== Breeding and nesting ==\nBreeding mostly occurs between June\u2013December with some geographic variation in timing. Little is known about sexual behaviour, although the species appears to breed in pairs. Nests are relatively large for a bird of its size (9\u201314&nbsp;cm), often domed, spherical or domed with a round entrance near the top (2.5\u20134&nbsp;cm). Usually constructed of bark strips and bark fibre, often lined with feathers, fur or soft plant material. Nests are located on or close to the ground among shrubs, grass tussocks, at the base of trees, in fallen logs or in small depressions. Two to four eggs are laid and the female is solely responsible for incubating the eggs. The redthroat and the closely related speckled warbler are the only members of the acanthizids which have a solid coloured chocolate brown egg.<ref name=Gardner/> Furthermore, the redthroat (and the speckled warbler) are the primary host species of some [[brood parasite]]s such as the [[black-eared cuckoo]] and [[fan-tailed cuckoo]] which remove redthroat eggs from the nest and lay their own similar looking eggs.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=hhhRGJNqQhIC&pg=PA244 |title=The Avian Brood Parasites: Deception at the Nest|last=Johnsgard |first=Paul A.|date=1997-11-06 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195354997 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=HANZAB/>\n\n==Conservation status==\nPopulations of redthroats have declined in many areas throughout Australia and the species is subject to many threatening processes.

The ongoing impacts of land clearing, noxious weeds, introduced herbivore and introduced predators are likely to cause further declines throughout the species range, which may warrant further environmental protection measures.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* Del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Christie D.
