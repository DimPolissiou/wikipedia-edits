The first store opened on 24 November 1979 in [[Munich]]. By 1985, nine other stores had opened near Munich. \n\nIn 1988 Kaufhof Warenhaus AG acquired a 54 percent majority in the holding company of the media stores founded in 1979.

In 1996 Kaufhof Holding, [[Metro Cash & Carry]], Deutsche SB-Kauf AG and the German department store Asko AG (where a Metro holding company had previously each held shares) merged and formed Metro AG.

(''Go on, choose with your heart'')\n|}\n\n===2006 World Cup advertising campaign===\n\nPrior to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], Media Markt launched a campaign, claiming to be the \"best fan supplier\" (\"''Bester Fanausr\u00fcster''\"), with commercials showing international football fans shopping at Media Markt, showing exaggerated stereotypes of the participating countries, and making fun of the [[Austria national football team|Austria]] team, which did  not qualify. This included a French seductress, Dutch fans smoking [[marijuana]] in caravans, or a Saudi haggling - to pay more. German fans were portrayed with big bellies, asking for refrigerators to keep their beer cool, rather than looking for a new TV set.\n\nAn additional series of ads, promoting a rebate of \u20ac10 for each goal Germany scores (except [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-outs]]), showed international soccer fans begging the Germans to score as many goals as possible - against their own team.\n\nWhen the Netherlands lost to Portugal, Media Markt used a quote from a 1980s show featuring [[Rudi Carrell]], a Dutchman who was a long-time TV celebrity in Germany, to express ''[[Schadenfreude]]''. A [[FIFA World Cup Trophy|World Cup trophy]] is shown to grieving Dutch fans in their caravan with the comment \"This would have been your prize!\".\n\n===Polish advertising===\n[[File:Bydgoszcz Media Markt ulica Jagiello\u0144ska.jpg|thumb|350px|Media Markt store in Bydgoszcz, Poland]]\nIn March 2006, the \"Poland version\" showed moustache-wearing Polish customers praising the shop for \"prices deep like Polish soul\" before hugging the German sales managers, who looked quite uncomfortable in the bear hugs. Afterwards, one of the Germans pointed out that his watch was still there, and that \"The Pole is an honest person, after all\". Then, the three men are shown to be missing their trousers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEjOWqXAI7Y |title=Media Markt nie dla Polak\u00f3w |publisher=Youtube.com |date=31 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThis commercial caused a scandal in Poland, for the widely known German stereotype of Poles being thieves. Media Markt argued that the advertisements also made fun of other national clich\u00e9s, including Germans, and none of the other clich\u00e9s were perceived as negative towards the people they presented. Its aim was to exaggerate the clich\u00e9 of the Polish thief to dismiss it as unjustified prejudice, Media Markt claimed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.msn.de/finanzen/news/proteste-aus-polen_nid_26829.html |title=Proteste aus Polen - Media Markt zieht Fernseh-Werbung zur\u00fcck |publisher=Focus.msn.de |date=28 March 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516121929/focus.msn.de/finanzen/news/proteste-aus-polen_nid_26829.html |archive-date=16 May 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe store apologised and withdrew the advert after their Polish branch asked to do so, following protests in Poland, a call from the Polish embassy in Berlin and protests from German [[Polish diaspora|Polonia]].\n\n===Portuguese advertising===\n\nIn January 2008 Media Markt launched a campaign presenting a fictitious country called \"Dumb Land\", where several characters with [[Eastern Europe]]an accents were presented as being from this country, which even has an anthem. A central theme of this campaign presented a [[Boy Scout]] as an idiot. This really upset people as many consider Scouts to be responsible and valued members of society. An online petition was created to persuade Media Markt to withdraw the campaign and to offer a public apology. Due to this petition and a lot of pressure from the Scouting movement, Media Markt had to remove the Boy Scout from their campaign, including TV and radio ads.\n\n===Turkish advertising===\n\nTurkish Union Association in [[Eski\u015fehir]], [[Turkey]] motivated suspension of an advertisement campaign by the group on grounds that Media Markt \"[[Article 301 (Turkish Penal Code)|insulted Turkishness]]\" by depicting consumers that purchased overpriced merchandise with animal heads. A ban of the advertisements lasted for 3 months in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825185814/http://www.hurriyetdailynew.com/n.php?n=did-animals-really-insult-turkishness-2009-10-22 |title=Ads criticized for insulting Turkishness with animal heads on humans |publisher=Hurriyetdailynews.com |date=22 October 2009 |accessdate=2015-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825185814/http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=did-animals-really-insult-turkishness-2009-10-22 |archive-date=25 August 2010}}</ref> There have been many accusations on their official Facebook fan page about their false product advertisements in Turkey.\n\n=== Saubillig ===\n\nA former German campaign played on the German expression \"saubillig\" which means extremely cheap, but literally \"sow (female pig) cheap\". ''Sau-'' is a common emphasising prefix in colloquial German. Inside the stores the entrances were signposted as \"Schweingang\" = wordplay on the word Eingang (Entrance) and Schwein (pig), and the exit as \"Sausgang\" = wordplay on the word Ausgang (Exit) and the German word for sow (Sau) - the female pig.\n\n== Controversies ==\n=== Misleading advertising methods ===\n==== Article without VAT ====\nMedia Markt promised in 2005 a promotion to sell items \"without [[VAT]]\" (with a discount equal to VAT). In fact, the prices for these items had previously been increased in order to actually achieve the normal price. A competitor sued a branch in Mannheim.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ftd.de/unternehmen/handel_dienstleister/129743.html |title=Media-Markt mogelte bei Mehrwertsteuer |publisher=ftd.de |date=8 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224021702/http://www.ftd.de/unternehmen/handel_dienstleister/129743.html |archive-date=24 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n==== Decoy offers ====\nThe MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group has made [[bait-and-switch]] in the past : articles were advertised extensively at extremely low prices, but were sold out within a very short time. According to case law on the law against unfair competition(UWG) advertised special offers must be available for at least two days. Consumer advocates criticized that this was often not guaranteed at Media Markt and Saturn. The group denied that; there were only a few exceptions despite large stocks. It is generally difficult to provide concrete evidence of such cases, since consumer protection groups do not have access to the delivery dates of the companies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/lockvogel-angebote-gericht-knoepft-sich-media-markt-werbung-vor-a-481788.html |title=Gericht kn\u00f6pft sich Media-Markt-Werbung vor |publisher=spiegel.de |date=9 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n==== Price Guarantee  ====\nIn 2005, samples from the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] in the Munich area showed that Media Markt or Saturn stores were more expensive in 15 out of 21 cases than local competitors. In Berlin they were 11 out of 21 cases. The MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group countered the allegations with a \"price guarantee\" that promised buyers a refund of the price difference if they found the product at a cheaper price in another shop.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/unternehmen/einzelhandel-die-trickser-vom-media-markt-1303977.html |title=Die Trickser vom Media-Markt |publisher=faz.net |date=9 January 2006}}</ref>\n\n==== 0 -% - financing ====\nIn 2013, 0% financing from the Spanish bank [[Banco Santander]] was criticized. A credit loss insurance that costs 10% is taken out only on a note in the small print.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://helpv2.orf.at/stories/1714801/index.html |title=Kreditversicherung wider Willen |publisher=orf.at |date=23 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The exclusive sale of Intel PCs ===\nAccording to research published by the [[Financial Times]] Germany in 2008, the MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group committed to [[Intel]] in 1999 to only sell PCs with Intel processors. The holding company received 85 million euros in purchase discounts and advertising grants from Intel in 2007 alone. The European antitrust authorities investigated the distortion of competition. Intel was fined 1.06 billion euros in May 2009 by the European Competition Commission for these and other antitrust violations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/wettbewerbsverstoesse-intels-praktiken-schockieren-kartellrechtler-a-624575.html |title=Intels Praktiken schockieren Kartellrechtler |publisher=spiegel.de |date=13 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe retail chain was moved by Intel's discount system to have only insignificant or no computers with [[AMD]] processors in the range. According to the [[European Commission]], Intel has made direct and indirect payments to MSH since 1997. The payments were subject to the condition that, if possible, only offer Intel systems.\n\n=== Body searches ===\n\nIn 2014, in [[Krems an der Donau]] in [[Lower Austria]], theft of the Media Markt, which is said to have been committed by employees, not only carried out bag checks, as is common in many companies, but also body searches on all employees. The unions see this as a violation of [[human dignity]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://noe.orf.at/v2/news/stories/2624102/ |title=Leibesvisitation bei Mitarbeitern |publisher=orf.at |date=7 January 2014}}</ref> As a consequence, employees of other branches in Austria reported this procedure.

(''Go on, choose with your heart'')\n|}\n\n===2006 World Cup advertising campaign===\n\nPrior to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], Media Markt launched a campaign, claiming to be the \"best fan supplier\" (\"''Bester Fanausr\u00fcster''\"), with commercials showing international football fans shopping at Media Markt, showing exaggerated stereotypes of the participating countries, and making fun of the [[Austria national football team|Austria]] team, which did  not qualify. This included a French seductress, Dutch fans smoking [[marijuana]] in caravans, or a Saudi haggling - to pay more. German fans were portrayed with big bellies, asking for refrigerators to keep their beer cool, rather than looking for a new TV set.\n\nAn additional series of ads, promoting a rebate of \u20ac10 for each goal Germany scores (except [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-outs]]), showed international soccer fans begging the Germans to score as many goals as possible - against their own team.\n\nWhen the Netherlands lost to Portugal, Media Markt used a quote from a 1980s show featuring [[Rudi Carrell]], a Dutchman who was a long-time TV celebrity in Germany, to express ''[[Schadenfreude]]''. A [[FIFA World Cup Trophy|World Cup trophy]] is shown to grieving Dutch fans in their caravan with the comment \"This would have been your prize!\".\n\n===Polish advertising===\n[[File:Bydgoszcz Media Markt ulica Jagiello\u0144ska.jpg|thumb|350px|Media Markt store in Bydgoszcz, Poland]]\nIn March 2006, the \"Poland version\" showed moustache-wearing Polish customers praising the shop for \"prices deep like Polish soul\" before hugging the German sales managers, who looked quite uncomfortable in the bear hugs. Afterwards, one of the Germans pointed out that his watch was still there, and that \"The Pole is an honest person, after all\". Then, the three men are shown to be missing their trousers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEjOWqXAI7Y |title=Media Markt nie dla Polak\u00f3w |publisher=Youtube.com |date=31 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThis commercial caused a scandal in Poland, for the widely known German stereotype of Poles being thieves. Media Markt argued that the advertisements also made fun of other national clich\u00e9s, including Germans, and none of the other clich\u00e9s were perceived as negative towards the people they presented. Its aim was to exaggerate the clich\u00e9 of the Polish thief to dismiss it as unjustified prejudice, Media Markt claimed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.msn.de/finanzen/news/proteste-aus-polen_nid_26829.html |title=Proteste aus Polen - Media Markt zieht Fernseh-Werbung zur\u00fcck |publisher=Focus.msn.de |date=28 March 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516121929/focus.msn.de/finanzen/news/proteste-aus-polen_nid_26829.html |archive-date=16 May 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe store apologised and withdrew the advert after their Polish branch asked to do so, following protests in Poland, a call from the Polish embassy in Berlin and protests from German [[Polish diaspora|Polonia]].\n\n===Portuguese advertising===\n\nIn January 2008 Media Markt launched a campaign presenting a fictitious country called \"Dumb Land\", where several characters with [[Eastern Europe]]an accents were presented as being from this country, which even has an anthem. A central theme of this campaign presented a [[Boy Scout]] as an idiot. This really upset people as many consider Scouts to be responsible and valued members of society. An online petition was created to persuade Media Markt to withdraw the campaign and to offer a public apology. Due to this petition and a lot of pressure from the Scouting movement, Media Markt had to remove the Boy Scout from their campaign, including TV and radio ads.\n\n===Turkish advertising===\n\nTurkish Union Association in [[Eski\u015fehir]], [[Turkey]] motivated suspension of an advertisement campaign by the group on grounds that Media Markt \"[[Article 301 (Turkish Penal Code)|insulted Turkishness]]\" by depicting consumers that purchased overpriced merchandise with animal heads. A ban of the advertisements lasted for 3 months in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825185814/http://www.hurriyetdailynew.com/n.php?n=did-animals-really-insult-turkishness-2009-10-22 |title=Ads criticized for insulting Turkishness with animal heads on humans |publisher=Hurriyetdailynews.com |date=22 October 2009 |accessdate=2015-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825185814/http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=did-animals-really-insult-turkishness-2009-10-22 |archive-date=25 August 2010}}</ref> There have been many accusations on their official Facebook fan page about their false product advertisements in Turkey.\n\n=== Saubillig ===\n\nA former German campaign played on the German expression \"saubillig\" which means extremely cheap, but literally \"sow (female pig) cheap\". ''Sau-'' is a common emphasising prefix in colloquial German. Inside the stores the entrances were signposted as \"Schweingang\" = wordplay on the word Eingang (Entrance) and Schwein (pig), and the exit as \"Sausgang\" = wordplay on the word Ausgang (Exit) and the German word for sow (Sau) - the female pig.\n\n== Controversies ==\n=== Misleading advertising methods ===\n==== Article without VAT ====\nMedia Markt promised in 2005 a promotion to sell items \"without [[VAT]]\" (with a discount equal to VAT). In fact, the prices for these items had previously been increased in order to actually achieve the normal price. A competitor sued a branch in Mannheim.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ftd.de/unternehmen/handel_dienstleister/129743.html |title=Media-Markt mogelte bei Mehrwertsteuer |publisher=ftd.de |date=8 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224021702/http://www.ftd.de/unternehmen/handel_dienstleister/129743.html |archive-date=24 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n==== Decoy offers ====\nThe MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group has made [[bait-and-switch]] in the past : articles were advertised extensively at extremely low prices, but were sold out within a very short time. According to case law on the law against unfair competition(UWG) advertised special offers must be available for at least two days. Consumer advocates criticized that this was often not guaranteed at Media Markt and Saturn. The group denied that; there were only a few exceptions despite large stocks. It is generally difficult to provide concrete evidence of such cases, since consumer protection groups do not have access to the delivery dates of the companies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/lockvogel-angebote-gericht-knoepft-sich-media-markt-werbung-vor-a-481788.html |title=Gericht kn\u00f6pft sich Media-Markt-Werbung vor |publisher=spiegel.de |date=9 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n==== Price Guarantee  ====\nIn 2005, samples from the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] in the Munich area showed that Media Markt or Saturn stores were more expensive in 15 out of 21 cases than local competitors. In Berlin they were 11 out of 21 cases. The MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group countered the allegations with a \"price guarantee\" that promised buyers a refund of the price difference if they found the product at a cheaper price in another shop.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/unternehmen/einzelhandel-die-trickser-vom-media-markt-1303977.html |title=Die Trickser vom Media-Markt |publisher=faz.net |date=9 January 2006}}</ref>\n\n==== 0 -% - financing ====\nIn 2013, 0% financing from the Spanish bank [[Banco Santander]] was criticized. A credit loss insurance that costs 10% is taken out only on a note in the small print.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://helpv2.orf.at/stories/1714801/index.html |title=Kreditversicherung wider Willen |publisher=orf.at |date=23 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The exclusive sale of Intel PCs ===\nAccording to research published by the [[Financial Times]] Germany in 2008, the MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group committed to [[Intel]] in 1999 to only sell PCs with Intel processors. The holding company received 85 million euros in purchase discounts and advertising grants from Intel in 2007 alone. The European antitrust authorities investigated the distortion of competition. Intel was fined 1.06 billion euros in May 2009 by the European Competition Commission for these and other antitrust violations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/wettbewerbsverstoesse-intels-praktiken-schockieren-kartellrechtler-a-624575.html |title=Intels Praktiken schockieren Kartellrechtler |publisher=spiegel.de |date=13 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe retail chain was moved by Intel's discount system to have only insignificant or no computers with [[AMD]] processors in the range. According to the [[European Commission]], Intel has made direct and indirect payments to MSH since 1997. The payments were subject to the condition that, if possible, only offer Intel systems.\n\n=== Body searches ===\n\nIn 2014, in [[Krems an der Donau]] in [[Lower Austria]], theft of the Media Markt, which is said to have been committed by employees, not only carried out bag checks, as is common in many companies, but also body searches on all employees. The unions see this as a violation of [[human dignity]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://noe.orf.at/v2/news/stories/2624102/ |title=Leibesvisitation bei Mitarbeitern |publisher=orf.at |date=7 January 2014}}</ref> As a consequence, employees of other branches in Austria reported this procedure.

Tamang believe in Buddhism, and famously said that 90 percent of Tamang follow Buddhism as their religion. Their language comes from Tibeto-Burman language family. They follow the Chinese lunar calendar of the 12-year cycle and their typical song-dance which is famously known as Tamang selo, which include the songs of humor and wit, satire, joy and sorrow.

Ella promises to follow her mother's dying wish: to have courage and be kind. Years later, Ella's father marries Lady Tremaine, who has two unpleasant daughters, Drisella and Anastasia. Ella's father leaves on business, and Lady Tremaine reveals her cruel and jealous nature, pushing Ella to give up her bedroom to the stepsisters and move to the attic. When Ella's father unexpectedly dies, Lady Tremaine dismisses the household staff to save money and forces all their chores on Ella. Seeing Ella's face covered in [[cinders]] after sleeping by the fireplace, her step-family mockingly dubs her \"Cinderella\".\n\nDistraught, Ella rides off into the woods where she happens to encounter Kit, the [[crown prince]], hunting. He hides that he is a prince and instead introduces himself as a palace apprentice. Ella and Kit take a liking to each other, but they part without him learning her name. The King discovers he has little time left to live, and urges Kit to take a princess as his bride at the upcoming royal ball. Kit persuades his father to also invite every eligible maiden in the kingdom, hoping to see Ella again.\n\nOn the night of the ball, Ella tries to join her step-family, wearing her mother\u2019s old gown that she has refashioned, but Lady Tremaine and Drisella tear it to shreds and leave without her. Ella runs into the garden in tears and meets an old beggar woman, who reveals herself to be Ella's Fairy Godmother. She magically transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, mice into horses, lizards into footmen, and a goose into the coachman. She then transforms Ella's ripped gown into a beautiful ballgown, complete with a pair of glass slippers. As Ella departs, the Fairy Godmother warns her the spell will end at the last stroke of midnight, and casts a final spell to prevent Ella's stepfamily from recognizing her.\n\nAt the ball, the entire court is entranced by Ella. She dances with Kit, much to the chagrin of the Grand Duke who has already promised Kit to Princess Chelina of Zaragoza, which Lady Tremaine overhears. Though surprised at Kit's true identity, Ella and the prince bond. Before Ella can tell Kit her name, the clock chimes midnight and she flees the palace, losing one of her slippers. Pursued by the Grand Duke and his men, Ella manages to escape home before the final stroke of midnight; the spell dissipates and everything reverts back to its true form. Ella hides the remaining slipper under her bedroom floorboards.\n\nThe King dies, but not before giving his son permission to marry Ella. Now King, Kit issues a royal proclamation professing his love for the \u201cmystery princess\u201d and requests she present herself. Ella hurries to retrieve the glass slipper to prove her identity, only to find it with her stepmother. Having deduced that Ella is the mystery princess, Lady Tremaine attempts to blackmail Ella to make her head of the royal household and find respectable husbands for her stepsisters, in exchange for giving Ella's hand in marriage to Kit. Ella refuses, and Lady Tremaine smashes the slipper and locks Ella in the attic. She brings the shattered remains of the slipper to the Grand Duke, who agrees to make her a [[countess]] and secure marriages for her daughters in exchange for keeping Ella hidden.\n\nThe Grand Duke and the Captain of the guards lead the search for the mystery princess by trying the slipper on every woman in the kingdom, but it refuses to fit anyone. At the Tremaine estate, the shoe fits neither stepsister; the company prepares to depart, but hear Ella singing ''[[Lavender's Blue]]''. The Grand Duke urges them to leave, but Kit, who has secretly accompanied them, commands the Captain to investigate. The slipper fits Ella, and she and Kit promise to accept one another for who they truly are. As they leave, Ella forgives her stepmother. Soon after, Lady Tremaine, her daughters, and the Grand Duke leave the kingdom, never to return.\n\nElla and Kit marry and become the kingdom's most beloved monarchs, ruling with the same courage and kindness that Ella had promised her mother, and live happily ever after.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- As shown in the credits, some names differ in dialogue. -->\n\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as [[Lady

Pictures president of production [[Sean Bailey]], studio chairman [[Alan F.

Powell began working on concepts for the characters' looks almost two years before principal photography began in the summer of 2013. Powell said she was aiming for the look of \"a nineteenth-century period film made in the 1940s or 1950s.\"<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/02/cinderella-wedding-gown-first-look|title=First Look: The Making of Cinderella's Wedding Gown|last=Chi|first=Paul|website=Vanity Fair|date=February 11, 2015|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Vogue\" />\n\nFor the Fairy Godmother, Powell took a major departure from the animated film of the 1950s, instead giving actress [[Helena Bonham Carter]] an opulent white ballgown, featuring fairy wings, puff sleeves and a very full skirt. The skirt also had battery lights underneath it, which Helena said caused issues when filming scenes as the batteries would run low quite quickly.\nFor the stepmother and stepsisters, Powell had a very clear idea about the look; \"They are meant to be totally ridiculous on the outside\u2014a bit too much and overdone\u2014and ugly on the inside.\"<ref name=\"Vogue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/4463911/cinderella-movie-2015-sandy-powell-costume-designer/|title=What Would Cinderella Wear? Costuming Lily James and Cate Blanchett in Kenneth Branagh's Forthcoming Film|date=November 19, 2014|first=Leslie|last=Camhi|website=Vogue|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref> The silhouette of the prince came from the original animation, however she created a more fitted look and less masculine colors. Some of the prince costumes were dyed to accentuate Madden's eyes.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nThe ball gown was inspired by the Disney animated film in its color and shape; \"The gown had to look lovely when she dances and runs away from the ball. I wanted her to look like she was floating, like a watercolor painting.\"<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" /> The dress was made with more than a dozen fine layers of fabric, a corset and a petticoat. Nine versions of the Cinderella gown were designed, each with more than 270 yards of fabric and 10,000 crystals. It took 18 tailors and 500 hours to make each dress.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nThe wedding dress was another difficult project. \"Creating the wedding dress was a challenge. Rather than try to make something even better than the ball gown, I had to do something completely different and simple... I wanted the whole effect to be ephemeral and fine, so we went with an extreme-lined shaped bodice with a long train\", said Powell. It took 16 people and 550 hours to complete the silk-organza, hand painted dress. While the crew photographed James in the gown, the actress stood too close to an electric heater and the dress caught on fire; the top layer of the dress had to be redone because only one wedding dress was created due to time and budget constraints.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nFor the glass slipper, Powell took inspiration from a 1950s shoe she saw in a museum. Since glass does not sparkle, they decided to use crystal instead. [[Swarovski]] partnered with Disney to make the famous shoe. Powell went directly to Swarovski headquarters in [[Austria]] to meet the product developers. It took 6 digital renderings of the shoes until they found the right one for the film. Swarovski made eight pairs of crystal shoes for the film, though none were actually wearable. Consequently, the leather shoes James wore on set had to be digitally altered into crystal. Alongside the slipper, Swarovski provided more than 7&nbsp;million crystals that were used in costumes and 100 tiaras for the ball scene.<ref>{{cite

The film is based on the [[Cinderella|eponymous folk tale]] and is a [[live action]] adaptation of [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Cinderella (1950 film)|1950 animated film of the same name]].<ref name=PressKit>{{cite web|title=Cinderella: Press Release|url=http://www.wdsmediafile.com/media/Cinderella/writen-material/Cinderella54dc0b6c538d2.pdf|website=The Walt Disney Company|publisher=The Walt Disney Studios|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref> It features [[Lily James]] as the [[Cinderella (Disney character)|eponymous character]], with [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Richard Madden]], [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Holliday Grainger]], [[Derek Jacobi]], and [[Helena Bonham Carter]].\n\nDevelopment for a [[List of Disney live-action remakes of animated films|live-action reimagining]] of the original animated film began in May 2010, with producer [[Simon Kinberg]] attached to the project. In late January 2013, Branagh signed on to direct, with Weitz hired to revise a script from [[Aline Brosh McKenna]]. In November 2012, casting began with Blanchett being the first to sign on; James was eventually cast in the titular role in April 2013. [[Principal photography]] began at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire, England]] on September 23, 2013, and ended on December 14.\n\n''Cinderella'' had its world premiere on February 13, 2015, at the [[65th Berlin International Film Festival]] and was released theatrically in the United States on March 13, 2015, and in the United Kingdom on March 27 in standard and [[IMAX]] formats by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]]. It grossed over $542&nbsp;million worldwide, becoming Branagh's highest-grossing film to date as a director. The film received generally  positive reviews from critics, with many praising the performances (particularly James, Blanchett, and Bonham Carter), Branagh's direction, musical score, costume design, production values, and faithfulness to the original animated film. It received a nomination at the [[88th Academy Awards]], [[21st Critics' Choice Awards]] and [[69th British Academy Film Awards]], all for costume design. \n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nElla and her parents live a humble but happy life until her mother falls ill. Ella promises to follow her mother's dying wish: to have courage and be kind. Years later, Ella's father marries Lady Tremaine, who has two unpleasant daughters, Drisella and Anastasia. Ella's father leaves on business, and Lady Tremaine reveals her cruel and jealous nature, pushing Ella to give up her bedroom to the stepsisters and move to the attic. When Ella's father unexpectedly dies, Lady Tremaine dismisses the household staff to save money and forces all their chores on Ella. Seeing Ella's face covered in [[cinders]] after sleeping by the fireplace, her step-family mockingly dubs her \"Cinderella\".\n\nDistraught, Ella rides off into the woods where she happens to encounter Kit, the [[crown prince]], hunting. He hides that he is a prince and instead introduces himself as a palace apprentice. Ella and Kit take a liking to each other, but they part without him learning her name. The King discovers he has little time left to live, and urges Kit to take a princess as his bride at the upcoming royal ball. Kit persuades his father to also invite every eligible maiden in the kingdom, hoping to see Ella again.\n\nOn the night of the ball, Ella tries to join her step-family, wearing her mother\u2019s old gown that she has refashioned, but Lady Tremaine and Drisella tear it to shreds and leave without her. Ella runs into the garden in tears and meets an old beggar woman, who reveals herself to be Ella's Fairy Godmother. She magically transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, mice into horses, lizards into footmen, and a goose into the coachman. She then transforms Ella's ripped gown into a beautiful ballgown, complete with a pair of glass slippers. As Ella departs, the Fairy Godmother warns her the spell will end at the last stroke of midnight, and casts a final spell to prevent Ella's stepfamily from recognizing her.\n\nAt the ball, the entire court is entranced by Ella. She dances with Kit, much to the chagrin of the Grand Duke who has already promised Kit to Princess Chelina of Zaragoza, which Lady Tremaine overhears. Though surprised at Kit's true identity, Ella and the prince bond. Before Ella can tell Kit her name, the clock chimes midnight and she flees the palace, losing one of her slippers. Pursued by the Grand Duke and his men, Ella manages to escape home before the final stroke of midnight; the spell dissipates and everything reverts back to its true form. Ella hides the remaining slipper under her bedroom floorboards.\n\nThe King dies, but not before giving his son permission to marry Ella. Now King, Kit issues a royal proclamation professing his love for the \u201cmystery princess\u201d and requests she present herself. Ella hurries to retrieve the glass slipper to prove her identity, only to find it with her stepmother. Having deduced that Ella is the mystery princess, Lady Tremaine attempts to blackmail Ella to make her head of the royal household and find respectable husbands for her stepsisters, in exchange for giving Ella's hand in marriage to Kit. Ella refuses, and Lady Tremaine smashes the slipper and locks Ella in the attic. She brings the shattered remains of the slipper to the Grand Duke, who agrees to make her a [[countess]] and secure marriages for her daughters in exchange for keeping Ella hidden.\n\nThe Grand Duke and the Captain of the guards lead the search for the mystery princess by trying the slipper on every woman in the kingdom, but it refuses to fit anyone. At the Tremaine estate, the shoe fits neither stepsister; the company prepares to depart, but hear Ella singing ''[[Lavender's Blue]]''. The Grand Duke urges them to leave, but Kit, who has secretly accompanied them, commands the Captain to investigate. The slipper fits Ella, and she and Kit promise to accept one another for who they truly are. As they leave, Ella forgives her stepmother. Soon after, Lady Tremaine, her daughters, and the Grand Duke leave the kingdom, never to return.\n\nElla and Kit marry and become the kingdom's most beloved monarchs, ruling with the same courage and kindness that Ella had promised her mother, and live happily ever after.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- As shown in the credits, some names differ in dialogue. -->\n\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as [[Lady

Pictures president of production [[Sean Bailey]], studio chairman [[Alan F. Horn]] wished to make the film the \"definitive ''Cinderella'' for generations to come,\" and told him that \"if you need to spend a little more, spend it, to make sure it's one for the time capsule.\"<ref name=\"Rainey\">{{cite news|last1=Rainey|first1=James|title=Disney's Alan Horn Uses Low-Key Approach, Keen Creative Vision to Find Hits of the Future|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/alan-horn-disney-chairman-1201749971/|accessdate=December 14, 2016|work=Variety|publisher=Variety Media|date=April 11, 2016|location=Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\n===Costumes===\nThree-time Oscar-winning costume designer [[Sandy Powell (costume designer)|Sandy Powell]] was in charge of the costumes for the film. Powell began working on concepts for the characters' looks almost two years before principal photography began in the summer of 2013. Powell said she was aiming for the look of \"a nineteenth-century period film made in the 1940s or 1950s.\"<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/02/cinderella-wedding-gown-first-look|title=First Look: The Making of Cinderella's Wedding Gown|last=Chi|first=Paul|website=Vanity Fair|date=February 11, 2015|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Vogue\" />\n\nFor the Fairy Godmother, Powell took a major departure from the animated film of the 1950s, instead giving actress [[Helena Bonham Carter]] an opulent white ballgown, featuring fairy wings, puff sleeves and a very full skirt. The skirt also had battery lights underneath it, which Helena said caused issues when filming scenes as the batteries would run low quite quickly.\nFor the stepmother and stepsisters, Powell had a very clear idea about the look; \"They are meant to be totally ridiculous on the outside\u2014a bit too much and overdone\u2014and ugly on the inside.\"<ref name=\"Vogue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/4463911/cinderella-movie-2015-sandy-powell-costume-designer/|title=What Would Cinderella Wear? Costuming Lily James and Cate Blanchett in Kenneth Branagh's Forthcoming Film|date=November 19, 2014|first=Leslie|last=Camhi|website=Vogue|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref> The silhouette of the prince came from the original animation, however she created a more fitted look and less masculine colors. Some of the prince costumes were dyed to accentuate Madden's eyes.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nThe ball gown was inspired by the Disney animated film in its color and shape; \"The gown had to look lovely when she dances and runs away from the ball. I wanted her to look like she was floating, like a watercolor painting.\"<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" /> The dress was made with more than a dozen fine layers of fabric, a corset and a petticoat. Nine versions of the Cinderella gown were designed, each with more than 270 yards of fabric and 10,000 crystals. It took 18 tailors and 500 hours to make each dress.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nThe wedding dress was another difficult project. \"Creating the wedding dress was a challenge. Rather than try to make something even better than the ball gown, I had to do something completely different and simple... I wanted the whole effect to be ephemeral and fine, so we went with an extreme-lined shaped bodice with a long train\", said Powell. It took 16 people and 550 hours to complete the silk-organza, hand painted dress. While the crew photographed James in the gown, the actress stood too close to an electric heater and the dress caught on fire; the top layer of the dress had to be redone because only one wedding dress was created due to time and budget constraints.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nFor the glass slipper, Powell took inspiration from a 1950s shoe she saw in a museum. Since glass does not sparkle, they decided to use crystal instead. [[Swarovski]] partnered with Disney to make the famous shoe. Powell went directly to Swarovski headquarters in [[Austria]] to meet the product developers. It took 6 digital renderings of the shoes until they found the right one for the film. Swarovski made eight pairs of crystal shoes for the film, though none were actually wearable. Consequently, the leather shoes James wore on set had to be digitally altered into crystal. Alongside the slipper, Swarovski provided more than 7&nbsp;million crystals that were used in costumes and 100 tiaras for the ball scene.<ref>{{cite

He distinguished himself in several raids against the [[Byzantine Empire]], but his great influence and authority in Syria caused Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] to imprison him in 803. Released in 809, he was dispatched in 812 by Caliph [[al-Amin]] to gather troops against his brother [[al-Ma'mun]] in the ongoing civil war between the two brothers, but died of an illness.\n\n==Biography==\nAbd al-Malik's family were among the most powerful clans during the early Abbasid era. They played an important role in the final overthrow of the [[Umayyads]] in [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], which thereafter became their particular power base. He was the nephew of Abdallah ibn Ali, the first Abbasid governor of Syria, and a son of [[Salih ibn Ali]] the first Abbasid governor of [[Egypt in the Middle Ages|Egypt]] and successor of Abdallah in Syria after the latter staged a failed uprising in 754. Abd al-Malik's elder brothers [[al-Fadl ibn Salih]] and [[Ibrahim ibn Salih]] also served as governors in Syria and Egypt.<ref>{{harvnb|Cobb|2001|pp=23\u201328}}.</ref> From his father's side, he was a cousin of Caliphs [[al-Saffah]] (r. 750\u2013754) and [[al-Mansur]] (r. 754\u2013775).<ref name=\"Zetterst\u00e9en77\u201378\">{{harvnb|Zetterst\u00e9en|1960|pp=77\u201378}}.</ref> His mother was one of the [[concubine]]s of the last Umayyad Caliph, [[Marwan II]] (r. 744\u2013750). After Marwan's death, she was bought by Salih. Some sources alleged that she was already pregnant at the time, which would mean that Abd al-Malik was a son of Marwan II.<ref>{{harvnb|Slane|1843|p=316}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Syria in the 9th century.svg|thumb|right|250px|Syria (''[[Bilad al-Sham]]'') and its provinces under the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]]]\nUnder [[Harun al-Rashid]] (r. 786\u2013809), Abd al-Malik held his first major commands: from c. 789 to 793, he was governor of the strategically critical ''[[jund Qinnasrin]]'' and of the newly created ''jund'' of ''[[al-'Awasim]]'', which comprised the Caliphate's borderlands with the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref name=\"Cobb28\">{{harvnb|Cobb|2001|p=28}}.</ref> From this position, he led expeditions into Byzantine [[Asia Minor]] in 790/791 and possibly also in 792/793, when his son Abd ar-Rahman captured the fortress of Thebasa.<ref name=\"Zetterst\u00e9en77\u201378\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Lilie|1996|p=158}}.</ref>\n\nIn 792, after the death of Ibrahim, Abd al-Malik became the head of his clan, and in 794 he was appointed as governor of the [[Jund Dimashq|province of Damascus]], with his brother Abdallah ibn Salih succeeding him in the border.<ref name=\"Cobb28\"/> During the next couple of years, he also served briefly as governor of [[Medina]] and Egypt,<ref name=\"Zetterst\u00e9en77\u201378\"/> but he was soon back on the Byzantine frontier: in late 797 he raided into [[Cappadocia]] and [[Galatia]] as far as [[Ancyra]], where he received an embassy from Empress [[Irene of Athens]] (r. 797\u2013802) which asked for a peace agreement, but was rebuffed. In 798, he led another campaign that reached and plundered the great Byzantine army base and imperial [[stable]]s at [[Malagina]] in [[Bithynia]]. He carried off much booty, including the imperial parade [[horse]]s and baggage-train. On his return, he was attacked by the forces of the [[Theme (Byzantine district)|themes]] of [[Opsikion]] and [[Optimatoi]], but defeated them. At the same time, his son raided the city of [[Ephesus]].<ref>Theophanes the Confessor.

Appliances are pre-installed, pre-configured, system images. This spin was intended to make it easier for anyone (developers, [[independent software vendor]]s (ISV), [[original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEM), etc.) to create and deploy [[virtual appliance]]s.\n\n=== Spins and Remixes ===\nThe Fedora project officially distributes different variations called \"Fedora Spins\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spins.fedoraproject.org/index.html.en|title=Fedora Spins|website=spins.fedoraproject.org}}</ref> which are Fedora with different desktop environments (GNOME is the default desktop environment). The current official spins, as of Fedora 30, are KDE, XFCE, LXQT, Mate-Compiz, Cinnamon, LXDE, and SOAS.\n\nIn addition to Spins, which are official variants of the Fedora system, the project allows unofficial variants to use the term \"Fedora Remix\" without asking for further permission, although a different logo (provided) is required.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Remix|title=Remix - Fedora Project Wiki|website=fedoraproject.org}}</ref>\n\nSome examples are \"Kannolo\", which is a Fedora KDE remix that omits anything that depends on the GTK toolkit from the default system, and [[Russian Fedora Remix]], which is a variant that ships software which is encumbered by US patent laws or would violate Fedora's policy of not including non-free software by default.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/kannolo/|title=Kannolo|website=SourceForge}}</ref>\n\n=== Architectures ===\n[[x86-32]], [[x86-64]] and [[ARM architecture|ARM-hfp]] are the primary architectures supported by Fedora.<ref name=\"Architectures\" /> Pidora<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pidora.ca|title=Pidora - Raspberry Pi Fedora Remix|publisher=pidora.ca|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref> and FedBerry<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fedberry.org|title=FedBerry - Fedora Remix for Raspberry Pi 2/3 | publisher=fedberry.org|accessdate=23 March 2017}}</ref> are specialized Fedora distributions for the [[Raspberry Pi]], which support the Raspberry Pi as well as other ARM and [[Single-board computer|SBC]] devices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM#Supported_Hardware_and_Devices|title=Fedora ARM Supported Devices|last=|first=|date=|website=Fedora ARM Supported Devices|access-date=}}</ref> As of release 26, Fedora also supports [[AArch64|ARM AArch64]], [[Power ISA|IBM Power64]], [[Power ISA|IBM Power64le]], [[Z/Architecture|IBM Z]] (\"s390x\"), [[MIPS architecture|MIPS-64el]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS-el]], [[RISC-V]] as secondary architectures.\n\nFedora 28 was the last release that supported ppc64 and users are advised to move to the little endian [[ppc64le]] variant.<ref name=\"Fedora PPC64\" />\n\n=== Alternatives ===\nThe Fedora Project also distributes several other versions<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://alt.fedoraproject.org/|title=Fedora Alternative Downloads|last=|first=|date=|website=Fedora Alternative Downloads|access-date=}}</ref> with less use cases than mentioned above, like network installers and minimal installation images. They are intended for special cases and/or expert users that want to have custom installations or configuring Fedora from scratch.\nIn addition, all acceptable licenses for Fedora (including copyright, trademark, and patent licenses) must be applicable not only to Red Hat or Fedora, but also to all recipients downstream.

The current official spins, as of Fedora 30, are KDE, XFCE, LXQT, Mate-Compiz, Cinnamon, LXDE, and SOAS.\n\nIn addition to Spins, which are official variants of the Fedora system, the project allows unofficial variants to use the term \"Fedora Remix\" without asking for further permission, although a different logo (provided) is required.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Remix|title=Remix - Fedora Project Wiki|website=fedoraproject.org}}</ref>\n\nSome examples are \"Kannolo\", which is a Fedora KDE remix that omits anything that depends on the GTK toolkit from the default system, and [[Russian Fedora Remix]], which is a variant that ships software which is encumbered by US patent laws or would violate Fedora's policy of not including non-free software by default.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/kannolo/|title=Kannolo|website=SourceForge}}</ref>\n\n=== Architectures ===\n[[x86-32]], [[x86-64]] and [[ARM architecture|ARM-hfp]] are the primary architectures supported by Fedora.<ref name=\"Architectures\" /> Pidora<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pidora.ca|title=Pidora - Raspberry Pi Fedora Remix|publisher=pidora.ca|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref> and FedBerry<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fedberry.org|title=FedBerry - Fedora Remix for Raspberry Pi 2/3 | publisher=fedberry.org|accessdate=23 March 2017}}</ref> are specialized Fedora distributions for the [[Raspberry Pi]], which support the Raspberry Pi as well as other ARM and [[Single-board computer|SBC]] devices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM#Supported_Hardware_and_Devices|title=Fedora ARM Supported Devices|last=|first=|date=|website=Fedora ARM Supported Devices|access-date=}}</ref> As of release 26, Fedora also supports [[AArch64|ARM AArch64]], [[Power ISA|IBM Power64]], [[Power ISA|IBM Power64le]], [[Z/Architecture|IBM Z]] (\"s390x\"), [[MIPS architecture|MIPS-64el]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS-el]], [[RISC-V]] as secondary architectures.\n\nFedora 28 was the last release that supported ppc64 and users are advised to move to the little endian [[ppc64le]] variant.<ref name=\"Fedora PPC64\" />\n\n=== Alternatives ===\nThe Fedora Project also distributes several other versions<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://alt.fedoraproject.org/|title=Fedora Alternative Downloads|last=|first=|date=|website=Fedora Alternative Downloads|access-date=}}</ref> with less use cases than mentioned above, like network installers and minimal installation images. They are intended for special cases and/or expert users that want to have custom installations or configuring Fedora from scratch.\nIn addition, all acceptable licenses for Fedora (including copyright, trademark, and patent licenses) must be applicable not only to Red Hat or Fedora, but also to all recipients downstream. This means that any \"Fedora-only\" licenses, or licenses with specific terms that Red Hat or Fedora meets but that other recipients would not are not acceptable (and almost certainly non-free, as a result).\n\n== History ==\n\nThe name of Fedora derives from Fedora Linux, a [[Volunteering|volunteer]] project that provided extra software for the [[Red Hat Linux]] distribution, and from the characteristic [[fedora]] hat used in Red Hat's \"Shadowman\" logo. Warren Togami began Fedora Linux in 2002 as an undergraduate project at the [[University of Hawaii]],<ref>{{cite web|url=//fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Wtogami?rd=WarrenTogami|title=Warren Togami|publisher=fedoraproject.org}}</ref> intended to provide a single [[Software repository|repository]] for well-tested third-party software packages so that non-Red Hat software would be easier to find, develop, and use. The key difference between Fedora Linux and Red Hat Linux was that Fedora's repository development would be collaborative with the global volunteer community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/31767|title=Warren Togami on the new Fedora Project|last=Barr|first=Joe|date=1 October 2003|publisher=Linux.com|accessdate=9 February 2010}}</ref> Fedora Linux was eventually absorbed into the Fedora Project, carrying with it this collaborative approach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://togami.com/~warren/archive/2006/lax_seminar_fedora_feb_2006.odp|title=Why Fedora?|last=Togami|first=Warren|date=February 2006|format=ODP|access-date=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831065506/http://togami.com/~warren/archive/2006/lax_seminar_fedora_feb_2006.odp|archive-date=31 August 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFedora Linux was launched in 2003, when Red Hat Linux was discontinued.<ref name=\"newdirection\">{{cite mailing list | url=http://www.redhat.com/archives/rhl-list/2003-September/msg00064.html | title=Fedora Project: Announcing New Direction | date=22 September 2003 | accessdate=18 October 2007 | mailinglist=Fedora development | last=Johnson | first=Michael K.}}</ref> [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] was to be Red Hat's only officially supported Linux distribution, while Fedora was to be a community distribution.<ref name=\"newdirection\" /> Red Hat Enterprise Linux branches its releases from versions of Fedora.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.redhat.com/magazine/022aug06/features/fedora_rhel_4/ | title=The Fedora Project and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, part 4 | last=Burke | first=Tim | publisher=Red Hat | series=Red Hat Magazine, Issue #22 | date=August 2006 | access-date=18 October 2007 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012162113/http://www.redhat.com/magazine/022aug06/features/fedora_rhel_4/ | archive-date=12 October 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBefore Fedora 7, Fedora was called Fedora Core after the name of one of the two main software repositories - Core and Extras. Fedora Core contained all the base packages that were required by the operating system, as well as other packages that were distributed along with the installation CD/DVDs, and was maintained only by Red Hat developers. Fedora Extras, the secondary repository that had been included since Fedora Core 3, was community-maintained and not distributed along with the installation CD/DVDs. Upon the release of Fedora 7, the distinction between Fedora Core and Fedora Extras was eliminated.<ref>{{cite web | url=//fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/7 | title=Releases/7 | publisher=Fedora Project | accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nSince the release of Fedora 21, as an effort to modularize the Fedora distribution and make development more agile,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-present-and-future-a-fedora-next-2014-update-part-i-why/ |title=Fedora Present and Future: a Fedora.next 2014 Update (Part I, \u201cWhy?\u201d) |publisher=Fedora Magazine |date=19 March 2014 |last=Miller |first=Matthew |accessdate=23 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://old.lwn.net/Articles/680278/ |title=Modularizing Fedora |date=16 March 2016 |last=Corbet |first=Jonathan |publisher=LWN.net |accessdate=23 July 2017}}</ref> three different versions are available: ''Workstation'', focused on the [[personal computer]], ''Server'' and ''Atomic'' for [[server (computing)|server]]s, ''Atomic'' being the version meant for [[cloud computing]].<ref name=\"arstechnica fedora21\" />\n\nFedora is a trademark of Red Hat, Inc.

As such, Rawhide is often more feature rich than the current stable release. In many cases, the software is made of [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]], [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]] or [[Git (software)|Git]] source code snapshots which are often actively developed by programmers. Although Rawhide is targeted at advanced users, testers, and package maintainers, it is capable of being a primary operating system. Users interested in the Rawhide branch often update on a daily basis and help troubleshoot problems.<ref name=\"rawhide\" /> Rawhide users do not have to upgrade between different versions as it follows a [[rolling release]] update model.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Anaconda (installer)|Anaconda]], the system installer used by Fedora\n* [[Fedora Media Writer]]\n* [[OSTree]]\n* [[ABRT]]\n\n{{Portal bar|Linux|Free and open-source software}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Fedora (operating system)}}\n* {{Official website|https://getfedora.org/}}\n* [https://fedoramagazine.org/ Fedora Magazine]\n* {{DistroWatch|fedora|NAME=Fedora}}\n\n{{RedHatFedora-distro}}\n{{Red Hat}}\n{{Linux-distro}}\n{{GNOME}}\n{{authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fedora (Operating System)}}\n[[Category:ARM Linux distributions]]\n[[Category:Fedora Project]]\n[[Category:IA-32 Linux distributions]]\n[[Category:Power ISA Linux distributions]]\n[[Category:PowerPC Linux distributions]]\n[[Category:RPM-based Linux distributions]]\n[[Category:X86-64 Linux distributions]]\n", "name_user": "Crimsonite~enwiki", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed and updated links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(operating_system)"}
