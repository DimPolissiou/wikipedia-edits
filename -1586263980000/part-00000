{"title_page": "Lords Spiritual", "text_new": "{{Use British English|date = September 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date = September 2019}}\n{{PoliticsUK}}\nThe '''Lords Spiritual''' of the [[United Kingdom]] are the 26 [[bishop]]s of the [[State religion|established]] [[Church of England]] who serve in the [[House of Lords]], not counting bishops who sit by right of a peerage. The [[Church of Scotland]], which is [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], and the Anglican churches in [[Church in Wales|Wales]] and [[Church of Ireland|Northern Ireland]], which are no longer established churches, are not represented. The Lords Spiritual are distinct from the [[Lords Temporal]], their secular counterparts who also sit in the [[House of Lords]].\n\n==Ranks and titles==\nThe Church of England comprises 42 [[diocese]]s, each led by a [[diocesan bishop]]. The [[Archbishop|Archbishops]] of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] and [[Archbishop of York|York]], as Primate of All England and Primate of England, respectively, have oversight over their corresponding [[Ecclesiastical province|provinces]]. The occupants of the five \"great sees\"\u2014[[ Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]], [[Bishop of York|York]], [[Bishop of London|London]], [[Bishop of Durham|Durham]] and [[Bishop of Winchester|Winchester]]\u2014are always Lords of Parliament. The [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]] and the [[Bishop of Gibraltar in Europe]] may not sit in the House of Lords regardless of seniority as their dioceses lie outside both of England and of the United Kingdom. (The former, however, sits on the [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man]] ''[[ex officio]]''.) Of the remaining 35 bishops, the 21 most senior sit in the House of Lords. Seniority is determined by total length of service as an English diocesan bishop (that is to say, it is not lost by translation to another see).<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/lords-spiritual-and-temporal/ Lords Spiritual] from ''Parliament.uk'' retrieved 15 June 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/about-lords/lords-appointment/ Lords Appointment] from ''Parliament.uk'' retrieved 15 June 2013</ref>\n\nTheoretically, the power to elect archbishops and bishops is vested in the diocesan cathedral's college of canons. Practically, however, the [[appointment of Church of England bishops|choice of the archbishop or bishop]] is made prior to the election. The Prime Minister chooses from among a set of nominees proposed by the [[Crown Nominations Commission]]; the sovereign then instructs the college of canons to elect the nominated individual as a bishop or archbishop.\n\n{{anchor|Convenor}}One of the Lords Spiritual is appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury to be the ''convenor'' of the bench; he or she coordinates the work of the bishops in the House. [[David Urquhart (bishop)|David Urquhart]], [[Bishop of Birmingham]], was appointed the current convenor on 18 May 2015.<ref>[https://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2015/05/new-convenor-of-the-lords-spiritual-announced.aspx Church of England \u2014 New Convenor of the Lords Spiritual announced] (Accessed 16 June 2015)</ref>\n\n==Peers==\nEven during the early years of the [[Peerage]], the position of bishops was unclear. During the reign of King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], the Archbishop of Canterbury declared, \"of right and by the custom of the realm of England it belongeth to the Archbishop of Canterbury for the time being as well as others his suffragans, brethren and fellow Bishops, Abbots and Priors and other prelates whatsoever, \u2014 to be present in person in all the King's Parliaments whatsoever as Peers of the Realm\". The claim was neither agreed nor disagreed to, however, by Parliament.\n\nThe Lords Spiritual at first declared themselves entirely outside the jurisdiction of secular authorities; the question of trial in the House of Lords did not arise. When papal authority was great, the King could do little but admit a lack of jurisdiction over the prelates. Later, however, when the power of the Pope in England was reduced, the Lords Spiritual came under the authority of the secular courts. The jurisdiction of the common courts was clearly established by the time of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], who declared himself head of the Church of England in place of the Pope, ending the constitutional power of the Roman Catholic Church in England.\n\nDespite their failure to be tried as temporal peers in the House of Lords, it remained unclear whether the Lords Spiritual were indeed peers. In 1688, the issue arose during the trial of the [[Seven Bishops]]\u2014[[William Sancroft]], Archbishop of Canterbury; [[Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 3rd Baronet]], Bishop of Winchester; [[Thomas Ken]], Bishop of Bath and Wells; [[John Lake (bishop)|John Lake]], Bishop of Chester; [[William Lloyd (bishop of Worcester)|William Lloyd]], Bishop of Worcester; [[Francis Turner (bishop)|Francis Turner]], Bishop of Ely and [[Thomas White (bishop)|Thomas White]], Bishop of Peterborough\u2014by a common jury. The charge was that a petition sent by the Bishops constituted [[seditious libel]]; the Bishops argued that they had the [[right to petition]] the Sovereign at any time, while the prosecution charged that such a right was only permissible when Parliament was in session (which, at the time of the delivery of the petition, it was not). If the bishops were only Lords of Parliament, and not peers, their right to petition would be vitiated while Parliament was dissolved. Peers, however, were and still are counsellors of the Sovereign whether Parliament is in session or not; therefore, if the bishops were indeed peers, they would be free to send petitions.  Since there was no doubt that the petition was actually sent, while the Court still ruled the bishops not guilty, it appears that it was taken for granted that the bishops were counsellors of the Crown.\n\nNevertheless, the ''Standing Orders of the House of Lords'' provide, \"Bishops to whom a writ of summons has been issued are not Peers but are Lords of Parliament.\"\n\n==Number==\nIn the early history of the [[Parliament of England]], the Lords Spiritual\u2014including the [[abbot]]s\u2014outnumbered the Lords Temporal. Between 1536 and 1540, however, King Henry VIII [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved the monasteries]], thereby removing the seats of the abbots. For the first time and thereafter, Lords Spiritual formed a minority in the House of Lords.<ref name=hist>[http://www.parliament.uk/business/lords/lords-history/history-of-the-lords/ History of the Lords] from ''Parliament.uk'' retrieved 15 June 2013</ref>\n\nIn addition to the 21 older dioceses (including four in Wales), Henry VIII created six new ones, of which five survived (see [[historical development of Church of England dioceses]]); the Bishops of the Church of England were excluded in 1642 but regained their seats following the Restoration; from then until the early nineteenth century  no new sees were created, and the number of lords spiritual remained at 26.\n\nBishops, abbots, and priors, of the [[Church of Scotland]] traditionally sat in the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. Laymen acquired the monasteries in 1560, following the [[Scottish Reformation]], and therefore those sitting as \"abbots\" and \"priors\" were all laymen after this time. Bishops of the Church of Scotland continued to sit, regardless of their religious conformity. Roman Catholic clergy were excluded in 1567, but [[Episcopal polity|Episcopal bishops]] continued to sit until they too were excluded in 1638. The bishops regained their seats following the [[Restoration (Scotland)|Restoration]], but were again excluded in 1689, following the final abolition of diocesan bishops and the permanent establishment of the Church of Scotland as Presbyterian. There are no longer [[bishops in the Church of Scotland]] in the traditional sense of the word, and that church has never sent senior clergy to sit in the House of Lords at Westminster.\n\nBishops and archbishops of the [[Church of Ireland]] were entitled to sit in the [[Irish House of Lords]] as Lords Spiritual. They obtained representation in the Westminster House of Lords after the union of Ireland and Great Britain in 1801. Of the Church of Ireland's ecclesiastics, four (one archbishop and three bishops) were to sit at any one time, with the members rotating at the end of every parliamentary session (which normally lasted approximately one year). The Church of Ireland, however, was [[Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland|disestablished]] in 1871, and thereafter ceased to be represented by Lords Spiritual.\n\nThe [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]], although a Bishop of the Church of England, has never been included among the English Lords Spiritual, as the [[Isle of Man]] has never been part of the Kingdom of England or of the United Kingdom. The Lord Bishop is the holder of the oldest office in [[Tynwald]] (the oldest continuous parliament in the world) and remains an ''ex officio'' member of Tynwald and its [[Legislative Council (Isle of Man)|Legislative Council]].\n\nIn the 19th century the dioceses of the Church of England began gradually to come under review again. However an increase in the bench of bishops was not considered politically expedient, and so steps were undertaken to prevent it. In 1836, the first new bishopric was founded, [[Bishop of Ripon (modern diocese)|that of Ripon]]; but it was balanced out by the merger of the [[Bishop of Bristol|Bishoprics of Bristol]] and [[Bishop of Gloucester|Gloucester]]. (They were later divided again.) The creation of the [[Bishop of Manchester|Bishopric of Manchester]] was also planned but delayed until St Asaph and Bangor could be merged.

The [[Church of Scotland]], which is [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], and the Anglican churches in [[Church in Wales|Wales]] and [[Church of Ireland|Northern Ireland]], which are no longer established churches, are not represented. The Lords Spiritual are distinct from the [[Lords Temporal]], their secular counterparts who also sit in the [[House of Lords]].\n\n==Ranks and titles==\nThe Church of England comprises 42 [[diocese]]s, each led by a [[diocesan bishop]]. The [[Archbishop|Archbishops]] of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] and [[Archbishop of York|York]], as Primate of All England and Primate of England, respectively, have oversight over their corresponding [[Ecclesiastical province|provinces]]. The occupants of the five \"great sees\"\u2014[[ Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]], [[Bishop of York|York]], [[Bishop of London|London]], [[Bishop of Durham|Durham]] and [[Bishop of Winchester|Winchester]]\u2014are always Lords of Parliament. The [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]] and the [[Bishop of Gibraltar in Europe]] may not sit in the House of Lords regardless of seniority as their dioceses lie outside both of England and of the United Kingdom. (The former, however, sits on the [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man]] ''[[ex officio]]''.) Of the remaining 35 bishops, the 21 most senior sit in the House of Lords. Seniority is determined by total length of service as an English diocesan bishop (that is to say, it is not lost by translation to another see).<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/lords-spiritual-and-temporal/ Lords Spiritual] from ''Parliament.uk'' retrieved 15 June 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/about-lords/lords-appointment/ Lords Appointment] from ''Parliament.uk'' retrieved 15 June 2013</ref>\n\nTheoretically, the power to elect archbishops and bishops is vested in the diocesan cathedral's college of canons. Practically, however, the [[appointment of Church of England bishops|choice of the archbishop or bishop]] is made prior to the election. The Prime Minister chooses from among a set of nominees proposed by the [[Crown Nominations Commission]]; the sovereign then instructs the college of canons to elect the nominated individual as a bishop or archbishop.\n\n{{anchor|Convenor}}One of the Lords Spiritual is appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury to be the ''convenor'' of the bench; he or she coordinates the work of the bishops in the House. [[David Urquhart (bishop)|David Urquhart]], [[Bishop of Birmingham]], was appointed the current convenor on 18 May 2015.<ref>[https://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2015/05/new-convenor-of-the-lords-spiritual-announced.aspx Church of England \u2014 New Convenor of the Lords Spiritual announced] (Accessed 16 JUne 2015)</ref>\n\n==Peers==\nEven during the early years of the [[Peerage]], the position of bishops was unclear. During the reign of King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], the Archbishop of Canterbury declared, \"of right and by the custom of the realm of England it belongeth to the Archbishop of Canterbury for the time being as well as others his suffragans, brethren and fellow Bishops, Abbots and Priors and other prelates whatsoever, \u2014 to be present in person in all the King's Parliaments whatsoever as Peers of the Realm\". The claim was neither agreed nor disagreed to, however, by Parliament.\n\nThe Lords Spiritual at first declared themselves entirely outside the jurisdiction of secular authorities; the question of trial in the House of Lords did not arise. When papal authority was great, the King could do little but admit a lack of jurisdiction over the prelates. Later, however, when the power of the Pope in England was reduced, the Lords Spiritual came under the authority of the secular courts. The jurisdiction of the common courts was clearly established by the time of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], who declared himself head of the Church of England in place of the Pope, ending the constitutional power of the Roman Catholic Church in England.\n\nDespite their failure to be tried as temporal peers in the House of Lords, it remained unclear whether the Lords Spiritual were indeed peers. In 1688, the issue arose during the trial of the [[Seven Bishops]]\u2014[[William Sancroft]], Archbishop of Canterbury; [[Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 3rd Baronet]], Bishop of Winchester; [[Thomas Ken]], Bishop of Bath and Wells; [[John Lake (bishop)|John Lake]], Bishop of Chester; [[William Lloyd (bishop of Worcester)|William Lloyd]], Bishop of Worcester; [[Francis Turner (bishop)|Francis Turner]], Bishop of Ely and [[Thomas White (bishop)|Thomas White]], Bishop of Peterborough\u2014by a common jury. The charge was that a petition sent by the Bishops constituted [[seditious libel]]; the Bishops argued that they had the [[right to petition]] the Sovereign at any time, while the prosecution charged that such a right was only permissible when Parliament was in session (which, at the time of the delivery of the petition, it was not). If the bishops were only Lords of Parliament, and not peers, their right to petition would be vitiated while Parliament was dissolved. Peers, however, were and still are counsellors of the Sovereign whether Parliament is in session or not; therefore, if the bishops were indeed peers, they would be free to send petitions.  Since there was no doubt that the petition was actually sent, while the Court still ruled the bishops not guilty, it appears that it was taken for granted that the bishops were counsellors of the Crown.\n\nNevertheless, the ''Standing Orders of the House of Lords'' provide, \"Bishops to whom a writ of summons has been issued are not Peers but are Lords of Parliament.\"\n\n==Number==\nIn the early history of the [[Parliament of England]], the Lords Spiritual\u2014including the [[abbot]]s\u2014outnumbered the Lords Temporal. Between 1536 and 1540, however, King Henry VIII [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved the monasteries]], thereby removing the seats of the abbots. For the first time and thereafter, Lords Spiritual formed a minority in the House of Lords.<ref name=hist>[http://www.parliament.uk/business/lords/lords-history/history-of-the-lords/ History of the Lords] from ''Parliament.uk'' retrieved 15 June 2013</ref>\n\nIn addition to the 21 older dioceses (including four in Wales), Henry VIII created six new ones, of which five survived (see [[historical development of Church of England dioceses]]); the Bishops of the Church of England were excluded in 1642 but regained their seats following the Restoration; from then until the early nineteenth century  no new sees were created, and the number of lords spiritual remained at 26.\n\nBishops, abbots, and priors, of the [[Church of Scotland]] traditionally sat in the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. Laymen acquired the monasteries in 1560, following the [[Scottish Reformation]], and therefore those sitting as \"abbots\" and \"priors\" were all laymen after this time. Bishops of the Church of Scotland continued to sit, regardless of their religious conformity. Roman Catholic clergy were excluded in 1567, but [[Episcopal polity|Episcopal bishops]] continued to sit until they too were excluded in 1638. The bishops regained their seats following the [[Restoration (Scotland)|Restoration]], but were again excluded in 1689, following the final abolition of diocesan bishops and the permanent establishment of the Church of Scotland as Presbyterian. There are no longer [[bishops in the Church of Scotland]] in the traditional sense of the word, and that church has never sent senior clergy to sit in the House of Lords at Westminster.\n\nBishops and archbishops of the [[Church of Ireland]] were entitled to sit in the [[Irish House of Lords]] as Lords Spiritual. They obtained representation in the Westminster House of Lords after the union of Ireland and Great Britain in 1801. Of the Church of Ireland's ecclesiastics, four (one archbishop and three bishops) were to sit at any one time, with the members rotating at the end of every parliamentary session (which normally lasted approximately one year). The Church of Ireland, however, was [[Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland|disestablished]] in 1871, and thereafter ceased to be represented by Lords Spiritual.\n\nThe [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]], although a Bishop of the Church of England, has never been included among the English Lords Spiritual, as the [[Isle of Man]] has never been part of the Kingdom of England or of the United Kingdom. The Lord Bishop is the holder of the oldest office in [[Tynwald]] (the oldest continuous parliament in the world) and remains an ''ex officio'' member of Tynwald and its [[Legislative Council (Isle of Man)|Legislative Council]].\n\nIn the 19th century the dioceses of the Church of England began gradually to come under review again. However an increase in the bench of bishops was not considered politically expedient, and so steps were undertaken to prevent it. In 1836, the first new bishopric was founded, [[Bishop of Ripon (modern diocese)|that of Ripon]]; but it was balanced out by the merger of the [[Bishop of Bristol|Bishoprics of Bristol]] and [[Bishop of Gloucester|Gloucester]]. (They were later divided again.) The creation of the [[Bishop of Manchester|Bishopric of Manchester]] was also planned but delayed until St Asaph and Bangor could be merged. They never were; but in 1844, the [[Bishopric of Manchester Act 1847]] went ahead anyway with an alternative means to maintain the 26-bishop limit in the House of Lords: the seniority-based proviso which has been maintained to this day.<ref name=hist/> However, the [[Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015]] gives any woman appointed a diocesan bishop in England during the next decade priority in terms of succeeding those among the current 21 who retire during that period.

Of the [[Western canon|canonical]] [[nine lyric poets]] of ancient Greece, his work is the best preserved. [[Quintilian]] wrote, \"Of the nine lyric poets, Pindar is by far the greatest, in virtue of his inspired magnificence, the beauty of his thoughts and figures, the rich exuberance of his language and matter, and his rolling flood of eloquence, characteristics which, as [[Horace]] rightly held, make him inimitable.\"<ref>[[Quintilian]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/10A*.html#1.61 10.1.61]; cf. [[Longinus (literature)|Pseudo-Longinus]] [http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/longinus/desub011.htm#xxxiii 33.5].</ref> His poems can also, however, seem difficult and even peculiar. The Athenian comic playwright [[Eupolis]] once remarked that they \"are already reduced to silence by the disinclination of the multitude for elegant learning\".<ref>''Eupolis'' F366 Kock, 398 K/A, from Athenaeus 3a, (''[[Deipnosophistae]]'', epitome of book I)</ref> Some scholars in the modern age also found his poetry perplexing, at least until the 1896 discovery of some poems by his rival [[Bacchylides]]; comparisons of their work showed that many of Pindar's idiosyncrasies are typical of archaic genres rather than of only the poet himself. His poetry, while admired by critics, still challenges the casual reader and his work is largely unread among the general public.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Some Aspects of Pindar's Style|author=Lawrence Henry Baker|journal=The Sewanee Review|volume=31|issue=1|year=1923|jstor=27533621|pages=100\u2013110}}</ref>\n\nPindar was the first Greek poet to reflect on the nature of poetry and on the poet's role.<ref>Gerber, p. 261</ref> Like other poets of the Archaic Age, he has a profound sense of the vicissitudes of life, but he also articulates a passionate faith in what men can achieve by the grace of the gods, most famously expressed in the conclusion to one of his [[Epinikion|Victory Odes]]:<ref>de Romilly, p. 37</ref>\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nCreatures of a day!

His father's name is variously given as Daiphantus, Pagondas or Scopelinus, and his mother's name was Cleodice.<ref name=\"Greek Lyric Poets' 1997 page 253\">Gerber, p. 253</ref> It is told that he was stung on the mouth by a [[bee]] in his youth and this was the reason he became a poet of honey-like verses (an identical fate has been ascribed to other poets of the archaic period). Pindar was about twenty years old in 498 BC when he was commissioned by the ruling family in [[Thessaly]] to compose his first victory ode (''Pythian 10''). He studied the art of lyric poetry in Athens, where his tutor was [[Lasos of Hermione]], and he is also said to have received some helpful criticism from [[Corinna]].\n\nThe early-to-middle years of Pindar's career coincided with the Persian invasions of Greece in the reigns of [[Darius the Great|Darius]] and [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]. During the invasion in 480/79 BC, when Pindar was almost forty years old, [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] was occupied by Xerxes' general, [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]], who with many Theban aristocrats subsequently perished at the [[Battle of Plataea]]. It is possible that Pindar spent much of this time at [[Aegina]]. His choice of residence during the earlier invasion in 490 BC is not known, but he was able to attend the [[Pythian Games]] for that year, where he first met the Sicilian prince, Thrasybulus, nephew of [[Theron of Acragas]]. Thrasybulus had driven the winning chariot and he and Pindar were to form a lasting friendship, paving the way for his subsequent visit to Sicily.\n\n====Middle age====\nPindar seems to have used his odes to advance his, and his friends', personal interests.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=311420|author=Hubbard, T. K.|title=Remaking Myth and Rewriting History: Cult Tradition in Pindar's Ninth Nemean'|journal= Harvard Studies in Classical Philology|volume=94|year=1992|pages=77\u2013111 [78]|doi=10.2307/311420}}</ref> In 462 BC he composed two odes in honour of Arcesilas, king of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], (''Pythians 4 and 5''), pleading for the return from exile of a friend, Demophilus. In the latter ode Pindar proudly mentions his own ancestry, which he shared with the king, as an Aegeid or descendant of [[Aegeus]], the legendary king of Athens. The clan was influential in many parts of the Greek world, having intermarried with ruling families in Thebes, in [[Laconia (ancient region)|Lacedaemonia]], and in cities that claimed Lacedaemonian descent, such as Cyrene and [[Santorini|Thera]]. The historian [[Herodotus]] considered the clan important enough to deserve mention (''Histories'' IV.147). Membership of this clan possibly contributed to Pindar's success as a poet, and it informed his political views, which are marked by a conservative preference for oligarchic governments of the [[Dorians|Doric]] kind.\n\n<blockquote>\"Pindar might not actually claim to be an Aegeid since his 'I' statements do not necessarily refer to himself. The Aegeid clan did however have a branch in Thebes, and his reference to 'my ancestors' in Pythian 5 could have been spoken on behalf of both Arcesilas and himself{{spaced ndash}}he may have used this ambivalence to establish a personal link with his patrons.\"<ref>Gerber, p. 270</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe was possibly the Theban [[proxenos]] or consul for Aegina and/or [[Molossia]], as indicated in another of his odes, Nemean 7,{{sfn|Hornblower|2004|p=177}}{{sfn|Hornblower|2004|p=178}}{{sfn|Hornblower|2004|p=179}}{{sfn|Hornblower|2004|p=180}} in which he glorifies [[Neoptolemus]], a national hero of Aegina and Molossia. According to tradition, Neoptolemus died disgracefully in a fight with priests at the temple in [[Delphi]] over their share of some sacrificial meat. Pindar diplomatically glosses over this and concludes mysteriously with an earnest protestation of innocence{{spaced ndash}}\"But shall my heart never admit that I with words none can redeem dishonoured Neoptolemus\". Possibly he was responding to anger among Aeginetans and/or Molossians over his portrayal of Neoptolemus in an earlier poem, ''[[Paean]] 6'', which had been commissioned by the priests at Delphi and which depicted the hero's death in traditional terms, as divine retribution for his crimes.\n\n<blockquote>\"Some doubt this biographical interpretation of ''Nemean 7'' since it is largely based on marginal comments by [[scholiast]]s and Pindaric scholiasts are often unreliable. The fact that Pindar gave different versions of the myth may simply reflect the needs of different genres, and does not necessarily indicate a personal dilemma.<ref>Ian Rutherford, ''Pindar's Paeans'', Oxford University Press (2001), pp. 321\u201322</ref> ''Nemean 7'' in fact is the most controversial and obscure of Pindar's victory odes, and scholars ancient and modern have been ingenious and imaginative in their attempts to explain it, so far with no agreed success.\"<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=1087989|author=Woodbury, Leonard|title=Neoptolemus at Delphi: Pindar, Nem.7.30ff|journal=Phoenix|volume=33|issue=2|year=1979| pages=95\u2013133|doi=10.2307/1087989}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his first Pythian ode, composed in 470 BC in honour of the Sicilian tyrant [[Hieron of Syracuse|Hieron]], Pindar celebrated a series of victories by Greeks against foreign invaders: Athenian and Spartan-led victories against Persia at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] and [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]], and victories by the western Greeks led by [[Theron of Acragas]] and Hieron against the Carthaginians and Etruscans at the battles of [[Battle of Himera (480 BC)|Himera]] and [[Battle of Cumae|Cumae]]. Such celebrations were not appreciated by his fellow Thebans: they had sided with the Persians and had incurred many losses and privations as a result of their defeat. His praise of Athens with such epithets as ''bulwark of [[Ancient Greece|Hellas]]'' (''fragment 76'') and ''city of noble name and sunlit splendour'' (Nemean 5) induced the authorities in Thebes to fine him 5000 drachmae, to which the Athenians are said to have responded with a gift of 10000 drachmae. According to another account,<ref>[[Isocrates]] 15.166</ref> the Athenians even made him their proxenus or consul in Thebes. His association with the fabulously rich Hieron was another source of annoyance at home. It was probably in response to Theban sensitivities over this issue that he denounced the rule of tyrants (i.e. rulers like Hieron) in an ode composed shortly after a visit to Hieron's sumptuous court in 476\u201375 BC (''Pythian 11'').<ref>Pindar (1972) p. 158</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"Pindar's actual phrasing in ''Pythian 11'' was \"I deplore the lot of tyrants\" and though this was traditionally interpreted as an apology for his dealings with Sicilian tyrants like Hieron, an alternative date for the ode has led some scholars to conclude that it was in fact a covert reference to the tyrannical behaviour of the Athenians, although this interpretation is ruled out if we accept the earlier note about covert references. According to yet another interpretation Pindar is simply delivering a formulaic warning to the successful athlete to avoid [[hubris]].{{sfn|Hornblower|2004|p=59}} It is highly unlikely that Pindar ever acted for Athenians as their proxenus or consul in Thebes.\"{{sfn|Hornblower|2004|p=57}}</blockquote>\n\nLyric verse was conventionally accompanied by music and dance, and Pindar himself wrote the music and choreographed the dances for his victory odes. Sometimes he trained the performers at his home in Thebes, and sometimes he trained them at the venue where they performed. Commissions took him to all parts of the Greek world{{spaced ndash}}to the Panhellenic festivals in mainland Greece (Olympia, Delphi, Corinth and Nemea), westwards to Sicily, eastwards to the seaboard of Asia Minor, north to [[Macedon]]ia and [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] (''Paean 2'') and south to Cyrene on the African coast. Other poets at the same venues vied with him for the favours of patrons. His poetry sometimes reflects this rivalry. For example, ''Olympian 2'' and ''Pythian 2'', composed in honour of the Sicilian tyrants Theron and Hieron following his visit to their courts in 476\u201375 BC, refer respectively to ''ravens'' and an ''ape'', apparently signifying rivals who were engaged in a campaign of smears against him{{spaced ndash}}possibly the poets [[Simonides]] and his nephew [[Bacchylides]].<ref>Pindar (1972) pp. 10, 88\u20139</ref> Pindar's original treatment of narrative myth, often relating events in reverse chronological order, is said to have been a favourite target for criticism.<ref>Pindar (1972) Introduction p. XIII</ref> Simonides was known to charge high fees for his work and Pindar is said to have alluded to this in ''Isthmian 2'', where he refers to the Muse as \"a hireling journeyman\". He appeared in many poetry competitions and was defeated five times by his compatriot, the poet [[Corinna]], in revenge of which he called her ''Boeotian sow'' in one of his odes (''Olympian'' 6. 89f.).\n\n<blockquote>\"It was assumed by ancient sources that Pindar's odes were performed by a chorus, but this has been challenged by some modern scholars, who argue that the odes were in fact performed solo.{{sfn|Hornblower|2004|p=16}} It is not known how commissions were arranged, nor if the poet travelled widely: even when poems include statements like \"I have come\" it is not certain that this was meant literally.<ref>Race, pp. 10\u201311</ref> Uncomplimentary references to Bacchylides and Simonides were found by [[scholiasts]] but there is no reason to accept their interpretation of the odes.<ref>David Campbell, ''Greek Lyric IV'', Loeb Classical Library (1992), page 6</ref> In fact, some scholars have interpreted the allusions to fees in ''Isthmian 2'' as a request by Pindar for payment of fees owed to himself.<ref>Pindar (1972) p. 239</ref> His defeats by Corinna were probably invented by ancient commentators to account for the ''Boeotian sow'' remark, a phrase moreover that was completely misunderstood by scholiasts, since Pindar was scoffing at a reputation that all Boeotians had for stupidity.\"<ref>D. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric IV'', p. 2</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Old age and death====\nHis fame as a poet drew Pindar into Greek politics. Athens, the most important city in Greece throughout his poetic career, was a rival of his home city, [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], and also of the island state [[Aegina]], whose leading citizens commissioned about a quarter of his Victory Odes. There is no open condemnation of the Athenians in any of his poems but criticism is implied. For example, the victory ode mentioned above (''Pythian 8'') describes the downfall of the giants [[Porphyrion]] and [[Typhon]] and this might be Pindar's way of covertly celebrating a recent defeat of Athens by Thebes at the [[Battle of Coronea (447 BC)|Battle of Coronea]] (447 BC).<ref>Pindar (1972), p. 138</ref> The poem ends with a prayer for Aegina's freedom, long threatened by Athenian ambitions.\n<blockquote>Covert criticism of Athens (traditionally located in odes such as ''Pythian'' 8, ''Nemean'' 8 and ''Isthmian'' 7) is now dismissed as highly unlikely, even by scholars who allow some biographical and historical interpretations of the poems.<ref>Charles Segal, 'Choral Lyric in the Fifth Century', in Easterling, pp. 231\u2013232</ref></blockquote>\n\nOne of his last odes (''Pythian 8'') indicates that he lived near a shrine to the oracle [[Alcmaeon (mythology)|Alcmaeon]] and that he stored some of his wealth there. In the same ode he says that he had recently received a prophecy from Alcmaeon during a journey to Delphi (\"...he met me and proved the skills of prophecy that all his race inherit\")<ref>Pindar (1972) p. 142</ref> but he does not reveal what the long-dead prophet said to him nor in what form he appeared.<ref group=\"nb\">There are several other accounts of supernatural visitations relating to Pindar (see for example C.M. Bowra, ''Pindar'', pages 49-51). According to a [[scholium]], he and a pupil, Olympichus, once saw a mysterious flame on a mountain, attended by strange noises. Pindar then beheld [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], the Mother of the Gods, advancing in the form of a wooden image. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (9.25.3) reported that he set up a monument near his home, dedicated conjointly to Pan and the Mother of the Gods ({{lang|grc|\u0394\u03b9\u03bd\u03b4\u03c5\u03bc\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7}}). According to [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]] (''Proem.'' 27, p. 298. 9 Dr) and ''Vit. Ambr.'' (p. 2. 2 Dr.), Pan was once heard between [[Cithaeron]] and [[Mount Helicon|Helicon]] singing a [[paean]] composed to him by Pindar (fr. 85).</ref>  The ode was written to commemorate a victory by an athlete from [[Aegina]].\n\n<blockquote>\"Pindar doesn't necessarily mean himself when he uses the first person singular. Many of his 'I' statements are generic, indicating somebody engaged in the role of a singer i.e. a 'bardic' I. Other 'I' statements articulate values typical of the audience, and some are spoken on behalf of the subjects celebrated in the poems.<ref>Currie, p. 20</ref> The 'I' that received the prophecy in ''Pythian 8'' therefore might have been the athlete from Aegina, not Pindar. In that case the prophecy must have been about his performance at the Pythian Games, and the property stored at the shrine was just a votive offering.\"<ref>Gerber, pp. 268\u2013269</ref></blockquote>\n\nNothing is recorded about Pindar's wife and son except their names, Megacleia and Daiphantus. About ten days before he died, the goddess [[Persephone]] appeared to him and complained that she was the only divinity to whom he had never composed a hymn. She said he would come to her soon and compose one then.\n\nPindar lived to about eighty years of age. He died around 438 BC while attending a festival at [[Argos]]. His ashes were taken back home to Thebes by his musically-gifted daughters, Eumetis and Protomache.\n\n====Post mortem====\nOne of Pindar's female relatives claimed that he dictated some verses to her in honour of Persephone after he had been dead for several days. Some of Pindar's verses were inscribed in letters of gold on a temple wall in [[Lindos]], Rhodes. At Delphi, where he had been elected a priest of Apollo, the priests exhibited an iron chair on which he used to sit during the festival of the [[Theoxenia]]. Every night, while closing the temple doors, they intoned: \"Let Pindar the poet go unto the supper of the gods!\"\n\nPindar's house in [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] became one of the city's landmarks. When [[Alexander the Great]] [[Battle of Thebes|demolished Thebes]] in 335&nbsp;BC, as punishment for its resistance to Macedonian expansionism, he ordered the house be left intact out of gratitude for verses praising his ancestor, [[Alexander I of Macedon]].<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Alexander'' 11.6; [[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' 1.9.10</ref>\n\n===Values and beliefs===\nPindar's values and beliefs have been inferred from his poetry. No other ancient Greek poet has left so many comments about the nature of his art. He justified and exalted [[choral poetry]] at a time when society was turning away from it. It \"...had for two centuries reflected and shaped the sentiments, the outlook, and the convictions of the Greek aristocracies...and Pindar spoke up for it with passionate assurance\".{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=2}} His poetry is a meeting ground for gods, heroes and men{{spaced ndash}}even the dead are spoken of as participants: \"Deep in the earth their heart listens\".{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=38}}\n\nHis view of the gods is traditional but more self-consistent than [[Homer]]'s and more reverent. He never depicts gods in a demeaning role. He seems indifferent to the intellectual reforms that were shaping the theology of the times. Thus an eclipse is not a mere physical effect, as contemplated by early thinkers such as [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]] and [[Heraclitus]], nor was it even a subject for bold wonder, as it was for an earlier poet, [[Archilochus]];<ref>Archilochus fr. 122 West</ref> instead Pindar treated an eclipse as a portent of evil.<ref group=\"nb\">''Paean'' 9.13-20). The eclipse is mentioned in a fragment quoted by [[Stobaeus]], addressed to the Thebans:<br>Is it some sign of war you bring? / Or blight on crops, or snow-fall's strength / Beyond all telling, or murderous strife at home, / Or emptying of the sea on land, / Or frost binding the earth, or south-wind in summer / With a flood of furious rain, / Or will you drown the land and raise / A new breed of men from the beginning?</ref>{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=83}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=84}}\n\nGods are the embodiment of power, uncompromisingly proud of their nature and violent in defense of their privileges.{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=42}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=43}} There is some rationalization of religious belief, but it is within a tradition at least as old as [[Hesiod]], where abstractions are personified, such as \"Truth the daughter of Zeus\".<ref>''Olympic Ode'' 10.3-4</ref> Sometimes the wording suggests a belief in 'God' rather than 'a god' (e.g. \"What is God? Everything\"),<ref group=\"nb\">fr. 129: {{lang|grc|\u03c4\u03af \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2; \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd}}</ref> but the implications are not given full expression and the poems are not examples of [[monotheism]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Nor do they vocalize a belief in Fate as the background to the gods, unlike the plays of [[Aeschylus]] for example. Pindar subjects both fortune and fate to divine will (e.g. \"child of Zeus...Fortune\").<ref>''Olympic Ode'' 12.1-2)</ref>{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=84}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=85}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=86}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=87}}\n[[File:Heracles.jpg|thumb|right|A short Heracles: Pindar once ignored the traditional image of Heracles, the supreme example of the heroic physique, and described him as short in order to compare him with a short patron.]]\nHe selects and revises traditional myths so as not to diminish the dignity and majesty of the gods. Such revisionism was not unique. [[Xenophanes]] had castigated [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]] for the misdeeds they ascribed to gods, such as theft, adultery and deception, and [[Pythagoras]] had envisioned those two poets being punished in Hades for blasphemy. A subtle example of Pindar's approach can be found in his treatment of the myth of Apollo's rape of the nymph [[Cyrene (mythology)|Cyrene]].<ref>''Pythian Ode'' 9</ref> As the god of the [[Delphic oracle]], Apollo is all-knowing, yet in keeping with his anthropomorphic nature he seeks information about the nymph from a third party, in this case the centaur [[Chiron]]. Chiron however affirms the god's omniscience with an elegant compliment, as if Apollo had only pretended to be ignorant: \"You, Sire, who know the appointed end of all...\"<ref group=\"nb\">Chiron's compliment to Apollo:<br>\"You, Sire, who know / The appointed end of all, and all paths: / How many leaves in April the earth puts forth, / How many grains of sand / In the sea and rivers / Are troubled by the waves and the swirling winds, / And what shall be, and whence it shall come / You see with clear eyes.\"</ref>{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=61}} Apollo's abduction of the nymph is not presented as a shameful act. Pindar's gods are above such ethical issues and it is not for men to judge them by ordinary human standards. Indeed, the finest breeds of men resulted from divine passions: \"For Pindar a mortal woman who is loved by a god is an outstanding lesson in divine favours handsomely bestowed\".{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=64}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=65}}\n\nBeing descendants of divine unions with privileged mortals, mythical heroes are an intermediate group between gods and men, and they are sympathetic to human ambitions. Thus, for example, Pindar not only invokes Zeus for help on behalf of the island of Aegina but also its national heroes [[Aeacus]], [[Peleus]] and [[Telamon]].<ref>''Pythian Ode'' 8.99\u2013100</ref> Unlike the gods, however, heroes can be judged according to ordinary human standards and they are sometimes shown in the poems to demean themselves. Even in that case, they receive special consideration. Thus Pindar refers obliquely to the murder of [[Phocus]] by his brothers Peleus and Telamon (\"I am shy of speaking of a huge risk, hazarded not in right\"), telling the audience that he will not talk of it (\"silence is a man's wisest counsel\").<ref group=\"nb\">''Nemean Odes'' 5.14\u201318:<br>I am shy of speaking of a huge risk / Hazarded not in right, / How they left the famous island, / And what fate drove strong men from the Vineland. / I shall halt. Truth does not always / Gain more if unflinching / She reveals her face; / And silence is often a man's wisest counsel.</ref>{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=67}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=68}} The Theban hero [[Heracles]] was a favourite subject but in one poem he is depicted as small in order to be compared with a small Theban patron who had won the [[pankration]] at the Isthmian Games:<ref>''Isthmian Odes'' 4.57</ref> a unique example of Pindar's readiness to shape traditional myths to fit the occasion, even if not always flattering to the mythical hero. A hero's status is not diminished by an occasional blemish but rests on a summary view of his heroic exploits.{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=47}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=48}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=71}}\n\nSome of his patrons claimed divine descent, such as [[Diagoras of Rhodes]], but Pindar makes all men akin to gods if they realize their full potential: their innate gifts are divinely bestowed, and even then success still depends on the gods' active favour. In honouring such men, therefore, Pindar was honouring the gods too.{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=66}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=67}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=96}} His statements about life after death were not self-consistent but that was typical for the times. Traditional ambivalence, as expressed by Homer, had been complicated by a growth of religious sects, such as the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] and [[Pythagoreanism]], representing various schemes of rewards and punishments in the next life. However, for the poet, glory and lasting fame were men's greatest assurance of a life well-lived.{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=89-96}} He presents no theory of history apart from the view that Fortune is variable even for the best men, an outlook suited to moderation in success, courage in adversity. Notions of 'good' and 'bad' in human nature were not analysed by him in any depth nor did he arrive at anything like the [[Simonides of Ceos#Ethics|compassionate ethics]] of his near contemporary, Simonides of Ceos.{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=76}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=77}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=120}} His poems are indifferent to the ordinary mass of people. They are dismissed with phrases such as \"the brute multitude\" (''Pythian Ode'' 2.87). Nor are the poems concerned with the fate of rich and powerful men once they lose their wealth and social status (compared for example with the bitter and disillusioned poems of [[Theognis of Megara]]). They are more interested in what successful men do with their good fortune: success brings obligations, and religious and artistic activities need patrons.{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=100}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=101}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=102}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=103}}\n\nWhereas the [[Muses]] inspired Homer with relevant information and with the language to express it, Pindar seems to receive only their inspiration: his role is to shape that inspiration with his own wisdom and skill. Like his patrons, whom he immortalizes in verse, he owes his success to hard work as well as to innate gifts; though he hires himself out, he has a vocation. The Muses are to him as an oracle is to a prophet, and lesser poets are to him as ravens are to an eagle; the art of such men is as hackneyed as garland-making; his is magical:{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=4}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=5}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=6}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=7}}\n{|style=\"border: 0px; margin-left:100px; white-space:nowrap;\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"400px\" |\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"400px\" |\n|- border=\"0\"\n|- Valign=top\n|\n{{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f34\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c6\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bb\u03b1\u03c6\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd: \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf: \u039c\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c3\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 <br>\n\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u1fb7 \u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u1f78\u03bd \u1f14\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5 \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd \u1f10\u03bb\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u1fbd \u1f01\u03bc\u1fb7 <br>\n\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c6\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c3\u1fbd \u1f10\u03ad\u03c1\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2.}}\n|\nTo plait garlands is easy.

The establishment of these athletic and musical festivals was among the greatest achievements of the Greek aristocracies. Even in the 5th century BC, when there was an increased tendency towards professionalism, they were predominantly aristocratic assemblies, reflecting the expense and leisure needed to attend such events either as a competitor or spectator. Attendance was an opportunity for display and self-promotion, and the prestige of victory, requiring commitment in time and/or wealth, went far beyond anything that accrues to athletic victories today, even in spite of the modern preoccupation with sport.<ref>Antony Andrewes, ''Greek Society'', Pelican Books (1971), pp. 219\u201322</ref> Pindar's odes capture something of the prestige and the aristocratic grandeur of the moment of victory, as in this stanza from one of his Isthmian Odes, here translated by Geoffrey S. Conway:\n\n:::::If ever a man strives\n:::With all his soul's endeavour, sparing himself\n:::Neither expense nor labour to attain\n:::True excellence, then must we give to those\n:::Who have achieved the goal, a proud tribute\n:::::Of lordly praise, and shun\n::::All thoughts of envious jealousy.\n:::To a poet's mind the gift is slight, to speak\n:::A kind word for unnumbered toils, and build\n:::For all to share a monument of beauty. (''Isthmian'' I, antistrophe 3)<ref>Pindar (1972) p. 235</ref>\n\nHis victory odes are grouped into four books named after the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympian]], [[Pythian Games|Pythian]], [[Isthmian Games|Isthmian]], and [[Nemean Games]]{{spaced ndash}}Panhellenic festivals held respectively at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], [[Delphi]], [[Corinth]] and [[Nemea]]. This reflects the fact that most of the odes were composed in honour of boys, youths, and men who had recently enjoyed victories in athletic (and sometimes musical) contests at those festivals. In a few odes however much older victories, and even victories in lesser games, are celebrated, often as a pretext for addressing other issues or achievements. For example, ''Pythian 3'', composed in honour of Hieron of Syracuse, briefly mentions a victory he had once enjoyed at the Pythian Games, but it is actually intended to console him for his chronic illness (similarly, ''Pythian'' 2 is like a private letter in its intimacy).<ref name=Conway72-88-96>Pindar (1972), p. 88. 96</ref> ''Nemean 9'' and ''Nemean 10'' celebrate victories in games at [[Sicyon]] and [[Argos]], and ''Nemean 11'' celebrates a victory in a municipal election on [[Ancient Tenedos|Tenedos]] (though it also mentions some obscure athletic victories). These three odes are the final odes in the ''Nemean'' book of odes, and there is a reason for their inclusion. In the original manuscripts, the four books of odes were arranged in the order of importance assigned to the festivals, with the Nemean festival, considered least important, coming last. Victory odes that lacked a Panhellenic subject were then bundled together at the end of the book of ''Nemean'' odes.<ref name=Conway72-xx>Pindar (1972) Introduction p. xx</ref>\n\n====Style====\nPindar's poetic style is very distinctive, even when the peculiarities of the genre are set aside. The odes typically feature a grand and arresting opening, often with an architectural metaphor or a resounding invocation to a place or goddess. He makes rich use of decorative language and florid compound adjectives.<ref name=\"Charles Segal 1985 page 232\">Charles Segal, 'Choral Lyric in the Fifth Century', in Easterling, p. 232</ref> Sentences are compressed to the point of obscurity, unusual words and periphrases give the language an esoteric quality, and transitions in meaning often seem erratic, the images seem to burst out{{spaced ndash}}it is a style that sometimes baffles but also makes his poetry vivid and unforgettable.<ref>de Romilly, p. 38</ref>\n{{Quotation|Pindar's power does not lie in the pedigrees of ... athletes ...

Archilochus was an [[Iambus (genre)|iambic]] poet, working within a genre that licensed abusive and scurrilous verse{{spaced ndash}}a regrettable tendency from the viewpoint of Pindar, whose own persona is intensely earnest, preaching to Hieron the need for moderation (wealth with wisdom) and submission to the divine will. The reference to the embittered poet appears to be Pindar's meditative response to some intrigues at Hieron's court, possibly by his rivals, condemned elsewhere as ''a pair of ravens'' (''Olympian 2''). The intensity of the stanza suggests that it is the culmination and climax of the poem. In fact, the stanza occupies the middle of ''Pythian 2'' and the intensity is sustained throughout the poem from beginning to end. It is the sustained intensity of his poetry that Quintilian refers to above as a ''rolling flood of eloquence'' and Horace below refers to as the ''uncontrollable momentum'' of a river that has burst its banks. [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]] likens him to ''a vast fire''<ref>''De Subl.'' 33.5</ref> and [[Athenaeus]] refers to him as ''the great-voiced Pindar''.<ref>Athenaeus 13.5.64c</ref>\n\nPindar's treatment of myth is another unique aspect of his style, often involving variations on the traditional stories,<ref>Bowie, pp. 107\u20138</ref> since his original audience was familiar with the myths and this allowed him to concentrate on unique and surprising effects. Reversing the chronological order was one such effect, as in ''Olympian VII'' dedicated to Diagoras of Rhodes, but this could also resemble a circular pattern, beginning with a culminating event, followed by scenes leading up to it, and ending with its restatement, as in his account of the [[Dioscuri]] in ''Nemean 10''.{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=310}} Myths enabled him to develop the themes and lessons that pre-occupy him{{spaced ndash}}in particular mankind's exulted relation with the gods via heroic ancestors and, in contrast, the limitations and uncertainties of human existence{{spaced ndash}}but sometimes the traditional stories were an embarrassment and were carefully edited, as for example:\n\"Be still my tongue: here profits not / to tell the whole truth with clear face unveiled,\" (''Nemean 5'', epode 1); \"Away, away this story! / Let no such tale fall from my lips! / For to insult the gods is a fool's wisdom,\" (''Olympian 9'', strophe 2); \"Senseless, I hold it, for a man to say / the gods eat mortal flesh. / I spurn the thought,\" (''Olympian 1'', epode 2).<ref>Pindar (1972) pp. 192, 54, 4, respectively</ref> His mythical accounts are edited for dramatic and graphic effects, usually unfolding through a few grand gestures against a background of large, often symbolic elements such as sea, sky, darkness, fire or mountain.<ref name=\"Charles Segal 1985 page 232\"/>\n\n====Structure====\nPindar's odes typically begin with an invocation to a god or the Muses, followed by praise of the victor and often of his family, ancestors and home-town. Then follows a narrated myth, usually occupying the central and longest section of the poem, which exemplify a moral, while aligning the poet and his audience with the world of gods and heroes.<ref>Bowie, p. 108</ref> The ode usually ends in more eulogies, for example of trainers (if the victor is a boy), and of relatives who have won past events, as well as with prayers or expressions of hope for future success.<ref name=\"Geoffrey S. Conway 1972\">Pindar (1972)</ref> The event where the victory was gained is never described in detail, but there is often some mention of the hard work needed to bring the victory about.\n\nA lot of modern criticism tries to find hidden structure or some unifying principle within the odes. 19th century criticism favoured 'gnomic unity' i.e. that each ode is bound together by the kind of moralizing or philosophic vision typical of archaic [[Gnomic poetry]]. Later critics sought unity in the way certain words or images are repeated and developed within a particular ode. For others, the odes are just celebrations of men and their communities, in which the elements such as myths, piety, and ethics are stock themes that the poet introduces without much real thought. Some conclude that the requirement for unity is too modern to have informed Pindar's ancient approach to a traditional craft.<ref name=\"Douglas E. Gerber 1997 page 255\"/>\n\nThe great majority of the odes are triadic in structure{{spaced ndash}}i.e., stanzas are grouped together in three's as a lyrical unit. Each triad comprises two stanzas identical in length and meter (called 'strophe' and 'antistrophe') and a third stanza (called an 'epode'), differing in length and meter but rounding off the lyrical movement in some way. The shortest odes comprise a single triad, the largest (''Pythian 4'') comprises thirteen triads. Seven of the odes however are monostrophic (i.e., each stanza in the ode is identical in length and meter). The monostrophic odes seem to have been composed for victory marches or processions, whereas the triadic odes appear suited to choral dances.<ref name=\"Geoffrey S. Conway 1972\"/> Pindar's metrical rhythms are nothing like the simple, repetitive rhythms familiar to readers of English verse{{spaced ndash}}typically the rhythm of any given line recurs infrequently (for example, only once every ten, fifteen or twenty lines). This adds to the aura of complexity that surrounds Pindar's work. In terms of meter, the odes fall roughly into two categories{{spaced ndash}}about half are in [[dactylo-epitrite]]s (a meter found for example in the works of [[Stesichorus]], Simonides and Bacchylides) and the other half are in [[Aeolic verse#Choral Aeolics|Aeolic metres]] based on iambs and choriambs.<ref name=\"Douglas E. Gerber 1997 page 255\"/>\n\n====Chronological order====\nModern editors (e.g., Snell and Maehler in their [[Teubner]] edition), have assigned dates, securely or tentatively, to Pindar's victory odes, based on ancient sources and other grounds. The date of an athletic victory is not always the date of composition but often serves merely as a ''terminus post quem''. Many dates are based on comments by ancient sources who had access to published lists of victors, such as the Olympic list compiled by [[Hippias of Elis]], and lists of Pythian victors made by [[Aristotle]] and [[Callisthenes]]. There were however no such lists for the Isthmian and Nemean Games<ref>Currie, p. 25</ref>{{spaced ndash}}[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (6.13.8) complained that the Corinthians and Argives never kept proper records. The resulting uncertainty is reflected in the chronology below, with question marks clustered around Nemean and Isthmian entries, and yet it still represents a fairly clear general timeline of Pindar's career as an epinician poet.

Some are only preserved as fragments via quotes by ancient sources and papyri unearthed by archeologists, as at [[Oxyrhynchus]]{{spaced ndash}}in fact the extant works of most of the other [[Nine lyric poets|canonic lyric poets]] have survived only in this tattered form. Pindar's extant verses are unique in that the bulk of them{{spaced ndash}}the victory odes{{spaced ndash}}have been preserved in a manuscript tradition, i.e., generations of scribes copying from earlier copies, possibly originating in a single archetypal copy and sometimes graphically demonstrated by modern scholars in the form of a [[Stemmatics|stemma codicum]], resembling a 'family tree'. Pindar's victory odes are preserved in just two manuscripts, but incomplete collections are located in many others, and all date from the mediaeval period. Some scholars have traced a stemma through these manuscripts, for example [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]], who inferred from them the existence of a common source or archetype dated no earlier than the 2nd century AD, while others, such as [[C.M. Bowra]], have argued that there are too many discrepancies between manuscripts to identify a specific lineage, even while accepting the existence of an archetype. Otto Schroeder identified two families of manuscripts but, following on the work of Polish-born classicist, Alexander Turyn,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Alexander Turyn|journal=Gnomon|volume=54|year=1982|pages=97\u201398|jstor=27688007|author=Miroslav Marcovich|issue=1}}</ref> Bowra rejected this also.<ref>Bowra, Praefatio iii\u2013iv, vii</ref> Different scholars interpret the extant manuscripts differently. Bowra for example singled out seven manuscripts as his primary sources (see below), all featuring errors and/or gaps due to loss of folios and careless copying, and one arguably characterized by the dubious interpolations of Byzantine scholars. These he cross-referenced and then supplemented or verified by reference to other, still more doubtful manuscripts, and some papyrus fragments{{spaced ndash}}a combination of sources on which he based his own edition of the odes and fragments. His general method of selection he defined as follows:\n{{Quote|Where all the codices agree, there perhaps the true reading shines out. Where however they differ, the preferred reading is that which best fits the sense, meter, [[scholia]] and grammatic conventions. Wherever moreover two or more readings of equal weight are found in the codices, I have chosen that which smacks most of Pindar. Yet this difficulty rarely occurs, and in many places the true reading will be found if you examine and compare the language of the codices with that of other Greek poets and especially of Pindar himself.<ref>Bowra, Praefatio iv</ref>}}\n::::'''Selected manuscripts{{spaced ndash}}a sample of preferred sources (Bowra's choice, 1947)'''\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Code\n!

His masterpiece ''Aetia'' included an elegy in honour of Queen [[Berenice]], celebrating a chariot victory at the Nemean Games, composed in a style and presented in a manner that recall Pindar.<ref>A.W. Bulloch, 'Hellenistic Poetry', in Easterling, pp. 556\u201357</ref>\n* The Hellenistic epic ''[[Argonautica]]'', by [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius Rhodius]], was influenced by some aspects of Pindar's style and his use of episodic vignettes in narrative. The epic concerns the adventures of [[Jason]], also touched on by Pindar in ''Pythian'' 4, and both poems link the myth to a Greek audience in Africa.<ref>William H. Race, ''Apollonius Rhodius: Argonautica'', Loeb Classical Library (2008), page xiii</ref>\n* There seems to have been a vogue for Pindaric-style lyrics following the 'publication' of Horace's ''Odes'' 1\u20133{{spaced ndash}}Horace had mastered other styles such as Sapphic and Alcaeic, which had discouraged his contemporaries from attempting anything in the same form, but he had not composed anything in triadic stanzas in the manner of Pindar.<ref>R. Tarrant, 'Ancient receptions of Horace', in ''The Cambridge Companion to Horace'', Stephen Harrison (ed.), Cambridge university Press (2007), page 280</ref>\n* Pindar was much read, quoted, and copied during the [[Byzantine Era]]. For example, [[Christophoros Mytilenaios]] of the 11th century parodied a chariot race in his sixth poem employing explicit allusions to Pindar.<ref>F. Lauritzen, Readers of Pindar and students of Mitylinaios, ''Byzantion '' 2010</ref>\n* During the 17th and 18th centuries, literary theorists in Europe distinguished between two types of lyric poetry, loosely associated with Horace and Pindar. Regular verses in four line stanzas were associated with Horace's Odes, which did in fact inspire and influence poets of the period. Irregular verses in longer stanzas were termed [[Pindarics]] though the association with Pindar was largely fanciful. [[Abraham Cowley]] was considered the main exponent of English Pindarics. In fact, the two styles were not always easy to distinguish and many 'Pindaric' odes were quite Horatian in content, as in some poems by [[Thomas Gray]].<ref>David Money, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oQ5Ep2tR8R8C&pg=PA327 'The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries'], in ''The Cambridge Companion to Horace'', Stephen Harrison (ed), Cambridge University Press (2007), pp. 327\u201328 {{ISBN|0-521-83002-8}}</ref>\n* A 'Pindaric Ode' was composed for the revived 1896 Olympic Games in Athens by the Oxford scholar George Stuart Robinson, and similar compositions were commissioned from and composed by classicist [[Armand D'Angour]] for the Athens Olympics in 2004 and the London Olympics in 2012.\n\n===Horace's tribute===\nThe Latin poet, [[Horace|Quintus Horatius Flaccus]], was an admirer of Pindar's style. He described it in one of his [[Sappho|Sapphic]] poems, addressed to a friend, [[Iullus Antonius]]:\n{|style=\"border: 0px; margin-left:100px; white-space:nowrap;\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"400px\" |\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"400px\" |\n|- border=\"0\"\n|- Valign=top\n|\nPindarum quisquis studet aemulari,<br>\nIule, ceratis ope Daedalea<br>\nnititur pennis vitreo daturus<br>\nnomina ponto.<br>\n<br>\nmonte decurrens velut amnis, imbres<br>\nquem super notas aluere ripas,<br>\nfervet immensusque ruit profundo<br>\nPindarus ore.

M. Bowra]], the leading Pindaric scholar of his generation, and the editor of the 1935 [[Oxford University Press|O.U.P]] edition of his poems, summarized Pindar's qualities in the following words:\n{{quote|\"His innate, unquestioning pride in his poetical mission means that he gives to it all his gifts and all his efforts. The result is a poetry that by any standards deserves the name because it is based on a radiant vision of reality and fashioned with so subtle, so adventurous, and so dedicated an art that it is worthy to be an earthly counterpart of the songs which Pindar regards as the archetype of music on those lofty occasions when all discords are resolved and all misgivings obliterated by the power of the life-giving word.\"{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=401}}}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pindarics]]\n* [[John Wolcot]]\n* [[Pindar's First Olympian Ode]]\n* [[Pindar's First Pythian Ode]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"nb\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bowie, Ewen, 'Lyric and Elegiac Poetry' in ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'', J.

[[Quintilian]] wrote, \"Of the nine lyric poets, Pindar is by far the greatest, in virtue of his inspired magnificence, the beauty of his thoughts and figures, the rich exuberance of his language and matter, and his rolling flood of eloquence, characteristics which, as [[Horace]] rightly held, make him inimitable.\"<ref>[[Quintilian]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/10A*.html#1.61 10.1.61]; cf. [[Longinus (literature)|Pseudo-Longinus]] [http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/longinus/desub011.htm#xxxiii 33.5].</ref> His poems can also, however, seem difficult and even peculiar. The Athenian comic playwright [[Eupolis]] once remarked that they \"are already reduced to silence by the disinclination of the multitude for elegant learning\".<ref>''Eupolis'' F366 Kock, 398 K/A, from Athenaeus 3a, (''[[Deipnosophistae]]'', epitome of book I)</ref> Some scholars in the modern age also found his poetry perplexing, at least until the 1896 discovery of some poems by his rival [[Bacchylides]]; comparisons of their work showed that many of Pindar's idiosyncrasies are typical of archaic genres rather than of only the poet himself. His poetry, while admired by critics, still challenges the casual reader and his work is largely unread among the general public.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Some Aspects of Pindar's Style|author=Lawrence Henry Baker|journal=The Sewanee Review|volume=31|issue=1|year=1923|jstor=27533621|pages=100\u2013110}}</ref>\n\nPindar was the first Greek poet to reflect on the nature of poetry and on the poet's role.<ref>Gerber, p. 261</ref> Like other poets of the Archaic Age, he has a profound sense of the vicissitudes of life, but he also articulates a passionate faith in what men can achieve by the grace of the gods, most famously expressed in the conclusion to one of his [[Epinikion|Victory Odes]]:<ref>de Romilly, p. 37</ref>\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nCreatures of a day!

His father's name is variously given as Daiphantus, Pagondas or Scopelinus, and his mother's name was Cleodice.<ref name=\"Greek Lyric Poets' 1997 page 253\">Gerber, p. 253</ref> It is told that he was stung on the mouth by a [[bee]] in his youth and this was the reason he became a poet of honey-like verses (an identical fate has been ascribed to other poets of the archaic period). Pindar was about twenty years old in 498 BC when he was commissioned by the ruling family in [[Thessaly]] to compose his first victory ode (''Pythian 10''). He studied the art of lyric poetry in Athens, where his tutor was [[Lasos of Hermione]], and he is also said to have received some helpful criticism from [[Corinna]].\n\nThe early-to-middle years of Pindar's career coincided with the Persian invasions of Greece in the reigns of [[Darius the Great|Darius]] and [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]. During the invasion in 480/79 BC, when Pindar was almost forty years old, [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] was occupied by Xerxes' general, [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]], who with many Theban aristocrats subsequently perished at the [[Battle of Plataea]]. It is possible that Pindar spent much of this time at [[Aegina]]. His choice of residence during the earlier invasion in 490 BC is not known, but he was able to attend the [[Pythian Games]] for that year, where he first met the Sicilian prince, Thrasybulus, nephew of [[Theron of Acragas]]. Thrasybulus had driven the winning chariot and he and Pindar were to form a lasting friendship, paving the way for his subsequent visit to Sicily.\n\n====Middle age====\nPindar seems to have used his odes to advance his, and his friends', personal interests.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=311420|author=Hubbard, T. K.|title=Remaking Myth and Rewriting History: Cult Tradition in Pindar's Ninth Nemean'|journal= Harvard Studies in Classical Philology|volume=94|year=1992|pages=77\u2013111 [78]|doi=10.2307/311420}}</ref> In 462 BC he composed two odes in honour of Arcesilas, king of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], (''Pythians 4 and 5''), pleading for the return from exile of a friend, Demophilus. In the latter ode Pindar proudly mentions his own ancestry, which he shared with the king, as an Aegeid or descendant of [[Aegeus]], the legendary king of Athens. The clan was influential in many parts of the Greek world, having intermarried with ruling families in Thebes, in [[Laconia (ancient region)|Lacedaemonia]], and in cities that claimed Lacedaemonian descent, such as Cyrene and [[Santorini|Thera]]. The historian [[Herodotus]] considered the clan important enough to deserve mention (''Histories'' IV.147). Membership of this clan possibly contributed to Pindar's success as a poet, and it informed his political views, which are marked by a conservative preference for oligarchic governments of the [[Dorians|Doric]] kind.\n\n<blockquote>\"Pindar might not actually claim to be an Aegeid since his 'I' statements do not necessarily refer to himself. The Aegeid clan did however have a branch in Thebes, and his reference to 'my ancestors' in Pythian 5 could have been spoken on behalf of both Arcesilas and himself{{spaced ndash}}he may have used this ambivalence to establish a personal link with his patrons.\"<ref>Gerber, p. 270</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe was possibly the Theban [[proxenos]] or consul for Aegina and/or [[Molossia]], as indicated in another of his odes, Nemean 7,{{sfn|Hornblower|2004|p=177}}{{sfn|Hornblower|2004|p=178}}{{sfn|Hornblower|2004|p=179}}{{sfn|Hornblower|2004|p=180}} in which he glorifies [[Neoptolemus]], a national hero of Aegina and Molossia. According to tradition, Neoptolemus died disgracefully in a fight with priests at the temple in [[Delphi]] over their share of some sacrificial meat. Pindar diplomatically glosses over this and concludes mysteriously with an earnest protestation of innocence{{spaced ndash}}\"But shall my heart never admit that I with words none can redeem dishonoured Neoptolemus\". Possibly he was responding to anger among Aeginetans and/or Molossians over his portrayal of Neoptolemus in an earlier poem, ''[[Paean]] 6'', which had been commissioned by the priests at Delphi and which depicted the hero's death in traditional terms, as divine retribution for his crimes.\n\n<blockquote>\"Some doubt this biographical interpretation of ''Nemean 7'' since it is largely based on marginal comments by [[scholiast]]s and Pindaric scholiasts are often unreliable. The fact that Pindar gave different versions of the myth may simply reflect the needs of different genres, and does not necessarily indicate a personal dilemma.<ref>Ian Rutherford, ''Pindar's Paeans'', Oxford University Press (2001), pp. 321\u201322</ref> ''Nemean 7'' in fact is the most controversial and obscure of Pindar's victory odes, and scholars ancient and modern have been ingenious and imaginative in their attempts to explain it, so far with no agreed success.\"<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=1087989|author=Woodbury, Leonard|title=Neoptolemus at Delphi: Pindar, Nem.7.30ff|journal=Phoenix|volume=33|issue=2|year=1979| pages=95\u2013133|doi=10.2307/1087989}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his first Pythian ode, composed in 470 BC in honour of the Sicilian tyrant [[Hieron of Syracuse|Hieron]], Pindar celebrated a series of victories by Greeks against foreign invaders: Athenian and Spartan-led victories against Persia at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] and [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]], and victories by the western Greeks led by [[Theron of Acragas]] and Hieron against the Carthaginians and Etruscans at the battles of [[Battle of Himera (480 BC)|Himera]] and [[Battle of Cumae|Cumae]]. Such celebrations were not appreciated by his fellow Thebans: they had sided with the Persians and had incurred many losses and privations as a result of their defeat. His praise of Athens with such epithets as ''bulwark of [[Ancient Greece|Hellas]]'' (''fragment 76'') and ''city of noble name and sunlit splendour'' (Nemean 5) induced the authorities in Thebes to fine him 5000 drachmae, to which the Athenians are said to have responded with a gift of 10000 drachmae. According to another account,<ref>[[Isocrates]] 15.166</ref> the Athenians even made him their proxenus or consul in Thebes. His association with the fabulously rich Hieron was another source of annoyance at home. It was probably in response to Theban sensitivities over this issue that he denounced the rule of tyrants (i.e. rulers like Hieron) in an ode composed shortly after a visit to Hieron's sumptuous court in 476\u201375 BC (''Pythian 11'').<ref>Pindar (1972) p. 158</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"Pindar's actual phrasing in ''Pythian 11'' was \"I deplore the lot of tyrants\" and though this was traditionally interpreted as an apology for his dealings with Sicilian tyrants like Hieron, an alternative date for the ode has led some scholars to conclude that it was in fact a covert reference to the tyrannical behaviour of the Athenians, although this interpretation is ruled out if we accept the earlier note about covert references. According to yet another interpretation Pindar is simply delivering a formulaic warning to the successful athlete to avoid [[hubris]].{{sfn|Hornblower|2004|p=59}} It is highly unlikely that Pindar ever acted for Athenians as their proxenus or consul in Thebes.\"{{sfn|Hornblower|2004|p=57}}</blockquote>\n\nLyric verse was conventionally accompanied by music and dance, and Pindar himself wrote the music and choreographed the dances for his victory odes. Sometimes he trained the performers at his home in Thebes, and sometimes he trained them at the venue where they performed. Commissions took him to all parts of the Greek world{{spaced ndash}}to the Panhellenic festivals in mainland Greece (Olympia, Delphi, Corinth and Nemea), westwards to Sicily, eastwards to the seaboard of Asia Minor, north to [[Macedon]]ia and [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] (''Paean 2'') and south to Cyrene on the African coast. Other poets at the same venues vied with him for the favours of patrons. His poetry sometimes reflects this rivalry. For example, ''Olympian 2'' and ''Pythian 2'', composed in honour of the Sicilian tyrants Theron and Hieron following his visit to their courts in 476\u201375 BC, refer respectively to ''ravens'' and an ''ape'', apparently signifying rivals who were engaged in a campaign of smears against him{{spaced ndash}}possibly the poets [[Simonides]] and his nephew [[Bacchylides]].<ref>Pindar (1972) pp. 10, 88\u20139</ref> Pindar's original treatment of narrative myth, often relating events in reverse chronological order, is said to have been a favourite target for criticism.<ref>Pindar (1972) Introduction p. XIII</ref> Simonides was known to charge high fees for his work and Pindar is said to have alluded to this in ''Isthmian 2'', where he refers to the Muse as \"a hireling journeyman\". He appeared in many poetry competitions and was defeated five times by his compatriot, the poet [[Corinna]], in revenge of which he called her ''Boeotian sow'' in one of his odes (''Olympian'' 6. 89f.).\n\n<blockquote>\"It was assumed by ancient sources that Pindar's odes were performed by a chorus, but this has been challenged by some modern scholars, who argue that the odes were in fact performed solo.{{sfn|Hornblower|2004|p=16}} It is not known how commissions were arranged, nor if the poet travelled widely: even when poems include statements like \"I have come\" it is not certain that this was meant literally.<ref>Race, pp. 10\u201311</ref> Uncomplimentary references to Bacchylides and Simonides were found by [[scholiasts]] but there is no reason to accept their interpretation of the odes.<ref>David Campbell, ''Greek Lyric IV'', Loeb Classical Library (1992), page 6</ref> In fact, some scholars have interpreted the allusions to fees in ''Isthmian 2'' as a request by Pindar for payment of fees owed to himself.<ref>Pindar (1972) p. 239</ref> His defeats by Corinna were probably invented by ancient commentators to account for the ''Boeotian sow'' remark, a phrase moreover that was completely misunderstood by scholiasts, since Pindar was scoffing at a reputation that all Boeotians had for stupidity.\"<ref>D. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric IV'', p. 2</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Old age and death====\nHis fame as a poet drew Pindar into Greek politics. Athens, the most important city in Greece throughout his poetic career, was a rival of his home city, [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], and also of the island state [[Aegina]], whose leading citizens commissioned about a quarter of his Victory Odes. There is no open condemnation of the Athenians in any of his poems but criticism is implied. For example, the victory ode mentioned above (''Pythian 8'') describes the downfall of the giants [[Porphyrion]] and [[Typhon]] and this might be Pindar's way of covertly celebrating a recent defeat of Athens by Thebes at the [[Battle of Coronea (447 BC)|Battle of Coronea]] (447 BC).<ref>Pindar (1972), p. 138</ref> The poem ends with a prayer for Aegina's freedom, long threatened by Athenian ambitions.\n<blockquote>Covert criticism of Athens (traditionally located in odes such as ''Pythian'' 8, ''Nemean'' 8 and ''Isthmian'' 7) is now dismissed as highly unlikely, even by scholars who allow some biographical and historical interpretations of the poems.<ref>Charles Segal, 'Choral Lyric in the Fifth Century', in Easterling, pp. 231\u2013232</ref></blockquote>\n\nOne of his last odes (''Pythian 8'') indicates that he lived near a shrine to the oracle [[Alcmaeon (mythology)|Alcmaeon]] and that he stored some of his wealth there. In the same ode he says that he had recently received a prophecy from Alcmaeon during a journey to Delphi (\"...he met me and proved the skills of prophecy that all his race inherit\")<ref>Pindar (1972) p. 142</ref> but he does not reveal what the long-dead prophet said to him nor in what form he appeared.<ref group=\"nb\">There are several other accounts of supernatural visitations relating to Pindar (see for example C.M. Bowra, ''Pindar'', pages 49-51). According to a [[scholium]], he and a pupil, Olympichus, once saw a mysterious flame on a mountain, attended by strange noises. Pindar then beheld [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], the Mother of the Gods, advancing in the form of a wooden image. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (9.25.3) reported that he set up a monument near his home, dedicated conjointly to Pan and the Mother of the Gods ({{lang|grc|\u0394\u03b9\u03bd\u03b4\u03c5\u03bc\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7}}). According to [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]] (''Proem.'' 27, p. 298. 9 Dr) and ''Vit. Ambr.'' (p. 2. 2 Dr.), Pan was once heard between [[Cithaeron]] and [[Mount Helicon|Helicon]] singing a [[paean]] composed to him by Pindar (fr. 85).</ref>  The ode was written to commemorate a victory by an athlete from [[Aegina]].\n\n<blockquote>\"Pindar doesn't necessarily mean himself when he uses the first person singular. Many of his 'I' statements are generic, indicating somebody engaged in the role of a singer i.e. a 'bardic' I. Other 'I' statements articulate values typical of the audience, and some are spoken on behalf of the subjects celebrated in the poems.<ref>Currie, p. 20</ref> The 'I' that received the prophecy in ''Pythian 8'' therefore might have been the athlete from Aegina, not Pindar. In that case the prophecy must have been about his performance at the Pythian Games, and the property stored at the shrine was just a votive offering.\"<ref>Gerber, pp. 268\u2013269</ref></blockquote>\n\nNothing is recorded about Pindar's wife and son except their names, Megacleia and Daiphantus. About ten days before he died, the goddess [[Persephone]] appeared to him and complained that she was the only divinity to whom he had never composed a hymn. She said he would come to her soon and compose one then.\n\nPindar lived to about eighty years of age. He died around 438 BC while attending a festival at [[Argos]]. His ashes were taken back home to Thebes by his musically-gifted daughters, Eumetis and Protomache.\n\n====Post mortem====\nOne of Pindar's female relatives claimed that he dictated some verses to her in honour of Persephone after he had been dead for several days. Some of Pindar's verses were inscribed in letters of gold on a temple wall in [[Lindos]], Rhodes. At Delphi, where he had been elected a priest of Apollo, the priests exhibited an iron chair on which he used to sit during the festival of the [[Theoxenia]]. Every night, while closing the temple doors, they intoned: \"Let Pindar the poet go unto the supper of the gods!\"\n\nPindar's house in [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] became one of the city's landmarks. When [[Alexander the Great]] [[Battle of Thebes|demolished Thebes]] in 335&nbsp;BC, as punishment for its resistance to Macedonian expansionism, he ordered the house be left intact out of gratitude for verses praising his ancestor, [[Alexander I of Macedon]].<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Alexander'' 11.6; [[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' 1.9.10</ref>\n\n===Values and beliefs===\nPindar's values and beliefs have been inferred from his poetry. No other ancient Greek poet has left so many comments about the nature of his art. He justified and exalted [[choral poetry]] at a time when society was turning away from it. It \"...had for two centuries reflected and shaped the sentiments, the outlook, and the convictions of the Greek aristocracies...and Pindar spoke up for it with passionate assurance\".{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=2}} His poetry is a meeting ground for gods, heroes and men{{spaced ndash}}even the dead are spoken of as participants: \"Deep in the earth their heart listens\".{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=38}}\n\nHis view of the gods is traditional but more self-consistent than [[Homer]]'s and more reverent. He never depicts gods in a demeaning role. He seems indifferent to the intellectual reforms that were shaping the theology of the times. Thus an eclipse is not a mere physical effect, as contemplated by early thinkers such as [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]] and [[Heraclitus]], nor was it even a subject for bold wonder, as it was for an earlier poet, [[Archilochus]];<ref>Archilochus fr. 122 West</ref> instead Pindar treated an eclipse as a portent of evil.<ref group=\"nb\">''Paean'' 9.13-20). The eclipse is mentioned in a fragment quoted by [[Stobaeus]], addressed to the Thebans:<br>Is it some sign of war you bring? / Or blight on crops, or snow-fall's strength / Beyond all telling, or murderous strife at home, / Or emptying of the sea on land, / Or frost binding the earth, or south-wind in summer / With a flood of furious rain, / Or will you drown the land and raise / A new breed of men from the beginning?</ref>{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=83}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=84}}\n\nGods are the embodiment of power, uncompromisingly proud of their nature and violent in defense of their privileges.{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=42}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=43}} There is some rationalization of religious belief, but it is within a tradition at least as old as [[Hesiod]], where abstractions are personified, such as \"Truth the daughter of Zeus\".<ref>''Olympic Ode'' 10.3-4</ref> Sometimes the wording suggests a belief in 'God' rather than 'a god' (e.g. \"What is God? Everything\"),<ref group=\"nb\">fr. 129: {{lang|grc|\u03c4\u03af \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2; \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd}}</ref> but the implications are not given full expression and the poems are not examples of [[monotheism]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Nor do they vocalize a belief in Fate as the background to the gods, unlike the plays of [[Aeschylus]] for example. Pindar subjects both fortune and fate to divine will (e.g. \"child of Zeus...Fortune\").<ref>''Olympic Ode'' 12.1-2)</ref>{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=84}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=85}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=86}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=87}}\n[[File:Heracles.jpg|thumb|right|A short Heracles: Pindar once ignored the traditional image of Heracles, the supreme example of the heroic physique, and described him as short in order to compare him with a short patron.]]\nHe selects and revises traditional myths so as not to diminish the dignity and majesty of the gods. Such revisionism was not unique. [[Xenophanes]] had castigated [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]] for the misdeeds they ascribed to gods, such as theft, adultery and deception, and [[Pythagoras]] had envisioned those two poets being punished in Hades for blasphemy. A subtle example of Pindar's approach can be found in his treatment of the myth of Apollo's rape of the nymph [[Cyrene (mythology)|Cyrene]].<ref>''Pythian Ode'' 9</ref> As the god of the [[Delphic oracle]], Apollo is all-knowing, yet in keeping with his anthropomorphic nature he seeks information about the nymph from a third party, in this case the centaur [[Chiron]]. Chiron however affirms the god's omniscience with an elegant compliment, as if Apollo had only pretended to be ignorant: \"You, Sire, who know the appointed end of all...\"<ref group=\"nb\">Chiron's compliment to Apollo:<br>\"You, Sire, who know / The appointed end of all, and all paths: / How many leaves in April the earth puts forth, / How many grains of sand / In the sea and rivers / Are troubled by the waves and the swirling winds, / And what shall be, and whence it shall come / You see with clear eyes.\"</ref>{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=61}} Apollo's abduction of the nymph is not presented as a shameful act. Pindar's gods are above such ethical issues and it is not for men to judge them by ordinary human standards. Indeed, the finest breeds of men resulted from divine passions: \"For Pindar a mortal woman who is loved by a god is an outstanding lesson in divine favours handsomely bestowed\".{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=64}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=65}}\n\nBeing descendants of divine unions with privileged mortals, mythical heroes are an intermediate group between gods and men, and they are sympathetic to human ambitions. Thus, for example, Pindar not only invokes Zeus for help on behalf of the island of Aegina but also its national heroes [[Aeacus]], [[Peleus]] and [[Telamon]].<ref>''Pythian Ode'' 8.99\u2013100</ref> Unlike the gods, however, heroes can be judged according to ordinary human standards and they are sometimes shown in the poems to demean themselves. Even in that case, they receive special consideration. Thus Pindar refers obliquely to the murder of [[Phocus]] by his brothers Peleus and Telamon (\"I am shy of speaking of a huge risk, hazarded not in right\"), telling the audience that he will not talk of it (\"silence is a man's wisest counsel\").<ref group=\"nb\">''Nemean Odes'' 5.14\u201318:<br>I am shy of speaking of a huge risk / Hazarded not in right, / How they left the famous island, / And what fate drove strong men from the Vineland. / I shall halt. Truth does not always / Gain more if unflinching / She reveals her face; / And silence is often a man's wisest counsel.</ref>{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=67}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=68}} The Theban hero [[Heracles]] was a favourite subject but in one poem he is depicted as small in order to be compared with a small Theban patron who had won the [[pankration]] at the Isthmian Games:<ref>''Isthmian Odes'' 4.57</ref> a unique example of Pindar's readiness to shape traditional myths to fit the occasion, even if not always flattering to the mythical hero. A hero's status is not diminished by an occasional blemish but rests on a summary view of his heroic exploits.{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=47}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=48}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=71}}\n\nSome of his patrons claimed divine descent, such as [[Diagoras of Rhodes]], but Pindar makes all men akin to gods if they realize their full potential: their innate gifts are divinely bestowed, and even then success still depends on the gods' active favour. In honouring such men, therefore, Pindar was honouring the gods too.{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=66}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=67}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=96}} His statements about life after death were not self-consistent but that was typical for the times. Traditional ambivalence, as expressed by Homer, had been complicated by a growth of religious sects, such as the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] and [[Pythagoreanism]], representing various schemes of rewards and punishments in the next life. However, for the poet, glory and lasting fame were men's greatest assurance of a life well-lived.{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=89-96}} He presents no theory of history apart from the view that Fortune is variable even for the best men, an outlook suited to moderation in success, courage in adversity. Notions of 'good' and 'bad' in human nature were not analysed by him in any depth nor did he arrive at anything like the [[Simonides of Ceos#Ethics|compassionate ethics]] of his near contemporary, Simonides of Ceos.{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=76}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=77}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=120}} His poems are indifferent to the ordinary mass of people. They are dismissed with phrases such as \"the brute multitude\" (''Pythian Ode'' 2.87). Nor are the poems concerned with the fate of rich and powerful men once they lose their wealth and social status (compared for example with the bitter and disillusioned poems of [[Theognis of Megara]]). They are more interested in what successful men do with their good fortune: success brings obligations, and religious and artistic activities need patrons.{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=100}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=101}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=102}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=103}}\n\nWhereas the [[Muses]] inspired Homer with relevant information and with the language to express it, Pindar seems to receive only their inspiration: his role is to shape that inspiration with his own wisdom and skill. Like his patrons, whom he immortalizes in verse, he owes his success to hard work as well as to innate gifts; though he hires himself out, he has a vocation. The Muses are to him as an oracle is to a prophet, and lesser poets are to him as ravens are to an eagle; the art of such men is as hackneyed as garland-making; his is magical:{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=4}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=5}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=6}}{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=7}}\n{|style=\"border: 0px; margin-left:100px; white-space:nowrap;\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"400px\" |\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"400px\" |\n|- border=\"0\"\n|- Valign=top\n|\n{{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f34\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c6\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bb\u03b1\u03c6\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd: \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf: \u039c\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c3\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 <br>\n\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u1fb7 \u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u1f78\u03bd \u1f14\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5 \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd \u1f10\u03bb\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u1fbd \u1f01\u03bc\u1fb7 <br>\n\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c6\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c3\u1fbd \u1f10\u03ad\u03c1\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2.}}\n|\nTo plait garlands is easy.

The establishment of these athletic and musical festivals was among the greatest achievements of the Greek aristocracies. Even in the 5th century BC, when there was an increased tendency towards professionalism, they were predominantly aristocratic assemblies, reflecting the expense and leisure needed to attend such events either as a competitor or spectator. Attendance was an opportunity for display and self-promotion, and the prestige of victory, requiring commitment in time and/or wealth, went far beyond anything that accrues to athletic victories today, even in spite of the modern preoccupation with sport.<ref>Antony Andrewes, ''Greek Society'', Pelican Books (1971), pp. 219\u201322</ref> Pindar's odes capture something of the prestige and the aristocratic grandeur of the moment of victory, as in this stanza from one of his Isthmian Odes, here translated by Geoffrey S. Conway:\n\n:::::If ever a man strives\n:::With all his soul's endeavour, sparing himself\n:::Neither expense nor labour to attain\n:::True excellence, then must we give to those\n:::Who have achieved the goal, a proud tribute\n:::::Of lordly praise, and shun\n::::All thoughts of envious jealousy.\n:::To a poet's mind the gift is slight, to speak\n:::A kind word for unnumbered toils, and build\n:::For all to share a monument of beauty.

This reflects the fact that most of the odes were composed in honour of boys, youths, and men who had recently enjoyed victories in athletic (and sometimes musical) contests at those festivals. In a few odes however much older victories, and even victories in lesser games, are celebrated, often as a pretext for addressing other issues or achievements. For example, ''Pythian 3'', composed in honour of Hieron of Syracuse, briefly mentions a victory he had once enjoyed at the Pythian Games, but it is actually intended to console him for his chronic illness (similarly, ''Pythian'' 2 is like a private letter in its intimacy).<ref name=Conway72-88-96>Pindar (1972), p. 88. 96</ref> ''Nemean 9'' and ''Nemean 10'' celebrate victories in games at [[Sicyon]] and [[Argos]], and ''Nemean 11'' celebrates a victory in a municipal election on [[Ancient Tenedos|Tenedos]] (though it also mentions some obscure athletic victories). These three odes are the final odes in the ''Nemean'' book of odes, and there is a reason for their inclusion. In the original manuscripts, the four books of odes were arranged in the order of importance assigned to the festivals, with the Nemean festival, considered least important, coming last. Victory odes that lacked a Panhellenic subject were then bundled together at the end of the book of ''Nemean'' odes.<ref name=Conway72-xx>Pindar (1972) Introduction p. xx</ref>\n\n====Style====\nPindar's poetic style is very distinctive, even when the peculiarities of the genre are set aside.

Archilochus was an [[Iambus (genre)|iambic]] poet, working within a genre that licensed abusive and scurrilous verse{{spaced ndash}}a regrettable tendency from the viewpoint of Pindar, whose own persona is intensely earnest, preaching to Hieron the need for moderation (wealth with wisdom) and submission to the divine will. The reference to the embittered poet appears to be Pindar's meditative response to some intrigues at Hieron's court, possibly by his rivals, condemned elsewhere as ''a pair of ravens'' (''Olympian 2''). The intensity of the stanza suggests that it is the culmination and climax of the poem. In fact, the stanza occupies the middle of ''Pythian 2'' and the intensity is sustained throughout the poem from beginning to end. It is the sustained intensity of his poetry that Quintilian refers to above as a ''rolling flood of eloquence'' and Horace below refers to as the ''uncontrollable momentum'' of a river that has burst its banks. [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]] likens him to ''a vast fire''<ref>''De Subl.'' 33.5</ref> and [[Athenaeus]] refers to him as ''the great-voiced Pindar''.<ref>Athenaeus 13.5.64c</ref>\n\nPindar's treatment of myth is another unique aspect of his style, often involving variations on the traditional stories,<ref>Bowie, pp. 107\u20138</ref> since his original audience was familiar with the myths and this allowed him to concentrate on unique and surprising effects. Reversing the chronological order was one such effect, as in ''Olympian VII'' dedicated to Diagoras of Rhodes, but this could also resemble a circular pattern, beginning with a culminating event, followed by scenes leading up to it, and ending with its restatement, as in his account of the [[Dioscuri]] in ''Nemean 10''.{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=310}} Myths enabled him to develop the themes and lessons that pre-occupy him{{spaced ndash}}in particular mankind's exulted relation with the gods via heroic ancestors and, in contrast, the limitations and uncertainties of human existence{{spaced ndash}}but sometimes the traditional stories were an embarrassment and were carefully edited, as for example:\n\"Be still my tongue: here profits not / to tell the whole truth with clear face unveiled,\" (''Nemean 5'', epode 1); \"Away, away this story! / Let no such tale fall from my lips! / For to insult the gods is a fool's wisdom,\" (''Olympian 9'', strophe 2); \"Senseless, I hold it, for a man to say / the gods eat mortal flesh. / I spurn the thought,\" (''Olympian 1'', epode 2).<ref>Pindar (1972) pp. 192, 54, 4, respectively</ref> His mythical accounts are edited for dramatic and graphic effects, usually unfolding through a few grand gestures against a background of large, often symbolic elements such as sea, sky, darkness, fire or mountain.<ref name=\"Charles Segal 1985 page 232\"/>\n\n====Structure====\nPindar's odes typically begin with an invocation to a god or the Muses, followed by praise of the victor and often of his family, ancestors and home-town. Then follows a narrated myth, usually occupying the central and longest section of the poem, which exemplify a moral, while aligning the poet and his audience with the world of gods and heroes.<ref>Bowie, p. 108</ref> The ode usually ends in more eulogies, for example of trainers (if the victor is a boy), and of relatives who have won past events, as well as with prayers or expressions of hope for future success.<ref name=\"Geoffrey S. Conway 1972\">Pindar (1972)</ref> The event where the victory was gained is never described in detail, but there is often some mention of the hard work needed to bring the victory about.\n\nA lot of modern criticism tries to find hidden structure or some unifying principle within the odes. 19th century criticism favoured 'gnomic unity' i.e. that each ode is bound together by the kind of moralizing or philosophic vision typical of archaic [[Gnomic poetry]]. Later critics sought unity in the way certain words or images are repeated and developed within a particular ode. For others, the odes are just celebrations of men and their communities, in which the elements such as myths, piety, and ethics are stock themes that the poet introduces without much real thought. Some conclude that the requirement for unity is too modern to have informed Pindar's ancient approach to a traditional craft.<ref name=\"Douglas E. Gerber 1997 page 255\"/>\n\nThe great majority of the odes are triadic in structure{{spaced ndash}}i.e., stanzas are grouped together in three's as a lyrical unit. Each triad comprises two stanzas identical in length and meter (called 'strophe' and 'antistrophe') and a third stanza (called an 'epode'), differing in length and meter but rounding off the lyrical movement in some way. The shortest odes comprise a single triad, the largest (''Pythian 4'') comprises thirteen triads. Seven of the odes however are monostrophic (i.e., each stanza in the ode is identical in length and meter). The monostrophic odes seem to have been composed for victory marches or processions, whereas the triadic odes appear suited to choral dances.<ref name=\"Geoffrey S. Conway 1972\"/> Pindar's metrical rhythms are nothing like the simple, repetitive rhythms familiar to readers of English verse{{spaced ndash}}typically the rhythm of any given line recurs infrequently (for example, only once every ten, fifteen or twenty lines). This adds to the aura of complexity that surrounds Pindar's work. In terms of meter, the odes fall roughly into two categories{{spaced ndash}}about half are in [[dactylo-epitrite]]s (a meter found for example in the works of [[Stesichorus]], Simonides and Bacchylides) and the other half are in [[Aeolic verse#Choral Aeolics|Aeolic metres]] based on iambs and choriambs.<ref name=\"Douglas E. Gerber 1997 page 255\"/>\n\n====Chronological order====\nModern editors (e.g., Snell and Maehler in their [[Teubner]] edition), have assigned dates, securely or tentatively, to Pindar's victory odes, based on ancient sources and other grounds. The date of an athletic victory is not always the date of composition but often serves merely as a ''terminus post quem''. Many dates are based on comments by ancient sources who had access to published lists of victors, such as the Olympic list compiled by [[Hippias of Elis]], and lists of Pythian victors made by [[Aristotle]] and [[Callisthenes]]. There were however no such lists for the Isthmian and Nemean Games<ref>Currie, p. 25</ref>{{spaced ndash}}[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (6.13.8) complained that the Corinthians and Argives never kept proper records. The resulting uncertainty is reflected in the chronology below, with question marks clustered around Nemean and Isthmian entries, and yet it still represents a fairly clear general timeline of Pindar's career as an epinician poet. The code '''M''' denotes monostrophic odes (odes in which all stanzas are metrically identical) and the rest are triadic (i.e. featuring strophes, antistrophes, epodes):\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Estimated chronological order\n!

Some are only preserved as fragments via quotes by ancient sources and papyri unearthed by archeologists, as at [[Oxyrhynchus]]{{spaced ndash}}in fact the extant works of most of the other [[Nine lyric poets|canonic lyric poets]] have survived only in this tattered form. Pindar's extant verses are unique in that the bulk of them{{spaced ndash}}the victory odes{{spaced ndash}}have been preserved in a manuscript tradition, i.e., generations of scribes copying from earlier copies, possibly originating in a single archetypal copy and sometimes graphically demonstrated by modern scholars in the form of a [[Stemmatics|stemma codicum]], resembling a 'family tree'. Pindar's victory odes are preserved in just two manuscripts, but incomplete collections are located in many others, and all date from the mediaeval period. Some scholars have traced a stemma through these manuscripts, for example [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]], who inferred from them the existence of a common source or archetype dated no earlier than the 2nd century AD, while others, such as [[C.M. Bowra]], have argued that there are too many discrepancies between manuscripts to identify a specific lineage, even while accepting the existence of an archetype. Otto Schroeder identified two families of manuscripts but, following on the work of Polish-born classicist, Alexander Turyn,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Alexander Turyn|journal=Gnomon|volume=54|year=1982|pages=97\u201398|jstor=27688007|author=Miroslav Marcovich|issue=1}}</ref> Bowra rejected this also.<ref>Bowra, Praefatio iii\u2013iv, vii</ref> Different scholars interpret the extant manuscripts differently. Bowra for example singled out seven manuscripts as his primary sources (see below), all featuring errors and/or gaps due to loss of folios and careless copying, and one arguably characterized by the dubious interpolations of Byzantine scholars. These he cross-referenced and then supplemented or verified by reference to other, still more doubtful manuscripts, and some papyrus fragments{{spaced ndash}}a combination of sources on which he based his own edition of the odes and fragments. His general method of selection he defined as follows:\n{{Quote|Where all the codices agree, there perhaps the true reading shines out. Where however they differ, the preferred reading is that which best fits the sense, meter, [[scholia]] and grammatic conventions. Wherever moreover two or more readings of equal weight are found in the codices, I have chosen that which smacks most of Pindar. Yet this difficulty rarely occurs, and in many places the true reading will be found if you examine and compare the language of the codices with that of other Greek poets and especially of Pindar himself.<ref>Bowra, Praefatio iv</ref>}}\n::::'''Selected manuscripts{{spaced ndash}}a sample of preferred sources (Bowra's choice, 1947)'''\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Code\n!

His masterpiece ''Aetia'' included an elegy in honour of Queen [[Berenice]], celebrating a chariot victory at the Nemean Games, composed in a style and presented in a manner that recall Pindar.<ref>A.W. Bulloch, 'Hellenistic Poetry', in Easterling, pp. 556\u201357</ref>\n* The Hellenistic epic ''[[Argonautica]]'', by [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius Rhodius]], was influenced by some aspects of Pindar's style and his use of episodic vignettes in narrative. The epic concerns the adventures of [[Jason]], also touched on by Pindar in ''Pythian'' 4, and both poems link the myth to a Greek audience in Africa.<ref>William H. Race, ''Apollonius Rhodius: Argonautica'', Loeb Classical Library (2008), page xiii</ref>\n* There seems to have been a vogue for Pindaric-style lyrics following the 'publication' of Horace's ''Odes'' 1\u20133{{spaced ndash}}Horace had mastered other styles such as Sapphic and Alcaeic, which had discouraged his contemporaries from attempting anything in the same form, but he had not composed anything in triadic stanzas in the manner of Pindar.<ref>R. Tarrant, 'Ancient receptions of Horace', in ''The Cambridge Companion to Horace'', Stephen Harrison (ed.), Cambridge university Press (2007), page 280</ref>\n* Pindar was much read, quoted, and copied during the [[Byzantine Era]]. For example, [[Christophoros Mytilenaios]] of the 11th century parodied a chariot race in his sixth poem employing explicit allusions to Pindar.<ref>F. Lauritzen, Readers of Pindar and students of Mitylinaios, ''Byzantion '' 2010</ref>\n* During the 17th and 18th centuries, literary theorists in Europe distinguished between two types of lyric poetry, loosely associated with Horace and Pindar. Regular verses in four line stanzas were associated with Horace's Odes, which did in fact inspire and influence poets of the period. Irregular verses in longer stanzas were termed [[Pindarics]] though the association with Pindar was largely fanciful. [[Abraham Cowley]] was considered the main exponent of English Pindarics. In fact, the two styles were not always easy to distinguish and many 'Pindaric' odes were quite Horatian in content, as in some poems by [[Thomas Gray]].<ref>David Money, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oQ5Ep2tR8R8C&pg=PA327 'The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries'], in ''The Cambridge Companion to Horace'', Stephen Harrison (ed), Cambridge University Press (2007), pp. 327\u201328 {{ISBN|0-521-83002-8}}</ref>\n* A 'Pindaric Ode' was composed for the revived 1896 Olympic Games in Athens by the Oxford scholar George Stuart Robinson, and similar compositions were commissioned from and composed by classicist [[Armand D'Angour]] for the Athens Olympics in 2004 and the London Olympics in 2012.\n\n===Horace's tribute===\nThe Latin poet, [[Horace|Quintus Horatius Flaccus]], was an admirer of Pindar's style. He described it in one of his [[Sappho|Sapphic]] poems, addressed to a friend, [[Iullus Antonius]]:\n{|style=\"border: 0px; margin-left:100px; white-space:nowrap;\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"400px\" |\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"400px\" |\n|- border=\"0\"\n|- Valign=top\n|\nPindarum quisquis studet aemulari,<br>\nIule, ceratis ope Daedalea<br>\nnititur pennis vitreo daturus<br>\nnomina ponto.<br>\n<br>\nmonte decurrens velut amnis, imbres<br>\nquem super notas aluere ripas,<br>\nfervet immensusque ruit profundo<br>\nPindarus ore.

M. Bowra]], the leading Pindaric scholar of his generation, and the editor of the 1935 [[Oxford University Press|O.U.P]] edition of his poems, summarized Pindar's qualities in the following words:\n{{quote|\"His innate, unquestioning pride in his poetical mission means that he gives to it all his gifts and all his efforts. The result is a poetry that by any standards deserves the name because it is based on a radiant vision of reality and fashioned with so subtle, so adventurous, and so dedicated an art that it is worthy to be an earthly counterpart of the songs which Pindar regards as the archetype of music on those lofty occasions when all discords are resolved and all misgivings obliterated by the power of the life-giving word.\"{{sfn|Bowra|1964|p=401}}}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pindarics]]\n* [[John Wolcot]]\n* [[Pindar's First Olympian Ode]]\n* [[Pindar's First Pythian Ode]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"nb\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bowie, Ewen, 'Lyric and Elegiac Poetry' in ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'', J.

Lalo attaches the bell to Hector's wheelchair, enabling him to communicate more effectively with his right index finger, the only body part Hector can move after he emerges from his coma.

After Mike and Gus leave, Lalo enters the store and attempts to learn what Mike knows, but the clerk, Fred, refuses to tell him.

Gus claims Werner was constructing a chilling system under Mike's supervision at the Los Pollos Hermanos farm, stole cocaine, fled, and was killed, after which Gus attempted to cover up the loss by replacing the missing cocaine with local, inferior meth. The cover story explains events of which Lalo was aware, and he accepts Gus's explanation and apology, but remains suspicious. Juan privately warns Lalo that [[Don Eladio Vuente]] and the cartel trust Gus, or at least consider him a valuable earner, so Lalo should consider the matter closed. Lalo later receives confirmation from Hector that Gus enjoys cartel protection as long as he remains a top earner. Because of Lalo's suspicions, Gus shuts down work on his underground meth lab and Mike sends Werner's men home, paid in full for the half-completed job and warned to remain silent.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Magic Man |episode-link=Magic Man (Better Call Saul) |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |date=February 23, 2020 |season=5 |number=1}}</ref>\n\nGus demands that Nacho find a way to gain Lalo's trust and start passing inside information about the Salamancas.

Wings are dark grey with varying levels of yellow highlighting. The ventral feathering is light grey to white with light grey scalloping on the chest. The feathering surrounding the eye is black. The beak and bare skin patch around the eyes are bright yellow, and the iris is brown. Legs are also yellow, though shade and brightness varies. Fledgling birds have undefined, fluffy light grey chests without scalloping. Immature birds can be identified in the hand by retained juvenile remiges and rectrices, which are more brownish.<ref name=\"BirdInTheHand\" /> Yellow-throated miners are distinctive from the other miners by their clean white rump, instead of the continuous grey from the back that the noisy and black-eared miners have. The white-rump is clearly visible as yellow-throated miners are flying away, so this feature is often used in the field where two miner species overlap.  Yellow-throated miners have a varying amount of yellow highlighting above and below the beak on the forehead and chin, as well as on the sides of the throat. This differs from noisy miners which have white above the beak and no yellow highlighting on the  forehead or neck, but can have a small amount of yellow on the chin. Yellow-throated miners have paler feathering on the lower jaw compared to the throat, while pure black-eared miners have darker feathering on the lower jaw compared to that of the throat.
