Eusebius then continues to describe the [[Labarum]],<ref>Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 1.31, p. 946.</ref> the military standard used by Constantine in his later wars against Licinius, showing the Chi-Rho sign. The accounts by Lactantius and Eusebius, though not entirely consistent, have been connected to the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] (312 AD), having merged into a popular notion of Constantine seeing the Chi-Rho sign on the evening before the battle [[Protestantism]] and [[Paganism]].\n\nThe phrase appears prominently placed as a motto on a ribbon unfurled with a passion cross to its left, beneath a window over the [[Scala Regia (Vatican)|Scala Regia]], adjacent to the equestrian statue of Emperor Constantine, in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. Emperors and other monarchs, having paid respects to the Pope, descended the Scala Regia, and would observe the light shining down through the window, with the motto, reminiscent of Constantine's vision, and be reminded to follow the Cross. They would thence turn right into the atrium of [[St. Peter's Basilica]], ostensibly so inspired and [[San Nicholas]].\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Portugal]] has used this motto since 1143, according with the legend in [[Lus\u00edadas]].\n\n==Cultural references==\n<!-- DO NOT ADD UNSOURCED LISTINGS TO THIS SECTION, THEY WILL BE DELETED -->\n\n===Military===\n* Coat of Arms of the Russian Government. 1919 ([[Old Church Slavonic]] \"\u0421\u0438\u0301\u043c\u044a \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0463\u0434\u0438\u0301\u0448\u0438\", [[Russian language|Russian]] \"\u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0439\"), see [[White movement]]\n* Inscribed on the [[Colours, standards and guidons|Colours]] of the [[Irish Brigade (France)|Irish Brigade]].\n* Inscribed on the banner and the motto of the [[4th Guards Brigade (Croatia)|4th Guards Brigade]] (now 2nd Motorized Battalion \"Pauci\" - the Spiders) of the [[Croatian Army|Croatian army]]\n* Inscribed on the banner of the [[Sanfedismo]] in 1799<ref>Chadwick, Owen. 1981.

Eusebius then continues to describe the [[Labarum]],<ref>Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 1.31, p. 946.</ref> the military standard used by Constantine in his later wars against Licinius, showing the Chi-Rho sign. The accounts by Lactantius and Eusebius, though not entirely consistent, have been connected to the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] (312 AD), having merged into a popular notion of Constantine seeing the Chi-Rho sign on the evening before the battle.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe phrase appears prominently placed as a motto on a ribbon unfurled with a passion cross to its left, beneath a window over the [[Scala Regia (Vatican)|Scala Regia]], adjacent to the equestrian statue of Emperor Constantine, in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. Emperors and other monarchs, having paid respects to the Pope, descended the Scala Regia, and would observe the light shining down through the window, with the motto, reminiscent of Constantine's vision, and be reminded to follow the Cross.

In 2000, she moved to [[Vienna]] to start a career as a free visual artist. In the years that followed she primarily worked in [[Berlin]]. Since 2011, Hana Usui has lived and worked in Vienna (Austria) and Bolzano-Bozen (Italy). Her [[drawing]]s are made of black or white oil paint, which she carves into paper with a screwdriver and often embeds into ink washes.<ref>[http://www.hana-usui.net/mediapool/24/241994/data/Usui_Cat_2012.pdf \"Hana Usui. Drawings 2006-2012\"], Retrieved on 2014 January 14.</ref>\n\n\"The works of the Japanese artist Hana Usui, who was born in Tokyo in 1974, are, however restrained, of great complexity. This is true of the relationship of oil drawing and ink painting (or photography), of the combination of drawing and painting techniques, of linear conciseness and spaciousness. The resulting richness of levels of expression also characterises the critical works that have dominated in recent years. Those on the history of her own country, on Fukushima or Hiroshima, give the subject a new dimension by avoiding anything striking or the purely documentary and are never to be seen as a political manifesto. Thanks to this distancing and mere suggestion and the symbolic in the artistic media, they gain, one might say, in quiet intensity and at the same time remain open to questions. In this way, freed of their historical context, warning and appeal demonstrate their enduring validity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_kuenstler/index.html|title=Quote from the newsletter of the Dittmar Gallery on April 9, 2020 |website=www.galerie-dittmar.at|accessdate=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n== Selected Solo Exhibitions==\n* 2019 Vienna Art Week: ''Bei Uns'' (Around Here), WOP - Works on Paper, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://esel.at/termin/103368/hana-usui-bei-uns|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.esel.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wopwien.com/wop/hana-usui\n|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.wopwien.com|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.viennaartweek.at/de/program/\n|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.viennaartweek.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2018 ''An das Leben'' (To Life), Artcurial Austria, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://esel.at/termin/98220|title=An das Leben - Artcurial|website=www.esel.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kekinwien.at/kunst/09/2018/hana-usui-an-das-leben/|title=An das Leben - Artcurial|website=www.kekinwien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2018 ''Black End'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Black End - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/101412;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Black End - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2016 ''High & Slow'', with Thilo Westermann, Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kunsthaus-kaufbeuren.de/ausstellungen/high-slow/|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.kunsthaus-kaufbeuren.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/ausstellung-kuenste-der-verfeinerung-1.3192064|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.sueddeutsche.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/101413;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Schwarzer Regen'' (Black Rain), Bildraum 01, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bildrecht.at/bildraum/bildraum-01/hana-usui-schwarzer-regen/|title=Schwarzer Regen - Bildraum 01|website=www.bildrecht.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/90838;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Schwarzer Regen - Bildraum 01|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Hana Usui - Works on Paper'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Works on Paper - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.taz.de/!5236630/ |title=Works on Paper - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.taz.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Hana Usui - Works on Paper'', Galerie Daniela and Cora H\u00f6lzl - EY5, D\u00fcsseldorf / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-cora-hoelzl.de/current%20exhibition.htm|title=Works on Paper - Galerie Cora H\u00f6lzl|website=www.galerie-cora-hoelzl.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2013 '' Hana Usui - Drawings'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Drawings - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/86712;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Drawings - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2012 Vienna Art Week: ''Hana Usui.

In 2000, she moved to [[Vienna]] to start a career as a free visual artist. In the years that followed she primarily worked in [[Berlin]]. Since 2011, Hana Usui has lived and worked in Vienna (Austria) and Bolzano-Bozen (Italy). Her [[drawing]]s are made of black or white oil paint, which she carves into paper with a screwdriver and often embeds into ink washes.<ref>[http://www.hana-usui.net/mediapool/24/241994/data/Usui_Cat_2012.pdf \"Hana Usui. Drawings 2006-2012\"], Retrieved on 2014 January 14.</ref>\n\n\"The works of the Japanese artist Hana Usui, who was born in Tokyo in 1974, are, however restrained, of great complexity. This is true of the relationship of oil drawing and ink painting (or photography), of the combination of drawing and painting techniques, of linear conciseness and spaciousness. The resulting richness of levels of expression also characterises the critical works that have dominated in recent years. Those on the history of her own country, on Fukushima or Hiroshima, give the subject a new dimension by avoiding anything striking or the purely documentary and are never to be seen as a political manifesto. Thanks to this distancing and mere suggestion and the symbolic in the artistic media, they gain, one might say, in quiet intensity and at the same time remain open to questions. In this way, freed of their historical context, warning and appeal demonstrate their enduring validity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_kuenstler/index.html|title=Quote from the newsletter of the Dittmar Gallery on April 9, 2020 |website=www.galerie-dittmar.at|accessdate=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n== Selected Solo Exhibitions==\n* 2019 Vienna Art Week: ''Bei Uns'' (Around Here), WOP - Works on Paper, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://esel.at/termin/103368/hana-usui-bei-uns|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.esel.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wopwien.com/wop/hana-usui\n|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.wopwien.com|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.viennaartweek.at/de/program/\n|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.viennaartweek.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2018 ''An das Leben'' (To Life), Artcurial Austria, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://esel.at/termin/98220|title=An das Leben - Artcurial|website=www.esel.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kekinwien.at/kunst/09/2018/hana-usui-an-das-leben/|title=An das Leben - Artcurial|website=www.kekinwien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2018 ''Black End'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Black End - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/101412;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Black End - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2016 ''High & Slow'', with Thilo Westermann, Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kunsthaus-kaufbeuren.de/ausstellungen/high-slow/|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.kunsthaus-kaufbeuren.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/ausstellung-kuenste-der-verfeinerung-1.3192064|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.sueddeutsche.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/101413;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Schwarzer Regen'' (Black Rain), Bildraum 01, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bildrecht.at/bildraum/bildraum-01/hana-usui-schwarzer-regen/|title=Schwarzer Regen - Bildraum 01|website=www.bildrecht.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/90838;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Schwarzer Regen - Bildraum 01|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Hana Usui - Works on Paper'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Works on Paper - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.taz.de/!5236630/ |title=Works on Paper - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.taz.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Hana Usui - Works on Paper'', Galerie Daniela and Cora H\u00f6lzl - EY5, D\u00fcsseldorf / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-cora-hoelzl.de/current%20exhibition.htm|title=Works on Paper - Galerie Cora H\u00f6lzl|website=www.galerie-cora-hoelzl.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2013 '' Hana Usui - Drawings'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Drawings - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/86712;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Drawings - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2012 Vienna Art Week: ''Hana Usui.

On the west lies [[West Englewood, Chicago|West Englewood]], which is generally lumped in with Englewood by Chicagoans. It is located on the [[South Side, Chicago|south side of Chicago]].\n\n==History==\nBefore 1850, Englewood was an oak forest with much swampland. In 1852 several railroad lines crossed at what became known as Junction Grove, stimulating the beginning of what we know today as Englewood. The [[Union Stock Yard]] provided employment to early residents. In 1868 Henry B. Lewis, a wool merchant in the Loop and Board of Education member, suggested a new name from his association with [[Englewood, New Jersey]]. In 1865 Junction Grove was annexed to the Town of Lake and to Chicago in 1889.<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/426.html</ref> The [[World's Columbian Exposition]] at nearby [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]] in 1893 led to real estate speculation and expansion of the community.<ref>Larsen, Erik, ''[[The Devil in the White City]]: A Saga of Magic and Murder at the Fair that Changed America'', Doubleday Publishing Group, 2004, {{isbn|9781400076314}}</ref>\n\nThe Englewood community<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagoreporter.com/index.php/c/Sidebars/d/A_Brief_History_of_Englewood |title=Brief History of Englewood |publisher=chicagoreporter.com |date=July 12, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531172656/http://www.chicagoreporter.com/index.php/c/Sidebars/d/A_Brief_History_of_Englewood |archivedate=May 31, 2009 }}</ref> was largely defined by the Englewood Shopping Center at 63rd & Halsted, a large pedestrian mall. The City, social services, and mall management worked with community leaders and groups to integrate the mall with the community. The goal was to make the mall a vital part of the community, and a central part of everyday life. It was the site of numerous community events, parades, outdoor concerts, live radio broadcasts and the like. This was spearheaded by the Englewood Business Men's Association and its director, Richard Drew. Mr. Drew died in 1978, and with his passing the Association lost its community focus. The Center subsequently lost its major anchor tenants, including [[Sears Roebuck]], and became a collection of smaller merchants.\n\nIn 1999, Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]] announced a $256&nbsp;million revitalization plan for the area. The keystone of the program is the relocation of [[Kennedy-King College]] to the former site of the Englewood Shopping Center. Shortly thereafter the city began an aggressive buyout and relocation program for mall merchants. The campus includes the Washburne Culinary Institute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kennedyking.ccc.edu/washburne/home.asp |title=Washburne Culinary Institute Homepage |accessdate=January 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112003054/http://kennedyking.ccc.edu/washburne/home.asp |archivedate=January 12, 2010 }}</ref> Groundbreaking for the new, {{convert|40|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus occurred on November 9, 2005, and it opened in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mayor Daley, Community Leaders Break Ground For New Kennedy-King College Campus |url=http://www.pbcchicago.com/content/about/press_detail.asp?pID=184 |publisher=Public Building Commission of Chicago |accessdate=October 6, 2013 |date=November 9, 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027060328/http://www.pbcchicago.com/content/about/press_detail.asp?pID=184 |archivedate=October 27, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=New Kennedy-King College |url=http://www.pbcchicago.com/content/projects/project_detail.asp?pID=JC-13 |publisher=Public Building Commission of Chicago |accessdate=October 6, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605165423/http://www.pbcchicago.com/content/projects/project_detail.asp?pID=JC-13 |archivedate=June 5, 2013 }} \"Mayor Daley cut the ribbon to open Kennedy King College on July 18, 2007.\"</ref>\n\nDigital images of Englewood can be found in Explore Chicago Collections, a digital repository made available by [[Chicago Collections]] archives, libraries and other cultural institutions in the city.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Long|first1=Elizabeth|title=A Single Portal to Chicago's History|url=http://news.lib.uchicago.edu/blog/2015/10/21/a-single-portal-to-chicago-history/|publisher=The University of Chicago News|accessdate=September 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nEnglewood is also known as Chicago's murder capital, with more homicides being committed there than in any other neighborhood in the city.

It is located on the [[South Side, Chicago|south side of Chicago]].\n\n==History==\nBefore 1850, Englewood was an oak forest with much swampland. In 1852 several railroad lines crossed at what became known as Junction Grove, stimulating the beginning of what we know today as Englewood. The [[Union Stock Yard]] provided employment to early residents. In 1868 Henry B. Lewis, a wool merchant in the Loop and Board of Education member, suggested a new name from his association with [[Englewood, New Jersey]]. In 1865 Junction Grove was annexed to the Town of Lake and to Chicago in 1889.<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/426.html</ref> The [[World's Columbian Exposition]] at nearby [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]] in 1893 led to real estate speculation and expansion of the community.<ref>Larsen, Erik, ''[[The Devil in the White City]]: A Saga of Magic and Murder at the Fair that Changed America'', Doubleday Publishing Group, 2004, {{isbn|9781400076314}}</ref>\n\nThe Englewood community<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagoreporter.com/index.php/c/Sidebars/d/A_Brief_History_of_Englewood |title=Brief History of Englewood |publisher=chicagoreporter.com |date=July 12, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531172656/http://www.chicagoreporter.com/index.php/c/Sidebars/d/A_Brief_History_of_Englewood |archivedate=May 31, 2009 }}</ref> was largely defined by the Englewood Shopping Center at 63rd & Halsted, a large pedestrian mall. The City, social services, and mall management worked with community leaders and groups to integrate the mall with the community. The goal was to make the mall a vital part of the community, and a central part of everyday life. It was the site of numerous community events, parades, outdoor concerts, live radio broadcasts and the like. This was spearheaded by the Englewood Business Men's Association and its director, Richard Drew. Mr. Drew died in 1978, and with his passing the Association lost its community focus. The Center subsequently lost its major anchor tenants, including [[Sears Roebuck]], and became a collection of smaller merchants.\n\nIn 1999, Mayor [[Richard M.

After working at Le Gavroche for a year, Albert Roux invited Ramsay to work with him at Hotel Diva, a ski resort in the [[French Alps]], as his number two. From there, a 23-year-old Ramsay moved to Paris to work with [[Guy Savoy (chef)|Guy Savoy]] and [[Jo\u00ebl Robuchon]], both [[Michelin star|Michelin-starred]] chefs. In ''Master Chef'' series 3 episode 18, Gordon Ramsay stated that Guy Savoy was his mentor.

Shortly thereafter, Marco Pierre White reentered his life, offering to set him up with a head chef position and 10% share in the Rossmore, owned by White's business partners. The restaurant was renamed [[Aubergine (London restaurant)|Aubergine]] and went on to win its first [[Michelin star]] fourteen months later. In 1997, Aubergine won its second Michelin star. Despite the restaurant's success, a dispute with Ramsay's business owners, who wanted to turn Aubergine into a chain, and Ramsay's dream of running his own restaurant led to his leaving the partnership in July 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/30/style/chefs-walkoutwith-staff-sets-london-abroil.html |last=Today I Found Out|title=From Soccer Hopeful to Worlds Angriest Chef|date=24 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BvaNnfrsSI|title=From Soccer Hopeful to Worlds Angriest Chef|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref> He has described the decision to set out on his own as \"the most important day of my entire cooking career; the most important decision of my life\".<ref>''Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares'' episode \"Rococo\" (2006)</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Ramsay opened his own restaurant in Chelsea, [[Restaurant Gordon Ramsay]], with the help of his father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, and his former colleagues at Aubergine.<ref name=\":1\">{{Citation|last=Today I Found Out|title=From Soccer Hopeful to Worlds Angriest Chef|date=24 October 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BvaNnfrsSI|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref> The restaurant gained its third Michelin star in 2001, making Ramsay the first Scot to achieve that feat.<ref name=\"Chef Trouble\">{{cite news | title=Gordon Ramsay: Chef terrible |work=BBC News World Edition | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1448742.stm |accessdate=1 August 2006 | date=20 July 2001}}</ref> In 2011, ''[[The Good Food Guide]]'' listed Restaurant Gordon Ramsay as the second best in the UK, only bettered by [[The Fat Duck]] in [[Bray, Berkshire]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The Good Food Guide's Top 60 UK Restaurants AnnouNced|url=http://www.thegoodfoodguide.co.uk/news/the-good-food-guides-top-60-uk-restaurants-announced|accessdate=9 May 2011|newspaper=The Good Food Guide}}</ref>\n\nAfter establishing his first restaurant, Ramsay's empire expanded rapidly.

He also eats very little per 'meal', and prefers to graze throughout the day, partly due to the habit he built up as a judge and chef and also because of his busy schedule.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.delish.com/food-news/a47817/gordon-ramsays-workout-routine/|title=Gordon Ramsay's Workout Routine Will Leave You Feeling Winded|date=22 June 2016|work=Delish|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=TheRichest|title=Simple Everyday Things GORDON RAMSAY Enjoys|date=3 July 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Mu82GigVSI|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref> He has a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in [[karate]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://diply.com/secrets-about-gordon-ramsay/3?publisher=dip&config=25|title=12 Shocking Things About Chef Gordon Ramsay|work=Diply|accessdate=30 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331104741/http://diply.com/secrets-about-gordon-ramsay/3?publisher=dip&config=25|archivedate=31 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Family===\nRamsay married [[Tana Ramsay|Cayetana Elizabeth Hutcheson]], a [[Montessori]]-trained schoolteacher, in 1996.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12760170.Tana_Ramsay_interview/| title=Tana Ramsay interview|date=13 December 2008|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]| location = Glasgow|accessdate= 13 June 2016| archivedate=4 August 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160804174718/http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12760170.Tana_Ramsay_interview/ | url-status=live}}</ref> They divide their time between [[Wandsworth Common|Wandsworth Common, London]]<ref name=\"wandsworth\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10865310.Gordon_Ramsay_to_open_new_restaurant_in_Battersea/?|title=Gordon Ramsay to open new restaurant in Battersea|publisher=[[Newsquest]]|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref> and [[Los Angeles]].

These are supplied to those kitchens with limited cooking space such as Foxtrot Oscar and Gordon Ramsay's highly acclaimed pubs, including the Narrow.

Ramsay enrolled at [[Activate Learning|North Oxfordshire Technical College]], sponsored by the [[Rotary International|Rotarians]], to study hotel management.

White discouraged Ramsay from taking a job in Paris, instead encouraging him to work for [[Albert Roux]] at [[Le Gavroche]] in [[Mayfair]], where he met Jean-Claude Breton, now his [[ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel]] at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. After working at Le Gavroche for a year, Albert Roux invited Ramsay to work with him at Hotel Diva, a ski resort in the [[French Alps]], as his number two. From there, a 23-year-old Ramsay moved to Paris to work with [[Guy Savoy (chef)|Guy Savoy]] and [[Jo\u00ebl Robuchon]], both [[Michelin star|Michelin-starred]] chefs. In ''Master Chef'' series 3 episode 18, Gordon Ramsay stated that Guy Savoy was his mentor. He continued his training in France for three years, before giving in to the physical and mental stress of the kitchens and taking a year to work as a personal chef on the private yacht ''Idlewild'', based in [[Bermuda]].<ref name=\"HumblePie\"/> The role on the boat saw him travel to [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]], and learn about Italian cuisine.<ref>{{Citation|last=BabbleTop|title=10 Times Gordon Ramsay was ACTUALLY NICE!|date=30 August 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vF8GvyjMP8|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Head chef==\nUpon his return to London in 1993, Ramsay was offered the position of head chef, under chef-patron [[Pierre Koffmann]], at the three-Michelin-starred [[La Tante Claire]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]. Shortly thereafter, Marco Pierre White reentered his life, offering to set him up with a head chef position and 10% share in the Rossmore, owned by White's business partners. The restaurant was renamed [[Aubergine (London restaurant)|Aubergine]] and went on to win its first [[Michelin star]] fourteen months later. In 1997, Aubergine won its second Michelin star. Despite the restaurant's success, a dispute with Ramsay's business owners, who wanted to turn Aubergine into a chain, and Ramsay's dream of running his own restaurant led to his leaving the partnership in July 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/30/style/chefs-walkoutwith-staff-sets-london-abroil.html |last=Today I Found Out|title=From Soccer Hopeful to Worlds Angriest Chef|date=24 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BvaNnfrsSI|title=From Soccer Hopeful to Worlds Angriest Chef|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref> He has described the decision to set out on his own as \"the most important day of my entire cooking career; the most important decision of my life\".<ref>''Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares'' episode \"Rococo\" (2006)</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Ramsay opened his own restaurant in Chelsea, [[Restaurant Gordon Ramsay]], with the help of his father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, and his former colleagues at Aubergine.<ref name=\":1\">{{Citation|last=Today I Found Out|title=From Soccer Hopeful to Worlds Angriest Chef|date=24 October 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BvaNnfrsSI|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref> The restaurant gained its third Michelin star in 2001, making Ramsay the first Scot to achieve that feat.<ref name=\"Chef Trouble\">{{cite news | title=Gordon Ramsay: Chef terrible |work=BBC News World Edition | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1448742.stm |accessdate=1 August 2006 | date=20 July 2001}}</ref> In 2011, ''[[The Good Food Guide]]'' listed Restaurant Gordon Ramsay as the second best in the UK, only bettered by [[The Fat Duck]] in [[Bray, Berkshire]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The Good Food Guide's Top 60 UK Restaurants AnnouNced|url=http://www.thegoodfoodguide.co.uk/news/the-good-food-guides-top-60-uk-restaurants-announced|accessdate=9 May 2011|newspaper=The Good Food Guide}}</ref>\n\nAfter establishing his first restaurant, Ramsay's empire expanded rapidly.
