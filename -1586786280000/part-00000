It was released in February 2001, as the first [[Single (Music)|single]] from their album ''[[Mutter (album)|Mutter]]''. According to [[Till Lindemann]], the song was originally written as an entrance song for the boxer [[Vitali Klitschko]], whose surname was also the working title of the song.<ref>[http://herzeleid.com/en/press/2000-09_hammer Rammstein Press: Maternity Leave] | Herzeleid.com | The number one source for Rammstein</ref>\n\nThe music video for the band's 2019 single \"[[Deutschland (song)|Deutschland]]\" features a piano-based version of \"Sonne\" in the ending credits.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeQM1c-XCDc |title=Rammstein - Deutschland (Official Video) |date=28 Mar 2019 |accessdate=1 Apr 2019 <!--this is Rammstein's official video page so it meets the WP referencing requirements -->}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe video features the band as [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]] mining gold for [[Snow White]]. Apparently, this came about while all of the band members were watching the old [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]'', and had \"Sonne\" playing in the background, giving them the idea for the video. Also, as told by [[Paul Landers]] in the ''Making of Sonne'', it came out of a video [[Oliver Riedel]] did mixing the \"Sonne\" song and parts of the ''[[Snow White]]'' film with his computer. The band supposedly went through nearly 40 different ideas for the video, such as the story of a [[Boxing|boxer]], before choosing the Snow White theme. One of the other ideas was a video about the dropping of the [[atomic bomb]] on [[Hiroshima]] (which would have matched the lyrics and the depressed-sounding vocalization). [[Snow White|Lady Snow-White]] (German: \"''Schneewittchen''\") is played by the [[Russian people|Russian]] soap actress [[Joulia Stepanova]] (Yulia Stepanova). There is also an extended version, which features extra scenes (i.e.: Snow White smoking a cigarette while looking at a gold ring).\n\n==Live performances==\n[[File:Heino with Rammstein at Wacken Open Air 2013 02.jpg|thumb|Heino and [[Rammstein]] performing ''Sonne'' at the [[Wacken Open Air]] 2013]]\nIt debuted as \"Klitschko\" on 16 April 2000. The song was very different from the final version released in ''[[Mutter (album)|Mutter]]''. \"Sonne\" was also played in some concerts of the Japanese/Australia-New Zealand leg of the [[Sehnsucht (Rammstein album)|''Sehnsucht'']] tour, before the ''Mutter'' album was released and its respective tour started. These concerts were the only time the third verse of the song was played; when played live, the band usually omits the final stanza, and instead plays a slightly longer intro and outro. Theatrical flames shoot several feet into the air when Rammstein plays the song.

It was released in February 2001, as the first [[Single (Music)|single]] from their album ''[[Mutter (album)|Mutter]]''. According to [[Till Lindemann]], the song was originally written as an entrance song for the boxer [[Vitali Klitschko]], whose surname was also the working title of the song.<ref>[http://herzeleid.com/en/press/2000-09_hammer Rammstein Press: Maternity Leave] | Herzeleid.com | The number one source for Rammstein</ref>\n\nThe music video for the band's 2019 single \"[[Deutschland (song)|Deutschland]]\" features a piano-based version of \"Sonne\" in the ending credits.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeQM1c-XCDc |title=Rammstein - Deutschland (Official Video) |date=28 Mar 2019 |accessdate=1 Apr 2019 <!--this is Rammstein's official video page so it meets the WP referencing requirements -->}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe video features the band as [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]] mining gold for [[Snow White]]. Apparently, this came about while all of the band members were watching the old [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]'', and had \"Sonne\" playing in the background, giving them the idea for the video. Also, as told by [[Paul Landers]] in the ''Making of Sonne'', it came out of a video [[Oliver Riedel]] did mixing the \"Sonne\" song and parts of the ''[[Snow White]]'' film with his computer. The band supposedly went through nearly 40 different ideas for the video, such as the story of a [[Boxing|boxer]], before choosing the Snow White theme. One of the other ideas was a video about the dropping of the [[atomic bomb]] on [[Hiroshima]] (which would have matched the lyrics and the depressed-sounding vocalization). [[Snow White|Lady Snow-White]] (German: \"''Schneewittchen''\") is played by the [[Russian people|Russian]] soap actress [[Joulia Stepanova]] (Yulia Stepanova). There is also an extended version, which features extra scenes (i.e.: Snow White smoking a cigarette while looking at a gold ring).\n\n==Live performances==\n[[File:Heino with Rammstein at Wacken Open Air 2013 02.jpg|thumb|Heino and [[Rammstein]] performing ''Sonne'' at the [[Wacken Open Air]] 2013]]\nIt debuted as \"Klitschko\" on 16 April 2000. The song was very different from the final version released in ''[[Mutter (album)|Mutter]]''. \"Sonne\" was also played in some concerts of the Japanese/Australia-New Zealand leg of the [[Sehnsucht (Rammstein album)|''Sehnsucht'']] tour, before the ''Mutter'' album was released and its respective tour started. These concerts were the only time the third verse of the song was played; when played live, the band usually omits the final stanza, and instead plays a slightly longer intro and outro.

The source terms in the wave equations make the [[partial differential equations]] ''inhomogeneous'', if the source terms are zero the equations reduce to the homogeneous [[electromagnetic wave equation]]s. The equations follow from [[Maxwell's equations]].\n\n== Maxwell's equations ==\n<!---These are here to save the reader having to go back and forth to the Maxwell's equations article--->\n\nFor reference, [[Maxwell's equations]] are summarized below in [[SI units]] and [[Gaussian units]].

The equations imply that EM waves are generated if there are gradients in charge density ''\u03c1'', circulations in current density '''J''', time-varying current density, or any mixture these.\n\nThese forms of the wave equations are not often used in practice, as the source terms are inconveniently complicated.
