In its modern most practiced format, a bar is placed between two standards with a crash mat for landing. In the modern era, athletes run towards the bar and use the [[Fosbury Flop]] method of jumping, leaping head first with their back to the bar. Since ancient times, competitors have introduced increasingly effective techniques to arrive at the current form.\n\nThe discipline is, alongside the [[pole vault]], one of two vertical clearance events to feature on the [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic athletics programme]]. It is contested at the [[World Championships in Athletics]] and [[IAAF World Indoor Championships]], and is a common occurrence at track and field meetings. The high jump was among the first events deemed acceptable for women, having been held at the [[Athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Olympic Games]].\n\n[[Javier Sotomayor]] (Cuba) is the current men's record holder with a jump of {{T&Fcalc|2.45}} set in 1993&nbsp;\u2013 the longest standing record in the history of the men's high jump. [[Stefka Kostadinova]] (Bulgaria) has held the women's world record at {{T&Fcalc|2.09}} since 1987, also the longest-held record in the event.\n[[File:Javier Sotomayor 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Javier Sotomayor]], the only person ever to have cleared 8 feet in the high jump]]\n\n==Rules==\n[[File:Yelena Slesarenko failing 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Yelena Slesarenko]] hitting the bar while using the Fosbury Flop technique.]]\n\nThe rules for the high jump are set internationally by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF). Jumpers must take off on one foot. A jump is considered a failure if the bar is dislodged by the action of the jumper whilst jumping or the jumper touches the ground or breaks the plane of the near edge of the bar before clearance. The technique one uses for the jump must be almost flawless in order to have a chance of clearing a high bar.\n\nCompetitors may begin jumping at any height announced by the chief judge, or may pass, at their own discretion. Most competitions state that three consecutive missed jumps, at any height or combination of heights, will eliminate the jumper from competition.\n\nThe victory goes to the jumper who clears the greatest height during the final. Tie-breakers are used for any place in which scoring occurs. If two or more jumpers tie for one of these places, the tie-breakers are: 1) the fewest misses at the height at which the tie occurred; and 2) the fewest misses throughout the competition.\n\nIf the event remains tied for first place (or a limited advancement position to a subsequent meet), the jumpers have a jump-off, beginning at the next greater height. Each jumper has one attempt. The bar is then alternately lowered and raised until only one jumper succeeds at a given height.<ref name=\"rules\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/05/47/81/20091027115916_httppostedfile_CompRules2010_web_26Oct09_17166.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011023632/http://iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/05/47/81/20091027115916_httppostedfile_CompRules2010_web_26Oct09_17166.pdf |archivedate=October 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }} iaaf rules</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:1912 Konstantinos Tsiklitiras2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Konstantinos Tsiklitiras]] during the standing high jump competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics]]\nThe first recorded high jump event took place in Scotland in the 19th century. Early jumpers used either an elaborate straight-on approach or a [[Scissors jump|scissors]] technique. In later years, soon then after, the bar was approached diagonally, and the jumper threw first the inside leg and then the other over the bar in a scissoring motion. Around the turn of the 20th century, techniques began to change, beginning with the Irish-American [[Michael Sweeney (athlete)|Michael Sweeney's]] ''[[Eastern cut-off]]''. By taking off like the scissors and extending his spine and flattening out over the bar, Sweeney raised the world record to {{T&Fcalc|1.97}} in 1895.\n\nAnother American, [[George Horine]], developed an even more efficient technique, the ''[[Western roll]]''. In this style, the bar again is approached on a diagonal, but the inner leg is used for the take-off, while the outer leg is thrust up to lead the body sideways over the bar. Horine increased the world standard to {{T&Fcalc|2.01}} in 1912. His technique was predominant through the [[Berlin Olympics]] of 1936, in which the event was won by [[Cornelius Johnson (athlete)|Cornelius Johnson]] at {{T&Fcalc|2.03}}.\n\nAmerican and Soviet jumpers were the most successful for the next four decades, and they pioneered the evolution of the [[straddle technique]]. Straddle jumpers took off as in the Western roll, but rotated their (belly-down) torso around the bar, obtaining the most efficient and highest clearance (of the bar) up to that time. Straddle-jumper, [[Charles Dumas]], was the first to clear 7 feet (2.13&nbsp;m), in 1956, American [[John Thomas (high jumper)|John Thomas]] pushed the world mark to {{T&Fcalc|2.23}} in 1960. [[Valeriy Brumel]] took over the event for the next four years. The elegant Soviet jumper radically sped up his approach run, took the record up to {{T&Fcalc|2.28}}, and won the Olympic gold medal in 1964, before a motorcycle accident ended his career.\n[[File:EthelCatherwood1928.jpg|thumb|Gold medal winner [[Ethel Catherwood]] of Canada ''scissors'' over the bar at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]]. Her winning result was {{T&Fcalc|1.59}}.]]\n \n[[File:1912 Platt Adams5.JPG|thumb|left|Platt Adams during the standing high jump competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics]]\nAmerican coaches, including two-time [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] champion Frank Costello of the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], flocked to Russia to learn from Brumel and his coaches. However, it would be a solitary innovator at [[Oregon State University]], [[Dick Fosbury]], who would bring the high jump into the next century. Taking advantage of the raised, softer landing areas by then in use, Fosbury added a new twist to the outmoded Eastern Cut-off. He directed himself over the bar head and shoulders first, sliding over on his back and landing in a fashion which would likely have broken his neck in the old, sawdust landing pits. After he used this [[Fosbury flop]] to win the 1968 Olympic gold medal, the technique began to spread around the world, and soon ''floppers'' were dominating international high jump competitions. The last straddler to set a world record was [[Vladimir Yashchenko]], who cleared {{T&Fcalc|2.33}} in 1977 and then {{T&Fcalc|2.35}} indoors in 1978.\n\nAmong renowned high jumpers following Fosbury's lead were Americans [[Dwight Stones]] and his rival, {{convert|5|ft|8|in|order=flip}} tall [[Franklin Jacobs]] of Paterson, NJ, who cleared {{T&Fcalc|2.32}},  {{convert|0.59|m}} over his head (a feat equalled 27 years later by Sweden's [[Stefan Holm]]); Chinese record-setters [[Ni Zhiqin|Ni-chi Chin]] and [[Zhu Jianhua]]; Germans [[Gerd Wessig]] and [[Dietmar M\u00f6genburg]]; Swedish Olympic medalist and former world record holder [[Patrik Sj\u00f6berg]]; and female jumpers [[Iolanda Bala\u015f]] of Romania, [[Ulrike Meyfarth]] of Germany and Italy's [[Sara Simeoni]].\n\n==Technical aspects==\n\n===Step by Step===\n\nThe most important aspect to put of all pieces of the jump together is the body mechanics the jumper uses to jump. Technique and form has evolved greatly over the history of high jump. The popularity of a style depend upon the time period as listed here:\n\nBeginnings (1790 - 1875) --> two legged lift over bar / \nBasic Scissors (1875 - 1892) --> standing jump and straight run-up / \nEastern Cut-off scissors (1892 - 1912) --> scissors with rotation / \nWestern Roll (1912 - 1930) --> early straddle technique / \nStraddle (1930 - 1960) --> basic straddle technique / \nDive Straddle (1960 - 1978) --> advanced straddle technique / \nFosbury Flop (1968 - current) --> the currently most common technique used / \n\nThe Fosbury Flop is currently deemed as the most efficient way for competitors of the event to propel themselves over the bar. Still depending on the individual athletes specific strengths and weaknesses there are variations on the separate pieces that make up the jump. \n\n==Approach== \nFor a Fosbury flop depending on the athletes jump foot they will start on the right of left of the mat. Placing their jump foot furthest away from the high jump mat. The athlete will have an eight to ten step approach in total, the last five steps being a curve with three or five steps before on a straight. The athlete will want to mark their approach to attempt to find as much consistency as possible.\n\n==Straight Run==\nThe straight run will build the momentum and set the tone for the athletes jump. The athlete will start by pushing off with the take off foot with slow powerful steps then begin to quicken and accelerate them. The athlete should be tall and running up right by the end of their three or five steps.\n\n==Curve Run==\nOn the first step of the curve the athletes take off foot will be landing, they will want to continue accelerating and curving focusing the body towards the opposite back corner of the high jump mat. While staying tall, erect, and leaning away from the mat the athlete should make sure that their final two steps are flat footed, rolling from the heel to toe as well as being the quickest steps.\n\n==Double arm or Single arm Take-off==\nThe take off can have slight variations depending on what feels most natural to the athlete. The double arm take off and the single arm take off. With most things in common, for both the athlete should make sure not to take off at the center of the bar. The plant foot should be the foot furthest away from the bar, angled towards the opposite back corner of the matt, and driving the non take off leg knee up. Keeping in mind this is a vertical jump pushing all force straight up. This will be accompanied with a one or two arm swing while driving the knee.\n\n==Flight==\nThe athlete's non take off leg knee will naturally turn their body placing them in the air with their back to the bar. The athlete will then drive their shoulders to the back of their feet arching their body over the bar. The athlete can look over their right should then judge appropriately when to kick both feet over their head causing their body to miss the body and land on the mat.\n<ref>https://www.liveabout.com/illustrated-high-jump-technique-3258815</ref><ref>by82.156.152.62(talk)19:11,22December2013</ref>\n\n=== More in Depth: The approach run===\n[[File:Ruth Beitia Valence 2008.jpg|thumb|Spanish jumper [[Ruth Beitia]] approaching the bar from an angle]]\nThe approach run of the high jump may actually be more important than the take-off.  If a high jumper runs with bad timing or without enough aggression, clearing a high bar becomes more of a challenge.  The approach requires a certain shape or curve, the right amount of speed, and the correct number of strides.  The approach angle is also critical for optimal height.\n\nMost great straddle jumpers have a run at angles of about 30 to 40 degrees.  The length of the run is determined by the speed of the person's approach.  A slower run requires about 8 strides.  However, a faster high jumper might need about 13 strides.  A greater run speed allows a greater part of the body's forward momentum to be converted upward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coachr.org/hj.htm|title=The HIGH JUMP|first=|last=CoachR|date=|website=www.coachr.org}}</ref>\n\nThe '''J''' type approach, favored by Fosbury floppers, allows for horizontal speed, the ability to turn in the air ([[centripetal force]]), and good take-off position. This allows for horizontal momentum to turn into vertical momentum, propelling the jumper off the ground and over the bar.  The approach should be a hard controlled stride so that a person does not fall from creating an angle with speed.  Athletes should run tall and lean on the curve, from the ankles and not the hips. This allows the correct angle to force their hips to rotate during take-off, which allows their center of gravity to pass under the bar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/catalog/matriarch/OnePiecePage.asp_Q_PageID_E_152_A_PageName_E_ArticleHighJumpApproach |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123060941/http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/catalog/matriarch/OnePiecePage.asp_Q_PageID_E_152_A_PageName_E_ArticleHighJumpApproach |archivedate=November 23, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== More in Depth The take-off===\n\nUnlike the classic straddle technique, where the take-off foot is \"planted\" in the same spot at every height, flop-style jumpers must adjust their take-off as the bar is raised. Their  approach run must be adjusted slightly so that their take-off spot is slightly further out from the bar in order to allow their hips to clear the bar while still maintaining enough momentum to carry their legs across the bar. Jumpers attempting to reach record heights commonly fail when most of their energy is directed into the vertical effort, and they brush the bar off the standards with the backs of their legs as they stall out in mid-air.\n\nAn effective approach shape can be derived from physics. For example, the rate of backward spin required as the jumper crosses the bar to facilitate shoulder clearance on the way up and foot clearance on the way down can be determined by computer simulation. This rotation rate can be back-calculated to determine the required angle of lean away from the bar at plant, based on how long the jumper is on the take-off foot. This information, together with the jumper's speed in the curve, can be used to calculate the radius of the curved part of the approach. This is a lot of work and requires measurements of running speed and time of take-off foot on the ground. However, one can work in the opposite direction by assuming an approach radius and watching the resulting backward rotation. This only works if some basic rules are followed in how one executes the approach and take-off. \n \nDrills can be practiced to solidify the approach.  One drill is to run in a straight line (the linear part of the approach) and then run two to three circles spiraling into one another.  Another is to run or skip a circle of any size, two to three times in a row.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/catalog/matriarch/OnePiecePage.asp_Q_PageID_E_307_A_PageName_E_ArticleGirouxHighJump |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123042035/http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/catalog/matriarch/OnePiecePage.asp_Q_PageID_E_307_A_PageName_E_ArticleGirouxHighJump |archivedate=November 23, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It is important to train to leap upwards without first leaning into the bar, allowing the momentum of the '''J''' approach to carry the body across the bar.\n\n\n== Winner declaration ==\nIn competition the winner is the person who cleared the highest height. In case of a tie, fewer failed attempts at that height are better: ''i.e.'', the jumper who makes a height on his or her first attempt is placed ahead of someone who clears the same height on the second or third attempt. If there still is a tie, all the failed attempts at lower heights are added up, and the one with the fewest total misses is declared the winner. If still tied, a playoff is held.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/disciplines/jumps/high-jump \"How it works\".] iaaf.org. Retrieved 8 August 2015.</ref> Starting height is the next higher height after the overjumped one. If all the competitors clear the height, the bar is raised {{convert|2|cm|abbr=on}}, and if they fail, the bar is lowered 2&nbsp;cm. That continues until only one competitor succeeds in overjumping that height, and he or she is declared the winner.\n\n* In the table below, dashes indicate that a height was not attempted, crosses indicate failed attempts, and circles indicate a cleared height. Jumpers '''A''' and '''D''' cleared 1.99&nbsp;m but failed at 2.01&nbsp;m. '''A''' wins this competition having cleared the winning height with two attempts, while jumper '''D''' required three attempts. Similarly, '''B''' is ranked ahead of '''C''', having cleared the decisive height (i.e., 1.97m) in the first attempt.\n\n{|  class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#dfdfdf\"\n!style=\"align:center\"|Athlete||1.91&nbsp;m||1.93&nbsp;m||1.95&nbsp;m||1.97&nbsp;m||1.99&nbsp;m||2.01&nbsp;m||Height||Rank\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|A\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|XO\n|align=\"center\"|XO\n|align=\"center\"|XO\n|align=\"center\"|XXX\n|align=\"center\"|1.99\n|align=\"center\"|1st\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|B\n|align=\"center\"|O\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|O\n|align=\"center\"|O\n|align=\"center\"|XXX\n|align=\"center\"| \n|align=\"center\"|1.97\n|align=\"center\"|3rd\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|C\n|align=\"center\"|O\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|XO\n|align=\"center\"|XO\n|align=\"center\"|X--\n|align=\"center\"|XX\n|align=\"center\"|1.97\n|align=\"center\"|4th\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|D\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|XO\n|align=\"center\"|O\n|align=\"center\"|XXO\n|align=\"center\"|XXO\n|align=\"center\"|XXX\n|align=\"center\"|1.99\n|align=\"center\"|2nd\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|E\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|O\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|XXX\n|align=\"center\"| \n|align=\"center\"| \n|align=\"center\"|1.93\n|align=\"center\"|5th\n|-\n|}\n\n== Training ==\nIn high jump, it helps if the athlete is tall, has long legs, and limited weight on their body. They must have a strong lower body and flexibility will  help a lot as well. High jumpers tend to go through very vigorous training methods to achieve this ideal body frame.\n\n=== Sprinting ===\nHigh jumpers must have a fast approach so it is crucial to work on speed and also speed endurance. Lots of high jump competitions may take hours and athletes must make sure they have the endurance to last the entire competition. Common sprint endurance workouts for high jumpers include 200-, 400-, and 800-meter training. Other speed endurance training methods such as hill training or a ladder workout may also be used.\n\n=== Weight Lifting ===\nIt is crucial for high jumpers to have strong lower bodies and cores, as the bar progressively gets higher, the strength of an athlete's legs (along with speed and technique) will help propel them over the bar. [[Squat (exercise)|Squat]]s, [[deadlifts]], and core exercises will help a high jumper to achieve these goals. It is important, however, for a high jumper to keep a slim figure as any unnecessary weight makes it difficult to jump higher.\n\n=== Plyometrics ===\nArguably the most important training for a high jumper is [[plyometric]] training. Because high jump is such a technical event, any mistake in the technique could either lead to failure, injury, or both. To prevent these from happening, high jumpers tend to focus heavily on plyometrics. This includes hurdle jumps, flexibility training, skips, or [[scissors kick (strike)|scissor kick]] training. Plyometric workouts tend to be performed at the beginning of the workout.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/PBOnePieceView?storeId=10152&catalogId=10753&pagename=307 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201034837/http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/PBOnePieceView?storeId=10152&catalogId=10753&pagename=307 |archive-date=2017-12-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kangarootrackclub.org/high-jump-drills.html|title=High Jump Drills|first=|last=KangarooTrackClub.org|date=|website=www.kangarootrackclub.org}}</ref>\n\n==All-time top 25 high jumpers==\n{{see also|Men's high jump world record progression|Women's high jump world record progression|Men's high jump indoor world record progression}}\n*{{As of|July 2018}}.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/records/toplists/jumps/high-jump/outdoor/men/senior High Jump - men - senior - outdoor].

'''high jump''' is a [[track and field]] event in which competitors must jump unaided over a horizontal bar placed at measured heights without dislodging it. In its modern most practiced format, a bar is placed between two standards with a crash mat for landing. In the modern era, athletes run towards the bar and use the [[Fosbury Flop]] method of jumping, leaping head first with their back to the bar. Since ancient times, competitors have introduced increasingly effective techniques to arrive at the current form.\n\nThe discipline is, alongside the [[pole vault]], one of two vertical clearance events to feature on the [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic athletics programme]]. It is contested at the [[World Championships in Athletics]] and [[IAAF World Indoor Championships]], and is a common occurrence at track and field meetings. The high jump was among the first events deemed acceptable for women, having been held at the [[Athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Olympic Games]].\n\n[[Javier Sotomayor]] (Cuba) is the current men's record holder with a jump of {{T&Fcalc|2.45}} set in 1993&nbsp;\u2013 the longest standing record in the history of the men's high jump. [[Stefka Kostadinova]] (Bulgaria) has held the women's world record at {{T&Fcalc|2.09}} since 1987, also the longest-held record in the event.\n[[File:Javier Sotomayor 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Javier Sotomayor]], the only person ever to have cleared 8 feet in high jump]]\n\n==Rules==\n[[File:Yelena Slesarenko failing 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Yelena Slesarenko]] hitting the bar while using the Fosbury Flop technique.]]\n\nThe rules for the high jump are set internationally by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF). Jumpers must take off on one foot. A jump is considered a failure if the bar is dislodged by the action of the jumper whilst jumping or the jumper touches the ground or breaks the plane of the near edge of the bar before clearance. The technique one uses for the jump must be almost flawless in order to have a chance of clearing a high bar.\n\nCompetitors may begin jumping at any height announced by the chief judge, or may pass, at their own discretion. Most competitions state that three consecutive missed jumps, at any height or combination of heights, will eliminate the jumper from competition.\n\nThe victory goes to the jumper who clears the greatest height during the final. Tie-breakers are used for any place in which scoring occurs. If two or more jumpers tie for one of these places, the tie-breakers are: 1) the fewest misses at the height at which the tie occurred; and 2) the fewest misses throughout the competition.\n\nIf the event remains tied for first place (or a limited advancement position to a subsequent meet), the jumpers have a jump-off, beginning at the next greater height. Each jumper has one attempt. The bar is then alternately lowered and raised until only one jumper succeeds at a given height.<ref name=\"rules\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/05/47/81/20091027115916_httppostedfile_CompRules2010_web_26Oct09_17166.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011023632/http://iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/05/47/81/20091027115916_httppostedfile_CompRules2010_web_26Oct09_17166.pdf |archivedate=October 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }} iaaf rules</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:1912 Konstantinos Tsiklitiras2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Konstantinos Tsiklitiras]] during the standing high jump competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics]]\nThe first recorded high jump event took place in Scotland in the 19th century. Early jumpers used either an elaborate straight-on approach or a [[Scissors jump|scissors]] technique. In later years, soon then after, the bar was approached diagonally, and the jumper threw first the inside leg and then the other over the bar in a scissoring motion. Around the turn of the 20th century, techniques began to change, beginning with the Irish-American [[Michael Sweeney (athlete)|Michael Sweeney's]] ''[[Eastern cut-off]]''. By taking off like the scissors and extending his spine and flattening out over the bar, Sweeney raised the world record to {{T&Fcalc|1.97}} in 1895.\n\nAnother American, [[George Horine]], developed an even more efficient technique, the ''[[Western roll]]''. In this style, the bar again is approached on a diagonal, but the inner leg is used for the take-off, while the outer leg is thrust up to lead the body sideways over the bar. Horine increased the world standard to {{T&Fcalc|2.01}} in 1912. His technique was predominant through the [[Berlin Olympics]] of 1936, in which the event was won by [[Cornelius Johnson (athlete)|Cornelius Johnson]] at {{T&Fcalc|2.03}}.\n\nAmerican and Soviet jumpers were the most successful for the next four decades, and they pioneered the evolution of the [[straddle technique]]. Straddle jumpers took off as in the Western roll, but rotated their (belly-down) torso around the bar, obtaining the most efficient and highest clearance (of the bar) up to that time. Straddle-jumper, [[Charles Dumas]], was the first to clear 7 feet (2.13&nbsp;m), in 1956, American [[John Thomas (high jumper)|John Thomas]] pushed the world mark to {{T&Fcalc|2.23}} in 1960. [[Valeriy Brumel]] took over the event for the next four years. The elegant Soviet jumper radically sped up his approach run, took the record up to {{T&Fcalc|2.28}}, and won the Olympic gold medal in 1964, before a motorcycle accident ended his career.\n[[File:EthelCatherwood1928.jpg|thumb|Gold medal winner [[Ethel Catherwood]] of Canada ''scissors'' over the bar at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]]. Her winning result was {{T&Fcalc|1.59}}.]]\n \n[[File:1912 Platt Adams5.JPG|thumb|left|Platt Adams during the standing high jump competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics]]\nAmerican coaches, including two-time [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] champion Frank Costello of the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], flocked to Russia to learn from Brumel and his coaches. However, it would be a solitary innovator at [[Oregon State University]], [[Dick Fosbury]], who would bring the high jump into the next century. Taking advantage of the raised, softer landing areas by then in use, Fosbury added a new twist to the outmoded Eastern Cut-off. He directed himself over the bar head and shoulders first, sliding over on his back and landing in a fashion which would likely have broken his neck in the old, sawdust landing pits. After he used this [[Fosbury flop]] to win the 1968 Olympic gold medal, the technique began to spread around the world, and soon ''floppers'' were dominating international high jump competitions. The last straddler to set a world record was [[Vladimir Yashchenko]], who cleared {{T&Fcalc|2.33}} in 1977 and then {{T&Fcalc|2.35}} indoors in 1978.\n\nAmong renowned high jumpers following Fosbury's lead were Americans [[Dwight Stones]] and his rival, {{convert|5|ft|8|in|order=flip}} tall [[Franklin Jacobs]] of Paterson, NJ, who cleared {{T&Fcalc|2.32}},  {{convert|0.59|m}} over his head (a feat equalled 27 years later by Sweden's [[Stefan Holm]]); Chinese record-setters [[Ni Zhiqin|Ni-chi Chin]] and [[Zhu Jianhua]]; Germans [[Gerd Wessig]] and [[Dietmar M\u00f6genburg]]; Swedish Olympic medalist and former world record holder [[Patrik Sj\u00f6berg]]; and female jumpers [[Iolanda Bala\u015f]] of Romania, [[Ulrike Meyfarth]] of Germany and Italy's [[Sara Simeoni]].\n\n==Technical aspects==\n\n===Step by Step===\n\nThe most important aspect to put of all pieces of the jump together is the body mechanics the jumper uses to jump. Technique and form has evolved greatly over the history of high jump. The popularity of a style depend upon the time period as listed here:\n\nBeginnings (1790 - 1875) --> two legged lift over bar / \nBasic Scissors (1875 - 1892) --> standing jump and straight run-up / \nEastern Cut-off scissors (1892 - 1912) --> scissors with rotation / \nWestern Roll (1912 - 1930) --> early straddle technique / \nStraddle (1930 - 1960) --> basic straddle technique / \nDive Straddle (1960 - 1978) --> advanced straddle technique / \nFosbury Flop (1968 - current) --> the currently most common technique used / \n\nThe Fosbury Flop is currently deemed as the most efficient way for competitors of the event to propel themselves over the bar. Still depending on the individual athletes specific strengths and weaknesses there are variations on the separate pieces that make up the jump. \n\n==Approach== \nFor a Fosbury flop depending on the athletes jump foot they will start on the right of left of the mat. Placing their jump foot furthest away from the high jump mat. The athlete will have an eight to ten step approach in total, the last five steps being a curve with three or five steps before on a straight. The athlete will want to mark their approach to attempt to find as much consistency as possible.\n\n==Straight Run==\nThe straight run will build the momentum and set the tone for the athletes jump. The athlete will start by pushing off with the take off foot with slow powerful steps then begin to quicken and accelerate them. The athlete should be tall and running up right by the end of their three or five steps.\n\n==Curve Run==\nOn the first step of the curve the athletes take off foot will be landing, they will want to continue accelerating and curving focusing the body towards the opposite back corner of the high jump mat. While staying tall, erect, and leaning away from the mat the athlete should make sure that their final two steps are flat footed, rolling from the heel to toe as well as being the quickest steps.\n\n==Double arm or Single arm Take-off==\nThe take off can have slight variations depending on what feels most natural to the athlete. The double arm take off and the single arm take off. With most things in common, for both the athlete should make sure not to take off at the center of the bar. The plant foot should be the foot furthest away from the bar, angled towards the opposite back corner of the matt, and driving the non take off leg knee up. Keeping in mind this is a vertical jump pushing all force straight up. This will be accompanied with a one or two arm swing while driving the knee.\n\n==Flight==\nThe athlete's non take off leg knee will naturally turn their body placing them in the air with their back to the bar. The athlete will then drive their shoulders to the back of their feet arching their body over the bar. The athlete can look over their right should then judge appropriately when to kick both feet over their head causing their body to miss the body and land on the mat.\n<ref>https://www.liveabout.com/illustrated-high-jump-technique-3258815</ref><ref>by82.156.152.62(talk)19:11,22December2013</ref>\n\n=== More in Depth: The approach run===\n[[File:Ruth Beitia Valence 2008.jpg|thumb|Spanish jumper [[Ruth Beitia]] approaching the bar from an angle]]\nThe approach run of the high jump may actually be more important than the take-off.  If a high jumper runs with bad timing or without enough aggression, clearing a high bar becomes more of a challenge.  The approach requires a certain shape or curve, the right amount of speed, and the correct number of strides.  The approach angle is also critical for optimal height.\n\nMost great straddle jumpers have a run at angles of about 30 to 40 degrees.  The length of the run is determined by the speed of the person's approach.  A slower run requires about 8 strides.  However, a faster high jumper might need about 13 strides.  A greater run speed allows a greater part of the body's forward momentum to be converted upward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coachr.org/hj.htm|title=The HIGH JUMP|first=|last=CoachR|date=|website=www.coachr.org}}</ref>\n\nThe '''J''' type approach, favored by Fosbury floppers, allows for horizontal speed, the ability to turn in the air ([[centripetal force]]), and good take-off position. This allows for horizontal momentum to turn into vertical momentum, propelling the jumper off the ground and over the bar.  The approach should be a hard controlled stride so that a person does not fall from creating an angle with speed.  Athletes should run tall and lean on the curve, from the ankles and not the hips. This allows the correct angle to force their hips to rotate during take-off, which allows their center of gravity to pass under the bar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/catalog/matriarch/OnePiecePage.asp_Q_PageID_E_152_A_PageName_E_ArticleHighJumpApproach |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123060941/http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/catalog/matriarch/OnePiecePage.asp_Q_PageID_E_152_A_PageName_E_ArticleHighJumpApproach |archivedate=November 23, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== More in Depth The take-off===\n\nUnlike the classic straddle technique, where the take-off foot is \"planted\" in the same spot at every height, flop-style jumpers must adjust their take-off as the bar is raised. Their  approach run must be adjusted slightly so that their take-off spot is slightly further out from the bar in order to allow their hips to clear the bar while still maintaining enough momentum to carry their legs across the bar. Jumpers attempting to reach record heights commonly fail when most of their energy is directed into the vertical effort, and they brush the bar off the standards with the backs of their legs as they stall out in mid-air.\n\nAn effective approach shape can be derived from physics. For example, the rate of backward spin required as the jumper crosses the bar to facilitate shoulder clearance on the way up and foot clearance on the way down can be determined by computer simulation. This rotation rate can be back-calculated to determine the required angle of lean away from the bar at plant, based on how long the jumper is on the take-off foot. This information, together with the jumper's speed in the curve, can be used to calculate the radius of the curved part of the approach. This is a lot of work and requires measurements of running speed and time of take-off foot on the ground. However, one can work in the opposite direction by assuming an approach radius and watching the resulting backward rotation. This only works if some basic rules are followed in how one executes the approach and take-off. \n \nDrills can be practiced to solidify the approach.  One drill is to run in a straight line (the linear part of the approach) and then run two to three circles spiraling into one another.  Another is to run or skip a circle of any size, two to three times in a row.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/catalog/matriarch/OnePiecePage.asp_Q_PageID_E_307_A_PageName_E_ArticleGirouxHighJump |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123042035/http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/catalog/matriarch/OnePiecePage.asp_Q_PageID_E_307_A_PageName_E_ArticleGirouxHighJump |archivedate=November 23, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It is important to train to leap upwards without first leaning into the bar, allowing the momentum of the '''J''' approach to carry the body across the bar.\n\n\n== Winner declaration ==\nIn competition the winner is the person who cleared the highest height. In case of a tie, fewer failed attempts at that height are better: ''i.e.'', the jumper who makes a height on his or her first attempt is placed ahead of someone who clears the same height on the second or third attempt. If there still is a tie, all the failed attempts at lower heights are added up, and the one with the fewest total misses is declared the winner. If still tied, a playoff is held.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/disciplines/jumps/high-jump \"How it works\".] iaaf.org. Retrieved 8 August 2015.</ref> Starting height is the next higher height after the overjumped one. If all the competitors clear the height, the bar is raised {{convert|2|cm|abbr=on}}, and if they fail, the bar is lowered 2&nbsp;cm. That continues until only one competitor succeeds in overjumping that height, and he or she is declared the winner.\n\n* In the table below, dashes indicate that a height was not attempted, crosses indicate failed attempts, and circles indicate a cleared height. Jumpers '''A''' and '''D''' cleared 1.99&nbsp;m but failed at 2.01&nbsp;m. '''A''' wins this competition having cleared the winning height with two attempts, while jumper '''D''' required three attempts. Similarly, '''B''' is ranked ahead of '''C''', having cleared the decisive height (i.e., 1.97m) in the first attempt.\n\n{|  class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#dfdfdf\"\n!style=\"align:center\"|Athlete||1.91&nbsp;m||1.93&nbsp;m||1.95&nbsp;m||1.97&nbsp;m||1.99&nbsp;m||2.01&nbsp;m||Height||Rank\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|A\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|XO\n|align=\"center\"|XO\n|align=\"center\"|XO\n|align=\"center\"|XXX\n|align=\"center\"|1.99\n|align=\"center\"|1st\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|B\n|align=\"center\"|O\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|O\n|align=\"center\"|O\n|align=\"center\"|XXX\n|align=\"center\"| \n|align=\"center\"|1.97\n|align=\"center\"|3rd\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|C\n|align=\"center\"|O\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|XO\n|align=\"center\"|XO\n|align=\"center\"|X--\n|align=\"center\"|XX\n|align=\"center\"|1.97\n|align=\"center\"|4th\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|D\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|XO\n|align=\"center\"|O\n|align=\"center\"|XXO\n|align=\"center\"|XXO\n|align=\"center\"|XXX\n|align=\"center\"|1.99\n|align=\"center\"|2nd\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|E\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|O\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|XXX\n|align=\"center\"| \n|align=\"center\"| \n|align=\"center\"|1.93\n|align=\"center\"|5th\n|-\n|}\n\n== Training ==\nIn high jump, it helps if the athlete is tall, has long legs, and limited weight on their body. They must have a strong lower body and flexibility will  help a lot as well. High jumpers tend to go through very vigorous training methods to achieve this ideal body frame.\n\n=== Sprinting ===\nHigh jumpers must have a fast approach so it is crucial to work on speed and also speed endurance. Lots of high jump competitions may take hours and athletes must make sure they have the endurance to last the entire competition. Common sprint endurance workouts for high jumpers include 200-, 400-, and 800-meter training. Other speed endurance training methods such as hill training or a ladder workout may also be used.\n\n=== Weight Lifting ===\nIt is crucial for high jumpers to have strong lower bodies and cores, as the bar progressively gets higher, the strength of an athlete's legs (along with speed and technique) will help propel them over the bar. [[Squat (exercise)|Squat]]s, [[deadlifts]], and core exercises will help a high jumper to achieve these goals. It is important, however, for a high jumper to keep a slim figure as any unnecessary weight makes it difficult to jump higher.\n\n=== Plyometrics ===\nArguably the most important training for a high jumper is [[plyometric]] training. Because high jump is such a technical event, any mistake in the technique could either lead to failure, injury, or both. To prevent these from happening, high jumpers tend to focus heavily on plyometrics. This includes hurdle jumps, flexibility training, skips, or [[scissors kick (strike)|scissor kick]] training. Plyometric workouts tend to be performed at the beginning of the workout.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/PBOnePieceView?storeId=10152&catalogId=10753&pagename=307 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201034837/http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/PBOnePieceView?storeId=10152&catalogId=10753&pagename=307 |archive-date=2017-12-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kangarootrackclub.org/high-jump-drills.html|title=High Jump Drills|first=|last=KangarooTrackClub.org|date=|website=www.kangarootrackclub.org}}</ref>\n\n==All-time top 25 high jumpers==\n{{see also|Men's high jump world record progression|Women's high jump world record progression|Men's high jump indoor world record progression}}\n*{{As of|July 2018}}.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/records/toplists/jumps/high-jump/outdoor/men/senior High Jump - men - senior - outdoor].

Founded by Peter Loughrey in 1992, LAMA especially champions Modern and Contemporary works by [[California]] and West Coast artists and designers. \n\nAuctions are held three times a year in [[Van Nuys|Van Nuys]], California, and feature a wide range of material including [[painting]], [[photography]], [[prints]], [[sculpture]], [[ceramics]], [[furniture]], [[jewelry]], and [[lighting]]. Since LAMA\u2019s first auction on October 10, 1992, the boutique auction house has carved a niche in the international market with milestone auctions dedicated to individual designers [[Charles and Ray Eames]], [[Paul Laszlo]], and [[R.M. Schindler]], among others.<ref>Connie Koenenn (October 1999), [http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/14/news/cl-22003 Thoroughly Modern Milieu], LA Times. Retrieved 01-21-2010.</ref> LAMA has set dozens of world auction records, including many for works by California artists and designers such as [[Peter Alexander]], [[Ruth Asawa]], [[Larry Bell]], [[Chris Burden]], [[Jay DeFeo]], [[Lorser Feitelson]], [[Mike Kelley]], [[Vasa Mihich]], [[Ken Price]], [[Ed Ruscha]], and [[De Wain Valentine]]. \n\n{{TOC left}}\n\n==History==\n===1990s===\n\nIn October 1989, Peter Loughrey opened vintage furniture gallery Bedrock on La Brea Boulevard. Three years later, Loughrey founded Los Angeles Modern Auctions (LAMA) and hosted the company's first auction on October 10, 1992. The inaugural auction featured 136 lots of Modern design, including works by [[Harry Bertoia]], [[Charles and Ray Eames]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], [[Peter Max]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], and [[Ettore Sottsass]]. \n\nIn 1993, Loughrey closed his gallery and landed in [[London]] to earn a degree in contemporary works of art through the [[Sotheby's Institute of Art]]. As a student, he apprenticed in the Vintage Automobile Department and worked as a porter in the landmark [[Man Ray]] auction at [[Sotheby's]], London.\n\nIn 1995, Loughrey married Shannon Carragher and, together, they re-opened Los Angeles Modern Auctions. The Loughreys conducted their first joint auction at the [[Eric Owen Moss 'Samitaur' building]] in Culver City, California, on May 18, 1996. Their following auction was held five months later on October 27, 1996, at the IM Chait Gallery in [[Beverly Hills]].\n\nHaving built a reputation for expertise in the field of Modernist design, LAMA was chosen to liquidate the Silver Lake architectural offices of [[Richard Neutra]]. The auction house also acquired more than 500 Eames leg splints from an army surplus, which they sold at the gift shops at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Los Angeles.\n\n1998 was a pivotal year for LAMA. It was featured in Wendy Moonan\u2019s [[New York Times]] article on the antiques market, in which she stated, \"The definition of antiques is changing daily, and, as usual, Los Angeles sets the trends.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/16/arts/antiques.html|title=ANTIQUES|last=Moonan|first=Wendy|date=1998-10-16|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-19}}</ref> In February of that year, LAMA launched its website, bringing broader visibility to the company. To cap off an already important year, Peter Loughrey was invited by Echoes Magazine to interview [[Pierre Koenig]], the architect best known for his work on the famed [[Case Study Houses]].\n\nBy 1999, LAMA had established itself as an important player in the Modern art and design markets. \u201cModern Monthly\u201d auctions were held with the average lot selling for less than $500 in a bid to reach young collectors through accessible prices. LAMA was commissioned by [[ARCO]] (Atlantic Ritchfield Corporation) to liquidate the company's corporate fine art collection \u2014 the first major fine art commission for the auction house. The same year, LAMA achieved a world record for any design by Charles Eames when the \u201cConversation\u201d prototype, a 1941 collaboration with [[Eero Saarinen, realized $129,000.\n\n==History: 2000 to 2010==\n\nThe new millennium saw major growth for Los Angeles Modern Auctions. Peter Loughrey was included in [[Art+Auction|Art & Auction]]'s \"Power Issue,\" the publication's annual survey of the art world's most powerful people. After achieving the record price for Eames in 1999, LAMA was given the opportunity to auction a selection of rare examples by the designer including \"DCW\" prototypes. These pieces were handmade by Eames and were from the collection of John and Marilyn Newhart, who authored ''Eames Design- the Work of the Office of Charles and Ray Eames.'' \n\nIn 2002, [[Playboy Enterprises]] chose LAMA to conduct the first ever auction of items from the magazine's archive while Peter and Shanon were employed at [[Butterfields]].  During the same year, LAMA organized the  first auction dedicated to a single collection, that of Michael and Gabrielle Boyd-- also while at Butterfield's. The success of the corporate and single owner sale further solidified LAMA's place in the modern art and design field. \n\nPeter Loughrey signed on with [[Antiques Roadshow]] in 2003 to be an appraiser for the PBS show. This relationship has continued to today, as Peter continues to featured on program. \n\nTwo more world records were achieved at LAMA in 2004, when works by George Nakashima achieved prices over $100,000. To this day, Nakashima is a regular feature in LAMA auctions. This same year, ACME Gallery in Los Angeles asked Peter to co-curate, 'Gio Ponti: Furnished Settings & Figuration.' This show featured the work of the Italian designer, architect and artist who also continues to be a regular feature in LAMA sales. In 2005, ACME and Peter co-curated another show, \"Dutch Design\".  On May 22, 2005 a series of pieces by Laszlo were featured in the LAMA auction, making it the largest and most comprehensive Laszlo commission to ever surface for sale at one time. \n\nDuring the June 3, 2007 sale, LAMA established a new world record price for \"Marilyn\" (#28) by Andy Warhol, realizing $144,000. This great achievement was soon followed by the October 14 sale in which \"Car Hood\" by Judy Chicago realized $288,000.\n\nIn 2008, LAMA conducted its first house sale in which the entire contents of the Linda Sullivan collection were auctioned. This same year, LAMA was featured in Forbes' SOLD!. Also in 2008, Peter and Shannon chose to leave their West Hollywood location to move their current location in Van Nuys, California.  \n\n==LAMA Auction Process==\n\nThe auction process at Los Angeles Modern Auctions is similar to that of other auction houses. For those interested in consigning work to LAMA, there are a few simple steps:\n\n1. Submit Material: Email or mail images and item descriptions of the works. Also, one can make an appointment to bring the works to the showroom if that is more convenient. \n\n2.

Founded by Peter Loughrey in 1992, LAMA especially champions Modern and Contemporary works by [[California]] and West Coast artists and designers. \n\nAuctions are held three times a year in [[Van Nuys|Van Nuys]], California, and feature a wide range of material including [[painting]], [[photography]], [[prints]], [[sculpture]], [[ceramics]], [[furniture]], [[jewelry]], and [[lighting]]. Since LAMA\u2019s first auction on October 10, 1992, the boutique auction house has carved a niche in the international market with milestone auctions dedicated to individual designers [[Charles and Ray Eames]], [[Paul Laszlo]], and [[R.M. Schindler]], among others.<ref>Connie Koenenn (October 1999), [http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/14/news/cl-22003 Thoroughly Modern Milieu], LA Times. Retrieved 01-21-2010.</ref> LAMA has set dozens of world auction records, including many for works by California artists and designers such as [[Peter Alexander]], [[Ruth Asawa]], [[Larry Bell]], [[Chris Burden]], [[Jay DeFeo]], [[Lorser Feitelson]], [[Mike Kelley]], [[Vasa Mihich]], [[Ken Price]], [[Ed Ruscha]], and [[De Wain Valentine]]. \n\n{{TOC left}}\n\n==History: 1990s==\n\nPeter Loughrey opened a vintage furniture gallery, \"Bedrock,\" in October 1989 and, three years later, founded Los Angeles Modern Auctions (LAMA). The company's first auction occurred on October 10, 1992, featuring 150 lots. In 1993, Mr. Loughrey chose to close the gallery and moved to London in order to continue his education at Sotheby's Institute of Art. There he apprenticed in the Vintage Automobile Department and worked as a porter in the landmark Man Ray auction at Sotheby's, London.\n\nIn 1995, Peter married Shannon Carragher and the two re-opened Los Angeles Modern Auctions. On May 18, 1996 Peter and Shannon conducted their first joint auction at the [[Eric Owen Moss|Eric Owen Moss 'Samitaur' building]] in Culver City, California. Five months later, on October 27, 1996 they held an additional auction at the Chait Gallery in Beverly Hills. \n\nHaving built a reputation for expertise in the field of modernist design, LAMA was chosen to liquidate the Silver Lake architectural offices of [[Richard Neutra]]. This same year, the auction house acquired more than 500 [[Eames: The Architect and the Painter|Eames]] leg splints from an army surplus, and distributed them via MoMA and MOCA gift stores. \n\n1998 was a pivotal year for LAMA. First, it was featured in an article on antiques by Wendy Moonan in ''The New York Times,'' which stated: \"The definition of antiques is changing daily, and, as usual, Los Angeles sets the trends.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/16/arts/antiques.html|title=ANTIQUES|last=Moonan|first=Wendy|date=1998-10-16|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-19}}</ref> Additionally, www.lamodern.com was launched on February 2nd of the same year, thereby increasing the visibility and accessibility of the company.  To cap off an already important year, Peter Loughrey was given the honor of interviewing [[Pierre Koenig]] for Echoes Magazine, an architect best known for his work on the famed [[Case Study Houses]]. \n\nBy 1999, LAMA had established itself as an important player in the modern art and design markets. 'Modern Monthly' auctions were held, where the average lot was under $500. The goal of these auctions was to reach young collectors with accessible prices. This same year, LAMA was chosen by [[ARCO]] (\u201cAtlantic Ritchfield Corporation\u201d) to liquidate the company's fine art corporate collection. This was the first major fine art commission for the auction house. More notable, perhaps, was LAMA\u2019s achievement of a world record for a Charles Eames & Eero Saarinen \"Conversation\" prototype, designed in 1941. The price realized for the piece was $129,000, a world record at the time for a design by Eames.\n\n==History: 2000 to 2010==\n\nThe new millennium saw major growth for Los Angeles Modern Auctions. Peter Loughrey was included in [[Art+Auction|Art & Auction]]'s \"Power Issue,\" the publication's annual survey of the art world's most powerful people. After achieving the record price for Eames in 1999, LAMA was given the opportunity to auction a selection of rare examples by the designer including \"DCW\" prototypes. These pieces were handmade by Eames and were from the collection of John and Marilyn Newhart, who authored ''Eames Design- the Work of the Office of Charles and Ray Eames.'' \n\nIn 2002, [[Playboy Enterprises]] chose LAMA to conduct the first ever auction of items from the magazine's archive while Peter and Shanon were employed at [[Butterfields]].  During the same year, LAMA organized the  first auction dedicated to a single collection, that of Michael and Gabrielle Boyd-- also while at Butterfield's. The success of the corporate and single owner sale further solidified LAMA's place in the modern art and design field. \n\nPeter Loughrey signed on with [[Antiques Roadshow]] in 2003 to be an appraiser for the PBS show. This relationship has continued to today, as Peter continues to featured on program. \n\nTwo more world records were achieved at LAMA in 2004, when works by George Nakashima achieved prices over $100,000. To this day, Nakashima is a regular feature in LAMA auctions. This same year, ACME Gallery in Los Angeles asked Peter to co-curate, 'Gio Ponti: Furnished Settings & Figuration.' This show featured the work of the Italian designer, architect and artist who also continues to be a regular feature in LAMA sales. In 2005, ACME and Peter co-curated another show, \"Dutch Design\".  On May 22, 2005 a series of pieces by Laszlo were featured in the LAMA auction, making it the largest and most comprehensive Laszlo commission to ever surface for sale at one time. \n\nDuring the June 3, 2007 sale, LAMA established a new world record price for \"Marilyn\" (#28) by Andy Warhol, realizing $144,000. This great achievement was soon followed by the October 14 sale in which \"Car Hood\" by Judy Chicago realized $288,000.\n\nIn 2008, LAMA conducted its first house sale in which the entire contents of the Linda Sullivan collection were auctioned. This same year, LAMA was featured in Forbes' SOLD!. Also in 2008, Peter and Shannon chose to leave their West Hollywood location to move their current location in Van Nuys, California.  \n\n==LAMA Auction Process==\n\nThe auction process at Los Angeles Modern Auctions is similar to that of other auction houses. For those interested in consigning work to LAMA, there are a few simple steps:\n\n1. Submit Material: Email or mail images and item descriptions of the works. Also, one can make an appointment to bring the works to the showroom if that is more convenient. \n\n2. Receive Auction Estimate: Once the specialists review the items, they will establish an auction estimate based upon the current market value of the work. This estimate is free of charge. \n\n3. Establish a Commission Structure: A commission is a flat percentage based on the total value of the consignment. This is an all-inclusive fee which includes all listing fees, advertising and promotional material. \n\n\n==World Records==\n\nSince the company's founding in 1992, LAMA has achieved several world records at auction for works of fine art and design.  \n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Sale Date!!Artist!!Title!!Price Realized!!Record\n|-\n|Oct. 2016||Jay DeFeo||''Apex'' ||$281,250||Any work by the artist at auction\n|-\n|Feb. 2016||Mary Corse||''Copper-Four Crosses''||$100,000||Any work by the artist at auction\n|-\n|Feb. 2016||John Lautner||Floor Lamp||$43,750||Any design at auction\n|-\n|Feb. 2016||James Gill||''Infinite Regress DNA''||$22,500||Any work by the artist at auction\n|-\n|Oct. 2014||Ed Ruscha||''Double Standard''||$206,250||Any print by the artist at auction\n|-\n|Oct. 2014||Mike Kelley||''Nazi War Cave #1''||$740,000||Any work on paper by the artist at auction\n|-\n|Oct. 2014||Robert Mapplethorpe||''Self Portrait''||$87,500||New record for the edition\n|-\n|Oct. 2014||Maria Pergay||Flying Carpet, daybed||$162,500||New record for the design at auction\n|-\n|May 2010||Francois-Xavier Lalanne||''Singes Attentifs SI & SII''||$199,062.50||New record for 'Monkeys' at auction\n|-\n|June 2007||Andy Warhol||''Marilyn (#28)''||$144,000||New record for ''Marilyn'' series by Warhol\n|-\n|May 1999||Charles Eames & Eero Saarinen||\"Conversation\" prototype\narmchair\n||$129,000||New record for this design at auction\n|}\n\n==Awards==\n\nThe Printing Industries of America recognized LAMA in 2012 for its May 6, 2012 Modern Art & Design Auction catalog as the \"Best Services Catalog\". \n\n==Television==\n\nPeter Loughrey is a repeat appraiser on PBS's [[Antiques Roadshow]].

She first appeared on screen on 7 June 2010. On 24 October 2011, it was announced Babbington's contract would not be renewed and Jodie departed on 14 November 2011, along with [[Poppy Meadow]] ([[Rachel Bright]]).\n\nOriginally introduced as a [[Romantic interest|love interest]] for [[Darren Miller]] ([[Charlie G. Hawkins]]), she is also the daughter of established character [[Vanessa Gold]] ([[Z\u00f6e Lucker]]). Jodie is [[Jewish]] and Darren has a [[circumcision]] operation to respect this. Her step-father, [[Harry Gold (EastEnders)|Harry]] ([[Linal Haft]]) was thought to be her father until Vanessa reveals this to him in an argument. Darren also proposes to Jodie but decides not to marry her after thinking he's not good enough for her.\n\nBabbington received many letters within six months of her initial appearance, from fans saying that Jodie is their ideal woman. Daniella Graham from the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' said that \"viewers were left questioning why on earth anyone thought this pointless sub-plot was necessary.\" This was later confirmed to be \"filler\" as a number of scenes were cut out from [[Tommy Moon]]'s funeral.\n\n==Storylines==\nIn Jodie's first appearance, she is found by [[Darren Miller]] ([[Charlie G. Hawkins]]) in the road saying she is lost. Darren offers to help her and she agrees to go on a date. She then finds her mother, [[Vanessa Gold|Vanessa]] ([[Z\u00f6e Lucker]]) who hands her the keys to her new car, and Jodie reveals she got the job she had interviewed for at [[Roxy Mitchell]]'s ([[Rita Simons]]) salon. The next day she goes for lunch with Darren and she thinks it is sweet when Darren reveals he has a son, [[George Trott]]. Their relationship gets off to a rocky start, especially when Darren accuses Jodie of stealing his World Cup tickets, but eventually they agree to have sex. However, when Jodie sees that Darren is not circumcised, she explains that she is [[Judaism|Jewish]] and cannot have sex with a man who is not circumcised, though she does not go to a [[synagogue]]. This causes them to break up temporarily but they soon start dating again, saying they can wait to have sex. Darren has his circumcision in secret, telling Jodie he is on holiday. However, when Vanessa's affair with Darren's boss [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) is revealed and she is dumped by her husband [[Harry Gold (EastEnders)|Harry]] ([[Linal Haft]]), Jodie dumps Darren, thinking that he has been laughing at her, and disowns her mother. However, Jodie and Vanessa are reunited after a fire breaks out in [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]] (see [[Queen Vic Fire Week]]).\n\nDarren tries to win Jodie back by trying to explain that he had a circumcision but she will not listen to him because he did not tell her about Max and Vanessa. However, she finally reads a letter he wrote and they reunite. Vanessa ends her affair with Max so that Jodie and Darren can continue to see each other, and Jodie and Darren have sex for the first time. During a special lunch on Vanessa's birthday, Harry shows little interest in her, and Jodie tells her that she realises now that they are not happy together and urges her to go back to Max, which she does. When Harry issues Vanessa with divorce papers, saying he can convince Jodie to turn against her, she tells him he is not Jodie's father. Harry sends Jodie to live with Vanessa, and he later tells Darren he is not Jodie's father. Darren begs him not to tells her as it would break her heart but later Jodie says Harry phoned her and Darren assumes he told her, so he inadvertently reveals the truth. Jodie initially disowns her mother but when she tries to find a place of her own, she realises she needs Vanessa with her. Harry then starts to take revenge, including throwing a brick through the window and killing Jodie's cat. Vanessa tells Jodie she met a young Portuguese fisherman on holiday and he is her father, though she did not know his name.\n\nDuring a New Year's Eve party, a drunken Jodie persuades Darren to tell her he wants to marry her. Darren is unsure at first but goes to propose, but she stops him as she was not serious. However, she is delighted that he would have asked her. In a conversation with her friend [[Poppy Meadow]] ([[Rachel Bright]]), Jodie says she wishes Harry would stop blaming her for something that was not her fault. She appears as a \"mascot\" for the relaunch of the car lot, much to Vanessa's annoyance, though no one turns up as Darren did not send the fliers out, so he is fired. Jodie tells him that it will be okay, though he blames her for his sacking so she dumps him. She then goes to the [[R&R (EastEnders)|R&R nightclub]] where she sees Darren kissing another girl; Jodie storms out of the club. However, she overhears him telling [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) how much he still loves Jodie. Jodie walks in and he tells her he would not change anything about her and proposes; she accepts. Jodie then gets a job at The Queen Vic as a barmaid. Darren gains custody of George, who keeps Jodie awake at night, causing her to be late for work where she is told by Roxy that there is a new manager of the salon, Max's ex-wife [[Tanya Branning|Tanya Jessop]] ([[Jo Joyner]]). When Jodie is left alone with George, she struggles and leaves him with [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Fergison]]), George's mother. She later forgets, and when Darren calls her, she rushes back to Heather and takes George back without Darren knowing what had happened. Darren later finds out after George has an accident while in Jodie's care, and Jodie and Darren break up as she is not ready to be a stepmother. However, Darren decides George is better off with Heather, and he and Jodie reunite. Darren later goes to visit his family without Jodie. On his return, he starts stealing from work in order to pay for the wedding. He is soon discovered by [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]), who informs Jodie and she calls off the wedding until Darren wins her back round. However, he then cheats on her with Jodie's friend [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]). Jodie finds them together and despite this, she decides that she still wants to marry Darren. However, before the wedding, Darren decides he is not good enough for Jodie and leaves Walford. Jodie is further dismayed when her mother, Vanessa leaves Walford, but is supported by Poppy, and the pair become flatmates. They rent a flat from [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), but when he increases their rent, they refuse to pay and Ian tells Jodie and Poppy to leave. They then move in with brothers [[Anthony Moon|Anthony]] ([[Matt Lapinskas]]) and [[Tyler Moon]] (Tony Discipline).\n\nIt soon emerges that Poppy is attracted to Anthony, and Jodie tells him. Anthony prefers Jodie, but despite this, he asks Poppy out on a date. His feelings for Jodie grow and they later kiss, which leaves her feeling remorseful. Jodie decides to leave London because of the kiss. However, Poppy believes that Jodie is leaving as she is lonely without Darren, so sets her up with Tyler. Anthony stops Tyler from asking her out, though Poppy is confused by this and Jodie tells Poppy about the kiss. The next day, Poppy is still furious over the kiss and is not speaking to Jodie. Tyler tricks the two girls to meet up with each other, after Tyler sends a message on Poppy's phone to Jodie, forgiving her. They then repair their friendship. Jodie begins to miss Darren, and after being suggested by Poppy, she decides that she and Darren were meant to be together and goes to find him in [[Oxford]], where Darren is staying with his ex-girlfriend [[Libby Fox]] ([[Belinda Owusu]]). Poppy and Jodie go separate ways after saying an emotional goodbye, with Jodie finding Darren and Poppy moving back with her mother.\n\n==Creation and development==\nJodie first appears on screen on 7 June 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00spgrn|title=EastEnders 07/06/2010|publisher=[[BBC Programmes]]|accessdate=24 September 2010}}</ref> The character was announced on 10 May 2010 as love interest for [[Darren Miller]] ([[Charlie G.

She first appeared on screen on 7 June 2010. On 24 October 2011, it was announced Babbington's contract would not be renewed and Jodie departed on 14 November 2011, along with [[Poppy Meadow]] ([[Rachel Bright]]).\n\nOriginally introduced as a [[Romantic interest|love interest]] for [[Darren Miller]] ([[Charlie G. Hawkins]]), she is also the daughter of established character [[Vanessa Gold]] ([[Z\u00f6e Lucker]]). Jodie is [[Jewish]] and Darren has a [[circumcision]] operation to respect this. Her step-father, [[Harry Gold (EastEnders)|Harry]] ([[Linal Haft]]) was thought to be her father until Vanessa reveals this to him in an argument. Darren also proposes to Jodie but decides not to marry her after thinking he's not good enough for her.\n\nBabbington received many letters within six months of her initial appearance, from fans saying that Jodie is their ideal woman. Daniella Graham from the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' said that \"viewers were left questioning why on earth anyone thought this pointless sub-plot was necessary.\" This was later confirmed to be \"filler\" as a number of scenes were cut out from [[Tommy Moon]]'s funeral.\n\n==Storylines==\nIn Jodie's first appearance, she is found by [[Darren Miller]] ([[Charlie G. Hawkins]]) in the road saying she is lost. Darren offers to help her and she agrees to go on a date. She then finds her mother, [[Vanessa Gold|Vanessa]] ([[Z\u00f6e Lucker]]) who hands her the keys to her new car, and Jodie reveals she got the job she had interviewed for at [[Roxy Mitchell]]'s ([[Rita Simons]]) salon. The next day she goes for lunch with Darren and she thinks it is sweet when Darren reveals he has a son, [[George Trott]]. Their relationship gets off to a rocky start, especially when Darren accuses Jodie of stealing his World Cup tickets, but eventually they agree to have sex. However, when Jodie sees that Darren is not circumcised, she explains that she is [[Judaism|Jewish]] and cannot have sex with a man who is not circumcised, though she does not go to a [[synagogue]]. This causes them to break up temporarily but they soon start dating again, saying they can wait to have sex. Darren has his circumcision in secret, telling Jodie he is on holiday. However, when Vanessa's affair with Darren's boss [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) is revealed and she is dumped by her husband [[Harry Gold (EastEnders)|Harry]] ([[Linal Haft]]), Jodie dumps Darren, thinking that he has been laughing at her, and disowns her mother. However, Jodie and Vanessa are reunited after a fire breaks out in [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]] (see [[Queen Vic Fire Week]]).\n\nDarren tries to win Jodie back by trying to explain that he had a circumcision but she will not listen to him because he did not tell her about Max and Vanessa. However, she finally reads a letter he wrote and they reunite. Vanessa ends her affair with Max so that Jodie and Darren can continue to see each other, and Jodie and Darren have sex for the first time. During a special lunch on Vanessa's birthday, Harry shows little interest in her, and Jodie tells her that she realises now that they are not happy together and urges her to go back to Max, which she does. When Harry issues Vanessa with divorce papers, saying he can convince Jodie to turn against her, she tells him he is not Jodie's father. Harry sends Jodie to live with Vanessa, and he later tells Darren he is not Jodie's father. Darren begs him not to tells her as it would break her heart but later Jodie says Harry phoned her and Darren assumes he told her, so he inadvertently reveals the truth. Jodie initially disowns her mother but when she tries to find a place of her own, she realises she needs Vanessa with her. Harry then starts to take revenge, including throwing a brick through the window and killing Jodie's cat. Vanessa tells Jodie she met a young Portuguese fisherman on holiday and he is her father, though she did not know his name.\n\nDuring a New Year's Eve party, a drunken Jodie persuades Darren to tell her he wants to marry her. Darren is unsure at first but goes to propose, but she stops him as she was not serious. However, she is delighted that he would have asked her. In a conversation with her friend [[Poppy Meadow]] ([[Rachel Bright]]), Jodie says she wishes Harry would stop blaming her for something that was not her fault. She appears as a \"mascot\" for the relaunch of the car lot, much to Vanessa's annoyance, though no one turns up as Darren did not send the fliers out, so he is fired. Jodie tells him that it will be okay, though he blames her for his sacking so she dumps him. She then goes to the [[R&R (EastEnders)|R&R nightclub]] where she sees Darren kissing another girl; Jodie storms out of the club. However, she overhears him telling [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) how much he still loves Jodie. Jodie walks in and he tells her he would not change anything about her and proposes; she accepts. Jodie then gets a job at The Queen Vic as a barmaid. Darren gains custody of George, who keeps Jodie awake at night, causing her to be late for work where she is told by Roxy that there is a new manager of the salon, Max's ex-wife [[Tanya Branning|Tanya Jessop]] ([[Jo Joyner]]). When Jodie is left alone with George, she struggles and leaves him with [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Fergison]]), George's mother. She later forgets, and when Darren calls her, she rushes back to Heather and takes George back without Darren knowing what had happened. Darren later finds out after George has an accident while in Jodie's care, and Jodie and Darren break up as she is not ready to be a stepmother. However, Darren decides George is better off with Heather, and he and Jodie reunite. Darren later goes to visit his family without Jodie. On his return, he starts stealing from work in order to pay for the wedding. He is soon discovered by [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]), who informs Jodie and she calls off the wedding until Darren wins her back round. However, he then cheats on her with Jodie's friend [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]). Jodie finds them together and despite this, she decides that she still wants to marry Darren. However, before the wedding, Darren decides he is not good enough for Jodie and leaves Walford. Jodie is further dismayed when her mother, Vanessa leaves Walford, but is supported by Poppy, and the pair become flatmates. They rent a flat from [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), but when he increases their rent, they refuse to pay and Ian tells Jodie and Poppy to leave. They then move in with brothers [[Anthony Moon|Anthony]] ([[Matt Lapinskas]]) and [[Tyler Moon]] (Tony Discipline).\n\nIt soon emerges that Poppy is attracted to Anthony, and Jodie tells him. Anthony prefers Jodie, but despite this, he asks Poppy out on a date. His feelings for Jodie grow and they later kiss, which leaves her feeling remorseful. Jodie decides to leave London because of the kiss. However, Poppy believes that Jodie is leaving as she is lonely without Darren, so sets her up with Tyler. Anthony stops Tyler from asking her out, though Poppy is confused by this and Jodie tells Poppy about the kiss. The next day, Poppy is still furious over the kiss and is not speaking to Jodie. Tyler tricks the two girls to meet up with each other, after Tyler sends a message on Poppy's phone to Jodie, forgiving her. They then repair their friendship. Jodie begins to miss Darren, and after being suggested by Poppy, she decides that she and Darren were meant to be together and goes to find him in [[Oxford]], where Darren is staying with his ex-girlfriend [[Libby Fox]] ([[Belinda Owusu]]). Poppy and Jodie go separate ways after saying an emotional goodbye, with Jodie finding Darren and Poppy moving back with her mother.\n\n==Creation and development==\nJodie first appears on screen on 7 June 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00spgrn|title=EastEnders 07/06/2010|publisher=[[BBC Programmes]]|accessdate=24 September 2010}}</ref> The character was announced on 10 May 2010 as love interest for [[Darren Miller]] ([[Charlie G.

Ngaraard is located on the northern tip of [[Babeldaob]] directly adjacent to [[Ngarchelong]] state. There are five [[Hamlet (place)|hamlets]] in Ngaraard, including [[Choll]], [[Elab]], [[Ngebuked]], [[Ngkeklau]] and the state capital, [[Ulimang]], located on the eastern shore of the state. Previously, the capital of Ngaraard was the village of Ngebuked, where the traditional leader of the state, [[Maderangebuked]], lived and reigned. There is a saying in Ngaraard, ''A rengud a dokngei'', meaning \"everyone works together as one in spirit and in the heart.\"\n\n==History==\nNgaraard's history can be divided into four eras corresponding to [[Spain|Spanish]], [[Germany|German]] and [[Japan]]ese domination up to [[World War II]].\n\n===Spaniards and Germans===\nDuring the Spanish era a priest named Father Luis lived in Elab teaching [[Christianity]]. However, the people from Ngaraard did not accept Christianity, so he went to [[Melekeok]] to Chief Reklai, but no one there accepted it either, so he left for Ngchesar. On his way to Ngchesar, he became lost and fell ill. Chief Reklai heard about Father Luis so he sent people to look for him. They found Father Luis very sick, and the Melekeokians cared for him until he died. He was buried crosswise, unlike everyone else at the Uudes burial ground.\n\nDuring the German era, the Germans passed laws that Palauans must work to grow various plants, those refusing would be sent to Ngebuked for imprisonment. This is one reasons explaining the many [[coconut]]s in Palau. Germans also outlawed marriage and any religion except [[Catholicism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Some people of Ngaraard moved to [[Angaur]] to work in the [[phosphate]] mines. Later, doctors from Angaur traveled to Ngebuked because of an outbreak of [[leprosy]], sending the sick to Melekeok for healing. The leprosy outbreak resulted in the deaths of many Palauans.\n\n===Japanese Era and World Wars===\nDuring the Japanese era, there was a Japanese school in Ulimang, Ngaraard, offering primary education for first, second, and third grades. Students at the school came from [[Ngardmau]], Ngerchelong, Kayangel and Ngaraard. Every morning students had assembly and they would bow to the Japanese as a sign of their respect and loyalty to the Japanese Emperor. Students found ignorant of their lessons would be punished by standing outside all day staring at the sun, or being forced to carry buckets of water up and down stairs for hours on end.\n\nNgaraard had two stores, the first selling sweets and clothing materials.  The Nanboyeki store bought coconuts from all the islands. People lacking money could exchange coconuts for cloth. Many people from Ngaraard went to work at Angaur for phosphate mining; others went to Ngardmau to work on [[bauxite]] and some went to work for Nanboyeki. There were also Spanish priests in [[Koror]] who traveled to the islands propagating Christianity. When [[World War I]] started in Palau, people from Ngerchelong and Peleliu arrived in Ngaraard, where Taro Matsuda, Maderangebuked's younger brother, found families to host them.\n\nWhen World War II began, most people fled to the jungles of Ngebuked. People wanting to go to the taro patch or go fishing needed permission from Japanese soldiers. When they finished working the taro patch or fishing they had to report to the Japanese soldiers, informing them they were finished. When American attacks began, people from Ngaraard were terrified because none had seen airplanes before. They called them \"big bird with fire\" ''(Meklou el kiued el ngarngii ngau el tuobed a ngerel)''. During that time, food ran short because the Japanese kept taking food from the Palauans. The people of Ngaraard left at night to find food because the American planes would not come, but they had to be careful because if Japanese soldiers saw them they would be killed.\n\nThe Japanese were ordered to collect Palauans and kill them. Japanese soldiers met with the Palau chiefs to discuss where to house the Peleliu people, because they planned to make Peleliu their military base. None of the chiefs wished to house the Peleliu people. Maderangebuked volunteered to take the Peleliu people, since Ngaraard had large taro patches and farms to produce food. This is why the Ngaraard people and Peleliu people have a special friendship.\n\nThere is Odesangel stone, this is an old name of Peleliu standing by Bai ra Ngaruau. The people of Peleliu who were in Ngebuked during the war carved the Odesangel Bad. They carved the stone as a memorial of the time they came out from hiding. \"Odesangel Bad, 1945 28/9\" is carved on the stone, showing that the people of Peleliu and those from Ngebuked and others that were hiding in the jungle emerged from their hiding place on September 28, 1945.\n\n==Cultural background and organization==\nIt is said that the Ngebuked people were originally from Angaur, living on a mountain called Roisbuked. When Roisbuked became overpopulated and there was limited land for crops or food, the people from Angaur began looking for another island to live on. After leaving Roisbuked, they moved to [[Peleliu]], called Ngerchol. When Ngerchol could not hold anymore people, they moved to Babeldaob, landing in a place between Melekeok and Ngaraard. After landing, they walked toward Ngiwal, but Ngiwal's inhabitants were unwelcoming so they moved to Ngaraard in Ngeteluang.\n\nNgebuked was divided into two sections, ''bita el ked ma bita el ked''.  The chief of one section was Kerai and in the other section was an old woman named Romei. When Romei could not hold all the responsibilities as chief, she asked Oiseuang, another older woman to rule. Two brothers from Ngeruangel sailed by and saw smoke rising at Ngebuked, so they stopped to get supplies.  The older brother liked what he saw at Ngebuked and decided to stay; the younger brother traveled to other areas of Babeldaob. The younger brother ended up in Melekeok and became Chief of Melekeok and the older brother stayed in Ngebuked.\n\nOiseuang aged and could not perform her chiefly duties, so she looked for a person able to perform the work as the chief. She visited a man she felt was competent and asked if he would become a chief, and he asked he could be named Mad. Chief Mad united the two sections into one village of Ngebuked and so he became Mad ra Ngebuked. Kerai remained village head, meaning that when there was a contribution of food, he still received the portion for the first title, but the one who has the authority and power over Ngebukedd is Maderangebuked. Therefore, the order of chiefly title is that the first title is Maderangebuked, the second title is Kerai and the third is Techur. Techur had clan members from Ngeaur, Airai and Ngerchelong. Therefore, if a member from Angaur assumed the title then he would be called Techureaur, if a clan member from Ngerchelong assumed the title he would be called Techurchelong, and if he was from Airai he would be called Techurrulak.\n\n==Resources==\nNgaraard has many natural resources, mainly [[forests]] and [[water]]. The landscape is mostly mountainous forest, sandy beaches on Desbedall and mangroves on the Keiukel side.  There are many living things in Ngaraard's land, including fruit bats, pigeons, starlings, pigs, mangrove crabs, land crabs, cone shells (rechiil), shrimp in the creek, banded snakes (mengernger), aquatic snakes (kemaiirs), dogs, and cats. There are also many varieties of insects, including mosquitoes, wasps, bees, kerdard and many more.\n\nOne of the famous crops of Ngaraard is taro and its recipe, which uses taro leaves, coconut milk and land crab, is called ''demok''. These are some other crops of Ngaraard: swamp cabbage (kangkum), tapioca (diokang), sweet potato (chemutii), giant swamp taro (brak), banana, calamondin (kingkang), breadfruits, ysaol, amra tree (titimel), Eugenia plant (chedebsachel), wax apple (rebotel), betelnut tree and pepper leaf (kebui). Ngaraard has a rich soil and plenty of crops but only a few vegetables.\n\n==Villages==\nThe inhabited villages of Ngaraard State include the following (from north to south):\n[[Choll]],\n[[Elab]],\n[[Ulimang]],\n[[Ngebuked]], and\n[[Ngkeklau]].\n\nThere are many important places in the State of Ngaraard.  There are the traditional village sites of Elab, Chetoilechang, Diong er Ngerchokl, Bai ra Ngaruau, Chelsel a Beluu er Ngebuked, Diong era Imeduurang, Ulimang. Ulimang is said to be the child of god Chuab.  Other important places include: Head Start, the elementary school and Bethania High School, a hospital, Bai ra Rubak, the Ngaraard State Office at Koror, Bem Yore and the stores.\n\nThe lifestyle of Ngaraard has changed a lot due to the introduction of [[technology|modern technology]], including [[personal computer|computers]], [[telephone]]s, [[electricity]] and [[televisions]]. Due to the construction of roads, the majority of people in the state now use [[car]]s for transportation rather than [[boat]]s. However boats are still used for [[fishing]].\n\n==Population and geography==\nThe population of Ngaraard has changed considerably over the years. In 1990, its population was 440 and in 1996, it decreased to 360. In 2000, it had increased to 638. The Office of Statistics under the [[Ministry of Finance]] has not yet determined the total population for 2004.\n\nNgaraard has a [[tropical climate]]. The temperature ranges from a high of 83\u02d9F to a low of 81\u02d9F.  Rainfall takes place from May to January and the heaviest rain is in June and July. The climate is dry from February until April.\n\n==Flag==\nNgaraard recently changed its flag. It is made of a golden-yellow star on a field of deep sky blue.  Behind the star, it has a red stripe from the bottom left corner to the upper right corner of the flag.  The star stands for the unity of Ngaraard State, and the five fingers of the star stand for the five counties or hamlets of Ngaraard.  The stripe of the flag shows that the state has both the east and west coast of northern Babeldaob and is striving for success.  The blue background symbolizes the blue of the sky and ocean surrounding the Ngaraard State.\n\n== Education==\nThe [[Ministry of Education (Palau)|Ministry of Education]] operates public schools.\n\nNgaraard Elementary School was established after [[World War II]], circa 1947, using a school building opened during the Japanese [[South Pacific Mandate]] rule.

Ngaraard is located on the northern tip of [[Babeldaob]] directly adjacent to [[Ngarchelong]] state. There are five [[Hamlet (place)|hamlets]] in Ngaraard, including [[Choll]], [[Elab]], [[Ngebuked]], [[Ngkeklau]] and the state capital, [[Ulimang]], located on the eastern shore of the state. Previously, the capital of Ngaraard was the village of Ngebuked, where the traditional leader of the state, [[Maderangebuked]], lived and reigned. There is a saying in Ngaraard, ''A rengud a dokngei'', meaning \"everyone works together as one in spirit and in the heart.\"\n\n==History==\nNgaraard's history can be divided into four eras corresponding to [[Spain|Spanish]], [[Germany|German]] and [[Japan]]ese domination up to [[World War II]].\n\n===Spaniards and Germans===\nDuring the Spanish era a priest named Father Luis lived in Elab teaching [[Christianity]]. However, the people from Ngaraard did not accept Christianity, so he went to [[Melekeok]] to Chief Reklai, but no one there accepted it either, so he left for Ngchesar. On his way to Ngchesar, he became lost and fell ill. Chief Reklai heard about Father Luis so he sent people to look for him. They found Father Luis very sick, and the Melekeokians cared for him until he died. He was buried crosswise, unlike everyone else at the Uudes burial ground.\n\nDuring the German era, the Germans passed laws that Palauans must work to grow various plants, those refusing would be sent to Ngebuked for imprisonment. This is one reasons explaining the many [[coconut]]s in Palau. Germans also outlawed marriage and any religion except [[Catholicism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Some people of Ngaraard moved to [[Angaur]] to work in the [[phosphate]] mines. Later, doctors from Angaur traveled to Ngebuked because of an outbreak of [[leprosy]], sending the sick to Melekeok for healing. The leprosy outbreak resulted in the deaths of many Palauans.\n\n===Japanese Era and World Wars===\nDuring the Japanese era, there was a Japanese school in Ulimang, Ngaraard, offering primary education for first, second, and third grades. Students at the school came from [[Ngardmau]], Ngerchelong, Kayangel and Ngaraard. Every morning students had assembly and they would bow to the Japanese as a sign of their respect and loyalty to the Japanese Emperor. Students found ignorant of their lessons would be punished by standing outside all day staring at the sun, or being forced to carry buckets of water up and down stairs for hours on end.\n\nNgaraard had two stores, the first selling sweets and clothing materials.  The Nanboyeki store bought coconuts from all the islands. People lacking money could exchange coconuts for cloth. Many people from Ngaraard went to work at Angaur for phosphate mining; others went to Ngardmau to work on [[bauxite]] and some went to work for Nanboyeki. There were also Spanish priests in [[Koror]] who traveled to the islands propagating Christianity. When [[World War I]] started in Palau, people from Ngerchelong and Peleliu arrived in Ngaraard, where Taro Matsuda, Maderangebuked's younger brother, found families to host them.\n\nWhen World War II began, most people fled to the jungles of Ngebuked. People wanting to go to the taro patch or go fishing needed permission from Japanese soldiers. When they finished working the taro patch or fishing they had to report to the Japanese soldiers, informing them they were finished. When American attacks began, people from Ngaraard were terrified because none had seen airplanes before. They called them \"big bird with fire\" ''(Meklou el kiued el ngarngii ngau el tuobed a ngerel)''. During that time, food ran short because the Japanese kept taking food from the Palauans. The people of Ngaraard left at night to find food because the American planes would not come, but they had to be careful because if Japanese soldiers saw them they would be killed.\n\nThe Japanese were ordered to collect Palauans and kill them. Japanese soldiers met with the Palau chiefs to discuss where to house the Peleliu people, because they planned to make Peleliu their military base. None of the chiefs wished to house the Peleliu people. Maderangebuked volunteered to take the Peleliu people, since Ngaraard had large taro patches and farms to produce food. This is why the Ngaraard people and Peleliu people have a special friendship.\n\nThere is Odesangel stone, this is an old name of Peleliu standing by Bai ra Ngaruau. The people of Peleliu who were in Ngebuked during the war carved the Odesangel Bad. They carved the stone as a memorial of the time they came out from hiding. \"Odesangel Bad, 1945 28/9\" is carved on the stone, showing that the people of Peleliu and those from Ngebuked and others that were hiding in the jungle emerged from their hiding place on September 28, 1945.\n\n==Cultural background and organization==\nIt is said that the Ngebuked people were originally from Angaur, living on a mountain called Roisbuked. When Roisbuked became overpopulated and there was limited land for crops or food, the people from Angaur began looking for another island to live on. After leaving Roisbuked, they moved to [[Peleliu]], called Ngerchol. When Ngerchol could not hold anymore people, they moved to Babeldaob, landing in a place between Melekeok and Ngaraard. After landing, they walked toward Ngiwal, but Ngiwal's inhabitants were unwelcoming so they moved to Ngaraard in Ngeteluang.\n\nNgebuked was divided into two sections, ''bita el ked ma bita el ked''.  The chief of one section was Kerai and in the other section was an old woman named Romei. When Romei could not hold all the responsibilities as chief, she asked Oiseuang, another older woman to rule. Two brothers from Ngeruangel sailed by and saw smoke rising at Ngebuked, so they stopped to get supplies.  The older brother liked what he saw at Ngebuked and decided to stay; the younger brother traveled to other areas of Babeldaob. The younger brother ended up in Melekeok and became Chief of Melekeok and the older brother stayed in Ngebuked.\n\nOiseuang aged and could not perform her chiefly duties, so she looked for a person able to perform the work as the chief. She visited a man she felt was competent and asked if he would become a chief, and he asked he could be named Mad. Chief Mad united the two sections into one village of Ngebuked and so he became Mad ra Ngebuked. Kerai remained village head, meaning that when there was a contribution of food, he still received the portion for the first title, but the one who has the authority and power over Ngebukedd is Maderangebuked. Therefore, the order of chiefly title is that the first title is Maderangebuked, the second title is Kerai and the third is Techur. Techur had clan members from Ngeaur, Airai and Ngerchelong. Therefore, if a member from Angaur assumed the title then he would be called Techureaur, if a clan member from Ngerchelong assumed the title he would be called Techurchelong, and if he was from Airai he would be called Techurrulak.\n\n==Resources==\nNgaraard has many natural resources, mainly [[forests]] and [[water]]. The landscape is mostly mountainous forest, sandy beaches on Desbedall and mangroves on the Keiukel side.  There are many living things in Ngaraard's land, including fruit bats, pigeons, starlings, pigs, mangrove crabs, land crabs, cone shells (rechiil), shrimp in the creek, banded snakes (mengernger), aquatic snakes (kemaiirs), dogs, and cats. There are also many varieties of insects, including mosquitoes, wasps, bees, kerdard and many more.\n\nOne of the famous crops of Ngaraard is taro and its recipe, which uses taro leaves, coconut milk and land crab, is called ''demok''. These are some other crops of Ngaraard: swamp cabbage (kangkum), tapioca (diokang), sweet potato (chemutii), giant swamp taro (brak), banana, calamondin (kingkang), breadfruits, ysaol, amra tree (titimel), Eugenia plant (chedebsachel), wax apple (rebotel), betelnut tree and pepper leaf (kebui). Ngaraard has a rich soil and plenty of crops but only a few vegetables.\n\n==Villages==\nThe inhabited villages of Ngaraard State include the following (from north to south):\n[[Choll]],\n[[Elab]],\n[[Ulimang]],\n[[Ngebuked]], and\n[[Ngkeklau]].\n\nThere are many important places in the State of Ngaraard.  There are the traditional village sites of Elab, Chetoilechang, Diong er Ngerchokl, Bai ra Ngaruau, Chelsel a Beluu er Ngebuked, Diong era Imeduurang, Ulimang. Ulimang is said to be the child of god Chuab.  Other important places include: Head Start, the elementary school and Bethania High School, a hospital, Bai ra Rubak, the Ngaraard State Office at Koror, Bem Yore and the stores.\n\nThe lifestyle of Ngaraard has changed a lot due to the introduction of [[technology|modern technology]], including [[personal computer|computers]], [[telephone]]s, [[electricity]] and [[televisions]]. Due to the construction of roads, the majority of people in the state now use [[car]]s for transportation rather than [[boat]]s. However boats are still used for [[fishing]].\n\n==Population and geography==\nThe population of Ngaraard has changed considerably over the years. In 1990, its population was 440 and in 1996, it decreased to 360. In 2000, it had increased to 638. The Office of Statistics under the [[Ministry of Finance]] has not yet determined the total population for 2004.\n\nNgaraard has a [[tropical climate]]. The temperature ranges from a high of 83\u02d9F to a low of 81\u02d9F.  Rainfall takes place from May to January and the heaviest rain is in June and July. The climate is dry from February until April.\n\n==Flag==\nNgaraard recently changed its flag. It is made of a golden-yellow star on a field of deep sky blue.  Behind the star, it has a red stripe from the bottom left corner to the upper right corner of the flag.  The star stands for the unity of Ngaraard State, and the five fingers of the star stand for the five counties or hamlets of Ngaraard.  The stripe of the flag shows that the state has both the east and west coast of northern Babeldaob and is striving for success.  The blue background symbolizes the blue of the sky and ocean surrounding the Ngaraard State.\n\n== Education==\nThe [[Ministry of Education (Palau)|Ministry of Education]] operates public schools.\n\nNgaraard Elementary School was established after [[World War II]], circa 1947, using a school building opened during the Japanese [[South Pacific Mandate]] rule. In addition to Ngaraard, it served [[Kayangel]], [[Ngarchelong]], and [[Ngiwal]].<ref>\"[http://www.palaumoe.net/ngaraard/ Ngaraard Elementary School].\" Ministry of Education (Palau).

The shallow stations comprise 79 [[Shallow column station|spanned column]] stations (a large portion of them following the \"centipede\" design), 33 [[Shallow single-vault station|single-vaulted stations]] (Kharkov technology), and three single-spanned stations. In addition, there are 12 ground-level stations, four elevated stations, and one station ([[Vorobyovy Gory (Moscow Metro)|Vorobyovy Gory]]) on a bridge. Two stations have three tracks, and one has double halls. Seven of the stations have side platforms (only one of which is subterranean). In addition, there were two temporary stations within rail yards. One station is reserved for future service ([[Delovoy Tsentr (Kalininsko\u2013Solntsevskaya line)|Delovoy Tsentr]] for the [[Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya line]]).\n\nThe stations being constructed under [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] [[Stalinism|regime]], in the style of [[socialist classicism]], were meant as underground \"palaces of the people\". Stations such as [[Komsomolskaya (Koltsevaya line)|Komsomolskaya]], [[Kiyevskaya (Koltsevaya line)|Kiyevskaya]] or [[Mayakovskaya]] and others built after 1935 in the second phase of the evolution of the network are tourist landmarks, their photogenic architecture, large chandeliers and detailed decoration unusual for an urban transport system.\n\n{{wide image|\u041f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e \u041a\u0421\u041b \u041c\u0438\u0447\u0443\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442.jpg|700px|align-cap=center|[[Michurinsky Prospekt]] is the first semi-underground station in the Moscow Metro}}\n\n===Lines===\n[[File:Moscow metro tunnels - view from cab of Synergy train.webm|thumbtime=5:47|thumb|A Moscow Metro train passes through [[Sokolnicheskaya line|Sokolnicheskaya]] and [[Koltsevaya Line|Koltsevaya]] lines.

In 1923, the Moscow City Council formed the Underground Railway Design Office at the Moscow Board of Urban Railways. It carried out preliminary studies, and by 1928 had developed a project for the first route from Sokolniki to the city centre. At the same time, an offer was made to the German company Siemens Bauunion to submit its own project for the same route. In June 1931, the decision to begin construction of the Moscow Metro was made by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. In January 1932 the plan for the first lines was approved, and on 21 March 1933 the Soviet government approved a plan for 10 lines with a total route length of {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe first lines were built using the Moscow general plan designed by [[Lazar Kaganovich]], along with his project managers (notably Ivan M. Kuznetsov and, later, Isaac Y. Segal) in the 1930s-1950s, and the Metro was named after him until 1955 ''({{lang|ru-Latn|Metropoliten im. L.M.

In March 1938, the Arbatskaya branch was split and extended to the [[Kurskaya-Radialnaya|Kurskaya]] station (now the dark-blue [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]]). In September 1938, the [[Zamoskvoretskaya Line|Gorkovskaya Line]] opened between [[Sokol (Metro)|Sokol]] and [[Teatralnaya (Moscow Metro)|Teatralnaya]]. Here the architecture was based on that of the most popular stations in existence (Krasniye Vorota, Okhotnyi Ryad and Kropotkinskaya); while following the popular art-deco style, it was merged with socialist themes. The first [[Deep column station|deep-level column station]] [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya]] was built at the same time.\n\nBuilding work on the third stage was delayed (but not interrupted) during [[World War II]], and two Metro sections were put into service; [[Teatralnaya (Moscow Metro)|Teatralnaya]]\u2013[[Avtozavodskaya (Zamoskvoretskaya Line)|Avtozavodskaya]] (three stations, crossing the Moskva River through a deep tunnel) and [[Kurskaya-Radialnaya|Kurskaya]]\u2013[[Partizanskaya (Metro)|Partizanskaya]] (four stations) were inaugurated in 1943 and 1944 respectively. War motifs replaced socialist visions in the architectural design of these stations. During the [[Battle of Moscow|Siege of Moscow]] in the fall and winter of 1941, Metro stations were used as air-raid shelters; the [[Council of Ministers of the USSR|Council of Ministers]] moved its offices to the [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya]] platforms, where Stalin made public speeches on several occasions. The [[Chistye Prudy (Metro)|Chistiye Prudy]] station was also walled off, and the headquarters of the Air Defence established there.\n\nAfter the war ended in 1945, construction began on the fourth stage of the Metro, which included the [[Koltsevaya Line]], a deep part of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line from [[Ploshchad Revolyutsii]] to [[Kievskaya (Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya)|Kievskaya]] and a surface extension to [[Pervomaiskaya (closed)|Pervomaiskaya]] during the early 1950s. The decoration and design characteristic of the Moscow Metro is considered to have reached its zenith in these stations. The [[Koltsevaya Line]] was first planned as a line running under the [[Garden Ring]], a wide avenue encircling the borders of Moscow's city centre. The first part of the line \u2013 from [[Park Kultury (Koltsevaya Line)|Park Kultury]] to [[Kurskaya (Koltsevaya Line)|Kurskaya]] (1950) \u2013 follows this avenue. Plans were later changed and the northern part of the ring line runs {{convert|1|-|1.5|km}} outside the Sadovoye Koltso, thus providing service for seven (out of nine) rail terminals. The next part of the Koltsevaya Line opened in 1952 (Kurskaya\u2013[[Belorusskaya-Koltsevaya|Belorusskaya]]), and in 1954 the ring line was completed.\n\n===Cold War era===\n[[File:Novoslobodskaya 04.jpg|thumb|left|Novoslobodskaya station]]\n[[File:MosMetro KomsomolskayaKL img2 asv2018-01.jpg|thumb| [[Komsomolskaya (Koltsevaya Line)|Komsomolskaya station]]]]\n[[File:Metro MSK Line2 Sokol.jpg|thumb|[[Sokol (Metro)|Sokol station]]]]\nThe beginning of the [[Cold War]] led to the construction of a deep section of the [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]]. The stations on this line were planned as shelters in the event of nuclear war. After finishing the line in 1953 the upper tracks between [[Ploshchad Revolyutsii]] and [[Kiyevskaya (Filyovskaya)|Kiyevskaya]] were closed, and later reopened in 1958 as a part of the [[Filyovskaya Line]]. In the further development of the Metro the term \"stages\" was not used any more, although sometimes the stations opened in 1957\u20131959 are referred to as the \"fifth stage\".\n\nOther stations, too, were supplied with tight gates and life-sustenance systems to function as nuclear shelters.\n\nDuring the late 1950s the architectural extravagance of new Metro stations was toned down, and decorations at some stations (such as [[VDNKh (Metro)|VDNKh]] and [[Alexeyevskaya (Metro)|Alexeyevskaya]]) were simplified by comparison with the original plans. This was done on the orders of [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who favoured more spartan decoration. A typical layout (which quickly became known as ''Sorokonozhka''\u2013\"centipede\", from early designs with 40 concrete columns in two rows) was developed for all new stations and the stations were built to look almost identical, differing from each other only in colours of the marble and ceramic tiles. Most stations were built with simpler, less-costly technology; this was not always appropriate, and resulted in utilitarian design. For example, walls with cheap ceramic tiles were susceptible to train vibration and some tiles eventually fell off. It was not always possible to replace the missing tiles with the ones of the same color, which eventually led to [[:wikt:variegated|variegated]] parts of the walls. Not until the mid-1970s was the architectural extravagance restored and original designs again popular. However, the newer design of \"centipede\" stations (with 26 columns, more widely spaced) continued to dominate.\n\n===Stalinist ideals===\n{{see also|Stalinist architecture}}\n\n====Publicizing the metro====\nThe Moscow Metro was one of the USSR's most ambitious architectural projects. The metro's artists and architects worked to design a structure that embodied ''svet'' (radiance or brilliance) and ''svetloe budushchee'' (a radiant future).<ref name=\"Cooke 1997 137\u2013160\">{{cite journal |last=Cooke |first=Catherine |title=Beauty as a Route to 'the Radiant Future': Responses of Soviet Architecture |journal=Journal of Design History |year=1997 |volume=10 |series=Design, Stalin and the Thaw |issue=2 |pages=137\u2013160 |jstor=1316129 |doi=10.1093/jdh/10.2.137}}</ref> With their reflective marble walls, high ceilings and grand chandeliers, many Moscow Metro stations have been likened to an \"artificial underground sun\".<ref name=\"Bowlt 2002 34\u201363\">{{cite journal |last=Bowlt |first=John E. |title=Stalin as Isis and Ra: Socialist Realism and the Art of Design |journal=The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts |year=2002 |volume=24 |series=Design, Culture, Identity: The Wolfsonian Collection |pages=34\u201363 |jstor=1504182 |doi=10.2307/1504182}}</ref> This palatial underground environment<ref name=\"Bowlt 2002 34\u201363\"/> reminded riders that their tax rubles had been well spent on ''svetloe budushchee''.\n\nThe chief lighting engineer was Abram Damsky, a graduate of the Higher State Art-Technical Institute in Moscow. By 1930 he was a chief designer in Moscow's Elektrosvet Factory, and during World War II was sent to the ''Metrostroi'' (Metro Construction) Factory as head of the lighting shop.<ref name=\"Damsky 1987 90\u2013111\">{{cite journal |last=Damsky |first=Abram |title=Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950 |journal=The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts |date=Summer 1987 |volume=5 |issue=Russian/Soviet Theme |pages=90\u2013111 |jstor=1503938 |doi=10.2307/1503938}}</ref> Damsky recognized the importance of efficiency, as well as the potential for light as an expressive form. His team experimented with different materials (most often cast bronze, aluminum, sheet brass, steel, and milk glass) and methods to optimize the technology.<ref name=\"Damsky 1987 90\u2013111\"/> Damsky's discourse on \"Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950\" describes in detail the epic chandeliers installed in the Kaluzhskaia (now called the Oktiabrskaia) Station and the Taganskaia Station:\n\n{{quote|The Kaluzhskaya Station was designed by the architect [Leonid] Poliakov. Poliakov's decision to base his design on a reinterpretation of Russian classical architecture clearly influenced the concept of the lamps, some of which I planned in collaboration with the architect himself. The shape of the lamps was a torch \u2013 the torch of victory, as Poliakov put it... The artistic quality and stylistic unity of all the lamps throughout the station's interior made them perhaps the most successful element of the architectural composition. All were made of cast aluminum decorated in a black and gold anodized coating, a technique which the Metrostroi factory had only just mastered.\n<br /> \nThe Taganskaia Metro Station on the Ring Line was designed in...quite another style by the architects K.S. Ryzhkov and A. Medvedev... Their subject matter dealt with images of war and victory...The overall effect was one of ceremony ... In the platform halls the blue ceramic bodies of the chandeliers played a more modest role, but still emphasised the overall expressiveness of the lamp.<ref name=\"Damsky 1987 90\u2013111\"/>|Abram Damsky|Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950}}\n\nThe work of Abram Damsky further publicized these ideas hoping people would associate the party with ''svetloe budushchee''.\n\n====Industrialization====\nStalin's [[first five-year plan]] (1928\u20131932) facilitated rapid industrialization to build a socialist motherland. The plan was ambitious, seeking to reorient an agrarian society towards industrialism. It was Stalin's fanatical energy, large-scale planning, and smart resource distribution that kept up the incredible pace of industrialization. The first five-year plan was instrumental in the completion of the Moscow Metro; without industrialization, the Soviet Union would not have had the raw materials necessary for the project. For example, steel was a main component of many subway stations. Before industrialization, it would have been impossible for the Soviet Union to produce enough [[steel]] to incorporate it into the metro's design; in addition, a steel shortage would have limited the size of the subway system and its technological advancement.\n\nThe Moscow Metro furthered the construction of a socialist Soviet Union because the project accorded with Stalin's [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union#Second Plan, 1933\u20131937|second five-year plan]]. The Second Plan focused on urbanization and the development of social services. The Moscow Metro was necessary to cope with the influx of peasants who migrated to the city during the 1930s; Moscow's population had grown from 2.16 million in 1928 to 3.6 million in 1933.  The Metro also bolstered Moscow's shaky infrastructure and its communal services, which hitherto were nearly nonexistent.<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\">{{cite journal |last=Jenks |first=Andrew |title=A Metro on the Mount: The Underground as a Church of Soviet Civilization |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 2000 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=697\u2013724 |jstor=2517594 |doi=10.1353/tech.2000.0160}}</ref>\n\n====Mobilization====\nThe [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] had the power to mobilize; because the party was a single source of control, it could focus its resources and inspire its people. The most notable example of mobilization in the Soviet Union occurred during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]]. The country also mobilized in order to complete the Moscow Metro with unprecedented speed. One of the main motivation factors of the mobilization was to overtake the West and prove that a socialist metro could surpass capitalist designs. It was especially important to the Soviet Union that socialism succeed industrially, technologically, and artistically in the 1930s, since capitalism was at a low ebb during the Great Depression.\n\nThe person in charge of Metro mobilization was [[Lazar Kaganovich]]. A prominent Party member, he assumed control of the project as chief overseer. Kaganovich was nicknamed the \"Iron Commissar\"; he shared Stalin's fanatical energy, dramatic oratory flare, and ability to keep workers building quickly with threats and punishment.<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\"/> He was determined to realise the Moscow Metro, regardless of cost. Without Kaganovich's managerial ability, the Moscow Metro might have met the same fate as the [[Palace of the soviets|Palace of the Soviets]]: failure.\n\nThis was a comprehensive mobilization; the project drew resources and workers from the entire Soviet Union. In his article, archeologist Mike O'Mahoney describes the scope of the Metro mobilization:\n\n{{quote|A specialist workforce had been drawn from many different regions, including miners from the Ukrainian and Siberian coalfields and construction workers from the iron and steel mills of Magnitogorsk, the Dniepr hydroelectric power station, and the Turkestan-Siberian railway... materials used in the construction of the metro included iron from Siberian Kuznetsk, timber from northern Russia, cement from the Volga region and the norther Caucasus, bitumen from Baku, and marble and granite from quarries in Karelia, the Crimea, the Caucasus, the Urals, and the Soviet Far East<ref>{{cite journal |last=O'Mahoney |first=Mike |title=Archaeological Fantasies: Constructing History on the Moscow Metro |journal=The Modern Language Review |date=January 2003 |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=138\u2013150 |jstor=3738180 |doi=10.2307/3738180}}</ref>|Mike O'Mahoney|Archeological Fantasies: Constructing History on the Moscow Metro}}\n\nSkilled engineers were scarce, and unskilled workers were instrumental to the realization of the metro. The ''Metrostroi'' (the organization responsible for the Metro's construction) conducted massive recruitment campaigns. It printed 15,000 copies of ''Udarnik metrostroia'' (''Metrostroi Shock Worker'', its daily newspaper) and 700 other newsletters (some in different languages) to attract unskilled laborers. Kaganovich was closely involved in the recruitment campaign, targeting the [[Komsomol]] generation because of its strength and youth.\n\n====Patriotic influences====\nWhen the Metro opened in 1935 it immediately became the centrepiece of the transportation system. More than that, it was a Stalinist device to awe and control the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art. It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies. Kaganovich was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilization as they rode. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and physical prowess on the powerful new \"[[Homo Sovieticus]]\" (Soviet man).<ref>Isabel W\u00fcnsche, \"Homo Sovieticus: The Athletic Motif in the Design of the Dynamo Metro Station,\" ''Studies in the Decorative Arts'' (2000) 7#2 pp 65-90</ref> The metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order\u2014a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity.<ref>Andrew Jenks, \"A Metro on the Mount,\" ''Technology & Culture'' (2000) 41#4 pp 697-723p</ref>\n\nThe Metro was iconic also because it showcased [[Socialist realism|Socialist Realism]] in public art. Socialist Realism was in fact a method, not a style.<ref name=\"Cooke 1997 137\u2013160\"/> This method was influenced by [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] favorite 19th-century [[Nihilist movement|nihilist]], who stated that \"art is no use unless it serves politics\".<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\"/> This maxim explains why the stations combined aesthetics, technology and ideology. Any plan which did not incorporate all three areas cohesively was rejected. Without this cohesion, the Metro would not reflect Socialist Realism. If the Metro did not utilize Socialist Realism, it would fail to illustrate Stalinist values and transform Soviet citizens into socialists. Anything less than Socialist Realism's grand artistic complexity would fail to inspire a long-lasting, nationalistic attachment to Stalin's new society.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Voyce |first=Arthur |title=Soviet Art and Architecture: Recent Developments |journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |date=January 1956 |volume=303 |series=Russia Since Stalin: Old Trends and New Problems |pages=104\u2013115 |jstor=1032295 |doi=10.1177/000271625630300110}}</ref>\n\n===Moscow Central Circle urban railway (Line 14)===\n{{main|Moscow Central Circle}}\n[[File:MCC 12LUZH 7041 PLAT.jpg|thumb|alt=Large, light outdoor station|[[Luzhniki (Moscow Central Circle)|Luzhniki]] MCC station]]\nA proposal to convert the [[Little Ring of the Moscow Railway]] into a [[Urban rail transit|metropolitan railway]] with frequent passenger service was announced in 2012.

Effective February 2017, one ride costs 55 rubles (approx. 1 US dollar). Discounts (up to 33 percent) are available when buying a multiple-trip ticket (starting with twenty-trip cards), and children under age seven can travel free with their parents.\n\nTickets are available for a fixed number of trips, regardless of distance traveled or number of transfers. Monthly and yearly passes are also available. Fare enforcement takes place at the points of entry. Once a passenger has entered the Metro system, there are no further ticket checks \u2013 one can ride to any number of stations and make transfers within the system freely. Transfers to other public-transport systems (such as bus, tram, trolleybus) are not covered by the ticket. Transfer to monorail is free within 90 minutes.\n\nBefore 1991, turnstiles accepted coins; however, with the start of [[hyperinflation]] plastic tokens of various design were used. Disposable [[magnetic stripe card]]s were introduced in 1993 on a trial basis, and used as unlimited monthly tickets between 1996 and 1998. The sale of tokens ended on 1 January 1999, and they stopped being accepted in February 1999; from that time, magnetic cards were used as tickets with a fixed number of trips.\n\nOn 1 September 1998, the Moscow Metro became the first metro system in Europe to fully implement contactless [[smart cards]], known as Transport Cards. The card has an unlimited number of trips and may be programmed for 30, 90 or 365 days. The first purchase includes a one-time cost of 50 rubles, and its active lifetime is projected as 3\u00bd years; defective cards are exchanged at no cost. Unlimited cards are also available for students at reduced price (as of 2017, 365 rubles\u2014or about $US6\u2014for a calendar month of unlimited usage) for a one-time cost of 70 rubles. Transport Cards impose a delay for each consecutive use; i.e. the card can not be used for seven minutes after the user has passed through the turnstile.\n\nIn January 2007, Moscow Metro began replacing magnetic cards with [[Smart card#Contactless smart cards|contactless]] disposable tickets based on [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP's]] [[MIFARE|MIFARE Ultralight]] technology. Ultralight tickets are available for a fixed number of trips in 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 60-trip denominations (valid for 5 or 90 days from the day of purchase) and as a monthly ticket, only valid for a selected calendar month and limited to 70 trips. The sale of magnetic cards stopped 16 January 2008 and magnetic cards stopped being accepted in late 2008, making the Moscow metro the world's first major public-transport system to run exclusively on a contactless automatic fare-collection system.<ref name=mifareinmoscow>{{cite web |url=http://www.nxp.com/news/content/file_1518.html |title=Moscow Metro: the World's First Major Transport System to operate fully contactless with NXP's MIFARE Technology |publisher=[[NXP Semiconductors]] |accessdate=26 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2004, the [[Government of Moscow|city government]] launched the Muscovite's Social Card program. Social Cards are free smart cards issued for the elderly and other groups of citizens officially registered as residents of Moscow or the [[Moscow region]]; they offer discounts in shops and pharmacies, and double as credit cards issued by the [[Bank of Moscow]]. Social Cards can be used for unlimited free access to the city's public-transport system, including the Moscow Metro; while they do not feature the time delay, they include a photograph and are non-transferable.\n\nSince 2006, [[Banking in Russia|several banks]] have issued [[credit card]]s which double as Ultralight cards and are accepted at turnstiles. The fare is passed to the bank and the payment is withdrawn from the owner's bank account at the end of the calendar month, using a discount rate based on the number of trips that month (for up to 70 trips, the cost of each trip is prorated from current Ultralight rates; each additional trip costs 24.14 rubles).<ref name=rates_2010/> Partner banks include the [[Bank of Moscow]], [[CitiBank]], [[Rosbank]], [[Alfa-Bank]] and [[Avangard Bank]].<ref name=creditcards>{{cite web |url=http://old.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=779 |title=\u0411\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430 |publisher=Moscow metro |accessdate=20 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727014525/http://old.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=779 |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 2 April 2013 Moscow Transport Department introduced a smart card based transport electronic wallet called ''Troika''.

Major projects include:\n*[[Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya Line]]: The construction is now underway of the line's fifth stage, that will add six stations and {{convert|9.5|km|abbr=on}} of track bringing the northern terminus to [[Beskudnikovsky District]]. The extension will involve building of a new train yard in Likhobory. Afterwards, the line may continue northwards, likely into the [[Severny District, Moscow|Severny District]] beyond the [[MKAD]] and potentially into the adjacent city of [[Dolgoprudny]] after 2025.\n*Light Metro lines: Originally developed as a way of reducing costs by building an elevated Metro line to distant regions of Moscow, the only one of these (the [[Butovskaya Line]]) has been the subject of criticism. The project of Solntsevskaya Light Metro Line was cancelled in favour of the underground Solntsevskaya Metro Line (see below). The line 12 southwards extension is planned to include three stations (also {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} in length) and new depot. All the listed light-metro work has been removed from Moscow Metro's expansion programme until 2015.\n*[[Solntsevskaya Line]]: Following cancellation of the second \"Light Metro\" line, an old project was revived to bring the Metro to the [[Solntsevo District]] outside Moscow. Initially foreseen as part of a major Solntsevo-Mytischinskaya chordial line, it was revised as a continuation of [[Kalininskaya Line]], starting from the second set of tracks at [[Park Pobedy (Moscow Metro)|Park Pobedy]] and having the line curve out along Michurin Avenue with three stations: Minskaya, Lomonosovsky Prospekt and Ramenki. This is planned for 2015, and would be the first stage of the line; the second stage would reach Solntsevo. The [[Kalininskaya Line]] is planned for extension from Tretyakovskaya to [[Ostozhenka]], Kadashevskaya and [[Smolenskaya (Filyovskaya Line)|Smolenskaya]] (where it will unite nearby stations into one transfer unit) and continue westwards towards [[Delovoy Tsentr (Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya Line)|Delovoy Tsentr]].\n*Ghost stations: Moscow Metro does not have [[ghost station]]s in the conventional sense; of the three stations that were closed, two&nbsp;\u2014 [[Pervomayskaya (closed)|Pervomayskaya]] (1954\u201361) and [[Kaluzhskaya (closed)|Kaluzhskaya]] (1964\u201374)&nbsp;\u2014 were temporary; one (Leninskiye Gory) was built on a bridge closed due to faulty construction; it was rebuilt and opened in 2002 as [[Vorobyovy Gory (Moscow Metro)|Vorobyovy Gory]]. Several planned stations were omitted; some were later completed, but some exist only on paper. The best-known was [[Spartak (Moscow Metro)|Spartak]], which was left unfinished in 1975 due to low ridership potential and only opened in 2014. Other stations which may open are [[Khmelnitskaya]] (also known as Maroseyka) on the [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]], which will offer a transfer to [[Kitay-gorod (Moscow Metro)|Kitay-gorod]]; Yakimanka on the [[Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line]] (transfer to [[Polyanka (Moscow Metro)|Polyanka]]); and [[Suvorovskaya]] on the [[Koltsevaya Line]], which was to be built with [[Dostoyevskaya (Moscow Metro)|Dostoyevskaya]] but has since been postponed.\n\nAccording to plans by the [[Government of Moscow|Moscow city government]] and [[Ministry of Transport (Russia)|Russia's Transport Ministry]] (announced in September 2008), by 2015 {{convert|79|km}} of new lines, 43 new underground stations and 7 metro depots should be added to the system.\n\n==={{anchor|Distant projects}}Future proposals===\nPlans exist for the following projects:\n*Chordal Lines: Projects for these appeared in the mid-1980s; they called for conventional radial lines but instead of passing through the city centre within the [[Koltsevaya Line]], they would bypass them on the outside.<ref>[http://www.metro.ru/map/1989/metro.ru-1989map-big3.gif Map in Russian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003020857/http://www.metro.ru/map/1989/metro.ru-1989map-big3.gif |date=3 October 2008 }} Retrieved 28 September 2011.</ref> After four of these are completed, they will be used to form the new Second Ring service (see below). Construction began only on the [[Strogino-Mitino extension|Mitino-Butovskaya Line]] during the early 1980s. In the wake of the 1990s crises these projects were abandoned, replaced by more cost-effective means (including the Light Metro lines) and using existent segments. However (despite the Mitino-Butovo chord replacement), the Solntsevsky radius of the Solntsevo-Mytishchinskaya line has been regenerated in its original path. It is unknown whether it would cross all the northern radii before travelling to the adjacent city of [[Mytishchi]] along the Yaroslav Highway, since there is now a fast connection to Mytishchi via the Sputnik rail link from the [[Yaroslavsky Rail Terminal]] and a new plan to build a line from [[Delovoy Tsentr (Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya Line)|Delovoy Tsentr]] to [[Moscow Savyolovsky railway station|Savyolovskaya]] would effectively duplicate the path. The fates of the Balashikha-Troparevskaya (southwest bypass) and the Khimsko-Lyuberetskaya (northeast bypass) chordal lines are unknown.\n*Second (large) Ring: This plan for a second ring line dates back to the 1960s.\n**The original 1960s project called for a ring of 3\u20136 stations on the radius; several provisions for the future line were built (including transfer space at [[Bratislavskaya (Moscow Metro)|Bratislavskaya]]), the [[Kakhovskaya Line]] and the [[Cherkizovskaya]]\u2013[[Bulvar Rokossovskogo (Sokolnicheskaya Line)|Ulitsa Podbelskogo]] section of the [[Sokolnicheskaya Line]] (allowing it to expand westwards into Izmaylovo).<ref>http://metro.molot.ru/img/genplan_71.gif</ref>\n**During the 1980s chordal line proposals the ring was to be formed out of the space enclosed by it, with a circular service operating at off-peak hours.<ref>[http://www.metro.ru/map/1989/metro.ru-1989map-big3.gif] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302210610/http://www.metro.ru/map/1989/metro.ru-1989map-big3.gif|date=2 March 2010}}</ref>\n**In 2006 Moscow Metro announced plans for a second transfer contour, which would build a line from [[Delovoy Tsentr (Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya Line)|Delovoy Tsentr]] to [[Moscow Savyolovsky railway station|Savyolovskaya]] on a large diameter; this would in the future become enclosed into a ring, one to three stations along the radius.\n\n==Metro 2==\n{{Main|Metro-2}}\n\nIt has been alleged that a second and deeper metro system code-named \"D-6\",<ref>{{cite web |title=Moscow Metro 2 \u2013 The dark legend of Moscow |url=http://www.moscow-russia-insiders-guide.com/moscow-metro-2.html |publisher=Moscow Russia Insider's Guide}}</ref> designed for emergency evacuation of key city personnel in case of nuclear attack during the [[Cold War]], exists under military jurisdiction. It is believed that it consists of a single track connecting the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], chief HQ ([[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|General Staff]]\u2013''Genshtab''), Lubyanka ([[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|FSB]] Headquarters), the Ministry of Defence and several other secret installations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} There are alleged to be entrances to the system from several civilian buildings, such as the [[Russian State Library]], [[Moscow State University]] (MSU) and at least two stations of the regular Metro. It is speculated that these would allow for the evacuation of a small number of randomly chosen civilians, in addition to most of the elite military personnel. A suspected junction between the secret system and the regular Metro is supposedly behind the [[Sportivnaya (Moscow Metro)|Sportivnaya]] station on the [[Sokolnicheskaya Line]]. The final section of this system was supposedly completed in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://metro.ru/metro2/ |title=\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e-2 |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n{{Update section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Moscow MetroCrowded (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|Moscow Metro is [[Metro systems by annual passenger rides|one of the busiest metro systems in the world]].]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border: solid 1px #ddd; text-align: left;\"\n|-\n!

In 1923, the Moscow City Council formed the Underground Railway Design Office at the Moscow Board of Urban Railways. It carried out preliminary studies, and by 1928 had developed a project for the first route from Sokolniki to the city centre. At the same time, an offer was made to the German company Siemens Bauunion to submit its own project for the same route. In June 1931, the decision to begin construction of the Moscow Metro was made by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. In January 1932 the plan for the first lines was approved, and on 21 March 1933 the Soviet government approved a plan for 10 lines with a total route length of {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe first lines were built using the Moscow general plan designed by [[Lazar Kaganovich]], along with his project managers (notably Ivan M. Kuznetsov and, later, Isaac Y. Segal) in the 1930s-1950s, and the Metro was named after him until 1955 ''({{lang|ru-Latn|Metropoliten im. L.M.

In March 1938, the Arbatskaya branch was split and extended to the [[Kurskaya-Radialnaya|Kurskaya]] station (now the dark-blue [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]]). In September 1938, the [[Zamoskvoretskaya Line|Gorkovskaya Line]] opened between [[Sokol (Metro)|Sokol]] and [[Teatralnaya (Moscow Metro)|Teatralnaya]]. Here the architecture was based on that of the most popular stations in existence (Krasniye Vorota, Okhotnyi Ryad and Kropotkinskaya); while following the popular art-deco style, it was merged with socialist themes. The first [[Deep column station|deep-level column station]] [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya]] was built at the same time.\n\nBuilding work on the third stage was delayed (but not interrupted) during [[World War II]], and two Metro sections were put into service; [[Teatralnaya (Moscow Metro)|Teatralnaya]]\u2013[[Avtozavodskaya (Zamoskvoretskaya Line)|Avtozavodskaya]] (three stations, crossing the Moskva River through a deep tunnel) and [[Kurskaya-Radialnaya|Kurskaya]]\u2013[[Partizanskaya (Metro)|Partizanskaya]] (four stations) were inaugurated in 1943 and 1944 respectively. War motifs replaced socialist visions in the architectural design of these stations. During the [[Battle of Moscow|Siege of Moscow]] in the fall and winter of 1941, Metro stations were used as air-raid shelters; the [[Council of Ministers of the USSR|Council of Ministers]] moved its offices to the [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya]] platforms, where Stalin made public speeches on several occasions. The [[Chistye Prudy (Metro)|Chistiye Prudy]] station was also walled off, and the headquarters of the Air Defence established there.\n\nAfter the war ended in 1945, construction began on the fourth stage of the Metro, which included the [[Koltsevaya Line]], a deep part of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line from [[Ploshchad Revolyutsii]] to [[Kievskaya (Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya)|Kievskaya]] and a surface extension to [[Pervomaiskaya (closed)|Pervomaiskaya]] during the early 1950s. The decoration and design characteristic of the Moscow Metro is considered to have reached its zenith in these stations. The [[Koltsevaya Line]] was first planned as a line running under the [[Garden Ring]], a wide avenue encircling the borders of Moscow's city centre. The first part of the line \u2013 from [[Park Kultury (Koltsevaya Line)|Park Kultury]] to [[Kurskaya (Koltsevaya Line)|Kurskaya]] (1950) \u2013 follows this avenue. Plans were later changed and the northern part of the ring line runs {{convert|1|-|1.5|km}} outside the Sadovoye Koltso, thus providing service for seven (out of nine) rail terminals. The next part of the Koltsevaya Line opened in 1952 (Kurskaya\u2013[[Belorusskaya-Koltsevaya|Belorusskaya]]), and in 1954 the ring line was completed.\n\n===Cold War era===\n[[File:Novoslobodskaya 04.jpg|thumb|left|Novoslobodskaya station]]\n[[File:MosMetro KomsomolskayaKL img2 asv2018-01.jpg|thumb| [[Komsomolskaya (Koltsevaya Line)|Komsomolskaya station]]]]\n[[File:Metro MSK Line2 Sokol.jpg|thumb|[[Sokol (Metro)|Sokol station]]]]\nThe beginning of the [[Cold War]] led to the construction of a deep section of the [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]]. The stations on this line were planned as shelters in the event of nuclear war. After finishing the line in 1953 the upper tracks between [[Ploshchad Revolyutsii]] and [[Kiyevskaya (Filyovskaya)|Kiyevskaya]] were closed, and later reopened in 1958 as a part of the [[Filyovskaya Line]]. In the further development of the Metro the term \"stages\" was not used any more, although sometimes the stations opened in 1957\u20131959 are referred to as the \"fifth stage\".\n\nOther stations, too, were supplied with tight gates and life-sustenance systems to function as nuclear shelters.\n\nDuring the late 1950s the architectural extravagance of new Metro stations was toned down, and decorations at some stations (such as [[VDNKh (Metro)|VDNKh]] and [[Alexeyevskaya (Metro)|Alexeyevskaya]]) were simplified by comparison with the original plans. This was done on the orders of [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who favoured more spartan decoration. A typical layout (which quickly became known as ''Sorokonozhka''\u2013\"centipede\", from early designs with 40 concrete columns in two rows) was developed for all new stations and the stations were built to look almost identical, differing from each other only in colours of the marble and ceramic tiles. Most stations were built with simpler, less-costly technology; this was not always appropriate, and resulted in utilitarian design. For example, walls with cheap ceramic tiles were susceptible to train vibration and some tiles eventually fell off. It was not always possible to replace the missing tiles with the ones of the same color, which eventually led to [[:wikt:variegated|variegated]] parts of the walls. Not until the mid-1970s was the architectural extravagance restored and original designs again popular. However, the newer design of \"centipede\" stations (with 26 columns, more widely spaced) continued to dominate.\n\n===Stalinist ideals===\n{{see also|Stalinist architecture}}\n\n====Publicizing the metro====\nThe Moscow Metro was one of the USSR's most ambitious architectural projects. The metro's artists and architects worked to design a structure that embodied ''svet'' (radiance or brilliance) and ''svetloe budushchee'' (a radiant future).<ref name=\"Cooke 1997 137\u2013160\">{{cite journal |last=Cooke |first=Catherine |title=Beauty as a Route to 'the Radiant Future': Responses of Soviet Architecture |journal=Journal of Design History |year=1997 |volume=10 |series=Design, Stalin and the Thaw |issue=2 |pages=137\u2013160 |jstor=1316129 |doi=10.1093/jdh/10.2.137}}</ref> With their reflective marble walls, high ceilings and grand chandeliers, many Moscow Metro stations have been likened to an \"artificial underground sun\".<ref name=\"Bowlt 2002 34\u201363\">{{cite journal |last=Bowlt |first=John E. |title=Stalin as Isis and Ra: Socialist Realism and the Art of Design |journal=The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts |year=2002 |volume=24 |series=Design, Culture, Identity: The Wolfsonian Collection |pages=34\u201363 |jstor=1504182 |doi=10.2307/1504182}}</ref> This palatial underground environment<ref name=\"Bowlt 2002 34\u201363\"/> reminded riders that their tax rubles had been well spent on ''svetloe budushchee''.\n\nThe chief lighting engineer was Abram Damsky, a graduate of the Higher State Art-Technical Institute in Moscow. By 1930 he was a chief designer in Moscow's Elektrosvet Factory, and during World War II was sent to the ''Metrostroi'' (Metro Construction) Factory as head of the lighting shop.<ref name=\"Damsky 1987 90\u2013111\">{{cite journal |last=Damsky |first=Abram |title=Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950 |journal=The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts |date=Summer 1987 |volume=5 |issue=Russian/Soviet Theme |pages=90\u2013111 |jstor=1503938 |doi=10.2307/1503938}}</ref> Damsky recognized the importance of efficiency, as well as the potential for light as an expressive form.

Poliakov's decision to base his design on a reinterpretation of Russian classical architecture clearly influenced the concept of the lamps, some of which I planned in collaboration with the architect himself. The shape of the lamps was a torch \u2013 the torch of victory, as Poliakov put it... The artistic quality and stylistic unity of all the lamps throughout the station's interior made them perhaps the most successful element of the architectural composition. All were made of cast aluminum decorated in a black and gold anodized coating, a technique which the Metrostroi factory had only just mastered.\n<br /> \nThe Taganskaia Metro Station on the Ring Line was designed in...quite another style by the architects K.S. Ryzhkov and A. Medvedev... Their subject matter dealt with images of war and victory...The overall effect was one of ceremony ... In the platform halls the blue ceramic bodies of the chandeliers played a more modest role, but still emphasised the overall expressiveness of the lamp.<ref name=\"Damsky 1987 90\u2013111\"/>|Abram Damsky|Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950}}\n\nThe work of Abram Damsky further publicized these ideas hoping people would associate the party with ''svetloe budushchee''.\n\n====Industrialization====\nStalin's [[first five-year plan]] (1928\u20131932) facilitated rapid industrialization to build a socialist motherland. The plan was ambitious, seeking to reorient an agrarian society towards industrialism. It was Stalin's fanatical energy, large-scale planning, and smart resource distribution that kept up the incredible pace of industrialization. The first five-year plan was instrumental in the completion of the Moscow Metro; without industrialization, the Soviet Union would not have had the raw materials necessary for the project. For example, steel was a main component of many subway stations. Before industrialization, it would have been impossible for the Soviet Union to produce enough [[steel]] to incorporate it into the metro's design; in addition, a steel shortage would have limited the size of the subway system and its technological advancement.\n\nThe Moscow Metro furthered the construction of a socialist Soviet Union because the project accorded with Stalin's [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union#Second Plan, 1933\u20131937|second five-year plan]]. The Second Plan focused on urbanization and the development of social services. The Moscow Metro was necessary to cope with the influx of peasants who migrated to the city during the 1930s; Moscow's population had grown from 2.16 million in 1928 to 3.6 million in 1933.  The Metro also bolstered Moscow's shaky infrastructure and its communal services, which hitherto were nearly nonexistent.<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\">{{cite journal |last=Jenks |first=Andrew |title=A Metro on the Mount: The Underground as a Church of Soviet Civilization |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 2000 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=697\u2013724 |jstor=2517594 |doi=10.1353/tech.2000.0160}}</ref>\n\n====Mobilization====\nThe [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] had the power to mobilize; because the party was a single source of control, it could focus its resources and inspire its people. The most notable example of mobilization in the Soviet Union occurred during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]]. The country also mobilized in order to complete the Moscow Metro with unprecedented speed. One of the main motivation factors of the mobilization was to overtake the West and prove that a socialist metro could surpass capitalist designs. It was especially important to the Soviet Union that socialism succeed industrially, technologically, and artistically in the 1930s, since capitalism was at a low ebb during the Great Depression.\n\nThe person in charge of Metro mobilization was [[Lazar Kaganovich]]. A prominent Party member, he assumed control of the project as chief overseer. Kaganovich was nicknamed the \"Iron Commissar\"; he shared Stalin's fanatical energy, dramatic oratory flare, and ability to keep workers building quickly with threats and punishment.<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\"/> He was determined to realise the Moscow Metro, regardless of cost. Without Kaganovich's managerial ability, the Moscow Metro might have met the same fate as the [[Palace of the soviets|Palace of the Soviets]]: failure.\n\nThis was a comprehensive mobilization; the project drew resources and workers from the entire Soviet Union. In his article, archeologist Mike O'Mahoney describes the scope of the Metro mobilization:\n\n{{quote|A specialist workforce had been drawn from many different regions, including miners from the Ukrainian and Siberian coalfields and construction workers from the iron and steel mills of Magnitogorsk, the Dniepr hydroelectric power station, and the Turkestan-Siberian railway... materials used in the construction of the metro included iron from Siberian Kuznetsk, timber from northern Russia, cement from the Volga region and the norther Caucasus, bitumen from Baku, and marble and granite from quarries in Karelia, the Crimea, the Caucasus, the Urals, and the Soviet Far East<ref>{{cite journal |last=O'Mahoney |first=Mike |title=Archaeological Fantasies: Constructing History on the Moscow Metro |journal=The Modern Language Review |date=January 2003 |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=138\u2013150 |jstor=3738180 |doi=10.2307/3738180}}</ref>|Mike O'Mahoney|Archeological Fantasies: Constructing History on the Moscow Metro}}\n\nSkilled engineers were scarce, and unskilled workers were instrumental to the realization of the metro. The ''Metrostroi'' (the organization responsible for the Metro's construction) conducted massive recruitment campaigns. It printed 15,000 copies of ''Udarnik metrostroia'' (''Metrostroi Shock Worker'', its daily newspaper) and 700 other newsletters (some in different languages) to attract unskilled laborers. Kaganovich was closely involved in the recruitment campaign, targeting the [[Komsomol]] generation because of its strength and youth.\n\n====Patriotic influences====\nWhen the Metro opened in 1935 it immediately became the centrepiece of the transportation system. More than that, it was a Stalinist device to awe and control the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art. It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies. Kaganovich was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilization as they rode. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and physical prowess on the powerful new \"[[Homo Sovieticus]]\" (Soviet man).<ref>Isabel W\u00fcnsche, \"Homo Sovieticus: The Athletic Motif in the Design of the Dynamo Metro Station,\" ''Studies in the Decorative Arts'' (2000) 7#2 pp 65-90</ref> The metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order\u2014a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity.<ref>Andrew Jenks, \"A Metro on the Mount,\" ''Technology & Culture'' (2000) 41#4 pp 697-723p</ref>\n\nThe Metro was iconic also because it showcased [[Socialist realism|Socialist Realism]] in public art. Socialist Realism was in fact a method, not a style.<ref name=\"Cooke 1997 137\u2013160\"/> This method was influenced by [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] favorite 19th-century [[Nihilist movement|nihilist]], who stated that \"art is no use unless it serves politics\".<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\"/> This maxim explains why the stations combined aesthetics, technology and ideology. Any plan which did not incorporate all three areas cohesively was rejected. Without this cohesion, the Metro would not reflect Socialist Realism. If the Metro did not utilize Socialist Realism, it would fail to illustrate Stalinist values and transform Soviet citizens into socialists. Anything less than Socialist Realism's grand artistic complexity would fail to inspire a long-lasting, nationalistic attachment to Stalin's new society.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Voyce |first=Arthur |title=Soviet Art and Architecture: Recent Developments |journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |date=January 1956 |volume=303 |series=Russia Since Stalin: Old Trends and New Problems |pages=104\u2013115 |jstor=1032295 |doi=10.1177/000271625630300110}}</ref>\n\n===Moscow Central Circle urban railway (Line 14)===\n{{main|Moscow Central Circle}}\n[[File:MCC 12LUZH 7041 PLAT.jpg|thumb|alt=Large, light outdoor station|[[Luzhniki (Moscow Central Circle)|Luzhniki]] MCC station]]\nA proposal to convert the [[Little Ring of the Moscow Railway]] into a [[Urban rail transit|metropolitan railway]] with frequent passenger service was announced in 2012.

There is no accurate information about the author of the logo, so it is often attributed to the architects of the first stations \u2013 Samuil Kravets, Ivan Taranov and Nadezhda Bykova. It is noteworthy, however, that even at the opening in 1935, the M letter on the logo had no definite shape.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0423 \u043c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043f\u0430|publisher=ADME|url=http://www.adme.ru/dizajn/u-moskovskogo-metro-net-logotipa-492755/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223000634/http://www.adme.ru/dizajn/u-moskovskogo-metro-net-logotipa-492755|archivedate=23 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nToday, with at least ten different variations of the shape in use, Moscow Metro still does not have clear brand or logo guidelines.

The fare has been steadily rising since 1991, hastened by [[inflation]] (taking into account the [[Monetary reform in Russia, 1998|1998 revaluation]] of the [[Russian ruble|ruble]] by a factor of 1,000). Effective February 2017, one ride costs 55 rubles (approx. 1 US dollar). Discounts (up to 33 percent) are available when buying a multiple-trip ticket (starting with twenty-trip cards), and children under age seven can travel free with their parents.\n\nTickets are available for a fixed number of trips, regardless of distance traveled or number of transfers. Monthly and yearly passes are also available. Fare enforcement takes place at the points of entry. Once a passenger has entered the Metro system, there are no further ticket checks \u2013 one can ride to any number of stations and make transfers within the system freely. Transfers to other public-transport systems (such as bus, tram, trolleybus) are not covered by the ticket. Transfer to monorail is free within 90 minutes.\n\nBefore 1991, turnstiles accepted coins; however, with the start of [[hyperinflation]] plastic tokens of various design were used. Disposable [[magnetic stripe card]]s were introduced in 1993 on a trial basis, and used as unlimited monthly tickets between 1996 and 1998. The sale of tokens ended on 1 January 1999, and they stopped being accepted in February 1999; from that time, magnetic cards were used as tickets with a fixed number of trips.\n\nOn 1 September 1998, the Moscow Metro became the first metro system in Europe to fully implement contactless [[smart cards]], known as Transport Cards. The card has an unlimited number of trips and may be programmed for 30, 90 or 365 days. The first purchase includes a one-time cost of 50 rubles, and its active lifetime is projected as 3\u00bd years; defective cards are exchanged at no cost. Unlimited cards are also available for students at reduced price (as of 2017, 365 rubles\u2014or about $US6\u2014for a calendar month of unlimited usage) for a one-time cost of 70 rubles. Transport Cards impose a delay for each consecutive use; i.e. the card can not be used for seven minutes after the user has passed through the turnstile.\n\nIn January 2007, Moscow Metro began replacing magnetic cards with [[Smart card#Contactless smart cards|contactless]] disposable tickets based on [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP's]] [[MIFARE|MIFARE Ultralight]] technology. Ultralight tickets are available for a fixed number of trips in 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 60-trip denominations (valid for 5 or 90 days from the day of purchase) and as a monthly ticket, only valid for a selected calendar month and limited to 70 trips. The sale of magnetic cards stopped 16 January 2008 and magnetic cards stopped being accepted in late 2008, making the Moscow metro the world's first major public-transport system to run exclusively on a contactless automatic fare-collection system.<ref name=mifareinmoscow>{{cite web |url=http://www.nxp.com/news/content/file_1518.html |title=Moscow Metro: the World's First Major Transport System to operate fully contactless with NXP's MIFARE Technology |publisher=[[NXP Semiconductors]] |accessdate=26 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2004, the [[Government of Moscow|city government]] launched the Muscovite's Social Card program. Social Cards are free smart cards issued for the elderly and other groups of citizens officially registered as residents of Moscow or the [[Moscow region]]; they offer discounts in shops and pharmacies, and double as credit cards issued by the [[Bank of Moscow]]. Social Cards can be used for unlimited free access to the city's public-transport system, including the Moscow Metro; while they do not feature the time delay, they include a photograph and are non-transferable.\n\nSince 2006, [[Banking in Russia|several banks]] have issued [[credit card]]s which double as Ultralight cards and are accepted at turnstiles. The fare is passed to the bank and the payment is withdrawn from the owner's bank account at the end of the calendar month, using a discount rate based on the number of trips that month (for up to 70 trips, the cost of each trip is prorated from current Ultralight rates; each additional trip costs 24.14 rubles).<ref name=rates_2010/> Partner banks include the [[Bank of Moscow]], [[CitiBank]], [[Rosbank]], [[Alfa-Bank]] and [[Avangard Bank]].<ref name=creditcards>{{cite web |url=http://old.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=779 |title=\u0411\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430 |publisher=Moscow metro |accessdate=20 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727014525/http://old.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=779 |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 2 April 2013 Moscow Transport Department introduced a smart card based transport electronic wallet called ''Troika''.

Major projects include:\n*[[Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya Line]]: The construction is now underway of the line's fifth stage, that will add six stations and {{convert|9.5|km|abbr=on}} of track bringing the northern terminus to [[Beskudnikovsky District]]. The extension will involve building of a new train yard in Likhobory. Afterwards, the line may continue northwards, likely into the [[Severny District, Moscow|Severny District]] beyond the [[MKAD]] and potentially into the adjacent city of [[Dolgoprudny]] after 2025.\n*Light Metro lines: Originally developed as a way of reducing costs by building an elevated Metro line to distant regions of Moscow, the only one of these (the [[Butovskaya Line]]) has been the subject of criticism. The project of Solntsevskaya Light Metro Line was cancelled in favour of the underground Solntsevskaya Metro Line (see below). The line 12 southwards extension is planned to include three stations (also {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} in length) and new depot. All the listed light-metro work has been removed from Moscow Metro's expansion programme until 2015.\n*[[Solntsevskaya Line]]: Following cancellation of the second \"Light Metro\" line, an old project was revived to bring the Metro to the [[Solntsevo District]] outside Moscow. Initially foreseen as part of a major Solntsevo-Mytischinskaya chordial line, it was revised as a continuation of [[Kalininskaya Line]], starting from the second set of tracks at [[Park Pobedy (Moscow Metro)|Park Pobedy]] and having the line curve out along Michurin Avenue with three stations: Minskaya, Lomonosovsky Prospekt and Ramenki. This is planned for 2015, and would be the first stage of the line; the second stage would reach Solntsevo. The [[Kalininskaya Line]] is planned for extension from Tretyakovskaya to [[Ostozhenka]], Kadashevskaya and [[Smolenskaya (Filyovskaya Line)|Smolenskaya]] (where it will unite nearby stations into one transfer unit) and continue westwards towards [[Delovoy Tsentr (Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya Line)|Delovoy Tsentr]].\n*Ghost stations: Moscow Metro does not have [[ghost station]]s in the conventional sense; of the three stations that were closed, two&nbsp;\u2014 [[Pervomayskaya (closed)|Pervomayskaya]] (1954\u201361) and [[Kaluzhskaya (closed)|Kaluzhskaya]] (1964\u201374)&nbsp;\u2014 were temporary; one (Leninskiye Gory) was built on a bridge closed due to faulty construction; it was rebuilt and opened in 2002 as [[Vorobyovy Gory (Moscow Metro)|Vorobyovy Gory]]. Several planned stations were omitted; some were later completed, but some exist only on paper. The best-known was [[Spartak (Moscow Metro)|Spartak]], which was left unfinished in 1975 due to low ridership potential and only opened in 2014. Other stations which may open are [[Khmelnitskaya]] (also known as Maroseyka) on the [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]], which will offer a transfer to [[Kitay-gorod (Moscow Metro)|Kitay-gorod]]; Yakimanka on the [[Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line]] (transfer to [[Polyanka (Moscow Metro)|Polyanka]]); and [[Suvorovskaya]] on the [[Koltsevaya Line]], which was to be built with [[Dostoyevskaya (Moscow Metro)|Dostoyevskaya]] but has since been postponed.\n\nAccording to plans by the [[Government of Moscow|Moscow city government]] and [[Ministry of Transport (Russia)|Russia's Transport Ministry]] (announced in September 2008), by 2015 {{convert|79|km}} of new lines, 43 new underground stations and 7 metro depots should be added to the system.\n\n==={{anchor|Distant projects}}Future proposals===\nPlans exist for the following projects:\n*Chordal Lines: Projects for these appeared in the mid-1980s; they called for conventional radial lines but instead of passing through the city centre within the [[Koltsevaya Line]], they would bypass them on the outside.<ref>[http://www.metro.ru/map/1989/metro.ru-1989map-big3.gif Map in Russian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003020857/http://www.metro.ru/map/1989/metro.ru-1989map-big3.gif |date=3 October 2008 }} Retrieved 28 September 2011.</ref> After four of these are completed, they will be used to form the new Second Ring service (see below). Construction began only on the [[Strogino-Mitino extension|Mitino-Butovskaya Line]] during the early 1980s. In the wake of the 1990s crises these projects were abandoned, replaced by more cost-effective means (including the Light Metro lines) and using existent segments. However (despite the Mitino-Butovo chord replacement), the Solntsevsky radius of the Solntsevo-Mytishchinskaya line has been regenerated in its original path. It is unknown whether it would cross all the northern radii before travelling to the adjacent city of [[Mytishchi]] along the Yaroslav Highway, since there is now a fast connection to Mytishchi via the Sputnik rail link from the [[Yaroslavsky Rail Terminal]] and a new plan to build a line from [[Delovoy Tsentr (Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya Line)|Delovoy Tsentr]] to [[Moscow Savyolovsky railway station|Savyolovskaya]] would effectively duplicate the path. The fates of the Balashikha-Troparevskaya (southwest bypass) and the Khimsko-Lyuberetskaya (northeast bypass) chordal lines are unknown.\n*Second (large) Ring: This plan for a second ring line dates back to the 1960s.\n**The original 1960s project called for a ring of 3\u20136 stations on the radius; several provisions for the future line were built (including transfer space at [[Bratislavskaya (Moscow Metro)|Bratislavskaya]]), the [[Kakhovskaya Line]] and the [[Cherkizovskaya]]\u2013[[Bulvar Rokossovskogo (Sokolnicheskaya Line)|Ulitsa Podbelskogo]] section of the [[Sokolnicheskaya Line]] (allowing it to expand westwards into Izmaylovo).<ref>http://metro.molot.ru/img/genplan_71.gif</ref>\n**During the 1980s chordal line proposals the ring was to be formed out of the space enclosed by it, with a circular service operating at off-peak hours.<ref>[http://www.metro.ru/map/1989/metro.ru-1989map-big3.gif] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302210610/http://www.metro.ru/map/1989/metro.ru-1989map-big3.gif|date=2 March 2010}}</ref>\n**In 2006 Moscow Metro announced plans for a second transfer contour, which would build a line from [[Delovoy Tsentr (Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya Line)|Delovoy Tsentr]] to [[Moscow Savyolovsky railway station|Savyolovskaya]] on a large diameter; this would in the future become enclosed into a ring, one to three stations along the radius.\n\n==Metro 2==\n{{Main|Metro-2}}\n\nIt has been alleged that a second and deeper metro system code-named \"D-6\",<ref>{{cite web |title=Moscow Metro 2 \u2013 The dark legend of Moscow |url=http://www.moscow-russia-insiders-guide.com/moscow-metro-2.html |publisher=Moscow Russia Insider's Guide}}</ref> designed for emergency evacuation of key city personnel in case of nuclear attack during the [[Cold War]], exists under military jurisdiction. It is believed that it consists of a single track connecting the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], chief HQ ([[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|General Staff]]\u2013''Genshtab''), Lubyanka ([[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|FSB]] Headquarters), the Ministry of Defence and several other secret installations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} There are alleged to be entrances to the system from several civilian buildings, such as the [[Russian State Library]], [[Moscow State University]] (MSU) and at least two stations of the regular Metro. It is speculated that these would allow for the evacuation of a small number of randomly chosen civilians, in addition to most of the elite military personnel. A suspected junction between the secret system and the regular Metro is supposedly behind the [[Sportivnaya (Moscow Metro)|Sportivnaya]] station on the [[Sokolnicheskaya Line]]. The final section of this system was supposedly completed in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://metro.ru/metro2/ |title=\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e-2 |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n{{Update section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Moscow MetroCrowded (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|Moscow Metro is [[Metro systems by annual passenger rides|one of the busiest metro systems in the world]].]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border: solid 1px #ddd; text-align: left;\"\n|-\n!

The land area is about {{convert|1.4|km2|abbr=on}}. The population is 138 ([[census]] of 2000).

The atoll is about {{convert|7.2|km|abbr=on}} north-south, and {{convert|3.7|km|abbr=on}} wide, with a total area of {{convert|20|km2|abbr=on}}, including the lagoon. The [[lagoon]] has an average depth of {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}} and a maximum depth of {{convert|9.6|m|abbr=on}}, and about 25 large pinnacles can be detected from aerial photographs. The bottom of the lagoon is largely sand. On the western side of the atoll, there is a small passage for boats into the lagoon, with a depth of only {{convert|2|to|4|m|ft|0}}, called ''Ulach''. Coral diversity and abundance are low in the lagoon. Large fish, dolphins and foraging sea turtles are common near the pass.\n\nThere are four densely wooded islets on the eastern and southern rim of the oval-shaped atoll, from north to south, are Kayangel, Ngeriungs, Ngerebelas and Orak.\n\n===Kayangel Islet===\n\nKayangel Islet (also called Ngcheangel or Ngajangel), is the largest and only inhabited islet of Kayangel Atoll and Kayangel State. It is {{convert|2570|m|abbr=on}} long north-south, with a width between {{convert|270|m|abbr=on}} in the south and {{convert|700|m|abbr=on}} in the north. The land area is about {{convert|98|ha|abbr=on}}. There are five [[village]]s primarily oriented to the western shore (lagoon side). They stretch over {{convert|1.5|km|abbr=on}} from north to south and are not clearly separated from each other. The villages are very small by any standard, given the aggregate population of only 138. Together, they make up the state [[capital (political)|capital]], Kayangel (''Ngcheangel''). From north to south:\n\n#Orukei\n#Dilong\n#Doko (with {{convert|130|m|abbr=on}} long [[pier]] to the west into the lagoon)\n#Olkang\n#Dimes\n\nThe only power on the island comes from solar panels or personal generators.  There is one small school that goes from K-9th grades and a small library. The only shopping to be done on the island is from a small general store, otherwise it is what the islanders catch in the ocean or grow in the ground. There are several ways to get to the island. One is the island's speedboat that takes about two hours, but it is generally in for repairs. The more reliable modes are from either a local fisherman or a dive company that makes regular trips up to the island to dive off the reefs surrounding the island.\n\n===Ngeriungs Islet===\n\nNgeriungs Islet, about {{convert|820|m|abbr=on}} south of Kayangel Islet, is {{convert|1350|m|abbr=on}} long north-south, and has a width between {{convert|130|m|abbr=on}} in the south and {{convert|380|m|abbr=on}} in the north, which amounts to a land area of {{convert|27|ha|abbr=on}}. There is a small campsite.\n\n===Ngerebelas Islet===\n\nNgerebelas Islet, close to the southern tip of Kayangel atoll, about {{convert|1200|m|abbr=on}} southwest of the southwestern tip of Ngeriungs Islet, has a size of {{convert|400|m|abbr=on}} east-west by {{convert|370|m|abbr=on}} north-south, with a land area of {{convert|12|ha|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Orak Islet===\n\nOrak Islet, at the southern tip of Kayangel atoll, about {{convert|290|m|abbr=on}} southwest of the southwestern end of Ngerebelas Islet, is {{convert|210|m|abbr=on}} long southwest-northeast, and {{convert|90|m|abbr=on}} wide. With an area of {{convert|1.5|ha|abbr=on}}, it is the smallest of the four islets of Kayangel Atoll.\n\n==Ngaruangel Reef==\n\nNgaruangel (Ngaruangl) Reef, located at {{coord|08|10|N|134|38|E|}}, is an incipient atoll, {{convert|8.7|km|abbr=on}} northwest of Kayangel atoll, and separated from it by Ngaruangl Passage, a very deep ({{convert|629|to|786|m}} at {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} from each atoll) and {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}} wide passage. The atoll is {{convert|5.4|km|abbr=on}} long north-south, and from {{convert|1.8|km|abbr=on}} wide in the north to {{convert|3.7|km|abbr=on}} in the south, and about {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} on the average. The total area including the lagoon is {{convert|15|km2|abbr=on}}. The lagoon is shallow, with an average depth of {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}}, has about 115 pinnacle and patch reefs, and a boat passage through the northeastern part of the barrier reef. The lagoon floor is covered with thick sand deposits and thickets of staghorn [[Acropora]]. The reef is protected by Ngaruangel Reserve.\n\n===Ngaruangel Island===\n\nThere is one small, barren and uninhabited islet, Ngaruangel Island, in the center of the eastern rim of the atoll, at its easternmost point. Ngaruangel Island is {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} long north-south, and from {{convert|65|m|abbr=on}} wide in the south to {{convert|105|m|abbr=on}} in the north. There is a sand spit attached to the island, pointing southwest into the lagoon, {{convert|75|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}} wide. The total area of the island is {{convert|1.5|ha|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe islet consists almost entirely of pieces of rough coral rock thrown up by surf. Most of the pieces are rough or sharp and are largely of the Acropora reticulata type, or of similar form. Sand and sandy gravel are limited to the lagoon side and the southern tip. The altitude is a little less than one meter above high tide.\n\nThere is no vegetation on the islet. Animal life is represented by numerous marine [[crane fly|crane flies]]. [[Terns]] are abundant.\n\n==Velasco Reef==\n\nVelasco Reef, located at {{coord|08|20|29|N|134|36|45|E|}} is a sunken atoll north of Ngaruangl Reef, rising steeply from the surrounding seafloor, {{convert|2000|m}} deep. It is not clearly separated from Ngaruangl Reef and appears as its large but submerged northern extension on satellite images. It extends more than {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} to the north, and is up to {{convert|14|km|abbr=on}} wide, giving it an oval shape, covering an area of about {{convert|330|km2|abbr=on}}. Much of the reef is uncharted. The central depression (lagoon) is {{convert|31|to|55|m|abbr=on}} deep, while depths along the rim (outer edges) range from {{convert|11.9|to|22|m|abbr=on}} (generally {{convert|15|to|20|m|abbr=on}}), on which there are overfalls when the tidal currents are strong. Heavy wave exposure limits coral diversity and cover on Velasco Reef.\n\n== Education==\nThe [[Ministry of Education (Palau)|Ministry of Education]] operates public schools.\n\nJFK Kayangel Elementary School was built in 1965; initially students took classes in a [[:wiktionary:bai#Palauan|bai]].

The land area is about {{convert|1.4|km2|abbr=on}}. The population is 138 ([[census]] of 2000). The state consists of three [[atoll]]s in different states of development:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Atoll || Land Area<br>(km<sup>2</sup>) || Total Area<br>(km<sup>2</sup>) || Coordinates\n|-\n| Kayangel || align=\"right\" | 1.39 ||align=\"right\" | 21.6 ||{{coord|08|04|N|134|42|E|}}\n|-\n| Ngaruangel || align=\"right\" | 0.02 ||align=\"right\" | 20.1 ||{{coord|08|10|N|134|38|E|}}\n|-\n| Velasco Reef || align=\"right\" | - ||align=\"right\" | 330 ||{{coord|08|20|29|N|134|36|45|E|}}\n|-style=\"background: #DDDDDD;\"\n| State of Kayangel || align=\"right\" | 1.40 || align=\"right\" | 372 || &nbsp;\n|}\n\n==Kayangel Atoll==\nKayangel Atoll (''Ngcheangel''), the only inhabited atoll of Kayangel State, with most (99 percent) of the land area of Kayangel State, is located at {{coord|08|04|N|134|42|E|}}, about {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Babelthuap]] island, the main island of Palau, but only {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} north of Babelthuap's barrier reef. The atoll is about {{convert|7.2|km|abbr=on}} north-south, and {{convert|3.7|km|abbr=on}} wide, with a total area of {{convert|20|km2|abbr=on}}, including the lagoon. The [[lagoon]] has an average depth of {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}} and a maximum depth of {{convert|9.6|m|abbr=on}}, and about 25 large pinnacles can be detected from aerial photographs. The bottom of the lagoon is largely sand. On the western side of the atoll, there is a small passage for boats into the lagoon, with a depth of only {{convert|2|to|4|m|ft|0}}, called ''Ulach''. Coral diversity and abundance are low in the lagoon. Large fish, dolphins and foraging sea turtles are common near the pass.\n\nThere are four densely wooded islets on the eastern and southern rim of the oval-shaped atoll, from north to south, are Kayangel, Ngeriungs, Ngerebelas and Orak.\n\n===Kayangel Islet===\n\nKayangel Islet (also called Ngcheangel or Ngajangel), is the largest and only inhabited islet of Kayangel Atoll and Kayangel State. It is {{convert|2570|m|abbr=on}} long north-south, with a width between {{convert|270|m|abbr=on}} in the south and {{convert|700|m|abbr=on}} in the north. The land area is about {{convert|98|ha|abbr=on}}. There are five [[village]]s primarily oriented to the western shore (lagoon side). They stretch over {{convert|1.5|km|abbr=on}} from north to south and are not clearly separated from each other. The villages are very small by any standard, given the aggregate population of only 138. Together, they make up the state [[capital (political)|capital]], Kayangel (''Ngcheangel''). From north to south:\n\n#Orukei\n#Dilong\n#Doko (with {{convert|130|m|abbr=on}} long [[pier]] to the west into the lagoon)\n#Olkang\n#Dimes\n\nThe only power on the island comes from solar panels or personal generators.  There is one small school that goes from K-9th grades and a small library. The only shopping to be done on the island is from a small general store, otherwise it is what the islanders catch in the ocean or grow in the ground. There are several ways to get to the island. One is the island's speedboat that takes about two hours, but it is generally in for repairs. The more reliable modes are from either a local fisherman or a dive company that makes regular trips up to the island to dive off the reefs surrounding the island.\n\n===Ngeriungs Islet===\n\nNgeriungs Islet, about {{convert|820|m|abbr=on}} south of Kayangel Islet, is {{convert|1350|m|abbr=on}} long north-south, and has a width between {{convert|130|m|abbr=on}} in the south and {{convert|380|m|abbr=on}} in the north, which amounts to a land area of {{convert|27|ha|abbr=on}}. There is a small campsite.\n\n===Ngerebelas Islet===\n\nNgerebelas Islet, close to the southern tip of Kayangel atoll, about {{convert|1200|m|abbr=on}} southwest of the southwestern tip of Ngeriungs Islet, has a size of {{convert|400|m|abbr=on}} east-west by {{convert|370|m|abbr=on}} north-south, with a land area of {{convert|12|ha|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Orak Islet===\n\nOrak Islet, at the southern tip of Kayangel atoll, about {{convert|290|m|abbr=on}} southwest of the southwestern end of Ngerebelas Islet, is {{convert|210|m|abbr=on}} long southwest-northeast, and {{convert|90|m|abbr=on}} wide. With an area of {{convert|1.5|ha|abbr=on}}, it is the smallest of the four islets of Kayangel Atoll.\n\n==Ngaruangel Reef==\n\nNgaruangel (Ngaruangl) Reef, located at {{coord|08|10|N|134|38|E|}}, is an incipient atoll, {{convert|8.7|km|abbr=on}} northwest of Kayangel atoll, and separated from it by Ngaruangl Passage, a very deep ({{convert|629|to|786|m}} at {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} from each atoll) and {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}} wide passage. The atoll is {{convert|5.4|km|abbr=on}} long north-south, and from {{convert|1.8|km|abbr=on}} wide in the north to {{convert|3.7|km|abbr=on}} in the south, and about {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} on the average. The total area including the lagoon is {{convert|15|km2|abbr=on}}. The lagoon is shallow, with an average depth of {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}}, has about 115 pinnacle and patch reefs, and a boat passage through the northeastern part of the barrier reef. The lagoon floor is covered with thick sand deposits and thickets of staghorn [[Acropora]]. The reef is protected by Ngaruangel Reserve.\n\n===Ngaruangel Island===\n\nThere is one small, barren and uninhabited islet, Ngaruangel Island, in the center of the eastern rim of the atoll, at its easternmost point. Ngaruangel Island is {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} long north-south, and from {{convert|65|m|abbr=on}} wide in the south to {{convert|105|m|abbr=on}} in the north. There is a sand spit attached to the island, pointing southwest into the lagoon, {{convert|75|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}} wide. The total area of the island is {{convert|1.5|ha|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe islet consists almost entirely of pieces of rough coral rock thrown up by surf. Most of the pieces are rough or sharp and are largely of the Acropora reticulata type, or of similar form. Sand and sandy gravel are limited to the lagoon side and the southern tip. The altitude is a little less than one meter above high tide.\n\nThere is no vegetation on the islet. Animal life is represented by numerous marine [[crane fly|crane flies]]. [[Terns]] are abundant.\n\n==Velasco Reef==\n\nVelasco Reef, located at {{coord|08|20|29|N|134|36|45|E|}} is a sunken atoll north of Ngaruangl Reef, rising steeply from the surrounding seafloor, {{convert|2000|m}} deep. It is not clearly separated from Ngaruangl Reef and appears as its large but submerged northern extension on satellite images. It extends more than {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} to the north, and is up to {{convert|14|km|abbr=on}} wide, giving it an oval shape, covering an area of about {{convert|330|km2|abbr=on}}. Much of the reef is uncharted. The central depression (lagoon) is {{convert|31|to|55|m|abbr=on}} deep, while depths along the rim (outer edges) range from {{convert|11.9|to|22|m|abbr=on}} (generally {{convert|15|to|20|m|abbr=on}}), on which there are overfalls when the tidal currents are strong. Heavy wave exposure limits coral diversity and cover on Velasco Reef.\n\n== Education==\nThe [[Ministry of Education (Palau)|Ministry of Education]] operates public schools.\n\nJFK Kayangel Elementary School was built in 1965; initially students took classes in a [[:wiktionary:bai#Palauan|bai]].

Munich: Lincom Europa (2001) (LW/M 385)</ref> Shekhawati, like the Bagri dialect of Ganganagar and Hanumangarh districts, has a parallel lexicon which makes it very rich from the lexicographical point of view.\n[[Word order]] is typically [[Subject\u2013object\u2013verb|SOV]] and there is an existence of [[implosives]]. The presence of high tone at [[suprasegmental]] level classifies it with other [[dialects of Rajasthani]]. It has contributed a lot to the development of Rajasthani language and [[linguistics]].\n\nSome samples in Shekhawati are:\n* Kai Hoyo? \u0915\u0948 \u0939\u094b\u092f\u094b? = What happened?\n* The Kai kar rieya ho? \u0925\u0947  \u0915\u0948 \u0915\u0930 \u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e  \u0939\u094b?= What are you doing?\n* Ma Thane ghano samman desyu. \u092e\u0948\u0902  \u0925\u093e\u0928\u0947  \u0918\u0923\u094b  \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928  \u0926\u0947\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0941   = I will give you great respect.\n* The sidh ja riya ho? \u0925\u0947 \u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927  \u091c\u093e  \u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e  \u0939\u094b?= Where are you going?\n* The ke kha rahiya ho? \u0925\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0916\u093e \u0930\u0939\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0939\u094b? = What are you eating?\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient history===\n{{main|Matsya Kingdom}}\nMany historians have considered this region included in the [[Matsya Kingdom]].

Gardener, who used the word ''Shekhawati'' in 1803. Later [[James Tod]] wrote the first history of Shekhawati. The term ''Shekhawati'' was used frequently in ''Vamsh Bhaskar''. This suggests that the term came in use about two and half centuries ago.<ref name=\"Sahiram 1952\">Sahiram: Ek adh\u016br\u012b kr\u0101nti, Shekhawati k\u0101 kis\u0101n \u0101ndolan (1922-1952), page-1</ref> Shekhawati is named after Rao Shekha.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Shekhawatiregion.jpg|thumb|200px|Shekhawati region of Rajasthan (in blue)]]\n\nShekhawati is in the [[Thar Desert]] of Rajasthan and has special importance in the history of India.\n\nThe climate of the desert region is harsh and extreme. The temperature ranges from below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in winter to more than {{convert|50|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in summer. The summer brings hot waves of air called ''loo''. Annual rainfall is at around 450 to 600&nbsp; mm. The [[groundwater]] is as deep as 200 feet (60 m), and in some places, the groundwater is [[Hard water|hard]] and salty. The people in the region depend on [[rainwater harvesting]]. The harvested rainwater from the monsoon season (during July and August) is stored in [[Indian vernacular architecture#Pukka|pucca]] tanks and used throughout the year for drinking purposes.<ref name=\"Busquet\">Busquet, Carisse and Gerard ''Impressions of Rajasthan'' 2003, Editions Flammarion, {{ISBN|2-08-011171-X}}</ref>\n\n== Shekhawati dialect ==\nShekhawati is a [[dialect]] of the [[Rajasthani language]] and is spoken by about three million speakers in the [[Churu]], [[Jhunjhunu]], and [[Sikar]] districts of Rajasthan. Even though it is a very important dialect from the grammatical and literary points of view, very little work is carried out on it. In 2001 a descriptive compendium of the grammar of Shekhawati was published.<ref>Lakhan Gusain. Shekhawati. Munich: Lincom Europa (2001) (LW/M 385)</ref> Shekhawati, like the Bagri dialect of Ganganagar and Hanumangarh districts, has a parallel lexicon which makes it very rich from the lexicographical point of view.\n[[Word order]] is typically [[Subject\u2013object\u2013verb|SOV]] and there is an existence of [[implosives]]. The presence of high tone at [[suprasegmental]] level classifies it with other [[dialects of Rajasthani]]. It has contributed a lot to the development of Rajasthani language and [[linguistics]].\n\nSome samples in Shekhawati are:\n* Kai Hoyo? \u0915\u0948 \u0939\u094b\u092f\u094b? = What happened?\n* The Kai kar rieya ho? \u0925\u0947  \u0915\u0948 \u0915\u0930 \u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e  \u0939\u094b?= What are you doing?\n* Ma Thane ghano samman desyu. \u092e\u0948\u0902  \u0925\u093e\u0928\u0947  \u0918\u0923\u094b  \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928  \u0926\u0947\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0941   = I will give you great respect.\n* The sidh ja riya ho? \u0925\u0947 \u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927  \u091c\u093e  \u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e  \u0939\u094b?= Where are you going?\n* The ke kha rahiya ho? \u0925\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0916\u093e \u0930\u0939\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0939\u094b? = What are you eating?\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient history===\n{{main|Matsya Kingdom}}\nMany historians have considered this region included in the [[Matsya Kingdom]].

Out of 16 [[mahajanapada]]s prior to [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], only two Janapadas, namely [[Avanti (India)|Avanti]] and the Kingdom of [[Virata]] were counted in Rajasthan area. This region was also influenced by Avanti but later on [[Nanda dynasty|Nanda]]s of [[Magadha]] defeated Avanti. Historians believe that [[Maurya]]s obtained the Rajasthan from [[Nanda dynasty|Nanda]]s.<ref>Prithvi Singh Mehta: Hamara Rajasthan (1950), pages 30-31</ref>\n\nIn ancient times Shekhawati was not limited to the present two districts.  During the Mahabharata period, it was known as [[Matsya Kingdom]] and extended to the [[Sarasvati River]]. This was because the first clan ruling this region, in the Mahabharata period, were descendants of fishermen. So the [[Veda]]s were supposed to be written and compiled on this very land.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Sahiram: Ek adh\u016br\u012b kr\u0101nti, Shekhawati k\u0101 kis\u0101n \u0101ndolan (1922-1952), page-2</ref><ref>Satapatha Brahman 13/5/9</ref> During ancient times this region was divided into several [[janapada]]s.

According to Vimal Charanlal, this Kingdom of [[Virata]] extended from [[Jhunjhunu]] to Kotkasim 109&nbsp;km in the north, Jhunjhunu to Ajmer 184&nbsp;km in the west, Ajmer to Banas and up to the confluence of Chambal River 229&nbsp;km in the south.

The first progenitor of Kaimkhanis was Karamchand, born in the family of Moterao of Chauhan clan, the ruler of [[Dadrewa]]. [[Firuz Shah Tughluq]] converted him to Islam and named him Kaimkhan.
