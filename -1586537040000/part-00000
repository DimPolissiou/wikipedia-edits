Because it took so long for Europe to be occupied, it appears that humans and Neanderthals may have been constantly competing for territory. The Neanderthals had larger brains, and were larger overall, with a more robust or heavily built frame, which suggests that they were physically stronger than modern ''Homo sapiens''. Having lived in Europe for 200,000 years, they would have been better adapted to the cold weather. The anatomically modern humans known as the [[Cro-Magnons]], with widespread trade networks, superior technology and bodies likely better suited to running, would eventually completely displace the Neanderthals, whose last refuge was in the [[Iberian peninsula]]. After about 25,000 years ago the fossil record of the Neanderthals ends, indicating extinction. The last known population lived around a cave system on the remote south-facing coast of [[Gibraltar]] from 30,000 to 24,000 years ago.\n\nFrom the extent of linkage disequilibrium, it was estimated that the last Neanderthal gene flow into early ancestors of Europeans occurred 47,000\u201365,000 years [[Before Present|BP]].

The Neolithic subsequently gives way to the [[Bronze Age]] in [[Old World]] cultures and the gradual emergence of the [[historical record]] in the [[Ancient Near East|Near East]] and [[Bronze Age China|China]] beginning around 4,000 years ago.\n\nLarge-scale migrations of the Mesolithic to Neolithic era are thought to have given rise to the pre-modern distribution of the world's major [[language families]] such as the [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger-Congo]], [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]], [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]], [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] or [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] phyla. The speculative [[Nostratic language|Nostratic theory]] postulates the derivation of the major language families of Eurasia (excluding Sino-Tibetan) from a single proto-languages spoken at the beginning of the Holocene period.\n\n====Eurasia====\n{{see|Neolithic Revolution|Indo-European expansion|Proto-Uralic homeland hypotheses}}\nEvidence published in 2014 from genome analysis of ancient human remains suggests that the modern native populations of Europe largely descend from three distinct lineages: \"[[Western Hunter-Gatherers]]\", derivative of the Cro-Magnon population of Europe, [[Early European Farmers]] introduced to Europe from the Near East during the [[Neolithic Revolution]] and [[Ancient North Eurasians]] which expanded to Europe in the context of the [[Indo-European expansion]].<ref name=\"ScienceMag4Sep14\">{{cite web|url= http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2014/09/three-part-ancestry-europeans |title=Three-part ancestry for Europeans |author=Gibbons, Ann |website=Science |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |date=4 September 2014 |accessdate=30 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141011034223/http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2014/09/three-part-ancestry-europeans |archivedate=11 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Afroasiatic Urheimat]] has been placed in either Africa or Asia.\n\n====Sub-Saharan Africa====\n{{see|Nilo-Saharan|Niger-Congo}}\nThe [[Nilotic peoples]] are thought to be derived from an earlier undifferentiated [[Eastern Sudanic languages|Eastern Sudanic]] unity by the 3rd millennium BCE.

The Eastern Sudanic unity must have been considerably earlier still, perhaps around the 5th millennium BCE (while the proposed [[Nilo-Saharan]] unity would date to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] about 15kya). The original locus of the early Nilotic speakers was presumably east of the Nile in what is now [[South Sudan]].

MD&nbsp;200 continues northeast from there as a six-lane freeway through Redland Station, turning east to pass over Shady Grove Road, and then under Redland Road, paralleling Mill Creek. This is the location of the eastbound toll gantry. MD&nbsp;200 shortly curves to the east on the approach to the six-lane overpass for Olde Mill Run, which was built wide enough for a fourth lane in the eastbound direction.

A [[park and ride]] lot serving [[MTA Maryland]] commuter buses is located southwest of this interchange along MD&nbsp;97.

In its business activities, DAMRI carries out city transport, transport within province, intercity transport, airport transport, tourism transport, logistics transport, transport to isolated areas and Inter-country transport.\n\n==History==\nDAMRI's history officially began in 1943, with the establishment of two enterprises during the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation of Java]]: {{nihongo|the Java Transportation Enterprise|\u30b8\u30e3\u30ef\u904b\u8f38\u4e8b\u696d\u793e|Jawa Un'yu Jigy\u014dsha|lead=yes|extra=[[Nihon-shiki]]: ''Zyawa Un'yu Zigy\u00f4sya''}} for freight logistics, and the {{nihongo|Automobile Board|\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u7dcf\u5c40|Jid\u014dsha S\u014dkyoku|lead=yes|extra=[[Nihon-shiki]]: ''Zid\u00f4sha S\u00f4kyoku''}} for passenger transport. After [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesia proclaimed independence in 1945]], Java Transportation Enterprise changed its name to Djawatan Pengangkoetan (Transport Enterprise) and Automobile Board changed its name to Djawatan Angkoetan Darat (Land Transport Enterprise) as both enterprises were taken over by the [[Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia)|Indonesian Department of Transportation]].<br>\n\nBy 25 November 1946, both enterprises were merged, through a [[Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia)|Ministry of Transportation]] announcement ({{lang-id|Maklumat Menteri Perhubungan No.01/DAM/46}}), into Djawatan Angkoetan Motor Repoeblik Indonesia (DAMRI). It was tasked to \"operate land transportation by buses, trucks and other types of motor vehicles\".<br>\n\nDAMRI has played an active role during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], especially during the resistance against the [[Politionele acties|Dutch military aggressions]].<br>\n\nIn 1961, DAMRI was reorganized as a General Director Board ({{lang-id|Badan Pimpinan Umum, BPU}}). In 1965 the DAMRI BPU became a State Corporation ({{lang-id|Perusahaan Negara, PN}}), and in 1982 it was reorganized as a public corporation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.damrilogistics.co.id/tentang-kami| title=Sejarah Singkat| language=id| publisher=Damri Logistics|accessdate=March 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://damri.co.id/sejarah| title=Sejarah | language=id| publisher=Damri|accessdate=March 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==DAMRI offices==\n''' Perum DAMRI Head Office'''\n: Jl.

In its business activities, DAMRI carries out city transport, transport within province, intercity transport, airport transport, tourism transport, logistics transport, transport to isolated areas and Inter-country transport.\n\n==History==\nDAMRI's history officially began in 1943, with the establishment of two enterprises during the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation of Java]]: {{nihongo|the Java Transportation Enterprise|\u30b8\u30e3\u30ef\u904b\u8f38\u4e8b\u696d\u793e|Jawa Un'yu Jigy\u014dsha|lead=yes|extra=[[Nihon-shiki]]: ''Zyawa Un'yu Zigy\u00f4sya''}} for freight logistics, and the {{nihongo|Automobile Board|\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u7dcf\u5c40|Jid\u014dsha S\u014dkyoku|lead=yes|extra=[[Nihon-shiki]]: ''Zid\u00f4sha S\u00f4kyoku''}} for passenger transport. After [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesia proclaimed independence in 1945]], Java Transportation Enterprise changed its name to Djawatan Pengangkoetan (Transport Enterprise) and Automobile Board changed its name to Djawatan Angkoetan Darat (Land Transport Enterprise) as both enterprises were taken over by the [[Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia)|Indonesian Department of Transportation]].<br>\n\nBy 25 November 1946, both enterprises were merged, through a [[Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia)|Ministry of Transportation]] announcement ({{lang-id|Maklumat Menteri Perhubungan No.01/DAM/46}}), into Djawatan Angkoetan Motor Repoeblik Indonesia (DAMRI). It was tasked to \"operate land transportation by buses, trucks and other types of motor vehicles\".<br>\n\nDAMRI has played an active role during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], especially during the resistance against the [[Politionele acties|Dutch military aggressions]].<br>\n\nIn 1961, DAMRI was reorganized as a General Director Board ({{lang-id|Badan Pimpinan Umum, BPU}}). In 1965 the DAMRI BPU became a State Corporation ({{lang-id|Perusahaan Negara, PN}}), and in 1982 it was reorganized as a public corporation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.damrilogistics.co.id/tentang-kami| title=Sejarah Singkat| language=id| publisher=Damri Logistics|accessdate=March 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://damri.co.id/sejarah| title=Sejarah | language=id| publisher=Damri|accessdate=March 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==DAMRI offices==\n''' Perum DAMRI Head Office'''\n: Jl.

In addition, the senior cardinal bishop, the senior cardinal priest, the senior cardinal deacon and the junior cardinal deacon were assigned specific roles in the conclave, such as presiding over the conclave itself (the senior cardinal bishop) or [[Habemus papam|announcing the election of the pope]] (the senior cardinal deacon).<ref name=\"UDG\"/> These were, respectively, [[Joseph Ratzinger]], [[William Wakefield Baum]], [[Jorge Arturo Medina Est\u00e9vez]] and [[Attilio Nicora]].<ref name=\"Precedence\"/> The [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]], who was in charge of administering the Holy See during its vacancy, was [[Eduardo Mart\u00ednez Somalo]].<ref name=\"UDG\"/><ref name=\"Mart\u00ednez Somalo\"/>\n\nThe data below are as of {{nowrap|2 April 2005}}, the date on which the Holy See fell vacant. By default, the cardinals are sorted by precedence within each table, as denoted by the {{Abbr|No.|Number}} column. All cardinals are of the [[Latin Church]] unless otherwise stated. Cardinals belonging to [[Institute of consecrated life|institutes of consecrated life]] or to [[Society of apostolic life|societies of apostolic life]] are indicated by the respective [[post-nominal letters]].\n\n{{Legend|#ffc|Elected pope|text=*}}\n{{Row numbers|<nowiki>\n<!-- If you cannot view this table on the mobile app, please open this article in a web browser. -->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | {{Abbr|No.|Number}}\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"20%\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"12.5%\" | Country\n! scope=\"col\" | Born\n! scope=\"col\" | Order\n! scope=\"col\" | Consistory\n! scope=\"col\" | Office\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{Abbr|Ref.|Reference}}\n|- style=\"background: #ffc\"\n| _row_count\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left\" data-sort-value=\"Ratzinger, Joseph\" | [[Joseph Ratzinger]]*\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | {{flag|Germany}}\n| {{dts|1927|04|16|format=dmy}}<br>(age&nbsp;{{age in years|1927|04|16|2005|04|02}})\n| data-sort-value=\"1\" | [[Cardinal bishop|CB]]\n| {{dts|1977|06|27|format=dmy}}<br>[[Pope Paul VI|Paul&nbsp;VI]]\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] ([[Dean of the College of Cardinals|Dean]])\n| <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/cardinali_biografie/cardinali_bio_ratzinger_j_en.html|title=Ratzinger Card.
