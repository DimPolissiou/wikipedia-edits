He is the executive director of marketing for the Outdoor Man chain of sporting goods stores, with an office based in the Denver \"flagship\" store. He supports traditional American values, is a [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestant]] and is politically [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]]. Mike loves his daughters but says his favorite is Eve, the youngest and most athletic daughter, and whose political opinions and interests mirror his own. He is proud of her ability to excel at anything she tries, including schoolwork, hunting, and sports. Mike often finds himself annoyed with Outdoor Man's young goofball employee Kyle (who later becomes his son-in-law), and with Ryan, his atheist and politically [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] son-in-law married to his oldest daughter, and the father of his grandson Boyd. The video blog or \"vlog\" that Mike does for Outdoor Man is frequently used as a vehicle to express his political and social views. Mike is a graduate of the [[University of Michigan]], and an amateur radio operator using the call sign KA0XTT.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[American Radio Relay League]] |url=http://www.arrl.org/news/em-ham-radio-in-hollywood-em-comedian-tim-allen-stars-as-radio-amateur-on-new-tv-show |title=Ham Radio in Hollywood: Comedian Tim Allen Stars as Radio Amateur on New TV Show |date=December 12, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Nancy Travis]] as Vanessa Baxter (n\u00e9e Davidson), Mike's wife: Vanessa is a [[Geology|geologist]] working in the energy industry for a company that does [[hydraulic fracturing]], or \"fracking\". In season four, Vanessa becomes frustrated with her job and decides to go back to college to become a high-school science teacher. This is one example of the myriad of ideas Vanessa comes up with(the most damaging was her suggesting to Mandy that she join her old sorority and dump Kyle, which gives Mandy an excuse to cut class and drives a rift between Kyle and Vanessa). After being laid off as a teacher due to budget cuts, Vanessa begins her own tutoring business.  Vanessa was ambiguous in her political views(often idiotically agreeing with both sides) until season five, when she announced her support of [[Hillary Clinton]] for president, mainly because she thinks it will advance women's causes. She is frequently shown drinking copious amounts of wine, and is also frequently mocked by Mike and her daughters about it. She is a graduate of [[Ohio State University]] with a [[Master of Science]] degree in Physics and a [[PhD]] in Geology, and thus advanced farther in college than did Mike. She endlessly brags about her alma mater and her extensive history of boyfriends (all of whom dumped her). Vanessa often makes attempts to be politically correct, but when trying to relate to people of other races, she generally winds up with her foot in her mouth. Despite this, she and her African-American neighbor Carol Larabee seem to get along. Vanessa's humor includes [[punning]], which amuses her greatly but irritates Mike and the girls. Constantly feeling overshadowed by Mike, she will often spout something useless or inappropriate, just to horn in on the conversation. For the same reason, Vanessa has very few reservations about deceiving or manipulating Mike to get her way, and enjoys rubbing his nose in it if she does. Vanessa and Eve do not connect well (mainly because Eve holds beliefs nearly identical to Mike's).\n* [[Amanda Fuller]] (seasons 2\u2013present<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2018/07/02/last-man-standing-molly-ephraim-season-7-mandy-recast/|title=Last Man Standing Shake-Up: 2 Major Roles Being Recast Ahead of Season 7|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|date=July 2, 2018|publisher=}}</ref>) and [[Alexandra Krosney]] (season 1) as Kristin Beth Baxter, the oldest daughter.

During her senior year of high school, Kristin became pregnant with her son Boyd. She was a single mother living in the Baxter home until she moved out in the season-two finale. She began to reconcile with Boyd's father, Ryan Vogelson, in season three, and the two get married between seasons four and five. Kristin worked at a diner until landing a job at an upscale restaurant run by a former co-worker at the end of season two. In season four, she becomes the manager of the new wild game restaurant opened by Outdoor Man. Kristin tends to work extra hard in this new job to prove she did not get the position through nepotism, despite Mike and Ed frequently telling her she was qualified. At the start of season 8, Kristin announced that she is expecting her second child, and only trusted Mike with the secret of it being a girl. Amanda Fuller will be directing the eighth season finale, which is reported to be a cliffhanger involving her baby's arrival.\n* [[Molly Ephraim]] (seasons 1\u20136) and Molly McCook (season 7-present)<ref name=recast>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/last-man-standing-molly-ephraim-flynn-morrison-1202863659/|title=Tim \u2018Last Man Standing\u2019 Regulars Molly Ephraim, Flynn Morrison Exit Ahead of Season 7, Roles to Be Recast |last=Otterson |first=Joe |publisher=variety.com |date=July 2, 2018 |access-date=July 3, 2018}}</ref> as Amanda Elaine \"Mandy\" Baxter-Anderson, the middle daughter: Mandy is not as academic as her sisters (and she has a penchant for cutting class and ignoring homework), but she excels in social situations. Interested in fashion and little else, she was one of the most popular girls at her high school. Mandy is very confident and creative, demonstrating traits found in her father. She is also lazy, conceited, promiscuous, insulting, and delinquent&nbsp;\u2013 she drinks underage, ignores all driving laws, shoplifts from Outdoor Man, there are many implications that she has smoked cannabis, and she has been caught staying out all night&nbsp;\u2013 but occasionally she can display moments of generosity and caring. (She flew a relative of Blanca's home from Afghanistan one Christmas, and gave a homeless woman a makeover so she could ace a job interview.) Her bragging suggests that she has dated and/or slept with most of the boys in her high school, as well as some of the male teachers. Despite this, Mandy started dating Kyle in Season 2. As of Season 3, she attends a local college and works at the diner where Kristin used to work. It has been intimated that she has [[ADHD]] when she takes some of Boyd's ADD medication and starts doing well on her college tests. Later that same season, she begins an online clothing business, selling her self-designed fashions which she assembles in the basement of her parents' house. Kyle asks her to marry him in Season 5, the 100th episode. She marries Kyle in Season 6, and they lived in the Baxter home until the finale of season 7. Up until she turned 21, a running gag on the show was Mike, Vanessa, and occasionally Kristin snatching glasses of alcohol out of Mandy's hand, usually followed by Mandy making a lame excuse. Ephraim was replaced by Molly McCook prior to the Season 7 revival on FOX due to Ephraim choosing not to return.<ref name=recast /> Since her marriage, Mandy has done everything possible to avoid conceiving a child, but never bothering to tell husband Kyle that she's not ready for parenthood. That changes at the start of season 8, when she confides that she and Kyle are trying for real to conceive. Also in season 8, Mandy gets an opportunity to design a new casual clothing line for Outdoor Man.\n* [[Kaitlyn Dever]] as Eve Baxter, (series regular, seasons 1\u20136; recurring, season 7-present)<ref>{{cite web |title=Last Man Standing EP Laments That 'Unfortunate' Cast Departure |url=https://tvline.com/2018/08/02/molly-ephraim-leaving-last-man-standing-season-7-mandy-recast/ |website=TV Line |publisher=TV Line |accessdate=2 August 2018}}</ref> the youngest daughter: Eve is intelligent and athletic, and generally has the same interests as Mike, including camping, sports, guns, and the military. She also has [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] views like Mike. She is Mike's favorite daughter, and excels at her hobbies. She frequently outplays the boys in soccer and makes the boys' football team as their placekicker. She is well aware of being the favorite over her two sisters. Eve also shares her father's sense of humor, and her sarcastic wit is frequently directed at clueless sister Mandy. Eve is an excellent student, whose only weak subject is art, though she did have to change math classes to escape a prejudiced, anti-female teacher. Eve is a member of [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|Army Junior ROTC]] and works toward gaining admittance to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]. Her attempt to do so is unsuccessful, which seriously depresses her, so in season six, Eve decides to take a \"personal year\" rather than immediately attend college. She spends some of this time singing and playing guitar for money, but this proves to be unfruitful. She had more success working at Outdoor Man and volunteering for a [[Habitat for Humanity]]-style local charity. During her gap year, Eve applies to the [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]] in nearby [[Colorado Springs]] (without telling either parent), and is accepted. Over her mother's objections, Eve chooses to enlist in the Academy. In season seven, Cadet 4th Class Baxter is only a recurring character as she is now enrolled at the Academy. (This was due to Dever's commitments to the [[Netflix]] miniseries ''[[Unbelievable (miniseries)|Unbelievable]]''.) Due to Dever's continued busy schedule, Eve is again a recurring character in Season 8.<ref>{{cite web |title=Last Man Standing's Kaitlyn Dever Poised to Appear in Fewer Season 8 Episodes: 'She Is Just Crazy Busy' |url=https://tvline.com/2019/12/22/last-man-standing-season-8-eve-baxter-less-episodes-kaitlyn-dever/ |website=TV Line |last=Schwartz |first=Ryan |date=2019-12-22 |accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n* [[Christoph Sanders]] as Kyle Anderson, a young employee at Outdoor Man: Kyle is universally recognized as a [[Nice guy|good guy]]. Kyle idolizes Mike, having grown up without a father figure, but Mike is mostly irritated by Kyle's personality and behavior. Kyle takes care of his grandmother who has [[dementia]], and it is implied he grew up in her home. His estranged mother passes away in season six, leaving Kyle with mixed feelings over how to deal with it. Kyle is often oblivious to social cues and is slow to catch on to the events happening around him. Kyle dated Kristin in season one and started dating Mandy in season two before proposing in season five, and marrying Mandy in season six. Kyle was shuffled from role to role at Outdoor Man, sometimes messing up due to his trusting nature. In season seven, Mike and Ed experiment with putting him in an HR role, and find that Kyle's combination of people skills and strict adherence to company guidelines makes him a good fit for the position. As of season seven, he has yet to level his mother's trailer or break ground on building his own home, although he and Mandy moved into an apartment at the end of that season. Kyle has mentioned that he and Mandy are trying to conceive a baby, unaware that Mandy has reservations about it and has yet to discontinue birth control. That changes at the start of season 8, when Mandy confides that she and Kyle are trying for real to conceive.\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Edward \"Ed\" Alzate, Mike's longtime business partner: Ed started a [[Fish bait|bait]] and [[Fishing tackle|tackle]] shop many years ago and hired Mike, who helped turn the shop into the 20-store Outdoor Man chain.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Rediscover America|series=Last Man Standing|credits=Vince Calandra (writer) & [[Victor Gonzalez (director)|Victor Gonzalez]] (director)|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|airdate=October 10, 2014|season=4|number=3}}</ref> Ed is perhaps fifteen years older than Mike, but the two men bond over similar outdoor hobbies and shared conservative values. He is of [[Basque people|Basque]] heritage, something which he takes great pride in and brings up whenever possible. Mike regularly talks to Ed about the happenings in his home and occasionally seeks advice. Having been divorced four times, Ed's suggestions on relationships are rarely helpful. Despite his status as Outdoor Man \"founder\", Ed has very little business sense (often following fly-by-night promotional trends) and sometimes lacks tact with female customers and employees. Thus, Outdoor Man's success is mainly due to Mike's intelligence and ability to resolve conflicts (sometimes requiring him to pull Ed's foot out of his mouth). He also has five daughters (and a war baby). Ed is a [[Vietnam veteran]], although he saw no combat in Vietnam, stating that he was a clerk in Saigon. He continues to help fellow veterans at the local [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] hall with their [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veteran Affairs]] paperwork. Ed is also a recurring target for jokes about his age and lack of hair, most often from Mike. Early in Season 7, Ed announces his retirement from Outdoor Man, but still comes in when activities with people his own age bore him, which is often. Also in Season 7, he meets, falls for, and becomes engaged to Vanessa's mother, Bonnie, whom he marries early in Season 8.\n* Flynn Morrison (regular, seasons 2\u20136), [[Jet Jurgensmeyer]] (season 7)<ref name=recast /> (recurring, season 8) and Evan and Luke Kruntchev (recurring, season 1) as Boyd Baxter, son of Kristin and Ryan: Mike enjoys spending quality time with his grandson Boyd, and affectionately views him as the son he never had. Mike and Ryan often clash on how he should be raised. Boyd enjoys activities encouraged by both his father and grandfather.\n* [[Jordan Masterson]] (regular, seasons 4\u2013present; recurring, seasons 2\u20133) and [[Nick Jonas]] (guest star, season 1) as Ryan Vogelson, Boyd's Canadian father: Though Ryan initially fled the country when Kristin fell pregnant, he returned five years later to be involved in Boyd's upbringing (though for next three years he was the personification of a 'deadbeat dad'), and eventually the two reconciled and got engaged (at the end of season 3). Ryan holds liberal views, both politically and philosophically, and he and Mike routinely clash over their fundamentally opposing values, especially when it comes to child-rearing. Ryan wishes to raise his son without religion, hunting culture and national pride, however, neither Mike nor Kristin agree with this approach. His vegan diet, views on discipline, love for all liberal policies, and what Mike sees as his oversensitivity are an affront to Mike's beliefs, but Ryan generally enjoys being a thorn in Mike's side, as well as infuriating the entire family when he mocks their belief in God. Ryan also infuriates the entire family by trying to force his will on Boyd's elementary school, trying to ban things like dodgeball, soda, and worst of all, [[The Pledge of Allegiance]]. On rare occasions, Ryan and Mike agree on what is best for Boyd, but this usually puts them at odds with Kristin or Vanessa. Mike comes to reluctantly respect and like his son-in-law for standing up for what he believes, and for being a loving husband and father. At the beginning of Season 7, Ryan threatens to run back to Canada with Kristin and Boyd over his hatred of President Trump's leadership, until Mike encourages him to apply for U.S. citizenship. (This suggests that for all the time Ryan has been in Boyd's life, he's been an illegal alien). Upon Bud Baxter's passing, Ryan assumes ownership and operation of the marijuana store, with Mike's blessing. He later rents the upper floor of the marijuana store to Mandy and Kyle as an apartment, becoming their landlord.\n* [[Jonathan Adams (American actor)|Jonathan Adams]] as Chuck Larabee (regular, seasons 4\u2013present; recurring, seasons 2\u20133), Mike and Vanessa's neighbor: Chuck is a retired [[Marine (military)|U.S. Marine]] and a veteran of the first [[Gulf War]] who runs a private security business and later takes charge of security for the Denver Outdoor Man. Chuck is an African-American who grew up in [[Minneapolis]], and often jokes with Mike about racial stereotypes. The two regularly exchange barbs as if they don't like each other. In reality, they are good friends, despite being unwilling to admit it. Vanessa sees through their heated exchanges, often telling them to \"get a room\". Chuck's typical response to something or someone that exasperates him is, \"not cool\". Like Mike, Chuck enjoys repairing and restoring cars, something he learned by assisting his father for many years. Chuck is married to Carol and they have a son, Brandon, who is the same age as Eve.\n* [[Krista Marie Yu]] as Jen (season 7\u2013present), Vanessa's foreign-exchange student from Hong Kong who moves in with the Baxters in season 7.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/last-man-standing-krista-yu-promoted-series-regular-fox-tim-allen-1202537375/|title='Last Man Standing': Krista Marie Yu Promoted To Regular On Fox Series|publisher=Deadline|author=Denise Petski|date=January 18, 2019|accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref> At first, she is shy and goes along with everything Mike wants, but Mike challenges her to be confident and to stand up for her what she wants. As opposed to the Baxter girls, Jen is very passive-aggressive, often giving backhanded compliments or subtly dropping slams against what she perceives as the foolishness of Vanessa and her daughters (mainly Mandy). In Season 8, she begins kissing up to Vanessa at every opportunity for as-yet unknown reasons.\n\n==Recurring cast==\n* [[Robert Forster]] as Bud Baxter (seasons 1, 3\u20134, 7), Mike's widower father who is initially in the construction business, but later opens a marijuana store (\"Bud's Buds\") after it becomes legal in Colorado. In season 7, it is revealed that Bud died of a heart attack(Forster would succumb to brain cancer a year later, so it's possible that he left the show seeking treatment for this). Ryan, lacking a job after he stopped home-schooling Boyd, takes over the pot shop.\n* [[Christina Moore]] as April (seasons 1 & 3), Vanessa's air-headed and immature younger sister. She is always asking for money, and once wanted to have a child despite having no means of supporting it.\n* [[Danielle Bisutti]] as Michelle (season 1), Vanessa's pseudo-friend and next-door neighbor; she is a local weathergirl who acquires most of her data from a free phone app.\n* [[Erika Alexander]] (seasons 2\u20136) and [[Tisha Campbell-Martin|Tisha Campbell]] (season 7\u2013) as Carol Larabee, Chuck's wife and Mike and Vanessa's neighbor, who becomes Vanessa's best friend. Vanessa often goes overboard trying to act racially open-minded around her, but usually ends up with her foot in her mouth, annoying Carol. In season 6, Carol accepts a year-long job in California, leaving Chuck behind in Denver. She returns in season 7, and the two renew their wedding vows.\n* [[Carla Jimenez]] as Blanca Alvarez (seasons 2\u20134), the Baxters' Guatemalan-born housekeeper who also helps Mandy with her fashion business. The Baxters were happy to celebrate with Blanca after she was sworn in as an American citizen. Her disappearance has never been explained.\n* [[Sarah Gilman]] as Cammy Harris (seasons 2\u20136), Eve's soccer teammate and extremely chatty best friend. It is hinted by Mandy in season 4's \"Restaurant Opening\" that Cammy has a full-on crush for Eve that goes beyond friendship. This leads to Eve avoiding Cammy for a while, though Cammy later insists she would never do anything to make Eve uncomfortable. Cammy also briefly led a three-piece band (with Eve on guitar) called the \"Cammy Harris Experience\". When Cammy and drummer Nigel chickened out at their first gig, Eve performed a solo song that impressed both Mike and the club owner.\n* [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]] as John Baker (seasons 2\u20133), Kristin's boss at a fancy restaurant where she works. Thomas also had a cameo as \"Randy\" (a nod to his ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' character) in the season 4 episode \"Helen Potts\", with fellow ''Home Improvement'' co-star [[Patricia Richardson]]. Since the writing out of John Baker, Jonathan Taylor Thomas has directed multiple episodes of the series.\n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as Justin (seasons 3\u20134), Eve's fellow Jr. ROTC member and football teammate who becomes her boyfriend. The two break up in season 4.\n* [[Zachary Gordon]] as Andrew (season 3), Eve's nerdy classmate who worships her and desperately wants to be her boyfriend. He became her prom date when Justin pushed her too far.\n* [[Joely Fisher]] as Wendi Gracin (seasons 3\u20135), Ed's obnoxious younger girlfriend, whom he meets near the end of season three. Ed routinely has to put her in her place, particularly when she shows up at the store and tries to get involved in running his business (her agenda usually involves denigrating Mike). Wendi deserts Ed offscreen between Seasons 4 and 5, but the two patch things up and reunite. When the series returned for a seventh season, Wendi was not seen or mentioned. It is understood that she and Ed broke up, as Ed dates and later becomes engaged to Vanessa's mother, Bonnie, during that season.\n* [[Bill Engvall]] as Reverend Paul (seasons 5\u2013present), the new pastor of the Baxter family's church, who enjoys hustling donations out of Mike. (Nancy Travis played Bill's wife Susan on three seasons of ''[[The Bill Engvall Show]]'')\n* [[Jay Leno]] as Joe Leonard (seasons 5\u2013present), a semi-retired auto technician from whom Vanessa buys a classic car for Mike. Joe later works in the repair shop at Outdoor Man, servicing products like ATVs, snowmobiles and boat engines. Joe enjoys throwing humorous insults at Mike, often teaming up with Chuck in these exchanges.\n* [[Travis Tope]] as Rob (season 6), Eve's boyfriend who is studying criminal justice at [[UC Boulder]]. He's a recovering alcoholic, which worries Mike and Vanessa when they first meet him. Shortly before Eve left for the Air Force Academy, Vanessa's nosy meddling ruined their relationship.\n\n==Notable guest stars==\nSeveral notable guest stars have appeared throughout the series, including appearances made from cast members of Tim Allen's previous series, ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]''.\n\n* [[Paul F.

He supports traditional American values, is a [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestant]] and is politically [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]]. Mike loves his daughters but says his favorite is Eve, the youngest and most athletic daughter, and whose political opinions and interests mirror his own. He is proud of her ability to excel at anything she tries, including schoolwork, hunting, and sports. Mike often finds himself annoyed with Outdoor Man's young goofball employee Kyle (who later becomes his son-in-law), and with Ryan, his atheist and politically [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] son-in-law married to his oldest daughter, and the father of his grandson Boyd. The video blog or \"vlog\" that Mike does for Outdoor Man is frequently used as a vehicle to express his political and social views.

This is one example of the myriad of ideas Vanessa comes up with(the most damaging was her suggesting to Mandy that she join her old sorority and dump Kyle, which gives Mandy an excuse to cut class and drives a rift between Kyle and Vanessa). After being laid off as a teacher due to budget cuts, Vanessa begins her own tutoring business.  Vanessa was ambiguous in her political views(often idiotically agreeing with both sides) until season five, when she announced her support of [[Hillary Clinton]] for president, mainly because she thinks it will advance women's causes. She is frequently shown drinking copious amounts of wine, and is also frequently mocked by Mike and her daughters about it. She is a graduate of [[Ohio State University]] with a [[Master of Science]] degree in Physics and a [[PhD]] in Geology, and thus advanced farther in college than did Mike.

During her senior year of high school, Kristin became pregnant with her son Boyd. She was a single mother living in the Baxter home until she moved out in the season-two finale. She began to reconcile with Boyd's father, Ryan Vogelson, in season three, and the two get married between seasons four and five. Kristin worked at a diner until landing a job at an upscale restaurant run by a former co-worker at the end of season two. In season four, she becomes the manager of the new wild game restaurant opened by Outdoor Man. Kristin tends to work extra hard in this new job to prove she did not get the position through nepotism, despite Mike and Ed frequently telling her she was qualified. At the start of season 8, Kristin announced that she is expecting her second child, and only trusted Mike with the secret of it being a girl. Amanda Fuller will be directing the eighth season finale, which is reported to be a cliffhanger involving her baby's arrival.\n* [[Molly Ephraim]] (seasons 1\u20136) and Molly McCook (season 7-present)<ref name=recast>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/last-man-standing-molly-ephraim-flynn-morrison-1202863659/|title=Tim \u2018Last Man Standing\u2019 Regulars Molly Ephraim, Flynn Morrison Exit Ahead of Season 7, Roles to Be Recast |last=Otterson |first=Joe |publisher=variety.com |date=July 2, 2018 |access-date=July 3, 2018}}</ref> as Amanda Elaine \"Mandy\" Baxter-Anderson, the middle daughter: Mandy is not as academic as her sisters (and she has a penchant for cutting class and ignoring homework), but she excels in social situations. Interested in fashion and little else, she was one of the most popular girls at her high school. Mandy is very confident and creative, demonstrating traits found in her father. She is also lazy, conceited, promiscuous, insulting, and delinquent&nbsp;\u2013 she drinks underage, ignores all driving laws, shoplifts from Outdoor Man, there are many implications that she has smoked cannabis, and she has been caught staying out all night&nbsp;\u2013 but occasionally she can display moments of generosity and caring. (She flew a relative of Blanca's home from Afghanistan one Christmas, and gave a homeless woman a makeover so she could ace a job interview.) Her bragging suggests that she has dated and/or slept with most of the boys in her high school, as well as some of the male teachers. Despite this, Mandy started dating Kyle in Season 2. As of Season 3, she attends a local college and works at the diner where Kristin used to work. It has been intimated that she has [[ADHD]] when she takes some of Boyd's ADD medication and starts doing well on her college tests. Later that same season, she begins an online clothing business, selling her self-designed fashions which she assembles in the basement of her parents' house. Kyle asks her to marry him in Season 5, the 100th episode. She marries Kyle in Season 6, and they lived in the Baxter home until the finale of season 7. Up until she turned 21, a running gag on the show was Mike, Vanessa, and occasionally Kristin snatching glasses of alcohol out of Mandy's hand, usually followed by Mandy making a lame excuse. Ephraim was replaced by Molly McCook prior to the Season 7 revival on FOX due to Ephraim choosing not to return.<ref name=recast /> Since her marriage, Mandy has done everything possible to avoid conceiving a child, but never bothering to tell husband Kyle that she's not ready for parenthood. That changes at the start of season 8, when she confides that she and Kyle are trying for real to conceive. Also in season 8, Mandy gets an opportunity to design a new casual clothing line for Outdoor Man.\n* [[Kaitlyn Dever]] as Eve Baxter, (series regular, seasons 1\u20136; recurring, season 7-present)<ref>{{cite web |title=Last Man Standing EP Laments That 'Unfortunate' Cast Departure |url=https://tvline.com/2018/08/02/molly-ephraim-leaving-last-man-standing-season-7-mandy-recast/ |website=TV Line |publisher=TV Line |accessdate=2 August 2018}}</ref> the youngest daughter: Eve is intelligent and athletic, and generally has the same interests as Mike, including camping, sports, guns, and the military. She also has [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] views like Mike. She is Mike's favorite daughter, and excels at her hobbies. She frequently outplays the boys in soccer and makes the boys' football team as their placekicker. She is well aware of being the favorite over her two sisters. Eve also shares her father's sense of humor, and her sarcastic wit is frequently directed at clueless sister Mandy. Eve is an excellent student, whose only weak subject is art, though she did have to change math classes to escape a prejudiced, anti-female teacher. Eve is a member of [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|Army Junior ROTC]] and works toward gaining admittance to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]. Her attempt to do so is unsuccessful, which seriously depresses her, so in season six, Eve decides to take a \"personal year\" rather than immediately attend college. She spends some of this time singing and playing guitar for money, but this proves to be unfruitful. She had more success working at Outdoor Man and volunteering for a [[Habitat for Humanity]]-style local charity. During her gap year, Eve applies to the [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]] in nearby [[Colorado Springs]] (without telling either parent), and is accepted. Over her mother's objections, Eve chooses to enlist in the Academy. In season seven, Cadet 4th Class Baxter is only a recurring character as she is now enrolled at the Academy. (This was due to Dever's commitments to the [[Netflix]] miniseries ''[[Unbelievable (miniseries)|Unbelievable]]''.) Due to Dever's continued busy scheduled, Eve is again a recurring character in Season 8.<ref>{{cite web |title=Last Man Standing's Kaitlyn Dever Poised to Appear in Fewer Season 8 Episodes: 'She Is Just Crazy Busy' |url=https://tvline.com/2019/12/22/last-man-standing-season-8-eve-baxter-less-episodes-kaitlyn-dever/ |website=TV Line |last=Schwartz |first=Ryan |date=2019-12-22 |accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n* [[Christoph Sanders]] as Kyle Anderson, a young employee at Outdoor Man: Kyle is universally recognized as a [[Nice guy|good guy]]. Kyle idolizes Mike, having grown up without a father figure, but Mike is mostly irritated by Kyle's personality and behavior. Kyle takes care of his grandmother who has [[dementia]], and it is implied he grew up in her home. His estranged mother passes away in season six, leaving Kyle with mixed feelings over how to deal with it. Kyle is often oblivious to social cues and is slow to catch on to the events happening around him. Kyle dated Kristin in season one and started dating Mandy in season two before proposing in season five, and marrying Mandy in season six. Kyle was shuffled from role to role at Outdoor Man, sometimes messing up due to his trusting nature. In season seven, Mike and Ed experiment with putting him in an HR role, and find that Kyle's combination of people skills and strict adherence to company guidelines makes him a good fit for the position. As of season seven, he has yet to level his mother's trailer or break ground on building his own home, although he and Mandy moved into an apartment at the end of that season. Kyle has mentioned that he and Mandy are trying to conceive a baby, unaware that Mandy has reservations about it and has yet to discontinue birth control. That changes at the start of season 8, when Mandy confides that she and Kyle are trying for real to conceive.\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Edward \"Ed\" Alzate, Mike's longtime business partner: Ed started a [[Fish bait|bait]] and [[Fishing tackle|tackle]] shop many years ago and hired Mike, who helped turn the shop into the 20-store Outdoor Man chain.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Rediscover America|series=Last Man Standing|credits=Vince Calandra (writer) & [[Victor Gonzalez (director)|Victor Gonzalez]] (director)|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|airdate=October 10, 2014|season=4|number=3}}</ref> Ed is perhaps fifteen years older than Mike, but the two men bond over similar outdoor hobbies and shared conservative values. He is of [[Basque people|Basque]] heritage, something which he takes great pride in and brings up whenever possible. Mike regularly talks to Ed about the happenings in his home and occasionally seeks advice. Having been divorced four times, Ed's suggestions on relationships are rarely helpful. Despite his status as Outdoor Man \"founder\", Ed has very little business sense (often following fly-by-night promotional trends) and sometimes lacks tact with female customers and employees. Thus, Outdoor Man's success is mainly due to Mike's intelligence and ability to resolve conflicts (sometimes requiring him to pull Ed's foot out of his mouth). He also has five daughters (and a war baby). Ed is a [[Vietnam veteran]], although he saw no combat in Vietnam, stating that he was a clerk in Saigon. He continues to help fellow veterans at the local [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] hall with their [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veteran Affairs]] paperwork. Ed is also a recurring target for jokes about his age and lack of hair, most often from Mike. Early in Season 7, Ed announces his retirement from Outdoor Man, but still comes in when activities with people his own age bore him, which is often. Also in Season 7, he meets, falls for, and becomes engaged to Vanessa's mother, Bonnie, whom he marries early in Season 8.\n* Flynn Morrison (regular, seasons 2\u20136), [[Jet Jurgensmeyer]] (season 7)<ref name=recast /> (recurring, season 8) and Evan and Luke Kruntchev (recurring, season 1) as Boyd Baxter, son of Kristin and Ryan: Mike enjoys spending quality time with his grandson Boyd, and affectionately views him as the son he never had. Mike and Ryan often clash on how he should be raised. Boyd enjoys activities encouraged by both his father and grandfather.\n* [[Jordan Masterson]] (regular, seasons 4\u2013present; recurring, seasons 2\u20133) and [[Nick Jonas]] (guest star, season 1) as Ryan Vogelson, Boyd's Canadian father: Though Ryan initially fled the country when Kristin fell pregnant, he returned five years later to be involved in Boyd's upbringing (though for next three years he was the personification of a 'deadbeat dad'), and eventually the two reconciled and got engaged (at the end of season 3). Ryan holds liberal views, both politically and philosophically, and he and Mike routinely clash over their fundamentally opposing values, especially when it comes to child-rearing. Ryan wishes to raise his son without religion, hunting culture and national pride, however, neither Mike nor Kristin agree with this approach. His vegan diet, views on discipline, love for all liberal policies, and what Mike sees as his oversensitivity are an affront to Mike's beliefs, but Ryan generally enjoys being a thorn in Mike's side, as well as infuriating the entire family when he mocks their belief in God. Ryan also infuriates the entire family by trying to force his will on Boyd's elementary school, trying to ban things like dodgeball, soda, and worst of all, [[The Pledge of Allegiance]]. On rare occasions, Ryan and Mike agree on what is best for Boyd, but this usually puts them at odds with Kristin or Vanessa. Mike comes to reluctantly respect and like his son-in-law for standing up for what he believes, and for being a loving husband and father. At the beginning of Season 7, Ryan threatens to run back to Canada with Kristin and Boyd over his hatred of President Trump's leadership, until Mike encourages him to apply for U.S. citizenship. (This suggests that for all the time Ryan has been in Boyd's life, he's been an illegal alien). Upon Bud Baxter's passing, Ryan assumes ownership and operation of the marijuana store, with Mike's blessing. He later rents the upper floor of the marijuana store to Mandy and Kyle as an apartment, becoming their landlord.\n* [[Jonathan Adams (American actor)|Jonathan Adams]] as Chuck Larabee (regular, seasons 4\u2013present; recurring, seasons 2\u20133), Mike and Vanessa's neighbor: Chuck is a retired [[Marine (military)|U.S. Marine]] and a veteran of the first [[Gulf War]] who runs a private security business and later takes charge of security for the Denver Outdoor Man. Chuck is an African-American who grew up in [[Minneapolis]], and often jokes with Mike about racial stereotypes. The two regularly exchange barbs as if they don't like each other. In reality, they are good friends, despite being unwilling to admit it. Vanessa sees through their heated exchanges, often telling them to \"get a room\". Chuck's typical response to something or someone that exasperates him is, \"not cool\". Like Mike, Chuck enjoys repairing and restoring cars, something he learned by assisting his father for many years. Chuck is married to Carol and they have a son, Brandon, who is the same age as Eve.\n* [[Krista Marie Yu]] as Jen (season 7\u2013present), Vanessa's foreign-exchange student from Hong Kong who moves in with the Baxters in season 7.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/last-man-standing-krista-yu-promoted-series-regular-fox-tim-allen-1202537375/|title='Last Man Standing': Krista Marie Yu Promoted To Regular On Fox Series|publisher=Deadline|author=Denise Petski|date=January 18, 2019|accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref> At first, she is shy and goes along with everything Mike wants, but Mike challenges her to be confident and to stand up for her what she wants. As opposed to the Baxter girls, Jen is very passive-aggressive, often giving backhanded compliments or subtly dropping slams against what she perceives as the foolishness of Vanessa and her daughters (mainly Mandy). In Season 8, she begins kissing up to Vanessa at every opportunity for as-yet unknown reasons.\n\n==Recurring cast==\n* [[Robert Forster]] as Bud Baxter (seasons 1, 3\u20134, 7), Mike's widower father who is initially in the construction business, but later opens a marijuana store (\"Bud's Buds\") after it becomes legal in Colorado. In season 7, it is revealed that Bud died of a heart attack(Forster would succumb to brain cancer a year later, so it's possible that he left the show seeking treatment for this). Ryan, lacking a job after he stopped home-schooling Boyd, takes over the pot shop.\n* [[Christina Moore]] as April (seasons 1 & 3), Vanessa's air-headed and immature younger sister. She is always asking for money, and once wanted to have a child despite having no means of supporting it.\n* [[Danielle Bisutti]] as Michelle (season 1), Vanessa's pseudo-friend and next-door neighbor; she is a local weathergirl who acquires most of her data from a free phone app.\n* [[Erika Alexander]] (seasons 2\u20136) and [[Tisha Campbell-Martin|Tisha Campbell]] (season 7\u2013) as Carol Larabee, Chuck's wife and Mike and Vanessa's neighbor, who becomes Vanessa's best friend. Vanessa often goes overboard trying to act racially open-minded around her, but usually ends up with her foot in her mouth, annoying Carol. In season 6, Carol accepts a year-long job in California, leaving Chuck behind in Denver. She returns in season 7, and the two renew their wedding vows.\n* [[Carla Jimenez]] as Blanca Alvarez (seasons 2\u20134), the Baxters' Guatemalan-born housekeeper who also helps Mandy with her fashion business. The Baxters were happy to celebrate with Blanca after she was sworn in as an American citizen. Her disappearance has never been explained.\n* [[Sarah Gilman]] as Cammy Harris (seasons 2\u20136), Eve's soccer teammate and extremely chatty best friend. It is hinted by Mandy in season 4's \"Restaurant Opening\" that Cammy has a full-on crush for Eve that goes beyond friendship. This leads to Eve avoiding Cammy for a while, though Cammy later insists she would never do anything to make Eve uncomfortable. Cammy also briefly led a three-piece band (with Eve on guitar) called the \"Cammy Harris Experience\". When Cammy and drummer Nigel chickened out at their first gig, Eve performed a solo song that impressed both Mike and the club owner.\n* [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]] as John Baker (seasons 2\u20133), Kristin's boss at a fancy restaurant where she works. Thomas also had a cameo as \"Randy\" (a nod to his ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' character) in the season 4 episode \"Helen Potts\", with fellow ''Home Improvement'' co-star [[Patricia Richardson]]. Since the writing out of John Baker, Jonathan Taylor Thomas has directed multiple episodes of the series.\n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as Justin (seasons 3\u20134), Eve's fellow Jr. ROTC member and football teammate who becomes her boyfriend. The two break up in season 4.\n* [[Zachary Gordon]] as Andrew (season 3), Eve's nerdy classmate who worships her and desperately wants to be her boyfriend. He became her prom date when Justin pushed her too far.\n* [[Joely Fisher]] as Wendi Gracin (seasons 3\u20135), Ed's obnoxious younger girlfriend, whom he meets near the end of season three. Ed routinely has to put her in her place, particularly when she shows up at the store and tries to get involved in running his business (her agenda usually involves denigrating Mike). Wendi deserts Ed offscreen between Seasons 4 and 5, but the two patch things up and reunite. When the series returned for a seventh season, Wendi was not seen or mentioned. It is understood that she and Ed broke up, as Ed dates and later becomes engaged to Vanessa's mother, Bonnie, during that season.\n* [[Bill Engvall]] as Reverend Paul (seasons 5\u2013present), the new pastor of the Baxter family's church, who enjoys hustling donations out of Mike. (Nancy Travis played Bill's wife Susan on three seasons of ''[[The Bill Engvall Show]]'')\n* [[Jay Leno]] as Joe Leonard (seasons 5\u2013present), a semi-retired auto technician from whom Vanessa buys a classic car for Mike. Joe later works in the repair shop at Outdoor Man, servicing products like ATVs, snowmobiles and boat engines. Joe enjoys throwing humorous insults at Mike, often teaming up with Chuck in these exchanges.\n* [[Travis Tope]] as Rob (season 6), Eve's boyfriend who is studying criminal justice at [[UC Boulder]]. He's a recovering alcoholic, which worries Mike and Vanessa when they first meet him. Shortly before Eve left for the Air Force Academy, Vanessa's nosy meddling ruined their relationship.\n\n==Notable guest stars==\nSeveral notable guest stars have appeared throughout the series, including appearances made from cast members of Tim Allen's previous series, ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]''.\n\n* [[Paul F.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] (1955) for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

The city is approximately {{convert|20|mi|km}} from [[Southampton]] and {{convert|30|mi|km}} from [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].\n\nSalisbury is in the southeast of Wiltshire, near the edge of [[Salisbury Plain]]. [[Salisbury Cathedral]] was formerly north of the city at [[Old Sarum Cathedral|Old Sarum]]. Following the cathedral's relocation, a settlement grew up around it which received a city charter in 1227 as {{nowrap|New Sarum}}, which continued to be its official name until [[2009 structural changes to local government in England|2009]], when [[Salisbury City Council]] was established. [[Salisbury railway station]] is an interchange between the [[West of England Main Line]] and the [[Wessex Main Line]].\n\n[[Stonehenge]], a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]], is {{convert|8|mi|sp=us}} northwest of Salisbury.\n\n==Name==\nThe name ''Salisbury'', which is first recorded around the year 900 as ''Searoburg'' ([[dative case|dative]] ''Searobyrig''), is a partial translation of the Roman Celtic name ''Sorbiod\u016bnum''.  The [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] suffix  ''-d\u016bnon'', meaning \"fortress\" (in reference to the fort that stood at Old Sarum), was replaced by its [[Old English]] equivalent ''-burg''. The first part of the name is of obscure origin. The form \"Sarum\" is a Latinization of ''Sar'', a medieval abbreviation for [[Middle English]] ''Sarisberie''.<ref>Mills, David.

In Salisbury, James heard that some of his officers had deserted, such as [[Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde]], and he broke out in a nosebleed, which he took as an omen that he should retreat.

When Wiltshire's local government was reorganised under a [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]] in April 2009, Salisbury City Council was formed, although with fewer responsibilities than the former district council as it is now a parish.\n\nThree [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral wards]] \u2013 St Martin's and Cathedral, St Edmund and Milford and St Paul's \u2013 correspond roughly to the city centre, and the rest of the parish and city council area is covered by five further wards.

The geology of the area, as with much of South Wiltshire and [[Hampshire]], is largely chalk.  The rivers which flow through the city have been redirected, and along with landscaping, have been used to feed into public gardens.  They are popular in the summer, particularly in Queen Elizabeth Gardens, as the water there is shallow and slow-flowing enough to enter safely.  Close to Queen Elizabeth Gardens are [[water-meadow]]s, where the water is controlled by [[weir]]s.  Because of the low-lying land, the rivers are prone to flooding, particularly during the winter months.  The ''Town Path'', a walkway that links [[Harnham]] with the rest of the city, is at times impassable. Salisbury is approximately halfway between Exeter and London being 80 miles (128&nbsp;km) east-northeast of [[Exeter]], 78 miles (126&nbsp;km) west-southwest of [[London]] and also {{convert|34|mi|km}} south of [[Swindon]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} northwest of [[Southampton]] and {{convert|32|mi|km}} southeast of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].\n\n{{Geographic location\n| title = '''Settlements and geographic features near Salisbury'''\n| Centre = Salisbury\n| North = [[Stonehenge]]18&nbsp;km<br/>[[Amesbury]] 15&nbsp;km\n| Northeast = [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover 25&nbsp;km]]<br/>[[Basingstoke]] 45&nbsp;km\n| East = [[Winchester]] 30&nbsp;km\n| Southeast = [[Romsey]] 25&nbsp;km<br/>[[Southampton]] 30&nbsp;km\n| South = [[Ringwood]] 20&nbsp;km<br/>[[Bournemouth]] 35&nbsp;km\n| Southwest = [[Shaftesbury]] 25&nbsp;km\n| West = [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton 5&nbsp;km]]\n| Northwest = [[Warminster]] 30&nbsp;km\n}}\n\nThere are civil airfields at [[Old Sarum Airfield|Old Sarum]] (where the experimental aircraft the [[Edgley Optica]] was developed and tested) and at [[Thruxton, Hampshire|Thruxton]] near [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]].\n\n=== Areas and suburbs ===\nSalisbury has many areas and suburbs, most of them being former villages that were absorbed by the growth of the city.

Salisbury lies on the intersection of the [[A30 road|A30]], the [[A36 road|A36]] and the [[A338 road|A338]] and is at the end of the [[A343 road|A343]], [[A345 road|A345]], [[A354 road|A354]] and [[A360 road|A360]]. Car parks around the periphery of the city are linked to the city centre by a park and ride scheme (see details in the bus section below). The A36 forms an almost complete ring road around the city centre. The A3094 comprises the southwestern quadrant of the ring road, passing through the city's outer suburbs.\n\nThe lack of adequate roads is a cause of concern to the people of Salisbury: as there is no motorway to link the ports of [[Southampton]] and [[Bristol]], traffic passes around the city's ring-road via the A36 to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].\n\n=== Bus ===\nThere are bus links to [[Southampton]], [[Bournemouth]], Andover, [[Devizes]] and [[Swindon]], with limited services on Sundays. [[Salisbury Reds (bus company)|Salisbury Reds]], a brand of [[Go South Coast]], is the main local operator. Wheelers Travel provide services to [[Shaftesbury]] and Andover, as well as intermediate-distance services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wheelerstravel.co.uk/index.php?p=20|title=Bus times|website=Wheelers Travel|accessdate=16 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416200931/http://www.wheelerstravel.co.uk/index.php?p=20|archive-date=16 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Other operators include [[Stagecoach South|Stagecoach]] (Amesbury, Tidworth, Andover); Beeline (Warminster); and [[First West of England|First]] (Warminster, Trowbridge, Bath).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.firstgroup.com/uploads/maps/Bath_Service_265_Web.pdf|title=Service 265 from April 2017|website=First Group|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nSalisbury has a [[Park and Ride]] bus scheme with five sites around the city.

The city is approximately {{convert|20|mi|km}} from [[Southampton]] and {{convert|30|mi|km}} from [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].\n\nSalisbury is in the southeast of Wiltshire, near the edge of [[Salisbury Plain]]. [[Salisbury Cathedral]] was formerly north of the city at [[Old Sarum Cathedral|Old Sarum]]. Following the cathedral's relocation, a settlement grew up around it which received a city charter in 1227 as {{nowrap|New Sarum}}, which continued to be its official name until [[2009 structural changes to local government in England|2009]], when [[Salisbury City Council]] was established.

The [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] suffix  ''-d\u016bnon'', meaning \"fortress\" (in reference to the fort that stood at Old Sarum), was replaced by its [[Old English]] equivalent ''-burg''. The first part of the name is of obscure origin. The form \"Sarum\" is a Latinization of ''Sar'', a medieval abbreviation for [[Middle English]] ''Sarisberie''.<ref>Mills, David.

During his time in the city, the composer [[Handel]] stayed in a room above St Ann's gate. The original site of the city at Old Sarum, meanwhile, fell into disuse.

The riots occurred for related reasons, although the declining fortunes of Salisbury's cloth trade may also have been influential. The violence peaked with the murder of the bishop, [[William Ayscough]], who been involved with the government. In 1483, a large-scale rebellion against [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] broke out, led by his own 'kingmaker', [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]]. After the revolt collapsed, Buckingham was executed at Salisbury, near the Bull's Head Inn. In 1664, an [[Act of Parliament|act]] for making the [[River Avon, Hampshire|River Avon]] navigable from [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] to the city of New Sarum was passed<ref>17 Charles II.

He arrived to lead his approximately {{nowrap|19&thinsp;000}} men on 19 November 1688. His troops were not keen to fight Mary or her husband William, and the loyalty of many of James's commanders was in doubt. The first blood was shed at the [[Wincanton Skirmish]], in [[Somerset]]. In Salisbury, James heard that some of his officers had deserted, such as [[Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde]], and he broke out in a nosebleed, which he took as an omen that he should retreat. His commander in chief, the [[Louis de Duras, 2nd Earl of Feversham|Earl of Feversham]], advised retreat on 23 November, and the next day [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|John Churchill]] defected to William. On 26 November, James's own daughter, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne]], did the same, and James returned to London the same day, never again to be at the head of a serious military force in England.<ref>Childs, J.

It was once at the heart of the now defunct [[Salisbury (district)|Salisbury District]], which oversaw most of south Wiltshire as well as the city.  When Wiltshire's local government was reorganised under a [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]] in April 2009, Salisbury City Council was formed, although with fewer responsibilities than the former district council as it is now a parish.\n\nThree [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral wards]] \u2013 St Martin's and Cathedral, St Edmund and Milford and St Paul's \u2013 correspond roughly to the city centre, and the rest of the parish and city council area is covered by five further wards.

The geology of the area, as with much of South Wiltshire and [[Hampshire]], is largely chalk.  The rivers which flow through the city have been redirected, and along with landscaping, have been used to feed into public gardens.  They are popular in the summer, particularly in Queen Elizabeth Gardens, as the water there is shallow and slow-flowing enough to enter safely.  Close to Queen Elizabeth Gardens are [[water-meadow]]s, where the water is controlled by [[weir]]s.  Because of the low-lying land, the rivers are prone to flooding, particularly during the winter months.  The ''Town Path'', a walkway that links [[Harnham]] with the rest of the city, is at times impassable. Salisbury is approximately halfway between Exeter and London being 80 miles (128&nbsp;km) east-northeast of [[Exeter]], 78 miles (126&nbsp;km) west-southwest of [[London]] and also {{convert|34|mi|km}} south of [[Swindon]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} northwest of [[Southampton]] and {{convert|32|mi|km}} southeast of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].\n\n{{Geographic location\n| title = '''Settlements and geographic features near Salisbury'''\n| Centre = Salisbury\n| North = [[Stonehenge]]18&nbsp;km<br/>[[Amesbury]] 15&nbsp;km\n| Northeast = [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover 25&nbsp;km]]<br/>[[Basingstoke]] 45&nbsp;km\n| East = [[Winchester]] 30&nbsp;km\n| Southeast = [[Romsey]] 25&nbsp;km<br/>[[Southampton]] 30&nbsp;km\n| South = [[Ringwood]] 20&nbsp;km<br/>[[Bournemouth]] 35&nbsp;km\n| Southwest = [[Shaftesbury]] 25&nbsp;km\n| West = [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton 5&nbsp;km]]\n| Northwest = [[Warminster]] 30&nbsp;km\n}}\n\nThere are civil airfields at [[Old Sarum Airfield|Old Sarum]] (where the experimental aircraft the [[Edgley Optica]] was developed and tested) and at [[Thruxton, Hampshire|Thruxton]] near [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]].\n\n=== Areas and suburbs ===\nSalisbury has many areas and suburbs, most of them being former villages that were absorbed by the growth of the city. The boundaries of these areas are for the most part unofficial and not fixed.

The company was incorporated by a private [[Act of Parliament]] in 1864, and the Gas Orders Confirmation Act 1882 empowered it to raise capital of up to \u00a340,000.  At its peak, the gasworks were producing not only [[coal gas]] but also [[coke (fuel)|coke]], which was sold off as the by-product of gas-making.  Ammoniacal liquor, another by-product, was mixed with sulphuric acid, dried and ground to make a powder which was sold as an agricultural fertiliser. The clinker from the retort house was sold to a firm in London to be used as purifier beds in the construction of [[sewage works]].<ref>Watts, John (1991)''Salisbury Gasworks: The Salisbury Gas Light & Coke Company''  Salisbury: South Wiltshire Industrial Archaeology Society {{ISBN|0-906195-12-8}}</ref>\n\nFrom the Middle Ages to the start of the 20th century, Salisbury was noted for its [[Salisbury cutlery industry|cutlery industry]]. Early motor cars were manufactured in the city from 1902 by Dean and Burden Brothers, using the Scout Motors brand. In 1907 the company moved to a larger factory at Churchfields; each car took six to eight weeks to build, mostly using bodies made elsewhere by coachbuilders. By 1912, 150 men were employed and the company was also making small commercial vehicles and 20-seater buses, some of which were later used by the newly established [[Wilts & Dorset]] operator. The Scout company failed in 1921 after wartime disruption and competition from larger makers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wshc.eu/blog/item/scout-motors-of-salisbury.html|title=Scout Motors of Salisbury 1902\u20131921|last=|first=|date=24 January 2020|website=[[Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>\n[[File:Salisbury, Butchers Row.png|thumb|Butchers Row in the town centre]]\nShopping centres include The Old George Mall, The Maltings, Winchester Street and the Crosskeys precinct.

In the 18th century, [[John Constable]] made a number of celebrated [[landscape art|landscape paintings]] featuring the cathedral's spire and the surrounding countryside. Salisbury's annual International Arts Festival, started in 1973, and held in late May to early June, provides a programme of theatre, live music, dance, public sculpture, street performance and art exhibitions.

Car parks around the periphery of the city are linked to the city centre by a park and ride scheme (see details in the bus section below). The A36 forms an almost complete ring road around the city centre. The A3094 comprises the southwestern quadrant of the ring road, passing through the city's outer suburbs.\n\nThe lack of adequate roads is a cause of concern to the people of Salisbury: as there is no motorway to link the ports of [[Southampton]] and [[Bristol]], traffic passes around the city's ring-road via the A36 to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].\n\n=== Bus ===\nThere are bus links to [[Southampton]], [[Bournemouth]], Andover, [[Devizes]] and [[Swindon]], with limited services on Sundays.

Conservative Republicans and Democrats in Congress joined in the informal conservative coalition. By 1942\u20131943, they shut down relief programs such as the WPA and the CCC and blocked major liberal proposals. Nonetheless, Roosevelt turned his attention to the war effort and won reelection in 1940\u20131944. Furthermore, the Supreme Court declared the NRA and the first version of the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] (AAA) unconstitutional, but the AAA was rewritten and then upheld. Republican president [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (1953\u20131961) left the New Deal largely intact, even expanding it in some areas. In the 1960s, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]] used the New Deal as inspiration for a dramatic expansion of liberal programs, which Republican [[Richard Nixon]] generally retained. However, after 1974 the call for deregulation of the economy gained bipartisan support.<ref>, Martha Derthick, ''The Politics of Deregulation'' (1985), pp. 5\u20138.</ref> The New Deal regulation of banking ([[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]]) lasted until it was suspended in the 1990s.\n\nSeveral New Deal programs remain active and those operating under the original names include the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC), the [[Federal Crop Insurance Corporation]] (FCIC), the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) and the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA).

Assistant Attorney General [[Thurman Arnold]] led efforts that hearkened back to an anti-monopoly tradition rooted in American politics by figures such as Andrew Jackson and Thomas Jefferson. Supreme Court Justice [[Louis Brandeis]], an influential adviser to many New Dealers, argued that \"bigness\" (referring, presumably, to corporations) was a negative economic force, producing waste and inefficiency. However, the anti-monopoly group never had a major impact on New Deal policy.<ref>Leuchtenburg p. 34.</ref> Other leaders such as [[Hugh S. Johnson]] of the NRA took ideas from the [[Woodrow Wilson]] Administration, advocating techniques used to mobilize the economy for [[World War I]]. They brought ideas and experience from the government controls and spending of 1917\u20131918. Other New Deal planners revived experiments suggested in the 1920s, such as the TVA. The \"First New Deal\" (1933\u20131934) encompassed the proposals offered by a wide spectrum of groups (not included was the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]], whose influence was all but destroyed).<ref>Leuchtenburg p. 188.</ref> This first phase of the New Deal was also characterized by fiscal conservatism (see [[Economy Act]], below) and experimentation with several different, sometimes contradictory, cures for economic ills.\n\nThere were dozens of new agencies created by Roosevelt through Executive Orders. They are traditionally and typically known to Americans by their alphabetical initials.\n\n===The First 100 Days (1933)===\n{{main|First 100 days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency}}\nThe American people were generally extremely dissatisfied with the crumbling economy, mass unemployment, declining wages and profits and especially [[Herbert Hoover]]'s policies such as the [[Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act]] and the [[Revenue Act of 1932]]. Roosevelt entered office with enormous [[political capital]]. Americans of all political persuasions were demanding immediate action and Roosevelt responded with a remarkable series of new programs in the \"first hundred days\" of the administration, in which he met with Congress for 100 days. During those 100 days of lawmaking, Congress granted every request Roosevelt asked and passed a few programs (such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to insure bank accounts) that he opposed. Ever since, presidents have been judged against Roosevelt for what they accomplished in their first 100 days. [[Walter Lippmann]] famously noted: {{quote|At the end of February we were a congeries of disorderly panic-stricken mobs and factions. In the hundred days from March to June we became again an organized nation confident of our power to provide for our own security and to control our own destiny.<ref>[[Arthur M. Schlesinger]], ''The coming of the New Deal, 1933\u20131935'', Houghton Mifflin, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-618-34086-6}}, S. 22</ref>}}\n\nThe economy had hit bottom in March 1933 and then started to expand. Economic indicators show the economy reached its lowest point in the first days of March, then began a steady, sharp upward recovery. Thus the Federal Reserve Index of Industrial Production sank to its lowest point of 52.8 in July 1932 (with 1935\u20131939 = 100) and was practically unchanged at 54.3 in March 1933. However, by July 1933 it reached 85.5, a dramatic rebound of 57% in four months. Recovery was steady and strong until 1937. Except for employment, the economy by 1937 surpassed the levels of the late 1920s. The [[Recession of 1937\u201338|Recession of 1937]] was a temporary downturn. Private sector employment, especially in manufacturing, recovered to the level of the 1920s, but failed to advance further until the war. The U.S. population was 124,840,471 in 1932 and 128,824,829 in 1937, an increase of 3,984,468.<ref>{{cite web| title=NPG Historical U.S. Population Growth: 1900\u20131998| url=http://www.npg.org/facts/us_historical_pops.htm}}</ref> The ratio of these numbers, times the number of jobs in 1932, means there was a need for 938,000 more jobs in 1937, to maintain the same employment level.\n\n====Fiscal policy====\nThe [[Economy Act]], drafted by Budget Director [[Lewis Williams Douglas]], was passed on March 15, 1933. The act proposed to balance the \"regular\" (non-emergency) federal budget by cutting the salaries of government employees and cutting pensions to veterans by fifteen percent. It saved $500&nbsp;million per year and reassured deficit hawks, such as Douglas, that the new President was fiscally conservative. Roosevelt argued there were two budgets: the \"regular\" federal budget, which he balanced; and the emergency budget, which was needed to defeat the depression. It was imbalanced on a temporary basis.<ref>Leuchtenburg p. 45\u201346; Robert Paul Browder and Thomas G. Smith, ''Independent: A Biography of Lewis W. Douglass'' (1986)</ref>\n\nRoosevelt initially favored balancing the budget, but soon found himself running spending deficits to fund his numerous programs. However, Douglas\u2014rejecting the distinction between a regular and emergency budget\u2014resigned in 1934 and became an outspoken critic of the New Deal. Roosevelt strenuously opposed the [[Adjusted Compensation Payment Act|Bonus Bill]] that would give World War I veterans a cash bonus. Congress finally passed it over his veto in 1936 and the Treasury distributed $1.5&nbsp;billion in cash as bonus welfare benefits to 4&nbsp;million veterans just before the 1936 election.<ref>Leuchtenburg p. 171; Raymond Moley, ''The First New Deal'' (1966)</ref>\n\nNew Dealers never accepted the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] argument for government spending as a vehicle for recovery. Most economists of the era, along with [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]] of the Treasury Department, rejected Keynesian solutions and favored balanced budgets.<ref>Leuchtenburg pp. 171, 245\u201346; Herbert Stein, ''Presidential economics: The making of economic policy from Roosevelt to Reagan and beyond'' (1984)</ref>\n\n====Banking reform====\n[[File:American union bank.gif|thumb|upright=1.15|Crowd at New York's American Union Bank during a [[bank run]] early in the Great Depression]]\n[[File:Franklin-roosevelt.JPG|thumb|[[Franklin D.

The initial reasons were substantial losses in investment banking, followed by [[bank run]]s. Bank runs occurred when a large number of customers withdrew their deposits because they believed the bank might become insolvent. As the bank run progressed, it generated a self-fulfilling prophecy: as more people withdrew their deposits, the likelihood of default increased and this encouraged further withdrawals.\n\nMilton Friedman and Anna Schwartz have argued that the drain of money out of the banking system caused the monetary supply to shrink, forcing the economy to likewise shrink. As credit and economic activity diminished, price deflation followed, causing further economic contraction with disastrous impact on banks.<ref>Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, Monetary History of the United States, 1867\u20131960 (1963) pp. 340\u201343</ref> Between 1929 and 1933, 40% of all banks (9,490 out of 23,697 banks) failed.<ref>R.

Am 73#3 257\u201376.</ref>\n\nHerbert Hoover had already considered a bank holiday to prevent further bank runs, but rejected the idea because he was afraid to trip a panic. However, Roosevelt gave a radio address, held in the atmosphere of a [[Fireside Chat]], in which he explained to the public in simple terms the causes of the banking crisis, what the government would do, and how the population could help. He closed all the banks in the country, and kept them all closed until new legislation could be passed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,745289,00.html|title=THE PRESIDENCY: Bottom |work=Time|date=March 13, 1933|accessdate=October 11, 2008}}{{subscription}}</ref>\n\nOn March 9, 1933, Roosevelt sent to Congress the [[Emergency Banking Act]], drafted in large part by Hoover's top advisors. The act was passed and signed into law the same day. It provided for a system of reopening sound banks under [[United States Department of Treasury|Treasury]] supervision, with federal loans available if needed. Three-quarters of the banks in the [[Federal Reserve System]] reopened within the next three days. Billions of dollars in hoarded currency and gold flowed back into them within a month, thus stabilizing the banking system.<ref>Silber,  William L. \u201cWhy Did FDR\u2019s Bank Holiday Succeed?\u201d ''Federal Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review,'' (July 2009), pp 19-30 [https://archive.nyu.edu/jspui/bitstream/2451/26290/2/07-04.pdf online]</ref> By the end of 1933, 4,004 small local banks were permanently closed and merged into larger banks. Their deposits totalled $3.6&nbsp;billion: depositors lost a total of $540&nbsp;million and eventually received on average 85 cents on the dollar of their deposits\u2014it is a common myth that they received nothing back.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Anna Jacobson Schwartz|title=A Monetary History of the United States, 1867\u20131960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7J_EUM3RfoC&pg=PA427|year=1963|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00354-2|pages=438\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]] limited commercial bank securities activities and affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms to regulate speculations. It also established the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC), which insured deposits for up to $2,500, ending the risk of runs on banks.<ref>Susan E. Kennedy, ''The Banking Crisis of 1933'' (1973)</ref> This banking reform offered unprecedented stability as while throughout the 1920s more than five hundred banks failed per year, it was less than ten banks per year after 1933.<ref>Kennedy, ''Freedom From Fear'' (1999) pp. 65, 366</ref>\n\n====Monetary reform====\nUnder the [[gold standard]], the United States kept the dollar convertible to gold. The [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] would have had to execute an expansionary [[monetary policy]] to fight the deflation and to inject liquidity into the banking system to prevent it from crumbling\u2014but lower interest rates would have led to a gold outflow.<ref name=\" Randall E.

Parker 2003, p. 20\"/>\n\nIn March and April in a series of laws and executive orders, the government [[Executive Order 6102|suspended]] the gold standard. Roosevelt stopped the outflow of gold by forbidding the export of gold except under license from the Treasury. Anyone holding significant amounts of gold coinage was mandated to exchange it for the existing fixed price of U.S. dollars. The Treasury no longer paid out gold in exchange for dollars and gold would no longer be considered valid [[legal tender]] for debts in private and public contracts.<ref name=\"meltzer442\">{{Cite journal| title=A History of the Federal Reserve: 1913\u20131951|first=Allan H.|last=Meltzer|year=2004| pages=442\u201346}}</ref>\n\nThe dollar was allowed to float freely on [[foreign exchange market]]s with no guaranteed price in gold. With the passage of the [[Gold Reserve Act]] in 1934, the nominal price of gold was changed from $20.67 per troy ounce to $35. These measures enabled the Federal Reserve to increase the amount of money in circulation to the level the economy needed. Markets immediately responded well to the suspension in the hope that the decline in prices would finally end.<ref name=\"meltzer442\"/> In her essay \"What ended the Great Depression?\" (1992), [[Christina Romer]] argued that this policy raised industrial production by 25% until 1937 and by 50% until 1942.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Romer |first=Christina D. |date=December 1992 |title=What Ended the Great Depression? |journal=The Journal of Economic History |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=757\u201384 |jstor=2123226 |doi=10.1017/s002205070001189x|citeseerx=10.1.1.207.844 }}</ref>\n\n====Securities Act of 1933====\nBefore the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], there was no regulation of securities at the federal level. Even firms whose securities were publicly traded published no regular reports or even worse rather misleading reports based on arbitrarily selected data. To avoid another Wall Street Crash, the [[Securities Act of 1933]] was enacted. It required the disclosure of the balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and the names and compensations of corporate officers for firms whose securities were traded. Additionally, the reports had to be verified by independent auditors. In 1934, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] was established to regulate the stock market and prevent [[corporate abuses]] relating to corporate reporting and the sale of securities.<ref>Kennedy, ''Freedom From Fear'' (1999)  p. 367</ref>\n\n====Repeal of Prohibition====\nIn a measure that garnered substantial popular support for his New Deal, Roosevelt moved to put to rest one of the most divisive cultural issues of the 1920s. He signed the bill to legalize the manufacture and sale of alcohol, an interim measure pending the repeal of [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|prohibition]], for which a constitutional amendment of repeal (the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st]]) was already in process. The repeal amendment was ratified later in 1933. States and cities gained additional new revenue and Roosevelt secured his popularity especially in the cities and ethnic areas by legalizing alcohol.<ref>Leuchtenburg, ''Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal'' pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\n===Relief===\nRelief was the immediate effort to help the one-third of the population that was hardest hit by the depression. Relief was also aimed at providing temporary help to suffering and unemployed Americans. Local and state budgets were sharply reduced because of falling tax revenue, but New Deal relief programs were used not just to hire the unemployed but also to build needed schools, municipal buildings, waterworks, sewers, streets, and parks according to local specifications. While the regular Army and Navy budgets were reduced, Roosevelt juggled relief funds to provide for their claimed needs. All of the CCC camps were directed by army officers, whose salaries came from the relief budget. The PWA built numerous warships, including two aircraft carriers; the money came from the PWA agency.

Wallace]]. Roosevelt believed that full economic recovery depended upon the recovery of agriculture and raising farm prices was a major tool, even though it meant higher food prices for the poor living in cities.\n\nMany rural people lived in severe poverty, especially in the South. Major programs addressed to their needs included the [[Resettlement Administration]] (RA), the [[Rural Electrification Administration]] (REA), rural welfare projects sponsored by the WPA, [[National Youth Administration]] (NYA), Forest Service and [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC), including school lunches, building new schools, opening roads in remote areas, reforestation and purchase of marginal lands to enlarge national forests.\n\nIn 1933, the Roosevelt administration launched the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], a project involving dam construction planning on an unprecedented scale to curb flooding, generate electricity and modernize poor farms in the [[Tennessee Valley]] region of the Southern United States. Under the Farmers' Relief Act of 1933, the government paid compensation to farmers who reduced output, thereby raising prices. As a result of this legislation, the average income of farmers almost doubled by 1937.<ref name=\"Norman Lowe P.117\"/>\n\nIn the 1920s, farm production had increased dramatically thanks to mechanization, more potent insecticides and increased use of fertilizer. Due to an [[overproduction]] of agricultural products, farmers faced severe and chronic agricultural depression throughout the 1920s. The Great Depression even worsened the agricultural crises and at the beginning of 1933 agricultural markets nearly faced collapse.<ref>Paul S. Boyer, ''The Oxford Companion to United States History'', Oxford University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-19-508209-5}}, pp. 20, 21</ref> Farm prices were so low that in Montana wheat was rotting in the fields because it could not be profitably harvested. In Oregon, sheep were slaughtered and left to rot because meat prices were not sufficient to warrant transportation to markets.<ref>Peter Clemens, ''Prosperity, Depression and the New Deal: The USA 1890\u20131954, '' Hodder Education, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-340-965887}}, p. 106</ref>\n\nRoosevelt was keenly interested in farm issues and believed that true prosperity would not return until farming was prosperous. Many different programs were directed at farmers. The first 100 days produced the Farm Security Act to raise farm incomes by raising the prices farmers received, which was achieved by reducing total farm output. The [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] created the [[Agricultural Adjustment Administration]] (AAA) in May 1933. The act reflected the demands of leaders of major farm organizations (especially the [[Farm Bureau]]) and reflected debates among Roosevelt's farm advisers such as Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace, [[M.L. Wilson]], [[Rexford Tugwell]] and [[George Peek]].<ref>Schlesinger, ''Coming of the New Deal'' pp. 27\u201384</ref>\n\nThe AAA aimed to raise prices for commodities through [[artificial scarcity]]. The AAA used a system of domestic allotments, setting total output of corn, cotton, dairy products, hogs, rice, tobacco, and wheat. The farmers themselves had a voice in the process of using the government to benefit their incomes. The AAA paid land owners subsidies for leaving some of their land idle with funds provided by a new tax on food processing. To force up farm prices to the point of \"parity,\" {{convert|10|e6acre|km2}} of growing cotton was plowed up, bountiful crops were left to rot and six million piglets were killed and discarded.<ref>Ronald L. Heinemann, ''Depression and New Deal in Virginia''.

The AAA was replaced by a similar program that did win Court approval. Instead of paying farmers for letting fields lie barren, this program subsidized them for planting soil-enriching crops such as [[alfalfa]] that would not be sold on the market. Federal regulation of agricultural production has been modified many times since then, but together with large subsidies is still in effect today.\n\nThe Farm Tenancy Act in 1937 was the last major New Deal legislation that concerned farming. In turn, it created the [[Farm Security Administration]] (FSA), which replaced the Resettlement Administration.\n\nThe [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|Food Stamp Plan]]\u2014a major new welfare program for urban poor\u2014was established in 1939 to provide stamps to poor people who could use them to purchase food at retail outlets. The program ended during wartime prosperity in 1943 but was restored in 1961. It survived into the 21st century with little controversy because it was seen to benefit the urban poor, food producers, grocers, and wholesalers as well as farmers, thus it gained support from both liberal and conservative Congressmen. In 2013, [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] activists in the House nonetheless tried to end the program, now known as the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]], while the Senate fought to preserve it.<ref>Rachel Louise Moran, \"Consuming Relief: Food Stamps and the New Welfare of the New Deal,\" ''Journal of American History'', March 2011, Vol. 97 Issue 4, pp. 1001\u201322 [http://jah.oxfordjournals.org/content/97/4/1001.short online]</ref><ref>Alan Bjerga & Derek Wallbank, \"Food Stamps Loom Over Negotiations to Pass Farm Bill\" [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-30/food-stamps-loom-over-negotiations-to-pass-farm-bill.html ''Bloomberg'' Oct 30, 2013]</ref>\n\n===Recovery===\nRecovery was the effort in numerous programs to restore the economy to normal health.

Since 1931, the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]], the voice of the nation's organized business, promoted an anti-deflationary scheme that would permit trade associations to cooperate in government-instigated [[cartels]] to stabilize prices within their industries. While existing antitrust laws clearly forbade such practices, organized business found a receptive ear in the Roosevelt Administration.<ref>Bernard Bellush, ''The Failure of the NRA'', (1976)</ref>\n\nRoosevelt's advisers believed that excessive competition and technical progress had led to overproduction and lowered wages and prices, which they believed lowered demand and employment ([[deflation]]).

They rejected a strong move in Congress to limit the workweek to 30 hours. Instead their remedy, designed in cooperation with [[big business]], was the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA). It included stimulus funds for the WPA to spend and sought to raise prices, give more [[bargaining power]] for unions (so the workers could purchase more) and reduce harmful competition.\n\nAt the center of the NIRA was the National Recovery Administration (NRA), headed by former General [[Hugh S. Johnson]], who had been a senior economic official in World War I. Johnson called on every business establishment in the nation to accept a stopgap \"blanket code\": a minimum wage of between 20 and 45 cents per hour, a maximum workweek of 35\u201345 hours and the abolition of [[child labor]]. Johnson and Roosevelt contended that the \"blanket code\" would raise consumer purchasing power and increase employment.<ref>Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. ''The Coming of the New Deal'' (1959), 87\u2013135</ref> To mobilize political support for the NRA, Johnson launched the \"NRA [[National Recovery Administration|Blue Eagle]]\" publicity campaign to boost what he called \"industrial self-government\". The NRA brought together leaders in each industry to design specific sets of codes for that industry\u2014the most important provisions were anti-deflationary floors below which no company would lower prices or wages and agreements on maintaining employment and production. In a remarkably short time, the NRA announced agreements from almost every major industry in the nation.

The bill imposed an income tax of 79% on incomes over $5&nbsp;million. Since that was an extraordinary high income in the 1930s, the highest tax rate actually covered just one individual\u2014[[John D. Rockefeller]]. The bill was expected to raise only about $250&nbsp;million in additional funds, so revenue was not the primary goal. Morgenthau called it \"more or less a campaign document\". In a private conversation with Raymond Moley, Roosevelt admitted that the purpose of the bill was \"stealing [[Huey Long]]'s thunder\" by making Long's supporters of his own. At the same time, it raised the bitterness of the rich who called Roosevelt \"a traitor to his class\" and the wealth tax act a \"soak the rich tax\".<ref>{{cite book|author=David M.

This time the primary purpose was revenue, since Congress had enacted the [[Adjusted Compensation Payment Act]], calling for payments of $2&nbsp;billion to World War I veterans. The bill established the persisting principle that retained corporate earnings could be taxed. Paid dividends were tax deductible by corporations.

He proposed adding five new justices, but conservative Democrats revolted, led by the Vice President. The [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937]] failed\u2014it never reached a vote. Momentum in Congress and public opinion shifted to the right and very little new legislation was passed expanding the New Deal. However, retirements allowed Roosevelt to put supporters on the Court and it stopped killing New Deal programs.<ref>Jeff Jeff Shesol, ''Supreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt Vs.

Production and profits declined sharply. Unemployment jumped from 14.3% in May 1937 to 19.0% in June 1938. The downturn was perhaps due to nothing more than the familiar rhythms of the business cycle, but until 1937 Roosevelt had claimed responsibility for the excellent economic performance. That backfired in the recession and the heated political atmosphere of 1937.<ref>Kennedy, ''Freedom From Fear'' p. 352</ref>\n\nKeynes did not think that The New Deal under Roosevelt ended the Great Depression: \"It is, it seems, politically impossible for a capitalistic democracy to organize expenditure on the scale necessary to make the grand experiments which would prove my case \u2014 except in war conditions.\"<ref>Quoted by P.

Instead of competitive bidding to get lower prices, the government gave out contracts that promised to pay all the expenses plus a modest profit. Factories hired everyone they could find regardless of their lack of skills\u2014they simplified work tasks and trained the workers, with the federal government paying all the costs. Millions of farmers left marginal operations, students quit school and housewives joined the labor force.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jensen | first1 = Richard J. | authorlink = Richard J.

Industry quickly absorbed the slack in the labor force and the tables turned such that employers needed to actively and aggressively recruit workers. As the military grew, new labor sources were needed to replace the 12&nbsp;million men serving in the military. Propaganda campaigns started pleading for people to work in the war factories. The barriers for married women, the old, the unskilled\u2014and (in the North and West) the barriers for racial minorities\u2014were lowered.<ref>{{cite book|author=D'Ann Campbell|title=Women at war with America: private lives in a patriotic era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eA0-AAAAMAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=110\u201315|isbn=9780674954755}}</ref>\n\n===Federal budget soars===\nIn 1929, federal expenditures accounted for only 3% of GNP. Between 1933 and 1939, federal expenditures tripled, but the national debt as a percent of GNP showed little change. Spending on the war effort quickly eclipsed spending on New Deal programs. In 1944, government spending on the war effort exceeded 40% of GNP. The U.S. economy experienced dramatic growth during the Second World War mostly due to the deemphasis of free enterprise in favor of the imposition of strict controls on prices and wages. These controls shared broad support among labor and business, resulting in cooperation between the two groups and the U.S. government. This cooperation resulted in the government subsidizing business and labor through both direct and indirect methods.<ref>Vatter, ''The U.S. Economy in World War II''</ref>\n\n===Wartime welfare projects===\nConservative domination of Congress during the war meant that all welfare projects and reforms had to have their approval, which was given when business supported the project. For example, the Coal Mines Inspection and Investigation Act of 1941 significantly reduced fatality rates in the coal-mining industry, saving workers' lives and company money.<ref>Curtis E. Harvey, ''Coal in Appalachia: an economic analysis''</ref>  In terms of welfare, the New Dealers wanted benefits for everyone according to need. However, conservatives proposed benefits based on national service\u2014especially tied to military service or working in war industries\u2014and their approach won out.\n\nThe Community Facilities Act of 1940 (the Lanham Act) provided federal funds to defense-impacted communities where the population had soared and local facilities were overwhelmed. It provided money for the building of housing for war workers as well as recreational facilities, water and sanitation plants, hospitals, day care centers and schools.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sarah Jo Peterson|title=Planning the Home Front: Building Bombers and Communities at Willow Run|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wu55uzCZdpkC&pg=PA85|year=2013|pages=85\u201388|isbn=9780226025421}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Eve P.

Emergency grants to states were authorized in 1942 for programs for day care for children of working mothers. In 1944, pensions were authorized for all physically or mentally helpless children of deceased veterans regardless of the age of the child at the date the claim was filed or at the time of the veteran's death, provided the child was disabled at the age of sixteen and that the disability continued to the date of the claim.

One out of seven births was covered during its operation. EMIC paid $127 million to state health departments to cover the care of 1.2 million new mothers and their babies.

Bennett, ''When Dreams Came True: The GI Bill and the Making of Modern America'' (1999)</ref>\n\n===Fair Employment Practices===\n{{main|Fair Employment Practice Committee}}\nIn response to the March on Washington Movement led by A. Philip Randolph, Roosevelt promulgated Executive Order 8802 in June 1941, which established the President's Committee on Fair Employment Practices (FEPC) \"to receive and investigate complaints of discrimination\" so that \"there shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or government because of race, creed, color, or national origin\".<ref>Merl E.

The gap between rich and poor narrowed dramatically in the area of nutrition because food rationing and price controls provided a reasonably priced diet to everyone. White collar workers did not typically receive overtime and therefore the gap between white collar and blue collar income narrowed. Large families that had been poor during the 1930s had four or more wage earners and these families shot to the top one-third income bracket. Overtime provided large paychecks in war industries<ref>Kennedy, ''Freedom from Fear'' ch 18</ref> and average living standards rose steadily, with real wages rising by 44% in the four years of war, while the percentage of families with an annual income of less than $2,000 fell from 75% to 25% of the population.<ref>America in our time: from World War II to Nixon\u2014what happened and why by Godfrey Hodgson</ref>\n\nIn 1941, 40% of all American families lived on less than the $1,500 per year defined as necessary by the Works Progress Administration for a modest standard of living. The median income stood at $2,000 a year, while 8&nbsp;million workers earned below the legal minimum. From 1939 to 1944, wages and salaries more than doubled, with overtime pay and the expansion of jobs leading to a 70% rise in average weekly earnings during the course of the war. Membership in organized labor increased by 50% between 1941 and 1945 and because the War Labor Board sought labor-management peace, new workers were encouraged to participate in the existing labor organizations, thereby receiving all the benefits of union membership such as improved working conditions, better fringe benefits and higher wages. As noted by William H. Chafe, \"with full employment, higher wages and social welfare benefits provided under government regulations, American workers experienced a level of well-being that, for many, had never occurred before\".\n\nAs a result of the new prosperity, consumer expenditures rose by nearly 50%, from $61.7&nbsp;billion at the start of the war to $98.5&nbsp;billion by 1944. Individual savings accounts climbed almost sevenfold during the course of the war. The share of total income held by the top 5% of wage earners fell from 22% to 17% while the bottom 40% increased their share of the economic pie. In addition, during the course of the war the proportion of the American population earning less than $3,000 (in 1968 dollars) fell by half.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Unfinished Journey: America Since World War II by William H.

The Home Owners' Loan Corporation's purchases and refinancing of troubled mortgages staved off drops in housing prices and home ownership rates at relatively low ex post cost to taxpayers.

Zelizer, \"The Forgotten Legacy of the New Deal: Fiscal Conservatism and the Roosevelt Administration, 1933\u20131938,\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'', (2000) 30#2. pp 331+ [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=5001752830 online]</ref> A fiscally conservative approach was supported by [[Wall Street]] and local investors and most of the business community\u2014mainstream academic economists believed in it as apparently did the majority of the public. Conservative southern Democrats, who favored balanced budgets and opposed new taxes, controlled Congress and its major committees. Even liberal Democrats at the time regarded balanced budgets as essential to economic stability in the long run, although they were more willing to accept short-term deficits. As Zelizer notes, public opinion polls consistently showed public opposition to deficits and debt. Throughout his terms, Roosevelt recruited fiscal conservatives to serve in his administration, most notably [[Lewis Douglas]] the Director of Budget in 1933\u20131934; and [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]], Secretary of the Treasury from 1934 to 1945. They defined policy in terms of budgetary cost and tax burdens rather than needs, rights, obligations, or political benefits. Personally, Roosevelt embraced their fiscal conservatism, but politically he realized that fiscal conservatism enjoyed a strong wide base of support among voters, leading Democrats and businessmen. On the other hand, there was enormous pressure to act and spending money on high visibility work programs with millions of paychecks a week.<ref>Zelizer, \"The Forgotten Legacy of the New Deal: Fiscal Conservatism and the Roosevelt Administration, 1933\u20131938\"</ref>\n\nDouglas proved too inflexible and he quit in 1934. Morgenthau made it his highest priority to stay close to Roosevelt, no matter what. Douglas's position, like many of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]], was grounded in a basic distrust of politicians and the deeply ingrained fear that government spending always involved a degree of patronage and corruption that offended his Progressive sense of efficiency. The Economy Act of 1933, passed early in the Hundred Days, was Douglas's great achievement. It reduced federal expenditures by $500&nbsp;million, to be achieved by reducing veterans' payments and federal salaries. Douglas cut government spending through executive orders that cut the military budget by $125&nbsp;million, $75&nbsp;million from the Post Office, $12&nbsp;million from Commerce, $75&nbsp;million from government salaries and $100&nbsp;million from staff layoffs. As Freidel concludes: \"The economy program was not a minor aberration of the spring of 1933, or a hypocritical concession to delighted conservatives. Rather it was an integral part of Roosevelt's overall New Deal\".<ref>Freidel 1990, p. 96</ref>\n\nRevenues were so low that borrowing was necessary (only the richest 3% paid any income tax between 1926 and 1940).<ref>U.S. Bureau of the Census. ''Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1946''. p. 321.</ref> Douglas therefore hated the relief programs, which he said reduced business confidence, threatened the government's future credit and had the \"destructive psychological effects of making mendicants of self-respecting American citizens\".<ref>Zelizer, \"The Forgotten Legacy of the New Deal\"</ref> Roosevelt was pulled toward greater spending by Hopkins and Ickes and as the 1936 election approached he decided to gain votes by attacking big business.\n\nMorgenthau shifted with Roosevelt, but at all times tried to inject fiscal responsibility\u2014he deeply believed in balanced budgets, stable currency, reduction of the national debt and the need for more private investment. The Wagner Act met Morgenthau's requirement because it strengthened the party's political base and involved no new spending. In contrast to Douglas, Morgenthau accepted Roosevelt's double budget as legitimate\u2014that is a balanced regular budget and an \"emergency\" budget for agencies, like the WPA, PWA and CCC, that would be temporary until full recovery was at hand. He fought against the veterans' bonus until Congress finally overrode Roosevelt's veto and gave out $2.2&nbsp;billion in 1936. His biggest success was the new Social Security program as he managed to reverse the proposals to fund it from general revenue and insisted it be funded by new taxes on employees. It was Morgenthau who insisted on excluding farm workers and domestic servants from Social Security because workers outside industry would not be paying their way.<ref>Zelizer, \"The Forgotten Legacy of the New Deal: Fiscal Conservatism; Savage 1998</ref>\n\n===Race and gender===\n====African Americans====\nWhile many Americans suffered economically during the Great Depression, African Americans also had to deal with social ills, such as racism, discrimination and [[Racial segregation#United States 2|segregation]]. Black workers were especially vulnerable to the economic downturn since most of them worked the most marginal jobs such as unskilled or service-oriented work, therefore they were the first to be discharged and additionally many employers preferred white workers. When jobs were scarce some employers even dismissed black workers to create jobs for white citizens. In the end there were three times more African American workers on public assistance or relief than white workers.<ref>Hamilton Cravens, ''Great Depression: People and Perspectives'', ABC-CLIO, 2009, {{ISBN|9781598840933}}, p. 106</ref>\n\nRoosevelt appointed an unprecedented number of African Americans to second-level positions in his administration\u2014these appointees were collectively called the [[Black Cabinet]]. The WPA, NYA and CCC relief programs allocated 10% of their budgets to blacks (who comprised about 10% of the total population, and 20% of the poor). They operated separate all-black units with the same pay and conditions as white units.<ref name=\"Sitkoff1\"/> Some leading white New Dealers, especially [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Harold L. Ickes|Harold Ickes]] and [[Aubrey Willis Williams|Aubrey Williams]], worked to ensure blacks received at least 10% of welfare assistance payments.<ref name=\"Sitkoff1\">Sitkoff (2008)</ref> However, these benefits were small in comparison to the economic and political advantages that whites received. Most unions excluded blacks from joining and enforcement of anti-discrimination laws in the South was virtually impossible, especially since most blacks worked in hospitality and agricultural sectors.<ref>Ira Katznelson, ''When Affirmative Action was White'' (2005).</ref>\n\nThe New Deal programs put millions of Americans immediately back to work or at least helped them to survive.<ref>Hamilton Cravens, ''Great Depression: People and Perspectives'', ABC-CLIO, 2009, {{ISBN|9781598840933}}, pp. 105, 108</ref> The programs were not specifically targeted to alleviate the much higher unemployment rate of blacks.<ref name=\"Hamilton Cravens 2009, p. 108\">Hamilton Cravens, ''Great Depression: People and Perspectives'', ABC-CLIO, 2009, {{ISBN|9781598840933}}, p. 108.</ref> Some aspects of the programs were even unfavorable to blacks. The Agricultural Adjustment Acts for example helped farmers which were predominantly white, but reduced the need of farmers to hire tenant farmers or sharecroppers which were predominantly black. While the AAA stipulated that a farmer had to share the payments with those who worked the land this policy was never enforced.<ref>Hamilton Cravens, ''Great Depression: People and Perspectives'', ABC-CLIO, 2009, {{ISBN|9781598840933}}, p. 113.</ref> The Farm Service Agency (FSA), a government relief agency for tenant farmers, created in 1937, made efforts to empower African Americans by appointing them to agency committees in the South. Senator James F. Byrnes of South Carolina raised opposition to the appointments because he stood for white farmers who were threatened by an agency that could organize and empower tenant farmers. Initially, the FSA stood behind their appointments, but after feeling national pressure FSA was forced to release the African Americans of their positions. The goals of the FSA were notoriously liberal and not cohesive with the southern voting elite. Some New Deal measures inadvertently discriminated against harmed blacks. Thousands of blacks were thrown out of work and replaced by whites on jobs where they were paid less than the NRA's wage minimums because some white employers considered the NRA's minimum wage \"too much money for Negroes\". By August 1933, blacks called the NRA the \"Negro Removal Act\".<ref>Philip S. Foner.

Until 1936 almost all African Americans (and many whites) shifted from the \"Party of Lincoln\" to the Democratic Party.<ref name=\"Hamilton Cravens 2009, p. 108\"/> This was a sharp realignment from 1932, when most African Americans voted the Republican ticket. New Deal policies helped establish a political alliance between blacks and the Democratic Party that survives into the 21st century.<ref>Sitkoff (2008); Nancy J. Weiss, ''Farewell to the Party of Lincoln: Black Politics in the Age of FDR'' (1983)</ref>\n\nThere was no attempt whatsoever to end segregation, or to increase black rights in the South, and a number of leaders that promoted the New Deal were racist and anti semites.<ref name=\"Rothstein2017\">{{cite book|author=Richard Rothstein|title=The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SdtDDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT238|date=2 May 2017|publisher=Liveright|isbn=978-1-63149-286-0|pages=238\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe wartime [[Fair Employment Practice Committee|Fair Employment Practices Commission]] (FEPC) executive orders that forbade job discrimination against African Americans, women and ethnic groups was a major breakthrough that brought better jobs and pay to millions of minority Americans.

The critics emphasize the absence of a philosophy of reform to explain the failure of New Dealers to attack fundamental social problems. They demonstrate the New Deal's commitment to save capitalism and its refusal to strip away private property. They detect a remoteness from the people and indifference to participatory democracy and call instead for more emphasis on conflict and exploitation.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal | last1 = Auerbach | first1 = Jerold S. | year = 1969 | title = New Deal, Old Deal, or Raw Deal: Some Thoughts on New Left Historiography | journal = Journal of Southern History | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 18\u201330 | jstor=2204748| doi = 10.2307/2204748 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Unger | first1 = Irwin | year = 1967 | title = The 'New Left' and American History: Some Recent Trends in United States Historiography | journal = American Historical Review | volume = 72 | issue = 4| pages = 1237\u201363 | jstor=1847792| doi = 10.2307/1847792 }}</ref>\n\n====Women and the New Deal====\n[[File:FERA, Camps for Unemployed Women, Maine - NARA - 196588.tif|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] (FERA) camp for unemployed women in [[Maine]], 1934]]\nAt first, the New Deal created programs primarily for men as it was assumed that the husband was the \"[[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]]\" (the provider) and if they had jobs the whole family would benefit. It was the social norm for women to give up jobs when they married\u2014in many states, there were laws that prevented both husband and wife holding regular jobs with the government. So too in the relief world, it was rare for both husband and wife to have a relief job on FERA or the WPA.<ref>Children in the family were allowed to hold CCC or NYA jobs\u2014indeed, CCC jobs were normally given to young men whose fathers were on relief. Young women were eligible for NYA jobs which began in 1935.</ref> This prevailing social norm of the breadwinner failed to take into account the numerous households headed by women, but it soon became clear that the government needed to help women as well.<ref>Susan Ware, ''Beyond Suffrage: Women in the New Deal'' (1987)</ref>\n\nMany women were employed on FERA projects run by the states with federal funds. The first New Deal program to directly assist women was the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA), begun in 1935. It hired single women, widows, or women with disabled or absent husbands. The WPA employed about 500,000 women and they were assigned mostly to unskilled jobs. 295,000 worked on sewing projects that made 300 million items of clothing and bedding to be given away to families on relief and to hospitals and orphanages. Women also were hired for the WPA's school lunch program.<ref>Martha Swain, '\"The Forgotten Woman': Ellen S.

However, Social Security was not a relief program and it was not designed for short-term needs, as very few people received benefits before 1942.\n\n===Relief===\n[[File:This farmer is not on government relief.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Anti-relief protest sign near [[Davenport, Iowa]] by [[Arthur Rothstein]], 1940]]\nThe New Deal expanded the role of the federal government, particularly to help the poor, the unemployed, youth, the elderly and stranded rural communities. The Hoover administration started the system of funding state relief programs, whereby the states hired people on relief. With the CCC in 1933 and the WPA in 1935, the federal government now became involved in directly hiring people on relief in granting direct relief or benefits. Total federal, state and local spending on relief rose from 3.9% of GNP in 1929 to 6.4% in 1932 and 9.7% in 1934\u2014the return of prosperity in 1944 lowered the rate to 4.1%. In 1935\u20131940, welfare spending accounted for 49% of the federal, state and local government budgets.<ref>Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States'' (1975) p. 340 series H1 and H2</ref> In his memoirs, Milton Friedman said that the New Deal relief programs were an appropriate response.

According to [[Richard L. Jensen]], cyclical unemployment was a grave matter primarily until 1935. Between 1935 and 1941, [[structural unemployment]] became the bigger problem. Especially the unions successes in demanding higher wages pushed management into introducing new efficiency-oriented hiring standards.

They argued that by spending vastly more money\u2014using [[fiscal policy]]\u2014the government could provide the needed stimulus through the [[multiplier effect]]. Without that stimulus, business simply would not hire more people, especially the low skilled and supposedly \"untrainable\" men who had been unemployed for years and lost any job skill they once had. Keynes visited the White House in 1934 to urge President Roosevelt to increase [[deficit spending]]. Roosevelt afterwards complained that \"he left a whole rigmarole of figures \u2013 he must be a mathematician rather than a political economist\".<ref>W.

While [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]] argued in ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'' (1963) that the Federal Reserve System had made no attempt to increase the quantity in high-powered money and thus failed to foster recovery, they somehow did not investigate the impact of the monetary policy of the New Deal. In 1992, [[Christina Romer]] explained in \"What Ended the Great Depression?\" that the rapid growth in money supply beginning in 1933 can be traced back to a large unsterilized gold inflow to the U.S. which was partly due to political instability in Europe, but to a larger degree to the revaluation of gold through the Gold Reserve Act. The Roosevelt administration had chosen not to sterilize the gold inflow precisely because they hoped that the growth of money supply would stimulate the economy.<ref name=\"Romer 757\u2013784\"/>\n\nReplying to DeLong et al. in the ''Journal of Economic History'', J. R. Vernon argues that deficit spending leading up to and during World War II still played a large part in the overall recovery, according to his study \"half or more of the recovery occurred during 1941 and 1942\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Vernon |first=J.

Eggertsson and Christina Romer, the biggest primary impact of the New Deal on the economy and the key to recovery and to end the Great Depression was brought about by a successful management of public expectations. The thesis is based on the observation that after years of deflation and a very severe recession important economic indicators turned positive just in March 1933 when Roosevelt took office. Consumer prices turned from deflation to a mild inflation, industrial production bottomed out in March 1933, investment doubled in 1933 with a turnaround in March 1933. There were no monetary forces to explain that turnaround. Money supply was still falling and short-term interest rates remained close to zero. Before March 1933, people expected a further deflation and recession so that even interest rates at zero did not stimulate investment. However, when Roosevelt announced major regime changes people{{Who|date=May 2017}} began to expect inflation and an economic expansion. With those expectations, interest rates at zero began to stimulate investment just as they were expected to do. Roosevelt's fiscal and monetary policy regime change helped to make his policy objectives credible. The expectation of higher future income and higher future inflation stimulated demand and investments. The analysis suggests that the elimination of the policy dogmas of the gold standard, a balanced budget in times of crises and small government led endogenously to a large shift in expectation that accounts for about 70\u201380 percent of the recovery of output and prices from 1933 to 1937. If the regime change had not happened and the Hoover policy had continued, the economy would have continued its free-fall in 1933 and output would have been 30 percent lower in 1937 than in 1933.<ref>[http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.98.4.1476 Gauti B.

Historians like Arthur M. Schlesinger and James T. Patterson have argued that the augmentation of the federal government exacerbated tensions between the federal and state governments. However, contemporaries such as [[Ira Katznelson]] have suggested that due to certain conditions on the allocation of federal funds, namely that the individual states get to control them, the federal government managed to avoid any tension with states over their rights. This is a prominent debate concerning the historiography of [[federalism in the United States]] and\u2014as Schlesinger and Patterson have observed\u2014the New Deal marked an era when the federal-state power balance shifted further in favor of the federal government, which heightened tensions between the two levels of government in the United States.\n\n[[Ira Katznelson]] has argued that although the federal government expanded its power and began providing welfare benefits on a scale previously unknown in the United States, it often allowed individual states to control the allocation of the funds provided for such welfare. This meant that the states controlled who had access to these funds, which in turn meant many Southern states were able to racially segregate\u2014or in some cases, like a number of counties in Georgia, completely exclude African-Americans\u2014the allocation of federal funds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Katznelson|first=Ira|title=When Affirmative Action was White: An Untold History of Racial Inequality in Twentieth-Century America|year=2005|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|location=New York|page=37}}</ref> This enabled these states to continue to relatively exercise their rights and also to preserve the institutionalization of the racist order of their societies. While Katznelson has conceded that the expansion of the federal government had the potential to lead to federal-state tension, he has argued it was avoided as these states managed to retain some control. As Katznelson has observed, \"they [state governments in the South] had to manage the strain that potentially might be placed on local practices by investing authority in federal bureaucracies [...]. To guard against this outcome, they key mechanism deployed was a separation of the source of funding from decisions about how to spend the new monies\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Katznelson|first=Ira|title=When Affirmative Action was White: An Untold History of Racial Inequality in Twentieth-Century America|year=2005|publisher=W. W. Norton|location=New York|page=40}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Schlesinger has disputed Katznelson's claim and has argued that the increase in the power of the federal government was perceived to come at the cost of states' rights, thereby aggravating state governments, which exacerbated federal-state tensions. Schlesinger has utilized quotes from the time to highlight this point and has observed that \"the actions of the New Deal, [Ogden L.] Mills said, \"abolish the sovereignty of the States. They make of a government of limited powers one of unlimited authority over the lives of us all\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur M.|title=The Age of Roosevelt: The Coming of the New Deal|year=1958|publisher=The Riverside Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=473}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, Schlesinger has argued that this federal-state tension was not a one-way street and that the federal government became just as aggravated with the state governments as they did with it. State governments were often guilty of inhibiting or delaying federal policies. Whether through intentional methods, like sabotage, or unintentional ones, like simple administrative overload\u2014either way, these problems aggravated the federal government and thus heightened federal-state tensions. Schlesinger has also noted that \"students of public administration have never taken sufficient account of the capacity of lower levels of government to sabotage or defy even a masterful President\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur M.|title=The Age of Roosevelt: The Coming of the New Deal|year=1958|publisher=The Riverside Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=536}}</ref>\n\nJames T. Patterson has reiterated this argument, though he observes that this increased tension can be accounted for not just from a political perspective, but from an economic one too. Patterson has argued that the tension between the federal and state governments at least partly also resulted from the economic strain under which the states had been put by the federal government's various policies and agencies. Some states were either simply unable to cope with the federal government's demand and thus refused to work with them, or admonished the economic restraints and actively decided to sabotage federal policies. This was demonstrated, Patterson has noted, with the handling of federal relief money by Ohio governor, Martin L. Davey. The case in Ohio became so detrimental to the federal government that Harry Hopkins, supervisor of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, had to federalize Ohio relief.<ref>{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=James T.|title=The New Deal and the States: Federalism in Transition|url=https://archive.org/details/newdealstatesfed0000patt|url-access=registration|year=1969|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=[https://archive.org/details/newdealstatesfed0000patt/page/62 62]}}</ref> Although this argument differs somewhat from Schlesinger's, the source of federal-state tension remained the growth of the federal government. As Patterson has asserted, \"though the record of the FERA was remarkably good\u2014almost revolutionary\u2014in these respects it was inevitable, given the financial requirements imposed on deficit-ridden states, that friction would develop between governors and federal officials\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=James T.|title=The New Deal and the States: Federalism in Transition|url=https://archive.org/details/newdealstatesfed0000patt|url-access=registration|year=1969|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=[https://archive.org/details/newdealstatesfed0000patt/page/52 52]}}</ref>\n\nIn this dispute, it can be inferred that Katznelson and Schlesinger and Patterson have only disagreed on their inference of the historical evidence. While both parties have agreed that the federal government expanded and even that states had a degree of control over the allocation of federal funds, they have disputed the consequences of these claims. Katznelson has asserted that it created mutual acquiescence between the levels of government, while Schlesinger and Patterson have suggested that it provoked contempt for the state governments on the part of the federal government and vice versa, thus exacerbating their relations. In short, irrespective of the interpretation this era marked an important time in the historiography of federalism and also nevertheless provided some narrative on the legacy of federal-state relations.\n\n==Charges==\n{{see also|Criticism of Franklin D. Roosevelt}}\n\n===Charges of fascism===\n{{further|The New Deal and corporatism}}\nWorldwide, the Great Depression had the most profound impact in the [[German Reich]] and the United States. In both countries the pressure to reform and the perception of the economic crisis were strikingly similar. When Hitler came to power he was faced with exactly the same task that faced Roosevelt, overcoming mass unemployment and the global Depression. The political responses to the crises were essentially different: while American democracy remained strong, Germany replaced democracy with fascism, a Nazi dictatorship.<ref>Kiran Klaus Patel, ''Soldiers of Labor: Labor Service in Nazi Germany and New Deal America, 1933\u20131945'' Cambridge University Press 2005, pp. 3\u20135</ref>\n\nThe initial perception of the New Deal was mixed.

His argument correlates with Mason's that economic factors alone are an insufficient approach to understand fascism and that decisions taken by fascists in power cannot be explained within a logical economic framework. In economic terms, both ideas were within the general tendency of the 1930s to intervene in the free market capitalist economy, at the price of its ''laissez-faire'' character, \"to protect the capitalist structure endangered by endogenous crises tendencies and processes of impaired self-regulation\".<ref name=\"Daniel Woodley 2010, p.160, 161\"/>\n\n[[Stanley Payne]], a historian of fascism, examined possible fascist influences in the United States by looking at the KKK and its offshoots and movements led by Father Coughlin and [[Huey Long]]. He concluded that \"the various populist, nativist, and rightist movements in the United States during the 1920s and 1930s fell distinctly short of fascism\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Stanley G.

That changed in the 1960s when [[New Left]] historians began a revisionist critique calling the New Deal a bandaid for a patient that needed radical surgery to reform capitalism, put private property in its place and lift up workers, women and minorities.<ref>For a list of relevant works, see the list of suggested readings appearing toward the bottom of the article.</ref> The New Left believed in participatory democracy and therefore rejected the autocratic machine politics typical of the big city Democratic organizations.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn a 1968 essay, Barton J. Bernstein compiled a chronicle of missed opportunities and inadequate responses to problems. The New Deal may have saved capitalism from itself, Bernstein charged, but it had failed to help\u2014and in many cases actually harmed\u2014those groups most in need of assistance. In ''The New Deal'' (1967), Paul K. Conkin similarly chastised the government of the 1930s for its weak policies toward marginal farmers, for its failure to institute sufficiently progressive tax reform, and its excessive generosity toward select business interests. In 1966, [[Howard Zinn]] criticized the New Deal for working actively to actually preserve the worst evils of capitalism.\n\nBy the 1970s, liberal historians were responding with a defense of the New Deal based on numerous local and microscopic studies. Praise increasingly focused on Eleanor Roosevelt, seen as a more appropriate crusading reformer than her husband.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Krueger | first1 = Thomas A. | year = 1975 | title = New Deal Historiography at Forty | journal = Reviews in American History | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 483\u201388 | jstor=2701507| doi = 10.2307/2701507 }}</ref> Since then, research on the New Deal has been less interested in the question of whether the New Deal was a \"conservative\", \"liberal\", or \"revolutionary\" phenomenon than in the question of constraints within which it was operating.\n\nIn a series of articles, political sociologist [[Theda Skocpol]] has emphasized the issue of \"state capacity\" as an often-crippling constraint. Ambitious reform ideas often failed, she argued, because of the absence of a government bureaucracy with significant strength and expertise to administer them. Other more recent works have stressed the political constraints that the New Deal encountered. Conservative skepticism about the efficacy of government was strong both in Congress and among many citizens. Thus some scholars have stressed that the New Deal was not just a product of its liberal backers, but also a product of the pressures of its conservative opponents.\n\n===Communists in government===\nDuring the New Deal the communists established a network of a dozen or so members working for the government. They were low level and had a minor influence on policies. [[Harold Ware]] led the largest group which worked in the Agriculture Adjustment Administration (AAA) until Secretary of Agriculture Wallace got rid of them all in a famous purge in 1935.<ref>{{cite book|author=Arthur M.

As Arthur A. Ekirch Jr. (1971) has shown, the New Deal stimulated [[utopianism]] in American political and social thought on a wide range of issues. In Canada, Conservative Prime Minister Richard B. Bennett in 1935 proposed a \"new deal\" of regulation, taxation and social insurance that was a copy of the American program, but Bennett's proposals were not enacted and he was defeated for reelection in October 1935. In accordance with the rise of the use of U.S. political phraseology in Britain, the Labour government of [[Tony Blair]] termed some of its employment programs \"new deal\", in contrast to the Conservative Party's promise of the \"British Dream\".\n\n==Works of art and music==\n[[File:William Gropper - Construction of a Dam 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|The federal government commissioned a series of public murals from the artists it employed: [[William Gropper]]'s ''Construction of a Dam'' (1939) is characteristic of much of the art of the 1930s, with workers seen in heroic poses, laboring in unison to complete a great public project]]\nThe [[Works Progress Administration]] subsidized artists, musicians, painters and writers on relief with a group of projects called [[Federal One]]. While the WPA program was by far the most widespread, it was preceded by three programs administered by the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury]] which hired commercial artists at usual commissions to add murals and sculptures to federal buildings. The first of these efforts was the short-lived [[Public Works of Art Project]], organized by [[Edward Bruce (New Deal)|Edward Bruce]], an American businessman and artist. Bruce also led the Treasury Department's [[Section of Painting and Sculpture]] (later renamed the Section of Fine Arts) and the Treasury Relief Art Project (TRAP). The [[Resettlement Administration]] (RA) and [[Farm Security Administration]] (FSA) had major photography programs. The New Deal arts programs emphasized [[regionalism (art)|regionalism]], [[social realism]], [[class conflict]], [[proletarian]] interpretations and audience participation. The unstoppable collective powers of common man, contrasted to the failure of [[individualism]], was a favorite theme.<ref>Mathews 1975</ref><ref>William E. Leuchtenbrg.

''The New Deal: The National Level'' (Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1975) 310.</ref>\n\nMany writers chose to write about the New Deal and whether they were for or against it and if it was helping the country out.

''The New Deal: The National Level'' (Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1975) 312.</ref> Another subject that was very popular for novelists was the condition of labor. They ranged from subjects on social protest to strikes.<ref>John Braeman, Robert H. Bremner, David Brody. ''The New Deal: The National Level'' (Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1975) 314.</ref>\n\nUnder the WPA, the Federal Theatre project flourished. Countless theatre productions around the country were staged. This allowed thousands of actors and directors to be employed, among them were Orson Welles, and John Huston.<ref name=\"M.J.Heale. 1999\"/>\n\nThe FSA photography project is most responsible for creating the image of the Depression in the U.S. Many of the images appeared in popular magazines. The photographers were under instruction from Washington as to what overall impression the New Deal wanted to give out. Director [[Roy Stryker]]'s agenda focused on his faith in [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]], the poor conditions among cotton tenant farmers and the very poor conditions among migrant farm workers\u2014above all he was committed to social reform through New Deal intervention in people's lives. Stryker demanded photographs that \"related people to the land and vice versa\" because these photographs reinforced the RA's position that poverty could be controlled by \"changing land practices\". Though Stryker did not dictate to his photographers how they should compose the shots, he did send them lists of desirable themes, such as \"church\", \"court day\", \"barns\".<ref>Cara A. Finnegan. ''Picturing Poverty: Print Culture and FSA Photographs'' (Smithsonian Books, 2003) pp. 43\u201344</ref>\n\nFilms of the late New Deal era such as ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) ridiculed so-called \"great men\" while the heroism of the common man appeared in numerous movies, such as ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1940). Thus in [[Frank Capra]]'s famous films, including ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939), ''[[Meet John Doe]]'' (1941) and  ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946), the common people come together to battle and overcome villains who are corrupt politicians controlled by very rich, greedy capitalists.<ref>Harry M. Benshoff, Sean Griffin, ''America on film: representing race, class, gender, and sexuality at the movies'' (2003) pp. 172\u201374</ref>\n\nBy contrast, there was also a smaller but influential stream of anti-New Deal art. [[Gutzon Borglum]]'s sculptures on [[Mount Rushmore]] emphasized great men in history (his designs had the approval of [[Calvin Coolidge]]). [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]] disliked the New Deal and celebrated the autonomy of perfected written work as opposed to the New Deal idea of writing as performative labor. The [[Southern Agrarians]] celebrated a premodern regionalism and opposed the TVA as a modernizing, disruptive force. [[Cass Gilbert]], a conservative who believed architecture should reflect historic traditions and the established social order, designed the new Supreme Court building (1935). Its classical lines and small size contrasted sharply with the gargantuan [[Modernism|modernistic]] federal buildings going up in the Washington Mall that he detested.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1904306|title = Cass Gilbert, Architect: Conservative at Bay|journal = The Journal of American History|volume = 72|issue = 3|pages = 615\u2013636|last1 = Blodgett|first1 = Geoffrey|year = 1985|doi = 10.2307/1904306}}</ref> Hollywood managed to synthesize liberal and conservative streams as in [[Busby Berkeley]]'s ''Gold Digger'' musicals, where the storylines exalt individual autonomy while the spectacular musical numbers show abstract populations of interchangeable dancers securely contained within patterns beyond their control.<ref>Szalay 2000</ref>\n\n==New Deal programs==\nThe New Deal had many programs and new agencies, most of which were universally known by their [[Alphabet Agencies|initials]]. Most were abolished during [[World War II]] while others remain in operation today or formed into different programs. They included the following:\n* [[National Youth Administration]] (NYA), 1935: program that focused on providing work and education for Americans between the ages of 16 and 25.

The Supreme Court ruled the NIRA unconstitutional.\n* [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA), 1933: built large public works projects; used private contractors (did not directly hire unemployed). Ended 1938.\n* [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC): insures bank deposits and supervises state banks; still exists.\n* [[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]]: regulates investment banking; repealed 1999 (not repealed, only two provisions changed).\n* [[Securities Act of 1933]], created the SEC, 1933: codified standards for sale and purchase of stock, required awareness of investments to be accurately disclosed; still exists.[[File:Federal Emergency Relief Administration, FERA camps for unemployed women.

Roosevelt]] in the [[United States]] between 1933 and 1939. It responded to needs for relief, reform, and recovery from the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. Major federal programs and agencies included the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC), the [[Civil Works Administration]] (CWA), the [[Farm Security Administration]] (FSA), the [[National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933]] (NIRA) and the [[Social Security Administration]] (SSA). They provided support for farmers, the unemployed, youth and the elderly. The New Deal included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply. New Deal programs included both laws passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the [[presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt]].\n\nThe programs focused on what historians refer to as the \"3 Rs\": [[unemployment benefit|relief for the unemployed]] and poor, recovery of the economy back to normal levels, and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat [[Great Depression|depression]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Carol Berkin|title=Making America, Volume 2: A History of the United States: Since 1865|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p4B4QkdkTJsC&pg=PT273|year=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|pages=629\u2013632|isbn=978-0495915249|display-authors=etal}}</ref> The New Deal produced a political realignment, making the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] the majority (as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 to 1969) with its base in liberal ideas, [[Southern United States|the South]], [[political machine|big city machines]] and the newly empowered labor unions, and [[non-whites]] and [[ethnic white]]s.

Conservative Republicans and Democrats in Congress joined in the informal conservative coalition. By 1942\u20131943, they shut down relief programs such as the WPA and the CCC and blocked major liberal proposals. Nonetheless, Roosevelt turned his attention to the war effort and won reelection in 1940\u20131944. Furthermore, the Supreme Court declared the NRA and the first version of the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] (AAA) unconstitutional, but the AAA was rewritten and then upheld. Republican president [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (1953\u20131961) left the New Deal largely intact, even expanding it in some areas. In the 1960s, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]] used the New Deal as inspiration for a dramatic expansion of liberal programs, which Republican [[Richard Nixon]] generally retained. However, after 1974 the call for deregulation of the economy gained bipartisan support.<ref>, Martha Derthick, ''The Politics of Deregulation'' (1985), pp. 5\u20138.</ref> The New Deal regulation of banking ([[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]]) lasted until it was suspended in the 1990s.\n\nSeveral New Deal programs remain active and those operating under the original names include the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC), the [[Federal Crop Insurance Corporation]] (FCIC), the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) and the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA).

Assistant Attorney General [[Thurman Arnold]] led efforts that hearkened back to an anti-monopoly tradition rooted in American politics by figures such as Andrew Jackson and Thomas Jefferson. Supreme Court Justice [[Louis Brandeis]], an influential adviser to many New Dealers, argued that \"bigness\" (referring, presumably, to corporations) was a negative economic force, producing waste and inefficiency. However, the anti-monopoly group never had a major impact on New Deal policy.<ref>Leuchtenburg p. 34.</ref> Other leaders such as [[Hugh S. Johnson]] of the NRA took ideas from the [[Woodrow Wilson]] Administration, advocating techniques used to mobilize the economy for [[World War I]]. They brought ideas and experience from the government controls and spending of 1917\u20131918. Other New Deal planners revived experiments suggested in the 1920s, such as the TVA. The \"First New Deal\" (1933\u20131934) encompassed the proposals offered by a wide spectrum of groups (not included was the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]], whose influence was all but destroyed).<ref>Leuchtenburg p. 188.</ref> This first phase of the New Deal was also characterized by fiscal conservatism (see [[Economy Act]], below) and experimentation with several different, sometimes contradictory, cures for economic ills.\n\nThere were dozens of new agencies created by Roosevelt through Executive Orders. They are traditionally and typically known to Americans by their alphabetical initials.\n\n===The First 100 Days (1933)===\n{{main|First 100 days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency}}\nThe American people were generally extremely dissatisfied with the crumbling economy, mass unemployment, declining wages and profits and especially [[Herbert Hoover]]'s policies such as the [[Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act]] and the [[Revenue Act of 1932]]. Roosevelt entered office with enormous [[political capital]]. Americans of all political persuasions were demanding immediate action and Roosevelt responded with a remarkable series of new programs in the \"first hundred days\" of the administration, in which he met with Congress for 100 days. During those 100 days of lawmaking, Congress granted every request Roosevelt asked and passed a few programs (such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to insure bank accounts) that he opposed. Ever since, presidents have been judged against Roosevelt for what they accomplished in their first 100 days. [[Walter Lippmann]] famously noted: {{quote|At the end of February we were a congeries of disorderly panic-stricken mobs and factions. In the hundred days from March to June we became again an organized nation confident of our power to provide for our own security and to control our own destiny.<ref>[[Arthur M. Schlesinger]], ''The coming of the New Deal, 1933\u20131935'', Houghton Mifflin, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-618-34086-6}}, S. 22</ref>}}\n\nThe economy had hit bottom in March 1933 and then started to expand. Economic indicators show the economy reached its lowest point in the first days of March, then began a steady, sharp upward recovery. Thus the Federal Reserve Index of Industrial Production sank to its lowest point of 52.8 in July 1932 (with 1935\u20131939 = 100) and was practically unchanged at 54.3 in March 1933. However, by July 1933 it reached 85.5, a dramatic rebound of 57% in four months. Recovery was steady and strong until 1937. Except for employment, the economy by 1937 surpassed the levels of the late 1920s. The [[Recession of 1937\u201338|Recession of 1937]] was a temporary downturn. Private sector employment, especially in manufacturing, recovered to the level of the 1920s, but failed to advance further until the war. The U.S. population was 124,840,471 in 1932 and 128,824,829 in 1937, an increase of 3,984,468.<ref>{{cite web| title=NPG Historical U.S. Population Growth: 1900\u20131998| url=http://www.npg.org/facts/us_historical_pops.htm}}</ref> The ratio of these numbers, times the number of jobs in 1932, means there was a need for 938,000 more jobs in 1937, to maintain the same employment level.\n\n====Fiscal policy====\nThe [[Economy Act]], drafted by Budget Director [[Lewis Williams Douglas]], was passed on March 15, 1933. The act proposed to balance the \"regular\" (non-emergency) federal budget by cutting the salaries of government employees and cutting pensions to veterans by fifteen percent. It saved $500&nbsp;million per year and reassured deficit hawks, such as Douglas, that the new President was fiscally conservative. Roosevelt argued there were two budgets: the \"regular\" federal budget, which he balanced; and the emergency budget, which was needed to defeat the depression. It was imbalanced on a temporary basis.<ref>Leuchtenburg p. 45\u201346; Robert Paul Browder and Thomas G. Smith, ''Independent: A Biography of Lewis W. Douglass'' (1986)</ref>\n\nRoosevelt initially favored balancing the budget, but soon found himself running spending deficits to fund his numerous programs. However, Douglas\u2014rejecting the distinction between a regular and emergency budget\u2014resigned in 1934 and became an outspoken critic of the New Deal. Roosevelt strenuously opposed the [[Adjusted Compensation Payment Act|Bonus Bill]] that would give World War I veterans a cash bonus. Congress finally passed it over his veto in 1936 and the Treasury distributed $1.5&nbsp;billion in cash as bonus welfare benefits to 4&nbsp;million veterans just before the 1936 election.<ref>Leuchtenburg p. 171; Raymond Moley, ''The First New Deal'' (1966)</ref>\n\nNew Dealers never accepted the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] argument for government spending as a vehicle for recovery. Most economists of the era, along with [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]] of the Treasury Department, rejected Keynesian solutions and favored balanced budgets.<ref>Leuchtenburg pp. 171, 245\u201346; Herbert Stein, ''Presidential economics: The making of economic policy from Roosevelt to Reagan and beyond'' (1984)</ref>\n\n====Banking reform====\n[[File:American union bank.gif|thumb|upright=1.15|Crowd at New York's American Union Bank during a [[bank run]] early in the Great Depression]]\n[[File:Franklin-roosevelt.JPG|thumb|[[Franklin D.

The initial reasons were substantial losses in investment banking, followed by [[bank run]]s. Bank runs occurred when a large number of customers withdrew their deposits because they believed the bank might become insolvent. As the bank run progressed, it generated a self-fulfilling prophecy: as more people withdrew their deposits, the likelihood of default increased and this encouraged further withdrawals.\n\nMilton Friedman and Anna Schwartz have argued that the drain of money out of the banking system caused the monetary supply to shrink, forcing the economy to likewise shrink. As credit and economic activity diminished, price deflation followed, causing further economic contraction with disastrous impact on banks.<ref>Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, Monetary History of the United States, 1867\u20131960 (1963) pp. 340\u201343</ref> Between 1929 and 1933, 40% of all banks (9,490 out of 23,697 banks) failed.<ref>R.

Am 73#3 257\u201376.</ref>\n\nHerbert Hoover had already considered a bank holiday to prevent further bank runs, but rejected the idea because he was afraid to trip a panic. However, Roosevelt gave a radio address, held in the atmosphere of a [[Fireside Chat]], in which he explained to the public in simple terms the causes of the banking crisis, what the government would do, and how the population could help. He closed all the banks in the country, and kept them all closed until new legislation could be passed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,745289,00.html|title=THE PRESIDENCY: Bottom |work=Time|date=March 13, 1933|accessdate=October 11, 2008}}{{subscription}}</ref>\n\nOn March 9, 1933, Roosevelt sent to Congress the [[Emergency Banking Act]], drafted in large part by Hoover's top advisors. The act was passed and signed into law the same day. It provided for a system of reopening sound banks under [[United States Department of Treasury|Treasury]] supervision, with federal loans available if needed. Three-quarters of the banks in the [[Federal Reserve System]] reopened within the next three days. Billions of dollars in hoarded currency and gold flowed back into them within a month, thus stabilizing the banking system.<ref>Silber,  William L. \u201cWhy Did FDR\u2019s Bank Holiday Succeed?\u201d ''Federal Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review,'' (July 2009), pp 19-30 [https://archive.nyu.edu/jspui/bitstream/2451/26290/2/07-04.pdf online]</ref> By the end of 1933, 4,004 small local banks were permanently closed and merged into larger banks.

It also established the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC), which insured deposits for up to $2,500, ending the risk of runs on banks.<ref>Susan E.

The [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] would have had to execute an expansionary [[monetary policy]] to fight the deflation and to inject liquidity into the banking system to prevent it from crumbling\u2014but lower interest rates would have led to a gold outflow.<ref name=\" Randall E.

Parker 2003, p. 20\"/>\n\nIn March and April in a series of laws and executive orders, the government [[Executive Order 6102|suspended]] the gold standard. Roosevelt stopped the outflow of gold by forbidding the export of gold except under license from the Treasury. Anyone holding significant amounts of gold coinage was mandated to exchange it for the existing fixed price of U.S. dollars. The Treasury no longer paid out gold in exchange for dollars and gold would no longer be considered valid [[legal tender]] for debts in private and public contracts.<ref name=\"meltzer442\">{{Cite journal| title=A History of the Federal Reserve: 1913\u20131951|first=Allan H.|last=Meltzer|year=2004| pages=442\u201346}}</ref>\n\nThe dollar was allowed to float freely on [[foreign exchange market]]s with no guaranteed price in gold. With the passage of the [[Gold Reserve Act]] in 1934, the nominal price of gold was changed from $20.67 per troy ounce to $35. These measures enabled the Federal Reserve to increase the amount of money in circulation to the level the economy needed. Markets immediately responded well to the suspension in the hope that the decline in prices would finally end.<ref name=\"meltzer442\"/> In her essay \"What ended the Great Depression?\" (1992), [[Christina Romer]] argued that this policy raised industrial production by 25% until 1937 and by 50% until 1942.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Romer |first=Christina D. |date=December 1992 |title=What Ended the Great Depression? |journal=The Journal of Economic History |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=757\u201384 |jstor=2123226 |doi=10.1017/s002205070001189x|citeseerx=10.1.1.207.844 }}</ref>\n\n====Securities Act of 1933====\nBefore the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], there was no regulation of securities at the federal level. Even firms whose securities were publicly traded published no regular reports or even worse rather misleading reports based on arbitrarily selected data. To avoid another Wall Street Crash, the [[Securities Act of 1933]] was enacted. It required the disclosure of the balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and the names and compensations of corporate officers for firms whose securities were traded. Additionally, the reports had to be verified by independent auditors. In 1934, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] was established to regulate the stock market and prevent [[corporate abuses]] relating to corporate reporting and the sale of securities.<ref>Kennedy, ''Freedom From Fear'' (1999)  p. 367</ref>\n\n====Repeal of Prohibition====\nIn a measure that garnered substantial popular support for his New Deal, Roosevelt moved to put to rest one of the most divisive cultural issues of the 1920s. He signed the bill to legalize the manufacture and sale of alcohol, an interim measure pending the repeal of [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|prohibition]], for which a constitutional amendment of repeal (the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st]]) was already in process. The repeal amendment was ratified later in 1933. States and cities gained additional new revenue and Roosevelt secured his popularity especially in the cities and ethnic areas by legalizing alcohol.<ref>Leuchtenburg, ''Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal'' pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\n===Relief===\nRelief was the immediate effort to help the one-third of the population that was hardest hit by the depression. Relief was also aimed at providing temporary help to suffering and unemployed Americans. Local and state budgets were sharply reduced because of falling tax revenue, but New Deal relief programs were used not just to hire the unemployed but also to build needed schools, municipal buildings, waterworks, sewers, streets, and parks according to local specifications. While the regular Army and Navy budgets were reduced, Roosevelt juggled relief funds to provide for their claimed needs. All of the CCC camps were directed by army officers, whose salaries came from the relief budget. The PWA built numerous warships, including two aircraft carriers; the money came from the PWA agency. PWA also built warplanes, while the WPA built military bases and airfields.<ref>{{cite book|author=Conrad Black|title=Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJA3BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA348|year= 2012|page=348|isbn=9781610392136}}</ref>\n\n====Public works====\n[[File:PWAPBD restored.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Public Works Administration|Public Works Administration Project]] [[Bonneville Dam]]]]\nTo prime the pump and cut unemployment, the NIRA created the [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA), a major program of public works, which organized and provided funds for the building of useful works such as government buildings, airports, hospitals, schools, roads, bridges and dams.<ref name=\" Norman Lowe P.117\">Mastering Modern World History by Norman Lowe, second edition, p. 117</ref> From 1933 to 1935 PWA spent $3.3&nbsp; billion with private companies to build 34,599 projects, many of them quite large.<ref>Leuchtenburg pp. 70, 133\u201334; Jason Scott Smith, ''Building New Deal Liberalism: The Political Economy of Public Works, 1933\u20131956'' (2005)</ref>\n\nUnder Roosevelt, many unemployed persons were put to work on a wide range of government-financed public works projects, building bridges, airports, dams, post offices, hospitals and hundreds of thousands of miles of road. Through reforestation and flood control, they reclaimed millions of hectares of soil from erosion and devastation. As noted by one authority, Roosevelt's New Deal \"was literally stamped on the American landscape\".<ref>Time-Life Books, Library of Nations: United States, Sixth European English language printing, 1989{{Page needed|date=December 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Farm and rural programs====\n[[File: TVA water supply Wilder.gif|thumb|upright=1.15|Pumping water by hand from the sole water supply in this section of [[Wilder, Tennessee]] ([[Tennessee Valley Authority]], 1942)]]\nThe rural U.S.  was a high priority for Roosevelt and his energetic Secretary of Agriculture, [[Henry A. Wallace]]. Roosevelt believed that full economic recovery depended upon the recovery of agriculture and raising farm prices was a major tool, even though it meant higher food prices for the poor living in cities.\n\nMany rural people lived in severe poverty, especially in the South. Major programs addressed to their needs included the [[Resettlement Administration]] (RA), the [[Rural Electrification Administration]] (REA), rural welfare projects sponsored by the WPA, [[National Youth Administration]] (NYA), Forest Service and [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC), including school lunches, building new schools, opening roads in remote areas, reforestation and purchase of marginal lands to enlarge national forests.\n\nIn 1933, the Roosevelt administration launched the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], a project involving dam construction planning on an unprecedented scale to curb flooding, generate electricity and modernize poor farms in the [[Tennessee Valley]] region of the Southern United States. Under the Farmers' Relief Act of 1933, the government paid compensation to farmers who reduced output, thereby raising prices. As a result of this legislation, the average income of farmers almost doubled by 1937.<ref name=\"Norman Lowe P.117\"/>\n\nIn the 1920s, farm production had increased dramatically thanks to mechanization, more potent insecticides and increased use of fertilizer. Due to an [[overproduction]] of agricultural products, farmers faced severe and chronic agricultural depression throughout the 1920s. The Great Depression even worsened the agricultural crises and at the beginning of 1933 agricultural markets nearly faced collapse.<ref>Paul S. Boyer, ''The Oxford Companion to United States History'', Oxford University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-19-508209-5}}, pp. 20, 21</ref> Farm prices were so low that in Montana wheat was rotting in the fields because it could not be profitably harvested.

Many different programs were directed at farmers. The first 100 days produced the Farm Security Act to raise farm incomes by raising the prices farmers received, which was achieved by reducing total farm output. The [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] created the [[Agricultural Adjustment Administration]] (AAA) in May 1933. The act reflected the demands of leaders of major farm organizations (especially the [[Farm Bureau]]) and reflected debates among Roosevelt's farm advisers such as Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace, [[M.L. Wilson]], [[Rexford Tugwell]] and [[George Peek]].<ref>Schlesinger, ''Coming of the New Deal'' pp. 27\u201384</ref>\n\nThe AAA aimed to raise prices for commodities through [[artificial scarcity]]. The AAA used a system of domestic allotments, setting total output of corn, cotton, dairy products, hogs, rice, tobacco, and wheat. The farmers themselves had a voice in the process of using the government to benefit their incomes. The AAA paid land owners subsidies for leaving some of their land idle with funds provided by a new tax on food processing. To force up farm prices to the point of \"parity,\" {{convert|10|e6acre|km2}} of growing cotton was plowed up, bountiful crops were left to rot and six million piglets were killed and discarded.<ref>Ronald L.

The AAA was replaced by a similar program that did win Court approval. Instead of paying farmers for letting fields lie barren, this program subsidized them for planting soil-enriching crops such as [[alfalfa]] that would not be sold on the market. Federal regulation of agricultural production has been modified many times since then, but together with large subsidies is still in effect today.\n\nThe Farm Tenancy Act in 1937 was the last major New Deal legislation that concerned farming. In turn, it created the [[Farm Security Administration]] (FSA), which replaced the Resettlement Administration.\n\nThe [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|Food Stamp Plan]]\u2014a major new welfare program for urban poor\u2014was established in 1939 to provide stamps to poor people who could use them to purchase food at retail outlets. The program ended during wartime prosperity in 1943 but was restored in 1961. It survived into the 21st century with little controversy because it was seen to benefit the urban poor, food producers, grocers, and wholesalers as well as farmers, thus it gained support from both liberal and conservative Congressmen. In 2013, [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] activists in the House nonetheless tried to end the program, now known as the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]], while the Senate fought to preserve it.<ref>Rachel Louise Moran, \"Consuming Relief: Food Stamps and the New Welfare of the New Deal,\" ''Journal of American History'', March 2011, Vol. 97 Issue 4, pp. 1001\u201322 [http://jah.oxfordjournals.org/content/97/4/1001.short online]</ref><ref>Alan Bjerga & Derek Wallbank, \"Food Stamps Loom Over Negotiations to Pass Farm Bill\" [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-30/food-stamps-loom-over-negotiations-to-pass-farm-bill.html ''Bloomberg'' Oct 30, 2013]</ref>\n\n===Recovery===\nRecovery was the effort in numerous programs to restore the economy to normal health. By most economic indicators, this was achieved by 1937\u2014except for unemployment, which remained stubbornly high until World War II began. Recovery was designed to help the economy bounce back from depression. Economic historians led by Price Fishback have examined the impact of New Deal spending on improving health conditions in the 114 largest cities, 1929\u20131937.  They estimated that every additional $153,000 in relief spending  (in 1935 dollars, or $1.95 million in year 2000 dollars) was associated with a reduction of one infant death, one suicide and 2.4 deaths from infectious disease.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Whaples and Randall E.

Since 1931, the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]], the voice of the nation's organized business, promoted an anti-deflationary scheme that would permit trade associations to cooperate in government-instigated [[cartels]] to stabilize prices within their industries. While existing antitrust laws clearly forbade such practices, organized business found a receptive ear in the Roosevelt Administration.<ref>Bernard Bellush, ''The Failure of the NRA'', (1976)</ref>\n\nRoosevelt's advisers believed that excessive competition and technical progress had led to overproduction and lowered wages and prices, which they believed lowered demand and employment ([[deflation]]).

They rejected a strong move in Congress to limit the workweek to 30 hours. Instead their remedy, designed in cooperation with [[big business]], was the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA). It included stimulus funds for the WPA to spend and sought to raise prices, give more [[bargaining power]] for unions (so the workers could purchase more) and reduce harmful competition.\n\nAt the center of the NIRA was the National Recovery Administration (NRA), headed by former General [[Hugh S. Johnson]], who had been a senior economic official in World War I. Johnson called on every business establishment in the nation to accept a stopgap \"blanket code\": a minimum wage of between 20 and 45 cents per hour, a maximum workweek of 35\u201345 hours and the abolition of [[child labor]]. Johnson and Roosevelt contended that the \"blanket code\" would raise consumer purchasing power and increase employment.<ref>Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. ''The Coming of the New Deal'' (1959), 87\u2013135</ref> To mobilize political support for the NRA, Johnson launched the \"NRA [[National Recovery Administration|Blue Eagle]]\" publicity campaign to boost what he called \"industrial self-government\". The NRA brought together leaders in each industry to design specific sets of codes for that industry\u2014the most important provisions were anti-deflationary floors below which no company would lower prices or wages and agreements on maintaining employment and production. In a remarkably short time, the NRA announced agreements from almost every major industry in the nation.

Reforms targeted the causes of the depression and sought to prevent a crisis like it from happening again.

Historians refer to them as the \"Second New Deal\" and note that it was more liberal and more controversial than the \"First New Deal\" of 1933\u20131934.\n\n===Social Security Act===\n[[File:SocialSecurityposter1.gif|thumb|upright=1.15|A poster publicizing [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits]]\nUntil 1935 there were just a dozen states that had old-age insurance laws, but these programs were woefully underfunded and therefore almost worthless. Just one state (Wisconsin) had an insurance program. The United States was the only modern industrial country where people faced the Depression without any national system of social security. The work programs of the \"First New Deal\" such as CWA and FERA were designed for immediate relief, for a year or two.<ref>David M. Kennedy, ''Freedom From Fear, The American People in Depression and War 1929\u20131945'', (1999) p. 258, 260</ref>\n\nThe most important program of 1935 and perhaps the New Deal as a whole was the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Act]]. It established a permanent system of universal retirement pensions ([[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]), [[Unemployment insurance#United States|unemployment insurance]] and welfare benefits for the handicapped and needy children in families without a father present.<ref>Sitkoff, ed. ''Fifty Years Later: The New Deal Evaluated'' (1984)</ref> It established the framework for the U.S. welfare system. Roosevelt insisted that it should be funded by payroll taxes rather than from the general fund''\u2014''he said: \"We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and unemployment benefits.

The Act also established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to facilitate wage agreements and to suppress the repeated labor disturbances. The Wagner Act did not compel employers to reach agreement with their employees, but it opened possibilities for American labor.<ref>David M.

Labor thus became a major component of the New Deal political coalition. However, the intense battle for members between the AFL and the CIO coalitions weakened labor's power.<ref>Irving Bernstein, \"The Growth of American Unions,\" ''American Economic Review'' 44#3 (1954), pp. 301\u2013318 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1810803 online]</ref>\n\nThe [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] set maximum hours (44 per week) and minimum wages (25 cents per hour) for most categories of workers. [[Child labor]] of children under the age of 16 was forbidden, children under 18 years were forbidden to work in hazardous employment. As a result, the wages of 300,000 workers, especially in the South, were increased and the hours of 1.3&nbsp; million were reduced.<ref name=\" Clemens, p. 109\">Clemens, ''Prosperity, Depression, and the New Deal: The USA 1890\u20131954'' p. 109</ref> It was the last major New Deal legislation and it passed with support of Northern industrialists who wanted to stop the drain of jobs to the low-wage South.<ref name=\"lubell1955\">{{cite book | title=The Future of American Politics | publisher=Anchor Press | author=Lubell, Samuel | year=1955 | page=13}}</ref>\n\n===Works Progress Administration===\n[[File:New York City municipal airports, WPA poster, ca. 1937.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) poster promoting the [[LaGuardia Airport]] project (1937)]]\nRoosevelt nationalized unemployment relief through the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA), headed by close friend [[Harry Hopkins]].

The bill imposed an income tax of 79% on incomes over $5&nbsp;million. Since that was an extraordinary high income in the 1930s, the highest tax rate actually covered just one individual\u2014[[John D. Rockefeller]]. The bill was expected to raise only about $250&nbsp;million in additional funds, so revenue was not the primary goal. Morgenthau called it \"more or less a campaign document\". In a private conversation with Raymond Moley, Roosevelt admitted that the purpose of the bill was \"stealing [[Huey Long]]'s thunder\" by making Long's supporters of his own. At the same time, it raised the bitterness of the rich who called Roosevelt \"a traitor to his class\" and the wealth tax act a \"soak the rich tax\".<ref>{{cite book|author=David M.

This time the primary purpose was revenue, since Congress had enacted the [[Adjusted Compensation Payment Act]], calling for payments of $2&nbsp;billion to World War I veterans. The bill established the persisting principle that retained corporate earnings could be taxed. Paid dividends were tax deductible by corporations. Its proponents intended the bill to replace all other corporation taxes\u2014believing this would stimulate corporations to distribute earnings and thus put more cash and spending power in the hands of individuals.<ref name=McNultyinKirchhof>John K.

He proposed adding five new justices, but conservative Democrats revolted, led by the Vice President. The [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937]] failed\u2014it never reached a vote. Momentum in Congress and public opinion shifted to the right and very little new legislation was passed expanding the New Deal. However, retirements allowed Roosevelt to put supporters on the Court and it stopped killing New Deal programs.<ref>Jeff Jeff Shesol, ''Supreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt Vs.

Production and profits declined sharply. Unemployment jumped from 14.3% in May 1937 to 19.0% in June 1938. The downturn was perhaps due to nothing more than the familiar rhythms of the business cycle, but until 1937 Roosevelt had claimed responsibility for the excellent economic performance. That backfired in the recession and the heated political atmosphere of 1937.<ref>Kennedy, ''Freedom From Fear'' p. 352</ref>\n\nKeynes did not think that The New Deal under Roosevelt ended the Great Depression: \"It is, it seems, politically impossible for a capitalistic democracy to organize expenditure on the scale necessary to make the grand experiments which would prove my case \u2014 except in war conditions.\"<ref>Quoted by P.

Under the special circumstances of war mobilization, massive war spending doubled the [[gross national product]] (GNP).<ref>GNP was $99.7&nbsp;billion in 1940 and $210.1&nbsp;billion in 1944. ''Historical Statistics'' (1976) series F1.</ref> [[Military Keynesianism]] brought [[full employment]] and federal contracts were cost-plus. Instead of competitive bidding to get lower prices, the government gave out contracts that promised to pay all the expenses plus a modest profit. Factories hired everyone they could find regardless of their lack of skills\u2014they simplified work tasks and trained the workers, with the federal government paying all the costs. Millions of farmers left marginal operations, students quit school and housewives joined the labor force.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jensen | first1 = Richard J. | authorlink = Richard J.

Industry quickly absorbed the slack in the labor force and the tables turned such that employers needed to actively and aggressively recruit workers. As the military grew, new labor sources were needed to replace the 12&nbsp;million men serving in the military. Propaganda campaigns started pleading for people to work in the war factories. The barriers for married women, the old, the unskilled\u2014and (in the North and West) the barriers for racial minorities\u2014were lowered.<ref>{{cite book|author=D'Ann Campbell|title=Women at war with America: private lives in a patriotic era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eA0-AAAAMAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=110\u201315|isbn=9780674954755}}</ref>\n\n===Federal budget soars===\nIn 1929, federal expenditures accounted for only 3% of GNP. Between 1933 and 1939, federal expenditures tripled, but the national debt as a percent of GNP showed little change. Spending on the war effort quickly eclipsed spending on New Deal programs. In 1944, government spending on the war effort exceeded 40% of GNP. The U.S. economy experienced dramatic growth during the Second World War mostly due to the deemphasis of free enterprise in favor of the imposition of strict controls on prices and wages. These controls shared broad support among labor and business, resulting in cooperation between the two groups and the U.S. government. This cooperation resulted in the government subsidizing business and labor through both direct and indirect methods.<ref>Vatter, ''The U.S. Economy in World War II''</ref>\n\n===Wartime welfare projects===\nConservative domination of Congress during the war meant that all welfare projects and reforms had to have their approval, which was given when business supported the project. For example, the Coal Mines Inspection and Investigation Act of 1941 significantly reduced fatality rates in the coal-mining industry, saving workers' lives and company money.<ref>Curtis E. Harvey, ''Coal in Appalachia: an economic analysis''</ref>  In terms of welfare, the New Dealers wanted benefits for everyone according to need. However, conservatives proposed benefits based on national service\u2014especially tied to military service or working in war industries\u2014and their approach won out.\n\nThe Community Facilities Act of 1940 (the Lanham Act) provided federal funds to defense-impacted communities where the population had soared and local facilities were overwhelmed. It provided money for the building of housing for war workers as well as recreational facilities, water and sanitation plants, hospitals, day care centers and schools.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sarah Jo Peterson|title=Planning the Home Front: Building Bombers and Communities at Willow Run|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wu55uzCZdpkC&pg=PA85|year=2013|pages=85\u201388|isbn=9780226025421}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Eve P.

Emergency grants to states were authorized in 1942 for programs for day care for children of working mothers. In 1944, pensions were authorized for all physically or mentally helpless children of deceased veterans regardless of the age of the child at the date the claim was filed or at the time of the veteran's death, provided the child was disabled at the age of sixteen and that the disability continued to the date of the claim.

One out of seven births was covered during its operation. EMIC paid $127 million to state health departments to cover the care of 1.2 million new mothers and their babies. The average cost of EMIC maternity cases completed was $92.49 for medical and hospital care.

Bennett, ''When Dreams Came True: The GI Bill and the Making of Modern America'' (1999)</ref>\n\n===Fair Employment Practices===\n{{main|Fair Employment Practice Committee}}\nIn response to the March on Washington Movement led by A. Philip Randolph, Roosevelt promulgated Executive Order 8802 in June 1941, which established the President's Committee on Fair Employment Practices (FEPC) \"to receive and investigate complaints of discrimination\" so that \"there shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or government because of race, creed, color, or national origin\".<ref>Merl E.

The gap between rich and poor narrowed dramatically in the area of nutrition because food rationing and price controls provided a reasonably priced diet to everyone. White collar workers did not typically receive overtime and therefore the gap between white collar and blue collar income narrowed. Large families that had been poor during the 1930s had four or more wage earners and these families shot to the top one-third income bracket. Overtime provided large paychecks in war industries<ref>Kennedy, ''Freedom from Fear'' ch 18</ref> and average living standards rose steadily, with real wages rising by 44% in the four years of war, while the percentage of families with an annual income of less than $2,000 fell from 75% to 25% of the population.<ref>America in our time: from World War II to Nixon\u2014what happened and why by Godfrey Hodgson</ref>\n\nIn 1941, 40% of all American families lived on less than the $1,500 per year defined as necessary by the Works Progress Administration for a modest standard of living. The median income stood at $2,000 a year, while 8&nbsp;million workers earned below the legal minimum. From 1939 to 1944, wages and salaries more than doubled, with overtime pay and the expansion of jobs leading to a 70% rise in average weekly earnings during the course of the war. Membership in organized labor increased by 50% between 1941 and 1945 and because the War Labor Board sought labor-management peace, new workers were encouraged to participate in the existing labor organizations, thereby receiving all the benefits of union membership such as improved working conditions, better fringe benefits and higher wages. As noted by William H. Chafe, \"with full employment, higher wages and social welfare benefits provided under government regulations, American workers experienced a level of well-being that, for many, had never occurred before\".\n\nAs a result of the new prosperity, consumer expenditures rose by nearly 50%, from $61.7&nbsp;billion at the start of the war to $98.5&nbsp;billion by 1944. Individual savings accounts climbed almost sevenfold during the course of the war. The share of total income held by the top 5% of wage earners fell from 22% to 17% while the bottom 40% increased their share of the economic pie. In addition, during the course of the war the proportion of the American population earning less than $3,000 (in 1968 dollars) fell by half.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Unfinished Journey: America Since World War II by William H.

The farm programs typically aided large farm owners but eliminated opportunities for share croppers, tenants, and farm workers. The Home Owners' Loan Corporation's purchases and refinancing of troubled mortgages staved off drops in housing prices and home ownership rates at relatively low ex post cost to taxpayers. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation's loans to banks and railroads appear to have had little positive impact, although the banks were aided when the RFC took ownership stakes.</blockquote>\n\n==Historiography and evaluation of New Deal policies==\nHistorians debating the New Deal have generally divided between liberals who support it, conservatives who oppose it and some [[New Left]] historians who complain it was too favorable to capitalism and did too little for minorities.

Zelizer, \"The Forgotten Legacy of the New Deal: Fiscal Conservatism and the Roosevelt Administration, 1933\u20131938,\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'', (2000) 30#2. pp 331+ [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=5001752830 online]</ref> A fiscally conservative approach was supported by [[Wall Street]] and local investors and most of the business community\u2014mainstream academic economists believed in it as apparently did the majority of the public. Conservative southern Democrats, who favored balanced budgets and opposed new taxes, controlled Congress and its major committees. Even liberal Democrats at the time regarded balanced budgets as essential to economic stability in the long run, although they were more willing to accept short-term deficits. As Zelizer notes, public opinion polls consistently showed public opposition to deficits and debt. Throughout his terms, Roosevelt recruited fiscal conservatives to serve in his administration, most notably [[Lewis Douglas]] the Director of Budget in 1933\u20131934; and [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]], Secretary of the Treasury from 1934 to 1945. They defined policy in terms of budgetary cost and tax burdens rather than needs, rights, obligations, or political benefits. Personally, Roosevelt embraced their fiscal conservatism, but politically he realized that fiscal conservatism enjoyed a strong wide base of support among voters, leading Democrats and businessmen. On the other hand, there was enormous pressure to act and spending money on high visibility work programs with millions of paychecks a week.<ref>Zelizer, \"The Forgotten Legacy of the New Deal: Fiscal Conservatism and the Roosevelt Administration, 1933\u20131938\"</ref>\n\nDouglas proved too inflexible and he quit in 1934. Morgenthau made it his highest priority to stay close to Roosevelt, no matter what. Douglas's position, like many of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]], was grounded in a basic distrust of politicians and the deeply ingrained fear that government spending always involved a degree of patronage and corruption that offended his Progressive sense of efficiency. The Economy Act of 1933, passed early in the Hundred Days, was Douglas's great achievement. It reduced federal expenditures by $500&nbsp;million, to be achieved by reducing veterans' payments and federal salaries. Douglas cut government spending through executive orders that cut the military budget by $125&nbsp;million, $75&nbsp;million from the Post Office, $12&nbsp;million from Commerce, $75&nbsp;million from government salaries and $100&nbsp;million from staff layoffs. As Freidel concludes: \"The economy program was not a minor aberration of the spring of 1933, or a hypocritical concession to delighted conservatives. Rather it was an integral part of Roosevelt's overall New Deal\".<ref>Freidel 1990, p. 96</ref>\n\nRevenues were so low that borrowing was necessary (only the richest 3% paid any income tax between 1926 and 1940).<ref>U.S. Bureau of the Census. ''Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1946''. p. 321.</ref> Douglas therefore hated the relief programs, which he said reduced business confidence, threatened the government's future credit and had the \"destructive psychological effects of making mendicants of self-respecting American citizens\".<ref>Zelizer, \"The Forgotten Legacy of the New Deal\"</ref> Roosevelt was pulled toward greater spending by Hopkins and Ickes and as the 1936 election approached he decided to gain votes by attacking big business.\n\nMorgenthau shifted with Roosevelt, but at all times tried to inject fiscal responsibility\u2014he deeply believed in balanced budgets, stable currency, reduction of the national debt and the need for more private investment. The Wagner Act met Morgenthau's requirement because it strengthened the party's political base and involved no new spending. In contrast to Douglas, Morgenthau accepted Roosevelt's double budget as legitimate\u2014that is a balanced regular budget and an \"emergency\" budget for agencies, like the WPA, PWA and CCC, that would be temporary until full recovery was at hand. He fought against the veterans' bonus until Congress finally overrode Roosevelt's veto and gave out $2.2&nbsp;billion in 1936. His biggest success was the new Social Security program as he managed to reverse the proposals to fund it from general revenue and insisted it be funded by new taxes on employees. It was Morgenthau who insisted on excluding farm workers and domestic servants from Social Security because workers outside industry would not be paying their way.<ref>Zelizer, \"The Forgotten Legacy of the New Deal: Fiscal Conservatism; Savage 1998</ref>\n\n===Race and gender===\n====African Americans====\nWhile many Americans suffered economically during the Great Depression, African Americans also had to deal with social ills, such as racism, discrimination and [[Racial segregation#United States 2|segregation]]. Black workers were especially vulnerable to the economic downturn since most of them worked the most marginal jobs such as unskilled or service-oriented work, therefore they were the first to be discharged and additionally many employers preferred white workers. When jobs were scarce some employers even dismissed black workers to create jobs for white citizens. In the end there were three times more African American workers on public assistance or relief than white workers.<ref>Hamilton Cravens, ''Great Depression: People and Perspectives'', ABC-CLIO, 2009, {{ISBN|9781598840933}}, p. 106</ref>\n\nRoosevelt appointed an unprecedented number of African Americans to second-level positions in his administration\u2014these appointees were collectively called the [[Black Cabinet]]. The WPA, NYA and CCC relief programs allocated 10% of their budgets to blacks (who comprised about 10% of the total population, and 20% of the poor). They operated separate all-black units with the same pay and conditions as white units.<ref name=\"Sitkoff1\"/> Some leading white New Dealers, especially [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Harold L. Ickes|Harold Ickes]] and [[Aubrey Willis Williams|Aubrey Williams]], worked to ensure blacks received at least 10% of welfare assistance payments.<ref name=\"Sitkoff1\">Sitkoff (2008)</ref> However, these benefits were small in comparison to the economic and political advantages that whites received. Most unions excluded blacks from joining and enforcement of anti-discrimination laws in the South was virtually impossible, especially since most blacks worked in hospitality and agricultural sectors.<ref>Ira Katznelson, ''When Affirmative Action was White'' (2005).</ref>\n\nThe New Deal programs put millions of Americans immediately back to work or at least helped them to survive.<ref>Hamilton Cravens, ''Great Depression: People and Perspectives'', ABC-CLIO, 2009, {{ISBN|9781598840933}}, pp. 105, 108</ref> The programs were not specifically targeted to alleviate the much higher unemployment rate of blacks.<ref name=\"Hamilton Cravens 2009, p. 108\">Hamilton Cravens, ''Great Depression: People and Perspectives'', ABC-CLIO, 2009, {{ISBN|9781598840933}}, p. 108.</ref> Some aspects of the programs were even unfavorable to blacks. The Agricultural Adjustment Acts for example helped farmers which were predominantly white, but reduced the need of farmers to hire tenant farmers or sharecroppers which were predominantly black. While the AAA stipulated that a farmer had to share the payments with those who worked the land this policy was never enforced.<ref>Hamilton Cravens, ''Great Depression: People and Perspectives'', ABC-CLIO, 2009, {{ISBN|9781598840933}}, p. 113.</ref> The Farm Service Agency (FSA), a government relief agency for tenant farmers, created in 1937, made efforts to empower African Americans by appointing them to agency committees in the South. Senator James F. Byrnes of South Carolina raised opposition to the appointments because he stood for white farmers who were threatened by an agency that could organize and empower tenant farmers. Initially, the FSA stood behind their appointments, but after feeling national pressure FSA was forced to release the African Americans of their positions. The goals of the FSA were notoriously liberal and not cohesive with the southern voting elite. Some New Deal measures inadvertently discriminated against harmed blacks. Thousands of blacks were thrown out of work and replaced by whites on jobs where they were paid less than the NRA's wage minimums because some white employers considered the NRA's minimum wage \"too much money for Negroes\". By August 1933, blacks called the NRA the \"Negro Removal Act\".<ref>Philip S. Foner.

Until 1936 almost all African Americans (and many whites) shifted from the \"Party of Lincoln\" to the Democratic Party.<ref name=\"Hamilton Cravens 2009, p. 108\"/> This was a sharp realignment from 1932, when most African Americans voted the Republican ticket. New Deal policies helped establish a political alliance between blacks and the Democratic Party that survives into the 21st century.<ref>Sitkoff (2008); Nancy J. Weiss, ''Farewell to the Party of Lincoln: Black Politics in the Age of FDR'' (1983)</ref>\n\nThere was no attempt whatsoever to end segregation, or to increase black rights in the South, and a number of leaders that promoted the New Deal were racist and anti semites.<ref name=\"Rothstein2017\">{{cite book|author=Richard Rothstein|title=The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SdtDDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT238|date=2 May 2017|publisher=Liveright|isbn=978-1-63149-286-0|pages=238\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe wartime [[Fair Employment Practice Committee|Fair Employment Practices Commission]] (FEPC) executive orders that forbade job discrimination against African Americans, women and ethnic groups was a major breakthrough that brought better jobs and pay to millions of minority Americans.

The critics emphasize the absence of a philosophy of reform to explain the failure of New Dealers to attack fundamental social problems. They demonstrate the New Deal's commitment to save capitalism and its refusal to strip away private property. They detect a remoteness from the people and indifference to participatory democracy and call instead for more emphasis on conflict and exploitation.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal | last1 = Auerbach | first1 = Jerold S. | year = 1969 | title = New Deal, Old Deal, or Raw Deal: Some Thoughts on New Left Historiography | journal = Journal of Southern History | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 18\u201330 | jstor=2204748| doi = 10.2307/2204748 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Unger | first1 = Irwin | year = 1967 | title = The 'New Left' and American History: Some Recent Trends in United States Historiography | journal = American Historical Review | volume = 72 | issue = 4| pages = 1237\u201363 | jstor=1847792| doi = 10.2307/1847792 }}</ref>\n\n====Women and the New Deal====\n[[File:FERA, Camps for Unemployed Women, Maine - NARA - 196588.tif|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] (FERA) camp for unemployed women in [[Maine]], 1934]]\nAt first, the New Deal created programs primarily for men as it was assumed that the husband was the \"[[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]]\" (the provider) and if they had jobs the whole family would benefit. It was the social norm for women to give up jobs when they married\u2014in many states, there were laws that prevented both husband and wife holding regular jobs with the government. So too in the relief world, it was rare for both husband and wife to have a relief job on FERA or the WPA.<ref>Children in the family were allowed to hold CCC or NYA jobs\u2014indeed, CCC jobs were normally given to young men whose fathers were on relief. Young women were eligible for NYA jobs which began in 1935.</ref> This prevailing social norm of the breadwinner failed to take into account the numerous households headed by women, but it soon became clear that the government needed to help women as well.<ref>Susan Ware, ''Beyond Suffrage: Women in the New Deal'' (1987)</ref>\n\nMany women were employed on FERA projects run by the states with federal funds. The first New Deal program to directly assist women was the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA), begun in 1935. It hired single women, widows, or women with disabled or absent husbands. The WPA employed about 500,000 women and they were assigned mostly to unskilled jobs. 295,000 worked on sewing projects that made 300 million items of clothing and bedding to be given away to families on relief and to hospitals and orphanages. Women also were hired for the WPA's school lunch program.<ref>Martha Swain, '\"The Forgotten Woman': Ellen S.

However, Social Security was not a relief program and it was not designed for short-term needs, as very few people received benefits before 1942.\n\n===Relief===\n[[File:This farmer is not on government relief.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Anti-relief protest sign near [[Davenport, Iowa]] by [[Arthur Rothstein]], 1940]]\nThe New Deal expanded the role of the federal government, particularly to help the poor, the unemployed, youth, the elderly and stranded rural communities. The Hoover administration started the system of funding state relief programs, whereby the states hired people on relief. With the CCC in 1933 and the WPA in 1935, the federal government now became involved in directly hiring people on relief in granting direct relief or benefits. Total federal, state and local spending on relief rose from 3.9% of GNP in 1929 to 6.4% in 1932 and 9.7% in 1934\u2014the return of prosperity in 1944 lowered the rate to 4.1%. In 1935\u20131940, welfare spending accounted for 49% of the federal, state and local government budgets.<ref>Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States'' (1975) p. 340 series H1 and H2</ref> In his memoirs, Milton Friedman said that the New Deal relief programs were an appropriate response.

According to [[Richard L. Jensen]], cyclical unemployment was a grave matter primarily until 1935. Between 1935 and 1941, [[structural unemployment]] became the bigger problem. Especially the unions successes in demanding higher wages pushed management into introducing new efficiency-oriented hiring standards. It ended inefficient labor such as child labor, casual unskilled work for subminimum wages and sweatshop conditions. In the long term, the shift to efficiency wages led to high productivity, high wages and a high standard of living, but it necessitated a well-educated, well-trained, hard-working labor force. It was not before war time brought full employment that the supply of unskilled labor (that caused structural unemployment) downsized.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jensen | first1 = Richard J | year = 1989 | title = The Causes and Cures of Unemployment in the Great Depression | journal = Journal of Interdisciplinary History | volume = 19 | issue = 4| pages = 553\u201383 | jstor=203954| doi = 10.2307/203954 }}</ref>\n\n====Mainstream economics interpretation====\n[[File:PIBUSA1920-40.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|[[Economic history of the United States|U.S. GDP]] annual pattern and long-term trend (1920\u20131940) in billions of constant dollars]]\n\n=====Keynesians: halted the collapse but lacked Keynesian deficit spending=====\nAt the beginning of the Great Depression, many economists traditionally argued against deficit spending. The fear was that government spending would \"crowd out\" private investment and would thus not have any effect on the economy, a proposition known as the [[Treasury view]], but Keynesian economics rejected that view. They argued that by spending vastly more money\u2014using [[fiscal policy]]\u2014the government could provide the needed stimulus through the [[multiplier effect]]. Without that stimulus, business simply would not hire more people, especially the low skilled and supposedly \"untrainable\" men who had been unemployed for years and lost any job skill they once had. Keynes visited the White House in 1934 to urge President Roosevelt to increase [[deficit spending]]. Roosevelt afterwards complained that \"he left a whole rigmarole of figures \u2013 he must be a mathematician rather than a political economist\".<ref>W. Elliot Brownlee, ''Federal Taxation in America: A Short History'' (2004) p. 103</ref>\n\nThe New Deal tried public works, farm subsidies and other devices to reduce unemployment, but Roosevelt never completely gave up trying to balance the budget.

The effects of federal public works spending were largely offset by Herbert Hoover's large tax increase in 1932, whose full effects for the first time were felt in 1933 and it was undercut by spending cuts, especially the Economy Act. According to Keynesians like [[Paul Krugman]], the New Deal therefore was not as successful in the short run as it was in the long run.<ref name=\"Franklin Delano Obama\">New York Times, Paul Krugman, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/opinion/10krugman.html Franklin Delano Obama?], November 10, 2008</ref>\n\nFollowing the Keynesian consensus (that lasted until the 1970s), the traditional view was that federal deficit spending associated with the war brought full-employment output while monetary policy was just aiding the process. In this view, the New Deal did not end the Great Depression, but halted the economic collapse and ameliorated the worst of the crises.<ref>Jason Scott Smith, ''A Concise History of the New Deal'', Cambridge University Press, 2014, {{ISBN|9781139991698}}, p. 2</ref>\n\n=====Monetarist interpretation=====\n======Milton Friedman======\nMore influential among economists has been the monetarist interpretation by [[Milton Friedman]] as put forth in ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]],''{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} which includes a full-scale monetary history of what he calls the \"[[Great Contraction]].\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Anna Schwartz|title=The Great Contraction, 1929\u20131933 (New Edition)|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-lCArZfazBkC&q=%22Regarding%20the%20Great%20Depression%20You're%20right%20We%20did%20it%22|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691137940}}</ref>  Friedman concentrated on the failures before 1933 and points out that between 1929 and 1932 the [[Federal Reserve]] allowed the money supply to fall by a third which is seen as the major cause that turned a normal recession into a Great Depression.

While [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]] argued in ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'' (1963) that the Federal Reserve System had made no attempt to increase the quantity in high-powered money and thus failed to foster recovery, they somehow did not investigate the impact of the monetary policy of the New Deal. In 1992, [[Christina Romer]] explained in \"What Ended the Great Depression?\" that the rapid growth in money supply beginning in 1933 can be traced back to a large unsterilized gold inflow to the U.S. which was partly due to political instability in Europe, but to a larger degree to the revaluation of gold through the Gold Reserve Act. The Roosevelt administration had chosen not to sterilize the gold inflow precisely because they hoped that the growth of money supply would stimulate the economy.<ref name=\"Romer 757\u2013784\"/>\n\nReplying to DeLong et al. in the ''Journal of Economic History'', J. R. Vernon argues that deficit spending leading up to and during World War II still played a large part in the overall recovery, according to his study \"half or more of the recovery occurred during 1941 and 1942\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Vernon |first=J.

Eggertsson and Christina Romer, the biggest primary impact of the New Deal on the economy and the key to recovery and to end the Great Depression was brought about by a successful management of public expectations. The thesis is based on the observation that after years of deflation and a very severe recession important economic indicators turned positive just in March 1933 when Roosevelt took office. Consumer prices turned from deflation to a mild inflation, industrial production bottomed out in March 1933, investment doubled in 1933 with a turnaround in March 1933. There were no monetary forces to explain that turnaround. Money supply was still falling and short-term interest rates remained close to zero. Before March 1933, people expected a further deflation and recession so that even interest rates at zero did not stimulate investment. However, when Roosevelt announced major regime changes people{{Who|date=May 2017}} began to expect inflation and an economic expansion. With those expectations, interest rates at zero began to stimulate investment just as they were expected to do. Roosevelt's fiscal and monetary policy regime change helped to make his policy objectives credible. The expectation of higher future income and higher future inflation stimulated demand and investments. The analysis suggests that the elimination of the policy dogmas of the gold standard, a balanced budget in times of crises and small government led endogenously to a large shift in expectation that accounts for about 70\u201380 percent of the recovery of output and prices from 1933 to 1937. If the regime change had not happened and the Hoover policy had continued, the economy would have continued its free-fall in 1933 and output would have been 30 percent lower in 1937 than in 1933.<ref>[http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.98.4.1476 Gauti B.

Historians like Arthur M. Schlesinger and James T. Patterson have argued that the augmentation of the federal government exacerbated tensions between the federal and state governments. However, contemporaries such as [[Ira Katznelson]] have suggested that due to certain conditions on the allocation of federal funds, namely that the individual states get to control them, the federal government managed to avoid any tension with states over their rights. This is a prominent debate concerning the historiography of [[federalism in the United States]] and\u2014as Schlesinger and Patterson have observed\u2014the New Deal marked an era when the federal-state power balance shifted further in favor of the federal government, which heightened tensions between the two levels of government in the United States.\n\n[[Ira Katznelson]] has argued that although the federal government expanded its power and began providing welfare benefits on a scale previously unknown in the United States, it often allowed individual states to control the allocation of the funds provided for such welfare. This meant that the states controlled who had access to these funds, which in turn meant many Southern states were able to racially segregate\u2014or in some cases, like a number of counties in Georgia, completely exclude African-Americans\u2014the allocation of federal funds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Katznelson|first=Ira|title=When Affirmative Action was White: An Untold History of Racial Inequality in Twentieth-Century America|year=2005|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|location=New York|page=37}}</ref> This enabled these states to continue to relatively exercise their rights and also to preserve the institutionalization of the racist order of their societies. While Katznelson has conceded that the expansion of the federal government had the potential to lead to federal-state tension, he has argued it was avoided as these states managed to retain some control. As Katznelson has observed, \"they [state governments in the South] had to manage the strain that potentially might be placed on local practices by investing authority in federal bureaucracies [...]. To guard against this outcome, they key mechanism deployed was a separation of the source of funding from decisions about how to spend the new monies\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Katznelson|first=Ira|title=When Affirmative Action was White: An Untold History of Racial Inequality in Twentieth-Century America|year=2005|publisher=W. W. Norton|location=New York|page=40}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Schlesinger has disputed Katznelson's claim and has argued that the increase in the power of the federal government was perceived to come at the cost of states' rights, thereby aggravating state governments, which exacerbated federal-state tensions. Schlesinger has utilized quotes from the time to highlight this point and has observed that \"the actions of the New Deal, [Ogden L.] Mills said, \"abolish the sovereignty of the States. They make of a government of limited powers one of unlimited authority over the lives of us all\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur M.|title=The Age of Roosevelt: The Coming of the New Deal|year=1958|publisher=The Riverside Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=473}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, Schlesinger has argued that this federal-state tension was not a one-way street and that the federal government became just as aggravated with the state governments as they did with it. State governments were often guilty of inhibiting or delaying federal policies. Whether through intentional methods, like sabotage, or unintentional ones, like simple administrative overload\u2014either way, these problems aggravated the federal government and thus heightened federal-state tensions. Schlesinger has also noted that \"students of public administration have never taken sufficient account of the capacity of lower levels of government to sabotage or defy even a masterful President\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur M.|title=The Age of Roosevelt: The Coming of the New Deal|year=1958|publisher=The Riverside Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=536}}</ref>\n\nJames T. Patterson has reiterated this argument, though he observes that this increased tension can be accounted for not just from a political perspective, but from an economic one too. Patterson has argued that the tension between the federal and state governments at least partly also resulted from the economic strain under which the states had been put by the federal government's various policies and agencies. Some states were either simply unable to cope with the federal government's demand and thus refused to work with them, or admonished the economic restraints and actively decided to sabotage federal policies. This was demonstrated, Patterson has noted, with the handling of federal relief money by Ohio governor, Martin L. Davey. The case in Ohio became so detrimental to the federal government that Harry Hopkins, supervisor of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, had to federalize Ohio relief.<ref>{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=James T.|title=The New Deal and the States: Federalism in Transition|url=https://archive.org/details/newdealstatesfed0000patt|url-access=registration|year=1969|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=[https://archive.org/details/newdealstatesfed0000patt/page/62 62]}}</ref> Although this argument differs somewhat from Schlesinger's, the source of federal-state tension remained the growth of the federal government. As Patterson has asserted, \"though the record of the FERA was remarkably good\u2014almost revolutionary\u2014in these respects it was inevitable, given the financial requirements imposed on deficit-ridden states, that friction would develop between governors and federal officials\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=James T.|title=The New Deal and the States: Federalism in Transition|url=https://archive.org/details/newdealstatesfed0000patt|url-access=registration|year=1969|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=[https://archive.org/details/newdealstatesfed0000patt/page/52 52]}}</ref>\n\nIn this dispute, it can be inferred that Katznelson and Schlesinger and Patterson have only disagreed on their inference of the historical evidence. While both parties have agreed that the federal government expanded and even that states had a degree of control over the allocation of federal funds, they have disputed the consequences of these claims. Katznelson has asserted that it created mutual acquiescence between the levels of government, while Schlesinger and Patterson have suggested that it provoked contempt for the state governments on the part of the federal government and vice versa, thus exacerbating their relations. In short, irrespective of the interpretation this era marked an important time in the historiography of federalism and also nevertheless provided some narrative on the legacy of federal-state relations.\n\n==Charges==\n{{see also|Criticism of Franklin D. Roosevelt}}\n\n===Charges of fascism===\n{{further|The New Deal and corporatism}}\nWorldwide, the Great Depression had the most profound impact in the [[German Reich]] and the United States. In both countries the pressure to reform and the perception of the economic crisis were strikingly similar. When Hitler came to power he was faced with exactly the same task that faced Roosevelt, overcoming mass unemployment and the global Depression. The political responses to the crises were essentially different: while American democracy remained strong, Germany replaced democracy with fascism, a Nazi dictatorship.<ref>Kiran Klaus Patel, ''Soldiers of Labor: Labor Service in Nazi Germany and New Deal America, 1933\u20131945'' Cambridge University Press 2005, pp. 3\u20135</ref>\n\nThe initial perception of the New Deal was mixed. On the one hand, the eyes of the world were upon the United States because many democrats in Europe and the United States saw in Roosevelt's reform program a positive counterweight to the seductive powers of the two great alternative systems, communism and fascism.<ref>Kiran Klaus Patel, Soldiers of Labor: Labor Service in Nazi Germany and New Deal America, 1933\u20131945, {{ISBN|978-0-521-83416-2}}, Cambridge University Press 2005, p. 6</ref> As the historian [[Isaiah Berlin]] wrote in 1955: \"The only light in the darkness was the administration of Mr. Roosevelt and the New Deal in the United States\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Isaiah Berlin, \"The Natural\"|title=Atlantic Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0CJUBKCggcC&pg=PA230|year=1955|pages=230\u2013|isbn=9780307481405}}</ref>\n\nBy contrast, enemies of the New Deal sometimes called it \"fascist\", but they meant very different things. Communists denounced the New Deal in 1933 and 1934 as fascist in the sense that it was under the control of big business. They dropped that line of thought when Stalin switched to the \"Popular Front\" plan of cooperation with liberals.<ref>{{cite book|author=Fraser M.

Their preliminary studies on the origins of the fascist dictatorships and the American (reformed) democracy came to the conclusion that besides essential differences \"the crises led to a limited degree of convergence\" on the level of economic and social policy.{{Disputed inline|Talk:New Deal#Disputed|date=August 2013}} The most important cause was the growth of state interventionism since in the face of the catastrophic economic situation both societies no longer counted on the power of the market to heal itself.<ref>Kiran Klaus Patel, Soldiers of Labor: Labor Service in Nazi Germany and New Deal America, 1933\u20131945, {{ISBN|978-0-521-83416-2}}, Cambridge University Press 2005, pp. 5, 6</ref>\n\nJohn Garraty wrote that the National Recovery Administration (NRA) was based on economic experiments in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, without establishing a totalitarian dictatorship.<ref>Garraty, John A.

His argument correlates with Mason's that economic factors alone are an insufficient approach to understand fascism and that decisions taken by fascists in power cannot be explained within a logical economic framework. In economic terms, both ideas were within the general tendency of the 1930s to intervene in the free market capitalist economy, at the price of its ''laissez-faire'' character, \"to protect the capitalist structure endangered by endogenous crises tendencies and processes of impaired self-regulation\".<ref name=\"Daniel Woodley 2010, p.160, 161\"/>\n\n[[Stanley Payne]], a historian of fascism, examined possible fascist influences in the United States by looking at the KKK and its offshoots and movements led by Father Coughlin and [[Huey Long]].

That changed in the 1960s when [[New Left]] historians began a revisionist critique calling the New Deal a bandaid for a patient that needed radical surgery to reform capitalism, put private property in its place and lift up workers, women and minorities.<ref>For a list of relevant works, see the list of suggested readings appearing toward the bottom of the article.</ref> The New Left believed in participatory democracy and therefore rejected the autocratic machine politics typical of the big city Democratic organizations.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn a 1968 essay, Barton J. Bernstein compiled a chronicle of missed opportunities and inadequate responses to problems. The New Deal may have saved capitalism from itself, Bernstein charged, but it had failed to help\u2014and in many cases actually harmed\u2014those groups most in need of assistance. In ''The New Deal'' (1967), Paul K. Conkin similarly chastised the government of the 1930s for its weak policies toward marginal farmers, for its failure to institute sufficiently progressive tax reform, and its excessive generosity toward select business interests. In 1966, [[Howard Zinn]] criticized the New Deal for working actively to actually preserve the worst evils of capitalism.\n\nBy the 1970s, liberal historians were responding with a defense of the New Deal based on numerous local and microscopic studies. Praise increasingly focused on Eleanor Roosevelt, seen as a more appropriate crusading reformer than her husband.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Krueger | first1 = Thomas A. | year = 1975 | title = New Deal Historiography at Forty | journal = Reviews in American History | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 483\u201388 | jstor=2701507| doi = 10.2307/2701507 }}</ref> Since then, research on the New Deal has been less interested in the question of whether the New Deal was a \"conservative\", \"liberal\", or \"revolutionary\" phenomenon than in the question of constraints within which it was operating.\n\nIn a series of articles, political sociologist [[Theda Skocpol]] has emphasized the issue of \"state capacity\" as an often-crippling constraint. Ambitious reform ideas often failed, she argued, because of the absence of a government bureaucracy with significant strength and expertise to administer them. Other more recent works have stressed the political constraints that the New Deal encountered. Conservative skepticism about the efficacy of government was strong both in Congress and among many citizens. Thus some scholars have stressed that the New Deal was not just a product of its liberal backers, but also a product of the pressures of its conservative opponents.\n\n===Communists in government===\nDuring the New Deal the communists established a network of a dozen or so members working for the government. They were low level and had a minor influence on policies.

As Arthur A. Ekirch Jr. (1971) has shown, the New Deal stimulated [[utopianism]] in American political and social thought on a wide range of issues. In Canada, Conservative Prime Minister Richard B. Bennett in 1935 proposed a \"new deal\" of regulation, taxation and social insurance that was a copy of the American program, but Bennett's proposals were not enacted and he was defeated for reelection in October 1935. In accordance with the rise of the use of U.S. political phraseology in Britain, the Labour government of [[Tony Blair]] termed some of its employment programs \"new deal\", in contrast to the Conservative Party's promise of the \"British Dream\".\n\n==Works of art and music==\n[[File:William Gropper - Construction of a Dam 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|The federal government commissioned a series of public murals from the artists it employed: [[William Gropper]]'s ''Construction of a Dam'' (1939) is characteristic of much of the art of the 1930s, with workers seen in heroic poses, laboring in unison to complete a great public project]]\nThe [[Works Progress Administration]] subsidized artists, musicians, painters and writers on relief with a group of projects called [[Federal One]]. While the WPA program was by far the most widespread, it was preceded by three programs administered by the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury]] which hired commercial artists at usual commissions to add murals and sculptures to federal buildings. The first of these efforts was the short-lived [[Public Works of Art Project]], organized by [[Edward Bruce (New Deal)|Edward Bruce]], an American businessman and artist. Bruce also led the Treasury Department's [[Section of Painting and Sculpture]] (later renamed the Section of Fine Arts) and the Treasury Relief Art Project (TRAP). The [[Resettlement Administration]] (RA) and [[Farm Security Administration]] (FSA) had major photography programs. The New Deal arts programs emphasized [[regionalism (art)|regionalism]], [[social realism]], [[class conflict]], [[proletarian]] interpretations and audience participation.

Countless theatre productions around the country were staged. This allowed thousands of actors and directors to be employed, among them were Orson Welles, and John Huston.<ref name=\"M.J.Heale. 1999\"/>\n\nThe FSA photography project is most responsible for creating the image of the Depression in the U.S. Many of the images appeared in popular magazines. The photographers were under instruction from Washington as to what overall impression the New Deal wanted to give out. Director [[Roy Stryker]]'s agenda focused on his faith in [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]], the poor conditions among cotton tenant farmers and the very poor conditions among migrant farm workers\u2014above all he was committed to social reform through New Deal intervention in people's lives. Stryker demanded photographs that \"related people to the land and vice versa\" because these photographs reinforced the RA's position that poverty could be controlled by \"changing land practices\". Though Stryker did not dictate to his photographers how they should compose the shots, he did send them lists of desirable themes, such as \"church\", \"court day\", \"barns\".<ref>Cara A. Finnegan. ''Picturing Poverty: Print Culture and FSA Photographs'' (Smithsonian Books, 2003) pp. 43\u201344</ref>\n\nFilms of the late New Deal era such as ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) ridiculed so-called \"great men\" while the heroism of the common man appeared in numerous movies, such as ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1940). Thus in [[Frank Capra]]'s famous films, including ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939), ''[[Meet John Doe]]'' (1941) and  ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946), the common people come together to battle and overcome villains who are corrupt politicians controlled by very rich, greedy capitalists.<ref>Harry M.

[[Gutzon Borglum]]'s sculptures on [[Mount Rushmore]] emphasized great men in history (his designs had the approval of [[Calvin Coolidge]]). [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]] disliked the New Deal and celebrated the autonomy of perfected written work as opposed to the New Deal idea of writing as performative labor. The [[Southern Agrarians]] celebrated a premodern regionalism and opposed the TVA as a modernizing, disruptive force. [[Cass Gilbert]], a conservative who believed architecture should reflect historic traditions and the established social order, designed the new Supreme Court building (1935).
