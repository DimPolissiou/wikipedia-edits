The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in [[Boeotia]], his visit to [[Chios]] where he met [[Merope (Oenopion)|Merope]] and after he [[Rape|violated]] her, was blinded by her father, [[Oenopion]], the recovery of his sight at [[Lemnos]], his hunting with [[Artemis]] on [[Crete]], his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became [[Scorpius|Scorpio]], and his elevation to the heavens.<ref>[[Scholia]] on ''[[Homer]], [[Iliad]]'' 18.486 citing Pherecydes</ref> Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories, and it is impossible to tell whether the omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.\n\nIn Greek literature he first appears as a great hunter in [[Homer]]'s epic the ''[[Odyssey]]'', where [[Odysseus]] sees his shade in the [[underworld]]. The bare bones of Orion's story are told by the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] and Roman collectors of myths, but there is no extant literary version of his adventures comparable, for example, to that of [[Jason]] in [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'' or [[Euripides]]' ''[[Medea]]''; the entry in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' for May 11 is a poem on the birth of Orion, but that is one version of a single story. The surviving fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation about Greek prehistory and myth.\n\nOrion served several roles in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] culture. The story of the adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the one for which there is the most evidence (and even for that, not very much); he is also the personification of the constellation of the same name; he was venerated as a [[Greek hero cult|hero]], in the Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia; and there is one [[etiology|etiological]] passage which says that Orion was responsible for the present shape of the [[Strait of Sicily]].\n\n==Legends==\n\n===Homer and Hesiod===\nOrion is mentioned in the oldest surviving works of Greek literature, which probably date back to the 7th or 8th&nbsp;century&nbsp; BC, but which are the products of an oral tradition with origins several centuries earlier. In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' Orion is described as a constellation, and the star [[Sirius]] is mentioned as his dog.<ref>Il.[https://archive.today/20120712215800/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Il.+18.388 \u03a3 486\u2013489], on the shield of Achilles, and [https://archive.today/20120629052324/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Il.+22.1 \u03a7 29], respectively.</ref> In the ''[[Odyssey]]'', Orion is essentially the godfather of hunting, Odysseus sees him hunting in the underworld with a bronze club, a great slayer of animals; In some legends Orion claims to be able to hunt any animal in existence. He is also mentioned as a constellation, as the lover of the [[Eos|Goddess Dawn]], as slain by [[Artemis]], and as the most handsome of the earthborn.<ref>\u03bb 572\u2013577 (as a hunter); \u03b5 273\u2013275, as a constellation (= \u03a3 487\u2013489); \u03b5 121\u2013124; \u03bb 572\u201377; \u03bb 309\u2013310; Rose (''A Handbook,'' p.117) notes that Homer never identifies the hunter and the constellation, and suggests that they were not originally the same.</ref> In the ''[[Works and Days]]'' of [[Hesiod]], Orion is also a constellation, one whose rising and setting with the sun is used to reckon the year.<ref>ll. 598, 623</ref>\n<span id=\"Seiter painting\"></span> \n[[Image:Diane aupr\u00e8s du cadavre d'Orion.jpg|thumb|[[Daniel Seiter]]'s 1685 painting of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] over Orion's corpse, before he is placed in the heavens]]\nThe legend of Orion was first told in full in a lost work by Hesiod, probably the ''[[Astronomia]]'' (simple references to \u2018''Hesiod''\u2019, below will refer to the lost text from ''[[Astronomia]]'', unless otherwise stated). This version is known through the work of [[Eratosthenes]] on the constellations, who gives a fairly long summary of Hesiod's episode on Orion.<ref>[[Eratosthenes]], ''[[Catasterismi]]''; translation in {{gutenberg|no=348|name=Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns, and Homerica by Hesiod|author=Evelyn-White, Hugh G.|year=1914}} Whether these works are actually by Hesiod and Eratosthenes themselves is doubtful; pseudo-Eratosthenes does not specify the work of Hesiod he is summarizing, but the modern assumption that it is the same work which other authors call the ''Astronomy'' is not particularly controversial. It is certainly neither the ''Theogony'' nor the ''Works and Days''.</ref> According to this version, Orion was likely the son of the sea-god [[Poseidon]] and Euryale,<ref>The summary of Hesiod simply says Euryale, but there is no reason to conflate her with [[Euryale (Gorgon)|Euryale]] the Gorgon, or to Euryale the Amazon of [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus]]; other ancient sources say explicitly Euryale, daughter of Minos.</ref> daughter of [[Minos]], King of Crete. Orion could walk on the waves because of his father; he walked to the island of [[Chios]] where he got drunk and attacked [[Merope (Oenopion)|Merope]],<ref>Apparently unrelated to the Merope who was one of the [[Pleiades (mythology)|Pleiades]].</ref> daughter of [[Oenopion]], the ruler there. In vengeance, Oenopion blinded Orion and drove him away. Orion stumbled to [[Lemnos]] where [[Hephaestus]] \u2014 the smith-god \u2014 had his forge. Hephaestus told his servant, [[Cedalion]], to guide Orion to the uttermost East where [[Helios]], the Sun, healed him; Orion carried Cedalion around on his shoulders. Orion returned to Chios to punish Oenopion, but the king hid away underground and escaped Orion's wrath. Orion's next journey took him to [[Crete]] where he hunted with the goddess [[Artemis]] and her mother [[Leto]], and in the course of the hunt, threatened to kill every beast on Earth. Mother [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]] ([[Apollo]] in some versions, disapproving of his sister's relationship with a male) objected and sent a giant scorpion to kill Orion. The creature succeeded, and after his death, the goddesses asked [[Zeus]] to place Orion among the constellations. Zeus consented and, as a memorial to the hero's death, added the [[Scorpius|Scorpion]] to the heavens as well.<ref>[[Scorpion]] is here a type of creature, Greek ''\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03c0\u03af\u03bf\u03c2,'' not a proper name. The constellation is called [[Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]] in astronomy; colloquially, [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], like the related astrological sign \u2014 both are Latin forms of the Greek word. Cicero used ''Nepa,'' the older Latin word for \"scorpion.\" See Kubiak's paper in the bibliography.</ref>\n\n===Other sources===\nAlthough Orion has a few lines in both Homeric poems and in the ''Works and Days'', most of the stories about him are recorded in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings. No great poet standardized the legend.<ref>Rose, ''A Handbook'', p.116\u2013117</ref> The ancient sources for Orion's legend are mostly notes in the margins of ancient poets ([[scholia]]) or compilations by later scholars, the equivalent of modern reference works or encyclopedias; even the legend from Hesiod's ''Astronomy'' survives only in one such compilation. In several cases, including the summary of the ''Astronomy'', although the surviving work bears the name of a famous scholar, such as [[Apollodorus of Athens]], [[Eratosthenes]], or [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], what survives is either an ancient forgery or an abridgement of the original compilation by a later writer of dubious competence; editors of these texts suggest that they may have borne the names of great scholars because they were abridgments, or even pupil's notes, based on the works of the scholars.<ref>''Oxford Classical Dictionary''. Under \"Apollodorus of Athens (6)\" it describes the [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]] as an uncritical forgery some centuries later than Apollodorus; it distinguishes \"Hyginus (4)\", the author of the ''Fabulae'' and ''Astronomy'', from \"Hyginus (1)\", (C. Julius) adding of the former that the \"absurdities\" of this \"abbreviated\" compilation are \"partly due to its compiler's ignorance of Greek.\" Under \"Eratosthenes\", it dismisses the surviving ''Catasterismi'' as pseudo-Eratosthenic. See Frazer's Loeb Apollodorus, and Condos's translation of the other two (as ''Star myths of the Greeks and Romans'' Phanes, 1997, {{ISBN|1-890482-92-7}}) for the editorial opinions.</ref>\n\nThe margin of the Empress [[Aelia Eudocia|Eudocia]]'s copy of the Iliad has a note summarizing a Hellenistic poet<ref>[[Euphorion of Chalcis]], who wrote in the 2nd century BC.

The Latin translations by Hyginus are ambiguous. Ejaculation of semen is the more obvious interpretation here, and Kerenyi assumes it; but [[John Peter Oleson]] argued, in the note to p.28 of [https://www.jstor.org/stable/294109 A Possible Physiological Basis for the Term urinator, \"diver\"] (''The American Journal of Philology, Vol. 97'', No. 1.

Here Orion is described as earthborn and enormous in stature. This version also mentions Poseidon and Euryale as his parents. It adds a first marriage to [[Side (mythology)|Side]] before his marriage to Merope. All that is known about Side is that [[Hera]] threw her into [[Hades]] for rivalling her in beauty. It also gives a different version of Orion's death than the ''[[Iliad]]'': [[Eos]], the Dawn, fell in love with Orion and took him to [[Delos]] where Artemis killed him.<ref>The ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' [https://archive.today/20120905022144/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Apollod.+1.4.3 1.4.3\u20131.4.5].

Paragraphing according to [[Ghislane Vir\u00e9]]'s 1992 [[Teubner]] edition. Modern scholarship holds that these are not the original work of Hyginus either, but latter condensations: a teacher's, possibly a student's, notes.</ref> It begins with the oxhide story of Orion's birth, which this source ascribes to [[Callimachus]] and Aristomachus, and sets the location at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] or Chios.<ref>Aristomachus of Soli wrote on bee-keeping (''Oxford Classical Dictionary'': \"Bee-keeping\").</ref> Hyginus has two versions. In one of them he omits Poseidon;<ref>In the [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica2.html#34 ''Astronomia;''] the [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae4.html#195 ''Fabulae''] have Poseidon.</ref> a modern critic suggests this is the original version.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion''.</ref>\n\nThe same source tells two stories of the death of Orion. The first says that because of his \"living joined in too great a friendship\" with [[Oenopion]], he boasted to [[Artemis]] and [[Leto]] that he could kill anything which came from Earth. Gaia (the personification of Earth in Greek mythology) objected and created the Scorpion.<ref>''prope nimia conjunctum amicitia vixisse''. Hyginus, ''Ast.'', 2.26</ref> In the second story, Apollo, being jealous of Orion's love for Artemis, which might even have made her willing to marry him, arranged for her to kill him. Seeing Orion swimming in the ocean, a long way off, he said that Artemis could not possibly hit that black thing in the water. Feeling challenged, she sent an arrow right through it and killed Orion; when his body washed up on shore, she wept copiously, and decided to place Orion among the stars.<ref>Hyginus, ''Ast.'' 2.34, quoting Istrus. Robert Graves divides  ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' into his own retelling of the myths and his explanations; in retelling Hyginus, Graves adds that Apollo challenged Artemis to hit \"that rascal [[Candaon]]\"; this is for narrative smoothness. It is not in his source.</ref> He connects Orion with several constellations, not just Scorpio. Orion chased [[Pleione (mythology)|Pleione]], the mother of the [[Pleiades (mythology)|Pleiades]], for seven years, until Zeus intervened and raised all of them to the stars.<ref>2.21</ref> In ''Works and Days'', Orion chases the Pleiades themselves. [[Canis Minor]] and [[Canis Major]] are his dogs, the one in front is called [[Procyon]]. They chase [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]], the hare, although Hyginus says some critics thought this too base a prey for the noble Orion and have him pursuing [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], the bull, instead.<ref>Hyginus, ''Astr.'' 2.33, 35\u201336; which also present these as the dogs of [[Procris]].</ref> A Renaissance mythographer adds other names for Orion's dogs: Leucomelaena, [[Maera (hound)|Maera]], Dromis, Cisseta, Lampuris, [[Lycoctonus]], Ptoophagus, Arctophonus.<ref>Natalis Comes, ''Mythologiae'', translated by Mulryan and Brown, p. 457/II 752. Whatever his interpretations, he is usually scrupulous about citing his sources, which he copies with \"stenographic accuracy\". Here, however, he says merely ''commemorantur'', ''adderunt'', which have the implied subject \"ancient writers\". The dog's names mean \"White-black\" (or perhaps \"gray\"), \"Sparkler\", \"Runner\", \"Yearned-for\", \"Shining\", \"Wolf-slayer\", \"Fear-eater\"(?) and \"Bear-slayer\".</ref>\n\n===Variants===\nThere are numerous variants in other authors. Most of these are incidental references in poems and [[scholia]]sts. The Roman poet [[Virgil]] shows Orion as a giant wading through the [[Aegean Sea]] with the waves breaking against his shoulders; rather than, as the mythographers have it, walking on the water.<ref>''[[Aeneis]]'' [https://archive.today/20120712032039/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Verg.+A.+10.755 10, 763\u2013767]</ref> There are several references to Hyrieus as the father of Orion that connect him to various places in [[Boeotia]], including [[Hyria (Boeotia)|Hyria]]; this may well be the original story (although not the first attested), since Hyrieus is presumably the [[:wikt:eponym|eponym]] of Hyria. He is also called Oeneus, although he is not the [[Oeneus|Calydonian Oeneus]].<ref>Pack, p.200; giving Hyginus's etymology for Urion, but describing it as \"fantastic\".

Gaisford, ''PMG''1:194, respectively</ref> There are two versions where Artemis killed Orion, either with her arrows or by producing the Scorpion. In the second variant, Orion died of the Scorpion's sting as he does in Hesiod. Although Orion does not defeat the Scorpion in any version, several variants have it die from its wounds. Artemis is given various motives. One is that Orion boasted of his beast-killing and challenged her to a contest with the [[discus]]. Another is that he assaulted either Artemis herself or [[Nymphai Hyperboreioi|Opis]], a [[Hyperborean]] maiden in her band of huntresses.<ref>Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheke'', and Frazer's notes.

Paola Dolcetti 2004; frag. 160 = 35a ''Frag. Hist. Gr'' = 35 Fowler.

One source refers to Merope as Oenopion's wife, not his daughter. Another refers to Merope as the daughter of Minos and not of Oenopion.<ref>Kerenyi, ''Gods of the Greeks'', pp. 201\u2013204; for Merope as the wife of Oenopion, he cites the scholiast on [[Nicander]], ''Theriaca'' 15.

Unlike most of Parthenius' stories, no source is noted in the MS.</ref> It describes Orion as slaying the wild beasts of Chios and looting the other inhabitants to make a bride-price for Oenopion's daughter, who is called A\u00ebro or Leiro.<ref>Both are emendations of Parthenius's text, which is Haero; ''A\u00ebro'' is from [[Stephen Gaselee (diplomat)|Stephen Gaselee]]'s Loeb edition; ''Leiro'' \"lily\" is from J. L. Lightfoot's 1999 edition of Parthenius, p.495, which records the several emendations suggested by other editors, which include Maero and Merope. \"Leiro\" is supported by a Hellenistic inscription from Chios, which mentions a ''Liro'' as a companion of Oenopion.</ref> Oenopion does not want to marry her to someone like Orion, and eventually Orion, in frustration, breaks into her bedchamber and rapes her. The text implies that Oenopion blinds him on the spot.\n\n[[Image:Orion constellation Hevelius.jpg|thumb|[[Johannes Hevelius]] drew the Orion constellation in ''Uranographia'', his celestial catalogue in 1690]] [[Lucian]] includes a picture with Orion in a rhetorical description of an ideal building, in which Orion is walking into the rising sun with Lemnos nearby, Cedalion on his shoulder.

He ravished her; when his father heard of this, he banished Orion. Orion consulted an oracle, which told him that if he went east, he would regain the glory of kingship.

At the end of this part of the work, he tells the story of Orion and two wonder-stories of his mighty earth-works in [[Sicily]].

He was then \"numbered among the stars of heaven and thus won for himself immortal remembrance\".<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]] iv 85.5; the intervening passage deals with the opposite aetiology of the Straits of Messina: that Sicily was once connected to the mainland, and the sea (or an earthquake) broke them apart.

Published in 1617.]]\nMythographers have discussed Orion at least since the [[Renaissance]] of classical learning; the Renaissance interpretations were allegorical. In the 14th century, Boccaccio interpreted the oxhide story as representing human conception; the hide is the womb, Neptune the moisture of semen, Jupiter its heat, and Mercury the female coldness; he also explained Orion's death at the hands of the moon-goddess as the Moon producing winter storms.<ref>Boccaccio, ''Genealogie'', Book 11 \u00a719, pp. 558 l. 30 to p.559 l.11.</ref> The 16th-century Italian mythographer [[Natalis Comes]] interpreted the whole story of Orion as an [[allegory]] of the evolution of a storm cloud: Begotten by air (Zeus), water (Poseidon), and the sun (Apollo), a storm cloud is diffused (Chios, which Comes derives from \u03c7\u03ad\u03c9, \"pour out\"), rises though the upper air ([[Air (classical element)|A\u00ebrope]], as Comes spells Merope), chills (is blinded), and is turned into rain by the moon (Artemis). He also explains how Orion walked on the sea: \"Since the subtler part of the water which is rarefied rests on the surface, it is said that Orion learned from his father how to walk on water.\"<ref>Gombrich (1994); Natalis Comes, ''Mythologiae'', translated by Mulryan and Brown, 459/II 754\u2013755.</ref> Similarly, Orion's conception made him a symbol of the [[Filius philosophorum|philosophical child]], an allegory of philosophy springing from multiple sources, in the Renaissance as in alchemical works, with some variations. The 16th-century German alchemist [[Michael Maier]] lists the fathers as Apollo, Vulcan and Mercury,<ref>\nMaier, Michael (1617).

There are some points of general agreement between them: for example, that the attack on Opis is an attack on Artemis, for Opis is one of the names of Artemis.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p.13 and note, but also Graves, Kerenyi and Rose.</ref>\n\nThere was a movement in the late nineteenth century to interpret all the Boeotian heroes as merely personifications of the constellations;<ref>Farnell (''Greek Hero Cults'' p. 21) doubts it, even of Orion.</ref> there has since come to be wide agreement that the myth of Orion existed before there was a constellation named for him. Homer, for example, mentions Orion, the Hunter, and Orion, the constellation, but never confuses the two.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p. 27; Graves; Kerenyi, ''Dionysus'', several mentions; the observation on Homer is from Rose, ''A Handbook'', p.117. The early nineteenth-century mythographer [[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller]] considered Orion the \"only purely mythological figure in the heavens\" and had also divided the myths into the original myths of the giant, and the figurative expressions of [[star lore]] after he was later identified with the constellation. [[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller]]: (1844 translation by John Leitch). ''Introduction to a Scientific System of Mythology'', pp. 133\u2013134. Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans.</ref> Once Orion was recognized as a constellation, astronomy in turn affected the myth. The story of Side may well be a piece of astronomical mythology. The Greek word ''side'' means [[pomegranate]], which bears fruit while Orion, the constellation, can be seen in the night sky.<ref>Frazer's notes to Apollodorus, citing a lexicon of 1884. Fontenrose is unconvinced.</ref> Rose suggests she is connected with Sidae in Boeotia, and that the pomegranate, as a sign of the Underworld, is connected with her descent there.<ref>Rose, ''A Handbook'', p. 116</ref>\n\nThe 19th-century German classical scholar [[Erwin Rohde]] viewed Orion as an example of the Greeks erasing the line between the gods and mankind. That is, if Orion was in the heavens, other mortals could hope to be also.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rohde |first=Erwin |year=1925 |title=Psyche: the cult of souls and belief in immortality among the Greeks |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt |oclc=2454243 |page=58}}</ref>\n\nThe Hungarian mythographer [[Karl Ker\u00e9nyi]], one of the founders of the modern study of Greek mythology, wrote about Orion in ''Gods of the Greeks'' (1951). Ker\u00e9nyi portrays Orion as a giant of [[Titan (mythology)|Titanic]] vigor and criminality, born outside his mother as were [[Tityos]] or [[Dionysus]].<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi believes the story of Hyrieus to be original, and that the pun on Orion/''ourion'' was made for the myth, rather than the other way around.</ref> Ker\u00e9nyi places great stress on the variant in which Merope is the wife of Oenopion. He sees this as the remnant of a lost form of the myth in which Merope was Orion's mother (converted by later generations to his stepmother and then to the present forms). Orion's blinding is therefore parallel to that of [[Aegypius (mythology)|Aegypius]] and [[Oedipus]].\n\nIn ''Dionysus'' (1976), Ker\u00e9nyi portrays Orion as a shamanic hunting hero, surviving from Minoan times (hence his association with Crete). Ker\u00e9nyi derives Hyrieus (and Hyria) from the Cretan dialect word ''\u1f55\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd - hyron'', meaning \"beehive\", which survives only in ancient dictionaries. From this association he turns Orion into a representative of the old [[mead]]-drinking cultures, overcome by the wine masters Oenopion and Oeneus. (The Greek for \"wine\" is ''oinos''.) Fontenrose cites a source stating that Oenopion taught the Chians how to make wine before anybody else knew how.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p. 9, citing [[Theopompus]]. 264 GH.</ref>\n\n[[Joseph Fontenrose]] wrote ''Orion : the Myth of the Hunter and the Huntress'' (1981) to show Orion as the [[type specimen]] of a variety of grotesque hero. Fontenrose views him as similar to [[C\u00fachulainn]], that is, stronger, larger, and more potent than ordinary men and the violent lover of the Divine Huntress; other heroes of the same type are [[Actaeon]], [[Leucippus (mythology)|Leucippus]] (son of [[Oenomaus]]), [[Cephalus]], [[Teiresias]], and [[Zeus]] as the lover of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]. Fontenrose also sees Eastern parallels in the figures of [[Aqhat]], [[Attis]], [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzi]], [[Gilgamesh]], [[Dushyanta]], and [[Prajapati]] (as pursuer of [[Ushas]]).\n\nIn ''The Greek Myths'' (1955), [[Robert Graves]] views Oenopion as his perennial [[Year-King]], at the stage where the king pretends to die at the end of his term and appoints a substitute, in this case Orion, who actually dies in his place. His blindness is iconotropy from a picture of Odysseus blinding the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]], mixed with a purely Hellenic solar legend: the Sun-hero is captured and blinded by his enemies at dusk, but escapes and regains his sight at dawn, when all beasts flee him. Graves sees the rest of the myth as a syncretism of diverse stories. These include Gilgamesh and the Scorpion-Men, Set becoming a scorpion to kill Horus and the story of [[Aqhat]] and Yatpan from [[Ras Shamra]], as well as a conjectural story of how the priestesses of Artemis Opis killed a visitor to their island of Ortygia. He compares Orion's birth from the bull's hide to a West African rainmaking charm and claims that the son of Poseidon should be a rainmaker.<ref>Graves, ''Greek Myths'', \u00a741, 1\u20135</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe ancient Greek and Roman sources which tell more about Orion than his being a gigantic huntsman are mostly both dry and obscure, but poets do write of him: The brief passages in Aratus and Virgil are mentioned [[#Variants|above]]. [[Pindar]] celebrates the [[Pankration|pancratist]] Melissus of Thebes \"who was not granted the build of an Orion\", but whose strength was still great.<ref>''Isthmian Odes'' 4.49; 3.67 for those who combine this Ode with the preceding one, also on Melissus. Quote from Race's Loeb translation.</ref>\n\n[[Cicero]] translated Aratus in his youth; he made the Orion episode half again longer than it was in the Greek, adding the traditional Latin [[literary topos|topos]] of madness to Aratus's text. Cicero's ''Aratea'' is one of the oldest Latin poems to come down to us as more than isolated lines; this episode may have established the technique of including [[Epic poetry|epyllia]] in non-epic poems.<ref>Kubiak, who quotes the passage. (33.418\u2013435 Soubiran).</ref>\n\nOrion is used by [[Horace]], who tells of his death at the hands of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]/[[Artemis]],<ref>[https://archive.today/20120717020804/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hor.+Carm.+3.4.1 ''Carmina'' 3.4.70]. The Roman goddess Diana was identified very early with Artemis, and her name was conventionally used to ''translate'' Artemis into Latin by Horace's time. This system of translation continued to be used, in Latin and English, up through the nineteenth century, and this article will use it for Roman poetry and for the Renaissance.

The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in [[Boeotia]], his visit to [[Chios]] where he met [[Merope (Oenopion)|Merope]] and after he [[Rape|violated]] her, was blinded by her father, [[Oenopion]], the recovery of his sight at [[Lemnos]], his hunting with [[Artemis]] on [[Crete]], his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became [[Scorpius|Scorpio]], and his elevation to the heavens.<ref>[[Scholia]] on ''[[Homer]], [[Iliad]]'' 18.486 citing Pherecydes</ref> Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories, and it is impossible to tell whether the omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.\n\nIn Greek literature he first appears as a great hunter in [[Homer]]'s epic the ''[[Odyssey]]'', where [[Odysseus]] sees his shade in the [[underworld]]. The bare bones of Orion's story are told by the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] and Roman collectors of myths, but there is no extant literary version of his adventures comparable, for example, to that of [[Jason]] in [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'' or [[Euripides]]' ''[[Medea]]''; the entry in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' for May 11 is a poem on the birth of Orion, but that is one version of a single story. The surviving fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation about Greek prehistory and myth.\n\nOrion served several roles in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] culture. The story of the adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the one for which there is the most evidence (and even for that, not very much); he is also the personification of the constellation of the same name; he was venerated as a [[Greek hero cult|hero]], in the Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia; and there is one [[etiology|etiological]] passage which says that Orion was responsible for the present shape of the [[Strait of Sicily]].\n\n==Legends==\n\n===Homer and Hesiod===\nOrion is mentioned in the oldest surviving works of Greek literature, which probably date back to the 7th or 8th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC, but which are the products of an oral tradition with origins several centuries earlier. In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' Orion is described as a constellation, and the star [[Sirius]] is mentioned as his dog.<ref>Il.[https://archive.today/20120712215800/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Il.+18.388 \u03a3 486\u2013489], on the shield of Achilles, and [https://archive.today/20120629052324/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Il.+22.1 \u03a7 29], respectively.</ref> In the ''[[Odyssey]]'', Odysseus sees him hunting in the underworld with a bronze club, a great slayer of animals; he is also mentioned as a constellation, as the lover of the [[Eos|Goddess Dawn]], as slain by [[Artemis]], and as the most handsome of the earthborn.<ref>\u03bb 572\u2013577 (as a hunter); \u03b5 273\u2013275, as a constellation (= \u03a3 487\u2013489); \u03b5 121\u2013124; \u03bb 572\u201377; \u03bb 309\u2013310; Rose (''A Handbook,'' p.117) notes that Homer never identifies the hunter and the constellation, and suggests that they were not originally the same.</ref> In the ''[[Works and Days]]'' of [[Hesiod]], Orion is also a constellation, one whose rising and setting with the sun is used to reckon the year.<ref>ll. 598, 623</ref>\n<span id=\"Seiter painting\"></span>\n[[Image:Diane aupr\u00e8s du cadavre d'Orion.jpg|thumb|[[Daniel Seiter]]'s 1685 painting of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] over Orion's corpse, before he is placed in the heavens]]\nThe legend of Orion was first told in full in a lost work by Hesiod, probably the ''[[Astronomia]]'' (simple references to \u2018''Hesiod''\u2019, below will refer to the lost text from ''[[Astronomia]]'', unless otherwise stated). This version is known through the work of [[Eratosthenes]] on the constellations, who gives a fairly long summary of Hesiod's episode on Orion.<ref>[[Eratosthenes]], ''[[Catasterismi]]''; translation in {{gutenberg|no=348|name=Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns, and Homerica by Hesiod|author=Evelyn-White, Hugh G.|year=1914}} Whether these works are actually by Hesiod and Eratosthenes themselves is doubtful; pseudo-Eratosthenes does not specify the work of Hesiod he is summarizing, but the modern assumption that it is the same work which other authors call the ''Astronomy'' is not particularly controversial. It is certainly neither the ''Theogony'' nor the ''Works and Days''.</ref> According to this version, Orion was likely the son of the sea-god [[Poseidon]] and Euryale,<ref>The summary of Hesiod simply says Euryale, but there is no reason to conflate her with [[Euryale (Gorgon)|Euryale]] the Gorgon, or to Euryale the Amazon of [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus]]; other ancient sources say explicitly Euryale, daughter of Minos.</ref> daughter of [[Minos]], King of Crete. Orion could walk on the waves because of his father; he walked to the island of [[Chios]] where he got drunk and attacked [[Merope (Oenopion)|Merope]],<ref>Apparently unrelated to the Merope who was one of the [[Pleiades (mythology)|Pleiades]].</ref> daughter of [[Oenopion]], the ruler there. In vengeance, Oenopion blinded Orion and drove him away. Orion stumbled to [[Lemnos]] where [[Hephaestus]] \u2014 the smith-god \u2014 had his forge. Hephaestus told his servant, [[Cedalion]], to guide Orion to the uttermost East where [[Helios]], the Sun, healed him; Orion carried Cedalion around on his shoulders. Orion returned to Chios to punish Oenopion, but the king hid away underground and escaped Orion's wrath. Orion's next journey took him to [[Crete]] where he hunted with the goddess [[Artemis]] and her mother [[Leto]], and in the course of the hunt, threatened to kill every beast on Earth. Mother [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]] ([[Apollo]] in some versions, disapproving of his sister's relationship with a male) objected and sent a giant scorpion to kill Orion. The creature succeeded, and after his death, the goddesses asked [[Zeus]] to place Orion among the constellations. Zeus consented and, as a memorial to the hero's death, added the [[Scorpius|Scorpion]] to the heavens as well.<ref>[[Scorpion]] is here a type of creature, Greek ''\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03c0\u03af\u03bf\u03c2,'' not a proper name. The constellation is called [[Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]] in astronomy; colloquially, [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], like the related astrological sign \u2014 both are Latin forms of the Greek word. Cicero used ''Nepa,'' the older Latin word for \"scorpion.\" See Kubiak's paper in the bibliography.</ref>\n\n===Other sources===\nAlthough Orion has a few lines in both Homeric poems and in the ''Works and Days'', most of the stories about him are recorded in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings. No great poet standardized the legend.<ref>Rose, ''A Handbook'', p.116\u2013117</ref> The ancient sources for Orion's legend are mostly notes in the margins of ancient poets ([[scholia]]) or compilations by later scholars, the equivalent of modern reference works or encyclopedias; even the legend from Hesiod's ''Astronomy'' survives only in one such compilation. In several cases, including the summary of the ''Astronomy'', although the surviving work bears the name of a famous scholar, such as [[Apollodorus of Athens]], [[Eratosthenes]], or [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], what survives is either an ancient forgery or an abridgement of the original compilation by a later writer of dubious competence; editors of these texts suggest that they may have borne the names of great scholars because they were abridgments, or even pupil's notes, based on the works of the scholars.<ref>''Oxford Classical Dictionary''. Under \"Apollodorus of Athens (6)\" it describes the [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]] as an uncritical forgery some centuries later than Apollodorus; it distinguishes \"Hyginus (4)\", the author of the ''Fabulae'' and ''Astronomy'', from \"Hyginus (1)\", (C. Julius) adding of the former that the \"absurdities\" of this \"abbreviated\" compilation are \"partly due to its compiler's ignorance of Greek.\" Under \"Eratosthenes\", it dismisses the surviving ''Catasterismi'' as pseudo-Eratosthenic. See Frazer's Loeb Apollodorus, and Condos's translation of the other two (as ''Star myths of the Greeks and Romans'' Phanes, 1997, {{ISBN|1-890482-92-7}}) for the editorial opinions.</ref>\n\nThe margin of the Empress [[Aelia Eudocia|Eudocia]]'s copy of the Iliad has a note summarizing a Hellenistic poet<ref>[[Euphorion of Chalcis]], who wrote in the 2nd century BC. The MS is Allen's [[Venetus A]], scholion to \u03a3 486 Dindorf ''Scholia in Iliadem'' II, 171, l.7\u201320; Erbse's Scholia at line cited (Vol.4).</ref> who tells a different story of Orion's birth. Here the gods [[Zeus]], [[Hermes]], and [[Poseidon]] come to visit [[Hyrieus]] of [[Tanagra]], who roasts a whole bull for them.<ref>The ancient sources for this story all phrase it so that this could be either a bull or a cow; translations vary, although \"bull\" may be more common. A bull would be an appropriate sacrifice to male gods.</ref> When they offer him a favor, he asks for the birth of sons. The gods take the bull's hide and [[urinate]] into it<ref>Both are represented by the same Greek participle, ''ourion'', thus explaining Orion's name; the version that has come down to us as [Pseudo]-[[Palaephatus]], ''On Unbelievable Tales'' \u00a751 uses ''apespermenan'' (\"to spread seed\") and ''our\u0113sai'' (the infinitive of ''ourion'') in different sentences. The Latin translations by Hyginus are ambiguous. Ejaculation of semen is the more obvious interpretation here, and Kerenyi assumes it; but [[John Peter Oleson]] argued, in the note to p.28 of [https://www.jstor.org/stable/294109 A Possible Physiological Basis for the Term urinator, \"diver\"] (''The American Journal of Philology, Vol. 97'', No. 1.

Here Orion is described as earthborn and enormous in stature. This version also mentions Poseidon and Euryale as his parents. It adds a first marriage to [[Side (mythology)|Side]] before his marriage to Merope. All that is known about Side is that [[Hera]] threw her into [[Hades]] for rivalling her in beauty. It also gives a different version of Orion's death than the ''[[Iliad]]'': [[Eos]], the Dawn, fell in love with Orion and took him to [[Delos]] where Artemis killed him.<ref>The ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' [https://archive.today/20120905022144/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Apollod.+1.4.3 1.4.3\u20131.4.5].

Paragraphing according to [[Ghislane Vir\u00e9]]'s 1992 [[Teubner]] edition. Modern scholarship holds that these are not the original work of Hyginus either, but latter condensations: a teacher's, possibly a student's, notes.</ref> It begins with the oxhide story of Orion's birth, which this source ascribes to [[Callimachus]] and Aristomachus, and sets the location at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] or Chios.<ref>Aristomachus of Soli wrote on bee-keeping (''Oxford Classical Dictionary'': \"Bee-keeping\").</ref> Hyginus has two versions. In one of them he omits Poseidon;<ref>In the [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica2.html#34 ''Astronomia;''] the [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae4.html#195 ''Fabulae''] have Poseidon.</ref> a modern critic suggests this is the original version.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion''.</ref>\n\nThe same source tells two stories of the death of Orion. The first says that because of his \"living joined in too great a friendship\" with [[Oenopion]], he boasted to [[Artemis]] and [[Leto]] that he could kill anything which came from Earth. Gaia (the personification of Earth in Greek mythology) objected and created the Scorpion.<ref>''prope nimia conjunctum amicitia vixisse''. Hyginus, ''Ast.'', 2.26</ref> In the second story, Apollo, being jealous of Orion's love for Artemis, which might even have made her willing to marry him, arranged for her to kill him. Seeing Orion swimming in the ocean, a long way off, he said that Artemis could not possibly hit that black thing in the water. Feeling challenged, she sent an arrow right through it and killed Orion; when his body washed up on shore, she wept copiously, and decided to place Orion among the stars.<ref>Hyginus, ''Ast.'' 2.34, quoting Istrus. Robert Graves divides  ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' into his own retelling of the myths and his explanations; in retelling Hyginus, Graves adds that Apollo challenged Artemis to hit \"that rascal [[Candaon]]\"; this is for narrative smoothness. It is not in his source.</ref> He connects Orion with several constellations, not just Scorpio. Orion chased [[Pleione (mythology)|Pleione]], the mother of the [[Pleiades (mythology)|Pleiades]], for seven years, until Zeus intervened and raised all of them to the stars.<ref>2.21</ref> In ''Works and Days'', Orion chases the Pleiades themselves. [[Canis Minor]] and [[Canis Major]] are his dogs, the one in front is called [[Procyon]]. They chase [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]], the hare, although Hyginus says some critics thought this too base a prey for the noble Orion and have him pursuing [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], the bull, instead.<ref>Hyginus, ''Astr.'' 2.33, 35\u201336; which also present these as the dogs of [[Procris]].</ref> A Renaissance mythographer adds other names for Orion's dogs: Leucomelaena, [[Maera (hound)|Maera]], Dromis, Cisseta, Lampuris, [[Lycoctonus]], Ptoophagus, Arctophonus.<ref>Natalis Comes, ''Mythologiae'', translated by Mulryan and Brown, p. 457/II 752. Whatever his interpretations, he is usually scrupulous about citing his sources, which he copies with \"stenographic accuracy\". Here, however, he says merely ''commemorantur'', ''adderunt'', which have the implied subject \"ancient writers\". The dog's names mean \"White-black\" (or perhaps \"gray\"), \"Sparkler\", \"Runner\", \"Yearned-for\", \"Shining\", \"Wolf-slayer\", \"Fear-eater\"(?) and \"Bear-slayer\".</ref>\n\n===Variants===\nThere are numerous variants in other authors. Most of these are incidental references in poems and [[scholia]]sts. The Roman poet [[Virgil]] shows Orion as a giant wading through the [[Aegean Sea]] with the waves breaking against his shoulders; rather than, as the mythographers have it, walking on the water.<ref>''[[Aeneis]]'' [https://archive.today/20120712032039/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Verg.+A.+10.755 10, 763\u2013767]</ref> There are several references to Hyrieus as the father of Orion that connect him to various places in [[Boeotia]], including [[Hyria (Boeotia)|Hyria]]; this may well be the original story (although not the first attested), since Hyrieus is presumably the [[:wikt:eponym|eponym]] of Hyria. He is also called Oeneus, although he is not the [[Oeneus|Calydonian Oeneus]].<ref>Pack, p.200; giving Hyginus's etymology for Urion, but describing it as \"fantastic\". Oeneus from Kerenyi, ''Gods'', citing [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]]'s [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Serv.+A.+10.763 note] to [[Aeneid]] 10.763; which actually reads Oenopion; but this may be corruption.</ref> Other ancient scholia say, as Hesiod does, that Orion was the son of Poseidon and his mother was a daughter of Minos; but they call the daughter Brylle or Hyeles.<ref>Mulryan and Brown, trans. of Natalis Comes, Vol II, p. 752.

Gaisford, ''PMG''1:194, respectively</ref> There are two versions where Artemis killed Orion, either with her arrows or by producing the Scorpion. In the second variant, Orion died of the Scorpion's sting as he does in Hesiod. Although Orion does not defeat the Scorpion in any version, several variants have it die from its wounds. Artemis is given various motives. One is that Orion boasted of his beast-killing and challenged her to a contest with the [[discus]]. Another is that he assaulted either Artemis herself or [[Nymphai Hyperboreioi|Opis]], a [[Hyperborean]] maiden in her band of huntresses.<ref>Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheke'', and Frazer's notes. Artemis is called Opis in [[Callimachus]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Call.+H.+3+hymns+3.170 Hymn 3.204''f''] and elsewhere (Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p. 13).</ref> [[Aratus]]'s brief description, in his ''Astronomy'', conflates the elements of the myth: according to Aratus, Orion attacks Artemis while hunting on ''Chios'', and the Scorpion kills him there.<ref>Aratus, ''Phaenomena'' I, 634\u2013646. quoted in Kubiak, p. 14.</ref> [[Nicander]], in his ''Theriaca'', has the scorpion of ordinary size and hiding under a small (''oligos'') stone.<ref>Nicander, ''Theriaca'', lines 15\u201320.</ref> Most versions of the story that continue after Orion's death tell of the gods raising Orion and the Scorpion to the stars, but even here a variant exists: Ancient poets differed greatly on whom [[Aesculapius]] brought back from the dead;<ref>Zeus slew Aesculapius for his presumption in raising the dead, so there was only one subject.</ref> the Argive epic poet [[Telesarchus]] is quoted as saying in a scholion that Aesculapius resurrected Orion.<ref>[[Pherecydes of Athens]] ''Testimonianze i frammenti'' ed.

Published in 1617.]]\nMythographers have discussed Orion at least since the [[Renaissance]] of classical learning; the Renaissance interpretations were allegorical. In the 14th century, Boccaccio interpreted the oxhide story as representing human conception; the hide is the womb, Neptune the moisture of semen, Jupiter its heat, and Mercury the female coldness; he also explained Orion's death at the hands of the moon-goddess as the Moon producing winter storms.<ref>Boccaccio, ''Genealogie'', Book 11 \u00a719, pp. 558 l. 30 to p.559 l.11.</ref> The 16th-century Italian mythographer [[Natalis Comes]] interpreted the whole story of Orion as an [[allegory]] of the evolution of a storm cloud: Begotten by air (Zeus), water (Poseidon), and the sun (Apollo), a storm cloud is diffused (Chios, which Comes derives from \u03c7\u03ad\u03c9, \"pour out\"), rises though the upper air ([[Air (classical element)|A\u00ebrope]], as Comes spells Merope), chills (is blinded), and is turned into rain by the moon (Artemis). He also explains how Orion walked on the sea: \"Since the subtler part of the water which is rarefied rests on the surface, it is said that Orion learned from his father how to walk on water.\"<ref>Gombrich (1994); Natalis Comes, ''Mythologiae'', translated by Mulryan and Brown, 459/II 754\u2013755.</ref> Similarly, Orion's conception made him a symbol of the [[Filius philosophorum|philosophical child]], an allegory of philosophy springing from multiple sources, in the Renaissance as in alchemical works, with some variations. The 16th-century German alchemist [[Michael Maier]] lists the fathers as Apollo, Vulcan and Mercury,<ref>\nMaier, Michael (1617).

There are some points of general agreement between them: for example, that the attack on Opis is an attack on Artemis, for Opis is one of the names of Artemis.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p.13 and note, but also Graves, Kerenyi and Rose.</ref>\n\nThere was a movement in the late nineteenth century to interpret all the Boeotian heroes as merely personifications of the constellations;<ref>Farnell (''Greek Hero Cults'' p. 21) doubts it, even of Orion.</ref> there has since come to be wide agreement that the myth of Orion existed before there was a constellation named for him. Homer, for example, mentions Orion, the Hunter, and Orion, the constellation, but never confuses the two.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p. 27; Graves; Kerenyi, ''Dionysus'', several mentions; the observation on Homer is from Rose, ''A Handbook'', p.117. The early nineteenth-century mythographer [[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller]] considered Orion the \"only purely mythological figure in the heavens\" and had also divided the myths into the original myths of the giant, and the figurative expressions of [[star lore]] after he was later identified with the constellation. [[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller]]: (1844 translation by John Leitch). ''Introduction to a Scientific System of Mythology'', pp. 133\u2013134. Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans.</ref> Once Orion was recognized as a constellation, astronomy in turn affected the myth. The story of Side may well be a piece of astronomical mythology. The Greek word ''side'' means [[pomegranate]], which bears fruit while Orion, the constellation, can be seen in the night sky.<ref>Frazer's notes to Apollodorus, citing a lexicon of 1884. Fontenrose is unconvinced.</ref> Rose suggests she is connected with Sidae in Boeotia, and that the pomegranate, as a sign of the Underworld, is connected with her descent there.<ref>Rose, ''A Handbook'', p. 116</ref>\n\nThe 19th-century German classical scholar [[Erwin Rohde]] viewed Orion as an example of the Greeks erasing the line between the gods and mankind. That is, if Orion was in the heavens, other mortals could hope to be also.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rohde |first=Erwin |year=1925 |title=Psyche: the cult of souls and belief in immortality among the Greeks |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt |oclc=2454243 |page=58}}</ref>\n\nThe Hungarian mythographer [[Karl Ker\u00e9nyi]], one of the founders of the modern study of Greek mythology, wrote about Orion in ''Gods of the Greeks'' (1951). Ker\u00e9nyi portrays Orion as a giant of [[Titan (mythology)|Titanic]] vigor and criminality, born outside his mother as were [[Tityos]] or [[Dionysus]].<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi believes the story of Hyrieus to be original, and that the pun on Orion/''ourion'' was made for the myth, rather than the other way around.</ref> Ker\u00e9nyi places great stress on the variant in which Merope is the wife of Oenopion. He sees this as the remnant of a lost form of the myth in which Merope was Orion's mother (converted by later generations to his stepmother and then to the present forms). Orion's blinding is therefore parallel to that of [[Aegypius (mythology)|Aegypius]] and [[Oedipus]].\n\nIn ''Dionysus'' (1976), Ker\u00e9nyi portrays Orion as a shamanic hunting hero, surviving from Minoan times (hence his association with Crete). Ker\u00e9nyi derives Hyrieus (and Hyria) from the Cretan dialect word ''\u1f55\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd - hyron'', meaning \"beehive\", which survives only in ancient dictionaries. From this association he turns Orion into a representative of the old [[mead]]-drinking cultures, overcome by the wine masters Oenopion and Oeneus. (The Greek for \"wine\" is ''oinos''.) Fontenrose cites a source stating that Oenopion taught the Chians how to make wine before anybody else knew how.<ref>Fontenrose, ''Orion'', p. 9, citing [[Theopompus]]. 264 GH.</ref>\n\n[[Joseph Fontenrose]] wrote ''Orion : the Myth of the Hunter and the Huntress'' (1981) to show Orion as the [[type specimen]] of a variety of grotesque hero. Fontenrose views him as similar to [[C\u00fachulainn]], that is, stronger, larger, and more potent than ordinary men and the violent lover of the Divine Huntress; other heroes of the same type are [[Actaeon]], [[Leucippus (mythology)|Leucippus]] (son of [[Oenomaus]]), [[Cephalus]], [[Teiresias]], and [[Zeus]] as the lover of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]. Fontenrose also sees Eastern parallels in the figures of [[Aqhat]], [[Attis]], [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzi]], [[Gilgamesh]], [[Dushyanta]], and [[Prajapati]] (as pursuer of [[Ushas]]).\n\nIn ''The Greek Myths'' (1955), [[Robert Graves]] views Oenopion as his perennial [[Year-King]], at the stage where the king pretends to die at the end of his term and appoints a substitute, in this case Orion, who actually dies in his place. His blindness is iconotropy from a picture of Odysseus blinding the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]], mixed with a purely Hellenic solar legend: the Sun-hero is captured and blinded by his enemies at dusk, but escapes and regains his sight at dawn, when all beasts flee him. Graves sees the rest of the myth as a syncretism of diverse stories. These include Gilgamesh and the Scorpion-Men, Set becoming a scorpion to kill Horus and the story of [[Aqhat]] and Yatpan from [[Ras Shamra]], as well as a conjectural story of how the priestesses of Artemis Opis killed a visitor to their island of Ortygia. He compares Orion's birth from the bull's hide to a West African rainmaking charm and claims that the son of Poseidon should be a rainmaker.<ref>Graves, ''Greek Myths'', \u00a741, 1\u20135</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe ancient Greek and Roman sources which tell more about Orion than his being a gigantic huntsman are mostly both dry and obscure, but poets do write of him: The brief passages in Aratus and Virgil are mentioned [[#Variants|above]]. [[Pindar]] celebrates the [[Pankration|pancratist]] Melissus of Thebes \"who was not granted the build of an Orion\", but whose strength was still great.<ref>''Isthmian Odes'' 4.49; 3.67 for those who combine this Ode with the preceding one, also on Melissus. Quote from Race's Loeb translation.</ref>\n\n[[Cicero]] translated Aratus in his youth; he made the Orion episode half again longer than it was in the Greek, adding the traditional Latin [[literary topos|topos]] of madness to Aratus's text. Cicero's ''Aratea'' is one of the oldest Latin poems to come down to us as more than isolated lines; this episode may have established the technique of including [[Epic poetry|epyllia]] in non-epic poems.<ref>Kubiak, who quotes the passage.

The Roman goddess Diana was identified very early with Artemis, and her name was conventionally used to ''translate'' Artemis into Latin by Horace's time. This system of translation continued to be used, in Latin and English, up through the nineteenth century, and this article will use it for Roman poetry and for the Renaissance.

Its main focus of research and teaching are the past and contemporary societies of the Pacific, Australia included.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe CREDO was created in 1995 as an UMR (Unit\u00e9 Mixe de Recherche) of the CNRS and the [[EHESS]] in [[Marseilles, France]]. The principal founders of the CREDO are Pierre Lemonnier and Serge Tcherk\u00e9zoff, with Maurice Godelier. From the very first year of its creation, its members wanted to be associated to the [[University of Provence]] in order to teach and supervise students from both major institutions in the South of France in the Humanities and Social Sciences.\n\nIn early March 1999, the CREDO left its original location in the Vieille Charit\u00e9, hosted by the EHESS, and moved to the Saint-Charles Campus at the University of provence. Next to IRSEA (Laboratory on South-East Asia), and a new centre for documentation (MAP), the CREDO is now one of the three constituents of the Maison Asie Pacifique.\n\nPrevious directors of the Centre were [[Maurice Godelier]]<ref>[http://www.pacific-credo.fr/index.php?page=maurice-godelier&hl=en page at CREDO website]</ref> and [[Serge Tcherk\u00e9zoff]].<ref>[http://www.pacific-credo.fr/index.php?page=serge-tcherkezoff&hl=en page at CREDO website]</ref> The current director is [[Laurent Dousset]].<ref>[http://www.pacific-credo.fr/index.php?page=dousset-laurent&hl=en page at CREDO website]</ref>\n\n== Research activities ==\nThe CREDO is engaged in a great number of research activities that are currently divided into 6 general themes:\n\n* ''Theme 1'' : Configuration and dynamics of [[Identity (social science)|identity]]: historical and contemporaneous processes of national constructions, regionalization and globalization.\n* ''Theme 2'' : Knowledge of the past: A critical historiography of the [[Pacific]]\n* ''Theme 3'' : The person: [[Gender]] and [[kinship]], sexuation, socialization and individuation.\n* ''Theme 4'' : Ritual logics: symbolic, relational and cognitive approaches\n* ''Theme 5'' : [[Anthropology]] of knowledge: material culture, aesthetic manifestations and biodiversity\n* ''Theme 6'' : [[Visual anthropology]], [[hypermedia]] and [[information systems]]\n\n== Center for Documentation ==\n\nThe CREDO hosts its own center for documentation specialized in pacific publications and archival material. Currently, the center has more than 8000 books, and is subscribed to 23 scientific journals. It also owns a certain number of theses, offprints, various collections etc. The online catalog of the collection is accessible from the CREDO webpage\n\n== Particular projects ==\n\nThe CREDO is engaged in research and documentary projects, including:\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081112213220/http://odsas.pacific-credo.fr/ ODSAS] (Online Digital Sources and Annotation System), with the [[CNRS]].\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081111174815/http://austkin.pacific-credo.fr/ AustKin] (Tracing changes in the family structure of Aboriginal Australian Societies), with the [[Australian National University]].\n* Pacific Encounters (first contact history in the Pacific), with the University of Auckland and the [[Australian National University]].\n\n== Recent publications by the CREDO ==\n\n* BONNEM\u00c8RE, P.

Its main focus of research and teaching are the past and contemporary societies of the Pacific, Australia included.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe CREDO was created in 1995 as an UMR (Unit\u00e9 Mixe de Recherche) of the CNRS and the [[EHESS]] in [[Marseilles, France]]. The principal founders of the CREDO are Pierre Lemonnier and Serge Tcherk\u00e9zoff, with Maurice Godelier. From the very first year of its creation, its membres wanted to be associated to the [[University of Provence]] in order to teach and supervise students from both major institutions in the South of France in the Humanities and Social Sciences.\n\nIn early March 1999, the CREDO left its original location in the Vieille Charit\u00e9, hosted by the EHESS, and moved to the Saint-Charles Campus at the University of provence. Next to IRSEA (Laboratory on South-East Asia), and a new centre for documentation (MAP), the CREDO is now one of the three constituents of the Maison Asie Pacifique.\n\nPrevious directors of the Centre were [[Maurice Godelier]]<ref>[http://www.pacific-credo.fr/index.php?page=maurice-godelier&hl=en page at CREDO website]</ref> and [[Serge Tcherk\u00e9zoff]].<ref>[http://www.pacific-credo.fr/index.php?page=serge-tcherkezoff&hl=en page at CREDO website]</ref> The current director is [[Laurent Dousset]].<ref>[http://www.pacific-credo.fr/index.php?page=dousset-laurent&hl=en page at CREDO website]</ref>\n\n== Research activities ==\nThe CREDO is engaged in a great number of research activities that are currently divided into 6 general themes:\n\n* ''Theme 1'' : Configuration and dynamics of [[Identity (social science)|identity]]: historical and contemporaneous processes of national constructions, regionalization and globalization.\n* ''Theme 2'' : Knowledge of the past: A critical historiography of the [[Pacific]]\n* ''Theme 3'' : The person: [[Gender]] and [[kinship]], sexuation, socialization and individuation.\n* ''Theme 4'' : Ritual logics: symbolic, relational and cognitive approaches\n* ''Theme 5'' : [[Anthropology]] of knowledge: material culture, aesthetic manifestations and biodiversity\n* ''Theme 6'' : [[Visual anthropology]], [[hypermedia]] and [[information systems]]\n\n== Center for Documentation ==\n\nThe CREDO hosts its own center for documentation specialized in pacific publications and archival material. Currently, the center has more than 8000 books, and is subscribed to 23 scientific journals. It also owns a certain number of theses, offprints, various collections etc. The online catalog of the collection is accessible from the CREDO webpage\n\n== Particular projects ==\n\nThe CREDO is engaged in research and documentary projects, including:\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081112213220/http://odsas.pacific-credo.fr/ ODSAS] (Online Digital Sources and Annotation System), with the [[CNRS]].\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081111174815/http://austkin.pacific-credo.fr/ AustKin] (Tracing changes in the family structure of Aboriginal Australian Societies), with the [[Australian National University]].\n* Pacific Encounters (first contact history in the Pacific), with the University of Auckland and the [[Australian National University]].\n\n== Recent publications by the CREDO ==\n\n* BONNEM\u00c8RE, P.

The insertion of [[voice acting|voice actor]] performances for [[animation]], such as [[computer generated imagery]] or [[animated cartoon]]s, is often referred to as ADR although it generally does not replace existing dialogue.\n\nThe ADR process may be used to: \n\n:*remove extraneous sounds such as production equipment noise, traffic, wind, or other undesirable sounds from the environment\n:*change the original lines recorded on set to clarify context \n:*improve [[diction]] or modify an [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]\n:*improve [[comic timing|comedic timing]] or dramatic timing\n:*correct technical issues with [[synchronization|synchronisation]]\n:*use a studio-quality singing performance or provide a voice-double for actors who are poor vocalists\n:*add or remove content for legal purposes (such as removing an unauthorised trademarked name)\n:*add or remove a product placement\n:*correct a misspoken line not caught during filming.\n:*replace foul language for TV broadcasts of a movie or other program\nIn conventional film production, a [[production sound mixer]] records dialogue during filming. During post-production, a supervising [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]], or ADR supervisor, reviews all of the dialogue in the film and decides which lines must be re-recorded. ADR is recorded during an ADR session, which takes place in a specialised [[Recording studio|sound studio]]. The actor, usually the original actor from the set, views the scene with the original sound, then attempts to recreate the performance. Over the course of multiple [[take]]s, the actor performs the lines while watching the scene; the most suitable take becomes the final version.<ref>{{cite web |title=ADR |publisher=FilmSound.org |url=http://filmsound.org/terminology/adr.htm |accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref> The ADR process does not always take place in a post-production studio. The process may be recorded on location, with mobile equipment. ADR can also be recorded without showing the actor the image they must match, but by having them listen to the performance, since some actors{{who|date=June 2019}} believe that watching themselves act can degrade subsequent performances.\n\nSometimes, an actor other than the original actor is used during ADR. One famous example is the ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Darth Vader]], portrayed by [[David Prowse]]; in post-production, [[James Earl Jones]] dubbed the voice of Vader.<ref>{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |title=Film: Lucas Returns with 'The Jedi' |date=25 May 1983 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9c00e3d71e38f936a15756c0a965948260 |accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nOther examples include:\n*[[Jean Hagen]] provided [[Debbie Reynolds]]' voice in two scenes of ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952). Ironically, the film's story has Reynolds' character, Kathy Seldon, dubbing the voice for ''Hagen's'' character, Lina Lamont, due to Lina's grating voice and strong New York accent. Hagen used her own normal melodious voice to portray Kathy dubbing for Lina. The film, which takes place in Hollywood as talking pictures are taking over from silent films, also portrays another character, Cosmo Brown, played by [[Donald O'Connor]], as inventing the idea of using one actor to provide the voice for another.\n*[[Marni Nixon]] provided the singing voice for the character [[Eliza Doolittle]], otherwise played by [[Audrey Hepburn]], in the 1964 musical film ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''. Nixon was also the singing voices for [[Deborah Kerr]] in ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' and [[Natalie Wood]] in ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'', among many others.\n*[[Ray Park]], who acted as [[Darth Maul]] from ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' had his voice dubbed over by [[Peter Serafinowicz]]\n*Frenchmen [[Philippe Noiret]] and [[Jacques Perrin]], who were dubbed into Italian for ''[[Cinema Paradiso]]''\n*Austrian bodybuilder [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], dubbed for ''[[Hercules in New York]]''\n*Argentine boxer [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]], dubbed by a professional actor for the lead in the drama ''[[La Mary]]''\n*[[Gert Fr\u00f6be]], who played [[Auric Goldfinger]] in the James Bond film [[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]], dubbed by [[Michael Collins (English actor)|Michael Collins]]\n*[[Andie MacDowell]]'s Jane, in ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]'', who was dubbed by [[Glenn Close]]\n*[[Tom Hardy]], who portrayed [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] in ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', re-dubbed half of his own lines for ease of viewer comprehension\n*[[Harvey Keitel]] was dubbed by [[Roy Dotrice]] in post production for ''[[Saturn 3]]''\n*[[Dave Coulier]] dubbed replacement of swear words for [[Richard Pryor]] in multiple TV versions of his movies\n*[[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] was dubbed by [[Laurence Fishburne]] in post production for ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]''\n\n===Process===\nThe tasks involved are performed by three different agents{{clarify|What are agents, and what are the three kinds of agents?|date=June 2019}} in the dubbing process: \n# translation \n# take segmentation \n# insertion of dubbing symbols \n# lip-sync \n# dialogue writing and the emulation of natural discourse\n\nSometimes the translator performs all five tasks. In other cases, the translator just submits a rough translation and a dialogue writer does the rest.\n\n====Dialog writing====\n\nThe dialogue writer\u2019s role is to make the translation sound natural of the target language, and to make the translation sound like a credible dialogue instead of merely a translated text.<ref>Chaume, F. (2013). Research paths in audiovisual translation: The case of dubbing. In The Routledge handbook of translation studies (pp. \n306-320). Routledge.</ref>\n\nAnother task of dialogue writers is to check whether a translation matches an on-screen character\u2019s mouth movements or not, by reading aloud simultaneously with the character. The dialogue writer often stays in the recording setting with the actors or the voice talents, to ensure that the dialogue is being spoken in the way that it was written to be, and to avoid any ambiguity in the way the dialogue is to be read (focusing on emphasis, intonation, pronunciation, articulation, pronouncing foreign words correctly, etc.). The overall goal is to make sure the script creates the illusion of authenticity of the spoken language.\n\n====Rythmo band====\nAn alternative method to dubbing, called \"rythmo band\" (or \"[[Lip sync|lip-sync]] band\"), has historically been used in [[Canada]] and [[France]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} It provides a more precise guide{{explain|how is it more precise? What's the difference?|date=June 2019}} for the actors, [[Film director|directors]], and technicians, and can be used to complement the traditional ADR method. The \"band\" is actually a clear 35&nbsp;mm [[film leader]] on which the dialogue is hand-written in [[India ink]], together with numerous additional indications for the actor\u2014including laughs, cries, length of syllables, mouth sounds, breaths, and mouth openings and closings. The rythmo band is projected in the studio and scrolls in perfect synchronisation with the picture.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nStudio time is used more efficiently, since with the aid of scrolling text, picture, and audio cues, actors can read more lines per hour than with ADR alone (only picture and audio). With ADR, actors can average 10\u201312 lines per hour, while rythmo band can facilitate the reading of 35-50 lines per hour.<ref>{{cite web |title=U of U Sound Final |url=http://quizlet.com/8640541/u-of-u-sound-final-flash-cards/ |work=Quizlet |publisher=Quizlet LLC |accessdate=30 July 2012 |author=Quizlet |year=2012}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the preparation of a rythmo band is a time-consuming process involving a series of specialists organised in a production line. This has prevented the technique from being more widely adopted, but software emulations of rythmo band technology overcome the disadvantages of the traditional rythmo band process and significantly reduce the time needed to prepare a dubbing session.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}o\n\n==<span id=\"Practice of dubbing foreign films throughout the world\"></span> Global use==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Dub localization===\nDub localization, also often simply referred to as [[Language localization|localization]], is the practice of [[voice-over translation]] that alters a [[film]] or [[television series]] from one region of the world to the local language of another.\n\nThe new voice track is usually spoken by a [[voice actor]]. In many countries, actors who regularly perform this duty remain little-known, with the exception of particular circles (such as anime [[fandom]]) or when their voices have become synonymous with roles or actors whose voices they usually dub. In the United States, many of these voice artists may employ pseudonyms or go uncredited due to [[Screen Actors Guild]] regulations or the desire to dissociate themselves from the role.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nDub localisation is a contentious issue in [[cinephilia]] amongst aficionados of foreign [[filmmaking]] and [[television program]]s, particularly [[anime]] fans. While some localisation is virtually inevitable in translation, the controversy surrounding how much localisation is \"too much\" is often discussed in such communities, especially when the final dub product is significantly different from the original. Some fans frown on any extensive localisation, while others expect it, and to varying degrees, appreciate it.\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Dubbing films in Europe.png|thumb|300px|{{legend|#0000FF|Dubbing only for children: Otherwise solely subtitles.}}\n{{legend|#FF0000|General dubbing: Countries using a full-cast dubbing.}}\n{{legend|#FFFF00|Voice-over: Countries using a couple or just one voice actor, whereas the original soundtrack persists.

For movies in cinemas with clear target audiences (both below and above 10\u201311 years of age), both a dubbed and a subtitled version are usually available.\n\n=====Albania=====\nThe first movie dubbed in [[Albanian language]] was ''[[The Great Warrior Skanderbeg]]'' in 1954 and since then, there have been thousands of popular titles dubbed in Albanian by different dubbing studios. All animated movies and children's programs are dubbed into Albanian language, many live-action movies as well. TV series nevertheless are usually not dubbed, they are subtitled except for a few [[Mexico|Mexican]], [[Brazil]]ian and [[Turkey|Turkish]] soap operas, like: ''[[Por ti (telenovela)|Por Ti]]'', ''[[Celebridade]]'', ''[[A Casa das Sete Mulheres]]'', ''[[Parampar\u00e7a (TV series)|Parampar\u00e7a]]'', etc. As for documentaries, Albania usually uses voice-over.\n\n=====Belgium=====\nIn the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium ([[Flanders]]), movies and TV series are shown in their original language with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], with the exception of most movies made for a young audience. In the latter case, sometimes separate versions are recorded in the [[Netherlands]] and in [[Flanders]] (for instance, several [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Walt Disney films]] and [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]]). These dubbed versions only differ from each other in their use of different voice actors and different pronunciation, while the text is almost the same.\n\nIn the French-speaking part of Belgium ([[Wallonia]]), the range of French-dubbed versions is approximately as wide as the [[German language|German]] range, where nearly all movies and TV series are dubbed.\n\n=====Bosnia and Herzegovina=====\n[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] usually uses [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] dubs, but they have dubbed some cartoons in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] by themselves, for example ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]''. Children's programs (both animated and live-action) are airing dubbed (in Serbian, Croatian or Bosnian), while every other program is subtitled (in Bosnian).\n\n=====Croatia=====\nIn [[Croatia]], foreign films and TV series are always subtitled, while most children's programs and animated movies are dubbed into [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. The practice of dubbing began in the 1980s in some animated shows and continued in 90's, 00's and forward in other shows and films, the latter ones being released in home media. Recently, more efforts have been made to introduce dubbing, but public reception has been poor in some exceptions. Regardless of language, Croatian audiences prefer subtitling to dubbing, however it is still popular in animated films. Some previously popular shows (such as ''[[Sailor Moon]]'') lost their appeal completely after the practice of dubbing began, and the dubbing was eventually removed from the programs, even though most animated shows shown on television and some on home media have been well received by people watching dubbed versions of them. This situation is similar with theater movies, with only those intended for children being dubbed (such as ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and ''[[Shark Tale]]''), but nowadays are shown in dubbed versions. Also, there has been an effort to impose dubbing by [[Nova TV (Croatia)|Nova TV]], with ''[[La Fea M\u00e1s Bella]]'' translated as ''Ru\u017ena ljepotica'' (literally, \"The Ugly Beauty\"), a Mexican telenovela, but it failed. Some of [[Croatian language|Croatian]] dubbing is also broadcast in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].\n\n=====Estonia=====\nIn [[Estonia]] in cinemas, only children's animated films are dubbed and live-action films are shown in the original English and Russian languages with subtitles at cinemas. Subtitles are usually presented in both Estonian and [[Russian language]]s. Cartoons and animated series voiced by dubbing or [[Voice-over|voiceover]] and live-action films and television series only with Estonian subtitles also but with English and Russian Dub Languages. Animated films are commonly shown in both the originals and Russian languages and dubbed into Estonian (or Russian in many cinemas). Most Estonian-language television channels use subtitles English and Russian Audio for foreign-language films and TV channels. However, Russian language channels tend to use dubbing more often, especially for Russian channels broadcast from [[Russia]] (as opposed to Russian channels broadcast from Estonia).\n\n=====Greece=====\nIn [[Greece]], most cartoon films have dubs. Usually when a movie has a Greek dub the dub is shown in cinemas but subtitled versions are shown as well. Foreign TV shows for adults are shown in their original versions with subtitles, most cartoons, for example, ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and ''[[The Jetsons]]'' were always dubbed, while ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[American Dad!]]'' are always subtitled and contain the original English dialogue, since they are mostly for adults rather than children, (even though the movie ''[[Space Jam]]'' was subtitled instead of being dubbed, since also this is suitable for children). Also some Japanese anime series are dubbed in Greek (such as Pok\u00e9mon, Pichi Pichi Pitch, Sailor Moon etc.) The only television programs dubbed in Greek includes [[Mexico|Mexican]] TV series (like ''[[Rub\u00ed (2004 telenovela)|Rub\u00ed]]'' and ''[[La usurpadora (1998 TV series)|La usurpadora]]'') and teen series (like ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' and ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''). However, when [[Skai TV]] was re-launched in April 2006, the network opted for dubbing almost all foreign shows in Greek, unlike other Greek channels which had always broadcast most of the programs in their original language with subtitles.\n\n=====Ireland=====\nIreland usually receives the same film versions as the UK. However some films have been dubbed into [[Irish language|Irish]] by [[TG4]], including the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bY4JK5PR4MAC&lpg=PA275&ots=D6dkX7Up-y&dq=Harry%20Potter%20TG4&pg=PA275#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Writing and Translating for Children''], Elena Di Giovanni, Chiara Elefante, Roberta Pederzoli, Peter Lang, 2010, page 259</ref>\n\n=====Netherlands=====\nIn the [[Netherlands]], for the most part, Dutch versions are only made for children's and family films. Animated movies are shown in theaters with Dutch dubbing, but usually those cinemas with more screening rooms also provide the original subtitled version, such as movies like ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''.\n\n=====North Macedonia=====\n[[North Macedonia]] dubbed many cartoons in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], but they also air some [[Serbian language|Serbian]] dubs. Children's programs are airing dubbed (in Macedonian or Serbian), while every other program is subtitled (in Macedonian). They use [[Serbian language|Serbian]] dubs for [[Disney]] movies, because there are no [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] [[Disney]] dubs.\n\n=====Poland=====\n{{essay|section|date=October 2016}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nIn [[Poland]], cinema releases for general audiences are almost exclusively subtitled, with the exception of children's movies, and television screenings of movies, as well as made-for-TV shows. These are usually shown with voice-over, where a voice talent reads a translation over the original soundtrack. This method, called \"juxtareading,\" is similar to the so-called [[Gavrilov translation]] in Russia, with one difference\u2014all dialogues are voiced by one off-screen reader ({{lang-pl|lektor}}), preferably with a deep and neutral voice which does not interfere with the pitch of voice of the original speakers in the background. To some extent, it resembles live translation. Certain highly qualified voice talents are traditionally assigned to particular kinds of production, such as action or drama. Standard dubbing is not widely popular with most audiences, with the exception of cartoons and children's shows, which are dubbed also for TV releases.\n\nIt is claimed that, until around 1951, there were no revoiced foreign movies available in Poland. Instead, they were exclusively subtitled in Polish.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das kulturelle Leben der Deutschen in Niederschlesien unter polnischer Verwaltung. 1947-1958|first=Bernhard|last=Grund|publisher=Bundesministerium f\u00fcr gesamtdeutsche Fragen|place=Bonn und Berlin|date=1967|series=Bonner Berichte aus Mittel- und Ostdeutschland|page=119}}</ref>\n\nPoland's dubbing traditions began between the two world wars. In 1931, among the first movies dubbed into Polish were ''[[Dangerous Curves (1929 film)|Dangerous Curves]]'' (1929), ''[[The Dance of Life]]'' (1929), ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' (1930), and ''[[Darling of the Gods]]'' (1930). In 1949, the first dubbing studio opened in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. The first film dubbed that year was ''Russkiy Vopros'' (filmed 1948).\n\nPolish dubbing in the first post-war years suffered from poor synchronisation. Polish dialogues were not always audible and the cinema equipment of that time often made films sound less clear than they were. In the 1950s, Polish publicists discussed the quality of Polish versions of foreign movies.\n\nThe number of dubbed movies and the quality improved. Polish dubbing had a golden age between the 1960s and the 1980s. Approximately a third of foreign movies screened in cinemas were dubbed. The \"Polish dubbing school\" was known for its high quality. In that time, Poland had some of the best dubbing in the world. The person who initiated high-quality dubbing versions was director Zofia Dybowska-Aleksandrowicz. In that time, dubbing in Poland was very popular. Polish television dubbed popular films and TV series such as ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]''; ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', ''[[Forsyte Saga]]'', ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', ''[[I, Claudius]]'', ''[[I'll Take Manhattan (miniseries)|I'll Take Manhattan]]'', and ''[[Peter the Great (TV series)|Peter the Great]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s, due to budget cuts, state-run TV saved on tapes by voicing films over live during transmission.\n\nOverall, during 1948\u20131998, almost 1,000 films were dubbed in Polish. In the 1990s, dubbing films and TV series continued, although often also for one emission only.\n\nIn 1995, [[Canal+]] was launched in Poland. In its first years, it dubbed 30% of its schedule dubbing popular films and TV series, one of the best-known and popular dubbings was that of ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'', but this proved unsuccessful.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151222233455/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119215016517556740 On Polish TV, Desperate Wives Sound Like Guys], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 12 October 2007</ref> It stopped dubbing films in 1999, although many people supported the idea of dubbing and bought the access only for dubbing versions of foreign productions. In the 1990s, dubbing was done by the television channel known as [[Wizja Jeden]]. They mainly dubbed [[BBC]] productions such as ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]''. Wizja Jeden was closed in 2001. In the same year, TVP stopped dubbing the TV series ''[[Frasier]]'', although that dubbing was very popular.\n\nCurrently, dubbing of films and TV series for teenagers is made by Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. One of the major breakthroughs in dubbing was the Polish release of ''Shrek'', which contained many references to local culture and Polish humour. Since then, people seem to have grown to like dubbed versions more, and pay more attention to the dubbing actors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} However, this seems to be the case only with animated films, as live-action dubbing is still considered a bad practice. In the case of [[DVD|DVD releases]], most discs contain both the original soundtrack and subtitles, and either voice over or dubbed Polish track. The dubbed version is, in most cases, the one from the theater release, while voice-over is provided for movies that were only subtitled in theaters.\n\nSince theatrical release of ''The Avengers'' in May 2012, Walt Disney Company Polska dubs all films for cinema releases. Also in 2012, [[United International Pictures]] Polska dubbed ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', while Forum Film Polska \u2013 former distributor of Disney's films \u2013 decided to dub ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', along with its [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|two]] [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|sequels]]. However, when a dub is produced but the film's target audience is not exclusively children, both dubbed and subtitled versions are usually available in movie theaters. The dubbed versions are more commonly shown in morning and early afternoon hours, with the subtitled version dominating in the evening. Both can be available in parallel at similar hours in multiplexes.\n\n=====Portugal=====\nIn [[Portugal]], dubbing was banned under a 1948 law as a way of protecting the domestic film industry and reduce the access to culture as most of the population was illiterate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amordeperdicao.pt/especiais_solo.asp?artigoid=206 |title=amor de perdi\u00e7\u00e3o - especiais |date=21 January 2005 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050121055806/http://www.amordeperdicao.pt/especiais_solo.asp?artigoid=206 |archivedate=21 January 2005  }}</ref> Until 1994, animated movies, as well as other TV series for children shown in Portugal, have imported [[Brazilian Portuguese]] dubs due to the lack of interest from Portuguese companies in the dubbing industry. This lack of interest was justified, since there were already quality dubbed copies of shows and movies in Portuguese made by [[Brazil]]ians. ''[[The Lion King]]'' was the first feature film to be dubbed in [[European Portuguese]] rather than strictly Brazilian Portuguese. Currently, all movies for children are dubbed in European Portuguese. Subtitles are preferred in Portugal,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jornaleconomico.sapo.pt/noticias/polemica-dobragem-serie-einstein-gera-criticas-axn-118969|title=Pol\u00e9mica: dobragem da s\u00e9rie 'Einstein' gera cr\u00edticas ao AXN|access-date=29 March 2017|date=3 February 2017|work=O Jornal Econ\u00f3mico|quote=Ao contr\u00e1rio de alguns mercados como o espanhol e brasileiro, o p\u00fablico portugu\u00eas n\u00e3o se mostra recetivo a esta op\u00e7\u00e3o.|language=portuguese}}</ref> used in every foreign-language [[Documentary film|documentary]], TV series and film. The exception to this preference is when children are the target audience.\n\nWhile on TV, children's shows and movies are always dubbed, in cinemas, films with a clear juvenile target can be found in two versions, one dubbed (identified by the letters V.P. for ''vers\u00e3o portuguesa'' - \"Portuguese version\") and another subtitled version (V.O. for ''vers\u00e3o original'' - \"original version\"). This duality applies only to juvenile films. Others use subtitles only. While the quality of these dubs is recognised (some have already received international recognition and prizes), original versions with subtitles are usually preferred by the adults (''[[Bee Movie]]'', for example). Dubbing cartoons aimed at adults (such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' or ''[[South Park]]'') is less common. When ''The Simpsons Movie'' debuted in Portugal, most cinemas showed both versions (V.O. and V.P.), but in some small cities, cinemas decided to offer only the Portuguese version, a decision that led to public protest. Presently, [[live action]] series and movies are always shown in their original language format with Portuguese subtitles. Television programs for young children (such as ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[Big Bad Beetleborgs]]'', etc.) are dubbed into European Portuguese. Some video games aimed at adults (such as [[God of War III]], [[Halo 3]], [[Assassin's Creed III]] and [[inFamous 2]]) are dubbed in European Portuguese, although there they provide an option to select the original language.\n\n=====Romania=====\n<!-- Please do not change this section to Hungarian, because graph QA11 of the Eurobarometer lists the number 62 next to RO (Romania). Hungary is HU.-->\nIn [[Romania]], virtually all programmes intended for children are dubbed in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], including cartoons, live-action movies and TV series on [[Disney Channel Romania|Disney Channel]], [[Cartoon Network (Europe)|Cartoon Network]], [[Minimax tv|Minimax]], and [[Nickelodeon]], as well as those shown on general television networks, children-focused series (such as ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[The New Addams Family]]'', ''[[The Planet's Funniest Animals]]'') or movies screened on children's television. Animated movies are shown in theaters with Romanian dubbing. However, those cinemas with more screening rooms usually also provide the original subtitled version. Such was the case for movies like ''[[Babe (movie)|Babe]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Cars (movie)|Cars]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''. Other foreign TV shows and movies are shown in the original language with Romanian subtitles. Subtitles are usually preferred in the Romanian market. According to \"Special Eurobarometer 243\" (graph QA11.8) of the [[European Commission]] (research carried out in November and December 2005), 62% of Romanians prefer to watch foreign films and programmes with subtitles (rather than dubbed), 22% prefer dubbing, and 16% declined to answer.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\">[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 243] of the European Commission with the title \"Europeans and their Languages\", published in February 2006 with research carried out in November and December 2005. Barely 2% of Romanians consider watching original-language versions most effective into learning a new language (Table QA7b).</ref> This is led by the assumption that watching movies in their original versions is very useful for learning foreign languages. However, according to the same Eurobarometer, virtually no Romanian found this method\u2014watching movies in their original version\u2014to be the most efficient way to learn foreign languages, compared to 53 percent who preferred language lessons at school.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\" />\n\nIn Romania, foreign language television programs and films are generally subtitled rather than dubbed.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=csMetRFKXmgC&lpg=PT61&dq=romania%20dubbing%20tv&pg=PT61#v=onepage&q=romania%20dubbing%20tv&f=true ''Dracula is Dead: How Romanians Survived Communism, Ended It, and Emerged Since 1989 as the New Italy''], Sheilah Kast, Jim Rosapepe, 2009, page 49</ref> This includes programs in non-Western languages, such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Korean language|Korean]] or [[Hindi language|Hindi]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aXutBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA91&dq=romania+subtitles+television&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiI-s2aysvOAhXrAMAKHXs4Ca4Q6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&q=romania%20subtitles%20television&f=true ''The Global Impact of South Korean Popular Culture: Hallyu Unbound''], Valentina Marinescu, Lexington Books, 2014, page 91</ref>\n\n=====Serbia=====\n[[Serbian language]] dubs are made mainly for [[Serbia]], but they broadcast in [[Montenegro]] and [[Bosnia & Herzegovina]], too. Children's animated and some live-action movies and TV series are dubbed into Serbian, while live-action films and TV series for adults are always airing subtitled, because in this region people prefer subtitling for live-action formats. [[Turkey|Turkish]] soap opera ''[[Lale Devri]]'' started airing dubbed in 2011, on [[RTV Pink]], but because of bad reception, dub failed and rest of TV series was aired subtitled. ''[[Married... with Children]]'' was dubbed, too.\n\nThe dubbing of cartoon series in former [[Yugoslavia]] during the 1980s had a twist of its own: famous [[Serbia]]n actors, such as [[Nikola Simi\u0107 (actor)|Nikola Simi\u0107]], [[Mi\u0107a Tati\u0107]], [[Nada Blam]] and others provided the voices for characters of [[Disney]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and other companies, frequently using region-specific phrases and sentences and, thus, adding a dose of local humor to the translation of the original lines. These phrases became immensely popular and are still being used for [[tongue-in-cheek]] comments in specific situations. These dubs are today considered cult dubs. The only dub made after 1980s and 1990s ones that's considered cult is ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' dub, made by [[B92]] in period 2002\u20132017, because of a great popularity and memorable translation with local humor phrases, such as 1980s dubs translation.\n\nSome Serbian dubs are also broadcast in [[North Macedonia]], while cult dubs made during [[Yugoslavia]] were aired all over the country (today's [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[Slovenia]], [[North Macedonia]] and [[Serbia]]).\n\n=====Slovenia=====\nIn [[Slovenia]], all foreign films and television programs are subtitled with the exception of children's movies and TV shows (both animated or live-action). While dubbed versions are always shown in cinemas and later on TV channels, cinemas will sometimes play subtitled versions of children's movies as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n=====United Kingdom=====\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the vast majority of foreign language films are subtitled, although mostly animated films are dubbed in English.  These usually originate from [[North America]], as opposed to being dubbed locally. Foreign language serials shown on BBC Four are subtitled into English (although open subtitles are dropped during dialogues with English language segments already).  There have, however, been notable examples of films and TV programmes successfully dubbed in the UK, such as the Japanese ''[[Monkey (TV series)|Monkey]]'' and French ''[[The Magic Roundabout|Magic Roundabout]]'' series.  When airing films on television, channels in the UK often choose subtitling over dubbing, even if a dubbing in English exists. It is also a fairly common practice for animation aimed at [[Preschool education|preschool]] children to be re-dubbed with British voice actors replacing the original voices, such as Spin Master Entertainment's [[PAW Patrol]] series, although this is not done with shows aimed at older audiences.  The off-screen narrated portions of some programmes and reality shows that originate from North America are also redone with British English voices.  \n\nSome animated films and TV programmes are also dubbed into [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\n[[Hinterland (TV series)|Hinterland]] displays a not so common example of a bilingual production. Each scene is filmed twice, in the English and Welsh languages, apart from a few scenes where Welsh with subtitles is used for the English version.<ref>{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jul/30/hinterland-tv-noir-wales |title=Hinterland \u2013 the TV noir so good they made it twice |first=Stephen |last=Moss |date=30 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=[[London]] |access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Nordic countries=====\nIn the [[Nordic countries]], dubbing is used only in animated features (except [[adult animated]] features) and other films for younger audiences. Some cinemas in the major cities may also screen the original version, usually as the last showing of the day, or in a smaller auditorium in a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]].\n\nIn television programs with off-screen narration, both the original audio and on-screen voices are usually subtitled in their native languages.\n\nThe Nordic countries are often treated as a common market issuing [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases with original audio and user choosable subtitle options in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. The covers often have text in all four languages as well, but are sometimes unique for each country. Some releases may include other European language audio and/or subtitles (i.e. German, Greek, Hungarian or Italian). Children's films typically have Nordic audio tracks in all four languages, as well as original audio in most cases.\n\nIn [[Finland]], the dubbed version from [[Sweden]] may also be available at certain cinemas for children of the 5% Swedish-speaking minority, but only in cities or towns with a significant percentage of Swedish speakers. Most [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases usually only have the original audio, except for children's films, which have both Finnish and Swedish language tracks, in addition to the original audio and subtitles in both languages.\n\nIn Finnish movie theaters, films for adult audiences have both Finnish and Swedish subtitles, the Finnish printed in basic font and the Swedish printed below the Finnish in a cursive font. In the early ages of television, foreign TV shows and movies were voiced by narrator in Finland. Later, subtitles became a practice on Finnish television. Dubbing of films other than children's films is unpopular in Finland, as in many other countries. A good example is ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''. While the original version was well-received, the Finnish-dubbed version received poor reviews, with some critics even calling it a disaster.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} On the other hand, many dubs of [[Disney]] animated features have been well-received, both critically and by the public.\n\nIn [[Iceland]], the dubbed version of film and TV is usually [[Danish language|Danish]] with some translated into [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. [[LazyTown]], an Icelandic TV show originally broadcast in English, was dubbed into Icelandic, amongst thirty-two other languages, and it remains the TV show to have been dubbed into the most languages.\n\n====General films and programming====\nIn the [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] language-speaking markets of [[Europe]], almost all foreign films and television shows are dubbed (the exception being the majority of theatrical releases of adult-audience movies in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]] and [[Turkey]] and high-profile videos in Russia). There are few opportunities to watch foreign movies in their original versions. In [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], even in the largest cities, there are few cinemas that screen original versions with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], or without any translation. However, digital [[pay-TV]] programming is often available in the original language, including the latest movies. Prior to the rise of DVDs, which in these countries are mostly issued with multi-language audio tracks, original-language films (those in languages other than the country's official language) were rare, whether in theaters, on TV, or on home video, and subtitled versions were considered a product for small [[niche market]]s such as intellectual or [[art film]]s.\n\n\n\n\n=====France=====\nIn [[France]], movies and TV series are, except purely arthouse films, usually released in the dubbed French-language version. The original-language version of the film with French subtitles is released in designated theaters which show only subtitled versions or both versions are shown at different times or split screenings between both versions. However, dubbing is the norm and subtitling is only for niche audience and movies with subtitles are usually very small arthouse films with very limited commercial prospects for pay and free TV airings and also home entertainment (VOD, DVD). Dubbing in the French Language is thus absolutely essential for any sale to be made.\n\nSince the digitalization of over-the-air television broadcasters, both versions have been offered to the customer simultaneously.  By default, foreign films and TV programmes shown on television are dubbed into French on a channel's main audio feed. However, with the advent of digital television, viewers can access the original language feed for some programmes, as well as matching subtitles.  In addition, the TV network ARTE has a French-language track on its main audio feed as well as a German-language track.  \n \nMost movies are released nationwide in dubbed version and subtitled versions where available with the exception of very limited often micro-budget arthouse productions that do stem come from the \"hollywood movie production\" machine which are exclusively arthouse films and not dubbed at the time of their theatrical release.\n\nTheaters showing these kind of movies or also showing commercial films in the original-language version with French subtitles are very rare outside of the big cities and most of them are located in [[Paris]] which has the most \"cinephile\" cinemas in France. Often these \"niche\" films are only released in [[Paris]] region.\n\nA theater showing subtitled versions of original language movies are typically well known for this and will advertise this also on the poster advising moviegoers that the film is shown in an original-language version (usually abbreviated VO [''version originale''] or VOST [''version originale sous-titr\u00e9e'']), as opposed to VF [''version fran\u00e7aise''], the latter then becoming what is known and used also in the neighboring countries like Belgium or Switzerland, as the \"FRENCH LANGUAGE VERSION\" of the film.)\n\nBecause the alterations made to the original film are so profound, making it no longer viewable or understandable for audiences that speak the language the film was originally shot in, the final dubbed version is called the \"French-language version\", as opposed to the use of subtitles which leave the film in its original state.\nThe choice to dub or not at the time of theatrical release is a decision made by the distributor releasing the film based upon their recoupment strategy for the film and their prognosis of the commercial prospects. Given the fact that a dub is needed for home entertainment and TV sales, only very small arthouse films are never dubbed.\nOnly a very small percentage (according to the official institute CNC in France only 16.4% of all ticket-sales were for movies watched in the original-language version with subtitles) and this is counting Blockbusters and others shown in their original-language version with subtitles and the small number of films that are never dubbed.\nVoice actors that have dubbed for celebrities in the European French language can be viewed here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Macy]]<br />[[Joe Pantoliano]] ||\n|}\n\n=====Italy=====\nIn [[Italy]], dubbing is systematic, with a tradition going back to the 1930s in [[Rome]], [[Milan]], [[Florence]] and [[Turin]]. In [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] fascist Italy, release of movies in foreign languages was banned for political reasons. Rome is the principal base of the dubbing industry, where major productions such as movies, drama, documentaries and some cartoons are dubbed. However, dubbing in Milan is mostly of cartoons and some minor productions. Practically every foreign film (mostly American ones) of every genre, for children or adults, as well as TV shows, are dubbed into Italian. In big cities, original-version movies can also be seen in some theaters but it is not so common. Subtitles may be available on [[Late night television|late-night programs]] on mainstream TV channels, and on pay-TV all movies are available in the original language with Italian subtitles, many shows featuring their original [[soundtrack]]s.\n\nEarly in their careers, actors such as [[Alberto Sordi]] or [[Nino Manfredi]] worked extensively as dubbing actors. At one point, common practice in Italian cinema was to shoot scenes [[MOS (filmmaking)|MOS]] (motor only sync or motor only shot) and dub the dialogue in post-production. A notable example of this practice is ''[[The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly]]'', in which all actors had to dub in their own voices.\n\nVideo games are generally either dubbed into Italian (for instance [[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]] saga, [[Halo (series)|Halo]] or [[Harry Potter (video games)|Harry Potter]] series etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Italian language.\n\nA list of the voice actors that have dubbed for celebrities in Italian can be enlisted here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Some dubbing actors have achieved popularity for their voices, such as [[Constantino Romero]] (who dubs [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Darth Vader]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s [[The Terminator|Terminator]], among others) and [[\u00d3scar Mu\u00f1oz (filmmaking)|\u00d3scar Mu\u00f1oz]] (the official European Spanish dub-over voice artist for [[Elijah Wood]] and [[Hayden Christensen]]). Currently, with the spread of [[digital terrestrial television]], viewers can choose between the original and the dubbed soundtracks for most movies and television.\n\nIn some communities such as [[Catalonia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], some foreign programs are also dubbed into their own languages, different from European Spanish. Films from \nthe Spanish-speaking America shown in these communities are shown in their original language, while strong regional accents (from the Spanish-speaking America or from Spain) may be subtitled in news and documentaries.\n\n=====Germany, Austria and Switzerland=====\nThe [[German language|Germanophone]] dubbing market is the largest in Europe. Germany has the most foreign-movie-dubbing studios per capita and per given area in the world and according to the German newspaper [[Die Welt]] 52% of all voice actors currently work in the German dubbing industry. In Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], practically all films, shows, television series and foreign [[soap opera]]s are shown in dubbed versions created for the German market. However, in some of Switzerland's towns and cities (particularly along the language-borders), subtitled versions are common. Dubbing films is a traditional and common practice in German-speaking Europe, since subtitles are not accepted and used as much as in other European countries. According to a European study, Austria is the country with the highest rejection rate (more than 70 percent) of subtitles, followed by Italy, Spain and Germany.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\nIn German-speaking markets, [[PC game|computer]] and video games feature German text menus and are dubbed into the German language if speaking parts exist.\n\nIn recent years, Swiss and Austrian television stations have been showing increasing numbers of movies, series and TV-programmes in \"dual sound,\" which means the viewer can choose between the original language (e.g. English) and the language of the channel (German, French or Italian, according to the location).\n\nAlthough German-speaking [[voice actor]]s play only a secondary role, they are still notable for providing familiar voices to well-known actors. Famous foreign actors are known and recognised for their [[German language|German]] voice, and the German audience is used to them, so dubbing is also a matter of authenticity. However, in larger cities, there are theaters where movies can be seen in their original versions, as [[English language|English]] has become somewhat more popular among young educated viewers. On German [[mainstream]] television, films are never broadcast with subtitles, but pay-per-view programming is often available in the original language. Subtitled niche and [[art film]]s are sometimes aired on smaller networks.\n\nGerman-dubbed versions sometimes diverge greatly from the original, especially in adding humorous elements absent from the original. In extreme cases, such as ''[[The Persuaders!]]'', the German-dubbed version was more successful than the English original. Often, translation adds [[sexually explicit]] gags the U.S. versions might not be allowed to use. For example, in ''[[Bewitched (2005 film)|Bewitched]]'', the translators changed ''\"The [[Door hanger|Do Not Disturb sign]] will hang on the door tonight\"'' to ''\"The only hanging thing tonight will be the Do Not Disturb sign\"''.\n\nSome movies dubbed in Austria diverge from the German Standard version in addressing other people but only when the movies are dubbed into certain Austrian dialect versions. (Mr. and Mrs. are translated into Herr and Frau which is usually not translated in order to be in lip-sync).\nSometimes even English pronounced first names are translated and are pronounced into the correct German equivalent (English name \"Bert\" became Southern German pronounced name \"Bertl\" which is an abbreviation for any name either beginning or even ending with \"bert\", e.g. \"Berthold\" or \"Albert\".)\n\nSome movies dubbed before [[German reunification|reunification]] exist in different versions for the [[East Germany|east]] and the [[West Germany|west]]. They use different translations, and often differ in the style of dubbing.\n\nSome of the well-known German dubbing voice artists are listed below.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Czech dubbing was also extensively used in the broadcast of Slovak television channels, but since 2008 Slovak language laws require any newer shows (understood as the first television broadcast in Slovakia) to be provided with Slovak localisation (dubbing or subtitles); since then, television broadcasts of films, TV series and cartoons have been dubbed into Slovak.\n\n=====Hungary=====\n<!-- Please do not change this section to Romanian because the sources in this section are directly related to Hungary.-->\nIn [[Hungary]], dubbing is almost universally common. Almost every foreign movie or TV show released in Hungary is dubbed into Hungarian.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://matadornetwork.com/abroad/9-culture-shocks-americans-will-hungary/ |title=9 culture shocks Americans will have in Hungary}}</ref> The history of dubbing dates back to the 1950s, when the country was still under communist rule.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.masterfilm.hu/services |title=Masterfilm :: Services}}</ref> One of the most iconic Hungarian dubs was of the American cartoon ''[[The Flintstones]]'', with a local translation by [[J\u00f3zsef Romh\u00e1nyi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sherlockian-sherlock.com/the-dubbed-versions-of-sherlock-holmes.php |title=Dubbed versions Sherlock Holmes, dubbing, hungarian voices}}</ref> The Internetes Szinkron Adatb\u00e1zis (ISzDB) is the largest Hungarian database for film dubs, with information for many live action and animated films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iszdb.hu |title=ISzDb - Internetes Szinkron Adatb\u00e1zis}}</ref> On page 59 of the Eurobarometer, 84% of Hungarians said that they prefer dubbing over subtitles.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\" />\n\nIn the [[Socialism|socialist]] era, every film was dubbed with professional and mostly popular actors. Care was taken to make sure the same voice actor would lend his voice to the same original actor. In the early 1990s, as cinemas tried to keep up with showing newly released films, subtitling became dominant in the cinema. This, in turn, forced TV channels to make their own cheap versions of dubbed soundtracks for the movies they presented, resulting in a constant degrading of dubbing quality. Once this became customary, cinema distributors resumed the habit of dubbing for popular productions, presenting them in a below-average quality. However, every feature is presented with the original soundtrack in at least one cinema in large towns and cities.\n\nHowever, in Hungary, most documentary films and series (for example, those on [[Discovery Channel]], [[National Geographic Channel]]) are made with [[Voice-over|voiceovers]]. Some old movies and series, or ones that provide non-translatable jokes and conversations (for example, the ''[[Mr. Bean]]'' television series), are shown only with subtitles.\n\nThere is a more recent problem arising from dubbing included on DVD releases. Many generations have grown up with an original (and, by current technological standards, outdated) soundtrack, which is either technologically (mono or bad quality stereo sound) or legally (expired soundtrack license) unsuitable for a DVD release. Many original features are released on DVD with a new soundtrack, which in some cases proves to be extremely unpopular, thus forcing DVD producers to include the original soundtrack. In some rare cases, the Hungarian soundtrack is left out altogether. This happens notably with Warner Home Video Hungary, which ignored the existence of Hungarian soundtracks completely, as they did not want to pay the licenses for the soundtracks to be included on their new DVD releases, which appear with improved picture quality, but very poor subtitling.\n\n=====Poland=====\n{{essay|section|date=October 2016}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nIn [[Poland]], cinema releases for general audiences are almost exclusively subtitled, with the exception of children's movies, and television screenings of movies, as well as made-for-TV shows. These are usually shown with voice-over, where a voice talent reads a translation over the original soundtrack. This method, called \"juxtareading,\" is similar to the so-called [[Gavrilov translation]] in Russia, with one difference\u2014all dialogues are voiced by one off-screen reader ({{lang-pl|lektor}}), preferably with a deep and neutral voice which does not interfere with the pitch of voice of the original speakers in the background. To some extent, it resembles live translation. Certain highly qualified voice talents are traditionally assigned to particular kinds of production, such as action or drama. Standard dubbing is not widely popular with most audiences, with the exception of cartoons and children's shows, which are dubbed also for TV releases.\n\nIt is claimed that, until around 1951, there were no revoiced foreign movies available in Poland. Instead, they were exclusively subtitled in Polish.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das kulturelle Leben der Deutschen in Niederschlesien unter polnischer Verwaltung. 1947-1958|first=Bernhard|last=Grund|publisher=Bundesministerium f\u00fcr gesamtdeutsche Fragen|place=Bonn und Berlin|date=1967|series=Bonner Berichte aus Mittel- und Ostdeutschland|page=119}}</ref>\n\nPoland's dubbing traditions began between the two world wars. In 1931, among the first movies dubbed into Polish were ''[[Dangerous Curves (1929 film)|Dangerous Curves]]'' (1929), ''[[The Dance of Life]]'' (1929), ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' (1930), and ''[[Darling of the Gods]]'' (1930). In 1949, the first dubbing studio opened in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. The first film dubbed that year was ''Russkiy Vopros'' (filmed 1948).\n\nPolish dubbing in the first post-war years suffered from poor synchronisation. Polish dialogues were not always audible and the cinema equipment of that time often made films sound less clear than they were. In the 1950s, Polish publicists discussed the quality of Polish versions of foreign movies.\n\nThe number of dubbed movies and the quality improved. Polish dubbing had a golden age between the 1960s and the 1980s. Approximately a third of foreign movies screened in cinemas were dubbed. The \"Polish dubbing school\" was known for its high quality. In that time, Poland had some of the best dubbing in the world. The person who initiated high-quality dubbing versions was director Zofia Dybowska-Aleksandrowicz. In that time, dubbing in Poland was very popular. Polish television dubbed popular films and TV series such as ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]''; ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', ''[[Forsyte Saga]]'', ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', ''[[I, Claudius]]'', ''[[I'll Take Manhattan (miniseries)|I'll Take Manhattan]]'', and ''[[Peter the Great (TV series)|Peter the Great]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s, due to budget cuts, state-run TV saved on tapes by voicing films over live during transmission.\n\nOverall, during 1948\u20131998, almost 1,000 films were dubbed in Polish. In the 1990s, dubbing films and TV series continued, although often also for one emission only.\n\nIn 1995, [[Canal+]] was launched in Poland. In its first years, it dubbed 30% of its schedule dubbing popular films and TV series, one of the best-known and popular dubbings was that of ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'', but this proved unsuccessful.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151222233455/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119215016517556740 On Polish TV, Desperate Wives Sound Like Guys], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 12 October 2007</ref> It stopped dubbing films in 1999, although many people supported the idea of dubbing and bought the access only for dubbing versions of foreign productions. In the 1990s, dubbing was done by the television channel known as [[Wizja Jeden]]. They mainly dubbed [[BBC]] productions such as ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]''. Wizja Jeden was closed in 2001. In the same year, TVP stopped dubbing the TV series ''[[Frasier]]'', although that dubbing was very popular.\n\nCurrently, dubbing of films and TV series for teenagers is made by Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. One of the major breakthroughs in dubbing was the Polish release of ''Shrek'', which contained many references to local culture and Polish humour. Since then, people seem to have grown to like dubbed versions more, and pay more attention to the dubbing actors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} However, this seems to be the case only with animated films, as live-action dubbing is still considered a bad practice. In the case of [[DVD|DVD releases]], most discs contain both the original soundtrack and subtitles, and either voice over or dubbed Polish track. The dubbed version is, in most cases, the one from the theater release, while voice-over is provided for movies that were only subtitled in theaters.\n\nSince theatrical release of ''The Avengers'' in May 2012, Walt Disney Company Polska dubs all films for cinema releases. Also in 2012, [[United International Pictures]] Polska dubbed ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', while Forum Film Polska \u2013 former distributor of Disney's films \u2013 decided to dub ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', along with its [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|two]] [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|sequels]]. However, when a dub is produced but the film's target audience is not exclusively children, both dubbed and subtitled versions are usually available in movie theaters. The dubbed versions are more commonly shown in morning and early afternoon hours, with the subtitled version dominating in the evening. Both can be available in parallel at similar hours in multiplexes.\n\n=====Russia=====\n[[Russia]]n television is generally dubbed, but in the cases using voice-over dub technique with only a couple of voice actors, with the original speech still audible underneath. In the [[Soviet Union]], most foreign movies to be officially released were dubbed. Voice-over dub was invented in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1980s when with the fall of the regime, many popular foreign movies, previously forbidden, or at least questionable under communist rule, started to flood in, in the form of low-quality home-copied videos. Being unofficial releases, they were dubbed in a very primitive way. For example, the translator spoke the text directly over the audio of a video being copied, using primitive equipment.\n\nThe quality of the resulting dub was very low, the translated phrases were off-sync, interfering with the original voices, background sounds leaked into the track, translation was inaccurate and, most importantly, all dub voices were made by a single person who usually lacked the intonation of the original, making comprehension of some scenes quite difficult. This method of translation exerted a strong influence on Russian pop culture. Voices of translators became recognizable for generations.\n\nIn modern Russia, the overdubbing technique is still used in many cases, although with vastly improved quality, and now with multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices. Video games are generally either dubbed into Russian (such as the ''Legend of Spyro'' trilogy, the ''Skylanders'' series, the ''Assassin's Creed'' saga, the ''Halo'' series, the ''Harry Potter'' series, etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Russian language.\n\nReleases of cinemas are almost always dubbed in the Russian language. On television series are shown as a dubbed translation and offscreen. Subtitles are not used at all.\n\n=====Ukraine=====\nIn [[Ukraine]], since 2006 cinema releases are almost always dubbed into Ukrainian with the overdubbing technique and multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices with a small percent of art-house/documentaries shown in the original language with Ukrainian subtitles. For television, TV channels usually release movies and TV-shows with a Ukrainian voiceover, although certain high-profile films and TV shows are dubbed rather than voice-overe'ed.\n\nIn the past Russian-language films, TV series, cartoons, animated series and TV programs were usually not dubbed but were shown with the original audio with Ukrainian subtitles. However, this practise has been slowly abandoned since the late 2010s: all children's films and cartoons regardless of the original language (including Russian) are always dubbed into Ukrainian; example of the first Russian cartoons dubbed into Ukrainian for the cinematic-release is [[The Snow Queen 2]] (2015), [[A Warrior's Tail]] (2015), Volki i Ovtsy: Be-e-e-zumnoe prevrashenie (2016), Ivan Tsarevich i Seryy Volk 3 (2016), Bremenskie razboyniki (2016), [[The Snow Queen 3: Fire and Ice|The Snow Queen 3: Fire and Ice (2017)]], [[Fantastic Journey to OZ]] (2017), Fixies: Top Secret (2017) etc.; the same trend is seen among Russian language feature films for adults, with the first such films dubbed into Ukrainian including [[Battle for Sevastopol|Battle for Sevastopol (2015)]], [[Hardcore Henry|Hardcore Henry (2016)]], [[The Duelist (2016 film)|The Duelist (2016)]].\n\n=====Latvia and Lithuania=====\nIn [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]], only children's movies get dubbed in the cinema, while many live-action movies for an older audience use voice-over. In recent years however, many cartoons have been dubbed into Latvian and Lithuanian for TV. But some other kids shows, like ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', use the voice-over.\n\n===Americas===\n====United States and English-speaking Canada====\nIn the United States and English-speaking Canada, [[live-action]] foreign films are usually shown in theaters with their original languages and English subtitles. It is because live-action dubbed movies rarely did well in United States box office since the 1980s. The 1982 United States theatrical release of Wolfgang Peterson's ''[[Das Boot]]'' was the last major release to go out in both original and English-dubbed versions, and the film's original version actually grossed much higher than the English-dubbed version.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/1999/08/editorial-life-isnt-beautiful-anymore-its-dubbed-82123/|title=EDITORIAL: Life Isn't Beautiful Anymore, it's Dubbed|last=Indiewire|date=23 August 1999|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html?gwh=5B7FDE5A22B394D810DA99A95EFCDECB&gwt=pay|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805152511/https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html?gwh=5B7FDE5A22B394D810DA99A95EFCDECB&gwt=pay|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 August 2018|title=Will Dubbing Fly in the U.S.?

The exceptions to this practice are either when an English dub has not been produced for the program (usually in the case of feature films) or when the program is being presented by a network that places importance on presenting it in its original format (as was the case when [[Turner Classic Movies]] aired several of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s works, which were presented both dubbed and subtitled). Most [[anime]] DVDs contain options for original Japanese, Japanese with subtitles, and English-dubbed, except for a handful of series that have been heavily edited or [[Americanized|Americanised]]. In addition, Disney has a policy that makes its directors undergo stages to perfect alignment of certain lip movements so the movie looks believable.\n\nIn addition, a small number of British films have been re-dubbed when released in the United States, due to the usage of dialects which Americans are not familiar with (for example, ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]'' and ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''). However, British children's shows (such as ''[[Bob the Builder]]'') are always re-dubbed with American voice actors in order to make the series more understandable for American children. Conversely, British programs shown in Canada are not re-dubbed.\n\nSome television shows shown in the US have Spanish dubs.  These are accessible though the SAP (secondary audio program) function of the television unit.\n\n====Spanish-speaking countries====\nFor Spanish-speaking countries, all foreign-language programs, films, cartoons and documentaries shown on free-to-air TV networks are dubbed into [[Standard Spanish]], while broadcasts on [[Cable television|cable]] and [[Satellite television|satellite]] pan-regional channels are either dubbed or subtitled. In theaters, children's movies and most blockbuster films are dubbed into Standard Spanish or [[Mexican Spanish]], and are sometimes further dubbed into regional dialects of Spanish where they are released.\n\n====Mexico====\nIn [[Mexico]], by law, films shown in theaters must be shown in their original version. Films in languages other than Spanish are usually subtitled. Only educational documentaries and movies rated for children, as well as some movies that are expected to have a wide audience (for example, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' or ''[[Marvel's The Avengers|The Avengers]]'') may be dubbed, but this is not compulsory, and some animated films are shown in theaters in both dubbed and subtitled versions (for instance, some [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] productions). Nonetheless, a recent trend in several cinemas is to offer the dubbed versions only, with a stark decrease in the showing of the original ones.\n\nDubbing must be made in Mexico by Mexican nationals or foreigners residing in Mexico.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/103.pdf |title=Ley Federal de Cinematograf\u00eda |language=Spanish |trans-title=Federal Law of Filmmaking |publisher=C\u00e1mara de Diputados |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=22 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722125937/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/103.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011  }}</ref> Still, several programs that are shown on pay TV are dubbed in other countries like [[Venezuela]], [[Chile]] or [[Colombia]].\n\nMost movies released on DVD feature [[Standard Spanish|neutral Spanish]] as a language option, and sometimes feature a specific dub for Mexican audiences (for example, ''Rio''). Foreign programs are dubbed on [[broadcast television systems|broadcast TV]], while on [[pay TV]] most shows and movies are subtitled. In a similar way to cinemas, in the last few years many channels on pay TV have begun to broadcast programs and films only in their dubbed version.\n\nDubbing became very popular in the 1990s with the rise in popularity of anime in Mexico. Some voice actors have become celebrities and are always identified with specific characters, such as [[Mario Casta\u00f1eda]] (who became popular by dubbing [[Goku]] in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'') or [[Humberto V\u00e9lez]] (who dubbed [[Homer Simpson]] in the first 15 seasons of ''[[The Simpsons]]'').\n\nThe popularity of pay TV has allowed people to view several series in their original language rather than dubbed. Dubbing has been criticised for the use of TV or movie stars as voice actors (such as [[Ricky Martin]] in Disney's ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'', or [[Eugenio Derbez]] in DreamWorks' ''Shrek''), or for the incorrect use of local popular culture that sometimes creates unintentional jokes or breaks the feeling of the original work (such as translating [[Sheldon Cooper]]'s \"Bazinga!\" to \"\u00a1Vacil\u00f3n!\").\n\nSeveral video games have been dubbed into neutral Spanish, rather than European Spanish, in Mexico (such as the ''Gears of War'' series, ''Halo 3'', ''Infamous 2'' and others). [[Sony]] recently announced that more games (such as ''God of War: Ascension'') will be dubbed into neutral Spanish.\n\n====Peru====\nIn [[Peru]], all foreign series, movies, and animated programming are shown dubbed in Latin American Spanish, with dubs imported from Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela on terrestrial and pay-television. Most movies intended for kids are being offered as dub-only movies, while most films aimed at older audiences are being offered dubbed and subtitled in Spanish. Also, at most theaters, kids films (on rare occasions) subtitled are commonly shown at nighttime. Most subtitled Pay-TV channels show both dubbed and subtitled version of every film they broadcast, being offered with a separate subtitle track and a second audio track in English. There is an increase of people preferring subtitle films and series rather than dubbed starting the late-2000s, as Peruvians viewers tend to get used to their original version.\n\nPeru used to do not produce their own dubs since dubbing studios never existed in that country until 2016, when the company \"Big Bang Films\" started to dub movies and series, however, since 2014 a group of dubbing actors created a group called \"Torre A Doblaje\", who is a group of actors who gives dubbing and locution service.\n\n====Brazil====\nIn [[Brazil]], foreign programs are invariably dubbed into [[Brazilian Portuguese]] on [[free to air TV]], with only a few exceptions. Films shown at cinemas are generally offered with both subtitled and dubbed versions, with dubbing frequently being the only choice for children's movies. Subtitling was primarily for adult audience movies until 2012. Since then, dubbed versions also became available for all ages. As a result, in recent years, more cinemas have opened in Brazil, attracting new audiences to the cinema who prefer dubbing. According to a [[Datafolha]] survey, 56% of Brazilian movie theaters' audience prefer to watch dubbed movies.<ref>http://revistaepoca.globo.com/cultura/noticia/2012/06/dublagem-venceu-legendas.html</ref> Most of the dubbing studios in Brazil is in the cities of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140319091221/http://ne10.uol.com.br/canal/cultura/noticia/2012/05/27/cresce-preferencia-por-filmes-dublados-nos-cinemas-brasileiros-344927.php Cresce prefer\u00eancia por filmes dublados nos cinemas brasileiros (in Portuguese)] Ne10, 27 May 2012. Retrieved 17 August 2012.</ref>\n\nThe first film to be dubbed in Brazil was the [[Disney]] animation ''\"[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]\"'' in 1938. By the end of the 1950s, most of the movies, TV series and cartoons on television in Brazil were shown in its original sound and subtitles. However, in 1962, a decree of President [[J\u00e2nio Quadros]] ruled that all foreign productions on television should be dubbed. This measure boosted the growth of dubbing in Brazil, and has led to several dubbing studios since then.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/cinema-e-tv/quando-surgiu-a-dublagem-no-brasil-e-no-mundo/ | title=Quando surgiu a dublagem no Brasil e no mundo?}}</ref> The biggest dubbing studio in Brazil was [[Herbert Richers]], headquartered in [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]] and closed in 2009, At its peak in the 80s and 90s, the Herbert Richers studios dubbed about 70% of the productions shown in Brazilian cinemas.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://super.abril.com.br/mundo-estranho/quem-e-herbert-richers/ |title = Quem \u00e9 Herbert Richers?}}</ref>\n\nIn the 90's, with Saint Seiya, Dragon Ball and other anime shows becoming popular in Brazilian TV's, the voice actors and the dubbing career gained a higher space in Brazilian culture. Actors like [[Hermes Baroli]] (Brazilian dubber of [[Pegasus Seiya]], in ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' and actors like [[Ashton Kutcher]]), [[Marco Ribeiro]] (Brazilian dubber of many actors like [[Tom Hanks]], [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]], and [[Yusuke Urameshi]] from the anime ''[[Yu Yu Hakusho]]'') and [[Wendel Bezerra]] (Brazilian dubber of [[Goku]] in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' and [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] in ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'') are recognised for their most notable roles.\n\nPay TV commonly offers both dubbed and subtitled movies, with statistics showing that dubbed versions are becoming predominant.<ref>[http://oglobo.globo.com/revista-da-tv/dublagem-em-canais-de-tv-paga-provoca-polemica-3262532 Dublagem em canais de TV paga provoca pol\u00eamica (in Portuguese)] O Globo, 20 November 2011. Retrieved 17 August 2012.</ref> Most [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases usually feature Portuguese, Spanish, and the original audio along with subtitles in native languages. Most video games are dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese rather than having European Portuguese dubs alone. Games such as ''[[Halo 3]]'', ''[[God of War: Ascension]]'', ''[[inFamous 2]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'', ''[[Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and others are dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese. This is because despite the dropping of the dubbing law in Portugal in 1994, most companies in that country use the Brazilian Portuguese because of traditional usage during the days of the dubbing rule, along with these dubbings being more marketable than European Portuguese.\n\nA list that showcases Brazilian Portuguese voice artists that dub for actors and actresses are displayed here. However, there can also be different official dub artists for certain regions within Brazil. \n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n! Brazilian Portuguese dubbing artists !!

They speak with a mixed accent, they pronounce /\u025b\u0303/ with a Parisian accent, but they pronounce \"\u00e2\" and \"\u00ea\" with a Quebec accent: ''gr\u00e2ce'' [\u0261\u0281\u0251\u02d0s] and ''\u00eatre'' [\u025b\u02d0t\u0281\u0325]. Occasionally, the dubbing of a series or a movie, such as ''The Simpsons'', is made using the more widely spoken ''[[joual]]'' variety of Quebec French. Dubbing has the advantage of making children's films and TV series more comprehensible to younger audiences. However, many [[bilingual]] Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois prefer subtitling, since they would understand some or all of the original audio. In addition, all films are shown in English, as well in certain theaters (especially in major cities and English-speaking areas such as the [[West Island]]), and some theatres, such as the Scotiabank Cinema [[Montreal]], show only movies in English. Most American television series are only available in English on [[DVD]], or on English-language channels, but some of the more popular ones have French dubs shown on mainstream networks, and are released in French on DVD as well, sometimes separately from an English-only version.\n\nFormerly, all French-language dubbed films in Quebec were imported from France and some still are. Such a practice was criticised by former politician [[Mario Dumont]] after he took his children to see the [[Standard French|Parisian French]] dub of ''Shrek the Third'', which Dumont found incomprehensible.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/quebec-pressing-hollywood-to-justify-lack-of-movie-dubbing/article1352554/ Quebec pressing Hollywood to justify lack of movie dubbing], The Canadian Press, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 26 May 2008</ref> After his complaints and a proposed bill, ''[[Bee Movie]]'', the film from [[DreamWorks Animation]], was dubbed in Quebec, making it the studio's first animated film to have a Quebec French dub, as all DreamWorks Animation films had previously been dubbed in France.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dr\u00f4le d'abeille (v.o.a) Bee Movie |url=http://doublage.qc.ca/showMovie.php?id=1981 |work=Doublage.qc.ca |publisher=idgrafix |accessdate=30 July 2012 |author=Doublage.qc.ca |language=French}}</ref> In terms of Disney, the first Disney animated film to be dubbed in Quebec was ''Oliver and Company.'' The Disney Renaissance films were also dubbed in Quebec except for ''The Rescuers Down Under'', ''Beauty and the Beast'', and ''The Lion King''.\n\nIn addition, because Canadian viewers usually find Quebec French more comprehensible than other dialects of the language, some older film series that had the French-language versions of previous installments dubbed in France have had later ones dubbed in Quebec, often creating inconsistencies within the French version of the series' canon. [[Lucasfilm]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' series are examples. Both series had films released in the 1970s and 1980s, with no Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French dubbed versions; instead, the Parisian French versions, with altered character and object names and terms, were distributed in the province. However, later films in both series released 1999 and later were dubbed in Quebec, using different voice actors and \"reversing\" name changes made in France's dubbings due to the change in studio.\n\n===Asia===\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2013}}\n\n====China====\nChina has a long tradition of dubbing foreign films into [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], starting in the 1930s. While during the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] era Western motion pictures may have been imported and dubbed into Chinese, since 1950 [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet movies]], dubbed primarily in Shanghai, became the main import.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|1987|p=40}}</ref> Beginning in the late 1970s, in addition to films, popular TV series from the United States, Japan, Brazil, and Mexico were also dubbed. The [[Shanghai]] Film Dubbing Studio has been the most well-known studio in the film dubbing industry in China. In order to generate high-quality products, they divide each film into short segments, each one lasting only a few minutes, and then work on the segments one-by-one. In addition to the correct meaning in translation, they make tremendous effort to match the lips of the actors to the dialogue. As a result, the dubbing in these films generally is not readily detected. The cast of dubbers is acknowledged at the end of a dubbed film. Several dubbing actors and actresses of the Shanghai Film Dubbing Studio have become well-known celebrities, such as Qiu Yuefeng, Bi Ke, Li Zi, and Liu Guangning. In recent years, however, especially in the larger cities on the east and south coasts, it has become increasingly common for movie theaters to show subtitled versions with the original soundtracks intact.\n\nMotion pictures are also dubbed into the languages of some of China's [[Autonomous administrative divisions of China|autonomous regions]]. Notably, the Translation Department of the [[Tibetan Autonomous Region]] Movie Company (\u897f\u85cf\u81ea\u6cbb\u533a\u7535\u5f71\u516c\u53f8\u8bd1\u5236\u79d1)<ref name=humes20131122>[http://www.bruce-humes.com/?p=9736 Confucius the Movie: China Flop Dubbed at the State\u2019s Expense for Tibetan Movie-goers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130085415/http://www.bruce-humes.com/?p=9736 |date=30 November 2013 }}, 22 November 2013</ref> has been dubbing movies into the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]] since the 1960s. In the early decades, it would dub 25 to 30 movies each year, the number rising to 60-75 by the early 2010s.<ref name=humes20131122/><ref>[http://www.china.org.cn/china/Off_the_Wire/2013-02/24/content_28045511.htm China Focus: Dubbed movies spice up life for Tibetans], Xinhua News Agency, 24 February 2013.</ref>\nMotion pictures are dubbed for China's [[Mongols in China|Mongol-]] and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur-speaking]] markets as well.<ref>{{citation\n|first=Paul |last=Clark|publisher=CUP Archive |year=1987|isbn=0521326389\n|title=Chinese Cinema: Culture and Politics Since 1949|series=Cambridge studies in film\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jzQ9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA60|page=60}}</ref>\n\n====Taiwan====\n[[Taiwan]] dubs some foreign films and TV series in Mandarin Chinese. Until the mid-1990s, the major national [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial channels]] both dubbed and subtitled all foreign programs and films and, for some popular programs, the original voices were offered in [[second audio program]]. Gradually, however, both terrestrial and cable channels stopped dubbing for [[prime time]] U.S. shows and films, while subtitling continued.\n\nIn the 2000s, the dubbing practice has differed depending on the nature and origin of the program. Animations, children's shows and some educational programs on PTS are mostly dubbed. English live-action movies and shows are not dubbed in theaters or on television. Japanese TV dramas are no longer dubbed, while [[Korean language|Korean]] dramas, [[Hong Kong]] dramas and dramas from other Asian countries are still often dubbed. Korean variety shows are not dubbed. Japanese and Korean films on Asian movie channels are still dubbed. In theaters, most foreign films are not dubbed, while animated films and some films meant for children offer a dubbed version. Hong Kong live-action films have a long tradition of being dubbed into Mandarin, while more famous films offer a [[Cantonese]] version.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nIn [[Hong Kong]], foreign television programmes, except for English-language and Mandarin television programmes, are dubbed in Cantonese. English-language and Mandarin programmes are generally shown in their original with subtitles. Foreign films, such as most live-action and animated films (such as anime and Disney), are usually dubbed in Cantonese. However most cinemas also offer subtitled versions of English-language films.\n\nFor the most part, foreign films and TV programmes, both live-action and animated, are generally dubbed in both Mandarin and Cantonese. For example, in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film series, Elijah Wood's character [[Frodo Baggins]] was dubbed into Mandarin by [[Jiang Guangtao]] for China and Taiwan. For the Cantonese localisation, there were actually two dubs for Hong Kong and [[Macau]]. The first Cantonese dub, he was voiced by Leung Wai Tak, with a second Cantonese dub released, he was voiced by Bosco Tang.\n\nA list for Mandarin and Cantonese voice artists that dub for actors are shown here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

In programs aimed at teenagers and adults, dubbing is rarely considered for translation, not only because of its high costs, but also because the audience is mainly multi-lingual. Most viewers in Israel speak at least one European language in addition to Hebrew, and a large part of the audience also speaks [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Therefore, most viewers prefer to hear the original soundtrack, aided by Hebrew subtitles. Another problem is that dubbing does not allow for translation into two different languages simultaneously, as is often the case of Israeli television channels that use subtitles in Hebrew and another language (like [[Russian language|Russian]]) simultaneously.\n\n====Japan====\nIn Japan, many television programs appear on Japanese television subtitled or dubbed if they are intended for children. When the American film ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]'' was released in Japan in 1931, subtitles became the mainstream method of translating TV programs and films in Japan. Later, around the 1950s, foreign television programs and films began to be shown dubbed in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] on television. The first ones to be dubbed into Japanese were [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|the 1940s Superman cartoons]] in 1955.\n\nDue to the lack of video software for domestic television, video software was imported from abroad. When the television program was shown on television, it was mostly dubbed. There was a character limit for a small TV screen at a lower resolution, and this method was not suitable for the poor elderly and illiterate eye, as was audio dubbing. Presently, TV shows and movies (both those aimed at all ages and adults-only) are shown dubbed with the original language and Japanese subtitles, while providing the original language option when the same film is released on [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]]. Laserdisc releases of Hollywood films were almost always subtitled.\n\nAdult cartoons such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' are shown dubbed in Japanese on the [[WOWOW]] TV channel. ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut]]'' was dubbed in Japanese by different actors instead of the same Japanese dubbing-actors from the cartoon because it was handled by a different Japanese dubbing studio, and it was marketed for the [[Kansai region|Kansai]] market. In Japanese theaters, foreign-language movies, except those intended for children, are usually shown in their original version with Japanese subtitles. Foreign films usually contain multiple Japanese-dubbing versions, but with several different original Japanese-dubbing voice actors, depending upon which TV station they are aired. [[NHK]], [[Nippon TV]], [[Fuji TV]], [[TV Asahi]], and [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] usually follow this practice, as do software releases on [[VHS]], [[Laserdisc]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]. As for recent foreign films being released, there are now some film theaters in Japan that show both dubbed and subtitled editions.\n\nOn 22 June 2009, [[20th Century Fox]]'s Japanese division has opened up a [[Blu-ray]] lineup known as \"Emperor of Dubbing\", dedicated at having multiple Japanese dubs of popular English-language films (mostly Hollywood films) as well as retaining the original scripts, releasing them altogether in special Blu-ray releases. These also feature a new dub created exclusively for that release as a director's cut, or a new dub made with a better surround sound mix to match that of the original English mix (as most older Japanese dubbings were made on mono mixes to be aired on TV). Other companies have followed practice, like Universal Pictures's Japanese division [[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan]] opening up \"Reprint of Memories\", along with [[:ja:\u30ef\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc \u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30c6\u30a4\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8 \u30b8\u30e3\u30d1\u30f3|Warner Bros Japan]] having \"Power of Dubbing\", which act in a similar way by re-packaging all the multiple Japanese dubs of popular films and putting them out as Special Blu-ray releases.\n\n\"Japanese dub-over artists\" provide the voices for certain performers, such as those listed in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

However, some anime is censored, such as Japanese letters or content being edited for a suitable Korean audience. Western cartoons are dubbed in Korean as well, such as [[Nickelodeon]] cartoons like ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and ''[[Danny Phantom]]''. Several English-language (mostly American) live-action films are dubbed in [[Korean language|Korean]], but they are not shown in theaters. Instead they are only broadcast on South Korean television networks ([[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]], [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]], [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]], [[Educational Broadcasting System|EBS]]), while DVD import releases of these films are shown with Korean subtitles, such as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. This may be due to the fact that the six American [[major film studio]]s may not own any rights to the Korean dubs of their live-action films that the Korean television networks have dubbed and aired. Even if they don't own the rights, Korean or non-Korean viewers can record from Korean-dubbed live-action films from television broadcasting onto DVDs with [[Digital video recorder|DVRs]].\n\nSometimes, video games are dubbed in Korean. Examples would be the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' series, the ''[[Jak & Daxter (series)|Jak & Daxter]]'' series, and the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series. For the ''Halo'' games, Lee Jeong Gu provides his Korean voice to the main protagonist [[Characters of Halo|Master Chief]] (replacing [[Steve Downes]]'s voice), while [[Kim So Hyeong (voice actor)|Kim So Hyeong]] voices [[Characters of Halo|Chieftain Tartarus]], one of the main antagonists (replacing [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]'s voice).\n\nThe following South Korean voice-over artists are usually identified with the following actors:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

In big cities like Bangkok, Thai-language movies have English subtitles. <!-- For English-language animated movies, Disney films like ''[[The Lion King]]'', ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' and ''[[Tangled]]'' are dubbed entirely in Thai.\n\nChonnai Sukawat has provided the Thai-dubbing voice for the heroine Rapunzel in the film ''Tangled''. In the Thai version of ''Harry Potter'', [[Hermione Granger]] was dubbed by Thai singer and actress Bismillah Nana.

In general, the decision whether to dub a video production depends mainly on the target audience of the channel on which the feature will be aired, its genre, and/or outlet of transmission (e.g. TV or film, free or pay-TV).  \n\n=====Free-to-air TV=====\nThe prevalence of media needing to be dubbed has resulted in a talent pool that is very capable of syncing voice to lip, especially for shows broadcast by the country's three largest networks. It is not uncommon in the Filipino dub industry to have most of the voices in a series dubbing by only a handful of voice talents. Programmes originally in English used to usually air in their original language on free-to-air television. \n\nSince the late 1990s/early 2000s, however, more originally English-language programmes that air on major free-to-air networks (i.e. 5, ABS-CBN, GMA) have been dubbed into Filipino. Even the former Studio 23 (now S+A), once known for its airing programmes in English, had adopted Filipino-language dubbing for some of its foreign programmes. Children's programmes from cable networks [[Nickelodeon]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Disney Channel]] shown on [[TV5 (Philippines)|5]], GMA, or ABS-CBN, have long been dubbed into Filipino or another Philippine regional language.  [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Animated Disney films]] are often dubbed in Filipino except for the singing scenes, which are shown in their original language (though in recent years, there has been an increase in number of Disney musicals having their songs also translated such as ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'').  [[GMA News TV]] airs some documentaries, movies, and reality series originally shown in the English language as dubbed in Filipino.  \n\nDubbing is less common in smaller free-to-air networks such as [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]] and the former [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN 9]] (now CNN Philippines) whereby the original-language version of the programme is aired. Dramas from Asia (particularly Greater China and Korea) and Latin America (called ''Asianovelas'', and ''Mexicanovelas'', respectively) have always been dubbed into Filipino or another Philippine regional language, and each programme from these genres feature their unique set of Filipino-speaking voice actors.\n\n=====Pay TV=====\nThe original language-version of TV programmes is also usually available on cable/satellite channels such as [[Fox Life]], [[Fox Asia|Fox]], and AXN. However, some pay-TV channels specialise in showing foreign shows and films dubbed into Filipino. [[Cinema One]], ABS-CBN's cable movie channel, shows some films originally in non-English language dubbed into Filipino. [[Nat Geo Wild]] airs most programs dubbed into Filipino for Philippine audiences, being one of the few cable channels to do so. [[Tagalized Movie Channel|Tagalised Movie Channel]] & [[Tag (TV channel)|Tag]] airs Hollywood and Asian movies dubbed in Filipino. [[Fox Filipino]] airs some English, Latin, and Asian series dubbed in Filipino such as ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'', ''[[Devious Maids]]'', ''La Teniente'', ''Kdabra'', and some selected programs from [[Channel M (Southeast Asia)|Channel M]].  The defunct channel [[Hero (TV channel)|HERO TV]], which focuses on anime and [[tokusatsu]] shows and now a web portal, dubs all its foreign programs into Filipino. This is in contrast to Animax, where their anime programs are dubbed in English.\n\n=====Cinema=====\nForeign films, especially English films shown in local cinemas, are almost always shown in their original language.  Non-English foreign films make use of English subtitles. Unlike other countries, children's films originally in English are not dubbed in cinemas.\n\nA list of voice actors with their associates that they dub into Filipino are listed here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Dubbing is rarely done with the other major Indian languages, namely [[Malayalam]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]], due to lack of significant market size. Despite this, some [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Malayalam]] dubs of children television programs can be seen on the [[Sun TV Network|Sun TV]] channel. The dubbed versions are released into the towns and lower tier settlements of the respective states (where English penetration is low), often with the English-language originals released in the metropolitan areas. In all other states, the English originals are released along with the dubbed versions, where often the dubbed version collections are more outstanding than the originals. ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' was also done in the [[Bhojpuri language]], a language popular in [[East India|eastern India]] in addition to Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. ''[[A Good Day to Die Hard]]'', the most recent installment in the ''[[Die Hard (franchise)|Die Hard]]'' franchise, was the first ever Hollywood film to receive a [[Punjabi language|Punjabi language dub]] as well. \n\nMost TV channels mention neither the Indian-language dubbing credits, nor its staff, at the end of the original ending credits, since changing the credits casting for the original actors or voice actors involves a huge budget for modifying, making it somewhat difficult to find information for the dubbed versions. The same situation is encountered for films. Sometimes foreign programs and films receive more than one dub, such as for example, [[Jumanji]], [[Dragonheart]] and [[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]] having two Hindi dubs. Information for the Hindi, Tamil and Telugu voice actors who have done the voices for specific actors and for their roles on foreign films and television programs are published in local Indian data magazines, for those that are involved in the dubbing industry in India. But on a few occasions, there are some foreign productions that do credit the dubbing cast, such as animated films like the ''[[Barbie (film series)|Barbie]]'' films, and some Disney films. [[Disney Channel]] original series released on DVD with their Hindi dubs show a list of the artists in the Hindi dub credits, after the original ending credits. Theatrical releases and VCD releases of foreign films do not credit the dubbing cast or staff. The DVD releases, however, do have credits for the dubbing staff, if they are released multilingual. As of recently, information for the dubbing staff of foreign productions have been expanding due to high demands of people wanting to know the voice actors behind characters in foreign works. Large dubbing studios in India include [[Sound & Vision India]], [[Main Frame Software Communications]], [[Visual Reality]], [[ZamZam Productions]], [[Treasure Tower International]], [[Blue Whale Entertainment]], [[Jai Hand Entertainment]], [[Sugar Mediaz]] and [[Rudra Sound Solutionz]].\n\n====Pakistan====\nIn [[Pakistan]] \"foreign films\", and cartoons are not normally dubbed locally. Instead, foreign films, anime and cartoons, such as those shown on [[Nickelodeon Pakistan]] and [[Cartoon Network Pakistan]], are dubbed in [[Hindi]] in India, as Hindi and [[Urdu]], the national language of Pakistan, are [[mutually intelligible]].\nHowever, soap operas from [[Turkey]] are now dubbed in Urdu and have gained increased popularity at the expense of Indian soap operas in Hindi.<ref>[http://www.firstpost.com/living/in-pakistan-indian-soap-operas-give-way-to-turkish-serials-1260549.html In Pakistan, Indian soap operas give way to Turkish serials], ''[[First Post (India)|First Post]]'', 1 December 2013</ref> This has led to protests from local producers that these are a threat to Pakistan's television industry, with local productions being moved out of peak viewing time or dropped altogether.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/news/772593/is-tv-drama-industry-overreacting-to-turkish-soaps-blitz Is TV drama industry overreacting to Turkish soaps blitz?], ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', 20 December 2012</ref> Similarly, politicians leaders have expressed concerns over their content, given Turkey's less conservative culture.<ref>[http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/the-geopolitics-of-soap-operas/ The Geopolitics of Soap Operas], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 10 January 2013</ref>\n\n====Vietnam====\nIn [[Vietnam]], foreign-language films and programs are subtitled on television in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. They were not dubbed until 1985, but are briefly translated with a speaker before commercial breaks. ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' was considered to be the very first American Hollywood film to be entirely dubbed in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. Since then, children's films that came out afterwards have been released dubbed in theaters. [[HTV3]] has dubbed television programs for children, including ''[[Ben 10 (TV series)|Ben 10]]'', and ''[[Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide]]'', by using various voice actors to dub over the character roles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBlXxqhKwU |title=Ben 10 Vietnamese Trailer (Trailer Ben 10 - HTV3) |publisher=YouTube |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WbgyJP5-TA |title=HTV3 - C\u1ea9m Nang C\u1ee7a Ned - Trailer |publisher=YouTube |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nSooner afterwards, more programs started to get dubbed. HTV3 also offers anime dubbed into Vietnamese. [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]] got a Vietnamese dub in early 2014 on HTV3 starting with the Best Wishes series. But due to a controversy regarding Pok\u00e9mon's cries being re-dubbed despite that all characters had their Japanese names, it was switched to [[VTV2]] in September 2015 when the XY series debut. [[Sailor Moon (anime)|Sailor Moon]] also recently has been dubbed for HTV3 in early 2015.\n\n====Singapore====\nIn multilingual [[Singapore]], dubbing is rare for western programmes. English-language programmes on the free-to-air terrestrial channels are usually subtitled in Chinese or Malay. Chinese, Malay and Tamil programmes (except for news bulletins), usually have subtitles in English and the original language during the prime time hours. [[Dual sound]] programs, such as Korean and Japanese dramas, offer sound in the original languages with subtitles, Mandarin-dubbed and subtitled, or English-dubbed. The [[Speak Mandarin Campaign|deliberate policy to encourage Mandarin]] among citizens made it required by law for programs in other Chinese dialects ([[Min Nan|Hokkien]], Cantonese and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]) to be dubbed into Mandarin, with the exception of traditional [[opera]]s. Cantonese and Hokkien shows from Hong Kong and Taiwan, respectively, are available on VCD and DVD. In a recent development, news bulletins are subtitled.\n\n====Iran====\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Iranian Dubbing artists.jpg|thumb|A group of Iranian dubbing artists]]\nIn [[Iran]], foreign films and television programs are dubbed in [[Persian language|Persian]]. Dubbing began in 1946 with the advent of movies and cinemas in the country. Since then, foreign movies have always been dubbed for the cinema and TV. Using various voice actors and adding local hints and witticisms to the original contents, dubbing played a major role in attracting people to the cinemas and developing an interest in other cultures. The dubbing art in Iran reached its apex during the 1960s and 1970s with the inflow of American, European and Hindi movies.\n\nThe most famous musicals of the time, such as ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', were translated, adjusted and performed in Persian by the voice artists. Since the 1990s, for political reasons and under pressure from the state, the dubbing industry has declined, with movies dubbed only for the state TV channels. During recent years, DVDs with Persian subtitles have found a market among viewers for the same reason, but most people still prefer the Persian-speaking dubbed versions. Recently, privately operated companies started dubbing TV series by hiring famous dubbers.\n\nA list of Persian voice actors that associate with their actor counterparts are listed here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

There are exceptions, such as some children's cartoons.\n\n====Azerbaijan====\nIn [[Azerbaijan]], dubbing is rare, as most Azerbaijani channels such as [[G\u00fcn\u0259\u015f TV|ARB G\u00fcn\u0259\u015f]] air [[voice-over]]s or Azerbaijan originals.\n\n====Western Asia====\nSee [[#North Africa, Western Asia|below]].\n\n===Africa===\n====North Africa, Western Asia====\nIn [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and Tunisia, most foreign movies (especially Hollywood productions) are shown dubbed in French. These movies are usually imported directly from French film distributors. The choice of movies dubbed into French can be explained by the widespread use of the French language. Another important factor is that local theaters and private media companies do not dub in local languages in order to avoid high costs, but also because of the lack of both expertise and demand.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, dubbed series and movies for children in [[Modern Standard Arabic]] became a popular choice among most TV channels, cinemas and VHS/DVD stores. However, dubbed films are still imported, and dubbing is performed in the [[Levant]] countries with a strong tradition of dubbing (mainly [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]]).\n\nIn the Arabic-speaking countries, some children shows (mainly cartoons) are dubbed in Arabic, otherwise Arabic subtitles are used. The only exception was [[telenovelas]] dubbed in Standard Arabic, or dialects, but also Turkish series, most notably [[G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f (TV series)|G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f]], in Syrian Arabic.\n\nAn example of Arabic voice actors that dub for certain performers is Safi Mohammed for [[Elijah Wood]].\n\nIn [[Tunisia]], the Tunisia National Television (TNT), the public broadcaster of Tunisia, is not allowed to show any content in any language other than Arabic, which forces it to broadcast only dubbed content (this restriction was recently removed for commercials). During the 1970s and 1980s, TNT (known as ERTT at the time) started dubbing famous cartoons in Tunisian and Standard Arabic. However, in the private sector, television channels are not subject to the language rule.\n\n====South Africa====\nIn [[South Africa]], many television programmes were dubbed in [[Afrikaans]], with the original soundtrack (usually in English, but sometimes [[Dutch language|Dutch]] or [[German language|German]]) \"[[simulcast]]\" in [[FM stereo#Stereo FM|FM stereo]] on [[Radio 2000]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-NRDAQAAIAAJ&dq=was+simulcast++Radio+2000+afrikaans&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Radio+2000+afrikaans ''The voice, the vision: a sixty year history of the South African Broadcasting Corporation''], Malcolm Theunissen, Victor Nikitin, Melanie Pillay, Advent Graphics, 1996, page 120</ref> These included US series such as ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', ''(Steve Austin: Die Man van Staal)''<ref>[http://www.tvsa.co.za/mastershowinfo.asp?mastershowid=2293 The Six Million Dollar Man], TVSA - The South African TV Authority</ref> ''[[Miami Vice]]'' ''(Misdaad in Miami)'',<ref>{{cite news |title=Shows Allow Blacks, Whites to Share Cultural Experiences : South African Viewers Get a Mixed TV Message From U.S. Programs |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-25/news/mn-7271_1_south-african |accessdate=14 August 2012 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=25 May 1986|author=GLENN FRANKEL (from ''The Washington Post'')}}</ref> ''[[Beverly Hills 90210]]'',<ref>[http://mg.co.za/article/1996-02-09-the-critics-thumbs-up/ The critics' thumbs-up], ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'', 9 February 1996</ref> and the German detective series ''[[Derrick (TV series)|Derrick]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7h1DAQAAIAAJ&dq=derrick+tv+series+afrikaans&q=derrick+|title=Mass Media, Towards the Millennium|isbn=9780627023248|accessdate=9 July 2015|last1=Beer|first1=Arrie De|year=1998}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the [[boycott]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] actors' union [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], which banned the sale of most British television programmes, the [[puppet]] series ''[[The Adventures of Rupert Bear]]'' was dubbed into [[South African English]], as the original voices had been recorded by Equity voice artists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05212009-182219/unrestricted/07chapter7.pdf |last=Bevan |first=C |year=2008 |title=Putting up screens: A history of television in South Africa, 1929-1976, MHCS dissertation, University of Pretoria, Pretoria |accessdate=1 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215155949/http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05212009-182219/unrestricted/07chapter7.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThis practice has declined as a result of the reduction of airtime for the language on [[SABC]] TV, and the increase of locally produced material in Afrikaans on other channels like [[KykNet]]. Similarly, many programmes, such as ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', were dubbed into [[Zulu language|Zulu]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Lelyveld |first=Joseph |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/22/magazine/22SAFR.html?&pagewanted=all |title=South Africa: Dream and Reality |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=22 September 1985 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> but this has also declined as local drama production has increased. However, some animated films, such as ''[[Maya the Bee]]'', have been dubbed in both Afrikaans and Zulu by local artists.<ref>[http://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/News/Maya-the-Bee-flick-dubbed-into-Afrikaans-and-Zulu-for-SA-audience-20150910 Maya the Bee flick dubbed into Afrikaans and Zulu for SA audience], [[News24|Channel24]], 18 September 2015</ref>\n\n====Uganda====\nUganda's [[Cinema of Uganda|own film industry]] is fairly small, and foreign movies are commonly watched. The English sound track is often accompanied by the [[Luganda]] translation and comments, provided by an Ugandan \"video jockey\" (VJ). VJ's interpreting and narration may be available in a recorded form or live.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2012/11/cinema-uganda |title=Coming to you live\n|date=2 November 2012|journal=The Economist|first=M|last=H}}</ref>\n\n===Oceania===\nIn common with other English-speaking countries, there has traditionally been little dubbing in [[Australia]], with foreign language television programmes and films being shown (usually on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]) with subtitles or English dubs produced in other countries. This has also been the case in [[New Zealand]], but the [[M\u0101ori Television Service]], launched in 2004, has dubbed animated films into [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]].<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10117134 Maori TV broadens horizons], ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', 26 March 2005</ref> However, some TV commercials from foreign countries are dubbed, even if the original commercial came from another English-speaking country.  Moreover, the off-screen narration portions of some non-fiction programmes originating from the UK or North America are re-dubbed by Australian voice talents to relay information in expressions that Australians can understand more easily.\n\n==Alternatives==\n===Subtitles===\n{{Main|Subtitle}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[Subtitle (captioning)|Subtitles]] can be used instead of dubbing, as different countries have different traditions regarding the choice between dubbing and subtitling. On [[DVD]]s with higher translation budgets, the option for both types will often be provided to account for individual preferences; [[Purism|purists]] often demand subtitles. For small markets (small language area or films for a select audience), subtitling is more suitable, because it is cheaper. In the case of films for small children who cannot yet read, or do not read fast enough, dubbing is necessary.\n\nIn most [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, dubbing is comparatively rare. In [[Israel]], some programmes need to be comprehensible to speakers of both [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. This cannot be accomplished with dubbing, so subtitling is much more commonplace\u2014sometimes even with subtitles in multiple languages, with the soundtrack remaining in the original language, usually English. The same applies to certain television shows in [[Finland]], where [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] are both official languages.\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], [[Flanders]], [[Nordic countries]], [[Estonia]] and [[Portugal]], films and television programmes are shown in the original language (usually English) with subtitles, and only cartoons and children's movies and programs are dubbed, such as the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Shrek]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' and others. Cinemas usually show both a dubbed version and one with subtitles for this kind of movie, with the subtitled version shown later in the evening.\n\nIn Portugal, one terrestrial channel, [[TVI (Portugal)|TVI]], dubbed U.S. series like ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref name=\"DCpt\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sKswU7k_I |title=Dawson's Creek PT |last=Somnorte |date=6 December 2008 |via=YouTube}}</ref> RTP also transmitted ''[[Friends]]'' in a dubbed version, but it was poorly received and later re-aired in a subtitled version. Cartoons, on the other hand, are usually dubbed, sometimes by well-known actors, even on TV. Animated movies are usually released to the cinemas in both subtitled and dubbed versions.\n\nIn [[Argentina]] and [[Venezuela]], terrestrial channels air films and TV series in a dubbed version, as demanded by law. However, those same series can be seen on cable channels at more accessible time-slots in their subtitled version and usually before they are shown on open TV. In contrast, the series ''The Simpsons'' is aired in its Mexican Spanish-dubbed version both on terrestrial television and on the cable station Fox, which broadcasts the series for the area. Although the first season of the series appeared with subtitles, this was not continued for the following seasons.\n\n===Dubbing and subtitling===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nIn [[Bulgaria]], television series are dubbed, but most television channels use subtitles for action and drama movies. [[AXN]] uses subtitles for its series, but as of 2008 emphasises dubbing. Only [[Diema]] channels dub all programs. Movies in theaters, with the exception of films for children, use dubbing and subtitles. Dubbing of television programs is usually done using voiceovers, but usually, voices professional actors, while trying to give each character a different voice by using appropriate intonations. Dubbing with synchronised voices is rarely used, mostly for animated films. ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' is a rare example of a feature film dubbed this way on [[BNT Channel 1]], though a subtitled version is currently shown on other channels.\n\n[[Walt Disney Television]]'s animated series (such as ''[[DuckTales]]'', ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', and ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]'') were only aired with synchronised Bulgarian voices on [[BNT Channel 1]] until 2005, but then the Disney shows were canceled. When airing of Disney series resumed on [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] and [[Jetix]] in 2008, voiceovers were used, but Disney animated-movie translations still use synchronised voices. Voiceover dubbing is not used in theatrical releases. The Bulgarian film industry law requires all children's films to be dubbed, not subtitled. [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] dubbed and aired the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime with synchronised voices. Now, the show is airing on Disney Channel, also in a synchronised form.\n\n[[Netflix]] provides both subtitles and dubbed audio with its foreign language shows, including Brazil's dystopian \"[[3%]]\" and the German thriller \"[[Dark (TV series)|Dark]]\". Viewer testing indicates that its audience is more likely to finish watching a series if they select to view it with dubbed audio rather than translated subtitles. Netflix now streams its foreign language content with dubbed audio as default in an effort to increase viewer retention.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/netflix-success-secrets-1202721847/|title=Netflix's Secrets to Success: Six Cell Towers, Dubbing and More|last=Roettgers|first=Janko|date=8 March 2018|work=Variety|access-date=7 November 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==General use==\nDubbing is also used in applications and genres other than traditional film, including video games, television, and pornographic films.\n\n===Video games===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nMany [[video game]]s originally produced in [[North America]], [[Japan]], and [[PAL]] countries are dubbed into foreign languages for release in areas such as [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], especially for video games that place a heavy emphasis on dialogue. Because characters' mouth movements can be part of the game's code, [[lip sync]] is sometimes achieved by re-coding the mouth movements to match the dialogue in the new language. The [[Source engine]] automatically generates lip-sync data, making it easier for games to be localised.\n\nTo achieve synchronisation when animations are intended only for the source language, localised content is mostly recorded using techniques borrowed from movie dubbing (such as rythmo band) or, when images are not available, localised dubbing is done using source audios as a reference. Sound-synch is a method where localised audios are recorded matching the length and internal pauses of the source content.<!-- What does this last sentence mean? -->\n\nFor the European version of a video game, the on-screen text of the game is available in various languages and, in many cases, the dialogue is dubbed into each respective language, as well.\n\nThe North American version of any game is always available in [[English language|English]], with translated text and dubbed dialogue, if necessary, in other languages, especially if the North American version of the game contains the same data as the European version. Several Japanese games, such as those in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'', and ''[[Soul (series)|Soul]]'' series, are released with both the original Japanese audio and the English dub included.\n\n===Television===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nDubbing is occasionally used on [[network television]] broadcasts of films that contain dialogue that the network executives or [[Censorship|censors]] have decided to replace. This is usually done to remove [[profanity]]. In most cases, the original actor does not perform this duty, but an actor with a similar voice reads the changes. The results are sometimes seamless, but, in many cases, the voice of the replacement actor sounds nothing like the original performer, which becomes particularly noticeable when extensive dialogue must be replaced. Also, often easy to notice, is the sudden absence of background sounds in the movie during the dubbed dialogue. Among the films considered notorious for using substitute actors that sound very different from their theatrical counterparts are the ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' and the ''[[Die Hard series|Die Hard]]'' film series, as shown on broadcasters such as [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]]. In the case of ''Smokey and the Bandit'', extensive dubbing was done for the first network airing on [[ABC Television]] in 1978, especially for [[Jackie Gleason]]'s character, [[Buford T. Justice]]. The dubbing of his phrase \"sombitch\" (son of a bitch) became \"scum bum,\" which became a catchphrase of the time.\n\nDubbing is commonly used in [[science fiction television]], as well. Sound generated by effects equipment such as [[Animatronics|animatronic]] puppets or by actors' movements on elaborate multi-level plywood sets (for example, starship bridges or other command centers) will quite often make the original character dialogue unusable. ''[[Stargate]]'' and ''[[Farscape]]'' are two prime examples where ADR is used heavily to produce usable audio.\n\nSince some anime series contain profanity, the studios recording the English dubs often re-record certain lines if a series or movie is going to be broadcast on [[Cartoon Network]], removing references to [[death]] and [[hell]] as well. Some companies will offer both an edited and an uncut version of the series on DVD, so that there is an edited script available in case the series is broadcast. Other companies also edit the full-length version of a series, meaning that even on the uncut DVD characters say things like \"Blast!\" and \"Darn!\" in place of the original dialogue's profanity. [[Bandai|Bandai Entertainment's]] English dub of ''[[G Gundam]]'' is infamous for this, among many other things, with such lines as \"Bartender, more milk\".\n\nDubbing has also been used for comedic purposes, replacing lines of dialogue to create comedies from footage that was originally another genre. Examples include the Australian shows ''[[The Late Show (1990s Australian TV series)#The Olden Days|The Olden Days]]'' and ''[[Bargearse]]'', re-dubbed from 1970s Australian drama and action series, respectively, the Irish show ''[[Soupy Norman]]'', re-dubbed from ''[[:pl:Pierwsza mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107|Pierwsza mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107]]'', a Polish soap opera, and ''[[Most Extreme Elimination Challenge]]'', a comedic dub of the Japanese show ''[[Takeshi's Castle]]''.\n\nDubbing into a foreign language does not always entail the deletion of the original language. In some countries, a performer may read the translated dialogue as a voice-over. This often occurs in [[Russia]] and [[Poland]], where \"lektories\" or \"lektors\" read the translated dialogue into [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]. In Poland, one announcer read all text. However, this is done almost exclusively for the television and home video markets, while theatrical releases are usually subtitled. Recently, however, the number of high-quality, fully dubbed films has increased, especially for children's movies. If a quality dubbed version exists for a film, it is shown in theaters. However, some films, such as ''[[Harry Potter]]'' or ''[[Star Wars]]'', are shown in both dubbed and subtitled versions, varying with the time of the show. Such films are also shown on TV (although some channels drop them and do standard one-narrator translation) and VHS/DVD. In other countries, like [[Vietnam]], the voice-over technique is also used for theatrical releases.<!-- This section and the next one are redundant. This material has already been covered and should be merged above. -->\n\nIn Russia, the reading of all lines by a single person is referred to as a [[Gavrilov translation]], and is generally found only in [[Copyright infringement|illegal copies]] of films and on [[cable television]]. Professional copies always include at least two actors of opposite gender translating the dialogue. Some titles in Poland have been dubbed this way, too, but this method lacks public appeal, so it is very rare now.\n\nOn special occasions, such as [[film festival]]s, live [[interpreting]] is often done by professionals.\n\n===Pornography===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nAs budgets for [[pornographic film]]s are often small, compared to films made by major studios, and there is an inherent need to film without interrupting filming, it is common for sex scenes to be over-dubbed. The audio for such over-dubbing is generally referred to as ''the Ms and Gs'', or ''the moans and groans.''\n\n==Dubbing into varieties==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2013}}\nIn the case of languages with large communities (such as [[English language|English]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], or [[French language|French]]), a single translation may sound foreign to native speakers in a given region. Therefore, a film may be translated into a certain variety of a certain language. For example, the animated movie ''[[The Incredibles]]'' was translated to [[European Spanish]], [[Mexican Spanish]], [[Neutral Spanish]] (which is Mexican Spanish but avoids colloquialisms), and [[Rioplatense Spanish]] (although people from [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]] noticed a strong ''[[porte\u00f1o]]'' accent from most of the characters of the Rioplatense Spanish translation).{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} In [[List of countries where Spanish is an official language|Spanish-speaking regions]], most media is dubbed twice: into European Spanish and Neutral Spanish.\n\nAnother example is the French dubbing of ''The Simpsons'', which has two entirely different versions for [[Quebec]] and for [[France]]. The humor is very different for each audience (see [[Non-English versions of The Simpsons|Non-English versions of ''The Simpsons'']]). Audiences in Quebec are generally critical of France's dubbing of ''The Simpsons'', which they often do not find amusing.\n\n[[Quebec French|Quebec-French]] dubbing of films is generally made in accent-free [[Standard French]], but may sound peculiar to audiences in France because of the persistence of some regionally-neutral expressions and because Quebec-French performers pronounce Anglo-Saxon names with an American accent, unlike French performers. Occasionally, budget restraints cause American [[direct-to-video]] films, such as the 1995 film ''When the Bullet Hits the Bone'', to be released in France with a Quebec-French dubbing, sometimes resulting in what some members of French audiences perceive as unintentional humor.\n\n[[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]] also use different versions of dubbed films and series. Because dubbing has never been very popular in [[Portugal]], for decades, children's films were distributed using the higher-quality Brazilian dub (unlike children's TV series, which are traditionally dubbed in European Portuguese). Only in the 1990s did dubbing begin to gain popularity in Portugal. ''[[The Lion King]]'' became the first Disney feature film to be completely dubbed into [[European Portuguese]], and subsequently all major animation films gained European-Portuguese versions. In recent [[DVD]] releases, most Brazilian-Portuguese-dubbed classics were released with new European-Portuguese dubs, eliminating the predominance of Brazilian-Portuguese dubs in Portugal.\n\nSimilarly, in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking region of [[Flanders]], [[Belgium]], cartoons are often dubbed locally by [[Flemish]] artists{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} rather than using soundtracks produced in the [[Netherlands]].\n\nThe [[list of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking region]], which includes [[Germany]], [[Austria]], part of [[Switzerland]], and [[Liechtenstein]], share a common German-dubbed version of films and shows. Although there are some differences in the three major German varieties, all films, shows, and series are dubbed into a single [[Standard German]] version that avoids regional variations in the German-speaking audience. Most voice actors are primarily German or Austrian. Switzerland, which has four official languages (German, French, [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Romansh language|Romansh]]), generally uses dubbed versions made in each respective country (except for Romansh). Liechtenstein uses German-dubbed versions only.\n\nSometimes, films are also dubbed into several [[German dialects]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ([[Berlinerisch]], [[Colognian language|K\u00f6lsch]], [[Saxonian]], [[Austro-Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]] or [[Swiss German]]), especially animated films and Disney films. They are as an additional \"special feature\" to entice the audience into buying it. Popular animated films dubbed into German variety include ''[[Asterix]]'' films (in addition to its Standard German version, every film has a particular variety version), ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ''[[Shrek 2]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', (+ Austrian German){{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} and ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OBS_20090810_OBS0008 |title=\u00d6sterreich-Version von Disney/Pixars \"Oben\" mit Otto Schenk und Karlheinz B\u00f6hm - BILD |language=de |publisher=ots.at |date=10 August 2009 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> (+ Austrian German).\n\nSome live-action films or TV-series have an additional German variety dubbing: ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'' (German German, Austrian German, Swiss German); and ''[[Rehearsal for Murder]]'', ''[[Framed (TV series)|Framed]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://215072.homepagemodules.de/topic-threaded.php?forum=11776730&threaded=1&id=506508&message=6643629 |title=Allgemeines \" ORF-Synchronisationen - Wer wei\u00df was? |publisher=215072.homepagemodules.de |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> (+ Austrian German); ''[[The Munsters]]'', ''[[Serpico]]'', ''[[Rumpole]]'' (+ Austrian German), and ''[[The Thorn Birds]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://215072.homepagemodules.de/topic-threaded.php?forum=11776728&threaded=1&id=506269&message=7100872 |title=Serien \" 24 |publisher=215072.homepagemodules.de |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n(only Austrian German dubbing).\n\nBefore [[German reunification]], [[East Germany]] also made its own particular German version. For example, ''[[Olsen-banden|Olsen Gang]]'' and the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] animated series ''[[The M\u00e9zga Family]]'' were dubbed in [[West Germany]] as well as East Germany.\n\nUsually, there are two dubbings produced in [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]: [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. Serbian for [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]; Croatian for [[Croatia]] and parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n\nWhile the voice actors involved usually bear the brunt of criticisms towards poor dubbing, other factors may include inaccurate script translation and poor [[Audio mixing (television and film)|audio mixing]]. Dialogue typically contains speech patterns and sentence structure that are natural to the original language but would appear awkward if translated literally. English dubs of Japanese animation, for example, must rewrite the dialogue so that it flows smoothly while following the natural pattern of English speech. On some occasions, voice actors record their dialogue individually instead of with the rest of the cast, and their performances can lack the dynamics gained from performing as a group.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nMany [[martial arts]] movies from [[Hong Kong]] that were imported under the unofficial banner [[Kung Fu Theater]] were notorious{{according to whom|date=June 2019}} for seemingly careless dubbing that included poor lip sync and awkward dialogue. Since the results were frequently unintentionally humorous, it has become one of the hallmarks that endear these films to fans of the 1980s culture.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{commons category|Dubbing (filmmaking)}}\n*{{Cite book |last1=Maluf |first1=Ramez |title=Dubbing into Arabic: A Trojan Horse at the Gates? |url=http://inhouse.lau.edu.lb/bima/papers/Dubbing.pdf |accessdate=10 April 2011 |date=19 December 2003 |publisher=[[Lebanese American University]]}}\n*Di Fortunato E. e Paolinelli M.

The insertion of [[voice acting|voice actor]] performances for [[animation]], such as [[computer generated imagery]] or [[animated cartoon]]s, is often referred to as ADR although it generally does not replace existing dialogue.\n\nThe ADR process may be used to: \n\n:*remove extraneous sounds such as production equipment noise, traffic, wind, or other undesirable sounds from the environment\n:*change the original lines recorded on set to clarify context \n:*improve [[diction]] or modify an [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]\n:*improve [[comic timing|comedic timing]] or dramatic timing\n:*correct technical issues with [[synchronization|synchronisation]]\n:*use a studio-quality singing performance or provide a voice-double for actors who are poor vocalists\n:*add or remove content for legal purposes (such as removing an unauthorised trademarked name)\n:*add or remove a product placement\n:*correct a misspoken line not caught during filming.\n:*replace foul language for TV broadcasts of a movie or other program\nIn conventional film production, a [[production sound mixer]] records dialogue during filming. During post-production, a supervising [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]], or ADR supervisor, reviews all of the dialogue in the film and decides which lines must be re-recorded. ADR is recorded during an ADR session, which takes place in a specialised [[Recording studio|sound studio]]. The actor, usually the original actor from the set, views the scene with the original sound, then attempts to recreate the performance. Over the course of multiple [[take]]s, the actor performs the lines while watching the scene; the most suitable take becomes the final version.<ref>{{cite web |title=ADR |publisher=FilmSound.org |url=http://filmsound.org/terminology/adr.htm |accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref> The ADR process does not always take place in a post-production studio. The process may be recorded on location, with mobile equipment. ADR can also be recorded without showing the actor the image they must match, but by having them listen to the performance, since some actors{{who|date=June 2019}} believe that watching themselves act can degrade subsequent performances.\n\nSometimes, an actor other than the original actor is used during ADR. One famous example is the ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Darth Vader]], portrayed by [[David Prowse]]; in post-production, [[James Earl Jones]] dubbed the voice of Vader.<ref>{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |title=Film: Lucas Returns with 'The Jedi' |date=25 May 1983 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9c00e3d71e38f936a15756c0a965948260 |accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nOther examples include:\n*[[Jean Hagen]] provided [[Debbie Reynolds]]' voice in two scenes of ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952). Ironically, the film's story has Reynolds' character, Kathy Seldon, dubbing the voice for ''Hagen's'' character, Lina Lamont, due to Lina's grating voice and strong New York accent. Hagen used her own normal melodious voice to portray Kathy dubbing for Lina. The film, which takes place in Hollywood as talking pictures are taking over from silent films, also portrays another character, Cosmo Brown, played by [[Donald O'Connor]], as inventing the idea of using one actor to provide the voice for another.\n*[[Marni Nixon]] provided the singing voice for the character [[Eliza Doolittle]], otherwise played by [[Audrey Hepburn]], in the 1964 musical film ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''. Nixon was also the singing voices for [[Deborah Kerr]] in ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' and [[Natalie Wood]] in ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'', among many others.\n*[[Ray Park]], who acted as [[Darth Maul]] from ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' had his voice dubbed over by [[Peter Serafinowicz]]\n*Frenchmen [[Philippe Noiret]] and [[Jacques Perrin]], who were dubbed into Italian for ''[[Cinema Paradiso]]''\n*Austrian bodybuilder [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], dubbed for ''[[Hercules in New York]]''\n*Argentine boxer [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]], dubbed by a professional actor for the lead in the drama ''[[La Mary]]''\n*[[Gert Fr\u00f6be]], who played [[Auric Goldfinger]] in the James Bond film [[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]], dubbed by [[Michael Collins (English actor)|Michael Collins]]\n*[[Andie MacDowell]]'s Jane, in ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]'', who was dubbed by [[Glenn Close]]\n*[[Tom Hardy]], who portrayed [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] in ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', re-dubbed half of his own lines for ease of viewer comprehension\n*[[Harvey Keitel]] was dubbed by [[Roy Dotrice]] in post production for ''[[Saturn 3]]''\n*[[Dave Coulier]] dubbed replacement of swear words for [[Richard Pryor]] in multiple TV versions of his movies\n*[[Doug Jones]] was dubbed by [[Laurence Fishburne]] in post production for ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]''\n\n===Process===\nThe tasks involved are performed by three different agents{{clarify|What are agents, and what are the three kinds of agents?|date=June 2019}} in the dubbing process: \n# translation \n# take segmentation \n# insertion of dubbing symbols \n# lip-sync \n# dialogue writing and the emulation of natural discourse\n\nSometimes the translator performs all five tasks. In other cases, the translator just submits a rough translation and a dialogue writer does the rest.\n\n====Dialog writing====\n\nThe dialogue writer\u2019s role is to make the translation sound natural of the target language, and to make the translation sound like a credible dialogue instead of merely a translated text.<ref>Chaume, F. (2013). Research paths in audiovisual translation: The case of dubbing. In The Routledge handbook of translation studies (pp. \n306-320). Routledge.</ref>\n\nAnother task of dialogue writers is to check whether a translation matches an on-screen character\u2019s mouth movements or not, by reading aloud simultaneously with the character. The dialogue writer often stays in the recording setting with the actors or the voice talents, to ensure that the dialogue is being spoken in the way that it was written to be, and to avoid any ambiguity in the way the dialogue is to be read (focusing on emphasis, intonation, pronunciation, articulation, pronouncing foreign words correctly, etc.). The overall goal is to make sure the script creates the illusion of authenticity of the spoken language.\n\n====Rythmo band====\nAn alternative method to dubbing, called \"rythmo band\" (or \"[[Lip sync|lip-sync]] band\"), has historically been used in [[Canada]] and [[France]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} It provides a more precise guide{{explain|how is it more precise? What's the difference?|date=June 2019}} for the actors, [[Film director|directors]], and technicians, and can be used to complement the traditional ADR method. The \"band\" is actually a clear 35&nbsp;mm [[film leader]] on which the dialogue is hand-written in [[India ink]], together with numerous additional indications for the actor\u2014including laughs, cries, length of syllables, mouth sounds, breaths, and mouth openings and closings. The rythmo band is projected in the studio and scrolls in perfect synchronisation with the picture.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nStudio time is used more efficiently, since with the aid of scrolling text, picture, and audio cues, actors can read more lines per hour than with ADR alone (only picture and audio). With ADR, actors can average 10\u201312 lines per hour, while rythmo band can facilitate the reading of 35-50 lines per hour.<ref>{{cite web |title=U of U Sound Final |url=http://quizlet.com/8640541/u-of-u-sound-final-flash-cards/ |work=Quizlet |publisher=Quizlet LLC |accessdate=30 July 2012 |author=Quizlet |year=2012}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the preparation of a rythmo band is a time-consuming process involving a series of specialists organised in a production line. This has prevented the technique from being more widely adopted, but software emulations of rythmo band technology overcome the disadvantages of the traditional rythmo band process and significantly reduce the time needed to prepare a dubbing session.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}o\n\n==<span id=\"Practice of dubbing foreign films throughout the world\"></span> Global use==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Dub localization===\nDub localization, also often simply referred to as [[Language localization|localization]], is the practice of [[voice-over translation]] that alters a [[film]] or [[television series]] from one region of the world to the local language of another.\n\nThe new voice track is usually spoken by a [[voice actor]]. In many countries, actors who regularly perform this duty remain little-known, with the exception of particular circles (such as anime [[fandom]]) or when their voices have become synonymous with roles or actors whose voices they usually dub. In the United States, many of these voice artists may employ pseudonyms or go uncredited due to [[Screen Actors Guild]] regulations or the desire to dissociate themselves from the role.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nDub localisation is a contentious issue in [[cinephilia]] amongst aficionados of foreign [[filmmaking]] and [[television program]]s, particularly [[anime]] fans. While some localisation is virtually inevitable in translation, the controversy surrounding how much localisation is \"too much\" is often discussed in such communities, especially when the final dub product is significantly different from the original. Some fans frown on any extensive localisation, while others expect it, and to varying degrees, appreciate it.\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Dubbing films in Europe.png|thumb|300px|{{legend|#0000FF|Dubbing only for children: Otherwise solely subtitles.}}\n{{legend|#FF0000|General dubbing: Countries using a full-cast dubbing.}}\n{{legend|#FFFF00|Voice-over: Countries using a couple or just one voice actor, whereas the original soundtrack persists.

For movies in cinemas with clear target audiences (both below and above 10\u201311 years of age), both a dubbed and a subtitled version are usually available.\n\n=====Albania=====\nThe first movie dubbed in [[Albanian language]] was ''[[The Great Warrior Skanderbeg]]'' in 1954 and since then, there have been thousands of popular titles dubbed in Albanian by different dubbing studios. All animated movies and children's programs are dubbed into Albanian language, many live-action movies as well. TV series nevertheless are usually not dubbed, they are subtitled except for a few [[Mexico|Mexican]], [[Brazil]]ian and [[Turkey|Turkish]] soap operas, like: ''[[Por ti (telenovela)|Por Ti]]'', ''[[Celebridade]]'', ''[[A Casa das Sete Mulheres]]'', ''[[Parampar\u00e7a (TV series)|Parampar\u00e7a]]'', etc. As for documentaries, Albania usually uses voice-over.\n\n=====Belgium=====\nIn the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium ([[Flanders]]), movies and TV series are shown in their original language with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], with the exception of most movies made for a young audience. In the latter case, sometimes separate versions are recorded in the [[Netherlands]] and in [[Flanders]] (for instance, several [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Walt Disney films]] and [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]]). These dubbed versions only differ from each other in their use of different voice actors and different pronunciation, while the text is almost the same.\n\nIn the French-speaking part of Belgium ([[Wallonia]]), the range of French-dubbed versions is approximately as wide as the [[German language|German]] range, where nearly all movies and TV series are dubbed.\n\n=====Bosnia and Herzegovina=====\n[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] usually uses [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] dubs, but they have dubbed some cartoons in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] by themselves, for example ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]''. Children's programs (both animated and live-action) are airing dubbed (in Serbian, Croatian or Bosnian), while every other program is subtitled (in Bosnian).\n\n=====Croatia=====\nIn [[Croatia]], foreign films and TV series are always subtitled, while most children's programs and animated movies are dubbed into [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. The practice of dubbing began in the 1980s in some animated shows and continued in 90's, 00's and forward in other shows and films, the latter ones being released in home media. Recently, more efforts have been made to introduce dubbing, but public reception has been poor in some exceptions. Regardless of language, Croatian audiences prefer subtitling to dubbing, however it is still popular in animated films. Some previously popular shows (such as ''[[Sailor Moon]]'') lost their appeal completely after the practice of dubbing began, and the dubbing was eventually removed from the programs, even though most animated shows shown on television and some on home media have been well received by people watching dubbed versions of them. This situation is similar with theater movies, with only those intended for children being dubbed (such as ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and ''[[Shark Tale]]''), but nowadays are shown in dubbed versions. Also, there has been an effort to impose dubbing by [[Nova TV (Croatia)|Nova TV]], with ''[[La Fea M\u00e1s Bella]]'' translated as ''Ru\u017ena ljepotica'' (literally, \"The Ugly Beauty\"), a Mexican telenovela, but it failed. Some of [[Croatian language|Croatian]] dubbing is also broadcast in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].\n\n=====Estonia=====\nIn [[Estonia]] in cinemas, only children's animated films are dubbed and live-action films are shown in the original English and Russian languages with subtitles at cinemas. Subtitles are usually presented in both Estonian and [[Russian language]]s. Cartoons and animated series voiced by dubbing or [[Voice-over|voiceover]] and live-action films and television series only with Estonian subtitles also but with English and Russian Dub Languages. Animated films are commonly shown in both the originals and Russian languages and dubbed into Estonian (or Russian in many cinemas). Most Estonian-language television channels use subtitles English and Russian Audio for foreign-language films and TV channels. However, Russian language channels tend to use dubbing more often, especially for Russian channels broadcast from [[Russia]] (as opposed to Russian channels broadcast from Estonia).\n\n=====Greece=====\nIn [[Greece]], most cartoon films have dubs. Usually when a movie has a Greek dub the dub is shown in cinemas but subtitled versions are shown as well. Foreign TV shows for adults are shown in their original versions with subtitles, most cartoons, for example, ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and ''[[The Jetsons]]'' were always dubbed, while ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[American Dad!]]'' are always subtitled and contain the original English dialogue, since they are mostly for adults rather than children, (even though the movie ''[[Space Jam]]'' was subtitled instead of being dubbed, since also this is suitable for children). Also some Japanese anime series are dubbed in Greek (such as Pok\u00e9mon, Pichi Pichi Pitch, Sailor Moon etc.) The only television programs dubbed in Greek includes [[Mexico|Mexican]] TV series (like ''[[Rub\u00ed (2004 telenovela)|Rub\u00ed]]'' and ''[[La usurpadora (Mexican TV series)|La usurpadora]]'') and teen series (like ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' and ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''). However, when [[Skai TV]] was re-launched in April 2006, the network opted for dubbing almost all foreign shows in Greek, unlike other Greek channels which had always broadcast most of the programs in their original language with subtitles.\n\n=====Ireland=====\nIreland usually receives the same film versions as the UK. However some films have been dubbed into [[Irish language|Irish]] by [[TG4]], including the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bY4JK5PR4MAC&lpg=PA275&ots=D6dkX7Up-y&dq=Harry%20Potter%20TG4&pg=PA275#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Writing and Translating for Children''], Elena Di Giovanni, Chiara Elefante, Roberta Pederzoli, Peter Lang, 2010, page 259</ref>\n\n=====Netherlands=====\nIn the [[Netherlands]], for the most part, Dutch versions are only made for children's and family films. Animated movies are shown in theaters with Dutch dubbing, but usually those cinemas with more screening rooms also provide the original subtitled version, such as movies like ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''.\n\n=====North Macedonia=====\n[[North Macedonia]] dubbed many cartoons in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], but they also air some [[Serbian language|Serbian]] dubs. Children's programs are airing dubbed (in Macedonian or Serbian), while every other program is subtitled (in Macedonian). They use [[Serbian language|Serbian]] dubs for [[Disney]] movies, because there are no [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] [[Disney]] dubs.\n\n=====Poland=====\n{{essay|section|date=October 2016}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nIn [[Poland]], cinema releases for general audiences are almost exclusively subtitled, with the exception of children's movies, and television screenings of movies, as well as made-for-TV shows. These are usually shown with voice-over, where a voice talent reads a translation over the original soundtrack. This method, called \"juxtareading,\" is similar to the so-called [[Gavrilov translation]] in Russia, with one difference\u2014all dialogues are voiced by one off-screen reader ({{lang-pl|lektor}}), preferably with a deep and neutral voice which does not interfere with the pitch of voice of the original speakers in the background. To some extent, it resembles live translation. Certain highly qualified voice talents are traditionally assigned to particular kinds of production, such as action or drama. Standard dubbing is not widely popular with most audiences, with the exception of cartoons and children's shows, which are dubbed also for TV releases.\n\nIt is claimed that, until around 1951, there were no revoiced foreign movies available in Poland. Instead, they were exclusively subtitled in Polish.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das kulturelle Leben der Deutschen in Niederschlesien unter polnischer Verwaltung. 1947-1958|first=Bernhard|last=Grund|publisher=Bundesministerium f\u00fcr gesamtdeutsche Fragen|place=Bonn und Berlin|date=1967|series=Bonner Berichte aus Mittel- und Ostdeutschland|page=119}}</ref>\n\nPoland's dubbing traditions began between the two world wars. In 1931, among the first movies dubbed into Polish were ''[[Dangerous Curves (1929 film)|Dangerous Curves]]'' (1929), ''[[The Dance of Life]]'' (1929), ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' (1930), and ''[[Darling of the Gods]]'' (1930). In 1949, the first dubbing studio opened in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. The first film dubbed that year was ''Russkiy Vopros'' (filmed 1948).\n\nPolish dubbing in the first post-war years suffered from poor synchronisation. Polish dialogues were not always audible and the cinema equipment of that time often made films sound less clear than they were. In the 1950s, Polish publicists discussed the quality of Polish versions of foreign movies.\n\nThe number of dubbed movies and the quality improved. Polish dubbing had a golden age between the 1960s and the 1980s. Approximately a third of foreign movies screened in cinemas were dubbed. The \"Polish dubbing school\" was known for its high quality. In that time, Poland had some of the best dubbing in the world. The person who initiated high-quality dubbing versions was director Zofia Dybowska-Aleksandrowicz. In that time, dubbing in Poland was very popular. Polish television dubbed popular films and TV series such as ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]''; ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', ''[[Forsyte Saga]]'', ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', ''[[I, Claudius]]'', ''[[I'll Take Manhattan (miniseries)|I'll Take Manhattan]]'', and ''[[Peter the Great (TV series)|Peter the Great]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s, due to budget cuts, state-run TV saved on tapes by voicing films over live during transmission.\n\nOverall, during 1948\u20131998, almost 1,000 films were dubbed in Polish. In the 1990s, dubbing films and TV series continued, although often also for one emission only.\n\nIn 1995, [[Canal+]] was launched in Poland. In its first years, it dubbed 30% of its schedule dubbing popular films and TV series, one of the best-known and popular dubbings was that of ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'', but this proved unsuccessful.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151222233455/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119215016517556740 On Polish TV, Desperate Wives Sound Like Guys], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 12 October 2007</ref> It stopped dubbing films in 1999, although many people supported the idea of dubbing and bought the access only for dubbing versions of foreign productions. In the 1990s, dubbing was done by the television channel known as [[Wizja Jeden]]. They mainly dubbed [[BBC]] productions such as ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]''. Wizja Jeden was closed in 2001. In the same year, TVP stopped dubbing the TV series ''[[Frasier]]'', although that dubbing was very popular.\n\nCurrently, dubbing of films and TV series for teenagers is made by Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. One of the major breakthroughs in dubbing was the Polish release of ''Shrek'', which contained many references to local culture and Polish humour. Since then, people seem to have grown to like dubbed versions more, and pay more attention to the dubbing actors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} However, this seems to be the case only with animated films, as live-action dubbing is still considered a bad practice. In the case of [[DVD|DVD releases]], most discs contain both the original soundtrack and subtitles, and either voice over or dubbed Polish track. The dubbed version is, in most cases, the one from the theater release, while voice-over is provided for movies that were only subtitled in theaters.\n\nSince theatrical release of ''The Avengers'' in May 2012, Walt Disney Company Polska dubs all films for cinema releases. Also in 2012, [[United International Pictures]] Polska dubbed ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', while Forum Film Polska \u2013 former distributor of Disney's films \u2013 decided to dub ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', along with its [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|two]] [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|sequels]]. However, when a dub is produced but the film's target audience is not exclusively children, both dubbed and subtitled versions are usually available in movie theaters. The dubbed versions are more commonly shown in morning and early afternoon hours, with the subtitled version dominating in the evening. Both can be available in parallel at similar hours in multiplexes.\n\n=====Portugal=====\nIn [[Portugal]], dubbing was banned under a 1948 law as a way of protecting the domestic film industry and reduce the access to culture as most of the population was illiterate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amordeperdicao.pt/especiais_solo.asp?artigoid=206 |title=amor de perdi\u00e7\u00e3o - especiais |date=21 January 2005 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050121055806/http://www.amordeperdicao.pt/especiais_solo.asp?artigoid=206 |archivedate=21 January 2005  }}</ref> Until 1994, animated movies, as well as other TV series for children shown in Portugal, have imported [[Brazilian Portuguese]] dubs due to the lack of interest from Portuguese companies in the dubbing industry. This lack of interest was justified, since there were already quality dubbed copies of shows and movies in Portuguese made by [[Brazil]]ians. ''[[The Lion King]]'' was the first feature film to be dubbed in [[European Portuguese]] rather than strictly Brazilian Portuguese. Currently, all movies for children are dubbed in European Portuguese. Subtitles are preferred in Portugal,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jornaleconomico.sapo.pt/noticias/polemica-dobragem-serie-einstein-gera-criticas-axn-118969|title=Pol\u00e9mica: dobragem da s\u00e9rie 'Einstein' gera cr\u00edticas ao AXN|access-date=29 March 2017|date=3 February 2017|work=O Jornal Econ\u00f3mico|quote=Ao contr\u00e1rio de alguns mercados como o espanhol e brasileiro, o p\u00fablico portugu\u00eas n\u00e3o se mostra recetivo a esta op\u00e7\u00e3o.|language=portuguese}}</ref> used in every foreign-language [[Documentary film|documentary]], TV series and film. The exception to this preference is when children are the target audience.\n\nWhile on TV, children's shows and movies are always dubbed, in cinemas, films with a clear juvenile target can be found in two versions, one dubbed (identified by the letters V.P. for ''vers\u00e3o portuguesa'' - \"Portuguese version\") and another subtitled version (V.O. for ''vers\u00e3o original'' - \"original version\"). This duality applies only to juvenile films. Others use subtitles only. While the quality of these dubs is recognised (some have already received international recognition and prizes), original versions with subtitles are usually preferred by the adults (''[[Bee Movie]]'', for example). Dubbing cartoons aimed at adults (such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' or ''[[South Park]]'') is less common. When ''The Simpsons Movie'' debuted in Portugal, most cinemas showed both versions (V.O. and V.P.), but in some small cities, cinemas decided to offer only the Portuguese version, a decision that led to public protest. Presently, [[live action]] series and movies are always shown in their original language format with Portuguese subtitles. Television programs for young children (such as ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[Big Bad Beetleborgs]]'', etc.) are dubbed into European Portuguese. Some video games aimed at adults (such as [[God of War III]], [[Halo 3]], [[Assassin's Creed III]] and [[inFamous 2]]) are dubbed in European Portuguese, although there they provide an option to select the original language.\n\n=====Romania=====\n<!-- Please do not change this section to Hungarian, because graph QA11 of the Eurobarometer lists the number 62 next to RO (Romania). Hungary is HU.-->\nIn [[Romania]], virtually all programmes intended for children are dubbed in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], including cartoons, live-action movies and TV series on [[Disney Channel Romania|Disney Channel]], [[Cartoon Network (Europe)|Cartoon Network]], [[Minimax tv|Minimax]], and [[Nickelodeon]], as well as those shown on general television networks, children-focused series (such as ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[The New Addams Family]]'', ''[[The Planet's Funniest Animals]]'') or movies screened on children's television. Animated movies are shown in theaters with Romanian dubbing. However, those cinemas with more screening rooms usually also provide the original subtitled version. Such was the case for movies like ''[[Babe (movie)|Babe]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Cars (movie)|Cars]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''. Other foreign TV shows and movies are shown in the original language with Romanian subtitles. Subtitles are usually preferred in the Romanian market. According to \"Special Eurobarometer 243\" (graph QA11.8) of the [[European Commission]] (research carried out in November and December 2005), 62% of Romanians prefer to watch foreign films and programmes with subtitles (rather than dubbed), 22% prefer dubbing, and 16% declined to answer.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\">[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 243] of the European Commission with the title \"Europeans and their Languages\", published in February 2006 with research carried out in November and December 2005. Barely 2% of Romanians consider watching original-language versions most effective into learning a new language (Table QA7b).</ref> This is led by the assumption that watching movies in their original versions is very useful for learning foreign languages. However, according to the same Eurobarometer, virtually no Romanian found this method\u2014watching movies in their original version\u2014to be the most efficient way to learn foreign languages, compared to 53 percent who preferred language lessons at school.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\" />\n\nIn Romania, foreign language television programs and films are generally subtitled rather than dubbed.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=csMetRFKXmgC&lpg=PT61&dq=romania%20dubbing%20tv&pg=PT61#v=onepage&q=romania%20dubbing%20tv&f=true ''Dracula is Dead: How Romanians Survived Communism, Ended It, and Emerged Since 1989 as the New Italy''], Sheilah Kast, Jim Rosapepe, 2009, page 49</ref> This includes programs in non-Western languages, such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Korean language|Korean]] or [[Hindi language|Hindi]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aXutBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA91&dq=romania+subtitles+television&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiI-s2aysvOAhXrAMAKHXs4Ca4Q6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&q=romania%20subtitles%20television&f=true ''The Global Impact of South Korean Popular Culture: Hallyu Unbound''], Valentina Marinescu, Lexington Books, 2014, page 91</ref>\n\n=====Serbia=====\n[[Serbian language]] dubs are made mainly for [[Serbia]], but they broadcast in [[Montenegro]] and [[Bosnia & Herzegovina]], too. Children's animated and some live-action movies and TV series are dubbed into Serbian, while live-action films and TV series for adults are always airing subtitled, because in this region people prefer subtitling for live-action formats. [[Turkey|Turkish]] soap opera ''[[Lale Devri]]'' started airing dubbed in 2011, on [[RTV Pink]], but because of bad reception, dub failed and rest of TV series was aired subtitled. ''[[Married... with Children]]'' was dubbed, too.\n\nThe dubbing of cartoon series in former [[Yugoslavia]] during the 1980s had a twist of its own: famous [[Serbia]]n actors, such as [[Nikola Simi\u0107 (actor)|Nikola Simi\u0107]], [[Mi\u0107a Tati\u0107]], [[Nada Blam]] and others provided the voices for characters of [[Disney]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and other companies, frequently using region-specific phrases and sentences and, thus, adding a dose of local humor to the translation of the original lines. These phrases became immensely popular and are still being used for [[tongue-in-cheek]] comments in specific situations. These dubs are today considered cult dubs. The only dub made after 1980s and 1990s ones that's considered cult is ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' dub, made by [[B92]] in period 2002\u20132017, because of a great popularity and memorable translation with local humor phrases, such as 1980s dubs translation.\n\nSome Serbian dubs are also broadcast in [[North Macedonia]], while cult dubs made during [[Yugoslavia]] were aired all over the country (today's [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[Slovenia]], [[North Macedonia]] and [[Serbia]]).\n\n=====Slovenia=====\nIn [[Slovenia]], all foreign films and television programs are subtitled with the exception of children's movies and TV shows (both animated or live-action). While dubbed versions are always shown in cinemas and later on TV channels, cinemas will sometimes play subtitled versions of children's movies as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n=====United Kingdom=====\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the vast majority of foreign language films are subtitled, although mostly animated films are dubbed in English.  These usually originate from [[North America]], as opposed to being dubbed locally. Foreign language serials shown on BBC Four are subtitled into English (although open subtitles are dropped during dialogues with English language segments already).  There have, however, been notable examples of films and TV programmes successfully dubbed in the UK, such as the Japanese ''[[Monkey (TV series)|Monkey]]'' and French ''[[The Magic Roundabout|Magic Roundabout]]'' series.  When airing films on television, channels in the UK often choose subtitling over dubbing, even if a dubbing in English exists. It is also a fairly common practice for animation aimed at [[Preschool education|preschool]] children to be re-dubbed with British voice actors replacing the original voices, such as Spin Master Entertainment's [[PAW Patrol]] series, although this is not done with shows aimed at older audiences.  The off-screen narrated portions of some programmes and reality shows that originate from North America are also redone with British English voices.  \n\nSome animated films and TV programmes are also dubbed into [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\n[[Hinterland (TV series)|Hinterland]] displays a not so common example of a bilingual production. Each scene is filmed twice, in the English and Welsh languages, apart from a few scenes where Welsh with subtitles is used for the English version.<ref>{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jul/30/hinterland-tv-noir-wales |title=Hinterland \u2013 the TV noir so good they made it twice |first=Stephen |last=Moss |date=30 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=[[London]] |access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Nordic countries=====\nIn the [[Nordic countries]], dubbing is used only in animated features (except [[adult animated]] features) and other films for younger audiences. Some cinemas in the major cities may also screen the original version, usually as the last showing of the day, or in a smaller auditorium in a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]].\n\nIn television programs with off-screen narration, both the original audio and on-screen voices are usually subtitled in their native languages.\n\nThe Nordic countries are often treated as a common market issuing [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases with original audio and user choosable subtitle options in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. The covers often have text in all four languages as well, but are sometimes unique for each country. Some releases may include other European language audio and/or subtitles (i.e. German, Greek, Hungarian or Italian). Children's films typically have Nordic audio tracks in all four languages, as well as original audio in most cases.\n\nIn [[Finland]], the dubbed version from [[Sweden]] may also be available at certain cinemas for children of the 5% Swedish-speaking minority, but only in cities or towns with a significant percentage of Swedish speakers. Most [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases usually only have the original audio, except for children's films, which have both Finnish and Swedish language tracks, in addition to the original audio and subtitles in both languages.\n\nIn Finnish movie theaters, films for adult audiences have both Finnish and Swedish subtitles, the Finnish printed in basic font and the Swedish printed below the Finnish in a cursive font. In the early ages of television, foreign TV shows and movies were voiced by narrator in Finland. Later, subtitles became a practice on Finnish television. Dubbing of films other than children's films is unpopular in Finland, as in many other countries. A good example is ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''. While the original version was well-received, the Finnish-dubbed version received poor reviews, with some critics even calling it a disaster.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} On the other hand, many dubs of [[Disney]] animated features have been well-received, both critically and by the public.\n\nIn [[Iceland]], the dubbed version of film and TV is usually [[Danish language|Danish]] with some translated into [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. [[LazyTown]], an Icelandic TV show originally broadcast in English, was dubbed into Icelandic, amongst thirty-two other languages, and it remains the TV show to have been dubbed into the most languages.\n\n====General films and programming====\nIn the [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] language-speaking markets of [[Europe]], almost all foreign films and television shows are dubbed (the exception being the majority of theatrical releases of adult-audience movies in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]] and [[Turkey]] and high-profile videos in Russia). There are few opportunities to watch foreign movies in their original versions. In [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], even in the largest cities, there are few cinemas that screen original versions with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], or without any translation. However, digital [[pay-TV]] programming is often available in the original language, including the latest movies. Prior to the rise of DVDs, which in these countries are mostly issued with multi-language audio tracks, original-language films (those in languages other than the country's official language) were rare, whether in theaters, on TV, or on home video, and subtitled versions were considered a product for small [[niche market]]s such as intellectual or [[art film]]s.\n\n\n\n\n=====France=====\nIn [[France]], movies and TV series are, except purely arthouse films, usually released in the dubbed French-language version. The original-language version of the film with French subtitles is released in designated theaters which show only subtitled versions or both versions are shown at different times or split screenings between both versions. However, dubbing is the norm and subtitling is only for niche audience and movies with subtitles are usually very small arthouse films with very limited commercial prospects for pay and free TV airings and also home entertainment (VOD, DVD). Dubbing in the French Language is thus absolutely essential for any sale to be made.\n\nSince the digitalization of over-the-air television broadcasters, both versions have been offered to the customer simultaneously.  By default, foreign films and TV programmes shown on television are dubbed into French on a channel's main audio feed. However, with the advent of digital television, viewers can access the original language feed for some programmes, as well as matching subtitles.  In addition, the TV network ARTE has a French-language track on its main audio feed as well as a German-language track.  \n \nMost movies are released nationwide in dubbed version and subtitled versions where available with the exception of very limited often micro-budget arthouse productions that do stem come from the \"hollywood movie production\" machine which are exclusively arthouse films and not dubbed at the time of their theatrical release.\n\nTheaters showing these kind of movies or also showing commercial films in the original-language version with French subtitles are very rare outside of the big cities and most of them are located in [[Paris]] which has the most \"cinephile\" cinemas in France. Often these \"niche\" films are only released in [[Paris]] region.\n\nA theater showing subtitled versions of original language movies are typically well known for this and will advertise this also on the poster advising moviegoers that the film is shown in an original-language version (usually abbreviated VO [''version originale''] or VOST [''version originale sous-titr\u00e9e'']), as opposed to VF [''version fran\u00e7aise''], the latter then becoming what is known and used also in the neighboring countries like Belgium or Switzerland, as the \"FRENCH LANGUAGE VERSION\" of the film.)\n\nBecause the alterations made to the original film are so profound, making it no longer viewable or understandable for audiences that speak the language the film was originally shot in, the final dubbed version is called the \"French-language version\", as opposed to the use of subtitles which leave the film in its original state.\nThe choice to dub or not at the time of theatrical release is a decision made by the distributor releasing the film based upon their recoupment strategy for the film and their prognosis of the commercial prospects. Given the fact that a dub is needed for home entertainment and TV sales, only very small arthouse films are never dubbed.\nOnly a very small percentage (according to the official institute CNC in France only 16.4% of all ticket-sales were for movies watched in the original-language version with subtitles) and this is counting Blockbusters and others shown in their original-language version with subtitles and the small number of films that are never dubbed.\nVoice actors that have dubbed for celebrities in the European French language can be viewed here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

In [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] fascist Italy, release of movies in foreign languages was banned for political reasons. Rome is the principal base of the dubbing industry, where major productions such as movies, drama, documentaries and some cartoons are dubbed. However, dubbing in Milan is mostly of cartoons and some minor productions. Practically every foreign film (mostly American ones) of every genre, for children or adults, as well as TV shows, are dubbed into Italian. In big cities, original-version movies can also be seen in some theaters but it is not so common. Subtitles may be available on [[Late night television|late-night programs]] on mainstream TV channels, and on pay-TV all movies are available in the original language with Italian subtitles, many shows featuring their original [[soundtrack]]s.\n\nEarly in their careers, actors such as [[Alberto Sordi]] or [[Nino Manfredi]] worked extensively as dubbing actors. At one point, common practice in Italian cinema was to shoot scenes [[MOS (filmmaking)|MOS]] (motor only sync or motor only shot) and dub the dialogue in post-production. A notable example of this practice is ''[[The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly]]'', in which all actors had to dub in their own voices.\n\nVideo games are generally either dubbed into Italian (for instance [[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]] saga, [[Halo (series)|Halo]] or [[Harry Potter (video games)|Harry Potter]] series etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Italian language.\n\nA list of the voice actors that have dubbed for celebrities in Italian can be enlisted here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Some dubbing actors have achieved popularity for their voices, such as [[Constantino Romero]] (who dubs [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Darth Vader]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s [[The Terminator|Terminator]], among others) and [[\u00d3scar Mu\u00f1oz (filmmaking)|\u00d3scar Mu\u00f1oz]] (the official European Spanish dub-over voice artist for [[Elijah Wood]] and [[Hayden Christensen]]). Currently, with the spread of [[digital terrestrial television]], viewers can choose between the original and the dubbed soundtracks for most movies and television.\n\nIn some communities such as [[Catalonia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], some foreign programs are also dubbed into their own languages, different from European Spanish. Films from \nthe Spanish-speaking America shown in these communities are shown in their original language, while strong regional accents (from the Spanish-speaking America or from Spain) may be subtitled in news and documentaries.\n\n=====Germany, Austria and Switzerland=====\nThe [[German language|Germanophone]] dubbing market is the largest in Europe. Germany has the most foreign-movie-dubbing studios per capita and per given area in the world and according to the German newspaper [[Die Welt]] 52% of all voice actors currently work in the German dubbing industry. In Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], practically all films, shows, television series and foreign [[soap opera]]s are shown in dubbed versions created for the German market. However, in some of Switzerland's towns and cities (particularly along the language-borders), subtitled versions are common. Dubbing films is a traditional and common practice in German-speaking Europe, since subtitles are not accepted and used as much as in other European countries. According to a European study, Austria is the country with the highest rejection rate (more than 70 percent) of subtitles, followed by Italy, Spain and Germany.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\nIn German-speaking markets, [[PC game|computer]] and video games feature German text menus and are dubbed into the German language if speaking parts exist.\n\nIn recent years, Swiss and Austrian television stations have been showing increasing numbers of movies, series and TV-programmes in \"dual sound,\" which means the viewer can choose between the original language (e.g. English) and the language of the channel (German, French or Italian, according to the location).\n\nAlthough German-speaking [[voice actor]]s play only a secondary role, they are still notable for providing familiar voices to well-known actors. Famous foreign actors are known and recognised for their [[German language|German]] voice, and the German audience is used to them, so dubbing is also a matter of authenticity. However, in larger cities, there are theaters where movies can be seen in their original versions, as [[English language|English]] has become somewhat more popular among young educated viewers. On German [[mainstream]] television, films are never broadcast with subtitles, but pay-per-view programming is often available in the original language. Subtitled niche and [[art film]]s are sometimes aired on smaller networks.\n\nGerman-dubbed versions sometimes diverge greatly from the original, especially in adding humorous elements absent from the original. In extreme cases, such as ''[[The Persuaders!]]'', the German-dubbed version was more successful than the English original. Often, translation adds [[sexually explicit]] gags the U.S. versions might not be allowed to use. For example, in ''[[Bewitched (2005 film)|Bewitched]]'', the translators changed ''\"The [[Door hanger|Do Not Disturb sign]] will hang on the door tonight\"'' to ''\"The only hanging thing tonight will be the Do Not Disturb sign\"''.\n\nSome movies dubbed in Austria diverge from the German Standard version in addressing other people but only when the movies are dubbed into certain Austrian dialect versions. (Mr. and Mrs. are translated into Herr and Frau which is usually not translated in order to be in lip-sync).\nSometimes even English pronounced first names are translated and are pronounced into the correct German equivalent (English name \"Bert\" became Southern German pronounced name \"Bertl\" which is an abbreviation for any name either beginning or even ending with \"bert\", e.g. \"Berthold\" or \"Albert\".)\n\nSome movies dubbed before [[German reunification|reunification]] exist in different versions for the [[East Germany|east]] and the [[West Germany|west]]. They use different translations, and often differ in the style of dubbing.\n\nSome of the well-known German dubbing voice artists are listed below.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Czech dubbing was also extensively used in the broadcast of Slovak television channels, but since 2008 Slovak language laws require any newer shows (understood as the first television broadcast in Slovakia) to be provided with Slovak localisation (dubbing or subtitles); since then, television broadcasts of films, TV series and cartoons have been dubbed into Slovak.\n\n=====Hungary=====\n<!-- Please do not change this section to Romanian because the sources in this section are directly related to Hungary.-->\nIn [[Hungary]], dubbing is almost universally common. Almost every foreign movie or TV show released in Hungary is dubbed into Hungarian.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://matadornetwork.com/abroad/9-culture-shocks-americans-will-hungary/ |title=9 culture shocks Americans will have in Hungary}}</ref> The history of dubbing dates back to the 1950s, when the country was still under communist rule.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.masterfilm.hu/services |title=Masterfilm :: Services}}</ref> One of the most iconic Hungarian dubs was of the American cartoon ''[[The Flintstones]]'', with a local translation by [[J\u00f3zsef Romh\u00e1nyi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sherlockian-sherlock.com/the-dubbed-versions-of-sherlock-holmes.php |title=Dubbed versions Sherlock Holmes, dubbing, hungarian voices}}</ref> The Internetes Szinkron Adatb\u00e1zis (ISzDB) is the largest Hungarian database for film dubs, with information for many live action and animated films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iszdb.hu |title=ISzDb - Internetes Szinkron Adatb\u00e1zis}}</ref> On page 59 of the Eurobarometer, 84% of Hungarians said that they prefer dubbing over subtitles.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\" />\n\nIn the [[Socialism|socialist]] era, every film was dubbed with professional and mostly popular actors. Care was taken to make sure the same voice actor would lend his voice to the same original actor. In the early 1990s, as cinemas tried to keep up with showing newly released films, subtitling became dominant in the cinema. This, in turn, forced TV channels to make their own cheap versions of dubbed soundtracks for the movies they presented, resulting in a constant degrading of dubbing quality. Once this became customary, cinema distributors resumed the habit of dubbing for popular productions, presenting them in a below-average quality. However, every feature is presented with the original soundtrack in at least one cinema in large towns and cities.\n\nHowever, in Hungary, most documentary films and series (for example, those on [[Discovery Channel]], [[National Geographic Channel]]) are made with [[Voice-over|voiceovers]]. Some old movies and series, or ones that provide non-translatable jokes and conversations (for example, the ''[[Mr. Bean]]'' television series), are shown only with subtitles.\n\nThere is a more recent problem arising from dubbing included on DVD releases. Many generations have grown up with an original (and, by current technological standards, outdated) soundtrack, which is either technologically (mono or bad quality stereo sound) or legally (expired soundtrack license) unsuitable for a DVD release. Many original features are released on DVD with a new soundtrack, which in some cases proves to be extremely unpopular, thus forcing DVD producers to include the original soundtrack. In some rare cases, the Hungarian soundtrack is left out altogether. This happens notably with Warner Home Video Hungary, which ignored the existence of Hungarian soundtracks completely, as they did not want to pay the licenses for the soundtracks to be included on their new DVD releases, which appear with improved picture quality, but very poor subtitling.\n\n=====Poland=====\n{{essay|section|date=October 2016}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nIn [[Poland]], cinema releases for general audiences are almost exclusively subtitled, with the exception of children's movies, and television screenings of movies, as well as made-for-TV shows. These are usually shown with voice-over, where a voice talent reads a translation over the original soundtrack. This method, called \"juxtareading,\" is similar to the so-called [[Gavrilov translation]] in Russia, with one difference\u2014all dialogues are voiced by one off-screen reader ({{lang-pl|lektor}}), preferably with a deep and neutral voice which does not interfere with the pitch of voice of the original speakers in the background. To some extent, it resembles live translation. Certain highly qualified voice talents are traditionally assigned to particular kinds of production, such as action or drama. Standard dubbing is not widely popular with most audiences, with the exception of cartoons and children's shows, which are dubbed also for TV releases.\n\nIt is claimed that, until around 1951, there were no revoiced foreign movies available in Poland. Instead, they were exclusively subtitled in Polish.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das kulturelle Leben der Deutschen in Niederschlesien unter polnischer Verwaltung. 1947-1958|first=Bernhard|last=Grund|publisher=Bundesministerium f\u00fcr gesamtdeutsche Fragen|place=Bonn und Berlin|date=1967|series=Bonner Berichte aus Mittel- und Ostdeutschland|page=119}}</ref>\n\nPoland's dubbing traditions began between the two world wars. In 1931, among the first movies dubbed into Polish were ''[[Dangerous Curves (1929 film)|Dangerous Curves]]'' (1929), ''[[The Dance of Life]]'' (1929), ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' (1930), and ''[[Darling of the Gods]]'' (1930). In 1949, the first dubbing studio opened in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. The first film dubbed that year was ''Russkiy Vopros'' (filmed 1948).\n\nPolish dubbing in the first post-war years suffered from poor synchronisation. Polish dialogues were not always audible and the cinema equipment of that time often made films sound less clear than they were. In the 1950s, Polish publicists discussed the quality of Polish versions of foreign movies.\n\nThe number of dubbed movies and the quality improved. Polish dubbing had a golden age between the 1960s and the 1980s. Approximately a third of foreign movies screened in cinemas were dubbed. The \"Polish dubbing school\" was known for its high quality. In that time, Poland had some of the best dubbing in the world. The person who initiated high-quality dubbing versions was director Zofia Dybowska-Aleksandrowicz. In that time, dubbing in Poland was very popular. Polish television dubbed popular films and TV series such as ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]''; ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', ''[[Forsyte Saga]]'', ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', ''[[I, Claudius]]'', ''[[I'll Take Manhattan (miniseries)|I'll Take Manhattan]]'', and ''[[Peter the Great (TV series)|Peter the Great]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s, due to budget cuts, state-run TV saved on tapes by voicing films over live during transmission.\n\nOverall, during 1948\u20131998, almost 1,000 films were dubbed in Polish. In the 1990s, dubbing films and TV series continued, although often also for one emission only.\n\nIn 1995, [[Canal+]] was launched in Poland. In its first years, it dubbed 30% of its schedule dubbing popular films and TV series, one of the best-known and popular dubbings was that of ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'', but this proved unsuccessful.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151222233455/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119215016517556740 On Polish TV, Desperate Wives Sound Like Guys], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 12 October 2007</ref> It stopped dubbing films in 1999, although many people supported the idea of dubbing and bought the access only for dubbing versions of foreign productions. In the 1990s, dubbing was done by the television channel known as [[Wizja Jeden]]. They mainly dubbed [[BBC]] productions such as ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]''. Wizja Jeden was closed in 2001. In the same year, TVP stopped dubbing the TV series ''[[Frasier]]'', although that dubbing was very popular.\n\nCurrently, dubbing of films and TV series for teenagers is made by Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. One of the major breakthroughs in dubbing was the Polish release of ''Shrek'', which contained many references to local culture and Polish humour. Since then, people seem to have grown to like dubbed versions more, and pay more attention to the dubbing actors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} However, this seems to be the case only with animated films, as live-action dubbing is still considered a bad practice. In the case of [[DVD|DVD releases]], most discs contain both the original soundtrack and subtitles, and either voice over or dubbed Polish track. The dubbed version is, in most cases, the one from the theater release, while voice-over is provided for movies that were only subtitled in theaters.\n\nSince theatrical release of ''The Avengers'' in May 2012, Walt Disney Company Polska dubs all films for cinema releases. Also in 2012, [[United International Pictures]] Polska dubbed ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', while Forum Film Polska \u2013 former distributor of Disney's films \u2013 decided to dub ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', along with its [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|two]] [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|sequels]]. However, when a dub is produced but the film's target audience is not exclusively children, both dubbed and subtitled versions are usually available in movie theaters. The dubbed versions are more commonly shown in morning and early afternoon hours, with the subtitled version dominating in the evening. Both can be available in parallel at similar hours in multiplexes.\n\n=====Russia=====\n[[Russia]]n television is generally dubbed, but in the cases using voice-over dub technique with only a couple of voice actors, with the original speech still audible underneath. In the [[Soviet Union]], most foreign movies to be officially released were dubbed. Voice-over dub was invented in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1980s when with the fall of the regime, many popular foreign movies, previously forbidden, or at least questionable under communist rule, started to flood in, in the form of low-quality home-copied videos. Being unofficial releases, they were dubbed in a very primitive way. For example, the translator spoke the text directly over the audio of a video being copied, using primitive equipment.\n\nThe quality of the resulting dub was very low, the translated phrases were off-sync, interfering with the original voices, background sounds leaked into the track, translation was inaccurate and, most importantly, all dub voices were made by a single person who usually lacked the intonation of the original, making comprehension of some scenes quite difficult. This method of translation exerted a strong influence on Russian pop culture. Voices of translators became recognizable for generations.\n\nIn modern Russia, the overdubbing technique is still used in many cases, although with vastly improved quality, and now with multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices. Video games are generally either dubbed into Russian (such as the ''Legend of Spyro'' trilogy, the ''Skylanders'' series, the ''Assassin's Creed'' saga, the ''Halo'' series, the ''Harry Potter'' series, etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Russian language.\n\nReleases of cinemas are almost always dubbed in the Russian language. On television series are shown as a dubbed translation and offscreen. Subtitles are not used at all.\n\n=====Ukraine=====\nIn [[Ukraine]], since 2006 cinema releases are almost always dubbed into Ukrainian with the overdubbing technique and multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices with a small percent of art-house/documentaries shown in the original language with Ukrainian subtitles. For television, TV channels usually release movies and TV-shows with a Ukrainian voiceover, although certain high-profile films and TV shows are dubbed rather than voice-overe'ed.\n\nIn the past Russian-language films, TV series, cartoons, animated series and TV programs were usually not dubbed but were shown with the original audio with Ukrainian subtitles. However, this practise has been slowly abandoned since the late 2010s: all children's films and cartoons regardless of the original language (including Russian) are always dubbed into Ukrainian; example of the first Russian cartoons dubbed into Ukrainian for the cinematic-release is [[The Snow Queen 2]] (2015), [[A Warrior's Tail]] (2015), Volki i Ovtsy: Be-e-e-zumnoe prevrashenie (2016), Ivan Tsarevich i Seryy Volk 3 (2016), Bremenskie razboyniki (2016), [[The Snow Queen 3: Fire and Ice|The Snow Queen 3: Fire and Ice (2017)]], [[Fantastic Journey to OZ]] (2017), Fixies: Top Secret (2017) etc.; the same trend is seen among Russian language feature films for adults, with the first such films dubbed into Ukrainian including [[Battle for Sevastopol|Battle for Sevastopol (2015)]], [[Hardcore Henry|Hardcore Henry (2016)]], [[The Duelist (2016 film)|The Duelist (2016)]].\n\n=====Latvia and Lithuania=====\nIn [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]], only children's movies get dubbed in the cinema, while many live-action movies for an older audience use voice-over. In recent years however, many cartoons have been dubbed into Latvian and Lithuanian for TV. But some other kids shows, like ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', use the voice-over.\n\n===Americas===\n====United States and English-speaking Canada====\nIn the United States and English-speaking Canada, [[live-action]] foreign films are usually shown in theaters with their original languages and English subtitles. It is because live-action dubbed movies rarely did well in United States box office since the 1980s. The 1982 United States theatrical release of Wolfgang Peterson's ''[[Das Boot]]'' was the last major release to go out in both original and English-dubbed versions, and the film's original version actually grossed much higher than the English-dubbed version.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/1999/08/editorial-life-isnt-beautiful-anymore-its-dubbed-82123/|title=EDITORIAL: Life Isn't Beautiful Anymore, it's Dubbed|last=Indiewire|date=23 August 1999|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html?gwh=5B7FDE5A22B394D810DA99A95EFCDECB&gwt=pay|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805152511/https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html?gwh=5B7FDE5A22B394D810DA99A95EFCDECB&gwt=pay|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 August 2018|title=Will Dubbing Fly in the U.S.?

The exceptions to this practice are either when an English dub has not been produced for the program (usually in the case of feature films) or when the program is being presented by a network that places importance on presenting it in its original format (as was the case when [[Turner Classic Movies]] aired several of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s works, which were presented both dubbed and subtitled). Most [[anime]] DVDs contain options for original Japanese, Japanese with subtitles, and English-dubbed, except for a handful of series that have been heavily edited or [[Americanized|Americanised]]. In addition, Disney has a policy that makes its directors undergo stages to perfect alignment of certain lip movements so the movie looks believable.\n\nIn addition, a small number of British films have been re-dubbed when released in the United States, due to the usage of dialects which Americans are not familiar with (for example, ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]'' and ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''). However, British children's shows (such as ''[[Bob the Builder]]'') are always re-dubbed with American voice actors in order to make the series more understandable for American children. Conversely, British programs shown in Canada are not re-dubbed.\n\nSome television shows shown in the US have Spanish dubs.  These are accessible though the SAP (secondary audio program) function of the television unit.\n\n====Spanish-speaking countries====\nFor Spanish-speaking countries, all foreign-language programs, films, cartoons and documentaries shown on free-to-air TV networks are dubbed into [[Standard Spanish]], while broadcasts on [[Cable television|cable]] and [[Satellite television|satellite]] pan-regional channels are either dubbed or subtitled. In theaters, children's movies and most blockbuster films are dubbed into Standard Spanish or [[Mexican Spanish]], and are sometimes further dubbed into regional dialects of Spanish where they are released.\n\n====Mexico====\nIn [[Mexico]], by law, films shown in theaters must be shown in their original version. Films in languages other than Spanish are usually subtitled. Only educational documentaries and movies rated for children, as well as some movies that are expected to have a wide audience (for example, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' or ''[[Marvel's The Avengers|The Avengers]]'') may be dubbed, but this is not compulsory, and some animated films are shown in theaters in both dubbed and subtitled versions (for instance, some [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] productions). Nonetheless, a recent trend in several cinemas is to offer the dubbed versions only, with a stark decrease in the showing of the original ones.\n\nDubbing must be made in Mexico by Mexican nationals or foreigners residing in Mexico.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/103.pdf |title=Ley Federal de Cinematograf\u00eda |language=Spanish |trans-title=Federal Law of Filmmaking |publisher=C\u00e1mara de Diputados |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=22 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722125937/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/103.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011  }}</ref> Still, several programs that are shown on pay TV are dubbed in other countries like [[Venezuela]], [[Chile]] or [[Colombia]].\n\nMost movies released on DVD feature [[Standard Spanish|neutral Spanish]] as a language option, and sometimes feature a specific dub for Mexican audiences (for example, ''Rio''). Foreign programs are dubbed on [[broadcast television systems|broadcast TV]], while on [[pay TV]] most shows and movies are subtitled. In a similar way to cinemas, in the last few years many channels on pay TV have begun to broadcast programs and films only in their dubbed version.\n\nDubbing became very popular in the 1990s with the rise in popularity of anime in Mexico. Some voice actors have become celebrities and are always identified with specific characters, such as [[Mario Casta\u00f1eda]] (who became popular by dubbing [[Goku]] in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'') or [[Humberto V\u00e9lez]] (who dubbed [[Homer Simpson]] in the first 15 seasons of ''[[The Simpsons]]'').\n\nThe popularity of pay TV has allowed people to view several series in their original language rather than dubbed. Dubbing has been criticised for the use of TV or movie stars as voice actors (such as [[Ricky Martin]] in Disney's ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'', or [[Eugenio Derbez]] in DreamWorks' ''Shrek''), or for the incorrect use of local popular culture that sometimes creates unintentional jokes or breaks the feeling of the original work (such as translating [[Sheldon Cooper]]'s \"Bazinga!\" to \"\u00a1Vacil\u00f3n!\").\n\nSeveral video games have been dubbed into neutral Spanish, rather than European Spanish, in Mexico (such as the ''Gears of War'' series, ''Halo 3'', ''Infamous 2'' and others). [[Sony]] recently announced that more games (such as ''God of War: Ascension'') will be dubbed into neutral Spanish.\n\n====Peru====\nIn [[Peru]], all foreign series, movies, and animated programming are shown dubbed in Latin American Spanish, with dubs imported from Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela on terrestrial and pay-television. Most movies intended for kids are being offered as dub-only movies, while most films aimed at older audiences are being offered dubbed and subtitled in Spanish. Also, at most theaters, kids films (on rare occasions) subtitled are commonly shown at nighttime. Most subtitled Pay-TV channels show both dubbed and subtitled version of every film they broadcast, being offered with a separate subtitle track and a second audio track in English. There is an increase of people preferring subtitle films and series rather than dubbed starting the late-2000s, as Peruvians viewers tend to get used to their original version.\n\nPeru used to do not produce their own dubs since dubbing studios never existed in that country until 2016, when the company \"Big Bang Films\" started to dub movies and series, however, since 2014 a group of dubbing actors created a group called \"Torre A Doblaje\", who is a group of actors who gives dubbing and locution service.\n\n====Brazil====\nIn [[Brazil]], foreign programs are invariably dubbed into [[Brazilian Portuguese]] on [[free to air TV]], with only a few exceptions. Films shown at cinemas are generally offered with both subtitled and dubbed versions, with dubbing frequently being the only choice for children's movies. Subtitling was primarily for adult audience movies until 2012. Since then, dubbed versions also became available for all ages. As a result, in recent years, more cinemas have opened in Brazil, attracting new audiences to the cinema who prefer dubbing. According to a [[Datafolha]] survey, 56% of Brazilian movie theaters' audience prefer to watch dubbed movies.<ref>http://revistaepoca.globo.com/cultura/noticia/2012/06/dublagem-venceu-legendas.html</ref> Most of the dubbing studios in Brazil is in the cities of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140319091221/http://ne10.uol.com.br/canal/cultura/noticia/2012/05/27/cresce-preferencia-por-filmes-dublados-nos-cinemas-brasileiros-344927.php Cresce prefer\u00eancia por filmes dublados nos cinemas brasileiros (in Portuguese)] Ne10, 27 May 2012.

By the end of the 1950s, most of the movies, TV series and cartoons on television in Brazil were shown in its original sound and subtitles. However, in 1962, a decree of President [[J\u00e2nio Quadros]] ruled that all foreign productions on television should be dubbed. This measure boosted the growth of dubbing in Brazil, and has led to several dubbing studios since then.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/cinema-e-tv/quando-surgiu-a-dublagem-no-brasil-e-no-mundo/ | title=Quando surgiu a dublagem no Brasil e no mundo?}}</ref> The biggest dubbing studio in Brazil was [[Herbert Richers]], headquartered in [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]] and closed in 2009, At its peak in the 80s and 90s, the Herbert Richers studios dubbed about 70% of the productions shown in Brazilian cinemas.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://super.abril.com.br/mundo-estranho/quem-e-herbert-richers/ |title = Quem \u00e9 Herbert Richers?}}</ref>\n\nIn the 90's, with Saint Seiya, Dragon Ball and other anime shows becoming popular in Brazilian TV's, the voice actors and the dubbing career gained a higher space in Brazilian culture. Actors like [[Hermes Baroli]] (Brazilian dubber of [[Pegasus Seiya]], in ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' and actors like [[Ashton Kutcher]]), [[Marco Ribeiro]] (Brazilian dubber of many actors like [[Tom Hanks]], [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]], and [[Yusuke Urameshi]] from the anime ''[[Yu Yu Hakusho]]'') and [[Wendel Bezerra]] (Brazilian dubber of [[Goku]] in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' and [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] in ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'') are recognised for their most notable roles.\n\nPay TV commonly offers both dubbed and subtitled movies, with statistics showing that dubbed versions are becoming predominant.<ref>[http://oglobo.globo.com/revista-da-tv/dublagem-em-canais-de-tv-paga-provoca-polemica-3262532 Dublagem em canais de TV paga provoca pol\u00eamica (in Portuguese)] O Globo, 20 November 2011. Retrieved 17 August 2012.</ref> Most [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases usually feature Portuguese, Spanish, and the original audio along with subtitles in native languages. Most video games are dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese rather than having European Portuguese dubs alone. Games such as ''[[Halo 3]]'', ''[[God of War: Ascension]]'', ''[[inFamous 2]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'', ''[[Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and others are dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese. This is because despite the dropping of the dubbing law in Portugal in 1994, most companies in that country use the Brazilian Portuguese because of traditional usage during the days of the dubbing rule, along with these dubbings being more marketable than European Portuguese.\n\nA list that showcases Brazilian Portuguese voice artists that dub for actors and actresses are displayed here.

They speak with a mixed accent, they pronounce /\u025b\u0303/ with a Parisian accent, but they pronounce \"\u00e2\" and \"\u00ea\" with a Quebec accent: ''gr\u00e2ce'' [\u0261\u0281\u0251\u02d0s] and ''\u00eatre'' [\u025b\u02d0t\u0281\u0325]. Occasionally, the dubbing of a series or a movie, such as ''The Simpsons'', is made using the more widely spoken ''[[joual]]'' variety of Quebec French. Dubbing has the advantage of making children's films and TV series more comprehensible to younger audiences. However, many [[bilingual]] Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois prefer subtitling, since they would understand some or all of the original audio. In addition, all films are shown in English, as well in certain theaters (especially in major cities and English-speaking areas such as the [[West Island]]), and some theatres, such as the Scotiabank Cinema [[Montreal]], show only movies in English. Most American television series are only available in English on [[DVD]], or on English-language channels, but some of the more popular ones have French dubs shown on mainstream networks, and are released in French on DVD as well, sometimes separately from an English-only version.\n\nFormerly, all French-language dubbed films in Quebec were imported from France and some still are. Such a practice was criticised by former politician [[Mario Dumont]] after he took his children to see the [[Standard French|Parisian French]] dub of ''Shrek the Third'', which Dumont found incomprehensible.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/quebec-pressing-hollywood-to-justify-lack-of-movie-dubbing/article1352554/ Quebec pressing Hollywood to justify lack of movie dubbing], The Canadian Press, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 26 May 2008</ref> After his complaints and a proposed bill, ''[[Bee Movie]]'', the film from [[DreamWorks Animation]], was dubbed in Quebec, making it the studio's first animated film to have a Quebec French dub, as all DreamWorks Animation films had previously been dubbed in France.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dr\u00f4le d'abeille (v.o.a) Bee Movie |url=http://doublage.qc.ca/showMovie.php?id=1981 |work=Doublage.qc.ca |publisher=idgrafix |accessdate=30 July 2012 |author=Doublage.qc.ca |language=French}}</ref> In terms of Disney, the first Disney animated film to be dubbed in Quebec was ''Oliver and Company.'' The Disney Renaissance films were also dubbed in Quebec except for ''The Rescuers Down Under'', ''Beauty and the Beast'', and ''The Lion King''.\n\nIn addition, because Canadian viewers usually find Quebec French more comprehensible than other dialects of the language, some older film series that had the French-language versions of previous installments dubbed in France have had later ones dubbed in Quebec, often creating inconsistencies within the French version of the series' canon. [[Lucasfilm]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' series are examples. Both series had films released in the 1970s and 1980s, with no Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French dubbed versions; instead, the Parisian French versions, with altered character and object names and terms, were distributed in the province. However, later films in both series released 1999 and later were dubbed in Quebec, using different voice actors and \"reversing\" name changes made in France's dubbings due to the change in studio.\n\n===Asia===\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2013}}\n\n====China====\nChina has a long tradition of dubbing foreign films into [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], starting in the 1930s. While during the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] era Western motion pictures may have been imported and dubbed into Chinese, since 1950 [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet movies]], dubbed primarily in Shanghai, became the main import.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|1987|p=40}}</ref> Beginning in the late 1970s, in addition to films, popular TV series from the United States, Japan, Brazil, and Mexico were also dubbed. The [[Shanghai]] Film Dubbing Studio has been the most well-known studio in the film dubbing industry in China. In order to generate high-quality products, they divide each film into short segments, each one lasting only a few minutes, and then work on the segments one-by-one. In addition to the correct meaning in translation, they make tremendous effort to match the lips of the actors to the dialogue. As a result, the dubbing in these films generally is not readily detected. The cast of dubbers is acknowledged at the end of a dubbed film. Several dubbing actors and actresses of the Shanghai Film Dubbing Studio have become well-known celebrities, such as Qiu Yuefeng, Bi Ke, Li Zi, and Liu Guangning. In recent years, however, especially in the larger cities on the east and south coasts, it has become increasingly common for movie theaters to show subtitled versions with the original soundtracks intact.\n\nMotion pictures are also dubbed into the languages of some of China's [[Autonomous administrative divisions of China|autonomous regions]]. Notably, the Translation Department of the [[Tibetan Autonomous Region]] Movie Company (\u897f\u85cf\u81ea\u6cbb\u533a\u7535\u5f71\u516c\u53f8\u8bd1\u5236\u79d1)<ref name=humes20131122>[http://www.bruce-humes.com/?p=9736 Confucius the Movie: China Flop Dubbed at the State\u2019s Expense for Tibetan Movie-goers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130085415/http://www.bruce-humes.com/?p=9736 |date=30 November 2013 }}, 22 November 2013</ref> has been dubbing movies into the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]] since the 1960s.

Until the mid-1990s, the major national [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial channels]] both dubbed and subtitled all foreign programs and films and, for some popular programs, the original voices were offered in [[second audio program]]. Gradually, however, both terrestrial and cable channels stopped dubbing for [[prime time]] U.S. shows and films, while subtitling continued.\n\nIn the 2000s, the dubbing practice has differed depending on the nature and origin of the program. Animations, children's shows and some educational programs on PTS are mostly dubbed. English live-action movies and shows are not dubbed in theaters or on television. Japanese TV dramas are no longer dubbed, while [[Korean language|Korean]] dramas, [[Hong Kong]] dramas and dramas from other Asian countries are still often dubbed. Korean variety shows are not dubbed. Japanese and Korean films on Asian movie channels are still dubbed. In theaters, most foreign films are not dubbed, while animated films and some films meant for children offer a dubbed version. Hong Kong live-action films have a long tradition of being dubbed into Mandarin, while more famous films offer a [[Cantonese]] version.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nIn [[Hong Kong]], foreign television programmes, except for English-language and Mandarin television programmes, are dubbed in Cantonese. English-language and Mandarin programmes are generally shown in their original with subtitles. Foreign films, such as most live-action and animated films (such as anime and Disney), are usually dubbed in Cantonese. However most cinemas also offer subtitled versions of English-language films.\n\nFor the most part, foreign films and TV programmes, both live-action and animated, are generally dubbed in both Mandarin and Cantonese. For example, in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film series, Elijah Wood's character [[Frodo Baggins]] was dubbed into Mandarin by [[Jiang Guangtao]] for China and Taiwan. For the Cantonese localisation, there were actually two dubs for Hong Kong and [[Macau]]. The first Cantonese dub, he was voiced by Leung Wai Tak, with a second Cantonese dub released, he was voiced by Bosco Tang.\n\nA list for Mandarin and Cantonese voice artists that dub for actors are shown here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

In programs aimed at teenagers and adults, dubbing is rarely considered for translation, not only because of its high costs, but also because the audience is mainly multi-lingual. Most viewers in Israel speak at least one European language in addition to Hebrew, and a large part of the audience also speaks [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Therefore, most viewers prefer to hear the original soundtrack, aided by Hebrew subtitles. Another problem is that dubbing does not allow for translation into two different languages simultaneously, as is often the case of Israeli television channels that use subtitles in Hebrew and another language (like [[Russian language|Russian]]) simultaneously.\n\n====Japan====\nIn Japan, many television programs appear on Japanese television subtitled or dubbed if they are intended for children. When the American film ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]'' was released in Japan in 1931, subtitles became the mainstream method of translating TV programs and films in Japan. Later, around the 1950s, foreign television programs and films began to be shown dubbed in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] on television. The first ones to be dubbed into Japanese were [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|the 1940s Superman cartoons]] in 1955.\n\nDue to the lack of video software for domestic television, video software was imported from abroad. When the television program was shown on television, it was mostly dubbed. There was a character limit for a small TV screen at a lower resolution, and this method was not suitable for the poor elderly and illiterate eye, as was audio dubbing. Presently, TV shows and movies (both those aimed at all ages and adults-only) are shown dubbed with the original language and Japanese subtitles, while providing the original language option when the same film is released on [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]]. Laserdisc releases of Hollywood films were almost always subtitled.\n\nAdult cartoons such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' are shown dubbed in Japanese on the [[WOWOW]] TV channel. ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut]]'' was dubbed in Japanese by different actors instead of the same Japanese dubbing-actors from the cartoon because it was handled by a different Japanese dubbing studio, and it was marketed for the [[Kansai region|Kansai]] market. In Japanese theaters, foreign-language movies, except those intended for children, are usually shown in their original version with Japanese subtitles. Foreign films usually contain multiple Japanese-dubbing versions, but with several different original Japanese-dubbing voice actors, depending upon which TV station they are aired. [[NHK]], [[Nippon TV]], [[Fuji TV]], [[TV Asahi]], and [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] usually follow this practice, as do software releases on [[VHS]], [[Laserdisc]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]. As for recent foreign films being released, there are now some film theaters in Japan that show both dubbed and subtitled editions.\n\nOn 22 June 2009, [[20th Century Fox]]'s Japanese division has opened up a [[Blu-ray]] lineup known as \"Emperor of Dubbing\", dedicated at having multiple Japanese dubs of popular English-language films (mostly Hollywood films) as well as retaining the original scripts, releasing them altogether in special Blu-ray releases. These also feature a new dub created exclusively for that release as a director's cut, or a new dub made with a better surround sound mix to match that of the original English mix (as most older Japanese dubbings were made on mono mixes to be aired on TV). Other companies have followed practice, like Universal Pictures's Japanese division [[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan]] opening up \"Reprint of Memories\", along with [[:ja:\u30ef\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc \u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30c6\u30a4\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8 \u30b8\u30e3\u30d1\u30f3|Warner Bros Japan]] having \"Power of Dubbing\", which act in a similar way by re-packaging all the multiple Japanese dubs of popular films and putting them out as Special Blu-ray releases.\n\n\"Japanese dub-over artists\" provide the voices for certain performers, such as those listed in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

However, some anime is censored, such as Japanese letters or content being edited for a suitable Korean audience. Western cartoons are dubbed in Korean as well, such as [[Nickelodeon]] cartoons like ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and ''[[Danny Phantom]]''. Several English-language (mostly American) live-action films are dubbed in [[Korean language|Korean]], but they are not shown in theaters. Instead they are only broadcast on South Korean television networks ([[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]], [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]], [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]], [[Educational Broadcasting System|EBS]]), while DVD import releases of these films are shown with Korean subtitles, such as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. This may be due to the fact that the six American [[major film studio]]s may not own any rights to the Korean dubs of their live-action films that the Korean television networks have dubbed and aired. Even if they don't own the rights, Korean or non-Korean viewers can record from Korean-dubbed live-action films from television broadcasting onto DVDs with [[Digital video recorder|DVRs]].\n\nSometimes, video games are dubbed in Korean. Examples would be the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' series, the ''[[Jak & Daxter (series)|Jak & Daxter]]'' series, and the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series. For the ''Halo'' games, Lee Jeong Gu provides his Korean voice to the main protagonist [[Characters of Halo|Master Chief]] (replacing [[Steve Downes]]'s voice), while [[Kim So Hyeong (voice actor)|Kim So Hyeong]] voices [[Characters of Halo|Chieftain Tartarus]], one of the main antagonists (replacing [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]'s voice).\n\nThe following South Korean voice-over artists are usually identified with the following actors:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Movie theaters in [[Bangkok]] and some larger cities show both the subtitled version and the dubbed version of English-language movies. In big cities like Bangkok, Thai-language movies have English subtitles. <!-- For English-language animated movies, Disney films like ''[[The Lion King]]'', ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' and ''[[Tangled]]'' are dubbed entirely in Thai.\n\nChonnai Sukawat has provided the Thai-dubbing voice for the heroine Rapunzel in the film ''Tangled''. In the Thai version of ''Harry Potter'', [[Hermione Granger]] was dubbed by Thai singer and actress Bismillah Nana. Many English-language movies are sold on [[VCD]]s in Thailand, with the original English language and Thai subtitles, while also available with the Thai-language-dubbed version, such as ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', the ''Harry Potter'' film series, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' film series.

Then a few months or years later, those movies appear on TV either dubbed in Indonesian or subtitled. Kids shows are mostly dubbed, though even in cartoon series, songs aren't dubbed, but in big movies such as Disney movies, both speaking and singing voice were cast for the new Indonesian dub even though it took maybe a few months or even years for the movie to come out. Adult films was mostly subtitled, but sometimes they can be dubbed as well and because there aren't many Indonesian voices, especially in dubbed movies, three characters can have the exact same voice.\n\nReality shows are never dubbed in Indonesian, because they are not a planned interaction like with movies and TV shows, so if they appear in TV, they will be appear with subtitles.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

In general, the decision whether to dub a video production depends mainly on the target audience of the channel on which the feature will be aired, its genre, and/or outlet of transmission (e.g. TV or film, free or pay-TV).  \n\n=====Free-to-air TV=====\nThe prevalence of media needing to be dubbed has resulted in a talent pool that is very capable of syncing voice to lip, especially for shows broadcast by the country's three largest networks. It is not uncommon in the Filipino dub industry to have most of the voices in a series dubbing by only a handful of voice talents. Programmes originally in English used to usually air in their original language on free-to-air television. \n\nSince the late 1990s/early 2000s, however, more originally English-language programmes that air on major free-to-air networks (i.e. 5, ABS-CBN, GMA) have been dubbed into Filipino. Even the former Studio 23 (now S+A), once known for its airing programmes in English, had adopted Filipino-language dubbing for some of its foreign programmes. Children's programmes from cable networks [[Nickelodeon]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Disney Channel]] shown on [[TV5 (Philippines)|5]], GMA, or ABS-CBN, have long been dubbed into Filipino or another Philippine regional language.  [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Animated Disney films]] are often dubbed in Filipino except for the singing scenes, which are shown in their original language (though in recent years, there has been an increase in number of Disney musicals having their songs also translated such as ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'').  [[GMA News TV]] airs some documentaries, movies, and reality series originally shown in the English language as dubbed in Filipino.  \n\nDubbing is less common in smaller free-to-air networks such as [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]] and the former [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN 9]] (now CNN Philippines) whereby the original-language version of the programme is aired. Dramas from Asia (particularly Greater China and Korea) and Latin America (called ''Asianovelas'', and ''Mexicanovelas'', respectively) have always been dubbed into Filipino or another Philippine regional language, and each programme from these genres feature their unique set of Filipino-speaking voice actors.\n\n=====Pay TV=====\nThe original language-version of TV programmes is also usually available on cable/satellite channels such as [[Fox Life]], [[Fox Asia|Fox]], and AXN. However, some pay-TV channels specialise in showing foreign shows and films dubbed into Filipino. [[Cinema One]], ABS-CBN's cable movie channel, shows some films originally in non-English language dubbed into Filipino. [[Nat Geo Wild]] airs most programs dubbed into Filipino for Philippine audiences, being one of the few cable channels to do so. [[Tagalized Movie Channel|Tagalised Movie Channel]] & [[Tag (TV channel)|Tag]] airs Hollywood and Asian movies dubbed in Filipino. [[Fox Filipino]] airs some English, Latin, and Asian series dubbed in Filipino such as ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'', ''[[Devious Maids]]'', ''La Teniente'', ''Kdabra'', and some selected programs from [[Channel M (Southeast Asia)|Channel M]].  The defunct channel [[Hero (TV channel)|HERO TV]], which focuses on anime and [[tokusatsu]] shows and now a web portal, dubs all its foreign programs into Filipino. This is in contrast to Animax, where their anime programs are dubbed in English.\n\n=====Cinema=====\nForeign films, especially English films shown in local cinemas, are almost always shown in their original language.  Non-English foreign films make use of English subtitles. Unlike other countries, children's films originally in English are not dubbed in cinemas.\n\nA list of voice actors with their associates that they dub into Filipino are listed here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Dubbing is rarely done with the other major Indian languages, namely [[Malayalam]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]], due to lack of significant market size. Despite this, some [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Malayalam]] dubs of children television programs can be seen on the [[Sun TV Network|Sun TV]] channel. The dubbed versions are released into the towns and lower tier settlements of the respective states (where English penetration is low), often with the English-language originals released in the metropolitan areas. In all other states, the English originals are released along with the dubbed versions, where often the dubbed version collections are more outstanding than the originals. ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' was also done in the [[Bhojpuri language]], a language popular in [[East India|eastern India]] in addition to Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. ''[[A Good Day to Die Hard]]'', the most recent installment in the ''[[Die Hard (franchise)|Die Hard]]'' franchise, was the first ever Hollywood film to receive a [[Punjabi language|Punjabi language dub]] as well. \n\nMost TV channels mention neither the Indian-language dubbing credits, nor its staff, at the end of the original ending credits, since changing the credits casting for the original actors or voice actors involves a huge budget for modifying, making it somewhat difficult to find information for the dubbed versions. The same situation is encountered for films. Sometimes foreign programs and films receive more than one dub, such as for example, [[Jumanji]], [[Dragonheart]] and [[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]] having two Hindi dubs. Information for the Hindi, Tamil and Telugu voice actors who have done the voices for specific actors and for their roles on foreign films and television programs are published in local Indian data magazines, for those that are involved in the dubbing industry in India. But on a few occasions, there are some foreign productions that do credit the dubbing cast, such as animated films like the ''[[Barbie (film series)|Barbie]]'' films, and some Disney films. [[Disney Channel]] original series released on DVD with their Hindi dubs show a list of the artists in the Hindi dub credits, after the original ending credits. Theatrical releases and VCD releases of foreign films do not credit the dubbing cast or staff. The DVD releases, however, do have credits for the dubbing staff, if they are released multilingual. As of recently, information for the dubbing staff of foreign productions have been expanding due to high demands of people wanting to know the voice actors behind characters in foreign works. Large dubbing studios in India include [[Sound & Vision India]], [[Main Frame Software Communications]], [[Visual Reality]], [[ZamZam Productions]], [[Treasure Tower International]], [[Blue Whale Entertainment]], [[Jai Hand Entertainment]], [[Sugar Mediaz]] and [[Rudra Sound Solutionz]].\n\n====Pakistan====\nIn [[Pakistan]] \"foreign films\", and cartoons are not normally dubbed locally. Instead, foreign films, anime and cartoons, such as those shown on [[Nickelodeon Pakistan]] and [[Cartoon Network Pakistan]], are dubbed in [[Hindi]] in India, as Hindi and [[Urdu]], the national language of Pakistan, are [[mutually intelligible]].\nHowever, soap operas from [[Turkey]] are now dubbed in Urdu and have gained increased popularity at the expense of Indian soap operas in Hindi.<ref>[http://www.firstpost.com/living/in-pakistan-indian-soap-operas-give-way-to-turkish-serials-1260549.html In Pakistan, Indian soap operas give way to Turkish serials], ''[[First Post (India)|First Post]]'', 1 December 2013</ref> This has led to protests from local producers that these are a threat to Pakistan's television industry, with local productions being moved out of peak viewing time or dropped altogether.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/news/772593/is-tv-drama-industry-overreacting-to-turkish-soaps-blitz Is TV drama industry overreacting to Turkish soaps blitz?], ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', 20 December 2012</ref> Similarly, politicians leaders have expressed concerns over their content, given Turkey's less conservative culture.<ref>[http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/the-geopolitics-of-soap-operas/ The Geopolitics of Soap Operas], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 10 January 2013</ref>\n\n====Vietnam====\nIn [[Vietnam]], foreign-language films and programs are subtitled on television in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. They were not dubbed until 1985, but are briefly translated with a speaker before commercial breaks. ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' was considered to be the very first American Hollywood film to be entirely dubbed in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. Since then, children's films that came out afterwards have been released dubbed in theaters. [[HTV3]] has dubbed television programs for children, including ''[[Ben 10 (TV series)|Ben 10]]'', and ''[[Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide]]'', by using various voice actors to dub over the character roles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBlXxqhKwU |title=Ben 10 Vietnamese Trailer (Trailer Ben 10 - HTV3) |publisher=YouTube |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WbgyJP5-TA |title=HTV3 - C\u1ea9m Nang C\u1ee7a Ned - Trailer |publisher=YouTube |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nSooner afterwards, more programs started to get dubbed. HTV3 also offers anime dubbed into Vietnamese. [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]] got a Vietnamese dub in early 2014 on HTV3 starting with the Best Wishes series. But due to a controversy regarding Pok\u00e9mon's cries being re-dubbed despite that all characters had their Japanese names, it was switched to [[VTV2]] in September 2015 when the XY series debut. [[Sailor Moon (anime)|Sailor Moon]] also recently has been dubbed for HTV3 in early 2015.\n\n====Singapore====\nIn multilingual [[Singapore]], dubbing is rare for western programmes. English-language programmes on the free-to-air terrestrial channels are usually subtitled in Chinese or Malay. Chinese, Malay and Tamil programmes (except for news bulletins), usually have subtitles in English and the original language during the prime time hours. [[Dual sound]] programs, such as Korean and Japanese dramas, offer sound in the original languages with subtitles, Mandarin-dubbed and subtitled, or English-dubbed. The [[Speak Mandarin Campaign|deliberate policy to encourage Mandarin]] among citizens made it required by law for programs in other Chinese dialects ([[Min Nan|Hokkien]], Cantonese and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]) to be dubbed into Mandarin, with the exception of traditional [[opera]]s. Cantonese and Hokkien shows from Hong Kong and Taiwan, respectively, are available on VCD and DVD. In a recent development, news bulletins are subtitled.\n\n====Iran====\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Iranian Dubbing artists.jpg|thumb|A group of Iranian dubbing artists]]\nIn [[Iran]], foreign films and television programs are dubbed in [[Persian language|Persian]]. Dubbing began in 1946 with the advent of movies and cinemas in the country. Since then, foreign movies have always been dubbed for the cinema and TV. Using various voice actors and adding local hints and witticisms to the original contents, dubbing played a major role in attracting people to the cinemas and developing an interest in other cultures. The dubbing art in Iran reached its apex during the 1960s and 1970s with the inflow of American, European and Hindi movies.\n\nThe most famous musicals of the time, such as ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', were translated, adjusted and performed in Persian by the voice artists. Since the 1990s, for political reasons and under pressure from the state, the dubbing industry has declined, with movies dubbed only for the state TV channels. During recent years, DVDs with Persian subtitles have found a market among viewers for the same reason, but most people still prefer the Persian-speaking dubbed versions. Recently, privately operated companies started dubbing TV series by hiring famous dubbers.\n\nA list of Persian voice actors that associate with their actor counterparts are listed here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

There are exceptions, such as some children's cartoons.\n\n====Azerbaijan====\nIn [[Azerbaijan]], dubbing is rare, as most Azerbaijani channels such as [[G\u00fcn\u0259\u015f TV|ARB G\u00fcn\u0259\u015f]] air [[voice-over]]s or Azerbaijan originals.\n\n====Western Asia====\nSee [[#North Africa, Western Asia|below]].\n\n===Africa===\n====North Africa, Western Asia====\nIn [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and Tunisia, most foreign movies (especially Hollywood productions) are shown dubbed in French. These movies are usually imported directly from French film distributors. The choice of movies dubbed into French can be explained by the widespread use of the French language. Another important factor is that local theaters and private media companies do not dub in local languages in order to avoid high costs, but also because of the lack of both expertise and demand.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, dubbed series and movies for children in [[Modern Standard Arabic]] became a popular choice among most TV channels, cinemas and VHS/DVD stores. However, dubbed films are still imported, and dubbing is performed in the [[Levant]] countries with a strong tradition of dubbing (mainly [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]]).\n\nIn the Arabic-speaking countries, some children shows (mainly cartoons) are dubbed in Arabic, otherwise Arabic subtitles are used. The only exception was [[telenovelas]] dubbed in Standard Arabic, or dialects, but also Turkish series, most notably [[G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f (TV series)|G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f]], in Syrian Arabic.\n\nAn example of Arabic voice actors that dub for certain performers is Safi Mohammed for [[Elijah Wood]].\n\nIn [[Tunisia]], the Tunisia National Television (TNT), the public broadcaster of Tunisia, is not allowed to show any content in any language other than Arabic, which forces it to broadcast only dubbed content (this restriction was recently removed for commercials). During the 1970s and 1980s, TNT (known as ERTT at the time) started dubbing famous cartoons in Tunisian and Standard Arabic. However, in the private sector, television channels are not subject to the language rule.\n\n====South Africa====\nIn [[South Africa]], many television programmes were dubbed in [[Afrikaans]], with the original soundtrack (usually in English, but sometimes [[Dutch language|Dutch]] or [[German language|German]]) \"[[simulcast]]\" in [[FM stereo#Stereo FM|FM stereo]] on [[Radio 2000]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-NRDAQAAIAAJ&dq=was+simulcast++Radio+2000+afrikaans&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Radio+2000+afrikaans ''The voice, the vision: a sixty year history of the South African Broadcasting Corporation''], Malcolm Theunissen, Victor Nikitin, Melanie Pillay, Advent Graphics, 1996, page 120</ref> These included US series such as ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', ''(Steve Austin: Die Man van Staal)''<ref>[http://www.tvsa.co.za/mastershowinfo.asp?mastershowid=2293 The Six Million Dollar Man], TVSA - The South African TV Authority</ref> ''[[Miami Vice]]'' ''(Misdaad in Miami)'',<ref>{{cite news |title=Shows Allow Blacks, Whites to Share Cultural Experiences : South African Viewers Get a Mixed TV Message From U.S. Programs |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-25/news/mn-7271_1_south-african |accessdate=14 August 2012 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=25 May 1986|author=GLENN FRANKEL (from ''The Washington Post'')}}</ref> ''[[Beverly Hills 90210]]'',<ref>[http://mg.co.za/article/1996-02-09-the-critics-thumbs-up/ The critics' thumbs-up], ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'', 9 February 1996</ref> and the German detective series ''[[Derrick (TV series)|Derrick]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7h1DAQAAIAAJ&dq=derrick+tv+series+afrikaans&q=derrick+|title=Mass Media, Towards the Millennium|isbn=9780627023248|accessdate=9 July 2015|last1=Beer|first1=Arrie De|year=1998}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the [[boycott]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] actors' union [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], which banned the sale of most British television programmes, the [[puppet]] series ''[[The Adventures of Rupert Bear]]'' was dubbed into [[South African English]], as the original voices had been recorded by Equity voice artists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05212009-182219/unrestricted/07chapter7.pdf |last=Bevan |first=C |year=2008 |title=Putting up screens: A history of television in South Africa, 1929-1976, MHCS dissertation, University of Pretoria, Pretoria |accessdate=1 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215155949/http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05212009-182219/unrestricted/07chapter7.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThis practice has declined as a result of the reduction of airtime for the language on [[SABC]] TV, and the increase of locally produced material in Afrikaans on other channels like [[KykNet]]. Similarly, many programmes, such as ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', were dubbed into [[Zulu language|Zulu]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Lelyveld |first=Joseph |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/22/magazine/22SAFR.html?&pagewanted=all |title=South Africa: Dream and Reality |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=22 September 1985 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> but this has also declined as local drama production has increased. However, some animated films, such as ''[[Maya the Bee]]'', have been dubbed in both Afrikaans and Zulu by local artists.<ref>[http://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/News/Maya-the-Bee-flick-dubbed-into-Afrikaans-and-Zulu-for-SA-audience-20150910 Maya the Bee flick dubbed into Afrikaans and Zulu for SA audience], [[News24|Channel24]], 18 September 2015</ref>\n\n====Uganda====\nUganda's [[Cinema of Uganda|own film industry]] is fairly small, and foreign movies are commonly watched. The English sound track is often accompanied by the [[Luganda]] translation and comments, provided by an Ugandan \"video jockey\" (VJ). VJ's interpreting and narration may be available in a recorded form or live.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2012/11/cinema-uganda |title=Coming to you live\n|date=2 November 2012|journal=The Economist|first=M|last=H}}</ref>\n\n===Oceania===\nIn common with other English-speaking countries, there has traditionally been little dubbing in [[Australia]], with foreign language television programmes and films being shown (usually on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]) with subtitles or English dubs produced in other countries. This has also been the case in [[New Zealand]], but the [[M\u0101ori Television Service]], launched in 2004, has dubbed animated films into [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]].<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10117134 Maori TV broadens horizons], ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', 26 March 2005</ref> However, some TV commercials from foreign countries are dubbed, even if the original commercial came from another English-speaking country.  Moreover, the off-screen narration portions of some non-fiction programmes originating from the UK or North America are re-dubbed by Australian voice talents to relay information in expressions that Australians can understand more easily.\n\n==Alternatives==\n===Subtitles===\n{{Main|Subtitle}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[Subtitle (captioning)|Subtitles]] can be used instead of dubbing, as different countries have different traditions regarding the choice between dubbing and subtitling. On [[DVD]]s with higher translation budgets, the option for both types will often be provided to account for individual preferences; [[Purism|purists]] often demand subtitles. For small markets (small language area or films for a select audience), subtitling is more suitable, because it is cheaper. In the case of films for small children who cannot yet read, or do not read fast enough, dubbing is necessary.\n\nIn most [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, dubbing is comparatively rare. In [[Israel]], some programmes need to be comprehensible to speakers of both [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. This cannot be accomplished with dubbing, so subtitling is much more commonplace\u2014sometimes even with subtitles in multiple languages, with the soundtrack remaining in the original language, usually English. The same applies to certain television shows in [[Finland]], where [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] are both official languages.\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], [[Flanders]], [[Nordic countries]], [[Estonia]] and [[Portugal]], films and television programmes are shown in the original language (usually English) with subtitles, and only cartoons and children's movies and programs are dubbed, such as the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Shrek]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' and others. Cinemas usually show both a dubbed version and one with subtitles for this kind of movie, with the subtitled version shown later in the evening.\n\nIn Portugal, one terrestrial channel, [[TVI (Portugal)|TVI]], dubbed U.S. series like ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref name=\"DCpt\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sKswU7k_I |title=Dawson's Creek PT |last=Somnorte |date=6 December 2008 |via=YouTube}}</ref> RTP also transmitted ''[[Friends]]'' in a dubbed version, but it was poorly received and later re-aired in a subtitled version. Cartoons, on the other hand, are usually dubbed, sometimes by well-known actors, even on TV. Animated movies are usually released to the cinemas in both subtitled and dubbed versions.\n\nIn [[Argentina]] and [[Venezuela]], terrestrial channels air films and TV series in a dubbed version, as demanded by law. However, those same series can be seen on cable channels at more accessible time-slots in their subtitled version and usually before they are shown on open TV. In contrast, the series ''The Simpsons'' is aired in its Mexican Spanish-dubbed version both on terrestrial television and on the cable station Fox, which broadcasts the series for the area. Although the first season of the series appeared with subtitles, this was not continued for the following seasons.\n\n===Dubbing and subtitling===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nIn [[Bulgaria]], television series are dubbed, but most television channels use subtitles for action and drama movies. [[AXN]] uses subtitles for its series, but as of 2008 emphasises dubbing. Only [[Diema]] channels dub all programs. Movies in theaters, with the exception of films for children, use dubbing and subtitles. Dubbing of television programs is usually done using voiceovers, but usually, voices professional actors, while trying to give each character a different voice by using appropriate intonations. Dubbing with synchronised voices is rarely used, mostly for animated films. ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' is a rare example of a feature film dubbed this way on [[BNT Channel 1]], though a subtitled version is currently shown on other channels.\n\n[[Walt Disney Television]]'s animated series (such as ''[[DuckTales]]'', ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', and ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]'') were only aired with synchronised Bulgarian voices on [[BNT Channel 1]] until 2005, but then the Disney shows were canceled. When airing of Disney series resumed on [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] and [[Jetix]] in 2008, voiceovers were used, but Disney animated-movie translations still use synchronised voices. Voiceover dubbing is not used in theatrical releases. The Bulgarian film industry law requires all children's films to be dubbed, not subtitled. [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] dubbed and aired the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime with synchronised voices. Now, the show is airing on Disney Channel, also in a synchronised form.\n\n[[Netflix]] provides both subtitles and dubbed audio with its foreign language shows, including Brazil's dystopian \"[[3%]]\" and the German thriller \"[[Dark (TV series)|Dark]]\". Viewer testing indicates that its audience is more likely to finish watching a series if they select to view it with dubbed audio rather than translated subtitles. Netflix now streams its foreign language content with dubbed audio as default in an effort to increase viewer retention.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/netflix-success-secrets-1202721847/|title=Netflix's Secrets to Success: Six Cell Towers, Dubbing and More|last=Roettgers|first=Janko|date=8 March 2018|work=Variety|access-date=7 November 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==General use==\nDubbing is also used in applications and genres other than traditional film, including video games, television, and pornographic films.\n\n===Video games===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nMany [[video game]]s originally produced in [[North America]], [[Japan]], and [[PAL]] countries are dubbed into foreign languages for release in areas such as [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], especially for video games that place a heavy emphasis on dialogue. Because characters' mouth movements can be part of the game's code, [[lip sync]] is sometimes achieved by re-coding the mouth movements to match the dialogue in the new language. The [[Source engine]] automatically generates lip-sync data, making it easier for games to be localised.\n\nTo achieve synchronisation when animations are intended only for the source language, localised content is mostly recorded using techniques borrowed from movie dubbing (such as rythmo band) or, when images are not available, localised dubbing is done using source audios as a reference. Sound-synch is a method where localised audios are recorded matching the length and internal pauses of the source content.<!-- What does this last sentence mean? -->\n\nFor the European version of a video game, the on-screen text of the game is available in various languages and, in many cases, the dialogue is dubbed into each respective language, as well.\n\nThe North American version of any game is always available in [[English language|English]], with translated text and dubbed dialogue, if necessary, in other languages, especially if the North American version of the game contains the same data as the European version. Several Japanese games, such as those in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'', and ''[[Soul (series)|Soul]]'' series, are released with both the original Japanese audio and the English dub included.\n\n===Television===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nDubbing is occasionally used on [[network television]] broadcasts of films that contain dialogue that the network executives or [[Censorship|censors]] have decided to replace. This is usually done to remove [[profanity]]. In most cases, the original actor does not perform this duty, but an actor with a similar voice reads the changes. The results are sometimes seamless, but, in many cases, the voice of the replacement actor sounds nothing like the original performer, which becomes particularly noticeable when extensive dialogue must be replaced. Also, often easy to notice, is the sudden absence of background sounds in the movie during the dubbed dialogue. Among the films considered notorious for using substitute actors that sound very different from their theatrical counterparts are the ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' and the ''[[Die Hard series|Die Hard]]'' film series, as shown on broadcasters such as [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]]. In the case of ''Smokey and the Bandit'', extensive dubbing was done for the first network airing on [[ABC Television]] in 1978, especially for [[Jackie Gleason]]'s character, [[Buford T. Justice]]. The dubbing of his phrase \"sombitch\" (son of a bitch) became \"scum bum,\" which became a catchphrase of the time.\n\nDubbing is commonly used in [[science fiction television]], as well. Sound generated by effects equipment such as [[Animatronics|animatronic]] puppets or by actors' movements on elaborate multi-level plywood sets (for example, starship bridges or other command centers) will quite often make the original character dialogue unusable. ''[[Stargate]]'' and ''[[Farscape]]'' are two prime examples where ADR is used heavily to produce usable audio.\n\nSince some anime series contain profanity, the studios recording the English dubs often re-record certain lines if a series or movie is going to be broadcast on [[Cartoon Network]], removing references to [[death]] and [[hell]] as well. Some companies will offer both an edited and an uncut version of the series on DVD, so that there is an edited script available in case the series is broadcast. Other companies also edit the full-length version of a series, meaning that even on the uncut DVD characters say things like \"Blast!\" and \"Darn!\" in place of the original dialogue's profanity. [[Bandai|Bandai Entertainment's]] English dub of ''[[G Gundam]]'' is infamous for this, among many other things, with such lines as \"Bartender, more milk\".\n\nDubbing has also been used for comedic purposes, replacing lines of dialogue to create comedies from footage that was originally another genre. Examples include the Australian shows ''[[The Late Show (1990s Australian TV series)#The Olden Days|The Olden Days]]'' and ''[[Bargearse]]'', re-dubbed from 1970s Australian drama and action series, respectively, the Irish show ''[[Soupy Norman]]'', re-dubbed from ''[[:pl:Pierwsza mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107|Pierwsza mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107]]'', a Polish soap opera, and ''[[Most Extreme Elimination Challenge]]'', a comedic dub of the Japanese show ''[[Takeshi's Castle]]''.\n\nDubbing into a foreign language does not always entail the deletion of the original language. In some countries, a performer may read the translated dialogue as a voice-over. This often occurs in [[Russia]] and [[Poland]], where \"lektories\" or \"lektors\" read the translated dialogue into [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]. In Poland, one announcer read all text. However, this is done almost exclusively for the television and home video markets, while theatrical releases are usually subtitled. Recently, however, the number of high-quality, fully dubbed films has increased, especially for children's movies. If a quality dubbed version exists for a film, it is shown in theaters. However, some films, such as ''[[Harry Potter]]'' or ''[[Star Wars]]'', are shown in both dubbed and subtitled versions, varying with the time of the show. Such films are also shown on TV (although some channels drop them and do standard one-narrator translation) and VHS/DVD. In other countries, like [[Vietnam]], the voice-over technique is also used for theatrical releases.<!-- This section and the next one are redundant. This material has already been covered and should be merged above. -->\n\nIn Russia, the reading of all lines by a single person is referred to as a [[Gavrilov translation]], and is generally found only in [[Copyright infringement|illegal copies]] of films and on [[cable television]]. Professional copies always include at least two actors of opposite gender translating the dialogue. Some titles in Poland have been dubbed this way, too, but this method lacks public appeal, so it is very rare now.\n\nOn special occasions, such as [[film festival]]s, live [[interpreting]] is often done by professionals.\n\n===Pornography===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nAs budgets for [[pornographic film]]s are often small, compared to films made by major studios, and there is an inherent need to film without interrupting filming, it is common for sex scenes to be over-dubbed. The audio for such over-dubbing is generally referred to as ''the Ms and Gs'', or ''the moans and groans.''\n\n==Dubbing into varieties==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2013}}\nIn the case of languages with large communities (such as [[English language|English]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], or [[French language|French]]), a single translation may sound foreign to native speakers in a given region. Therefore, a film may be translated into a certain variety of a certain language. For example, the animated movie ''[[The Incredibles]]'' was translated to [[European Spanish]], [[Mexican Spanish]], [[Neutral Spanish]] (which is Mexican Spanish but avoids colloquialisms), and [[Rioplatense Spanish]] (although people from [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]] noticed a strong ''[[porte\u00f1o]]'' accent from most of the characters of the Rioplatense Spanish translation).{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} In [[List of countries where Spanish is an official language|Spanish-speaking regions]], most media is dubbed twice: into European Spanish and Neutral Spanish.\n\nAnother example is the French dubbing of ''The Simpsons'', which has two entirely different versions for [[Quebec]] and for [[France]]. The humor is very different for each audience (see [[Non-English versions of The Simpsons|Non-English versions of ''The Simpsons'']]). Audiences in Quebec are generally critical of France's dubbing of ''The Simpsons'', which they often do not find amusing.\n\n[[Quebec French|Quebec-French]] dubbing of films is generally made in accent-free [[Standard French]], but may sound peculiar to audiences in France because of the persistence of some regionally-neutral expressions and because Quebec-French performers pronounce Anglo-Saxon names with an American accent, unlike French performers. Occasionally, budget restraints cause American [[direct-to-video]] films, such as the 1995 film ''When the Bullet Hits the Bone'', to be released in France with a Quebec-French dubbing, sometimes resulting in what some members of French audiences perceive as unintentional humor.\n\n[[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]] also use different versions of dubbed films and series. Because dubbing has never been very popular in [[Portugal]], for decades, children's films were distributed using the higher-quality Brazilian dub (unlike children's TV series, which are traditionally dubbed in European Portuguese). Only in the 1990s did dubbing begin to gain popularity in Portugal. ''[[The Lion King]]'' became the first Disney feature film to be completely dubbed into [[European Portuguese]], and subsequently all major animation films gained European-Portuguese versions. In recent [[DVD]] releases, most Brazilian-Portuguese-dubbed classics were released with new European-Portuguese dubs, eliminating the predominance of Brazilian-Portuguese dubs in Portugal.\n\nSimilarly, in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking region of [[Flanders]], [[Belgium]], cartoons are often dubbed locally by [[Flemish]] artists{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} rather than using soundtracks produced in the [[Netherlands]].\n\nThe [[list of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking region]], which includes [[Germany]], [[Austria]], part of [[Switzerland]], and [[Liechtenstein]], share a common German-dubbed version of films and shows. Although there are some differences in the three major German varieties, all films, shows, and series are dubbed into a single [[Standard German]] version that avoids regional variations in the German-speaking audience. Most voice actors are primarily German or Austrian. Switzerland, which has four official languages (German, French, [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Romansh language|Romansh]]), generally uses dubbed versions made in each respective country (except for Romansh). Liechtenstein uses German-dubbed versions only.\n\nSometimes, films are also dubbed into several [[German dialects]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ([[Berlinerisch]], [[Colognian language|K\u00f6lsch]], [[Saxonian]], [[Austro-Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]] or [[Swiss German]]), especially animated films and Disney films. They are as an additional \"special feature\" to entice the audience into buying it. Popular animated films dubbed into German variety include ''[[Asterix]]'' films (in addition to its Standard German version, every film has a particular variety version), ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ''[[Shrek 2]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', (+ Austrian German){{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} and ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OBS_20090810_OBS0008 |title=\u00d6sterreich-Version von Disney/Pixars \"Oben\" mit Otto Schenk und Karlheinz B\u00f6hm - BILD |language=de |publisher=ots.at |date=10 August 2009 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> (+ Austrian German).\n\nSome live-action films or TV-series have an additional German variety dubbing: ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'' (German German, Austrian German, Swiss German); and ''[[Rehearsal for Murder]]'', ''[[Framed (TV series)|Framed]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://215072.homepagemodules.de/topic-threaded.php?forum=11776730&threaded=1&id=506508&message=6643629 |title=Allgemeines \" ORF-Synchronisationen - Wer wei\u00df was? |publisher=215072.homepagemodules.de |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> (+ Austrian German); ''[[The Munsters]]'', ''[[Serpico]]'', ''[[Rumpole]]'' (+ Austrian German), and ''[[The Thorn Birds]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://215072.homepagemodules.de/topic-threaded.php?forum=11776728&threaded=1&id=506269&message=7100872 |title=Serien \" 24 |publisher=215072.homepagemodules.de |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n(only Austrian German dubbing).\n\nBefore [[German reunification]], [[East Germany]] also made its own particular German version. For example, ''[[Olsen-banden|Olsen Gang]]'' and the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] animated series ''[[The M\u00e9zga Family]]'' were dubbed in [[West Germany]] as well as East Germany.\n\nUsually, there are two dubbings produced in [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]: [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. Serbian for [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]; Croatian for [[Croatia]] and parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n\nWhile the voice actors involved usually bear the brunt of criticisms towards poor dubbing, other factors may include inaccurate script translation and poor [[Audio mixing (television and film)|audio mixing]]. Dialogue typically contains speech patterns and sentence structure that are natural to the original language but would appear awkward if translated literally. English dubs of Japanese animation, for example, must rewrite the dialogue so that it flows smoothly while following the natural pattern of English speech. On some occasions, voice actors record their dialogue individually instead of with the rest of the cast, and their performances can lack the dynamics gained from performing as a group.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nMany [[martial arts]] movies from [[Hong Kong]] that were imported under the unofficial banner [[Kung Fu Theater]] were notorious{{according to whom|date=June 2019}} for seemingly careless dubbing that included poor lip sync and awkward dialogue. Since the results were frequently unintentionally humorous, it has become one of the hallmarks that endear these films to fans of the 1980s culture.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{commons category|Dubbing (filmmaking)}}\n*{{Cite book |last1=Maluf |first1=Ramez |title=Dubbing into Arabic: A Trojan Horse at the Gates? |url=http://inhouse.lau.edu.lb/bima/papers/Dubbing.pdf |accessdate=10 April 2011 |date=19 December 2003 |publisher=[[Lebanese American University]]}}\n*Di Fortunato E. e Paolinelli M.

SAVE YOURSELF \n\n\n''David Hamilton Koch''' ({{IPAc-en|k|o\u028a|k}}; May 3, 1940&nbsp;\u2013 August 23, 2019) was an American businessman, philanthropist, political activist, and chemical engineer. In 1970, he joined the family business: [[Koch Industries]], the second-largest privately held company in the United States. He became president of the subsidiary Koch Engineering in 1979, and became a co-owner of Koch Industries (along with elder brother [[Charles Koch|Charles]]) in 1983. Koch served as an executive vice president of Koch Industries until he retired due to health issues in 2018.\n\nKoch was a [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]]. He was the 1980 [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] candidate for [[Vice President of the United States]] and helped finance the campaign. He founded [[Citizens for a Sound Economy]] and donated to advocacy groups and [[Political activities of the Koch brothers|political campaigns]], most of which were [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. Koch became a Republican in 1984; in 2012, he spent over $100&nbsp;million to oppose the re-election of President [[Barack Obama]].\n\nKoch was the fourth-richest person in the United States in 2012 and was the wealthiest resident of [[New York City]] in 2013. As of June 2019, Koch was ranked as the 11th-richest person in the world (tied with his brother Charles), with a fortune of $50.5&nbsp;billion. Known for his philanthropy, Koch contributed to the [[Lincoln Center]], [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center|Sloan Kettering]], [[NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital]], and the Dinosaur Wing at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. The New York State Theater at Lincoln Center, home of the [[New York City Ballet]], was renamed the [[David H. Koch Theater]] in 2008 following Koch's gift of $100&nbsp;million for the renovation of the theater.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nKoch was born in [[Wichita, Kansas]], the son of Mary Clementine (n\u00e9e Robinson) and [[Fred C. Koch|Fred Chase Koch]], a chemical engineer.

He was a member of the [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity. Koch played basketball at MIT, averaging 21 points per game at MIT over three years, a school record.

The organization began as a group of thirty housewives who saved money for needy families. Tzu Chi gradually expanded its services over time, opening a free medical clinic in 1972 and building its first hospital in 1986. The organization underwent a rapid expansion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, coinciding with a surge of popularity in [[Humanistic Buddhism]] in Taiwan. In the 1990s the organization started major international disaster relief efforts. Tzu Chi is known for undertaking long term projects such as building new homes, schools, hospitals, and places of worship (including churches and mosques for non-Buddhists) for victims following a disaster. As of 2013, the organization was estimated at over 10 million members worldwide throughout 47 countries. \n\nTzu Chi has a policy of being secular in its humanitarian work, however [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] teachings are often integrated into its practices for volunteers. Cheng Yen is considered to be one of the \"[[Four Heavenly Kings (Taiwan)|Four Heavenly Kings]]\" of Taiwanese Buddhism, and Tzu Chi itself is considered to be one of the \"[[Four Great Mountains (Taiwan)|Four Great Mountains]]\", or four major Buddhist organizations of Taiwan along with [[Fo Guang Shan]], [[Dharma Drum Mountain]], and [[Chung Tai Shan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://info.taiwan.net.tw/tourbusE/december_page1.html |title=Come to Taiwan, Return with good memories |publisher=Info.taiwan.net.tw |accessdate=2012-02-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227183910/http://info.taiwan.net.tw/tourbusE/december_page1.html |archivedate=27 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shuai|first=J.

Medicine]] in 1994.  This college became [[Tzu Chi University]] in 2000. In the meantime Cheng-Yen appealed to the Taiwanese public to donate their bodies for medical training, attempting to dispel traditional taboos in the process. As a result of this appeal, public support for [[body donation]]s surged nationwide. Consequently, at the Tzu Chi College of Medicine, there is one body for every four students to study as opposed to one body for every two hundred students at one school, the ratio is the lowest in the country.\n\nIn 1995, the Athletic Drug Testing Center was established at the request of the Ministry of Education and went into operation in 1996 during a national sporting event when gold medal winners were tested for banned drugs.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n== Disaster relief ==\n[[File:Tzu Chi Culture and Communication Foundation 20080309.jpg|thumb|Tzu Chi Culture and Communications building]]\nTzu Chi is most well known for its disaster relief efforts worldwide.

Cheng Yen has referred to relief work in [[China]] as \"Building a Bridge of Love.\" The initial problems with providing aid in China involved the [[Cross-Strait relations|political tensions]] between Taiwan and China and Communist China's disdain for religion. In Taiwan, it was difficult to convince [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] to help the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and in China, it was difficult to convince government officials normally wary of religious organizations to accept Tzu Chi.\n\nTzu Chi's involvement in the [[People's Republic of China]] began in 1991, when it undertook relief operations after [[Eastern China flood of 1991|severe floods hit central and eastern China]]. The aid provided to China was Tzu Chi's first major effort at international relief aid, it also allowed Tzu Chi to develop its principles of delivering aid and establish relations with the People's Republic of China. Since then, the foundation has built schools, nursing homes and entire villages, including infrastructure in poor inland areas, such as [[Guizhou]] province.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal|title=Outline of assistance given to Chinese provinces|url=http://taipei.tzuchi.org.tw/tzquart/book/book1/book1.htm|archivedate=2012-03-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305053915/http://taipei.tzuchi.org.tw/tzquart/book/book1/book1.htm|accessdate=2014-03-27}}</ref>\n\nOver the past twenty years, Tzu Chi expanded their humanitarian work and influence to 28 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China.

The organization began as a group of thirty housewives who saved money for needy families. Tzu Chi gradually expanded its services over time, opening a free medical clinic in 1972 and building its first hospital in 1986. The organization underwent a rapid expansion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, coinciding with a surge of popularity in [[Humanistic Buddhism]] in Taiwan. In the 1990s the organization started major international disaster relief efforts. Tzu Chi is known for undertaking long term projects such as building new homes, schools, hospitals, and places of worship (including churches and mosques for non-Buddhists) for victims following a disaster. As of 2013, the organization was estimated at over 10 million members worldwide throughout 47 countries. \n\nTzu Chi has a policy of being secular in its humanitarian work, however [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] teachings are often integrated into its practices for volunteers. Cheng Yen is considered to be one of the \"[[Four Heavenly Kings (Taiwan)|Four Heavenly Kings]]\" of Taiwanese Buddhism, and Tzu Chi itself is considered to be one of the \"[[Four Great Mountains (Taiwan)|Four Great Mountains]]\", or four major Buddhist organizations of Taiwan along with [[Fo Guang Shan]], [[Dharma Drum Mountain]], and [[Chung Tai Shan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://info.taiwan.net.tw/tourbusE/december_page1.html |title=Come to Taiwan, Return with good memories |publisher=Info.taiwan.net.tw |accessdate=2012-02-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227183910/http://info.taiwan.net.tw/tourbusE/december_page1.html |archivedate=27 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shuai|first=J.

Medicine]] in 1994.  This college became [[Tzu Chi University]] in 2000. In the meantime Cheng-Yen appealed to the Taiwanese public to donate their bodies for medical training, attempting to dispel traditional taboos in the process. As a result of this appeal, public support for [[body donation]]s surged nationwide. Consequently, at the Tzu Chi College of Medicine, there is one body for every four students to study as opposed to one body for every two hundred students at one school, the ratio is the lowest in the country.\n\nIn 1995, the Athletic Drug Testing Center was established at the request of the Ministry of Education and went into operation in 1996 during a national sporting event when gold medal winners were tested for banned drugs.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n== Disaster relief ==\n[[File:Tzu Chi Culture and Communication Foundation 20080309.jpg|thumb|Tzu Chi Culture and Communications building]]\nTzu Chi is most well known for its disaster relief efforts worldwide.

Cheng Yen has referred to relief work in [[China]] as \"Building a Bridge of Love.\" The initial problems with providing aid in China involved the [[Cross-Strait relations|political tensions]] between Taiwan and China and Communist China's disdain for religion. In Taiwan, it was difficult to convince [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] to help the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and in China, it was difficult to convince government officials normally wary of religious organizations to accept Tzu Chi.\n\nTzu Chi's involvement in the [[People's Republic of China]] began in 1991, when it undertook relief operations after [[Eastern China flood of 1991|severe floods hit central and eastern China]]. The aid provided to China was Tzu Chi's first major effort at international relief aid, it also allowed Tzu Chi to develop its principles of delivering aid and establish relations with the People's Republic of China. Since then, the foundation has built schools, nursing homes and entire villages, including infrastructure in poor inland areas, such as [[Guizhou]] province.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal|title=Outline of assistance given to Chinese provinces|url=http://taipei.tzuchi.org.tw/tzquart/book/book1/book1.htm|archivedate=2012-03-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305053915/http://taipei.tzuchi.org.tw/tzquart/book/book1/book1.htm|accessdate=2014-03-27}}</ref>\n\nOver the past twenty years, Tzu Chi expanded their humanitarian work and influence to 28 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China.

Celebrations during Tzu Chi Day include the bathing of the Buddha ceremony, the tradition's message is that it is the people that need cleansing before they become better individuals. Tzu Chi promotes many of the teachings of Buddhism, in particular the [[Lotus Sutra]], \nand also has sutra adaptations through the use of sign language on the [[Innumerable Meanings Sutra|Sutra of the Innumerable Meanings]], which teaches that sentient existence is challenging and filled with disasters in the absence of observations of [[\u015a\u012bla|virtue]], as well as the [[Water Repentence|Sutra of the Water Repentance]], which advocates and symbolizes the need to repent [[karma|karmic transgressions]].
