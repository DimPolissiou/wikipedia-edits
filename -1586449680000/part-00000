Crombie Saunders]]\n'''Robert Crombie Saunders''' (23 April 1914 \u2013 14 February 1991) was a poet, editor, journalist and teacher, and a significant figure in the [[Scottish Literary Renaissance]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hugh MacDiarmid and The Scottish Renaissance|last=Glen|first=Duncan|publisher=W & R Chambers Ltd.|year=1964|isbn=|location=Edinburgh and London|pages=34, 38n, 187, 203, 213, 266}}</ref> of the 20th century. His poetry is in both English and Scots, and he identified with the '[[Lallans|Lallans']] movement, which sought to revive Scots as a serious literary medium.\n\n== Biographical ==\nBorn in [[Glasgow]], R. Crombie Saunders was educated at [[Hillhead High School]] and [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow University]], graduating MA in 1937. From 1938-39 he was an Assistant Editor with [[Blackie and Son|Blackie & Son]]. Ruled unfit for military service on health grounds, he was employed during the war as private secretary to David Archer, publisher (1941\u201342) and as an Employment Officer in the Ministry of Labour and National Service (1942\u201343). He edited ''Scottish Art and Letters''<ref>Scottish Art and Letters,  Vols 1-4, published by William MacLellan, Glasgow, 1944-48</ref> (with [[John Duncan Fergusson|J. D. Fergusson]] as Art Editor) from 1944\u201348, a total of four issues, with the fifth issue being edited my [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] (C.M. Grieve). In 1944 he edited the ''Selected Poems of Hugh MacDiarmid.'' He was associate and literary editor of the left-wing paper ''[[Forward (Scottish newspaper)|Forward]]'' from 1947-59. From 1948-53 he edited ''The Scottish Angler'', and was Angling Correspondent for the ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'' from 1954-57. He was also editor of ''[[The Scots Independent|Scots Independent]]'' from 1953-54. From 1958 he was a short story assessor and children's books reviewer for the BBC.\n\nIn 1952, he moved to a small cottage in the Perthshire Highlands. With a growing family to support, he retrained as a teacher, and taught first at [[Balquhidder]] Primary, then [[Killin]] Junior Secondary before moving to [[Callander]], where he was part of the English department at [[McLaren High School|McLaren High]] until his retirement. His last years were spent in Killin, Perthshire.\n\n== Literary connections ==\nSaunders was friends with many of the major players in the 'first wave' of Scottish Renaissance, including [[Sydney Goodsir Smith]], [[Sorley MacLean|Sorley McLean]], [[Douglas Young (classicist)|Douglas Young]], [[Alexander Scott (20th-century poet)|Alexander Scott]], [[C. M. Grieve]] (Hugh MacDiarmid) and in particular [[Norman MacCaig]], whom he introduced to MacDiarmid. He and MacCaig shared an interest in angling as well as poetry, and MacCaig accompanied his researches for ''A Guide to the Fishing Inns of Scotland'' (1950). However, chronic ill health and geographical isolation meant that Saunders was never a regular with the 'Rose Street poets,' and his friendships went beyond that circle to include writers such as [[Moray McLaren]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.scotlandonair.com/index.php?title=Moray_McLaren|title=Moray McLaren}}</ref> [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]] was another close friend, and wrote his obituary in the Glasgow Herald.

His first poetry collection was ''The Year's Green Edge'' in 1955. This was followed by ''XXI Poems'' containing most of his poems in Scots. After a long silence, he published ''This One Tree'' in 1986, containing most of his poetry since the fifties as well as some earlier uncollected pieces.\n\nWhether in Scots or English, the poetry is characterised by a respect for, and sensitivity too, form and rhythm; this applies to his later 'free verse' as much as to his earlier metrical work. Recurrent themes are the lyrical concerns of love and loss, time and memory. Some, like ''Above the Formidable Tomb'' and ''Had I Twa Herts'', are profoundly metaphysical. He also wrote a poem in Middle Scots (''Ressaif My Saul''), and gently satirised some of his contemporaries in ''Doun the Watter wi the Lave''.

He studied art at [[State University College at Buffalo]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], receiving a BFA in 1980; and subsequently received a MFA in art and film from [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1984 (working under [[Chris Burden]], [[Charles Ray (artist)|Charles Ray]], and [[Shirley Clarke]]. He lived and worked in [[Los Angeles]] from 1980 until 2017. From 1997 to 2017 he taught studio arts at [[Art Center College of Design]], [[Pasadena]]. He has had solo exhibitions at [[Kunsthalle Wien]], Vienna; the [[University of Houston]]; the [[Laguna Art Museum]], [[Laguna Beach]]; and [[Exit Art]], [[New York City|New York]], among others. He has participated in group exhibitions at the [[Orange County Museum of Art]], [[Newport Beach]], CA; the [[Getty Museum]], [[Los Angeles]]; Human Resources, Los Angeles, CA; [[MoMA PS1]], [[Long Island City]], NY; the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]; [[Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art|ICALA]], the Louisiana Museum of Art, Humbleb\u00e6k, Denmark; and [[Secession]], Vienna; and he has received awards and grants from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]], the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], and Art Matters, among others.<ref>https://www.theicala.org/en/exhibitions/8-skip-arnold-truffle-hunt</ref>\n\n==Work==\n\nArnold is best known for [[performance art]] actions in which he seeks to become an object named in the title of each work. For example, by loosely approximating the shape or style of a given object \u2013 usually but not always a sculptural artefact or architectural feature \u2013 Arnold has sought to resemble: a [[scarecrow]] in ''Scare Crow'' (Conklin Forks, New York, 1986), a [[closet]] in ''Closet Corner'' (Los Angeles, 1987), a [[sculpture]] in a [[fountain]] in ''A Sculpture in a Fountain'' (Los Angeles, 1988), a [[hood ornament]] in ''Hood Ornament'' (Sun Valley, California, 1992), a [[gargoyle]] in ''Gargoyle'' (Los Angeles, 1992), a [[statue]] in ''Statue'' (Los Angeles, 1993), an [[appendage]] (to a [[telephone pole]]) in ''Appendage'' (Los Angeles, 1993), part of a [[marquee (sign)|marquee]] in ''Marquee'' or the [[fa\u00e7ade]] of a building in ''Fa\u00e7ade'' (Geneva, 1996), or is shipped as [[freight]] from Austria to Germany in ''Freight'' (Linz to Cologne, 1993).\n\nArnold also makes [[video art]] works, including performances for camera, and short playful pieces that resemble skits, pranks or TV advertisements. Representative video works include ''Punch'' (1984), a video-sculpture that shows a 15-second loop of Arnold being punched hard in the gut and falling through the frames of two stacked monitors; the ''Activities Made for TV'' series (1983-1992) that involve him undertaking simple actions such as barking at a concealed dog in ''Antagination'' (1976), rolling his head along Saint Patrick's Wall in ''Roll'' (1986), or eating an olive in an [[X-ray]] machine in '' Skip Eats an Olive'' (1984); and the more recent ''Whipping'' series (2017), in which Arnold spins in circles with outstretched arms, and has edited the video such that his body resembles a ceiling fan.\n\nOther works involved Arnold undertaking durational tasks in public, such as navigating the [[Bermuda Triangle]] in ''B. T. Exploration'' (1996), funded by a prestigious [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]; being installed underneath a sheet of glass at the entrance to the Basel Art Fair such that visitors had to walk over him to enter the event (''Gruezi'', 2002); being installed wrapped in plastic in a public square in Slovakia (''An Occurrence at Nove Z\u00e1mky'', 2002); or taking eight-hour showers daily for four days in a hotel room during the Gramercy International Art Fair (''Shower'', 1997).\n\nArnold also engages in long-term project-based works, for example ''Truffle Hunt'' (1998), a collaboration with artists [[Jason Rhoades]] and Hans Weigand. It was originally conceived for Rhoades\u2019s ''International Museum Project About Leaving and Arriving (I.M.P.A.L.A.)'', and involved Arnold, Rhoades, and Weigand journeying to Italy via Switzerland in search of truffles; in its exhibited form at [[Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art|ICALA]] in 2018 (January 28-April 8), it  included maps of their journey to different locations in the countryside, Polaroids, video clips, and related ephemera, as well as one of the truffles smuggled back to Los Angeles by the artists, installed on a turntable.<ref>https://www.theicala.org/en/exhibitions/8-skip-arnold-truffle-hunt</ref>\n\nIn a widely reproduced manifesto, first published in 1993, Arnold has stated:\n\n<blockquote> The emphasis is on space and how/what my body does or can do. The work ranges from being extremely physical to extremely passive. <br /> To explore the relationships between self, place, and particular time. <br /> To explore fundamental gestures and concepts. <br /> My interest is the image and nothing else. <br /> I work in media that are evanescent, transient, consumed in passing, not collected. <br /> What is common to all my work is \"Skip.\" Skip is the artwork.

He studied art at [[State University College at Buffalo]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], receiving a BFA in 1980; and subsequently received a MFA in art and film from [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1984 (working under [[Chris Burden]], [[Charles Ray (artist)|Charles Ray]], and [[Shirley Clarke]]. He lived and worked in [[Los Angeles]] from 1980 until 2017. From 1997 to 2017 he taught studio arts at [[Art Center College of Design]], [[Pasadena]]. He has had solo exhibitions at [[Kunsthalle Wien]], Vienna; the [[University of Houston]]; the [[Laguna Art Museum]], [[Laguna Beach]]; and [[Exit Art]], [[New York City|New York]], among others. He has participated in group exhibitions at the [[Orange County Museum of Art]], [[Newport Beach]], CA; the [[Getty Museum]], [[Los Angeles]]; Human Resources, Los Angeles, CA; [[MoMA PS1]], [[Long Island City]], NY; the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]; [[Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art|ICALA]], the Louisiana Museum of Art, Humbleb\u00e6k, Denmark; and [[Secession]], Vienna; and he has received awards and grants from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]], the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], and Art Matters, among others.<ref>https://www.theicala.org/en/exhibitions/8-skip-arnold-truffle-hunt</ref>\n\n==Work==\n\nArnold is best known for [[performance art]] actions in which he seeks to become an object named in the title of each work. For example, by loosely approximating the shape or style of a given object \u2013 usually but not always a sculptural artefact or architectural feature \u2013 Arnold has sought to resemble: a [[scarecrow]] in ''Scare Crow'' (Conklin Forks, New York, 1986), a [[closet]] in ''Closet Corner'' (Los Angeles, 1987), a [[sculpture]] in a [[fountain]] in ''A Sculpture in a Fountain'' (Los Angeles, 1988), a [[hood ornament]] in ''Hood Ornament'' (Sun Valley, California, 1992), a [[gargoyle]] in ''Gargoyle'' (Los Angeles, 1992), a [[statue]] in ''Statue'' (Los Angeles, 1993), an [[appendage]] (to a [[telephone pole]]) in ''Appendage'' (Los Angeles, 1993), part of a [[marquee (sign)|marquee]] in ''Marquee'' or the [[fa\u00e7ade]] of a building in ''Fa\u00e7ade'' (Geneva, 1996), or is shipped as [[freight]] from Austria to Germany in ''Freight'' (Linz to Cologne, 1993).\n\nArnold also makes [[video art]] works, including performances for camera, and short playful pieces that resemble skits, pranks or TV advertisements. Representative video works include ''Punch'' (1984), a video-sculpture that shows a 15-second loop of Arnold being punched hard in the gut and falling through the frames of two stacked monitors; the ''Activities Made for TV'' series (1983-1992) that involve him undertaking simple actions such as barking at a concealed dog in ''Antagination'' (1976), rolling his head along Saint Patrick's Wall in ''Roll'' (1986), or eating an olive in an [[X-ray]] machine in '' Skip Eats an Olive'' (1984); and the more recent ''Whipping'' series (2017), in which Arnold spins in circles with outstretched arms, and has edited the video such that his body resembles a ceiling fan.\n\nOther works involved Arnold undertaking durational tasks in public, such as navigating the [[Bermuda Triangle]] in ''B. T. Exploration'' (1996), funded by a prestigious [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]; being installed underneath a sheet of glass at the entrance to the Basel Art Fair such that visitors had to walk over him to enter the event (''Gruezi'', 2002); being installed wrapped in plastic in a public square in Slovakia (''An Occurrence at Nove Z\u00e1mky'', 2002); or taking eight-hour showers daily for four days in a hotel room during the Gramercy International Art Fair (''Shower'', 1997).\n\nArnold also engages in long-term project-based works, for example ''Truffle Hunt'' (1998), a collaboration with artists [[Jason Rhoades]] and Hans Weigand. It was originally conceived for the Rhoades\u2019s International Museum Project About Leaving and Arriving (I.M.P.A.L.A.), and involved Arnold, Rhoades, and Weigand journeying to Italy via Switzerland in search of truffles; in its exhibited form at [[Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art|ICALA]] in 2018 (January 28-April 8), it  included maps of their journey to different locations in the countryside, Polaroids, video clips, and related ephemera, as well as one of the truffles smuggled back to Los Angeles by the artists, installed on a turntable.<ref>https://www.theicala.org/en/exhibitions/8-skip-arnold-truffle-hunt</ref>\n\nIn a widely reproduced manifesto, first published in 1993, Arnold has stated:\n\n<blockquote> The emphasis is on space and how/what my body does or can do. The work ranges from being extremely physical to extremely passive. <br /> To explore the relationships between self, place, and particular time. <br /> To explore fundamental gestures and concepts. <br /> My interest is the image and nothing else. <br /> I work in media that are evanescent, transient, consumed in passing, not collected. <br /> What is common to all my work is \"Skip.\" Skip is the artwork. The act of doing, my actions, my choices.<ref>http://skiparnold.com/</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\nHis works are often comedic or slapstick in tone, or resemble pranks, or may appear violent or reckless.<ref>{{cite book|title=''Black Sphinx: On the Comedic in Modern Art''|editor1-first=John|editor1-last=Welchman|location=Zurich|publisher=JRP Ringier|date=2008|isbn=978-0892369225|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780892369225}}</ref> His work resembles the work of fellow performance and multimedia artists associated with Los Angeles including [[Paul McCarthy]], [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]], [[Kim Jones (artist)|Kim Jones]], [[Eleanor Antin]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Bas Jan Ader]], or [[Chris Burden]], as well as the often-humorous work of the Conceptual artists [[Jeffrey Vallance]] and [[John Baldessari]].

It remained at Campbell Barracks and was charged with defending southern Germany against any prospective [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] attack.  It consisted of the [[:de:II. Korps (Bundeswehr)|German II Corps]], the [[III Corps (Bundeswehr)|German III Corps]], the [[V Corps (United States)|US V Corps]], and the [[VII Corps (United States)|US VII Corps]].\n\nIn August 1961, CENTAG was relocated to [[Mannheim#United States military installations|Hammonds Barracks]], (formerly Loretto Kaserne) Mannheim-Seckenheim, Germany and remained there until December 1980 when NATO determined coordination was better when three headquarters were located on the same installation.  [[CENTAG wartime structure in 1989|CENTAG]] was returned to Campbell Barracks to be collocated with the [[Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force]] (4 ATAF) and the [[ACE Mobile Force (Land)|Allied Command Europe Mobile Force-Land]] (AMF(L)).\n\nStructural changes began in June 1993, when CENTAG and the [[Northern Army Group]] (NORTHAG), [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]], Germany were deactivated and combined to form Allied Land Forces Central Europe (LANDCENT), which was activated in Heidelberg on 1 July 1993.<ref>Thomas-Durrel Young, 1997, p.8</ref>\n\nLANDCENT's mission was to:<ref>Thomas-Durrell Young, 1997, p.9, citing Briefing slides, 'Allied Land Forces Central Europe,' HQ LANDCENT, Heidelberg, n.d.</ref>\n\n*1) contribute to the protection of peace and deterrence of aggression,\n*2) plan, prepare and direct operations of allocated land forces for the security and defence of his area of responsibility,\n*3) plan, coordinate, and conduct synchronized air/land operations in support of CINCENT's theater campaign, and\n*4) be prepared to conduct peace support operations\n\nAt the lower level, all strictly national corps in the central region were superseded, in wartime plans terms at least, by the mid 1990s. All NATO corps, except for the [[:de:IV. Korps (Bundeswehr)|German IV Corps]], were then multinational. In the mid-late 1990s there were four multinational main defence corps in NATO's Central Region: one Danish-German ([[Multinational Corps Northeast|LANDJUT]]), one Dutch-German ([[I. German/Dutch Corps|I. GE/NL Corps]]) and two German-United States (II GE/US and V US/GE). The two German-United States corps were strictly wartime command organisations.<ref>Thomas-Durrell Young, 1997, p.18</ref>\n\nOriginally, LANDCENT command was to be rotated between German and Dutch generals.  In 1996, The commander of [[United States Army Europe|US Army Europe]] (USAREUR) assumed an additional role as commander of LANDCENT with General [[William W. Crouch]] assuming command.  The dual command of USAREUR and LANDCENT allowed the continued integration of [[United States armed forces|American forces]] into NATO's post-Cold War structure.  In addition, an agreement was made which set out the arrangements under which the [[Eurocorps|European Corps]] (Eurocorps), consisting of units from [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgium]], [[French Armed Forces|France]], [[Bundeswehr|Germany]], [[Luxembourg Army|Luxembourg]], and [[Spanish Armed Forces|Spain]], would be made available to NATO in times of crisis.\n\nBeginning in 1993, LANDCENT provided troops in the [[Former Republic of Yugoslavia]].  In 1995, LANDCENT provided troops for the [[Implementation Force]] (IFOR) and later served as the headquarters of the [[Stabilization Force]] (SFOR) in [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]].  When NATO acted in Kosovo in 1999, LANDCENT began operations in [[Pristina]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Skopje]], [[Republic of Macedonia]] and would serve as the headquarters for the [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/fchd/issues/history_balkans.htm|title=History: Balkans|publisher=NATO}}</ref>\n\n==Reorganisation==\nThe departure from the Cold War era brought the implementation of a new NATO Integrated Military Structure and LANDCENT was formally designated  as Joint Headquarters Centre (JHQ CENT) in a ceremony held in March 2000.  The new structure, which accompanied this designation, included personnel from five additional nations: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Norway and Poland - making a total of 12 NATO Nations contributing to the Headquarters.   In July 2004, JHQ CENT was once again reorganised and designated as Component Command-Land Headquarters, Heidelberg (CC-Land HQ HD).\n\nIn 2006, NATO recognised the need for a more flexible command and control structure.  To augment the current operational level commands, NATO experimented with the use of Deployable Joint Staff Elements (DJSE).  The DJSE allow [[Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum]], [[Allied Joint Force Command Naples]], and [[Allied Joint Force Command Lisbon]] to command multiple operations from their home headquarters.  CC-Land HQ HD was chosen to test the concept, and was designated Force Command Heidelberg (HQ FC HD) in 2010.<ref name=\"History of the Headquarters\"/>  The first operation in which the DJSE played a role was commanding the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF), [[Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/fchd/issues/isaf-2010-2012.htm|title=ISAF 2010-2012}}</ref>\n\nHeadquarters Allied Force Command Heidelberg has been deactivated as part of NATO's transformation.

In addition, an agreement was made which set out the arrangements under which the [[Eurocorps|European Corps]] (Eurocorps), consisting of units from [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgium]], [[French Armed Forces|France]], [[Bundeswehr|Germany]], [[Luxembourg Army|Luxembourg]], and [[Spanish Armed Forces|Spain]], would be made available to NATO in times of crisis.\n\nBeginning in 1993, LANDCENT provided troops in the [[Former Republic of Yugoslavia]].  In 1995, LANDCENT provided troops for the [[Implementation Force]] (IFOR) and later served as the headquarters of the [[Stabilization Force]] (SFOR) in [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]].  When NATO acted in Kosovo in 1999, LANDCENT began operations in [[Pristina]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Skopje]], [[Republic of Macedonia]] and would serve as the headquarters for the [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/fchd/issues/history_balkans.htm|title=History: Balkans|publisher=NATO}}</ref>\n\n==Reorganisation==\nThe departure from the Cold War era brought the implementation of a new NATO Integrated Military Structure and LANDCENT was formally designated  as Joint Headquarters Centre (JHQ CENT) in a ceremony held in March 2000.  The new structure, which accompanied this designation, included personnel from five additional nations: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Norway and Poland - making a total of 12 NATO Nations contributing to the Headquarters.   In July 2004, JHQ CENT was once again reorganised and designated as Component Command-Land Headquarters, Heidelberg (CC-Land HQ HD).\n\nIn 2006, NATO recognised the need for a more flexible command and control structure.  To augment the current operational level commands, NATO experimented with the use of Deployable Joint Staff Elements (DJSE).  The DJSE allow [[Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum]], [[Allied Joint Force Command Naples]], and [[Allied Joint Force Command Lisbon]] to command multiple operations from their home headquarters.  CC-Land HQ HD was chosen to test the concept, and was designated Force Command Heidelberg (HQ FC HD) in 2010.<ref name=\"History of the Headquarters\"/>  The first operation in which the DJSE played a role was commanding the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF), [[Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/fchd/issues/isaf-2010-2012.htm|title=ISAF 2010-2012}}</ref>\n\nHeadquarters Allied Force Command Heidelberg has been deactivated as part of NATO's transformation.
