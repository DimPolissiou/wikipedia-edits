It aired in the [[United States]] on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on March 24, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Simpsons attend a [[Fan convention|convention]] where [[Krusty the Clown]] hosts a panel discussion about his show. After expressing frustration at fans who ask repetitive questions, he announces that \"[[Itchy & Scratchy]]\" will be [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] with the characters re-cast as females. While [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] is excited by the changes, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]], [[Nelson Muntz|Nelson]], and [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Martin Prince|Martin]] all express outrage and swear that they will never watch the show again in protest. Bart hosts a party where the boys make a point of not watching the show. However, he overhears Lisa recording a [[reaction video]] onto her phone as she watches the episode and decides to investigate. He laughs despite himself and is confronted by Lisa. When he lies to his friends about watching the episode, Lisa, having recorded his laugh, uploads the video online from her phone in revenge.\n\nLisa's video goes viral and Bart is confronted by his friends at school, who rebuke him for betraying his gender. They try to beat him up, but he takes shelter in the girls' bathroom where he meets Carmen, Erica and Piper; three sixth-grade girls. The girls call themselves \"Bossy Riot\" (a play on [[Pussy Riot]]) and carry out pranks in the name of [[feminism]]. Bart reveals himself to be El Barto and persuades them to let him join Bossy Riot by improving one of their pranks. In Bart's absence, the boys turn to Milhouse as their new leader. He forms the \"Boys' Rights Association\", or [[Men's rights activism|BRA]], and they begin pressuring Krusty into reverting the changes to Itchy & Scratchy.\n\nBart and Bossy Riot carry out a series of pranks aimed at male authority figures around Springfield, with the girls giving him a purple mask allowing him to partake in the pranks with them undetected. The townspeople are afraid and their antics make the evening news. Lisa realizes that Bart is part of Bossy Riot when she sees a loose purple yarn string from his shorts and confronts him in his room. He initially denies it but immediately admits it when she says it destroys her vision of the entire universe. She accuses him of hiding behind causes he does not believe in to carry out pranks; Bart counters that while Lisa advocates causes, she has never had the courage to take action.\n\nAt Bossy Riot's meeting, they learn that Krusty has relented to BRA and will restore the male version of Itchy & Scratchy. In retaliation, Carmen, Erica and Piper plan to destroy the \"Itchy & Scratchy\" [[master tapes]] on live television, destroying \"Itchy & Scratchy\" forever. Bart protests their actions; causing the three girls to retaliate by tying him up and escaping before Lisa finds him.\n\nBart and Lisa make their way to Krusty's studios where the girls are about to drop the tapes into a vat of nail polish remover. As Bart unsuccessfully tries to reason with them through [[mansplaining]], Lisa decides to take action, knocking the vat away at the last moment. The nail polish remover floods the studio floor and the fumes overwhelm the assembled members of BRA, causing them to break into tears. Lisa's actions are caught on camera, impressing Bossy Riot while BRA blame Milhouse for their humiliation after having their tears glycerized by the girls. As Bart says farewell to the girls, Lisa is inspired to take further action and joins Bossy Riot, while Bart agrees not to fight for causes he does not believe in. He gives Lisa his purple mask and as he watches Lisa and the girls ride away, he spray-paints a message on a wall that reads \"The patriarchy is a weiner\", implying that his time with Bossy Riot offered him more than a chance to cause mischief.\n\nDuring the credits, Bart makes peace with his friends. They ask him about his time with the girls and much to their distress, he reveals that \"they do not envy us\".\n\n==Reception==\n\"Bart vs. Itchy & Scratchy\" scored a 0.8 rating with a 4 share and was watched by 1.99 million people.<ref name=\"30.18\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-march-24-2019/|title='Madam Secretary,' '60 Minutes' adjust down, 'Shark Tank' adjusts up: Sunday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=March 26, 2019|accessdate=March 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDennis Perkins of ''[[The A.V.

''bear-thing'' or ''bear-person''}} is the main antagonist of the series. He is a strange, remote-controlled [[teddy bear]] who proclaims himself to be the headmaster of Hope's Peak Academy and initiates a life of mutual killing among the students. He has various copies of himself throughout the academy and will punish anyone that attempts to attack him or breaks the academy's rules.\n\nVisually, Monokuma is divided into two halves. Seen from the front his left half is a cute white teddy bear with black details and grey shading; his right half has black fur and adds red as a spot color applied to his eye\nto contribute to his sadistic appearance together with an evil smirk.\n\nThe identity of Monokuma's controller, as well as his motives for bringing the students together, are central to the mysteries that the students must investigate. It is revealed that Monokuma is actually a series of robots created by Monaca Towa for an army that Junko Enoshima used. In the first two games, Monokuma was used as a proxy for Junko in her trials; in ''Another Episode'', he is a series of different types of enemies; in ''Danganronpa 3'', he is under the control of Kazuo Tengan to force Ryota Mitarai into brainwashing the entire world for the sake of hope. He is the only returning character in ''Danganronpa V3'' as a part of the Ultimate Academy for Gifted Juveniles, now controlled by Tsumugi Shirogane and accompanied by the Monokuma Kubs.\n\n==''Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc''==\n<!-- The NIS America release uses \"Ultimate\" in place of \"Super High School Level\".

An ordinary high school student who was accepted to the academy by raffle. He has no spectacular talents, aside from his belief that he is a bit more optimistic than most people, and was given the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Lucky Student|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e78\u904b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"K\u014dun\"|Super High School Level Good Luck}} due to winning the lottery. Ironically, he often falls prey to bad luck more often than not. It is revealed in a short story that Makoto's luck comes from the fact that his bad luck is so powerful that it cancels the good luck of anyone around him, to the point where he managed to get a fellow Lucky Student candidate eliminated just by standing near the mailman carrying her acceptance letter. However, it is also shown that though his good luck rarely manifests, it is immensely powerful in its own right, allowing outcomes that are nearly statistically impossible to occur, such as getting the Escape Switch from the item machine or surviving his near-execution. His talent also proves instrumental in undoing Junko's plans, as his bizarre luck completely throws off her analytical abilities. While having the tendency to panic or let his emotions get the better of him, he can remain focused under pressure and shows a keen logic when piecing together mysteries. He is instrumental in solving all of the murder mysteries, and foils Monokuma's plot, earning the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Hope|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Kib\u014d\"|Super High School Level Hope}}. He manages to escape from the academy alive and joins an organization called the Future Foundation, dedicated to rebuilding the world and fighting against Junko's legacy.\n\n:During the events of ''[[Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair|Danganronpa 2]]'', he and the other survivors attempt to rehabilitate some of the Remnants of Despair by placing them inside a virtual world which would rewrite their memories of being Ultimate Despair students. However, because of a virus containing Junko's Alter Ego, the world is turned into another killing game, prompting Makoto, Kyoko and Byakuya to eventually enter the virtual world themselves to help the surviving students activate a shutdown sequence to stop Junko once and for all.

The one who was really killed was her twin sister, Mukuro Ikusaba. Her true personality is one that is constantly changing as she gets bored easily and thrives to drive people to despair.

She attempts to get the remaining students to graduate so that her personality can take over the real world bodies of those that died within the virtual world, but she is ultimately thwarted by Hajime Hinata and the other students, being destroyed when the virtual world is shut down. Her avatar appears as a fully three-dimensional giant version possessing a video cell phone that she uses to communicate with the students in the virtual world. She reveals that, after having failed twice, she doesn't feel despair at her defeat, just disappointment, which she had earlier claimed to be the one emotion that she hates above all else since it can't be used constructively in any way.\n\n;{{nihongo|Mukuro Ikusaba|\u6226\u5203 \u3080\u304f\u308d|Ikusaba Mukuro}}\n:{{voiced by|Megumi Toyoguchi|[[Amanda Celine Miller]] (game), [[Jamie Marchi]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n:The elusive sixteenth student of Hope's Peak Academy, who the others only become aware of when she is announced as the sixth murder victim.

It is revealed that Mukuro was actually Junko's twin sister and one of the Super High School Level Despair Students and was disguised as Junko at the beginning of the killing game. However, Junko became bored with the original plan and killed Mukuro on a whim after her sister betrayed her. In the alternative story depicted in the ''Danganronpa IF'' digital novel included with ''Danganronpa 2'', Mukuro is saved from being killed by Junko thanks to Makoto and decides to turn against Junko and help everyone escape from the academy alive once she realizes that Junko is beyond saving. During the novel, it is revealed that Mukuro does not share Junko's nihilist philosophy and only involved herself with Ultimate Despair because she loved Junko too much to abandon her. She also has a crush on Makoto, since he was not intimidated by her military background and talked to her like a normal person.\n\n;{{nihongo|Alter Ego|\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30a8\u30b4|Arut\u0101 Ego}}\n:{{voiced by|K\u014dki Miyata|Dorothy Elias-Fahn (game), [[Kara Edwards]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n:An [[artificial intelligence]] program left behind by Chihiro following his death.

Afterwards, Alter Ego asks Makoto and Kyoko to help connect him to the school network so he can find out more, but he is soon discovered by Monokuma and is destroyed by a bulldozer following the fourth trial. However, he manages to leave behind a virus in the network which helps save Makoto when Monokuma attempts to execute him.

However, with his investigative skills, he manages to help solve the murder mysteries, and even uncovers the truth behind Jabberwock Island being a simulated reality. He also discovers that he was originally part of the Reserve Course, a section of Hope's Peak Academy for students without Ultimate talents that was built to help save the school from its approaching bankruptcy through its exorbitant entry fees. Being heavily mocked and ridiculed for his lack of actual talent, combined with a bad incident involving Juzo Sakakura, led him to become a test subject in the Hope Cultivation Project. The experiment led to his memory and personality to be erased and replaced with one incorporating multiple Ultimate talents. Due to this combination of talents, Hajime's ability to empathize and take joy in the people around him was removed as well. Under his new persona Izuru Kamukura, the {{nihongo|Ultimate Hope|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Kib\u014d\"|Super High School Level Hope}}, he grew bored with the world due to being unable to relate to anyone and was manipulated by Junko into being present at the prototype killing game, the killing of Hope's Peak Academy's student council, where the event was blamed on him to incite the events that destroyed human civilization. Despite learning of his past and Izuru, Hajime manages to think for himself and help the others delete Alter Ego Junko. He is one of the survivors that manages to escape to the real world, deciding to live on as Hajime and look for a way to try to restore those who had died within the virtual world. He is briefly seen during the epilogue of ''Danganronpa Another Episode'' as Izuru, ripping out parts of Kurokuma and Shirokuma before he is sent to Jabberwock Island. At the end of ''Danganronpa 3: Despair Arc'', it is revealed that Izuru, having never actually been part of Ultimate Despair, had been freed of Junko's manipulations by Chiaki's death which, when combined with being blamed for the prototype killing game, caused Izuru to enact a revenge scheme that would see Junko utterly erased from existence, which succeeds when Hajime deletes Alter Ego Junko. In ''Danganronpa 3: Hope Arc'',  Hajime is revealed to have retained his own memories and the talents he gained as Izuru and used them to revive everyone who died in the virtual world, managing to stop Ryota from using his hope video before taking him with everyone towards a new future. He and his friends then broadcast a video claiming responsibility for the final killing game, freeing the Future Foundation of suspicion.\n\n;{{nihongo|Chiaki Nanami|\u4e03\u6d77 \u5343\u79cb|Nanami Chiaki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kana Hanazawa]]|[[Christine Marie Cabanos]]}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ChristineMCVA/status/435879404586020864|title=Christine M.

She accidentally kills Nagito, falling into his trap which was meant to ensure her survival alone, but she thwarts his plans by confessing her identity and offering herself to be executed by getting crushed by a [[Tetris]] block in order to save the remaining students. It is learned during the graduation that she is actually an AI program designed to observe and protect the students during the Future Foundation's experiment. However, some of her consciousness remains, allowing her to help Hajime during his conflict.

Chiaki quickly befriended Hajime and was unanimously elected class representative after bringing video games to the class to help everyone bond. However, it was because of these traits that she was chosen to be executed by Junko in order to drive the rest of her class into becoming Remnants of Despair, forced to go through a dungeon filled with deadly traps before being skewered to death. It is her death that breaks Izuru free of Junko's control, causing the once-apathetic genius to begin planning his revenge.\n:Chiaki is the only student of Class 77-B who stays dead permanently, as she was physically killed by Junko, compared to the other victims who died within the simulation, fell into comas, and were subsequently revived by Hajime. The ending of ''Danganronpa 3'' shows Hajime finally bidding farewell to the AI version of Chiaki, as he embraces and chases his own future by joining Nagito and his other classmates.\n\n;{{nihongo|Nagito Komaeda|\u72db\u679d \u51ea\u6597|Komaeda Nagito}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Megumi Ogata]]|[[Bryce Papenbrook]]}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\" />\n:Nagito is a deliberate foil to the previous protagonist, Makoto. Like Makoto, Nagito is an optimistic, subservient student who was accepted to the academy by raffle and received the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Lucky Student|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e78\u904b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"K\u014dun\"|Super High School Level Good Luck}}. Unlike Makoto, his title is more literal, as he experiences an extraordinary cycle of good and bad luck that ultimately works to his benefit when good or causes some sort of harm to him when bad. Initially thought to be a friendly, upbeat, somewhat meek young man, he is shown to be quite deranged in his pursuit of hope, believing it to be an absolute good that only his talented classmates can achieve. Because of his beliefs, he is completely willing to let his talented classmates walk over him, for he sees himself as inferior to them, all while keeping his cheerful, optimistic attitude and frequently referring to himself as a \"stepping stone for [their] hope.\" He remains cheerful and enthusiastic even in horrifying situations when someone has died, which results in his classmates fearing him and finding him creepy. He is highly unstable and suicidal, as the bad luck of his cycle causes catastrophes in his life that he believes are unavoidable; this is compounded by the fact that he has a degenerative brain disease that is slowly eating away at his ability to think rationally and which will soon kill him. He also feels deep self-loathing over his talent being, in his mind, lackluster compared to his classmates' talents. Despite his self-loathing, Nagito does still see himself as being superior to normal people, and has an intense hatred for the Reserve Course, seeing them as talentless parasites leeching off the academy. After learning that he and the other students (with the exception of Chiaki) are the members of Ultimate Despair who were responsible for the destruction of the world, he becomes aggressive and confrontational towards the others. In order to rid the island of the Ultimate Despair students, he sets up a trap for the others by setting up a scenario to looks like he committed suicide, while actually tricking Chiaki into inadvertently killing him with poison, hoping the end result will lead to the execution of all Ultimate Despair students and rescue Nanami alone. However, Hajime realizes what truly happened and Nanami takes responsibility for his death, saving the other students.\n:In ''Danganronpa Another Episode'', Nagito appears under the title of Servant (\u53ec\u4f7f\u3044 ''Meshitsukai''), serving under the Warriors of Hope who had captured him. The Warriors of Hope frequently abused him, though he took it all with a smile. It is later revealed that he was manipulating the Warriors of Hope, in order to allow Komaru to grow and defeat despair through her power of hope. Even though ''Danganronpa Another Episode'' took place during the 77th class's time as Ultimate Despair, Nagito was unique in that he still longed for hope, whereas the others were fighting for despair alone.\n:In ''Danganronpa 3'', Nagito appears with the rest of his classmates after having awoken from their comas to rescue Makoto. During the time skip between Nagito's death in the program and his appearance in ''Danganronpa 3'', he has changed his worldview and is no longer obsessed with talent or hope. He is also once again friendly with his other classmates, especially Hajime, although his fanboy-like tendencies remain, as seen in his excitement over finally meeting Makoto in person.\n\n;{{nihongo|Fuyuhiko Kuzuryu|\u4e5d\u982d\u9f8d \u51ac\u5f66|Kuzury\u016b Fuyuhiko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Kishio]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]] (game), [[Aaron Dismuke]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/07/28/danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hopes-peak-high-school-broadcast-dub-cast-announcement/|title=Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School Broadcast Dub Cast Announcement|publisher=[[Funimation]].com|date=July 28, 2016|access-date=2016-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730004611/http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/07/28/danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hopes-peak-high-school-broadcast-dub-cast-announcement/|archive-date=2016-07-30|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/steve.prince.5437/posts/10152212832069921|title=Steve Prince - Alright you Danga Rompa fans: Danga Rompa 2... {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205224804/https://www.facebook.com/steve.prince.5437/posts/10152212832069921|archive-date=2016-02-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:A wary student who is the successor of the largest [[yakuza]] family in Japan.

A soft spoken, unsure boy, Shuichi lacks the self-confidence to strive to his full potential. Though well known in the police department for solving numerous murder cases as an apprentice to his uncle, he believes he doesn't deserve his Ultimate title due to him solving cases by chance. However, after developing a close bond with Kaede, she motivates him and helps raise his self-esteem, which results in Shuichi quickly becoming a central figure during the class trials. Following Kaede's death, Shuichi becomes close with his fellow students, Kaito and Maki. Prior to entering the game, Shuichi is revealed to have been an ordinary, but sociopathic, high-school student who desired to play the role of an evil detective during the game, having concocted what he believed to be the perfect murder after watching every season of the killing game. He later survives the game alongside Maki and Himiko and resolves to discover whatever reality awaits him in the real world.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kaede Akamatsu|\u8d64\u677e \u6953|Akamatsu Kaede}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Sayaka Kanda]]}} (Japanese), [[Erika Harlacher]] (English)<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref>{{Citation|last=spikechunsoft|title=\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30ac\u30f3\u30ed\u30f3\u30d1V3\u3000\u8d64\u677e\u6953 \u5f79\u3000\u795e\u7530\u6c99\u4e5f\u52a0\u3055\u3093\u30b3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc|date=2016-09-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKmflmHmAGA|accessdate=2017-01-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404222410/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKmflmHmAGA|archive-date=2017-04-04|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ErikaHarlacher/status/881287585833787392|title=Excited to announce that I play Kaede Akamatsu in Danganronpa v3  Come get autographs and see us on a panel tomorrow at AX!!!|last=Harlacher|first=Erika|website=@ErikaHarlacher|language=en|access-date=2017-12-06}}</ref>\n:The [[false protagonist]] of ''Danganronpa V3'' whose title is {{nihongo|\"Ultimate Pianist\"|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u30d4\u30a2\u30cb\u30b9\u30c8\u300d|Ch\u014d k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Pianisuto\"}}. She is claimed to be a cheerful, optimistic hard worker with blooming talent. She is called \"piano freak\" by her friends before coming to the academy because she dedicates herself to piano so thoroughly. After winning numerous competitions, she was given her title. While encouraging the other students to trust one another and work together, she strives to get them all out of the school, repeatedly reaffirming, \u201cOnce we get out, we\u2019ll all be friends.\u201d Kaede's desperation to end the killing game drives her to concoct a plan to murder the Mastermind, seemingly leading to the death of the innocent Rantaro and resulting in her execution by hanging. In Chapter 6, it is revealed that Kaede's plan had actually failed to kill anyone, but that the Mastermind proceeded to kill Rantaro and have Kaede framed for the murder anyways. Prior to entering the game, much like everyone else, Kaede was an ordinary individual who willingly had her previous life's memories erased in order to compete on the killing show with a talent and fake background. She claimed in her interview that she would make the perfect killing game contestant, as she is sincerely misanthropic.\n\n;{{nihongo|K1-B0|\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc|K\u012bbo}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Tetsuya Kakihara]] (Japanese),}} [[Lucien Dodge]] (English)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/LucienDodge/status/881636875189878784|title=It's true!

He does not get along with Kokichi, as Kokichi often teases Keebo due to his nature of not understanding jokes and sarcasm, and often ridicules his possibilities, which annoys Keebo to no end since he is a strong defender of robot rights and an opposer of robophobia. Throughout the game, he hears a voice in his head telling him what to do, and often listens to said voice. However, after his ahoge is destroyed in Chapter 5, he ponders the nature of hope and despair and notes the absence of the voice inside his head, subsequently going on a destructive rampage and leaving Shuichi and the remaining survivors with only until dawn to unearth the Mastermind of the killing game. Keebo is later revealed to be a creation of the Danganronpa reality show production team, with his past memories of Professor Iidabashi having all been lies. Keebo temporarily becomes the playable character in Chapter 6, before having his A.I. erased and replaced with the audience to vote on the fate of the killing game show at the end of the trial. Although he survives the final trial, he launches an attack on the school and self-destructs to destroy the dome surrounding the school and execute Tsumugi, effectively making him the final casualty of the game.\n\n;{{nihongo|Maki Harukawa|\u6625\u5ddd \u9b54\u59eb|Harukawa Maki}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Maaya Sakamoto]]}} (Japanese), [[Erica Mendez]] (English)<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/tsunderica/status/881269561995087872|title=Got the okay to say that I'm Maki Harukawa in Danganronpa V3!

Throughout the game, she gradually becomes close with Shuichi and Kaito, the latter of whom she develops romantic feelings for, identifying him as the first person whom she has ever opened up to; like every other event in the game, however, this is revealed to be the result of the Danganronpa reality show's production team's machinations.

Deceptive and clever, he tends to claim he enjoys the killing game and is often at odds with the rest of the group, most notably Kaito and Maki, though his true intentions are often ambiguous due to his habit of constantly lying. Investigating his talent research room in Chapter 6 reveals Oma to be extremely intelligent, with him having correctly pinpointed the murderer, victim, and murder weapon of all previous killings up to that point. After blackmailing Kaito through saving his life, the two conspired together to create a virtually unsolvable murder and make it impossible for the game to continue. This was achieved by having Kaito crush Kokichi's body with a press machine beyond recognition, with the intent of hiding who the victim of the murder was.He is also Russian president candidate in April 2020.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kaito Momota|\u767e\u7530 \u89e3\u6597|Momota Kaito}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Ry\u014dhei Kimura]] (Japanese), [[Kyle Hebert]] (English)}}<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/kylehebert/status/913484388586864640|title=Yup, Danganronpa fans, Kaito Momota sure does sound familiar.  pic.twitter.com/PE3PubOiMJ|last=Hebert|first=Kyle|date=2017-09-28|website=@kylehebert|language=en|access-date=2017-12-06}}</ref>\n:A passionate boy whose dream is to go into space, going so far as to fabricate documents to bypass controls and become a proper astronaut at such a young age.

He quickly develops a brotherly bond with Shuichi and becomes interested in Maki in-game, going out of his way to protect them at all costs. Haunted by a chronic disease that is slowly killing him, he resolves to himself that he won't let himself die because of the killing game. Kaito murdered Kokichi at the latter's request in Chapter 5, and is sentenced to an execution in a similar fashion to that of Jin Kirigiri from the first game, but dies due to his chronic disease before he can be successfully executed. Prior to entering the killing game, Kaito appears to have had far less altruistic intentions, with him merely reiterating his desire for fame and fortune by killing on and winning the show in his interview.\n\n;{{nihongo|Tsumugi Shirogane|\u767d\u9280 \u3064\u3080\u304e|Shirogane Tsumugi}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Mikako Komatsu]] (Japanese), [[Dorothy Elias-Fahn]] (English)}}<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dfahn0.wixsite.com/website|title=Under her roles in video games, Dorothy lists \"Tsumugi in Danganronpa V3|last=Elias-Fahn|first=Dorothy|work=Dorothy Elias-Fahn official website|access-date=2017-12-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206202622/https://dfahn0.wixsite.com/website|archive-date=2017-12-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:The main antagonist of ''Danganronpa V3''.

He has various copies of himself throughout the academy and will punish anyone that attempts to attack him or breaks the academy's rules.\n\nVisually, Monokuma is divided into two halves. Seen from the front his left half is a cute white teddy bear with black details and grey shading; his right half has black fur and adds red as a spot color applied to his eye\nto contribute to his sadistic appearance together with an evil smirk.\n\nThe identity of Monokuma's controller, as well as his motives for bringing the students together, are central to the mysteries that the students must investigate. It is revealed that Monokuma is actually a series of robots created by Monaca Towa for an army that Junko Enoshima used. In the first two games, Monokuma was used as a proxy for Junko in her trials; in ''Another Episode'', he is a series of different types of enemies; in ''Danganronpa 3'', he is under the control of Kazuo Tengan to force Ryota Mitarai into brainwashing the entire world for the sake of hope.

Ironically, he often falls prey to bad luck more often than not. It is revealed in a short story that Makoto's luck comes from the fact that his bad luck is so powerful that it cancels the good luck of anyone around him, to the point where he managed to get a fellow Lucky Student candidate eliminated just by standing near the mailman carrying her acceptance letter. However, it is also shown that though his good luck rarely manifests, it is immensely powerful in its own right, allowing outcomes that are nearly statistically impossible to occur, such as getting the Escape Switch from the item machine or surviving his near-execution. His talent also proves instrumental in undoing Junko's plans, as his bizarre luck completely throws off her analytical abilities. While having the tendency to panic or let his emotions get the better of him, he can remain focused under pressure and shows a keen logic when piecing together mysteries. He is instrumental in solving all of the murder mysteries, and foils Monokuma's plot, earning the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Hope|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Kib\u014d\"|Super High School Level Hope}}.

A charismatic [[gyaru]] fashion model who has modeled for many popular magazines. She is thought to have been killed by Monokuma near the start of the game, having been impaled by several spears after assaulting Monokuma as punishment for breaking the school rules. It is soon revealed that she is actually the true mastermind behind the events of the game, who had erased the memories of all the students and put them in this death game. The one who was really killed was her twin sister, Mukuro Ikusaba. Her true personality is one that is constantly changing as she gets bored easily and thrives to drive people to despair. The strangeness of her true persona is also compounded by her having to play the role of Monokuma, who has a drastically different personality from her own, as well as the stress of running the Mutual Killing Game by herself without any kind of support. By the time the survivors confront her, it is said that Junko has gone completely insane, her original personality long since lost in her psychosis. She is also the cause of the current state of the school and the world, having manipulated and brainwashed the school's disgruntled reserve course students into rioting over their unfair treatment, which the school desperately tried to cover up until it spilled out into the outside world and caused a worldwide uprising against those perceived as special or privileged. When her plans are foiled by Makoto's dedication to never give up hope, she begins to revel in the ultimate form of despair and commits suicide by subjecting herself to a combination of the executions she inflicted on the other students.

She attempts to get the remaining students to graduate so that her personality can take over the real world bodies of those that died within the virtual world, but she is ultimately thwarted by Hajime Hinata and the other students, being destroyed when the virtual world is shut down. Her avatar appears as a fully three-dimensional giant version possessing a video cell phone that she uses to communicate with the students in the virtual world. She reveals that, after having failed twice, she doesn't feel despair at her defeat, just disappointment, which she had earlier claimed to be the one emotion that she hates above all else since it can't be used constructively in any way.\n\n;{{nihongo|Mukuro Ikusaba|\u6226\u5203 \u3080\u304f\u308d|Ikusaba Mukuro}}\n:{{voiced by|Megumi Toyoguchi|[[Amanda Celine Miller]] (game), [[Jamie Marchi]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n:The elusive sixteenth student of Hope's Peak Academy, who the others only become aware of when she is announced as the sixth murder victim.

It is revealed that Mukuro was actually Junko's twin sister and one of the Super High School Level Despair Students and was disguised as Junko at the beginning of the killing game. However, Junko became bored with the original plan and killed Mukuro on a whim after her sister betrayed her. In the alternative story depicted in the ''Danganronpa IF'' digital novel included with ''Danganronpa 2'', Mukuro is saved from being killed by Junko thanks to Makoto and decides to turn against Junko and help everyone escape from the academy alive once she realizes that Junko is beyond saving. During the novel, it is revealed that Mukuro does not share Junko's nihilist philosophy and only involved herself with Ultimate Despair because she loved Junko too much to abandon her. She also has a crush on Makoto, since he was not intimidated by her military background and talked to her like a normal person.\n\n;{{nihongo|Alter Ego|\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30a8\u30b4|Arut\u0101 Ego}}\n:{{voiced by|K\u014dki Miyata|Dorothy Elias-Fahn (game), [[Kara Edwards]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n:An [[artificial intelligence]] program left behind by Chihiro following his death. He generally speaks with Chihiro's voice and likeness, but can also imitate other students.

Afterwards, Alter Ego asks Makoto and Kyoko to help connect him to the school network so he can find out more, but he is soon discovered by Monokuma and is destroyed by a bulldozer following the fourth trial. However, he manages to leave behind a virus in the network which helps save Makoto when Monokuma attempts to execute him.

However, with his investigative skills, he manages to help solve the murder mysteries, and even uncovers the truth behind Jabberwock Island being a simulated reality. He also discovers that he was originally part of the Reserve Course, a section of Hope's Peak Academy for students without Ultimate talents that was built to help save the school from its approaching bankruptcy through its exorbitant entry fees. Being heavily mocked and ridiculed for his lack of actual talent, combined with a bad incident involving Juzo Sakakura, led him to become a test subject in the Hope Cultivation Project. The experiment led to his memory and personality to be erased and replaced with one incorporating multiple Ultimate talents. Due to this combination of talents, Hajime's ability to empathize and take joy in the people around him was removed as well. Under his new persona Izuru Kamukura, the {{nihongo|Ultimate Hope|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Kib\u014d\"|Super High School Level Hope}}, he grew bored with the world due to being unable to relate to anyone and was manipulated by Junko into being present at the prototype killing game, the killing of Hope's Peak Academy's student council, where the event was blamed on him to incite the events that destroyed human civilization. Despite learning of his past and Izuru, Hajime manages to think for himself and help the others delete Alter Ego Junko. He is one of the survivors that manages to escape to the real world, deciding to live on as Hajime and look for a way to try to restore those who had died within the virtual world. He is briefly seen during the epilogue of ''Danganronpa Another Episode'' as Izuru, ripping out parts of Kurokuma and Shirokuma before he is sent to Jabberwock Island. At the end of ''Danganronpa 3: Despair Arc'', it is revealed that Izuru, having never actually been part of Ultimate Despair, had been freed of Junko's manipulations by Chiaki's death which, when combined with being blamed for the prototype killing game, caused Izuru to enact a revenge scheme that would see Junko utterly erased from existence, which succeeds when Hajime deletes Alter Ego Junko. In ''Danganronpa 3: Hope Arc'',  Hajime is revealed to have retained his own memories and the talents he gained as Izuru and used them to revive everyone who died in the virtual world, managing to stop Ryota from using his hope video before taking him with everyone towards a new future. He and his friends then broadcast a video claiming responsibility for the final killing game, freeing the Future Foundation of suspicion.\n\n;{{nihongo|Chiaki Nanami|\u4e03\u6d77 \u5343\u79cb|Nanami Chiaki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kana Hanazawa]]|[[Christine Marie Cabanos]]}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ChristineMCVA/status/435879404586020864|title=Christine M.

She is a sleepy, laid-back student who is inexperienced in the ways of the world, but very skilled at video games. Along with Hajime, she becomes a central figure of the trials. She accidentally kills Nagito, falling into his trap which was meant to ensure her survival alone, but she thwarts his plans by confessing her identity and offering herself to be executed by getting crushed by a [[Tetris]] block in order to save the remaining students. It is learned during the graduation that she is actually an AI program designed to observe and protect the students during the Future Foundation's experiment. However, some of her consciousness remains, allowing her to help Hajime during his conflict.

Chiaki quickly befriended Hajime and was unanimously elected class representative after bringing video games to the class to help everyone bond. However, it was because of these traits that she was chosen to be executed by Junko in order to drive the rest of her class into becoming Remnants of Despair, forced to go through a dungeon filled with deadly traps before being skewered to death. It is her death that breaks Izuru free of Junko's control, causing the once-apathetic genius to begin planning his revenge.\n:Chiaki is the only student of Class 77-B who stays dead permanently, as she was physically killed by Junko, compared to the other victims who died within the simulation, fell into comas, and were subsequently revived by Hajime. The ending of ''Danganronpa 3'' shows Hajime finally bidding farewell to the AI version of Chiaki, as he embraces and chases his own future by joining Nagito and his other classmates.\n\n;{{nihongo|Nagito Komaeda|\u72db\u679d \u51ea\u6597|Komaeda Nagito}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Megumi Ogata]]|[[Bryce Papenbrook]]}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\" />\n:Nagito is a deliberate foil to the previous protagonist, Makoto. Like Makoto, Nagito is an optimistic, subservient student who was accepted to the academy by raffle and received the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Lucky Student|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e78\u904b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"K\u014dun\"|Super High School Level Good Luck}}. Unlike Makoto, his title is more literal, as he experiences an extraordinary cycle of good and bad luck that ultimately works to his benefit when good or causes some sort of harm to him when bad. Initially thought to be a friendly, upbeat, somewhat meek young man, he is shown to be quite deranged in his pursuit of hope, believing it to be an absolute good that only his talented classmates can achieve. Because of his beliefs, he is completely willing to let his talented classmates walk over him, for he sees himself as inferior to them, all while keeping his cheerful, optimistic attitude and frequently referring to himself as a \"stepping stone for [their] hope.\" He remains cheerful and enthusiastic even in horrifying situations when someone has died, which results in his classmates fearing him and finding him creepy. He is highly unstable and suicidal, as the bad luck of his cycle causes catastrophes in his life that he believes are unavoidable; this is compounded by the fact that he has a degenerative brain disease that is slowly eating away at his ability to think rationally and which will soon kill him. He also feels deep self-loathing over his talent being, in his mind, lackluster compared to his classmates' talents. Despite his self-loathing, Nagito does still see himself as being superior to normal people, and has an intense hatred for the Reserve Course, seeing them as talentless parasites leeching off the academy. After learning that he and the other students (with the exception of Chiaki) are the members of Ultimate Despair who were responsible for the destruction of the world, he becomes aggressive and confrontational towards the others. In order to rid the island of the Ultimate Despair students, he sets up a trap for the others by setting up a scenario to looks like he committed suicide, while actually tricking Chiaki into inadvertently killing him with poison, hoping the end result will lead to the execution of all Ultimate Despair students and rescue Nanami alone. However, Hajime realizes what truly happened and Nanami takes responsibility for his death, saving the other students.\n:In ''Danganronpa Another Episode'', Nagito appears under the title of Servant (\u53ec\u4f7f\u3044 ''Meshitsukai''), serving under the Warriors of Hope who had captured him. The Warriors of Hope frequently abused him, though he took it all with a smile. It is later revealed that he was manipulating the Warriors of Hope, in order to allow Komaru to grow and defeat despair through her power of hope. Even though ''Danganronpa Another Episode'' took place during the 77th class's time as Ultimate Despair, Nagito was unique in that he still longed for hope, whereas the others were fighting for despair alone.\n:In ''Danganronpa 3'', Nagito appears with the rest of his classmates after having awoken from their comas to rescue Makoto. During the time skip between Nagito's death in the program and his appearance in ''Danganronpa 3'', he has changed his worldview and is no longer obsessed with talent or hope. He is also once again friendly with his other classmates, especially Hajime, although his fanboy-like tendencies remain, as seen in his excitement over finally meeting Makoto in person.\n\n;{{nihongo|Fuyuhiko Kuzuryu|\u4e5d\u982d\u9f8d \u51ac\u5f66|Kuzury\u016b Fuyuhiko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Kishio]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]] (game), [[Aaron Dismuke]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/07/28/danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hopes-peak-high-school-broadcast-dub-cast-announcement/|title=Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School Broadcast Dub Cast Announcement|publisher=[[Funimation]].com|date=July 28, 2016|access-date=2016-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730004611/http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/07/28/danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hopes-peak-high-school-broadcast-dub-cast-announcement/|archive-date=2016-07-30|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/steve.prince.5437/posts/10152212832069921|title=Steve Prince - Alright you Danga Rompa fans: Danga Rompa 2... {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205224804/https://www.facebook.com/steve.prince.5437/posts/10152212832069921|archive-date=2016-02-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:A wary student who is the successor of the largest [[yakuza]] family in Japan.

A soft spoken, unsure boy, Shuichi lacks the self-confidence to strive to his full potential. Though well known in the police department for solving numerous murder cases as an apprentice to his uncle, he believes he doesn't deserve his Ultimate title due to him solving cases by chance. However, after developing a close bond with Kaede, she motivates him and helps raise his self-esteem, which results in Shuichi quickly becoming a central figure during the class trials. Following Kaede's death, Shuichi becomes close with his fellow students, Kaito and Maki. Prior to entering the game, Shuichi is revealed to have been an ordinary, but sociopathic, high-school student who desired to play the role of an evil detective during the game, having concocted what he believed to be the perfect murder after watching every season of the killing game. He later survives the game alongside Maki and Himiko and resolves to discover whatever reality awaits him in the real world.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kaede Akamatsu|\u8d64\u677e \u6953|Akamatsu Kaede}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Sayaka Kanda]]}} (Japanese), [[Erika Harlacher]] (English)<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref>{{Citation|last=spikechunsoft|title=\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30ac\u30f3\u30ed\u30f3\u30d1V3\u3000\u8d64\u677e\u6953 \u5f79\u3000\u795e\u7530\u6c99\u4e5f\u52a0\u3055\u3093\u30b3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc|date=2016-09-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKmflmHmAGA|accessdate=2017-01-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404222410/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKmflmHmAGA|archive-date=2017-04-04|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ErikaHarlacher/status/881287585833787392|title=Excited to announce that I play Kaede Akamatsu in Danganronpa v3  Come get autographs and see us on a panel tomorrow at AX!!!|last=Harlacher|first=Erika|website=@ErikaHarlacher|language=en|access-date=2017-12-06}}</ref>\n:The [[false protagonist]] of ''Danganronpa V3'' whose title is {{nihongo|\"Ultimate Pianist\"|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u30d4\u30a2\u30cb\u30b9\u30c8\u300d|Ch\u014d k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Pianisuto\"}}. She is claimed to be a cheerful, optimistic hard worker with blooming talent. She is called \"piano freak\" by her friends before coming to the academy because she dedicates herself to piano so thoroughly. After winning numerous competitions, she was given her title. While encouraging the other students to trust one another and work together, she strives to get them all out of the school, repeatedly reaffirming, \u201cOnce we get out, we\u2019ll all be friends.\u201d Kaede's desperation to end the killing game drives her to concoct a plan to murder the Mastermind, seemingly leading to the death of the innocent Rantaro and resulting in her execution by hanging. In Chapter 6, it is revealed that Kaede's plan had actually failed to kill anyone, but that the Mastermind proceeded to kill Rantaro and have Kaede framed for the murder anyways. Prior to entering the game, much like everyone else, Kaede was an ordinary individual who willingly had her previous life's memories erased in order to compete on the killing show with a talent and fake background. She claimed in her interview that she would make the perfect killing game contestant, as she is sincerely misanthropic.\n\n;{{nihongo|K1-B0|\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc|K\u012bbo}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Tetsuya Kakihara]] (Japanese),}} [[Lucien Dodge]] (English)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/LucienDodge/status/881636875189878784|title=It's true!

He does not get along with Kokichi, as Kokichi often teases Keebo due to his nature of not understanding jokes and sarcasm, and often ridicules his possibilities, which annoys Keebo to no end since he is a strong defender of robot rights and an opposer of robophobia. Throughout the game, he hears a voice in his head telling him what to do, and often listens to said voice. However, after his ahoge is destroyed in Chapter 5, he ponders the nature of hope and despair and notes the absence of the voice inside his head, subsequently going on a destructive rampage and leaving Shuichi and the remaining survivors with only until dawn to unearth the Mastermind of the killing game. Keebo is later revealed to be a creation of the Danganronpa reality show production team, with his past memories of Professor Iidabashi having all been lies. Keebo temporarily becomes the playable character in Chapter 6, before having his A.I. erased and replaced with the audience to vote on the fate of the killing game show at the end of the trial. Although he survives the final trial, he launches an attack on the school and self-destructs to destroy the dome surrounding the school and execute Tsumugi, effectively making him the final casualty of the game.\n\n;{{nihongo|Maki Harukawa|\u6625\u5ddd \u9b54\u59eb|Harukawa Maki}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Maaya Sakamoto]]}} (Japanese), [[Erica Mendez]] (English)<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/tsunderica/status/881269561995087872|title=Got the okay to say that I'm Maki Harukawa in Danganronpa V3!

Throughout the game, she gradually becomes close with Shuichi and Kaito, the latter of whom she develops romantic feelings for, identifying him as the first person whom she has ever opened up to; like every other event in the game, however, this is revealed to be the result of the Danganronpa reality show's production team's machinations.

Deceptive and clever, he tends to claim he enjoys the killing game and is often at odds with the rest of the group, most notably Kaito and Maki, though his true intentions are often ambiguous due to his habit of constantly lying. Investigating his talent research room in Chapter 6 reveals Oma to be extremely intelligent, with him having correctly pinpointed the murderer, victim, and murder weapon of all previous killings up to that point. After blackmailing Kaito through saving his life, the two conspired together to create a virtually unsolvable murder and make it impossible for the game to continue. This was achieved by having Kaito crush Kokichi's body with a press machine beyond recognition, with the intent of hiding who the victim of the murder was.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kaito Momota|\u767e\u7530 \u89e3\u6597|Momota Kaito}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Ry\u014dhei Kimura]] (Japanese), [[Kyle Hebert]] (English)}}<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/kylehebert/status/913484388586864640|title=Yup, Danganronpa fans, Kaito Momota sure does sound familiar.  pic.twitter.com/PE3PubOiMJ|last=Hebert|first=Kyle|date=2017-09-28|website=@kylehebert|language=en|access-date=2017-12-06}}</ref>\n:A passionate boy whose dream is to go into space, going so far as to fabricate documents to bypass controls and become a proper astronaut at such a young age.

He quickly develops a brotherly bond with Shuichi and becomes interested in Maki in-game, going out of his way to protect them at all costs. Haunted by a chronic disease that is slowly killing him, he resolves to himself that he won't let himself die because of the killing game. Kaito murdered Kokichi at the latter's request in Chapter 5, and is sentenced to an execution in a similar fashion to that of Jin Kirigiri from the first game, but dies due to his chronic disease before he can be successfully executed. Prior to entering the killing game, Kaito appears to have had far less altruistic intentions, with him merely reiterating his desire for fame and fortune by killing on and winning the show in his interview.\n\n;{{nihongo|Tsumugi Shirogane|\u767d\u9280 \u3064\u3080\u304e|Shirogane Tsumugi}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Mikako Komatsu]] (Japanese), [[Dorothy Elias-Fahn]] (English)}}<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dfahn0.wixsite.com/website|title=Under her roles in video games, Dorothy lists \"Tsumugi in Danganronpa V3|last=Elias-Fahn|first=Dorothy|work=Dorothy Elias-Fahn official website|access-date=2017-12-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206202622/https://dfahn0.wixsite.com/website|archive-date=2017-12-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:The main antagonist of ''Danganronpa V3''.

While one formula is referred to by multiple names, multiple formulas are referred to by one notation (e.g., alphas and omegas).

They did not give the reliability coefficients particular names. Equation 20 in their article is <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. This formula is often referred to as Kuder-Richardson Formula 20, or KR-20. They dealt with cases where the observed scores were dichotomous (e.g., correct or incorrect), so the expression of KR-20 is slightly different from the conventional formula of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. A review of this paper reveals that they did not present a general formula because they did not need to, not because they were not able to. Let <math>p_i</math> denote the correct answer ratio of item <math>i </math>, and <math>q_i</math> denote the incorrect answer ratio of item <math>i</math> (<math>p_i + q_i = 1 </math>).

He was concerned that it was not known how much <math> \\rho_{T} </math> underestimated reliability. He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies had published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability. Non-experts could misunderstand that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> was a general reliability coefficient that could be used for all data regardless of prerequisites. \n\nThird, he did not explain why he changed his attitude toward <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. In particular, he did not provide a clear answer to the underestimation problem of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, which he himself<ref name = c1943 /> had criticized. \n\nFourth, he argued that a high value of <math>\\rho_{T}</math> indicated homogeneity of the data.\n\n===After 1951===\nNovick and Lewis (1967)<ref name = NL>Novick, M.

He explained that he had originally planned to name other types of reliability coefficients (e.g., inter-rater reliability or test-retest reliability) in consecutive Greek letter (e.g., <math>\\beta</math>, <math>\\gamma</math>, <math>\\ldots</math>), but later changed his mind.\n\nCronbach and Schavelson (2004)<ref name = c2004>Cronbach, L.

The term is sometimes used to refer to a certain kind of reliability (e.g., internal consistency reliability), but it is unclear exactly which reliability coefficients are included here, in addition to <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach/> used the term in several senses without an explicit definition. Cho and Kim (2015)<ref name = ChoKim/> showed that <math> \\rho_{T}</math> is not an indicator of any of these.\n===Removing items using \"alpha if item deleted\" always increases reliability===\nRemoving an item using \"alpha if item deleted\" may result in 'alpha inflation,' where sample-level reliability is reported to be higher than population-level reliability.<ref name=KL>Kopalle, P. K., & Lehmann, D. R. (1997). Alpha inflation? The impact of eliminating scale items on Cronbach\u2019s alpha.

It is also recommended that the whole sample be divided into two and cross-validated.<ref name=KL/>\n\n== Ideal reliability level and how to increase reliability ==\n=== Nunnally's recommendations for the level of reliability===\nThe most frequently cited source of how much reliability coefficients should be is Nunnally's book.<ref name=n1>Nunnally, J. C. (1967). Psychometric theory. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref><ref name=n2>Nunnally, J. C. (1978). Psychometric theory (2nd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref><ref name=n3>Nunnally, J. C., & Bernstein, I. H. (1994). Psychometric theory (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> However, his recommendations are cited contrary to his intentions. What he meant was to apply different criteria depending on the purpose or stage of the study. However, regardless of the nature of the research, such as exploratory research, applied research, and scale development research, a criterion of .7 is universally used<ref name=LBM>Lance, C. E., Butts, M. M., & Michels, L. C. (2006). What did they really say? Organizational Research Methods, 9(2), 202\u2013220. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428105284919</ref>. .7 is the criterion he recommended for the early stages of a study, which most studies published in the journal are not. Rather than .7, the criterion of .8 referred to applied research by Nunnally is more appropriate for most empirical studies.<ref name=LBM/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\n|+ Nunnally's recommendations on the level of reliability\n|-\n!   !! 1st edition<ref name=n1/> !! 2nd<ref name=n2/> & 3rd<ref name=n3/> edition\n|-\n| Early stage of research|| .5 or .6 || .7\n|-\n| Applied research|| .8 || .8\n|-\n| When making important decisions || .95 (minimum .9) || .95 (minimum .9)\n|}\n\nHis recommendation level did not imply a cutoff point. If a criterion means a cutoff point, it is important whether or not it is met, but it is unimportant how much it is over or under. He did not mean that it should be strictly .8 when referring to the criteria of .8. If the reliability has a value near .8 (e.g., 78), it can be considered that his recommendation has been met.<ref name = c2020>Cho, E. (2020). A comprehensive review of so-called Cronbach's alpha. Journal of Product Research, 38(1), 9\u201320.</ref>\n\nHis idea was that there is a cost to increasing reliability, so there is no need to try to obtain maximum reliability in every situation.\n\n===Cost to obtain a high level of reliability===\nMany textbooks explain that the higher the value of reliability, the better. The potential side effects of high reliability are rarely discussed. However, the principle of sacrificing something to get one also applies to reliability.\n====Trade-off between reliability and validity<ref name = ChoKim/>====\nMeasurements with perfect reliability lack validity. For example, a person who take the test with the reliability of one will get a perfect score or a zero score, because the examinee who give the correct answer or incorrect answer on one item will give the correct answer or incorrect answer on all other items. The phenomenon in which validity is sacrificed to increase reliability is called attenuation paradox.<ref>Loevinger, J. (1954). The attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 51(5), 493\u2013504. https://doi.org/10.1002/j.2333-8504.1954.tb00485.x</ref><ref>Humphreys, L. (1956). The normal curve and the attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 53(6), 472\u2013476. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0041091</ref>\n\nA high value of reliability can be in conflict with content validity. For high content validity, each item should be constructed to be able to comprehensively represent the content to be measured. However, a strategy of repeatedly measuring essentially the same question in different ways is often used only for the purpose of increasing reliability.<ref>Boyle, G. J. (1991). Does item homogeneity indicate internal consistency or item redundancy in psychometric scales?

However, the increase in the number of items hinders the efficiency of measurements.\n===Methods to increase reliability ===\nDespite the costs associated with increasing reliability discussed above, a high level of reliability may be required. The following methods can be considered to increase reliability.\n====Before data collection====\nEliminate the ambiguity of the measurement item.\n\nDo not measure what the respondents do not know.\n\nIncrease the number of items. However, care should be taken not to excessively inhibit the efficiency of the measurement.\n\nUse a scale that is known to be highly reliable.<ref>Lee, H. (2017). Research Methodology (2nd ed.), Hakhyunsa.</ref>\n\nConduct a pretest. Discover in advance the problem of reliability.\n\nExclude or modify items that are different in content or form from other items (e.g., reversely scored items).\n====After data collection====\nRemove the problematic items using \"alpha if item deleted\". However, this deletion should be accompanied by a theoretical rationale.\n\nUse a more accurate reliability coefficient than <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. For example, <math>\\rho_{C}</math> is .02 larger than <math>\\rho_{T}</math> on average.<ref name=PK/>\n==Which reliability coefficient to use==\n===Should we continue to use tau-equivalent reliability?===\n<math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> is used in an overwhelming proportion. A study estimates that approximately 97% of studies use <math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> as a reliability coefficient<ref name = Cho/>. \n\nHowever, simulation studies comparing the accuracy of several reliability coefficients have led to the common result that <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math> is an inaccurate reliability coefficient.<ref name=KTD>Kamata, A., Turhan, A., & Darandari, E.

However, different opinions are given on which reliability coefficient should be used instead of <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>.\n\nDifferent reliability coefficients ranked first in each simulation study<ref name=KTD/><ref name=Osburn/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=TC/><ref name=VVS/> comparing the accuracy of several reliability coefficients.<ref name=ChoKim/>\n\nThe majority opinion is to use SEM-based reliability coefficients as an alternative to <math> {\\rho} _ {T} </math>.<ref name=Cho/><ref name=ChoKim/><ref name=DBB/><ref name=GY/><ref name=Peters/><ref name=RM/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=YG/>\n\nHowever, there is no consensus on which of the several SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., unidimensional or multidimensional models) is the best to use.\n\nSome people say <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math><ref name=RZ/> as an alternative, but <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> shows information that is completely different from reliability. <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> is a type of coefficient comparable to Revelle's <math>\\beta</math>.<ref name=Revelle/><ref name=RZ/> They do not substitute, but complement reliability.<ref name=Cho/>\n\nAmong SEM-based reliability coefficients, multidimensional reliability coefficients are rarely used, and the most commonly used is <math>{\\rho}_{C}</math> .<ref name = Cho/>\n===Software for SEM-based reliability coefficients===\nGeneral-purpose statistical software such as SPSS and SAS include a function to calculate <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>. Users who don't know the formula of <math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> have no problem in obtaining the estimates with just a few mouse clicks. \n\nSEM software such as AMOS, LISREL, and MPLUS does not have a function to calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients. Users need to calculate the result by inputting it to the formula. To avoid this inconvenience and possible error, even studies reporting the use of SEM rely on <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math> instead of SEM-based reliability coefficients.<ref name = Cho/> There are a few alternatives to automatically calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients.\n\n1) R (free): The psych package <ref>http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf</ref> calculates various reliability coefficients.\n\n2) EQS (paid)<ref>http://www.mvsoft.com/eqs60.htm</ref>: This SEM software has a function to calculate reliability coefficients.\n\n3) RelCalc (free)<ref name = Cho/>: Available with Microsoft Excel. <Math>\\rho_C</math> can be obtained without the need for SEM software. Various multidimensional SEM reliability coefficients and various types of <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> can be calculated based on the results of SEM software.\n\n==Derivation of formula<ref name=Cho/>==\nAssumption 1. The observed score of an item consists of the true score of the item and the error of the item, which is independent of the true score. <math>X_i=T_i+e_i</math>\n\nLemma. <math>Cov(T_i,e_i)=Cov(T_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 2. Errors are independent of each other. <math>Cov(e_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 3. (The assumption of being essentially tau-equivalent) The true score of an item consists of the true score common to all items and the constant of the item. <math>T_i=\\mu_i + t</math>\n\nLet <math>T</math> denote the sum of the item true scores. <math>T=\\sum_{i=1}^k T_i</math>\n\nThe variance of <math>T</math> is called the true score variance.\n\nDefinition. Reliability is the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance. <math>\\rho={\\sigma^2_T \\over \\sigma^2_X}</math>\n\nThe following relationship is established from the above assumptions.\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_i=Var(\\mu_i + t+e_i)=\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_i} (\\because Var(\\mu_i)=Cov(t,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,t)=0)</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma_{ij}=Cov(T_i+e_i, T_j+e_j)=\\sigma^2_t (\\because Cov(T_i,e_j)=Cov(T_j,e_i)=Cov(e_i,e_j)=0)</math>\n\nTherefore, the covariance matrix between items is as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>\\ldots</math>\n! <math>X_k</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_1}</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>||<math>\\ldots</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_2}</math>|| <math>\\ldots</math>|| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>\\vdots</math>\n| <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\ddots</math>|| <math>\\vdots</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_k</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\ldots</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_k}</math>\n|-\n\n|}\nYou can see that <math> \\sigma^2_t</math> equals the mean of the covariances between items.

For example, the following data satisfy the parallel condition. In parallel data, even if a correlation matrix is used instead of a covariance matrix, there is no loss of information.

Conventional names give no information about the nature of each coefficient, or give misleading information (e.g., composite reliability). Conventional names are inconsistent. Some are formulas, and others are coefficients. Some are named after the original developer, some are named after someone who is not the original developer, and others do not include the name of any person. While one formula is referred to by multiple names, multiple formulas are referred to by one notation (e.g., alphas and omegas).

They did not give the reliability coefficients particular names. Equation 20 in their article is <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. This formula is often referred to as Kuder-Richardson Formula 20, or KR-20.

A review of this paper reveals that they did not present a general formula because they did not need to, not because they were not able to.

Gulliksen<ref name = Gulliksen/> also admitted that the two formulas are \u201cidentical\u201d(p.224). \n\nEven studies critical of KR-20 did not point out that the original formula of KR-20 could only be applied to dichotomous data.<ref name=c1943>Cronbach, L.

Note on a simplified method of computing test reliability: Educational and Psychological Measurement, 1(1). https://doi.org/10.1177/001316444100100109</ref> argued that this characteristic alone made <math> \\rho_{T}</math> more recommendable than the traditional split-half technique, which was unknown whether to underestimate or overestimate reliability.\n\nCronbach (1943)<ref name =c1943/> was critical of the underestimation of <math> \\rho_{T} </math>. He was concerned that it was not known how much <math> \\rho_{T} </math> underestimated reliability. He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies had published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability. Non-experts could misunderstand that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> was a general reliability coefficient that could be used for all data regardless of prerequisites. \n\nThird, he did not explain why he changed his attitude toward <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. In particular, he did not provide a clear answer to the underestimation problem of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, which he himself<ref name = c1943 /> had criticized. \n\nFourth, he argued that a high value of <math>\\rho_{T}</math> indicated homogeneity of the data.\n\n===After 1951===\nNovick and Lewis (1967)<ref name = NL>Novick, M.

He explained that he had originally planned to name other types of reliability coefficients (e.g., inter-rater reliability or test-retest reliability) in consecutive Greek letter (e.g., <math>\\beta</math>, <math>\\gamma</math>, <math>\\ldots</math>), but later changed his mind.\n\nCronbach and Schavelson (2004)<ref name = c2004>Cronbach, L.

He opposed the use of the name Cronbach's alpha. He explicitly denied the existence of existing studies that had published the general formula of KR-20 prior to Cronbach (1951).\n\n== Common misconceptions about tau-equivalent reliability<ref name=ChoKim/>==\n===The value of tau-equivalent reliability ranges between zero and one===\nBy definition, reliability cannot be less than zero and cannot be greater than one. Many textbooks mistakenly equate <math> \\rho_{T}</math> with reliability and give an inaccurate explanation of its range. <math>\\rho_{T}</math> is less than reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by -1. The covariance matrix between items is as follows, <math> \\rho_{T}=-3 </math>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>1</math>||<math>1</math>||<math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>1</math> || <math>1</math>|| <math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>-1</math> || <math>-1</math> || <math>1</math>\n|}\nNegative <math>\\rho_{T}</math> can occur for reasons such as negative discrimination or mistakes in processing reversely scored items.\n\nUnlike <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., <math>\\rho_{C}</math>) are always greater than or equal to zero.\n\nThis anomaly was first pointed out by Cronbach (1943)<ref name=c1943/> to criticize <math> \\rho_{T}</math>, but Cronbach (1951)<ref name=Cronbach/> did not comment on this problem in his article, which Cronbach and Shavelson (2004) himself<ref name=c2004/> described as being \"encyclopedic\" (p.396).\n\n=== If there is no measurement error, the value of tau-equivalent reliability is one===\nThis anomaly also originates from the fact that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> underestimates reliability. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by two.

This misconception stems from the inaccurate explanation of Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> that high <math>\\rho_{T}</math> values show homogeneity between the items. Homogeneity is a term that is rarely used in the modern literature, and related studies interpret the term as referring to unidimensionality.

The term is sometimes used to refer to a certain kind of reliability (e.g., internal consistency reliability), but it is unclear exactly which reliability coefficients are included here, in addition to <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach/> used the term in several senses without an explicit definition. Cho and Kim (2015)<ref name = ChoKim/> showed that <math> \\rho_{T}</math> is not an indicator of any of these.\n===Removing items using \"alpha if item deleted\" always increases reliability===\nRemoving an item using \"alpha if item deleted\" may result in 'alpha inflation,' where sample-level reliability is reported to be higher than population-level reliability.<ref name=KL>Kopalle, P.

C., & Bernstein, I. H. (1994). Psychometric theory (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> However, his recommendations are cited contrary to his intentions. What he meant was to apply different criteria depending on the purpose or stage of the study. However, regardless of the nature of the research, such as exploratory research, applied research, and scale development research, a criterion of .7 is universally used<ref name=LBM>Lance, C. E., Butts, M. M., & Michels, L. C. (2006). What did they really say? Organizational Research Methods, 9(2), 202\u2013220. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428105284919</ref>. .7 is the criterion he recommended for the early stages of a study, which most studies published in the journal are not. Rather than .7, the criterion of .8 referred to applied research by Nunnally is more appropriate for most empirical studies.<ref name=LBM/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\n|+ Nunnally's recommendations on the level of reliability\n|-\n!   !! 1st edition<ref name=n1/> !! 2nd<ref name=n2/> & 3rd<ref name=n3/> edition\n|-\n| Early stage of research|| .5 or .6 || .7\n|-\n| Applied research|| .8 || .8\n|-\n| When making important decisions || .95 (minimum .9) || .95 (minimum .9)\n|}\n\nHis recommendation level did not imply a cutoff point. If a criterion means a cutoff point, it is important whether or not it is met, but it is unimportant how much it is over or under. He did not mean that it should be strictly .8 when referring to the criteria of .8. If the reliability has a value near .8 (e.g., 78), it can be considered that his recommendation has been met.<ref name = c2020>Cho, E. (2020). A comprehensive review of so-called Cronbach's alpha. Journal of Product Research, 38(1), 9\u201320.</ref>\n\nHis idea was that there is a cost to increasing reliability, so there is no need to try to obtain maximum reliability in every situation.\n\n===Cost to obtain a high level of reliability===\nMany textbooks explain that the higher the value of reliability, the better. The potential side effects of high reliability are rarely discussed. However, the principle of sacrificing something to get one also applies to reliability.\n====Trade-off between reliability and validity<ref name = ChoKim/>====\nMeasurements with perfect reliability lack validity. For example, a person who take the test with the reliability of one will get a perfect score or a zero score, because the examinee who give the correct answer or incorrect answer on one item will give the correct answer or incorrect answer on all other items. The phenomenon in which validity is sacrificed to increase reliability is called attenuation paradox.<ref>Loevinger, J. (1954). The attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 51(5), 493\u2013504. https://doi.org/10.1002/j.2333-8504.1954.tb00485.x</ref><ref>Humphreys, L. (1956). The normal curve and the attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 53(6), 472\u2013476. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0041091</ref>\n\nA high value of reliability can be in conflict with content validity. For high content validity, each item should be constructed to be able to comprehensively represent the content to be measured. However, a strategy of repeatedly measuring essentially the same question in different ways is often used only for the purpose of increasing reliability.<ref>Boyle, G. J. (1991). Does item homogeneity indicate internal consistency or item redundancy in psychometric scales?

However, the increase in the number of items hinders the efficiency of measurements.\n===Methods to increase reliability ===\nDespite the costs associated with increasing reliability discussed above, a high level of reliability may be required. The following methods can be considered to increase reliability.\n====Before data collection====\nEliminate the ambiguity of the measurement item.\n\nDo not measure what the respondents do not know.\n\nIncrease the number of items. However, care should be taken not to excessively inhibit the efficiency of the measurement.\n\nUse a scale that is known to be highly reliable.<ref>Lee, H. (2017). Research Methodology (2nd ed.), Hakhyunsa.</ref>\n\nConduct a pretest. Discover in advance the problem of reliability.\n\nExclude or modify items that are different in content or form from other items (e.g., reversely scored items).\n====After data collection====\nRemove the problematic items using \"alpha if item deleted\". However, this deletion should be accompanied by a theoretical rationale.\n\nUse a more accurate reliability coefficient than <math>\\rho_{T}</math>.

However, different opinions are given on which reliability coefficient should be used instead of <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>.\n\nDifferent reliability coefficients ranked first in each simulation study<ref name=KTD/><ref name=Osburn/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=TC/><ref name=VVS/> comparing the accuracy of several reliability coefficients.<ref name=ChoKim/>\n\nThe majority opinion is to use SEM-based reliability coefficients as an alternative to <math> {\\rho} _ {T} </math>.<ref name=Cho/><ref name=ChoKim/><ref name=DBB/><ref name=GY/><ref name=Peters/><ref name=RM/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=YG/>\n\nHowever, there is no consensus on which of the several SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., unidimensional or multidimensional models) is the best to use.\n\nSome people say <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math><ref name=RZ/> as an alternative, but <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> shows information that is completely different from reliability. <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> is a type of coefficient comparable to Revelle's <math>\\beta</math>.<ref name=Revelle/><ref name=RZ/> They do not substitute, but complement reliability.<ref name=Cho/>\n\nAmong SEM-based reliability coefficients, multidimensional reliability coefficients are rarely used, and the most commonly used is <math>{\\rho}_{C}</math> .<ref name = Cho/>\n===Software for SEM-based reliability coefficients===\nGeneral-purpose statistical software such as SPSS and SAS include a function to calculate <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>. Users who don't know the formula of <math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> have no problem in obtaining the estimates with just a few mouse clicks. \n\nSEM software such as AMOS, LISREL, and MPLUS does not have a function to calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients. Users need to calculate the result by inputting it to the formula. To avoid this inconvenience and possible error, even studies reporting the use of SEM rely on <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math> instead of SEM-based reliability coefficients.<ref name = Cho/> There are a few alternatives to automatically calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients.\n\n1) R (free): The psych package <ref>http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf</ref> calculates various reliability coefficients.\n\n2) EQS (paid)<ref>http://www.mvsoft.com/eqs60.htm</ref>: This SEM software has a function to calculate reliability coefficients.\n\n3) RelCalc (free)<ref name = Cho/>: Available with Microsoft Excel. <Math>\\rho_C</math> can be obtained without the need for SEM software. Various multidimensional SEM reliability coefficients and various types of <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> can be calculated based on the results of SEM software.\n\n==Derivation of formula<ref name=Cho/>==\nAssumption 1. The observed score of an item consists of the true score of the item and the error of the item, which is independent of the true score. <math>X_i=T_i+e_i</math>\n\nLemma. <math>Cov(T_i,e_i)=Cov(T_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 2. Errors are independent of each other. <math>Cov(e_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 3. (The assumption of being essentially tau-equivalent) The true score of an item consists of the true score common to all items and the constant of the item. <math>T_i=\\mu_i + t</math>\n\nLet <math>T</math> denote the sum of the item true scores. <math>T=\\sum_{i=1}^k T_i</math>\n\nThe variance of <math>T</math> is called the true score variance.\n\nDefinition. Reliability is the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance. <math>\\rho={\\sigma^2_T \\over \\sigma^2_X}</math>\n\nThe following relationship is established from the above assumptions.\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_i=Var(\\mu_i + t+e_i)=\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_i} (\\because Var(\\mu_i)=Cov(t,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,t)=0)</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma_{ij}=Cov(T_i+e_i, T_j+e_j)=\\sigma^2_t (\\because Cov(T_i,e_j)=Cov(T_j,e_i)=Cov(e_i,e_j)=0)</math>\n\nTherefore, the covariance matrix between items is as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>\\ldots</math>\n! <math>X_k</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_1}</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>||<math>\\ldots</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_2}</math>|| <math>\\ldots</math>|| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>\\vdots</math>\n| <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\ddots</math>|| <math>\\vdots</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_k</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\ldots</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_k}</math>\n|-\n\n|}\nYou can see that <math> \\sigma^2_t</math> equals the mean of the covariances between items.

{"title_page": "List of European Council meetings", "text_new": "{{Distinguish|Euro summit}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\nThis is a '''list of meetings of the European Council''' (informally referred to as '''EU summits'''); the meetings of the [[European Council]], an [[Institutions of the European Union|institution]] of the [[European Union]] (EU) comprising [[head of state|heads of state]] or [[head of government|government]] of [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]]. They started in 1975 as tri-annual meetings. The number of meetings grew to minimum four per year between 1996 and 2007, and minimum six per year since 2008. From 2008 to 2015, an average of seven council meetings per year took place (see list below).\n\nSince 2008, an annual average of two special [[Euro summit]]s were also organized in addition - and often in parallel - to the ''EU summits''. As the agenda of ''Euro summits'' is restricted solely to discuss issues for the [[eurozone]] and only invite political leaders of the [[member states of the Eurozone|eurozone member states]], such meetings are not counted as European Councils.\n\n==List==\nThe first seven summit meetings were held between 1961 and 1974, but this was before the formal establishment of the European Council. Some sources however consider them to be the informal seven first meetings of the European Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/librairie/PDF/QC3111406ENC.pdf|title=The European Council: 50 years of summit meetings|format=PDF|publisher=General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union|date=17 December 2010|accessdate=6 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1975\u20132009===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! #\n! style=\"width:10px\" | Year\n!

A called scheduled/informal ordinary upcoming meeting might occasionally be moved or cancelled within a short notice, with such change then being notified by the Council president through the issue of a revised calendar plan for the ordinary meetings within the semester in concern. If extra meetings are called outside the procedure of notification minimum a half year in advance, they are referred to as being \"extraordinary meetings\".\n\n==Details==\n{{Politics of the European Union}}\n\n===Cologne 1999===\nThe European Council met in [[Cologne]], Germany, on 3\u20134 June 1999 to consider issues after the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] came into force. [[Romano Prodi]] presented his plan for the future [[European Commission|Commission's]] work and reform program. The Council called for an [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|EU Charter of Fundamental Rights]].\n\nThe Council designated [[Javier Solana]] for the post of Secretary-General of the [[Council of the European Union]] (with [[Pierre de Boissieu]] as his deputy) and [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (CFSP). It decided on a common policy on Russia (first use of the CFSP). Adopted the declaration on Kosovo. In relation to the [[European Security and Defence Policy]], a major element of the CFSP, the council declared that the EU \"must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed up by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and a readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO\". ([[Saint-Malo declaration|Declared in St Malo]] by France and Great Britain)\n\n===Laeken 2001===\nThe Laeken European Council was held at the royal palace at [[Laeken]], [[Belgium]], on 14\u201315 December 2001.\n\nThe Laeken European Council dealt with:\n* New measures in the area of [[Justice and Home Affairs]]: the European arrest warrant, a common definition of \"[[terrorism]]\", and [[EUROJUST]]\n* The seats of ten new EU agencies (after hours of disagreement, the European Council failed to reach an agreement and decided to leave the decision until next year)\n* Impending introduction of Euro cash (the European Council met with the Finance ministers to consider this)\n* Progress of [[EU enlargement]]\n* The adoption of the Laeken Declaration on the Future of Europe\n\nThe Laeken Declaration on the Future of Europe established the [[Convention on the Future of Europe|European Convention]], presided over with former President of France, [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]], as President of the Convention, and former Italian Prime Minister [[Giuliano Amato]] and former Belgian Prime Minister [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] as Vice-Presidents. The Convention was tasked with drafting the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]], and would have about 60 members, drawn from national governments, national parliamentarians, the [[European Parliament]], and the [[European Commission]], and include representatives from the candidate countries. The declaration reviews the progress of European integration over the last fifty years, tracing it back to its origins in the horrors of World War&nbsp;II, and poses a number of questions to be answered by the Convention.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050316001119/http://www.eu2001.be/VE_ADV_PRESS/detail.asp?cat_code=AA&item_id=2165&sess=69789417&lang=en&reference=12-01.02-01& EU2001.be]</ref><ref>[http://ue.eu.int/Newsroom/LoadDoc.cfm?MAX=1&DOC=!!!&BID=76&DID=68758&GRP=4056&LANG=1 \"Press Releases, Council of the European Union\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207132800/http://ue.eu.int/Newsroom/LoadDoc.cfm?MAX=1&DOC=!!!&BID=76&DID=68758&GRP=4056&LANG=1 |date=7 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Euro summit]]\n* [[President of the European Council]]\n* [[Protests during the EU summit in Gothenburg 2001]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/ European Council official homepage]\n*[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/register/en/content/out/?typ=SET&i=ADV&RESULTSET=1&DOC_ID=&DOS_INTERINST=&DOC_TITLE=&CONTENTS=&DOC_SUBJECT=CONCL&DOC_DATE=&document_date_single_comparator=&document_date_single_date=&document_date_from_date=&document_date_to_date=&MEET_DATE=&meeting_date_single_comparator=&meeting_date_single_date=&meeting_date_from_date=&meeting_date_to_date=&DOC_LANCD=EN&ROWSPP=25&NRROWS=500&ORDERBY=DOC_DATE+DESC Council meeting conclusions (2004-today)] \u2013 European Council official homepage\n*[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/librairie/PDF/QC3111406ENC.pdf 50 years of summit meetings - history of European Council meetings (1961-2010)] - [[General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union|General Secretariat of the Council of the EU]]\n*[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/2011/european-council-2010/ The European Council in 2010] - annual presidential summary report of the European Council meeting activities\n*[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/2012/european-council-2011/ The European Council in 2011] - annual presidential summary report of the European Council meeting activities\n*[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/2013/european-council-2012/ The European Council in 2012] - annual presidential summary report of the European Council meeting activities\n*[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/2014/european-council-2013/ The European Council in 2013] - annual presidential summary report of the European Council meeting activities\n*[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/2015/european-council-2014/ The European Council in 2014] - annual presidential summary report of the European Council meeting activities\n*[http://www.cvce.eu/obj/list_of_summit_conferences_and_european_councils_1961_2014-en-8244b7d8-d086-450b-9b28-1478203d3b2e.html List of European Councils (1961-2014)] \u2013 [[European NAvigator]]\n\n{{European Council}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of European Council Meetings}}\n[[Category:European Council]]\n[[Category:20th-century diplomatic conferences]]\n[[Category:21st-century diplomatic conferences]]\n", "text_old": "{{Distinguish|Euro summit}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\nThis is a '''list of meetings of the European Council''' (informally referred to as '''EU summits'''); the meetings of the [[European Council]], an [[Institutions of the European Union|institution]] of the [[European Union]] (EU) comprising [[head of state|heads of state]] or [[head of government|government]] of [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]]. They started in 1975 as tri-annual meetings. The number of meetings grew to minimum four per year between 1996 and 2007, and minimum six per year since 2008. From 2008 to 2015, an average of seven council meetings per year took place (see list below).\n\nSince 2008, an annual average of two special [[Euro summit]]s were also organized in addition - and often in parallel - to the ''EU summits''. As the agenda of ''Euro summits'' is restricted solely to discuss issues for the [[eurozone]] and only invite political leaders of the [[member states of the Eurozone|eurozone member states]], such meetings are not counted as European Councils.\n\n==List==\nThe first seven summit meetings were held between 1961 and 1974, but this was before the formal establishment of the European Council.

[[Romano Prodi]] presented his plan for the future [[European Commission|Commission's]] work and reform program. The Council called for an [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|EU Charter of Fundamental Rights]].\n\nThe Council designated [[Javier Solana]] for the post of Secretary-General of the [[Council of the European Union]] (with [[Pierre de Boissieu]] as his deputy) and [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (CFSP). It decided on a common policy on Russia (first use of the CFSP). Adopted the declaration on Kosovo. In relation to the [[European Security and Defence Policy]], a major element of the CFSP, the council declared that the EU \"must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed up by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and a readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO\". ([[Saint-Malo declaration|Declared in St Malo]] by France and Great Britain)\n\n===Laeken 2001===\nThe Laeken European Council was held at the royal palace at [[Laeken]], [[Belgium]], on 14\u201315 December 2001.\n\nThe Laeken European Council dealt with:\n* New measures in the area of [[Justice and Home Affairs]]: the European arrest warrant, a common definition of \"[[terrorism]]\", and [[EUROJUST]]\n* The seats of ten new EU agencies (after hours of disagreement, the European Council failed to reach an agreement and decided to leave the decision until next year)\n* Impending introduction of Euro cash (the European Council met with the Finance ministers to consider this)\n* Progress of [[EU enlargement]]\n* The adoption of the Laeken Declaration on the Future of Europe\n\nThe Laeken Declaration on the Future of Europe established the [[Convention on the Future of Europe|European Convention]], presided over with former President of France, [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]], as President of the Convention, and former Italian Prime Minister [[Giuliano Amato]] and former Belgian Prime Minister [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] as Vice-Presidents. The Convention was tasked with drafting the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]], and would have about 60 members, drawn from national governments, national parliamentarians, the [[European Parliament]], and the [[European Commission]], and include representatives from the candidate countries. The declaration reviews the progress of European integration over the last fifty years, tracing it back to its origins in the horrors of World War&nbsp;II, and poses a number of questions to be answered by the Convention.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050316001119/http://www.eu2001.be/VE_ADV_PRESS/detail.asp?cat_code=AA&item_id=2165&sess=69789417&lang=en&reference=12-01.02-01& EU2001.be]</ref><ref>[http://ue.eu.int/Newsroom/LoadDoc.cfm?MAX=1&DOC=!!!&BID=76&DID=68758&GRP=4056&LANG=1 \"Press Releases, Council of the European Union\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207132800/http://ue.eu.int/Newsroom/LoadDoc.cfm?MAX=1&DOC=!!!&BID=76&DID=68758&GRP=4056&LANG=1 |date=7 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Euro summit]]\n* [[President of the European Council]]\n* [[Protests during the EU summit in Gothenburg 2001]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/ European Council official homepage]\n*[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/register/en/content/out/?typ=SET&i=ADV&RESULTSET=1&DOC_ID=&DOS_INTERINST=&DOC_TITLE=&CONTENTS=&DOC_SUBJECT=CONCL&DOC_DATE=&document_date_single_comparator=&document_date_single_date=&document_date_from_date=&document_date_to_date=&MEET_DATE=&meeting_date_single_comparator=&meeting_date_single_date=&meeting_date_from_date=&meeting_date_to_date=&DOC_LANCD=EN&ROWSPP=25&NRROWS=500&ORDERBY=DOC_DATE+DESC Council meeting conclusions (2004-today)] \u2013 European Council official homepage\n*[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/librairie/PDF/QC3111406ENC.pdf 50 years of summit meetings - history of European Council meetings (1961-2010)] - [[General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union|General Secretariat of the Council of the EU]]\n*[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/2011/european-council-2010/ The European Council in 2010] - annual presidential summary report of the European Council meeting activities\n*[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/2012/european-council-2011/ The European Council in 2011] - annual presidential summary report of the European Council meeting activities\n*[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/2013/european-council-2012/ The European Council in 2012] - annual presidential summary report of the European Council meeting activities\n*[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/2014/european-council-2013/ The European Council in 2013] - annual presidential summary report of the European Council meeting activities\n*[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/2015/european-council-2014/ The European Council in 2014] - annual presidential summary report of the European Council meeting activities\n*[http://www.cvce.eu/obj/list_of_summit_conferences_and_european_councils_1961_2014-en-8244b7d8-d086-450b-9b28-1478203d3b2e.html List of European Councils (1961-2014)] \u2013 [[European NAvigator]]\n\n{{European Council}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of European Council Meetings}}\n[[Category:European Council]]\n[[Category:20th-century diplomatic conferences]]\n[[Category:21st-century diplomatic conferences]]\n", "name_user": "Sigur", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e2010\u2013present:meeting ongoing, not upcoming anymore", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_Council_meetings"}

As with other IEEE 802 LANs, adapters come programmed with globally unique 48-bit [[MAC address]] so that each Ethernet station has a unique address{{Efn|In some cases, the factory-assigned address can be overridden, either to avoid an address change when an adapter is replaced or to use [[locally administered address]]es.}}. The MAC addresses are used to specify both the destination and the source of each data packet. Ethernet establishes link-level connections, which can be defined using both the destination and source addresses. On reception of a transmission, the receiver uses the destination address to determine whether the transmission is relevant to the station or should be ignored. A network interface normally does not accept packets addressed to other Ethernet stations.{{Efn|Unless it is put into [[promiscuous mode]].}}{{Efn|Of course bridges and switches will accept other addresses for forwarding the packet.}}\n\nAn EtherType field in each frame is used by the operating system on the receiving station to select the appropriate protocol module (e.g., an [[Internet Protocol]] version such as [[IPv4]]).

A scheme known as [[carrier sense multiple access with collision detection]] (CSMA/CD) governed the way the computers shared the channel. This scheme was simpler than competing Token Ring or [[Token Bus]] technologies.{{Efn|In a CSMA/CD system packets must be large enough to guarantee that the leading edge of the propagating wave of a message gets to all parts of the medium and back again before the transmitter stops transmitting, guaranteeing that [[collisions]] (two or more packets initiated within a window of time that forced them to overlap) are discovered. As a result, the minimum packet size and the physical medium's total length are closely linked.}} Computers are connected to an [[Attachment Unit Interface]] (AUI) [[transceiver]], which is in turn connected to the cable (with [[thin Ethernet]] the transceiver is usually integrated into the network adapter). While a simple passive wire is highly reliable for small networks, it is not reliable for large extended networks, where damage to the wire in a single place, or a single bad connector, can make the whole Ethernet segment unusable.{{Efn|Multipoint systems are also prone to strange failure modes when an electrical discontinuity reflects the signal in such a manner that some nodes would work properly, while others work slowly because of excessive retries or not at all.

In this topology, collisions are only possible if station and switch attempt to communicate with each other at the same time, and collisions are limited to this link. Furthermore, the [[10BASE-T]] standard introduced a [[full duplex]] mode of operation which became common with [[Fast Ethernet]] and the de facto standard with [[Gigabit Ethernet]].

Modifying Ethernet to conform to twisted pair telephone wiring already installed in commercial buildings provided another opportunity to lower costs, expand the installed base, and leverage building design, and, thus, twisted-pair Ethernet was the next logical development in the mid-1980s.\n\nEthernet on unshielded twisted-pair cables (UTP) began with [[StarLAN]] at 1&nbsp;Mbit/s in the mid-1980s. In 1987 [[SynOptics]] introduced the first twisted-pair Ethernet at 10&nbsp;Mbit/s in a star-wired cabling topology with a central hub, later called [[LattisNet]].<ref name=VonBurg2003 /><ref name=\"Spurgeon 2000\"/>{{rp|29}}<ref>\n{{cite book| title = The Triumph of Ethernet: technological communities and the battle for the LAN standard| author=Urs von Burg| publisher=Stanford University Press |year= 2001| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ooBqdIXIqbwC&pg=PA175| isbn = 0-8047-4094-1| page = 175}}\n</ref> These evolved into 10BASE-T, which was designed for point-to-point links only, and all termination was built into the device. This changed repeaters from a specialist device used at the center of large networks to a device that every twisted pair-based network with more than two machines had to use. The tree structure that resulted from this made Ethernet networks easier to maintain by preventing most faults with one peer or its associated cable from affecting other devices on the network.{{cn|date=April 2020|reason=OK, repeaters are required to deactivate ports that send excessive collisions, such as due to internal defects, or external wiring defects.

Every packet is sent to every other port on the repeater, so bandwidth and security problems are not addressed. The total throughput of the repeater is limited to that of a single link, and all links must operate at the same speed.<ref name=\"Spurgeon 2000\"/>{{rp|278}}\n\n=== {{Visible anchor|Bridging and switching}} ===<!--[[Full-duplex Ethernet]] links here-->\n[[File:Network switches.jpg|thumb|[[Patch cable]]s with [[patch field]]s of two Ethernet switches]]\n{{Main|Bridging (networking)|Network switch}}\n\nWhile repeaters can isolate some aspects of [[Ethernet segment]]s, such as cable breakages, they still forward all traffic to all Ethernet devices. The entire network is one [[collision domain]], and all hosts have to be able to detect collisions anywhere on the network. This limits the number of repeaters between the farthest nodes and creates practical limits on how many machines can communicate on an Ethernet network. Segments joined by repeaters have to all operate at the same speed, making phased-in upgrades impossible.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nTo alleviate these problems, bridging was created to communicate at the data link layer while isolating the physical layer. With bridging, only well-formed Ethernet packets are forwarded from one Ethernet segment to another; collisions and packet errors are isolated. At initial startup, Ethernet bridges work somewhat like Ethernet repeaters, passing all traffic between segments. By observing the source addresses of incoming frames, the bridge then builds an address table associating addresses to segments. Once an address is learned, the bridge forwards network traffic destined for that address only to the associated segment, improving overall performance. [[Broadcasting (networking)|Broadcast]] traffic is still forwarded to all network segments. Bridges also overcome the limits on total segments between two hosts and allow the mixing of speeds, both of which are critical to the incremental deployment of faster Ethernet variants.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1989, the networking company [[Kalpana (company)|Kalpana]] introduced their EtherSwitch, the first Ethernet switch.{{Efn|The term ''switch'' was invented by device manufacturers and does not appear in the IEEE 802.3 standard.}} Early switches such as this used [[cut-through switching]] where only the header of the incoming packet is examined before it is either dropped or forwarded to another segment.<ref name=\"networkcomputing_2000\">{{cite web |title=The 10 Most Important Products of the Decade |author=Robert J.

The MAC addresses are used to specify both the destination and the source of each data packet. Ethernet establishes link-level connections, which can be defined using both the destination and source addresses.

As a result, the minimum packet size and the physical medium's total length are closely linked.}} Computers are connected to an [[Attachment Unit Interface]] (AUI) [[transceiver]], which is in turn connected to the cable (with [[thin Ethernet]] the transceiver is usually integrated into the network adapter). While a simple passive wire is highly reliable for small networks, it is not reliable for large extended networks, where damage to the wire in a single place, or a single bad connector, can make the whole Ethernet segment unusable.{{Efn|Multipoint systems are also prone to strange failure modes when an electrical discontinuity reflects the signal in such a manner that some nodes would work properly, while others work slowly because of excessive retries or not at all.

They corrupt transmitted data and require stations to re-transmit. The lost data and re-transmission reduces throughput. In the worst case, where multiple active hosts connected with maximum allowed cable length attempt to transmit many short frames, excessive collisions can reduce throughput dramatically. However, a [[Xerox]] report in 1980 studied performance of an existing Ethernet installation under both normal and artificially generated heavy load.

In this topology, collisions are only possible if station and switch attempt to communicate with each other at the same time, and collisions are limited to this link. Furthermore, the [[10BASE-T]] standard introduced a [[full duplex]] mode of operation which became common with [[Fast Ethernet]] and the de facto standard with [[Gigabit Ethernet]].

Early repeaters had only two ports, allowing, at most, a doubling of network size. Once repeaters with more than two ports became available, it was possible to wire the network in a [[star network|star topology]]. Early experiments with star topologies (called \"Fibernet\") using [[optical fiber]] were published by 1978.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Fibemet: Multimode Optical Fibers for Local Computer Networks |author1= Eric G.

Modifying Ethernet to conform to twisted pair telephone wiring already installed in commercial buildings provided another opportunity to lower costs, expand the installed base, and leverage building design, and, thus, twisted-pair Ethernet was the next logical development in the mid-1980s.\n\nEthernet on unshielded twisted-pair cables (UTP) began with [[StarLAN]] at 1&nbsp;Mbit/s in the mid-1980s. In 1987 [[SynOptics]] introduced the first twisted-pair Ethernet at 10&nbsp;Mbit/s in a star-wired cabling topology with a central hub, later called [[LattisNet]].<ref name=VonBurg2003 /><ref name=\"Spurgeon 2000\"/>{{rp|29}}<ref>\n{{cite book| title = The Triumph of Ethernet: technological communities and the battle for the LAN standard| author=Urs von Burg| publisher=Stanford University Press |year= 2001| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ooBqdIXIqbwC&pg=PA175| isbn = 0-8047-4094-1| page = 175}}\n</ref> These evolved into 10BASE-T, which was designed for point-to-point links only, and all termination was built into the device. This changed repeaters from a specialist device used at the center of large networks to a device that every twisted pair-based network with more than two machines had to use. The tree structure that resulted from this made Ethernet networks easier to maintain by preventing most faults with one peer or its associated cable from affecting other devices on the network.{{cn|date=April 2020|reason=OK, repeaters are required to deactivate ports that send excessive collisions, such as due to internal defects, or external wiring defects. That is an important part of this statement.}}\n\nDespite the physical star topology and the presence of separate transmit and receive channels in the twisted pair and fiber media, repeater-based Ethernet networks still use half-duplex and CSMA/CD, with only minimal activity by the repeater, primarily generation of the [[jam signal]] in dealing with packet collisions. Every packet is sent to every other port on the repeater, so bandwidth and security problems are not addressed. The total throughput of the repeater is limited to that of a single link, and all links must operate at the same speed.<ref name=\"Spurgeon 2000\"/>{{rp|278}}\n\n=== {{Visible anchor|Bridging and switching}} ===<!--[[Full-duplex Ethernet]] links here-->\n[[File:Network switches.jpg|thumb|[[Patch cable]]s with [[patch field]]s of two Ethernet switches]]\n{{Main|Bridging (networking)|Network switch}}\n\nWhile repeaters can isolate some aspects of [[Ethernet segment]]s, such as cable breakages, they still forward all traffic to all Ethernet devices. The entire network is one [[collision domain]], and all hosts have to be able to detect collisions anywhere on the network. This limits the number of repeaters between the farthest nodes and creates practical limits on how many machines can communicate on an Ethernet network. Segments joined by repeaters have to all operate at the same speed, making phased-in upgrades impossible.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nTo alleviate these problems, bridging was created to communicate at the data link layer while isolating the physical layer. With bridging, only well-formed Ethernet packets are forwarded from one Ethernet segment to another; collisions and packet errors are isolated. At initial startup, Ethernet bridges work somewhat like Ethernet repeaters, passing all traffic between segments. By observing the source addresses of incoming frames, the bridge then builds an address table associating addresses to segments. Once an address is learned, the bridge forwards network traffic destined for that address only to the associated segment, improving overall performance. [[Broadcasting (networking)|Broadcast]] traffic is still forwarded to all network segments. Bridges also overcome the limits on total segments between two hosts and allow the mixing of speeds, both of which are critical to the incremental deployment of faster Ethernet variants.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1989, the networking company [[Kalpana (company)|Kalpana]] introduced their EtherSwitch, the first Ethernet switch.{{Efn|The term ''switch'' was invented by device manufacturers and does not appear in the IEEE 802.3 standard.}} Early switches such as this used [[cut-through switching]] where only the header of the incoming packet is examined before it is either dropped or forwarded to another segment.<ref name=\"networkcomputing_2000\">{{cite web |title=The 10 Most Important Products of the Decade |author=Robert J.

One drawback of this method is that it does not readily allow a mixture of different link speeds. Another is that packets that have been corrupted are still propagated through the network.
