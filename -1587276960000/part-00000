London: Kingfisher.</ref> Commerce was most advanced in the small coastal ports that had regular commerce with [[Bristol]] or [[Liverpool]]; the other major sources of external trading contact were the [[drover (Britain)|drovers]], who drove cattle from [[Mid Wales]] along [[Drovers road]]s for sale and slaughter in the [[English Midlands]] and London's [[Smithfield Market]] from the 14th century onwards. The drovers were instrumental in establishing the first banks in Wales, such as ''Banc Y Ddafad Ddu'' (\"Black Sheep Bank\") in [[Aberystwyth]].<ref name=\"historical atlas\"/>\n\nIndustrial development from the mid 18th century was stimulated by the potential of Wales' rich mineral deposits, the arrival of English entrepreneurs and [[financiers]] and advances in technology. The development of iron [[smelting]] by [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] made the [[South Wales Valleys]] a natural industrial location during the [[Industrial Revolution]] and, from the mid 18th century, increased demand for metals and coal was generated first by war and later by the advent of steamships and railways.<ref name=\"historical atlas\"/>\n\nThe northern rim of the [[South Wales Coalfield]], focused on [[Merthyr]], became Britain's foremost iron-producing district in the second half of the 18th century, while the south-western part of the coalfield, around [[Swansea]], emerged as an important centre of [[non-ferrous metal]] smelting and [[tinplate]] production. [[Metallurgical]] industries required ever increasing quantities of coal, which was initially largely mined for this purpose. However, coal mining for sale developed in earnest from the mid 19th century and this was to become the [[Mining in Wales|signature industry of the region]], transforming the economic and social landscape of the South Wales Valleys.<ref name=\"historical atlas\"/>\n\n===19th century===\n\nAlthough a much smaller industry than coal, the [[slate industry in Wales]] became the world's largest supplier in the 19th century and had an enduring impact on the landscape of [[North Wales]].<ref name=\"encyclopedia\">The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales.

The Welsh export economy collapsed during the [[Post-World War I recession|inter-war recession]], a victim of increasing [[protectionism]] and the rise of new competitors overseas. As global [[terms of trade]] changed, unemployment in the South Wales Valleys soared to unprecedented levels during the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|early 1930s]] (up to 59% in [[Merthyr]] and 76% in [[Pontypridd]]), despite the exodus of 400,000 people from the region between 1921 and 1939.<ref>Day, G.

The development of iron [[smelting]] by [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] made the [[South Wales Valleys]] a natural industrial location during the [[Industrial Revolution]] and, from the mid 18th century, increased demand for metals and coal was generated first by war and later by the advent of steamships and railways.<ref name=\"historical atlas\"/>\n\nThe northern rim of the [[South Wales Coalfield]], focused on [[Merthyr]], became Britain's foremost iron-producing district in the second half of the 18th century, while the south-western part of the coalfield, around [[Swansea]], emerged as an important centre of [[non-ferrous metal]] smelting and [[tinplate]] production. [[Metallurgical]] industries required ever increasing quantities of coal, which was initially largely mined for this purpose. However, coal mining for sale developed in earnest from the mid 19th century and this was to become the [[Mining in Wales|signature industry of the region]], transforming the economic and social landscape of the South Wales Valleys.<ref name=\"historical atlas\"/>\n\n===19th century===\n\nAlthough a much smaller industry than coal, the [[slate industry in Wales]] became the world's largest supplier in the 19th century and had an enduring impact on the landscape of [[North Wales]].<ref name=\"encyclopedia\">The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales.

The novel was first published in 1998 by [[HarperCollins|Harper, San Francisco]].\n\n== Plot summary ==\nA reworking of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]'', ''The Storm'' follows the fortunes of Kenzie Maxwell, a wealthy soon-to-be septuagenarian with a complicated past. Retired to a secluded and wealthy island in the [[Florida|State of Florida]] with his third wife, Willow, Kenzie dwells on the consequences of his midlife crisis. Though twenty years have passed since his affair with a young graffiti artist, Kia, the ramifications of the relationship are seemingly permanent: an irrevocably altered life trajectory, lasting shame and regret, and an irreconcilable conflict with his only brother.\n\nTwenty years previously, Kenzie's increasing sense of purposelessness drove him to seek further meaning beyond his own opulent lifestyle as a successful writer. Having cast about for a productive and charitable outlet, the middle-aged Kenzie had settled at last upon the Alodians mission, a charitable organisation chaired by his older brother, Dalton. Serving the charity in the South Bronx as the editor of their newsletter, Kenzie had earnestly set about to document the sad stories of the homeless and abandoned individuals that frequented the mission, only to meet and fall in love with the seventeen-year-old Kia.\n\nFollowing a brief and clandestine affair, Kia is found dead, having prematurely given birth to Kenzie's child in the impoverished surroundings of a tenement flat with few amenities. Kenzie, who was unaware of the pregnancy, had subsequently written a distraught letter of confession to his brother. While struggling to come to terms with the responsibility of raising his newly-born daughter, Bree, Kenzie is stunned by his brother\u2019s decision to publish his private confession in the mission newsletter, thereby breaking the news of the scandal, and bringing public disgrace upon himself and, more importantly, his daughter and her mother.\n\nTwenty years hence, the retired writer has become a resident of Plantation Island, where his wife, Willow, lives with her forty-year-old son, Averill. The wealthy Floridian community is presided over by the formidable Miss Sickert, whose prestigious \"suppers\" are the daunting gateway to the social circle of the resort. As the date of Kenzie's seventieth birthday party approaches, Dalton journeys to the island at the request of Miss Sickert, who requires his assistance in the composition of a will. Also travelling to the island are Dalton's stepson, Nandy, whose relationship with his stepfather threatens to become distant beyond repair, and Bree, who has come to celebrate her father's birthday. By coincidence, a miraculous reunion is brought about when Bree realises that the man sat next to her on the flight to West Palm Beach is her uncle Dalton, and the two travellers are met at the airport by Nandy and Kenzie.\n\nDetermined to see the brothers reconciled, Willow despatches Averill with a party invitation to the house of Miss Sickert, where Dalton and his stepson are lodging. Intending on interrogating the dissolute messenger, Miss Sickert is instead dragged into an unwanted existential conversation about her own existence, which raises fears that neither she nor her afternoon guest, the obsequious Bishop Hazelton, are able to allay.\n\nAs the day of the party arrives, Nandy proposes an early morning fishing trip with his father, with the hope that this will bring about a long-sought rapprochement. The planned reconciliation appears to have been thwarted when a storm intercepts the boat, reducing it to a wreck, and depositing its two passengers in the sea, as Willow, Bree, and Kenzie watch with horror from the shore. When the latter calls Miss Sickert with news of the apparent tragedy, she is heartbroken, and begins to make her way to Willow's house through the rain. Both Dalton and Nandy are rescued from the surf, neither knowing that the other is still alive, and thus both are given the opportunity to mourn the loss of the other, and are thereby reconciled when they realise that tragedy has been averted. When both Miss Sickert and Bishop Hazelton arrive somewhat bedraggled at the house, they find the family joined together in celebration, their differences resolved and their collective pasts forgiven. \n\n== Characters ==\n\n* '''Kenzie:''' a retired writer, disgraced by his public affair with a teenager twenty years previously, Kenzie is prone to deep reflection on the shifting patterns of life. Like [[Prospero]] in ''The Tempest'', he suffers a quasi-banishment to Plantation Island, where he perennially feels like a guest in the house of his third wife, Willow, and her forty-year-old son, Averill. Unlike his wife, Kenzie is a firm believer in the numinous. Beset by constant guilt concerning his indiscretion, the ageing writer makes daily entries in a letter, which is by this stage the length of a book, addressed to his tragically deceased lover, Kia. At odds with his past, Kenzie carries a lasting resentment toward his older brother, Dalton, who, as the chair of the charity that Kenzie was volunteering at when he committed the indiscretion, publishes his younger brother's letter of confession in the newsletter.\n\n* '''Dalton:''' the older brother of Kenzie, Dalton lives a highly organised life of solitude. Retired from his career as a professor at a law school, he has ambitions of writing a history of Central Park. Unable to understand why Kenzie has not spoken to him in two decades, Dalton avoids his own past, particularly the remembrance of his two breakdowns: the first of which began while performing the role of best man at Kenzie's first wedding; the second of which occurs after the death of his own wife, when he is overcome by existential questions.\n\n* '''Willow:''' a wealthy resident of Plantation Island, Willow is the third wife of Kenzie Maxwell, having herself been previously married twice. Kenzie's willingness to believe \u201canything\u201d is set against her own belief in \"nothing\". Rather than considering matters existential, Willow instead ponders deeply her own past, remembering the death of her second husband, and wondering at Kenzie's inability to bring about reconciliation with his older brother.\n\n* '''Bree:''' born out of Kenzie's indiscretion with a teenage runaway, Kia, Bree's life is characterised by a search for identity. In search of traces of her mother, whose last name is unknown to both her and Kenzie, Bree scours the neighbourhood in [[New York City]] where her mother had previously lived. A graffiti artist, Kia is known to have left her signature sprayed in different forms all over her borough, and Bree has combed the area for any sign of her mother's mark, though without success. \u00a0\n\n* '''Nandy:''' the disaffected and feckless stepson of Dalton, Nandy has endured a series of disappointments in his life, culminating in the tragedy of his mother's untimely death. Dropping out of college to embark upon a summer-long bike tour of the continent, the young man has finally settled down to life as a maintenance worker at a golf course.\n\n* '''Averill:''' abandoning any ambition towards an ordinary life, the forty-year-old Averill has spent his adulthood windsurfing, meditating, and living off the wealth of his mother, Willow, as a permanent resident at her house. He is, as Dale Brown writes, 'the sort of fellow nobody notices',<ref>Brown, W. Dale. (2006). ''The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings''. Westminster John Knox Press. pp. 361. ISBN <bdi>0-664-23113-6</bdi>. OCLC 255278233.</ref> yet this gives him unusual insight into the lives of fellow inhabitants of the island, whose reverie he disturbs with unwanted existential questions.\n\n* '''Miss Sickert:''' 'another of Buechner's almost villains',<ref>Brown, W. Dale. (2006). ''The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings''. Westminster John Knox Press. pp. 354. ISBN <bdi>0-664-23113-6</bdi>.

Her famed \"suppers\" are the recognised point of entry into the social life of the island, where she sees her role as supervisory: '\"I try to keep this island afloat like a ship\"', she claims, '\"that's what I do. I try to make the journey as well run and attractive and civilized as possible\"'.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Buechner|first=Frederick|title=The Storm|publisher=HarperOne|year=1998|isbn=|location=New York|pages=102}}</ref> Despite her disapproval of Kenzie's past she is beset by her own returning scandal \u2013 the well-worn rumour that her servant, Calvert Sykes, is actually her illegitimate son. \u00a0\n\n== Composition ==\n''The Storm'' was published one year after the release of Buechner's thirteenth novel, ''On the Road with the Archangel'' (1997). Buechner's works published in the late 1990s and early 2000s reveal a preoccupation with Shakespeare's [[Shakespeare's late romances|late romances]]. In an interview given for the ''San Diego Weekly Reader'' in 1997, Buechner revealed his own desire to write novels similar to the late works of Shakespeare:<blockquote>I had my seventieth birthday two summers ago, and I began thinking about things people write when they get to be old codgers. I thought about Shakespeare. I thought about how at the end of his life he wrote these wonderful sort of fairy tale plays like ''The Tempest'' and ''[[The Winter's Tale|The Winter's Tale]]'', and everything ends up wonderfully, and it's sort of too good not to be true.<ref>Judith Moore, 'Reading', ''San Diego Weekly Reader'', December 4 (1997), p.65</ref></blockquote>''The Tempest'', which Dale Brown describes as 'the allusive force'<ref>Brown, W. Dale. (2006). ''The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings''. Westminster John Knox Press. pp. 342. ISBN <bdi>0-664-23113-6</bdi>. OCLC 255278233.</ref> behind ''The Storm'', is a work that Buechner acknowledges as highly influential throughout his writings. Remembering his school years in his first autobiographical work, ''The Sacred Journey'' (1982), Buechner writes:<blockquote>Mr. Martin had us read wonderful things \u2013 it was he who gave me my love for ''The Tempest,'' for instance \u2013 but it was a course less in literature than in language and the great power that language has to move and in some measure, even to transform the human heart.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Buechner|first=Frederick|title=The Sacred Journey|publisher=Harper and Row|year=1982|isbn=|location=New York|pages=69}}</ref></blockquote>In his literary critical work, ''Speak What We Feel'' (2001), published two years after ''The Storm'', the author describes ''The Tempest'' as: <blockquote>[A] fairy tale too good not to be true, where all shadows are finally dispelled and the world seems bathed in a kind of golden haze, as if at the close of his career Shakespeare had reached some kind of golden inner peace within himself.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Buechner|first=Frederick|title=Speak What We Feel|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|year=2001|isbn=|location=New York|pages=149}}</ref></blockquote>Buechner further elucidates this theme in an earlier non-fiction work, ''Telling the Truth: the gospel as tragedy, comedy, and fairy tale'' (1977). Concerning ''The Tempest'', he writes:<blockquote>But at the close of his career, after the period of the great tragedies, Shakespeare turned to something much closer to true fairy tales. He wrote ''Cymbeline,'' where innocence is vindicated and old enemies reconciled, and ''The Winter's Tale,'' where the dead queen turns out not to be dead at all, the lost child, Perdita, restored to those who love her. And he wrote ''The Tempest'' itself, where the same great storm of the world that drowned the Franciscan nuns aboard the ''Deutschland'' and lashed old Lear to madness and stung Job in his despair is stilled by Prospero's magic; and justice is done, and lovers reunited, and the kingdom restored to its rightful king so that in a way it is the beautiful dream of Caliban that turns out to be real and the storm of the world with all its cloud-capped towers and gorgeous palaces and solemn temples that turns out to be the insubstantial pageant that fades into thin air and leaves not a rack behind. Like the last self-portraits of Rembrandt, where the ravaged old face of the painter smiles out of the shadows, it is as if at the end of his career Shakespeare comes out on the far side of the tragic vision of ''Lear'' and ''Macbeth'' and speaks into the night a golden word too absurd perhaps to be anything but true, the laughter of things beyond the tears of things.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Buechner|first=Frederick|title=Telling the Truth|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|year=1977|isbn=|location=New York|pages=87-8}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n== Themes ==\nBuechner scholar Dale Brown suggests that ''The Storm'', like its predecessor, ''On the Road with the Archangel'', has a 'valedictory'<ref>Brown, W. Dale. (2006). ''The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings''. Westminster John Knox Press. pp. 366. ISBN <bdi>0-664-23113-6</bdi>. OCLC 255278233.</ref> quality: 'an undertone of goodbye, a kind of joyous sadness that percolates through the very different books, a way of summing up'.<ref>Brown, W. Dale. (2006). ''The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings''. Westminster John Knox Press. pp. 339. ISBN <bdi>0-664-23113-6</bdi>. OCLC 255278233.</ref> The novel is, in line with the rest of Buechner's work, concerned with existential questions. The return of its central character, Kenzie, to church, and his renewed sense of faith, is balanced against his wife's scepticism, as once more faith and doubt find expression in a domestic setting. In addition to the reoccurrence of such topics as God, death, and forgiveness, there is a further fascination with the process and effect of aging, termed by Brown as an emerging 'grief and exuberance': a Shakespearean 'mix of comedy and tragedy'.<ref>Brown, W. Dale. (2006). ''The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings''. Westminster John Knox Press. pp. 341-2. ISBN <bdi>0-664-23113-6</bdi>. OCLC 255278233.</ref> \n\n== Critical reception ==\nBuechner's fourteenth novel was warmly received by critics. In his review, written for the ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer|Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', Michael Harrington called ''The Storm'' a 'miniature epic' and a 'quiet marvel', concluding that Buechner 'is one of our greatest novelists'.<ref>Harrington, Michael. \"Miniature Epic of Alienation, Salvation\" ''Philadelphia Inquirer,'' February 21 1999, p.4.</ref> Writing in ''[[World and I|The World & I]]'', Maude McDaniel reflected more broadly on Buechner's career as a novelist, suggesting that 'ambiguity has become Buechner's stock in trade [\u2026.] and is probably the key to his success as a religious writer in the studiedly nonreligious culture of the last half of the twentieth century'. Within this line of thinking McDaniel argued that ''The Storm'' represents 'the most ambiguous of all his books'.<ref>Maude McDaniel, \"An Elusive Grace\", ''The World & I'', May 1999, p.278.</ref>\n\nSeveral critics noted the author's use of ''The Tempest'' as a touchstone for the novel. In a review published in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', Ruth Coughlin wrote that Buechner, 'a well regarded writer', had published 'a contemporary tale of redemption'. She continues: 'Drawing on both his literary and religious credentials, he has used his latest novel to reinterpret ''The Tempest'''.<ref>Ruth Coughlin, \"Books in Brief: Fiction\", ''New York Times'', January 17, 1999, p.1.</ref> Writing for the ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram|Fort-Worth Star-Telegram]]'', Larry Swindell called ''The Storm'' an 'entirely wonderful [example of a] paraphrase of Shakespeare',<ref>Larry Swindell, \"Tempest in a Teapot\", ''Fort-Worth Star-Telegram'', December 6, 1998, p.5.</ref> while the ''[[Kirkus Reviews|Kirkus Review]]'' found it to be 'a wonderfully humane and satisfying meditative romance', containing 'a fascinating set of variations on the Shakespearean source, expressed in spare, simple declarative sentences that propel the story forward with commendable swiftness.' The reviewer further noted Buechner's 'skilful' movement between 'the viewpoints of several major characters', before concluding that the novel constitutes 'A marvelous adaptation of Shakespeare\u2014one of the best ever.'<ref>\"Review: ''The Storm''\", ''Kirkus Review'', November 1, 1998, p.208.</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Storm (Buechner novel)}}\n[[Category:20th-century novels]]\n[[Category:20th-century American novels]]\n[[Category:1998-related lists]]\n[[Category:1998 novels]]\n[[Category:American literature]]\n", "text_old": "{{over-quotation|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{Infobox book\n| author            = [[Frederick Buechner]]\n| language          = English\n| publisher         = [[HarperCollins]]\n| isbn              = 9780060611453\n| pub_date          = 1998\n| image             = BuechnerTheStorm.jpg\n}}\n\n''The Storm'' is the [[Frederick Buechner bibliography|fourteenth novel]] by the American author and theologian, [[Frederick Buechner]].

In an interview given for the ''San Diego Weekly Reader'' in 1997, Buechner revealed his own desire to write novels similar to the late works of Shakespeare:<blockquote>I had my seventieth birthday two summers ago, and I began thinking about things people write when they get to be old codgers. I thought about Shakespeare. I thought about how at the end of his life he wrote these wonderful sort of fairy tale plays like ''The Tempest'' and ''[[The Winter's Tale|The Winter's Tale]]'', and everything ends up wonderfully, and it's sort of too good not to be true.<ref>Judith Moore, 'Reading', ''San Diego Weekly Reader'', December 4 (1997), p.65</ref></blockquote>''The Tempest'', which Dale Brown describes as 'the allusive force'<ref>Brown, W. Dale. (2006). ''The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings''. Westminster John Knox Press. pp. 342. ISBN <bdi>0-664-23113-6</bdi>. OCLC 255278233.</ref> behind ''The Storm'', is a work that Buechner acknowledges as highly influential throughout his writings. Remembering his school years in his first autobiographical work, ''The Sacred Journey'' (1982), Buechner writes:<blockquote>Mr. Martin had us read wonderful things \u2013 it was he who gave me my love for ''The Tempest,'' for instance \u2013 but it was a course less in literature than in language and the great power that language has to move and in some measure, even to transform the human heart.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Buechner|first=Frederick|title=The Sacred Journey|publisher=Harper and Row|year=1982|isbn=|location=New York|pages=69}}</ref></blockquote>In his literary critical work, ''Speak What We Feel'' (2001), published two years after ''The Storm'', the author describes ''The Tempest'' as: <blockquote>[A] fairy tale too good not to be true, where all shadows are finally dispelled and the world seems bathed in a kind of golden haze, as if at the close of his career Shakespeare had reached some kind of golden inner peace within himself.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Buechner|first=Frederick|title=Speak What We Feel|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|year=2001|isbn=|location=New York|pages=149}}</ref></blockquote>Buechner further elucidates this theme in an earlier non-fiction work, ''Telling the Truth: the gospel as tragedy, comedy, and fairy tale'' (1977). Concerning ''The Tempest'', he writes:<blockquote>But at the close of his career, after the period of the great tragedies, Shakespeare turned to something much closer to true fairy tales. He wrote ''Cymbeline,'' where innocence is vindicated and old enemies reconciled, and ''The Winter's Tale,'' where the dead queen turns out not to be dead at all, the lost child, Perdita, restored to those who love her. And he wrote ''The Tempest'' itself, where the same great storm of the world that drowned the Franciscan nuns aboard the ''Deutschland'' and lashed old Lear to madness and stung Job in his despair is stilled by Prospero's magic; and justice is done, and lovers reunited, and the kingdom restored to its rightful king so that in a way it is the beautiful dream of Caliban that turns out to be real and the storm of the world with all its cloud-capped towers and gorgeous palaces and solemn temples that turns out to be the insubstantial pageant that fades into thin air and leaves not a rack behind. Like the last self-portraits of Rembrandt, where the ravaged old face of the painter smiles out of the shadows, it is as if at the end of his career Shakespeare comes out on the far side of the tragic vision of ''Lear'' and ''Macbeth'' and speaks into the night a golden word too absurd perhaps to be anything but true, the laughter of things beyond the tears of things.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Buechner|first=Frederick|title=Telling the Truth|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|year=1977|isbn=|location=New York|pages=87-8}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n== Themes ==\nBuechner scholar Dale Brown suggests that ''The Storm'', like its predecessor, ''On the Road with the Archangel'', has a 'valedictory'<ref>Brown, W. Dale. (2006). ''The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings''. Westminster John Knox Press. pp. 366. ISBN <bdi>0-664-23113-6</bdi>. OCLC 255278233.</ref> quality: 'an undertone of goodbye, a kind of joyous sadness that percolates through the very different books, a way of summing up'.<ref>Brown, W. Dale. (2006). ''The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings''. Westminster John Knox Press. pp. 339. ISBN <bdi>0-664-23113-6</bdi>. OCLC 255278233.</ref> The novel is, in line with the rest of Buechner's work, concerned with existential questions. The return of its central character, Kenzie, to church, and his renewed sense of faith, is balanced against his wife's scepticism, as once more faith and doubt find expression in a domestic setting. In addition to the reoccurrence of such topics as God, death, and forgiveness, there is a further fascination with the process and effect of aging, termed by Brown as an emerging 'grief and exuberance': a Shakespearean 'mix of comedy and tragedy'.<ref>Brown, W. Dale. (2006). ''The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings''. Westminster John Knox Press. pp. 341-2. ISBN <bdi>0-664-23113-6</bdi>. OCLC 255278233.</ref> \n\n== Critical reception ==\nBuechner's fourteenth novel was warmly received by critics. In his review, written for the ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer|Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', Michael Harrington called ''The Storm'' a 'miniature epic' and a 'quiet marvel', concluding that Buechner 'is one of our greatest novelists'.<ref>Harrington, Michael. \"Miniature Epic of Alienation, Salvation\u201d ''Philadelphia Inquirer,'' February 21 1999, p.4.</ref> Writing in ''[[World and I|The World & I]]'', Maude McDaniel reflected more broadly on Buechner's career as a novelist, suggesting that 'ambiguity has become Buechner's stock in trade [\u2026.] and is probably the key to his success as a religious writer in the studiedly nonreligious culture of the last half of the twentieth century'. Within this line of thinking McDaniel argued that ''The Storm'' represents 'the most ambiguous of all his books'.<ref>Maude McDaniel, \u201cAn Elusive Grace\u201d, ''The World & I'', May 1999, p.278.</ref>\n\nSeveral critics noted the author's use of ''The Tempest'' as a touchstone for the novel. In a review published in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', Ruth Coughlin wrote that Buechner, 'a well regarded writer', had published 'a contemporary tale of redemption'. She continues: 'Drawing on both his literary and religious credentials, he has used his latest novel to reinterpret ''The Tempest'''.<ref>Ruth Coughlin, \u201cBooks in Brief: Fiction\u201d, ''New York Times'', January 17, 1999, p.1.</ref> Writing for the ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram|Fort-Worth Star-Telegram]]'', Larry Swindell called ''The Storm'' an 'entirely wonderful [example of a] paraphrase of Shakespeare',<ref>Larry Swindell, '''Tempest'' in a Teapot', ''Fort-Worth Star-Telegram'', December 6, 1998, p.5.</ref> while the ''[[Kirkus Reviews|Kirkus Review]]'' found it to be 'a wonderfully humane and satisfying meditative romance', containing 'a fascinating set of variations on the Shakespearean source, expressed in spare, simple declarative sentences that propel the story forward with commendable swiftness.' The reviewer further noted Buechner's 'skilful' movement between 'the viewpoints of several major characters', before concluding that the novel constitutes 'A marvelous adaptation of Shakespeare\u2014one of the best ever.'<ref>'Review: ''The Storm''', ''Kirkus Review'', November 1<sup>st</sup>, 1998, p.208.</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Storm (Buechner novel)}}\n[[Category:20th-century novels]]\n[[Category:20th-century American novels]]\n[[Category:1998-related lists]]\n[[Category:1998 novels]]\n[[Category:American literature]]\n", "name_user": "Bennv3771", "label": "safe", "comment": "ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Storm_(Buechner_novel)"}

B\u00e9chirian was a key player in the British [[new wave music|new wave]] scene of the late 1970s and early 1980s, best known for his work with [[Nick Lowe]], [[Paul Carrack]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[The Undertones]], [[Dave Edmunds]], [[The Monkees]], the [[Flamin' Groovies]], and [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]].  He was also a member of the pseudonymous new wave group [[Blanket of Secrecy]], which issued one album in 1982.  More recently, B\u00e9chirian has worked with the [[Trashcan Sinatras]] and [[Bell X1 (band)|Bell X1]].\n\n==Life and career==\nB\u00e9chirian was born and spent his early years in Calcutta, moving to England with his family at the age of 10.  His engineering career started at [[Eden Studios]], in London in the mid-1970s. The studio was based around an Ampex 4 track and a custom built desk based in part on EMI/BBC designs. B\u00e9chirian progressed to become assistant mastering engineer, using an early Scully lathe during the day, and spending the evenings in the studio with bands improving his engineering skills. Eden then moved to a much larger premises and built a brand new studio complex from the ground up. Being involved in the building of the facility, from wiring the studio to helping to build their custom desk, gained B\u00e9chirian a great insight into acoustic design and audio electronics. He even designed the studio's logo. Eden opened as a 16 track with Ampex MM1100, but made the rapid leap to 24 track recording, moving up to an Ampex MM1200 and Dolby A. It was one of the first few 24 track studios in London at that time.\n\n[[Stiff Records]] founder Dave Robinson sought out B\u00e9chirian and he began recording and mixing projects for the label's then fledgling artist roster.\n\nHe continued to develop his engineering talents at Eden as house engineer on an endless mixture of sessions ranging from solo artists to rock bands, big bands and orchestra. He worked as an assistant on sessions with some of the most successful producers and bands at the time, including [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Marc Bolan]], [[Manfred Mann]], [[Moody Blues]], [[David Essex]], [[Georgie Fame]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], [[Clover]] and many others.\n\nB\u00e9chirian had come to the attention of various A&R men, and also continued to work with a variety of Stiff artists. He was asked by Robinson to be involved with the production of [[Lene Lovich]]'s first album, which produced her first hit single, \"[[Lucky Number (song)|Lucky Number]]\". [[Malcolm McLaren]] brought the [[Sex Pistols]] into Eden to work on various drum and guitar tracking sessions, and around this time, Nick Lowe approached B\u00e9chirian to work on his solo project, which was to become ''[[Jesus of Cool]]''. As a result, he wanted B\u00e9chirian to act as his exclusive engineer on all his forthcoming projects, which led to working with [[Graham Parker]], [[Huey Lewis]] and [[Clover]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Rockpile]], and others.\n\n[[Seymour Stein]], founder of Sire Records, signed the [[The Undertones|Undertones]], asking B\u00e9chirian to take on production duties for the band's first album.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGaVCwAAQBAJ|title=Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone|last=Bradley|first=Michael|date=2016-02-15|publisher=Music Sales Limited|isbn=9781783238521|language=en}}</ref> B\u00e9chirian ended up engineering and producing the band's first three albums. [[Jake Riviera]], who looked after Costello and Lowe, began representing B\u00e9chirian as manager.\n\nB\u00e9chirian continued to work with various bands and artists as engineer and producer. He produced (with Elvis Costello) and engineered Squeeze's hit album ''[[East Side Story (Squeeze album)|East Side Story]]'', and their American breakthrough hit single \"[[Tempted (Squeeze song)|Tempted]]\".\n\nAround that same time, he formed the band [[Blanket of Secrecy]]. Their first and only album was released in both the UK and the US, and garnered some attention as all the band members wrote and performed under pseudonyms (\"Tinker\", \"Tailor\" and \"Soldier\") and refused to be photographed. This led to speculation about the band members' identities\u2014as B\u00e9chirian was listed in the album's credits as a producer, it was posited that he may have been behind the group.  However, public and media interest in Blanket of Secrecy was short-lived after the album and associated singles failed to chart, and the group broke up.  The actual identities of the band members were not revealed for more than twenty years.\n\nB\u00e9chirian went on to build his own recording studio in London and formed Vinyltone Productions with Epic Records in New York, developing and releasing new artists. The next three years he divided his time between London and New York.  He later remastered Elvis Costello's first nine albums, and produced [[The Monkees]]' 1986 reunion album ''[[Pool It!]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tapeop.com/interviews/90/roger-bechirian-bonus/|title=Roger Bechirian: Elvis Costello, Squeeze, Undertones|website=tapeop.com|access-date=2016-08-11}}</ref>\n\nLooking for a new direction, B\u00e9chirian later formed Trick Management.  Amongst his clients are [[Tom McRae]] and [[Bell X1 (band)|Bell X1]].  Signing Bell X1 to Island Records, he produced the band's breakthrough hit album ''[[Flock (album)|Flock]]''.\n\nNow based in London, B\u00e9chirian engineers and produces, as well as being involved with the development and co-management of new bands and artists.\n\n==Discography overview==\nNote: engineered (e), mixed (m), co-produced (cp), produced (p)\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n\n'''[[Elvis Costello]]''': e-m-cp-p\n\nalbums:\n* ''[[My Aim Is True]]'' (remixes)\n* ''[[This Year's Model|This Years Model]]''\n* ''[[Armed Forces (album)|Armed Forces]]''\n* ''[[Get Happy!!
