[[Union Army]] forces under [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Ambrose Burnside]] occupied [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], [[Tennessee in the American Civil War|Tennessee]], and [[Confederate States Army]] forces under [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt.

Ultimately, Longstreet's own siege of Knoxville ended when Union Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] led elements of the [[Army of the Tennessee]] and other troops to Burnside's relief after Union troops had broken the Confederate siege of Chattanooga. Although Longstreet was one of Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]]'s best corps commanders in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|East]] in the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], he was unsuccessful in his attempt to penetrate the Knoxville defenses and take the city. \n\n==Opposing forces==\n\n===Union===\n{{further|Knoxville Union order of battle|l1=Union order of battle}}\n\n===Confederate===\n{{further|Knoxville Confederate order of battle|l1=Confederate order of battle}}\n\n==Background and initial movements==\n[[File:Military maps of the United States. LOC 2009581117-3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Topographical Map of the Approaches and Defenses of Knoxville, December 1863 - February 1864]]\n\nThe mountainous, largely [[Union (American Civil War)|Unionist]] region of [[East Tennessee]] was considered by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] to be a key war objective. Besides possessing a population largely loyal to the Union, the region was rich in grain and livestock and controlled the railroad corridor from [[Chattanooga]] to [[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]]. Throughout 1862 and 1863, Lincoln pressured a series of commanders to move through the difficult terrain and occupy the area. [[Ambrose Burnside]], who had been soundly defeated at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] in December 1862, was transferred to the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]] and given command of the Department and the [[Army of the Ohio]] in March 1863. Burnside was ordered to move against [[Knoxville]] as swiftly as possible while, at the same time, Maj. Gen. [[William S. Rosecrans]]'s [[Army of the Cumberland]] was ordered to operate against Bragg in [[Middle Tennessee]] (the [[Tullahoma campaign]] and the subsequent [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga campaign]]).<ref>Eicher, pp. 613-14; Hartley, pp. 1131-32; Korn, p. 101; Hess, ch. 1.</ref>\n\nBurnside's plan to advance from [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], with his two corps ([[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX]] and [[XXIII Corps (Union Army)|XXIII Corps]]) was delayed when the IX Corps was ordered to reinforce Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in the [[Vicksburg campaign]]. While awaiting the return of the IX Corps, Burnside sent a brigade under [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[William P. Sanders]] to strike at Knoxville with a combined force of cavalry and infantry. In mid-June, Sanders' men destroyed railroads and disrupted communications around the city, controlled by the Confederate Department of East Tennessee, commanded by [[Major General (CSA)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Sr.|Simon B. Buckner]].<ref>Eicher, pp. 613-14.</ref>\n\nBy mid-August, Burnside began his advance toward the city. The direct route to Knoxville ran through the [[Cumberland Gap]], a position strongly favoring the Confederate defenders. Instead, Burnside chose to [[Flanking maneuver|flank]] them. He threatened the gap from the north with the division commanded by Col. [[John F. DeCourcy]], while his other two divisions swung around {{convert|40|mi|km}} to the south of the Confederate position, over rugged mountain roads toward Knoxville. Despite poor road conditions, his men were able to march as many as {{convert|30|mi|km}} per day.<ref>Korn, p. 101.</ref>\n\nAs the Chickamauga campaign began, Buckner was ordered south to Chattanooga, leaving only a single brigade in the Cumberland Gap and one other east of Knoxville. Maj. Gen. [[Sam Jones (Confederate Army officer)|Samuel Jones]] replaced Buckner as commander of the department at East Tennessee. One of Burnside's cavalry brigades reached Knoxville on September 2, virtually unopposed. The following day, Burnside and his main force occupied the city, welcomed warmly by the local populace.<ref>Korn, p. 103.</ref>\n\nIn the Cumberland Gap, 2,300 inexperienced soldiers commanded by [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[John W. Frazer]] had built defenses but had no orders about what to do following Buckner's withdrawal. On September 7, confronted by DeCourcy to his north and Brig. Gen. [[James M. Shackelford]] approaching from the south, Frazer refused to surrender. Burnside and an infantry brigade commanded by Col. [[Samuel A. Gilbert]] left Knoxville and marched {{convert|60|mi|km}} in only 52 hours. Finally realizing that he was significantly outnumbered, Frazer surrendered on September 9.<ref>Korn, p. 104.</ref>\n\nBurnside dispatched some cavalry reinforcements to Rosecrans and made preparations for an expedition to clear the roads and gaps from East Tennessee to Virginia and if possible secure the saltworks beyond [[Abingdon, Virginia|Abingdon]]. During this time, the Battle of Chickamauga loomed, and frantic requests from [[Washington, D.C. in the American Civil War|Washington, D.C.]], to move south and reinforce Rosecrans were effectively ignored by Burnside, who did not want to give up his newly occupied territory and its loyal citizens. Furthermore, Burnside was encountering difficulties in moving supplies through the rugged territory and was concerned that if he moved even farther from his supply base, he might get into serious difficulty.<ref>Korn, pp. 104-05.</ref>\n\n==Battles of the East Tennessee campaign==\nThere were two relatively minor battles in East Tennessee that occurred while Burnside was being urged to reinforce Rosecrans:\n\n===Blountville (September 22, 1863)===\n{{further|Battle of Blountville}}\nOn September 22, Union Col. [[John W. Foster]], with his cavalry and artillery, engaged Col. [[James E. Carter (soldier)|James E. Carter]] and his troops at [[Blountville, Tennessee|Blountville]]. Foster attacked at noon and in the four-hour battle, shelled the town and initiated a flanking movement, compelling the Confederates to withdraw.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/tn019.htm NPS Blountsville]</ref>\n\n===Blue Springs (October 10)===\n[[File:SPCarter.jpg|thumb|[[Samuel P. Carter|Brig. Gen. Samuel P. Carter]]]]\n{{further|Battle of Blue Springs}}\nConfederate Brig. Gen. [[John Stuart Williams|John S. Williams]], with his cavalry force, set out to disrupt Union communications and logistics. He wished to take [[Bull's Gap, Tennessee|Bull's Gap]] on the East Tennessee & Virginia Railroad. On October 3, while advancing on Bull's Gap, he fought with Brig. Gen. [[Samuel P. Carter]]'s Union Cavalry Division, XXIII Corps, at Blue Springs, about {{convert|9|mi|km|spell=in}} from Bull's Gap, on the railroad. Carter withdrew, not knowing how many of the enemy he faced. Carter and Williams skirmished for the next few days. On October 10, Carter approached Blue Springs in force. Williams had received some reinforcements. The battle began about 10:00&nbsp;a.m. with Union cavalry engaging the Confederates until afternoon while another mounted force attempted to place itself in a position to cut off a Rebel retreat. Capt. [[Orlando M. Poe]], the Chief Engineer, performed a reconnaissance to identify the best location for making an infantry attack. At 3:30&nbsp;p.m., Brig. Gen. [[Edward Ferrero]]'s 1st Division, IX Corps, moved up to attack, which he did at 5:00&nbsp;p.m. Ferrero's men broke into the Confederate line, causing heavy casualties, and advanced almost to the enemy's rear before being checked. After dark, the Confederates withdrew, and the Federals took up the pursuit in the morning. Within days, Williams and his men had retired to Virginia. Burnside had launched the East Tennessee campaign to reduce or extinguish Confederate influence in the area; Blue Springs helped fulfill that mission.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/tn020.htm NPS Blue Springs]</ref>\n\n==Longstreet advances toward Knoxville==\n[[File:Longstreets Knoxville Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Area of operations, Longstreet's Knoxville campaign]]\nReacting to Burnside's victories in the Cumberland Gap and at Blue Springs, and concerned that Burnside might reinforce the Federal army that was now besieged in Chattanooga, Braxton Bragg asked [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] to order James Longstreet to advance against Burnside. Longstreet and parts of his [[First Corps, Army of Northern Virginia|First Corps]] of Robert E. Lee's [[Army of Northern Virginia]] had arrived in northern [[Georgia (U.S. state) in the American Civil War|Georgia]] in time to make a critical contribution to the Confederate victory at Chickamauga. Longstreet strongly objected to the order. He knew he would be significantly outnumbered, with 10,000 men in two infantry divisions (under Maj. Gen. [[Lafayette McLaws]] and Brig. Gen. [[Micah Jenkins]], the latter commanding the division of wounded Maj. Gen. [[John Bell Hood]]) and 5,000 cavalrymen under Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Wheeler]], versus Burnside's 12,000 infantry and 8,500 cavalry. Furthermore, he knew that the remaining 40,000 Confederates around Chattanooga would also be outnumbered by approaching reinforcements under Grant and Sherman. Longstreet argued that, by separating the Confederate forces, \"We just expose both to failure, and really take no chance to ourselves of great results.\"<ref>Eicher, p. 614; Longstreet, pp. 480-83; Alexander, p. 311; Hartley, p. 1132; Korn, p. 100.</ref>\n\nWhile Longstreet's men prepared for rail transport, a small skirmish occurred in [[Greeneville, Tennessee]], on November 6. Maj. Gen. [[Robert Ransom, Jr.]], and Brig. Gen. [[William E. Jones|William E. \"Grumble\" Jones]] dispersed Union cavalry and infantry in the area, resulting in numerous prisoners from the [[7th Ohio Cavalry]] and the 2nd East Tennessee Mounted Infantry regiments.<ref>Eicher, p. 614.</ref>\n\nLongstreet's plan was to travel by railroad to [[Sweetwater, Tennessee]], approximately halfway to Knoxville, but it was a journey fraught by problems. The expected trains did not arrive on time, and the men started off on foot. When the trains did arrive, they were pulled by underpowered locomotives that could not negotiate all of the mountain grades under load, forcing the men to dismount and walk alongside the cars in the steeper sections. The engineers had insufficient wood for fuel, and the men had to stop and dismantle fences along the way to continue. It took eight days for all of Longstreet's men and equipment to travel the {{convert|60|mi|km}} to Sweetwater, and when they arrived on November 12, they found that promised supplies were not available. The men, who had traveled from the campaigns in Virginia, would not be equipped with adequate food or clothing for the winter to come.<ref>Korn, pp. 100-01; Eicher, p. 614; Hartley, p. 1132.</ref>\n\nThe Lincoln administration became concerned about Burnside's situation and, despite weeks of urging him to leave Knoxville and head south, now ordered him to hold the city. Grant attempted to organize a relief expedition from Chattanooga, but Burnside calmly suggested that 5,000 of his men would advance southwest toward Longstreet, establish contact, and gradually withdraw toward Knoxville, which would ensure that the Confederates could not easily return to Chattanooga and reinforce Bragg. Grant readily accepted. On November 14, Longstreet erected a bridge across the [[Tennessee River]] west of [[Loudon, Tennessee|Loudon]] and began his pursuit of Burnside.<ref>Hartley, pp. 1132-33; Korn, pp. 105-06; Eicher, p. 615.</ref>\n\nWheeler's cavalry approached Knoxville on November 15 and attempted to occupy the heights overlooking the city from the south bank of the [[Holston River]], but resistance from the Federal cavalrymen under William Sanders and the threat of artillery in the forts on the river's southern bank caused him to abandon his plan and rejoin Longstreet's main body on the northern side of the river.<ref>Eicher, p. 614; Hartley, pp. 1132-33.</ref>\n\n==Battles of Longstreet's Knoxville campaign==\n[[File:Knoxville defenses 1863.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Defenses of Knoxville]]\nThere were three significant battles fought during Longstreet's Knoxville campaign:\n\n===Campbell's Station (November 16)===\n{{further|Battle of Campbell's Station}}\nFollowing parallel routes, Longstreet and Burnside raced for Campbell's Station, a hamlet where Concord Road, from the south, intersected Kingston Road to Knoxville. Burnside hoped to reach the crossroads first and continue on to safety in Knoxville; Longstreet planned to reach the crossroads and hold it, which would prevent Burnside from gaining Knoxville and force him to fight outside his earthworks. By forced marching on a rainy November 16, Burnside's advance reached the vital intersection and deployed first. The main column arrived at noon with the baggage train just behind. Scarcely 15 minutes later, Longstreet's Confederates approached. Longstreet attempted a [[Pincer movement|double envelopment]]: attacks timed to strike both Union flanks simultaneously. McLaws's Confederate division struck with such force that the Union right had to redeploy, but they held. Jenkins's Confederate division maneuvered ineffectively as it advanced and was unable to turn the Union left. Burnside ordered his two divisions astride Kingston Road to withdraw three-quarters of a mile (1.2&nbsp;km) to a ridge in their rear. This was accomplished without confusion. The Confederates suspended their attack while Burnside continued his retrograde movement to Knoxville.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/tn023.htm NPS Campbell's Station]</ref>\n\nThe Federal withdrawal under pressure was well executed, and on November 17, the bulk of Burnside's army was within the defensive perimeter of Knoxville, and the so-called Siege of Knoxville began. The Confederates were not equipped for siege operations and were running short on supplies. On November 18, William Sanders, leading the cavalry that was screening Burnside's withdrawal, was mortally wounded in a skirmish. Longstreet planned an attack as early as November 20, but he delayed, waiting for reinforcements under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]] (3,500 men) and the cavalry brigade of Grumble Jones. Col. [[Edward Porter Alexander]], Longstreet's artillery chief, wrote that \"every day of delay added to the strength of the enemy's breastworks.\"<ref>Wert, p. 346; Eicher, p. 615; Korn, p. 109-11.</ref>\n\n===Fort Sanders (November 29)===\n[[File:Fort-sanders-babcock-poe-1863-tn1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|U. S. Engineers [[Orville E. Babcock]], left, seated on a tree stump, and [[Orlando Poe]], right, standing on a war damaged salient in Fort Sanders, Knoxville]]\n{{further|Battle of Fort Sanders}}\nLongstreet decided that Fort Sanders was the only vulnerable place where his men could penetrate Burnside's fortifications, which enclosed the city, and successfully conclude the siege, already a week long. The fort, named in honor of slain cavalry chief William Sanders, surmounted an eminence just northwest of Knoxville. Northwest of the fort, the land dropped off abruptly. Longstreet believed he could assemble a storming party, undetected at night, below the fortifications and overwhelm Fort Sanders by a ''coup de main'' before dawn. Following a brief artillery barrage directed at the fort's interior, three Rebel brigades charged. Union wire entanglements&mdash;telegraph wire stretched from one tree stump to another to another&mdash;delayed the attack, but the fort's outer ditch halted the Confederates. This ditch was {{convert|12|ft|m|spell=in}} wide and from four to ten feet (1&ndash;3 m) deep with vertical sides. The fort's exterior slope was also almost vertical. Crossing the ditch was nearly impossible, especially under withering defensive fire from musketry and canister. Confederate officers did lead their men into the ditch, but, without scaling ladders, few emerged on the scarp side, and the few who entered the fort were wounded, killed, or captured. The attack lasted twenty minutes and resulted in extremely lopsided casualties: 813 Confederate versus 13 Union.<ref>Eicher, p. 616; [http://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/tn025.htm NPS Fort Sanders]</ref>\n\nAs Longstreet contemplated his next move, he received word that Bragg's army was soundly defeated at the [[Third Battle of Chattanooga|Battle of Chattanooga]] on November 25. Although he was ordered to rejoin Bragg, Longstreet felt the order was impracticable and informed Bragg that he would return with his command to Virginia but would maintain the siege on Knoxville as long as possible in the hopes that Burnside and Grant could be prevented from joining forces and annihilating the Army of Tennessee. This plan turned out to be effective because Grant sent Sherman with 25,000 men to relieve the siege at Knoxville. Longstreet abandoned his siege on December 4 and withdrew towards [[Rogersville, Tennessee]], {{convert|65|mi|km}} to the northeast, preparing to go into winter quarters. Sherman left Maj. Gen. [[Gordon Granger]] at Knoxville and returned to Chattanooga with the bulk of his army. Maj. Gen. [[John G. Parke]], Burnside's chief of staff, pursued the Confederates with a force of 8,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry, but not too closely. Longstreet continued to [[Rutledge, Tennessee|Rutledge]] on December 6 and Rogersville on December 9. Parke sent Brig. Gen. [[James M. Shackelford]] on with about 4,000 cavalry and infantry to search for Longstreet.<ref>Hartley, p. 1133; Eicher, pp. 616-17.</ref>\n\n===Bean's Station (December 14)===\n{{further|Battle of Bean's Station}}\nOn December 13, Shackelford was near [[Bean Station, Tennessee|Bean's Station]] on the [[Holston River]]. Longstreet decided to go back and capture Bean's Station. Three Confederate columns and artillery approached Bean's Station to catch the Federals in a vise. By 2:00&nbsp;a.m. on December 14, one column was skirmishing with Union pickets. The pickets held out as best they could and warned Shackelford of the Confederate presence. He deployed his force for an assault. Soon, the battle started and continued throughout most of the day. Confederate flanking attacks and other assaults occurred at various times and locations, but the Federals held until Southern reinforcements arrived. By nightfall, the Federals were retiring from Bean's Station through Bean's Gap and on to Blain's Cross Roads. Longstreet set out to attack the Union forces again the next morning, but as he approached them at Blain's Cross Roads, he found them well-entrenched. Longstreet withdrew, and the Federals soon left the area.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/tn026.htm NPS Bean's Station]</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Knoxville campaign ended following the battle of Bean's Station, and both sides went into winter quarters. The only real effect of the minor campaign was to deprive Bragg of troops he sorely needed in Chattanooga. Longstreet's foray as an independent commander was a failure, and his self-confidence was damaged. He reacted to the failure of the campaign by blaming others, as he had done at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]] in the [[Peninsula Campaign]] the previous year. He relieved [[Lafayette McLaws]] from command and requested the court martial of Brig. Gens. [[Jerome B. Robertson]] and [[Evander M. Law]]. He also submitted a letter of resignation to [[Adjutant General]] [[Samuel Cooper (general)|Samuel Cooper]] on December 30, 1863, but his request to be relieved was denied. His corps suffered through a severe winter in East Tennessee with inadequate shelter and provisions, unable to return to Virginia until the spring.<ref>Wert, pp. 340-59, 360-75; Longstreet, pp. 480-523.</ref>\n\nBurnside's competent conduct of the campaign, despite apprehensions in Washington, partially restored his military reputation that had been damaged so severely at Fredericksburg. His successful hold on Knoxville, plus Grant's victory in Chattanooga, put much of East Tennessee under Union control for the rest of the war.<ref>Hartley, p. 1133.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Knoxville, Tennessee]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web|ref=harv |last=Cox |first=Jacob D. |authorlink=Jacob Dolson Cox |title=Atlanta |year=1882 |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |location=New York, N.Y. |access-date=April 16, 2020 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/t92805p4m&view=2up&seq=22 }}\n* [[David J.

Burnside was ordered to move against [[Knoxville]] as swiftly as possible while, at the same time, Maj. Gen. [[William S.

Gen.]] [[John W. Frazer]] had built defenses but had no orders about what to do following Buckner's withdrawal. On September 7, confronted by DeCourcy to his north and Brig. Gen. [[James M. Shackelford]] approaching from the south, Frazer refused to surrender. Burnside and an infantry brigade commanded by Col. [[Samuel A. Gilbert]] left Knoxville and marched {{convert|60|mi|km}} in only 52 hours. Finally realizing that he was significantly outnumbered, Frazer surrendered on September 9.<ref>Korn, p. 104.</ref>\n\nBurnside dispatched some cavalry reinforcements to Rosecrans and made preparations for an expedition to clear the roads and gaps from East Tennessee to Virginia and if possible secure the saltworks beyond [[Abingdon, Virginia|Abingdon]]. During this time, the Battle of Chickamauga loomed, and frantic requests from [[Washington, D.C. in the American Civil War|Washington, D.C.]], to move south and reinforce Rosecrans were effectively ignored by Burnside, who did not want to give up his newly occupied territory and its loyal citizens. Furthermore, Burnside was encountering difficulties in moving supplies through the rugged territory and was concerned that if he moved even farther from his supply base, he might get into serious difficulty.<ref>Korn, pp. 104-05.</ref>\n\n==Battles of the East Tennessee campaign==\nThere were two relatively minor battles in East Tennessee that occurred while Burnside was being urged to reinforce Rosecrans:\n\n===Blountville (September 22, 1863)===\n{{further|Battle of Blountville}}\nOn September 22, Union Col. [[John W. Foster]], with his cavalry and artillery, engaged Col. [[James E. Carter (soldier)|James E. Carter]] and his troops at [[Blountville, Tennessee|Blountville]]. Foster attacked at noon and in the four-hour battle, shelled the town and initiated a flanking movement, compelling the Confederates to withdraw.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/tn019.htm NPS Blountsville]</ref>\n\n===Blue Springs (October 10)===\n[[File:SPCarter.jpg|thumb|[[Samuel P. Carter|Brig. Gen. Samuel P. Carter]]]]\n{{further|Battle of Blue Springs}}\nConfederate Brig. Gen. [[John Stuart Williams|John S. Williams]], with his cavalry force, set out to disrupt Union communications and logistics. He wished to take [[Bull's Gap, Tennessee|Bull's Gap]] on the East Tennessee & Virginia Railroad. On October 3, while advancing on Bull's Gap, he fought with Brig. Gen. [[Samuel P. Carter]]'s Union Cavalry Division, XXIII Corps, at Blue Springs, about {{convert|9|mi|km|spell=in}} from Bull's Gap, on the railroad. Carter withdrew, not knowing how many of the enemy he faced. Carter and Williams skirmished for the next few days. On October 10, Carter approached Blue Springs in force. Williams had received some reinforcements. The battle began about 10:00&nbsp;a.m. with Union cavalry engaging the Confederates until afternoon while another mounted force attempted to place itself in a position to cut off a Rebel retreat. Capt. [[Orlando M. Poe]], the Chief Engineer, performed a reconnaissance to identify the best location for making an infantry attack. At 3:30&nbsp;p.m., Brig. Gen. [[Edward Ferrero]]'s 1st Division, IX Corps, moved up to attack, which he did at 5:00&nbsp;p.m. Ferrero's men broke into the Confederate line, causing heavy casualties, and advanced almost to the enemy's rear before being checked. After dark, the Confederates withdrew, and the Federals took up the pursuit in the morning. Within days, Williams and his men had retired to Virginia. Burnside had launched the East Tennessee campaign to reduce or extinguish Confederate influence in the area; Blue Springs helped fulfill that mission.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/tn020.htm NPS Blue Springs]</ref>\n\n==Longstreet advances toward Knoxville==\n[[File:Longstreets Knoxville Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Area of operations, Longstreet's Knoxville campaign]]\nReacting to Burnside's victories in the Cumberland Gap and at Blue Springs, and concerned that Burnside might reinforce the Federal army that was now besieged in Chattanooga, Braxton Bragg asked [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] to order James Longstreet to advance against Burnside. Longstreet and parts of his [[First Corps, Army of Northern Virginia|First Corps]] of Robert E. Lee's [[Army of Northern Virginia]] had arrived in northern [[Georgia (U.S. state) in the American Civil War|Georgia]] in time to make a critical contribution to the Confederate victory at Chickamauga. Longstreet strongly objected to the order. He knew he would be significantly outnumbered, with 10,000 men in two infantry divisions (under Maj. Gen. [[Lafayette McLaws]] and Brig. Gen. [[Micah Jenkins]], the latter commanding the division of wounded Maj. Gen. [[John Bell Hood]]) and 5,000 cavalrymen under Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Wheeler]], versus Burnside's 12,000 infantry and 8,500 cavalry. Furthermore, he knew that the remaining 40,000 Confederates around Chattanooga would also be outnumbered by approaching reinforcements under Grant and Sherman. Longstreet argued that, by separating the Confederate forces, \"We just expose both to failure, and really take no chance to ourselves of great results.\"<ref>Eicher, p. 614; Longstreet, pp. 480-83; Alexander, p. 311; Hartley, p. 1132; Korn, p. 100.</ref>\n\nWhile Longstreet's men prepared for rail transport, a small skirmish occurred in [[Greeneville, Tennessee]], on November 6. Maj. Gen. [[Robert Ransom, Jr.]], and Brig. Gen. [[William E. Jones|William E. \"Grumble\" Jones]] dispersed Union cavalry and infantry in the area, resulting in numerous prisoners from the [[7th Ohio Cavalry]] and the 2nd East Tennessee Mounted Infantry regiments.<ref>Eicher, p. 614.</ref>\n\nLongstreet's plan was to travel by railroad to [[Sweetwater, Tennessee]], approximately halfway to Knoxville, but it was a journey fraught by problems. The expected trains did not arrive on time, and the men started off on foot. When the trains did arrive, they were pulled by underpowered locomotives that could not negotiate all of the mountain grades under load, forcing the men to dismount and walk alongside the cars in the steeper sections. The engineers had insufficient wood for fuel, and the men had to stop and dismantle fences along the way to continue. It took eight days for all of Longstreet's men and equipment to travel the {{convert|60|mi|km}} to Sweetwater, and when they arrived on November 12, they found that promised supplies were not available. The men, who had traveled from the campaigns in Virginia, would not be equipped with adequate food or clothing for the winter to come.<ref>Korn, pp. 100-01; Eicher, p. 614; Hartley, p. 1132.</ref>\n\nThe Lincoln administration became concerned about Burnside's situation and, despite weeks of urging him to leave Knoxville and head south, now ordered him to hold the city. Grant attempted to organize a relief expedition from Chattanooga, but Burnside calmly suggested that 5,000 of his men would advance southwest toward Longstreet, establish contact, and gradually withdraw toward Knoxville, which would ensure that the Confederates could not easily return to Chattanooga and reinforce Bragg. Grant readily accepted. On November 14, Longstreet erected a bridge across the [[Tennessee River]] west of [[Loudon, Tennessee|Loudon]] and began his pursuit of Burnside.<ref>Hartley, pp. 1132-33; Korn, pp. 105-06; Eicher, p. 615.</ref>\n\nWheeler's cavalry approached Knoxville on November 15 and attempted to occupy the heights overlooking the city from the south bank of the [[Holston River]], but resistance from the Federal cavalrymen under William Sanders and the threat of artillery in the forts on the river's southern bank caused him to abandon his plan and rejoin Longstreet's main body on the northern side of the river.<ref>Eicher, p. 614; Hartley, pp. 1132-33.</ref>\n\n==Battles of Longstreet's Knoxville campaign==\n[[File:Knoxville defenses 1863.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Defenses of Knoxville]]\nThere were three significant battles fought during Longstreet's Knoxville campaign:\n\n===Campbell's Station (November 16)===\n{{further|Battle of Campbell's Station}}\nFollowing parallel routes, Longstreet and Burnside raced for Campbell's Station, a hamlet where Concord Road, from the south, intersected Kingston Road to Knoxville. Burnside hoped to reach the crossroads first and continue on to safety in Knoxville; Longstreet planned to reach the crossroads and hold it, which would prevent Burnside from gaining Knoxville and force him to fight outside his earthworks. By forced marching on a rainy November 16, Burnside's advance reached the vital intersection and deployed first. The main column arrived at noon with the baggage train just behind. Scarcely 15 minutes later, Longstreet's Confederates approached. Longstreet attempted a [[Pincer movement|double envelopment]]: attacks timed to strike both Union flanks simultaneously. McLaws's Confederate division struck with such force that the Union right had to redeploy, but they held. Jenkins's Confederate division maneuvered ineffectively as it advanced and was unable to turn the Union left. Burnside ordered his two divisions astride Kingston Road to withdraw three-quarters of a mile (1.2&nbsp;km) to a ridge in their rear. This was accomplished without confusion. The Confederates suspended their attack while Burnside continued his retrograde movement to Knoxville.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/tn023.htm NPS Campbell's Station]</ref>\n\nThe Federal withdrawal under pressure was well executed, and on November 17, the bulk of Burnside's army was within the defensive perimeter of Knoxville, and the so-called Siege of Knoxville began. The Confederates were not equipped for siege operations and were running short on supplies. On November 18, William Sanders, leading the cavalry that was screening Burnside's withdrawal, was mortally wounded in a skirmish. Longstreet planned an attack as early as November 20, but he delayed, waiting for reinforcements under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]] (3,500 men) and the cavalry brigade of Grumble Jones. Col. [[Edward Porter Alexander]], Longstreet's artillery chief, wrote that \"every day of delay added to the strength of the enemy's breastworks.\"<ref>Wert, p. 346; Eicher, p. 615; Korn, p. 109-11.</ref>\n\n===Fort Sanders (November 29)===\n[[File:Fort-sanders-babcock-poe-1863-tn1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|U. S. Engineers [[Orville E. Babcock]], left, seated on a tree stump, and [[Orlando Poe]], right, standing on a war damaged salient in Fort Sanders, Knoxville]]\n{{further|Battle of Fort Sanders}}\nLongstreet decided that Fort Sanders was the only vulnerable place where his men could penetrate Burnside's fortifications, which enclosed the city, and successfully conclude the siege, already a week long. The fort, named in honor of slain cavalry chief William Sanders, surmounted an eminence just northwest of Knoxville. Northwest of the fort, the land dropped off abruptly. Longstreet believed he could assemble a storming party, undetected at night, below the fortifications and overwhelm Fort Sanders by a ''coup de main'' before dawn. Following a brief artillery barrage directed at the fort's interior, three Rebel brigades charged. Union wire entanglements&mdash;telegraph wire stretched from one tree stump to another to another&mdash;delayed the attack, but the fort's outer ditch halted the Confederates. This ditch was {{convert|12|ft|m|spell=in}} wide and from four to ten feet (1&ndash;3 m) deep with vertical sides. The fort's exterior slope was also almost vertical. Crossing the ditch was nearly impossible, especially under withering defensive fire from musketry and canister. Confederate officers did lead their men into the ditch, but, without scaling ladders, few emerged on the scarp side, and the few who entered the fort were wounded, killed, or captured. The attack lasted twenty minutes and resulted in extremely lopsided casualties: 813 Confederate versus 13 Union.<ref>Eicher, p. 616; [http://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/tn025.htm NPS Fort Sanders]</ref>\n\nAs Longstreet contemplated his next move, he received word that Bragg's army was soundly defeated at the [[Third Battle of Chattanooga|Battle of Chattanooga]] on November 25. Although he was ordered to rejoin Bragg, Longstreet felt the order was impracticable and informed Bragg that he would return with his command to Virginia but would maintain the siege on Knoxville as long as possible in the hopes that Burnside and Grant could be prevented from joining forces and annihilating the Army of Tennessee. This plan turned out to be effective because Grant sent Sherman with 25,000 men to relieve the siege at Knoxville. Longstreet abandoned his siege on December 4 and withdrew towards [[Rogersville, Tennessee]], {{convert|65|mi|km}} to the northeast, preparing to go into winter quarters. Sherman left Maj. Gen. [[Gordon Granger]] at Knoxville and returned to Chattanooga with the bulk of his army. Maj. Gen. [[John G. Parke]], Burnside's chief of staff, pursued the Confederates with a force of 8,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry, but not too closely. Longstreet continued to [[Rutledge, Tennessee|Rutledge]] on December 6 and Rogersville on December 9. Parke sent Brig. Gen. [[James M. Shackelford]] on with about 4,000 cavalry and infantry to search for Longstreet.<ref>Hartley, p. 1133; Eicher, pp. 616-17.</ref>\n\n===Bean's Station (December 14)===\n{{further|Battle of Bean's Station}}\nOn December 13, Shackelford was near [[Bean Station, Tennessee|Bean's Station]] on the [[Holston River]]. Longstreet decided to go back and capture Bean's Station. Three Confederate columns and artillery approached Bean's Station to catch the Federals in a vise. By 2:00&nbsp;a.m. on December 14, one column was skirmishing with Union pickets. The pickets held out as best they could and warned Shackelford of the Confederate presence. He deployed his force for an assault. Soon, the battle started and continued throughout most of the day. Confederate flanking attacks and other assaults occurred at various times and locations, but the Federals held until Southern reinforcements arrived. By nightfall, the Federals were retiring from Bean's Station through Bean's Gap and on to Blain's Cross Roads. Longstreet set out to attack the Union forces again the next morning, but as he approached them at Blain's Cross Roads, he found them well-entrenched. Longstreet withdrew, and the Federals soon left the area.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/tn026.htm NPS Bean's Station]</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Knoxville campaign ended following the battle of Bean's Station, and both sides went into winter quarters. The only real effect of the minor campaign was to deprive Bragg of troops he sorely needed in Chattanooga. Longstreet's foray as an independent commander was a failure, and his self-confidence was damaged. He reacted to the failure of the campaign by blaming others, as he had done at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]] in the [[Peninsula Campaign]] the previous year. He relieved [[Lafayette McLaws]] from command and requested the court martial of Brig. Gens. [[Jerome B. Robertson]] and [[Evander M. Law]]. He also submitted a letter of resignation to [[Adjutant General]] [[Samuel Cooper (general)|Samuel Cooper]] on December 30, 1863, but his request to be relieved was denied. His corps suffered through a severe winter in East Tennessee with inadequate shelter and provisions, unable to return to Virginia until the spring.<ref>Wert, pp. 340-59, 360-75; Longstreet, pp. 480-523.</ref>\n\nBurnside's competent conduct of the campaign, despite apprehensions in Washington, partially restored his military reputation that had been damaged so severely at Fredericksburg. His successful hold on Knoxville, plus Grant's victory in Chattanooga, put much of East Tennessee under Union control for the rest of the war.<ref>Hartley, p. 1133.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Knoxville, Tennessee]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n* [[David J.

She has two older brothers:  former [[NBA]] basketball player [[Anthony Parker]] and Marcus Parker, who is a doctor.<ref name=\"Biography Today\">{{cite book|last=|first=|title=Biography Today|year=2010|page=[https://archive.org/details/biographytodayge0000unse_h7i3/page/143 143]|publisher=Omnigraphics|location=[[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]|isbn=978-0-7808-1058-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/biographytodayge0000unse_h7i3/page/143}}</ref>\n\nParker and her family moved to [[Naperville, Illinois]] at the age of two, where she spent her childhood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/the-life-career-wnba-candace-parker/|title=Candace Parker Knows What She Wants|first=Louisa|last=Thomas|date=June 19, 2013|publisher=}}</ref> Her family loved basketball and she began playing at an early age. Her father played basketball at the [[University of Iowa]] in the 1970s. The Parker family were also huge [[Chicago Bulls]] fans. Candace was worried about playing basketball, fearing she would not live up to the level of play her father and brother demonstrated, so she focused on playing soccer. It wasn't until the eighth grade that her family convinced her to play basketball. Her father helped coach and critique her. Parker said of the experience, \"He did things to make me mad, to challenge me, because I was so much more athletic and had so much more knowledge of the game than everyone else that sometimes I just coasted. If me and my dad went to a park and he didn't think I was practicing hard enough, he'd just get in the car and leave. And I'd have to run home. I mean run home. Once I figured that out, I'd always try to go to close-by-parks.\" <ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.144-145</ref>\n\n==High school career==\nLike her older brother [[Anthony Parker]], she attended [[Naperville Central High School]] in [[Naperville, Illinois]] in 2004. While in high school, Parker led her basketball team to Class AA state titles in 2003 and 2004, and compiled a school-record 2,768 points (22.9 points per game) and 1,592 rebounds (13.2 rebounds per game) while starting 119 of the 121 games in which she played.\n\nShe is the only two-time award winner of the [[USA Today]] High School Player of the Year, winning the award in 2003 and 2004. Parker also won the [[Naismith Prep Player of the Year Award]] and Gatorade Female Basketball Player of the Year Award in 2003 and 2004. In 2004, she was named Gatorade Female Athlete of the Year, [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association|WBCA]] All-American and [[McDonald's All-American]]. She participated in the 2004 WCBA All-America Game where she scored 9 points.<ref name=\"WBCA Box Scores\"/> She was also a consensus pick as player of the year in Illinois in 2002, 2003, and 2004, and was a four-year member of the All-State first team.\n\nOn December 27, 2001, Parker dunked for the first time in competition as a 15-year-old sophomore at Naperville Central High School, this is believed to be the first slam dunk by a female athlete in Illinois.\n\nOn July 11, 2003, Parker tore her [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] in her left knee in a summer league game. On November 11, Parker announced her commitment to [[University of Tennessee, Knoxville|Tennessee]] on [[ESPNEWS]], becoming the first women's player to announce the oral commitment live on ESPNEWS. On December 29, Parker returned to action for Naperville Central and a few months later, led her team to its second consecutive state title.\n\nOn March 29, 2004, Parker won the slam dunk contest at [[McDonald's All-American Game]], becoming the first female to win the event and beating the likes of [[Josh Smith]] and [[J. R. Smith]].\n\nIn August 2004, Parker led the undefeated USA Junior World Championship team to a gold medal with 16.6 points and 8.8 rebounds per game. While training, Parker had a relapse of knee pain and was required to undergo surgery both the lateral meniscus and the lateral articular cartilage in her left knee.\n\n==College career==\n===Redshirt year===\nParker entered the [[University of Tennessee, Knoxville|University of Tennessee]] in the fall of 2004. On February 17, 2005, Tennessee announced Parker would redshirt her first season due to a knee injury.\n\n===Freshman year===\nParker started for the [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|Tennessee Lady Vols]] during the 2005-06 season. On March 19, 2006, in an NCAA tournament first-round game against [[United States Military Academy|Army]], she became the first woman to dunk in an NCAA tournament game, then became the first woman to dunk twice in an NCAA tournament game.<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.146\">\"Biography Today\", pp. 146</ref> She was the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] Rookie of the Year (Coaches and AP) and helped the Lady Vols win the [[SEC Tournament|2006 SEC tournament championship]]. With 17 seconds remaining in the SEC tournament championship game against [[LSU Lady Tigers basketball|LSU]], Parker hit the game-winning shot. She was named tournament MVP and was named to the 2006 Kodak All-America team, making her one of the few to ever receive the award as a freshman. However, in the NCAA tournament regional finals against [[North Carolina Tar Heels women's basketball|North Carolina]], Parker got in early foul trouble and was out of the game for much of the first half. Tennessee ultimately lost the game.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:candace&nicky.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Candace and [[Nicky Anosike]] celebrate. {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] -->\nParker was the only college player named to the USA squad for the [[2006 FIBA World Championship for Women]] in [[Brazil]].

She did it in 56 games, beating [[Chamique Holdsclaw]]'s mark of 57 games and [[Tamika Catchings]]'s of 58 games. On March 1, at the SEC tournament in Duluth, Georgia, Parker was named the 2007 SEC Player of the Year. On April 3, she led the Lady Vols to their first National Championship victory since 1998, beating [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights|Rutgers]] 59\u201346, Parker finished the game with 17 points and earned the tournament's [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]] honor.\n\n===Junior year===\n[[File:2008-W-NCAA-Final-Four-4-07-08.jpg|thumb|Parker (left) gets ready for the jump ball against [[Sylvia Fowles]] (right)]]\nParker announced on February 21, 2008, that she would forgo her final season of eligibility at Tennessee in order to focus on the [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]] and pursue a professional career in basketball.

In the first round, they beat the [[San Antonio Stars]] two games to none. In the Western Conference Finals, against the [[Minnesota Lynx]], the Sparks lost two games to none, while Parker scored 33 points, grabbed 15 rebounds, and had 4 blocks in a must-win game two, which they lost, 80-79, therefore ending their season. Parker was very emotional following the loss, hugging her mother Sara with tears.\n\nOn July 27, 2013, in her sixth season, Parker played in her first All-Star game. She scored 23 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in a come from behind win for the West and was named WNBA All-Star MVP. The Sparks finished with the same record (24\u201310) as the year earlier, again earning the second seed in the Western Conference. On September 19, Parker was named the 2013 [[WNBA Most Valuable Player]]. Parker became the fifth player to earn multiple WNBA MVP awards, joining [[Lisa Leslie]] (3), [[Sheryl Swoopes]] (3), [[Lauren Jackson]] (3) and [[Cynthia Cooper-Dyke|Cynthia Cooper]] (2). The Sparks faced the [[Phoenix Mercury]] in the Western Conference Semifinals. In game one, at Staples Center, the Sparks lost, forcing them to win in game two, at Phoenix to stay in the series. In game two, Parker scored 31 points and had 11 rebounds to lead the Sparks to a win, bringing the series back to L.A. for a game three. In a nailbiter, the Sparks lost on a last second jumper by Phoenix rookie [[Brittney Griner]], ending the Sparks' season by one point for the second straight year.\n\n===2014: Ownership and coaching changes===\nIn January 2014, Williams Group Holdings abruptly announced they would relinquish their ownership of the Sparks. For a brief time, the Sparks future in Los Angeles was in some jeopardy. Despite major uncertainty, a month later the team was purchased by an investment group including [[Magic Johnson]], with promises of bringing a championship to Los Angeles. The team went into the All-Star break with an unexpected 10\u201313 record. Immediately after the break, head coach [[Carol Ross]] was let go and General Manager and former player, [[Penny Toler]], assumed the position of coach for the remainder of the season. Parker led her team to finish with a 16\u201318 record and clinched the number 4 seed to head to the playoffs for the 14th time in franchise history and 6th time for Parker. Despite enormous effort from her in the series, they lost 72\u201375 in Game 1 and 93\u201368 in Game 2 to the eventual champions the Phoenix Mercury, marking the second consecutive year the Mercury knocked the Sparks out of the playoffs in the semi-final round. Parker averaged 19.4 points, 7.1 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 1.3 blocks per game in the regular season.\n\n===2015: Break and breakout return===\n[[File:Parker_2016-10-09.jpg|thumb|Parker (center) and [[Essence Carson]] (far right), with [[Lindsay Whalen]], [[Sylvia Fowles]] and [[Maya Moore]] of the [[Minnesota Lynx]] in 2016]]\nOn April 9, 2015, Parker announced she would miss an undetermined amount of the season to rest. Prior to the season, [[Brian Agler]] was hired as the Sparks' new head coach. Parker returned to the Sparks after the All-Star break on July 29. Despite missing more than half of the season, she filled the box score like no player ever had before. In 16 regular-season games, Parker set a career high of 6.3 assists per game, ranking 1st in the league, two more than her previous career high, a number that only 7 other players in WNBA history have matched; all except Parker were guards. Additionally, she averaged 19.4 points (4th), 10.1 rebounds (1st), 1.8 blocks (4th) and career high 1.9 steals (5th) per game.  Her unbelievable performance earned her the Western Conference Player of the Month for August.  The Sparks had been struggling with a 3\u201315 record before her return, one of the worst records in franchise history. However, Parker managed to lead her team to the number 4 seed with a 14\u201320 record. The team put up incredible effort against the number 1 seed, Minnesota Lynx in the series, losing game one by only 2 points. In game two, Parker had 25 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Sparks past the Lynx 81\u201371 and force a game three. Despite leading all scorers with 28 points and had 13 rebounds, Parker couldn't help her team in game three as they lost to the Lynx 91\u201380. Parker was named a part of the 2015 All-WNBA Second Team.\n\n===2016: Loss of Coach Summitt and first WNBA championship===\nIn 2016, Parker re-signed with the Sparks as an unrestricted free agent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/news/candace-parker-re-signs-los-angeles-sparks/|title=Candace Parker Re-Signs with Los Angeles Sparks - WNBA.com - Official Site of the WNBA|publisher=}}</ref> During the season, Parker averaged 15.3 points per game, becoming the team's second option next to [[Nneka Ogwumike]] who led the team in scoring and won the [[WNBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP award]].  However, in late June, Parker's college coach and mentor, [[Pat Summitt]], died at the age of 64 from [[Alzheimer's disease]]. That night, against the [[Dallas Wings]], Parker had an incredible performance in the second half, finishing the game with 31 points, and had her season high of rebounding with 13, guiding her team to a victory. In an emotional post-game interview, she dedicated the season to Summitt.  With a supporting cast of Nneka Ogwumike and [[Kristi Toliver]], the Sparks were a championship contender in the league, finishing 26\u20138. With the WNBA's new playoff format in effect, the Sparks were the number 2 seed in the league with a double-bye to the semi-finals (the last round before the WNBA Finals) facing the [[Chicago Sky]]. The Sparks defeated the Sky 3\u20131 in the series, advancing to the WNBA Finals for the first time since 2003.\n\nIn the WNBA Finals, it was only the second time in league history where two teams from the same conference faced each other in the Finals due to the new playoff format, as the Sparks faced the championship-defending [[Minnesota Lynx]]. This finals series proved to be the best the WNBA had ever seen, with Parker being at the forefront of the Sparks' success.  For Game 3, in Los Angeles, Parker put up her best performance of the finals thus far, contributing 24 points, 9 rebounds, and 2 assists to help the Sparks take a 2\u20131 series lead, with a dominant 92\u201375 win.

Parker has been selected to six all-WNBA teams and five all-star teams, and was the first player to win the Rookie of the Year and the WNBA Most Valuable Player Award in the same season.\n\n==Early life==\nParker was born on April 19, 1986 to Sara and Larry Parker in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. She has two older brothers:  former [[NBA]] basketball player [[Anthony Parker]] and Marcus Parker, who is a doctor.<ref name=\"Biography Today\">{{cite book|last=|first=|title=Biography Today|year=2010|page=[https://archive.org/details/biographytodayge0000unse_h7i3/page/143 143]|publisher=Omnigraphics|location=[[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]|isbn=978-0-7808-1058-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/biographytodayge0000unse_h7i3/page/143}}</ref>\n\nParker and her family moved to [[Naperville, Illinois]] at the age of two, where she spent her childhood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/the-life-career-wnba-candace-parker/|title=Candace Parker Knows What She Wants|first=Louisa|last=Thomas|date=June 19, 2013|publisher=}}</ref> Her family loved basketball and she began playing at an early age. Her father played basketball at the [[University of Iowa]] in the 1970s. The Parker family were also huge [[Chicago Bulls]] fans. Candace was worried about playing basketball, fearing she would not live up to the level of play her father and brother demonstrated, so she focused on playing soccer. It wasn't until the eighth grade that her family convinced her to play basketball. Her father helped coach and critique her. Parker said of the experience, \"He did things to make me mad, to challenge me, because I was so much more athletic and had so much more knowledge of the game than everyone else that sometimes I just coasted. If me and my dad went to a park and he didn't think I was practicing hard enough, he'd just get in the car and leave. And I'd have to run home. I mean run home. Once I figured that out, I'd always try to go to close-by-parks.\" <ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.144-145</ref>\n\n==High school career==\nLike her older brother [[Anthony Parker]], she attended [[Naperville Central High School]] in [[Naperville, Illinois]] in 2004. While in high school, Parker led her basketball team to Class AA state titles in 2003 and 2004, and compiled a school-record 2,768 points (22.9 points per game) and 1,592 rebounds (13.2 rebounds per game) while starting 119 of the 121 games in which she played.\n\nShe is the only two-time award winner of the [[USA Today]] High School Player of the Year, winning the award in 2003 and 2004. Parker also won the [[Naismith Prep Player of the Year Award]] and Gatorade Female Basketball Player of the Year Award in 2003 and 2004. In 2004, she was named Gatorade Female Athlete of the Year, [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association|WBCA]] All-American and [[McDonald's All-American]]. She participated in the 2004 WCBA All-America Game where she scored 9 points.<ref name=\"WBCA Box Scores\"/> She was also a consensus pick as player of the year in Illinois in 2002, 2003, and 2004, and was a four-year member of the All-State first team.\n\nOn December 27, 2001, Parker dunked for the first time in competition as a 15-year-old sophomore at Naperville Central High School, this is believed to be the first slam dunk by a female athlete in Illinois.\n\nOn July 11, 2003, Parker tore her [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] in her left knee in a summer league game. On November 11, Parker announced her commitment to [[University of Tennessee, Knoxville|Tennessee]] on [[ESPNEWS]], becoming the first women's player to announce the oral commitment live on ESPNEWS. On December 29, Parker returned to action for Naperville Central and a few months later, led her team to its second consecutive state title.\n\nOn March 29, 2004, Parker won the slam dunk contest at [[McDonald's All-American Game]], becoming the first female to win the event and beating the likes of [[Josh Smith]] and [[J. R. Smith]].\n\nIn August 2004, Parker led the undefeated USA Junior World Championship team to a gold medal with 16.6 points and 8.8 rebounds per game. While training, Parker had a relapse of knee pain and was required to undergo surgery both the lateral meniscus and the lateral articular cartilage in her left knee.\n\n==College career==\n===Redshirt year===\nParker entered the [[University of Tennessee, Knoxville|University of Tennessee]] in the fall of 2004. On February 17, 2005, Tennessee announced Parker would redshirt her first season due to a knee injury.\n\n===Freshman year===\nParker started for the [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|Tennessee Lady Vols]] during the 2005-06 season. On March 19, 2006, in an NCAA tournament first-round game against [[United States Military Academy|Army]], she became the first woman to dunk in an NCAA tournament game, then became the first woman to dunk twice in an NCAA tournament game.<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.146\">\"Biography Today\", pp. 146</ref> She was the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] Rookie of the Year (Coaches and AP) and helped the Lady Vols win the [[SEC Tournament|2006 SEC tournament championship]]. With 17 seconds remaining in the SEC tournament championship game against [[LSU Lady Tigers basketball|LSU]], Parker hit the game-winning shot. She was named tournament MVP and was named to the 2006 Kodak All-America team, making her one of the few to ever receive the award as a freshman. However, in the NCAA tournament regional finals against [[North Carolina Tar Heels women's basketball|North Carolina]], Parker got in early foul trouble and was out of the game for much of the first half. Tennessee ultimately lost the game.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:candace&nicky.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Candace and [[Nicky Anosike]] celebrate. {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] -->\nParker was the only college player named to the USA squad for the [[2006 FIBA World Championship for Women]] in [[Brazil]]. The USA squad finished in third place.\n\n===Sophomore year===\nOn January 28, 2007, in an away game against Alabama, Parker scored her 1,000th career point as a sophomore, making her the fastest player in Lady Vol history to do so. She did it in 56 games, beating [[Chamique Holdsclaw]]'s mark of 57 games and [[Tamika Catchings]]'s of 58 games. On March 1, at the SEC tournament in Duluth, Georgia, Parker was named the 2007 SEC Player of the Year. On April 3, she led the Lady Vols to their first National Championship victory since 1998, beating [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights|Rutgers]] 59\u201346, Parker finished the game with 17 points and earned the tournament's [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]] honor.\n\n===Junior year===\n[[File:2008-W-NCAA-Final-Four-4-07-08.jpg|thumb|Parker (left) gets ready for the jump ball against [[Sylvia Fowles]] (right)]]\nParker announced on February 21, 2008, that she would forgo her final season of eligibility at Tennessee in order to focus on the [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]] and pursue a professional career in basketball.

The team went into the All-Star break with an unexpected 10\u201313 record. Immediately after the break, head coach [[Carol Ross]] was let go and General Manager and former player, [[Penny Toler]], assumed the position of coach for the remainder of the season. Parker led her team to finish with a 16\u201318 record and clinched the number 4 seed to head to the playoffs for the 14th time in franchise history and 6th time for Parker.

Prior to the season, [[Brian Agler]] was hired as the Sparks' new head coach. Parker returned to the Sparks after the All-Star break on July 29. Despite missing more than half of the season, she filled the box score like no player ever had before. In 16 regular-season games, Parker set a career high of 6.3 assists per game, ranking 1st in the league, two more than her previous career high, a number that only 7 other players in WNBA history have matched; all except Parker were guards. Additionally, she averaged 19.4 points (4th), 10.1 rebounds (1st), 1.8 blocks (4th) and career high 1.9 steals (5th) per game.  Her unbelievable performance earned her the Western Conference Player of the Month for August.  The Sparks had been struggling with a 3\u201315 record before her return, one of the worst records in franchise history. However, Parker managed to lead her team to the number 4 seed with a 14\u201320 record. The team put up incredible effort against the number 1 seed, Minnesota Lynx in the series, losing game one by only 2 points. In game two, Parker had 25 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Sparks past the Lynx 81\u201371 and force a game three. Despite leading all scorers with 28 points and had 13 rebounds, Parker couldn't help her team in game three as they lost to the Lynx 91\u201380.

However, in late June, Parker's college coach and mentor, [[Pat Summitt]], died at the age of 64 from [[Alzheimer's disease]]. That night, against the [[Dallas Wings]], Parker had an incredible performance in the second half, finishing the game with 31 points, and had her season high of rebounding with 13, guiding her team to a victory. In an emotional post-game interview, she dedicated the season to Summitt.  With a supporting cast of Nneka Ogwumike and [[Kristi Toliver]], the Sparks were a championship contender in the league, finishing 26\u20138. With the WNBA's new playoff format in effect, the Sparks were the number 2 seed in the league with a double-bye to the semi-finals (the last round before the WNBA Finals) facing the [[Chicago Sky]]. The Sparks defeated the Sky 3\u20131 in the series, advancing to the WNBA Finals for the first time since 2003.\n\nIn the WNBA Finals, it was only the second time in league history where two teams from the same conference faced each other in the Finals due to the new playoff format, as the Sparks faced the championship-defending [[Minnesota Lynx]]. This finals series proved to be the best the WNBA had ever seen, with Parker being at the forefront of the Sparks' success.  For Game 3, in Los Angeles, Parker put up her best performance of the finals thus far, contributing 24 points, 9 rebounds, and 2 assists to help the Sparks take a 2\u20131 series lead, with a dominant 92\u201375 win. This put Parker one win away from her first title, as the Sparks already had one victory in their hands. However, the Lynx upset the Sparks on their home court in Game 4 with an 85\u201379 win, forcing a winner-take-all Game 5. The Sparks would end up winning the decisive Game 5 on the road, that ended with a game winning close range shot by Parker's teammate, Nneka Ogwumike, who put the Sparks ahead 77\u201376 with 3.1 seconds remaining after grabbing an offensive rebound. The Sparks claimed their first championship since 2002. After the game, an emotional Parker uttered the words \"this is for Pat,\" implying that the championship win was in honor of Pat Summitt. Parker won her first championship and won [[WNBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Finals MVP]]. In Game 5 of the series, Parker had scored a game-high 28 points along with 12 rebounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/game/20161020/LASMIN/|title=10/20/16: Los Angeles Sparks @ Minnesota Lynx - WNBA.com - Official Site of the WNBA|publisher=}}</ref> Also in 2016, Parker was named in the [[WNBA Top 20@20]], a list of the league's best 20 players ever in celebration of the WNBA's twentieth anniversary.\n\n===2017\u2013present: Chasing a second championship===\nIn February 2017, Parker signed a multi-year contract extension with the Sparks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sparks.wnba.com/news/two-time-wnba-mvp-candace-parker-extends-contract-los-angeles-sparks/|title=Two-time WNBA MVP Candace Parker Extends Contract with Los Angeles Sparks - Los Angeles Sparks|publisher=}}</ref> During the 2017 season, Parker was voted into the [[2017 WNBA All-Star Game]], making it her fourth all-star nomination.

CDCR correctional officers are sworn law enforcement officers with peace officer powers.\n\nAs of 2013, CDCR employed approximately 24,000 peace officers (state correctional officers), 1,800 state parole agents, and 600 criminal investigators/special agents.\n\n==History==\nIn 1851, California activated its first state-run institution.

When an adult inmate arrives at a state prison, he/she is assigned a classification based on his/her committed offense. Each prison is designed to house different varieties of inmate offenders, from Level I inmates to Level IV inmates; the higher the level, the higher risk the inmate poses. Selected prisons within the state are equipped with security housing units, reception centers, and/or \"condemned\" units.  These security levels are defined as follows:<ref name=CDCR2007>California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public. Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]]. Cadets must complete a 12-week formal and comprehensive training program. The curriculum consists of 640 hours (four months) of training. Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course. Upon completion of the academy, cadets are sworn in as CDCR peace officers. Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation). Upon completion of their two-year training they are then considered regular state correctional peace officers (CDCR officers)<ref name=acad>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | title = Correctional Officer Training | work = Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation | accessdate = April 27, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416205837/http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | archivedate = April 16, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Fugitive Apprehension Team ===\n\nAn elite and low-profile unit within CDCR is the Fugitive Apprehension Team or FAT which is made up of just over eighty agents who are assigned to offices throughout the state. FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates.

They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\n\n== History of the Special Service Unit ==\nThe Special Service Unit of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe.\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of Charles Manson's cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, Phillip Garrido was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California. \n\nIn August 2014, convicted murderer Scott Landers escaped from the back of a CDCR transport van while on the Interstate 5 freeway just north of Atwater, Calif. Landers had been convicted of the stabbing of a 61-year-old man in Riverside, Calif. and was serving twenty-five years to life. Upon his escape, members of the elite Special Service Unit were called in from across the state to lead the investigation. Within twenty-four hours, the escaped murderer was caught and brought back to CDCR custody.\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v.

Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Fugitive Apprehension Team ===\n\nAn elite and low-profile unit within CDCR is the Fugitive Apprehension Team or FAT which is made up of just over eighty agents who are assigned to offices throughout the state. FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]]. Cadets must complete a 12-week formal and comprehensive training program. The curriculum consists of 640 hours (four months) of training. Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course. Upon completion of the academy, cadets are sworn in as CDCR peace officers. Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation). Upon completion of their two-year training they are then considered regular state correctional peace officers (CDCR officers)<ref name=acad>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | title = Correctional Officer Training | work = Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation | accessdate = April 27, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416205837/http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | archivedate = April 16, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates.

They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\n\n== History of the Special Service Unit ==\nThe Special Service Unit of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe.\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of Charles Manson's cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, Phillip Garrido was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California. \n\nIn August 2014, convicted murderer Scott Landers escaped from the back of a CDCR transport van while on the Interstate 5 freeway just north of Atwater, Calif. Landers had been convicted of the stabbing of a 61-year-old man in Riverside, Calif. and was serving twenty-five years to life. Upon his escape, members of the elite Special Service Unit were called in from across the state to lead the investigation. Within twenty-four hours, the escaped murderer was caught and brought back to CDCR custody.\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v. Brown|Coleman v. Brown}}\n\nThere are at multiple ongoing lawsuits over medical care in the California prison system. ''[[Plata v. Brown]]'' is a federal [[class action]] [[civil rights]] lawsuit alleging unconstitutionally inadequate medical services, and as a result of a [[stipulation]] between the plaintiffs and the state, the court issued an [[injunction]] requiring defendants to provide \"only the minimum level of medical care required under the Eighth Amendment.\" However, three years after approving the stipulation as an order of the court, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing that revealed the continued existence of appalling conditions arising from defendants\u2019 failure to provide adequate medical care to California inmates.

Except for the several relatively good toll roads which connect major cities (all of them one-lane) roads are poorly maintained and subject to inclement weather, since only 10% of the roadways are tarred.
